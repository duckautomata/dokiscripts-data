1
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,270
Okay, we're swapped now.

2
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,410
I couldn't find the screen.

3
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,510
You baited?

4
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,530
You baited!

5
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,090
I couldn't find the screen!

6
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,070
She's baiting again.

7
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,890
Anyway, welcome.

8
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,510
We're TSM.

9
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,950
Hey guys, new TSM team here.

10
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,050
They just signed us up, guys.

11
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,330
Because last time, TSM got like 17th place.

12
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,050
So they called us out to replace them.

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,430
Yeah, we gave them the boot.

14
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,050
Yeah, it is what it is.

15
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,090
We got the boot.

16
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,210
This is how it's gonna be now.

17
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,310
We're gonna go to LGS.

18
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,350
Hell yeah.

19
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,410
We're gonna go to World Cup!

20
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,690
Yeah, that's what it's called.

21
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,590
World Cup!

22
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,130
That's what they call it.

23
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,230
Yeah!

24
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,210
Yeah!

25
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,650
Let's go!

26
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,350
World Cup!

27
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,050
Yeah!

28
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,510
I'm gonna be goalkeeper!

29
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,410
Oh my god.

30
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,730
Guys, guys.

31
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,810
Okay, so RPR is gonna carry us.

32
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,430
And he's gonna be on Bloodhound.

33
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,070
No, I'm not gonna be on Bloodhound.

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,290
I'm probably gonna play Wraith.

35
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,470
So we can win.

36
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,370
Wait, what do we play then?

37
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,430
We need a Bloodhound.

38
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:11,850
I'm gonna play Bloodhound.

39
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,930
Okay, I can play Bloodhound too.

40
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,950
How about we play Lifeline Bloodhound?

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,970
Oh shit!

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,510
We're going European comp?

43
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,410
Yeah, so we can one live, two port, and three shield.

44
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,090
Okay, I'll be Lifeline.

45
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,410
I'll be Lifeline.

46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,830
Ditto's gonna be our controller player.

48
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,950
Oh yeah.

49
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,470
Oy vey.

50
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,750
Oy vey.

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,590
Oy vey.

52
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,250
It's just scrims.

53
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,670
It's not even the real tournament.

54
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,990
Scrims that we didn't even know where we landed two minutes before you started.

55
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,290
You're the one that gave me the landing spot!

56
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,590
You asked me to give you landing spots.

57
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,510
And then you said, no, two landing spots are not enough.

58
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,270
You need to give me ten for each map.

59
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,970
I wasn't the one that made the rules for this.

60
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,690
They were like, you have to list like ten.

61
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,490
Okay, they wanted more.

62
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,730
I shortened it because I was like, I'm not fucking asking.

63
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,850
I'm not fucking asking RPR for ten landing spots.

64
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,410
I'm not fucking asking RPR for ten landing spots.

65
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,890
It was like eight.

66
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,990
I don't even know ten landing spots on the map.

67
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,230
I was like, give me top five.

68
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,250
You know what they asked for me?

69
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,450
They said give us eight.

70
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,930
And I was like, I'm just gonna give them five.

71
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,630
I barely know five.

72
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,010
Remember when you asked me, I was like, oh shit.

73
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,830
What the fuck is this?

74
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,670
This is more prep than ALGS.

75
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,810
Okay, to be fair, they also wanted me to be there at ten AM to see who was gonna get the landing spots.

76
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,110
But I was like, I don't wanna wake up at ten, man.

77
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,550
Ten AM?

78
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,850
I don't even wake up for ALGS at that time.

79
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,130
They were like, okay, you can...

80
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,250
Okay, but to be fair, to everybody, it's like, oh, you can't make it to ten AM.

81
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,190
Just let us know in advance.

82
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,270
And I was like, oh, thank God.

83
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,150
I don't have to wake up at ten in the morning to figure out where the fuck we're landing.

84
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,570
Wait, how are...

85
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,770
Doki, how are we the laziest team in the fucking lobby, but we got the best landing spots?

86
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,810
To make it sense.

87
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,130
We're just that lucky.

88
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,650
We got siphon and barometer.

89
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,370
Okay.

90
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:21,390
If we get fucking absolutely fucked over with the best landing spots, this is RPR's fault.

91
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,050
How is it like... okay, listen.

92
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,450
Because you're the one that chose those landing spots.

93
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,330
You chose these landing spots.

94
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,110
Okay, now is it my fault?

95
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,470
I gave us the best possible conditions.

96
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,990
I gave us the best possible conditions to win.

97
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,630
Yeah, but if we don't win, then it's IGL's fault.

98
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,350
Deep does IGLing?

99
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,990
No, you said IGL can never be on Bloodhound.

100
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,370
Why?

101
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:43,370
Why me?

102
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,270
Yeah, she can't be.

103
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,550
She's on Bloodhound.

104
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,450
Because I'm tired of being wrong.

105
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,950
I don't want to be voted all the time.

106
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,430
You are being right!

107
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,150
Someone else take the fault for once.

108
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,270
Well, then someone else be IGL.

109
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,010
Not me.

110
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,150
You have to be IGL because you're ALGS champion.

111
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,750
Yeah, you're ALGS champion.

112
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,510
Exactly.

113
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,390
Oh no, I was cursed with such a high IQ.

114
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,370
Holy shit.

115
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,350
Such a high IQ, but yeah, you don't win this scrim.

116
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,890
I don't know.

117
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,510
I am not at fault for my teammates actions.

118
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,530
Yes, you are.

119
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,390
It's always the IGL's fault.

120
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,470
That is not how this shit works.

121
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,530
That is 100% how it works.

122
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,690
You control your character.

123
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,950
I've seen competitive Apex on Reddit.

124
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,870
That's exactly how it works.

125
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,950
Reddit hates me, by the way.

126
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,790
They think I do nothing for my team.

127
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,410
But they're right.

128
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,550
They're normies.

129
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,730
Normies are always right.

130
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:54,850
Yeah, that's like me watching football once a week for the next three years and being like, Yeah, no, he should have went left.

131
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,670
And then he should have kicked the ball to the right.

132
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,370
And then he should have won the game.

133
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,510
And he's right.

134
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,450
You're right.

135
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,650
Listen, it's simple.

136
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,530
Apex is simple.

137
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,810
Kill everyone, win the game.

138
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,350
What if you don't kill everyone?

139
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,350
Ditto, can you kill everybody?

140
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,150
Then you lose.

141
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,930
Maybe if...

142
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,330
If Aphia don't die first.

143
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,650
Ditto, what is your stream title?

144
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,290
Ditto, Ditto, Ditto, swap, swap.

145
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,530
No!

146
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,050
Oh my, Magite.

147
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,810
Oh my, Magite.

148
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,810
Don't worry.

149
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,830
It's okay, it's okay.

150
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,790
We both have life.

151
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,370
Okay, I guess I'm on Bloodhound.

152
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,450
I guess.

153
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,810
Also, Sound Guy, I turned down RPR and turned up Ditto.

154
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,010
Let me know if it's better now.

155
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,850
How the fuck is this my fault?

156
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,630
This is your fault because IGL should have been the one that yelled Ditto!

157
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,670
Not me!

158
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,090
You are the IGL.

159
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,550
You have to tell me to shoot the Kaido, okay?

160
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,010
Yes!

161
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,430
Thank Jesus.

162
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,130
Thank you.

163
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,150
I might have to mute both of you guys for this tournament so we can win.

164
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,430
They knew.

165
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,270
They picked the wrong characters.

166
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,050
What did I sign up for?

167
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,030
This is all...

168
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,170
You said yes.

169
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,330
You said yes, yeah.

170
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,330
That was the first mistake number one.

171
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,530
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

172
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,490
We'll be okay.

173
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,470
You see, Chad doesn't know what TSM stands for.

174
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,610
It's TSM.

175
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,010
We got signed, guys.

176
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,110
We're on TSM now.

177
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,510
Can Chad guess what TSM stands for?

178
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,010
Because our TSM is a little bit different than Team Clones.

179
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,430
We're copyright free.

180
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,210
We're like TSM on Wish.

181
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,910
It's okay, guys.

182
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,890
I believe in us to get top five.

183
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,090
Because there's like, you know, there's like not even a full fucking roster here.

184
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,770
Dude, I was built for this shit.

185
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,150
Bullying VTubers in costumes?

186
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,250
That's my whole fucking career.

187
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,870
It's what I do.

188
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,530
Yeah, because you couldn't bully pro players anymore.

189
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,670
I literally want champs.

190
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,330
Like, what do you want?

191
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,250
You have to bully VTubers to feel good about yourself.

192
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,330
Yeah.

193
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,930
Yeah, fuck them VTubers.

194
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,370
It's fucked up.

195
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,390
Okay,

196
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,630
yeah, bring Ditto up a little bit more on Discord.

197
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,510
Now you're at 190.

198
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,110
You guys are?

199
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,690
SM stands for Team So Mad.

200
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,790
Because that's what I'm gonna be on a game.

201
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,670
HAHAHA.

202
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,150
Team So Mad.

203
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,070
Team So Mad, that's us.

204
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,750
Yeah, who's gonna be mad?

205
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,770
Ditto and I are gonna have fun.

206
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,870
Yeah.

207
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,590
Cause we're all good friends.

208
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,630
Cause we're all good friends.

209
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:02,950
Everybody.

210
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,050
Friendship and positivity.

211
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,330
PMA.

212
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:13,590
You always need that one guy in the group that you piss off because it's funny.

213
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,110
And I maintain my positive mental attitude through this.

214
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,450
PMA guys!

215
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,110
Keep it up!

216
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,510
See?

217
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,430
He loves it here guys!

218
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,730
He loves it here.

219
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,390
Where's the gun?

220
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,810
You can say he's a little M because he likes it.

221
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,810
You went too far.

222
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,470
There's a line you cannot cross.

223
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,590
And you crossed it.

224
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,610
What do you mean?

225
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,010
What's the line?

226
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,750
If there was a line you would have said no.

227
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,610
I'm tired of this slander.

228
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,790
If there was a line you would have said no.

229
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,330
You wouldn't even be here.

230
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,290
I can't take this shit no more.

231
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,910
I'm actually going to become Menhera.

232
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,730
This is crazy.

233
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,650
Wait, you're not already?

234
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,570
I'm on my way.

235
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,610
I'm not fucking Tsun.

236
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,150
Is he a Menhera?

237
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,770
I'm on my way.

238
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,350
Yeah, me too.

239
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,030
I think so too.

240
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,370
If I am Menhera then he invented Menhera.

241
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,790
Can you say the beauty of Menhera?

242
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,110
He is what?

243
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,610
Menhera.

244
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,430
And he said he likes Menhera.

245
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,290
Okay, I said a little bit of Menhera is okay.

246
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,330
Me and Yuris both agree that 30% Menhera is okay.

247
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,410
Wait, what is considered 30%?

248
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,430
How would you know if somebody is 30%?

249
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,470
Okay, but what is 30%?

250
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,930
How can you tell if somebody is 30% Menhera?

251
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,770
Whatever they are is like 31%.

252
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,150
Well, okay, so here's the scale.

253
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,950
If they are at 100%, then you're going to die.

254
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:10,510
If they are at 30%, you're just going to have a little bit of like a little bit of a thriller action in your life.

255
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,870
Like a little bit of thrill every now and then.

256
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,990
What's a thrill?

257
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,090
Like what's the...

258
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,850
Oh, so I will scare for your life every now and then.

259
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,510
You know, like...

260
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,950
Like a little action, you know?

261
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,390
It sounds like you speak from experience.

262
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,490
Like he's at the 30% Menhera.

263
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:28,810
No, I wouldn't know.

264
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:28,810
I wouldn't know.

265
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,530
Okay, but like what tips it over the edge?

266
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,510
What makes it a 31% Menhera versus a 30%?

267
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,530
Wait, but then getting stabbed...

268
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,810
But 100% you die, so like...

269
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,190
Not every stabbing equals in death.

270
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:43,710
You know that.

271
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,950
How can you know?

272
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:45,770
How can you know?

273
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,650
When you get stabbed in your leg.

274
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,370
Well, you can have blood just pour out.

275
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,390
What do you get an infection?

276
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,590
What if you get like...

277
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,850
What if it's like a rusty knife?

278
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,510
But that's...

279
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,130
Then that's...

280
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,650
That's over 30% then.

281
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,570
That's too far.

282
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,070
But like, you didn't know...

283
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,770
You don't like...

284
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,490
What if it was an accident, you know?

285
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,510
Like she was just going over to clean the knife because it was getting rusty.

286
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,830
She was going to unrest it.

287
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,590
She tripped and then the knife...

288
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,030
She stabbed you in the leg?

289
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,130
Yeah, she tripped and then...

290
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,670
Yeah, but that's not Menhera.

291
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,470
That's an accident.

292
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,170
Menhera is like...

293
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,910
Yeah, but the Menhera part is that she's carrying a rusty knife around.

294
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,330
She was going to go clean it though.

295
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,710
Yeah, but the same part was to just throw it away.

296
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,130
So she threw it away to me?

297
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,070
Yeah.

298
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,210
Oh, hey, okay.

299
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,370
We got where we land.

300
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:36,710
Okay.

301
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,050
I'll go this side.

302
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,890
I'm sure chat agrees with me and that's all I need.

303
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,450
Wait, is that siphon?

304
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,690
Okay, this is siphon.

305
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,590
It's been a while, guys.

306
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,330
Listen, I'm going to go...

307
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,770
I'm going to go far.

308
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,130
I'm going to go all the way.

309
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,270
Why are you going all the way away from us?

310
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,370
No one's going to contest us.

311
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:57,570
He hates us, Ditto.

312
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,470
He hates us.

313
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,490
He doesn't want to be near us.

314
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,070
No, this is for efficiency.

315
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,750
He doesn't want to be near us.

316
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,630
He hates us.

317
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:02,810
Okay.

318
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,450
Okay, I understand.

319
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,710
I see.

320
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,250
That's sad.

321
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,830
Yeah.

322
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,110
Do you think we're Menheras?

323
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:09,910
I think he hates us.

324
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,750
You guys are yandere.

325
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,730
That's where the fuck you are.

326
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,410
We are not.

327
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,070
Yeah, how?

328
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,730
We are yandere.

329
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,390
We are yandere.

330
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:17,990
Yeah.

331
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,510
How?

332
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,530
I have never killed anyone.

333
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,370
How?

334
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,110
What is it?

335
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:23,930
Like, you know how.

336
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,130
No, I don't.

337
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,750
What?

338
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,290
Like...

339
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,930
If I knew, I wouldn't ask.

340
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,050
You don't need to explain myself.

341
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,830
Stop the cap.

342
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,290
Oh, man.

343
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,010
Oh, boy.

344
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,690
Oh, what did I say?

345
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,950
I think Ditto and I are perfectly normal girls.

346
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,310
Absolutely.

348
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,890
Yeah.

349
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,870
We're so normal.

350
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,690
Right, Ditto?

351
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,250
Yeah.

352
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,750
Nothing but normalcy.

353
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,210
Yeah.

354
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,090
We're normal.

355
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:49,390
These parts.

356
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,810
I think you're the freak here.

357
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,710
If I make a poll right now, people will think you're the freak.

358
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,270
No, I think Chad probably agrees.

359
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,790
He agrees with me.

360
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,690
Like, they probably say that 30% Menhera is an adequate amount of Menhera.

361
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,770
We're not talking about that.

362
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,810
I'm talking about a poll of whether or not you're more Menhera than us.

363
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,310
Oh, no.

364
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,790
Chad knows I'm the only sane person in this Discord.

365
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,250
You want to bet?

366
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:12,830
How much?

367
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,030
I don't have money.

368
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,890
Like, you're going to make a poor streamer?

369
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,630
You're going to steal money from a poor streamer?

370
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,970
Yes.

371
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,550
To prove a point.

372
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,030
You're a psychopath.

373
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,950
You're a psychopath.

374
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,170
No, I'm not a psychopath.

375
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,570
I just proved my point.

376
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,030
I'm here to prove a point that you are wrong.

377
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,270
I'm here to prove a point that you are wrong.

378
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,770
I am correctness.

379
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,690
You are correctness.

380
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,130
Okay.

381
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,530
I need that.

382
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,330
I am correctness.

383
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,850
I'm going to need that.

384
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,170
Nice.

385
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,610
What's the zone looking like?

386
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:44,950
I feel like a scope.

387
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,230
I don't know, IGL.

388
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,210
What is the zone?

389
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,630
I mean, we have the... we could have a people's ring here.

390
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,670
Okay.

391
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,170
Yeah, we don't...

392
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,230
Okay, we do.

393
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,090
I will scan the...

394
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,250
Okay.

395
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,790
Yeah, scan the ring.

396
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,490
Yeah, go hit the bacon.

397
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,470
Hit the bacon.

398
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,090
Okay.

399
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,490
Oh, we all have purple.

400
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,010
I have Mozambique Spitfire.

401
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,070
This is not very cash money.

402
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,630
IGL, why can't you find better guns, IGL?

403
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,510
I'm going to drop this Mozambique and take the Sentinel and bully this entire lobby.

404
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,490
Okay.

405
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,090
What are you going to die?

406
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,890
I don't die.

407
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,250
It doesn't happen to me.

408
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,350
Okay.

409
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,150
What happened in the last ALGS you were playing?

410
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,250
I was playing...

411
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:27,570
I tried to...

412
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,470
Then I died because of that.

413
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,130
Okay, where do we go?

414
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,370
We need... we need old charger.

415
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,810
We need the army.

416
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,310
You take the Evo.

417
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,550
Ditto takes the Evo and then he goes zone.

418
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,910
Okay, we're in zone.

419
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,350
Okay.

420
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,690
And now I take this Evo.

421
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,570
Okay.

422
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:47,790
Oh, okay.

423
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,090
Okay.

424
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,790
We're going to head to RPR.

425
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,550
You press the M on your map, on your fucking keyboard.

426
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,470
Yeah, you press M.

427
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,630
Yeah.

428
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,170
And you open map and there's a big circle and we go in the middle of the big circle.

429
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:00,490
Oh, okay.

430
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,430
That's how it works.

431
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,090
I mean, a real Aisya would know exactly where the end zone is, but okay.

432
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,770
No one can read the ring one!

433
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,550
No one!

434
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,590
No Jesus on this planet!

435
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,270
Zero can!

436
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,110
No, he can't.

437
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,670
He's just lying.

438
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,110
Zero can!

439
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,510
He always gets the end zone correct.

440
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,110
Yeah, of ring two, of course he does.

441
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,550
No, he gets it right on ring one!

442
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,910
He's like a savant!

443
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,450
He does not!

444
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,850
Okay, well Zero's cheating!

445
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,950
Like what do you want from me?

446
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,670
I don't cheat!

447
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,510
I play fair and square.

448
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,430
Fair and square.

449
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,510
Yeah, that's why you just pull your V2, Rouge, now.

450
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:40,770
Yeah.

451
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,270
Exactly.

452
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,110
You hear it here, folks?

453
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,770
Our PR says Zero's cheating.

454
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,930
He is.

455
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,170
Do I do a fighting?

456
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,190
Do I get the revive or the reduced tactical?

457
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,830
Revive.

458
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:57,410
Okay.

459
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,850
So if we go down, we go up 20% faster.

460
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,210
Alright.

461
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:06,030
And then the next one, you should probably get the package so we get good stuff.

462
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,050
Someone's aiming at me.

463
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,770
I'm about to murder them.

464
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,370
Where should we go next?

465
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:08,810
Whoa!

466
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,890
I got shot at!

467
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,430
Whoa, whoa, we got shot!

468
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

469
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,010
70 blown catalyst.

470
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,970
Where the fuck are they going, huh?

471
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,850
Okay, I'm gonna port us up the hill.

472
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,910
Okay, we'll wait.

473
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,830
Are they looking at us?

474
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:23,690
Yeah.

475
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,670
Yes, they are, but...

476
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,550
...the gaffers are useless.

477
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,290
Whoa!

478
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,850
Oh, good.

479
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,310
I got the port.

480
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,630
Don't die.

481
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,050
I didn't die, guys.

482
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,790
I only have one bat.

483
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,130
Good job.

484
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,390
Wait, did us not near the port?

485
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

486
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,330
Who do they think they are, huh?

487
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,050
I don't know, but they...

488
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:41,990
I got sand on my hands.

489
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,190
If they kill us, we're fucked.

490
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,210
I did more damage to them than they did to us.

491
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,550
Let's go.

492
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,190
I lost my only bat.

493
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,250
Oh, there's a team on the right.

494
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,930
There's a team on the right.

495
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,870
Oh, yeah.

496
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,290
Close, close, close.

497
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,410
Flash, flash, flash, nice.

498
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,510
I knocked one.

499
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,370
Bangalore 70.

500
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,190
Nice, nice.

501
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,670
Push left, push left, push left.

502
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,470
I hear people, like...

503
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,750
Just keep pushing downhill.

504
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,510
Keep pushing downhill.

505
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,970
I'm walking up there.

506
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,890
Because they're going to get sandwiched, so we got to keep pushing downhill.

507
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,470
I'm pushing, I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

509
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,950
And honestly, kill these motherfuckers.

510
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,750
Who the fuck do they think they are?

511
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,310
I killed one guy.

512
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,050
Yeah, who are they?

513
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,790
Yeah, yeah, kill the rest of these motherfuckers.

514
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,190
Yeah!

515
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,130
Yeah, fuck this Bangalore.

516
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,930
Yeah, we're TSM.

517
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,290
He's low, he's low, he's low, he's low.

518
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,310
Get him, Dito.

519
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:25,850
Get him.

520
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,090
Yeah, get his ass.

521
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,830
Yeah!

522
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,170
Yeah, fuck him up!

523
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,730
Yeah, fuck him up!

524
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,630
Motherfuckers.

525
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,330
Yeah, do a finisher.

526
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:32,810
Do a finisher.

527
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,910
Do a do do do do do do do do it.

528
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,590
I'm going to rip it.

529
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,250
I'm going to rip it.

530
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,830
I'm going to rip it.

531
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,630
I'm going to rip the whole thing.

532
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're going to watch.

533
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,870
We're going to watch.

534
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,770
Yeah, fuck VTubers.

535
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,970
Yeah, fuck VTubers.

536
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,010
What are you doing in this VTuber Apex tournament?

537
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,230
Oh, hey, I need a juice.

538
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,330
Oh my god, they got juice.

539
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,130
I want, I want energy, energy armor.

540
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,290
I got nothing.

541
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,990
I'll give you, I'll give you 60.

542
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,370
I'll give you 60 and then I switch to Bloodline.

543
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,110
I didn't get Q.

544
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,490
Someone's looking at us.

545
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,290
I don't know, maybe a teammate.

546
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,910
Where are we going by the way?

547
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,890
I don't know, but I'm finishing the kill.

548
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,610
There's a kill to finish.

549
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,330
Oh, there he is.

550
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,610
Can I use TK?

551
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,130
Yeah.

552
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,610
Okay.

553
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,510
Let's go home guys.

554
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,370
Now we got to move.

555
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,910
It is...

556
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,090
Oh my god.

557
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,130
This zone is ass.

558
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,510
I need...

559
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,470
Oh, I have a care package that I can call.

560
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,370
Should I call it or wait until I get purple?

561
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,070
No, let's get to like a better spot.

562
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,410
There's a lot of motherfuckers around us.

563
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,210
Yeah.

564
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,130
And I'm not vibing with it.

565
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:25,350
I'm not vibing with it.

566
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,910
Oh, we got scanned on Epi.

567
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,150
And then I don't think those guys are going to fuck with us.

568
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:30,930
Yeah.

569
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,430
They know who we are.

570
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,010
No, I mean, we're not even in their trajectory.

571
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,550
Oh.

572
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:38,850
Yeah.

573
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,290
No, no.

574
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,110
They know who we are.

575
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,010
Yeah.

576
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,390
They have walls.

577
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,070
They can see our names.

578
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,770
I think this is like...

579
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,350
Oh fuck.

580
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,050
This is this zone right here.

581
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,770
Absolute asshole of a zone.

582
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,670
I have read a player.

583
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,330
If you want to use it.

584
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,830
Honestly, yeah, I don't want to walk.

585
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,730
Right here?

586
00:20:59,630 --> 00:20:59,990
Yep.

587
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:00,810
Right here.

588
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,790
All right.

589
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,410
Guys, he's AFK.

590
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,930
Shoot him.

591
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,470
It was all a bait.

592
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,770
I knew the streams that I think.

593
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,270
Wait, none of you guys have redeploy?

594
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,490
I have mobile respawn so we can get D top when she dies.

595
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,230
All right.

596
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,030
Who's going to die first?

597
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,070
I have help for you too.

598
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,610
Yeah.

599
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,030
Yeah.

600
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,850
You can both have.

601
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,650
You got me covered.

602
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,630
I got you covered.

603
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,250
This is so good.

604
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,310
Wait.

605
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,350
Okay, wait.

606
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,910
What about me?

607
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,210
No, we're good.

608
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,010
You don't die.

609
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,290
She don't die.

610
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:29,930
You don't die.

611
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,150
Don't you?

612
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:30,730
I don't die.

613
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,030
Okay.

614
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,310
Yeah.

615
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,910
Yeah.

616
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:32,810
Yeah.

617
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,090
Yeah.

618
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:33,170
Yeah.

619
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,990
See, somebody believes in me.

620
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,590
Liferay never dies.

621
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:36,830
Wait.

622
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,470
I try it.

623
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,450
When do I use my package?

624
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,370
I do.

625
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,810
I'll just use it here.

626
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,510
We're cool.

627
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,450
We're cool here.

628
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,030
Okay.

629
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,150
I'm going to charge my Sentinel.

630
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,850
Now the real game has started.

631
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,490
All right.

632
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,210
About to create for everyone.

633
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,610
Oh, sniper mag.

634
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,170
This package...

635
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,090
Alright, let's get to Joan.

636
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,150
Alright, we're right behind you.

637
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,730
If I read this wrong, it's Zero's fault.

638
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,990
It's Zero's fault!

639
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,530
It wasn't Zero's fault!

640
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,190
I watch him for zone predictions.

641
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,150
You watch him for zone.

642
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,330
Yeah, so if this is wrong, this is his fault.

643
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,690
Yeah, it's Zero.

644
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,870
Oh my god, okay, did it just fucking go into all the batteries?

645
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,110
People here?

646
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,090
You made it?

647
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,310
I have two.

648
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,070
Let's get in this building, we want this building.

649
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,130
Okay, I'll give you two.

650
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,810
Wow, nobody.

651
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,930
Nobody, because they can't read zones!

652
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

653
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,230
They can't read zones like our player Zero.

654
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,530
Thank god Zero is here for us.

655
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,190
Yep, he's such a good guy.

656
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,710
I mean, man, we love DZ.

657
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,630
I cracked that catalyst.

658
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,410
I'm gonna bully that team until they have no more meds.

659
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,270
Wait, I need to turn up Ditto more on my Discord, give me a sec.

660
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,610
I'm AFKing.

661
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,110
No fun, no fun.

662
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,210
I turned Ditto up to 200.

663
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,890
I can't go on.

664
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,570
I cracked two.

665
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,230
She's lying on Discord.

666
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,390
Wait, there's people here on me.

667
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,450
They're purple.

668
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,490
Yeah, this guy's up top as well.

669
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,690
Wait, how are they purple?

670
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,670
They're cheating.

671
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:08,270
Almost got killed.

672
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:08,650
Another one.

673
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,110
Wait, they have purple and we don't?

674
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:11,350
Yeah.

675
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,170
Why are you almost dead?

676
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,010
Explain yourself.

677
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,590
Because I got shot by three fucking people, I explained.

678
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,230
Okay, valid.

679
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,670
Like, oh, why would you get shot by three people?

680
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,910
Oh, Ditto, how did you get shot at, huh?

681
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,610
Like, four team, four team.

682
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,490
Yeah, exactly.

683
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,030
Why is that motherfucker shooting at me?

684
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:29,450
Hello?

685
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,390
Ooh, nice.

686
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,910
See, there's like extra...

687
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,370
Ooh, nice, there's a barrel stablizer.

688
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,090
Wait, Sentinel was such a good choice.

689
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,050
Can bully everyone now.

690
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:39,750
Yeah.

691
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:40,930
Yeah.

692
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,490
Yeah, keep peeking.

693
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,970
See what happens to your head.

694
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,250
Why are you top strafing?

695
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,570
Bro, he wants to show people his movement.

696
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,150
I'm not.

697
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,330
I'm not.

698
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,650
I'm not.

699
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,190
I just hit you on the head, you dumbass head.

700
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:55,730
Yeah, I was gonna be like, what the fuck?

701
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,470
Why are you walking here?

702
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,310
I wanna be part of the team.

703
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,010
Yeah, now my bullet's part of your head.

704
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,150
I wanna contribute to society.

705
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,950
Oh my God, he's flesh.

706
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,710
Oh yeah, that guy got fucking doinked.

707
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,510
I wish you can like farm armors again.

708
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,830
Wait, wait, RP, you should try and get the... get that for us.

709
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,110
He's dead.

710
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,210
He's dead.

711
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,230
He's dead.

712
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,710
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I could port for it, but I could... I mean, who's gonna kill?

713
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,950
Yeah, who's gonna kill you?

714
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,510
That guy might.

715
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,470
Motherfucker.

716
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,670
Okay, I'm not gonna peek anymore.

717
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,410
They have four shields.

718
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,790
I'm about to go crazy.

719
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,250
Wait, you're actually going for it?

720
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,950
You're throwing.

721
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,810
Of course I am.

722
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,070
You're fucking throwing.

723
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,870
What do you mean I'm throwing?

724
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,470
This is juice.

725
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:44,710
My shield's throwing.

726
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,490
Only one there.

727
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,690
It's free juice.

728
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,950
Oh shit, purple.

729
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,810
I knew that was a good... you're welcome.

730
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,230
I just...

731
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,550
I thought I told you to use that idea.

732
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

733
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,030
You're fucking wrong.

734
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,210
You literally just told me I was throwing.

735
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,130
No, I didn't.

736
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,250
Where's your proof?

737
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,510
Can that guy stop looking at me?

738
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,590
He keeps giving me those alerts.

739
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,070
You're being...

740
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,210
Aim it.

741
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,670
I don't care I'm being aimed at.

742
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,830
What are you looking at here, man?

743
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:08,870
Fucking mower.

744
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,910
Okay, I have three shield cells left.

745
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,570
Guys.

746
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,910
What the fuck are you doing?

747
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,230
I wanna continue.

748
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,350
No more peeking for you.

749
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,250
But I wanna peek.

750
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,950
It's not fair.

751
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,950
They're shooting at me.

752
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,230
100.

753
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,170
It's not fair.

754
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,450
Oh, wait.

755
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,090
What's this package?

756
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,170
Oh, a package!

757
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,410
Whoa!

758
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,550
Who wants that?

759
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,410
I do.

760
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,290
I want it.

761
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:34,710
I want it.

762
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,190
I want it.

763
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,110
Where's our portal?

764
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,310
It's outside our building.

765
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,030
Like, you can just jump for this one.

766
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,190
What if I die?

767
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,230
You're not gonna die.

768
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,870
There's no one there.

769
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,910
You're chilling.

770
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,010
But what if I die?

771
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,250
You wouldn't trust me.

772
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,230
There is no one there.

773
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,610
There is gonna be no death involved.

774
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,950
Alright, I'm gonna throw my prowler.

775
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,790
Alright, I'm going for it.

776
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,630
Holy shit, your prowler was juicy.

777
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,190
Yeah, it was.

778
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,190
Okay, I'm going for it.

779
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,430
There's gonna be no death involved, unless you die.

780
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,830
I'm going for it, I'm going for it, I'm going for it.

781
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,990
I gotta get us to the next spot.

782
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,590
I got a dead slide.

783
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,930
Okay, we're gonna go there now.

784
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,330
Why is this guy looking at me?

785
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,190
I have a purple barrel stabilizer, does anyone want it?

786
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,090
No, I'm just gonna go there and secure this spot.

787
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:23,690
Okay.

788
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,510
Here's a...

789
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,130
Oh, I got the next lifeline package.

790
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,770
And we're gonna keep going forward.

791
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,250
I knocked one.

792
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,590
What do you mean you knocked one?

793
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,610
You cracked someone.

794
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,270
Stop knocking people.

795
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,470
I... I thirsted him.

796
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,410
She keeps knocking people.

797
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,290
Like, what the fuck.

798
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,130
Alright, next spot.

799
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,030
We're going to the next spot.

800
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,090
Hey guys, I have...

801
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,850
Yeah, it's my fault that you're lying.

802
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,470
I'm getting pushed, I'm getting pushed.

803
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,650
Wait, wait, come back in, come back to our side.

804
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,050
I almost killed two of them.

805
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,610
Come back, come back, come back.

806
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,310
I have a phoenix kit for you.

807
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,890
We need to stop these motherfuckers.

808
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,730
We're taking our house.

809
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,090
We gotta kill these motherfuckers.

810
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,190
I cracked them though.

811
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,110
This is disrespectful behavior.

812
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,810
They took it, they had catalyst.

813
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,410
Kill them now!

814
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,210
They catalysted.

815
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,890
I'm not gonna play anymore unless we kill these guys.

816
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,730
Okay, go, go, go.

817
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,250
You go first.

818
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:24,610
Okay.

819
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,490
Wait, are we actually doing it?

820
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,910
Wait, I'm getting shot.

821
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,630
Are we doing it?

822
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,770
Yeah, as soon as I...

823
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,510
I have no shield cells, guys.

824
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,490
You guys have extra shield cells.

825
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,610
Oh, okay, nice.

826
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,190
See, I told you we shouldn't have gone for it.

827
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,290
What is that wall?

828
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,450
Does anyone have extra shield cells?

829
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,290
I only have bats.

830
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,070
Who the fuck plays Newcastle?

831
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,130
Are you guys okay in the head?

832
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:49,730
I have G.

833
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,670
I can give you one.

834
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,950
Yeah, I'll give you a bat for it.

835
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,450
Nice.

836
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,990
Ow, dumbass.

837
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,030
I'm gonna go above.

838
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:58,790
Okay.

839
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,010
So I can get a better angle.

840
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,510
I'm gonna look over here.

841
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,630
I'm gonna put us probably over there.

842
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,730
Guys, we're not even top 10.

843
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,750
Why aren't we top 10?

844
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,450
Because people are not dying faster than we are.

845
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,870
Wait for the main thing.

846
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,930
Tell them to die faster.

847
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,250
I'm actually working on it.

848
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,870
I was about to eliminate that team, but you guys didn't come.

849
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,790
I did.

850
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,590
I did.

851
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,570
I was like, I'm ready.

852
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,510
I'm not.

853
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,570
Oh, they're fighting on here.

854
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,250
Murder, murder.

855
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,390
I got murder on my mind.

856
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,570
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

857
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,250
Down here, down here.

858
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,570
I'm straight beaming.

859
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,270
I'm coming over.

860
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,110
I got 15% and I'm about to start porting us to a better spot.

861
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,710
These motherfuckers over here cannot take our spot.

862
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,270
I will fight them to death.

863
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,050
Wait, I'm getting shot at.

864
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,590
How dare he?

865
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,270
I have no cells.

866
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,130
Up here.

867
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,610
5%, 3%.

868
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,330
Where are you?

869
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,750
Here, 3 cells.

870
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,430
Stop peeking.

871
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,150
I'm going to peek because I have a bat.

872
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,370
I gave you a bat as well.

873
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,430
We need to go and I'm going to get us to the spot that we need to go to.

874
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,810
We're so poor.

875
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,630
Get it up here.

876
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,270
He's so low.

877
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,930
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

878
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,150
On me.

879
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,290
Take the port, take the port.

880
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,210
I'm taking the port.

881
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,710
I'm in the port.

882
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,450
We play here.

883
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,350
We play safety here.

884
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:15,850
This corner.

885
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,290
We're going to get pushed from there.

886
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:17,990
And everywhere.

887
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,350
I have a package.

888
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,630
I'll put a package right here.

889
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:22,710
Put a package for cover.

890
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,250
Perfect.

891
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,150
I'm charging my sentinel even though we don't have cells.

892
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,430
Even though we don't have cells, I'm charging my sentinel.

893
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,210
I don't give a fuck.

894
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,750
I have more bats for us.

895
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,590
Here guys, guys.

896
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,010
Take this, take that.

897
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,810
Take the evil cache.

898
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:38,910
I'm going to scan.

899
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,490
I'm going to scan.

900
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,250
Take the evil cache guys.

901
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,510
I'll take it.

902
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,130
I took it.

903
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,590
Look at that.

904
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,270
Why did you take it?

905
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,610
Because I'm lifeline.

906
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,390
I don't need it.

907
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:53,730
I'm lifeline.

908
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,050
I don't need the work.

909
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,810
I knocked him on the roof.

910
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:00,870
There's no way we can finish him.

911
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,370
I think they're going to find each other.

912
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,310
They're going to come.

913
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,230
There's people behind us by the way.

914
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:07,970
I missed.

915
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,910
I'm looking at the team behind us.

916
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,370
I missed.

917
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,390
Holy shit.

918
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,590
It's bugged.

919
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,330
The game is bugged.

920
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,510
There's no way I missed this much.

921
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,190
There's team here too.

922
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:16,650
I'm ready to left.

923
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,010
I think they're on the other side of the wall.

924
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,470
There's teams here too.

925
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,570
I hear them on the wall.

926
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:25,870
Whoa.

927
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,730
I'm batting.

928
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,270
Holy shit.

929
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,570
There's a lot of people on our right here.

930
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,050
I knocked one.

931
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,010
Everyone stay away from my area.

932
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:34,790
Okay, I'm sorry.

933
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,810
I'm scared guys.

934
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,970
We're going to kill everyone.

935
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:40,910
We're going to kill everyone.

936
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,090
They're dying.

937
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:43,870
Chill.

938
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,910
Take it easy.

939
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,390
Don't be queasy.

940
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,950
Right on me.

941
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:48,870
Nice.

942
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,730
I'm batting.

943
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,070
There's more fighting down here.

944
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,750
They killed the team.

945
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,610
Behind us.

946
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,570
Here.

947
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,150
We need to focus this team.

948
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,630
No, this team on the north-east.

949
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,410
Yeah, Ditto.

950
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,030
Be careful.

951
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,530
There's three of them.

952
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,590
Who are you fighting, Ducky?

953
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,730
People behind us.

954
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,410
He's dead.

955
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,210
I'm looking at Ditto.

956
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,770
Ditto's got the right idea.

957
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:19,870
I'm here.

958
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,850
Crack one.

959
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,410
I'm dead.

960
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:26,890
Oh my god.

961
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,930
I'm the motherfucking best.

962
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,490
Dead.

963
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,670
All dead.

964
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,630
Fuck VTubers.

965
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,610
I'm batting.

966
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,670
Guys, this might be the most chaotic game.

967
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,610
And I have no idea what's going on.

968
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,070
They're fighting.

969
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,390
They're fighting each other.

970
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,710
Let them fight.

971
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,670
Don't let them know that we exist.

972
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:45,490
Okay.

973
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,470
We don't exist right now.

974
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:47,870
Can I poke?

975
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,770
I'm poking.

976
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,850
They're so low though.

977
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,550
Oh my god.

978
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:52,950
Kill everyone.

979
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,730
This is so exciting.

980
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,650
I kept one.

981
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,210
I'm so pumped right now.

982
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,910
Guys, we're doing it.

983
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,530
This is so chaotic.

984
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,330
Why are you shooting at me?

985
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,570
Focus on the guy in your building.

986
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,950
I am batting.

987
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,370
There's one team below, one team above.

988
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,270
And me getting an angle right now.

989
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,990
And murdering.

990
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,250
I'm healing.

991
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,510
Fuck this guy's door.

992
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,990
If you have a nade, fuck this guy's door.

993
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,330
Okay.

994
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,070
I'm gonna do it.

995
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,630
Do it.

996
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,250
Fuck his door.

997
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,410
Fuck this door.

998
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:23,950
Fuck his door.

999
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,910
Get door, fuck idiot.

1000
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,350
I don't have nades anymore, guys.

1001
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,830
I missed.

1002
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,030
I missed.

1003
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:30,750
He's shooting.

1004
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,990
Oh no.

1005
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,450
Oh no.

1006
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:34,970
88.

1007
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,130
Oh no.

1008
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,270
I'm lucky.

1009
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,590
Kill that bull.

1010
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,250
Oh, they're fucking each other.

1011
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:40,930
Yeah.

1012
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,970
They're rezzing.

1013
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,970
They're rezzing with gold knock.

1014
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,570
Throw nades.

1015
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,290
Throw nades at them.

1016
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,930
I don't have nades.

1017
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,350
Why are you pushing so close?

1018
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,330
Because I'm crazy.

1019
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:50,730
You're crazy.

1020
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,250
I love it.

1021
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:51,550
That's good.

1022
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,870
He goes to Asta.

1023
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,690
He goes to Asta.

1024
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,330
Yeah.

1025
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,070
He's won.

1026
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,430
He's won.

1027
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:58,930
Yeah.

1028
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:58,990
Yeah.

1029
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:00,830
TSM.

1030
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:01,850
TSM.

1031
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,790
TSM.

1032
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,670
TSM.

1033
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,110
TSM.

1034
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:04,670
TSM.

1035
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:04,890
TSM.

1036
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,030
TSM.

1037
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,430
Oh my god.

1038
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:09,830
Thank you.

1039
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,710
What is like a TSM copypasta?

1040
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,730
What is like a TSM copypasta?

1041
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,050
That's right.

1042
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,690
We're replacing Hal.

1043
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,150
Do I have like 200 things?

1044
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,070
Do I have like 200 things?

1045
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,110
Damn.

1046
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,030
We're just better.

1047
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,130
I did fuck all that game.

1048
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,970
I wasn't even playing.

1049
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,970
I was barely there.

1050
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,070
I was barely there.

1051
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,550
Told you.

1052
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,890
We don't...

1053
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,830
We're so good.

1054
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,090
We're going to be rezzing.

1055
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,510
Yeah.

1056
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,310
It's just it's over.

1057
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,370
We know how this game is going to go.

1058
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:50,730
Yeah.

1059
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,390
I mean honestly like...

1060
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:52,650
Oh wait.

1061
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,190
Team Slyly Manjaro.

1062
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,070
That's our name.

1063
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,050
Team Slyly.

1064
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:56,650
Hahaha.

1065
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,290
We're team Slyly Manjaro.

1066
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,430
We're team Slyly Manjaro.

1067
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:02,970
Yeah.

1068
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,370
Honestly I vote for that.

1069
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,390
Team Slyly Manjaro.

1070
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,190
Because this game is going to put me in an early blow.

1071
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,140
I'm going to name myself Imperial RPR.

1072
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,210
Imperial RPR.

1073
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,970
Oh my god.

1074
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,770
I'll name myself Doki Reps.

1075
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,710
And then...

1076
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,690
Just be Depps.

1077
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,750
And their host.

1078
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,430
Hahaha.

1079
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,190
Their host.

1080
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,790
Hahaha.

1081
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,330
It's over for everyone in this lobby.

1082
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,430
TSM is here.

1083
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,330
We're reppi... Oh my god.

1084
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:37,930
Depps.

1085
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,930
We had 13 kills.

1086
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,210
How did we get 13 kills?

1087
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,610
I feel like we did nothing all day.

1088
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,450
To be fair I don't know what we were doing.

1089
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,790
I was so confused this entire game.

1090
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,630
I only shoot and straight.

1091
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,210
Yeah.

1092
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,330
We're just shooting.

1093
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,150
Hahaha.

1094
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,170
Oh my god.

1095
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,850
I'm Depps.

1096
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,590
Let's go.

1097
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,030
Their host.

1098
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,510
Imperial RPR.

1099
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:02,650
Hahaha.

1100
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,450
Hahaha.

1101
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:05,990
We're back.

1102
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,810
TSM is back guys.

1103
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:08,730
Hahaha.

1104
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,450
We're going to win the trophy.

1105
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,230
TSM on top.

1106
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,230
On god.

1107
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,010
Hahaha.

1108
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,910
Hey.

1109
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,970
I told you.

1110
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,850
I didn't watch Zero's watch.

1111
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,290
Yeah.

1112
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:24,770
I see.

1113
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,030
You know I dedicate this win to Zero.

1114
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,210
Oh my god.

1115
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,910
Like he didn't have enough.

1116
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,590
Hahaha.

1117
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:33,830
Hahaha.

1118
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,270
He needs it.

1119
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:37,990
Hahaha.

1120
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,570
He needs a third trophy.

1121
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,470
Give him another one.

1122
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,330
Give him another one.

1123
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,510
He was so sad.

1124
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,010
See how sad he was.

1125
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,750
It made me feel so bad when he didn't win.

1126
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,990
Hahaha.

1127
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,870
Yeah but like RC won.

1128
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,490
And Ditto is on RC.

1129
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:55,730
Oh true.

1130
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,130
Ditto is on RC.

1131
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,970
So we have world champion in our team.

1132
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,990
We can't lose this tournament.

1133
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:03,590
Oh my god.

1134
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,550
We have TSM, RC, and Dark Zero on our team.

1135
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,290
Holy shit.

1136
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:09,890
Yeah.

1137
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,150
Dark Zero is RPR.

1138
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,070
I'm TSM.

1139
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,610
And then Ditto is RC.

1140
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,250
We literally have the full championship lobby.

1141
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:18,930
Hahaha.

1142
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,310
It's over.

1143
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,770
We have so many trophies.

1144
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,330
It's over.

1145
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,890
It's over for everybody.

1146
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,730
They should just uninstall right now.

1147
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,930
Just end the scrims early.

1148
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,190
We can already see how it's going to end.

1149
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,690
I've trolled this entire game.

1150
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,630
And we won.

1151
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,070
Hahaha.

1152
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,090
Bro you did a fucking finisher.

1153
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:41,890
Hahaha.

1154
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,210
Hahaha.

1155
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,590
Hahaha.

1156
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,090
I've been playing Flatline, Sentinel.

1157
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,110
Hahaha.

1158
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,990
Ditto and I were so confused.

1159
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,670
Hahaha.

1160
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,930
That last fight.

1161
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,490
Like in the fight right before the last fight.

1162
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,490
I jumped in and no scoped the revenant for 88.

1163
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,810
I think like all three of us were fighting different teams.

1164
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:05,430
Hahaha.

1165
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,650
We were all fighting different teams during the last fight.

1166
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,430
Hahaha.

1167
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,090
This is the most unserious I've ever been in my life.

1168
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,050
Like what's going to happen next?

1169
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,430
Hahaha.

1170
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,930
We're going to do serious shit.

1171
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,690
Hahaha.

1172
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,210
To be fair, the full lobby might be a bit more serious.

1173
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,190
Hahaha.

1174
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,850
I was just no scoping people.

1175
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,690
I was trolling so hard.

1176
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,290
Like who the fuck plays Flatline Sentinel?

1177
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:30,810
Hahaha.

1178
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,370
It's you.

1179
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,830
You're metacrafting.

1180
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,310
I'm frontlining with a sentinel.

1181
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,730
I'm porting in no scoping people.

1182
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,270
Hahaha.

1183
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,070
This is the strat guys.

1184
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,110
If you're not doing that shit, you're not winning LAN.

1185
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,110
Exactly guys.

1186
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,070
Guys, this is it.

1187
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,730
That's what RC did.

1188
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,190
RC brought a sentinel in.

1189
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,230
Right Ditto?

1190
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,510
Yes.

1191
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,050
Ditto, give us some RC strats.

1192
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,290
How did they do it?

1193
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,190
How did they win LAN?

1194
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,030
Because...

1195
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,870
Because I'm the fourth player.

1196
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,690
Hahaha.

1197
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,910
The fourth player?

1198
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,250
Should they cheat it?

1199
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,690
Should they cheat it?

1200
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,470
Are you watching?

1201
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,730
Destroyer?

1202
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,010
Are you Destroyer?

1203
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,130
Actually, I won with TN Clash and we got champion.

1204
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,850
Oh, that's true.

1205
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,650
This is it.

1206
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,250
Fourth player, no way.

1207
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,630
We might actually lose a few games to not show them our true power.

1208
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,550
That's true.

1209
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,490
Hahaha.

1210
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,750
And then we fuck them up on Saturday.

1211
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:36,990
Hahaha.

1212
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:37,410
Hahaha.

1213
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,350
We should have asked who did we...

1214
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,450
Who got finished by ARVR?

1215
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,310
Hahaha.

1216
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,290
Hahaha.

1217
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,110
How did you finish?

1218
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,570
Yeah, who did we finish anyway?

1219
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,290
Hahaha.

1220
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,450
I wonder if anybody's gonna...

1221
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,670
Oh, it was...

1222
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,550
In the...

1223
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,170
What was it?

1224
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,010
In the city.

1225
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:02,850
Oh.

1226
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,290
Hahaha.

1227
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,330
Oh, they're both...

1228
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,510
Oh yeah, they're both cities.

1229
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,930
I guess we'll never know.

1230
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,330
They're too embarrassed to admit it.

1231
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,460
Who's even the best team?

1232
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,340
The second best team.

1233
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,960
I guess like the... Team 3?

1234
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,660
Team 3 has 10 kills.

1235
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,740
Who's in Team 3?

1236
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,680
Team 3.

1237
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,280
This person is not gonna admit I finished him.

1238
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,880
Come on!

1239
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,100
Give me the juice!

1240
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,820
Give me the juice!

1241
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,960
Chad!

1242
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,280
Stream snipe for us!

1243
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,060
Ghost for us!

1244
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,760
Who was it?

1245
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,520
There's no stream tonight.

1246
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,160
I wish it wasn't me.

1247
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,380
I wish it wasn't me.

1248
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,140
Hahaha.

1249
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,240
Hahaha.

1250
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
This person said, I wish it was me.

1251
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,920
Hahaha.

1252
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,540
Someone said it was Nia's team.

1253
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,060
Hahaha.

1254
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,660
That's why she's not speaking up.

1255
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,300
Hahaha.

1256
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,020
Hahaha.

1257
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,400
She's not gonna give me the win.

1258
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,080
Hahaha.

1259
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,640
Just look at her vibe.

1260
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,480
Hahaha.

1261
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,080
There's no stream delay.

1262
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,900
Hahaha.

1263
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,460
Did I finish Nia exactly?

1264
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,260
Dude, I hope I did.

1265
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,680
For free?

1266
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,220
Oh my god, you're giving finishers for free, RPR?

1267
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,600
No, there's no way I finished Nia, right?

1268
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,100
Hahaha.

1269
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:33,780
Hahaha.

1270
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,080
How much would you charge?

1271
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,540
Holy, why is the plane so loud?

1272
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,100
Alright.

1273
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,840
RPR, you're a jump master.

1274
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,260
Yes.

1275
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,580
Okay, listen.

1276
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,480
One person lands on this building.

1277
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,400
One on this building.

1278
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,060
One on this building.

1279
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,200
Then we loot towards this building.

1280
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,820
Okay, I call this building.

1281
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,640
You go there.

1282
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,440
I go here.

1283
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,920
Where am I going?

1284
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,480
You have to open this one.

1285
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,160
Hold up.

1286
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,280
Left, middle, right.

1287
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,300
Not this one.

1288
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,260
Left, middle, right.

1289
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:04,620
I'm going here.

1290
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,860
I'm going right side.

1291
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,140
You're going right side?

1292
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1293
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,580
Cause I'm in middle.

1294
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,260
I'm in middle.

1295
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,780
Okay, okay.

1296
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,600
Oh my god.

1297
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,380
This team is over.

1298
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:15,980
What do you mean?

1299
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,500
We got first.

1300
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,100
We got first.

1301
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,200
The moment we win the second game, nobody's gonna catch up to us.

1302
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,780
There's no way.

1303
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,220
We can't fuck around if we win two games in a row.

1304
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,200
No, but like if we don't win, we make it intense on purpose.

1305
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,680
But why?

1306
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,040
So they think they have a chance and then you destroy them.

1307
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,700
No, but if they think they don't have a chance, they'll give up.

1308
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,500
And then it'll be even easier on Saturday.

1309
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,600
Yeah, but like look.

1310
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,780
Imagine how much more soul crushing is thinking you have a chance.

1311
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,960
That's actually fucked up.

1312
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,900
We made them move and we showed them that they never really had a chance to begin with.

1313
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah.

1314
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,240
I'm here to ruin dreams early.

1315
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,340
I might be a sadist.

1316
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,120
I might be an ass, not an ass.

1317
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,580
Yeah, I'm gonna say that's pretty fucked up.

1318
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,560
I might be swinging the other way.

1319
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,760
Oh my boy.

1320
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,500
So he is Minhera.

1321
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,440
Oh my god, you are Minhera!

1322
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,280
I told you I'm getting there.

1323
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,320
Yeah, nice, nice.

1324
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,160
Let's go.

1325
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,100
Team slightly Minhera.

1326
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,960
Team slightly Minhera, let's fucking go.

1327
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,020
I'm gonna run double energy.

1328
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,380
That's how serious I am.

1329
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,800
Nah, it's time for new era RPR.

1330
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,740
No more getting bullied.

1331
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,480
Now I'm bullying.

1332
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,080
Stand in line.

1333
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,240
Who's next?

1334
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,640
You can only bully people who are not in the voice chat.

1335
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,860
That's sad.

1336
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,420
You're on my team.

1337
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,160
You want me to bully people.

1338
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,760
This is for the benefit of us.

1339
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,660
I have...

1340
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,060
I have a turbo Havoc.

1341
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,380
I have a turbo Havoc.

1342
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,960
Oh, we're scanned by a beacon.

1343
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,960
Oh, it was a long shot.

1344
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,980
I need a scopa.

1345
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,040
I would like these.

1346
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:02,740
Yeah.

1347
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,340
We need a backpack.

1348
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,220
These backpacks are all ass.

1349
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,600
I ain't carrying shit.

1350
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,100
I ain't carrying shit.

1351
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,680
Yay!

1352
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,260
I need massive.

1353
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,080
Massive?

1354
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,800
Oh, I got a...

1355
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,620
I have a ball for you.

1356
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,880
I have already...

1357
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,020
Alright, listen to me.

1358
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,100
We're going to move now.

1359
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,340
We're going to where?

1360
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,520
I'm ready.

1361
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,080
Monument.

1362
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:28,940
Fragment.

1363
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,840
Monument, okay.

1364
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,360
We ought redeploys.

1365
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,760
Oh my god, gold PK.

1366
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,140
Alright.

1367
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,660
Yeah, I found one this time.

1368
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,520
Hey guys.

1369
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,080
I might run out of energy soon.

1370
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,080
Last time we walked here, there was a team on our right trying to shoot us.

1371
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,460
Yeah, but we'll shoot back.

1372
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,460
We end their game quickly.

1373
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,280
Yeah, yeah.

1374
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,540
We're going to make them uninstall.

1375
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,640
They won't even show up on Saturday.

1376
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,700
Holy shit!

1377
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,380
Yeah, I'm in my psycho era.

1378
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:03,920
It's over.

1379
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,720
It's over for everyone.

1380
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,560
Three times.

1381
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,440
I'm in my psycho era.

1382
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,280
Oh my god.

1383
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,260
He's 14 severe manhara and all it took was one game.

1384
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,780
One game.

1385
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,380
We keep winning.

1386
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,420
It's going to keep going up.

1387
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,620
The more we win, the crazier we get.

1388
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,320
Our power levels increase.

1389
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:32,940
Let's go.

1390
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,240
Let's go.

1391
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,660
Alright.

1392
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,100
Oh, we go up.

1393
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,180
Oh, he's following you.

1394
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,220
Yeah, I was going to bet.

1395
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,060
Why he's scared?

1396
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,360
He's scanning us.

1397
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,120
Now he has to die.

1398
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,960
Kill him.

1399
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,740
Kill him.

1400
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,120
Stab him.

1401
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,840
Why are you looking at us?

1402
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,100
Do you want to go?

1403
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,520
Yeah, we should kill him.

1404
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,260
Now this guy is going to die next.

1405
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,300
Who are we killing first?

1406
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,220
Right or left?

1407
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,720
I can't figure it out right now.

1408
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,540
I'm thinking.

1409
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,020
Oh my god, guys.

1410
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,780
He's actually thinking.

1411
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,860
I don't know, but someone's going to die.

1412
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,560
I know that much.

1413
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,620
Someone's dying.

1414
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,200
Who?

1415
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,880
Where should we go?

1416
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,920
We're going straight in the middle.

1417
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:12,900
Okay.

1418
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,080
It's probably not a fragment zone.

1419
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,900
What zone would it be?

1420
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,920
It's probably this zone up here.

1421
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,480
Then we should head over there, right?

1422
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,680
I want to go scan there.

1423
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,160
Yeah, but let's scan to see how many people are around us.

1424
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:29,980
Okay.

1425
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,200
Okay.

1426
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,620
I'm right behind you.

1427
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:33,960
Maybe the north.

1428
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,300
Yay!

1429
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,300
We should have hit the old charger on the right.

1430
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,660
We just walked by it like a bunch of dumbasses.

1431
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,380
We really just did all that.

1432
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,360
We don't need it.

1433
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,460
We don't need it.

1434
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,200
Yeah, we don't need that.

1435
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:50,640
You're right.

1436
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,060
We're so much better.

1437
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,700
I can call a package soon.

1438
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,860
Or I can call it now.

1439
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,820
Put it on the roof.

1440
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,160
While Deto is scanning.

1441
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,700
There's a PK here.

1442
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,000
Put it on the roof next to you.

1443
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,080
That's your cover.

1444
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,520
That's not what I'm giving.

1445
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,320
I see dead people.

1446
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,340
I see dead people.

1447
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,400
Only one team here.

1448
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,460
Yeah, only one team.

1449
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,260
Oh no, they died.

1450
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:15,760
Let's go.

1451
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,820
Wait, I think this one might be there.

1452
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,480
Because everyone is going there.

1453
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,740
Okay, yeah.

1454
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,720
Wait, you're right.

1455
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,120
This guy's died.

1456
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,180
Let's go.

1457
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,260
I'm right here behind you, RPR.

1458
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,900
What if they shoot back?

1459
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,980
They have Crypto.

1460
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,120
There's no way these guys can shoot back.

1461
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,320
That's fucked up.

1462
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,080
Yeah, but it's true.

1463
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,140
I see them.

1464
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,320
They're...

1465
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,480
They have blue armor just like us.

1466
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:48,960
Okay, end.

1467
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,860
Yeah, blue armor.

1468
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,260
They're on blue armor.

1469
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,600
What are we scared?

1470
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,100
We just won a game.

1471
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:56,860
What are we scared of?

1472
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,840
Blue armor.

1473
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,720
That guy was hit 109.

1474
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,780
The Caustic.

1475
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,620
I got detected by the drone.

1476
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,640
I put him on life support.

1477
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,300
Knock, knock, knock.

1478
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:07,940
What are we scared of?

1479
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,260
They're not.

1480
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,140
Come climb with me on the side here.

1481
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,060
Me too, I'm climbing.

1482
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,580
I fucked up the climb.

1483
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,500
I forgot how to climb this.

1484
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,720
They threw a Caustic all on me.

1485
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,680
I'm gonna port you guys.

1486
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,020
Come here.

1487
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,660
Okay, I'm waiting.

1488
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,140
It's on my side.

1489
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,640
Guys, why did they throw a Caustic?

1490
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,720
They threw a Caustic on me.

1491
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,360
I can't do anything.

1492
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,120
Ditto, you go to the port.

1493
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:32,740
I'm gonna climb.

1494
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:33,860
Okay.

1495
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,120
Guys, I got it.

1496
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,120
You tried to climb there 14 times.

1497
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,680
I got out.

1498
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,620
Ditto, we need you to shoot.

1499
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,800
Yeah, break holders.

1500
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,660
How dare they?

1501
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,800
Yeah, I see one guy.

1502
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,860
Don't get fooled.

1503
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,740
They might be cheating.

1504
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,020
They might have anti-wall hack.

1505
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,780
Okay, we're gonna sandwich them.

1506
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,600
Wait, it's just one guy.

1507
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,460
Where's his teammate?

1508
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,760
No, his teammate is in the corner.

1509
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:06,880
He is?

1510
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,840
Where the fuck is his teammate?

1511
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,240
There's just two guys.

1512
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,420
They never rest?

1513
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,300
Yeah, no, we thirsted him.

1514
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,120
That's a valuable comb that would have been good to me.

1515
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:18,560
That's a valuable comb that would have been good to me.

1516
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:19,920
Don't kill me.

1517
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,220
Oh, John.

1518
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,480
Oh my god, Lifeline player.

1519
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:25,980
Do you guys know?

1520
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,420
TSM, TSM.

1521
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,080
We gotta move.

1522
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,680
There's places we have to be at.

1523
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,200
Who scanned us?

1524
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,060
I don't know.

1525
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,960
You're here.

1526
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,120
Here, here, here.

1527
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,580
Behind us.

1528
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,220
Are they... Nah, we gotta go up the hill.

1529
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,860
We can't be put in this...

1530
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,480
I have redeploy.

1531
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,500
No, no, no, we're walking.

1532
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,300
They're flying.

1533
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,660
Yeah, because like... by the time the redeploy hits...

1534
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,500
They're gonna take the spot.

1535
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,820
I know my timings.

1536
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,360
I watch Zero.

1537
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,760
Yeah, but Zero predicts his zones correctly.

1538
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,540
You didn't predict your zone correctly.

1539
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,540
We won last game, didn't we?

1540
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:10,680
I have...

1541
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,200
And this...

1542
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,960
Look what I pinged and it's in zone.

1543
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:13,860
It's in third zone.

1544
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,360
We're still chilling.

1545
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,220
I have package, guys.

1546
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,480
Oh, hey, bats.

1547
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,600
I have like six bats.

1548
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,020
I'm good.

1549
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,380
I have eight bats.

1550
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,520
Oh, I should take that then.

1551
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,120
Listen, listen, listen.

1552
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,920
I know where this is gonna end and I think we're in an opportune moment to win this game.

1553
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,380
I've gained.

1554
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,400
Where do we go?

1555
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:35,800
Where do we go?

1556
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,020
We stay here.

1557
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,840
We stay here?

1558
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,240
Yeah, we play from this side.

1559
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,120
Everyone's gonna... Listen, everyone right now is thinking, oh my god, I have to get in Cermy camp or I'm never gonna get in the circle.

1560
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,200
But no one is thinking about like there's only 11 squads alive.

1561
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,500
There's no one gonna be on our side of the circle.

1562
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,100
We're just gonna be being chilling all game.

1563
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:53,840
Yay!

1564
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,420
I'm trying to figure out how to climb again.

1565
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,020
Guys, I can't remember.

1566
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:58,660
I can climb!

1567
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,280
Guys, I'm gonna practice parkour, guys.

1568
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,880
Why are you shooting at us, asshole?

1569
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,280
Yeah!

1570
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,440
On top.

1571
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,400
TSM on top.

1572
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,040
Yeah, yeah.

1573
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,360
Guys, I figured it out.

1574
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,740
There's nobody here on this side.

1575
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,440
Oh, so far.

1576
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,120
Oh, no!

1577
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:18,940
I dropped!

1578
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,940
I'm gonna be a mountain goat while you guys farm.

1579
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:22,960
Oh, I'm gonna be a mountain goat while you guys farm.

1580
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,200
Oh, my God!

1581
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,900
I was turning my AC on, asshole!

1582
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,760
Now you gotta die!

1583
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,300
Where are you getting shot at?

1584
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,420
Wait, there's people there.

1585
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,220
Oh, shit!

1586
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,760
Guys!

1587
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,060
Guys!

1588
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,560
Oh!

1589
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,920
I was stuck!

1590
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,740
I was stuck, guys!

1591
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,980
Yeah, I'm going to rez you now.

1592
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:39,820
Are they pushing?

1593
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:40,640
Ditto, cover!

1594
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,780
Are they coming?

1595
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,000
They're coming!

1596
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,320
They're coming!

1597
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,380
Oh, shit.

1598
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,700
On the right!

1599
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,320
You're fine, right?

1600
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,540
I'm gonna bat in front of you guys.

1601
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:51,960
I'm going to die!

1602
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,800
I'm gonna die!

1603
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,160
Guys, I won't blame...

1604
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,300
This is not my fault.

1605
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,700
I was climbing...

1606
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,920
I was climbing, guys.

1607
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:09,280
I will not have you blame me for this one I will not have you blame me for this one when you literally gave them a kill.

1608
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,700
Like, you presented a free opportunity for this thing.

1609
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:13,840
Like, you presented a free opportunity for this thing.

1610
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,000
There is no way I will take blame for this.

1611
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,960
I was climbing a mountain!

1612
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,340
I had no AC on!

1613
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:20,800
All in my bones!

1614
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,460
You just sat on some fucking rock...

1615
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,280
... getting beamed by 3 dudes and you died.

1616
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,180
I mean, like, they had purple armor!

1617
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,380
What was our purple armor?

1618
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,100
Okay, and?

1619
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,260
That's fine, that's fine!

1620
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,940
Because they have 25 health more, does that mean you just died?

1621
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,120
Yeah!

1622
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,220
I couldn't have killed that guy that shot me...

1623
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,620
... if I had full HP.

1624
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,020
If I had purple.

1625
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,420
I would 100% kill him.

1626
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:48,940
Right, Ditto?

1627
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,620
Yeah.

1628
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,260
You know what I'm capable of, Doc?

1629
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,380
You know what I'm capable of that you didn't think of?

1630
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,620
What are you doing?

1631
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,600
I am now going to assess the situation by myself.

1632
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,940
I don't have rewind on.

1633
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:05,640
Fuck.

1634
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,520
I'm going to water you anyway, tomorrow.

1635
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,820
What the fuck is that sound?

1636
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:14,900
What?

1637
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,400
What was that?

1638
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,580
It's from you, Arpio.

1639
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,880
Yeah, what was that?

1640
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,540
We're in an office?

1641
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,640
It's like a silent sound.

1642
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,740
Did you hear the fucking office sound from him?

1643
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,200
Yeah.

1644
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,040
Wait, did you guys hear something?

1645
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,800
Yeah, we heard like a fucking microwave or something.

1646
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,340
Oh, yes.

1647
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:40,760
Yeah.

1648
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,860
I don't know a microwave.

1649
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,080
What the fuck?

1650
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,600
Where was the microwave from?

1651
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,040
What?

1652
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:48,500
What?

1653
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,840
Is something dying?

1654
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,180
Am I dying?

1655
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,120
We heard a microwave sound.

1656
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,060
I was like, beep, beep.

1657
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,140
Yeah, I heard it too.

1658
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,800
Yeah, we heard it.

1659
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,320
Something beeping?

1660
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,240
Am I dying?

1661
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,040
I can't believe it.

1662
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,940
I blame like...

1663
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,940
I think like RPR is actually going... getting Mejera right now.

1664
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,260
I didn't make no sound.

1665
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,440
There was like microwave in like a truck or something.

1666
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,380
He's actually Mejera.

1667
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,420
Oh my God, guys.

1668
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,060
He's actually...

1669
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,300
No, but you're like gaslighting me right now.

1670
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,020
Like there's no way.

1671
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,900
No, but we heard it, Ditto.

1672
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,580
Ditto, you heard it too, right?

1673
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:23,980
Yeah.

1674
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,220
You're on Twitch right now, right?

1675
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,020
Yeah.

1676
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1677
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,400
Clip, clip, clip.

1678
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:27,740
Oh, archive.

1679
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1680
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,900
Get the clip.

1681
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,540
Clip, guys.

1682
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,720
Ditto's chat.

1683
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,360
Get that sound.

1684
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,600
That was so...

1685
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,060
Give me clip.

1686
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,660
Max, you're confused.

1687
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,340
No, we heard it.

1688
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,540
Ditto and I heard it.

1689
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,200
Yeah, we heard it.

1690
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:40,640
Yeah.

1691
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,760
No, no, I get that you heard some shit, but like I'm confused.

1692
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,400
Like what would make a beep sound?

1693
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,040
Like a beep sound in my room.

1694
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,940
Like ghost.

1695
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,540
Unless it's a bomb bomb.

1696
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,540
A fucking ghost.

1697
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,760
Your PC got...

1698
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,360
Your PC got haunted.

1699
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:54,580
A fucking ghost.

1700
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,420
Maybe it's a bomb bomb.

1701
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,180
A bomb bomb.

1702
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,480
Oh my God.

1703
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,320
He is gradually mined.

1704
00:53:59,320 --> 00:53:59,660
This guy is a controller.

1705
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,340
Can we get him banned?

1706
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,140
Which one?

1707
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,180
There's so many.

1708
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,760
Bloodhound.

1709
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,260
No.

1710
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,440
This should have been a PC MNK tournament only.

1711
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,460
I request...

1712
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:09,540
This is bullshit.

1713
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:09,900
Yeah.

1714
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,560
Fuck you guys for playing controller.

1715
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,640
That's the easy way out.

1716
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,800
Oh my God.

1717
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,380
Wait, people are playing controller.

1718
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,560
We're copying our comp now.

1719
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,240
They are.

1720
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:20,840
Of course they are.

1721
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,940
They're copying our comp.

1722
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,720
We're trendsetters.

1723
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,780
We're like innovates.

1724
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,460
Yeah.

1725
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,440
We created this comp.

1726
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,180
ALGS copied us.

1727
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:28,560
Look at this guy cheating.

1728
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,280
He missed Andy.

1729
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,380
Dead.

1730
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,400
Dead.

1731
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,420
Wait, did you have the clip?

1732
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,640
Yo, I don't have the clip.

1733
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,620
Someone claiming.

1734
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,140
Somebody clip, clip, clip, clip.

1735
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,360
We need to...

1736
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,320
We need to find it.

1737
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,020
Mike, listen.

1738
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,840
Do you have a microphone in your room?

1739
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,240
If you have...

1740
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,480
Do you have it?

1741
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,240
No, I don't have even...

1742
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,340
I don't even have a microphone in my house.

1743
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,900
Are there like trucks outside?

1744
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,800
It's 2 AM.

1745
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,840
What the fuck is this truck gonna be at 2 AM?

1746
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,340
Trucks can drive at 2 in the morning.

1747
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,720
What was that song then?

1748
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,220
I live in bug fuck nowhere.

1749
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, trucks can still exist.

1750
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:14,880
Not...

1751
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,000
I have a big garden.

1752
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,480
There's a...

1753
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,220
There's a...

1754
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:17,360
I have a big garden.

1755
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,120
There's a road.

1756
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,320
It's a long while until the road.

1757
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,900
Maybe there's like a truck nearby.

1758
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,700
Like...

1759
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:23,840
Where?

1760
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,700
In my garden?

1761
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,280
Yeah.

1762
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,820
Yeah.

1763
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,580
Maybe it's like a baby truck.

1764
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:35,660
Yeah.

1765
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,040
No.

1766
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,480
That's...

1767
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:37,820
That's...

1768
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:37,900
Yeah.

1769
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,500
That's correct.

1770
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,280
That's the correct one.

1771
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,080
You got it there.

1772
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:42,820
Yeah.

1773
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,360
I knew I was right.

1774
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,160
You got me.

1775
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,660
Oh my god.

1776
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,320
That makes sense.

1777
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,680
Hot trucks in your area.

1778
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,060
Okay, we're too far.

1779
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,240
Ditto, get the clip, Ditto!

1780
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,400
He thinks we're crazy!

1781
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,540
I should say...

1782
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,200
No, I'm not giving the clip.

1783
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,720
Why are you getting the clip?

1784
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,400
Check!

1785
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,880
Okay, someone cut it for me!

1786
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,920
Someone cut it for me.

1787
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,020
Someone clip it, guys!

1788
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,020
We need to prove that we're not crazy and RPR is crazy.

1789
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,700
Did you get the clip?

1790
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,360
Here, here, here.

1791
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,160
Oh, oh!

1792
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,060
Here's the clip.

1793
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,620
I was saying...

1794
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,700
Open chat here.

1795
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,600
Are we putting it in the open chat so everybody can see the...

1796
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,700
Wait, where did you post it?

1797
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,300
Okay, here.

1798
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,040
Hello, I'm back.

1799
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,420
That guy was assassinated.

1800
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,480
Okay, here.

1801
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,080
We got the clip for you, RPR.

1802
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,420
My internet got assassinated by someone.

1803
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,280
This is not fair.

1804
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,200
I got code-net.

1805
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,700
You got code-net?

1806
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,320
No, my whole internet died.

1807
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,180
Your whole internet...

1808
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,280
Someone is targeting me.

1809
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,800
Wait, I'm gonna watch this clip.

1810
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,620
I'm watching this clip too.

1811
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:55,440
Okay.

1812
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,120
There's a sound.

1813
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,340
Yeah, this is the sound I heard!

1814
00:56:59,200 --> 00:56:59,900
What's that?

1815
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,520
Yeah, what the fuck is that?

1816
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,120
This is...

1817
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:05,980
There's a ghost.

1818
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,360
A dog... dog sound.

1819
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:08,940
What is that?

1820
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,860
Yeah!

1821
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,360
Old RPR is scared.

1822
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,120
He...

1823
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:13,840
He...

1824
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,360
He...

1825
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,400
Now he's scared.

1826
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:18,780
Yeah!

1827
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,340
It's from you!

1828
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:21,920
Yeah, it was from...

1829
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,740
Because you didn't hear it, but we heard it.

1830
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,680
Wait, what the fuck is that?

1831
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:25,940
It was from you!

1832
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,900
Guys, it's...

1833
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,120
Yeah.

1834
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,620
It's a bit scary that even he's confused.

1835
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,520
Like...

1836
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,660
No, but like...

1837
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,780
It's a little worried.

1838
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,440
Nothing...

1839
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,320
Nothing here is capable of making that sound except for my...

1840
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,200
AC or my PC.

1841
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,460
Oh, it could...

1842
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,760
That could be an AC sound.

1843
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,460
I mean, maybe my AC went crazy for a little bit and go like...

1844
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:52,720
Beep!

1845
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,040
Beep!

1846
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:53,420
Beep!

1847
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,400
But like, why would you...

1848
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,080
Why would you do that?

1849
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,620
Did you not hear it?

1850
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,520
Is your headphones like...

1851
00:57:59,520 --> 00:57:59,960
No, I...

1852
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,300
I have in-ears, so I don't hear shit outside.

1853
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:02,900
Oh!

1854
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,660
I can't hear anything in my room.

1855
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,320
You could stab me in the back and now...

1856
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,140
It could be the AC, actually.

1857
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,780
Your AC went fucking crazy there.

1858
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,480
Why... Why did it do that?

1859
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,740
It could be a ghost.

1860
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,620
Why did the AC go...

1861
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:16,980
Beep!

1862
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:17,420
Beep!

1863
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:17,760
Beep!

1864
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,000
What...

1865
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,160
What's it yapping for?

1866
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,140
Well, you can't explain what ghost wants to do.

1867
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,000
Why is it yapping like that?

1868
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,500
Because the ghost hates you.

1869
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,340
I don't fucking know.

1870
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,940
What did you do?

1871
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,000
I don't...

1872
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,080
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

1873
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,340
I'm afraid of faulty equipment.

1874
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,020
You might need to get your AC checked.

1875
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,260
How did that happen?

1876
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,360
I just bought this new one.

1877
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,140
Oh, it's a lemon.

1878
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,460
Can they end the game faster so we can like go back to the game?

1879
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,580
I don't know why.

1880
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,500
At least I didn't have to go back to destroying this lobby.

1881
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,440
Look, if like, our PR didn't throw, we'd be first place.

1882
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,600
Right, Ditto?

1883
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:50,760
Yes.

1884
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,140
You literally fell over like a...

1885
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,040
He didn't cover you.

1886
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,200
He didn't cover you.

1887
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,420
Yeah, you didn't cover me.

1888
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:58,620
I...

1889
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,680
Oh, yeah, sorry, I didn't cover.

1890
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,000
I only cracked one person that was shooting at you.

1891
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:09,060
I'm sorry I couldn't crack all three at the same time while you're standing like the fucking statue of Jesus Christ on top of a mountain.

1892
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:09,980
Like, hello?

1893
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,860
Well, I'm glad that you agreed with me.

1894
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,440
Like, I'm just trying to.

1895
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,740
I apologize.

1896
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,800
It's not my fault!

1897
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,720
Well, it's not mine or Ditto's fault.

1898
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,800
It could be Ditto's fault though.

1899
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,840
Ditto, why didn't you cover RPR and I?

1900
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,860
No, he is a pro.

1901
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,120
He can cover himself.

1902
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,480
That's so true!

1903
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,380
Wait, that's so true though.

1904
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,700
I'm going to go pee now.

1905
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,140
I need my 5 minutes.

1906
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,560
I need my time off this team for a couple minutes.

1907
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,560
Consider this a smoke break.

1908
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,540
We're not the problem here, right Ditto?

1909
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,480
We're not the problem.

1910
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:09,100
Yeah, we did everything correctly.

1911
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,480
Yes, yes.

1912
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,300
Yes!

1913
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:15,720
Yeah!

1914
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,700
Oh, that's so sad.

1915
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,140
RPR always blaming teammates.

1916
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:18,640
I know!

1917
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,860
He always blames... That's why he retired.

1918
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,620
You're so right.

1919
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,640
He would be so mad.

1920
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,100
That's why we say it when he's in the bathroom.

1921
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1922
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1923
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,260
I thought he can't hear us.

1924
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,220
No, he can't.

1925
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,120
No, he can't.

1926
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,000
He doesn't have enough money for wireless...

1927
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,780
...wireless headphones.

1928
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:54,820
Oh my god.

1929
01:00:59,020 --> 01:00:59,820
It's okay.

1930
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,620
We're... guys, it's okay.

1931
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,140
We're...

1932
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,420
We're going to win this next one.

1933
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,540
Yes, yes, sure.

1934
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:07,540
Yes, yes, sure.

1935
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,220
Yes, yes, sure.

1936
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:10,800
We win.

1937
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,200
Yeah, I know.

1938
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,280
He was trolling.

1939
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,640
He was trolling us.

1940
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,380
Like, he said this spot was like the best spot.

1941
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,600
And then we died.

1942
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:21,980
Yes.

1943
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:22,820
Yeah.

1944
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:23,940
Yeah.

1945
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,280
That's so messed up.

1946
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:27,140
He truly is a Minhera.

1947
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,880
Okay, I win when we get the base spot.

1948
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:31,620
Yeah, I know.

1949
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,120
Right?

1950
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,420
If it's the best spot, we wouldn't have died.

1951
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,060
That is so true.

1952
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:36,520
Yeah.

1953
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,260
It would...

1954
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:41,580
The best spot means that we should live.

1955
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:42,520
Like...

1956
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,120
Yes.

1957
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:48,960
Oh, she's coming back.

1958
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,380
Welcome back, RPR.

1959
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,620
Oh, he's not back yet.

1960
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,560
RPR.

1961
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,120
RPR, welcome back.

1962
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,180
We missed you.

1963
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,360
Toilet one was taken, so I had to pee in toilet two.

1964
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,160
Nice.

1965
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,800
Hey, we missed you, RPR.

1966
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,040
We were like talking about how good you were as IGL.

1967
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,780
Stop fucking lying to my face.

1968
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,260
Yes.

1969
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,280
Are you trying to say Ditto would lie?

1970
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,740
She said yes.

1971
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,340
Yes.

1972
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,260
Yes.

1973
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:18,860
Doggy, the last time I told him that my favorite Apex player was up here and he didn't believe me.

1974
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,100
I don't believe you.

1975
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:20,400
Wow!

1976
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,140
That's fucked up.

1977
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,960
You're my hero.

1978
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,540
You're only second to zero.

1979
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,320
There's about 15 players that are before me.

1980
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,000
Yeah, but like we know you, so you're ahead of those 15 players.

1981
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,080
Yeah, but you're also nocturnal, fun, like five more ahead of me.

1982
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:51,180
Hal, Verhoest...

1983
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep adding.

1984
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,040
Reps, Jen Burton...

1985
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,400
This is really helping your case.

1986
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,460
Mandy...

1987
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,400
Yeah, okay.

1988
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,140
Yeah, okay.

1989
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1990
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1991
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1992
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,200
Second to zero.

1993
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,880
You don't even know zero.

1994
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,500
Not yet.

1995
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:18,840
Okay.

1996
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,580
But he's already ahead of me.

1997
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:25,900
Great top.

1998
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,320
It's okay, this time.

1999
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,460
This time we'll win first, right?

2000
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,280
Right, Kiel?

2001
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:34,530
Yeah.

2002
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:39,600
Yeah, no, if my teammate doesn't turn into a statue and die randomly...

2003
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,640
Alright, I'll pay attention.

2004
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,760
I'll pay attention this time.

2005
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,680
Yeah, that'll be good.

2006
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:46,800
That'll be the plus.

2007
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,600
It's okay.

2008
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,760
We got this.

2009
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,880
I believe in us.

2010
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,960
I believe in believing.

2011
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,260
Yay!

2012
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,260
We win this.

2013
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,320
Yeah, we win this.

2014
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,140
Zed is gonna get 20k bomb for us.

2015
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,100
Yes, yes.

2016
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:06,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2017
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,580
If she doesn't get 4k, we kick her.

2018
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:10,880
Okay.

2019
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,760
If we lose, it's RPR's fault.

2020
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,580
Yeah, if we lose, it's RPR's fault.

2021
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:18,920
Why?

2022
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,640
Okay, but like why?

2023
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,940
Okay, I'm like trying...

2024
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,560
Because you ideal.

2025
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:27,020
In TSM, when TSM lost, it was Hal's fault.

2026
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:28,900
So you got it.

2027
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,920
So it's... since we're new TSM, it's your fault.

2028
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,420
Because you ideal.

2029
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,840
First of all, it wasn't Hal's fault.

2030
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,040
It was always Evan or Jordan.

2031
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:39,720
Okay?

2032
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,320
It was never me.

2033
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,100
Okay?

2034
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,320
But the chat says it's Hal's fault.

2035
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,500
Yeah, but chat's always gonna blame the English.

2036
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,140
They're like the most popular player on the team is always at fault.

2037
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,820
Wait, but it's not my fault.

2038
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:03,420
It's absolutely your fault every single time.

2039
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,280
Without fail.

2040
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,720
Oh, maybe there's someone near us.

2041
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:08,960
Oh no.

2042
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:09,680
Ditto, fly away.

2043
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:10,900
Why?

2044
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,340
It's RPR that's near you.

2045
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:12,680
Why?

2046
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,720
I want to be with you until...

2047
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,920
Until death.

2048
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:16,720
Yeah.

2049
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,440
Like this team is just made to ruin my mental health.

2050
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,200
This is insane.

2051
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,040
Yeah, that's why we...

2052
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:29,940
Team slightly Manera.

2053
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,040
No, no, no.

2054
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,960
We are team totally Manera right now.

2055
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,280
Team severe Manera.

2056
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,500
Team I'm just like over the edge.

2057
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,120
It only takes one bad day.

2058
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,680
It takes one day.

2059
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,300
It doesn't even need to be bad.

2060
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,000
Just one day.

2061
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:48,320
There's a massive here.

2062
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,280
Okay.

2063
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,180
Oh, I got it.

2064
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,200
All right, nice.

2065
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,260
Team supreme Manera.

2066
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,560
I'm going to need a hiatus number two, I think.

2067
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,540
Maybe number three.

2068
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,860
Maybe we'll combine a couple.

2069
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,200
Wait, wait, wait.

2070
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:05,520
Ooh.

2071
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:06,460
Yeah.

2072
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,100
I'm going to knock.

2073
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:08,760
Nice.

2074
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,640
I have a destructor here if anyone wants it.

2075
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:12,840
Okay.

2076
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,260
It's all right.

2077
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:14,740
It's okay.

2078
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,700
I'm using nemesis and massive.

2079
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:18,740
All right.

2080
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:23,840
I am hemlock nemesis, but I'd rather have hemlock Havoc.

2081
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,640
Because I heard Havoc is like the gun now.

2082
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,480
It's the only gun in the game you ever need.

2083
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,120
If you have Havoc, you don't need anything else.

2084
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,420
What's this?

2085
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:32,980
Hammer point.

2086
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,000
I'll need that.

2087
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,940
I'm heading over for the knockdown shield.

2088
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,640
Oh my God.

2089
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,760
I want Havoc.

2090
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:43,380
Yay.

2091
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:43,820
Havoc?

2092
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:44,360
Okay.

2093
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,820
Actually, I'll find a Havoc for us.

2094
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,940
That's not my job.

2095
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,300
That is your job.

2096
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,260
I tell you where to go and not what to look.

2097
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,300
Wait, there's a Havoc here where Ditto is and she didn't ping it.

2098
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,240
Oh.

2099
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,380
Oh, I didn't see.

2100
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,240
I didn't see.

2101
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:58,600
Wow.

2102
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,440
Ditto what?

2103
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,540
I didn't see.

2104
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,680
I'm your fault.

2105
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,560
He didn't tell me.

2106
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,420
How am I supposed to tell you what you're seeing?

2107
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:09,720
You're so right.

2108
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,300
You need it?

2109
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,140
You need it?

2110
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,640
I can have it too.

2111
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,220
You're so right.

2112
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:18,480
How am I supposed to tell you what you're looking with your own eyes?

2113
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,980
Well, just tell me what you want.

2114
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,480
You have to say it.

2115
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:22,840
Yeah.

2116
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,500
You weren't assertive enough.

2117
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:25,420
Yeah.

2118
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,540
There's no way I could know what you want.

2119
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:31,430
Look, English is her third language RPR.

2120
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,590
You have to be more...

2121
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,000
It's my 14th language.

2122
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,780
Don't you hear him?

2123
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,820
Ooh, nice.

2124
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,100
Thank you.

2125
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,480
I'm getting hungry.

2126
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,600
I need a backpack that's not white.

2127
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,460
There's a... ooh, I'll take that actually.

2128
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,680
I need a Havoc.

2129
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,660
I need energy...

2130
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,120
Is there a purple helmet here?

2131
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:00,720
Okay.

2132
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:02,680
Yay.

2133
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,620
I need energy magazine.

2134
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,680
What are these stupid zones?

2135
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,720
I don't know, IGL.

2136
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:09,460
What are they?

2137
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,020
It's all monument.

2138
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,480
It doesn't tell me shit.

2139
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,900
This map doesn't tell me shit.

2140
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,360
Okay, I will scan.

2141
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:15,800
I will scan.

2142
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,300
I can't read.

2143
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:16,760
Okay.

2144
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,000
Don't worry.

2145
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,700
Our better player is going to scan for us.

2146
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,180
Okay.

2147
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:22,980
There's someone there.

2148
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,840
I'm with you, Ditto.

2149
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,200
If you need help.

2150
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,620
Our IGL is not with us.

2151
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,620
Yeah, because you're supposed to follow me, not the other way around.

2152
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,100
Yeah, but we were scanning.

2153
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:32,760
We have to scan.

2154
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,500
Yeah, we have to scan.

2155
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,240
If you were a pro player now, you would know.

2156
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:37,520
Why?

2157
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,960
Why don't you wait for us?

2158
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,200
Yeah.

2159
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,040
Did I say we need a scan?

2160
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:43,680
Yeah.

2161
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:44,860
Yes.

2162
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,040
When did I say that?

2163
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:46,920
First game.

2164
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:47,180
First game.

2165
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:47,840
Yeah.

2166
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,960
This is a game-by-game basis thing.

2167
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,640
Okay.

2168
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,940
You should have told us that after first game comes, it's different.

2169
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:01,400
Okay.

2170
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:01,960
Okay.

2171
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,760
Where do we go, RPR?

2172
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,240
She's unbelievable.

2173
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:05,520
Just follow me.

2174
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,760
Just follow me.

2175
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,000
Me.

2176
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,000
Follow me.

2177
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:09,700
Behind me.

2178
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,080
Okay.

2179
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:12,880
Yay.

2180
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,580
I will only follow you.

2181
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,660
Yeah, we're following you.

2182
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:17,900
I will only follow you.

2183
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,440
Yeah.

2184
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,260
I'm not going to go anywhere.

2185
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,300
Yeah, yeah.

2186
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,560
We'll only follow you.

2187
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:22,520
Good.

2188
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:22,580
Good.

2189
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:22,660
Good.

2190
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:22,960
You won't be able to see us.

2191
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,740
We'll only think for ourselves.

2192
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:24,980
Yeah.

2193
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,880
This is the shit I got to play.

2194
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,200
I think they are alone.

2195
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,060
I think they are alone.

2196
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:30,580
I'm going to...

2197
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:31,080
I'm not...

2198
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,280
Yeah, I won't shoot.

2199
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,440
If he doesn't tell us to shoot, we won't shoot.

2200
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:34,820
Yes.

2201
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,200
Do you guys want to lose?

2202
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,640
Like, honestly.

2203
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,460
Like, do you guys just want to lose?

2204
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,140
But you told us to follow you.

2205
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,400
Yeah.

2206
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:44,480
Oh my god.

2207
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:45,960
We're rotating of course.

2208
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,940
What if somebody shows up while we're rotating.

2209
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,280
While we are rotating, do we shoot?

2210
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:59,480
It will be a case by case command that I'm gonna give you.

2211
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,560
Oh, okay.

2212
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,640
Okay, okay.

2213
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:02,780
Yeah, I get it.

2214
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,260
I get it.

2215
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,740
For now, I will follow you.

2216
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:06,860
Yeah, we follow you.

2217
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,080
T-S-N-T-U Oh, they are scanning.

2218
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,720
I need a fucking Havoc.

2219
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,720
I have one.

2220
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,340
You wanna look at it?

2221
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,420
You can't win without Havoc.

2222
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,200
Wasn't there a team here?

2223
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,180
This thing is broken.

2224
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,420
Yeah, there was a team here.

2225
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,460
Yeah, but they are gone.

2226
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,440
Because they are going zone.

2227
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,740
Wait, we gotta scan again.

2228
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:29,760
I have package.

2229
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,360
Yeah, let's scan again.

2230
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,420
IGL, should we scan again, IGL?

2231
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:35,720
Yeah, guys.

2232
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,540
IGL, should we do it?

2233
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,560
Just rip it.

2234
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:42,980
Let's do four more scans.

2235
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:43,820
Wait, wait, wait.

2236
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,240
Dude, the respawn beacon.

2237
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,140
Are they gonna res?

2238
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,540
Nope, that's three people.

2239
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,360
What the fuck are you doing?

2240
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,660
Kill them anyway.

2241
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:53,160
Where are we going?

2242
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,540
Almost cracked 500.

2243
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,280
What the fuck?

2244
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:57,740
Cracked two?

2245
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,940
You didn't crack anyone, liar.

2246
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,200
She's just lying now.

2247
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,520
There's a purple helmet.

2248
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,320
What the fuck?

2249
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,520
I have so many batteries.

2250
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,980
Is this Skyhook again?

2251
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:11,760
There's three people.

2252
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,340
There's three teams at Skyhook.

2253
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,820
I'll tell you in a second.

2254
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:16,340
Yes.

2255
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,460
I have a redeploy.

2256
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,220
Anyone use it?

2257
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,140
We all have redeploys.

2258
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,840
Yeah, but I really want the fucking Havoc.

2259
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,140
What is this bullshit game?

2260
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,680
We'll find a Havoc at Skyhook.

2261
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,400
I'll put a redeploy here.

2262
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,320
Why are you having like now?

2263
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:32,740
Yeah, yeah.

2264
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,040
I have redeploy.

2265
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,420
Yeah, let's go with redeploy.

2266
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,840
No one know who to shoot.

2267
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,140
Yeah, this is a professional strat.

2268
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,780
Where did they shoot me?

2269
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,040
I wanted to redeploy first.

2270
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:50,040
No, but pros always use multiple redeploys.

2271
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:50,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2272
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,220
See, we're just doing what the pros do.

2273
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:53,580
Exactly.

2274
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,060
Adita, where are you walking?

2275
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,400
I'm flying a skull.

2276
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,960
We're trying to find you a Havoc.

2277
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,240
Right, Adita?

2278
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,400
We're rotating now.

2279
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,260
Let's rotate.

2280
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,660
Adita, you can fly...

2281
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:14,320
What the heck?

2282
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,180
Behind me!

2283
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,800
Fight these motherfuckers.

2284
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:19,940
Murder them in cold blood.

2285
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,200
Where?

2286
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,520
They shot me.

2287
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,420
I see them.

2288
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:29,980
To your right.

2289
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,600
I'm the one on the right.

2290
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:31,960
I'm next to you.

2291
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,280
Two dead.

2292
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:35,520
I'm here.

2293
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:36,420
I'm with you.

2294
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,080
Last person is running.

2295
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:39,800
Oh, he is?

2296
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:40,740
Yes.

2297
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,520
Hey guys, I have zero damage.

2298
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,360
Can I thirst the other guy?

2299
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,920
These guys don't have a fucking Havoc.

2300
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,820
This guy has a Havoc.

2301
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,200
The guy that was running has a Havoc.

2302
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,600
Yeah, but I'm not gonna chase.

2303
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,660
I'll actually fuck him.

2304
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,060
Let's kill him.

2305
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,300
Wait, I wanna loot this though.

2306
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,020
No, but he's already so far gone.

2307
01:12:59,020 --> 01:12:59,660
Yeah, he's so far.

2308
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,320
We should go to his own.

2309
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:03,300
They're playing Catalyst, Bloodhound, and the last person was what?

2310
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:03,780
Bangalore?

2311
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,960
They can't craft banners.

2312
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:05,800
Let's camp them.

2313
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:06,760
We can.

2314
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,740
He's gonna bring me the Havoc.

2315
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,720
I promise you.

2316
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,220
Well, wait.

2317
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,240
This guy has a Carbine.

2318
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,000
I want a Carbine.

2319
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,040
I wanna use the Carbine.

2320
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,800
Hey, I'm dropping a Havoc.

2321
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:18,320
Come here.

2322
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,480
Sit right here.

2323
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,080
Sit on me.

2324
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,140
Alright.

2325
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,880
I want this guy to deliver me a Havoc.

2326
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,740
I didn't know if he actually does have a Havoc.

2327
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,580
I was just...

2328
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,480
I did clean the tube.

2329
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:32,780
Over here.

2330
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,660
Who the fuck is that?

2331
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,200
That's a new team.

2332
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,780
Why do they have purple?

2333
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,400
Are they cheating?

2334
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,960
Yeah, why do they have purple?

2335
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,240
Where's our purple?

2336
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,920
Fuck, you guys cheating, bro.

2337
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:46,640
Yeah.

2338
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,200
Cheating in a scrim?

2339
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,700
What's wrong with you?

2340
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,960
I'm taking shots.

2341
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,120
I keep reinstalling his brain cells.

2342
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:55,960
Let's go to the skyhook.

2343
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:56,420
Okay.

2344
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,140
I'm like 900 away from the purple guys.

2345
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,140
I'm 151.

2346
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,440
You're really putting in the hard work, aren't you?

2347
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:05,740
I am.

2348
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:07,640
I am.

2349
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,200
I'm gonna scan.

2350
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,160
Alright, just watch the vents.

2351
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:13,500
Alright.

2352
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,640
That's scary.

2353
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,560
Wait, they scanned us from here.

2354
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:18,760
Oh yeah.

2355
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,320
I need like... more shield cells.

2356
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,400
Hey, you found a Havoc.

2357
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,400
Nope, that was a vault.

2358
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,960
One team there.

2359
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,600
Wait, are we going back to the same house?

2360
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,140
Same house.

2361
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,180
Same house and we win.

2362
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:35,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2363
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,340
We play exactly the same.

2364
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,420
And then we kill everyone and they die.

2365
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:42,200
And we win.

2366
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:42,840
Yay!

2367
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,560
We're so good at this video game.

2368
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,680
Wait, is there anyone in...

2369
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,740
Why are they in the building that I want?

2370
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,420
There's a battery here.

2371
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:54,580
Why are you shooting at me?

2372
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,140
Okay, I...

2373
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,680
What the fuck is wrong with people?

2374
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,120
They just wanna give you a hug.

2375
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,180
Come here, let's go to this building now.

2376
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,780
What the fuck is...

2377
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:06,480
What is this contraption here?

2378
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,900
Can you scan this building if there's anyone in there?

2379
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,060
You're already in it, so like what's the point?

2380
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,400
No, no, the other one to the right.

2381
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,320
There is three dudes.

2382
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,960
Well, they think they can beat us by taking the spot before us.

2383
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,840
That's not how it works.

2384
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,040
They have the new castle though.

2385
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,520
What do we do?

2386
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:25,360
Can somebody take my package?

2387
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,110
Wait for my...

2388
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,980
Wait, I'm gonna see what is in the package.

2389
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:33,640
Where is the package?

2390
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,860
More bats.

2391
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,620
More bats.

2392
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,000
There's a lot of bats, guys.

2393
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,300
I'll take it.

2394
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,640
There's more bats here.

2395
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,960
There's so many bats, holy shit.

2396
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,260
I'm not saying no to bats.

2397
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:46,820
I'll take a bat.

2398
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:49,200
I got scanned.

2399
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,000
I don't know from where.

2400
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,960
I have seven bats now.

2401
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,100
I'm gonna scan.

2402
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,140
Oh, here.

2403
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,940
Let's go back to our building.

2404
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,840
This building is nicer and taller.

2405
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:01,600
Okay.

2406
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,700
On this one more.

2407
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,680
Someone's close to me.

2408
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,080
There.

2409
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,200
They're behind us.

2410
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:11,660
Behind the building.

2411
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,180
Scan behind.

2412
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,480
I'm here.

2413
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,760
Wait, I hear them.

2414
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:16,840
They're close.

2415
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,160
Close.

2416
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:17,300
Close.

2417
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,800
Wait, wait.

2418
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,220
One second.

2419
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,000
I hear a lot.

2420
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:24,720
Okay, no one here.

2421
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,760
Are they not in there anymore?

2422
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:27,800
Yeah.

2423
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:29,720
Where are they?

2424
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,560
Where did they go?

2425
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,320
They were here.

2426
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,060
Yeah, they disappeared.

2427
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,360
I don't know.

2428
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,060
I was probing to...

2429
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,080
10 seconds.

2430
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,440
10 seconds.

2431
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,340
Cool armor.

2432
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,320
You know, I have so many bats.

2433
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
I might as well use it.

2434
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,060
Can't hear over there.

2435
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,820
There's like a crypto.

2436
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:47,740
Are they in there?

2437
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:48,060
Okay.

2438
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,280
They're still there?

2439
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:49,880
Oh, okay.

2440
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,380
They went in the diner.

2441
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:53,580
Guys, stop.

2442
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,320
They're breaking our doors.

2443
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:55,280
Now I just wanna kill them.

2444
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,200
Stop, guys.

2445
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,620
You guys are pissing me off.

2446
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,440
You're pissing me off.

2447
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:01,960
Give me your feet.

2448
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:05,680
Get out of here.

2449
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,040
What do you think you're doing?

2450
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,280
What do you think you're doing?

2451
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:08,940
They're not beating us.

2452
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,880
Can you stop shooting from all the way up there, dumbass?

2453
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:14,840
Can you stop shooting from all the way up there, dumbass?

2454
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:16,640
No.

2455
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,250
Why they have to shoot from far?

2456
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:20,500
Why they have to shoot from far?

2457
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,700
They are so far, but they still shoot us.

2458
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,020
Let's go next building over.

2459
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:25,360
Okay.

2460
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,340
Where's the next building?

2461
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,060
This one right in front.

2462
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,160
I think there's a team here.

2463
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,040
Yeah, yeah.

2464
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:33,040
I'm gonna scan.

2465
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:34,020
Yeah, we fight these guys.

2466
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:36,760
That guy's low.

2467
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:37,800
Oh my god.

2468
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:38,400
Guys!

2469
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,980
Donkey, where were you?

2470
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,140
Behind you.

2471
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:44,380
Where was I?

2472
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,600
Where did you shot from a different team?

2473
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,100
Where did you shot my team on the other side?

2474
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,960
No, no, no.

2475
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,840
That was a bad call.

2476
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,340
How was that a bad call?

2477
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,880
That was a bad call.

2478
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:00,200
There was literally a team shooting us to our right.

2479
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,540
How is this a bad call?

2480
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,720
Let's take this building.

2481
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,500
There's a team here.

2482
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:09,220
Me and Dito are there, but Doki is nowhere to be found.

2483
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,180
I was getting shot by a team to our right.

2484
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,720
How did you make that happen?

2485
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,740
Because you guys were also getting shot by the same team.

2486
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,120
I was literally watching it happen.

2487
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,560
I didn't get hit.

2488
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,560
I didn't get hit.

2489
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,020
That is not true.

2490
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,260
Look at the death recap.

2491
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,160
We have to scan first.

2492
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,060
Look at the death recap.

2493
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,920
Look at the death recap.

2494
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,060
No, no, no.

2495
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,920
I got shot by two different...

2496
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,040
I got shot by three different people.

2497
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,860
I'm not going to be blamed for this.

2498
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,900
Look at your death recap.

2499
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,860
You're not looking at your death recap because you know.

2500
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,340
Once again, this is your fault, Doki.

2501
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,680
How is it my fault?

2502
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,780
I got shot by a Newcastle.

2503
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,240
This team doesn't have a fucking Newcastle.

2504
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:49,980
Okay.

2505
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,320
Did you get shot by a Newcastle like I did?

2506
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,940
Look at your death recap.

2507
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,700
No, I have not.

2508
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,460
No, you have not.

2509
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,880
It's Catalyst and Bangalore that hit me.

2510
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,860
You don't have a Catalyst.

2511
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,500
Yeah, but I healed the damage that Catalyst did to me.

2512
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:09,060
They don't even have a Catalyst.

2513
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,200
Yeah, but Catalyst cracked me.

2514
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,180
I popped a bat and then we pushed.

2515
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:15,640
What do you mean?

2516
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,840
You were so low.

2517
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,840
Then I also got shot by the other team.

2518
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,680
So why were you guys getting hit and I'm not getting hit?

2519
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,040
It doesn't make any sense.

2520
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,580
You guys have to dodge.

2521
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:28,600
Catalyst!

2522
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,880
Where is your portal?

2523
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:32,860
Yeah, where is your portal?

2524
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,580
Why would we report for five feet?

2525
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,180
What?

2526
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,100
We wouldn't get shot.

2527
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,300
We wouldn't get shot.

2528
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,740
But you guys suck at dodging.

2529
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:44,760
I can't help you.

2530
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,440
You were also the one that got shot too.

2531
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,400
What about you?

2532
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,660
Before we pushed, yeah, okay.

2533
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,320
I got shot.

2534
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:51,660
Wow.

2535
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,520
You literally dodged that shit.

2536
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,680
You literally said you got shot.

2537
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,580
By Bangalore, yeah.

2538
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,140
I can't believe it.

2539
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,400
RPR is through so hard.

2540
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,360
No, but like where were you?

2541
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,160
I was literally right behind you guys.

2542
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,780
Getting shot by the other team.

2543
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,540
But the whole team is here except for Doki.

2544
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,680
Doki is not part of the team.

2545
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,620
No, I was with you guys.

2546
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:18,700
I was literally with you guys.

2547
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,000
I was with you guys.

2548
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,740
I was about to rez you because you died outside the door.

2549
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,280
I was about to rez you because you died inside.

2550
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,160
Of course I'm gonna crawl inside.

2551
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,220
Why did you crawl inside?

2552
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,040
I could literally have rez'd you.

2553
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:30,980
There's no doors to begin with.

2554
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:31,840
They broke the doors.

2555
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,000
I could have rez'd you.

2556
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,640
I could have rez'd you outside of the house.

2557
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:39,720
And you're telling me that if you rez'd me outside the house, I could have rez'd you outside the house and then I could have killed by Bangalore?

2558
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:43,820
You could have got free rez because nobody was pushing you outside the house?

2559
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:48,600
You could have done so much but instead you're sitting here dead and yapping like...

2560
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,440
You died first.

2561
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,100
I died for the team.

2562
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,620
I died for the team too.

2563
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:54,680
I died for the team too.

2564
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,080
You died last so you didn't die for the team.

2565
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:58,540
I...

2566
01:20:58,540 --> 01:20:58,860
No!

2567
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:03,620
It's right that it's not good that Lifeline died first.

2568
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:04,300
It's right that it's not good that Lifeline died first.

2569
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,740
Yeah, that's so true Ditto.

2570
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:06,600
She's Lifeline.

2571
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,680
Why are you on her side?

2572
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,280
She just left us in a 2v3.

2573
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,300
That is not true.

2574
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,980
It was like a 1v2 from what I saw.

2575
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,060
No, it was a 2v3.

2576
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,960
It was a fucking 1v2.

2577
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,900
I saw it.

2578
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,640
There was like one guy in there.

2579
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,140
Oh my god.

2580
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,060
Now she's just gaslighting.

2581
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:25,920
You know what?

2582
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,280
Maybe RPR should play Lifeline.

2583
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,280
Yeah, you should IGEL and then...

2584
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,460
Okay, no, no, no.

2585
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,780
IGEL can be on Lifeline.

2586
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,060
IGEL can be on Lifeline.

2587
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,820
Where are you pulling this...

2588
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,180
Where are you pulling this factor?

2589
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,660
Where are you pulling your stats from?

2590
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,140
From years of experience!

2591
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,880
You haven't been a competitive player for so long.

2592
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:52,120
You haven't been a competitive player for so long.

2593
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,020
Meta changed.

2594
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:55,760
Listen to me.

2595
01:21:55,820 --> 01:22:00,160
How the fuck is Lifeline going to IGEL when he has to be behind his whole team?

2596
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:00,860
It's the same thing.

2597
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,420
How is he going to IGEL when he literally has to be behind everyone?

2598
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:05,840
What is he going to tell them?

2599
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:06,880
Yeah, you guys go there.

2600
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,220
You fuck them up, boys.

2601
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,280
Yeah, I got your back.

2602
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,780
I mean, you gotta try it out and see how much better it is.

2603
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,380
I'm not going to...

2604
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,060
I'm not going to do this stupid shit.

2605
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:20,520
Okay?

2606
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,520
We're going to play proper Apex Legends.

2607
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,220
Dude, how come we died?

2608
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:31,260
I would explain your mistakes to you.

2609
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:31,700
Like...

2610
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,860
Are you like an M?

2611
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,600
You want to hear them over and over again?

2612
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,140
Like you just want me to keep shitting on you?

2613
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:41,740
I mean...

2614
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:44,020
You're the reason why we died though.

2615
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,400
You were not with the team!

2616
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,280
Why are you five seconds late to the move?

2617
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,120
I'm sorry.

2618
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:52,980
I was five seconds late.

2619
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,120
I was like one second.

2620
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,840
Stop the gap!

2621
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,600
That fight was like at least ten seconds long.

2622
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,780
We're not winning, guys.

2623
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,320
Oy vey, oy vey.

2624
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:08,980
We're not winning.

2625
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,600
Yeah, we're not...

2626
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:13,960
I'm going to fucking murder you.

2627
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,780
Like the second game, you're standing still like a statue.

2628
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:20,420
You get beamed from across the planet.

2629
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,120
We get pushed.

2630
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:24,220
And now you're not with the team and you're gaslighting.

2631
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,420
And then you're crying.

2632
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,440
We're now winning.

2633
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,420
Like what more can I do?

2634
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,840
What more can I do?

2635
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,440
Ditto, what more can RPR do?

2636
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,280
Ditto.

2637
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:45,060
Ditto, what more can he do?

2638
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,780
Doki is literally...

2639
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:51,320
Second game, you're literally that statue on top of Rio de Janeiro.

2640
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:51,860
Jesus.

2641
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:52,900
That's on the...

2642
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,360
above the clouds.

2643
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,520
Calm down, calm down.

2644
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,940
Their IGL is on Bloodhound.

2645
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,080
Their IGL is on Bloodhound.

2646
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,080
Okay.

2647
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,260
Fuck what they do.

2648
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:06,820
They're obviously worse than us.

2649
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:07,720
But they killed us.

2650
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,100
They didn't kill us.

2651
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,160
We died to you.

2652
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,500
This guy is ranked 26th spread.

2653
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,040
When have you been top?

2654
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:16,000
Ranked 26th spread.

2655
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:16,380
Wow.

2656
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,020
You won a fucking championship.

2657
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,840
Like you're gonna compare me to a ranked 26th spread.

2658
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,400
But what was your...

2659
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,320
Motherfucker's playing...

2660
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,420
He's playing in kindergarten while I was playing in the NBA.

2661
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,680
Like what are we talking about?

2662
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,940
But what was your peak rank?

2663
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,440
It was top 10.

2664
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:38,620
No number for that?

2665
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:39,480
No.

2666
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,120
I don't remember.

2667
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:42,580
It was me knocking Raptor.

2668
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,700
We grinded one season to top 10 and then we stopped.

2669
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,000
But did you end on top 10?

2670
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:51,820
I have better shit to do like winning tournaments instead of playing ranked.

2671
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,780
What is wrong with you?

2672
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:54,980
Wait this guy...

2673
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,480
The team that killed us won.

2674
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:58,560
They're called THC.

2675
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,740
They're high as fuck and they won against us.

2676
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,300
These motherfuckers are high out of their minds.

2677
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,440
They probably popped a fucking edible.

2678
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,220
The edible motherfucker said...

2679
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:18,600
But we died to this team.

2680
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,880
We died to this team.

2681
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,820
Okay we go next.

2682
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,160
The next map.

2683
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,760
Oh wait that's the good map.

2684
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,100
We go next and...

2685
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,900
In the next game...

2686
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:32,340
If...

2687
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:35,980
Who die first that is their fault.

2688
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:37,060
Yeah yeah yeah.

2689
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,100
I agree.

2690
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:39,860
This is so stupid.

2691
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:45,120
Why are you guys so focused on who's dying first?

2692
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,280
And who's fault it is.

2693
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,220
Instead of winning the fucking game.

2694
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,280
What are you guys focusing on?

2695
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,980
But that's...

2696
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,580
That's how we know.

2697
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,380
Up here you started.

2698
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,540
You started.

2699
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:59,260
You always blame.

2700
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:01,440
Yeah you're always blaming people.

2701
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,820
You guys don't understand that when you...

2702
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,380
Yeah that's so true.

2703
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,620
When you're the IGL you get blaming privileges.

2704
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:11,280
If you want to blame other people...

2705
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,280
Go ahead and IGL.

2706
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:18,470
I think you gotta...

2707
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:20,510
I think...

2708
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:21,930
Calm down.

2709
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:22,810
Yeah calm down.

2710
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:24,490
This is just a scrim.

2711
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:26,950
Don't take it so seriously.

2712
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:28,690
The best thing to tell them is to calm down.

2713
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,310
That's really smart from you guys.

2714
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:32,450
We're really gonna help out here.

2715
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:33,550
It's okay.

2716
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:35,550
Just slow down.

2717
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:36,710
It's just a scrim.

2718
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,270
You don't have to take this so seriously.

2719
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:43,610
You literally five minutes before you were crying.

2720
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:45,430
Why are we not winning?

2721
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:47,710
What do we want about it?

2722
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:53,430
We're just here to have a good time.

2723
01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:53,650
We're just here to have a good time.

2724
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:54,110
Right Ditto?

2725
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:55,330
Yeah.

2726
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:57,690
So it doesn't matter if we don't win?

2727
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:00,890
I mean...

2728
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:00,990
Yeah.

2729
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:05,090
Now it matters.

2730
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:05,350
Now it matters.

2731
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:06,570
Really?

2732
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:13,010
The ALGS champion winner not winning a simple scrim against VTubers?

2733
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:13,150
The ALGS champion winner not winning a simple scrim against VTubers?

2734
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:13,450
I don't care.

2735
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,630
Personally I would go fuck.

2736
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:19,430
I don't care.

2737
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,690
That doesn't look good for you though.

2738
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:22,290
I mean I don't care.

2739
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,630
I'm gonna get my win one way or another.

2740
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:26,170
Through this tournament.

2741
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:31,850
Are we doing the same comp?

2742
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:34,670
Of course we are.

2743
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:35,950
What the fuck are we gonna switch up?

2744
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:36,930
I don't know.

2745
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:37,590
It's a different map.

2746
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:39,610
Different map?

2747
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:40,310
Same shit.

2748
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:41,610
It's a different packaging.

2749
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:42,290
Who cares?

2750
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,250
We're gonna talk about Bangalore.

2751
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:46,010
Fuck is Bangalore gonna do for us?

2752
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,790
Smoke us.

2753
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:51,170
We're making portals for us.

2754
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:52,350
We have portals.

2755
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,670
I made 15 portals just in the first game.

2756
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:56,370
Yeah but that's the first game.

2757
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:57,510
What about the second and third?

2758
01:27:57,850 --> 01:27:59,130
There was zero portals then.

2759
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:03,170
God how was that?

2760
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:05,510
I couldn't port you when you died so fast.

2761
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:06,570
It was over too quick.

2762
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,310
What was I gonna port?

2763
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:11,130
To the next lobby?

2764
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:14,650
That's better than no port.

2765
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:16,650
Okay.

2766
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:20,110
We will do Vayne in Stormpoint.

2767
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:21,830
Yeah we're gonna try so hard.

2768
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:23,190
My game crashed.

2769
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,130
Yeah we're trying so hard right now.

2770
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:27,990
My game crashed.

2771
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:30,570
I'm coming back in.

2772
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:32,450
I'm coming back in.

2773
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,550
I'm gonna try so crashes.

2774
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:36,690
Don't worry.

2775
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:38,590
Now after I get back in.

2776
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:40,030
I'm gonna try so hard.

2777
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:41,750
Where's the code?

2778
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:43,070
We told them not to start yet.

2779
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:43,710
I crashed.

2780
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,020
I mean you could play...

2781
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:53,740
I mean you could play...

2782
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,740
Why do we wanna be meta slaves?

2783
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,200
Why do we wanna be meta slaves?

2784
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:58,980
Because we're not winning.

2785
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,420
Because we're not winning.

2786
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,360
We're not winning because of the comp.

2787
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,320
It really ain't the comp's fault.

2788
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,220
It could be the comp issue.

2789
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,820
It could be the comp issue.

2790
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,120
Wait what's the...

2791
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,160
What comp would you play?

2792
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,160
I don't know.

2793
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,020
You're the IGL.

2794
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,080
So if you wanna switch the comp but you don't have any fucking ideas what to do.

2795
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:22,520
Then why do you switch?

2796
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:23,820
I didn't say I wanna swap.

2797
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,260
I'm just giving a suggestion.

2798
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,080
Suggestions from here on out are banned.

2799
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:30,540
Suggestions from here on out are banned.

2800
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:31,820
Wait we're 4th place guys.

2801
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,100
We're not even 2nd.

2802
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:36,320
We're not even 2nd.

2803
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:37,620
Okay.

2804
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,800
From here on out suggestions are banned.

2805
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,260
Wait that's fucked up.

2806
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,700
I make the rules.

2807
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,300
I IGL.

2808
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,820
If you wanna make the rules you can IGL.

2809
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,820
Okay but that's like...

2810
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,440
That's pretty fucked up.

2811
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,140
Okay let's do it.

2812
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,380
We listen.

2813
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,340
We listen to up here.

2814
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,580
Yeah we're good listeners.

2815
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,040
If we listen to you and we don't win first.

2816
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,660
Then I think that's just an IGL problem at that point.

2817
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,060
Yeah.

2818
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,200
I will listen to every comp you say.

2819
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,580
I'm gonna listen to every comp you say.

2820
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:15,180
And like I will make sure I wouldn't be super 100% focused.

2821
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,380
So if you don't listen what happens?

2822
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:19,180
What if you don't listen?

2823
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:20,920
Well it's never gonna happen.

2824
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,220
What if your ADHD kicks in?

2825
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:24,760
I don't have ADHD.

2826
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,080
You're a streamer.

2827
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,940
I don't have ADHD.

2828
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,360
I got tested.

2829
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,140
I just diagnosed you.

2830
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,440
Where's our land again?

2831
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,300
I don't know.

2832
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:41,840
Okay.

2833
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,280
Well there's a barometer.

2834
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,080
Yeah I heard it.

2835
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,900
See if I had ADHD I wouldn't have heard it.

2836
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:50,000
You heard it five minutes after I said it.

2837
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:55,740
There's no...

2838
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,820
This is the comp.

2839
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,640
Trust me I've done this shit for years.

2840
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,220
I always played Lifeline, Bloodhound and Raid.

2841
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:04,720
I always played Lifeline, Bloodhound and Raid.

2842
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,860
Yeah but like you retired years ago.

2843
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,600
So you think I'm just fucking...

2844
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,720
A person retires and just gets dumb?

2845
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,180
Like just forgets what they...

2846
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:18,480
It's like riding a fucking bike.

2847
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:19,600
You never forget this shit.

2848
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,300
Same shit just different packaging.

2849
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:21,760
The meta changes.

2850
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,960
Yeah but the game is dog shit like it was two years ago.

2851
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:25,820
It's still the same shit.

2852
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:26,480
No.

2853
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,920
Now we have EVO armor.

2854
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,040
We had that shit two years ago too.

2855
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:34,660
No we don't.

2856
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:37,100
We did have EVO armor two years ago.

2857
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,260
That was a year ago.

2858
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,920
No we had EVO...

2859
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,360
We had EVO armor for years.

2860
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,080
We just didn't have this stupid shit that you can't charge anymore.

2861
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:49,320
Yeah but we didn't have skills too.

2862
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,380
So as I said we have EVO charger.

2863
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:52,440
But dog shit.

2864
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:56,760
Skills wow what a big change.

2865
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:57,940
It's so different.

2866
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:02,080
Armors don't spawn in anymore.

2867
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:04,980
Now you can have your Horizon Q 5% off.

2868
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,360
Yeah.

2869
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,020
It's faster than before.

2870
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:06,980
Wow.

2871
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:10,620
Yeah but you said it's the same game.

2872
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,920
And I'm here to prove to you that it's not the same game.

2873
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:18,000
It's the same dog shit that they just packaged in a different box.

2874
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,600
And they're doing this shit every season.

2875
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,500
Yeah but we have new legends too.

2876
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:25,600
We have...

2877
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,840
That everyone uses.

2878
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,780
Don't forget everyone uses this Altair legend.

2879
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:32,340
Everyone...

2880
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,700
She's so useful that just people just...

2881
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,140
Part of every comp.

2882
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,720
It's just unbelievably useful.

2883
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,600
There's a gold sentinel...

2884
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,340
Not gold sentinel...

2885
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:42,700
We also have Vantage.

2886
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,180
That one is also very useful.

2887
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,060
Wow Conduit.

2888
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:50,180
One team in 15 teams uses Conduit.

2889
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,600
But Conduit was meta at one point.

2890
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:54,720
Yeah for like 5 minutes.

2891
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,300
And then they fucking murdered her.

2892
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,080
What about...

2893
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:58,940
Catalyst.

2894
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:01,400
Catalyst was like...

2895
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,140
Catalyst was out when I was competing.

2896
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,660
Doesn't count.

2897
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:10,730
We don't count that one.

2898
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:12,770
We don't count it but he's new.

2899
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:13,910
She's new.

2900
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:16,990
She's not new if she came out 2 years ago.

2901
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:17,990
Hey here's a Havoc.

2902
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:21,170
Okay you're on the hallway.

2903
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:22,370
Yeah there's a Havoc.

2904
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:24,450
Oh now you don't want our Havocs?

2905
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:29,510
Oh yeah let me quadruple wield fucking Havocs.

2906
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:30,630
Cause I got 4 hands.

2907
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:33,710
You can dual wield it.

2908
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:35,410
Nothing's stopping you from that.

2909
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:37,310
I want shotgun.

2910
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:39,130
Like do you wanna lose?

2911
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:41,230
No we're listeners right?

2912
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:42,190
We're listening.

2913
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,250
Yeah we're listening to you.

2914
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:47,170
You guys are doing a great job at listening.

2915
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:48,370
Thank you I'm glad you think so.

2916
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:51,270
This is some real high quality listening.

2917
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:51,830
Yay!

2918
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:54,370
He's complimenting us.

2919
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:59,690
We said we will listen to you but we didn't promise you that we are gonna do what you say.

2920
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:00,830
Oh okay.

2921
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:03,310
So you just wanna lose.

2922
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:06,390
So she's just planning to lose.

2923
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:08,850
I didn't say that.

2924
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:11,670
Yeah we will do what you say.

2925
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:13,170
We will do what you say.

2926
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:17,150
I'm making the battery.

2927
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:17,670
Why don't you try?

2928
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:19,270
I'm trying.

2929
01:34:19,650 --> 01:34:20,830
I'm making the battery.

2930
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:23,370
I need a therapist.

2931
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:25,270
No you don't.

2932
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:25,870
You have us.

2933
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:28,570
You guys are my therapist.

2934
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:32,010
We will do it for free.

2935
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:33,830
That's how good friends we are.

2936
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,770
I'll pay you to stay away from me.

2937
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,090
Am I on like 280?

2938
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:39,390
Let me double check.

2939
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:44,250
Guys I don't think I'm on the right frames.

2940
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,750
How much frames do you need?

2941
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:50,330
I think I'm on 60?

2942
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:52,310
No I'm on 200.

2943
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:53,430
Okay there we go.

2944
01:34:53,790 --> 01:34:54,670
Don't worry guys.

2945
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,230
My eyes are just tired.

2946
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:58,550
Don't worry my eyes are just tired.

2947
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:59,870
I just said movement.

2948
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:01,490
Alright here you go.

2949
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,430
Move now?

2950
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:05,170
Yeah I'm right behind you.

2951
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:07,210
Ditto's not listening.

2952
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,210
Ditto's not listening.

2953
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:11,650
Okay what are we in kindergarten?

2954
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:12,630
Like hello?

2955
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:14,430
I listen.

2956
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:17,190
She's not listening teacher.

2957
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:19,630
Okay I'm like.

2958
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:23,430
Have you taken this seriously for a second?

2959
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:26,960
I'm going.

2960
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,820
We're following you.

2961
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,800
When we die you're going to be like.

2962
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,180
Why are we not winning?

2963
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,700
Why are we not winning guys?

2964
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,100
Why are we not winning guys?

2965
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:37,220
Why aren't we?

2966
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:40,220
What's your vote?

2967
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,140
What's your own vote?

2968
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:44,300
Mr. RPR can I get a hall pass?

2969
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:46,640
No.

2970
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,460
No passes anywhere.

2971
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:50,880
No passes anywhere.

2972
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:53,060
No suggestions.

2973
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,780
No talking back.

2974
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:55,280
Nothing.

2975
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:55,740
No.

2976
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,360
We win a game.

2977
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,860
That sounds like I don't know that doesn't sound right.

2978
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,200
It's none of the rules like I said.

2979
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:10,780
It's not like.

2980
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,100
It's not like against a human, right?

2981
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:14,640
I'm not a fucking teacher.

2982
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:15,840
I have no license.

2983
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:16,500
Okay.

2984
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,160
Oh there's a team there, yeah.

2985
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,420
We kill these fucking spiders and take their shit.

2986
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:24,380
Okay.

2987
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,520
Okay teacher.

2988
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:26,920
Okay.

2989
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:30,700
Hey, there's another bat.

2990
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,440
Oh, I want a bat.

2991
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:35,720
Okay.

2992
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,080
I have six bats you wanted.

2993
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,280
I have four.

2994
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:41,560
Yeah.

2995
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,160
Wait, there's people over there.

2996
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:44,840
Stay at the station.

2997
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,540
Are we gonna get sandwiched?

2998
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:50,640
Yeah, are we?

2999
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,480
No, we are going to sandwich them.

3000
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,940
This is all part of my plan.

3001
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,280
We're following you.

3002
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,020
This is all part of my master plan.

3003
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,920
They're right here in front of me.

3004
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:00,540
They're right in front of me.

3005
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,680
Okay, end their life.

3006
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,300
Look at this nade.

3007
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,360
One, two, three, bomba.

3008
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,460
There's a guy on top.

3009
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,660
I'm gonna throw another bomba.

3010
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:12,740
I'm gonna throw another bomba.

3011
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,420
Wait, there's a guy on the...

3012
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:16,620
Are we gonna fight?

3013
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:19,500
Well, I mean...

3014
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,800
We gotta kill the guy that's close if we wanna fight.

3015
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,680
There's another bat here.

3016
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:24,520
There's so many bats.

3017
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,040
The guy that's close ran away.

3018
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:29,120
Like, why is he running?

3019
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,960
Because there was a team behind us.

3020
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:32,880
There is?

3021
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,120
What are you gonna do?

3022
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,860
Why are you guys so scared?

3023
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:37,280
I'm not saying...

3024
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,220
No, I'm not saying you guys.

3025
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,640
Them guys over there.

3026
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:43,800
Why are they so scared?

3027
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,200
There's a light mag there.

3028
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:45,940
Purple light mag.

3029
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:51,700
One HP!

3030
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:52,060
One HP!

3031
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:53,720
162!

3032
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:54,580
How is he alive?

3033
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,980
He's got 175.

3034
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:56,980
That's why he's alive.

3035
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,160
I'm here.

3036
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:01,600
They have conduit.

3037
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,760
See, they're using conduit.

3038
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,340
There's some stupid shit.

3039
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:06,480
You guys are fucking cheating.

3040
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:09,340
I'm okay.

3041
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:12,720
If conduit is cheating, then why don't we use conduit?

3042
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,500
It's conduit bad.

3043
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:15,820
These guys wanna terrapod us.

3044
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,840
And he has a longbow.

3045
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:19,360
Now I'm pissed.

3046
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,480
Why are you?

3047
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,480
He's not gonna fight.

3048
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,660
He wants to terrapod us.

3049
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,100
This game is dog shit.

3050
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:28,200
I'm waiting for you, RPR.

3051
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:29,500
Let's go.

3052
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,800
I have redeploy.

3053
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,660
I waited for you to use yours.

3054
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,280
Someone is also redeploying there.

3055
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:39,760
We are now in a race of who's gonna die first.

3056
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:41,040
Not us, that's for sure.

3057
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,100
What if I get shot?

3058
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,820
You're not gonna get shot because they can't shoot us.

3059
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:46,400
Okay.

3060
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,240
In the tunnel.

3061
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:48,760
You're right.

3062
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:51,860
You're so right, IGL.

3063
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:52,560
We listen.

3064
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:54,780
Yes.

3065
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,220
In the tunnel, get to this house.

3066
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,180
Keep moving to the next house.

3067
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:00,080
And we don't stop moving.

3068
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:01,400
If you stop moving, you're dead.

3069
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,620
I'm gonna pick you up.

3070
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,020
If you die, you're dead.

3071
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:07,140
Wait, why didn't you keep your portal to save us?

3072
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:09,400
There's no portals in this world.

3073
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:13,000
That sounds like a guy that wasn't gonna...

3074
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:13,420
No!

3075
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,680
I need a bat.

3076
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:16,660
I got shot.

3077
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:18,280
Pop your bat, stay alive.

3078
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,140
Okay.

3079
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:21,860
I'm alive.

3080
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,160
Get to this house now.

3081
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,560
Can you climb this up?

3082
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:27,260
Yeah, you can.

3083
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,360
Yay!

3084
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:30,940
We're alive!

3085
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,380
CRPR, we listen.

3086
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:34,520
I'm putting the best spot in the zone.

3087
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:35,440
Really?

3088
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:37,040
Yes.

3089
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:38,320
Where do you think the zone is gonna go?

3090
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:39,120
I don't know.

3091
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:39,760
Your IGL.

3092
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:42,580
If this shit pulls here, I mean, Jesus does not love us.

3093
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:45,120
Wait, then you're wrong.

3094
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,700
But I'm never wrong.

3095
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:49,340
But you were wrong last time.

3096
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:49,680
Okay.

3097
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:51,260
I was not wrong.

3098
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,040
Last game, we were in the right spot to win the game.

3099
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:54,860
You died.

3100
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:56,700
Because you were wrong.

3101
01:39:57,780 --> 01:39:58,760
How was I wrong?

3102
01:39:58,820 --> 01:39:59,880
We were in the correct spot!

3103
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,280
You're right.

3104
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:05,720
You're right.

3105
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,240
You're always right, RPR.

3106
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,880
I am always right.

3107
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:09,960
Because I'm the IGL.

3108
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:10,740
You're so right.

3109
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,260
So that means if you're always right, then we should win.

3110
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,260
Even if the zone does not go to us, we have an easy walk up to the zone no matter what.

3111
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:19,340
I'm not gonna go to the zone.

3112
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:20,320
And we have double choices.

3113
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:22,180
We can choose to go here or go here.

3114
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:23,300
We have so many choices.

3115
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:26,000
I watched the right side.

3116
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,300
Or should I watch, RPR?

3117
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:28,560
Good job, Ditto.

3118
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:29,980
Just stay alive.

3119
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:33,100
You just watch your life.

3120
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,060
But I want to contribute.

3121
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,720
You're contributing by being alive.

3122
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:39,580
But I want to do more.

3123
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:43,520
Okay, then stay at that house and stay alive.

3124
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:44,540
Okay.

3125
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:46,260
But where are you gonna watch?

3126
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:47,500
Everywhere.

3127
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,140
I'm literally looking everywhere.

3128
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,980
I'm looking at the house.

3129
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,240
Yep.

3130
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:56,600
I have a package.

3131
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,160
Good job.

3132
01:40:58,740 --> 01:40:59,880
Guys, I got a package.

3133
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,260
Yay!

3134
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,900
There's more bats and a purple helmet.

3135
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:11,920
What a shit package.

3136
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,440
You need a purple helmet.

3137
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:16,240
They don't have purple helmets.

3138
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,000
Ditto, you need this.

3139
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,500
Oh yeah, I need it.

3140
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,920
You need to heal.

3141
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:21,160
You're not full health, Doki.

3142
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:22,020
Go full health now.

3143
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:22,480
Wait.

3144
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:26,160
You told me to heal.

3145
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,640
You told me to heal.

3146
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,280
Yeah, I mean, why do I have to tell you to heal?

3147
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,080
You shouldn't hold this.

3148
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,640
Because I wasn't told.

3149
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:35,560
I'm the listener.

3150
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:40,940
Yeah, you told me to do whatever you say.

3151
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,140
Yeah, you told me to do whatever you say.

3152
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:42,480
Yeah, you told me to do whatever you say.

3153
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:45,740
So if you get hit by 150, you're not gonna heal?

3154
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:45,880
So if you get hit by 150, you're not gonna heal?

3155
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:46,780
Until I kill you.

3156
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:49,020
That's when you know I'm a...

3157
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,260
I quit this team.

3158
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:53,540
Find a new Imperial Hall.

3159
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,220
No, you're not supposed to leave TSM.

3160
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:02,580
I'm going to Dark Zero.

3161
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,140
It's over.

3162
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,720
We're all playing now.

3163
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:09,200
But you're not even a controller player.

3164
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,140
This game is shit.

3165
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:13,340
You got the zone wrong.

3166
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,240
You're definitely not going to Dark Zero.

3167
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,320
You got the zone wrong.

3168
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,140
We're gonna go for this.

3169
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,700
We're gonna go for this house.

3170
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:20,420
Okay.

3171
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,020
We're gonna play from there.

3172
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:23,960
And then the zone is probably gonna pull here.

3173
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,360
And we're gonna go through this.

3174
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,020
And blah blah blah.

3175
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:26,660
Let's go Rez it.

3176
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:28,140
Okay.

3177
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,900
Everyone has purple armor now.

3178
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,300
Yeah, everyone has purple.

3179
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,480
But we're still blue.

3180
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,040
Fuck them.

3181
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:38,540
So what?

3182
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,860
They can't aim and we can.

3183
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:41,000
That's the only thing that matters.

3184
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:41,900
We are TSM.

3185
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:45,240
Yeah, but that was not an aim issue.

3186
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:46,760
It wasn't?

3187
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,860
No, it was a brain issue.

3188
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:49,920
On your behalf.

3189
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,460
Get this fucking house.

3190
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,580
This is our fucking house.

3191
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,560
We have a house.

3192
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,820
I even washed all of our...

3193
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:02,660
I want this as well.

3194
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:03,360
I want everything.

3195
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:04,580
We're taking everything.

3196
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:05,680
We are TSM.

3197
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:06,660
We can hold everything.

3198
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:08,260
Look at these guys.

3199
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,040
I wash all of my...

3200
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,500
How dare you crypto.

3201
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:13,800
You know who I am.

3202
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:14,880
I'm Imperial High.

3203
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,120
Imperial RPR.

3204
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,740
Tell me if they pushing you.

3205
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,040
They're not gonna push.

3206
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,800
I think they're getting ult charge off... not ult charge.

3207
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:22,400
Shield charge.

3208
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,600
I wash up left side.

3209
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,020
If you have a nade, break their door.

3210
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:27,500
But they're just gonna wall it back.

3211
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:28,920
Yeah, so what?

3212
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:30,560
I'm gonna shoot them in the window.

3213
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:31,480
The door is broken.

3214
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:35,680
Why are you coming back with this stupid fucking drone?

3215
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,420
Because they have the resources.

3216
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,420
Well, there's a nade here.

3217
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:40,320
You wanna use it.

3218
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:43,700
You're better at aiming the nade than us.

3219
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:45,260
Yes.

3220
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,140
Apparently.

3221
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,080
That's how it works.

3222
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:51,400
Pro players have good aim on everything.

3223
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:54,280
There's an indicator.

3224
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:56,420
Oh, they broke the door.

3225
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:57,600
Shoot them.

3226
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:01,240
They did the door thing.

3227
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,080
Yeah, we knew that was gonna happen.

3228
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,760
Then what's the point of nading the door?

3229
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:12,000
Because maybe in the second that I broke the door, I could see one of them and one clip them.

3230
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:13,000
But you didn't.

3231
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:17,840
I'm gonna go to the other side.

3232
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,220
It's a fucking... it's a gamble.

3233
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:23,320
I hate it here.

3234
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,100
I'm gonna hold here.

3235
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:29,920
You guys hold there.

3236
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:30,400
Okay.

3237
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:35,380
Wait, there was... here, here, here.

3238
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,260
Here, there.

3239
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,900
Kill those motherfuckers now.

3240
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:41,080
We need help.

3241
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:41,540
We need help.

3242
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,300
He's jumping up.

3243
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:46,200
I know one.

3244
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:46,620
I know one.

3245
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:47,100
Nice.

3246
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:50,060
We go together.

3247
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:50,880
Three, two, one.

3248
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:52,040
Okay, zip take now.

3249
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:52,280
Go.

3250
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:52,860
Okay, okay.

3251
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:55,120
I'm with RPR.

3252
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:57,200
One HP Bang.

3253
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:57,800
One HP Bang.

3254
01:44:58,420 --> 01:44:59,000
Bang is one.

3255
01:44:59,080 --> 01:44:59,500
I got a heal.

3256
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,360
He wants to kill me so bad.

3257
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,360
He's a hater.

3258
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,100
I got a heal drone now for you.

3259
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:06,540
Whoops.

3260
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,180
That was interesting.

3261
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:14,060
That guy wanted to take me down with him.

3262
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,200
It was some hater shit.

3263
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:18,100
He was straight hating.

3264
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:19,420
What did you do?

3265
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:21,640
Why is he hating on you?

3266
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:22,840
I don't know.

3267
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:25,560
Some toxic shit these VTubers.

3268
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:26,160
I swear to God.

3269
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:27,740
Yeah, so toxic.

3270
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:29,640
Oh, I got purple guys.

3271
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,300
What's the third person?

3272
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,560
Why do we see two dead boxes?

3273
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,280
Third person is on the ground, maybe?

3274
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:38,240
Oh, Dita is...

3275
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,500
Oh, there's an alt-xl.

3276
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:40,060
Do we need it?

3277
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,140
You guys stay here.

3278
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:43,540
I'm gonna hold this.

3279
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,700
You guys are gonna hold the house.

3280
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:45,360
There's a hatch.

3281
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:48,720
You guys are gonna move it to zone.

3282
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,060
You guys are gonna move it to zone.

3283
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:51,060
Someone's on my right.

3284
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:53,700
I already have this spot.

3285
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:54,260
What the fuck?

3286
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,340
But they're in the zone there.

3287
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:58,340
Okay, I'm heading over to you, RPR.

3288
01:45:58,740 --> 01:45:59,520
No, no, no, no.

3289
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:00,220
Are you listening?

3290
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:01,520
No, I forgot.

3291
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:05,140
You guys hold the fucking house and you move it to zone.

3292
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,900
Okay, I heard you this time.

3293
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,240
Wait, they're behind this rock.

3294
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:09,600
Yeah.

3295
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:10,220
Yeah.

3296
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,080
They're looking at us.

3297
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,080
I'm on my way.

3298
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:14,580
They're looking at me right here.

3299
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:17,420
Why the fuck are they looking?

3300
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,240
Who the fuck...

3301
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,780
Dita, why are you here?

3302
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:22,500
I don't know, but I'm by myself now here.

3303
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,400
Now this is insanity.

3304
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,060
No!

3305
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,480
I'm making a port to dodge this stupid fucking Bangalore roll.

3306
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:35,240
I'm making a port to dodge this stupid fucking Bangalore roll.

3307
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:35,540
Bangalore's low.

3308
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:36,160
Bangalore's low.

3309
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:36,700
Bangalore's low.

3310
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:37,100
Bangalore's low.

3311
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:37,940
They got Kipto Ood.

3312
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:41,060
Bangalore, I almost cracked Bangalore.

3313
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:42,380
It's okay.

3314
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:42,680
It's okay.

3315
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:43,300
They're pushing.

3316
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:43,600
They're pushing.

3317
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:44,480
Bloodhound pushing.

3318
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:45,260
On me.

3319
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:45,500
On me.

3320
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:45,800
On me.

3321
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:47,300
I cracked the fuck out of him.

3322
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:49,820
I got a bat.

3323
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:52,180
I'm on the side of the wall, by the way.

3324
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:53,720
They're gonna push us through.

3325
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:54,300
Everyone come here.

3326
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:54,980
Okay.

3327
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:55,540
I'm coming back.

3328
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:56,900
They're on me.

3329
01:46:58,380 --> 01:46:59,160
Oh my god.

3330
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:00,040
I got beamed.

3331
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:00,760
Got one.

3332
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:01,640
Nice one.

3333
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,820
I need help.

3334
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:03,460
I need help, RPR.

3335
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,260
Oh...

3336
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:07,180
Ameen.

3337
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:08,180
Ameen.

3338
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:09,500
I was with you.

3339
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:10,840
I was with you.

3340
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:12,680
What did you expect from me?

3341
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,600
I was with you.

3342
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:15,300
I got beamed.

3343
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,200
It was Verhulst again.

3344
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:22,300
Verhulst.

3345
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:25,240
Why were you not thinking?

3346
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:26,500
They're Hulst.

3347
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,100
You have no more damage, Verhulst.

3348
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,120
They're Hulst.

3349
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:38,620
It's the controller player again.

3350
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,480
It's Evan!

3351
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:42,080
It's Evan!

3352
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,480
All I'm saying is that I was with Imperial RPR.

3353
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,000
Good job!

3354
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,040
Nah, this probably got beaten by this controller Andy.

3355
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,860
Hey, who's Raven then?

3356
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:00,240
We don't have Raven.

3357
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:00,880
We don't have the budget for that.

3358
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:01,680
That's why we're losing!

3359
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:02,780
We don't have Raven!

3360
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:04,360
We don't have the budget for that shit!

3361
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:06,080
Where's Slave?

3362
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:07,660
Where's your Raven?

3363
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:11,100
Maybe if we won this scrim we would have the budget for it.

3364
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,600
Hel took all the budget!

3365
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,280
That's why we have Imperial RPR.

3366
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:22,640
He went to Dark Zero and took everything.

3367
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,980
He took all the budget, guys!

3368
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:26,560
Fucking asshole!

3369
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:29,980
I can't believe it.

3370
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:32,220
What is this fight?

3371
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:33,440
What am I watching?

3372
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:34,480
I don't fucking know.

3373
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,060
Wait, they won that.

3374
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:37,140
Wait, what?

3375
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:38,220
They got traded.

3376
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:42,060
Why couldn't we be the team that didn't have to fight everybody?

3377
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44,660
Because we got pushed and there's...

3378
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:48,840
Sometimes in life you get pushed and you have to win the push.

3379
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:51,820
And that's what the Apex is all about.

3380
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:53,900
How come we didn't win the push?

3381
01:48:53,980 --> 01:48:54,960
We listened to you.

3382
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:57,880
Oh wait, somebody didn't listen.

3383
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,280
I don't think we need lifelike.

3384
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,500
Listen, I don't know.

3385
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:00,860
I don't know.

3386
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,920
I don't know what you want me to do.

3387
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:04,380
I knocked one and cracked two people in that fight.

3388
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,880
I really can't do more than that.

3389
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:06,140
I knocked the other.

3390
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,400
I got my one.

3391
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,540
You didn't knock anyone.

3392
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,300
There was two guys alive.

3393
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:11,800
I got my one.

3394
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,040
I helped you.

3395
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:14,020
Who did you knock?

3396
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:14,320
Yourself?

3397
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:15,240
I covered you.

3398
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:17,900
To get you your one.

3399
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:21,460
Okay, I knocked my one.

3400
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:24,480
Now it turned into I covered you.

3401
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:27,660
So you could get your one.

3402
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,420
I think we...

3403
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:32,340
We could win Bangalore.

3404
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:34,080
Yeah, I agree.

3405
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:37,640
And Watsons or another character.

3406
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:40,720
Okay, Doki, you're not playing Bangalore.

3407
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:42,220
What am I playing?

3408
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:43,980
Bangalore.

3409
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:44,800
I'm playing Bangalore?

3410
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:45,440
Nice.

3411
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:47,880
Honestly, I agree.

3412
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,100
And yeah, sure.

3413
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:51,360
That's going to be so much better.

3414
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,680
I will play Watsons.

3415
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:55,980
Why would you play Watsons?

3416
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:57,780
We need Bloodhound.

3417
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:01,580
We need Bangalore and Bloodhound.

3418
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:03,660
So we can smoke them then wallhack them.

3419
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:04,720
Yeah.

3420
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:07,100
I agree with the Bloodhound pick.

3421
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:09,840
No, how about another one?

3422
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,560
The last character.

3423
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,340
I'm playing Wraith.

3424
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:14,920
Wraith.

3425
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:16,980
Because Portal is important.

3426
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:19,300
We have Bangalore smokes.

3427
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:21,180
Yeah, okay.

3428
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:25,180
So you're telling me Bangalore smoke is going to port us across the planet?

3429
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:26,840
Yes.

3430
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:27,760
Okay.

3431
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:31,660
Guys, it seriously isn't a team comp thing.

3432
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:34,640
We're not losing to team comp right now.

3433
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:37,860
Okay, to be fair, Ditto didn't...

3434
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:41,440
Derholz didn't listen to that last comp to be fair.

3435
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,140
I would admit.

3436
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:45,680
I listen.

3437
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:48,200
Listen, listen.

3438
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:50,400
Bangalore, Wraith.

3439
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:51,120
This is fine.

3440
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:51,680
It works.

3441
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:52,520
Wait.

3442
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:54,860
Bangalore, Wraith, Bloodhound.

3443
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:56,620
Okay, Ditto, you're Bloodhound.

3444
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:57,340
I'm going to play Bloodhound.

3445
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:58,260
No, I'm going to play Bloodhound.

3446
01:50:58,340 --> 01:50:58,620
Yeah, okay.

3447
01:50:58,700 --> 01:50:59,420
Yeah, you're Bloodhound.

3448
01:50:59,520 --> 01:50:59,900
I'm going to play Bang.

3449
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:00,780
Wait, no.

3450
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:01,980
I want to play Bloodhound.

3451
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,100
I want to play Bloodhound.

3452
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,620
I'm going to play Pathfinder.

3453
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:06,600
No, you're playing Wraith.

3454
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:07,980
You need to be on Wraith.

3455
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,620
No, I'm way better on Pathfinder.

3456
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,980
No, but what about the Portal?

3457
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:14,160
We have Ziplines.

3458
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:15,920
But the Portals were important.

3459
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:17,880
Yeah, but Ziplines.

3460
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:19,780
Okay, alright, Chelsea.

3461
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:20,940
Okay, go Zipline.

3462
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:23,580
I'll show you.

3463
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:25,500
This map is made for Pathfinder.

3464
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:27,000
Okay.

3465
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,500
I'll show you.

3466
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:29,880
This is scrims.

3467
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,300
We have two more games to win a game.

3468
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:33,600
This is scrims.

3469
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,220
We're trying things out.

3470
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:36,920
It's scrims.

3471
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:37,860
We're trying things out.

3472
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:39,320
We're sixth place.

3473
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:42,320
Who's fourth is the half, huh?

3474
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:44,000
We're sixth place.

3475
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:46,080
That's okay.

3476
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,000
It's a scrim.

3477
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:49,980
But you can win if we win.

3478
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:51,500
We won two games.

3479
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:53,800
No, we won one game.

3480
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:55,220
We won one game, Ditto.

3481
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:56,720
No, two more games.

3482
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:57,620
Oh, yeah.

3483
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:57,860
Okay.

3484
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:58,900
Two more games for us to win.

3485
01:51:58,980 --> 01:51:59,260
You're right.

3486
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:01,000
Yeah, this time and next time.

3487
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,480
Yeah, and I'm going to play Pathfinder.

3488
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,780
If we can't lose, I'll show you the sauce.

3489
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:06,460
Okay, so what do we play then?

3490
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,240
Angler and Bloodhound.

3491
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,200
How did you forget already?

3492
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,060
I don't get it.

3493
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:10,860
I don't know.

3494
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:14,500
You were saying Wraith and then suddenly you swapped to Pathfinder.

3495
01:52:14,540 --> 01:52:16,820
So I assume there's going to be more swaps.

3496
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:21,220
I swapped my character, not yours.

3497
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:25,300
Okay, I will play more.

3498
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:26,240
Well, I can save, okay?

3499
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:28,120
I will shoot everyone.

3500
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:30,120
You guys are...

3501
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:34,920
You're complaining when I play Wraith, then you don't want to play Path.

3502
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:36,060
What do you want me to do?

3503
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:37,900
I'm the fucking in-game leader.

3504
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:38,880
I decide what I do.

3505
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:42,620
You're saying different comps now, so I'm confused.

3506
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:44,440
Because we're scrimming.

3507
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:46,220
This is all about trying shit out.

3508
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:50,700
Yeah, but then you said we didn't need to try new things out because it worked.

3509
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:54,900
Yeah, but you guys are so hellbent on trying things out, so now we're really trying things out.

3510
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:55,660
I was fine.

3511
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,560
I was fine with doing whatever.

3512
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:01,160
No, but like, Dito was clearly not satisfied with our team comps, so now we're trying things out.

3513
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,840
Okay, well...

3514
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:04,880
I'm trying, I'm trying.

3515
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,240
So who are we blaming then?

3516
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:07,900
No one.

3517
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:09,860
Why do you want to blame people?

3518
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:11,700
Why can't we just focus on winning?

3519
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:13,320
Wait, what am I playing?

3520
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:13,720
What am I playing?

3521
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:14,100
Bangalore?

3522
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:16,600
Yes, Bangalore.

3523
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:17,680
Yes, yes, yes.

3524
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:20,900
You wanted to play Bloodhound, didn't you?

3525
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:22,680
I'm so confused.

3526
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:24,020
I'm so confused.

3527
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,640
Which one do you want to play?

3528
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,360
Joki.

3529
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:35,660
There's so many swaps, I'm getting confused.

3530
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:38,960
We swapped the one game.

3531
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:42,260
Nothing changed.

3532
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:50,800
Oh my god, you're frying my brain so that I don't have any left.

3533
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:24,440
I'm going to play Bloodhound.

3534
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:30,020
Yes, you're frying my brain so that I don't have any left.

3535
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:30,060
Bye.

3536
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:32,480
I just got overwhelmed because we keep changing stuff.

3537
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,260
Team Rocket is already dead!

3538
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,220
Oh, they got contested.

3539
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:39,780
Prepare for trouble!

3540
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:41,120
Make it double!

3541
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:43,160
Wait, they got contested.

3542
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:47,380
Why are they dead?

3543
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:49,400
Because they got contested.

3544
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:50,900
Oh, I see.

3545
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:51,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3546
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,460
You can contest people if you want to.

3547
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,100
Oh, I see.

3548
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:55,680
Yeah.

3549
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:58,800
Why there's no one contesting us?

3550
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,340
Because they're scared of us.

3551
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,080
I don't know why.

3552
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,940
Why the fuck would they contest us when they know they're gonna lose?

3553
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:09,900
But we lost.

3554
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,100
But if we lost...

3555
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:13,920
Oh, Jesus Maria.

3556
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:15,960
Yeah, yeah, okay.

3557
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:16,520
We lost.

3558
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:17,040
I get it.

3559
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:17,520
We get it.

3560
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:18,120
We lost.

3561
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:19,240
You like losing?

3562
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:21,000
No, that's why I won.

3563
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,360
So why do you keep repeating that we lost?

3564
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:24,820
Because I was just fact-checking you.

3565
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:26,520
Fact-checking?

3566
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:28,620
This is really bad.

3567
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:29,920
I'm gonna go for the team morale right now.

3568
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:38,180
I am Lucy.

3569
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:40,840
Calm down, Arp here.

3570
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:41,640
Calm down.

3571
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,380
It's just a game.

3572
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:44,820
I will fight you.

3573
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:49,680
Oh, hey, there's a Havoc.

3574
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:51,960
Are they?

3575
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:52,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3576
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:53,900
There's two Havocs.

3577
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,640
I like Havoc.

3578
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,180
I want both.

3579
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:00,120
Both are my speed.

3580
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,600
I'm on Flatline 301.

3581
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:02,740
I will shoot you.

3582
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:05,460
Flatline 301.

3583
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,560
I need both on my speed.

3584
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:09,440
I want Prowler.

3585
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,540
I want Prowler actually.

3586
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:12,180
I like Prowler.

3587
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,800
I need energy ammo.

3588
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:17,780
There's a lot of energy on this area.

3589
01:56:18,980 --> 01:56:19,540
Good.

3590
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:24,860
Hey, people are donating to me for your therapy funds.

3591
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,600
Just send it over to my PayPal.

3592
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:30,680
I'll use it properly.

3593
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:31,720
It's called alcohol.

3594
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,180
Guys, don't worry.

3595
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:37,600
I'm here to raise funds for Arp's therapy.

3596
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:42,040
It will go straight towards him if you donate your Super Chats to me.

3597
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,840
There's no therapy in life.

3598
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:44,780
You just drink it off.

3599
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:45,500
And you forget.

3600
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:49,340
Arp, you didn't ping.

3601
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:50,300
Yeah.

3602
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:50,920
Ping what?

3603
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:52,100
Ping what?

3604
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:52,580
Mastiff.

3605
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:53,500
Mastiff.

3606
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:54,000
Yeah.

3607
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,440
Why the fuck would you want Mastiff?

3608
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,120
Play Mera.

3609
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:57,600
Why?

3610
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,920
I want to use Mastiff.

3611
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:01,060
Why?

3612
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:02,700
I want to use Mastiff.

3613
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,040
I'm going to go here with the beacon.

3614
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:12,600
I'm going to grab a battery.

3615
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,760
If you found a vault, tell me.

3616
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,340
I know where there's a vault.

3617
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:19,760
There's energy here.

3618
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:20,940
I saw a vault earlier.

3619
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:21,980
There's a key.

3620
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:22,500
I'll use Mastiff.

3621
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,340
I can't use a survey beacon because we're in White Arms.

3622
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:27,260
I have a scan.

3623
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:28,400
Yeah, scan.

3624
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:29,660
And then we can get blue.

3625
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:32,400
Pathfinder can't do shit until he gets blue armor.

3626
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:33,560
Useless fuck.

3627
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:35,560
You still need the Mastiff.

3628
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:35,920
Oh my god, guys.

3629
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:36,700
Oh wait, here.

3630
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,240
There's a gold one here.

3631
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:39,860
Does anyone want that?

3632
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:40,340
Oh my god, that's great.

3633
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:41,340
Up here.

3634
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:42,960
Ping it.

3635
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:43,640
You want that?

3636
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:44,780
Do what?

3637
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:45,460
What do I want?

3638
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:46,640
Energy.

3639
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:47,680
Energy magazine.

3640
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:48,460
Yes.

3641
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:48,880
Yes.

3642
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:49,580
I like that.

3643
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:50,840
Great.

3644
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:51,880
I'm here, guys.

3645
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:52,860
Your best teammate.

3646
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:53,840
I will drop a purple one.

3647
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:55,420
I will drop a purple one.

3648
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:56,060
Alright.

3649
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,580
One team there.

3650
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:01,060
There's a lot of teams doing the storm catcher.

3651
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:02,620
Okay.

3652
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:05,300
Maybe we can go gap that one.

3653
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:06,000
Yeah, go grab.

3654
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,380
We need armor, we're literally poor.

3655
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:09,360
They're so poor.

3656
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:11,020
We're so poor.

3657
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:12,500
Yes.

3658
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:15,440
We need a wellness check.

3659
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,120
I'm okay.

3660
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:21,680
Okay, I'm gonna go gap Giamma.

3661
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:22,340
I need therapy.

3662
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:23,780
I'm gonna help.

3663
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:24,720
Okay.

3664
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,280
I got blue.

3665
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:27,620
Yeah!

3666
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:29,380
What do you need the blue for?

3667
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,020
I don't speak to stupid.

3668
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:53,000
If you have anything smart to say, I'll answer.

3669
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:55,160
And not these stupids that are gonna be answered.

3670
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:59,200
But like, a stupid person can get smarter by educating them.

3671
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:01,520
They say no questions are dumb.

3672
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,460
You proved it wrong just now.

3673
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:11,920
You're not teaching me anything, so I'll stay stupid forever.

3674
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,540
Oh fuck it, you've been playing this game for five years.

3675
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:18,060
But you've been playing it professionally for five years.

3676
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,020
You know what the...

3677
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,320
Ah, I refuse.

3678
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:30,940
I refuse.

3679
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:39,610
Where's the zone ending?

3680
01:59:39,870 --> 01:59:39,890
I'm moving along.

3681
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:41,530
With or without you.

3682
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:43,770
I'm right here.

3683
01:59:43,890 --> 01:59:44,550
What are you saying?

3684
01:59:44,550 --> 01:59:45,050
What are you saying?

3685
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:46,270
We're right behind you.

3686
01:59:46,370 --> 01:59:47,670
You didn't see me.

3687
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:48,310
Yeah!

3688
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:50,530
How could you ignore Ditto like that?

3689
01:59:50,590 --> 01:59:51,250
I'm moving with or without you.

3690
01:59:51,570 --> 01:59:53,330
How could you ignore her like that?

3691
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:53,970
Yeah, what the fuck?

3692
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:56,230
Fine.

3693
01:59:56,230 --> 01:59:56,470
Fine.

3694
01:59:57,910 --> 01:59:59,330
Wait, why did you guys close the door?

3695
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:00,530
From me.

3696
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:00,970
Oh, me too.

3697
02:00:01,170 --> 02:00:01,510
I'm sorry.

3698
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:06,370
She slammed the door in your face.

3699
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:09,850
Do we need alt-accel?

3700
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:10,270
Nah.

3701
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:14,530
I don't think we need alt-accel.

3702
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:15,670
No.

3703
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:17,430
We wait here for 12 seconds.

3704
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:19,650
Okay.

3705
02:00:21,090 --> 02:00:22,030
Where should we go next?

3706
02:00:23,850 --> 02:00:25,870
Well, he said we gotta wait here for 12 seconds.

3707
02:00:26,410 --> 02:00:26,850
Okay.

3708
02:00:27,990 --> 02:00:29,610
Wait, you have that airline?

3709
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:30,170
You paid money?

3710
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:31,630
I just said it five seconds ago.

3711
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,350
I just said it.

3712
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:32,590
No.

3713
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:33,090
See?

3714
02:00:33,110 --> 02:00:33,750
That's just me.

3715
02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:34,770
I listened.

3716
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:37,730
I literally listened.

3717
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:38,990
Go back?

3718
02:00:39,690 --> 02:00:40,130
Okay.

3719
02:00:41,330 --> 02:00:42,810
I knew what was going on.

3720
02:00:44,430 --> 02:00:45,750
Great job, doggy.

3721
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:46,990
Like, for once, you listened.

3722
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:49,770
Only took six games.

3723
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:50,370
Five.

3724
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:51,710
Five.

3725
02:00:51,930 --> 02:00:53,010
There's someone on my left here.

3726
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:54,190
These guys need to die.

3727
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:54,910
Okay.

3728
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:55,850
I got shot.

3729
02:00:55,870 --> 02:00:56,710
What the fuck?

3730
02:00:56,730 --> 02:00:57,170
I got shot.

3731
02:00:57,270 --> 02:00:57,770
I need a heal.

3732
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:59,010
Wait, hold up.

3733
02:00:59,050 --> 02:00:59,730
I gotta go back.

3734
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:00,430
I can see.

3735
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:01,550
I can see.

3736
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:02,050
Come here.

3737
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:02,290
Come here.

3738
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:03,570
I'm gonna ult them.

3739
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:07,210
These motherfuckers are angry at us for no reason.

3740
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:08,190
Now we gotta kill them.

3741
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:09,550
They're gonna come inside now.

3742
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:11,310
Are they?

3743
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:12,210
I don't know.

3744
02:01:12,330 --> 02:01:13,030
I ulted.

3745
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:15,270
How much do they have of death wish?

3746
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:17,670
I'm worried about behind us, too.

3747
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:18,550
Why are they here?

3748
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:21,730
What the fuck could they possibly be doing here?

3749
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:23,870
Why am I lagging?

3750
02:01:23,870 --> 02:01:24,970
Yeah, you're lagging.

3751
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:25,450
Yeah, yeah.

3752
02:01:25,590 --> 02:01:26,470
I see them.

3753
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:26,850
They're outside.

3754
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:27,690
Wait.

3755
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:28,630
No, they're not.

3756
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:31,210
What the fuck are they, girl?

3757
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:32,590
You hear that?

3758
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:33,410
There was a vibration.

3759
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:35,850
Let's go.

3760
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:37,790
Why are you shooting at me, bro?

3761
02:01:38,070 --> 02:01:38,690
Where are they?

3762
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:40,110
Here.

3763
02:01:40,150 --> 02:01:40,670
Hit a hundred.

3764
02:01:40,810 --> 02:01:41,170
Conduit.

3765
02:01:41,950 --> 02:01:42,730
They're coming over?

3766
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:44,050
Right here.

3767
02:01:44,110 --> 02:01:44,410
Behind us.

3768
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:45,350
She went inside the house.

3769
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:46,630
These guys need to die.

3770
02:01:47,410 --> 02:01:47,810
Okay.

3771
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:47,810
Okay.

3772
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:48,330
Why don't we die?

3773
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:49,370
Okay.

3774
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:50,130
Okay.

3775
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:53,150
I think murder is about to happen.

3776
02:01:54,270 --> 02:01:55,910
Oh, I shot fucking Ditto.

3777
02:01:56,130 --> 02:01:57,730
I'm starting with this.

3778
02:01:58,110 --> 02:01:58,730
Never mind.

3779
02:01:58,770 --> 02:01:59,310
I can't do that.

3780
02:01:59,350 --> 02:01:59,970
They removed that.

3781
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:00,450
Fuck.

3782
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:01,570
What did they remove?

3783
02:02:02,370 --> 02:02:03,610
I can't go on the... on the...

3784
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:04,970
They're re-deploying.

3785
02:02:05,190 --> 02:02:06,530
I'm not gonna let them do that.

3786
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:08,630
30 on the Watson.

3787
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:09,430
Conduit cracked.

3788
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:10,430
Slow.

3789
02:02:11,730 --> 02:02:12,510
Ooh, careful.

3790
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:14,570
I cracked... I cracked all of them.

3791
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:15,130
All of them are cracked.

3792
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:15,970
Oh, shit.

3793
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:16,330
You're right.

3794
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:18,410
No, that's just two Conduits.

3795
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:19,550
Am I right?

3796
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:21,570
Oh, my God.

3797
02:02:21,590 --> 02:02:21,990
It got stuck.

3798
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:23,850
A Conduit flash on me.

3799
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:24,270
115.

3800
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:24,610
It's okay.

3801
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:24,950
It's okay.

3802
02:02:26,010 --> 02:02:26,370
Roof.

3803
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:30,690
That Bloodhound is sitting every Wingman shot in the world.

3804
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:32,650
I need a... I need a heal.

3805
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:35,510
I'm getting a better spot.

3806
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:39,350
I'm coming back.

3807
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:40,170
I want these guys dead.

3808
02:02:40,930 --> 02:02:41,690
That's a different team.

3809
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:42,150
Chill here.

3810
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:42,530
Chill here.

3811
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:43,130
That's a different team.

3812
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:43,530
Oh, okay.

3813
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:43,810
Okay.

3814
02:02:44,110 --> 02:02:45,010
You stay over here.

3815
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:47,590
I'm gonna go back a little bit.

3816
02:02:48,010 --> 02:02:49,670
I'm gonna be here so I can...

3817
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:50,770
Let this team knock them.

3818
02:02:50,850 --> 02:02:51,650
They just knocked them.

3819
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:55,870
Look at that Evac.

3820
02:02:57,150 --> 02:02:57,530
Okay.

3821
02:02:57,710 --> 02:02:58,230
I'm looking.

3822
02:02:58,730 --> 02:02:59,710
There's no way that person...

3823
02:02:59,710 --> 02:02:59,890
They're even.

3824
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:00,870
No way.

3825
02:03:00,930 --> 02:03:02,150
He's... That's... That's crazy.

3826
02:03:02,370 --> 02:03:02,410
Yeah.

3827
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:03,170
That was crazy.

3828
02:03:04,270 --> 02:03:05,630
One person took the...

3829
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:05,870
They're taking two.

3830
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:07,190
That was... That's only two here.

3831
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:07,590
People here.

3832
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:08,310
We should fight them now.

3833
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:09,050
Okay.

3834
02:03:09,090 --> 02:03:09,310
Okay.

3835
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:10,370
There's only two people on the right side.

3836
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:11,070
I'm almost down.

3837
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:13,230
Where's his teammate, though?

3838
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:14,230
Oh?

3839
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:16,910
Did we get... Did they get tripped by one guy?

3840
02:03:17,450 --> 02:03:18,330
Fucking... I don't know.

3841
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:19,690
I don't know.

3842
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:20,630
What the fuck is going on?

3843
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:22,930
What is going on here?

3844
02:03:23,110 --> 02:03:23,550
I don't know.

3845
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:23,850
I'm losing it.

3846
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:26,970
Give me that.

3847
02:03:26,970 --> 02:03:26,990
I'm loosing.

3848
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:27,670
Loot.

3849
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:29,430
I am lagging so bad.

3850
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:30,110
You are.

3851
02:03:30,130 --> 02:03:30,930
I hear it.

3852
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:32,310
This is why we're losing too.

3853
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:33,290
Am I... Is my voice lagging?

3854
02:03:33,330 --> 02:03:33,650
Yeah.

3855
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:34,670
Your voice is lagging a little.

3856
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:35,730
You're going robot.

3857
02:03:37,050 --> 02:03:37,450
Really?

3858
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:37,810
She's making...

3859
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:38,950
Where are we going, by the way?

3860
02:03:39,810 --> 02:03:41,390
I don't have bat anymore.

3861
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:41,730
Oh, here.

3862
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:42,330
I got you.

3863
02:03:42,970 --> 02:03:43,650
I got two.

3864
02:03:44,890 --> 02:03:45,290
Okay.

3865
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:46,790
Thank you.

3866
02:03:47,550 --> 02:03:49,110
I think my internet is fucked.

3867
02:03:49,690 --> 02:03:50,270
Oh, no.

3868
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:51,470
That's not good.

3869
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:55,470
How are you gonna kill everybody for us?

3870
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:57,510
There was a fucking storm today.

3871
02:03:57,710 --> 02:03:59,030
There's a... I'm gonna replay.

3872
02:04:00,130 --> 02:04:01,250
Yeah, I have a replay.

3873
02:04:02,630 --> 02:04:03,330
Go zone.

3874
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:06,610
I'm looking behind us just in case.

3875
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:09,830
Oh my god, I'm lagging.

3876
02:04:09,930 --> 02:04:11,090
I'm gonna sue someone.

3877
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:17,710
Oh my god, this is on purpose.

3878
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:20,370
They're doing this to sue me on purpose every time.

3879
02:04:20,670 --> 02:04:22,250
This is like East Coast servers.

3880
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:24,650
So you even have like the benefits too.

3881
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:27,030
Yeah, I don't know why I'm lagging.

3882
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:29,770
I think it's like... I told you there's a massive storm today.

3883
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:31,490
I'm not.

3884
02:04:31,770 --> 02:04:33,390
But I'm lagging in Discord too.

3885
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:35,850
I told you there's a massive storm today.

3886
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:36,970
It fucked something up.

3887
02:04:36,970 --> 02:04:37,910
Now I'm lagging.

3888
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:39,450
Oh no.

3889
02:04:40,570 --> 02:04:41,390
That's not good.

3890
02:04:41,590 --> 02:04:43,710
The fucking electricity in the air is a machine.

3891
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:44,730
I don't know how science works.

3892
02:04:45,530 --> 02:04:46,270
Let's go here.

3893
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:47,770
Okay.

3894
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:49,590
We're right behind you.

3895
02:04:50,710 --> 02:04:52,910
There's probably people in these houses, right?

3896
02:04:53,350 --> 02:04:54,430
We got reapplied.

3897
02:04:54,430 --> 02:04:54,630
You wanna play?

3898
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:56,230
No.

3899
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:58,190
I wanna walk.

3900
02:04:59,190 --> 02:05:03,730
Yeah, but I wanna walk and see what's in front of us before we evac into someone's face and die.

3901
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:06,910
That wouldn't happen, right?

3902
02:05:08,690 --> 02:05:09,130
Nope.

3903
02:05:09,170 --> 02:05:10,630
That never happens to anyone.

3904
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:14,050
Just like that one team that landed on us didn't die when they landed on us.

3905
02:05:14,690 --> 02:05:16,050
Yeah, but that was on purpose.

3906
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:18,230
Yeah, they wanted to die.

3907
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:20,450
No, they thought they could kill us.

3908
02:05:22,010 --> 02:05:23,630
They blocked this door off.

3909
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,130
That's weird.

3910
02:05:24,130 --> 02:05:27,850
Why would you let us play too?

3911
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:29,430
Dang it.

3912
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:32,410
I'm gonna watch our back.

3913
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:33,570
Oh, they're evacing on my left.

3914
02:05:33,670 --> 02:05:34,450
That's murder time.

3915
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:37,090
I don't think they have a compact.

3916
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:39,750
Oh, there's a team above them.

3917
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:40,010
That's why.

3918
02:05:40,430 --> 02:05:40,890
Okay.

3919
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:42,390
I'm gonna watch our back.

3920
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:45,670
God, I hate lagging.

3921
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:47,430
It makes my blood boil.

3922
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:48,350
That guy's one.

3923
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:49,330
Broke down.

3924
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:50,350
I hit 10.

3925
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:51,070
He was not one.

3926
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:52,610
You're gonna fly?

3927
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:53,070
You're lying.

3928
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:53,470
Okay.

3929
02:05:53,510 --> 02:05:54,110
He was... Oh, okay.

3930
02:05:54,130 --> 02:05:54,490
He was 12.

3931
02:05:54,710 --> 02:05:55,490
Like, we won't be...

3932
02:05:55,490 --> 02:05:55,710
You're gonna fight?

3933
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:56,890
We'll fight?

3934
02:05:57,210 --> 02:05:58,210
No, we're just poking.

3935
02:05:58,450 --> 02:05:58,830
We're just poking.

3936
02:05:58,830 --> 02:05:59,770
Poking, poking, poking.

3937
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:02,530
Oh, they're fighting down here.

3938
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:03,470
There's downs.

3939
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:03,950
There's downs.

3940
02:06:03,970 --> 02:06:04,270
We go.

3941
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:05,030
Okay.

3942
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:06,390
I watch our back.

3943
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:07,390
One team dead.

3944
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:08,410
I'm heading over.

3945
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:09,110
Nice one.

3946
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:11,050
I don't think we can anymore.

3947
02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:11,370
Okay.

3948
02:06:11,410 --> 02:06:12,030
I'm heading back.

3949
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:13,310
My armor's fucked.

3950
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:15,390
Word champ.

3951
02:06:15,430 --> 02:06:16,130
I smoked our backs.

3952
02:06:16,130 --> 02:06:17,070
Ditto, where are you?

3953
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:19,050
I'm watching our back.

3954
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:20,430
I'm watching our back.

3955
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:24,070
Tell me if you wanna fight.

3956
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:24,870
I will go there.

3957
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:26,610
What the fuck?

3958
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:27,870
What?

3959
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:28,730
Okay.

3960
02:06:28,850 --> 02:06:31,450
I want to watch our back anymore.

3961
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:31,770
Okay?

3962
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:34,270
If we get third body, I...

3963
02:06:34,270 --> 02:06:35,710
So don't blame me.

3964
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:44,990
You didn't even say to me that...

3965
02:06:44,990 --> 02:06:47,830
No, I totally wasn't talking the entire time.

3966
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:48,650
I wasn't talking.

3967
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:51,350
I was just imagining that part.

3968
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:52,570
Wait, they have red armor.

3969
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:54,670
Kill these guys.

3970
02:06:55,130 --> 02:06:56,070
Red armor cracked.

3971
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:57,190
Okay, okay.

3972
02:06:57,190 --> 02:06:57,450
We're good.

3973
02:06:57,450 --> 02:06:57,810
Close to me.

3974
02:06:57,930 --> 02:06:58,210
Close to me.

3975
02:06:58,390 --> 02:06:59,050
I'm ulting.

3976
02:06:59,230 --> 02:06:59,730
Right below me.

3977
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:00,250
Right below me.

3978
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:00,710
Right below me.

3979
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:02,030
This is Daryl.

3980
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:02,390
Daryl.

3981
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:02,490
Daryl.

3982
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:02,490
Daryl.

3983
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:04,490
I gotta pull back because they're so horny.

3984
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:05,390
Daryl.

3985
02:07:05,390 --> 02:07:05,610
Daryl.

3986
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:06,090
By the way.

3987
02:07:06,650 --> 02:07:07,350
I'm safe here.

3988
02:07:07,410 --> 02:07:07,710
Ditto.

3989
02:07:07,810 --> 02:07:08,010
Ditto.

3990
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:08,250
Ditto.

3991
02:07:08,330 --> 02:07:08,530
Ditto.

3992
02:07:08,750 --> 02:07:09,110
Ditto.

3993
02:07:09,110 --> 02:07:10,270
Ditto's way up ahead.

3994
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:13,210
Oh my gosh.

3995
02:07:14,930 --> 02:07:15,510
Left side.

3996
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:16,070
Left side, I think.

3997
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:16,270
On me?

3998
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:16,690
Left side.

3999
02:07:16,730 --> 02:07:16,950
Left side.

4000
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:17,190
Yeah, yeah.

4001
02:07:17,310 --> 02:07:17,470
Yeah.

4002
02:07:17,470 --> 02:07:17,910
In a small...

4003
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:18,550
How could he see me?

4004
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:18,630
He's like...

4005
02:07:18,650 --> 02:07:19,390
How could he see through smoke?

4006
02:07:20,950 --> 02:07:21,810
Wait, what?

4007
02:07:22,730 --> 02:07:24,070
How is he seeing through smoke?

4008
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:24,350
Yeah.

4009
02:07:24,350 --> 02:07:25,050
What the fuck is that?

4010
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:27,570
What the fuck?

4011
02:07:27,610 --> 02:07:28,210
I might be dead.

4012
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:28,910
He might push me.

4013
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:29,150
He's pushing.

4014
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,450
He's pushing.

4015
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:30,590
He thought you were gonna push.

4016
02:07:31,230 --> 02:07:31,590
Yeah.

4017
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:32,690
That's some bullshit.

4018
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:33,530
Like, what is this guy doing?

4019
02:07:33,530 --> 02:07:33,850
What the...

4020
02:07:33,850 --> 02:07:36,590
Yeah, he saw me through his own smoke.

4021
02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:37,930
I was like, what?

4022
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:41,110
It's the fucking classic controller bullshit.

4023
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:42,050
They can do everything.

4024
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:45,810
It's unbelievable.

4025
02:07:46,670 --> 02:07:48,570
It's that same Bangler that killed us last game.

4026
02:07:48,590 --> 02:07:48,630
Yeah.

4027
02:07:48,630 --> 02:07:50,470
I mean, I'm not gonna kill you, Pac.

4028
02:07:50,490 --> 02:07:50,930
Just once.

4029
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:53,210
I thought you were gonna fly, so I push.

4030
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:56,450
And you leave me.

4031
02:07:56,610 --> 02:07:57,130
That's true.

4032
02:07:57,310 --> 02:07:59,050
Ditto, Ditto, I got hit for 150.

4033
02:07:59,730 --> 02:08:00,650
Like, do you want me to die?

4034
02:08:01,650 --> 02:08:02,430
But I...

4035
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:03,010
I...

4036
02:08:04,090 --> 02:08:07,130
I came to you, to call for you, but you leave me.

4037
02:08:07,310 --> 02:08:07,590
Yeah.

4038
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:08,630
I got...

4039
02:08:08,630 --> 02:08:09,930
I got shot.

4040
02:08:10,170 --> 02:08:11,310
I'm sorry I got shot.

4041
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:12,530
Like, what do I do?

4042
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:16,510
Oh my God.

4043
02:08:17,210 --> 02:08:17,970
What are you, like...

4044
02:08:17,970 --> 02:08:18,390
Hey, hey, hey.

4045
02:08:18,450 --> 02:08:18,610
Ditto, Ditto...

4046
02:08:19,890 --> 02:08:25,010
Guys, maybe it's not... guys, I don't know, this team comp... I don't know, I think it's a team comp issue.

4047
02:08:26,050 --> 02:08:29,750
Okay, I hear one more team comp issue, I'm going to run and stole my life.

4048
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:34,850
Oh, actually, I want you to tell me if we are going to fight or not fight, okay?

4049
02:08:39,810 --> 02:08:42,810
I feel like I was talking the entire time what we're doing.

4050
02:08:44,150 --> 02:08:45,310
What we're doing?

4051
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:46,430
Yeah, I... listen.

4052
02:08:46,430 --> 02:08:50,570
I said we're going to third party this team while they were fighting and...

4053
02:08:50,570 --> 02:08:53,430
But you... but you... you tell me that you're going to poke them.

4054
02:08:54,010 --> 02:09:01,910
Yes, we poke them together and then we... when we find the right moment, we push them when they're fighting.

4055
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:04,810
Yeah, but... but when... when is the right moment?

4056
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:06,030
You didn't tell me.

4057
02:09:06,230 --> 02:09:07,130
When they're fighting.

4058
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:08,810
When they're fighting.

4059
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:09,770
But when?

4060
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:10,250
When?

4061
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:12,210
But I said they were fighting.

4062
02:09:13,730 --> 02:09:15,590
You have to say go now.

4063
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:17,070
We have to fight now.

4064
02:09:17,070 --> 02:09:18,430
What do you want from me?

4065
02:09:18,470 --> 02:09:19,530
You're not listening.

4066
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:20,610
It doesn't matter what I say.

4067
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:21,890
You're not going to listen.

4068
02:09:22,230 --> 02:09:22,690
I'm listening.

4069
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:23,510
I'm listening.

4070
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:26,110
I'm listening.

4071
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:31,730
But... just two, like... okay, we fight.

4072
02:09:31,890 --> 02:09:32,290
We fight.

4073
02:09:32,290 --> 02:09:35,470
I said everything I was doing, like what more can I do?

4074
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:36,290
I can't.

4075
02:09:36,290 --> 02:09:36,690
I can't.

4076
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:37,370
I'm going to lose it.

4077
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:39,110
I can't.

4078
02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:39,890
I'm going to give up.

4079
02:09:47,570 --> 02:09:48,690
I'll play Blood.

4080
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:49,630
I'll play Bloodhound.

4081
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:51,010
I want to wash our back.

4082
02:09:51,110 --> 02:09:53,330
I want... I want to go with you.

4083
02:09:58,250 --> 02:10:00,010
Like how is it always my fault?

4084
02:10:00,090 --> 02:10:00,590
This is insane.

4085
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:01,870
You are lagging.

4086
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:03,330
We go now, but go what?

4087
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:03,970
Go where?

4088
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:04,790
Go now.

4089
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:06,750
Go now, what do you mean go now?

4090
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:06,910
Go me.

4091
02:10:07,230 --> 02:10:07,810
Go me.

4092
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:09,010
I want you to tell me when you do it.

4093
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:09,910
I'll do it with this button.

4094
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:11,750
I'll do it with this button.

4095
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:12,390
I'll do it with this button.

4096
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:13,610
You're saying that.

4097
02:10:13,930 --> 02:10:14,350
Seriously.

4098
02:10:14,850 --> 02:10:15,830
I don't know how to do it.

4099
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:18,110
What do you mean you don't know?

4100
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:19,710
I don't know where to go.

4101
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:20,630
I don't know where to go.

4102
02:10:21,170 --> 02:10:24,150
I'll go back, or I'll go forward, or right, left, where?

4103
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:26,910
So, I'll go where?

4104
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:28,750
Go now, but go where?

4105
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:29,290
Where?

4106
02:10:29,490 --> 02:10:30,530
Are your ears okay?

4107
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:33,590
They're okay.

4108
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:37,290
I said it properly, left.

4109
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:39,910
When?

4110
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:43,290
I said come here, they're fighting.

4111
02:10:45,370 --> 02:10:47,450
Yeah, I went to you.

4112
02:10:50,610 --> 02:10:53,090
You were looking at the back.

4113
02:10:54,270 --> 02:10:57,370
Yeah, because there might be third party.

4114
02:10:57,690 --> 02:10:58,370
You know?

4115
02:10:58,950 --> 02:11:00,070
Third party.

4116
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:01,890
We are third party.

4117
02:11:02,170 --> 02:11:04,550
We are third party.

4118
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:08,670
We can be third party if we third party, you know?

4119
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:11,950
Yeah, we can be third party.

4120
02:11:11,950 --> 02:11:12,830
Come here, you have to go.

4121
02:11:13,390 --> 02:11:14,670
Everyone, come here.

4122
02:11:14,830 --> 02:11:17,810
I thought you talked to doggy, you know?

4123
02:11:17,930 --> 02:11:23,150
Because you were with doggy, so I thought you were talking to doggy.

4124
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:25,570
Because I told you that I was washing our bag.

4125
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:29,570
So, if you want, you have to tell me.

4126
02:11:29,910 --> 02:11:30,650
My fault.

4127
02:11:30,910 --> 02:11:37,330
From now on, I'm going to tell everyone what to do at every given moment.

4128
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:38,830
I'm going to use your name.

4129
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:42,650
I'm going to tell you, come here, this guy, push this guy.

4130
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:57,630
And I'm going to say, doggy come here, Dito come here, Dito push here, doggy push here, Dito throw nades, doggy throw nades, Dito shoot that guy, doggy shoot that guy, Dito res me, doggy throw me a drone.

4131
02:11:57,790 --> 02:11:59,670
Like, what am I supposed to do?

4132
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:01,010
Think for you guys?

4133
02:12:01,170 --> 02:12:02,350
That's all we wanted.

4134
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:03,610
That's all we wanted.

4135
02:12:03,950 --> 02:12:05,310
No, no, just tell me.

4136
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:07,150
Only tell me, okay?

4137
02:12:07,330 --> 02:12:08,150
Dito, we fight.

4138
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:09,610
Everyone, we fight.

4139
02:12:09,890 --> 02:12:10,690
Only this.

4140
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:16,070
I said, Dito, I said we're going to poke these guys.

4141
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:20,870
We, as our team, one, two, three, three people.

4142
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:24,310
But we can't be for two people.

4143
02:12:24,590 --> 02:12:26,550
Like you and doggy, can we be?

4144
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:27,490
We as well.

4145
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:33,370
Why would I say we if I meant only two people?

4146
02:12:35,710 --> 02:12:37,230
We, you and doggy.

4147
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:37,310
We.

4148
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:40,090
We is the whole team.

4149
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:43,350
It's you, me and doggy.

4150
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:44,150
Okay.

4151
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:44,550
Okay.

4152
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:46,630
Okay.

4153
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:47,910
Maybe I'm the host.

4154
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:50,570
When you say we, I will follow you, okay?

4155
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:51,910
Yes, perfect.

4156
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:52,890
Thank you.

4157
02:12:54,070 --> 02:12:54,630
Okay.

4158
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:01,090
Alright, we solved the problem.

4159
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:01,990
We solved the problem.

4160
02:13:02,410 --> 02:13:02,530
Now we go next game.

4161
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,910
We.

4162
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:04,350
We.

4163
02:13:04,350 --> 02:13:05,110
I.

4164
02:13:06,030 --> 02:13:07,410
Watch our back.

4165
02:13:07,510 --> 02:13:07,630
We.

4166
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:09,770
W, okay.

4167
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:11,230
Okay.

4168
02:13:11,230 --> 02:13:12,650
Okay, listen, it's really simple.

4169
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:16,090
If I say we go here, then the whole team go here.

4170
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:19,750
If I say Dito watch back, then you watch back.

4171
02:13:20,010 --> 02:13:20,290
Okay.

4172
02:13:20,290 --> 02:13:22,690
If I say doggy go right, then doggy goes right.

4173
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:26,050
But if I say we, that means all three of us go somewhere.

4174
02:13:26,370 --> 02:13:26,890
Okay.

4175
02:13:27,070 --> 02:13:27,510
Okay.

4176
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:29,010
Okay, easy?

4177
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:30,330
Yes.

4178
02:13:30,610 --> 02:13:32,110
Yes, I got it.

4179
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:32,870
I got it.

4180
02:13:33,190 --> 02:13:33,330
I got it.

4181
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:36,810
I understand.

4182
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:39,670
Okay, so...

4183
02:13:39,670 --> 02:13:41,330
Do you understand anything?

4184
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:42,470
Doki!

4185
02:13:42,850 --> 02:13:43,470
Yeah.

4186
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:45,290
I wanna be Bloodhound.

4187
02:13:46,630 --> 02:13:47,250
Okay.

4188
02:13:47,510 --> 02:13:48,750
I'll be Bangor.

4189
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:49,290
Yeah.

4190
02:13:54,050 --> 02:13:55,430
Again, we're changing comp.

4191
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:57,770
Cause like we're figuring things out.

4192
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:58,770
That's what you said.

4193
02:13:59,150 --> 02:13:59,310
Why?

4194
02:13:59,570 --> 02:14:01,350
What do we do?

4195
02:14:02,110 --> 02:14:02,350
Okay.

4196
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:04,150
I'm Bloodhound.

4197
02:14:04,250 --> 02:14:04,630
It's okay.

4198
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:05,350
Listen.

4199
02:14:05,790 --> 02:14:06,510
Uh-huh.

4200
02:14:06,570 --> 02:14:08,490
Listen, this is why scrims exist.

4201
02:14:08,670 --> 02:14:09,950
So we fix this problem.

4202
02:14:10,090 --> 02:14:10,590
You see?

4203
02:14:10,690 --> 02:14:12,970
We are fixing problems right now.

4204
02:14:14,350 --> 02:14:14,870
Okay?

4205
02:14:15,810 --> 02:14:16,330
Okay.

4206
02:14:16,450 --> 02:14:17,990
Why is my game trying to end itself?

4207
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:22,230
What are our problems?

4208
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:25,790
You mainly.

4209
02:14:25,810 --> 02:14:26,750
Because Asha said me.

4210
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:27,050
Me?

4211
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:28,110
What did I do?

4212
02:14:28,330 --> 02:14:29,690
I was just listening.

4213
02:14:30,570 --> 02:14:32,170
You were just starting shit.

4214
02:14:33,190 --> 02:14:36,630
I didn't even start anything this time.

4215
02:14:37,010 --> 02:14:40,670
You just started arguments in the team 24-7.

4216
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:42,530
I didn't even start anything.

4217
02:14:42,770 --> 02:14:46,710
I didn't even start anything this time.

4218
02:14:49,010 --> 02:14:53,710
You see, Dito is confused and you're making me mad.

4219
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:56,970
And then it's just your fault at the end of the day.

4220
02:14:57,130 --> 02:14:57,790
Like it's really...

4221
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:59,430
At the end of the day...

4222
02:14:59,430 --> 02:14:59,830
We just need a Raven.

4223
02:14:59,830 --> 02:15:00,610
Everything is your fault.

4224
02:15:00,970 --> 02:15:02,130
We need a Raven.

4225
02:15:02,150 --> 02:15:03,390
We need a coach.

4226
02:15:04,070 --> 02:15:05,950
We don't need a fucking coach.

4227
02:15:06,170 --> 02:15:07,190
We need you to focus.

4228
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:09,310
We need TSM Raven.

4229
02:15:10,010 --> 02:15:14,970
Doki, for the five games we played, you have been focused for three minutes max.

4230
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:17,010
I was so focused last game.

4231
02:15:17,230 --> 02:15:19,190
I was with you the entire time.

4232
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:23,850
That was 45 seconds that you were focused.

4233
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:24,730
Yeah.

4234
02:15:24,870 --> 02:15:26,650
So it wasn't my fault this time.

4235
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:29,250
It's nobody's fault.

4236
02:15:29,490 --> 02:15:31,230
Why does it have to be someone's fault?

4237
02:15:36,390 --> 02:15:39,030
Why do we have to give the fault to someone?

4238
02:15:39,210 --> 02:15:41,830
Why can't we just die and it was like unlucky?

4239
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:42,850
Let's go next.

4240
02:15:43,010 --> 02:15:44,190
Because we're TSM.

4241
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:46,850
That's what happened in TSM.

4242
02:15:48,450 --> 02:15:50,230
We are low paying TSM.

4243
02:15:50,570 --> 02:15:53,270
Yeah, TSM there's always somebody's fault in TSM.

4244
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:55,310
I'm not ready for TSM.

4245
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:57,030
But we'll be famous.

4246
02:15:57,490 --> 02:15:59,330
We're gonna be on top.

4247
02:15:59,510 --> 02:16:00,670
I wanna go back to scars.

4248
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:01,750
I wanna go back to scars.

4249
02:16:02,350 --> 02:16:03,010
What do you mean?

4250
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:04,970
Okay.

4251
02:16:06,470 --> 02:16:09,070
I'm going back to when things were easier in life.

4252
02:16:10,130 --> 02:16:11,710
Guys, we're eighth place.

4253
02:16:14,370 --> 02:16:16,130
Guys, what happened to us?

4254
02:16:16,370 --> 02:16:17,550
We fell off just like TSM.

4255
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:19,450
Why are you so focused on our placement?

4256
02:16:19,530 --> 02:16:20,530
You just wanna ruin our mood.

4257
02:16:20,530 --> 02:16:22,470
Guys, we're just like TSM.

4258
02:16:22,990 --> 02:16:25,010
You just wanna ruin our mood.

4259
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:27,710
You're just trying to ruin this team from the inside.

4260
02:16:27,870 --> 02:16:28,990
It's an inside job.

4261
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:29,770
No, it's not.

4262
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:31,910
I'm trying to motivate us to do better.

4263
02:16:33,950 --> 02:16:35,990
You have to be calm now, okay?

4264
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:36,970
When you're already...

4265
02:16:36,970 --> 02:16:37,750
I'm calm.

4266
02:16:40,790 --> 02:16:42,030
Just be more cool.

4267
02:16:42,570 --> 02:16:43,490
Be more cool.

4268
02:16:44,270 --> 02:16:46,770
Okay, so what do you want me to do?

4269
02:16:46,830 --> 02:16:48,130
How do I get more calmer?

4270
02:16:48,170 --> 02:16:48,510
Breathe in.

4271
02:16:50,430 --> 02:16:51,510
Count to ten.

4272
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:53,990
Okay.

4273
02:16:54,590 --> 02:17:02,310
It's like I have this fucking devil on my shoulder called Doki just trying to...

4274
02:17:04,110 --> 02:17:08,630
Dito, do you not listen to what this dumbass is asking me throughout the entire match?

4275
02:17:08,870 --> 02:17:09,270
What did I say?

4276
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:10,610
Why do you need blue armor?

4277
02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:11,590
Why do you need this?

4278
02:17:11,670 --> 02:17:12,330
Why do you need that?

4279
02:17:12,450 --> 02:17:13,170
Blah blah blah blah.

4280
02:17:13,690 --> 02:17:13,690
Why?

4281
02:17:13,690 --> 02:17:15,070
She's asking questions from a crew.

4282
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:15,930
She's just asking.

4283
02:17:16,450 --> 02:17:17,030
She's just asking.

4284
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:18,270
Why would I need blue armor?

4285
02:17:18,390 --> 02:17:18,730
Why?

4286
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:20,750
Why?

4287
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:22,050
Why would I need it?

4288
02:17:22,070 --> 02:17:22,850
Why would I need it?

4289
02:17:22,890 --> 02:17:23,090
Please tell me.

4290
02:17:23,090 --> 02:17:25,670
I understand what was the important part about having blue armor.

4291
02:17:26,490 --> 02:17:28,590
Why can you answer her properly?

4292
02:17:29,210 --> 02:17:30,390
Yeah, why can't you answer?

4293
02:17:30,890 --> 02:17:31,370
Hey!

4294
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:33,370
She's just asking.

4295
02:17:33,590 --> 02:17:34,830
She just wanted to know.

4296
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:35,790
I was just curious.

4297
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:38,190
I wanted to expand my knowledge.

4298
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:40,670
Because you're IGL and I look up to you.

4299
02:17:43,170 --> 02:17:44,450
I look up to you.

4300
02:17:44,610 --> 02:17:45,870
So I wanted to know more.

4301
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:48,270
Yeah, she didn't know.

4302
02:17:48,610 --> 02:17:48,790
Yeah.

4303
02:17:49,150 --> 02:17:51,010
How did she not know?

4304
02:17:51,050 --> 02:17:52,690
Dito, how did she not know this?

4305
02:17:52,730 --> 02:17:53,070
How did she not know?

4306
02:17:53,090 --> 02:17:54,090
Please tell me.

4307
02:17:54,110 --> 02:17:55,350
Please explain how this...

4308
02:17:55,350 --> 02:17:57,390
I was playing Tekken last week.

4309
02:17:57,570 --> 02:17:59,710
She hasn't been playing Apex Mobile Y.

4310
02:18:00,070 --> 02:18:03,730
So in one week she forgot what armor does in this video.

4311
02:18:04,330 --> 02:18:05,730
It happens sometimes.

4312
02:18:05,890 --> 02:18:07,030
Yeah, sometimes it happens.

4313
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:07,950
Yeah.

4314
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:15,350
Dito, I don't know if you're crazy like her or like you're fucking with me right now.

4315
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:17,690
Team Sevier Monero.

4316
02:18:20,270 --> 02:18:21,410
With TSM.

4317
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:25,350
I'm lagging in the air.

4318
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:26,990
This is insane.

4319
02:18:27,350 --> 02:18:28,690
How many ping do you have?

4320
02:18:29,450 --> 02:18:29,950
180.

4321
02:18:31,190 --> 02:18:31,690
180?

4322
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:32,930
It's not that laggy.

4323
02:18:33,090 --> 02:18:34,850
Yeah, but I'm also like lost.

4324
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:35,550
I have lost.

4325
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:39,150
Oh, like everyone is teleporting?

4326
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:41,010
Yes, it's the same shit.

4327
02:18:44,310 --> 02:18:46,750
They're Dito-sting me because we won the first game.

4328
02:18:47,090 --> 02:18:48,930
Yeah, we peaked early guys.

4329
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:50,170
Just like TSM.

4330
02:18:50,690 --> 02:18:51,490
Yeah, maybe that happened.

4331
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:53,110
I think we won the first game and I've been lagging.

4332
02:18:53,490 --> 02:18:53,890
Coincidence?

4333
02:18:54,050 --> 02:18:54,730
I don't think so.

4334
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:57,410
Yeah, we should like DDoS the other teams.

4335
02:18:59,470 --> 02:18:59,870
Yes.

4336
02:18:59,930 --> 02:19:02,510
Okay, I went playing Massive.

4337
02:19:04,690 --> 02:19:07,370
Oh hey, there's a bot.

4338
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:08,150
I like bot.

4339
02:19:08,930 --> 02:19:10,970
Oh, I'm gonna do Repeater.

4340
02:19:13,290 --> 02:19:14,490
Actually, I should do Nemesis.

4341
02:19:14,730 --> 02:19:15,010
No.

4342
02:19:15,650 --> 02:19:16,230
Actually, no.

4343
02:19:16,310 --> 02:19:17,050
I want Carbine.

4344
02:19:20,170 --> 02:19:20,650
I'm gonna do Carbine.

4345
02:19:20,650 --> 02:19:22,910
You took 14 years of my life.

4346
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:24,130
Who?

4347
02:19:24,830 --> 02:19:25,310
You.

4348
02:19:25,530 --> 02:19:25,890
Me?

4349
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:27,570
I didn't argue with you this time.

4350
02:19:28,730 --> 02:19:32,650
You made me get into an argument with Dito which took 14 years of my life.

4351
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:32,870
I made...

4352
02:19:33,810 --> 02:19:35,990
What did I do to that argument?

4353
02:19:35,990 --> 02:19:37,430
You instigated all the time.

4354
02:19:37,450 --> 02:19:38,990
I did not instigate this time.

4355
02:19:39,930 --> 02:19:41,350
I literally was just chilling.

4356
02:19:43,590 --> 02:19:46,610
I was minding my own business listening in.

4357
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:52,120
I have Nemi...

4358
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:55,780
Okay, but we learned something today.

4359
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:56,120
What did we learn?

4360
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:58,100
We means us.

4361
02:19:58,800 --> 02:19:59,380
Yeah.

4362
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:02,240
You means you and me means me.

4363
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:04,240
Wait, who's you?

4364
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:05,900
Who is you?

4365
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:06,780
Me or Doki?

4366
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:08,420
Oh yeah, me or Ditto.

4367
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:10,340
Yes, exactly.

4368
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:16,320
So if I say you Doki or you Ditto, that means I'm talking to you.

4369
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:17,600
Oh, okay.

4370
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:18,740
Yeah, I got it.

4371
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:19,320
Okay.

4372
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:23,900
See, look, we're fixing a communication problem before the tournament.

4373
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:24,340
Yeah.

4374
02:20:24,460 --> 02:20:26,440
Basic English is now done.

4375
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:27,840
Now we can move on.

4376
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:29,280
Yeah.

4377
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:30,300
Yeah.

4378
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:32,320
Finally.

4379
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:34,260
I am lagging so much.

4380
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:34,920
It's insane.

4381
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:35,960
I can't do anything.

4382
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:39,840
Tell them to pause the game like ALGS so you can fix your internet.

4383
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:43,940
No, this is a fucking planned attack from the inside.

4384
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:44,920
They're Dittosing me.

4385
02:20:45,180 --> 02:20:46,160
Dittos them back.

4386
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:47,160
Hit up destroyer.

4387
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:49,620
Yeah, we're best friends.

4388
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:51,680
Yeah, do you guys not know that chat?

4389
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:54,200
RPR actually knows destroyer.

4390
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:56,180
Yeah, we hang out.

4391
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:57,280
And like, what's his name?

4392
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:57,660
Tufi?

4393
02:20:58,660 --> 02:20:59,340
Yeah, Tufi.

4394
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:00,160
Best buddy.

4395
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:02,120
Tufi is EU, right?

4396
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:04,680
Tufi is a fucking idiot.

4397
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:05,280
That's what he is.

4398
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:09,380
Do I want the Raven's charges ultimate or double the duration?

4399
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:13,800
Duration of scan is more important.

4400
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:14,400
Okay.

4401
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:17,140
When you scan people, you can see them for a longer time.

4402
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:33,920
You're going to need more time, right?

4403
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:33,940
All right.

4404
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:34,560
I need a fucking message now.

4405
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:34,980
What?

4406
02:21:38,540 --> 02:21:39,500
Oh, it's going to be.

4407
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:39,620
You know what?

4408
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:39,840
Let's see.

4409
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:40,060
We're all done for today.

4410
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:45,140
Yay, oh my gosh.

4411
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:46,780
Okay.

4412
02:21:46,780 --> 02:21:49,260
Can you like call... wait, can Zero be our coach?

4413
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:50,840
Can Zero be our Raven?

4414
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:51,260
No.

4415
02:21:51,740 --> 02:21:52,460
Why not?

4416
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:54,940
I actually have a tournament this Saturday.

4417
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,580
Right before we play, I have to play with Zero and Hardeki.

4418
02:21:58,800 --> 02:21:59,160
Yeah!

4419
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:01,360
So like why can't Zero coach us?

4420
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:04,020
Because he doesn't care.

4421
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:06,680
He would care if you say it's...

4422
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:07,500
Why would he care?

4423
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:08,960
Because he's your friend.

4424
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:10,980
Okay, and?

4425
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:14,400
So friends should look out for each other.

4426
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:15,800
Is that what friendship is about?

4427
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:16,900
No.

4428
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:19,420
Wait, then what's it about?

4429
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:21,820
That's what they tell you in the kindergarten.

4430
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,140
In real life, you're like the friendship is all about people...

4431
02:22:25,880 --> 02:22:27,380
having a use out of you.

4432
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:30,640
The best way they can utilize you.

4433
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:33,840
And once they no longer have a use for you, you're no longer friends.

4434
02:22:34,220 --> 02:22:37,020
Wait, but then like... then why can't we use Zero?

4435
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:40,880
Because he's busy.

4436
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:44,560
You don't know that.

4437
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,840
He was free to play that...

4438
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:46,260
I know that.

4439
02:22:46,780 --> 02:22:48,060
You don't know that.

4440
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:48,620
You didn't ask.

4441
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:54,300
Wait, oh, he's your friend with benefits!

4442
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:57,340
He's your friend with benefits!

4443
02:22:58,340 --> 02:23:01,120
No, what the fuck are you on about?

4444
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:03,400
That's what you said!

4445
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:05,640
Is that what it meant?

4446
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:08,500
No, that's not what it meant.

4447
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:09,560
It meant that like...

4448
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:13,640
you're only friends with people while you're interesting to them.

4449
02:23:13,740 --> 02:23:16,000
Once you stop being interested in them, they move on.

4450
02:23:16,220 --> 02:23:17,700
Just like everyone in life.

4451
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:19,120
And then you just lose friends.

4452
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:20,600
And you find more friends.

4453
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:22,240
And you keep cycling them.

4454
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,360
Because people move on.

4455
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,300
There's people in front of us.

4456
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:27,300
Fuck them.

4457
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:28,220
Are they gonna move on?

4458
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:29,240
Fuck them.

4459
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:29,420
Go.

4460
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:30,840
They're like on this.

4461
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:32,740
So they might take that.

4462
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:33,960
Okay.

4463
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:34,620
Oh, yeah.

4464
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:37,360
Wait, they're looking at us.

4465
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:39,880
Why do you guys look at us?

4466
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:40,260
105!

4467
02:23:40,540 --> 02:23:40,800
105!

4468
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:42,400
I got shot.

4469
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,880
Wait, that bloodhound lost...

4470
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:45,860
One more keg.

4471
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:48,860
Wait, what the fuck is that guy doing?

4472
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:50,200
I can't predict this.

4473
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:50,820
This is insane.

4474
02:23:51,460 --> 02:23:52,260
63 flash.

4475
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:52,640
62?

4476
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:54,840
Last guy.

4477
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:55,420
Last guy 1 HP.

4478
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:56,260
I need to reload.

4479
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:57,280
I have to reload.

4480
02:23:57,400 --> 02:23:58,420
Why are they smoking?

4481
02:23:58,500 --> 02:23:58,960
Vape Nation.

4482
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:01,100
Flashed.

4483
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:01,540
One flash.

4484
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:01,980
Oh, no.

4485
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:02,680
They're so lucky.

4486
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:05,560
Oh, I need G.

4487
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:06,180
Ace.

4488
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:08,760
There's nobody behind us.

4489
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:11,720
What if I zip on the roof and we just fucking go all out?

4490
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,020
This is our last game.

4491
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:14,500
Exactly.

4492
02:24:15,860 --> 02:24:16,760
We got balls deep.

4493
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:17,500
Oh, yeah.

4494
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:18,220
I shouldn't do that.

4495
02:24:18,380 --> 02:24:18,860
They're watching.

4496
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:19,240
They're watching.

4497
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:20,580
Yeah, I don't know if we should.

4498
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:23,520
Yeah, but we bait them with the zip line.

4499
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:25,420
Then I get an angle.

4500
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:28,680
Headshot someone for 175 to the head.

4501
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:31,140
And then we just destroy them.

4502
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:31,760
Okay.

4503
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:35,740
We're waiting for the destroy part.

4504
02:24:35,860 --> 02:24:36,920
I'm using my Ocha.

4505
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:39,460
I'm charging my Sentinel.

4506
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:40,920
Wait, there's people behind us.

4507
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:42,520
Why are they behind us?

4508
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:44,780
Yeah, there's a redeployed behind us.

4509
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:45,100
88.

4510
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:45,720
88.

4511
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:46,940
Why do they have purple?

4512
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:47,680
They just had blue.

4513
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:48,280
Now they have purple.

4514
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:49,680
No, they avoid that purple.

4515
02:24:50,740 --> 02:24:53,100
There's people behind us redeploying, by the way.

4516
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:54,980
Yeah, people behind us are almost dead.

4517
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:02,800
Give me that head.

4518
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:03,400
Give me the head.

4519
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:04,920
What do we do?

4520
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,200
Waiting for this team to like make a mistake and then murder them.

4521
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:13,160
What if they don't make a mistake?

4522
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:14,100
They will.

4523
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,460
They always make mistakes.

4524
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:16,220
Okay.

4525
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:17,500
Fucking cheater.

4526
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:18,440
Oh.

4527
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,680
You call everyone cheater.

4528
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:27,560
If he dies, he dies to a cheater.

4529
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:28,620
Oh my god.

4530
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:29,120
I can't see.

4531
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:30,380
I can't see through the wall.

4532
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:31,620
Wait, this guy is blue.

4533
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:33,980
You can see through the wall then shoot them.

4534
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:35,280
Yeah, shoot them.

4535
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:35,860
What is that?

4536
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:36,400
What is that?

4537
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:38,020
Oh my god.

4538
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:39,720
Oh my leg.

4539
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:40,620
What is that?

4540
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:41,540
Can we shoot that?

4541
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:42,260
88 purple.

4542
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:42,720
Shoot it.

4543
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:42,760
Shoot it.

4544
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:43,160
Do it.

4545
02:25:43,480 --> 02:25:44,760
88 purple cracked.

4546
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:45,480
I need a heal.

4547
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:46,180
Who's next?

4548
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:46,860
Who's next?

4549
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:49,180
I'm scared.

4550
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:49,960
Come on guys.

4551
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:50,520
Peek again.

4552
02:25:50,780 --> 02:25:51,360
Come on.

4553
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:53,440
Oh my god.

4554
02:25:53,460 --> 02:25:54,160
This lag is insane.

4555
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:56,520
I'm gonna go see if there's extra shield assist.

4556
02:25:56,900 --> 02:25:57,580
Oh, he's shooting through the wall.

4557
02:25:57,580 --> 02:25:59,020
He shoots me from through the wall.

4558
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:00,480
Are they shooting?

4559
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:01,760
No.

4560
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:02,860
There's a gap in that wall.

4561
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:04,240
There's a gap in that wall.

4562
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:04,300
Hit them Ben.

4563
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:07,120
Hit them.

4564
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:08,680
Kick out of the tournament.

4565
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:09,480
Oh, right.

4566
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:09,740
Yes.

4567
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:11,040
88 cracked Bangalore.

4568
02:26:12,580 --> 02:26:15,460
I'm going to juice all of their meds until they can not.

4569
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:18,060
I need to fucking find more shield cells.

4570
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:19,640
I'm going to go back and explore.

4571
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:20,180
Okay.

4572
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:21,300
I can give you three.

4573
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:22,460
Oh, nice.

4574
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:25,300
Please do not explore the afterlife.

4575
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:30,780
They stopped peeking.

4576
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:31,380
All right.

4577
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:33,940
In 10%, I'm going to give us a zip that's going to go down.

4578
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:34,160
Okay.

4579
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:35,100
Should we go near?

4580
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:38,800
Yeah, sure.

4581
02:26:39,260 --> 02:26:40,140
I'm heading over.

4582
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:42,260
We're here.

4583
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:45,380
2%.

4584
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:46,100
1%.

4585
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:47,140
Okay.

4586
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:48,600
Okay.

4587
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:49,900
You first.

4588
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:51,460
We want to get ahead of them and...

4589
02:26:52,220 --> 02:26:53,200
Why are they smoking?

4590
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:54,340
They're vape nation again.

4591
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:56,140
Why are they shooting at us?

4592
02:26:56,780 --> 02:26:57,920
I don't know, but...

4593
02:26:58,500 --> 02:27:05,100
We want to get ahead of them and take control of the positioning and then gatekeep them out of the fucking zone.

4594
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:07,260
They're smoking behind us.

4595
02:27:07,980 --> 02:27:08,780
We're going to...

4596
02:27:08,780 --> 02:27:10,320
I don't think anyone is going to come from behind us.

4597
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:10,940
There is.

4598
02:27:11,060 --> 02:27:12,240
I don't think they're going to come to us.

4599
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:12,900
Are they coming?

4600
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:14,180
They're on the bridge.

4601
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:14,920
Like the...

4602
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:17,120
The bridge behind us.

4603
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:17,800
The left bridge?

4604
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:19,240
Yeah, see the lifeline package?

4605
02:27:20,060 --> 02:27:20,380
Is that a mobi?

4606
02:27:20,380 --> 02:27:20,600
Oh, yeah.

4607
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,100
Yeah, but there's two T's there.

4608
02:27:22,580 --> 02:27:23,460
Do I head to you?

4609
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:23,840
And...

4610
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:25,480
You guys can...

4611
02:27:25,480 --> 02:27:26,960
Someone can stay on the bridge there.

4612
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:27,700
Okay, I'll stay.

4613
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:29,580
I just want these guys not to come here.

4614
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:31,040
I don't want them to fucking come to us.

4615
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:31,920
They're racing.

4616
02:27:32,020 --> 02:27:33,300
They're racing behind us.

4617
02:27:33,460 --> 02:27:34,200
Oh, they are racing.

4618
02:27:34,460 --> 02:27:34,920
Yeah, yeah.

4619
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:35,320
They're racing.

4620
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:36,180
It is a mobi.

4621
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:38,440
I thought it was...

4622
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:40,600
I'm going to stay here then.

4623
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:41,980
Well, that guy is going to...

4624
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:42,800
One of them is going to be broke.

4625
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:43,560
Here.

4626
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:43,980
Oh, okay.

4627
02:27:43,980 --> 02:27:44,160
Okay.

4628
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:44,840
I'm looking.

4629
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:46,700
I will stay with Doggy.

4630
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:48,300
Yeah, you can stay with Doggy.

4631
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:48,720
We're back on the bridge.

4632
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:50,280
I can grapple back.

4633
02:27:52,100 --> 02:27:52,780
I'm going to scan.

4634
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:53,800
What the fuck?

4635
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:54,980
Yeah, what the fuck?

4636
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:56,300
Yeah, I'm bullying the fuck out of this team.

4637
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:57,800
Who fucking shot you?

4638
02:27:58,100 --> 02:27:58,760
Over here.

4639
02:27:59,240 --> 02:27:59,900
Over there.

4640
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:01,060
War and Ping.

4641
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:02,180
Well, I'll deal with them later.

4642
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:03,540
Right now, I'm dealing with this team.

4643
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:06,400
There's a team underneath that bridge.

4644
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:07,320
Okay.

4645
02:28:07,640 --> 02:28:08,960
I'm going to go to you, Doggy.

4646
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:09,720
Yeah.

4647
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:13,360
Oh, they have crypto.

4648
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:13,840
Just be ready.

4649
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:14,140
Did they have crypto?

4650
02:28:14,140 --> 02:28:14,760
Okay, this team might push me.

4651
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:17,500
Wait, there's a team in the cave too.

4652
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:19,100
Yeah, that's fine.

4653
02:28:19,220 --> 02:28:20,260
They're not going to deal with us.

4654
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:22,940
Just be ready to...

4655
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:22,980
They almost tagged.

4656
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:23,340
They almost changed.

4657
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:26,840
If I get pushed here, be ready to fight this team.

4658
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:29,200
I'm looking at the team in the cave.

4659
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:30,540
Are they teaming?

4660
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:31,880
Fucking cheaters.

4661
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:32,840
Yeah.

4662
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:33,980
These guys have to move.

4663
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:36,600
So now be ready to get closer to me.

4664
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:36,960
Be ready.

4665
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:37,760
This team might push.

4666
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,180
Okay.

4667
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:39,020
I'm going to come over now.

4668
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:40,700
I'm here.

4669
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:43,140
Yeah, just stay on that side of the bridge.

4670
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:44,120
And then this guy is going to come over.

4671
02:28:44,140 --> 02:28:45,980
Guys, I mean, we can even play from here.

4672
02:28:46,100 --> 02:28:46,740
All of us.

4673
02:28:46,740 --> 02:28:48,980
We just want these guys to fuck off.

4674
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:49,460
Okay.

4675
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:51,040
Go through the fucking tunnel.

4676
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:51,760
Okay, over there.

4677
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:52,740
One team over there.

4678
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:54,060
On our right side.

4679
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:55,040
Is it three people?

4680
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:56,240
Yeah.

4681
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:56,820
Three people.

4682
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:57,760
Yeah, I see them.

4683
02:28:57,780 --> 02:28:58,220
They're crossing.

4684
02:28:58,440 --> 02:28:59,900
Yeah, they're going around.

4685
02:29:01,060 --> 02:29:01,460
Yeah.

4686
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:02,720
Yeah, fuck them.

4687
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:03,280
They went to the building.

4688
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:05,540
We just want to keep that and this.

4689
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:08,340
Yeah, these guys are coming out.

4690
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:09,220
Okay.

4691
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:09,740
We're here.

4692
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:10,160
They're jumping out.

4693
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:11,580
They are going to the tunnel I think.

4694
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:12,960
No, they are pushing me.

4695
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:14,500
Come here.

4696
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:16,560
We are looking for you.

4697
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:19,360
They smoked as well.

4698
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:21,260
We killed these guys.

4699
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:21,820
We have to.

4700
02:29:21,860 --> 02:29:22,440
We have no choice.

4701
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:23,920
Use blood on ult.

4702
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:24,480
Use blood on ult.

4703
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:30,460
They are close.

4704
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:31,660
They needed.

4705
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:36,880
They can pull back to the back side.

4706
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:37,800
I need heal.

4707
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:41,140
Just play in the middle of the bridge.

4708
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:43,880
One guy.

4709
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:45,780
Hit my ult.

4710
02:29:47,140 --> 02:29:48,100
Is that your ult?

4711
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:49,140
I will climb up.

4712
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:53,160
They are fighting each other over there.

4713
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:55,180
I can scan in one.

4714
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:55,800
I am scanning.

4715
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,500
I am scanning.

4716
02:29:57,860 --> 02:29:59,220
I didn't detect anyone.

4717
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:01,220
I see a nerf.

4718
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:02,800
They are crossing.

4719
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:06,120
Blue armor.

4720
02:30:09,220 --> 02:30:11,220
I can't hit him because of this lag.

4721
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:11,940
I can't hit him because of this lag.

4722
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:14,840
I am lagging like a bitch.

4723
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:15,280
I am lagging like a bitch.

4724
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:17,220
They are still over there.

4725
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:19,040
Behind this rock.

4726
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:22,100
That team is like whatever.

4727
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:22,640
That team is like whatever.

4728
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:25,760
That team is literally just helping us.

4729
02:30:26,060 --> 02:30:26,560
That team is literally just helping us.

4730
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:27,840
They are here.

4731
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:30,000
What do you need?

4732
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:31,140
Try to save.

4733
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:33,280
I can give you one.

4734
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:34,400
I can give you some.

4735
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:37,840
I have 180 right now.

4736
02:30:37,900 --> 02:30:40,680
I am running low on sniper ammo.

4737
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:43,220
I got purple.

4738
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:43,880
Wow.

4739
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:47,260
They are just there.

4740
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:50,760
I would hit them if they weren't teleporting.

4741
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:51,400
I don't know where they are going.

4742
02:30:52,060 --> 02:30:53,280
They are smoking you.

4743
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:54,820
They are smoking me.

4744
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:56,720
They might go from right side.

4745
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,540
I see right side.

4746
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:00,240
There is a guy crawling.

4747
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:00,920
Dead.

4748
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:02,020
What?

4749
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:03,140
He is there.

4750
02:31:03,160 --> 02:31:03,620
Yeah.

4751
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:06,180
There is a guy crawling in the water.

4752
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:07,940
What the fuck was he doing there?

4753
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:10,060
My scan doesn't reach them.

4754
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,060
Is this just a duo now?

4755
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:14,040
I saw three over there.

4756
02:31:14,540 --> 02:31:16,360
This guy is crawling towards us.

4757
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:17,560
Let's take on Bangalore.

4758
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:19,580
Let's do that.

4759
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:21,980
Can you scan them?

4760
02:31:22,180 --> 02:31:23,340
I don't reach it.

4761
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:26,000
Can you get a little bit closer?

4762
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:27,600
How?

4763
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:29,860
Just a little bit.

4764
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:31,720
To this raw or something.

4765
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:33,240
I can scan here.

4766
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:33,980
I will scan it.

4767
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:37,540
Still not close enough.

4768
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:40,000
It didn't reach it.

4769
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:41,460
Yeah, it didn't reach.

4770
02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:43,100
There is a purple guy.

4771
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:44,800
I think that is a new guy.

4772
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:45,560
We got to go zone.

4773
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:47,360
Okay.

4774
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:50,460
Let me think about zone.

4775
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:51,800
You guys are still holding there.

4776
02:31:51,940 --> 02:31:53,620
I can give you guys a zip when it is time to move.

4777
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:55,420
That is in.

4778
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:57,900
They are close to us.

4779
02:31:57,960 --> 02:31:59,200
Yeah, they are close to us right now.

4780
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:00,060
I am backing up to you.

4781
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:01,840
They are pushing.

4782
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:04,600
It is okay.

4783
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:06,100
We play from here and we hold them back.

4784
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:10,820
Let me know when to scan.

4785
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:14,520
They are going to go here and they are going to play those rocks.

4786
02:32:15,340 --> 02:32:16,560
We have to keep this rock.

4787
02:32:17,500 --> 02:32:18,220
Nobody turn.

4788
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:20,620
This is so laggy.

4789
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:21,260
I am so annoyed.

4790
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:21,880
Be careful.

4791
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:24,760
Those guys behind us can see us.

4792
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:26,980
They are going to cross now.

4793
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:29,100
We need to scan them.

4794
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:31,380
11 seconds.

4795
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:32,260
Scan in this direction.

4796
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:33,040
11 seconds.

4797
02:32:33,940 --> 02:32:34,760
It is open.

4798
02:32:36,660 --> 02:32:38,100
There is a team in that cave.

4799
02:32:38,360 --> 02:32:39,220
I am looking at.

4800
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:40,380
I can see one.

4801
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:43,940
One guy.

4802
02:32:45,220 --> 02:32:47,020
There is a shot from here.

4803
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:48,880
Oh my god.

4804
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:50,340
Careful.

4805
02:32:50,620 --> 02:32:51,980
They are shooting from left.

4806
02:32:52,060 --> 02:32:52,700
Just play on me.

4807
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:54,500
Oh my god.

4808
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:57,940
They are going to push us.

4809
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:58,880
They are beaming me.

4810
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,040
It is not good here.

4811
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:04,640
There is no one alive in this lobby.

4812
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:08,260
They can do whatever the fuck they want.

4813
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:10,380
They are hard pushing.

4814
02:33:11,860 --> 02:33:12,680
Oh no.

4815
02:33:13,580 --> 02:33:15,120
I am lagging way too much.

4816
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:16,080
Everyone is teleporting.

4817
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:17,820
That is fine.

4818
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:22,860
It is just a squint.

4819
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:26,420
We had lagged debuff.

4820
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:29,500
We had lagged debuff.

4821
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:31,480
I am literally getting fucking...

4822
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:33,060
fucking...

4823
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:34,680
I am getting dedosed.

4824
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:35,820
This is insane.

4825
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:39,000
I was fine the entire time.

4826
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,840
And all of a sudden everyone is teleporting.

4827
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:41,540
How is this real?

4828
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:47,140
This can't be real.

4829
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:50,060
I think we need Wraith.

4830
02:33:51,940 --> 02:33:53,740
Now we need Wraith again.

4831
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:54,040
Wow.

4832
02:33:56,420 --> 02:33:57,160
I don't know.

4833
02:33:57,240 --> 02:34:01,180
I feel like Patha and you just wasn't the right pick.

4834
02:34:04,300 --> 02:34:05,960
It is always the comp's fault.

4835
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:07,260
It is never anything else.

4836
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:11,480
Well if we had Wraith we could have portaled to a safer area.

4837
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:16,120
Okay in the next game I pick Wraith.

4838
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:18,740
We had Patha and we could have zipped on high ground.

4839
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:23,680
If we had this we could have done that.

4840
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:24,520
Did we even make that?

4841
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:29,440
Isn't this the last game?

4842
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:30,420
Yeah this is the last game.

4843
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:31,780
It was LG.

4844
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:33,740
Yeah it is 6 games.

4845
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:35,200
It should be.

4846
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:35,960
It is like a scrim.

4847
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:38,140
It is okay guys.

4848
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:41,940
We didn't show them our true strength.

4849
02:34:42,700 --> 02:34:44,660
Honestly if I wasn't lagging right there.

4850
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:45,960
I would have killed that fucking team.

4851
02:34:45,980 --> 02:34:46,600
While it was crossing.

4852
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:49,020
I had so many free shots I couldn't hit.

4853
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:50,100
Because they are teleporting.

4854
02:34:50,100 --> 02:34:54,120
What if you lagged on the tournament?

4855
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:55,200
Yeah what if you lagged on the tournament?

4856
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:56,840
Then we are just going to lose.

4857
02:34:57,020 --> 02:34:57,840
I don't know what to tell you.

4858
02:34:58,980 --> 02:34:59,900
But like...

4859
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:02,500
Why don't you just fix your internet?

4860
02:35:03,220 --> 02:35:03,680
How?

4861
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:06,560
How would I do that?

4862
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:09,380
If you know how please let me know.

4863
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:10,020
Because I am trying.

4864
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:10,800
Go to somebody's house.

4865
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:15,080
Whose house am I going to go to?

4866
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:20,040
Bring your PC over to somebody's house that has good internet.

4867
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:22,600
No one has good internet here.

4868
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:23,880
Then...

4869
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:25,660
How do you play?

4870
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:28,260
I don't.

4871
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:32,320
I don't play Apex.

4872
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:33,000
Because listen.

4873
02:35:33,420 --> 02:35:37,320
This game has the worst netcode on the planet.

4874
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:38,680
That's not true.

4875
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:40,280
Super Smash Bros exists.

4876
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:41,360
That is true.

4877
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:46,180
Me and Mande literally had 30% packet loss for a whole year in this game.

4878
02:35:46,300 --> 02:35:47,820
Just because Apex.

4879
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:50,080
Everything else works perfectly fine.

4880
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:53,020
But Apex is at 30% permanent packet loss.

4881
02:35:53,140 --> 02:35:54,100
It's only me and Mande.

4882
02:35:54,140 --> 02:35:54,540
No one else.

4883
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:58,300
If it's just you two and there is a whole EU market.

4884
02:35:58,700 --> 02:36:01,760
But only you two have issues in EU.

4885
02:36:02,060 --> 02:36:04,660
Versus like 80 other EU players.

4886
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:06,340
Then...

4887
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:07,920
Obviously it wasn't just us.

4888
02:36:08,060 --> 02:36:09,820
A lot of people lagged in rank and shit.

4889
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:11,380
But it's like specifically...

4890
02:36:11,380 --> 02:36:12,480
But you said it was just you two.

4891
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:14,740
It's specifically certain hosts.

4892
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:18,060
Certain ISPs don't work with this game.

4893
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:18,600
Because...

4894
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:19,700
I don't know.

4895
02:36:19,700 --> 02:36:20,080
Fuck this game.

4896
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:21,920
It wouldn't be the ISPs fault.

4897
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:24,740
So...

4898
02:36:24,740 --> 02:36:24,960
So...

4899
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,520
Let me...

4900
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:30,780
If the ISP works in every single fucking game.

4901
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:32,640
But it doesn't work in one game.

4902
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:34,000
Is it really ISPs fault?

4903
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:36,020
Or the game's fucking bullshit as netcode?

4904
02:36:36,120 --> 02:36:37,520
Maybe the ISP didn't update for Apex.

4905
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:39,120
Because it was too new.

4906
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:41,340
They don't need to update for no fucking game.

4907
02:36:41,480 --> 02:36:44,580
The game needs to update it's netcode for the ISPs.

4908
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:48,460
But...

4909
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:51,800
The ISP is weak.

4910
02:36:53,780 --> 02:36:55,260
Because Jesus Christ.

4911
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:56,460
I don't fucking know.

4912
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:57,720
I look like a specialist.

4913
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:07,920
It's okay guys.

4914
02:37:08,060 --> 02:37:09,940
This is just a scrim guys.

4915
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:10,860
We will...

4916
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:11,480
Yeah.

4917
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:12,260
Yeah.

4918
02:37:12,300 --> 02:37:13,780
And the tournament will do so.

4919
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:14,280
It's like hey.

4920
02:37:14,380 --> 02:37:16,240
Your internet will be good on the tournament.

4921
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:18,400
Yeah.

4922
02:37:18,400 --> 02:37:22,700
Just a bad day.

4923
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:24,640
I'm gonna write a tweet longer.

4924
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:26,380
If I get DDoSed on tournament.

4925
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:31,080
It's going to be addressed to everyone in this tournament.

4926
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:33,680
Fuck you motherfuckers for DDoSing me.

4927
02:37:33,780 --> 02:37:34,300
Fuck you.

4928
02:37:35,340 --> 02:37:36,580
Every single one of you.

4929
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:38,040
Tell Hidels to ban them all.

4930
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:40,420
I don't know which one it is.

4931
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:41,540
But one of you motherfuckers.

4932
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:43,200
It's you motherfucker.

4933
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:46,040
Just keep shooting all your shots and eventually you'll hit.

4934
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:50,540
If I just fucking blame everyone.

4935
02:37:50,780 --> 02:37:51,440
Someone's at fault.

4936
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:52,020
Exactly.

4937
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:53,520
Exactly.

4938
02:37:54,520 --> 02:37:57,500
Take a page from Doki's book.

4939
02:37:58,900 --> 02:37:59,660
Blame everyone.

4940
02:38:00,900 --> 02:38:01,760
Fuck yourself.

4941
02:38:05,420 --> 02:38:06,920
I had a great time guys.

4942
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:08,780
Yeah it was just great.

4943
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:10,000
I liked winning that one game.

4944
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:10,760
Yeah.

4945
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:15,200
That was such a good game.

4946
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:16,880
Remember that time when we won that one game?

4947
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:19,460
I didn't like when you cosplayed a statue.

4948
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:20,800
That was not very cool.

4949
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:24,700
That was the last time RPR had good internet.

4950
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:27,560
It had to be that.

4951
02:38:27,560 --> 02:38:30,540
I also didn't like when you were instigating fights in the team.

4952
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:32,400
How did I instigate?

4953
02:38:32,740 --> 02:38:34,780
I didn't even instigate jack shit.

4954
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:36,540
I was just asking questions.

4955
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:39,100
Yeah all I'm gonna say is watch your own one.

4956
02:38:39,900 --> 02:38:40,080
Okay.

4957
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:42,720
Someone's gonna...

4958
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:44,420
Listen why are we even arguing?

4959
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:46,040
Someone's gonna fucking clip it.

4960
02:38:46,060 --> 02:38:47,340
There's gonna be a fucking YouTube clip.

4961
02:38:47,340 --> 02:38:51,720
Donkey making RPR lose his mind for the 57th time.

4962
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:57,680
It's all fucking instigation bullshit while we're playing screams and I'm trying my ass off while you're fucking...

4963
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,120
We're trying our asses off too.

4964
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,800
Yap yap yap.

4965
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:02,220
Why did you do that?

4966
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:04,080
Yeah we're trying as well.

4967
02:39:04,240 --> 02:39:04,360
Why this?

4968
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:04,960
Why that?

4969
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:06,680
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

4970
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:07,260
We're asking questions.

4971
02:39:07,300 --> 02:39:09,600
Oh we're not allowed to ask questions anymore.

4972
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:10,680
Why are we not winning?

4973
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,820
I mean it is a good question.

4974
02:39:13,060 --> 02:39:14,060
Two fucking questions allowed.

4975
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:15,700
Two questions allowed.

4976
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:18,400
I'm banning questions.

4977
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:24,900
I'm banning questions.

4978
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:25,960
Then we'll never learn.

4979
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:27,420
Good.

4980
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:29,660
You don't need to learn you just need to follow.

4981
02:39:34,420 --> 02:39:36,320
It's not about learning it's about following.

4982
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,800
You guys I had a great time.

4983
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:45,320
I had a great time too.

4984
02:39:45,400 --> 02:39:47,280
Yeah I can't wait for Saturday.

4985
02:39:47,540 --> 02:39:50,040
When we have an even better time.

4986
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:50,900
Yeah.

4987
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:54,360
Yeah I'm so excited guys.

4988
02:39:54,620 --> 02:39:55,200
Yeah I can't wait to play with RPR on this day.

4989
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:57,620
Yeah me too I can't wait to play with RPR on Saturday.

4990
02:39:58,300 --> 02:40:00,220
Positive mental attitude.

4991
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:03,040
I am so excited for Saturday.

4992
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:03,680
Yay TSM.

4993
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:04,160
TSM.

4994
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:06,980
Today is just a scream.

4995
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:08,400
We don't take it serious.

4996
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:10,040
Yeah screams are nothing.

4997
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:13,580
Who the fuck cares about screams you know.

4998
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:14,120
Who the fuck cares about screams you know.

4999
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:16,320
Yeah I mean look at our world.

5000
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:17,480
None of us were serious at all.

5001
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:18,720
Yeah none of us were serious.

5002
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:19,120
Especially Doki.

5003
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:26,100
No one cares about screams guys.

5004
02:40:26,980 --> 02:40:27,700
No one cares about screams guys.

5005
02:40:28,100 --> 02:40:30,500
But I told you we win the first one.

5006
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:32,020
And then we lose all the other ones.

5007
02:40:32,140 --> 02:40:33,900
We make them think they have something going on.

5008
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:34,740
Yeah exactly.

5009
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:35,900
We fucked them on the tournament day.

5010
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:37,340
Yeah I agree.

5011
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:41,040
I had a great time.

5012
02:40:41,720 --> 02:40:42,260
I had a great time.

5013
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:44,580
Did you have fun?

5014
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:47,880
Did you have fun?

5015
02:40:47,940 --> 02:40:48,380
Did you have fun RPR?

5016
02:40:48,380 --> 02:40:51,580
Yeah it was great fun guys.

5017
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:52,440
It was great.

5018
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:53,240
That's great to know.

5019
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:56,360
See RPR had a lot of fun guys.

5020
02:40:56,960 --> 02:40:59,760

02:41:04,740 --> 02:41:08,440

02:41:12,060 --> 02:41:12,640
Or I am not accepting your donation.

5027
02:41:12,640 --> 02:41:14,740
Well you don't have to accept the donation.

5028
02:41:14,980 --> 02:41:15,900
But I'll accept it.

5029
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:18,540
Yeah farm me some more.

5030
02:41:18,740 --> 02:41:22,340
Yeah keep farming me.

5031
02:41:23,260 --> 02:41:24,780
That's what you said.

5032
02:41:24,980 --> 02:41:25,600
That's what Fred said.

5033
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,040
Why is Dito laughing?

5034
02:41:32,400 --> 02:41:33,300
It's funny.

5035
02:41:35,060 --> 02:41:35,700
She's right.

5036
02:41:35,720 --> 02:41:36,980
Yeah my suffering is always funny.

5037
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:39,260
We all suffer together.

5038
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:40,380
Because it's friendship.

5039
02:41:41,220 --> 02:41:42,880
No we did not suffer together.

5040
02:41:43,060 --> 02:41:44,480
I suffered and you guys laughed.

5041
02:41:45,860 --> 02:41:47,180
We all suffered together.

5042
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:49,520
I suffered because we didn't win.

5043
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:51,520
We didn't win.

5044
02:41:51,980 --> 02:41:52,920
That's suffering.

5045
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:56,780
Yeah but I suffered mental damage.

5046
02:41:57,700 --> 02:41:59,700
Yeah I had mental damage from losing.

5047
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:05,840
We won a game.

5048
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:08,700
From getting blamed by RPR.

5049
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:11,480
Yeah we suffered mental damage because RPR blamed us.

5050
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:12,200
Yeah we suffered mental damage because RPR blamed us.

5051
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:13,000
Okay hold up.

5052
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:16,000
First and foremost I was not even the one blaming.

5053
02:42:16,420 --> 02:42:19,440
What happened is you guys wanted to blame.

5054
02:42:19,660 --> 02:42:19,740
What happened is you guys wanted to blame.

5055
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:21,640
Like when I was being chill and I was saying.

5056
02:42:21,780 --> 02:42:23,680
Oh guys let's just focus on winning.

5057
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:25,340
Why do we have to blame people.

5058
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:26,880
You guys kept blaming everyone.

5059
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:27,880
Why did you do that?

5060
02:42:27,980 --> 02:42:28,620
Why is this going?

5061
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:30,180
What are you gonna do?

5062
02:42:30,760 --> 02:42:31,960
Keep your IGL.

5063
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:34,040
Blame nation.

5064
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:35,860
But we are TSM.

5065
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:36,760
That's what it's about.

5066
02:42:37,180 --> 02:42:38,260
We were just asking.

5067
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:40,180
Yeah we are asking too.

5068
02:42:40,280 --> 02:42:40,720
Not blaming.

5069
02:42:41,500 --> 02:42:44,500
We are just asking questions because we want to get better.

5070
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:45,540
And now Harry gaslighting.

5071
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:46,680
I'm gonna leave this column.

5072
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:47,900
Before I leave my life.

5073
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,120
Maybe you are too sleepy up here.

5074
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:53,080
You are too sleepy to play this game.

5075
02:42:53,420 --> 02:42:54,220
It's okay.

5076
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:56,620
You too.

5077
02:42:57,700 --> 02:42:58,520
This is like.

5078
02:42:58,620 --> 02:43:00,580
Being stabbed in the back by your own daughter.

5079
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:01,920
No.

5080
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:06,420
I didn't do anything.

5081
02:43:07,140 --> 02:43:07,740
Yeah.

5082
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:09,800
We didn't do anything.

5083
02:43:10,780 --> 02:43:11,380
Yeah.

5084
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:13,860
You shouldn't do anything.

5085
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:15,920
Yes I always say.

5086
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,360
Say to my chat that.

5087
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:20,460
Let's pick our peer because he is a good player.

5088
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:22,340
Yeah he is our hero.

5089
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:24,280
Second to zero.

5090
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:26,160
She is just lying.

5091
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:28,600
I watch your stream.

5092
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,540
All the time.

5093
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:31,140
You never fucking said it.

5094
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:33,520
I watched your stream.

5095
02:43:34,020 --> 02:43:35,580
I watched her the other day.

5096
02:43:35,620 --> 02:43:37,100
Talk to Japanese friend.

5097
02:43:37,260 --> 02:43:39,380
And the entire time she was talking about me.

5098
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:41,480
She was talking about how scary I am.

5099
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:43,500
And how bad of a person I am.

5100
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:44,640
No I'm not.

5101
02:43:44,660 --> 02:43:46,180
I watched her and she told.

5102
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:48,900
On her stream last week.

5103
02:43:49,060 --> 02:43:51,440
She was saying how much she admired you.

5104
02:43:51,560 --> 02:43:53,440
And how you are like her hero.

5105
02:43:54,740 --> 02:43:56,140
Yeah I said it's a hero.

5106
02:43:56,140 --> 02:43:56,540
Yeah.

5107
02:43:56,540 --> 02:43:58,440
It was on her last stream.

5108
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:00,760
She streams so much I don't remember.

5109
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:01,900
She streams a lot.

5110
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:03,060
But I saw it.

5111
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:07,800
Ditto's chat do you remember that time when she talked about like.

5112
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:09,700
How much she admires our PR.

5113
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:10,540
Ditto's chat.

5114
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:11,880
See.

5115
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:15,240
Ditto's chat.

5116
02:44:15,980 --> 02:44:16,940
Show me the clip.

5117
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:18,600
See the chat agrees.

5118
02:44:18,860 --> 02:44:20,780
Well they are not going to be able to find the clip right away.

5119
02:44:20,940 --> 02:44:21,740
It was so long ago.

5120
02:44:21,740 --> 02:44:22,740
It was like last week.

5121
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:23,400
Yeah.

5122
02:44:24,020 --> 02:44:27,760
Do you realize that Ditto's title is literally.

5123
02:44:28,580 --> 02:44:31,780
Scream with Doki and one stupid RPR.

5124
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:32,960
No it's not.

5125
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:34,020
I don't see that.

5126
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:36,660
Someone who respects someone.

5127
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:38,620
Really write one stupid.

5128
02:44:38,620 --> 02:44:39,040
I don't say that.

5129
02:44:41,800 --> 02:44:42,560
Refresh your.

5130
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:45,540
It says.

5131
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:48,040
Doki and RPR.

5132
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:49,420
My hero.

5133
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:51,520
I have screenshots.

5134
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:54,280
I have screenshots.

5135
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:55,680
I have screenshots too.

5136
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:57,460
I have screenshots too.

5137
02:44:57,460 --> 02:44:59,640
You have photoshop that's not fair.

5138
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:00,520
That's not photoshop.

5139
02:45:00,940 --> 02:45:01,940
What do you mean?

5140
02:45:02,300 --> 02:45:02,720
It's photoshop.

5141
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:08,720
Now you are like gaslighting all of us.

5142
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:09,600
Yeah.

5143
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:11,780
Why?

5144
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:12,940
Why is there RPR?

5145
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:13,640
No.

5146
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:15,100
It says.

5147
02:45:16,460 --> 02:45:19,320
Your title is literally RPR will die first.

5148
02:45:19,740 --> 02:45:21,140
No it's not.

5149
02:45:21,740 --> 02:45:22,500
Why did you see that?

5150
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:25,100
Where did you see that?

5151
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:26,840
I don't understand.

5152
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:31,420
It says RPR will not die first.

5153
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:32,760
I'm gonna go to bed.

5154
02:45:32,860 --> 02:45:35,620
My title is literally RPR will not die first.

5155
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:36,860
And Ditto is like.

5156
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:39,280
One hero RPR.

5157
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:41,940
I'm gonna go to bed.

5158
02:45:42,100 --> 02:45:43,720
And I got homework for you guys.

5159
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:45,320
You guys should really reconsider.

5160
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:46,880
Your choices tonight.

5161
02:45:47,300 --> 02:45:48,520
Like really consider.

5162
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:50,640
The words you are saying to me.

5163
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:51,920
Really think about it.

5164
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,140
Next time we play.

5165
02:45:53,400 --> 02:45:55,740
Really think about which words you are saying to me.

5166
02:45:55,820 --> 02:45:59,220
And what kind of damage and effect they could have on my mental health.

5167
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:00,000
Going forward.

5168
02:46:00,780 --> 02:46:03,380
And that's what I'm gonna leave you with for tonight.

5169
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:05,240
