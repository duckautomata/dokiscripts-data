1
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,210
Yay!

2
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,990
Hello, hello everybody!

3
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,250
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

4
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,810
Okay guys, you see there's some new stuff on the screen.

5
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,730
And I hear myself... oh no, okay I fixed it.

6
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,070
Okay, I don't hear myself anymore.

7
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,130
Okay...

8
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,210
Hello everybody!

9
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,690
I'm so excited to show you guys all these things on my screen.

10
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,990
You're like, oh my god, it looks so fancy!

11
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,950
So I'm gonna post this right now.

12
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,450
So, what is this fancy thing that's going on on the screen at the moment?

13
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,410
So here I post this.

14
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,190
Let me pin this real quick.

15
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,070
So basically, I downloaded this from...

16
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,750
I was like following this creator that does like widgets for stream stuff.

17
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,830
I've always wanted to use it.

18
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,510
It's like a streamer task list widget.

19
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,390
And then all you have to do...

20
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,710
I don't know if it doesn't pop up.

21
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,050
Okay, someone tried it.

22
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,750
Okay, it didn't work.

23
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:48,930
I'm just gonna try it again.

24
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,090
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,750
I saw someone already tried it.

26
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,390
And nothing popped up.

27
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,850
Okay, I didn't know.

28
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,310
Guys, give me a sec.

29
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,850
Let me figure this out.

30
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,430
I thought that was how you do it!

31
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,950
Okay, task command.

32
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,790
Permission.

33
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,870
It says viewers!

34
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,890
Why is it not viewing?

35
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,190
I was able to put stuff on.

36
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,590
I don't know about you guys.

37
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,830
Okay, did I like mess it up?

38
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,130
Okay, uh...

39
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,130
Give me a sec.

40
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,390
I didn't like...

41
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,670
Actually...

42
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,990
Yeah!

43
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,890
It says add!

44
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,250
Add news task to the list.

45
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,610
Yeah!

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,010
Exclamation point add!

47
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,630
What the fuck?

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,490
Why is it not working?

49
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,570
I was able to!

50
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,650
Okay, watch this.

51
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,050
Add...

52
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,970
Um...

53
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,730
Fix the to-do list.

54
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,370
Fix the to-do list.

55
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,970
Am I...

56
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,150
Am I even...

57
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,250
Am I not on anonymous mode?

58
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,370
Am I on anonymous mode right now?

59
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,090
Give me a sec, guys.

60
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,050
Guys, I'm sorry.

61
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,350
I forgot I'm on anonymous mode on Twitch.

62
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,130
So when I'm on anonymous mode on Twitch, I can't do anything.

63
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,050
Okay.

64
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,050
Oh no.

65
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,950
Give me a sec.

66
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,230
I can't even load Twitch at the moment.

67
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,170
Oh, it's all over.

68
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,210
It's over already.

69
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,550
I was... It was so cool too!

70
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,590
I was like, oh my god.

71
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,970
This is so cool.

72
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,330
I can like add stuff.

73
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,890
Oh wait, is this why?

74
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,750
Wait, I think I know why it doesn't work.

75
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,850
Give me a sec.

76
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,490
Oh!

77
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,090
It was the wrong command.

78
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,870
Okay, I fixed it.

79
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,490
Alright, now it should work.

80
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,490
I figured it out.

81
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,150
I gave you guys the wrong command.

82
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,310
There we go!

83
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,030
What do you mean it's over?

84
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,410
I can delete...

85
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,710
I can literally delete commands.

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,700
Guys, please!

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,620
This is supposed... We're supposed to be working together!

88
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,300
Chat!

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
We are supposed to be working together, chat.

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,520
Stop!

91
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,760
I will delete your commands!

92
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,140
Wait, no!

93
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,180
Mods can delete commands!

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Mods, I'm so sorry.

95
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:15,840
I know.

96
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,800
Okay, I've started paying.

97
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm not paying the mods though.

98
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,760
You can't be like they're doing it for free.

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,240
Because I can finally afford to pay the mods.

100
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,460
So like...

101
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,560
Mods, why?

102
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,400
Okay, alright.

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:29,860
Alright.

104
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,740
Mods, you're getting paid now!

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,000
So, all you have to do is is the command to delete other people's...

106
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,800
The command to delete other people's shitty tasks that are not relevant is delete.

107
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,900
So, it's exclamation point...

108
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,000
Wait, let me read the...

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,880
Let me read the guidelines.

110
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,920
Okay, it's exclamation point, delete, and then you... I swear to god!

111
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,260
And then like delete the username.

112
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:13,280
All you have to do is just exclamation point, delete, and then you delete whoever's username has like the shitty task that is not relevant.

113
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,300
You just do...

114
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,140
delete the username's task.

115
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,960
So...

116
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,980
Not enough for...

117
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,360
What do you mean?

118
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,680
Look at all my tasks!

119
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,240
Look at all the fucking chat's to-do list!

120
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,400
There's...

121
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,220
This is not...

122
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,280
This is your to-do list, guys.

123
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,600
This is not my to-do list.

124
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,300
If you're gonna...

125
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,340
I'm gonna put...

126
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,700
Twitch, this is...

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,720
Jinger, thank you for the super chat.

128
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Thank you.

129
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,920
Thank you.

130
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,920
This is your to-do list.

131
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,260
I have my list on my left side.

132
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,020
My list is on the left side.

133
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,820
Your list is on the right side.

134
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,780
And also, also, if you guys are like...

135
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,560
We can also ban people.

136
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,580
If we ban people on Twitch, then like all the tasks get removed instantly.

137
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,860
So like there's also that option.

138
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,500
So...

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,740
If it's easier.

140
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,880
If it's easier.

141
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,840
30 minutes slow-mo.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,760
30 minutes slow-mo.

143
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,580
Okay, guys.

144
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,560
Maybe...

145
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
Not 30...

146
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,180
Okay, this is...

147
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,100
There's a lot of tasks coming in.

148
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,780
109 chat!

149
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,040
Anyway...

150
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,600
Anyway...

151
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,160
I was really excited to try this new widget out.

152
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,020
I was really excited to try this new widget out.

153
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,980
It's from...

154
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,940
Who is it?

155
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,460
Sayonani?

156
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,400
Because I've been like following her stuff.

157
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
Like the stuff she develops.

158
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,580
On like widget...

159
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,800
For streamer widget.

160
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,280
But it only works on Twitch.

161
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,740
I mean I could invite...

162
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,440
I wonder if I could invite stream elements...

163
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,700
I was thinking about inviting stream elements into YouTube.

164
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
Because it's like a stream elements widget.

165
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,420
But then I was like I didn't want to clutter up my own chat.

166
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,640
Like on the YouTube chat.

167
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,200
So like...

168
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,500
I figured it's like...

169
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,480
It was like also partially inspired by Ame.

170
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,480
Like remember her...

171
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
Her music bot?

172
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,180
Where like she used to...

173
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,920
When she used to do like those like...

174
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,620
Those like streams where you can listen to music.

175
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,260
By suggesting music on Twitch.

176
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,560
And stuff like that.

177
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,160
So it like inspired me to do something similar.

178
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,120
To separate...

179
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,780
Separate like you know the task list on Twitch.

180
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,720
So it doesn't clutter up the...

181
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,400
Yeah, Bubba bot.

182
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,740
Yeah.

183
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,040
So it doesn't clutter up...

184
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,280
The YouTube chat.

185
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,100
So that's why I decided to...

186
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,660
Cause like I think you can invite stream elements to YouTube chat.

187
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
And it'll do the same thing.

188
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,420
But I figured like okay I don't want my chat to just be filled...

189
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,600
With fucking stupid things that are not...

190
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,660
Relevant to the task.

191
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,800
Cause I know you guys were gonna troll with that.

192
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,120
I...

193
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,340
I knew you guys were gonna troll...

194
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,280
With a fucking command list.

195
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,300
So I figured...

196
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm gonna separate this to...

197
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,640
The Twitch chat.

198
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,440
So you can suggest stuff over there.

199
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
And my YouTube chat.

200
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,260
At least people can still be...

201
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,100
Chatting on the YouTube chat.

202
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,140
But I think it's so cool though.

203
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,860
Isn't it cool?

204
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,000
So like I can do like... I can complete my task too.

205
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,260
Like I thought it was so cool.

206
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,880
Um...

207
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,140
That like you know...

208
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,980
Like we can like work in real time.

209
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,840
Like my stuff on the left side.

210
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,400
Your stuff on the right side.

211
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,900
Two out of 154.

212
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,260
You guys are like 1% complete.

213
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,560
Let's race guys.

214
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,520
Let's see who can get their stuff done first.

215
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,520
Let's see who has like...

216
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,960
A higher percentage...

217
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,160
Of completing their task guys.

218
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,960
Oh my god.

219
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,460
I wonder who will win.

220
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,300
Oh wow.

221
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,500
Oh Ben.

222
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,580
We were set up.

223
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,680
You guys did this to yourself.

224
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,640
Hey guys.

225
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,380
Thank you for the super chat.

226
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,720
Thank you.

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,320
You know us so well.

228
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,400
Thank you.

229
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,380
What's the difference between done and complete?

230
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,120
It's the same thing.

231
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,960
So you can use done or complete.

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
It's people who like you know...

233
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,860
Want to type...

234
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,800
Want a shorter word.

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,100
You just do exclamation point.

236
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,320
Done and I hope you remember what you wrote.

237
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,080
Like I hope...

238
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,800
I hope you remember what you fucking wrote guys.

239
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,980
I hope you remember what you fucking wrote guys.

240
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,280
I hope you remember what you fucking wrote guys.

241
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,920
I wonder if there's like another thing you can type.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,220
I wonder if there's like another thing you can type.

243
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,800
Let me double check.

244
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,740
Let's see.

245
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,560
Settings.

246
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,200
Commands.

247
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,500
To do complete.

248
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,020
Complete and done are the same thing.

249
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,880
So I hope you guys remember.

250
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,800
Cause I don't.

251
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,540
I think if you do...

252
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,060
Oh you do delete.

253
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,580
Maybe if you do delete.

254
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,140
And then your username.

255
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,520
I think it's like delete.

256
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,260
And then your username on Twitch.

257
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,680
It deletes all the tasks.

258
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,140
For your entire...

259
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,040
Like all the tasks that you put on there.

260
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,000
I think.

261
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,140
Guys I'm learning this as I go.

262
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,840
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

263
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,840
Oh no this is mod only.

264
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,040
Nevermind only mods can do that.

265
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,520
So like I hope you remember.

266
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,180
Nevermind.

267
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,700
It says mod only commands.

268
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,880
JK.

269
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,160
You guys better remember what you wrote.

270
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,680
Okay.

271
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,740
Mod you're only deleting the ones.

272
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,160
That are useless.

273
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,780
That are obviously trolls.

274
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,920
So yeah.

275
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,340
I mean if you don't remember.

276
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,720
Then you're failing the rest of the dragoons.

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,920
Cause you're like.

278
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,200
Cause technically.

279
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,140
I'm winning.

280
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,320
The moment I finish one of my tasks.

281
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,420
I basically win the race.

282
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,080
Because I don't know.

283
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,000
7 out of 184.

284
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,660
I don't know guys.

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,880
I don't fucking know.

286
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,800
Thank you for the super chat.

287
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,720
Thank you.

288
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,500
By racing against Doki answering DMs.

289
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,840
We can literally never lose.

290
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,620
Thank you for the super chat.

291
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,100
Thank you.

292
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,660
Anyway.

293
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,940
You know I'm giving you guys a head start.

294
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,300
Cause I want to do a little Zatatan.

295
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,880
Last week was a full on Tekken week.

296
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,020
Plus Sunday.

297
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,140
And we didn't really have a time.

298
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,880
To actually like hang out.

299
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,960
And chat.

300
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,680
Like it was just Tekken Tekken Tekken Tekken.

301
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,300
And uh.

302
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,520
Honestly I'm like super.

303
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,800
Oh my gosh.

304
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,080
I was like what is that sound?

305
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,480
I don't think you guys hear it.

306
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,320
But it was like oh it's the task complete sound.

307
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,020
So every time you guys complete a task.

308
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
There's like a little pencil sound effect.

309
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,600
And like it catches me off guard.

310
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,340
I was like.

311
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,240
Is that my music?

312
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,880
Like.

313
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,220
Uh.

314
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,180
But yes.

315
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,700
The Tekken Arc.

316
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,460
Uh.

317
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,640
And it was like.

318
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,640
Oh my gosh.

319
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm like.

320
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,680
I'm like so tired.

321
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,820
From the time.

322
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,460
I was like.

323
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,020
I think like right after the tournament.

324
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,800
I was like oh my gosh I was so tired.

325
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,400
And like mentally exhausted.

326
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,100
Cause my social battery was like.

327
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,420
Gone basically.

328
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,020
Cause it was like uh.

329
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,000
With hanging out with like.

330
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,280
Uh.

331
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:33,900
Five.

332
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,820
Five people.

333
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,220
And then like for six plus hours.

334
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,480
Almost every day.

335
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,120
So my social battery.

336
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,360
As an introvert.

337
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,320
My social battery.

338
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,940
Is like depleted now.

339
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,180
I think like yesterday.

340
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,620
I think I slept.

341
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,140
Yesterday.

342
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,740
I basically slept like.

343
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,100
I think like.

344
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,400
Oh my gosh.

345
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,380
I slept the whole day.

346
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,900
I like woke up.

347
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,600
I woke up.

348
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,900
And then uh.

349
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,620
And then like um.

350
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,840
And then I think I was only awake for like.

351
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,860
Two to three hours.

352
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,440
And then I went back to sleep.

353
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,240
I was so tired.

354
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,920
I was like oh my gosh I gotta get work done.

355
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,280
I'm so behind because of Tekken.

356
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,880
And then so I started getting work done.

357
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,520
And then I think like two to three hours.

358
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,520
I went back to sleep.

359
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,340
And then I woke up at 11pm.

360
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,900
I woke up at 11pm.

361
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,380
And I was like.

362
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,140
Oh fuck I have so much work to do.

363
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,980
And then I got distracted.

364
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,700
And only did one hour of work.

365
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,720
And I actually got back to work.

366
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,060
At like 3am.

367
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,940
And started you know.

368
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,920
That's why I posted my schedule at like 4 in the morning.

369
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,240
Because you know.

370
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,440
I've been awake for.

371
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,520
I've only been awake for like 1% of the day.

372
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,000
So I managed to get my schedule done.

373
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,580
At 4 in the morning.

374
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,580
Um.

375
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,940
But I'm very behind.

376
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,960
I am very very.

377
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Very behind.

378
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,620
I did a lot of things at the moment.

379
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,000
Because of Tekken.

380
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,320
And uh.

381
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,880
And just like burying myself with training for Tekken.

382
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,860
But it was a great time.

383
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,420
Honestly I'm so happy.

384
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,020
I said yes to doing the Sajam Slam.

385
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,540
It was a great experience.

386
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,500
And I made so many new friends.

387
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,240
I really love team Brawl Pro.

388
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,780
They were great to hang out with.

389
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,260
And honestly like.

390
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:25,940
Um.

391
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,480
Never expected to win first place.

392
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,500
That's for sure.

393
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,220
The biggest upset in history.

394
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,940
When I beat SK.

395
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,840
No one.

396
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,260
Like I think like only.

397
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,920
Like 5% believed in me.

398
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,700
In the Sajam.

399
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,180
Because there was like a betting pool.

400
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,240
There was a betting pool apparently.

401
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,260
During like the me vs SK match.

402
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,340
And it was like 300k.

403
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,800
Versus 1.5 million.

404
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,760
Hahahaha.

405
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,760
Hahahaha.

406
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,840
I was like.

407
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,800
I was literally.

408
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,080
It was like a David vs Goliath situation.

409
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,380
Nobody expected me to win.

410
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,200
Hahahaha.

411
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,020
Hahahaha.

412
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,420
Hahahaha.

413
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,860
It was actually.

414
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,860
Fucking crazy.

415
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,580
Hahahaha.

416
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,060
Hahahaha.

417
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,720
And um.

418
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm really happy that.

419
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
I honestly never expected to win first.

420
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,140
I was like oh man.

421
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,220
I know my team was really really good.

422
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,780
In general.

423
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,520
Because you know this was like the same team in the first Sajam Slam.

424
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,000
And we literally have Jack Jesus.

425
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,920
Who like only lost one game.

426
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,420
In the entire Sajam Slam.

427
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,360
Um.

428
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,960
And uh.

429
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,400
I honestly.

430
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,780
I expected second.

431
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,020
But not first.

432
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,180
Because I feel like first heavily relied on me.

433
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,100
Winning at least one game.

434
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,000
Hahahaha.

435
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,760
Like.

436
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,460
That's what first was.

437
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,140
Like I just literally needed to win one game.

438
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,060
And I was like.

439
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,360
Oh I don't know about this.

440
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,160
Hahahaha.

441
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,420
I was like.

442
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,580
I don't know.

443
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,920
It's SK.

444
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,580
Hahahaha.

445
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,780
I don't think even my team.

446
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,540
Expected me to win that one game.

447
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,420
I think my team was just like.

448
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,040
Okay.

449
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,240
Let's just make sure she's not sad.

450
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,380
When she loses.

451
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,360
Hahahaha.

452
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,000
Hahahaha.

453
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,440
I feel like they were just like.

454
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,240
Let's just make sure she's not sad.

455
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,480
And that she's hap...

456
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,420
And that she's having a good time.

457
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,840
Hahahaha.

458
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,140
Hahahaha.

459
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:43,980
Uh.

460
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,800
Yeah nobody expected it.

461
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,780
But it was so.

462
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,780
Uh.

463
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,800
It was just insane that that happened.

464
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,860
I just realized my lure is like.

465
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,140
Not.

466
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,760
Sorry.

467
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,440
My lure is not showing up.

468
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,680
Because it's getting covered.

469
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,600
Let me put that here.

470
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,080
Anyway.

471
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,340
Insane experience.

472
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,640
I told Sajem.

473
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,380
That like.

474
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,220
Apparently the next Sajem slam is going to be Street Fighter.

475
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,520
And I hope I get invited.

476
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,980
To the Street Fighter one.

477
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,300
Because I honestly had a great time.

478
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,980
And then like a lot of the.

479
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,160
Team Brawl Pro wants to run it back again.

480
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,460
For the next Sajem slam.

481
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,620
So uh.

482
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,700
Yeah it's for Street Fighter 6.

483
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,440
So I honestly hope.

484
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,560
I hope I get invited for the next one.

485
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,600
And be also be placed back in Team Brawl Pro.

486
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,620
I don't know.

487
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,620
Like I don't feel like.

488
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,180
Oh why don't you want to be in a new team.

489
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,420
I just really like.

490
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,600
Team Brawl Pro.

491
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,700
It's just vibes.

492
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,320
You know.

493
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,020
I feel like.

494
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,360
If I was in any other team.

495
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,620
The chemistry would not be the same.

496
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,400
I don't know.

497
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,780
I just feel like it wouldn't be as fun.

498
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,160
If it was.

499
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,740
Like with any other.

500
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,840
Like combination.

501
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,160
I feel like it was just the perfect.

502
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,420
I feel like the team was just the perfect combination.

503
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,060
And I hope.

504
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,840
I asked Sajem.

505
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,580
I was like oh.

506
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,220
If possible.

507
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,980
I told him if possible.

508
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,200
I would love to be invited again.

509
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,120
For the next Sajem Slam.

510
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,640
So I hope I get in.

511
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,100
I hope I get into the next one.

512
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,340
Because it was definitely really really really fun.

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,480
Apparently.

514
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,760
I converted a lot of non-Vtuber fans.

515
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,960
Into watching me now.

516
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,800
Because I was so fucking ridiculous.

517
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,520
Because I was.

518
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,820
I was unfiltered as fuck.

519
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,920
And I'm sorry.

520
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
That this is the first stream you're coming to.

521
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,880
Where I'm like a bit more chill right now.

522
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,380
Because I am so behind.

523
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
On a lot of things.

524
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,900
If you're expecting.

525
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,200
More of what I was like.

526
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,540
During the Tekken Arc today.

527
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,960
I am so sorry.

528
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,240
I am so busy.

529
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,080
I am so.

530
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
I am so behind.

531
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,500
So like originally I wasn't gonna stream today.

532
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,420
Um.

533
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,720
I wasn't going to stream today.

534
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,140
Because of how busy I was.

535
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,780
But then I was like.

536
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,740
Man I haven't had time to actually.

537
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,160
You know.

538
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,080
Talk to you guys.

539
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,440
And hang out with my chat.

540
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,700
Because when I do like collabs.

541
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,260
I know like a lot of people who are used to watching like Fleshies.

542
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,080
Um.

543
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,620
You know.

544
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,360
They do like push to talk.

545
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,800
Where they would like you know talk to the group.

546
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,340
And then like talk to the chat.

547
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,240
And do push to talk.

548
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,580
I.

549
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:52,800
I am just.

550
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,880
I am just fucking lazy as well.

551
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,620
Uh.

552
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,240
You have to stop.

553
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,360
But they are Fleshies.

554
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,060
They call me 2D.

555
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,820
Because I am not real.

556
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,820
So I can't call them Fleshies.

557
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,600
Anyway.

558
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,500
Um.

559
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:18,560
As I was saying, usually the only time I mute myself to talk to my chat is if there was intermission time.

560
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,540
Which there was during some moments in Tekken where we had to wait for our games.

561
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,180
And that's when I muted myself to talk to you guys.

562
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,740
But usually in collabs, I try to give full focus on talking to the people I'm hanging out with.

563
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,300
Oh, sorry.

564
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,740
I meant the meatbags.

565
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,380
Thank you for the 20 gifted shits!

566
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,400
Thank you, thank you!

567
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
I really appreciate it!

568
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,840
Thank you!

569
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,480
Sage, thank you for the super chat!

570
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,320
Thank you, thank you!

571
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,260
More distractions.

572
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,720
Doki, yippee!

573
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Thank you for the super chat!

574
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,660
Thank you, thank you!

575
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,480
Let's give you guys a head start.

576
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,520
You guys definitely need it.

577
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,480
All I'm saying is that you need the head start.

578
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,000
Because the moment I finish one task, this race is over.

579
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,420
Like, this race is so over.

580
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,120
Come on chat, we're already at 25%.

581
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,740
But guys, you can literally add more...

582
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,020
Like, some fucker can...

583
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Like, several fuckers can literally just add more tasks for you guys and ruin your race.

584
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,020
This is rigged.

585
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,260
There's slow mode.

586
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,480
Slow mode is at you!

587
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,900
I'm actually helping you guys!

588
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,120
I don't know...

589
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,660
Anyway, I mean, the mod can easily put it back...

590
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,560
Mod, put the slow mode to 10 minutes.

591
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,780
Put the slow mode to 10 minutes, not 30 minutes.

592
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
Like, give them that, I guess.

593
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,600
Anyway, but yes.

594
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,200
It is like... Oh my god, it doesn't stop.

595
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,700
Oh my god, it just keeps going.

596
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,440
Haha...

597
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,600
Um, where was I?

598
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
Um, blah...

599
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,560
Oh yes, but yes.

600
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,860
A lot of new...

601
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,020
We have a lot of new viewers.

602
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,280
That came from Tekken.

603
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,560
Because of the shit I say when I open my mouth.

604
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,140
But yes, welcome!

605
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,900
Welcome, new Dragons!

606
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,100
Usually, you know.

607
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,620
We usually have other types of streams.

608
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,060
Not this...

609
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,460
But like I said, it was a nice one.

610
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:44,260
Today I wasn't supposed to be streaming because of how behind I was on like everything like in life.

611
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,580
So I figured you know what let's just you know be able to let's just like stream our work right now.

612
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,820
Well I won't be showing you guys what the fuck I'm working on but like you know be able to stream for you guys.

613
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,960
Talk to you guys while we're working as well and also make you guys be productive as well.

614
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,960
So yeah and I always wanted to try this widget out like this.

615
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,280
I feel like it's nice because we can all just like be productive together.

616
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,300
And like all both of us me and that one dragoon.

617
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,760
Me and my one dragoon and his like 2000 bots accounts.

618
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,580
Work together on finishing stuff up.

619
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,700
Oh Tima thank you for the super chat.

620
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,060
Thank you.

621
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,220
Congrats on the tournament Doki.

622
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:43,920
You're awesome.

623
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,520
New fan here.

624
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,000
Thank you.

625
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,660
Thank you for the super chat.

626
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:45,940
Thank you.

627
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,680
Thank you.

628
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,300
Thank you.

629
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,440
I'm glad you guys really enjoyed the tournament arc.

630
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,240
So like what else?

631
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,920
Oh yes as you can see this week is also pretty fucking packed.

632
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,220
I got invited to... you guys can see there's also an Apex tournament that's happening on the same day.

633
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,940
As WrestleLand.

634
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,180
As WrestleTuber.

635
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,560
So like I got invited to a VTuber.

636
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,580
What?

637
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,120
It says VTuber but then there's like non-VTubers in there.

638
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,840
There's like maybe like I think like two or three non-VTubers in there.

639
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,740
But anyway there is like a VTuber like Apex Invitational.

640
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,800
That's mostly NA.

641
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,860
And then like usually like I haven't really participated.

642
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
I don't know if you noticed.

643
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:43,940
But in the past I've never really been invited to like VTuber Invitationals in like NA parts of the world.

644
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,300
So I've... because like I've been invited to like more I guess like pro tournaments.

645
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,240
Like pro tournaments with like you know NA pros and stuff like that.

646
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,880
But not like VTuber Apex Invitational.

647
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,420
So I figured like... and I looked at the list.

648
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,940
I was like oh hey there's like some...

649
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,980
people here that are like you know well-known in the like Apex VTuber...

650
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,920
I think it's also because there's not a lot of like well-known Apex VTuber...

651
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,060
VTuber streamers in general.

652
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,960
I mean to be fair I'm barely an Apex VTuber streamer.

653
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,560
I'm barely one as well.

654
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,360
Like I'm just variety now.

655
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,040
So like I figured like they invited me.

656
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,000
But then I saw that it's sort of like...

657
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,420
Like when they invited me I couldn't tell them why.

658
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,300
Like I was just like oh I don't know guys.

659
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,180
Like I couldn't say like WrestleTuber because it wasn't announced yet.

660
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,540
So then I was like oh it's sort of conflicts with WrestleTuber because like my thing starts at 4.

661
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,000
And like I can't move the date and time because like there's a lot of people participating.

662
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,200
So then like the organizer was like oh we'll move our tournament.

663
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,620
And I felt bad because they moved the tournament for me.

664
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,020
So like they moved the time for it like an hour earlier for me.

665
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,960
So then I was like oh okay.

666
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,280
I was like oh okay that's really sweet okay.

667
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,980
So then I was like alright yeah I can do it.

668
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,060
As long as I have like time to...

669
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,900
As long as like...

670
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,660
Because I was like oh by the time it ends I have to...

671
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:38,860
I have to like do the WrestleTuber because originally they said it was going to end at 4.

672
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,380
And I was like oh I can't.

673
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,540
I can't do that.

674
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,860
I literally have to do something at 4.

675
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,400
And it's like this whole event that I'm organizing.

676
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,320
I couldn't say what event it was.

677
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,400
So then they were like oh we'll do it.

678
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,340
We'll have the tournament like an hour earlier.

679
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,920
Like and I was like oh okay.

680
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,280
And then because they you know they said they'll have the tournament an hour earlier.

681
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,020
I was like oh yeah okay I'll join.

682
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,300
Like because then like they moved the tournament.

683
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,660
So I was just like oh fuck.

684
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,740
Yeah I'll join.

685
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,400
And so and like I felt like I never really had a chance to join.

686
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,900
And like I said like all the other Apex Youtuber invitational stuff.

687
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,140
I've never really been like invited to it like as a captain.

688
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,760
I think like the last Vtuber invitational that happened.

689
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,580
I was like someone got invited and then they invited me to be on their team.

690
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:50,700
But then like the captain had to drop out at the last minute due to scheduling thing.

691
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,280
But then I didn't realize.

692
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,500
So I thought I was going to be part of it.

693
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,940
But then like because they dropped out.

694
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,080
The team like I think it was like a miscommunication thing.

695
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,200
Because they're like oh because it was supposed to be like we find a replacement for the captain.

696
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,240
But then like it was a miscommunication that they ended up giving the spot the team spot to a different team.

697
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,180
So then like I couldn't join.

698
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,100
So it was like I was really sad about that.

699
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:21,380
So like I've never had a chance to ever do a Vtuber invitational for Apex in like NA.

700
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,480
And I was like okay.

701
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,480
Like I like I when I first got invited.

702
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,160
I got that like the invite.

703
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,660
I was like really happy.

704
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,740
Because I've never been invited before as a captain.

705
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,360
So you know and I was like oh I'm sad.

706
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:49,940
So I was super super happy that like like I got invited to like to like one with like all the known like Apex Vtubers.

707
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,460
Like not just NA.

708
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,180
It's also EU.

709
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,600
Because I know like there's like.

710
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,640
Like I mean I had got RPR in it.

711
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,980
So it's not just NA.

712
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,000
But there's like but like you know like English.

713
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,700
I guess like English speaking.

714
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,860
English speaking Apex Vtubers.

715
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,500
I feel like that's the better term for it.

716
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,640
Apex.

717
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,140
Sorry.

718
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,520
English speaking Apex Vtubers.

719
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,920
So I'm really happy.

720
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,420
Anyway I dragged RPR and ditto to it.

721
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,580
We have our first.

722
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,620
Scrim tomorrow.

723
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,600
Apparently we've been having scrims for a while.

724
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,180
But like I was literally so busy.

725
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,060
I couldn't join any of the scrims.

726
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,940
So like and there's like cash prizes for the scrims.

727
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,800
So I think I mean it's like $150.

728
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,480
If we win I think.

729
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,500
Divide by three people.

730
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,680
So like you know $50 each.

731
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,120
If we win the first.

732
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,180
If we win the scrim.

733
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,140
But yes Wednesday is the.

734
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,200
Tomorrow is the first scrim.

735
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,100
I also got invited.

736
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,560
You guys can see.

737
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,800
I got invited to the.

738
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,360
To a.

739
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,740
Billy Billy.

740
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,940
Arc server.

741
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,500
Billy Billy Vtuber arc server.

742
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,580
But I'll be streaming it on YouTube.

743
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,600
Because I don't have a Billy Billy account yet.

744
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,360
Hiro invited me to it.

745
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,640
She asked me I wanted to check it out.

746
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,800
And there's gonna be like other.

747
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,900
Like Vtubers.

748
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,100
On it and you know.

749
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,600
And you know.

750
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,840
Like this is not like the first time.

751
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,400
There's been like an arc server.

752
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,940
Like a Vtuber arc server.

753
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,060
But in the past I would.

754
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,720
I think I think you guys know.

755
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,720
I talked about before.

756
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,540
Because I know like you guys would be like.

757
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,260
Why didn't you join.

758
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,220
Like why don't you join this arc server.

759
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,760
Blah blah blah.

760
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,360
And I think I talked about before.

761
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,340
Where the reason why I never joined.

762
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,940
The like arc servers in the past.

763
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,940
Is because.

764
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,260
Of language barriers.

765
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,840
And because like you know.

766
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,880
I didn't.

767
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,920
I felt like I wouldn't enjoy it.

768
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,880
As much due to the language barriers.

769
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,840
Going in.

770
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,020
And I wouldn't.

771
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,420
Because like the whole thing about it.

772
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,840
Is like being able to communicate.

773
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,380
With other people.

774
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,600
On the server.

775
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,200
Like I mean if.

776
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,380
You know if I can't speak the language.

777
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,040
Like I feel like it wouldn't be as fun.

778
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,100
Especially when like you know.

779
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,260
The majority about this is like the role play.

780
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,080
And like I don't want to force people.

781
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,000
To speak English.

782
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,660
You know.

783
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,480
So like at least like in this one.

784
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,160
I can understand Chinese.

785
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,760
So I can like at least like speak.

786
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,980
Sort of speak it.

787
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,040
I can like understand and listen.

788
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,040
To it.

789
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,300
So like at least I can like contribute.

790
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,080
At least.

791
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,140
At least I can like contribute.

792
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,340
To the conversation.

793
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,840
That's why I said yes.

794
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,220
To.

795
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,820
I said yes to like joining.

796
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,040
To joining the server.

797
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,920
So I'm really excited.

798
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,480
Huge shout out to Hiro.

799
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,280
For giving me an invite.

800
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,840
To the server.

801
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,800
What else?

802
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,040
I think that's really it.

803
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,040
In regards to.

804
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,680
I mean I wrote some stuff down.

805
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,840
Like what do I want to update.

806
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,200
My chat with.

807
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,660
Let's see.

808
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,100
I like how I'm looking at my server.

809
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,060
My discord server.

810
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,380
Where I write like notes and stuff.

811
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,240
And all of it is just like tech notes.

812
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,220
Down L2.

813
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,880
Forward forward 2.

814
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,400
Go for grab instead of instant heat smash.

815
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,520
Drawing heat.

816
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,120
Do tomahawk instead of instant heat.

817
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Running 3.

818
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,300
Then R3.

819
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,820
Like I'm just.

820
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,720
My server is just like notes of stuff to do.

821
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,820
And fucking tech.

822
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,120
Forward 3 route running.

823
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,860
Down back 2 3.

824
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,020
.

825
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,000
.

826
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,460
.

827
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:51,900
.

828
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,460
.

829
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,300
.

830
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,380
.

831
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,140
.

832
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,840
.

833
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,040
.

834
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,660
.

835
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,120
.

836
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,620
.

837
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
.

838
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
.

839
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
.

840
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,580
.

841
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:18,600
.

842
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:18,620
.

843
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:18,640
.

844
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
.

845
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,240
.

846
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,740
Technically.

847
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,740
But like next week is so exciting.

848
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,000
I oh my god.

849
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,140
Next week is going to be so fun.

850
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,920
I cannot wait for next week.

851
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,220
I wish I could just fast forward.

852
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,760
I'm super nervous about WrestleTuber.

853
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,280
I am really really nervous.

854
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,440
No spoilers.

855
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,220
No spoilers.

856
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,720
You'll see you'll know.

857
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,580
You'll know when you see the schedule guys.

858
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,340
No spoilers.

859
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,580
You'll know when you see the schedule.

860
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,480
But next week is going to be.

861
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Well for me.

862
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,000
For me, I'm gonna be having fun.

863
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,580
Like...

864
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,080
For me, it's gonna be a good time.

865
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm not gonna overhype it.

866
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,020
I'm just saying, I'm gonna have a good time.

867
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,580
Just gotta wait in anticipation.

868
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,720
Also, I noticed people were like, is the Anime North panel gonna be streamed?

869
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,920
No, it's an in-person event.

870
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,880
So like, you have to be there.

871
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,500
Well, I'll be digitally.

872
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,940
I'll be there digitally because I'm not real.

873
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,940
But like, you have to be at Anime North to go to that panel.

874
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,780
This is my first time doing a solo panel.

875
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,260
I've never done a solo panel before.

876
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,480
Apparently, there's gonna be a moderator there, so I can talk to...

877
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,560
What's it called?

878
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,220
A mediator?

879
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,720
Fuck, I don't know what it's called.

880
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,840
The person that tries to make sure everything goes well.

881
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,160
Um...

882
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,320
Um...

883
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,540
Um... and like...

884
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,260
I'm not sure yet if you can give me gifts yet.

885
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,120
I should have asked.

886
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,860
I think you can.

887
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,200
Media... yeah, it's a mediator.

888
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,520
Yeah.

889
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,720
So I think you can give me gifts and stuff, and then they'll ship it over.

890
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,220
Um... but like, let me... I need to make sure... I need to ask confirmation.

891
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,040
I won't be accepting anything like...

892
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,180
I won't be accepting... obviously, food.

893
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,640
I will not be accepting food.

894
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,580
I will not be accepting like...

895
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,580
um... electronics.

896
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,740
I will not be like...

897
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,380
like...

898
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,260
I will not be accepting electronics.

899
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,460
I will not be accepting like... um...

900
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,060
I don't think I'll be accepting like... um...

901
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,800
I guess like retail plushies.

902
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,240
I guess if it's like handmade or something.

903
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,600
Like...

904
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,240
I don't know.

905
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,400
I don't know what the rules are.

906
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,560
But like, if we are accepting gifts, um...

907
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,980
um... those are like my personal rules.

908
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,920
Just to make sure, like you know...

909
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,000
Will you accept real cash?

910
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,720
No, because the post office is gonna steal it.

911
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,280
Like...

912
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,260
This is why we don't send... you know back in the day?

913
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,800
Before PayPal was a thing?

914
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,960
People would literally send cash.

915
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,400
You guys remember that, right?

916
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,940
Like back... okay, no.

917
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,140
Some of you guys are way too young.

918
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,040
But back in the day, people would actually like...

919
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,000
um... put cash in their envelopes because PayPal wasn't a thing yet.

920
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,660
Which I... it always surprises me that fucking Elon Musk owns PayPal.

921
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,560
Anyway, great choice.

922
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,280
Thank you for the file.

923
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:32,840
Get the chips.

924
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,160
Thank you.

925
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,860
Thank you.

926
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,580
Thank you for the super chat.

927
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:35,900
Thank you.

928
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,280
Thank you.

929
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,500
And her name is John Doe King.

930
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,920
Do-do-do-do.

931
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,740
Thank you for the super chat.

932
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,160
Thank you.

933
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,660
Thank you.

934
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,320
Um... sending cash might be... No, it's not.

935
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,940
People used to put actual real dollar... real dollar bills in like envelopes and just send it over.

936
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,740
And then like um... the post office would uh...

937
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,100
Oh, he doesn't own PayPal anymore?

938
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,120
Didn't he used to?

939
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,000
He got... okay.

940
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,820
Yeah, that seems like something that would happen.

941
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,480
He was... when did he get kicked out?

942
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,960
Oh my god.

943
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,260
Oh yeah, remember!

944
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,560
Cause he wanted to call it X.

945
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,420
I remember now.

946
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,100
He tried to call like PayPal X.

947
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,620
And then PayPal was like bro.

948
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,000
That's I remembered.

949
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,680
Yeah, cause people were like bro this is not the first time he tried to rename a fucking website to X.

950
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,540
It's not stupid.

951
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,740
Yeah!

952
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,680
I remember now.

953
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,640
That's why I knew that I didn't want to.

954
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,140
Oh my gosh, it's so fun.

955
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,720
What a fun fact chat.

956
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,200
Um...

957
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,940
Um, friend!

958
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,180
Thank you for the akasupa!

959
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,560
Thank you, thank you.

960
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,680
Do you still accept supers?

961
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,280
Of course I do!

962
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,340
What the fuck?

963
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Thank you!

964
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,000
I like money.

965
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,340
Okay, like.

966
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,820
You can't be like, wow, dokey, uh, shameless much.

967
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,520
I like money.

968
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,120
You can't fucking judge me.

969
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,040
All of you like money.

970
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,060
It's like saying if you like breathing.

971
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,980
Thank you for the Akasupa.

972
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,480
Thank you.

973
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,100
I hate money.

974
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,420
Oh, you hate money?

975
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,400
Oh man.

976
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:43,760
If only there was a way to give away that money that you hate so much to somebody that likes money.

977
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,500
What can... what guys...

978
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:57,180
What do you think... what kind of solutions can we offer to that one person that hates money so much?

979
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:06,540
If only there was such a simple, easy way with just two presses of buttons that would send all that hate money over.

980
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,540
Charity.

981
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,420
My middle name is Charity.

982
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,460
It's a dokie charity bird.

983
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,240
Mr. Broken Pond thank you for the Akasupa.

984
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,760
Thank you.

985
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,720
I don't like money here.

986
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,240
Take it.

987
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,840
Money!

988
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,600
Love it!

989
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,540
Thank you for the Akasupa.

990
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,040
Thank you.

991
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,180
Oh man.

992
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,980
I hate money too.

993
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,420
Nexy thank you for the Akasupa.

994
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,000
Thank you Hirudoki.

995
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,500
I hate money, you can have mine.

996
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,880
Thank you the Akasupa.

997
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,580
Thank you.

998
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,760
Alex, thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

999
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,420
Thank you.

1000
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,160
Thank you guys.

1001
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,340
I really...

1002
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,540
Damn, so many money haters.

1003
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,500
What a shame.

1004
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,660
Oh my gosh.

1005
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
What was I saying before?

1006
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,380
I got so distracted.

1007
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,440
I got so distracted.

1008
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,780
What was I talking about before?

1009
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,620
Before I...

1010
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,580
The infinite money glitch.

1011
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,560
Oh yeah, yeah.

1012
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,700
Anime North.

1013
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,160
But yes.

1014
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,420
But yes, it is an in-person thing.

1015
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,620
It's not gonna be streamed or anything.

1016
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,280
The panel.

1017
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,980
So you guys have to be there to see what the fuck the panel is gonna be.

1018
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,300
I think it's just a Q&A.

1019
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,640
It's gonna be a Q&A session.

1020
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,460
So basically you go there, ask me questions and we hang out.

1021
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,980
It's like a stream, but like... you're there.

1022
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,180
It's like an exclusive stream.

1023
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,720
Oh yeah!

1024
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,020
It's like a member stream, but more exclusive.

1025
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,720
I think that's like the best way I can explain it honestly.

1026
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,780
Huh?

1027
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,040
What?

1028
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,460
It's true though!

1029
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,840
It's true!

1030
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,640
I feel like that... that's like basically what panels are.

1031
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,420
It's just like a member stream.

1032
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,180
But like it's a more... it's more exclusive.

1033
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,040
Um... I remember like... oh my gosh.

1034
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,160
I remember when like Anime North was like...

1035
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,140
Oh hey, we're gonna have to like... um...

1036
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,500
They were like... oh we're gonna have to like cap.

1037
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,280
They're like... oh sorry but only like X amount of dragoons can like be in the panel room.

1038
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,900
And I was like... that's... that's a lot.

1039
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,320
I don't remember.

1040
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,100
I think it was like 200.

1041
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,060
Let me look at what they said.

1042
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,220
I remember it and I was like... oh my god.

1043
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,360
They're like... oh yeah I hope you're okay.

1044
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,240
We like... if not everybody can... uh... be there.

1045
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,560
Like can like be in the room because like it's a fire hazard.

1046
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,540
I was like... bro that's a lot.

1047
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,420
Let me see what I said.

1048
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,280
And I felt so embarrassed.

1049
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,520
Because I was just like...

1050
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,760
Oh man like... that's... I don't know.

1051
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,900
I don't know if like... we'll even have that many people there.

1052
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,440
Let me see.

1053
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,340
Uh... oh my gosh.

1054
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,580
I wanna see like what I wrote.

1055
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,300
Cause it's sort of a little embarrassing.

1056
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Cause like I felt... I felt so bad when I said that.

1057
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,900
Um... let me see if I can find it.

1058
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,320
Uh...

1059
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,660
Oh my gosh.

1060
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,500
Is it the same person?

1061
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,280
Oh my gosh.

1062
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,520
Maybe this is for a different one.

1063
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:48,800
Uh...

1064
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,700
Let me see if I can find it.

1065
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,480
Wait is this the same person?

1066
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,460
Or was it for a different convention?

1067
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,500
There's so many conventions guys.

1068
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,320
There's...

1069
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,120
Uh...

1070
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,400
Fuck.

1071
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,820
Okay.

1072
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,740
I need to find it.

1073
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,320
Let's see.

1074
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,780
I wish I wrote... oh no I don't know where it was.

1075
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,360
I guess this wasn't the same person.

1076
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,800
Uh... I think it was 200.

1077
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,680
I think it was... I don't remember.

1078
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:17,660
But...

1079
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,360
It could have been a different person I was talking to.

1080
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,560
Um...

1081
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,000
No it has to be Anime North.

1082
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,560
Unless she's always an ARC.

1083
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
No okay it has to be.

1084
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,620
Uh...

1085
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,680
But anyway they're like is it okay if like...

1086
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:32,820
Uh...

1087
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,440
If like we have to like turn some dragoons.

1088
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,420
Like we might have to like have a hard cap of how many dragoons are allowed in the room.

1089
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,200
And I was like oh that's fine.

1090
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,220
I don't think we're gonna fucking fill that up.

1091
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,400
I was just...

1092
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,040
I was just like...

1093
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,920
I think that's fine.

1094
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,980
I don't think we're gonna...

1095
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,300
I don't think we're gonna fill up the room.

1096
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,580
I was just like...

1097
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,940
And then they're like oh we have a lot of...

1098
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,700
And then they're...

1099
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,820
I don't know.

1100
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,600
I was like I don't know.

1101
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,400
I don't know.

1102
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,460
I don't know how many dragoons are gonna be in Toronto.

1103
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,500
I don't know.

1104
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,960
So then they're like...

1105
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
Oh bro.

1106
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,880
They're like no we had this other VTuber and we had to cap...

1107
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,720
Hard cap it.

1108
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,880
And we actually get like a lot of people at our convention.

1109
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,000
I was like oh...

1110
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm sorry.

1111
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,900
I was like I'm so sorry I didn't know.

1112
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,920
I didn't know.

1113
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,100
I don't know.

1114
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,720
Okay to be fair in the previous panels...

1115
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,120
I never really know how many people are actually...

1116
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,700
I mean I could see there were a lot of people.

1117
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,980
But like in my head I'm just like oh yeah.

1118
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,820
Oh here we go.

1119
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,020
Okay it's 600.

1120
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,660
They're like the room seats 600 people.

1121
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,100
And it's a pretty hard cap from the fire marshal.

1122
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,880
And they're like oh and going by like...

1123
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,200
Like the crowd will be completely full.

1124
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,860
And I'll just be like I'll be surprised if I get 600.

1125
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,520
I'll just be like I'll be so surprised.

1126
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,740
I told him that.

1127
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,220
I told him.

1128
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,880
I was like no way.

1129
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,360
And they're like oh we've had like a thousand plus...

1130
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,720
They're like anyway.

1131
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,980
And then the organizer was like okay.

1132
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,840
We're just gonna pretend you're gonna get like a thousand plus people.

1133
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,580
Lining up just in case.

1134
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,460
They're like we're not gonna like not plan for this.

1135
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,320
Because I was like oh I think it'll be fine.

1136
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,560
I was like no I think I don't think you have to worry.

1137
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,960
Like about the line.

1138
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,460
And they're like and then the organizer was like...

1139
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:03,280
We're just gonna assume that we'll be prepared for like if a lot of people line up.

1140
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,800
And they're like...

1141
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:16,100
They're like Doki this convention has 37,000 people attending every year.

1142
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,780
And I was just like oh that's a lot.

1143
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,080
That's a lot of people.

1144
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,920
That is a lot of people.

1145
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,100
So yeah I mean I'll still be surprised.

1146
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,140
I really I will be very surprised.

1147
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,500
Because like I'm just one person.

1148
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,920
That's why I was like...

1149
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,280
I was like I'm just one person.

1150
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,700
So like I don't know if we get 600 people.

1151
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,220
I'll be very surprised.

1152
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,300
But I'll really appreciate it.

1153
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:59,420
I really appreciate it if you guys actually fill up the room.

1154
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,600
It'll be a blast.

1155
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,380
We're gonna party.

1156
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,380
We're gonna have so much fun.

1157
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:05,780
Yeah.

1158
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,120
Anime North is the first...

1159
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,220
Is the first convention in the Doki World Tour.

1160
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:16,960
Yippee!

1161
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:17,940
Yeah!

1162
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,240
I'm sorry that we couldn't do a meet and greet.

1163
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,780
Because like Anime North was like super last minute.

1164
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,460
I think.

1165
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,020
Because we saw the email from Anime North very late.

1166
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,960
So like we couldn't...

1167
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,220
At that time they were like full on like guests and stuff.

1168
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,500
But they slid me in last minute.

1169
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,060
And because of that we were able to...

1170
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,180
We were able to like have a panel.

1171
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,380
Because it was like the only thing that was like free.

1172
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:47,960
I guess.

1173
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:53,100
They didn't have enough time to actually set up any meet and greets and stuff like that.

1174
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,700
Only because they're like...

1175
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,820
It was like a last minute slip in for me.

1176
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,940
But I'm happy to still be able to do like you know...

1177
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,360
Do a panel at that convention.

1178
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,140
I know guys you're like World Tour.

1179
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,540
There's a lot of Canadian...

1180
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,320
Look guys!

1181
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,280
I've never had a chance to do a Canadian convention.

1182
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,680
Before.

1183
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,420
And like you know as a Canadian...

1184
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,260
As a Canadian...

1185
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,260
A VTuber...

1186
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,200
Like come on.

1187
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,860
Let me have this.

1188
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,180
The American goons had almost all the conventions guys.

1189
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,480
Let the Canadians have one.

1190
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,260
Not one but like maybe several.

1191
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:38,290
Also.

1192
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:39,830
Another update.

1193
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:40,810
Um.

1194
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,670
Yes.

1195
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:44,930
I've been getting a lot of emails regarding shipments of the debut merch.

1196
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,970
I'm really sorry that it's been taking a while.

1197
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:47,310
Um.

1198
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,630
We were uh...

1199
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:54,410
Like negotiations with the distributor is taking surprisingly longer than I expected.

1200
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:55,390
Um.

1201
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:00,350
So like currently the only orders that are going out at the moment are the orders that I've personally packaged.

1202
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,070
And I think I've packaged like 200 orders myself.

1203
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:08,090
So like there's a lot of da- There's a lot of orders.

1204
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,950
So I'm really sorry.

1205
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,630
I'm gonna post it to Twitter.

1206
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,630
I'm gonna post it on Twitter update at the moment.

1207
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,350
Uh.

1208
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,130
So.

1209
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:13,930
Uh.

1210
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,370
Uh.

1211
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,630
Like I- I won't be shy about like how many.

1212
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,090
I'll let you guys know.

1213
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:25,690
There has been 6,000 plus merch orders.

1214
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,510
Not just from debut but like for the Lunar New Year as well.

1215
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,290
Uh.

1216
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,910
But the moment we get the distributor thing.

1217
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:33,890
Um.

1218
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,030
The moment we get the distributor thing.

1219
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:36,930
Uh.

1220
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,030
Finalized.

1221
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,950
It will go out so fast.

1222
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,850
I'm going to try to do it faster.

1223
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:46,050
At the moment, I'm currently packaging it myself.

1224
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,550
When I do have the time.

1225
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,850
Because obviously, time is not on my side.

1226
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,610
So, those lucky people...

1227
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:05,090
Some of you have actually already received the packages.

1228
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,010
That I have packaged myself.

1229
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,490
But yes, that's why...

1230
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:16,290
I'm sorry that the orders are going out not as fast as I would have liked.

1231
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,270
That's why I haven't had any new merch drops.

1232
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,410
There's been plans for new merch drops.

1233
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,090
I've had plans done for it.

1234
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,050
And I am holding on to a merch drop at the moment.

1235
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,130
But I told them...

1236
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,370
I'm not releasing any new merch.

1237
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:35,610
Until we start officially...

1238
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:36,930
Not by me.

1239
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:38,710
But by a distributor.

1240
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,850
Shipping these out.

1241
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,070
Because like...

1242
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:45,730
Because like...

1243
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,250
I obviously want to get that...

1244
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,570
I want to get that...

1245
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:50,370
Situated.

1246
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:51,710
Before...

1247
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:55,670
Before releasing anything new.

1248
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,150
I would say...

1249
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,310
I know I talked about this before.

1250
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:03,010
But if I did have regular merch going in...

1251
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,730
If I was releasing regular merch...

1252
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,250
Every fucking month...

1253
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,290
There's a new merch or anything.

1254
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:09,190
Merch would have...

1255
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,350
Basically made...

1256
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,430
Would be like 60-70% of my income.

1257
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,030
If I kept the merch stuff going.

1258
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,130
If I kept the merch stuff going.

1259
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:19,510
If I kept the merch stuff going.

1260
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,110
If I kept the merch stuff going.

1261
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,590
Because like...

1262
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:26,490
Merch is like...

1263
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,210
It's such a huge income.

1264
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:28,530
It's such a huge income.

1265
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:29,850
In general.

1266
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,270
I didn't realize how big of a difference...

1267
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:34,670
Merch can be.

1268
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,030
Until I started selling my own merch.

1269
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,370
Because like...

1270
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,870
The amount I was making off of merch...

1271
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,470
When I released the debut merch...

1272
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,490
And the Lunar New Year...

1273
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:44,530
Was absolutely crazy.

1274
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,230
I was just like...

1275
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,670
I'm not...

1276
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,550
I'm going to be transparent.

1277
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,530
I am making...

1278
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,350
If I actually kept releasing new merch drops...

1279
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,550
I can make a lot of money from it.

1280
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,670
But I want to get situated...

1281
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,710
First...

1282
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,630
With the fact that I want to make sure...

1283
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,730
That everybody is getting their merch.

1284
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:07,990
Like...

1285
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,630
And they don't wait...

1286
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:10,910
It's not delayed too long.

1287
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,930
And that's why I'm not releasing anything new.

1288
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:14,390
Until...

1289
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,990
Until all of that is like...

1290
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,510
Fucking done.

1291
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,530
Until we have a...

1292
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,070
System for it.

1293
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:26,250
And...

1294
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,190
And that's why...

1295
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,070
There's no new releases and stuff.

1296
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,030
Like I have...

1297
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,770
I even have graphics made for the next drop.

1298
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,630
But like we're not releasing this...

1299
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,390
Until like much much later.

1300
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,230
I think like I showed it...

1301
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,950
People in the members might have seen it...

1302
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:43,730
Seen it already.

1303
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:45,170
Because I did show it.

1304
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,470
I'll show you guys what it is.

1305
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:50,710
But it's basically...

1306
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,510
Uh...

1307
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:53,390
Uh...

1308
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,470
It's basically the...

1309
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,450
I was planning on doing a merch drop...

1310
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,690
Of the...

1311
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,010
Of the intro.

1312
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,070
Let me see if I can...

1313
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:02,790
I'm gonna try to explain it.

1314
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:03,430
Because like...

1315
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,350
There's...

1316
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,650
There's no naming system for my shit.

1317
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,070
There's no naming...

1318
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:13,750
Oh here it is.

1319
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:14,810
Okay...

1320
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,910
I think it's this.

1321
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:18,990
Uh...

1322
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:20,610
Alright.

1323
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,910
So like this was gonna be the next...

1324
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:24,750
Uh...

1325
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,510
Merch drop.

1326
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,650
That's gonna be like on hold.

1327
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:28,270
Until...

1328
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,470
Until everything is okay.

1329
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,390
People in the members have already...

1330
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,310
Seen it.

1331
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,730
But like it was basically like stickers and buttons were gonna be...

1332
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:42,070
Gotcha.

1333
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,630
Because like there was a lot.

1334
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,110
We have... So it would be like...

1335
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,030
Stuff like this.

1336
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,730
I mean the stats...

1337
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,610
You can like... If you want to...

1338
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,490
You can have it all and create your own fucking...

1339
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,630
Dancing... Dancing doki...

1340
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:59,230
Like stats where you could choose.

1341
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,590
Um...

1342
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,970
You can choose which one.

1343
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,710
And then uh...

1344
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,190
I think this one had... No.

1345
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,310
What is it?

1346
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,550
And then there was like...

1347
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,410
There was like gotcha for the stickers.

1348
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,970
Because there was more choices to it.

1349
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,170
Uh... So like stickers were gotcha.

1350
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:17,370
So I could just like stick my hand in and be like...

1351
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,370
Okay well when we have distributor...

1352
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,650
The distributor was gonna stick their hand in.

1353
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:23,510
Hahahaha.

1354
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:24,610
Hahahaha.

1355
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:26,490
Hahahaha.

1356
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:28,690
But like...

1357
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:32,930
Like I said we're not releasing that until we fucking figure out...

1358
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:33,830
Until like...

1359
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:36,690
The distributors shit is like...

1360
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,630
Finally situated and stuff.

1361
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:39,870
The negotiations took...

1362
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,590
Is taking much longer.

1363
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,690
Like I said it's taking much longer than I expected.

1364
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:44,950
Um...

1365
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,950
Because like at first...

1366
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:48,670
Um... I guess like the dis...

1367
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,070
Like when we were talking...

1368
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,230
The distributors... We were talking to multiple distributors.

1369
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,470
They were not prepared...

1370
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,250
For the amount of orders...

1371
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,170
I was gonna get.

1372
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,730
So the negotiations were taking much longer.

1373
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,010
Because when we were telling them like...

1374
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,750
Yeah these are like the amount of pre-orders we're getting.

1375
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:05,970
They're like... Whoa!

1376
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,290
Hahahaha.

1377
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:09,210
Hahahaha.

1378
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,310
Hahahaha.

1379
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,150
That's a lot more than we expected.

1380
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:16,350
Hahahaha.

1381
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:17,910
Hahahaha.

1382
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:19,550
Hahahaha.

1383
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,090
I really appreciate it Dragoons.

1384
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,190
For like the huge amount of support.

1385
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:26,710
Uh...

1386
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,590
For the merch in general.

1387
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,710
And I really appreciate your patience.

1388
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,170
Because we have been getting a lot of emails.

1389
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:37,850
Because I know I did say like you know...

1390
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,630
Like around this time things will be sent out.

1391
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,310
And it hasn't been sent out yet.

1392
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:42,890
Um...

1393
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,390
It's just that I'll be doing a Twitter and a community post update.

1394
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,290
For it later.

1395
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:48,290
Um...

1396
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:49,010
Because I've been waiting.

1397
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,210
I've been waiting to see if we finalized the negotiations.

1398
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,310
But obviously we haven't.

1399
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:54,070
Hahahaha.

1400
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:54,770
Hahahaha.

1401
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:56,190
Hahahaha.

1402
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:58,350
So...

1403
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,150
I know we've been getting a lot of emails about it.

1404
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,650
Every day about like...

1405
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,930
Oh when is the order coming in.

1406
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:05,930
But I'll...

1407
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,210
I'm gonna keep you guys updated.

1408
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:12,590
And like I'm gonna put out a Twitter update about it as well.

1409
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:13,730
Um...

1410
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,650
But yeah it's actually crazy.

1411
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:16,830
Thank you guys so much.

1412
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:19,370
Like honestly like if...

1413
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,630
I just kept going with the merch drops.

1414
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:23,410
Like...

1415
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,390
I think like...

1416
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,910
Obviously now it's not really a big...

1417
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,010
Like not a big part of my income at the moment.

1418
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,050
But definitely...

1419
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,730
I think like if I...

1420
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,390
Like...

1421
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,570
If I like kept the rate of doing merch drops.

1422
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:38,650
Um...

1423
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:42,030
If I had like merch drops every other month or every month.

1424
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:44,130
That could have easily been like...

1425
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,070
60-70% of my income.

1426
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,150
If I kept at it.

1427
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,710
Like I'm gonna be super transparent with you guys.

1428
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:51,590
That is literally...

1429
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,050
That is like... that could be 60-70% of my income.

1430
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:58,410
If I kept at it like every month or every other month.

1431
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,770
But I decided not to.

1432
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,250
Because ethically like morally I was like...

1433
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,350
I need to figure out this shit first.

1434
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,470
I need to figure out this shit first.

1435
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:10,630
I need to figure out this shit first.

1436
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:11,770
Um...

1437
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,850
Are voice packs still on?

1438
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:15,510
Yeah we're planning on voice packs.

1439
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,210
Later on in the future.

1440
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:18,390
Um...

1441
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,390
I just didn't have a time.

1442
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:20,870
Like we haven't hired a script...

1443
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:22,930
We have had resumes for script writers and stuff.

1444
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,610
I'm planning on hiring more people for my team as well.

1445
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,650
Because like...

1446
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:30,750
I definitely want to expand the Doki team more.

1447
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:31,610
I definitely want to expand the Doki team more.

1448
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:31,910
Uh...

1449
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,090
So that we have people that are responsible.

1450
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:39,710
Cause like at the moment merch design and like merch stuff is mostly from me.

1451
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:40,350
Cause like at the moment merch design and like merch stuff is mostly from me.

1452
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,590
Like coming up with these things.

1453
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,210
But definitely in the future.

1454
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,370
I'm looking to definitely have like...

1455
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,290
Hire like...

1456
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,630
Like a person or a team that's dedicated to like...

1457
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,510
Designing new merch and stuff.

1458
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,210
And not designing new...

1459
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,970
I guess not designing new merch but like...

1460
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,430

1481
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:41,050
The artist just sent me like a draft of it.

And stuff like...

1484
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:45,810
Just like the logo's being done.

1485
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,410
Uh...

1486
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,610
But it's not like the belt itself.

1487
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,870
But it's like the logo's and stuff.

1488
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,130
And I think it looks really good.

1489
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:54,110

There's like actual texture.

1509
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:30,690

01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,010
Is it embossed?

1511
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,450
Is that what it's called?

1512
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:34,810

01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:30,490
We like hit some...

1579
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:32,350
Bumps in the road.

1580
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:35,070
Because like I was also really busy and they needed...

1581
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,310
Like they needed me to like...

1582
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,230
Figure out like colors...

1583
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,570
And stuff of like how the server looks like.

1584
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,610
So like...

1585
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,210
Okay let me show you like a before and after.

1586
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:46,670
Hahahaha.

1587
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:50,030
We will redecorate this later.

1588
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:51,950
Okay I know like the colors right now.

1589
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:53,190
They might not be like the best.

1590
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,050
Hahahaha.

1591
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:57,390
Like...

1592
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,370
Um...

1593
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:01,310
Um...

1594
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:01,730
Anyway.

1595
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:02,910
So like...

1596
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:03,410
Uh...

1597
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:07,490
Cause like okay this was the original color for the main hub.

1598
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,730
We're gonna change the main hub later.

1599
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,950
Cause at first like I wanna give you guys more...

1600
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:11,710
Like... Okay sorry.

1601
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,590
For those...

1602
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:15,270
For those who don't know we are starting a...

1603
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:16,550
Members uh...

1604
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:17,930
Dragoon Minecraft server.

1605
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:20,550
But like I'll be streaming the server publicly.

1606
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,290
Because you can't like...

1607
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,910
You can put the server like join the server behind a paywall.

1608
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,530
But you can't stream Minecraft behind a paywall.

1609
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:28,510
Uh...

1610
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,490
But like I know like it's been in the works.

1611
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,070
Cause there's been like a lot of stuff going on.

1612
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,710
But like this was the original concept for the lobby.

1613
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,430
But I was like that's just too brown.

1614
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:37,410
Hahahaha.

1615
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,850
I was like oh my gosh.

1616
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:41,770
It's just brown.

1617
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:42,390
Hahahaha.

1618
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,170
And then we're gonna also later on.

1619
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,630
When we actually have people in the lobby.

1620
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,630
So then we like put more color into it.

1621
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,950
Like and so it looks like this now.

1622
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,010
I know it looks...

1623
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:55,530
Weird.

1624
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:56,710
Hahahaha.

1625
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:59,070
Hahahaha.

1626
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,770
But like um...

1627
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:03,930
Um...

1628
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,450
I know there's like a lot of colors.

1629
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,110
Uh... But like I said this is just...

1630
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,490
A main lobby.

1631
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,710
Uh... It is just a...

1632
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:14,010
Uh... It's just a main lobby.

1633
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:14,610
For now.

1634
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,290
So like obviously you all spawn in here.

1635
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:18,670
All you guys will spawn.

1636
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,790
Like there's gonna be... You guys will all spawn in here.

1637
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,930
So you can create better...

1638
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,750
Like when you join your faction.

1639
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,910
You can create like...

1640
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,010
Uh...

1641
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:31,270
You can create like better builds if you want.

1642
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:33,470
And like later on the main lobby.

1643
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,670
Will get upgraded the more...

1644
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:36,970
The more we play.

1645
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,930
Because like now they're like what do you want?

1646
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:40,990
And I'm like I don't know.

1647
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:42,690
Hahahaha.

1648
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:44,150
Hahahaha.

1649
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:49,010
They're like Doki what do you want for your main lobby?

1650
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,270
And I'm like I don't fucking know.

1651
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,470
I don't... I don't know.

1652
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:54,730
I don't...

1653
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:54,730
I don't know.

1654
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:55,990
So they made this.

1655
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,430
From like the notes I gave them.

1656
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,170
Which was I don't know.

1657
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:01,370
Hahahaha.

1658
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:03,030
Hahahaha.

1659
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:04,770
So...

1660
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,390
So I really appreciate it.

1661
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,590
From...

1662
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:11,690
From like the designers.

1663
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:15,010
For making this based off of my notes.

1664
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:16,570
Which was no notes.

1665
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:17,690
In general.

1666
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:18,550
So...

1667
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:19,530
Hahahaha.

1668
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,370
So like I'm...

1669
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:25,330
That's why I was like I'm fine with this for now.

1670
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:26,730
Because I think like later on.

1671
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,790
When we like figure out what we want.

1672
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:31,150
I don't know.

1673
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:33,430
I don't know what main hubs should look like.

1674
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,550
Like I've been streaming for like three months.

1675
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:37,790
Like what do I have?

1676
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:38,570
Like I don't know.

1677
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:38,570
I don't know what main hubs should look like.

1678
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:38,570
Like I've been streaming for like three months.

1679
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:38,570
Like what do I have?

1680
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:39,010
Like...

1681
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:42,910
We'll build on it more later.

1682
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,630
Later it'll look different.

1683
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,030
Guys I swear.

1684
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:50,310
Guys I swear.

1685
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:52,070
It'll look different later.

1686
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:53,550
It'll look different later.

1687
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:54,210
Anyway.

1688
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,250
Anyway so you guys are like wondering.

1689
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:58,470
Okay so like what do you mean by factions?

1690
01:05:58,650 --> 01:05:59,590
So like...

1691
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,590
So like you can...

1692
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,430
You have to push a button and then you're gonna be taken to this island.

1693
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,750
Where...

1694
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,570
You're gonna be like picked up by the...

1695
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,550
King which faction you wanna join.

1696
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:11,990
Um...

1697
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:14,750
So obviously there's like...

1698
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,730
Aegon, the Dragoon...

1699
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:17,690
And stuff like that.

1700
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,070
So you can pick your faction.

1701
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,750
So obviously...

1702
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:22,730
Uh...

1703
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:23,790
Uh...

1704
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:27,610
The territory will not be linked to your...

1705
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,130
You also can claim your land.

1706
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,790
So like each person has like...

1707
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,990
An amount of blocks they can claim.

1708
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,110
And uh...

1709
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,130
Like I said this is for members.

1710
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:38,890
Like to join a server you have to be a member.

1711
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:42,230
Uh but we'll be streaming the server on public streams.

1712
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:44,750
Like the gameplay of this will be streamed.

1713
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,950
So obviously like...

1714
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:47,570
You each get to claim land.

1715
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:49,690
Uh so you know...

1716
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,410
People won't be griefing each other.

1717
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,790
Like you know...

1718
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,290
You leave your build.

1719
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:01,490
Can we invade people's lands if they didn't claim it?

1720
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:02,270
Yeah you can.

1721
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:04,390
There will be like PvP zones too.

1722
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,170
We'll have like areas where you can fight if you want to.

1723
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:08,110
Um...

1724
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:09,490
So...

1725
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,530
Uh yes and then we'll have like...

1726
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,450
Like resource areas as well.

1727
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:14,650
Uh...

1728
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,390
So that's why like...

1729
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:18,890
Uh... that's like...

1730
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:20,730
That's basically what it's gonna be like.

1731
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:21,470
Uh...

1732
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,250
So that's an update on the Minecraft stuff.

1733
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:25,890
Anyway!

1734
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,710
I'll give you guys an hour...

1735
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,650
And 15 minutes of a head start.

1736
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,210
Let me finish one task.

1737
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:33,610
And win this race guys.

1738
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,490
Like that's literally all I have to do.

1739
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,050
I just need to finish one fucking task.

1740
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:43,940
That's all.

1741
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,220
I don't know.

1742
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,600
I guess they're not making this much of a competition right now.

1743
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,880
Only like...

1744
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,160
Really?

1745
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,500
I gave you guys an hour?

1746
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,940
And 30 minutes?

1747
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:55,180
Almost an hour and 20 minutes?

1748
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,420
And you're only up to 22%?

1749
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,000
Not even 25%?

1750
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,160
This is ridiculous.

1751
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:03,900
This is ridiculous.

1752
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,120
Like...

1753
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,520
Don't let her win!

1754
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:10,580
Don't let her win!

1755
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,740
I don't know guys!

1756
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,880
To be fair, you guys aren't even helping each other.

1757
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,220
Um...

1758
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,140
Um...

1759
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,160
Because like...

1760
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,280
You're adding more stuff to it.

1761
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,700
Uh... in the way that like...

1762
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,940
You're sabotaging yourself.

1763
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,100
So like...

1764
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,120
It really only takes...

1765
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,320
Several dragoons To fuck over everybody.

1766
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,940
I like just got here.

1767
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,780
It's like, bro, there's the backfiller.

1768
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,660
Buster the backfiller there.

1769
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,180
He just got here and he already lost.

1770
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,620
Alright, rigged.

1771
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,040
Why?

1772
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,180
Alright, you guys better remember what you fucking wrote too.

1773
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,160
Alright, time to work guys.

1774
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,020
No more chatting.

1775
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,400
It's actually time to work guys.

1776
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,600
I zazzed on for like an hour and 30 minutes in his work day.

1777
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,200
Oh.

1778
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,820
Usually, okay, guys, do you think it's worth the risk to listen to like Disney jazz?

1779
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:10,960
You think?

1780
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,380
We don't need to monetize.

1781
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,520
It's a chatting stream.

1782
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,100
Fuck it.

1783
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:18,340
I know like it's lo-fi, but like I don't care.

1784
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,440
I usually listen to Disney jazz to help work.

1785
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,680
Okay, Disney jazz.

1786
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:24,640
No.

1787
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:27,500
Dude.

1788
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,620
I just lose ad revenue.

1789
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,340
Who cares?

1790
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:32,880
It's just ad revenue.

1791
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,620
It's just ad revenue.

1792
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:43,420
They just fucking- Oh no, my fucking five dollars.

1793
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,440
They can't.

1794
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,940
Okay, alright.

1795
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,100
If it's not- Okay, Stu- Okay.

1796
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,820
Studio Ghibli might be a little bit more ambitious though to be fair because it's Japan, so.

1797
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,440
Studio Ghibli Cafe Jazz.

1798
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:02,760
Alright, Wakata Jazz, that's like less- Disney and Studio Ghibli?

1799
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:03,840
Alright, let's play football.

1800
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,280
Let's play football with fire.

1801
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,540
Let's get Japan and Disney involved.

1802
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,540
Let's fucking go.

1803
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,080
Japan and Disney involved.

1804
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,080
Nice.

1805
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,940
Uh, that's- Bro, oh my god.

1806
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,940
Is there Studio Ghibli, Nintendo, and Disney jazz?

1807
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:27,380
Okay, Ghibli, Nintendo, Disney, and Jazz.

1808
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:29,140
Let's put all three in there.

1809
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:29,900
We might as well.

1810
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:30,960
Uh.

1811
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:31,560
Uh.

1812
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:35,650
Uh.

1813
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:36,670
You're right.

1814
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:37,970
We gotta throw in some Nintendo.

1815
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,010
Alright, let's see.

1816
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:43,470
Alright.

1817
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:44,690
I got you guys.

1818
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:46,610
We're gonna put like Nintendo.

1819
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:48,010

01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:48,950
Oh my gosh.

1821
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,790
Let's start out with like the Animal Crossing jazz.

1822
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,070
Is this Animal Crossing?

1823
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:54,590
Yeah.

1824
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,330
Alright, let's start it off.

1825
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:59,010
Someone stop her!

1826
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:05,770
Alright, we're gonna do Studio Ghibli, Nintendo, and...

1827
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:06,190
Uh.

1828
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,290
And Disney.

1829
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:09,670
All in one.

1830
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,390
Let's go.

1831
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:11,850
Might as well.

1832
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,630
I mean, we might as well commit, you know?

1833
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:18,310
Like, if we're gonna go this route, we commit to it.

1834
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:19,110
Uh.

1835
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:23,650
Kaz Doki demonetized speedrun any% Thank you for the super chat.

1836
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:24,910
Thank you, thank you!

1837
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,670
Nothing can stop me!

1838
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,590
No, I think I'd rather go with the jazz first.

1839
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:36,070
Actually.

1840
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:37,890
There you go.

1841
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:38,690
That's fine.

1842
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:40,430
Bum.

1843
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:41,430
Ba dum bum.

1844
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:44,210
That's fine.

1845
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,830
We'll be fine.

1846
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:51,690
We'll be fine.

1847
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:55,270
It's jazz!

1848
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:56,710
Everybody loves jazz!

1849
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,110
Alright, let's work.

1850
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,350
What do I have to do?

1851
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:02,550
Answer your... Okay, I have to do Discord DMs.

1852
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:15,550
Ba dum ba dum bum.

1853
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,250
Let's see.

1854
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:21,250
Ba dum bum.

1855
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,710
I'll answer my Discord DMs first.

1856
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:27,070
Ba dum ba dum bum.

1857
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,040
Ba.

1858
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,160
Can your friends do this?

1859
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,820
Can your friends do that?

1860
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,640
Put on your little hat.

1861
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,470
I don't think you guys should cheer for 25%.

1862
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:50,130
I literally have to do one task, guys.

1863
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:53,170
Taurus, thank you for the 10 gift ships.

1864
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:53,590
Thank you.

1865
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:14,180
Alright, we're going to be making a highlight video for the Sajam Slam.

1866
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:22,000
So if you guys couldn't catch like, you know, three fucking vods, that's our like five plus hours each.

1867
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,100
We will have a highlights video being made.

1868
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,680
I don't know when it's going to be uploaded though.

1869
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,280
I hope you guys are being productive too, chat.

1870
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,700
Oh yeah, I need to join the Anime North Discord.

1871
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,860
Forgot about that.

1872
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,200
Yay!

1873
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:38,160
Almost forgot to join Anime North Discord server.

1874
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:53,110
Do you guys need the music to be louder?

1875
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:54,410
Or is it fine?

1876
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:58,350
Define productive.

1877
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:02,370
Yeah, help your fellow dragoons out!

1878
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:07,310
You've only completed 68%...

1879
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:10,490
No, 68 out of 263.

1880
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,750
I can move it a little bit higher.

1881
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,500
Is it better now?

1882
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,350
Ba dum bum.

1883
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:09,530
What the fuck?

1884
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:11,870
Does someone get heirloom from Apex pack?

1885
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:12,870
Oh my god.

1886
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:14,890
You want the dragoons to fail.

1887
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:15,930
Like...

1888
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,610
What are these fucking impossible tasks?

1889
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:24,970
Someone was like, add, get heirloom from an Apex pack.

1890
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,160
Sabotage.

1891
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,260
So, mod delete that one.

1892
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,720
Mod, please, please delete this.

1893
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,620
The dragoons are paying.

1894
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:24,560
I'm not deleting that because it's feasible.

1895
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:30,300
Someone quick, fund that dragoon so they can get their heirloom.

1896
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,100
I like how Din Vizel was like, do one push up.

1897
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:04,760
Done.

1898
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,300
Did one push up.

1899
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,300
Someone give Din Vizel a medal.

1900
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,560
He did one push up.

1901
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,850
10 minute push up.

1902
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,300
Oh, you guys see that?

1903
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:33,880
There he is.

1904
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,260
Get heirloom from Apex.

1905
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:35,860
There he is.

1906
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,520
It showed up on the to do list guys.

1907
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:39,400
It's there.

1908
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,040
Now you know who to blame.

1909
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:10,790
Boyta, thank you for the super chat.

1910
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:11,550
Thank you, thank you.

1911
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:15,250
I'm so hyped for when they see you open up that Minecraft PPP server.

1912
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:16,870
I waited on this for years.

1913
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:17,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1914
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:18,070
Thank you, thank you.

1915
01:22:18,110 --> 01:22:18,410
Me too.

1916
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:21,770
I'm really happy to be able to open that soon.

1917
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:23,890
Super excited.

1918
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,450
I'm pretty sure you guys are going to be so creative.

1919
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:29,950
And like, I want to build more on this.

1920
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:36,210
I want to go on to that server and maybe host like some Minecraft events in that server too for like community events too in the future.

1921
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:45,330
Because I have like an actual Minecraft team that can like they work on like they the team that hired to do the server.

1922
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:50,930
They've worked for like Twitch and stuff for like Minecraft, Twitch rivals.

1923
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:55,930
So they're able to develop like actual like events and stuff for us in the future.

1924
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,710
Like member events.

1925
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:12,000
So like we're obviously going to build up more and more of it.

1926
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,400
And like it's not just going to be like something I'm just going to let it die.

1927
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,940
I'm going to make sure that we can improve it more and more.

1928
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,560
And there's always going to be players on it too.

1929
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:25,180
There's always going to be people on the server.

1930
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,480
And it's always going to be fun.

1931
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:33,180
And if like I might have I want in the future to implement a system.

1932
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,120
Like obviously like...

1933
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:45,920
If like I feel like if X amount of maybe like if more than they haven't been back to server after like you know like three to four months or something.

1934
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:50,660
Their builds like the like their builds won't be protected.

1935
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:53,740
So that if like you know obviously people come and go.

1936
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:59,080
I think in the future I'm not sure like I'm not sure like the time frame.

1937
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:02,920
I don't want to be as make it the server so that like new people can come in.

1938
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,480
And the new people can't come in and have nowhere else to build.

1939
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,120
So I want like in the future.

1940
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:13,000
If there's like a deserted builds or stuff like that.

1941
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,520
There's like a way to like...

1942
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,320
What's the word?

1943
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:20,600
There's a way to make sure like new players can still can join in.

1944
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,280
And have like somewhere to build.

1945
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:33,150
You meant silly and dumb Minecraft?

1946
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:34,130
No because the...

1947
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:35,630
Okay if it's silly yes.

1948
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:38,050
But the actual Minecraft drama.

1949
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:38,690
Like...

1950
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:47,750
We do not want to be involved in any Minecraft drama.

1951
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:51,150
In any real Minecraft drama.

1952
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:53,810
That shit is off limits.

1953
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:58,430
There is Minecraft.

1954
01:24:58,610 --> 01:24:59,090
Yes.

1955
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:00,790
Just like in Smash.

1956
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:03,020
Because the...

1957
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:04,190
I'm sorry.

1958
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:08,670
But like the Minecraft and Smash communities are predominantly chat.

1959
01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:08,970
And they are children.

1960
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,850
And because of that...

1961
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:15,630
It is not a fun time.

1962
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,310
You don't...

1963
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:23,010
You don't want to be near that shit.

1964
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,840
It's because a lot of people get popular.

1965
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,100
I'm gonna say it.

1966
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:40,900
I'm gonna say it.

1967
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:41,660
It's not really...

1968
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:42,160
I don't think...

1969
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,780
I don't think it's like a super...

1970
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,120
Uh...

1971
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,320
I don't think it's like a super like you know...

1972
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,280
Hot topic...

1973
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,260
Thing to say.

1974
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,500
But like...

1975
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,700
Um...

1976
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:52,640
Um...

1977
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,740
A lot of the people...

1978
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,400
Who get popular really fast...

1979
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,590
In Minecraft...

1980
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,300
They've never been...

1981
01:25:59,300 --> 01:25:59,820
Okay.

1982
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:00,800
It's so fucked up.

1983
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,820
They've never peaked before.

1984
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:09,520
So like the most intention they ever got...

1985
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,940
Was in Minecraft.

1986
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,240
Um...

1987
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,640
I was playing Minecraft.

1988
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,260
And majority of it...

1989
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:15,650
Are...

1990
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:16,720
Are like...

1991
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,240
You know...

1992
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:17,900
Like they're like...

1993
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:18,460
Oh my god.

1994
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,880
Look at all this attention...

1995
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,800
That I'm getting.

1996
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:21,900
Um...

1997
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,380
Nobody ever gave me that much attention before.

1998
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,660
Oh my god.

1999
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,880
People actually...

2000
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,560
Oh my god.

2001
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,480
And then they're like...

2002
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,540
I have so much power.

2003
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,680
Then they're like...

2004
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,020
Super young as well.

2005
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:39,860
They're super young.

2006
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,360
And that's the scary part.

2007
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,500
When someone is like...

2008
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,540
Really young...

2009
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:44,720
And have...

2010
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,400
Like...

2011
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,080
So much...

2012
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,220
Attention...

2013
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,520
And money...

2014
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,200
Um...

2015
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,880
And never really like had consequences.

2016
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,020
And it gets to their head...

2017
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,780
Real quick.

2018
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:01,280
Yes.

2019
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:02,240
Um...

2020
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,120
Cause like you know...

2021
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,680
Being like a millionaire...

2022
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,020
At like 18...

2023
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:06,700
Is...

2024
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,380
Nothing...

2025
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:08,920
Okay...

2026
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,640
Not nothing...

2027
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,320
But like...

2028
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,040
Having an 18 year old millionaire...

2029
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,700
Is scary.

2030
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,140
Because...

2031
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:17,960
Because...

2032
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,360
An 18 year old millionaire...

2033
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,360
Would think...

2034
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,200
Wow...

2035
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:27,000
When you give an 18 year old...

2036
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,720
That much money...

2037
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,020
You don't...

2038
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,660
You don't wanna know what they're gonna spend.

2039
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,600
I feel like that rarely ends well.

2040
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,720
And that's the Minecraft community.

2041
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:44,800
And...

2042
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,960
And...

2043
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:46,060
And...

2044
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,180
And that is...

2045
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,000
The Minecraft community.

2046
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,980
Sometimes they're not even 18...

2047
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,460
Sometimes they're 16...

2048
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:54,420
With million...

2049
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:55,840
With millions of dollars.

2050
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:00,860
Um...

2051
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:03,600
But yes, we don't wanna be involved in any Minecraft drama.

2052
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,120
Oh and then the worst part...

2053
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:07,840
Is that...

2054
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,200
Even when they have that drama...

2055
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,120
All they have to do...

2056
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,900
Is just wait a couple of months...

2057
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:13,880
And then like...

2058
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,680
They're fine.

2059
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,620
Haha...

2060
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,040
I know...

2061
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,140
But it doesn't matter.

2062
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,360
Because...

2063
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:18,940
Um...

2064
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:21,120
You might say the internet will always remember.

2065
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,520
But like...

2066
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,900
Children don't.

2067
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:24,320
Haha...

2068
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,680
Children will never remember.

2069
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,200
Hahaha...

2070
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,160
Haha...

2071
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,980
They're like...

2072
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,200
But he funny.

2073
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:37,280
Haha...

2074
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:37,720
He's...

2075
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,260
He...

2076
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,460
He's funny though.

2077
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:42,100
Haha...

2078
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:42,860
Haha...

2079
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,640
Not a...

2080
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,100
Haha...

2081
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,020
Maturity.

2082
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:51,060
Haha...

2083
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,850
Why bad when funny?

2084
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:58,650
Haha...

2085
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:00,010
There are new...

2086
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:00,810
True...

2087
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,310
There's new children take their place.

2088
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:03,450
Haha...

2089
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,260
That's why the Minecraft community scares me.

2090
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,200
I mean...

2091
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:18,760
Like...

2092
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,260
We can all see...

2093
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:22,480
Like...

2094
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:23,940
Like...

2095
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:24,500
Okay...

2096
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,820
It's not really a huge...

2097
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,580
Like...

2098
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:27,620
Not like...

2099
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:28,160
Oh my god...

2100
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:28,540
Doki...

2101
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:29,620
You're not supposed to talk about it.

2102
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,280
But...

2103
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:30,740
Like...

2104
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,260
Easily...

2105
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:31,880
The dream...

2106
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:32,540
Like...

2107
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:33,480
The whole dream...

2108
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,940
SMP or whatever...

2109
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,120
Like...

2110
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:40,980
Everybody that's part of the dream group got fucking into some sort of controversy.

2111
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,300
And they're okay.

2112
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:44,320
Like...

2113
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:45,120
Haha...

2114
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:45,640
They...

2115
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:46,900
There's...

2116
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:47,740
It doesn't matter.

2117
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:49,300
It's just still okay.

2118
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:50,380
Like...

2119
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:51,740
Hahaha...

2120
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,180
What happened to that?

2121
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:54,820
There's so many.

2122
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,180
I remember like...

2123
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:56,640
Because like...

2124
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:57,360
Gumi...

2125
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:57,880
Like...

2126
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:58,900
Knows about it.

2127
01:29:58,980 --> 01:29:59,480
Because like...

2128
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:00,360
She's like...

2129
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,240
Friends...

2130
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:02,960
Um...

2131
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:03,620
With like...

2132
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:04,420
Within like...

2133
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,260
The Minecraft community.

2134
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:06,940
And then I got really confused.

2135
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:08,460
Because like...

2136
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,420
She was like...

2137
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:09,940
Oh my god.

2138
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,980
Did you hear about what happened to this person?

2139
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:12,480
And I was like...

2140
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:12,840
Who?

2141
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,280
And then she like...

2142
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,120
Explained it to me.

2143
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:15,560
And I was like...

2144
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,100
Who the fuck...

2145
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:17,500
That looked it up.

2146
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,080
And I was like...

2147
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,860
One million followers.

2148
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:20,900
I was like...

2149
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:21,140
Oh...

2150
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:22,020
This guy is important.

2151
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,200
And then...

2152
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:23,940
And then they're like...

2153
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:24,180
Yeah...

2154
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,860
There's a whole shit going on right now.

2155
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:26,620
Hahaha...

2156
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:27,960
Hahaha...

2157
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,900
And then like...

2158
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:31,920
I look back...

2159
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:32,280
I think like...

2160
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,720
Recently I checked up on it.

2161
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:34,820
And then like...

2162
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:36,020
They're still okay.

2163
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:36,860
Like...

2164
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:37,400
People forgot.

2165
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:38,720
Or not forgot.

2166
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:39,740
But like...

2167
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:41,340
Minecraft.

2168
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:43,600
Hahaha...

2169
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:44,840
Hahaha...

2170
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,180
Hahaha...

2171
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:45,440
Hahaha...

2172
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,000
Hahaha...

2173
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,300
Hahaha...

2174
01:30:59,300 --> 01:30:59,520
Hahaha...

2175
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:03,760
Hahaha...

2176
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:05,780
Hahaha...

2177
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:05,920
I'm sorry...

2178
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,340
As soon as I hear something new about Dream...

2179
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:09,280
That I don't wanna hear about.

2180
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,380
But he's still making millions of dollars.

2181
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:16,870
A lot.

2182
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:18,810
Like you can't even like list any...

2183
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:20,310
That's what I'm saying.

2184
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:23,310
The internet will like...

2185
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:25,010
Okay maybe like...

2186
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:26,670
Minecraft portion.

2187
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:28,590
Like they'll just...

2188
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:29,490
Oh my god.

2189
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:30,690
There was one else...

2190
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:30,870
So.

2191
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:31,630
Okay I swear.

2192
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:32,310
Minecraft dram...

2193
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:33,330
I can't even talk about this drama.

2194
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,590
There's like so many fucking crazy ones.

2195
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:36,350
Like...

2196
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:37,590
I like just read up.

2197
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:40,610
That just like, uh, showed up.

2198
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:43,930
There's like some fucking crazy ones.

2199
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:45,870
They're actually insane.

2200
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:47,410
I was like how the... how?

2201
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,790
How the fuck?

2202
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:51,890
How is that...

2203
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:53,170
How did that...

2204
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:54,590
How is that possible?

2205
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:02,390
And then they still have...

2206
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:03,970
I don't understand.

2207
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:06,870
That's what I'm saying!

2208
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:10,790
They'll still have a fanbase because children are like...

2209
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:11,930
But he funny.

2210
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,110

Thank you.

2213
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:24,350
Hey Doki, I can't watch much right now but I'm dropping by a super because it's my birthday!

Thank you.

2217
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:30,370
Thank you for the super chat.

2218
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:30,690
Thank you.

2219
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:31,370
Thank you.

2220
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:32,950
Happy birthday!

2221
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:34,730
Happy birthday to you.

2222
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:36,230
Happy birthday to you.

2223
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:37,810
Happy birthday dear Lea.

2224
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:39,270
Happy birthday to you.

2225
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:39,650
Yeah!

2226
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:44,530
But he funny and pretty.

2227
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:46,310
True.

2228
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:49,370
So true.

2229
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:56,630
That man's gonna be my future husband.

2230
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:58,630
He cannot do...

2231
01:32:58,630 --> 01:32:59,610
He can do no wrong.

2232
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,250
It's like...

2233
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,810
It's like the ones...

2234
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:07,190
It reminds me of like...

2235
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:07,950
What was it?

2236
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:08,590
When like...

2237
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:11,350
Like handsome murderers are on trial.

2238
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:13,230
And then the women are...

2239
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:16,710
And then there's like women and I guess like gay men are like...

2240
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:18,190
Oh my god but he's so hot though.

2241
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:22,310
I can fix him.

2242
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:27,610
Apparently I don't know if you guys noticed.

2243
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:28,950
But like...

2244
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:31,690
There was like...

2245
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:32,490
What was his name?

2246
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:34,450
Umm...

2247
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:35,710
Oh my god.

2248
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,230
It's not controversial cause he's like...

2249
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:39,310
I guess dead.

2250
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:40,730
Wait is he?

2251
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:43,710
Who was the one that had a cult?

2252
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:46,350
That had like a fucking murder cult?

2253
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:49,630
Was it Ted Bundy?

2254
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,310
Okay do you know like Ted...

2255
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,930
Was it Ted...

2256
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:55,230
Yeah Ted or was it Manson?

2257
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:56,570
Which one had...

2258
01:33:56,570 --> 01:33:58,350
Okay there were so many murder cults.

2259
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:00,090
Like there were so many.

2260
01:34:00,190 --> 01:34:00,990
Was he?

2261
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:03,510
Charles Manson.

2262
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:06,070
Did you know he had like several prison wives?

2263
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:08,870
Like he was in prison for murder.

2264
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:10,330
You know for the murder cult.

2265
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:11,530
But then like...

2266
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:14,050
Several like women outside of prison...

2267
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,450
Would send him like mail.

2268
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:18,650
And then like he got married to several women.

2269
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:20,250
While he was in prison.

2270
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:22,530
Cause the women outside of prison...

2271
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:23,110
Were like...

2272
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:25,150
Although he murdered a lot of people.

2273
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:26,650
But like...

2274
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:28,650
He was a lot though.

2275
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:34,290
Like...

2276
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:38,630
Yeah you guys didn't know that?

2277
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:40,650
He literally had like wives.

2278
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:43,270
He had wives while in prison.

2279
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:46,350
Because so many like women sent him like mail.

2280
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:48,070
Like literally wrote mail to him.

2281
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,870
As like a pen pal stuff.

2282
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:52,990
Like it's not like they were in prison with him.

2283
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:55,090
It was like they were outside of prison.

2284
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:55,670
You know.

2285
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:56,770
Regular people.

2286
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:00,170
Because they were fucking like married to fucking...

2287
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:01,910
Charles Manson.

2288
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:02,410
Like...

2289
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,010
Like...

2290
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:07,750
Like...

2291
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,870
I guess you're not normal anymore.

2292
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:12,610
After you're trying to fucking marry Charles Manson.

2293
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:15,090
The little leader of a murder cult.

2294
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:15,810
Like...

2295
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:24,130
Oh yeah I guess like Ted Bunny too.

2296
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:24,690
Yeah sorry.

2297
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:27,410
Ted Bunny and Charles Manson.

2298
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:28,450
Um...

2299
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:31,270
But like they literally had like wives while in...

2300
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:33,070
Like not even like singular wife.

2301
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:34,170
Wife?

2302
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:36,010
Not even a singular wife.

2303
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:37,230
It's wives.

2304
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:38,710
And then like...

2305
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:42,550
And like it was very public.

2306
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:44,390
With all the stuff they actually did.

2307
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:46,110
Like it's not like misunderstood.

2308
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,990
Where they're like we don't know if he actually did.

2309
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:49,570
We all knew.

2310
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:51,970
We all fucking knew what they did.

2311
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:52,870
Like...

2312
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:58,870
It's not like they're like...

2313
01:35:58,870 --> 01:35:59,930
But did he...

2314
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,970
No he did do it.

2315
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:04,250
We all knew he did do it.

2316
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:07,410
There is an unbelievable amount of evidence.

2317
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:09,590
That they did what they did.

2318
01:36:09,850 --> 01:36:12,070
And even after everybody knew.

2319
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:14,010
What they fucking did.

2320
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:15,150
Uh...

2321
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:20,850
They still had multiple prison wives.

2322
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:21,850
And they were like...

2323
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:21,950
I don't know.

2324
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:27,670
Oh yeah.

2325
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:28,590
Even Dahlmer.

2326
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:29,490
Oh yeah I remember that.

2327
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:30,550
And his fangirls.

2328
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:31,930
They don't like...

2329
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:35,610
I can fix him.

2330
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:49,770
People make mistakes.

2331
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:51,670
People change.

2332
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,290
I remember seeing...

2333
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:58,150
I don't remember who it was.

2334
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,170
It might have been Ted Bundy.

2335
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:03,610
Like serial killers.

2336
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:04,830
And like...

2337
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:06,570
He was like...

2338
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:09,530
Diagnosed as a sociopath.

2339
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:12,050
Like literally committing several murders.

2340
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:13,390
And then...

2341
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:15,770
An interviewer was doing an interview on him.

2342
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:17,490
And people were like...

2343
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:19,170
Oh man he just seems misunderstood.

2344
01:37:20,730 --> 01:37:22,590
Cause you know...

2345
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:23,470
If you're a sociopath.

2346
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:24,250
You can...

2347
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:27,710
Pretend you have empathy.

2348
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:28,870
And stuff.

2349
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,730
And uh...

2350
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:33,670
They're like...

2351
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:34,390
Oh yeah...

2352
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:37,630
I didn't really mean to do that.

2353
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:38,010
You know?

2354
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,350
I was reading the YouTube comments.

2355
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:42,550
And people were like...

2356
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:45,390
And then some guy...

2357
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:46,210
Others were like...

2358
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:49,330
Oh it's psychopath.

2359
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:49,850
Sorry.

2360
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:53,830
No sociopaths are also similar.

2361
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:54,470
Isn't it?

2362
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:55,670
I forgot.

2363
01:37:59,290 --> 01:37:59,810
Um...

2364
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:01,350
No.

2365
01:38:02,650 --> 01:38:03,330
Yeah no.

2366
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:04,090
Okay psycho.

2367
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:05,710
I feel like psycho...

2368
01:38:05,710 --> 01:38:07,630
They're not the same thing.

2369
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:10,810
I'm trying to remember the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath.

2370
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:13,850
Um...

2371
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:15,910
Oh sorry.

2372
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:16,570
Psychopath.

2373
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:16,990
Yeah.

2374
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:18,090
No.

2375
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:20,970
A psychopath is the one where you actually have no empathy.

2376
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:25,010
Sociopaths are where you can have empathy.

2377
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:26,990
But it's like not really...

2378
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:27,590
Not that much.

2379
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:29,570
It's psychopaths that are like...

2380
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,570
Actual no empathy at all.

2381
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:37,140

Thank you.

2384
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:42,060
That interview would not have survived if I had met that guy before they were arrested.

2385
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:43,440
I'm trying to remember who it was.

2386
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,280
It was like really interesting too.

2387
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,120
Was it Ted Bundy interview?

2388
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,760
Because it was a very...

2389
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,640
Interesting interview.

2390
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,820
I was like watching it.

2391
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:54,760
Was it this?

2392
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:03,630
Let's see.

2393
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:14,880
I don't remember.

2394
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,640
I wish I remember who it was.

2395
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,180
Because the interview was so interesting.

2396
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,520
Because the interview was so interesting.

2397
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:26,620
Because the interview was so interesting.

2398
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:28,240
Listen, Allison Maddow!

2399
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,620
Oh my god!

2400
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,980
I can't thank Sir Dublin.

2401
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:33,480
I can't thank Sir Dublin.

2402
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,200
Thank you for the super chat.

2403
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,140
Thank you.

2404
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:42,410
Guys, I don't know guys.

2405
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:45,590
Guys, I don't know.

2406
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:47,710
Guys, I don't know.

2407
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:52,910
Guys, it might not be...

2408
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:55,450
Guys, it might not be...

2409
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:55,470
Guys, it might not be...

2410
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:56,830
Might not be the smartest thing to do.

2411
01:39:57,210 --> 01:39:57,330
Might not be the smartest thing to do.

2412
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,500
Alright, back to work guys.

2413
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:24,320
Back to work.

2414
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,980
Enough about the murder talk.

2415
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,480
It's back to work time.

2416
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:32,060
Ba-dum.

2417
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Ba-dum.

2418
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:35,920
Ba-dum.

2419
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:36,480
Ba-dum, ba-dum.

2420
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,780

2421
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:57,230
I have more messages!

2422
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:17,840
That's crazy!

2423
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:32,650
Oh my gosh!

2424
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:33,630
Like...

2425
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:37,110
I bought like...

2426
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:38,030
Okay, so like...

2427
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:39,110
You know how like I have...

2428
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:40,970
I'm autographing stuff for merch?

2429
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:42,930
So like...

2430
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:45,790
I bought like four different marker...

2431
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:47,610
Like autograph brands.

2432
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:49,590
Like autograph marker brands.

2433
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:52,230
Because I never had to like actually like...

2434
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:53,390
Autograph...

2435
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:55,930
Because like you know all the other autographs in the past I've done was digitally.

2436
01:44:56,190 --> 01:44:58,570
Where I just like do it digitally and then they just print it out.

2437
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:01,550
So I've never had to like actually hand sign anything.

2438
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:03,550
With like an actual autograph marker.

2439
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:05,050
So like I was like...

2440
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:07,950
Um...

2441
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:09,230
Um...

2442
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:09,730
Like...

2443
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:12,350
I just remember this because I was like replying back to messages.

2444
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:13,610
And...

2445
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,190
Uh...

2446
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:16,950
So I was like testing out the markers because I don't know which is a good...

2447
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:19,070
I was like researching so hard.

2448
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:21,010
Like I actually even read like...

2449
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:23,690
I even watched like videos where they do it like...

2450
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:24,990
They were like doing like...

2451
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:28,370
Like autograph marker reviews and stuff.

2452
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:31,070
I was just like...

2453
01:45:31,070 --> 01:45:32,990
I was just like...

2454
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:34,630
I was like oh my god.

2455
01:45:35,070 --> 01:45:37,630
Like what is a good marker?

2456
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:41,450
Yes dude!

2457
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:41,930
Yes!

2458
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:43,910
I had to like research because there's like...

2459
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:45,850
I didn't want to get like a normal sharpie.

2460
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:49,790
Like because like you know people obviously like you can just get regular sharpie.

2461
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:51,490
But there's actual autograph markers.

2462
01:45:51,790 --> 01:45:54,110
But I needed one that was like a good brand.

2463
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:55,990
And um...

2464
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:58,730
And like I want the colors to pop and stuff.

2465
01:45:58,970 --> 01:45:59,950
So like um...

2466
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:01,230
I bought like...

2467
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,450
I think like four different fucking autograph brands.

2468
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,210
I even had to like...

2469
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:08,230
I even had to like...

2470
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:09,670
Um...

2471
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:12,370
Ask my friend Saatchi too.

2472
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:14,970
Like I think like last week I was like what...

2473
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:18,890
What marker is like good autograph brands?

2474
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:20,250
I was like...

2475
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,130
I was like...

2476
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:22,090
I was like...

2477
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:24,370
Which one do I get?

2478
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:31,410
I was so fucking...

2479
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:32,510
Bruh...

2480
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:34,550
Bruh I was so fucking...

2481
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:35,430
I bought so many.

2482
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:37,190
I bought so many brands.

2483
01:46:40,290 --> 01:46:40,730

2484
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:42,070

I really appreciate it.

2490
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:48,490
Thank you for the magenta soup.

2491
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:00,580
She suggested I try the...

2492
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:01,540
Um...

2493
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:02,300
What's it called?

2494
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:03,760
The Sakura PenTouch.

2495
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:05,700
I'm waiting for that right now.

2496
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:08,900
I'm waiting for that to arrive.

2497
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,120
I wish there was a pin.

2498
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:08,060
I wish there was a pin feature on discord.

2499
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,840
Because there's like some that I'm like, oh, um...

2500
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:16,600
I want to reply back to it, but at a later time.

2501
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:36,900
Wait, there are?

2502
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:39,580
No, like, but like pin like people.

2503
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:41,140
That's what I mean.

2504
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,560
I'm not meant like messages, but like I meant...

2505
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,420
Like I want to pin like...

2506
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:51,320
Not messages, like pin the person.

2507
01:48:58,860 --> 01:48:59,840
That's what I want.

2508
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:04,280
Yeah, I want to keep them because like Twitter recently added that too.

2509
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,180
Which is very helpful.

2510
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:09,780
Twitter added like a feature where you can pin like Twitter DMs.

2511
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,940
But like you can't do that on...

2512
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:20,300
You can't do that on this one on Discord.

2513
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:42,800
Okay.

2514
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,600
Oh my God, I did it.

2515
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:24,900
I finished answering individual Discord DMs.

2516
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,960
Alright, how many percentage did I finish with that?

2517
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:28,420
Done.

2518
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:30,040
Answered DMs.

2519
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,320
And there you have it.

2520
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:36,300
20%.

2521
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:44,480
The moment I do one more task, I win.

2522
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,000
We're still winning?

2523
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:52,180
Well...

2524
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:53,440
For now.

2525
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:57,300
The second task can get done like in the next 20 minutes.

2526
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,320
So you're fucked guys.

2527
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,860

Now that the unread DMs are answered, how many DMs have been left unread this month?

2538
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:26,310
I'll never tell.

01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:33,370
Let's see.

2543
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:36,830
Okay.

2544
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,320

You guys will see it one day.

2551
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:26,830
But I got shown something really fucking funny.

2552

01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:34,410
One day.

2554
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:39,750
By the time I show this, you'll know why I thought it was so funny.

2555
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:46,620
Oh my god.

2556

Alright.

2565
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:01,020
There's like no...

2566
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:03,540
You have zero context as to what this is for.

2567
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,460
But it's just so funny.

2568
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:06,580
I have to show it.

2569
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:12,740
It's just so funny.

2570
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:13,600
I love it.

2571
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:19,020
I... There's zero context.

2572
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,020
I just...

2573
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:22,660
I just love this guy's expression.

2574
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,800
You have zero context.

2575
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:30,200
You just get to see this.

2576
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:41,810
Why is he like that?!

2577
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:45,570
There's no context for you.

2578
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:46,030
Okay.

2579
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:48,170
You have zero context.

2580
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:49,090
You just get to see this.

2581
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:03,160
I'll just put him here.

2582
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,400
He's just gonna be standing here.

2583
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:17,560
Fuck, okay.

2584
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:20,020
Oh my god, I wish I could show you guys this now.

2585
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:23,380
Sorry.

2586
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:25,340
I wish I could show you guys this.

2587
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:26,880
This is so fucking dumb.

2588
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:30,320
Don't worry.

2589
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:31,840
Soon, TM.

2590
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:33,040
Soon.

2591
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,300
I just saw something so funny.

2592
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:42,180
Soon, TM.

2593
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:43,360
Soon.

2594
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:07,430
How the fuck did some of these things go onto your to-do list?

2595
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:09,710
One just says, America, yeah.

2596
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:11,950
Like, what?

2597
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:16,750
The other one is like, what the fuck does potato mean?

2598
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:20,850
What is the potato for?

2599
02:03:34,730 --> 02:03:35,450
Hello.

2600
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:36,150
Hello.

2601
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:02,740
Well, you got it.

2602
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:03,760
Someone check that off.

2603
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:09,060
Technically, it's done now.

2604
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:12,920
That's another task done.

2605
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:11,550
Have you not walked your dog yet?

2606
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:15,450
When did you put that on the to-do list?

2607
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:20,490
Dogs need to pee!

2608
02:06:23,290 --> 02:06:23,770
Bro!

2609
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:28,590
Did you just add it?

2610
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:30,690
When did you add this?

2611
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:33,630
Oh, you just added.

2612
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:33,910
Okay.

2613
02:06:34,430 --> 02:06:34,950
It's okay.

2614
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:35,230
Sorry.

2615
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:36,050
I'll stop judging.

2616
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:37,330
You literally just added it.

2617
02:06:37,490 --> 02:06:38,090
Thank God.

2618
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:39,670
I was going to be like, oh my God, bro.

2619
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:40,070
Your dog.

2620
02:06:40,490 --> 02:06:41,370
Walk your dog!

2621
02:06:45,690 --> 02:06:46,070
You know,

2622
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:53,960
I could make the list like longer to show up.

2623
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:55,500
No, I think it's...

2624
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:56,020
Actually, no.

2625
02:06:56,060 --> 02:06:56,880
It's the perfect height.

2626
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:02,780
At least somebody.

2627
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:03,880
Those people are Ashley.

2628
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:04,920
Where the fuck?

2629
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:05,300
Okay.

2630
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:08,080
Flying potato wrote fucking become immortal.

2631
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:09,960
These are the people that are sabotaging you.

2632
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:17,160
These are the drag rooms that are fucking over the others.

2633
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,230
Okay.

2634
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:28,010
All right.

2635
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:32,690
I think I'm done on this channel.

2636
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,560
All right.

2637
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:52,320
I finished another task.

2638
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:04,880
All right.

2639
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:05,200
Nice.

2640
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:06,460
I'm ahead now.

2641
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:08,120
All right, guys.

2642
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,940
I gave you a head start too.

2643
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:12,200
Like what the fuck, guys?

2644
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:17,460
We're never finishing our task.

2645
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:19,980
Mike, thank you for the gift.

2646
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:20,660
Thank you.

2647
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:21,120
Thank you.

2648
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:21,260
Thank you.

2649
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:22,320
Double Mike's.

2650
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:23,740
Mike BC and Mike Tyson.

2651
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:26,000
Thank you for the gifted membership.

2652
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:26,480
Thank you.

2653
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:27,000
Thank you.

2654
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:32,500
You saw that we're being sabotaged.

2655
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:34,020
It's your.

2656
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:35,500
Okay.

2657
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,020
You have nothing.

2658
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:37,020
I want to blame by yourself.

2659
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:38,500
Not going to lie.

2660
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:43,760
Like, what the fuck did I do?

2661
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:51,420
I'm just doing my task.

2662
02:09:57,110 --> 02:09:58,410
Who wrote that?

2663
02:09:59,150 --> 02:10:00,010
It's your word.

2664
02:10:05,150 --> 02:10:06,030
Do literally.

2665
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:34,540
I think like the mods gave up.

2666
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:35,520
Sorry.

2667
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:39,740
The singular mind gave up.

2668
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:45,740
I mean, to be fair, I would give up too.

2669
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:53,520
To be fair, anyone would.

2670
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,240
There's like so much.

2671
02:10:56,240 --> 02:10:56,400
So many.

2672
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:00,320
I started doing my own work.

2673
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:08,600
They're still here.

2674
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:12,630
They're just not moderating the to-do list anymore.

2675
02:11:13,290 --> 02:11:14,470
Like I'm surprised.

2676
02:11:14,510 --> 02:11:15,470
They lasted this long.

2677
02:11:19,070 --> 02:11:20,990
Honestly honestly, I'm just surprised.

2678
02:11:21,130 --> 02:11:24,470
They were able to last this long try to moderate this mess.

2679
02:11:25,150 --> 02:11:26,330
Of a to-do list.

2680
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:34,750
This to-do list is so fucked.

2681
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:43,850
We behaving?

2682
02:11:44,110 --> 02:11:45,290
What do you mean?

2683
02:11:45,610 --> 02:11:47,670
Literally, I'm... I can't...

2684
02:11:49,930 --> 02:11:58,210
Literally, I'm looking back and it's like, Get eaten out by... from Black Letter.

2685
02:11:58,390 --> 02:12:01,630
And get eaten out by Mike Tyson.

2686
02:12:01,630 --> 02:12:04,350
Yeah, you guys are definitely behaving.

2687
02:12:08,570 --> 02:12:11,390
Yeah, from Mr. Black Letter himself.

2688
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:19,810
It was me like scrolling up like five minutes ago.

2689
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:25,150
Someone had manual breathing.

2690
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,810
Wait, hold on.

2691
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:37,910
Don't judge Sarah Fischer.

2692
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:48,540
There he is!

2693
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:49,060
There!

2694
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:49,920
There he is!

2695
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:52,240
Now he's on the stream!

2696
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:53,560
There he is!

2697
02:13:32,910 --> 02:13:35,030
Another task completed, guys.

2698
02:13:50,330 --> 02:13:51,230
I think I won.

2699
02:13:51,550 --> 02:13:53,070
I don't think you're gonna catch up now.

2700
02:13:57,110 --> 02:13:57,870
It's over.

2701
02:13:59,350 --> 02:14:00,770
Maddie, thank you for the super chat.

2702
02:14:00,830 --> 02:14:01,670
Thank you, thank you.

2703
02:14:01,790 --> 02:14:04,770
Mike Tyson himself infiltrated the stream.

2704
02:14:04,990 --> 02:14:06,110
Thank you for the super chat.

2705
02:14:06,190 --> 02:14:07,090
Thank you, thank you.

2706
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:11,230
Chat, stop adding more!

2707
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:17,490
I don't know, guys.

2708
02:14:17,670 --> 02:14:19,290
I think Doki's gonna beat us.

2709
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:20,430
We don't know yet.

2710
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:22,690
I may be wrong.

2711
02:14:22,690 --> 02:14:22,930
I'm not wrong.

2712
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:25,410
Alright, guys.

2713
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:26,450
We're gonna call it here.

2714
02:14:26,910 --> 02:14:28,110
Alright, race is over.

2715
02:14:28,390 --> 02:14:30,230
Because like, you know...

2716
02:14:30,650 --> 02:14:33,810
I don't think it was much of a competition in the end.

2717
02:14:34,590 --> 02:14:35,150
But yeah!

2718
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:36,650
I had a great time.

2719
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:37,830
Just like...

2720
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:40,070
Of course not the rest of the two ways are over.

2721
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:42,270
I mean like setting up stuff.

2722
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:45,370
But anyway, I'm gonna call it here.

2723
02:14:45,610 --> 02:14:47,230
So I can grab something to eat.

2724
02:14:48,170 --> 02:14:49,690
But I had a great time.

2725
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:50,930
Just hanging out with you guys.

2726
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:51,830
Getting some work done.

2727
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:53,930
It was pretty comfy.

2728
02:14:54,290 --> 02:14:55,410
Comfy time to chill.

2729
02:14:55,610 --> 02:14:57,170
I really like this widget though.

2730
02:14:57,430 --> 02:14:58,530
I think it's very...

2731
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:02,850
Honestly, I feel like it...

2732
02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:05,150
I hope it was productive from you guys.

2733
02:15:05,350 --> 02:15:06,670
For you guys as well.

2734
02:15:07,070 --> 02:15:09,190
And like I hope you guys just enjoyed your time.

2735
02:15:09,370 --> 02:15:11,470
Just like hanging out and relaxing everybody.

2736
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:13,810
And...

2737
02:15:15,410 --> 02:15:18,890
And I hope the widget has been quite helpful in general.

2738
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:21,530
I really like seeing like you guys, you know...

2739
02:15:21,530 --> 02:15:24,010
Working alongside with me with the task and everything.

2740
02:15:24,190 --> 02:15:24,990
Don't worry guys.

2741
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:27,350
I'll throw you guys a bone.

2742
02:15:29,390 --> 02:15:31,150
What is the command again?

2743
02:15:31,730 --> 02:15:32,510
Let's see.

2744
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:33,230
Oh, here we go.

2745
02:15:33,310 --> 02:15:34,110
Guys, watch this.

2746
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:38,350
Wait, actually I'm...

2747
02:15:38,350 --> 02:15:39,970
I'm worried I'm gonna do the wrong...

2748
02:15:39,970 --> 02:15:41,990
I put the wrong command.

2749
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:45,030
Okay, give me a sec guys.

2750
02:15:45,590 --> 02:15:49,570
Give me a sec before I fucking accidentally lock everything.

2751
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:57,770
Okay, guys watch this.

2752
02:16:01,290 --> 02:16:01,890
Oh.

2753
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:05,810
Don't drive, that was the wrong...

2754
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:13,420
No!!

2755
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:17,440
Wait...

2756
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:19,900
Oh, okay.

2757
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:21,500
I figured it out.

2758
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:31,300
Did I do it?

2759
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:33,060
WHAT?!

2760
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:35,060
YAY!

2761
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,400
OH SHIT!

2762
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:37,280
Nice.

2763
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:39,840
Now none of us, nobody wins.

2764
02:16:40,380 --> 02:16:42,360
Now nobody wins!

2765
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:52,160
No, I'll just do this.

2766
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,920
And finish to-do list.

2767
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:57,240
Done.

2768
02:16:57,640 --> 02:16:59,460
Finish to-do list.

2769
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:02,200
Now nobody- Now I win.

2770
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:12,200
YAY!

2771
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:21,920
Look at that, you're still- fucking- you're still adding more stuff to to-do list!

2772
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:24,140
What do you mean, Raid?

2773
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:28,280
Yay!

2774
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:30,100
100%!

2775
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:33,260
Stop the count!

2776
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:36,400
You guys are still fucking adding more stuff.

2777
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:37,380
What do you mean?

2778
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:40,280
You guys stop moving the goalposts.

2779
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:42,680
We got things to do.

2780
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:45,040
You're still adding more stuff!

2781
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:46,480
What do you mean?

2782
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,220
Thank you to the super chat.

2783
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:50,120
Thank you, thank you.

2784
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:52,480
Here's how dragoons can still win.

2785
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:53,160
Stop.

2786
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:55,060
Stop adding stuff!

2787
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,480
Exclamation point.

2788
02:17:56,980 --> 02:17:57,700
Add.

2789
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:04,920
I can't believe I'm the only one that finished the to-do list, guys.

2790
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,580
We can't end the stream till this starts.

2791
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:12,020
Well, unfortunate everybody.

2792
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:14,560
Anyway guys, I had a great time.

2793
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:21,820
I had a great time just- You can't even complete a task until 10 minutes later and they're still slow-pwned!

2794
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:24,940
It was all rigged against you.

2795
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:35,000
No matter what, Dokio, the house always wins.

2796
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:36,340
No matter what, Dokio, the house always wins.

2797
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:37,440
Cass, thank you for the super chat.

2798
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:38,220
Thank you, thank you.

2799
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:39,940
Nah, nah, we won round one.

2800
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:42,140
But it was nice just relaxing.

2801
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:43,980
Sorry it's not a super long stream.

2802
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:47,080
I think it's because I did a really long stream for Sajab Slam.

2803
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:49,620
So obviously today is just more so chill.

2804
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:52,060
And tomorrow there's double streams too.

2805
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:54,840
So this is more so of an appetite.

2806
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:54,920
So this is more so of an appetite.

2807
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:57,400
Just a chill session with everybody.

2808
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:59,040
A hangout session.

2809
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,740
Like some solo hangout session with you guys.

2810
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:03,920
Black, thank you for the super chat.

2811
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:04,500
Thank you, thank you.

2812
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:05,220
What did you do?

2813
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:07,680
I haven't finished one piece yet.

2814
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:09,680
Thank you for the super chat.

2815
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:10,820
Thank you, thank you.

2816
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,140
But yes, everybody.

2817
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:16,420
I'm gonna head out now.

2818
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:19,040
Gonna eat dinner and then get more work done.

2819
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:21,320
But as always, everybody stay hydrated.

2820
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:22,340
Pause to check.

2821
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:24,160
Yeah, but move around to get that blood flowing.

2822
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:26,400
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2823
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:27,560
Cause you deserve it.

2824
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:28,560
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2825
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:29,820
Bye guys.

2826
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:30,960
Bye.
