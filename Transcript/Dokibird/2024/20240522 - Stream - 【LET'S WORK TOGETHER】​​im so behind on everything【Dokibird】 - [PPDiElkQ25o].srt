Guys, give me a sec.

00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,190
Let me figure this out.

18
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,630
I thought that was how you do it.

19
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,870
Okay, task command, permission.

20
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,190
It says viewers.

21
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,150
Why is it not viewing?

22
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,430
I was able to put stuff on.

23
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,870
I don't know about you guys.

24
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,770
Okay, did I like mess it up?

27
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,150

28
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,370
Am I even, am I not on anonymous mode?

29
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,470
Am I on anonymous mode right now?

30
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,270
Give me a sec, guys.

31
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,330
Guys, I'm sorry.

32
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,410
I forgot I'm on anonymous mode on Twitch, so when I'm on
anonymous mode on Twitch, I can't do anything.

33
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,330
Okay.

34
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,150
Oh no, give me a sec.

35
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,310
I can't even load Twitch at the moment.

36
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,330
Oh, It's all over.

37
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,370
It's over already.

38
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,970
I was, it was so cool, too.

39
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,250
I was like, oh my God, this is so cool.

40
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,710
I can, like, add stuff.

41
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,130
Oh, wait, is this why?

42
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,910
Wait, I think I know why it doesn't work.

43
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,970
Give me a sec.

44
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,130
Oh!

45
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,450
It was the wrong command.

46
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,050
Okay, I fixed it.

47
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,670
All right, now it should work.

48
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,570
I figured it out.

49
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,410
I gave you guys the wrong command.

50
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,750
There we go.

51
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,330
What do you mean?

52
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,450
It's Jovert.

53
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,350
Set up new.

54
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,810
I can delete I can literally delete commands

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:08,980
Guys, please this is supposed we're supposed to be working
together Chat we are supposed to be working together chat.

56
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,460
Stop I will delete your commands.

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,400
Wait, no mods can delete commands.

58
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,540
I'm so sorry.

59
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,720
I know like, okay, I've started paying the mods though you
can't be like they're doing it for free because i can

60
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:33,440
finally afford to pay the mods so like boss why okay all
right all right mod you're getting paid now

61
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:45,140
so my all you have to do is it's the command to delete other
people's uh the command to delete

62
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:57,560
that are not relevant is delete so it's exclamation point
wait let me read the i'll let me read the guidelines okay

63
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:06,040
it's exclamation point delete and then you i swear to god
and then like delete the username all you have to do is just

64
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,920
like exclamation point delete and then you delete whoever's
username has like the shitty task that is not relevant you

65
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,840
just do delete the username's

66
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,920
So, not enough for, what do you mean?

67
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,200
Look at all my tasks.

68
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,620
Look at all the fucking chats to-do list.

69
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,380
There's, this is not, this is your to-do list, guys.

70
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,700
It's not my to-do list.

71
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,840
If you're gonna, I'm gonna put slow-mo on Twitch.

72
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,380
This is, uh-oh.

73
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,860
Did you, thank you, Super Chat.

74
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,260
Thank you.

75
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,940
Thank you.

76
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,340
No, thank you.

77
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
This is your to-do list.

78
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,600
I have my list on my left side.

79
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,340
My list is on the left side.

80
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,240
Your list is on the right side.

81
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,740
And also, also, if you guys are like, if we can also ban
people.

82
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,800
If we ban people on Twitch, then like all the tasks get
removed instantly.

83
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,080
So like, there's also that option.

84
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,260
So if it's...

85
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:39,940
easier 30 minutes slow mo okay guys maybe not 30 okay okay
this is there's a lot of tasks coming 109 chat anyway um

86
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:49,760
anyway uh i was really excited to try this new widget out uh
i is from Who is it say say a nani?

87
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:57,720
Because I've been like following her stuff like this like
the stuff she develops On like widget for which streamer

88
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,520
widget, but it only works on Twitch.

89
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,480
I mean, I could invite I wonder if I could invite stream
elements I was thinking about inviting stream elements into

90
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,060
YouTube Because it's like a stream elements widget But then
I was like I didn't want to clutter up my own chat like on

91
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:19,940
the YouTube chat So like I figured it's like I was like also
partially inspired by Ame, like remember her, her music bot,

92
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:28,480
where like she's when she used to do like those like streams
where you can listen to music by suggesting music on Twitch

93
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,100
and stuff like that.

94
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:37,600
So it like inspired me to do something similar to separate,
separate like, you know, the task list on Twitch so it

95
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,540
doesn't clutter up the yeah, Bumabot.

96
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,520
Yeah, so it doesn't clutter up the YouTube chat.

97
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,720
So that's why I decided to because like I think you can
invite stream elements to YouTube chat It'll do the same

98
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,700
thing, but I figured like, okay, I don't want my chat to
just be filled with fucking stupid things that are not

99
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,080
relevant to the task, because I know you guys were going to
troll with that.

100
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:08,480
I knew you guys were going to troll with a fucking command
list, so I figured I'm going to separate this to the Twitch

101
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:16,560
chat, so you can suggest stuff over there, and then my
YouTube chat, at least people can still be chatting on the

102
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,100
YouTube chat.

103
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,340
But I think it's so cool though.

104
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,200
Isn't it cool?

105
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,120
So like I can do like I can complete my tasks too.

106
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,640
Like I thought it was so cool.

107
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,300
That like you know like we can like work in real time.

108
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,100
Like my stuff on the left side.

109
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,640
Your stuff on the right side.

110
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,160
Two out of 154.

111
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,520
You guys are like 1% complete.

112
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,740
Let's race guys.

113
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,940
Let's see who can get their stuff done first.

114
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,100
Let's see who has like a higher percentage of complete.

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:55,360
their tasks guys oh my god i wonder who will win whoa

116
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,480
we were set up you guys did this to yourself hey guys thank
you the super chat thank you thank you you know us so well

117
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:15,200
love you too what's the difference between done and complete
is the same thing so you can use done or complete um it's

118
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,060
people who like you know want to type one want a shorter
word you just do exclamation point done and I hope you

119
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:37,020
remember what you wrote like I hope I hope you remember what
you fucking wrote guys I'm wondering if there's like another

120
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:45,800
thing you can type let me double check let's see settings uh
commands to do complete yeah complete and done on the same

121
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,920
thing I hope you guys remember because I don't know.

122
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,540
I think if you do.

123
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,280
Oh, you do delete.

124
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,360
Maybe if you do delete and then your username.

125
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,780
I think it's like delete.

126
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,480
And then your username on Twitch.

127
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:11,220
It deletes all the tasks for your entire, like all the tasks
that you put on there.

128
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,240
I think.

129
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,080
Guys, I'm learning this as I go.

130
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

131
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
Oh, no, this is mod only.

132
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,860
Never mind.

133
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,240
Only mods can do that.

134
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,800
So, like, I hope you remember.

135
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,400
Never mind.

136
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,220
It says mod only commands.

137
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,500
JK, you guys better remember what you wrote.

138
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:36,980
Okay.

139
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,600
Mod, you're only deleting the ones that are useless.

140
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,120
That are obviously trolls.

141
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,380
Okay.

142
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:55,760
so yeah i mean if you don't remember then you're failing the
rest of the dragoons because you're like uh because

because I want to do a little Zatzadon.

150
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,260
Uh, last week was a full-on Tekken week plus Sunday.

151
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,280
And, um, we didn't really have a time to actually, like,
hang out and chat.

152
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,860
Like, it was just Tekken, Tekken, Tekken, Tekken.

153
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,080
And, uh, honestly, I'm like...

154
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,900
Super, oh my gosh.

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
I was like, what is that sound?

156
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,760
What's that?

157
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,480
Ah, sound.

158
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,440
I don't think you guys hear.

159
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,440
I don't think you guys hear it, but it was like, oh, it's
the task complete sound.

160
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:02,520
So every time you guys complete a task, there's like a
little pencil sound effect and like, it like catches me off

161
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:02,800
guard.

162
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,580
I was like, is that my music?

163
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,940
Like, uh, but yes, the Tekken arc.

164
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,840
Uh, and it was like, oh my gosh.

165
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:23,020
I'm like, I'm like, so tired from the time i was like i
think like right after the tournament i was like oh my gosh

166
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:31,960
i was so tired and like mentally exhausted because my social
battery was like gone basically because it was like uh with

167
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:40,980
paying out with like uh five five people and then like for
six plus hours almost every day so my social battery as an

168
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:54,580
introvert my social battery is like depleted now i think I
think I slept yesterday I basically slept like I think like

169
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:05,960
Oh my gosh I slept the whole day I woke up I woke up and
then And then like And then I think I was only away for like

170
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,380
Two to three hours and then I went back to sleep I was so
tired I was like oh my gosh I gotta get work done I'm so

171
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,400
behind because of Tekken And then so I started getting work
done And then I think like two to three hours I went back to

172
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:24,820
sleep and then I woke up at 11 p.m I woke up at 11 p.m.

173
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,280
And I was like, oh, fuck, I have so much work to do.

174
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,900
But then I got distracted and only did one hour at work.

175
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,780
And I actually got back to work at like 3 a.m.

176
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,180
And started, you know, that's why I posted my schedule at
like 4 in the morning.

177
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,740
Because, you know, I've been awake for, I've only been awake
for like 1% of the day.

178
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:59,220
managed to get my schedule done at 4 in the morning um but
i'm very behind i am very very behind on a lot of things at

179
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:08,660
the moment because of techin and uh and just like like
burying myself with training for techin yeah but it was a it

180
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:17,020
was a great time honestly i'm so happy i said yes to doing
the say jam slam it was a great experience and i made so

181
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:27,640
many new friends uh i really love team brawl pro uh they're
great to hang out with and honestly like um never expected

182
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:38,400
to win first place that's for sure the biggest upset in
history when i when i beat sk no one like i think like only

183
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:45,080
like five percent believed in me in the say jam because
there was like a betting pool uh there was a betting pool

184
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:59,420
apparently during like the me versus sk match and it was
like 300k versus 1.5 million i was like i was literally the

185
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,940
like it was like a david versus goliath situation nobody
expected me to win

186
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,480
it was actually fucking crazy

187
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,360
and um I'm really happy that like I honestly never expected
to win first I was like oh man like because I know my team

188
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,860
was really really good in general um because you know this
was like the same team in the first say jam slam and we

189
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:44,400
literally have Jack Jesus who like only lost one game in the
entire say jam slam um and uh I uh I I expected second but

190
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:57,340
not first because I feel like first Heavily relied on me
winning at least one game Like that's what that's what first

191
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:08,660
was like I just literally didn't win one game And I was like
oh, I don't know about this I I was like, I don't know it's

192
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:17,860
SK And I don't think even my team expected me to win that
one game.

193
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:25,680
I think my team was just like, okay, let's just make sure
she's not sad when she loses.

194
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:38,860
I feel like they were just like, all right, let's just make
sure she's not sad and that she's having a good time.

195
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:54,000
uh yeah nobody expected it but it was so uh uh it was just
insane that that happened i just realized my lure is like

196
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:06,020
not it's sorry my lure is uh not showing up because it's
getting covered let me put that here uh anyway but insane

197
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:13,100
experience i told us i told sayjam that like uh because like
Apparently the next Say Jam Slam is going to be Street

198
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,440
Fighter.

199
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,200
And I hope I get invited to the Street Fighter one.

200
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,500
Because I honestly had a great time.

201
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,260
And then like a lot of the...

202
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,700
Everybody in Team Brawl Pro wants to run it back again for
the next Say Jam Slam.

203
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,960
So yeah, it's for Street Fighter 6.

204
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,720
So I honestly hope I get invited for the next one.

205
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,840
And be also be placed back in Team Brawl Pro.

206
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,760
I don't know.

207
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,280
Like I don't like people like, oh why don't you want to
like, you know, be in a new team.

208
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:51,500
or i i just i just i just really like team brawl pro it's
just vibes you know i feel like i feel like there if i was

209
00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:00,980
in any other team um the chemistry would not be the same i
don't know i just feel like it wouldn't be as fun if um it

210
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,360
was it was like with any other like combination i feel like
It was just the perfect...

211
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,820
I feel like the team was just the perfect combination.

212
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,520
And I hope...

213
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
I asked Seijam.

214
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,300
I was like, oh, if possible.

215
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,220
I told him if possible, I'd love to be invited again for the
Street Fight for the next Seijam Slam.

216
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,800
So I hope I get in.

217
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,200
I hope I get into the next one.

218
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,600
Because it was definitely really, really, really fun.

219
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,200
Apparently, I converted a lot of non-VTuber fans into
watching me now.

220
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,200
Because I was so fucking ridiculous.

221
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:48,040
Because I was unfiltered as fuck And I'm sorry that this is
the first stream you're coming into Where I'm like a bit

222
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:57,660
more chill right now Because I am so behind on a lot of
things If you're expecting more of what I was like During

223
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:09,860
the Tekken arc today I am so sorry I am so busy I'm so, I am
so behind.

224
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,200
So, like, originally I wasn't going to stream today.

225
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:20,340
I wasn't going to stream today because of how busy I was.

226
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,700
But I was like, man, I haven't had time to actually, you
know, talk to you guys and hang out with my chat.

227
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,420
Because when I do, like, collabs, I know, like, a lot of,
like, people who are used to watching, like, Fleshies.

228
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,340
do like push to talk where they would like you know talk to
the group and then like talk to the chat and do push to talk

229
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,280
i don't do push to talk maybe it's not a fleshy thing to do
i'm just lazy

230
00:20:52,180 --> 00:21:01,380
i'm just i'm just lazy as well uh you have to stop but they
are fleshy they call me 2d

231
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:17,820
Anyway, um, uh, as I was saying, um, usually I, the only
time I'd like mute myself to talk to my chat is if there was

232
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,640
like intermission time, which there was during some moments
in Tekken where we had to wait for a game.

233
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,320
So that's when I like, you know, muted myself to talk to you
guys.

234
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,880
But usually in collabs, I try to give like full focus on
like, you know, talking to the people I'm hanging out with

235
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,360
or the people, um, oh, sorry, I met them.

236
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,340
meatbags.

237
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,500
Thank you for the 20 gifted chefs.

238
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:43,940
Thank you.

239
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,540
Thank you.

240
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,480
I really appreciate it.

241
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,020
Thank you.

242
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,080
Sage, thank you.

243
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:47,940
Thank you.

244
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,460
Thank you.

245
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,580
More distractions.

246
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,020
Yippee.

247
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,400
Thank you.

248
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:51,640
Thank you.

249
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:51,900
Super chat.

250
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,200
Thank you.

251
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,800
Thank you.

252
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,640
It's giving you guys a head start.

253
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,940
You guys definitely need it.

254
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:12,880
All I'm saying that you need the head start because the
moment i finish one task like this race is over like this

255
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:22,200
race is so over come on chat we're already at 25 but guys
you can literally add more like some some fucker can like

256
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:33,500
several fuckers can literally just add more tasks for you
guys and ruin your your race like this is rigged there's

257
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,200
slow mode slow mode is actually helping you guys.

258
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,040
I don't know.

259
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,580
Anyway, I mean, the mod can easily put it back.

260
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,840
Put the slow mode to 10 minutes.

261
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,100
Put the slow mode to 10 minutes, not 30 minutes.

262
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,500
Like, give them that, I guess.

263
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,580
Um, anyway, but yes, uh, it is like, oh my god, it doesn't
stop.

264
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,080
Oh my god, it just keeps going.

265
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:20,320
um uh where was that um uh oh yes but yes a lot of new we
have a lot of new viewers uh that came from Tekken because

266
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:29,820
of the shit I like the shit I say when I open my mouth uh
but yes welcome welcome new dragons uh usually you know we

267
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:39,440
usually have like other types of streams not this Like I
said, today I wasn't supposed to be streaming because of how

268
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,480
behind I was on, like, everything, like, in life.

269
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,720
So I figured, you know what, let's just, you know, be able
to, let's just, like, stream our work right now.

270
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,960

I'm glad you guys really enjoyed the tournament arc.

289
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,380
So, like, what else?

290
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,920
Oh, yes.

291
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,200
As you can see, this week is also pretty fucking packed.

292
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,240
I got invited to, you guys can see there's also an Apex
tournament that's happening on the same day as WrestleTuber.

293
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:15,980
So, like, I got invited to a vtuber what it says vtuber but
then there's like non vtuber's in there there's like there's

294
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:24,960
like maybe like i think like two or three non-vtuber's in
there um but anyway there is like a vtuber like apex

295
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:33,040
invitational that's much mostly na and then like usually
like i haven't really participated i don't know you noticed

296
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:45,580
this but in the past invited to like uh like like vtuber
invitations in like na parts of the world um so i've because

297
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:54,080
like i've been invited to like more i guess like pro
tournaments um like pro tournaments uh with like you know na

298
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,640
pros and stuff like that but not like vtuber apex
invitational so i figured like and i looked at the list i

299
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,680
was like oh hey there's like some people here that are like
you know well known in the like apex v i think it's also

300
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:17,400
because there's not a lot of like well known apex uh vtuber
vtuber uh streamers in general i mean to be fair i'm barely

301
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,340
an apex vtuber streamer

302
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:36,840
i'm barely one as well like i'm just variety now um so um so
like i figured like um like they invited me but then I saw

303
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,900
that it's sort of like conflict it comes I didn't like when
they invited me I couldn't tell them why like I was just

304
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,140
like oh I don't know God like I couldn't say like
WrestleTuber because it wasn't announced yet so that was

305
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:54,960
like oh it sort of conflicts with WrestleTuber because like
my thing starts at four and like I can't move the date and

306
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,900
time because like there's a lot of people participating so
then like the organizers there was like oh we'll move our

307
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:08,640
our tournament and I felt bad because they're like because
they moved the me so like they moved the the day the time

308
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:17,180
for it like an hour earlier for me so then i was like oh
okay i was like oh okay that's that's really sweet okay so

309
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:27,920
then i was like all right yeah i could i could do it as long
as i have like time to uh as long as like because i was like

310
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:38,600
oh by the time it ends, I have to I have to like do the do
WrestleTuber because originally they said it's going to end

311
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:48,260
at 4 and I was like, oh, I can't, I can't do that I
literally have to do something at 4 and it's like this whole

312
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,680
event that I'm organizing.

313
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,560
I couldn't say what event it was.

314
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,580
So then they were like, oh we'll do it, we'll have the
tournament like an hour earlier.

315
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,120
And I was like, oh okay.

316
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,380
And then because they you know They said they'll have the
tournament now earlier.

317
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,220
I was like, oh, yeah, okay, I'll join.

318
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,580
Like, because then, like, they moved the tournament.

319
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,860
So I was just like, oh, fuck.

320
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, I'll join.

321
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:23,860
And, um, and so, and like, I felt like I never really had a
chance to join a, in, like, like I said, like, all the other

322
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,140
Apex YouTuber invitational stuff.

323
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:36,980
I've never really been like, um, invited to to it like as a
captain um um i like i think like the last vtuber

324
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:45,680
invitational that happened uh i was like someone got invited
and then they invited me to be on their team but then like

325
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:53,220
the captain had to drop out at the last sec uh at the last
minute do the scheduling thing but then i didn't realize so

326
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,240
i thought i was gonna be part of it but then like because
they dropped The team, like, I think it was, like, a

327
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,960
miscommunication thing because they're like, oh, because it
was supposed to be, like, we find a replacement for the

328
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,400
captain.

329
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,480
But then, like, it was a miscommunication that they ended up
giving the team spot to a different team.

330
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,380
So then, like, I couldn't join.

331
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,320
So it was, like, I was really sad about that.

332
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:21,620
So, like, I never had a chance to ever do a V-Tuber
invitational for Apex in, like, N.A.

333
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:29,220
And I was like, okay, like, like, when I first got that,
like, the invite I was like really happy because I've never

334
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:43,780
been invited before as a captain so you know and I was like
oh I'm sad so I was super super happy that like like I got

335
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:52,720
invited um to like to like one with like all the known like
apex vtubers like not just NA it's also EU because I know

336
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:00,760
like There's like, like, I mean, I got RPR in it, so it's
not just NA, but there's like, um, but like, you know, like

337
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,960
English, I guess like English speaking, English speaking
Apex VTubers.

338
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,940
I feel like that's the better term for it.

339
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,660
Apex, sorry, English speaking, um, uh, Apex VTubers.

340
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,060
Uh, so I'm really happy.

341
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,620
Anyway, I dragged RPR and did a, to it.

342
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,200
We have our first Scrim tomorrow.

343
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,760
Apparently, we've been having Scrims for a while.

344
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,380
But, like, I was literally so busy.

345
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,480
I couldn't join any of the Scrims.

346
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,320
So, like, and there's, like, cash prizes for the Scrims.

347
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,760
So, I think, I mean, it's, like, $150 if we win, I think,
divided by three people.

348
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,920
So, like, you know, $50 each.

349
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,300
If we win the first, if we win the Scrim.

350
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,300
But, yes, Wednesday is the, tomorrow is the first Scrim.

351
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:06,220
you guys can see i got invited to the uh to a um uh billy
billy uh arc server uh v2 billy vtuber arc server but i'll

352
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:18,640
be streaming it on youtube because i don't have a billy
billy account yet um hirro invited me to it um she asked me

353
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,520
i wanted to check it out and there's gonna be like know and
you know like this is not like the first time there's been

354
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:33,660
like an arc server like a vtuber arc server but in the past
i would i i think i i think you guys know i talked about it

355
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:39,780
before because i know like you guys would be like why didn't
you join like why don't you join this arc server uh blah

356
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:46,240
blah blah and i i think i talked about it before where the
reason why i never joined the like arc servers in the past

357
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:57,740
um is because uh of language barriers and uh Because like,
you know, I didn't I felt like I wouldn't enjoy it as much

358
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:03,440
due to the language barriers going in and I wouldn't because
like the whole thing about it is like being able to

359
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,820
communicate with other people on the server.

360
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:15,020
Like, I mean, you know, if I can't speak the language, like
I feel like it wouldn't be as fun, especially when like, you

361
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:21,760
know, the majority about this is like the roleplay and like
I don't want to force people to speak English, you know?

362
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:33,840
like in this one I can understand Chinese so I can like at
least like speak sort of speak it I can like understand and

363
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,740
listen to it so like at least I can like contribute

364
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,000
at least I can like contribute to the conversation

365
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:59,900
that's why I said yes to I said yes to like joining uh to
joining the server so I'm really excited um huge shout out

366
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:10,080
to Hiro for giving me an invite uh to the server um what
else I think that's really it in regards to I mean I wrote

367
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:18,900
some stuff down like what do I want to update my chat with
let's see I like how I'm looking at my server my discord

368
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:28,000
server where I write like notes and stuff and all of it is
just like tech uh down l2 forward forward two go for grab

369
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,040
instead of instant heat smash drawing heat do tomahawk
instead of instant heat running three then r3 like i'm just

370
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:46,400
a server is just like notes of stuff to do and fucking deck
it forward three row running down back two three

371
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:57,540
it's just it didn't crack It's just slowly adding more tasks
guys.

372
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:09,360
It didn't fucking crash chat It's just a lot of stuff being
added to it But yeah, that's the life update I might have

373
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:16,880
more life updates, but I honestly forgot what to say There's
so many things happening.

388
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:21,980
need to make sure i need to ask like confirmation i won't be

392
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:56,860
accepting gifts um um those are like my personal rules just
to make sure like you know will you accept real cash no

393
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:09,520
because the post office is gonna steal it like this is why
we don't send you know in back in the day before paypal was

394
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,900
a thing people will literally send cash you guys remember
that right like back okay no some of you guys are way too

395
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:24,280
young but back in the day people will actually like um Put
cash in their envelopes because PayPal wasn't a thing yet,

396
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,200
which I, it always surprises me that fucking Elon Musk owns
PayPal.

397
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,660

in like envelopes and just send it over and then like um the
post office would uh oh he doesn't own paypal anymore didn't

What was I talking?

452
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:23,400

glitch

453
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:34,500
uh oh yeah yeah the uh anime north but yes uh um but yes it
is uh an in-person thing it's not gonna be streamed or

454
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:40,360
anything the panel so you guys have to be there to be to to
you know to see what the fuck the panel is gonna be i think

455
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:49,200
it's just a q a um it's gonna be a q a a session uh so uh
basically you go there ask me questions and we hang out it's

456
00:41:49,200 --> 00:42:01,440
like a stream but like you're there it's like an exclusive
stream oh yeah it's like a member stream but more exclusive

457
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,340
i think that's like the best way i can explain it honestly
um

458
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:20,900
huh what it's true though it's true True, I feel like that,
that's like basically what panels are.

459
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,580
It's just like a member stream, but like it's a more, it's
more exclusive.

460
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Um, I remember like, oh my gosh, I remember when like Anime
North was like, oh hey, we're gonna have to like, um, they

461
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,880
were like, oh, we're gonna have to like cap.

462
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,520
They're like, oh sorry, but only like X amount of dragoons
can like be in the panel room.

463
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,180
And I was like, that's, that's a lie.

464
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,380
I don't remember.

465
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,420
I think it was like 200.

466
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,280
Let me look at what they said.

467
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,580
I remember it.

468
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,500
And I was like, oh my God.

469
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,520
They're like, oh yeah, I hope you're okay.

470
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:03,760
We like make, like if not everybody can be there, like can
like be in the room because like it's a fire hazard.

471
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,920
I was like, bro, that's a lie.

472
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,640
Let me see what I said.

473
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:22,000
And I felt so embarrassed because I was just like, oh man,
like that's I don't know I don't know if like we'll even

474
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,740
have that many people there let me see uh oh my gosh I want
to see like what I wrote because it's sort of a little

475
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:44,900
embarrassing because like I felt I felt so bad when I said
that um let me see I can find it uh oh my gosh is it the

476
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,380
same person Oh my gosh.

477
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,000
Maybe this is for a different one.

478
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,940
Let me see if I can find it.

479
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,680
Wait, is this the same person?

480
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,680
Or was it for a different convention?

481
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,820
There's so many conventions, guys.

482
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,300
There's...

483
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,300
Fuck.

484
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,960
Okay, I need to find it.

485
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,580
Let's see.

486
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,040
I wish I wrote... Oh, no.

487
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,980
I don't know where it was.

488
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,560
I guess this wasn't the same person.

489
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,180
I think it was 200.

490
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,660
I think it was 200.

491
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,860
I think it was, I don't remember, but it could have been a
different person I was talking to.

492
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,240
no, it has to be Anime North.

493
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,600
Unless she knows it was Narc.

494
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,700
No, okay, it has to be.

495
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:36,400
Uh, but anyway, they're like, are you, is it okay if, like,
uh, if, like, we have to, like, turn some Dragoon, like, we

496
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,640
might have to, like, have a hard cap of how many Dragoons
are allowed in the room.

497
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,320
And I was like, oh, that's fine.

498
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,380
I don't think we're gonna fucking fill that up.

499
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:59,340
I was just I was just like I think that's fine I don't think
we're gonna I don't think we're gonna fill up the room I was

500
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:10,620
just like And then they're like Oh we have a lot of And then
they're I don't know I was like I don't know I don't know

00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,840
I I don't know.

503
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,820
So then they're like, oh, bro, they're like, no, we had this
other VTuber and we had to have hard cap in.

504
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,220
We actually get like a lot of people at a convention.

505
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,280
I was like, oh, I'm sorry.

506
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,520
I was like, I'm so sorry.

507
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,100

508
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,200

509
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,220
I don't know.

510
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,060
Okay, to be fair, in the previous panels, I never really
know how many people are actually.

511
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,520
I mean, I could see

512
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,260
head i'm just like oh yeah oh here we go okay it's 600.

513
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:03,280
they're like the room seats 600 people and it's a pretty
hard cap from the fire marshal and they're like oh and going

the line.

520
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:02,300
And they're like, and then the organizer was like, we're

00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,860
of people line up.

522
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:16,300
And they're like, they're like, Doki, this convention has
37,000 people attending every year.

529
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,800
It'll be a blast.

530
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,660
We're going to party.

531
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,100
We're going to have so much fun.

532
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:16,500
Yeah, Anime North is the first, is the first, the first
convention in the Doki World Tour.

533
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,180
Yippee!

534
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,300
I'm sorry that we couldn't do a meet and greet because like
uh, Adam North was like super last minute, I think uh,

535
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,160
because we saw the email from Adam North, uh, very late.

536
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:36,720
Uh, so like we couldn't at that time they were, they were
like full on like, uh, guests and stuff, but they slid me

537
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,700
in, uh, last minute.

538
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:46,420
And because of that we were able to, uh, we were able to
like, uh, have a panel because it was like the only thing

539
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,980
that was like free i guess it was the only they couldn't
have they didn't have enough time to actually set up any

540
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:58,500
meeting greets and stuff like that only because they're like
it was like the last minute slip in for me but i'm happy to

541
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,380
be still be able to do like you know do a panel at that
convention i know i said i know guys you're like real tour

542
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:10,840

545
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:45,970
also um another update um yes i've been getting a lot of
emails regarding shipments of debut merch i'm really sorry

546
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:54,190
that's been taking a while um we were uh like negotiations
with the distributor is taking surprisingly longer than i

547
00:49:54,190 --> 00:50:00,110
expected um so like currently the only orders that are going
out at the moment are the orders that i've personally

548
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:08,830
packaged and i think i've packaged like 200 orders myself so
like there's a lot of there's a lot of orders so i'm really

549
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:19,970
sorry i'm gonna post a twitter update at the moment uh so uh
like I won't be shy about like how many I'll let you guys

550
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:31,350
know there has been 6,000 plus merch orders not just from
debut but like for the lunar new year as well but the moment

551
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:40,570
we get the distributor thing the moment we get the
distributor thing finalized it will go out so fast it will

552
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:50,010
like bam bam bam bam so at the moment I am packaging it
myself when I do have the time because obviously I time is

553
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,130
not on my side

554
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:07,830
um so uh those lucky people some of you actually already
received the uh received the packages uh that have packaged

555
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:16,390
myself um but yes uh that's why I'm sorry that like the
orders are like like not as fast as i would have liked

556
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:22,990
that's why i haven't had any new merch drops there's been
plans for new merch drops like i've had like plans done for

557
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:31,570
it and i am holding on to a merch drop at the moment but i
told them i was like i'm not releasing any new merch until

558
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:40,690
we we have like until we start like officially not by me
like you know officially by distributor uh shipping these

559
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:54,330
uh because like i obviously want to get that i want to get
that situated before uh before like you know before

560
00:51:54,330 --> 00:52:02,530
releasing anything new i would say i know i talked about
this before but like if i did have like regular merch going

561
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:08,990
in like if i was releasing regular merch like every like
fucking month there's a new merch or anything merch would

562
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:17,770
have basically made would be like 60 to 70 percent If I like
kept the merch stuff going like

563
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:33,730
Because like like merch is like it's such a huge like income
in general I didn't realize how big of a difference like

564
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:41,590
merch can be Until I started selling my own merch because
like the amount I was making off of merch when I released

565
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:49,330
the debut merch and the lunar new year was absolutely crazy
i was just like oh my i'm not i'm like i know i won't be

566
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:57,230
like i'm i'm gonna be transparent like i am making i can
make if i actually like kept releasing new merch drops i can

567
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:05,250
make a lot of money from it um but i want to get situated
first with the fact that i want to make sure that like

568
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:12,430
everybody is getting their merch like uh and they don't wait
it's not delayed too long and that's why i'm not releasing

569
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:28,210
anything new until uh until all of that is like fucking done
like until we have a system for it um and uh and that's why

570
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:34,290
like there's no new releases and stuff like I have okay to
be fair I actually have like I even have graphics made for

571
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:41,510
the next drop but like we're not releasing this until like
much much later I think like I showed it uh people in the

572
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:48,550
members might have seen it both seen it because I did show
it but I'll show you guys I'll show you guys what it is um

573
00:53:48,550 --> 00:54:01,630
but it's basically uh uh it is basically the uh I was I was
planning on doing merch drop of the uh of the intro let me

574
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:13,730
see if I can fucking find it because like there's uh there's
no naming system for my shit there's no name oh here it is

575
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:28,390
Okay, um I think it's this Alright, so like This was gonna
be the next Merch drop That's gonna be like on hold Until

576
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,150
everything's Okay

577
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:42,170
People in the members have already seen it But like it was
basically like stickers and buttons were gonna be Gotcha

578
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,730
because like there was a lot

579
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:54,190
we have so it'll be like stuff like this so i mean the
stance you can like you can if you want to you can have it

580
00:54:54,190 --> 00:55:02,870
all and create your own fucking dancing and dancing dokey
like stance where you could choose um you can choose which

581
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:10,670
one and then uh i think this one had no why is it and then
there was like there was like gotcha for the stickers

582
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:17,350
because there was more choices to it so like stickers were
gotcha so I could just like stick my hand in and be like

583
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:21,490
okay well when we have distributor the distributor was gonna
stick their hand

584
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:36,690
but like like I said we're not releasing that until we
fucking figure out Until like the distributor shit is like

585
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,770
finally situated and stuff.

586
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,670
The negotiations took, it's taking much longer.

587
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,910
Like I said, it's taking much longer than I expected.

588
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:52,490
Um, because like at first, um, I guess like the, like when
we were talking, the distributors who were talking to

589
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:58,390
multiple distributors, they were not prepared for the amount
of orders I was going to get.

590
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:04,070
So the negotiations were taking much longer because when
we're telling them like, yeah these are like the amount of

591
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,610
pre-orders we're getting they're like whoa

592
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,690
that's that's a lot more than we expected

593
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:32,210
i really appreciate it jagoons for like the huge amount of
support uh the huge amount of support from uh for the merch

594
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:36,990
in general and And I really appreciate your patience because
we have been getting a lot of emails because I know I did

595
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:42,550
say like, you know, like around this time things were being
sent out and it hasn't been sent out yet.

596
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:49,110
It's just that I'll be doing a Twitter and the community
post update for it later because I've been waiting.

597
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,490
I've been waiting to see if we finalize the negotiations.

598
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,470
But obviously we haven't.

599
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:02,970
So I know we've been getting a lot of emails about it every
day about like, oh, when?

600
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:11,830
is the order coming in um but i'll uh i'm gonna keep you

guys so much like uh honestly like if um i just kept going

602
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:29,530
with the merch drops like it's a huge i think like obviously
now it's not really a big like not a big part of my income

603
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:39,610
at the moment but definitely If I, like, when, if I, like,
kept the rate of doing merch drops, if I, you know, if I

604
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:47,290
had, like, merch drops every other month or every month,
that could have easily been, like, 60 to 70% of my income if

605
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,270
I kept at it.

606
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,810
Like, I, I'm going to be super transparent with you guys.

607
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:58,270
That is literally, that is, like, that could be 60 to 70% of
my income if I kept at it, like, every month or every other

608
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:58,550
month.

609
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:13,650

615
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:56,790
merch and stuff and not designing you i guess not designing
new merch but like figuring out the merch system

616
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:07,530
yeah yeah like because a lot of stuff I am doing by myself

01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:23,430
like there's like it's like bump like what's the word like
it like actually pops out like the like like oh what's uh

625
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:32,270
the metal is actually popping out type deal it's not like a

639
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:29,750
uh oh yeah i know like some of you guys are like when's the
minecraft server i'm so sorry it's taking so long uh we like

640
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:38,250
hit some uh bumps in the road because like i was also really
busy and they needed like they needed me to like uh figure

641
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:46,070
out like colors and stuff of like how the server looks like
so like um okay let me show you like a before and after uh

642
01:02:46,070 --> 01:03:02,490
we will redecorate this later okay i know like the colors
right now they might not be like the best um um anyway so

643
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:08,390
like uh do we have like some because like okay this was the
original color for the main hub we're gonna change the main

644
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:14,370
hub later because at first like I want to give you guys
more, like, okay, sorry, for those, for those who don't

645
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:21,230
know, we're starting a members Dragoon Minecraft server,
but, like, I'll be streaming the server publicly because you

646
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:26,630
can't, like, you can put the server, like, joining the
server behind a paywall, but you can't stream Minecraft

647
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:27,670
behind a paywall.

648
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,210
But, like, I know, like, it's been in the works because
there's been, like, a lot of stuff going on.

649
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:40,930
But like this was the original concept for the lobby, but
that was like that's just too brown I was like oh my gosh,

650
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:49,850
it's just brown And then we're gonna also later on when we
actually have people in the lobby So then we like put more

651
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:55,750
color into it like and so it looks like this now I know it
looks weird

652
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:14,490
I know there's like a lot of colors But like I said, this is
just a main lobby It is just a It's just a main lobby for

653
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:20,670
now So like obviously you all spawn in here All you guys
will spawn Like there's gonna be You guys will all spawn in

654
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:30,470
here So you can create better Like when you join your
faction You can create like You can create like better

655
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:37,230
builds if you want Later on, the main lobby will get
upgraded the more, like, the more we play.

656
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:40,050
Because, like, now they're like, what do you want?

657
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,230
And I'm like, I don't know.

658
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:49,270
They're like, Doki, what do you want for your main lobby?

659
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:51,590
And I'm like, I don't fucking know.

660
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,630
I don't know.

661
01:04:54,570 --> 01:05:00,350
So they made this from, like, the notes I gave them, which
was, I don't know.

662
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:16,350
so this is i really appreciate it from um from like the
designers for making this based off of my notes which was no

663
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,690
notes in general so

664
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:28,250
so like i'm i that's why i was like i'm fine with this for
now because i think like later on when we like figure out

665
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:35,830
what we want the unique guy i don't know i don't know what
hop should look like like i've been i've been shooting for

666
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:51,210
like three months like what do i have we'll build on it more
later later it look different guys i swear it'll look

667
01:05:51,210 --> 01:06:01,170
different later anyway anyway so you guys are like wondering
okay so like what do you mean by factions so like um so like

668
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:08,250
you can you have push a button and then you're going to be
taken to this island where uh you're going to be like

669
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:18,050
picking which faction you want to join um so obviously
there's like a goon the dragon and stuff like that so you

670
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:29,910
can pick your faction uh so obviously uh um uh the territory
will not be linked to your you also can claim your land so

671
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:38,250
like each person has like an amount of blocks they can claim
and uh like i said this is for members like to join a server

672
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:44,350
you have to be a member uh but we'll be streaming the server
on public streams like the the gameplay of this will be

673
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:51,570
streamed so obviously like you each get to have get to claim
land uh so you know the people won't be griefing each other

674
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:03,350
like you know if you leave your build can we invade people's
lands if they didn't claim it yeah you can there'll be like

675
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:11,910
pvp zones too we'll have like areas where you can fight if
you want to um so uh yes and then we'll have like like

676
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:24,010
resource areas as well uh so that's why like uh that's like
that's basically what it's gonna be like uh so that's an

677
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:30,810
update on the minecraft stuff anyway I'll give you guys an
hour and 15 minutes of a head start.

678
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,790
Let me finish one task and win this race, guys.

679
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:35,570
Like, that's literally all I have to do.

680
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,390
I just need to finish one fucking task.

681
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,240
That's all.

682
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,360
I hell no.

683
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,840
I guess they're not making this much of a competition right
now.

684
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,300
Only, like, really?

685
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,080
I gave you guys an hour and 30 minutes.

686
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,460
50, 20, almost an hour, 20 minutes.

687
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,820
And you're only up to 20.

688
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,780
2%?

689
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,120
Not even 25?

690
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,820
This is great.

691
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,820
Don't let her win.

692
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,380
I don't know, guys.

693
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,560
To be fair, you guys aren't even helping each other.

694
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:25,440
Because, like, you're adding more stuff to it in the way
that, like, you're sabotaging yourself.

695
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,200
So, like...

696
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:33,900
It really only takes several dragoons to fuck over
everybody.

697
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,060
I, like, just got here.

698
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,920
It's like, bro, there's the backfiller.

699
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,740
Buster, the backfiller there.

700
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:44,480
He just got here and he already lost.

701
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:46,400
Hmm.

702
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:48,700
All right.

703
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:49,680
Rigged.

704
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,520
Why?

705
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:52,760
All right.

706
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,360
You guys got better remember what you fucking wrote, too.

707
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,100
All right.

708
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,340
Time to work, guys.

709
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,700
chatting is actually time to work, guys.

710
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,740
I sat down for, like, an hour and 30 minutes in his workday.

711
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,220
Usually, okay, guys, do you think it's worth the risk to
listen to, like, Disney jazz?

712
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,300
Do you think...

713
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,480
We don't need a monetize.

714
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,660
It's a chatting stream.

715
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,280
Fuck it.

716
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,420
I know, like, it's lo-fi, but, like, I don't care.

717
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,620
I usually listen to Disney jazz to help work.

718
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,340
Okay, Disney jazz.

719
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:24,820
No!

720
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:27,600
Dude.

721
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,040
what it is.

722
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,900
I just lose ad revenue.

723
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:31,740
Who cares?

724
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,400
It's just ad revenue.

725
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,860
It's just ad revenue.

726
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,260
They just fucking, oh no, my fucking five dollars.

727
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,960
They can't.

728
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,300
Okay, all right.

729
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:53,640
If it's not, okay, Studio Ghibli might be a little bit more
ambitious, though, to be fair, because it's Japan.

730
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:57,820
So, Studio Ghibli Cafe Jazz.

731
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,880
All right, Wakata Jazz, that's like less Disney and Studio
Jibli.

732
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,540
All right, let's play for fire.

733
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,840
Let's get Japan and Disney involved.

734
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,960
Let's fucking go.

735
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,600
Japan and Disney involved.

736
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,840
No, that's...

737
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,240
Bro, oh my god, is there Studio Jibli, Nintendo, and Disney
Jazz?

738
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:27,700
Okay, Jibli, Nintendo, Disney, Jazz.

739
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,220
Let's put all three in there.

740
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,620
We might as well.

741
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:36,810
You're right.

742
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:38,310
We got to throw in some Nintendo.

743
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,250
All right, let's see.

744
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,990
All right, I got you guys.

745
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,010
We're going to put, like, Nintendo.

746
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,030
Oh, my gosh.

747
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:52,170
Let's start out with, like, the Animal Crossing, Jazz.

748
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:54,210
Is this Animal Crossing?

749
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,790
Yeah.

750

01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:10,930
68 out of 263.

01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,050

so they can get their heirloom.

800
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,700
I like how Din Viesel was like, do one push-up.

801
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,060
Done.

802
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,580
Did one push-up.

803
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,400
Someone didn't give Din Viesel a medal.

804
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,020
He did one push-up.

805
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:25,270
Ten minute push-up.

806
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,460
Oh, you guys see that?

807
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,000
There he is.

808
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,400
Get heirloom from Apex.

809
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,180
There he is.

810
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:38,280
It showed up on the to-do list.

811
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,020
Guys, it's there!

812
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,340
Now you know who to blame.

813
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:10,850
Boy, thank you, the super chat.

814
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:11,690
Thank you, thank you.

815
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:15,410
I'm so hyped for one day to see you open up that Minecraft
PvP server.

816
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,970
I waited on this for years.

817
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:17,650
Thank you, the super chat.

818
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:18,130
Thank you, thank you.

819
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:18,550
Me too.

820
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:22,030
I'm really happy to be able to open that soon.

821
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,190
Super excited.

822
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:32,550
I'm pretty sure you guys are gonna be so creative and like I
want to build more onto that server and maybe host like Some

823
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:40,170
minecraft events in that server too for like community
events too in the future Because I have like an actual

824
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:48,110
minecraft team that can like they work on like they the team
that hired to do the server Um They've worked for like

825
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:55,630
twitch and stuff for like minecraft twitch rivals So they're
able to develop like actual like events and stuff for us in

826
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:58,090
the future Like, member events.

827
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:12,140
So, like, we're obviously going to build up more and more of
it.

828
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,580
And, like, it's not just going to be, like, something I'm
just going to let it die.

829
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,060
I'm going to make sure that we can improve it more and more.

830
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,760
And there's always going to be players on it, too.

831
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,360
There's always going to be people on the server.

832
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:27,800
And it's always going to be fun.

833
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,360
And if, like, I might have, I want in the future to
implement a system.

834
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:43,960
like um uh if like i feel like if x amount of maybe like if
more than they haven't been back to server after like you

835
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:52,040
know like three to four months or something um their builds
like the p like their builds won't be protected so that if

836
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:59,320
like you know obviously people come and go um i think in the
future i'm not sure like i'm not sure like the time frame

837
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:05,300
but i don't want to be just make it the server so that like
new people can't come in and the new people can't come in

838
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:12,880
and have nowhere else to build so i want like in the future
um uh if there's like like deserted builds or stuff like

839
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:19,960
that there's like a way to like uh what's the word uh
there's a way to make sure like new players can still can

840
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:25,180
join in and um and have like somewhere to build

841
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:38,410
he went silly and dumb minecraft But the actual Minecraft
drama?

842
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:48,070
We do not want to be involved in any Minecraft drama.

843
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:51,450
In any real Minecraft drama.

844
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:54,250
That shit is off limits.

845
01:24:57,810 --> 01:24:58,690
There is Minecraft.

846
01:24:58,990 --> 01:24:59,350
Yes.

847
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:01,190
Just like in Smash.

848
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,890
Because the Minecraft...

849
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:04,390
I'm sorry.

850
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:05,270
But like...

851
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,190
The Minecraft is...

852
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:16,410
smash communities are predominantly children and because of
that it is not a fun time

853
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:23,290
you don't you don't want to be near that shit

854
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:42,720
it's because a lot of people get popular I'm gonna say it
I'm gonna say it it's not really I don't think I don't think

855
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:54,680
it's like a super I don't think it's like a like you know
hot topic thing to say but like um a lot of the people who

856
01:25:54,680 --> 01:26:07,940
get popular really fast in minecraft they've never been okay
it's so fucked up they've never peaked before so like the

857
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:17,720
most intention they ever got was in minecraft was playing
Minecraft and majority of it are like, you know, they're

858
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,040
like, oh my god, look at all this attention that I'm
getting.

859
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,600
Nobody ever gave me that much attention before.

860
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,720
Oh my God, people actually, oh my God.

861
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,880
And then they're like, I have so much power.

862
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,300
And then they're like super young as well.

863
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,060
They're super young.

864
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:50,160
And that's the scary part when someone is like really young
and have like so much attention and money um and never

865
01:26:50,160 --> 01:27:04,420
really like had consequences and it gets to their head real
quick yes um because like you know being like a millionaire

866
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:19,540
at like 18 is nothing okay not nothing but like having an 18
year old millionaire is scary because an 18 year old

867
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:31,060
millionaire would think wow when you give an 18 year old
that much money you don't you don't want to know what

868
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:41,040
they're gonna spend i feel like that rarely ends well and
that's the minecraft community

869
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:54,860
and and and that is the minecraft community sometimes
they're not even 18 sometimes they're 16 with million with

870
01:27:54,860 --> 01:28:07,860
millions of dollars um but yes we don't want to be involved
in any minecraft drama oh and then the worst part is that

871
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:16,380
even when they have that drama all they have to do is just
wait a couple of months and then like they're fine it

872
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:26,360
doesn't matter because you might say the internet will
always remember but like children don't children will never

873
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:40,860
remember they're like but he's funny he's he's funny though

874
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:50,180
Not a majority.

875
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,250
Why bad when funny?

876
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:00,450
There are new children.

877
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:00,850
True.

878
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:02,610
There's new children take their place.

879
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,660
That's why the Minecraft community scares me.

880
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,200
I mean, like...

881
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:21,780
We can all see...

882
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:22,180
Like...

883
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:30,760
like like okay it's not really a huge like not like oh my
god joki you're not supposed to talk about it but like

884
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:38,820
easily the dream sm like the whole dream smp or whatever
like everybody that's part of the dream group got fucking

885
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:50,100
into some sort of controversy and they're okay like i think
there's it doesn't matter it's still okay like

886
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,260
What happened to that?

887
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,080
There's so many.

888
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:59,060
I remember like, because like, Agumi, like, knows about it.

889
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:05,580
Cause, like, she's, like, friends with, like, within, like,
the Minecraft community.

890
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,460
And then I got really confused.

891
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,020
Cause, like, she was like, oh my God.

892
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,120
Did you hear about what happened to this person?

893
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,040
And I was like, who?

894
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,220
And then she, like, explained it to me.

895
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:16,280
And I was like, who the fuck?

896
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,560
I didn't look it up.

897
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:20,320
I was like, one million followers.

898
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,180
I was like, oh, this guy is important.

899
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:26,260
it and then and then they're like yeah there's a whole shit
going on right now

900
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:38,300
and then like i look back i think like recently i checked up
on it and then like they're still okay like people forgot or

901
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,880
not forgot but like minecraft

902
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:05,960
oh how many fucking controversies has dream got into so far
like it never stops i feel like every two to three months i

903
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:11,820
hear something new about dream that i don't want to hear
about but he's still making millions of dollars

904
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:25,930
a lot like you can't even like list any that's what i'm
saying the internet will like the okay maybe like minecraft

905
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:33,150
portion like they'll just oh my god there was one else so
okay i swear minecraft drama i can't even talk about this

01:32:57,830 --> 01:32:58,630
He cannot do.

929
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,050
He can do no wrong.

930
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,410
It's like the ones.

931
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:13,490
It honestly reminds me of like, it when like uh like
handsome murderers are on trial and then the women are and

932
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:23,110
then there's like women and and i guess like gay men are
like oh my god but he's so hot though i can fix him

933
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:41,090
apparently i don't guys notice but like um there was like
what was his name um oh my god like I guess dead wait is he

934
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:52,610
who is the one that was had a call that had like a fucking
murder call was it Ted Bundy okay do you know like Ted was

935
01:33:52,610 --> 01:34:03,630
it Ted who was the one yeah Ted or was it Manson which one
had okay there were so many murder cults like Charles Manson

936
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:12,290
did you know he had like several prison wives prison for
murder you know for the murder cult but then like several

937
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:19,950
like women outside of prison would send him like mail up and
then like he got married to several women while he was in

938
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:29,270
prison because the women outside of prison was like although
he murdered a lot of people but like he's hot though

939
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:38,950
You guys didn't know that?

940
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:47,170
He literally had like wise like he had wise while in prison
because so many like women sent him like mail like literally

941
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:50,150
wrote mail to him as like a pen pal stuff.

942
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:53,190
Like it's not like they were in prison with him.

943
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:57,190
It was like they were outside of prison, you know, regular
people.

944
01:34:57,490 --> 01:35:02,010
I don't know if you can say regular because they're fucking
like married to fucking Charles Manson.

945
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:03,990
Like,

946
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:13,930
alright, like, I guess you're not normal anymore after
you're trying to fucking marry Charles Manson, the little

947
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:15,250
leader of a murder cult.

948
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:24,290
Like, oh yeah, I guess like Ted Bundy, too.

949
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:24,890
Yeah, sorry.

950
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:27,630
Ted Bundy and Charles Manson.

951
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:32,590
Um, but, like, they literally had, like, wives while, like,
not even, like, singular.

952
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:43,830
wife wife not even a singular wife it's wives and then like
um and like it was very public with all the stuff they

953
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:50,810
actually did like it's not like misunderstood where they're
like we don't know if he actually did we all knew we all

954
01:35:50,810 --> 01:36:01,130
fucking knew what they did it's not like they're like but
Did he, no, he did do it.

955
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:04,430
We all knew he did do it.

956
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:09,850
There is an unbelievable amount of evidence that they did
what they did.

957
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:14,550
And even after everybody knew what they fucking did,

958
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:21,230
they still had multiple prison wives.

959
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:28,610
Oh yeah, even Dalmer.

960
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:29,710
Oh yeah, I remember that.

961
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:31,130
And his fangirls, who fought?

962
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,850
They don't, my God, was, That's so funny.

963
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:36,010
I can fix him.

964
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,410
People make mistakes.

965
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:52,430
People change.

966
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:58,250
I remember seeing, I don't remember who it was.

967
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:03,890
It might have been Ted Bundy, but I watched an interview of,
like, one of the fucking, like, serial killers.

968
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:09,690
And, like, he was, like, diagnosed as a sociopath.

969
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:12,390
Like, literally committing several murders.

970
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:15,910
And then, like, an interviewer was doing an interview on
him.

971
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:19,710
And he, like, people were like, oh, man, he just seems
misunderstood.

972
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:29,070
Because, you know, if you're a sociopath, you can make, you
can, like, pretend you have empathy and stuff.

973
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:38,170
And, uh, and then, like, they're like, oh, yeah, like, I,
like, I didn't really mean to do that, you know?

974
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:43,110
like reading the YouTube comments and people are like, man.

975
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:46,970
And then some guy, like others were like, bro, what the
fuck?

976
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:49,470
This guy is a little like, oh, it's psychopath.

977
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:49,970
Sorry.

978
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:54,110
Is it no, sociopaths also are similar.

979
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:54,610
Is it?

980
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:55,750
I forgot.

981
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:57,150
What's the difference between sociopaths?

982
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:00,330
Uh...

983
01:38:01,070 --> 01:38:01,490
No.

984
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:03,470
Yeah, no.

985
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:04,490
Okay, Psycho.

986
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:05,710
I feel like Psycho.

987
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:07,850
They're not the same thing.

988
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:11,170
I'm trying to remember what the difference between a
sociopath and a psychopath.

989
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:13,110
Um.

990
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:16,070
Oh, sorry.

991
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:16,610
A psychopath.

992
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:17,190
Yeah.

993
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:18,330
No.

994
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:21,250
A psychopath is the one where you actually have no empathy.

995
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:25,250
Sociopaths are where you can have empathy.

996
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:27,850
But it's like not really, not that much.

997
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:32,170
It's psychopaths that are like actual no empathy at all.

998
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:38,400
Uh, Manny, thank you for the super chat.

never had to like actually hand sign anything with like an

I had a great time.

1248
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:19,740
Just, uh, you can't even complete the task until 10 minutes
later.

1249
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:21,800
There's still a slow bone.

1250
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:25,260
It was all rigged against you.

1251
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:35,480
No matter what, Tokyo, the house always wins.

1252
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:37,520
Uh, Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

1253
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:38,380
Thank you, thank you.

1254
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:40,120
Nah, nah, we won round one.

1255
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:42,420
Oh, but it was nice just relaxing.

1256
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:43,040
Um, sorry.

1257
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:44,160
not a super long stream.

1258
02:18:44,380 --> 02:18:47,200
I think it's because, like, I did, like, a really long
stream for Stajab Slam.

1259
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,900
So, like, honestly, this today is just more so of chill.

1260
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:52,320
And tomorrow, there's, like, double streams, too.

1261
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:55,400
So this is more so of, like, an appetizer.

1262
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:57,700
Just a chill session with everybody.

1263
02:18:58,240 --> 02:19:02,000
A hangout session, like, some solo hangout session with you
guys.

1264
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:04,000

1267
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:07,880
