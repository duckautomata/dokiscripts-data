1
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,510
Hello, everybody.

2
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,930
Hello, hello.

3
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,170
Welcome, everybody.

4
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:07,490
We today, we are going to finish Resident Evil 4 because I
know it's not that long.

5
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,650
Okay, it's like five hours, I think, like around five hours.

6
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,550
So this is going to be a while.

7
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,930
We're going to be here for a while.

8
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,410
But also, how do I know this?

9
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,030
Because sometimes when I'm like hesitant and be like, the
chat tell me the right that I do.

10
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:29,990
that I'm like almost done I was thinking like was chat right
when I asked them how much I have left of the game so

11
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:37,330
sometimes if I don't want to risk it and I would like look
up I don't spoil myself I just find the exact part where I

12
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:46,230
stop at so I'll look I'll be like Resident Evil 4 uh play
through no commentary and then I try and find the area where

13
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,190
I stop and I can't believe I got gaslit so fucking hard in
that Ashley level.

14
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:03,430
Remember that level where you guys were like, Oh my god,
Doki, how dare you skip that part because somebody told you

15
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,010
the answer for the clock?

16
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,730
That was like one minute.

17
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,150
One minute.

18
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:16,170
Because the piece of paper where I find the time of like how
much I had to like of the time of the clock was literally

19
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,270
right next to me.

20
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,030
minute that I missed.

21
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:27,610
And then people in that chat were like, wow, Doki, how
fucking could you eliminating that content from us?

22
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,610
How could you, Doki?

23
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,470
I can't believe it.

24
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,350
Wow.

25
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,230
It was one minute of content.

26
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,330
I can't believe all of you yelled at me for one minute of
content.

27
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,450
I thought I missed out on something very important.

28
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,490
Like, I was like, oh my god, did I actually skip, like, 30
minutes of the Ashley level?

29
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,910
It was one minute.

30
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,810
It was fucking one minute.

31
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,510
The paper was right next to me.

32
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,810
Oh my god, we missed one minute of Doki being scared.

33
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,750
How could you, Doki?

34
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,910
How could you do this to us?

35
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,290
It was one fucking minute.

36
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:26,850
I was like, wow, let me see how much I actually missed out
on by doing the clock like right away instead of trying to

37
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,730
find the clue.

38
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,130
I can't fucking believe you guys.

39
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,270
Minnie, she's on to us.

40
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,470
Thank you for the super chat.

41
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,010
Thank you.

42
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,510
Thank you.

43
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,250
I can't believe it.

44
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,810
The dragon finish it, Doki.

45
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,370
I've never seen the island.

46
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,910
Either way, good luck on today's run.

47
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,190
Thank you for the super chat.

48
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,770
Thank you.

49
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,530
Thank you.

50
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,750
Lift, Toki, you don't understand.

51
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,450
Also, did you guys hear about the ALGS stuff?

52
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,850
I was watching it live on NiceWick's stream.

53
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,270
Because I was curious.

54
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,610
And then I...

55
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,290
And I was like...

56
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,490
And then like I tabbed out and I was like looking at my
Twitter.

57
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,710
And then people were like talking about it.

58
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:23,710
So for those who don't follow Apex Legends esports scene,
got hacked live during the tournament during and this is not

59
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:31,030
just like a regular it was like basically the the the finals
to land so like whoever does really well in this in the

60
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:42,130
finals for apex goes to land so like this was like real shit
so it was the okay i'm sorry i know it's so fucked up but it

61
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:53,550
was so funny because like so the two players were gen burden
and imperial hell um and it was so funny because when it

62
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:00,470
happened to gen burden he was like i'm getting hacked i'm
getting hacked and then he left the game instantly and then

63
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:08,170
and then when it happened to hell how was like oh my god i'm
getting hacked But what if I just stop shooting?

64
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,740
Because he's like, but what if I just don't shoot guys?

65
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,740
What if I just don't shoot?

66
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm cheating, I'm cheating.

67
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,960
And then, and then they're like, and then he proceeds to
kill people with AIMBot.

68
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,340
It was so fucking funny.

69
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,900
He's like, he just started, proceeds to keep playing and
also continues to kill people with AIMBot.

70
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,200
then they were like and then like other pro players were
like why the fuck did you not leave and then the hat was

71
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:53,160
like i don't know he was like no that would be what i had
was my aim assist like i know i did that and then people

72
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:02,820
were like people were like it's so fucked up when you can't
tell if it's aim assist or if it was aim bot like no one

73
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:11,800
knows because no one knows if he used aim bot or if it was
aim assist because we can't tell it was then we can't tell

74
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:20,360
they were like it was like 1v1 and they were like up close
so no one knows which which one it was so like people can't

75
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:34,420
tell if it was off or not and um so that happened during the
apex tournament and the scary thing is that No one knows how

76
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:42,180
this person did it Is apparently like a security breach But
the thing is I think like what people like like okay So like

77
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,140
this hacker A lot of like the normies are like really scared
They're like oh don't turn on Don't play apex right now

78
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,820
don't do it Don't play apex uninstall apex Don't even touch
it because there's a security breach But like the thing is

79
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:04,460
Only this hacker has that Has that power This is only like
it's a very well This hacker has been around in the Apex

80
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,960
community for a while.

81
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,900
He always does these crazy hacks.

82
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,900
He always does these crazy hacks on pro players.

83
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,060
But this is the first time he has done this in the
tournament.

84
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,220
Because he's hacked Hal.

85
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,100
And he has hacked Hal.

86
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,540
And he has hacked Mandate before in the past.

87
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
This is the same hacker.

88
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,800
So people don't know yet.

89
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,780
So a lot of people are scared.

90
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,640
Because they're like, oh, what if it's my turn next?

91
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,220
Um, yeah, he's just there.

92
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,140
He's doing it for publicity, basically.

93
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,580
Like, he's just some kid that's doing this for publicity.

94
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,400
Some very fucking smart kid.

95
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,260
Uh-huh.

96
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,620
So I feel like right now, I know it's like, if you want to
be safe, don't touch Apex.

97
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,680
But most likely, like, since he's, like, the only kid that
has, like, this power.

98
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,080
Um, like, the, like, the people out there that are not,
like, public figures, they're okay.

99
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,380
Like, they're okay.

100
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,920
Like, the non-public figures are okay right now.

101
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,960
Because he's just targeting.

102
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,880
He's done this before.

103
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,920
He's breached the apex, like, security multiple times
before.

104
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
But this has been, like, the biggest publicity stunt he has
ever done.

105
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:23,360
You know when, like, okay, so those who have seen the clip
of, like, the Jen burning clip, when he, like, brought up a,

106
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,000
when he brought up the aimbot, because, like, he brings up
the aimbot.

107
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,600
If you look so closely, if you look closely at the...

108
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,940
The aimbot like app that he had open.

109
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:36,820
It is.

110
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,100
It's it's it's it's a fucking meme.

111
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,860
It's not even a real like aimbot app.

112
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,340
Like the the stuff in that in the dialogue.

113
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,600
If there's a screenshot.

114
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,080
Yeah.

115
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,520
There's a screenshot of it.

116
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
And it's not even the real.

117
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,860
It's not even like an actual app.

118
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,180
This kid made a fucking PNG.

119
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,600
Like he made like a.

120
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:13,420
fucking he made his own app he made his own fucking app like
a fake client just to troll people on like oh my god you

121
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:27,800
know this is a 15 year old kid you fucking know this is a 15
year old kid though

122
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:47,100
very smart one um but yeah it was it's actually it's
actually crazy uh it's actually insane that this happened at

123
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,320
best if you really do want to be safe i guess just don't
play apex at the moment if you're actually like super

124
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:01,640
paranoid but i think like for it like at like there's no
like i feel like they're just he's just targeting like

125
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:09,000
public figures at the moment to make a statement regarding
the security of EA servers because like he's done this

126
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,300
before and the thing is he's been the only hacker that's
been doing this other than Tuffy but for him it was Tuffy

127
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:29,820
and then Tuffy got sued to oblivion and now that's why he's
gone the reason why Tuffy's not here anymore is because he

128
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:39,240
actually got sued so like now he's gone on so now it's this
fucking 15 year old kid that's doing all of this now like

129
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:52,420
he's like he's like the successor of tuffy so um um so
that's and they always do it for publicity like like the

130
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:04,760
thing is uh it i'm not worried because like i'm not worried
or scared because like these people only Like, if they

131
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,000
really want to, like, fuck people over, they would not have,
like, told people that they were hacking.

132
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,120
They would just, actually, just, like, just, like, not even
tell anybody that, like, like, like, like, like, like, they

133
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,900
would throw Jen Burden under the bus and make people believe
that he was actually hacking.

134
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,200
But he did all of this for a publicity stunt.

135
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,080
That's why I'm not, like, I'm not, like, worried about it or
anything.

136
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:33,860
And, like, people are still, like, you know, like, if the
pros are still playing Apex, then they know some, I know

137
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,060
some.

138
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:46,880
stuff too then they then they uh then they know something we
don't because if the pros are still playing apex rank and

139
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:55,840
like they're still playing apex then they know something
that we don't or so so that's why i like i'm not like really

140
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:04,560
worried um but stop thank you for the super chat thank you
Thank you.

141
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,140
15-year-old versus indie developer, EA.

142
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,100
Thank you for the super chat.

143
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,520
Thank you.

144
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,160
Thank you.

145
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,220
Also, like, yeah, so there's like, we have the Challenger
circuit.

146
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,960
I don't know what's going to go on with that for now.

147
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,660
I don't know what's happening with that.

148
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,020
So, like, it might be delayed.

149
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,780
I don't know.

150
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,100
Because, like, right now, all tournaments are at, like, the
pro league is postponed at the moment.

151
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,120
So it might affect Challenger circuit.

152
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,020
We don't know.

153
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,660
We don't know.

154
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm waiting for, like, an announcement about what's going on
and stuff.

155
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,760
So, at the moment, we're just waiting.

156
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,500
It could be delayed, the Challenger Circuit at that point.

157
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,420
It could be delayed.

158
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,500
Anyway, what else?

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,100
Use your sick days.

188
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,800
You have one.

189
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,560

Please don't ditch work for me, guys.

192
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,460
Because working grants you money, and by having money, you
can pay for it.

193
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,500
for internet bills.

194
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,720
And by paying internet bills, you can watch me.

195
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,480
And then by watching me, you support me.

196
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,300
And then to support me, you have to go to work.

197
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,840
And then, yeah, it's a circle.

198
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,540
It's a circle.

199
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,760
Please don't skip work.

200
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,700
Ada?

201
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,560

I don't think all of these guys are gonna try and kill me,
so we'll be fine.

379
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,240
And this is what the fish is for.

380
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:14,940

One extraordinary honor this is.

554

Those are the red rope guys.

563
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,850
Because they were like buggy.

564
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:17,490
next form of evolution return to bug honestly i feel like
bugs are like pretty pretty like uh uh what is it oh what's

565
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:24,930
the word they're pretty like hardcore in the evolution line
because they like there's like like you know like some bugs

566
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:32,710
they can't fucking die because they have like hard
exoskeletons and then they they like breed like crazy so

567
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:39,230
they can like produce like thousands and millions of insects
at once like the queen can just lay a thousand fucking

568
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,790
insects and stuff like and it's like what and then like
their tongue okay they're not they're like strong too like

569
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:54,090
ants they can like hold up like times 10 their fucking body
weight and stuff and they're pretty resilient yeah so like

570
00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:01,850
in a way they are sort of like better than humans if they
were like human size i'd i would be very fucking scared

571
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:09,370
about a human size insect like that's the only thing there's
that that's the only thing that's stopping them they're just

572
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:19,290
too tiny if they were bigger if they were bigger then they
would be like scary they were they would actually be like

573
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,550
really fucking scary

574
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,510
They're so fucking tiny.

575
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,410
They will collapse.

576
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,330

00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,820
Is this a shortcut?

678
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,560
Yay!

679
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm gonna go back.

680
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:36,840
I'm gonna go back.

681
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,160
We need to fix my knife.

682
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,700
How else am I gonna be stabbing some bugs?

683
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,800
Alright, this way.

684
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,320
This way.

685
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,400
Merchant!

686
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,740
I need you to fix my knife.

687
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,740
I stabbed too many bugs.

688
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,660
I love shortcuts.

689
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,180
Tune up, repair.

690
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,020
Oh my god, I have no armor.

691
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:04,840
Okay.

692
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,940
I might as well upgrade the power and the durability here.

693
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,020
I feel like I'm going to be using this a lot.

694
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,620
I stabbed one too many bugs.

695
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,380
Equip.

696
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:21,860
Yeah.

697
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,480
That's right.

698
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,500
This has to be...

699
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,680
Oh, I go the right way this way.

700
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,240
All right.

701
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,420
There we go.

702
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,620
Back here we go.

703
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:33,620
Oh, shit.

704
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,400
I forgot to upgrade.

705
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,240
Oh, my God.

706
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,740
The only reason I had to come back.

707
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,440
I forgot to upgrade.

708
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,260
Oh, I almost forgot.

709
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:44,760
All right.

710
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,580
Trade.

711
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,420
Nice.

712
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,500
How do I upgrade this?

713
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,120
$100,000?

714
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,460
All right.

715
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,780
How much money do I have?

716
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,960
Oh, why?

717
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,840
Did I upgrade the knife?

718
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,340
Why did you guys stop me?

719
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,740
Why did you not stop me?

720
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,280
Okay, we're gonna...

721
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,240
Well, we have, like, so many of these.

722
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,420
Three of a kind.

723
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,180
All right, here you go.

724
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,440
Oh, it's the money or the ticket?

725
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,780
Oh, okay, that's good.

726
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,160
I can just use the ticket.

727
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,600
Okay, tune up.

728
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,980
I can just use the ticket.

729
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
Oh, I almost did the knife.

730
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,820
That would have been so embarrassing.

731
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,300
That would have been so fucking awkward.

732
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,120
Alright, let me sell the hornet and the butterfly lamb.

733
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,180
And then we should be good.

734
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,300
Imagine, though.

735
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,300
And then it turns into a knife only rabbit.

736
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,920
But the amount of money I spent on that fucking knife...

737
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,420
gonna turn into a knife-only run.

738
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,180
Back in it, we go.

739
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,540
Neil, thank you for the super chat.

740
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:06,820
Thank you.

741
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,280
Thank you.

742
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,260
Bugs can't be human-sized because the oxygen density in the
air is too low to support them.

743
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,140
Thank you for the super chat.

744
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,420
Thank you.

745
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,180
Thank you.

746
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,540
You're right.

747
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,320
This is why we have global...

748
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,860
To prevent the size of the bugs from growing bigger.

749
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,080
It's a risk.

750
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:40,240
Either fuck the environment or yeah the environment's fucked
but the bugs are smaller now guys just think about it just

751
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:49,560
just think about it chat yeah we might have fucked over like
we might have fucked over the world but now we don't have to

752
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:59,400
deal with like giant size bugs it's worth it it's worth it
Doki, please.

753
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,800
The priorities.

754
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,620
Alright, we gotta go this way.

755
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,200
Where are the bugs?

756
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,140
I don't like this.

757
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,500
This seems too bug-free.

758
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,860
I don't like how...

759
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,740
Wait, no, this is where I came from.

760
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,200
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

761
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,300
I...

762
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,440
Doki goes the wrong way again.

763
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,500
Yay!

764
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,740
It's this way.

765
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,700
This should be the right way, right?

766
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,620
Which I might be going the same way again.

767
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,480
Or was that the right way?

768
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,000
I can't.

769
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,840
I'm just way too confused.

770
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,580
Oh no no, I've never been here because there's a box.

771
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,320
I know I haven't been here because there's a box there.

772
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,980
I don't like how...

773
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,580
I don't like how bug-free this area is, though.

774
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,100
There we go.

775
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,480
I fucking knew it.

776
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,100
Give me a sec.

777
00:50:59,420 --> 00:50:59,680
Melee!

778
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,280
That's fucking right.

779
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:01,920
Oh, stab!

780
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,620
Nice.

781
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,740
Alright, where's the other bug?

782
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,320
Where's the other bug?

783
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,200
I saw you.

784
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,860
I know you exist.

785
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,040
Oh, shit.

786
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,080
What the fuck?

787
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,140
There you go.

788
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,320
Where the fuck are you?

789
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,080
Where are you?

790
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,020
Closer.

791
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,220
Oh, fuck, but not that close.

792
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,990
Not that close.

793
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:36,930
fuck okay fuck you there we go i know i should like actually
shoot them because that was a waste of my health but like it

794
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:45,470
was worth it look i spent a lot of money upgrading this
knife chat a lot of money was spent on that knife okay we

795
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:54,350
can put this together we just need yellow herbs why is
yellow herbs so fucking hard to find i don't understand it's

796
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:54,970
like yellow

797
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,990
That should already be easy.

798
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:02,950
It's literally yellow.

799
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,230
You're the 1% who upgrades their...

800
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,670
No!

801
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,910
I'm pretty sure there's more people that upgrades their
knives.

802
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,550
Oh, that's a big one.

803
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,530
That took two shots to kill.

804
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:23,590
There's no way.

805
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,010
I can't be.

806
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,470
There has to be speedrunners.

807
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:37,330
Speedrunners can't be the 1% There's no way There's an
entire fucking charity event Dedicated to them It's like at

808
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:53,130

go.

810
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:04,470
Is this the door I opened?

811
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,010
No?

812
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,310
Where the fuck did I open?

813
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:09,870
Where's the gate?

814
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,130
Oh, it's over here.

815
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:14,470
Okay.

816
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,050
This is the gate I opened.

817
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:18,730
Boop.

818
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:20,010
This is what...

819
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:20,890
No, this is...

820
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,570
This is...

821
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,210
Okay.

822
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,310
There's a ladder?

823
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,850
Oh, it's this way.

824
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:31,630
Alright.

825
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,970
No, we're not lost, guys.

826
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:35,930
We're never lost.

827
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,570
We're not lost, guys.

828
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,110
I just need to go up a ladder.

829
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,150
Okay, that's a bug.

830
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,010
I can tell.

831
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,210
I can fucking tell that's a bug.

832
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,230
Key time.

833
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,430
Alright, that should be both games.

834
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,310
Trust the process.

835
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,210
You just have to keep trusting.

836
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,510
Oh, drop down.

837
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:07,710
Drop down.

838
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:09,410
Alright, nice.

839
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,450
More handgun ammo.

840
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,430
That's really good that they dropped this.

841
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,850
It's like modern bug spray.

842
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,030
I'm not shooting the fucking thing again.

843
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,760
Yeah, I just have a gun.

844
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,240
I'm a better version of a knight.

845
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:38,850
Wait, was that it?

846
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,170
Bro, this could have been a text message.

847
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,110
Bro, you could have texted me this.

848
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:54,810
Don't you hate it when people just call you to give you,
like, one sentence of a message?

849
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:57,050
Bro, you're wasting my data.

850
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:00,370
Alright.

851
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,330
What do you mean this part?

852
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,910
Why are you giving me so much ammo?

853
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:16,410
this could have been an email honestly true i hate getting
into like calls for meetings i'm just like can't you just

Where the fuck is the other one?

858
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:47,270
What's that?

859
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,470
That's just yellow ping.

860
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,490
Where is it?

861
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,410
You're gonna hate this?

862
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:55,490
Why do I hate this?

863
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,730
Oh, it's over here.

864
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,150
No, you know what?

865
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:07,270
I actually have unlimited data, but I should, like, use that
excuse.

866
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,530
I can be like, I'm sorry, I have limited data.

867
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,470
I'm trying to save money.

868
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:11,530
I stay as I'm...

869
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,610
That's actually such a good excuse.

870
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,030
Holy shit.

871
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:21,370
Wait.

872
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:25,090
If I want to get out of, like, calls and stuff.

873
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,070
Okay, here we go.

874
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,290
I'm just gonna stay here.

875
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:37,710
I have.

876
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,650
Well, I get, like, ganked.

877
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:40,290
No, right?

878
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,470
Oh, nice.

879
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,850
Crit.

880
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,130
Wait, is that?

881
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:44,910
No.

882
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:48,730
No.

883
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,240
No.

884
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,500
Guys, I fucked up.

885
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,200
Guys, I sort of fucked up.

886
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,380
But I can kill them.

887
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,240
Guys, trust, trust.

888
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,580
I can totally kill them.

889
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,490
Just gotta run.

890
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:16,790
I just gotta run.

891
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:18,250
This is fine.

892
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:22,070
I can totally kill these people.

893
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,410
Fuck!

894
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:25,570
Oh shit!

895
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,310

896
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,010

897
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,490

00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,610
Friendly fire!

900
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,030
Oh shit!

901
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:39,890
This is worth it.

902
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:41,910
This is so worth it.

903
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:42,530
Friendly fire!

904
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,210
Friendly fire!

905
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,250
Okay, this is fine.

906
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,090
This is fine.

907
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,450
This is so fine.

908
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:00,990
This is so fine.

909
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,070
This is so fucking fine.

910
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:04,750
Do not worry.

911
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,350
This is so fine!

912
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,110

Turn around.

919
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,830
I'm just going to kill this lady first.

920
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,070
This lady is annoying.

921
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,070
Friendly fire, friendly fire, friendly fire, friendly fire,
please.

922
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,710
There are so many instances of friendly fire.

923
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,550
How are you still people alive there?

924
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:39,590

00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:45,750

00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,240

He's dead!

947
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:35,760
I did it!

948
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,920
I told you by the power of friendly fire.

949
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,320
I told you.

950
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,280
I told you.

951
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,440
I knew it.

952
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,240
I knew friendly fire was on my side.

953
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,520
I fucking knew it.

954
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:03,920
Nice.

955
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,400
The Doki style.

956
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,900
The Doki style always works.

957
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,520
It might not be the traditional style.

958
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,400
But it always works.

959
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,560
It has a 100% success rate.

960
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,480
Alright, we need to make more shotgun ammo.

961
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,300
Let me see.

962
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,820
Craft shotgun shells.

963
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,400
Okay, nice.

964
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,520
Yeah, I gotta reload.

965
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,580
Wait, there's a bell?

966
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,960
I still don't know where the bell is.

967
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,640
I still don't know where the bell is.

968
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,720
All I know is to run.

969
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,960
That's all I need to know.

970
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,220
I don't need to know where the bell is.

971
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,600
I just need them to kill each other.

972
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,080
All right, here we go.

973
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:51,800
Gunpowder.

01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,410
Oh my god, are they like speed running?

987
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:33,250
Fast traveling?

988
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,150
It's like gotcha upgrades.

989
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,050
You know?

990
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:39,430
They paid a thousand dollars to make sure she level up
faster.

991
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,650
They can't wait the two hours.

992
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,570
Like you want to use this diamond to make her level 12.

993
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,270
Oh my god, no!

994
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:01,970

996
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,480
Oh, this is like the pit.

997
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,240
Man, thank you for the super chat.

998
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:15,980
Thank you, thank you.

999
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:29,170
It seems like very counterintuitive to have like a chain
down there.

1000
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,250
Hang in there, Ashley.

1001
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:37,050
Why the fuck do they have a chain there?

1002
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,820
No, no, no!

1003
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,620
Why is it so dark?

1004
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:49,390
Why can't I just have lights?

1005
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:55,430
Why can't they just light up the pit?

1006
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:57,390
I don't understand.

1007
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:03,070
Oh my god, I hate this.

1008
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:10,100
Ah, fuck, okay.

1009
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,020
Why can't they install lighting in here?

1010
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,980
Who's gonna clean this up?

1011
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:16,960
I was kidding.

1012
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,140
Why is the cave fit not lit up?

1013
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:25,600
I know!

1014
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,580
Does it make sense?

1015
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,860
Talk about sticking the landing.

1016
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:33,960
Pro Leon.

1017
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,120
Time and place, man.

1018
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,800
Who are you telling this to?

1019
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:40,480
Who?

1020
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,300
It's just you and me and you don't even know I exist.

1021
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:46,400
Okay.

1022
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:48,880
There might be stuff here, right?

1023
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,180
Does he have things?

1024
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:51,660
No?

1025
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,260
Why is there like a random indent here?

1026
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,500
Oh my god.

1027
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,040
Not a fucking dork.

1028
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:02,420
This is the one Chris wants to continue to bloodline.

1029
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:04,560
Whoa.

1030
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,940
What the fuck was that?

1031
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,500
What's that?

1032
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,540
What the fuck was that?

1033
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,300
I think I hate most.

1034
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,240
It's just the flashlight.

1035
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,920
It's just so fucking...

1036
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,940
It's still so dark.

1037
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:20,160
Terminator.

1038
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,060
Thank you, the Super Chat.

1039
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:21,980
Thank you, thank you.

1040
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,400
How could this happen to me?

1041
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,420
I made my mistakes.

1042
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:31,080
I don't like this.

1043
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:31,760

Where the fuck are you?

1064
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,240
God.

1065
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,420
What is this?

1066
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:44,020
What is this pathway?

1067
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,340
Great.

1068
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,760
Okay, off we go.

1069
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:55,410
Pay attention to the water?

1070
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:57,750
This fucking sucks.

1071
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:22,300

1073
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:37,330
down.

1074
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,530
God damn it.

1075
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:41,410
Alright.

1076
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:43,530
Oh.

1077
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,750
Can't believe it's trying to train me to look down.

1078
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:49,930
What is this?

1079
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,350
This is not made for gamers.

1080
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,370
Not my game.

1081
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,390
Not my Resident Evil!

1082
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:59,570
There they go.

1083
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,610
I wonder what's over there.

1084
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:01,930
No, I'm not gonna risk it.

1085
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,590
I don't even think that loot's worth.

1086
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:13,890
deal it from here wait okay come on come on come on just
grieve it to me through oh my god i still actually has to go

1087
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:28,810

like fucking coarse fish guys they all the fishes here are

1088
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:40,170
like marinated with bug bug juice and corpses why the fuck
would i ever eat any of the bugs any of the fishes here it's

1089
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:48,490

1090
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:52,790

1091
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:03,350
that fish might have some parasites but that's okay sworn
dead.

1092
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:06,690
How long has it been since I was thrown down there?

1093
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:13,050
The meager scraps of food provided in the beginning are
gone, and they don't give us more.

1094
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:16,810
The pains of hunger and thirst are unbearable.

1095
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,930
Most have resorted to drinking the black water.

1096
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:22,670
The first to turn was Herminio.

1097
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:28,490
He was so weak that he couldn't even walk, but then suddenly
became mad.

1098
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:32,430
By the time his rampage ended, two were dead.

1099
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:35,990
I think we shouldn't drink that dark liquid.

1100
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:41,930
Dear Abelardo has also passed, though he fought until the
very end.

1101
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:47,310
The only thing I can do now is honor the bodies and pray
that their souls find peace.

1102
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:51,310
Oh, Lord, why do you test us so?

1103
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:56,130
If the creators of VeggieTales can get fired, there is no
guide.

1104
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,830
The God is God.

1105
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:07,870
Oh, hey, a craft.

1106
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,360
How do I get that, though?

1107
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,500
Oh, can I just, like, destroy it?

1108
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,140
Kick!

1109
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,720
God, my thighs.

1110
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,440
God, God is dead.

1111
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,680
Oh, finally, some yellow herbs.

1112
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,840
All right, I need to put that here.

1113
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,640

Alright, here you go.

1138
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,420
Near the merchant, there's more loot?

Or you meant that.

1140
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,640
Oh, here, this guy.

1141
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,320
Okay, yellow.

1142
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,580
God damn it.

1143
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,920
Hey, at least I can sell this, though.

1144
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,120
I'll just sell this for now.

1145

Just need the yellow.

1146
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,060
I need the yellow diamond.

Okay, I'm saving anyway.

1148
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,400

01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,880
Yeah, but I can have 2.0.

1150
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,340
There must be another yellow diamond somewhere.

1151
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,340
I'm not settling.

1152
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,300
We're not gonna settle.

1153
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:15,480
Illustration installation of the liquid nitrogen showers
that were requested last month has been completed.

1154
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,200
Liquid nitrogen is an extremely hazardous substance.

1155
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,440
Exposure may cause blindness, frostbite, and even death.

1156
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,500
Handle with care.

1157
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,000
Oh, wait.

1158
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:24,700
That's not good.

1159
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,400
It says maybe, guys.

1160
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:28,540
Maybe.

1161
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't know.

1162
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,580
I like those odds.

1163
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,860
I like those odds.

1164
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,280
I like those odds.

1165
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,740
Maybe it's not guaranteed.

1166
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,060
Okay.

1167
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,440
It's not guarantee.

1168
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,420
It's a maybe.

1169
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:55,740
What's this?

1170
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,280
What does this do?

1171
01:17:59,240 --> 01:17:59,440
Oh!

1172
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,240
Hey, guys.

1173
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,120
I figured out what the may...

1174
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,940
See, I'm okay.

1175
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,880
I told you it was a maybe.

1176
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:26,920
Guys, I told you it was say maybe I'm still okay like see
didn't go blind

1177
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:40,400
me me nine years since my awakening upon release of this
value uh black liquid shall enter my vein and circulate

1178
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:48,440
through my entire body I expect this would be the most
painful experience of my life I await the trial with great

1179
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,160
anticipation.

1180
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,860
It is an honor to suffer through the holy labor of rebirth.

1181
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:59,040
The next time I awaken, it would be as the true servant of
Master Ramon.

1182
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,420
I make this vow.

1183
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:06,540
I'll surpass the limitations of man and become a true
servant of God.

1184
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:12,780
I'll find the heretics and serve as their executioner, their
vertigo.

1185
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,660
Okay, that scared me a little bit.

1186
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,720
I'm not gonna lie, I want to get close behind me.

1187
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,780
Oh, hey, a lot of rifle ammo.

1188
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:21,800
Wow.

1189
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,340
Mm-hmm.

1190
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,300
Is it him?

1191
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,540
Oh, you the guy?

1192
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,490
These people are not right.

1193
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,190
That's not the guy.

1194
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:36,570
Alright.

1195
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:38,870
I don't like this.

1196
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:40,910
Oh!

1197
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,870
I really don't like this.

1198
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,690
I really, really do not like this.

1199
01:19:48,530 --> 01:20:03,480
I don't feel comfortable I don't feel comfortable here It's
way too quiet

1200
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:24,100
Oh I think I know Okay other service To conserve
electricity.

1201
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,440
The power has been turned off for some equipment, including
the elevator.

1202
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:34,100
It can be restored by flipping the circuit breaker located
at the very back of the laboratory.

1203
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,560
Where's that?

1204
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:36,420
Here?

1205
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,100
Oh, it's here.

1206
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,540
Okay.

1207
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,280
I don't like this.

1208
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,740
I don't like this at all.

1209
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,700

Can he die?

1410
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,880
Can I just make him do everything?

1411
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:50,560
Wait, he's like free ammo.

1412
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,160

01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,340
Let me get some ammo real.

1414
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:56,500

1415
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:58,520

1418
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:30,140
okay we're here to send a message to all the other bugs down
there.

1419
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,720
Today was the worst day of my life.

1420
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,620
It's my daughter's fifth birthday.

1421
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,960
But here I am stuck on a mangy boat heading out to some
backcountry dump.

1422
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:45,940
If it weren't for the pay, no one would be willing to work
in the middle of nowhere.

1423
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,980
Those in the, that's true, that is true.

1424
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,460
The pay is really, really good.

1425
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:53,180
I'm like, like, I can work anywhere.

1426
01:36:54,520 --> 01:37:00,160
Those in the castle are always reminding us to take care
during the excavation But a few workers collapsed after

1427
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,260
inhaling some dust.

1428
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,320
Oh no.

1429
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:04,100
Asbestos.

1430
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:04,980
Oh no.

1431
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,040
You're gonna get cancer.

1432
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,480
There's something going on here, but they're not telling us.

1433
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:12,240
There's too many secrets.

1434
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,160
I started coughing too.

1435
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,900
I should sleep.

1436
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,540
Something's really wrong with me.

1437
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:21,600
I threw up blood three more times today.

1438
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:22,980
And I'm so weak.

1439
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:24,480
No, he's getting it.

1440
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:26,280
He's got the abestos.

1441
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:28,020

Everything for you, Lord Sadler.

1447
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,260

Oh, it's the prize of stuff.

01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,540

On the riot gun.

1467
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,380
Okay, and then...

1468
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,820
I think we can...

1469
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:43,040
We need to start to slowly upgrade...

1470
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:46,420
Oh, it's okay.

1471
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,920
I still did it.

1472
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,540
I might have accidentally got the guns confused, but it's
okay.

1473
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,280
It still works.

1474
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,120
Okay, I guess I'll...

1475
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:58,020
I feel like I use the shotgun more, so I'm going to...

1476
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:11,340

Stop watching!

1483
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:13,180
Stop!

1484
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,500
Oh, I didn't shoot the TNT?

1485
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,260
That makes a lot more sense now.

1486
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,220
That actually...

1487
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:32,640
That actually makes a lot of sense.

1488
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:33,620
Guys.

1489
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:37,340
I don't know why I didn't think of that.

1490
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,760
I was like, wait a minute.

1491
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:43,640
Why?

1492
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:46,680
Why is it that difficult?

1493
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:48,820
What do you mean?

1494
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:50,680
He fucking...

1495
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,580
Are you serious?

1496
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,180
Gamer of the Year, by the way.

1497
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,200
Oh, if it's...

1498
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,520
Oh, it does like...

1499
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:02,980
Oh!

1500
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:04,920
I...

1501
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,140
Oh.

1502
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:05,880
Okay.

1503
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,660
I didn't realize that's how they were going to line up.

1504
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:11,160
That's actually it.

1505
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,640
I didn't know this gun had, like, go through people.

1506
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:17,040
There we go.

1507
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:17,560
Nice.

1508
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:19,060
That's good enough.

1509
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:20,520
We don't need to do any more.

1510
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,580
You know, that's fine.

1511
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,380
We got three.

1512
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:26,740
That's all we need.

1513
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:30,180
All right, what is it?

1514
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,060
Oh, that's a gray.

1515
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,100
20.

1516
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,600
Oh, that's a gray.

1517
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:35,200
God.

1518
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,080
Damn it.

1519
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:38,680
Look, it's because the homie was watching me.

1520
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:39,720
I got nervous.

1521
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:40,920
Chat.

1522
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,200
Don't you get nervous when the homie watches?

1523
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,160
Yes.

1524
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,840
The homie was watching.

1525
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,000
Of course I got a little nervous.

1526
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:56,640
Where the fuck is the... Wait, was there no, like, keyboard?

1527
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:57,540
I'm not keyboard, sorry.

1528
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,100
Oh, type.

1529
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:00,600
Is there no typewriter?

1530
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,440
Yeah, I got Dormant's anxiety.

1531
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:12,420
Hard for me to put my faith in someone who used to work for
Umbrella.

1532
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:13,420
I

1533
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:18,860
don't need to worry about them.

1534
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,040
Yeah, they went bankrupt.

1535
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:20,800
That's fine.

1536
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,680
What are you after?

1537
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,440
I just want to feel good about myself.

1538
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,100
Keyboard of the past.

1539
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:30,560
Prehistoric keyboard.

1540
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:33,500
See.

1541
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:35,800
I think I'll go here, right?

1542
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:36,720
Subobjective.

1543
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:37,400
So I can...

1544
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:37,790
I'm gonna go...

1545
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,240
Go the right side for now.

1546
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:40,620
Oh, yeah.

1547
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:41,380
What?

1548
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:43,580
What's this?

1549
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,640
Oh, I have to go to the right.

1550
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,140
It's a TNT.

1551
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,300
The diamond has been relocated.

1552
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,240
When using explosives, cave-ins are a frequent occurrence.

1553
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:57,080
Keep your distance from the blast zone.

1554
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:59,660
In the event of a disaster, clean up immediately.

1555
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:02,320
Ensure adequate numbers of staff are on site.

1556
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:02,960
Don't worry.

1557
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,680
I'll definitely clean it up.

1558
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:07,220
She didn't clean it up.

1559
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,600
Alright.

1560
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:13,040
Where the fuck are the...

1561
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,040
Where the fuck are the cult people?

1562
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:16,880
Shoot them.

1563
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:18,240
Oh, it's the villagers!

1564
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:24,480
I mean, why am I scared of?

1565
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,180
I have my boy!

1566
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:29,880
Okay, that is bullshit.

1567
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:31,980
My boy is here.

1568
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,100
Where is... I'm gonna shoot his leg.

1569
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:33,380
Oh.

1570
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:34,860
Alright.

1571
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,560
Got his knees, and then...

1572
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:38,140
There you go.

1573
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:39,800
That's how I do the headshot there.

1574
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:44,790
How do I get out of here?

1575
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:47,150
Oh, vault.

1576
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:48,450
There we go.

1577
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:48,890
Nice.

1578
01:44:49,570 --> 01:44:50,350
It's fine.

1579
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:53,230
We have the homies to help me out.

1580
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,350
See?

1581
01:44:54,610 --> 01:44:55,630
Is that a chainsaw?

1582
01:44:56,410 --> 01:44:57,570
It's not a chainsaw, right?

1583
01:44:59,150 --> 01:45:00,310
It's not it, right?

1584
01:45:01,230 --> 01:45:02,070
There we go.

1585
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:02,890
Did I hurt him?

1586
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:04,310
Okay.

1587
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:06,690
Oh, I didn't realize that didn't cross over.

1588
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:08,170
That is my...

1589
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:09,050
Oh, shit!

1590
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:10,010
That's chainsaw, man!

1591
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:13,250
Oh, shit!

1592
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:14,630
Believe me, I know.

1593
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:16,290
It's okay, that's when you're here.

1594
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:16,870
Oh!

1595
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:22,850
This is what...

1596
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:23,870
That was my kick!

1597
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:26,810
I can't believe it.

1598
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:29,730
Oh, shit.

1599
01:45:30,110 --> 01:45:30,790
Oh, shit.

1600
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:31,650
Okay, I'm fine.

1601
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:32,630
I'm fine.

1602
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:36,410
We're fine.

1603
01:45:39,010 --> 01:45:39,270
This is good.

1604
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:39,910
This is good.

1605
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:41,510
Shoot him!

1606
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,120
What the fuck?

1607
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:46,500
It's okay.

1608
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,920
Snap, snap, snap, snap.

1609
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,480
I upgraded my knife.

1610
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:53,780
Step, step, step, step, step.

1611
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:54,580
There you go.

1612
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:55,240
All right.

1613
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:56,840
It's fine.

1614
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:57,680
I upgraded my knife.

1615
01:45:57,780 --> 01:45:58,540
I can do that now.

1616
01:45:59,340 --> 01:45:59,720
Okay.

1617
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:01,180
Homie!

1618
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,520
You're supposed to help!

1619
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:05,780
Bro!

1620
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:07,220
Oh, shit.

1621
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:07,880
Okay, stab.

1622
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:09,060
Stop.

1623
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:11,320
Hey.

1624
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:11,980
Nice.

1625
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:14,180
Wait, you're still shooting somebody?

1626
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,060
You know, bro, it's fine.

1627
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:16,880
Oh!

1628
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:21,400
It was not fine.

1629
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:31,320
In the end, it was apparently not fine.

1630
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:36,080
Okay, I have my legs for this.

1631
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:37,360
Are they all dead?

1632
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:38,940
They must be all dead, right?

1633
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,100
Then I killed everybody.

1634
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:44,400
Yeah, see, I told you.

1635
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,400
It's so easy.

1636
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:48,100
Just kill everybody.

1637
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:49,700
Heavy grenade.

1638
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,160
Is it heavy grenade?

1639
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,300
Oh, fuck.

1640
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,360
Wait, that's... Okay.

1641
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:56,780
This is what this is for.

1642
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:59,400
Alright, is he gonna drop down?

1643
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:04,570
What's a woman, chain solid, man?

1644
01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:07,890
Alright.

1645
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:09,990
There we go.

1646
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:11,330
It's okay.

1647
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:12,190
She can't see.

1648
01:47:12,650 --> 01:47:14,250
She has a bag on top of her.

1649
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,270
That's fucking right.

1650
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:19,610
Take off that bag!

1651
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:21,490
You would have known I was here!

1652
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:27,310
If she took off that bag, she could have known.

1653
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:29,890
It was not very efficient.

1654
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:35,810
She wasn't a very efficient chainsaw woman.

1655
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:37,250
Man.

1656
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:39,290
Alright, nice.

1657
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:40,790
We got some ammo.

1658
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:43,630
And then we open the door.

1659
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:45,290
Wherever that is.

1660
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:47,070
That's the bridge.

1661
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:49,550
And then we...

1662
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:51,830
Steal their loot.

1663
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:52,870
Oh, what?

1664
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:53,250
Where?

1665
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:53,950
Where?

1666
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:56,130
Where?

1667
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,390
It's okay, he's got this.

1668
01:47:57,470 --> 01:47:58,570
I'm just gonna open the door.

1669
01:47:59,730 --> 01:47:59,870
Don't worry.

1670
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:00,890
What the fuck?

1671
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:02,530
Why is he aggro to me?

1672
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:06,790
What the fuck?

1673
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:08,410
Why is he aggro to me?

1674
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:11,270
There he is.

1675
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:11,810
Shoot him.

1676
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:12,510
You can do this.

1677
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:13,390
I believe in you.

1678
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:15,450
This is bullshit.

1679
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:17,690
Bro, shoot!

1680
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:22,630
Bro, what the fuck?

1681
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,140
Bro, I could have knifed him.

1682
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,080
At least he's more...

1683
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,680
He is more useful than Ashley, though.

1684
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:37,600
I have to admit.

1685
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,620
Like, if only they could just give Ashley a gun.

1686
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:42,020
Like, that's all Ashley needs.

1687
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:44,160
She just needs a fucking gun.

1688
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,640
The world will be easier if they gave a child a gun.

1689
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,780
In-game, by the way.

1690
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:17,540
all right nice all right all right we're just gonna get rid
of this guy all right he's dead nice don't p.s don't ever do

1691
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:25,180
that i said in game i am absolved of any legal matters by
saying that

1692
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:31,600
All right, we gotta go this way.

1693
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,780
Gotta go this way.

1694
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,420
Okay, there's a chest over here, though.

1695
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:42,900
Yay!

1696
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:43,640
Ooh!

1697
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:46,060
Golden hourglass.

1698
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:46,720
Nice.

1699
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:48,120
That works.

1700
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:51,960
Your Honor, she said- Oh, shit!

1701
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,520
Okay, look at that reflex, though.

1702
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,820
Oh, my- look at that flick, though!

1703
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,680
That's when you know I'm gaming.

1704
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:04,280
That's when you know.

1705
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,620
That was an insane flick.

1706
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:11,760
That was a headshot flick too.

1707
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,520
The gamer aim.

1708
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,440
Wait, how do I get to the other side?

1709
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:21,380
Wait a minute.

1710
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:24,680
Wait a minute.

1711
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,820
Do I go from above?

1712
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,600
Yeah, fear makes me aim better.

1713
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:33,720
Oh, I can.

1714
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:34,080
Okay.

1715
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:35,300
Oh, I think I can.

1716
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,180
Yeah, I can just drop down.

1717
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:40,060
Drop down.

1718
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:41,340
Yay!

1719
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:43,600
Here I go.

1720
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:45,700
Here I go.

1721
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,800

Yes.

1725
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,600
It's nice that they marked the stone for me.

1726
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:59,140

1855
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:12,420
Jesus Christ.

Get off the fucking ramp!

1865
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,880
Wait, what if I just run him over?

1866
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:40,680
Can I just run this man over?

1867
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:42,660
Like, why was I so scared?

1868
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,640
Why the fuck was I so scared of him?

1869
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,720
My card is...

1870
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,520
There we go.

1871
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,240
My card must have been stronger than this.

1872
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:53,100
Like...

1873
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,500
There's no way.

1874
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:57,740
Yay!

1875
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:01,100
Probably would have grabbed the cart.

1876
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:04,200
Bro, this cart is going, like, at least...

1877
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,660
Okay, one mile per hour.

1878
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:06,740
It's not that bad.

1879
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:09,560
It's not that fast, but, like, it should be fast enough.

1880
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:13,500
It should have been fast enough.

1881
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,080
Oh, that was easy.

1882
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:21,000
Put the phone down and drive.

1883
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,000
Great knots.

1884
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:24,360

1886
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:29,440

02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:52,260

1901
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:36,760
Fucking knew it.

1902
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:38,200
I could always hear the loot.

1903
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:40,340
Okay, shotgun.

1904
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:43,640

02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:47,860

He's the moral support.

1922
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:02,100
He's just takes cover.

1923
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:05,860

02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:25,280
Lewis, Lewis, you shoot.

1930
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:26,460
You shoot.

1931
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:28,900
Ha ha!

1932
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,100
What the fuck?

1933
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:31,760
What's that?

1934
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,660
Okay, nothing was going to come behind me.

1935
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:34,140
That's good.

1936
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,360
That's all I need to know.

1937
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:37,540
That's all I need to know.

1938
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,640
I need to...

1939
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:38,680
Jesus.

1940
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:42,840
Like, how?

1941
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:46,940
Oh, shit, reloading.

1942
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:50,480
Alright, it's fine.

1943
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:51,920
Like, does he die?

1944
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:53,560
Can I kill him?

1945
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:56,820
Hello.

1946
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:57,540
Hello.

1947
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:00,980
Oh, shit.

1948
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:03,180
Okay, he does die.

1949
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:04,200
Thank God.

1950
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:06,980
Please, I'm reloading.

1951
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:09,500
Alright, we're fine.

1952
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:11,020
Oh, shit!

1953
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:11,760
I don't know!

1954
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,180
You have a gun, too!

1955
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,700
I just don't understand!

1956
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:20,520
Why is he saving ammo?

1957
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:22,040
Hello.

1958
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,040

1959
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:27,440
Alright.

what's that break.

1965
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:06,060
Lewis, you have one job, apparently.

1966
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:06,940
Lewis!

1967
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,340
You fucked up your one job!

1968
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:13,900
Lewis!

1969
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:19,460
That was literally the only thing you have to do!

1970
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:26,660
I just did 99% of that work.

1971
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:29,640
The cards.

1972
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:33,500
Give us a three to one next time, hey, Sancho?

1973
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:34,920
Get pussy.

1974
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:36,400
Jesus Christ.

Is there more?

2009
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:47,730
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

2010
02:08:47,830 --> 02:08:48,990
He's like crawling now.

2011
02:08:49,670 --> 02:08:50,190
Get out of here.

2012
02:08:53,130 --> 02:08:53,550
Nice.

2013
02:08:53,690 --> 02:08:53,870
Alright.

2014
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:55,650
I need a fucking...

2015
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:57,570
Okay, I actually have to use my gun now.

2016
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:01,610
I'm running out of like...

2017
02:09:02,210 --> 02:09:04,430
I'm running out of knife juice.

2018
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:08,530
There's almost no more knife juice, guys.

2019
02:09:11,670 --> 02:09:13,370
Alright, we need to refuel our knife.

2020
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:17,040
Okay, let's see this way.

2021
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:21,050
Destroy the hive.

2022
02:09:21,110 --> 02:09:22,710
Where's the hive holes?

2023
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:26,830
I don't even know what it's supposed to look like.

2024
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:28,030
Is it that this?

2025
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:30,950
Oh, that's the hive.

2026
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:32,550
Oh, it's yellow.

2027
02:09:32,710 --> 02:09:33,610
The journalist yellow.

2028
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:45,830
figured it out guys it's the journalist yellow again it's
always the journalist yellow all right we figured out what

2029
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:55,870
it is okay i'm gonna explode this because all right there
you go all right we figured it out my shoulder's hurting

2030
02:09:55,870 --> 02:10:01,490
apparently uh the reason lewis didn't shoot is because
you're actually using his gun he didn't notice a swap

2031
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:06,330
because you're also using the Oh, shit, Nuts!

2032
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:17,610
I can't believe Lewis is... Why does he get... Yeah, he's an
average guy, but yet he gets unlimited ammo?

2033
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:19,550
That's so fucked up.

2034
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:22,510
Okay, I thought that was a natural bug.

2035
02:10:23,290 --> 02:10:24,290
That's not fair.

2036
02:10:24,990 --> 02:10:28,130
Why does the average guy get unlimited ammo?

2037
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:33,890
He can't be average if his gun is unlimited.

2038
02:10:34,610 --> 02:10:35,050
Chaonix.

2039
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:36,170
No, thank you for the super chat.

2040
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:36,510
Thank you.

2041
02:10:36,770 --> 02:10:37,090
Thank you.

2042
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:39,830
Alright, let's see.

2043
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:46,150
Oh, there's the last one.

2044
02:10:48,030 --> 02:10:48,310
Nice.

2045
02:10:48,510 --> 02:10:48,910
We did it.

2046
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:50,290
We destroyed the hive holes.

2047
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:53,350
Oh, the holes are gone.

2048
02:10:54,570 --> 02:10:56,510
Plug the... It's like popping a pimple.

2049
02:10:58,630 --> 02:11:00,830
You know, I'm just... I can't be bothered to kick.

2050
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:04,430
I have to...

2051
02:11:04,450 --> 02:11:05,310
too much ammo.

2052
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:09,770
All right, let's see.

2053
02:11:10,890 --> 02:11:12,190
Where does this way go then?

2054
02:11:13,270 --> 02:11:14,830
Wait, this is where I'm supposed to go.

2055
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:19,470
All right, let's see.

2056
02:11:20,710 --> 02:11:21,370
Yay, money!

2057
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:22,970
Just in case.

2058
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:24,390
Yeah, fucking knew it.

2059
02:11:25,630 --> 02:11:29,450
I was like, why is there a suspiciously placed...

2060
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:31,830
Uh...

2061
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:33,270
Suppliciously placed...

2062
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:33,850
What are they called?

2063
02:11:33,950 --> 02:11:35,370
Gas canister here.

2064
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:36,530
Hmm.

2065
02:11:39,170 --> 02:11:40,310
Alright, lights.

2066
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:43,070
Where are they?

2067
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:45,090
Where are the bugs?

2068
02:11:46,510 --> 02:11:47,730
You're a real rock.

2069
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:50,290
I don't know, man.

2070
02:11:53,910 --> 02:11:56,070
Is that actually a real rock?

2071
02:11:56,490 --> 02:11:57,630
Oh my god, it was.

2072
02:11:57,690 --> 02:11:58,830
It was a real rock.

2073
02:11:59,450 --> 02:12:01,710
It was a real rock.

2074
02:12:03,870 --> 02:12:04,390
I can't.

2075
02:12:04,410 --> 02:12:05,850
I'm super paranoid now.

2076
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:10,510
I can't believe it was real.

2077
02:12:12,010 --> 02:12:14,430
I can't believe it was real this entire time.

2078
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:15,810
Alright, get out.

2079
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:19,070
There's more?

2080
02:12:19,590 --> 02:12:21,490
Okay, I definitely don't need loot here.

2081
02:12:22,330 --> 02:12:22,930
Oh, shit!

2082
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:25,390
Get down.

2083
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:27,590
Any more?

2084
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:29,490
No?

2085
02:12:29,710 --> 02:12:30,070
Alright.

2086
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:31,930
Nice.

2087
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:37,930
Try to make sure there's none that's gonna fucking surprise
me.

2088
02:12:40,270 --> 02:12:40,730
What?

2089
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:42,150
Where did you come from?

2090
02:12:42,250 --> 02:12:42,910
Oh shit!

2091
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:44,950
That's where you came from.

2092
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:46,790
I was like, what?

2093
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:48,170
What does that sound?

2094
02:12:50,830 --> 02:12:51,590
Any more?

2095
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:52,810
Any more bugs?

2096
02:12:54,330 --> 02:12:55,930
Okay, I got all the hives.

2097
02:12:56,730 --> 02:12:58,210
Alright, up we go.

2098
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:02,000
It's time to go up.

2099
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:09,940
Bro, you fancy.

2100
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:11,700
I'm beat.

2101
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:14,660
Makes you appreciate tech like this.

2102
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:16,680
I don't get you.

2103
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:19,460
Why risk your life like this?

2104
02:13:20,140 --> 02:13:20,700
Upies.

2105
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,520
You don't know us.

2106
02:13:22,420 --> 02:13:23,460
I told you.

2107
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:25,400
It makes me...

2108
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:26,280
Pass the merchant?

2109
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:28,260
Be straight with me for once.

2110
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:30,060
Los Illuminados.

2111
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:33,520
I was working for now.

2112
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:34,580
See?

2113
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:35,680
There was a horn?

2114
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:36,820
Helping the...

2115
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:38,520
of you doesn't make up for it.

2116
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:39,620
I know that.

2117
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:43,900
But still, I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

2118
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:48,160
In that case, you better get serious.

2119
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:51,940
Harsh words for a swire.

2120
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:56,560
I can't believe it.

2121
02:13:56,860 --> 02:14:01,060
I can't believe I missed out on the merchant.

2122
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,080
.

2123
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:13,360

run around and then nothing happens

2137
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:25,930
We fight with the kitchen knife

2138

Right here.

2150
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:31,740
I can understand.

2151
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:33,620
What happened was?

2152
02:16:34,100 --> 02:16:34,300
Oh.

2153
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:34,900
Unforgivable.

2154
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:38,720
But that doesn't give you the right to hurt innocent people.

2155
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:39,220
Nice.

2156
02:16:40,340 --> 02:16:40,940
Nice.

02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:49,180
Come on, I'm trying to take you to the edge.

2158
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:52,180

2159
02:16:53,420 --> 02:16:54,040
Yes, yeah.

2160
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:54,780

You mean I could shot my gun this entire time?

2168
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:18,150
No, play, Rookie.

2169
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:21,030
You haven't changed a damn...

2170
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:30,690
Bro, bro, bro, his thighs are thicker than mine's.

2171
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:41,030
Bro, why didn't you warn me that knives weren't for bugs?

2172
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:50,430
Bro, it's not the ladies that are gonna be at loss.

2173
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:57,610
and remove those damn parasites.

2174
02:17:57,870 --> 02:18:00,210

2181
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:40,940

Actually, no.

2243
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:04,920
Two of the reds.

2244
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:07,000
Actually, one of the reds?

2245
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:09,880
I'll do two of the reds.

2246
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:10,640
reds.

2247
02:24:12,220 --> 02:24:13,400
Do I do the reds?

2248
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:13,760
No.

2249
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:16,120
I think I can do... I don't know.

2250
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:20,200
I feel like I can put, like, all of the kind of... Alright,
let's plug it.

2251
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:21,160

Alright, I'll sell this, and then I'll sell...

Does it look like I have... I've seen some chickens here?

2255
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:34,700
What I think does it... I don't think there's any chickens
near me.

2256
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:37,560
Okay, we don't need the submachine gun ammo.

2257
02:24:37,880 --> 02:24:40,420
We don't need the bolts.

2258
02:24:41,060 --> 02:24:42,680
And I think that's everything?

2259
02:24:44,060 --> 02:24:45,900
Oh my god, I have nine of these.

2260
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:47,160

02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:52,000
One day I'll use it.

2263
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:54,940

I feel like I'm gonna up the power.

2269
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:18,300
Whenever we get to a boss fight, this would be useful.

2270
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:20,320
Don't get yourself killed now.

02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:36,000
It's all the way over here?

2277
02:25:39,140 --> 02:25:40,100
Block treasure.

2278

They don't know how to fall down.

2598
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:42,980
Reload.

03:00:49,250 --> 03:00:53,310
Guys, we have to accept our mistakes, chat.

2801
03:00:53,790 --> 03:00:56,990
We can't just reload it whenever we want.

2802
03:00:57,230 --> 03:00:57,710
It's not.

2803
03:00:58,130 --> 03:01:01,310
We can't just boulders gate this.

2804
03:01:13,490 --> 03:01:16,170
I can't believe I missed.

2805
03:01:16,930 --> 03:01:18,210
I can't believe it.

2806
03:01:19,390 --> 03:01:21,710
I can't believe I fucking missed.

2807
03:01:25,990 --> 03:01:28,410
Oh my god.

2808
03:01:28,790 --> 03:01:29,830
I can't believe.

2809
03:01:30,770 --> 03:01:32,690
I fucking missed the egg.

2810
03:01:33,110 --> 03:01:33,670

2811
03:01:34,070 --> 03:01:35,490

All right, let's see.

2820
03:02:41,610 --> 03:02:44,290
We gotta figure this out now.

2821
03:02:46,370 --> 03:02:46,810
Okay.

2822
03:02:49,790 --> 03:02:51,630
Okay, we're gonna put this here.

2823
03:02:52,370 --> 03:02:54,370
And then here we go.

2824
03:02:54,590 --> 03:02:55,150
All right, nice.

2825
03:02:55,750 --> 03:02:57,050
We have another kitchen knife.

2826
03:03:00,210 --> 03:03:03,790
Wait, no, no, the contract is watching the stream, chat.

2827
03:03:05,510 --> 03:03:07,050
That's the contract.

2828
03:03:07,770 --> 03:03:08,870
That's the contract.

2829
03:03:09,330 --> 03:03:11,430
By being here, you've signed.

2830
03:03:15,230 --> 03:03:15,830
Okay.

2831
03:03:17,030 --> 03:03:17,750
Let's see.

2832
03:03:19,590 --> 03:03:20,430
We're fine.

2833
03:03:20,530 --> 03:03:20,910
It's fine.

2834
03:03:21,030 --> 03:03:21,690
We killed him.

2835
03:03:21,810 --> 03:03:22,670
We killed him.

2836
03:03:27,090 --> 03:03:28,010
We killed him.

2837
03:03:28,250 --> 03:03:31,750
Lord Corrosus, hit the target five feet away from you.

2838
03:03:31,870 --> 03:03:32,890
Instructions unclear.

2839
03:03:33,310 --> 03:03:33,690
Mistake.

2840
03:03:33,990 --> 03:03:35,330
You guys could have told me.

2841
03:03:35,510 --> 03:03:36,630
To get closer.

2842
03:03:38,350 --> 03:03:39,830
I didn't know it was 5 feet.

2843
03:03:40,370 --> 03:03:42,070
I was 6 feet away.

2844
03:03:42,330 --> 03:03:42,610
Chat.

2845
03:03:43,150 --> 03:03:44,310
You guys should have said 5 feet.

2846
03:03:44,390 --> 03:03:46,670
I would have walked them up a little bit.

2847
03:03:48,050 --> 03:03:48,750
And that is why.

2848
03:03:48,810 --> 03:03:49,990
This is a group mistake.

2849
03:03:50,810 --> 03:03:52,970
I was lacking information.

2850
03:03:53,490 --> 03:03:55,150
To walk closer up.

2851
03:03:55,710 --> 03:03:57,830
To get closer.

2852
03:03:58,270 --> 03:03:59,910
And because of that.

2853
03:04:02,390 --> 03:04:03,670
No, no, no.

2854
03:04:04,190 --> 03:04:05,430
If you told me it was.

2855
03:04:05,510 --> 03:04:08,510
Within five feet, I would have walked closer.

2856
03:04:08,890 --> 03:04:10,350
I was within six feet.

2857
03:04:10,410 --> 03:04:11,450
I was six feet away.

2858
03:04:12,270 --> 03:04:13,490
I was six feet away, chat.

2859
03:04:15,110 --> 03:04:18,930
I did not count for the wind, the wind, you know.

2860
03:04:19,310 --> 03:04:21,470
I also did not account for the wind.

2861
03:04:22,030 --> 03:04:27,150
So, like, how was I supposed to know the wind was going to
change the trajectory of my egg?

2862
03:04:28,530 --> 03:04:31,370
And then there's the weight of the golden egg as well.

2863
03:04:31,610 --> 03:04:34,970
You know, golden egg is heavier than a normal egg.

2864
03:04:36,770 --> 03:04:47,010
and the boss should have been painted yellow I have failed
you my lord I was unable to fulfill your final commandment

2865
03:04:47,010 --> 03:04:53,850
and keep the boy from the path of wickedness I caught a
glimpse of master Ramon's evil temperament during his

2866
03:04:53,850 --> 03:05:01,610
younger years when he discovered a servant mocked him by
othering othering whatever the fuck this is behind his back

2867
03:05:01,610 --> 03:05:06,610
he summoned her to his private kneel before him.

2868
03:05:06,950 --> 03:05:11,550
Ramon dosed her face with viral overt vitriol he pulled out
of his pocket.

2869
03:05:12,090 --> 03:05:20,210
The young master watched with glee when the servant writhed
in agony as the skin melted from her face.

2870
03:05:20,970 --> 03:05:24,910
His twisted grim still haunts my dreams this very day.

2871
03:05:25,370 --> 03:05:32,530
As time passed, Ramon's treachery only deepened and the
infernal cult soon learned they could prey upon his

2872
03:05:32,530 --> 03:05:33,370
vulnerable heart.

2873
03:05:35,510 --> 03:05:39,830
They manipulated Master Ramon and turned him into their
puppet.

2874
03:05:40,610 --> 03:05:48,950
Worst of all, they managed to use him to unleash the Las
Plagas that the Salazar family has fought so long and hard

2875
03:05:48,950 --> 03:05:50,190
to keep sealed away.

2876
03:05:50,730 --> 03:05:57,210
Lord Diego, rest assured, I intend to watch over Ramon's
until the Master Ramon, until the very end.

2877
03:05:57,710 --> 03:06:05,490
Whatever fate may befall us, as a faithful servant of the
Salazar family since birth, is my duty and my power.

2878
03:06:05,510 --> 03:06:06,870
penance to you.

2879
03:06:07,150 --> 03:06:07,230
All right.

2880
03:06:07,410 --> 03:06:09,070
Pretty sure that housekeeper is dead.

2881
03:06:09,870 --> 03:06:10,010
All right.

2882
03:06:10,170 --> 03:06:10,990
Thank you for the super chat.

2883
03:06:11,190 --> 03:06:11,390
Thank you.

2884
03:06:11,590 --> 03:06:11,910
Thank you.

2885
03:06:12,250 --> 03:06:14,710
Sounds like grade S copium.

2886
03:06:15,110 --> 03:06:24,950
Look, it is not my fault that the that the fucking gold egg
is heavier than a normal egg, chat.

2887
03:06:25,110 --> 03:06:26,310
That is not my fault.

2888
03:06:26,510 --> 03:06:35,050
How was I supposed to know that the gold egg was heavier and
thus changes the grip of my egg?

2889
03:06:35,330 --> 03:06:41,170
So Like I ended up throwing it too, too, I ended up throwing
it too light.

2890
03:06:41,730 --> 03:06:47,090
I didn't compensate my strength to throw a golden egg.

2891
03:06:51,830 --> 03:06:53,490
I didn't account.

2892
03:06:53,790 --> 03:06:57,290
I didn't figure out, I couldn't figure out the math in my
head.

2893
03:06:58,070 --> 03:07:00,470
I used like normal egg in my head.

2894
03:07:04,670 --> 03:07:05,490
He's dead.

2895
03:07:06,670 --> 03:07:07,730
He's dead!

2896
03:07:10,150 --> 03:07:14,230
Yeah, I'm looking for the key.

2897
03:07:19,690 --> 03:07:21,090
Yeah, I did it.

2898
03:07:22,610 --> 03:07:24,410
I think this has to be my worst thing.

2899
03:07:26,370 --> 03:07:29,090
10% of that was from the egg throw.

2900
03:07:32,030 --> 03:07:33,610
That's where the egg was.

2901
03:07:36,470 --> 03:07:37,670
Alright, nice.

2902
03:07:53,930 --> 03:07:54,610
One end.

2903
03:07:54,730 --> 03:07:55,550
Thank you for the super chat.

2904
03:07:55,650 --> 03:07:56,310
Thank you.

2905
03:07:56,390 --> 03:07:56,390
Thank you.

2906
03:07:56,390 --> 03:07:59,190
We're not responsible for final calculations of the
employer.

2907
03:07:59,510 --> 03:08:00,930
Only the first estimate.

2908
03:08:01,410 --> 03:08:02,310
Thank you for the super chat.

2909
03:08:02,330 --> 03:08:02,950
Thank you.

2910
03:08:02,950 --> 03:08:03,730
Thank you.

2911
03:08:03,730 --> 03:08:05,130
But I don't think I'll get a straight answer.

2912
03:08:09,930 --> 03:08:10,990
Yeah, she doesn't care about you.

2913
03:08:11,190 --> 03:08:12,710
She's only here for the money.

2914
03:08:13,970 --> 03:08:17,090
You know, after the incident, the world changed.

2915
03:08:18,630 --> 03:08:20,290
Maybe you used word grenades.

2916
03:08:20,410 --> 03:08:24,150
You would have more experience with the weight of a metal
agent.

2917
03:08:28,250 --> 03:08:36,990
object you haven't changed you just think you have so

2918
03:08:42,960 --> 03:08:50,440
here's my question Chris thank you for the super chatting
thank you you'll never be able to punch rocks with a wimpy

2919
03:08:50,440 --> 03:09:01,380
throwing arm like that what do you think this is why I don't
punch rocks I kick them we're here not see those thighs If I

2920
03:09:01,380 --> 03:09:04,000
could have kicked the egg, I would have made it.

2921
03:09:04,680 --> 03:09:05,800
She called me handsome.

2922
03:09:07,280 --> 03:09:09,600
Oh my god, new girlfriend right there.

2923
03:09:13,140 --> 03:09:14,280
Story of my life.

2924
03:09:15,520 --> 03:09:17,660
Guys, it's because I didn't kick the egg.

2925
03:09:18,480 --> 03:09:19,380
That was my problem.

2926
03:09:19,940 --> 03:09:22,940
If I could have kicked the egg, I would have hit it.

2927
03:09:23,880 --> 03:09:25,860
I would have hit the target.

2928
03:09:31,560 --> 03:09:36,120

03:09:41,140 --> 03:09:42,880

2934
03:10:15,480 --> 03:10:16,220
Alright, nice.

2935
03:10:16,580 --> 03:10:17,580
Well, I got this guy out.

2936
03:10:20,780 --> 03:10:22,320
I knew I should have had a second...

2937
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:23,740
I knew I should have had a third egg.

2938
03:10:24,360 --> 03:10:24,740
I knew...

2939
03:10:27,800 --> 03:10:30,340
I fucking knew I needed a third egg.

2940
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:31,820
I knew it.

2941
03:10:32,180 --> 03:10:35,540
You guys were like, no, you just need one egg.

2942
03:10:35,660 --> 03:10:36,860
And I was like, no way.

2943
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:38,200
Can I, like, just destroy it?

2944
03:10:38,480 --> 03:10:39,500
I can't shoot it!

2945
03:10:41,180 --> 03:10:42,520
How the fuck do I get out?

2946
03:10:42,720 --> 03:10:44,380
How the fuck do I not die from this?

2947
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:48,780
I just have to walk the other way.

2948
03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:50,880
I can't believe it.

2949
03:10:50,900 --> 03:10:52,340
I can't just shoot things.

2950
03:10:53,740 --> 03:10:55,280
This is so fucked up.

2951
03:10:57,380 --> 03:10:58,620
This is so fucked up.

2952
03:10:58,680 --> 03:10:59,760
I can't just shoot it.

2953
03:11:05,080 --> 03:11:08,180
What's the point if I can't just shoot it?

2954
03:11:12,590 --> 03:11:13,590
Oh, it's a merchant!

2955
03:11:15,970 --> 03:11:17,550
Alright, is there anything else?

2956
03:11:17,650 --> 03:11:20,170
Oh, I need that, actually.

2957
03:11:20,990 --> 03:11:22,190
Good thing I saved up.

2958
03:11:23,330 --> 03:11:25,250
That's good I saved up there.

2959
03:11:26,950 --> 03:11:27,510
Okay, anything new?

2960
03:11:27,650 --> 03:11:28,150
The killer.

2961
03:11:29,090 --> 03:11:31,370
My pistol is still the best pistol, right?

2962
03:11:33,390 --> 03:11:33,910
64.

2963
03:11:34,350 --> 03:11:35,970
Okay, we need the case.

2964
03:11:37,190 --> 03:11:37,710
And...

2965
03:11:37,710 --> 03:11:38,870
Yeah, I think that's all we need.

2966
03:11:40,590 --> 03:11:41,370
Let's see.

2967
03:11:42,030 --> 03:11:42,550
Okay.

2968
03:11:42,590 --> 03:11:43,950
Killer 7's the Magnum?

2969
03:11:44,230 --> 03:11:45,450
Okay, I can't afford it, though.

2970
03:11:46,410 --> 03:11:47,550
Oh, I can sell this now.

2971
03:11:47,690 --> 03:11:48,430
Okay, nice.

2972
03:11:48,530 --> 03:11:49,850
And I can sell this, too.

2973
03:11:52,250 --> 03:11:53,190
Alright, bye.

2974
03:11:53,530 --> 03:11:55,090
We're about to case upgrade.

2975
03:11:58,310 --> 03:11:58,790
Okay.

2976
03:11:59,590 --> 03:12:00,390
Do I have junk?

2977
03:12:00,570 --> 03:12:01,050
Oh, I do.

2978
03:12:01,570 --> 03:12:03,250
I have, like, ammo I don't need.

2979
03:12:04,450 --> 03:12:08,190
Uh, flash grenade, first aid.

2980
03:12:09,610 --> 03:12:10,590
Okay, never mind.

2981
03:12:10,710 --> 03:12:11,190
I don't.

2982
03:12:12,590 --> 03:12:13,850
Everything is useful.

2983
03:12:15,710 --> 03:12:17,510
So, Ashley.

2984
03:12:18,030 --> 03:12:20,310
I don't even have Ashley anymore.

2985
03:12:21,770 --> 03:12:23,230
There's treasure here.

2986
03:12:24,310 --> 03:12:25,550
That's nice.

2987
03:12:28,110 --> 03:12:28,750
Treasure.

2988
03:12:30,090 --> 03:12:31,070
Treasure time.

2989
03:12:32,350 --> 03:12:32,610
Boop.

2990
03:12:33,850 --> 03:12:34,250
Nice.

2991
03:12:34,610 --> 03:12:34,930
Boop.

2992
03:12:36,330 --> 03:12:37,250
Okay, can I...

2993
03:12:37,250 --> 03:12:38,010
Where is it?

2994
03:12:38,730 --> 03:12:39,650
The fuck's the treasure?

2995
03:12:42,590 --> 03:12:43,850
Where the fuck's the treasure?

2996
03:12:47,650 --> 03:12:49,050
I'm looking up.

2997
03:12:49,510 --> 03:12:50,070
Is it down?

2998
03:12:52,330 --> 03:12:54,010
Where the fuck's the treasure?

2999
03:12:55,730 --> 03:12:55,990
Hello?

3000
03:12:56,390 --> 03:12:57,530
Oh, it's here!

3001
03:12:59,050 --> 03:12:59,970
How do I look at that?

3002
03:13:00,590 --> 03:13:02,410
Oh my god, do not throw the name.

3003
03:13:03,010 --> 03:13:05,090
Do not throw the name.

3004
03:13:06,150 --> 03:13:07,590
How the fuck do I...

3005
03:13:08,270 --> 03:13:08,910
What?

3006
03:13:10,450 --> 03:13:11,930

03:14:23,160 --> 03:14:28,000
Guys, you're trying to tell me I was supposed to do this
stealthily?

3015
03:14:28,600 --> 03:14:30,080
There's no way.

3016
03:14:31,780 --> 03:14:35,240
There's no way this was supposed to be done stealth-wise.

3017
03:14:37,880 --> 03:14:39,020
This is it!

3018
03:14:44,520 --> 03:14:48,360
There's no way I was supposed to do this stealthily!

3019
03:14:53,150 --> 03:14:53,870
would have thought.

3020
03:14:55,670 --> 03:14:56,750
Who would have thought?

3021
03:14:57,010 --> 03:14:57,210
Chat.

3022
03:14:57,370 --> 03:14:58,810
This is where all the new days are for.

3023
03:14:59,630 --> 03:15:01,030
This is it, guys.

3024
03:15:02,010 --> 03:15:04,390
I told you it was useful.

3025
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:12,200
It was useful.

3026
03:15:12,520 --> 03:15:13,480
I knew it.

3027
03:15:15,660 --> 03:15:16,660
What the fuck?

3028
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:17,920
Oh my god.

3029
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:22,040
Can I just kill him from here?

3030
03:15:22,600 --> 03:15:23,040
Here we go.

3031
03:15:24,100 --> 03:15:24,560
It's fine.

3032
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:25,580
I can kill him from here.

3033
03:15:26,120 --> 03:15:26,680
Oh, he's dead.

3034
03:15:26,780 --> 03:15:27,440
That was it.

3035
03:15:28,100 --> 03:15:28,660
That's it.

3036
03:15:29,760 --> 03:15:29,760
See?

3037
03:15:30,060 --> 03:15:31,820
Look, I didn't waste any ammo.

3038
03:15:33,840 --> 03:15:34,240
Look at that.

3039
03:15:36,180 --> 03:15:37,560
I told you!

3040
03:15:37,860 --> 03:15:38,440
I told you!

3041
03:15:38,580 --> 03:15:38,800
See?

3042
03:15:38,880 --> 03:15:39,400
Look at that!

3043
03:15:39,800 --> 03:15:45,540
I knew that egg throw... That egg throw made me better at
egging people.

3044
03:15:52,960 --> 03:16:06,420
I like to think throwing those eggs may be better at
throwing grenades that was the practice that was what was

3045
03:16:06,420 --> 03:16:14,480

See, look, I got back some handgun ammo.

3053
03:17:36,290 --> 03:17:37,630
It's like I didn't waste them.

3054
03:17:40,670 --> 03:17:43,390
It's like I never wasted it at all.

3055
03:17:43,530 --> 03:17:44,730
Can I get through here?

3056
03:17:45,410 --> 03:17:47,910
I can't tell if it's scanning me or not.

3057
03:17:50,250 --> 03:17:52,470
Man, that would have been nice to shoot at.

3058
03:17:53,350 --> 03:17:55,230
Oh, wait, there's a treasure behind me.

3059
03:17:57,510 --> 03:17:58,530
Where's this treasure?

3060
03:17:58,870 --> 03:18:00,530
It's like right here?

3061
03:18:01,130 --> 03:18:01,990
Oh, here it is.

3062
03:18:06,270 --> 03:18:13,210
See, if I didn't kill everybody, I wouldn't have been able
to loot freely, chat.

3063
03:18:13,710 --> 03:18:17,890
Look at that.

3064
03:18:18,570 --> 03:18:21,650
Now I can loot as much as I want.

3065
03:18:23,850 --> 03:18:24,350
See?

3066
03:18:28,810 --> 03:18:30,530
This had to be done.

3067
03:18:32,770 --> 03:18:34,770
I want to be able to do all this looting.

3068
03:18:36,150 --> 03:18:36,770
Why is this yellow?

3069
03:18:36,870 --> 03:18:37,930
Oh, that was originally...

3070
03:18:37,930 --> 03:18:40,370
It's just... Actually was supposed to be yellow.

3071
03:18:41,650 --> 03:18:42,750
Alright, is there anything up here?

3072
03:18:45,530 --> 03:18:46,250
Oh, ammo.

3073
03:18:46,650 --> 03:18:47,090
Look at that.

3074
03:18:47,210 --> 03:18:48,150
Never punished.

3075
03:18:49,170 --> 03:18:50,770
I got ammo right here.

3076
03:18:52,650 --> 03:18:54,170
Never punished at all.

3077
03:18:55,170 --> 03:18:56,510
Okay, it's like this way.

3078
03:18:59,390 --> 03:19:00,850
Of course I'm right.

3079
03:19:01,730 --> 03:19:02,090
Oh yeah.

3080
03:19:02,370 --> 03:19:03,050
The dokiway.

3081
03:19:03,150 --> 03:19:03,950
I told you.

3082
03:19:04,590 --> 03:19:07,210
The dokiway is always the right way.

3083
03:19:08,050 --> 03:19:09,730
Now where am I?

3084
03:19:11,630 --> 03:19:13,290
We're on the island.

3085
03:19:14,530 --> 03:19:14,750
Okay.

3086
03:19:14,910 --> 03:19:16,470
How do I get across from this?

3087
03:19:17,430 --> 03:19:21,010
I have to go from here.

3088
03:19:21,190 --> 03:19:22,370
Oh my god.

3089
03:19:22,490 --> 03:19:22,710
No.

3090
03:19:22,890 --> 03:19:23,610
Not from here.

3091
03:19:23,870 --> 03:19:24,830
I'm getting lost.

3092
03:19:27,690 --> 03:19:29,390
How do I get lost?

3093
03:19:30,390 --> 03:19:30,550
How?

3094
03:19:31,070 --> 03:19:31,730
How do I...

3095
03:19:31,730 --> 03:19:32,210
How?

3096
03:19:32,670 --> 03:19:34,010
How do I walk from there?

3097
03:19:36,950 --> 03:19:38,890
To go all the way back?

3098
03:19:39,990 --> 03:19:40,830
Like this?

3099
03:19:41,370 --> 03:19:42,590
Oh, okay, here we go.

3100
03:19:43,370 --> 03:19:45,430
Sorry, I had to use my brain for once.

3101
03:19:46,330 --> 03:19:50,050
I can't shoot my way out of this.

3102
03:19:50,530 --> 03:19:51,210
God damn it.

3103
03:19:55,330 --> 03:19:57,130
I actually had to think.

3104
03:19:58,010 --> 03:19:59,810
Oh, the misery.

3105
03:20:01,050 --> 03:20:02,330
I can't believe it.

3106
03:20:05,690 --> 03:20:08,590
I can't just shoot my way out of everything.

3107
03:20:10,170 --> 03:20:10,950
So sad.

3108
03:20:13,090 --> 03:20:13,690
Not.

3109
03:20:14,730 --> 03:20:16,090
How could you say that?

3110
03:20:16,230 --> 03:20:18,890
Everything can be shooting if I try hard enough.

3111
03:20:20,450 --> 03:20:22,390
I can't believe you would say such a thing.

3112
03:20:24,970 --> 03:20:26,010
Okay, let's see.

3113
03:20:26,210 --> 03:20:26,670
Whoa!

3114
03:20:28,290 --> 03:20:28,890
Let's see.

3115
03:20:29,110 --> 03:20:30,170
The fuck how did you hear me?

3116
03:20:30,290 --> 03:20:31,410
It can't be my gun, right?

3117
03:20:35,450 --> 03:20:36,690
No, not this guy.

3118
03:20:39,630 --> 03:20:41,270
Make sure he doesn't get close to me.

3119
03:20:42,090 --> 03:20:42,890
Oh, reloading.

3120
03:20:44,110 --> 03:20:45,210
Don't get close to me.

3121
03:20:45,630 --> 03:20:46,730
Don't get close to me.

3122
03:20:47,070 --> 03:20:48,090
Okay, I'm going to use this.

3123
03:20:52,690 --> 03:20:56,210
That I heard is a one-shot, so I don't want to risk that.

3124
03:20:57,590 --> 03:20:59,930
I'm not risking the one-shot guy.

3125
03:21:02,550 --> 03:21:03,270
Oh, he has a helmet.

3126
03:21:03,530 --> 03:21:04,850
I can still shoot you in the face.

3127
03:21:09,750 --> 03:21:10,090
Okay.

3128
03:21:10,970 --> 03:21:14,470
I can tell when you're dead because you fall down.

3129
03:21:15,670 --> 03:21:16,690
And you drop loot.

3130
03:21:19,910 --> 03:21:21,070
Damon, thank you for the super chat.

3131
03:21:21,310 --> 03:21:21,430
Thank you.

3132
03:21:21,550 --> 03:21:22,170
Thank you.

3133
03:21:22,950 --> 03:21:24,710
Is there anybody above me before I go up?

3134
03:21:27,510 --> 03:21:29,010
Here's somebody up top.

3135
03:21:30,390 --> 03:21:31,950
I had to say this at least once.

3136
03:21:32,130 --> 03:21:32,710
You're amazing.

3137
03:21:32,950 --> 03:21:34,090
Don't ever change.

3138
03:21:34,190 --> 03:21:34,510
Thank you.

3139
03:21:34,610 --> 03:21:35,430
I know I'm perfect.

3140
03:21:36,230 --> 03:21:37,150
The dokey way.

3141
03:21:39,450 --> 03:21:40,650
I could sneak up.

3142
03:21:40,790 --> 03:21:41,950
But then I could do this.

3143
03:21:42,610 --> 03:21:42,850
Oh!

3144
03:21:45,050 --> 03:21:47,390
The rain covered my running.

3145
03:21:52,110 --> 03:21:53,270
Rabs, thank you for the super chat.

3146
03:21:53,390 --> 03:21:53,570
Thank you.

3147
03:21:53,690 --> 03:21:54,290
Thank you.

3148
03:21:55,130 --> 03:21:57,010
That's what I called a pro gamer.

3149
03:21:57,410 --> 03:21:57,890
Exactly.

3150
03:21:58,450 --> 03:21:59,850
This is how gamers play this game.

3151
03:22:03,170 --> 03:22:03,970
Where are they?

3152
03:22:04,090 --> 03:22:04,630
I hear them.

3153
03:22:08,590 --> 03:22:09,350
Where are they?

3154
03:22:09,610 --> 03:22:10,370
I hear them.

3155
03:22:10,850 --> 03:22:11,450
Oh, there he is.

3156
03:22:12,210 --> 03:22:14,030
Oh, shit, crit!

3157
03:22:14,430 --> 03:22:14,670
Nice.

3158
03:22:15,710 --> 03:22:16,270
Good crit.

3159
03:22:18,270 --> 03:22:19,370
I know there's, like, one more.

3160
03:22:20,490 --> 03:22:20,970
Somewhere.

3161
03:22:25,370 --> 03:22:26,110
Where is this?

3162
03:22:26,850 --> 03:22:28,930
Holy shit, what the fuck is this map?

3163
03:22:29,630 --> 03:22:31,290
I like...

3164
03:22:33,070 --> 03:22:36,090
What the fuck he just stood there.

3165
03:22:36,490 --> 03:22:38,730
What are you doing in this corner?

3166
03:22:40,470 --> 03:22:44,010
Bro, it wasn't even like a hiding spot.

3167
03:22:44,190 --> 03:22:45,350
You just stood there.

3168
03:22:46,610 --> 03:22:48,030
He wasn't even hiding.

3169
03:22:48,150 --> 03:22:49,430
That's like the worst part.

3170
03:22:51,510 --> 03:22:53,270
He just stood there.

3171
03:22:53,510 --> 03:22:54,330
Like honestly.

3172
03:22:56,470 --> 03:22:57,550
What was the point?

3173
03:22:57,850 --> 03:22:58,770
He's just chilling.

3174
03:23:02,070 --> 03:23:03,370
Okay, let's see.

3175
03:23:03,730 --> 03:23:05,730
Oh, we can combine it.

3176
03:23:09,230 --> 03:23:10,310
All right, here we go.

3177
03:23:10,610 --> 03:23:11,410
He's missing.

3178
03:23:12,630 --> 03:23:15,370
Toki, he was trying to use the bathroom.

3179
03:23:15,490 --> 03:23:17,570
Does it look like there's any toilets here?

3180
03:23:17,970 --> 03:23:19,390
But why in the cave?

3181
03:23:19,870 --> 03:23:23,390
Like, help the bushes grow or some shit.

3182
03:23:23,730 --> 03:23:24,990
Like, I don't know.

3183
03:23:25,470 --> 03:23:30,550
Like, why waste the liquid on the rock?

3184
03:23:30,870 --> 03:23:31,870
Let me shoot the legs.

3185
03:23:33,850 --> 03:23:35,030
Wait, what the fuck?

3186
03:23:35,610 --> 03:23:36,170
Shoot the toes.

3187
03:23:42,080 --> 03:23:43,520
Alright, here we go.

3188
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:46,820
I'll shoot the legs here.

3189
03:23:47,380 --> 03:23:48,340
It's five.

3190
03:23:49,060 --> 03:23:49,780
Shoot the leg.

3191
03:23:51,940 --> 03:23:52,280
Nice.

3192
03:23:53,300 --> 03:23:53,720

I'm practicing for sniper elite.

3210
03:25:28,280 --> 03:25:29,660
You know, for the ball shot.

3211
03:25:30,760 --> 03:25:32,360
Guys, you won't understand.

3212
03:25:32,500 --> 03:25:33,660
It's for the ball shot.

3213
03:25:36,620 --> 03:25:38,320
There you go.

3214
03:25:38,560 --> 03:25:40,600

The nesticle shot.

3222
03:26:04,610 --> 03:26:06,270
We had to practice somewhere, chat.

3223
03:26:07,010 --> 03:26:09,110
We needed to find time to practice for it.

3224
03:26:09,890 --> 03:26:10,910
This was that time.

3225
03:26:14,550 --> 03:26:17,690

Okay, I was going to say if there's anybody, like, waiting
there because they had to pee.

3229
03:26:56,880 --> 03:26:58,640
Pee in the corner there, I was waiting.

3230

Yay!

3232
03:27:03,420 --> 03:27:05,660
Imagine if I had to stealth all of that.

3233
03:27:06,860 --> 03:27:08,700
Would be a waste of my time.

3234
03:27:12,280 --> 03:27:15,220
Would have been a huge waste of time.

3235
03:27:16,540 --> 03:27:18,400
The P corner, exactly.

3236
03:27:20,040 --> 03:27:21,040
Let's see.

3237
03:27:21,200 --> 03:27:22,500
Oh my god!

3238
03:27:23,180 --> 03:27:23,800
What?

3239
03:27:24,600 --> 03:27:27,380
Alright, we gotta do this, apparently.

3240
03:27:28,500 --> 03:27:30,960
This is a long area.

3241
03:27:35,150 --> 03:27:37,370
Okay, that's a rocket launcher, dude.

3242
03:27:39,530 --> 03:27:42,970
I just wanna make sure I killed a rocket launcher dude
first.

3243
03:27:43,630 --> 03:27:46,230
Because, like, all these other guys don't matter at that
point.

3244
03:27:47,830 --> 03:27:48,450
Okay.

3245
03:27:49,010 --> 03:27:50,590
These guys don't matter.

3246
03:27:51,710 --> 03:27:54,130
I just have to kill the rocket launcher, man.

3247
03:27:55,650 --> 03:27:56,570
Alright, get over here.

3248
03:27:57,010 --> 03:27:57,110
Oh.

3249
03:27:58,190 --> 03:27:59,110
He shot.

3250
03:28:00,950 --> 03:28:02,070
There you go.

3251
03:28:02,710 --> 03:28:03,030
Nice.

3252
03:28:06,010 --> 03:28:07,710
Alright, are you wearing anything on your helmet?

3253
03:28:07,970 --> 03:28:09,070
No, I could totally shoot that.

3254
03:28:09,150 --> 03:28:10,270
That's a gas mask.

3255
03:28:11,810 --> 03:28:15,150
Gas mask isn't tanky enough to stop a bullet.

3256
03:28:15,590 --> 03:28:16,630
Wait, what the fuck you're alive?

3257
03:28:17,530 --> 03:28:18,170
Oh shit.

3258
03:28:18,330 --> 03:28:18,750

3262
03:28:48,770 --> 03:28:51,010

03:28:51,010 --> 03:28:51,910
Where is it?

3264
03:28:52,590 --> 03:28:54,170
I hear it.

3265
03:28:55,790 --> 03:28:56,910
What the fuck is it?

3266
03:28:59,010 --> 03:28:59,470
Huh?

3267
03:29:00,670 --> 03:29:01,610
Where are you?

3268
03:29:02,570 --> 03:29:04,030
I hear you.

3269
03:29:04,630 --> 03:29:06,150
Oh, right here in this corner.

3270
03:29:06,990 --> 03:29:07,270
Okay.

3271
03:29:07,850 --> 03:29:09,130
I don't even know why I shoot these.

3272
03:29:09,170 --> 03:29:10,270
I already missed one.

3273
03:29:10,650 --> 03:29:13,610
I already missed one.

3274
03:29:13,710 --> 03:29:15,930
There's no point in doing these.

3275
03:29:17,030 --> 03:29:17,870
Oh my god.

3276
03:29:22,070 --> 03:29:22,590
Um...

3277
03:29:22,590 --> 03:29:23,930
I think you're here somewhere.

3278
03:29:24,890 --> 03:29:25,490
Are you?

3279
03:29:25,850 --> 03:29:27,330

It's in the village.

3285
03:29:38,220 --> 03:29:40,860
I don't think I can go back, guys.

3286
03:29:41,260 --> 03:29:43,900
Guys, that's how far I've missed it.

3287
03:29:44,040 --> 03:29:46,380
It's all the way back in the fucking village.

Is that the one outside?

3295
03:30:37,870 --> 03:30:40,350
I can't tell if it's not the one outside.

3296
03:30:41,110 --> 03:30:41,830
We're upstairs.

3297
03:30:45,030 --> 03:30:46,470
Maybe they can activate this.

3298
03:30:48,410 --> 03:30:49,090
Come on.

3299
03:30:51,870 --> 03:30:52,550

03:32:28,250 --> 03:32:29,630
Yeah, no yellow paint.

3331
03:32:30,230 --> 03:32:34,610
I How is I supposed to know if there's loot?

3332
03:32:34,790 --> 03:32:36,470
If there's no yellow paint on the locker.

3333
03:32:42,390 --> 03:32:42,790
Ashley!

3334
03:32:43,710 --> 03:32:44,110
Shit!

3335
03:32:45,530 --> 03:32:46,110
Just wake up!

3336
03:32:46,210 --> 03:32:46,830
Are you stupid?

3337
03:32:47,150 --> 03:32:48,410
Why don't you just wake up?

3338
03:32:50,170 --> 03:32:51,130
Rescue Ashley.

3339
03:32:52,870 --> 03:32:53,570

My god, it doesn't seem.

3341
03:32:59,740 --> 03:33:00,160
It's fine.

3342
03:33:01,060 --> 03:33:01,600
It's fine.

3343
03:33:02,800 --> 03:33:03,280
It's fine.

3344
03:33:03,380 --> 03:33:05,540
I'll just kill him before he comes over.

3345
03:33:07,380 --> 03:33:08,320
That's fine.

3346
03:33:08,940 --> 03:33:10,260
Oh, this is not fine.

3347
03:33:11,540 --> 03:33:13,380
Oh my god, this is not fine.

3348
03:33:13,560 --> 03:33:17,500
It's okay Yes, okay, it's fine.

3349
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:20,020
See, it's fine.

3350
03:33:20,200 --> 03:33:20,800
Who needs stealth?

3351
03:33:22,340 --> 03:33:23,180
Who needs stealth?

3352
03:33:25,620 --> 03:33:26,180
Gun.

3353
03:33:27,160 --> 03:33:28,240
Gun is my stealth.

3354
03:33:31,180 --> 03:33:36,980

3360
03:34:19,420 --> 03:34:20,760
Oh, there's a ladder here.

3361
03:34:21,100 --> 03:34:21,600

God damn it.

3363
03:34:22,420 --> 03:34:24,340
The yellow paint has to be more yellow.

3364
03:34:28,300 --> 03:34:31,340
Why couldn't they make the yellow paint more yellow?

3365
03:34:34,660 --> 03:34:34,960
Alright.

3366
03:34:35,340 --> 03:34:35,740
Don't worry.

3367
03:34:35,800 --> 03:34:37,140
I have my rifle right here.

3368
03:34:39,160 --> 03:34:39,420
Alright.

3369
03:34:39,520 --> 03:34:40,260
Let's see.

3370
03:34:40,900 --> 03:34:42,540
I'm gonna put this together.

3371
03:34:42,560 --> 03:34:43,780
just in case.

3372
03:34:44,680 --> 03:34:45,620
Alright, here we go.

Alright.

3378
03:34:59,900 --> 03:35:00,440
Goodbye.

3379
03:35:01,880 --> 03:35:02,340
Boop.

3380
03:35:05,440 --> 03:35:06,380

3381
03:35:06,580 --> 03:35:07,580
Anybody else here?

3382
03:35:08,760 --> 03:35:10,180

Come on, get closer.

3384
03:35:13,040 --> 03:35:13,900

Let's see this way.

3389
03:35:49,080 --> 03:35:49,780
Is there any loot?

3390
03:35:50,580 --> 03:35:50,860
Loot!

3391
03:35:53,880 --> 03:35:54,360
Money!

3392
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:56,000
Ammo.

3393
03:35:56,540 --> 03:35:57,040
I missed ammo?

3394
03:35:57,200 --> 03:35:57,660
Oh, I did!

3395
03:35:58,240 --> 03:35:58,600
Fuck.

3396
03:35:59,980 --> 03:36:00,980
Let me go back.

3397
03:36:02,460 --> 03:36:03,300
It's right here.

3398
03:36:03,480 --> 03:36:04,660
It's the thing that was glowing.

3399
03:36:08,040 --> 03:36:09,880
I missed the glowing thing.

3400
03:36:09,960 --> 03:36:10,620
How could I?

3401
03:36:11,740 --> 03:36:13,380
It was literally glowing.

3402
03:36:14,420 --> 03:36:16,720
You always surprise me, Doki.

3403
03:36:20,040 --> 03:36:20,300
Oh.

3404
03:36:20,960 --> 03:36:21,960
Don't like this.

3405
03:36:23,040 --> 03:36:24,440
Do not like this kitchen.

3406
03:36:27,340 --> 03:36:28,000
Locker.

3407
03:36:28,680 --> 03:36:30,100
Okay, shotgun ammo.

3408
03:36:30,860 --> 03:36:31,920
I sort of need...

3409
03:36:32,640 --> 03:36:37,160
I sort of need rifle ammo because I wasted it.

3410
03:36:37,280 --> 03:36:37,600
Woo!

3411
03:36:40,580 --> 03:36:41,300
Hello?

3412
03:36:43,060 --> 03:36:43,780
Hello?

3413
03:36:43,920 --> 03:36:45,220

Thank you.

3417
03:36:50,640 --> 03:36:50,920
Reminder.

3418
03:36:51,720 --> 03:36:53,820
Adoption is always an option.

3419
03:36:54,580 --> 03:36:55,320
Thank you for the super chat.

3420
03:36:55,440 --> 03:36:55,600
Thank you.

3421
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:56,280
Thank you.

3422
03:36:57,260 --> 03:36:58,260
What the fuck?

3423
03:36:58,380 --> 03:36:59,940
Why is there like...

3424
03:36:59,940 --> 03:37:01,060
I don't like this.

3425
03:37:01,140 --> 03:37:03,520
I don't like how there was like a corridor for no reason.

3426
03:37:03,660 --> 03:37:05,060
Because that means there is a reason.

3427
03:37:11,660 --> 03:37:12,020
Hello?

3428
03:37:14,160 --> 03:37:14,740

Money.

3430
03:37:18,360 --> 03:37:19,840
I don't like that.

3431
03:37:19,940 --> 03:37:20,180
Oh!

3432
03:37:23,020 --> 03:37:23,540
Okay.

3433
03:37:25,260 --> 03:37:26,140
Just in case.

3434
03:37:27,020 --> 03:37:28,180
Don't even drop loot?

3435
03:37:28,820 --> 03:37:29,740
What the fuck?

3436
03:37:30,480 --> 03:37:31,000

3440
03:37:41,580 --> 03:37:42,960

3454
03:38:40,380 --> 03:38:41,860
Wait, is it worth it?

3455
03:38:42,960 --> 03:38:43,500
Nah.

3456
03:38:44,880 --> 03:38:45,580
Nah.

3457
03:38:48,420 --> 03:38:49,540

3462
03:39:27,560 --> 03:39:28,300
Reload speed.

3463
03:39:28,900 --> 03:39:32,580
A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of speed.

3464
03:39:33,380 --> 03:39:34,120
Yeah, I'll do readify.

3465
03:39:34,780 --> 03:39:35,760

3466
03:39:35,940 --> 03:39:37,060
Actually, I can max it out.

3467
03:39:37,160 --> 03:39:38,700
I have enough money to max this out.

3468
03:39:39,300 --> 03:39:39,740
Yay!

3469
03:39:40,920 --> 03:39:42,980
Don't get yourself killed now.

3470
03:39:43,060 --> 03:39:43,320

03:39:47,240 --> 03:39:49,680

Don't worry.

03:39:54,760 --> 03:39:56,040
This is a tanky rifle.

3476
03:39:57,060 --> 03:40:00,400
I can even craft more rifle ammo just in case.

3477
03:40:02,240 --> 03:40:03,700
Just in case.

3478
03:40:06,580 --> 03:40:07,500

3479
03:40:07,500 --> 03:40:07,920

Wait, there's a chicken here?

3482
03:40:11,540 --> 03:40:13,040
This is not a good place for a chicken.

3483
03:40:14,000 --> 03:40:14,600
Because not...

3484
03:40:16,180 --> 03:40:17,300

3508
03:43:31,160 --> 03:43:31,400
Wait.

3509
03:43:32,700 --> 03:43:33,400
The exit break.

3510
03:43:35,320 --> 03:43:36,040
Oh, no.

3511
03:43:37,400 --> 03:43:38,760
Guys, oh, thank God.

3512
03:43:38,880 --> 03:43:42,360
I thought I accidentally broke my mouth.

3513
03:43:45,160 --> 03:43:46,140
Oh, my God.

3514
03:43:47,120 --> 03:43:47,840
Oh.

3515
03:43:48,100 --> 03:43:51,960
Why is it even dark?

3516
03:43:58,740 --> 03:43:59,020
Oh.

3517
03:44:11,100 --> 03:44:12,040
My God.

3518
03:44:17,220 --> 03:44:18,300
My God.

3519
03:44:19,760 --> 03:44:22,500
I hate

3520
03:44:27,610 --> 03:44:28,030
this.

3521
03:44:29,030 --> 03:44:29,450
Okay.

3522
03:44:30,110 --> 03:44:36,410
Your key card application has been approved by the head of
the department.

3523
03:44:36,410 --> 03:44:43,350
Please bring your level 1 key card to dissection and follow
the procedure on the next page.

3524
03:44:43,890 --> 03:44:47,590
Overwrite card for level 2 clearance using the machine
located in freezer.

3525
03:44:48,330 --> 03:44:52,370
Overwrite card for level 3 clearance using the machine
located in incubation lab.

3526
03:44:52,790 --> 03:44:59,010
Please ask each section supervisor for machines to access
the permission to access the machines.

3527
03:45:01,050 --> 03:45:03,050
I didn't even finish reading the lore.

3528
03:45:03,210 --> 03:45:04,130
I was so scared.

3529
03:45:04,970 --> 03:45:05,570
Oh wait, I did.

3530
03:45:06,410 --> 03:45:08,650
Oh my god!

3531
03:45:22,880 --> 03:45:24,460
What did I open?

3532
03:45:26,600 --> 03:45:28,680
I don't even know what I opened.

3533
03:45:28,860 --> 03:45:29,500
I'm too scared.

3534
03:45:30,160 --> 03:45:30,600
I...

3535
03:45:49,360 --> 03:45:51,160
I can't, man!

3536
03:45:59,780 --> 03:46:02,600
Oh my god!

3537
03:46:04,120 --> 03:46:06,160
I hate this!

3538
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:09,300
Oh my god, it is dark!

3539
03:46:09,580 --> 03:46:11,220
It's dark!

3540
03:46:21,460 --> 03:46:23,240
Holy fuck, okay.

3541
03:46:26,120 --> 03:46:27,080
Where do I go?

3542
03:46:36,340 --> 03:46:37,760
I hate this.

3543
03:46:41,350 --> 03:46:43,390
I hate this so much.

3544
03:46:44,050 --> 03:46:46,690
I hate this so fucking much.

3545
03:46:47,210 --> 03:46:48,150
I hate this.

3546
03:46:48,330 --> 03:46:50,110
I don't even have the key card!

3547
03:46:50,270 --> 03:46:52,330
What do I- Oh my god, bro, I'm struggling.

Oh, oh my god, please Okay

3553
03:47:52,680 --> 03:47:54,160
Where does it need to go?

3554
03:47:55,140 --> 03:47:55,860
Oh, there!

3555
03:47:56,920 --> 03:47:57,480
Okay.

3556
03:48:08,530 --> 03:48:10,250
I'm so confused.

3557
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:16,700
Oh, okay.

3558
03:48:19,880 --> 03:48:22,100
Okay, I can figure this out, guys.

3559
03:48:27,290 --> 03:48:28,370
I did it.

3560
03:48:29,190 --> 03:48:30,650
I did it, guys.

3561
03:48:40,690 --> 03:48:42,690
What the fuck is that?

3562
03:48:43,050 --> 03:48:44,830
What kind of experiments are they doing here?

3563
03:48:44,850 --> 03:48:47,850
What the fuck was that?

3564
03:48:50,910 --> 03:48:54,050
At last, I created a new life.

3565
03:48:55,930 --> 03:48:58,070
I call it regenerator.

3566
03:48:58,870 --> 03:49:00,950
This metabolic capacity is incredible.

3567
03:49:01,210 --> 03:49:05,210
Unless all the parasite residing with it are destroyed, the
tissue can...

3568
03:49:05,210 --> 03:49:07,050
Wait, can they never die?

3569
03:49:12,830 --> 03:49:14,210
They never die?

3570
03:49:15,350 --> 03:49:16,890
I can't kill it!

3571
03:49:21,260 --> 03:49:21,980
Oh, yeah.

3572
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:28,780
upon examining the body with a biosensor

3573
03:49:33,930 --> 03:49:43,190
a look from that the parasites behave like vital organs for
the host almost as though it has multiple harm the new

3574
03:49:43,190 --> 03:49:51,550
creation mind is essentially immortal surely even dr
Frankenstein himself would want to shake my hand in

3575
03:49:51,550 --> 03:49:58,290
admiration oh no I'll be fine if there were lights.

3576
03:49:58,390 --> 03:50:00,790
There's no lights.

3577
03:50:10,710 --> 03:50:13,870
The new creation of mine is essentially...

3578
03:50:14,470 --> 03:50:19,130
These guys made me put down the game for three days in the
OG while I was playing in the dark.

3579
03:50:19,250 --> 03:50:20,910
Thank you for the super chat, Cass.

3580

Thank you.

3582
03:50:22,570 --> 03:50:25,310
This new creation of mine is essentially immortal.

3583
03:50:25,870 --> 03:50:32,290
even darker to her and concern myself i want to shake my
hand i share the news of my achievements with what

3584
03:50:32,290 --> 03:50:41,350
pretentious bastard colleague of mine his face went white
then he started scribbling something in his notebook i

3585
03:50:41,350 --> 03:50:49,890
thought he'd be impressed but instead he actually had the
nerve to warn me of the so-called dangers it's a full of

3586
03:50:49,890 --> 03:50:52,150
everything under control

3587
03:50:57,610 --> 03:51:02,090
The subject went wild and scraped from its cryogenic tank.

3588
03:51:02,230 --> 03:51:03,930
I was the real fool.

3589
03:51:04,770 --> 03:51:06,070
Guys, where's the scope?

3590
03:51:07,210 --> 03:51:08,970
Guys, where's the scope?

3591
03:51:09,650 --> 03:51:13,450

Guys, where's the scope?

3596
03:51:27,100 --> 03:51:28,640
Leave me alone.

3597
03:51:28,960 --> 03:51:30,400

Where's the

3602
03:51:57,760 --> 03:52:01,920
power?

3603
03:52:02,880 --> 03:52:03,840
Where's the power?

3604
03:52:12,660 --> 03:52:14,960
Guys guys Where's the power?

3605
03:52:15,600 --> 03:52:16,560
Where do I go?

3606
03:52:17,600 --> 03:52:17,940
Here!

3607
03:52:20,760 --> 03:52:22,720
Do I go here?

3608
03:52:24,880 --> 03:52:29,240
Is it this?

3609
03:52:29,760 --> 03:52:30,100
Okay.

3610
03:52:30,680 --> 03:52:34,260

here, right?

3616
03:53:12,750 --> 03:53:16,550
going to insufficient power?

3617
03:53:16,910 --> 03:53:17,550
What do you mean?

3618
03:53:18,830 --> 03:53:21,370
Guys, he won't attack me, right, guys?

3619
03:53:26,010 --> 03:53:27,070
Surely, right?

3620
03:53:27,530 --> 03:53:28,770
If I just...

3621
03:53:28,770 --> 03:53:29,850
I do it.

3622
03:53:30,850 --> 03:53:33,050
He's just spanking.

3623
03:53:34,070 --> 03:53:38,250
Nah, he won't attack me while I'm doing this.

3624
03:53:39,010 --> 03:53:40,750
There's no way.

3625
03:53:41,450 --> 03:53:45,030
There's no way he would attack me while I'm doing this.

3626
03:53:47,090 --> 03:53:48,290
Oh my god.

3627
03:53:50,770 --> 03:53:51,990
No way.

3628
03:53:52,110 --> 03:53:53,430
There's no way.

3629
03:53:56,790 --> 03:53:57,730
Oh god.

3630
03:53:59,410 --> 03:54:01,970
Where is the power for this?

3631
03:54:04,330 --> 03:54:06,010
He's just waiting patiently.

3632
03:54:06,350 --> 03:54:06,670
Thank god.

3633
03:54:08,430 --> 03:54:09,590

Oh my god.

Is that the scope?

3636
03:54:21,550 --> 03:54:22,730
That's not even the scope.

3637
03:54:22,870 --> 03:54:23,530
I don't need to.

3638
03:54:23,550 --> 03:54:24,110

Turn around.

3688
03:58:15,830 --> 03:58:16,750
Real people.

3689
03:58:19,630 --> 03:58:20,890

Oh, there's so many of them.

3703

Where do I go?

3704
03:59:38,620 --> 03:59:40,220
It's just gonna break out.

3705
03:59:40,360 --> 03:59:42,100
It's just gonna...

3706
03:59:45,750 --> 03:59:46,160

3711
04:00:42,040 --> 04:00:50,200
oh very recent power outage a test subject woke from the
stasis broke out of its holding tank and escaped the subject

3712
04:00:50,200 --> 04:01:03,980
was contained after 20 hours we were unable to recover one
of the bodies and a tool from inside it the cause of this

3713
04:01:03,980 --> 04:01:09,100
unfortunate incident is the unstable power supply the
outdated generators cannot keep up with our demanding

3714
04:01:09,100 --> 04:01:14,960
schedule Management must prioritize the needs of the
engineer over those of the researchers to prevent something

3715
04:01:14,960 --> 04:01:16,700
like this ever happening again.

3716
04:01:17,760 --> 04:01:20,500
Oh my god, they're just looking at me like that.

3717
04:01:21,980 --> 04:01:23,120
Oh my god.

Where do I get the wrench?

3721
04:01:36,670 --> 04:01:38,010
Where do I get the wrench?

3722
04:01:38,130 --> 04:01:39,410
It's inside one of these guys.

3723
04:01:39,530 --> 04:01:40,770

Okay.

3731
04:02:28,000 --> 04:02:28,460
Nice.

3732
04:02:28,780 --> 04:02:29,760
Okay, there's the wrench.

3733
04:02:30,400 --> 04:02:31,240
There's the wrench.

3734
04:02:31,780 --> 04:02:32,920
There it is.

3735
04:02:33,460 --> 04:02:35,480
Oh, there it is.

3736
04:02:39,400 --> 04:02:40,200
Wrench time.

3737
04:02:41,400 --> 04:02:43,300
Oh, wrench time.

3738
04:02:44,600 --> 04:02:46,020
Key time.

3739
04:02:46,460 --> 04:02:47,300
Key time.

3740
04:02:49,840 --> 04:02:50,580
Oh, thank God.

3741
04:02:54,500 --> 04:02:55,540
Oh, thank God.

3742
04:02:55,580 --> 04:02:56,180
I'm fine.

3743
04:02:57,120 --> 04:02:59,680
I'm fine with, like...

3744
04:03:00,620 --> 04:03:01,440
That's fine.

3745
04:03:05,180 --> 04:03:06,140
Alright, nice.

3746
04:03:06,280 --> 04:03:07,020
I got his leg.

3747
04:03:08,960 --> 04:03:09,260
Oh!

3748
04:03:12,960 --> 04:03:14,200
That's not fair.

3749
04:03:17,320 --> 04:03:17,860
Oh, shit!

3750
04:03:21,290 --> 04:03:21,790
Oh, fuck.

3751
04:03:22,910 --> 04:03:23,730
There we go.

3752
04:03:24,070 --> 04:03:25,070
He has no body now.

3753
04:03:25,670 --> 04:03:26,990
He has no body.

3754
04:03:28,390 --> 04:03:31,810
He has no body to regenerate!

3755
04:03:33,390 --> 04:03:34,070
Okay.

3756
04:03:34,910 --> 04:03:35,750
I gotta...

3757
04:03:35,750 --> 04:03:37,130
I gotta reload.

3758
04:03:39,350 --> 04:03:39,770
There we go!

3759
04:03:40,010 --> 04:03:41,370
That hurts me!

3760
04:03:41,890 --> 04:03:42,070
Oh!

3761
04:03:44,210 --> 04:03:46,990
How is I supposed to know he was that close?

3762
04:03:49,430 --> 04:03:50,110
What?

3763
04:03:50,550 --> 04:03:51,830
Somebody get up?

3764
04:03:52,770 --> 04:03:53,090
No.

3765
04:03:54,990 --> 04:03:55,290
Oh!

3766
04:03:59,070 --> 04:04:00,590
Okay, reloading.

3767
04:04:01,370 --> 04:04:01,890
Reloading.

3768
04:04:04,490 --> 04:04:06,010
Oh, reloading.

3769
04:04:07,250 --> 04:04:07,550
Woo!

3770
04:04:13,410 --> 04:04:16,990
I do not feel comfortable that they're just there.

3771
04:04:17,650 --> 04:04:20,690
I don't feel comfortable at all.

3772
04:04:23,550 --> 04:04:24,830
Oh my god, this sucks.

3773
04:04:24,910 --> 04:04:25,430
This sucks.

3774
04:04:25,690 --> 04:04:25,970
This sucks.

3775
04:04:26,610 --> 04:04:26,890
This sucks.

3776
04:04:31,230 --> 04:04:32,610
This fucking sucks.

3777
04:04:32,630 --> 04:04:34,750
It sucks so much!

3778
04:04:42,430 --> 04:04:45,710
They still have loot, I don't want to kill them!

3779
04:04:48,670 --> 04:04:49,510
Bye, bye.

3780
04:04:50,190 --> 04:04:51,370
I'll do it for the loot.

3781
04:04:52,450 --> 04:04:53,610
I'll do it for the loot.

3782
04:04:56,770 --> 04:04:57,770
Okay, that's bullshit.

3783
04:04:58,350 --> 04:04:59,410
That is bullshit!

3784
04:04:59,590 --> 04:05:00,390
That's a hit!

3785
04:05:05,150 --> 04:05:06,210
That's a hit!

3786
04:05:08,230 --> 04:05:08,610
How?

3787
04:05:08,950 --> 04:05:10,190
What the fuck?

3788
04:05:22,240 --> 04:05:23,980
Oh my god.

3789
04:05:24,440 --> 04:05:25,520
Bro, sometimes.

3790
04:05:26,840 --> 04:05:28,640
Sometimes I don't understand.

3791
04:05:29,340 --> 04:05:30,360
I don't understand.

3792
04:05:31,560 --> 04:05:33,180
Like, oh, that's a hit now.

3793
04:05:34,920 --> 04:05:37,180
You're shooting through a lot of flesh.

3794
04:05:39,040 --> 04:05:40,220
I don't understand.

3795
04:05:45,040 --> 04:05:47,180
Why didn't I save more of my...

3796
04:05:47,200 --> 04:05:59,340
ammo why I should have saved some ammo I should have saved
more ammo why was this painted yellow with zero loot there's

3797
04:05:59,340 --> 04:06:13,850

3798
04:06:23,270 --> 04:06:32,010

3800
04:06:52,770 --> 04:07:01,870
heal i had an extra one don't worry You can take the vaccine
to eliminate the bugs.

3801
04:07:06,550 --> 04:07:08,590
It's like the color of your hair, too.

3802
04:07:10,590 --> 04:07:11,490
You're gonna be okay.

3803
04:07:15,600 --> 04:07:16,340
Wait, what?

3804
04:07:17,160 --> 04:07:18,260
I thought I got healed.

3805
04:07:20,600 --> 04:07:22,440
So what were you doing in the cave then?

3806
04:07:25,040 --> 04:07:27,500
What was Lewis and I doing in the cave?

3807
04:07:40,880 --> 04:07:42,760
Oh, it was only temporary.

3808
04:07:43,160 --> 04:07:44,460
Like, what the fuck was the point?

3809
04:07:47,800 --> 04:07:48,840
Oh, my God.

3810
04:07:49,080 --> 04:07:52,480
I hate, I hate the regenerators so fucking much.

3811
04:07:52,600 --> 04:07:53,820
I hate them so much.

3812
04:07:54,240 --> 04:07:54,800
They are...

3813
04:08:06,110 --> 04:08:06,510
Ashley.

3814
04:08:07,470 --> 04:08:08,230
Sorry, I'm late.

3815
04:08:09,510 --> 04:08:10,490
You're okay, Ashley.

3816
04:08:12,750 --> 04:08:13,350
Thank you.

3817
04:08:14,130 --> 04:08:15,710
You brought the medicine just in time.

3818
04:08:16,250 --> 04:08:16,790
Can you stand?

3819
04:08:18,730 --> 04:08:19,370
Where's Louise?

3820
04:08:21,030 --> 04:08:21,670
Good question.

3821
04:08:24,330 --> 04:08:25,790
Yes, let me lie to her.

3822
04:08:26,150 --> 04:08:28,750
It's not like she's, like, in her 20s and can take a lie.

3823
04:08:31,190 --> 04:08:32,270
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

3824
04:08:32,490 --> 04:08:32,630
Thank you.

3825
04:08:32,950 --> 04:08:33,210
Thank you.

3826
04:08:35,030 --> 04:08:35,810
Edgar, thank you.

3827
04:08:36,250 --> 04:08:36,450
Thank you.

3828
04:08:36,530 --> 04:08:36,770
Thank you.

3829
04:08:36,770 --> 04:08:38,030
Just a temporal relief.

3830
04:08:38,190 --> 04:08:39,950
If the bug matures, you need to take other measures.

3831
04:08:40,050 --> 04:08:41,510
Oh, yeah, we have to, like, cut it open.

3832
04:08:45,650 --> 04:08:46,290
Ada, come in.

3833
04:08:46,830 --> 04:08:48,690
There's a lab where we can remove the parasites.

3834
04:08:49,570 --> 04:08:51,850
Had a crazy hunch that you'd know where it is.

3835
04:08:52,990 --> 04:08:58,110
their most important facilities are holding the shotgun at
the top of the mountain that's where i

3836
04:09:06,220 --> 04:09:16,740
okay happy to help now you owe me thank you ada thank you
let me read the lore we're in prison without warning one by

3837
04:09:16,740 --> 04:09:22,920
one we are taking to the next room do you not know what
happens there they just took annabelle i'm probably next

3838
04:09:22,920 --> 04:09:29,620
i've got to think i need to get my head straight all who are
infected with the Plaga will be at the mercy of Lord Sadler.

3839
04:09:30,220 --> 04:09:34,580
If he commands it, they will work themselves to death with a
smile on their face.

3840
04:09:35,180 --> 04:09:40,660
Adversely, the host becomes so simple-minded that they're
basically useless for any complex task.

3841
04:09:41,220 --> 04:09:48,200
However, we succeeded in developing the new superior species
of Plaga, as no special variability, but the host's

3842
04:09:48,200 --> 04:09:50,140
cognitive functions are not diminished.

3843
04:09:50,680 --> 04:09:53,780
It seems like they plan to administer this new species to
the girl.

3844
04:09:54,340 --> 04:09:57,620
It's clearly important perfection.

3845
04:09:58,540 --> 04:10:02,880
All tests were successful and plans for mass production are
moving forward.

3846
04:10:04,320 --> 04:10:08,020
The project is a complete success, but I've been imprisoned.

3847
04:10:09,620 --> 04:10:14,080
And preparations to inject me the superior species are
underway in the next room.

3848
04:10:15,060 --> 04:10:16,620
Annabelle is not herself anymore.

3849
04:10:17,140 --> 04:10:19,900
The smile has been completely white from her face.

3850
04:10:20,540 --> 04:10:23,140
Writing is the only thing that keeps me sane now.

3851
04:10:23,580 --> 04:10:25,460
Not that anyone ever read this.

3852
04:10:25,720 --> 04:10:27,160
Wait, does that mean I have the...

3853
04:10:27,180 --> 04:10:47,240
do i have the uh uh the uh the superior one or the dumb one
i can't tell with leon i i can't tell um let's see good

3854
04:10:47,240 --> 04:10:58,640
question okay i hate this oh my god i hate i hate you
actually I hate you so much.

3855
04:11:03,400 --> 04:11:03,540
Okay.

3856
04:11:06,380 --> 04:11:07,500
Okay, here we go.

3857
04:11:07,900 --> 04:11:10,000
Now I have to deal with the regenerators and you!

3858
04:11:10,520 --> 04:11:11,940
I should have kept you in there!

3859
04:11:12,860 --> 04:11:14,200

I'm sorry, Ashley.

3945
04:16:59,190 --> 04:17:00,250
This is important, Ashley.

3946
04:17:01,890 --> 04:17:04,590
I am a loot goblin, and I need to obtain the ammo.

3947
04:17:05,910 --> 04:17:07,370
Oh, yeah, there was one here, too, anyway.

3950
04:17:11,230 --> 04:17:11,870
There we go.

3951
04:17:14,110 --> 04:17:15,250
Where the fuck is that ammo?

3952
04:17:16,010 --> 04:17:17,070
How did I miss it again?

3953
04:17:18,250 --> 04:17:20,990
Okay, thank god I, like, turn around.

3954
04:17:23,950 --> 04:17:24,830
Where's the ammo?

3955
04:17:26,550 --> 04:17:27,190
Oh, it's here.

3956
04:17:27,270 --> 04:17:29,190
It was right in front of me this entire time.

3957
04:17:30,370 --> 04:17:31,150
God damn it.

3958
04:17:35,670 --> 04:17:36,110
Hello?

3959
04:17:40,230 --> 04:17:40,910

04:17:41,050 --> 04:17:41,270
Crit.

3962
04:17:47,570 --> 04:17:47,850
Nice.

3963
04:17:50,390 --> 04:17:51,130
Oh, what?

3964
04:17:51,470 --> 04:17:51,730
What?

3965
04:17:52,790 --> 04:17:52,890
What?

3966
04:17:53,790 --> 04:17:54,390
What?

3967
04:17:55,150 --> 04:17:55,590
What?

3968
04:17:56,770 --> 04:17:57,150
Okay.

3969
04:17:57,610 --> 04:17:58,950
I could have just done that.

3970
04:17:59,310 --> 04:17:59,710
Oh well.

3971
04:18:00,970 --> 04:18:01,610
Oh well.

3972
04:18:01,850 --> 04:18:03,070
I might have saved a lot.

3973
04:18:03,150 --> 04:18:07,570
I might have saved three bullets if I just walked to the
side.

3974
04:18:12,190 --> 04:18:15,190
If only I just walked to the side.

3975
04:18:18,630 --> 04:18:19,410
Alright, five.

3976
04:18:19,670 --> 04:18:20,690
We did it.

3977
04:18:24,580 --> 04:18:25,420
Wait, what's this?

3978
04:18:25,740 --> 04:18:26,920
Oh, we don't need the money.

3979
04:18:27,140 --> 04:18:27,900
Do we need the money?

3980
04:18:29,060 --> 04:18:30,460
Ashley, are we that poor?

3981
04:18:32,700 --> 04:18:34,080
Ashley, are we that poor?

3982
04:18:34,180 --> 04:18:35,000
Do we need that money?

3983
04:18:36,260 --> 04:18:37,340
Can you find it?

3984
04:18:37,500 --> 04:18:39,080
Oh my god, maybe we don't.

3985
04:18:39,160 --> 04:18:40,560
I don't want to find this.

3986
04:18:41,600 --> 04:18:43,460
Oh my god, it's in front of me!

3987
04:18:43,860 --> 04:18:44,600
Okay, we're fine.

3988
04:18:45,040 --> 04:18:46,880
This island is actually driving me insane.

3989
04:18:49,380 --> 04:18:51,240
I fucking hate this island.

3990
04:18:51,600 --> 04:18:52,840
There's so much right now.

3991
04:18:54,340 --> 04:18:54,820
Okay.

3992
04:18:56,240 --> 04:18:58,980
This island is driving me crazy.

3993
04:19:04,220 --> 04:19:05,740
I'm just gonna shoot the legs.

3994
04:19:06,780 --> 04:19:08,340
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

3995
04:19:08,620 --> 04:19:08,900
Okay.

3996
04:19:11,580 --> 04:19:12,400

How do you survive a grenade?

4002
04:19:25,140 --> 04:19:25,680
Oh!

4003
04:19:26,540 --> 04:19:27,500

4009
04:20:01,920 --> 04:20:07,280
On the other hand, having Ashley here means she is more
likely to die by the regenerators.

4010
04:20:09,040 --> 04:20:10,840
I don't know, Ashley.

4011
04:20:12,960 --> 04:20:16,660
I'm less scared, but also you are going to be such a pain.

4012
04:20:17,760 --> 04:20:21,500
You're going to feel such a pain later.

04:20:26,240 --> 04:20:27,220

Ashley, where are you?

04:22:07,580 --> 04:22:11,520
I left you friends!

4030
04:22:19,420 --> 04:22:24,400
I left you for 30 seconds, Ashley.

4031
04:22:25,860 --> 04:22:26,360
Be careful.

4032
04:22:28,380 --> 04:22:32,900

04:22:36,880 --> 04:22:39,400

04:23:02,700 --> 04:23:03,620
And you're dead.

4041
04:23:04,260 --> 04:23:05,440
You alright?

4042
04:23:06,880 --> 04:23:08,520
No, mentally, no.

4043
04:23:09,300 --> 04:23:10,400
Absolutely not.

4044
04:23:11,240 --> 04:23:12,940
Absolutely not, Ashley.

4045
04:23:13,440 --> 04:23:14,960
I am not okay.

4046
04:23:19,280 --> 04:23:20,460
Oh my god.

4047
04:23:20,820 --> 04:23:22,080

4051
04:23:35,340 --> 04:23:35,680
Ashley.

4052
04:23:36,340 --> 04:23:36,860
No problem.

4058
04:23:54,100 --> 04:23:55,120
Where do they go?

4059
04:23:55,640 --> 04:23:56,160
Hang in there.

4060
04:23:58,740 --> 04:23:59,360
Do I actually kill?

4061
04:23:59,400 --> 04:24:00,200
Okay, I don't kill her.

4062
04:24:01,320 --> 04:24:04,920
I was gonna say, what if I accidentally kill her there?

4063
04:24:06,780 --> 04:24:09,940
The point blank shotgun shot.

4064
04:24:12,120 --> 04:24:15,460

I didn't do that on purpose.

There's like a three second delay.

4173
04:30:10,570 --> 04:30:11,150
No.

4174
04:30:11,370 --> 04:30:13,170

04:31:14,530 --> 04:31:15,530
Where do I run?

4195

04:31:22,030 --> 04:31:23,870
Just run.

4197
04:31:24,530 --> 04:31:25,630

Okay, there we go.

4260
04:36:09,340 --> 04:36:09,820
The rats.

4261
04:36:10,500 --> 04:36:12,860
Sterminate all the rats in the waste disposal.

4262
04:36:13,200 --> 04:36:16,020
Will someone help me keep things clean and take care of
those tiny critters?

4263
04:36:16,760 --> 04:36:17,900
But which here?

4264
04:36:20,440 --> 04:36:20,840

4265
04:36:21,080 --> 04:36:21,820
God, I don't want to...

4266
04:36:21,820 --> 04:36:23,260
I don't want to go back.

4267
04:36:24,500 --> 04:36:25,000
I don't care.

4268
04:36:25,140 --> 04:36:25,720
This is going to be...

4269
04:36:25,720 --> 04:36:26,400
Oh, my God.

4270
04:36:26,440 --> 04:36:27,420
I don't want to go back.

4271
04:36:27,500 --> 04:36:29,340
I don't want to go back.

All right.

4273
04:36:32,640 --> 04:36:35,900
This makes or breaks if I go back to do the rats.

4274
04:36:35,920 --> 04:36:38,980
Will there be anybody else trying to kill me?

4275
04:36:40,600 --> 04:36:44,580
Guys, if I go back, are there going to be enemies there?

4276
04:36:44,920 --> 04:36:46,760
This will make or break it.

4277
04:36:52,120 --> 04:36:53,340
Oh my god.

4278
04:36:55,100 --> 04:36:56,400

I told you it's so fine.

4404
04:45:21,460 --> 04:45:22,500
We're so okay.

4405
04:45:24,960 --> 04:45:25,360
Alright.

4406
04:45:26,780 --> 04:45:27,120
See?

4407
04:45:27,320 --> 04:45:28,540
Nothing to worry about.

4408
04:45:28,700 --> 04:45:30,920
My fucking crane is still full HP.

4409
04:45:31,740 --> 04:45:32,960
Oh, he's just giving me money.

4410
04:45:34,380 --> 04:45:35,760
Why is it just money?

4411
04:45:38,100 --> 04:45:38,720
Is that it?

4412
04:45:40,420 --> 04:45:41,860
Just don't hurt me.

4413
04:45:41,940 --> 04:45:43,080
Just don't hurt me, Ashley.

4414
04:45:48,500 --> 04:45:49,000
Oh.

4415
04:45:50,260 --> 04:45:50,800

This is bad.

4420
04:46:30,380 --> 04:46:30,640
This is bad.

4421
04:46:30,780 --> 04:46:32,000
This is so bad.

4422
04:46:32,320 --> 04:46:33,640
This is so bad.

4423
04:46:33,840 --> 04:46:34,460
This is so bad.

4424
04:46:34,620 --> 04:46:34,720
Oh!

4425
04:46:38,080 --> 04:46:39,380
You are screaming!

4426
04:46:40,360 --> 04:46:41,580
I'm screaming!

4427
04:46:46,200 --> 04:46:47,560
As of this!

4428
04:46:52,800 --> 04:46:53,860
Oh my god.

4429
04:46:54,220 --> 04:46:56,260
Bro, as they are trying!

4430
04:47:05,940 --> 04:47:08,700
Actually, I am going through more than you right now.

4431
04:47:09,160 --> 04:47:09,600
Oh, jeez.

4432
04:47:13,860 --> 04:47:14,820
Oh, my God.

4433
04:47:16,680 --> 04:47:18,660
I'm going through so much shit right now.

4434
04:47:21,320 --> 04:47:22,660
Holy shit, thank you.

4435
04:47:23,260 --> 04:47:24,440
Thank you for the ammo.

4436
04:47:25,360 --> 04:47:26,720
Thank you so much.

4437
04:47:28,600 --> 04:47:29,620
Holy fuck.

4438
04:47:30,400 --> 04:47:31,360
Give me a craft.

4439
04:47:31,780 --> 04:47:34,360
Oh my god, I'm so fucked up right now.

4440
04:47:35,640 --> 04:47:36,940
This is fine.

4441
04:47:38,340 --> 04:47:39,360
This is so fine.

4442
04:47:39,600 --> 04:47:39,920
Get out.

4443
04:47:40,040 --> 04:47:41,100
Get the fuck out.

4444
04:47:43,880 --> 04:47:45,080
Get out.

4445
04:47:47,160 --> 04:47:49,840
Okay, there must be more animal here.

4446
04:47:51,200 --> 04:47:52,040
Oh my god.

4447
04:47:53,300 --> 04:47:53,680
Please.

4448
04:47:54,980 --> 04:47:55,480
Please.

4449
04:47:56,780 --> 04:47:57,260
Please.

4450
04:47:58,120 --> 04:47:58,580
Oh, thank you.

4451
04:47:58,600 --> 04:47:58,800
you.

4452
04:48:00,140 --> 04:48:00,580
Thank you.

4453
04:48:01,520 --> 04:48:03,020
Thank you so much.

4454
04:48:05,640 --> 04:48:07,560
I dealt with so much today.

4455
04:48:09,900 --> 04:48:11,960
I went through so much pain.

4456
04:48:14,140 --> 04:48:14,560
All right.

4457
04:48:15,220 --> 04:48:15,500
All right.

4458
04:48:15,660 --> 04:48:16,180
Get out, Ashley.

4459
04:48:16,980 --> 04:48:17,680
It's time.

4460
04:48:21,260 --> 04:48:22,420
Thank you for the loot.

4461
04:48:22,760 --> 04:48:23,720
Thank you so much.

4462
04:48:24,260 --> 04:48:27,400
There has been sighting of what appears to be a strange
corpse wandering around.

4463
04:48:27,400 --> 04:48:33,680
likely the result of some immortal experiment once someone
put it out of its misery and its and end its pathetic

4464
04:48:33,680 --> 04:48:44,090
existence incubation lab are you kidding me isn't that all

Don't worry.

4468
04:49:02,610 --> 04:49:03,730
We're going to come back.

4469
04:49:04,430 --> 04:49:05,790
I think you might have found your calling.

4470
04:49:08,130 --> 04:49:08,490
Alright.

4471
04:49:08,790 --> 04:49:09,530
Let's see.

4472
04:49:10,550 --> 04:49:12,050
I think we got to push this.

4473
04:49:17,620 --> 04:49:18,200
Don't worry, guys.

4474
04:49:18,260 --> 04:49:19,740
I swear we're going to come back, guys.

4475
04:49:26,100 --> 04:49:26,460
See?

4476
04:49:26,620 --> 04:49:27,560
I unlocked the shortcut.

4477
04:49:27,740 --> 04:49:28,860
That means I'm coming back.

4478
04:49:37,050 --> 04:49:38,070
Guys, unlocked the shortcut.

4479
04:49:38,210 --> 04:49:38,970

4480
04:49:39,150 --> 04:49:39,350
Don't worry.

04:49:43,530 --> 04:49:46,410
Don't worry guys don't worry we back

4482
04:49:58,230 --> 04:50:05,150
Fun fact you could have spent the process up by throwing
grenades at the wall to weaken it for Ashley So it would

4483
04:50:05,150 --> 04:50:10,250
break later that works Well either way snow think of the
super chat.

4484
04:50:10,430 --> 04:50:10,570

then do this and we get out of here

4487
04:50:42,430 --> 04:50:47,550
oh my god I fucking hate her so much.

4488
04:50:49,210 --> 04:50:55,510
I must stress the use of extreme caution when handling the
amber deposits from underneath the castle.

4489
04:50:56,230 --> 04:50:58,470
Work with the utmost respect and obedience.

4490
04:51:00,130 --> 04:51:03,670
It is imperative that you do not disturb the holy body's
slumber.

4491
04:51:08,010 --> 04:51:08,430
Okay.

4492
04:51:09,870 --> 04:51:10,570
Wait, what?

4493
04:51:11,470 --> 04:51:12,990
Not the amber right there?

4494
04:51:14,470 --> 04:51:16,270
This must be what Luis was talking about.

4495
04:51:16,450 --> 04:51:16,750
Yeah, this is what you were talking about.

4496
04:51:16,770 --> 04:51:17,510
This is the deposit.

4497
04:51:17,830 --> 04:51:18,330
The rock.

4498
04:51:19,450 --> 04:51:20,130
It's the rock!

4499
04:51:23,050 --> 04:51:23,810
Let's see.

4500
04:51:23,990 --> 04:51:24,790
John Cena's better.

4501
04:51:26,350 --> 04:51:27,830
Oh, there's an yellow herb.

4502
04:51:28,090 --> 04:51:28,770
I need that.

4503
04:51:31,370 --> 04:51:31,930
Uh...

4504
04:51:32,690 --> 04:51:33,250
See.

4505
04:51:33,850 --> 04:51:35,490
Okay, we just need a red herb.

4506
04:51:40,490 --> 04:51:43,430
Okay, I'm just making sure I loot everything.

4507
04:51:47,020 --> 04:51:47,920
Anything back here?

4508
04:51:48,140 --> 04:51:49,280
What's back here?

4509
04:51:49,820 --> 04:51:54,580
Dearest Lord Sadler, I'm overjoyed to report wonderful news.

4510
04:51:55,560 --> 04:51:59,500
Production of the superior species of Las Plagas is
officially underway.

4511
04:52:00,200 --> 04:52:04,620
If all goes accordingly, rest assured that we'll reach our
ultimate goal.

4512
04:52:05,260 --> 04:52:07,820
The Plagas is a truly magnificent organism.

4513
04:52:08,320 --> 04:52:14,400
It has the capacity to live in any vertebrate, be it a
human, dog, or even crow.

4514
04:52:14,920 --> 04:52:17,040
There are no other parasites like it on Earth.

4515
04:52:18,140 --> 04:52:24,880
species is particularly impressive, as it can assimilate
with a host without causing any damage to the brain.

4516
04:52:25,800 --> 04:52:28,900
No one can oppose the strength of your dominance, my lord.

4517
04:52:29,400 --> 04:52:36,000
On the contrary, whoever resists once experienced an other
joy accompanies the absence of free will.

4518
04:52:36,600 --> 04:52:40,040
I am living proof how ignorant I once was.

4519
04:52:40,460 --> 04:52:48,040
In a few days, I will have finished administrating the plaga
to all the high-ranking researchers, and then they too shall

4520
04:52:48,040 --> 04:52:48,440
know.

4521
04:52:49,800 --> 04:52:53,500
And when your plan is complete, the whole world shall know.

4522
04:52:53,620 --> 04:52:56,840
Oh, it's Annabelle, the girl that stops smiling.

4523
04:52:58,980 --> 04:53:01,100
She's the one that stops smiling.

4524
04:53:04,830 --> 04:53:05,130
Alright.

4525
04:53:05,630 --> 04:53:06,230
This is it.

4526
04:53:06,430 --> 04:53:08,370
Oh, yeah, that's a lot of parasites.

4527
04:53:10,310 --> 04:53:11,090
There they are.

4528
04:53:11,770 --> 04:53:13,550
That's what's inside you, Ashley.

4529
04:53:14,170 --> 04:53:15,750
You're a cross-trained yourself.

4530
04:53:16,770 --> 04:53:18,730
This is our holy body.

4531
04:53:19,790 --> 04:53:23,610
I wonder if that's Annabelle, the one to the left.

4532
04:53:24,350 --> 04:53:26,610
Such a profound blessing for all.

4533
04:53:28,250 --> 04:53:29,290
Lost platter.

4534
04:53:33,240 --> 04:53:33,840
Welcome.

4535
04:53:34,320 --> 04:53:36,220
Oh my god.

4536
04:53:38,240 --> 04:53:39,520
He's like...

4537
04:53:39,520 --> 04:53:40,900
I am Osmond Sadler.

4538
04:53:41,960 --> 04:53:43,680
The speaker for our Lord.

4539
04:53:44,200 --> 04:53:45,400
Tell someone who gives a shit.

4540
04:53:46,980 --> 04:53:47,500
Oh.

4541
04:53:48,320 --> 04:53:49,940
Foolish lambs.

4542
04:53:55,020 --> 04:53:57,980
Oh my god, he heals so fast.

4543
04:53:58,000 --> 04:53:59,580
Now, abandon your body.

4544
04:54:02,040 --> 04:54:04,180
Obey the voice of our Lord.

4545
04:54:12,460 --> 04:54:12,500
Oh.

4546
04:54:13,620 --> 04:54:15,840
Don't worry, I'll heal just like him.

4547
04:54:25,360 --> 04:54:27,020
Do not resist.

4548
04:54:31,760 --> 04:54:36,220
actually your aim what have i what the is going on over
there

4549
04:54:40,540 --> 04:54:54,300

disciples shall deliver to you your penance now child you

4550
04:54:54,300 --> 04:55:00,580
need not be afraid submit your body and release yourself
from fear

4551
04:55:04,950 --> 04:55:05,930
Why not me?

4552
04:55:06,130 --> 04:55:07,390
Do I have the Dumber one?

4553
04:55:07,930 --> 04:55:10,690
Do I have the Dumb Parasite?

4554
04:55:11,330 --> 04:55:12,630
I can't tell.

4555
04:55:17,090 --> 04:55:20,770
I can't tell if I have the Dumb Parasite or the Smart One.

4556
04:55:27,900 --> 04:55:30,520
We got the Leon Parasite.

4557
04:55:37,280 --> 04:55:39,260
I like how they just left me.

4558
04:55:40,040 --> 04:55:44,400
Like, why don't they just... They could have... He could
have personally killed me.

4559
04:55:45,100 --> 04:55:47,740
Like, why did they leave me?

4560
04:55:48,720 --> 04:55:51,240
Why don't you, like, personally do it?

4561
04:55:56,370 --> 04:55:57,530
Wait, is that the...

4562
04:55:57,530 --> 04:55:58,110
What is that?

4563
04:55:58,130 --> 04:55:59,550
Oh, that's just the normal one.

04:56:02,210 --> 04:56:03,070

I just need a stab.

4581
04:57:08,570 --> 04:57:10,430
I don't have to worry about...

4582
04:57:10,430 --> 04:57:13,810
I don't have to worry about fucking shooting him.

4583
04:57:14,090 --> 04:57:15,250
He's on the ladder.

4584
04:57:16,870 --> 04:57:25,870
all right nice gunpowder per your request redevelopment of
the island is well underway weapons and other defensive

4585
04:57:25,870 --> 04:57:32,370
equipment have been set up to guard against any outside
intruders at the time we are finished the island will be a

4586
04:57:32,370 --> 04:57:39,770
giant fortress these defenses won't hold up long term but
they should last until we carry out our plan and once

4587
04:57:39,770 --> 04:57:47,210
accomplished we'll be that much closer to our ultimate goal
of world domination none will be able to resist our power.

4588
04:57:47,890 --> 04:57:47,890
Nice.

4589
04:57:48,890 --> 04:57:51,690
Except for me, because of my thick thighs.

4590
04:57:55,910 --> 04:57:59,350
With the power of my thighs, I shall resist you.

4591
04:57:59,750 --> 04:58:00,070
Whoop.

4592
04:58:01,350 --> 04:58:03,010
Good that I'm getting ammo, though.

4593
04:58:04,170 --> 04:58:06,650
Holy shit, because by God, I need ammo.

4594
04:58:07,890 --> 04:58:08,550
Desperately.

4595
04:58:12,150 --> 04:58:12,470
Nice.

4596
04:58:12,750 --> 04:58:13,210
Gold bar.

4597
04:58:13,630 --> 04:58:13,950
Money.

4598
04:58:15,030 --> 04:58:15,490
Money.

4599
04:58:18,050 --> 04:58:19,370
There's so much loot here.

4600
04:58:19,430 --> 04:58:20,150
I don't like that.

4601
04:58:23,190 --> 04:58:26,470
I do not like the fact that I am getting so much loot.

4602
04:58:27,710 --> 04:58:29,470
Doesn't make me feel good.

4603
04:58:30,770 --> 04:58:31,550
Is there anybody here?

4604
04:58:32,730 --> 04:58:34,010
Is there anybody in the P corner?

4605
04:58:37,680 --> 04:58:39,120
No one at the P corner?

4606
04:58:39,440 --> 04:58:39,720
Okay.

4607
04:58:41,100 --> 04:58:41,960
That's good to know.

4608
04:58:43,260 --> 04:58:43,960
That's good to know.

4609
04:58:43,980 --> 04:58:45,720
No one's going to the bathroom in the caves.

4610
04:58:47,460 --> 04:58:47,820
Alright.

4611
04:58:49,000 --> 04:58:49,840
Down we go.

4612
04:58:49,860 --> 04:59:01,780
go this way look oh i just want to make sure i have
everything reloaded

4613
04:59:05,860 --> 04:59:16,180
oh wait are these soldiers operation haviere few people have
heard the name even within the highest ranks of the u.s

4614
04:59:16,180 --> 04:59:24,660
government and little wonder too the operation was not made
public It was conducted in secret and then buried.

4615
04:59:25,140 --> 04:59:27,980
The reason being it was too inhumane.

4616
04:59:28,720 --> 04:59:32,700
It all started back in 2002, when a small unit of U.S.

4617
04:59:32,700 --> 04:59:36,600
special forces was sent to infiltrate an area of South
America.

4618
04:59:37,260 --> 04:59:39,980
Their mission was to eradicate the drug cartels.

4619
04:59:40,440 --> 04:59:46,580
The whole operation took several years to prepare for it,
and only the most elite soldiers were selected to

4620
04:59:46,580 --> 04:59:47,180
participate.

4621
04:59:47,640 --> 04:59:49,660
Wait, why wasn't I selected to participate?

4622
04:59:49,880 --> 04:59:51,860
Leon, are you not elite enough?

4623
04:59:52,840 --> 05:00:00,720
I don't know if the mission was a failure or not But I do
know the fate of those elite soldiers once it was over

4624
05:00:00,720 --> 05:00:09,580
Apparently the entire unit was wiped out Except for the
commanding officer Major Blank And not by the cartels But by

4625
05:00:09,580 --> 05:00:16,840
the US Oh wait that's it That's that guy Knife guy Oh I was
This is me?

4626
05:00:17,560 --> 05:00:18,260
This is me?

4627
05:00:19,460 --> 05:00:23,900
I was part of that mission It's been 20 years, I don't
remember.

4628
05:00:24,620 --> 05:00:27,060
It shouldn't have been difficult to extract a
single-stranded unit.

4629
05:00:27,680 --> 05:00:32,860
All it would have taken was a single helicopter, but for
some reason, the military didn't act.

4630
05:00:34,120 --> 05:00:39,620
Rumors say that a decision was the outcome of a power
struggle among the top brass.

4631
05:00:40,240 --> 05:00:45,780
Others say it was a directive from the former president
himself, but we may never know the truth since it was all

4632
05:00:45,780 --> 05:00:46,480
covered up.

4633
05:00:47,000 --> 05:00:48,540
But I'm certain of one thing.

4634
05:00:49,040 --> 05:00:49,580
The U.S.

4635
05:00:49,580 --> 05:00:51,420
government let those people die.

4636
05:00:51,900 --> 05:00:58,780
brave young people who dedicated their lives to protect
their country i want to expose oh my god he's a

4643
05:01:56,130 --> 05:01:58,890
that we don't have WikiLeaks anymore.

4644
05:02:01,770 --> 05:02:04,110
Depart from campus with the target.

4645
05:02:04,690 --> 05:02:05,330
Escort the cart.

4646
05:02:05,850 --> 05:02:06,250
Ashley grabs.

4647
05:02:06,350 --> 05:02:08,130
Oh, this is the abduction of the president's daughter.

4648
05:02:08,390 --> 05:02:10,450
Escort the target as usual until the start of phase two.

4649
05:02:10,890 --> 05:02:13,850
There should be three outside inside the vehicle, including
Baker.

4650
05:02:14,950 --> 05:02:17,330
Uh, Abe's unit will follow behind you in a separate vehicle.

4651
05:02:17,750 --> 05:02:18,370
Continue to drive.

4652
05:02:18,930 --> 05:02:19,950
Who cares about?

4653
05:02:20,290 --> 05:02:21,330
She's already kidnapped.

4654
05:02:21,430 --> 05:02:23,390
Do we really need to know this information?

4655
05:02:24,110 --> 05:02:24,990
We already... Whoa!

4656
05:02:25,090 --> 05:02:28,230
Oh, whose blood is that?

4657
05:02:29,850 --> 05:02:31,230
Mr. WikiLeaks?

4658
05:02:32,810 --> 05:02:33,630
Is that your blood?

4659
05:02:36,850 --> 05:02:38,150
Look alive.

4660
05:02:39,610 --> 05:02:40,650
Where did the crow go?

4661
05:02:40,970 --> 05:02:41,650
Shit!

4662
05:02:42,590 --> 05:02:42,590

4664
05:02:50,510 --> 05:02:52,510

4673
05:04:03,630 --> 05:04:04,730
Oh, there it is.

Just us.

4675
05:04:14,600 --> 05:04:15,500
Watered by the blood.

4676
05:04:26,740 --> 05:04:27,440
Oh my god.

4677
05:04:27,920 --> 05:04:30,400
It's so nice of him to tell me to get ready for battle.

4678
05:04:31,520 --> 05:04:35,400
I know, like, other soldiers will think about, like, you
know, the ambush.

4679
05:04:35,980 --> 05:04:38,040
But I'm glad that he, like, prepped me for this.

4680
05:04:38,420 --> 05:04:41,380
Like, we're at Save 100!

4681
05:04:43,540 --> 05:04:44,420
Our milestone!

4682
05:04:47,940 --> 05:04:48,900
Yay!

4683
05:04:49,940 --> 05:04:51,580
Let's celebrate, everybody.

4684
05:04:52,320 --> 05:04:55,320
Congratulations on a hundred C's.

4685
05:04:57,280 --> 05:04:57,960
Yay!

4686
05:04:59,560 --> 05:05:01,140
We did it.

4687
05:05:03,100 --> 05:05:06,320
We fucking did it, guys.

4688
05:05:08,780 --> 05:05:09,740
Celebrate.

4689
05:05:09,960 --> 05:05:13,500
It's like for a birthday, but better because it's a hundred
birthdays.

4690
05:05:15,480 --> 05:05:16,920
I've been waiting for you.

4691
05:05:17,500 --> 05:05:19,040
I swear to God, are we going to knife again?

4692
05:05:19,280 --> 05:05:20,560
I repaired my knife this time.

4693
05:05:24,440 --> 05:05:26,340
Couldn't have done it while you dragoons.

4694
05:05:26,480 --> 05:05:28,040
You always had poor judgment.

4695
05:05:28,060 --> 05:05:28,900
Is that your blood?

4696
05:05:29,580 --> 05:05:31,560
Bro, I think you need a blood transfusion.

4697
05:05:31,920 --> 05:05:33,920
You're going to let you out of here alive.

4698
05:05:35,800 --> 05:05:38,320
You're even more naive than I thought.

4699
05:05:39,560 --> 05:05:40,780
You can't save her.

4700
05:05:41,160 --> 05:05:43,020
You can't save anyone.

4701
05:05:43,440 --> 05:05:44,260
Give it up, Krauser.

4702
05:05:45,420 --> 05:05:48,920
Being a lackey for these maniacs won't bring your men back.

4703
05:05:50,220 --> 05:05:51,200
And what the hell for?

4704
05:05:52,160 --> 05:05:53,360
Revenge on the government?

4705
05:05:54,700 --> 05:05:55,880
You think they would want that?

4706
05:05:56,740 --> 05:05:57,160
Revenge.

4707
05:05:58,120 --> 05:06:02,020
You think I'm doing all this for revenge?

4708
05:06:02,700 --> 05:06:03,940
Isn't that what this is all about?

4709
05:06:04,000 --> 05:06:04,820
Yeah, what is this about?

4710
05:06:05,060 --> 05:06:08,620
See, in that jungle, I had a revelation.

4711
05:06:09,960 --> 05:06:15,160
The most important thing in this world is pure, unadulted.

4712
05:06:15,180 --> 05:06:16,800
rated power.

4713
05:06:18,420 --> 05:06:19,860
Most Illuminados have given me that.

4714
05:06:20,980 --> 05:06:22,200
You know, you were always an asshole.

4715
05:06:23,720 --> 05:06:25,440
But at least you had some kind of code.

4716
05:06:26,440 --> 05:06:27,140
Some honor.

4717
05:06:27,200 --> 05:06:29,940
There's no honor and power and money.

4718
05:06:30,180 --> 05:06:30,980
Look at you now.

4719
05:06:32,700 --> 05:06:33,680
Enough reminiscing.

4720
05:06:35,540 --> 05:06:37,780
Move out and draw fire, soldier.

4721
05:06:39,380 --> 05:06:39,860
Damn.

4722
05:06:40,740 --> 05:06:42,080
Bro, he has a gun now?

4723
05:06:43,100 --> 05:06:44,940
Bro, what do you mean a knife fight?

4724
05:06:45,180 --> 05:06:50,980
Hey Yeah, why don't I just do this not like I have a choice

05:07:53,030 --> 05:07:53,630
Oh, I got a beetle.

4731
05:07:54,550 --> 05:07:55,790
Okay, I wasn't...

4732
05:07:55,790 --> 05:07:58,650
I didn't mean to, but I got a beetle now.

4733
05:07:59,810 --> 05:08:01,210
I'm gonna sell that for money.

4734
05:08:02,350 --> 05:08:02,730
Oh, wait.

4735
05:08:02,730 --> 05:08:03,310
Where do I go?

4736
05:08:03,590 --> 05:08:05,090
He gave me the London treatment.

4737
05:08:05,170 --> 05:08:05,830
He sure did.

4738
05:08:07,530 --> 05:08:09,090
I guess I'll go this way.

4739
05:08:10,210 --> 05:08:10,490
Right?

4740
05:08:12,130 --> 05:08:13,630
This is where I came from.

4741
05:08:14,190 --> 05:08:15,290
No, this is where I go.

4742
05:08:16,210 --> 05:08:17,610
How do I get lost or ready?

4743
05:08:19,610 --> 05:08:23,550
Guys, How am I already lost?

4744
05:08:26,730 --> 05:08:28,110
Alright, let's see.

4745
05:08:29,690 --> 05:08:31,650
I'm gonna sell this speed up.

4746
05:08:31,850 --> 05:08:34,730
He became satisfied after stabbing you a few times.

4747
05:08:34,910 --> 05:08:35,550
Fights over.

4748

05:08:42,470 --> 05:08:43,570
I might as well just eat the fish.

4755
05:08:43,910 --> 05:08:45,650

Time for the teacher to beat you.

4929
05:19:54,630 --> 05:19:56,570
Oh, such confidence.

4930
05:19:57,450 --> 05:19:58,150
Bring it, Rookie!

4931
05:19:58,950 --> 05:19:59,490
Damn, right.

4932
05:20:00,350 --> 05:20:00,910
See?

4933
05:20:01,130 --> 05:20:01,370
There!

4934
05:20:01,890 --> 05:20:03,910
Are you ready, Rookie?

4935
05:20:04,550 --> 05:20:05,810
Hey babe!

4936
05:20:07,710 --> 05:20:09,190
Oh fuck bro!

4937
05:20:15,500 --> 05:20:16,980
I'm gonna shoot your fucking feet.

4938
05:20:17,900 --> 05:20:18,900
That's fucking right.

4939
05:20:19,580 --> 05:20:21,720
Oh god.

4940
05:20:23,400 --> 05:20:24,420
Oh god, where are you going?

4941
05:20:24,720 --> 05:20:25,420
Where are you going?

4942
05:20:29,600 --> 05:20:30,360
What?

4943
05:20:30,860 --> 05:20:31,140
Why?

4944
05:20:31,620 --> 05:20:34,060
The way you're going, why?

4945
05:20:39,410 --> 05:20:40,050
Why?

4946
05:20:40,370 --> 05:20:40,750
Why?

4947
05:20:41,450 --> 05:20:41,790
Yeah!

4948
05:20:49,330 --> 05:20:51,610
Oh my god.

4949
05:20:51,850 --> 05:20:53,970
Holy shit.

4950
05:20:53,990 --> 05:20:55,390
It turned into a freak.

4951
05:20:55,870 --> 05:20:56,050
Okay.

4952
05:20:57,030 --> 05:20:58,250
Oh god, please like to reload.

4953
05:21:01,230 --> 05:21:04,010
Oh, fucking hell!

4954
05:21:04,330 --> 05:21:04,750
I swear!

4955
05:21:07,770 --> 05:21:10,630
When he does this climb, I'm climbing!

4956
05:21:11,970 --> 05:21:12,630
I did it.

4957
05:21:13,390 --> 05:21:13,670
Oh!

4958
05:21:13,910 --> 05:21:14,310
Oh!

4959
05:21:18,760 --> 05:21:21,560
Oh my god, no, Magnum is for the final boss.

4960
05:21:26,690 --> 05:21:28,130
I have the high ground.

4961
05:21:28,410 --> 05:21:29,190
Kick him down.

4962
05:21:39,590 --> 05:21:41,010
All I had to do was get high ground.

4963
05:21:41,190 --> 05:21:42,710
That was always the only way.

4964
05:21:45,110 --> 05:21:46,810
And I'll be like, no, I'm better than you.

4965
05:21:46,870 --> 05:21:47,870
I'm not a monster.

4966
05:21:48,110 --> 05:21:49,850
And then he just turns around and looks cool.

4967
05:22:01,340 --> 05:22:02,720
I'm not like you.

4968
05:22:03,740 --> 05:22:05,780
And then you turn around and look so cool.

4969
05:22:06,000 --> 05:22:09,540
And then he's like, rookie, you should never...

4970
05:22:09,560 --> 05:22:10,080
Never.

4971
05:22:10,440 --> 05:22:11,960
Oh, he- wait, what?

4972
05:22:16,060 --> 05:22:17,880
What the fuck?

4973
05:22:20,300 --> 05:22:20,740
Okay.

4974
05:22:21,480 --> 05:22:22,820
I did not expect that.

4975
05:22:24,480 --> 05:22:25,140
Never mind.

4976
05:22:31,910 --> 05:22:32,470
I wouldn't.

4977
05:22:33,610 --> 05:22:34,530
That you did, Major.

4978
05:22:36,010 --> 05:22:37,250
The honor!

4979
05:22:38,010 --> 05:22:38,570
That you did.

4980
05:22:39,590 --> 05:22:41,330
I thought this was anime.

4981
05:22:41,730 --> 05:22:43,010
I did.

4982
05:22:44,750 --> 05:22:46,410
I thought we were in anime.

4983
05:22:46,890 --> 05:22:48,530
After he got rid of his limiters?

4984
05:22:51,310 --> 05:22:51,750
Damn.

4985
05:22:52,210 --> 05:22:54,190
I actually fucking shanked him.

4986
05:22:54,750 --> 05:22:56,850
Leo ain't no Boy Scout.

4987
05:22:59,330 --> 05:23:00,130
Alright, nice.

4988
05:23:01,310 --> 05:23:01,990
Let's see.

4989
05:23:03,190 --> 05:23:05,410
How the fuck was I supposed to know he'd actually do it?

4990
05:23:05,490 --> 05:23:07,470
Jesus Christ, I used so many heals.

4991
05:23:09,070 --> 05:23:09,510
Fuck.

4992
05:23:09,970 --> 05:23:10,810
I can't believe it.

4993
05:23:10,810 --> 05:23:12,150
He actually killed him.

4994
05:23:12,230 --> 05:23:13,110
What a madman.

4995
05:23:19,230 --> 05:23:21,170
Mediate, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4996
05:23:21,310 --> 05:23:23,270
No, I'll never be like you.

4997
05:23:23,830 --> 05:23:25,050
I'll never be.

4998
05:23:25,990 --> 05:23:26,950
President Giva.

4999
05:23:42,540 --> 05:23:43,460
Q credits.

5000
05:23:46,300 --> 05:23:47,260
Chapter end.

5001
05:23:48,180 --> 05:23:48,500
Alright.

5002
05:23:49,040 --> 05:23:50,880
This is, oh wait, no, that's not the worst.

5003
05:23:51,720 --> 05:23:54,520
That was not the worst accuracy I've had.

5004
05:23:56,740 --> 05:23:57,620
Two more chapters.

5005
05:23:58,660 --> 05:23:59,820
We're so close, guys.

5006
05:24:00,080 --> 05:24:01,720
We're almost there.

5007
05:24:02,520 --> 05:24:03,540
Two more chapters.

5008
05:24:06,180 --> 05:24:06,820
Holy fuck.

5009
05:24:07,600 --> 05:24:08,340
Which is...

5010
05:24:08,340 --> 05:24:09,580
This is a knife?

5011
05:24:10,020 --> 05:24:10,360
No.

5012
05:24:10,900 --> 05:24:12,200
This is a knife.

5013
05:24:13,400 --> 05:24:13,580
Alright.

5014
05:24:14,400 --> 05:24:16,140
I have this as my knife now.

5015
05:24:18,000 --> 05:24:20,280
Make your way to the summit.

5016
05:24:24,240 --> 05:24:25,620
This chapter is a pain?

5017
05:24:26,700 --> 05:24:30,420
You mean not the one where I just have to fight that fucking
major?

5018
05:24:30,420 --> 05:24:32,700

no How is this knife stronger?

5022
05:25:12,810 --> 05:25:13,830
Is this knife stronger?

5023
05:25:14,070 --> 05:25:16,070
The fighting knife than my combat knife?

5024
05:25:20,340 --> 05:25:21,440
Is it actually?

5025
05:25:23,480 --> 05:25:24,300
It is?

5026
05:25:24,460 --> 05:25:27,740
Okay, I'm gonna sell this and then I'll sell my...

5027
05:25:27,740 --> 05:25:29,360
I'll sell my combat knife.

5028
05:25:29,400 --> 05:25:33,160
Jesus Christ, it is 147.

5029
05:25:34,080 --> 05:25:36,340
Holy fuck, that is a strong knife.

5030
05:25:36,540 --> 05:25:36,720
Okay.

5031
05:25:37,300 --> 05:25:39,320

5036
05:26:26,280 --> 05:26:27,980
Oh, whoops.

5037
05:26:28,860 --> 05:26:29,660
That's awkward.

5038
05:26:30,860 --> 05:26:33,920
That's that's very awkward.

05:26:39,830 --> 05:26:40,750
Whoops.

05:26:41,790 --> 05:26:42,150
Oh, well.

05:26:42,870 --> 05:26:45,330
But look at how cool my knife is now.

5042
05:26:46,050 --> 05:26:46,390
Guys.

5043
05:26:47,090 --> 05:26:49,370
My knife looks so cool, though.

5044
05:26:49,570 --> 05:26:50,730
Look at it.

5045
05:26:53,110 --> 05:26:55,630
Look at how cool my knife is.

5046
05:26:56,870 --> 05:26:57,210
No.

5047
05:26:57,690 --> 05:26:59,230
We live with our consequences.

5048
05:27:00,930 --> 05:27:01,690
No, we live.

5049
05:27:01,830 --> 05:27:02,970
We live with our choices.

5050
05:27:03,690 --> 05:27:05,210
We're not Baldur's gaining this.

5051
05:27:08,970 --> 05:27:11,010
We live with our choices.

5052
05:27:12,650 --> 05:27:14,430
With the mistakes we make.

5053
05:27:14,810 --> 05:27:15,930
Oh my god.

5061
05:27:36,190 --> 05:27:37,190

Turn around.

That's all I wanted.

5091
05:29:43,550 --> 05:29:45,430
I just wanted you to turn around.

5092
05:29:47,770 --> 05:29:48,810
Holy fuck.

5093
05:29:50,450 --> 05:29:53,070
It only took us like 20 tries.

5094
05:29:53,930 --> 05:29:55,030
But he did it.

5095
05:29:55,530 --> 05:29:56,810
He fucking did it.

5096
05:29:59,630 --> 05:30:00,450
I swear.

5097
05:30:00,570 --> 05:30:01,230
Oh, there's boxes here.

Boxes.

Money.

05:30:05,390 --> 05:30:07,250
Okay, there is a treasure.

Okay, nice.

So much money.

5103
05:30:12,170 --> 05:30:13,370
Is it just money?

5104
05:30:15,070 --> 05:30:16,750
It is just money.

5105
05:30:17,770 --> 05:30:19,430
Guys, maybe I can buy back my gun.

5106
05:30:21,390 --> 05:30:24,170
Guys, guys, I think I can buy back my knife.

5107
05:30:27,510 --> 05:30:29,050
Guys, I think it's possible.

5108
05:30:32,630 --> 05:30:33,050
Okay, nice.

05:30:43,210 --> 05:30:43,610
Let's go.

5113
05:30:46,150 --> 05:30:46,550
Nice.

5114
05:30:46,750 --> 05:30:46,850
Nice.

5115
05:30:48,950 --> 05:30:50,390
All right, I'll wait here.

5116
05:30:50,490 --> 05:30:51,090
Okay, I'm gonna wait here.

5117
05:30:51,190 --> 05:30:51,850
Go do your thing.

5118
05:30:52,950 --> 05:30:54,070
You go do your thing.

5119
05:30:54,990 --> 05:30:55,850
You go do your thing?

5120
05:30:56,890 --> 05:30:57,650
You go.

5121
05:30:58,370 --> 05:30:58,730
Nice.

5122
05:30:59,590 --> 05:30:59,950
Yay!

5123
05:31:05,810 --> 05:31:08,290
Um, yeah, you definitely don't.

5124
05:31:08,370 --> 05:31:09,750
You gotta hit me or the enemy.

5125
05:31:10,370 --> 05:31:11,110
That's for sure.

5126
05:31:12,690 --> 05:31:14,470
He definitely doesn't miss, guys.

5127
05:31:15,270 --> 05:31:17,750
Okay, we're gonna get him right now.

5128
05:31:18,270 --> 05:31:19,730
Bro, what the fuck?

5129
05:31:21,230 --> 05:31:22,050
Who are you shooting at?

5130
05:31:22,070 --> 05:31:22,430
Oh, there.

5131
05:31:23,370 --> 05:31:23,690
Nice.

5132
05:31:24,090 --> 05:31:24,990
I'll just stay here.

5133
05:31:25,850 --> 05:31:26,330
It's alright.

5134
05:31:26,430 --> 05:31:27,250
I'll just stay here.

5135
05:31:27,410 --> 05:31:28,610
Can you shoot that one guy?

5136
05:31:30,530 --> 05:31:31,350
Can you shoot him?

5137
05:31:31,790 --> 05:31:33,770
He's getting awfully close to me.

5138
05:31:36,410 --> 05:31:37,910
He's getting closer.

5139
05:31:41,790 --> 05:31:42,270
Helicopter?

5140
05:31:44,430 --> 05:31:44,910
Helicopter?

5141
05:31:45,630 --> 05:31:46,750
Where are you?

5142
05:31:46,990 --> 05:31:47,730
Oh, there you are.

5143
05:31:49,570 --> 05:31:50,330
Thank you.

5144
05:31:52,710 --> 05:31:54,010
Thank you for the assistance.

5145
05:31:55,310 --> 05:31:56,810
See, is there anything else I'm missing here?

5146
05:31:57,730 --> 05:31:57,950
Alright.

5147
05:31:58,470 --> 05:31:58,750

Okay, I can combine this now.

5153
05:32:11,630 --> 05:32:12,750
That was the only thing I was missing.

5154
05:32:14,890 --> 05:32:15,910
Alright, go do your thing.

5155
05:32:16,710 --> 05:32:17,190

5156
05:32:19,430 --> 05:32:20,230
Go do your thing.

5157
05:32:21,430 --> 05:32:23,090
Oh, what is that thing?

5158
05:32:23,930 --> 05:32:24,190

Excuse me?

5194
05:35:01,670 --> 05:35:04,770

05:35:09,050 --> 05:35:11,230
I'm sorry, but what does that mean?

5197
05:35:14,290 --> 05:35:16,130
No, there's no way.

5198
05:35:16,230 --> 05:35:17,290
No, you're fucking with me.

5199
05:35:17,330 --> 05:35:18,150
There's no way.

5200
05:35:18,630 --> 05:35:19,770
There's no way.

5201
05:35:19,970 --> 05:35:21,670
You have to be fucking with me.

5202
05:35:23,470 --> 05:35:24,870
That'd be so funny.

5203
05:35:24,990 --> 05:35:26,590
But we all know that's a joke.

5204
05:35:27,750 --> 05:35:30,050
It'd be so funny, but it's a joke, right?

5205
05:35:33,710 --> 05:35:34,670
Right guys?

5206
05:35:38,050 --> 05:35:40,050
But well, yeah, it's all like hypothetical.

5207
05:35:41,430 --> 05:35:43,650
It's just a hypothetical, right guys?

5208
05:35:44,210 --> 05:35:45,010
Yeah, what if?

5209
05:35:45,130 --> 05:35:49,230
What if in this hypothetical situation that doesn't exist?

5210
05:35:52,670 --> 05:35:54,090
That's not real.

5211
05:35:55,230 --> 05:35:58,210
This purely hypothetical situation.

5212
05:36:01,410 --> 05:36:02,670
Alright, it's this way.

5213
05:36:03,990 --> 05:36:05,010
What the fuck is this?

5214
05:36:05,530 --> 05:36:06,170
How do I...

5215
05:36:06,170 --> 05:36:06,410
What?

5216
05:36:07,230 --> 05:36:08,850
Wait, how do I...

5217
05:36:08,850 --> 05:36:10,170
Okay, I ran in a circle.

5218
05:36:10,610 --> 05:36:12,650
I ran in a circle.

5219
05:36:15,150 --> 05:36:15,790
Alright.

5220
05:36:16,470 --> 05:36:17,610
We go back up.

5221
05:36:22,010 --> 05:36:22,190
Alright.

5222
05:36:22,210 --> 05:36:23,030
Alright, here we go.

5223
05:36:23,070 --> 05:36:24,790
How the fuck do I go get there?

5224
05:36:26,190 --> 05:36:27,350
Go go Leon.

5225
05:36:30,690 --> 05:36:31,210
How?

5226
05:36:32,870 --> 05:36:33,350
How?

5227
05:36:35,430 --> 05:36:36,630
Climb the tower?

5228
05:36:36,990 --> 05:36:37,350
Where?

5229
05:36:37,550 --> 05:36:38,090
Oh, this?

5230
05:36:40,510 --> 05:36:41,970
I climbed this tower?

5231
05:36:43,830 --> 05:36:45,050
Oh my god.

5232
05:36:45,270 --> 05:36:45,970
I was so confused.

5233
05:36:46,710 --> 05:36:47,530
Oh my god.

5234
05:36:48,070 --> 05:36:49,470
Where the fuck did you come from?

5235
05:36:49,610 --> 05:36:50,130
Boom.

5236
05:36:52,250 --> 05:36:53,330
Okay, we're fine.

5237
05:36:55,930 --> 05:36:59,130
And then we're going to get rid of you real fast.

5238
05:37:00,090 --> 05:37:03,170
And then he is not going to shoot that rocket, right?

5239
05:37:03,990 --> 05:37:04,390
Nice.

5240
05:37:04,710 --> 05:37:05,670
Wait, it didn't even hit him.

5241
05:37:05,910 --> 05:37:07,370
Did this man just take a rocket?

5242
05:37:08,770 --> 05:37:10,070
Bro, this is not fair.

5243
05:37:12,710 --> 05:37:13,470
How can he...

5244
05:37:14,130 --> 05:37:14,710
Oh, God.

5245
05:37:14,830 --> 05:37:15,230
Tank the rocket.

5246
05:37:15,370 --> 05:37:15,790
Tank the rocket.

5247
05:37:15,910 --> 05:37:16,450
Tank the rocket.

5248
05:37:16,770 --> 05:37:17,370
Tank the rocket.

5249
05:37:17,510 --> 05:37:18,090
Shoot the rocket.

5250
05:37:18,790 --> 05:37:19,450
Shoot the rocket.

5251
05:37:20,190 --> 05:37:20,850
Shoot the rocket.

5252
05:37:21,270 --> 05:37:21,550
Yeah!

5253
05:37:23,370 --> 05:37:24,530
That's how you game.

5254
05:37:24,770 --> 05:37:25,830
And he's still alive.

5255
05:37:28,810 --> 05:37:30,050
Alright, where is this guy?

5256
05:37:32,670 --> 05:37:33,050
Whoop.

5257
05:37:34,490 --> 05:37:34,670
Why?

5258
05:37:37,610 --> 05:37:39,250
I'm just gonna shoot you in the crash.

5259
05:37:39,410 --> 05:37:39,890
Fuck this.

5260
05:37:41,610 --> 05:37:42,570
Fuck this.

5261
05:37:42,850 --> 05:37:43,530
I can't.

5262
05:37:44,230 --> 05:37:46,770
I do not have the patience to headshot you.

5263
05:37:49,910 --> 05:37:50,790
There you go.

5264
05:37:52,610 --> 05:37:53,770
Wait, where did he go?

5265
05:37:53,850 --> 05:37:55,010
Wait, he just... Okay, nice.

5266
05:37:55,350 --> 05:37:55,350
Crit.

5267
05:37:56,470 --> 05:37:56,470
Crit!

5268
05:37:58,270 --> 05:37:58,870
Let's go.

5269
05:37:59,090 --> 05:38:00,630
Up we go!

5270
05:38:00,910 --> 05:38:01,650
Up we go!

5271
05:38:03,170 --> 05:38:03,950
Anybody here?

5272
05:38:05,110 --> 05:38:06,010
Oh, machine gun.

5273
05:38:06,930 --> 05:38:08,090
Alright, so I need shotgun.

5274
05:38:08,490 --> 05:38:08,830
Not shotgun.

5275
05:38:09,130 --> 05:38:09,750
Handgun ammo.

5276
05:38:10,710 --> 05:38:11,110
Nice.

5277
05:38:12,710 --> 05:38:13,630
Can you see this?

5278
05:38:14,970 --> 05:38:16,090
Is that it?

5279
05:38:16,630 --> 05:38:17,730
Am I doing anything?

5280
05:38:19,110 --> 05:38:19,590
Yeah!

5281
05:38:22,590 --> 05:38:24,130
That's so hard to tell him.

5282
05:38:24,150 --> 05:38:25,430
I was actually doing anything.

5283
05:38:29,010 --> 05:38:29,270
Ow!

5284
05:38:32,090 --> 05:38:32,970
It's fine.

5285
05:38:34,890 --> 05:38:35,550
It's fine.

5286
05:38:35,690 --> 05:38:37,410
I don't really...

5287
05:38:37,410 --> 05:38:38,550
Like, what are you gonna do?

5288
05:38:38,810 --> 05:38:39,250
There's so...

5289
05:38:39,250 --> 05:38:40,890
It's such a long way to get to me.

5290
05:38:42,130 --> 05:38:44,290
Like, they have to walk so long.

5291
05:38:44,630 --> 05:38:45,350
So far.

5292
05:38:46,670 --> 05:38:47,710
I'm just gonna drop down.

5293
05:38:48,730 --> 05:38:50,510
Maybe if I just beam this guy down.

5294
05:38:51,290 --> 05:38:51,570
Alright.

5295
05:38:51,970 --> 05:38:52,190

5309
05:39:22,650 --> 05:39:23,410

05:39:38,560 --> 05:39:40,320
We're Call of Duty now.

5314
05:39:41,460 --> 05:39:44,360
The only issue is that I'm playing Call of Duty with a
handgun.

5315
05:39:45,420 --> 05:39:46,560
That's the only issue.

5316
05:39:49,220 --> 05:39:51,700

Where did all of them come from?

5322
05:40:10,240 --> 05:40:11,620
Okay, how strong is this?

5323
05:40:11,660 --> 05:40:12,860

5324
05:40:14,660 --> 05:40:15,360

5330
05:40:27,940 --> 05:40:28,380

5331
05:40:28,720 --> 05:40:29,860

5345
05:40:54,470 --> 05:40:55,170

05:50:05,690 --> 05:50:20,730
I fucking knew it I was like I knew it I fucking knew it I
was like body bag no there's no way there's a random fucking

5477
05:50:20,730 --> 05:50:34,970
pile of body bags here okay I'm just swinging around As if
there's nothing at all It's like there's wearing nothing at

5478
05:50:34,970 --> 05:50:55,810
all Alright I felt it Oh guys I felt it The repairs were
complete Were completed without issue Since the facility was

5479
05:50:55,810 --> 05:51:01,710
previously used for confinement, the work required to
reinforce the airtight ceiling was minimal.

5480
05:51:02,370 --> 05:51:08,690
As long as we don't run into any issues with the cooling
system test, we plan to bring in all the remaining specimens

5481
05:51:08,690 --> 05:51:10,990
from Facility 1.

5482
05:51:11,410 --> 05:51:13,850
All specimens were successfully transferred.

5483
05:51:14,210 --> 05:51:17,850
However, we experienced a slight hiccup during the transfer
as one of them became violent.

5484
05:51:18,330 --> 05:51:21,230
Luckily, the number of casualties was less than anticipated.

5485
05:51:21,750 --> 05:51:23,950
Please be extra careful when dealing with them.

5486
05:51:24,290 --> 05:51:28,330
They received reports that they are beginning to acquire a
tolerance to the low temperature.

5487
05:51:29,090 --> 05:51:29,610
Oh my god.

5488
05:51:29,870 --> 05:51:30,530
Bro, why?

5489
05:51:31,250 --> 05:51:32,370

05:51:34,290 --> 05:51:36,530
Do you really need to fuck me over even more?

5491
05:51:38,870 --> 05:51:40,070

05:51:44,970 --> 05:51:45,810

I lost the snake.

5508
05:53:22,870 --> 05:53:24,630
He just disappeared.

5509
05:53:26,450 --> 05:53:28,010
Where did he go?

5510
05:53:32,870 --> 05:53:34,270
Bro, he slithered out.

I think that's the worst part.

5517
05:54:15,470 --> 05:54:16,670
Is this noise?

5518
05:54:19,330 --> 05:54:19,590

5519
05:54:20,890 --> 05:54:21,550

There we go.

5522
05:54:27,650 --> 05:54:28,970
I think that's what I don't like.

5523
05:54:29,270 --> 05:54:29,750
Like, ah!

5524
05:54:30,450 --> 05:54:31,850

5527
05:54:36,730 --> 05:54:37,790
He bent his head.

05:54:38,910 --> 05:54:39,210
Oh!

5529
05:54:42,850 --> 05:54:43,510
Okay.

5530
05:54:43,910 --> 05:54:45,990
That was unfortunate.

5531
05:54:48,130 --> 05:54:49,530
There's no way that hits me.

5532
05:54:49,650 --> 05:54:50,710
Yeah, there's no way.

5533
05:54:52,930 --> 05:54:53,410
Okay.

5592
05:57:43,510 --> 05:57:43,770
What?

5593
05:57:44,290 --> 05:57:45,510
What do I not know?

5594
05:57:45,670 --> 05:57:46,350
What, guys?

5595
05:57:48,490 --> 05:57:50,150

05:57:50,890 --> 05:57:54,830
What do you mean?

5597
05:57:57,790 --> 05:57:59,390
What do you mean?

5598
05:57:59,630 --> 05:58:01,170
She doesn't know.

5599
05:58:01,430 --> 05:58:02,290
God damn it.

5600
05:58:02,790 --> 05:58:03,910
Don't tell it.

5601
05:58:04,270 --> 05:58:05,430
What do you... what?

5602
05:58:06,730 --> 05:58:07,850
I don't like this.

5603
05:58:08,990 --> 05:58:09,730
I don't like this.

5604
05:58:10,810 --> 05:58:13,070
I don't like how you're like she doesn't know.

5605
05:58:14,650 --> 05:58:16,790
I don't like this at all.

5606
05:58:19,110 --> 05:58:21,370
I don't like what that implies.

5607
05:58:23,030 --> 05:58:24,310
Why wouldn't I know?

5608
05:58:27,690 --> 05:58:29,890

05:58:41,790 --> 05:58:43,570
I hate this so much.

5612
05:58:46,030 --> 05:58:48,690
Oh no, where the fuck is the rocket launcher man?

5613
05:58:49,350 --> 05:58:50,910
Oh, I got the fish at least.

5614
05:58:51,710 --> 05:58:52,690
I got fish.

5615
05:58:53,370 --> 05:58:54,630
I got fish.

5616
05:58:57,770 --> 05:58:59,590
It's not important.

5617
05:59:00,370 --> 05:59:01,210
What do you mean?

5618
05:59:01,310 --> 05:59:02,930
I feel like it's very important.

5619
05:59:06,000 --> 05:59:07,200
Give me a break already.

5620
05:59:07,680 --> 05:59:09,340
I feel like it's so important.

5621
05:59:10,580 --> 05:59:11,060
How?

5622
05:59:14,160 --> 05:59:14,640
How?

5623
05:59:15,940 --> 05:59:16,920
Bro, I can't.

5624
05:59:20,700 --> 05:59:22,640
Oh my god, that's where you were.

5625
05:59:22,820 --> 05:59:23,500
Oh, my arm.

5626
05:59:23,520 --> 05:59:25,260
It does not look so well.

5627
05:59:27,780 --> 05:59:28,920
I don't feel fine.

5628
05:59:29,040 --> 05:59:30,180
I do not feel fine.

5629
05:59:30,360 --> 05:59:32,220
I do not feel fine at all.

5630
05:59:37,180 --> 05:59:37,580
Let's see.

5631
05:59:37,680 --> 05:59:39,200
I'm just going to make sure there's no bugs here.

5632
05:59:41,780 --> 05:59:42,600

5633
05:59:42,600 --> 05:59:42,960

05:59:50,140 --> 05:59:52,080

06:01:38,670 --> 06:01:40,130
If this was...

5657
06:01:40,130 --> 06:01:45,370
If this was stealth, I would not have to worry about all
these fucking people.

5658
06:01:48,970 --> 06:01:49,730

06:02:52,610 --> 06:02:53,570
Jesus Christ.

06:03:15,460 --> 06:03:15,880
We're okay.

5689
06:03:16,200 --> 06:03:17,020
We're okay.

06:03:19,040 --> 06:03:19,960

We're okay.

5693
06:03:23,220 --> 06:03:23,580

06:03:25,260 --> 06:03:25,660
We're okay.

5696
06:03:26,480 --> 06:03:27,900
We are alive.

5697
06:03:28,560 --> 06:03:29,960

Globy's lamb to join our covenant.

Why am I carrying her?

5738
06:07:19,200 --> 06:07:20,320

5739
06:07:28,140 --> 06:07:29,200
Oh, no.

5740

06:09:00,350 --> 06:09:02,350
Just go towards the light!

5757
06:09:04,810 --> 06:09:05,290
Go, Leah!

5758
06:09:05,410 --> 06:09:06,610
Go faster!

5759
06:09:07,990 --> 06:09:09,210
God damn it!

5760
06:09:09,470 --> 06:09:10,510
Leah, please!

5761
06:09:10,710 --> 06:09:11,590
She's not that heavy!

5762
06:09:11,830 --> 06:09:13,610
She's like a fucking teenager!

5763
06:09:14,330 --> 06:09:15,530
All right, yeah, I don't fucking know.

5764
06:09:15,550 --> 06:09:16,830
Oh, just go faster.

5765
06:09:17,970 --> 06:09:19,190
Leon, please!

5766
06:09:20,930 --> 06:09:22,530
You're tired?

5767
06:09:28,370 --> 06:09:33,590
You were never tired when you were fucking running for 20
years.

5768
06:09:37,990 --> 06:09:41,070
Oh my god, I have a one key.

5769
06:09:42,170 --> 06:09:43,390
Actually too heavy.

5770
06:09:45,650 --> 06:09:46,850
Oh, holy shit.

5771
06:09:48,070 --> 06:09:49,570
Get in there, Ashley.

5772
06:09:50,710 --> 06:09:51,350
You're home.

5773
06:09:52,610 --> 06:09:54,290
It has to be different.

5774
06:09:54,890 --> 06:09:55,650
Get in there.

5775
06:09:56,550 --> 06:09:57,050
Get in there.

5776
06:09:57,130 --> 06:09:57,890
Sit in the chair.

5777
06:09:58,770 --> 06:10:00,810
Sit in the fucking chair.

5778
06:10:09,190 --> 06:10:12,190
Like I told you, I'm gonna get you home safe.

5779
06:10:18,490 --> 06:10:20,390
Get in the robot, Ashley.

5780
06:10:23,690 --> 06:10:24,930
Don't worry, it's not gonna hurt.

5781
06:10:25,510 --> 06:10:29,400
we have no morphine to help you quit to help you not feel
pain

5782
06:10:32,450 --> 06:10:43,590
close your eyes ashley it won't it's only gonna hurt a
little bit we're gonna shoot the bus oh god

5783
06:10:46,830 --> 06:10:51,030
bro that's like so close to her heart bro

5784
06:11:01,390 --> 06:11:02,190
We did it!

5785
06:11:02,530 --> 06:11:02,530
Yay!

5786
06:11:04,410 --> 06:11:05,470
You're okay.

5787
06:11:20,250 --> 06:11:20,870
The end.

5788
06:11:21,710 --> 06:11:24,890
And thus Leon could never continue the bloodline.

5789
06:11:26,190 --> 06:11:27,070
Oh my god.

5790
06:11:27,890 --> 06:11:29,210
That level fucking sucked.

5791
06:11:35,290 --> 06:11:37,670
That level was fucking terrible.

5792
06:11:38,230 --> 06:11:39,790
That had to be the worst chapter.

5793
06:11:41,110 --> 06:11:42,830
That actually was the worst chapter.

5794
06:11:43,870 --> 06:11:51,110
Ashley I thought you were gonna die Okay

5795
06:11:56,330 --> 06:12:10,830
Not the bloodline You did this Yeah Yeah I did this Bro she
healed up so fast I like how Leon gets to have the procedure

5796
06:12:10,830 --> 06:12:18,290
while he's unconscious He had the privilege of being
unconscious For this entire thing

5797
06:12:21,550 --> 06:12:23,950
Hey We're a team, right?

5798
06:12:26,910 --> 06:12:27,590
Keep this up.

5799
06:12:28,230 --> 06:12:29,470
I'll be out of a job.

5800
06:12:31,350 --> 06:12:31,570
Oh, yeah.

5801
06:12:31,650 --> 06:12:33,510
How the fuck did Ashley put him on the chair?

5802
06:12:34,410 --> 06:12:35,670
Bro, what the fuck, Ashley?

5803
06:12:36,430 --> 06:12:38,110
We're fucking jacked.

5804
06:12:40,510 --> 06:12:43,450
There are two ways to eradicate Les Plagueis.

5805
06:12:43,870 --> 06:12:45,270
Antigen injection and surgery.

5806
06:12:45,650 --> 06:12:50,150
If the parasite is not hatched yet, it can be treated by
administrating antigen directly into the body.

5807
06:12:50,350 --> 06:12:57,410
Once it is hatched, however, there's not much that can be
done With surgery, the plaque can be targeted and killed

5808
06:12:57,410 --> 06:13:08,850
Using a certain wavelength of radiation That is That was a
lot of radiation Near the fucking heart This is not without

5809
06:13:08,850 --> 06:13:16,330
its risk Oh shit yeah It's a parasite has attached It's up
to the host's nervous system The host will experience

5810
06:13:16,330 --> 06:13:25,430
excruciating pain And there is no effective anesthesia For
this kind of procedure Surgical removal carries considerable

5811
06:13:25,430 --> 06:13:28,610
risk even before the parasite is fully developed.

5812
06:13:29,250 --> 06:13:34,030
Once fully grown, however, if it is too late, removing the
parasite will kill the host.

5813
06:13:34,490 --> 06:13:37,810
But considering what will happen to them, death may be a
mercy.

5814
06:13:38,410 --> 06:13:39,290
This was Luis.

5815
06:13:40,870 --> 06:13:42,310
Yeah, we're alive.

5816
06:13:42,590 --> 06:13:43,650
Thank you, Luis.

5817
06:13:44,050 --> 06:13:45,470
He's alive too, by the way.

5818
06:13:45,690 --> 06:13:46,290
Oh, there is.

5819
06:13:46,430 --> 06:13:46,850
Umbrella.

5820
06:13:48,290 --> 06:13:49,030
Oh, there's Luis!

5821
06:13:49,650 --> 06:13:50,770
There he is!

5822
06:13:53,110 --> 06:13:53,670
Bro.

5823
06:13:53,970 --> 06:14:01,930
i bet the guy that opened that umbrella is fucking dead all
right what's this do we not be fooled into thinking that les

5824
06:14:01,930 --> 06:14:10,090
plagues are merely tools for creating powerful bio weapons
the true value lies in their ability to control no matter

5825
06:14:10,090 --> 06:14:16,010
how hostile a subject a single injection can turn anyone
into a faithful servant who needs spies when you turn

5826
06:14:16,010 --> 06:14:23,510
yesterday's enemy into today's ally controlling just one
insider can bring an entire organization an entire country

5827
06:14:23,510 --> 06:14:31,430
to its knees mass production of the superior species has
made this possible we have empowered sadler it is clear what

5828
06:14:31,430 --> 06:14:39,730
he intends to do next can you imagine if sadler had that
much control six billion loyal servants at his sole command

5829
06:14:39,730 --> 06:14:48,610
there will be no opposition no war that's not bad no war
maybe for the first time in human yeah see in human history

5830
06:14:51,450 --> 06:14:57,970
and the others have oppressed the people of this island for
generations i know how he treats them there's no way to live

5831
06:14:57,970 --> 06:15:07,410
and because of that i won't let it happen yeah but like not
the most uncomfortable places but like if it's like one

5832
06:15:07,410 --> 06:15:15,050
person you know like one like you you wouldn't care when you
get control even booted up oh god you know how old this pc

5833
06:15:15,050 --> 06:15:16,210
is What the fuck?

5834
06:15:16,330 --> 06:15:17,690
Look how thick that PC is.

5835
06:15:19,310 --> 06:15:20,270
Look how thick it is.

5836
06:15:21,230 --> 06:15:25,310
This sample, which I've come to call the amber, was just
sitting in the storeroom collecting dust.

5837
06:15:25,910 --> 06:15:31,530
We used to have ample specimens for experimentation in the
past, so it makes sense that this one was overlooked.

5838
06:15:32,270 --> 06:15:36,670
In fact, the only reason I brought it back in my lab was
because of its peculiar shape.

5839
06:15:37,390 --> 06:15:39,950
After a basic analysis, I've changed my mind.

5840
06:15:40,490 --> 06:15:42,990
The amber possesses a very unique quality.

5841
06:15:45,510 --> 06:15:53,230
say it contains the same organ found in a dominant species
which we've only seen in sadler himself when fully developed

5842
06:15:53,230 --> 06:16:01,090
the amber may rev may rival or perhaps even surpass sadler's
power oh this is the one this was the one that was in in

5843
06:16:01,090 --> 06:16:08,550
ashley unfortunately the amber was confiscated by sadler
before i can make any further progress in my research he may

5844
06:16:08,550 --> 06:16:15,450
be on to me i need to get my hands on that sample again and
escape in order to continue my research elsewhere it's the

5845
06:16:15,510 --> 06:16:16,950
only way to counter Sadler.

5846
06:16:17,870 --> 06:16:20,850
Of course, I don't think I can trust this outside group
either.

5847
06:16:21,490 --> 06:16:22,970
But I've already come this far.

5848
06:16:23,730 --> 06:16:26,110
Hopefully I can sweet talk my way out of this one too.

5849
06:16:26,610 --> 06:16:28,750
I'll have to for the world's sake.

5850
06:16:29,470 --> 06:16:30,090
Jesus Christ!

5851
06:16:31,230 --> 06:16:33,790
Lewis, keep all your notes in one area!

5852
06:16:39,890 --> 06:16:44,450
Lewis, why are your notes fucking spread to like four PCs?

5853
06:16:44,450 --> 06:16:44,930
Please!

5854
06:16:50,490 --> 06:16:53,530
All of Lewis's notes are scattered everywhere.

5855
06:16:55,770 --> 06:16:57,550
Keep it in one PC, Lewis!

5856
06:17:01,490 --> 06:17:02,770
Alright, here we go.

5857
06:17:03,750 --> 06:17:04,670

I'm so fine.

5864
06:17:57,220 --> 06:17:58,280
I'm so okay.

5865
06:17:58,460 --> 06:18:00,140
Just a little radiation in my heart.

5866
06:18:01,200 --> 06:18:01,860
That's okay.

5867
06:18:04,200 --> 06:18:05,560
Doesn't hurt nobody.

5868
06:18:09,060 --> 06:18:09,520
Oh, yeah.

5869
06:18:09,920 --> 06:18:10,920
Oh, no.

5870
06:18:11,460 --> 06:18:13,540
Why do I have to bring up my rifle?

5871
06:18:19,690 --> 06:18:20,250
Why?

5872
06:18:23,090 --> 06:18:24,550
This is where you died.

5873
06:18:25,550 --> 06:18:26,370
You think she's all right?

5874
06:18:26,450 --> 06:18:36,410
Oh, I'm sure she's fine She's not the type to roll over that
easy Yeah, don't worry The effects will show up in like 10

5875
06:18:36,410 --> 06:18:41,550
to 15 years And maybe by then we'll find a cure Right,
Ashley?

5876
06:18:45,370 --> 06:18:45,650
Whoa

5877
06:18:52,170 --> 06:18:59,470
Okay I just want to make sure How do I get over there?

5878
06:19:00,270 --> 06:19:00,710
Yeah?

5879
06:19:01,050 --> 06:19:02,010
Oh, sorry, yellow paint.

5880
06:19:03,110 --> 06:19:04,730
I see the yellow paint now.

5881
06:19:08,260 --> 06:19:08,800
What cure?

5882
06:19:09,000 --> 06:19:09,580
I don't know.

5883
06:19:09,660 --> 06:19:13,220
What do you guys think is going to happen when you have all
that radiation in your heart, chat?

5884
06:19:15,340 --> 06:19:16,580
Do I really need that treasure?

5885
06:19:18,040 --> 06:19:19,320
Do I care enough?

5886
06:19:23,660 --> 06:19:27,700
Do I really care enough about that fucking treasure, chat?

5887
06:19:29,440 --> 06:19:29,880
Fine.

5888
06:19:30,520 --> 06:19:31,380
Super heart?

5889
06:19:31,880 --> 06:19:33,280
That's how you get superpowers.

5890
06:19:33,600 --> 06:19:34,620
You don't understand.

5891
06:19:43,290 --> 06:19:45,150
That's how superpowers work.

5892
06:19:47,730 --> 06:19:48,610
Wait, which one was it?

5893
06:19:48,690 --> 06:19:49,270
Is it...

5894
06:19:49,270 --> 06:19:51,550
Okay, it's this.

5895
06:19:51,630 --> 06:19:52,550
This is what I'm looking at.

5896
06:19:52,790 --> 06:19:53,170
There we go.

5897
06:19:53,610 --> 06:19:54,570
Yeah, what the fuck?

5898
06:19:54,690 --> 06:19:56,130
I swear I shot that.

5899
06:19:58,470 --> 06:19:58,970
Okay.

5900
06:20:00,730 --> 06:20:02,550
That superheroes taught us.

5901
06:20:03,250 --> 06:20:04,230
Please do not...

5902
06:20:04,230 --> 06:20:07,190
Guys, I don't think that's what's gonna happen.

5903
06:20:09,430 --> 06:20:11,850
Praise be to the holy insect.

5904
06:20:12,030 --> 06:20:13,670
Lord Kurosus, thank you for the super chat.

5905
06:20:13,850 --> 06:20:14,010
Thank you.

Thank you.

5907
06:20:14,670 --> 06:20:15,210
Superpowers.

5908
06:20:15,370 --> 06:20:18,910
How else do you explain Chris Redfield's ability to punch
boulders?

5909
06:20:19,570 --> 06:20:21,150
Women promise paradise on earth.

5910
06:20:21,730 --> 06:20:23,430
Man, women, or child.

5911
06:20:23,830 --> 06:20:25,190
His love does not discriminate.

5912
06:20:26,010 --> 06:20:30,590
Beast, fish, or bird, or creature, all creatures shall be
equally blessed.

5913
06:20:31,410 --> 06:20:33,490
Praise be to the holy insects.

5914
06:20:34,010 --> 06:20:36,090
We are the humble servants of God.

5915
06:20:38,330 --> 06:20:47,150
any mountain his omnipotence will um will cross any ocean
the light of heaven dwells in all things let our bodies be

Big fan.

5919
06:21:12,130 --> 06:21:13,690
I love you and Hansel and Gretel.

5920
06:21:14,350 --> 06:21:15,810
I actually watched that movie.

5921
06:21:22,210 --> 06:21:24,510
I actually watched it.

5922
06:21:24,890 --> 06:21:25,450
I actually watched it.

5923
06:21:25,450 --> 06:21:27,710
I watched that twin movie from Adam Sandler.

5924
06:21:31,780 --> 06:21:32,460
No way.

5925
06:21:33,020 --> 06:21:34,300
Unfortunately, yes.

5926
06:21:35,540 --> 06:21:37,720
Unfortunately, yes way.

5927
06:21:41,840 --> 06:21:45,600
I have watched a lot of really bad movies.

5928
06:21:48,620 --> 06:21:53,140
And I mean a lot of bad movies.

5929
06:21:54,700 --> 06:21:55,260
Why?

5930
06:21:56,140 --> 06:21:57,840
Look, I watched...

5931
06:21:58,720 --> 06:22:04,520
I paid for movie tickets to movies that I should not have
paid for.

5932
06:22:06,820 --> 06:22:11,220
Because, like, back in those days, you would see the
trailers on TV.

5933
06:22:11,840 --> 06:22:20,360
and stuff and all your thinking was like it can't be that
bad whoa and then like you and your parents would just be

5934
06:22:20,360 --> 06:22:27,860
like the one of the 10 people at the theater watching that
movie there was this movie with god what was it like this

I did it.

5943
06:23:46,610 --> 06:23:47,170
Alright, let's see.

5944
06:23:47,470 --> 06:23:48,890
I still... Oh, wait, I do have it.

5945
06:23:48,990 --> 06:23:49,750
Alright, might as well.

5946
06:23:50,290 --> 06:23:51,590
I might as well max it up.

5947
06:23:53,690 --> 06:23:55,010
Okay, I maxed it up.

5948
06:23:55,110 --> 06:23:55,770
And then...

5949
06:23:55,770 --> 06:23:56,870
I might as well get the...

5950
06:23:58,390 --> 06:24:01,530
I don't really care about the gun and, like, this gun.

5951
06:24:01,650 --> 06:24:03,210
I might as well upgrade this.

5952
06:24:05,330 --> 06:24:06,050
Animal capacity.

5953
06:24:06,190 --> 06:24:07,510
I don't have that much ammo.

5954
06:24:08,390 --> 06:24:10,150
So I'll just... I'll just do ammo capacity.

5955
06:24:12,430 --> 06:24:12,790
Boop!

5956
06:24:12,790 --> 06:24:13,370
There we go.

5957
06:24:13,490 --> 06:24:15,150
I mean, I could do one.

5958
06:24:15,390 --> 06:24:15,510
Yeah.

5959
06:24:17,230 --> 06:24:17,830
Alright.

5960
06:24:19,550 --> 06:24:20,410
Right enough.

5961
06:24:20,650 --> 06:24:21,790
Reload speed.

5962
06:24:22,750 --> 06:24:23,850
Radar fire.

5963
06:24:24,090 --> 06:24:24,530
Might as well.

5964
06:24:24,650 --> 06:24:25,370
Alright, that's good.

5965
06:24:27,410 --> 06:24:29,610
Alright, let's figure out the inventory.

5966
06:24:30,570 --> 06:24:31,170
Situation.

5967
06:24:35,910 --> 06:24:36,290
Okay.

5968
06:24:36,790 --> 06:24:37,130
Nice.

5969
06:24:38,550 --> 06:24:41,530
I might as well use my spinners too.

5970
06:24:42,230 --> 06:24:43,350
Alright, what do I need?

5971
06:24:43,490 --> 06:24:46,290
Uh, 23.

5972
06:24:47,070 --> 06:24:49,570
Uh, gunpowder.

5973
06:24:50,150 --> 06:24:57,090
I guess I could get the chip.

5974
06:24:57,590 --> 06:24:58,250
Oh my god.

5975
06:24:58,830 --> 06:24:59,210
These are...

5976
06:24:59,210 --> 06:25:00,510
Oh my god, I could have...

5977
06:25:02,370 --> 06:25:06,090
There's some things money can't buy.

5978
06:25:06,410 --> 06:25:10,630
I could have bought the challenge.

5979
06:25:15,850 --> 06:25:23,410
oh my god god fucking damn it how do i keep doing this to
myself

5980
06:25:30,650 --> 06:25:43,730
oh it's fine we don't reload anything we live we live with
our bad decisions chat we have to live with our bad

5981
06:25:43,730 --> 06:25:45,110
decisions in life.

5982
06:25:48,770 --> 06:25:51,250
Oh my god, I'm so stupid.

5983
06:25:51,610 --> 06:25:54,070
I'm so stupid.

5984
06:26:01,630 --> 06:26:03,150
Look where?

5985
06:26:04,150 --> 06:26:04,690
Look what?

5986
06:26:05,550 --> 06:26:06,890
What am I looking at?

5987
06:26:07,630 --> 06:26:08,050
What?

5988
06:26:09,850 --> 06:26:10,610
What?

5989
06:26:10,750 --> 06:26:11,590
Oh, this!

5990
06:26:11,590 --> 06:26:14,470
I was like, who, where?

5991
06:26:18,980 --> 06:26:19,540
Okay.

5992
06:26:22,820 --> 06:26:24,140
Is that, I'm like, huh?

5993
06:26:25,180 --> 06:26:27,460
All right, before we're going to look at her.

5994
06:26:28,040 --> 06:26:29,080
And then we use the bathroom.

5995
06:26:30,160 --> 06:26:31,160
Okay, I'll be right back.

5996
06:26:31,300 --> 06:26:32,420
Last bathroom break.

5997

6062
06:34:22,170 --> 06:34:23,990
It was possible.

6063
06:34:40,100 --> 06:34:40,580
Oh, fuck.

6064
06:34:44,110 --> 06:34:46,070
One last shank for the ride.

6065
06:34:50,100 --> 06:34:50,880
Goodbye, Adam Sandler.

6066
06:34:51,140 --> 06:34:52,900
Your Netflix deals are over.

6067
06:34:58,270 --> 06:35:00,730

6069
06:35:03,830 --> 06:35:04,350
Hello, Ada.

God,

6071
06:35:13,570 --> 06:35:15,930
I hate her voice acting in this one.

6072
06:35:17,530 --> 06:35:19,510
It's just so dead inside.

6073
06:35:21,030 --> 06:35:24,830
Like, I guess she's supposed to be dead inside, but still.

6074
06:35:27,630 --> 06:35:29,590
She's like mega dead inside.

6075
06:35:30,630 --> 06:35:34,170
I think we both know this is where we go our separate ways.

6076
06:35:34,490 --> 06:35:37,350

Move!

6105
06:37:36,180 --> 06:37:40,000
Ashley, I would love it if you could help out.

6106
06:37:43,460 --> 06:37:46,360
Thank you for watching, Ashley.

6107
06:37:46,700 --> 06:37:47,100
All right.

6108
06:37:47,940 --> 06:37:48,720

You're gonna love this.

6111
06:38:00,690 --> 06:38:01,850
Wait, what?

6113
06:38:06,290 --> 06:38:08,110
What do you mean?

6114
06:38:08,330 --> 06:38:09,430
I still have...

6115
06:38:09,430 --> 06:38:10,790
Where's my cutscene?

6116
06:38:13,130 --> 06:38:15,330
No cutscene for me, I guess.

6117
06:38:16,070 --> 06:38:16,350
Ow!

6118
06:38:16,510 --> 06:38:17,070
Oh, fuck.

6119
06:38:17,210 --> 06:38:18,750
Oh, oh, this is not good.

6120
06:38:19,530 --> 06:38:19,890
This is...

6121
06:38:20,930 --> 06:38:21,050
What?

6122
06:38:25,430 --> 06:38:28,310
The slowest fucking jump to that ramp.

6123
06:38:30,170 --> 06:38:32,910
Oh my god, I can't believe no cutscene privileges.

6124
06:38:34,610 --> 06:38:36,710
No cutscene privileges for me.

6125
06:38:37,370 --> 06:38:37,750
Whoa!

6126
06:38:39,570 --> 06:38:42,810
Oh god, oh shit, oh shit, oh we're dead.

6127
06:38:43,330 --> 06:38:44,070
Actually, this is it.

6128
06:38:44,530 --> 06:38:45,730
Actually, I fucked up.

6129
06:38:46,450 --> 06:38:47,810
Please, please tell me this is the end.

6130
06:38:51,930 --> 06:38:53,890
Oh god, oh this is so bad.

6131
06:38:56,650 --> 06:38:58,270
Actually, the boat is 1 HP.

6132
06:39:02,530 --> 06:39:05,030
We are one hit, guys.

6133
06:39:07,890 --> 06:39:10,190
We are one hit.

6134
06:39:11,750 --> 06:39:11,810
Woo!

6135
06:39:17,130 --> 06:39:18,710
Oh, crap!

6136
06:39:22,070 --> 06:39:24,390
We were

6137
06:39:36,130 --> 06:39:36,710
1 HP.

6138
06:39:40,790 --> 06:39:42,750
I'm not sure that was insane.

6139
06:39:45,110 --> 06:39:46,190
We did it.

6140
06:39:46,330 --> 06:39:46,590
