1
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,500
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,160
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:57,980
Yes, what a surprise, because it's like, why would Dookie put Street Fighter 6?

4
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,700
Like, why would she stream Street Fighter 6 so willingly?

5
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
Like, wow!

6
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,740
Could it be that she ends the Sajam Slam again?

7
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,260
Yes, that is right.

8
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,560
I will be participating in Sajam Slam 3.

9
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,440
For the Street Fighter 6 arc.

10
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,620
Yes, we're back in our FGC arc, guys.

11
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,220
Okay, I just need you guys to know how we're so fucked.

12
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:35,820
Like, the moment I got into the server, the Discord server, everybody was playing.

13
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,940
By the way, I didn't buy Street Fighter until like last night, by the way.

14
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,640
But yes, for like, I saw Street Fighter.

15
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,320
So many people just grinding Street Fighter for like the entire, like, week.

16
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,940
And I'm like, okay.

17
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,520
I'm so fucked.

18
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,980
Like, we all know I'm gonna be in the beginners category.

19
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,960
But do you also know who else is gonna be in the beginners category?

20
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,880
Yes, SK and Goomy.

21
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,640
They're back.

22
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,180
They're gonna be back in the beginners category.

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,900
And I'm like, I was like talking to Sajam about it.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,880
I was like, for those who don't know, I was in the last Sajam Slam for Tekken.

25
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
And, you know, we won.

26
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,920
We got champion.

27
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,000
We won.

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,060
And one of the victories that got us to the final, like, got us the first place was that I beat SK.

29
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,020
And like, I basically beat the fan favorite that was supposed to actually win.

30
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,180
And I still don't know how.

31
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,080
I still don't know how.

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,660
SK, she kept playing Tekken right after.

33
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,420
I haven't.

34
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,240
Guys, ever since the last Sajam Slam, I have not touched Tekken since then.

35
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
But SK has.

36
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,880
I was like, oh yeah, Sajam, do you know, like, who else is gonna be, like, beginners?

37
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,200
And then he was like, oh yeah, you know, SK and Goomy are back.

38
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,940
And I'm like, okay, wait a minute.

39
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,400
I'm just like, okay, wait a minute.

40
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:11,680
Wait a minute.

41
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,440
Okay.

42
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:24,460
And I was like, wait, isn't that a little, you know, you know, like, Goomy, yeah, she's the beginner.

43
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,120
But like, SK kept going.

44
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,720
I mean, she kept going.

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,700
And then Sajam was like, oh yeah, but like, you know, they're still beginners in Street Fighter.

46
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,420
And I was like, yeah, but they're fucking grinders.

47
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,660
I don't, I don't even know if I have time for that.

48
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,700
Like...

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,460
They're just gonna be...

50
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,960
Even during Tekken, all they did was grind Tekken.

51
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,660
I just learned...

52
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,440
I just know five moves.

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,700
And I'll...

54
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,900
My entire strategy...

55
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:05,100
My entire strategy going into the last Sajam Slam was four moves.

56
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,240
And then during the tournament, I learned a fifth move.

57
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,640
And I think a sixth.

58
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,040
I don't remember.

59
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,220
I learned a fifth move during the tournament.

60
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,580
I literally have a 38 in defense.

61
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,900
So...

62
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,500
So I was just like...

63
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,680
I was like, oh no.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,860
I'm gonna have to fight her again.

65
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm gonna have to fight...

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,640
Fight the same people again.

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,960
So yes.

68
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,440
The reason why, for those who don't know.

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,000
The reason why I am playing Street Fighter VI.

70
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,340
I'm streaming Street Fighter VI.

71
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,240
Is that I got invited to do a Sajam Slam.

72
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,320
We're running it back.

73
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,580
I want you guys to know.

74
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,620
Also, like, give me a sec.

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,640
My soundproof thing fell, fell off.

76
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,520
I need to get like an adhesive spray.

77
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,020
There's this one corner in my room.

78
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,240
It just always falls.

79
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,900
It's so annoying.

80
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,560
Like the...

81
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,480
Like the...

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,020
I use the...

83
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,620
Oh my god.

84
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:07,980
It fell.

85
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,720
It fell while I was trying to...

86
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,640
Give me a sec.

87
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,640
It fell while I was ranting about it.

88
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,620
And plugged it in.

89
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,440
Okay.

90
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,240
Alright.

91
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,180
I need to grab like an adhesive spray.

92
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:18,980
Yes.

93
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,940
Of course I'm gonna play Modern.

94
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,680
Guys.

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
I've literally...

96
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,720
I literally found out that there was like two different sets of controls.

97
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,800
Like I...

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,040
We're not super gluing.

99
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,420
Cause I...

100
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,500
I don't own this place.

101
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm ranting.

102
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,800
Also, Scott.

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,580
Thank you for the super chat.

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:32,840
Thank you.

105
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,340
Thank you.

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,380
I'm so happy you're playing this.

107
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,420
And on my birthday.

108
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
I hope you have fun.

109
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,960
Thank you.

110
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,680
Thank you for the super chat.

111
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:37,980
Thank you.

112
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,460
Thank you.

113
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,960
Happy birthday to you.

114
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,480
Happy birthday to you.

115
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,860
Happy birthday dear Scott.

116
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,400
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,800
Yeah.

118
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,980
Anyway.

119
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,520
Yes.

120
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,200
Of course.

121
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,180
I'm gonna do Modern.

122
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,880
Like...

123
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,040
I literally found out what the difference was between Modern and Classic.

124
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,800
Like...

125
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,920
I think like an hour before the stream.

126
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,320
And I was like...

127
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,300
Why is there two sets?

128
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,360
Why is there two sets?

129
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,120
It's a Contrast.

130
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,280
Um...

131
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,740
And then...

132
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,660
Um...

133
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,860
And then they were like...

134
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,220
Oh yeah.

135
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,760
Like...

136
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,200
You know...

137
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,180
Modern is for the beginners.

138
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,800
And I was like...

139
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:13,940
Yep.

140
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,280
That's me.

141
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm...

142
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,840
I don't need any ego or anything.

143
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,180
Um...

144
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm just...

145
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm...

146
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,980
All I'm saying...

147
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,220
It's like...

148
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,640
I don't care.

149
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,100
Like...

150
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,360
You're like...

151
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,580
Oh...

152
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,640
You're gonna be a Modern player.

153
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,440
I don't fucking care.

154
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:24,900
Like...

155
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,540
I am going in with zero experience of Street Fighter.

156
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,160
I have a...

157
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,440
I have an excuse to do Modern controls.

158
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,420
Like...

159
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,540
I'm going in there with zero experience with Street Fighter.

160
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,540
Like...

161
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm not gonna make myself have a more...

162
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,180
A terrible time.

163
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,960
I heard Classic has like 200,500,000 moves.

164
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,460
Modern is just like...

165
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:52,680
You know...

166
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,340
Half of that.

167
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,980
And you know...

168
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,800
That's still a lot.

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,880
But like...

170
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,440
It's...

171
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,880
It's at least less than that.

172
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,300
Like...

173
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,260
So apparently...

174
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,560
I found out...

175
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,800
That...

176
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,500
The...

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,560
Difference...

178
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,500
Between...

179
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,760
Uh...

180
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
Modern and Classic...

181
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,520
Is that Classic players have to do...

182
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,540
More moves...

183
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,080
And you have to do more inputs...

184
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,040
But Modern...

185
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,620
Has something...

186
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,400
What I like...

187
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,760
Called...

188
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,940
Auto combos...

189
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,040
And like...

190
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,580
You know...

191
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,980
I like that.

192
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
I like automatic stuff.

193
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,940
Like...

194
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,860
The future is now.

195
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,620
We're not here...

196
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,740
To go back...

197
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,900
Into the prehistoric times.

198
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,700
This is...

199
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,100
I...

200
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,500
I don't need an ego boost...

201
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,920
To be like...

202
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,140
Yeah...

203
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm a Classic player.

204
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,720
I am here...

205
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,740
To like...

206
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,080
Uh...

207
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,720
You know...

208
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,580
I...

209
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,620
I am...

210
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,400
I am baby.

211
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,480
I...

212
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,240
I know my place...

213
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
In this world.

214
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,840
I am literally...

215
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,500
A baby.

216
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,840
The only Street Fighter experience...

217
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,580
I have...

218
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,420
Is...

219
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:45,840
Uh...

220
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,820
Street Fight...

221
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,100
Like...

222
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,000
Is Marvel vs.

223
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,580
Capcom.

224
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,180
I've never played...

225
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,740
Uh...

226
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:50,980
We're...

227
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,820
I've never played a Street Fighter game.

228
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,480
So...

229
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,540
This is where I'm...

230
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,520
I know where my place is at.

231
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,720
But...

232
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,740
Doki not a real game, man.

233
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,580
Look...

234
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,020
I don't tell you guys.

235
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,380
You've seen my controls in Tekken.

236
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,700
Like...

237
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,420
You know I have no idea what I'm doing.

238
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,320
I...

239
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,740
Uh...

240
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,300
Don't worry.

241
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,540
I do not feel bad using modern controls.

242
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,580
Like...

243
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,100
I know my...

244
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,580
I know...

245
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,560
The thing is...

246
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,640
I have no reason to be an elitist.

247
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,500
Because I'm a...

248
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm a fucking baby.

249
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,400
I know my place.

250
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,540
I'm literally...

251
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm not even in Kindergarten.

252
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm not even in preschool.

253
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm still in the womb.

254
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
I'm like still in the FGC womb.

255
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,620
Okay.

256
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,920
Alright.

257
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,840
I also want you guys to know...

258
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,240
I almost dropped out.

259
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,020
I was...

260
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,280
I was literally...

261
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,260
This close...

262
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,360
To dropping out of the CHM Slam.

263
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,480
And...

264
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
The only reason I dropped out of the CHM Slam...

265
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:06,800
The only reason why I wanted to drop out was because the timing for the Slam was so bad for like everybody in Team Brawl Pro.

266
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Like literally...

267
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,640
Like...

268
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,900
Brawl Pro stayed in the tournament because of me.

269
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,560
Cause...

270
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,660
And I stayed in the tournament because of Brawl Pro.

271
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,800
Cause I was like...

272
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,320
Cause...

273
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,660
Like...

274
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,420
Everybody was so busy.

275
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,620
Um...

276
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,200
Everybody was like super busy for like in Team Brawl Pro for the tournament.

277
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,200
And...

278
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,040
Um...

279
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,180
And it was just so bad.

280
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,500
Like...

281
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,820
Literally...

282
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,780
Kony DM'ed me two weeks ago.

283
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
And was like...

284
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,220
I can't wait to be on the same team again, Doki.

285
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,140
Yeah!

286
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
And then...

287
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,920
And then...

288
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,960
Last week...

289
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,000
I got another message.

290
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,760
It was like...

291
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,220
Oh, fuck.

292
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,220
I can't do it.

293
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,660
And I was like...

294
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:42,900
No!

295
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,220
What?

296
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,300
What do you mean?

297
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,000
He was like...

298
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,260
Oh...

299
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,620
I can't...

300
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
I can't do it.

301
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,520
It's during like literally his vacation.

302
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,820
Um...

303
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,920
It's like vacation days.

304
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,020
And he has a child.

305
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,760
Like...

306
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,400
Some of the...

307
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,380
My team members...

308
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,860
From Team Brawl Pro...

309
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,780
They're like...

310
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,760
Actual dads.

311
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,660
Or like...

312
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:02,980
Old.

313
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,020
So like...

314
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,420
Um...

315
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,960
So like...

316
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,720
He couldn't like...

317
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,540
Cancel his vacation.

318
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,600
Because he has a child.

319
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,460
It's not like he could be like...

320
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:10,760
Yay!

321
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,960
I'm gonna cancel this vacation and play video games instead.

322
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
Or that child's gonna grow up with daddy issues.

323
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,400
So like...

324
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,920
Obviously...

325
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,080
He couldn't do that...

326
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,620
To the kid.

327
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,660
Um...

328
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,180
He has to spend time with his kid.

329
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,140
So...

330
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,460
Um...

331
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,460
So he couldn't make it.

332
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,560
Similar with like...

333
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,340
Slime and Matt.

334
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,620
They actually had like...

335
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,220
Something...

336
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,020
Around...

337
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,820
These times.

338
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,380
So like...

339
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,740
Um...

340
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,160
Yeah.

341
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,900
He has to be like a responsible father.

342
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,940
I know it's...

343
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,460
It's hard to...

344
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
It's hard to see that.

345
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,120
Because you know...

346
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,280
It's...

347
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,500
I know it's very rough to imagine.

348
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,800
Because some of our dads are still trying to get milk.

349
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,600
And stuff.

350
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,340
Um...

351
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,540
Um...

352
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,360
Anyway.

353
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,420
Similar with like...

354
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,460
Matt and Slime.

355
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,740
They actually had...

356
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,200
Like...

357
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,100
It was literally like...

358
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,800
The same...

359
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,620
Um...

360
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,100
What...

361
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,760
They had like...

362
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
Prior obligations.

363
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,560
Um...

364
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,820
Um...

365
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,780
So they can't...

366
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,180
Do Sajam Slam.

367
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,460
And I...

368
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,140
I was this close.

369
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,820
I was like...

370
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,780
I was like...

371
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,400
I...

372
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,680
I...

373
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,260
I know...

374
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,520
Okay.

375
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,160
So like...

376
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,500
It was...

377
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,880
It was such a hard decision.

378
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,860
Like...

379
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,180
Like...

380
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,480
Um...

381
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,220
Because you guys know.

382
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,600
I...

383
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,140
I signed up for the Slam.

384
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,160
Only because like...

385
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,480
I wanted to run it back.

386
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,160
With...

387
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,060
Team ProlPro.

388
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,320
And I've been saying that since the last Slam.

389
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,600
Like...

390
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,900
I was like...

391
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,040
Okay.

392
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,500
I'll...

393
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,620
I'll come back if like...

394
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,440
We're all back together.

395
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,080
Tight deal.

396
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,940
Because like...

397
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,380
It was like...

398
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,160
It was so fun.

399
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,600
You know?

400
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,200
Like...

401
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,660
Um...

402
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,320
And then...

403
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,180
Like...

404
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,360
Like...

405
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,020
Before like...

406
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,420
Uh...

407
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,240
Before we like...

408
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
Knew what the schedule was like.

409
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,880
Matt and I were both like...

410
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,340
Oh...

411
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,580
I don't want to make new friends.

412
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm scared.

413
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,420
I don't know anybody.

414
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,140
And I'm like...

415
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,820
What if we don't vibe with the new people?

416
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,400
I...

417
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,860
I was like...

418
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,580
I was so anxious and scared.

419
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,340
Because I was like...

420
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,500
Oh...

421
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm nervous.

422
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,140
Like...

423
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,660
Ah...

424
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,000
Like...

425
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,020
I knew how Team ProlPro was gonna be like.

426
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,620
Before.

427
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,320
Like...

428
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,020
When I picked...

429
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,400
Like...

430
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,500
I wanted ProlPro as my coach.

431
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,220
Because I knew what that team was like.

432
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,060
Uh...

433
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,420
Before.

434
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,480
Uh...

435
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,380
Because I watched their vibes from the first Slam.

436
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,460
So I knew like...

437
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,360
Our vibes...

438
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,860
Would like...

439
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,500
Match up.

440
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,560
And I've known about them for like...

441
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,280
About them individually.

442
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,140
In like...

443
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,820
The streaming community.

444
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,140
But for this one...

445
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,740
I'm really scared.

446
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,820
I have no idea who...

447
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,840
A lot of these people are.

448
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,600
Like...

449
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,020
I...

450
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,540
I...

451
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:24,620
I...

452
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:24,760
I...

453
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,000
I think like...

454
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,180
I...

455
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,540
I...

456
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,180
I don't know who like...

457
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,040
90% of people are...

458
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,200
In the Sajam Slam.

459
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,900
So I'm like...

460
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,000
So anxious and everything.

461
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,320
Because I was just like...

462
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,020
Oh my god.

463
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,440
Ah...

464
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,500
I have to...

465
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,120
Meet new people.

466
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,760
What if we don't vibe?

467
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,960
What if we don't vibe?

468
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,540
What if we don't vibe?

469
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,320
I know...

470
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,980
Uh...

471
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,600
Brawlpo...

472
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
We requested each other.

473
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,400
And Sajam told me...

474
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,820
They're gonna...

475
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,120
He's gonna put both of us together.

476
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,160
Um...

477
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,020
So like...

478
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,420
Uh...

479
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,900
So like...

480
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,160
We're both gonna be on the same team.

481
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,660
So like...

482
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,380
We don't have to worry about that.

483
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:57,860
Like...

484
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,020
We literally stayed...

485
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,500
We literally stayed in the tournament.

486
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,440
Because like...

487
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,040
Um...

488
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,940
Because like...

489
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,220
Uh...

490
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,480
Like Brawlpo was actually...

491
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,660
I think like Brawlpo was one...

492
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,120
Was thinking about dropping out as well.

493
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,220
And then...

494
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,960
He was like...

495
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,260
Okay.

496
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,680
I'll stay.

497
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,540
If you're staying.

498
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,240
And I was like...

499
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,380
Oh...

500
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay.

501
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,880
I guess we're both staying.

502
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,520
Okay.

503
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,240
I guess...

504
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,340
I guess we're both staying.

505
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:24,860
And...

506
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,040
Um...

507
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,060
But yes.

508
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,780
I was like...

509
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,580
I was super...

510
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,760
Nervous and stuff.

511
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,820
And...

512
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,320
Um...

513
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm just really anxious now.

514
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,840
When it comes to like...

515
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,880
Meeting new people.

516
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,960
So I'm always like...

517
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,760
Super hesitant about it.

518
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,280
Even my like...

519
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,080
My manager team was...

520
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,520
My manager team was like...

521
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,540
Oh maybe...

522
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,800
I mean...

523
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,940
If you're really stressed out about it...

524
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,600
Maybe you should drop out.

525
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,220
And then...

526
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,020
But I...

527
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,100
I decided to stay though.

528
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,340
I decided to stay...

529
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,960
Uh...

530
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,000
Because I know...

531
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,680
How much like...

532
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,700
My Dragoons were really...

533
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,400
Like you guys...

534
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:52,680
Were like...

535
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,600
Really looking forward to see me back in...

536
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,620
Sajam Slam.

537
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,980
And like...

538
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,540
I saw like...

539
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,220
So many people were like...

540
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,980
Adding Sajam.

541
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,740
And being like...

542
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,340
Oh I wanna see...

543
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,320
Doki Bird back.

544
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,140
I really wanna see Doki again...

545
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,760
In the tournament.

546
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,400
I really wanna see her play more fighting games.

547
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,480
And...

548
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,760
You know...

549
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,700
I can't really stay...

550
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,680
In my cumbersome...

551
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,060
Forever.

552
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,360
And like...

553
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,060
To grow...

554
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,380
I have to be willing...

555
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,780
To like...

556
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,440
Take risks...

557
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,160
And try new things.

558
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,160
Like...

559
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,960
So that's why...

560
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,600
That's why I'm here.

561
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,840
I...

562
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,620
Will...

563
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,800
Get out of my...

564
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,760
Introvert...

565
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,420
Little...

566
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,920
Area...

567
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,440
And interact with...

568
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,140
New people.

569
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,480
I...

570
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,060
Will...

571
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,240
Socialize.

572
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,320
Okay.

573
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,240
Alright.

574
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,900
Now for the part...

575
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,500
Where a lot of you guys...

576
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:35,940
Are here for.

577
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,640
Because of my...

578
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,240
Pinned message.

579
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,680
I...

580
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,740
Will address...

581
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,040
The elephant...

582
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,580
In the...

583
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:40,900
Room.

584
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,000
I also typed this out...

585
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,580
Because I don't wanna...

586
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,680
Accidentally go off script...

587
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:44,960
And like...

588
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,660
Get people in trouble.

589
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,460
So...

590
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,200
I will address...

591
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,720
The elephant...

592
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,240
In the room.

593
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,420
And...

594
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,100
I've asked the organizers...

595
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,120
And Sajam...

596
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,560
If I could talk about it...

597
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,580
And they have like...

598
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,560
No problems with it.

599
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,120
So...

600
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,260
I wanna talk about it...

601
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,140
To make sure there's no like...

602
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,840
Rumors...

603
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,360
Or like...

604
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,900
Speculations going on...

605
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,520
During the tournament.

606
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,600
Especially...

607
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,620
Before like...

608
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,440
The team announcement.

609
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,060
So you might have seen...

610
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,260
Like...

611
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,720
People who are participating...

612
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,480
Um...

613
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,740
In this current...

614
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,500
Sajam Slam.

615
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,600
Um...

616
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,940
If you guys don't know what the fuck is going on...

617
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,100
Good.

618
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,340
Okay.

619
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,400
That doesn't matter for you guys.

620
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,040
Like...

621
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,520
You guys can like...

622
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,860
Um...

623
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,560
Just be like...

624
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,340
I don't know what's going on.

625
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,680
Like...

626
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,280
Oh well...

627
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,560
That's okay.

628
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,140
Like...

629
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,000
It doesn't matter for you guys.

630
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,720
But for those who do know what's going on...

631
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,260
This is...

632
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:28,540
I'll...

633
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,560
I'll talk about it.

634
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,360
Um...

635
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,500
Okay.

636
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,380
So...

637
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,460
Apparently...

638
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,640
The conditions...

639
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,260
That...

640
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,980
They gave...

641
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,940
The organizers...

642
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,640
Was that...

643
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,700
There has to be...

644
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,120
Zero interactions...

645
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Between me and them.

646
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,600
That means...

647
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,320
We won't be on the same team...

648
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,200
And they will not be in my skill division.

649
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,800
Obviously...

650
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm gonna be in the beginner level.

651
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,440
And also...

652
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,860
I'm gonna get like...

653
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,440
Absolutely destroyed.

654
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,380
But...

655
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,380
They...

656
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,940
Will not be in that skill division.

657
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,820
So...

658
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,880
We will not fight...

659
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,480
1v1.

660
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,100
And...

661
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,580
Uh...

662
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,560
Sajam...

663
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,360
Even asked...

664
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,720
Me...

665
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,400
If I was okay...

666
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,940
And...

667
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,980
Comfortable with it...

668
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,000
A few days ago...

669
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,960
And if I was...

670
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,900
Really uncomfortable...

671
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,580
And stressed out...

672
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,720
About the whole situation...

673
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,220
They won't let them participate.

674
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,940
I was honestly like...

675
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,640
Really surprised...

676
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,180
That he even...

677
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,340
Gave me that option...

678
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,240
Since this was like...

679
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,900
The first time...

680
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,820
Anyone has ever like...

681
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,880
Asked this of me...

682
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,620
And like...

683
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,140
He didn't have to do that...

684
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,200
And I won't lie...

685
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,360
I was really anxious...

686
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,700
But I said...

687
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,180
It is...

688
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,200
Not fair...

689
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,480
To kick the player out...

690
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,120
When...

691
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,420
They were not involved...

692
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,100
And...

693
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,120
Or responsible...

694
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,280
Especially when I know...

695
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,500
They are very passionate...

696
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
About fighting games...

697
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,980
And the FGC community...

698
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,820
Um...

699
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,080
And...

700
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,040
Um...

701
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,480
They really want to be here...

702
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,140
And...

703
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,740
I will not take that away from them...

704
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,060
And we all know...

705
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,520
That...

706
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,000
I suck at fighting games...

707
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,720
And me...

708
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,420
Getting kicked out...

709
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,400
Won't really matter that much...

710
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,080
In the long run...

711
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,420
So...

712
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,780
Like...

713
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,560
I was like...

714
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,740
So I was like...

715
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,080
I was honestly like...

716
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,940
Really surprised...

717
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,800
That Sajam...

718
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,100
Wanted to make sure I was okay...

719
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,080
When it was really just...

720
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,900
Easier to ask me to step down...

721
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,460
Instead...

722
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,680
And...

723
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,200
Uh...

724
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,820
Like...

725
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,220
I've been outcast before...

726
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,880
I've been ostracized in the past...

727
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,220
I was even denied entry...

728
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,340
For tournaments and events...

729
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,280
In the last six months...

730
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,900
So like...

731
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,960
I know how it feels...

732
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,680
To be like...

733
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,520
Excluded...

734
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,760
And I don't want that...

735
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,680
For others...

736
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,260
Especially...

737
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,440
If the event...

738
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
Is something they are passionate about...

739
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,040
So...

740
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,160
I told Sajam...

741
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,580
That we shouldn't take away...

742
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,220
Their chance to participate...

743
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,000
And ruin...

744
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,240
Their experience...

745
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,800
Due to the actions of others...

746
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,600
And...

747
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:30,940
Like...

748
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,640
I'm going...

749
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,160
So like...

750
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,900
Basically...

751
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,280
I'm going in...

752
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,960
There's gonna be...

753
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,760
Like...

754
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,280
I know like...

755
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,160
Going in...

756
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,940
There's gonna be like...

757
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,800
A lot of reactions...

758
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,420
When the announcements came out...

759
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,300
So I just had to...

760
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,240
Basically...

761
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,900
Uh...

762
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,460
Mentally prepare myself...

763
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,180
In advance...

764
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,780
Type deal...

765
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,600
Which is fine...

766
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:46,860
Like...

767
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,180
I knew in advance...

768
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,020
And I just had to like...

769
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,180
Mentally prepare myself...

770
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,920
And like...

771
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,580
Just like...

772
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,020
You know...

773
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,580
Um...

774
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,040
Had...

775
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,660
Have like...

776
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:53,940
Like...

777
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,600
Make sure...

778
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,940
That no one's gonna get in trouble...

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,380
And that starting here...

780
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,820

Zero interactions with them...

782
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,420
As per the rules...

783
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,300
And...

784
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,080

I'm gonna talk about it...

796
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,040
Going forward...

797
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,760
And it'll be the last time...

798
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,420

799
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,480

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:26,880
That's...

806
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,780

807
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,160

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,680
Now...

814
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,320
It's back to...

815
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,220
The usual...

816
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,080
Um...

820
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,320
So like...

821
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,780
Obviously...

822
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,300
I don't know who the fuck to play...

823
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,320

824
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,780

825
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,220
I don't...

826
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,340
I don't know who to play...

827
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,100
And like...

828
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,360
When I got into the server...

829
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,300
Um...

830
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,860

831
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,040
When I got into the server...

832
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,360
I...

833
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,560
This is what I wrote...

834
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,200
I was like...

835
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,380
I need to show you guys this...

836
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,080

837
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,120
I'm here to vibe...

838
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
It's not yesterday...

839
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,880
By the way...

840
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,200
Like...

841
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,340

842
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,580
Like...

843
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,360
On the day it was yesterday...

844
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,780
This was like...

845
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,380
Not yesterday...

846
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,600
But...

847
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,140
I saved this screenshot...

848
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,860
This was like...

849
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,840
A couple of days ago...

850
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,360
Um...

851
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,940
Um...

852
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,580
I was like...

853
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,100
I'm here to vibe...

854
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,900
I don't know what's going on...

855
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,180
I don't know what I'm doing...

856
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,000
And...

857
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
I just wanna play a character...

858
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,980
That beginners hate playing against...

859
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,700
And everybody's like...

860
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,160
Bison...

861
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,860
What do you mean that's...

862
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,440
I literally played King...

863
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:30,880
Like...

864
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,000
I literally played King...

865
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,520
Like...

866
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,660
And then...

867
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,880
And then a coach was like...

868
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,140
Okay...

869
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,720
And then the coach was like...

870
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,040
Okay...

871
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,780
If you wanna ruin someone's day early...

872
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,620
On Honda...

873
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,340
Bison...

874
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,580

875
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,840
I don't know who these characters are...

876
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,380
By the way...

877
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:46,840
Uh...

878
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,280
It was like...

879
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,100
Honda...

880
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,820

885
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,580
I know Blanca...

886
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,780
Blanca's the spiky guy...

887
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,560
I know that...

888
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,120
Um...

889
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,680
And I was like...

890
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,180
Nice...

891
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,680
Use that information responsibly...

892
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,060
No...

893
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,060
A fucking question...

894
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,300
No...

895
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm here to...

896
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,180
I'm here...

897
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,040
I'm here to cheese my way out of the assertive...

898
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,660
Um...

899
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,020
Coaches wise...

900
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,000
BP and I...

901
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,820
Bravo and I...

902
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,180
We're like...

903
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,260
Talking about it...

904
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,160
And like...

905
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,980
We might...

906
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,840
Request...

907
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,580
Brian...

908
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,260
Um...

909
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,040
Okay...

910
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,400
I...

911
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,680
This is like...

912
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,320
This does not come from me...

913
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,700
Okay...

914
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,100
This does not come from me...

915
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,220
But like...

916
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,600
Um...

917
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,080

Cause like...

919
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,640
Bro...

920
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,180
Obviously...

921
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,400
Bravo knows more about the fighting game community scene...

922
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,260
And...

923
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,820
Um...

924
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,720
And like...

925
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,200
I was...

926
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,040
So he was like...

927
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,220
Asking around the street fighter scene...

928
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,600
Like...

929
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,380
In his area...

930
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,420
In his local area...

931
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:43,880
And was like...

932
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,080
Alright...

933
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,180
Here are our coaches...

934
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,020
Um...

935
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,940
Like...

936
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,820
Who should we get?

937
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,920
And then...

938
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,420
Um...

939
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,060
And then...

940
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,520
Like...

941
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,200
He was like...

942
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,160
Who is the funniest?

943
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,300
And then...

944
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,020
No offense to the coaches...

945
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,020
It was like...

946
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,160
But like...

947
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,920
The local players...

948
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,900
Was like...

949
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,620
Honestly...

950
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,280
None of them...

951
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
I was like...

952
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,900
No...

953
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,280
What?

954
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,180
That sounds so

955
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,640
mean...

956
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,580
I was like...

957
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,780
Holy shit...

958
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,620
That's so mean...

959
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,600
But...

960
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,820
They were all saying...

961
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,380
Like...

962
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,100
Um...

963
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,660
Um...

964
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,600

Uh...

968
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,020
We should...

969
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,700

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,880
Like...

977
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,800
Me as the player...

978
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,080
Like...

979
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,740
Whoever team I get...

980
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,020
They're...

981
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,420
Like...

982
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm like...

983
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,780
The mascot...

984
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,300
Like...

985
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm not...

986
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,500
Like...

987
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,440

988
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,040

989
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,900

990
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm literally like...

991
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
The mascot...

992
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,660
Like...

993
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,300
Of...

994
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,660
Uh...

995
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,360
Of the team...

996
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,160
They're just like...

997
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,320
Oh...

998
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,360
You did great sweetie...

999
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,620
Like...

1000
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,120
If I lose...

1001
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,740
They're like...

1002
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,420
It's okay...

1003
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:03,860
You know...

1004
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,340
Like...

1005
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,360
It's expected...

1006
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,940
Like...

1007
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,760
If I win...

1008
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,420
They'll be like...

1009
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:08,760
Are you...

1010
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,580
They'll be like...

1011
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,820
Did we get the right person?

1012
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,200
Like...

1013
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,620
If I win...

1014
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,340
They're just gonna be like...

1015
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,960
Alright...

1016
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,580
Alright...

1017
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,460
Who's actually using your controller?

1018
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,700
Like...

1019
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,900
So like...

1020
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,520
I know my place...

1021
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,060
Like...

1022
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,240
On...

1023
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,500
On the team...

1024
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,080
Um...

1025
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,420
It'll just be like...

1026
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,160
A very pleasant surprise...

1027
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,760
When I do...

1028
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,540
If I do win a game...

1029
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,080
Uh...

1030
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,920
Expect...

1031
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,460
Just remember...

1032
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,720
Expectations...

1033
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,220
Are...

1034
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,140
Very...

1035
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,080
Low...

1036
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,680
Um...

1037
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,660
But yes...

1038
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:45,900
Uh...

1039
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,620
Most likely...

1040
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,460
Brawl Pro and I...

1041
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,180
We're both gonna...

1042
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,300
Request for...

1043
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,680
Uh...

1044
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,340
Brian...

1045
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,080
And then...

1046
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,320
We'll see how it goes...

1047
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
We'll see how it goes...

1048
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,500
Like...

1049
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,180
Um...

1050
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,200
I don't know...

1051
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,580
Anybody...

1052
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,560
Honestly...

1053
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,020
I didn't even know anybody in Tekken...

1054
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,980
I just was like...

1055
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,160
Oh...

1056
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,380
Hey...

1057
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,780
You played...

1058
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,920
Brawl Pro plays King...

1059
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
And I wanna play King...

1060
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,360
So like...

1061
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,580
Obviously it worked out...

1062
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,060
But like...

1063
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,860
Now I'm just like...

1064
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,060
I don't...

1065
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,760
I don't know...

1066
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,220
I don't know what I'm doing...

1067
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,080
Um...

1068
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,780
Anyway...

1069
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,660
Let's actually play the video game...

1070
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,380
Street Fighter time...

1071
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,700
Yay...

1072
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,660
Alright...

1073
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,460
Here we go...

1074
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,040
Also...

1075
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,460
I have...

1076
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,280
I found my level list controller...

1077
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,740
Also...

1078
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,400
Guys...

1079
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,220
Um...

1080
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,500
Um...

1081
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,720
Um...

1082
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,400
If we get to the finals...

1083
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
I will beg Seijam...

1084
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,060
To let me have Kony...

1085
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,100
Be my substitute...

1086
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,000
And have him cosplay as me...

1087
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,060
Cause the finals is at TwitchCon...

1088
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,000
And like...

1089
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,320
Like...

1090
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,500
Kony's down...

1091
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:42,880
Like...

1092
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,980
He's so fucking down for it...

1093
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,800
And like...

1094
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,880
I know like some of you guys are like...

1095
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,080
Yeah...

1096
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,280
But...

1097
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,620
Like...

1098
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,460
Kony's so good at Street Fighter...

1099
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,320
I will...

1100
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,040
I will...

1101
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,240
I'll make him play the worst fucking character in Street Fighter...

1102
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,300
And maybe play...

1103
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,480
And play on classic controller...

1104
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:57,880
Cause he's not good...

1105
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,720
Alright guys?

1106
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,600
And he'll...

1107
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,280
There's no way he'll learn in time...

1108
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,980
And I will be...

1109
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,060
And also I will ask him to be drunk too...

1110
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,700
Maybe...

1111
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,740
I will just be like...

1112
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,840
I will be like...

1113
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,180
Um...

1114
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,600
Be drunk...

1115
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,260
Um...

1116
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,800
Play the worst character...

1117
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,680
Play...

1118
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,840
as classic...

1119
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,640
And then...

1120
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,860
Because he needs to be at my level...

1121
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,660
He needs to be...

1122
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,320
Cause like...

1123
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,360
The actual rules...

1124
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
Was that...

1125
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:26,960
I can play this and...

1126
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,060
I can't play this...

1127
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,340
The actual rules is that they have to be on the same... be blindfolded!

1128
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,340
Okay, I'll also tell him to be blindfolded.

1129
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,780
Only if I make it to the finals.

1130
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,000
Only if I make it to the finals, chat.

1131
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:45,680
Um, I will make Kony cosplay as me to participate as me at TwitchCon.

1132
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,440
We're just gonna throw as many debuffs and invert the controls.

1133
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:54,740
Yes.

1134
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,680
I'll make him play with inverted controls as well.

1135
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,660
blindfolded inverted controls Okay, but I have to make it to the finals.

1136
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,380
That's the thing.

1137
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,760
I The only stipulation is that I have to make it to the finals.

1138
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,480
Really I

1139
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,880
Even told BrawlPro.

1140
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,700
I was like please carry me I was like only, you have to...

1141
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,120
I was like You have to carry me to the finals, because Kony will cosplay as me.

1142
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,280
And then, and then, Brapo was like...

1143
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,320
Bro, I haven't even played this game in a year and a half, man.

1144
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,880
He's like, I haven't touched this game in a year and a half.

1145
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,260
Like, I don't know what you want, but it does sound really funny.

1146
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,940
Like, he's like, it does sound very funny.

1147
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,160
Okay, I'm raising up the volume.

1148
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,140
Alright, what do I do?

1149
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,080
You know what?

1150
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,580
Let's go.

1151
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,680
What's the worst that could happen?

1152
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,640
I have no idea how to play this game.

1153
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,660
What the fuck is the worst that could happen?

1154
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,720
Alright, what are we trying?

1155
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,040
What are we trying, guys?

1156
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,260
I can't lose Elo.

1157
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm literally at the bottom.

1158
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,760
Guys, I'm at the fucking bottom.

1159
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,820
How would I lose Elo?

1160
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,140
How?

1161
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,240
How do I even start?

1162
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,460
How do I queue up?

1163
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,440
How do I even...

1164
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,580
On?

1165
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,960
How do I even queue up?

1166
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,660
How the fuck do you... pause?

1167
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,920
How...

1168
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,760
You just do...

1169
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,960
Oh, I'm queued?

1170
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,800
Okay.

1171
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,760
Nice.

1172
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,060
Alright.

1173
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:54,800
Alright.

1174
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:54,820
Alright.

1175
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,460
Nice.

1176
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:55,840
Alright.

1177
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,380
Placement matches.

1178
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,700
Like, what's the worst that could happen?

1179
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,840
Master Lee, you're giving a master rate when you reach master rank.

1180
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,180
Okay, that's never gonna happen.

1181
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,180
Alright, I am a beginner.

1182
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,200
Yes.

1183
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,040
No, don't worry.

1184
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,440
I know I don't need a change.

1185
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:13,720
Alright.

1186
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,800
What's the worst that could happen?

1187
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,340
What's the...

1188
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,080
What's the...

1189
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,260
What's the...

1190
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,020
What's the...

1191
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,180
What's the...

1192
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,260
Can't be that bad.

1193
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,700
Alright.

1194
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,280
Oh, it's the CPU.

1195
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,220
It's the CPU.

1196
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
This is fine.

1197
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,360
What am I doing?

1198
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,820
What am I...?

1199
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,700
Oh, shit.

1200
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,500
Oh.

1201
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,500
How do I...?

1202
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,540
Okay, nice.

1203
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:41,980
Alright.

1204
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,040
I'm doing it?

1205
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,940
Is he...

1206
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,280
Okay, he's doing it too?

1207
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,800
There's no way I'm going to lose to a CPU, right?

1208
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:55,800
I think I might lose to a CPU, guys.

1209
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,480
I don't know what I'm doing.

1210
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,860
What's going on?

1211
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,740
Wait, is this like...

1212
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,260
Oh...

1213
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,260
Okay, wait.

1214
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,820
No, no, no, I figured it out.

1215
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,920
I figured it out.

1216
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,280
Okay, wait.

1217
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,540
Oh shit, I figured it out!

1218
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,520
I don't know what I did!

1219
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,720
That's right, get CPU'd!

1220
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:32,980
Dodge?

1221
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,500
What the fuck is dodge?

1222
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,060
Okay, don't worry guys.

1223
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,800
Don't worry, I figured it out.

1224
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,220
I don't know how I did it.

1225
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,640
But I figured it out.

1226
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,040
I'm doing a thing!

1227
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,640
Alright.

1228
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,960
I found the grab!

1229
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,320
Oh, what am I doing?

1230
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,360
Nice, we did it.

1231
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,420
We did it.

1232
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,460
No CPU's going to beat me.

1233
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,080
No CPU.

1234
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,500
Wait, I didn't heat burst?

1235
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:06,920
The fuck?

1236
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,680
I almost forgot what a heat burst was.

1237
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,440
It's been so long.

1238
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,160
Oh.

1239
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,360
Wait, did I block it?

1240
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:11,860
I did!

1241
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,540
Oh my god, the block animation is so weird.

1242
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,800
The block animation is so weird that it...

1243
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,400
I can't...

1244
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,000
I didn't even...

1245
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,320
Like, I can't figure out what I'm blocking sometimes.

1246
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,020
Oh, I parried?

1247
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,240
Oh my god, I'm doing it!

1248
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:30,900
Woah.

1249
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,360
Okay.

1250
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,460
Wait.

1251
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,280
CPU shouldn't be allowed...

1252
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,000
You're level 5!

1253
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,400
How do you know how to block?

1254
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,980
That's all I'm saying.

1255
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,180
All I'm saying is that...

1256
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,120
As level 5, you should not be allowed to block.

1257
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,100
Like...

1258
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,300
You should not be...

1259
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,040
No!

1260
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,720
Alright.

1261
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,860
I don't think Honda is it.

1262
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,440
Honda...

1263
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,720
Honda doesn't seem to be, like...

1264
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,780
Oh shit!

1265
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,080
Wait!

1266
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,740
What?

1267
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm doing it again?

1268
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,740
No, I want to pick a different character!

1269
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,480
I don't know what...

1270
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
There's st...

1271
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,820
I forgot there's stamina in this fucking game.

1272
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,480
Like...

1273
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,980
The Dark Souls it.

1274
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,800
The Souls like it.

1275
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,420
Alright.

1276
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,280
I don't even know what's using...

1277
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,240
Oh, that's using the stamina.

1278
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,320
Oh no, empty.

1279
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,980
Oh.

1280
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,380
No, am I blocking?

1281
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,840
Am I blocking?

1282
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,200
Guys, rank is not as intimidating when it's like I'm literally fighting a CPU.

1283
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:36,820
Like...

1284
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,260
Like...

1285
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,780
It's not as intimidating as, like, I think it is.

1286
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,320
When my first game is literally against a CPU.

1287
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,600
Okay.

1288
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,620
Nice.

1289
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,580
It's just one hit!

1290
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,380
That's right.

1291
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,800
Pretend you're a shapeshifted Wukong.

1292
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,740
Use the power of the Salus Monkey.

1293
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,640
Zane, thank you for the super chat.

1294
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,020
Thank you.

1295
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,540
Thank you.

1296
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:01,900
Okay.

1297
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,820
Nice.

1298
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,660
Oh, shit.

1299
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,020
Not nice.

1300
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,580
Oh, no.

1301
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,060
Not nice.

1302
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,440
Not nice.

1303
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,440
Oh, please.

1304
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,480
Why does he know how to jump?

1305
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,680
You're a computer!

1306
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh, no.

1307
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,920
Out of...

1308
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,720
What am I doing?

1309
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,500
What am I...

1310
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,220
Why can't I...

1311
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,880
Why is he so fast?

1312
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,860
Get out!

1313
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,840
Alright.

1314
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,160
Nice.

1315
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,620
I'm using my Loveless Controller, by the way.

1316
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,360
Oh, shit.

1317
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:30,420
Oh, shit.

1318
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,860
Oh, what?

1319
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,420
Oh.

1320
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,120
Did I do it?

1321
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,800
What did I do?

1322
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
I just...

1323
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,680
What...

1324
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,700
What did I...

1325
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,920
I did something.

1326
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,700
Oh.

1327
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
What did I...

1328
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,560
What is that?

1329
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,260
Oh, I move!

1330
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,200
You can't do this to me!

1331
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:57,480
Oh...

1332
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:57,800
Yay!

1333
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,800
So easy.

1334
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,600
That is...

1335
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,220
Wow.

1336
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,860
So easy.

1337
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,280
You know what, maybe Street Fighter isn't so bad.

1338
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,200
I mean Street Fighter seems so fucking easy, not gonna lie.

1339
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,380
Stop pretending, Toki!

1340
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,760
Okay, let's go to... let's go to... let's go to training.

1341
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,820
Let's go to training.

1342
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,320
Alright.

1343
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,840
Alright.

1344
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,800
Uhh, training room.

1345
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,080
So, alright, another suggestion people told me to try was Bison.

1346
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,380
Wait, do I have to buy Bison?

1347
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,620
I have to buy... I... what?

1348
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,640
Okay, wait.

1349
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,900
I thought I bought the Deluxe!

1350
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,160
What do you mean?

1351
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,680
What do you... you have to buy Bison?

1352
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,760
Like, I... I bought the fucking... I bought the entire Deluxe!

1353
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,780
I paid a hundred bucks!

1354
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,780
A hundred plus dollars!

1355
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,200
Like...

1356
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,240
I'm fighting instead of Season 2.

1357
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,620
You mean Season 2 is not included?

1358
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,280
Like, I bought Season 1?

1359
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,020
Oh my god.

1360
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,000
Okay.

1361
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,260
Alright, so I paid a hundred... yes, this time I actually bought the game instead of, like...

1362
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,520
I asked them, like, if they could give me a free copy, but they're like, no.

1363
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,820
They're like, no, you gotta... you gotta buy your own copy, dokey.

1364
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,220
Like, lol.

1365
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,120
So...

1366
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,740
I can't believe it.

1367
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,200
Guys, I need to... I don't remember my PayPal email.

1368
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,440
I need to look it up.

1369
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,500
I was... I thought... I thought I didn't have to buy it!

1370
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,440
I thought... why did I pay so much?

1371
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,340
What's the point?

1372
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,100
The real fight is the microtransaction.

1373
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,200
Curse you, microtransaction.

1374
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,040
Why did you make such an OP character?

1375
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,040
And then put it behind a paywall?

1376
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,860
Alright.

1377
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,320
I can't believe it.

1378
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,340
Agreed and paid.

1379
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,320
Oh my.

1380
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,560
And before, like, I don't even fucking...

1381
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:33,820
Okay.

1382
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
Ooh, authorized.

1383
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,600
Stereo.

1384
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,020
And before, I don't even play him.

1385
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,920
In the end, just like Eddy.

1386
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,440
It's just like Eddy all over again.

1387
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,260
Alright.

1388
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,960
We got Bison.

1389
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,520
We got him.

1390
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:47,860
Alright.

1391
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,680
Bison isn't that good?

1392
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,060
I heard he's a noob killer.

1393
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,800
That's what I need right now.

1394
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,380
I need the noob play.

1395
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,340
Which one?

1396
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,440
Please read this.

1397
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,140
Which one?

1398
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,940
Can't go wrong with Zangief all skin number nine.

1399
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,140
Thank you for the super chat, Savage.

1400
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,520
Thank you.

1401
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,040
Am I even on modern controllers?

1402
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,900
I can't tell.

1403
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,140
Oh, I am.

1404
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,860
It says M.

1405
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,180
Alright.

1406
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,280
What am I doing?

1407
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,980
Alright, guys.

1408
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,960
I think I'm like...

1409
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,600
I'm doing it.

1410
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,600
I'm doing it.

1411
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,260
Am I still?

1412
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,260
Oh, I'm still in rank Q?

1413
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,880
I'll never get out of rank Q.

1414
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
That's how you learn.

1415
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,680
Like this?

1416
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,980
This is how I won...

1417
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,680
This is how I won the King...

1418
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,280
The King V Reina fight.

1419
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,200
All natural.

1420
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,140
All natural, baby.

1421
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,940
All natural.

1422
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,580
How is she so fast?

1423
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,720
That's right.

1424
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
That's right.

1425
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,780
I used to play Starcraft.

1426
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,760
All natural APM.

1427
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,680
She's so good.

1428
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,520
Alright.

1429
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,080
Let's see.

1430
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,560
Whoa.

1431
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,060
Whoa.

1432
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,400
Hey, that's a sick move.

1433
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,240
Guys, I won't learn until, like, I actually win.

1434
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,860
I actually have a coach.

1435
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,260
That's how it happened with King.

1436
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,040
All I did was spam inputs and somehow win.

1437
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,720
Alright.

1438
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,260
She's taking on...

1439
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,240
She's holding and using the heavy attack.

1440
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,920
Try holding the right trigger and using the...

1441
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,100
Which one's the heavy attacks?

1442
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,400
Is it square, triangle, O, X, R1, L1?

1443
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,980
Oh, what's L1?

1444
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,040
R2?

1445
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,500
Or L2?

1446
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,600
Oh, L2 is the grapple.

1447
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,400
Oh, it's a circle?

1448
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,060
Okay.

1449
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,760
Right trigger.

1450
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,220
Oh, it's a circle.

1451
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,740
Is it this?

1452
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,560
Is it this?

1453
00:37:59,420 --> 00:37:59,980
Is...

1454
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,140
Okay.

1455
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,800
That's the kick.

1456
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,160
Alright.

1457
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,400
Alright.

1458
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:04,840
L...

1459
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,760
Blue is L.

1460
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,060
Yellow is M.

1461
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,880
Red is...

1462
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,100
What the fuck are these num...

1463
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,440
What do these...

1464
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,940
What do these colors mean?

1465
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:13,960
Alright.

1466
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,580
Alright.

1467
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,540
NPC number five.

1468
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,900
Come in here.

1469
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,600
Oh, wait.

1470
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,040
He's real.

1471
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,260
Wait.

1472
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,820
Rank up?

1473
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,180
Rank up.

1474
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,200
Rank up.

1475
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,380
It's just like... what do you mean rank up?

1476
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,300
I'm a baby.

1477
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,200
Wait.

1478
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,000
Why my Honda?

1479
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:30,780
No!

1480
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,340
I was landing bison!

1481
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,460
Oh my God.

1482
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:34,860
He knows.

1483
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,980
He fucking knows.

1484
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,520
He knows.

1485
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,380
Oh my God.

1486
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,340
He fucking knows.

1487
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,120
He knows I'm a baby!

1488
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,180
Bro, this is fucked.

1489
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,920
This is actually fucked.

1490
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,680
This is actually...

1491
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,750
Why am I on the right side?

1492
00:38:59,770 --> 00:38:59,790
Why am I on the wrong side?

1493
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,810
I should be able to pick a side!

1494
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,330
I should be able to pick a side!

1495
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:05,730
Get out!

1496
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,290
Fuck you!

1497
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,850
He fucking knows!

1498
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,450
He knows I'm a- What the fuck!

1499
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,330
He's actually beaming me!

1500
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,270
You fucker!

1501
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,230
I hate you!

1502
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,250
You don't pick sides in Street Fighter?

1503
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,090
What is this bullshit?!

1504
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,410
When he's letting you win a round!

1505
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,070
This is fucked!

1506
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,650
This is so fucked!

1507
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,490
Please don't do this to me!

1508
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,390
Please don't do this to me!

1509
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,690
Please don't let me win!

1510
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,330
I don't wanna be higher ELO!

1511
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,330
I don't know what I'm doing!

1512
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,990
What the fuck!

1513
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,350
Why are you doing this to me?!

1514
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,130
No!

1515
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,730
Just...

1516
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:04,650
Why?!

1517
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,690
I'm sitting around!

1518
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,830
No, don't let me be higher, Rick!

1519
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,590
I don't know what I'm doing!

1520
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,050
No!

1521
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,310
Why would you do this to me?!

1522
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,110
I don't know what I'm doing!

1523
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,530
Okay...

1524
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:30,730
Alright...

1525
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,990
Open matchmaking...

1526
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,250
Oh, I have to like, re-select a character?

1527
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,950
Alright, nice.

1528
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,670
Alright, I'm ready.

1529
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,130
Alright...

1530
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,590
It's a nice fight.

1531
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,470
Alright...

1532
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,390
I have to charge?

1533
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,770
Is this charge?

1534
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,230
Is blue charge?

1535
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,030
Where's blue?

1536
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,290
Blue?

1537
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,850
Road to Master?

1538
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,830
Oh, now you gotta match?

1539
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,170
How?

1540
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,150
How do I match up?

1541
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,570
You open matchmaking settings.

1542
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,810
Oh, on.

1543
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,670
Alright, it's time.

1544
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,910
It's time.

1545
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,950
I've learned Bison.

1546
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,870
Here comes a new challenger!

1547
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,150
I've done it!

1548
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,110
Hold R2, then press light, medium, or heavy.

1549
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:14,850
R1...

1550
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:15,410
R2?

1551
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,130
Okay, R2.

1552
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,530
Round 1.

1553
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,450
Alright.

1554
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,010
That's working right.

1555
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,450
That's right, I don't know what I'm doing, but that's fucking right.

1556
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,390
Oh, you're a CPU, what?!

1557
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,010
They already gave me another CPU?!

1558
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,050
I was so confident!

1559
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,010
I was gonna be like, oh my god, I hit...

1560
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,430
Oh my god!

1561
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,990
I was so confident, too!

1562
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,730
I was like, oh my god, I...

1563
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,170
I've managed to like, you know...

1564
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,690
Got so many moves!

1565
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,010
Holy shit, I'm so...

1566
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,410
So good!

1567
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:55,370
Only to find out I'm in a... I'm in another... Oh, new character, new rank.

1568
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,190
Oh, yeah, I forgot!

1569
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,490
When you're playing a new character.

1570
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:02,090
Why am I on the... Why am I on the right side?

1571
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,330
Okay, R2.

1572
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,030
Okay, R2, this time.

1573
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,990
Oh, no, not this time.

1574
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:11,650
No!

1575
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:12,410
Goodbye!

1576
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,430
Yes!

1577
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:14,950
I got a hit in!

1578
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,130
Oh, no, I... Yes!

1579
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,010
Oh, I got another hit in!

1580
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,410
Oh, no!

1581
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,350
Get off me!

1582
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:26,970
Okay, now... What?

1583
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,330
He punished counter!

1584
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,350
Guys, I think this is harder than Tekken.

1585
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:39,650
I think this is actually... Guys, this is... Guys, Bison is harder.

1586
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,930
Bison is so...

1587
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,990
Why did I... Why did I decide... You know what?

1588
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,130
Maybe I am a Honda player.

1589
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,090
Maybe... Maybe I am a Honda player.

1590
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,790
Alright, nice.

1591
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,550
Should have gone with Ki.

1592
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,110
No!

1593
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:08,710
No!

1594
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,670
No, quit.

1595
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,790
I quit rank match.

1596
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:15,990
Alright.

1597
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,390
Wait.

1598
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,190
Maybe... Wait, I know!

1599
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,370
Guys, I know now.

1600
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,030
Guys.

1601
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,770
Maybe I was meant to be a...

1602
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:26,310
Zangief.

1603
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,770
That can't be that hard, right?

1604
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,210
That can't be... Oh, wait.

1605
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,190
Wait, how do I...

1606
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,370
It can't be that hard, right?

1607
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,790
Do a tutorial.

1608
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,610
Enzi, thank you for the super chat.

1609
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:39,670
Thank you, thank you.

1610
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,310
Guys, you all know...

1611
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,650
You all know...

1612
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:49,210
Even when I do the tutorial... I'll do the tutorial, but it's not gonna go in the right ear.

1613
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,150
Alright.

1614
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,490
Whoa, what am I doing?

1615
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:54,930
Whoa!

1616
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,390
Wait, maybe...

1617
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,090
Wait, maybe I'm a Ki player.

1618
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,790
Oh, this is the most damage I've done!

1619
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,330
Okay, wait.

1620
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:08,690
Oh, God.

1621
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,750
Wait, he's doing... He's doing stuff.

1622
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,090
What am I doing?

1623
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:12,710
Oh!

1624
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,350
What did I do?

1625
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:17,950
What am I doing?

1626
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:19,470
Wait!

1627
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,770
Wait, Enzi, could it be?

1628
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,670
Am I a Ki player online?

1629
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,150
Could it be?

1630
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,590
Nice read.

1631
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,190
Thank you.

1632
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:28,730
Thank you.

1633
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:29,710
I totally read that.

1634
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:30,590
Thank you.

1635
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,030
Thank you.

1636
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,130
Very intentional.

1637
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:39,270
Very...

1638
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,610
I read...

1639
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,690
I'm just a grappler main.

1640
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,790
That's fucking right!

1641
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:47,650
Oh!

1642
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,070
Wait, I counted!

1643
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:50,990
Wait!

1644
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,350
I think...

1645
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:53,610
Wait.

1646
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:54,610
Wait, wait, wait.

1647
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,630
Wait, guys.

1648
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,170
Guys, I think...

1649
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,610
I think I was just meant to play this character.

1650
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,590
I think...

1651
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,830
I think I was meant to...

1652
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:04,970
I think...

1653
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,970
I think I was just meant... meant to play Keef.

1654
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,030
That is it.

1655
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,930
I think this is it.

1656
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:13,970
Oh, my God.

1657
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:14,790
Wait.

1658
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:15,970
I think it's fate.

1659
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,750
That was actually the best I've ever done.

1660
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,210
I think it's the best.

1661
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,170
It's just King with...

1662
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,170
I don't know all the characters.

1663
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,370
I've actually won a game against the CPU.

1664
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,350
Oh, my God.

1665
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:34,050
Okay.

1666
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:34,990
Oh!

1667
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:36,350
Look at that!

1668
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:38,250
I have no idea what I'm doing!

1669
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,910
But it's working!

1670
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,050
Oh, wait.

1671
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:43,530
I'm sorry.

1672
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,030
I'm so sorry.

1673
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:44,610
Wait.

1674
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:45,510
Nice.

1675
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:46,950
I don't know what...

1676
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,530
I don't know what that move is, but nice.

1677
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,730
And I haven't used up my stamina, too!

1678
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:53,330
Oh.

1679
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:53,590
Oh.

1680
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:53,770
Oh.

1681
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,090
I'm sorry.

1682
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:54,890
I'm sorry.

1683
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,110
Oh.

1684
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:55,530
Oh.

1685
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,170
Oh.

1686
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:57,190
Yes!

1687
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,550
The grappler.

1688
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:00,930
Oh.

1689
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:01,670
Please.

1690
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,650
Please!

1691
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:04,250
Please, CPU!

1692
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:05,570
Where?

1693
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,410
Oh.

1694
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:06,910
That.

1695
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:07,370
No!

1696
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:08,230
No!

1697
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,310
Oh.

1698
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:09,950
Please!

1699
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:11,870
Yes!

1700
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,030
One Messiah!

1701
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,290
Thank you for the super chat!

1702
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:16,750
Thank you!

1703
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,370
Thank you!

1704
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,510
Of course, the King player plays Zangief.

1705
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,930
Who saw that coming?

1706
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,410
Guys, I figured it out.

1707
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,070
I was...

1708
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,410
I was a Zangief player all along.

1709
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,590
I'm here to grapple my way to victory.

1710
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,550
Slap!

1711
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:35,370
Slap!

1712
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,110
Game 2.0 here.

1713
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:38,210
Oh.

1714
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:38,710
There we go.

1715
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,030
There we go.

1716
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:42,690
There we go.

1717
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:43,590
Come on.

1718
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:44,670
Kick!

1719
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,010
Where am I doing?

1720
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:46,250
No!

1721
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,770
Why did you jump?

1722
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,290
Why did you jump?

1723
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,790
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1724
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,550
He's literally me.

1725
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,710
He's literally me.

1726
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,630
Teacher Haggin, thank you for the super chat.

1727
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:01,030
Thank you.

1728
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:01,630
Thank you.

1729
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:06,670
We told you Gief was the King of this game and you didn't even believe.

1730
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:07,870
I believe now.

1731
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,490
I believe now.

1732
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,290
I believe now.

1733
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,250
We figured it out, everybody.

1734
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,230
We actually figured it out.

1735
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,630
Wait, how do I change?

1736
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:22,490
Oh, okay.

1737
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,970
Where is he?

1738
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,770
Is it there?

1739
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,990
No, not keep!

1740
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:30,790
No!

1741
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,690
Wait, why not?

1742
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:36,870
Why not?

1743
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:37,230
Why not keep?

1744
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,410
I don't understand.

1745
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,590
Why not keep?

1746
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:49,910
Do not listen to sound, guys.

1747
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,490
Let's go, chat.

1748
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,350
Keep, keep, keep, keep.

1749
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,890
Thank you, super chat.

1750
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:55,270
Thank you.

1751
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,350
He is not a great player, but have fun!

1752
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,110
No, don't say that!

1753
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,410
I thought he was good!

1754
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,970
What do you mean?

1755
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:08,490
Is he not good?

1756
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,130
Modern people carry a victory.

1757
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,890
We only care about...

1758
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:19,210
Guys, am I throwing?

1759
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,230
No, there is no way.

1760
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,850
Guys, am I throwing?

1761
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,510
Am I throwing my player?

1762
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,110
Guys, I might be throwing my player.

1763
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,030
There is no way.

1764
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,790
You just got to be patient.

1765
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,030
What the fuck?

1766
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,170
How do you know how to count your throws?

1767
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,290
We are babies!

1768
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,130
I don't understand.

1769
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,430
How are you able to count it?

1770
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,550
I barely know what I am doing.

1771
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:53,110
Are there...

1772
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,210
Are there even beginners?

1773
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:56,310
Nice.

1774
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,870
Okay, thanks for jumping there.

1775
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,310
I really...

1776
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,770
You know, I do appreciate her jumping though.

1777
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,650
I really appreciate that.

1778
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,130
He is fine though.

1779
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,970
I know why she jumped.

1780
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:14,770
Oh, it's okay.

1781
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,830
She is a real player.

1782
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,330
What a read.

1783
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,350
Guys, I can't believe I read her perfectly.

1784
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:21,830
Guys.

1785
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:25,750
Oh my god, she is so fast.

1786
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,270
Why am I so slow?

1787
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,470
Oh my god.

1788
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:30,670
That's fucking right!

1789
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,170
Get read!

1790
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,690
I don't know how, but like...

1791
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,610
That's fucking right!

1792
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,670
This is embarrassing for you!

1793
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,430
More so than it is for me!

1794
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,190
Oh god.

1795
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,550
This is more embarrassing for you than it is for me.

1796
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:51,550
I am just saying.

1797
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,510
That's fucking right!

1798
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:57,690
Oh god.

1799
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,210
Okay.

1800
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,130
That's fucking right!

1801
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,990
This is so embarrassing for you!

1802
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:12,770
The fact that a real player lost to me!

1803
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:18,930
What?!

1804
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,230
I should have game!

1805
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,670
Oh my god.

1806
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:26,230
Oh no.

1807
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,410
Oh no.

1808
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,470
Guys, I don't think I am going to win this other round.

1809
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:32,250
Guys, I don't...

1810
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,730
I don't think she is too...

1811
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,170
Oh my god.

1812
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,830
Guys, she keeps backing away.

1813
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:38,470
I don't know why.

1814
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:42,850
Oh my god.

1815
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,510
Guys, what do I do?

1816
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,750
What do I do?

1817
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:48,890
Not flawless!

1818
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:50,550
It's okay!

1819
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,630
It was not flawless!

1820
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,310
And that's all I wanted!

1821
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,350
I did it!

1822
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,690
No flawless for you!

1823
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:58,910
It's alright.

1824
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:00,490
There was no flawless.

1825
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,270
That's okay.

1826
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,430
Just don't fight.

1827
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,870
Just pray you don't fight.

1828
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:07,890
Thank you for the super chat.

1829
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,210
Thank you.

1830
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,070
Oh no, you are not farming me.

1831
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:13,990
You are not farming me.

1832
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,250
How do I grab?

1833
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,950
Is it this?

1834
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,370
Let's just grab.

1835
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,670
How do I grab you?

1836
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,310
How the fuck do I...

1837
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,550
How the fuck do I...

1838
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,270
Okay.

1839
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:29,110
What?

1840
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,030
Crap.

1841
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:31,930
What's SP?

1842
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,050
Guys, what is the SP button?

1843
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:37,910
What is LP?

1844
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:42,890
Guys, I have square, triangle, X, O, up, down, left, right.

1845
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,200
You guys got to be very specific.

1846
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:46,250
You guys got to be very specific.

1847
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,550
You guys have to be...

1848
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,410
You guys have to be incredibly specific there.

1849
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:57,410
You guys have to be incredibly specific there.

1850
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,150
The other tutorial.

1851
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,410
But like, I'm winning!

1852
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,650
I'm not winning.

1853
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:06,950
I'm not winning.

1854
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:09,370
But I like to...

1855
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,250
Why am I fighting iron?

1856
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:12,850
Oh no.

1857
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:13,890
She knows.

1858
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,070
Now she definitely knows I don't know how I play.

1859
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,810
I'm doing great, right?

1860
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:20,490
Oh shit.

1861
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,110
No!

1862
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:31,960
Alright.

1863
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,100
It's okay.

1864
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,320
Trial and error.

1865
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,200
And we'll figure out grab.

1866
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,940
This is how I've done it before.

1867
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,060
Oh, I think I figured it out!

1868
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:40,840
Trial and error!

1869
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,940
I'll figure out grab by trial and error!

1870
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,340
Oh, fuck.

1871
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,400
Okay, nice.

1872
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,260
Not nice.

1873
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,200
Actually, it's not nice.

1874
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,880
It's not nice anymore, guys.

1875
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,180
It's not nice anymore, guys.

1876
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,200
It's not nice.

1877
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,680
Okay.

1878
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:01,960
Oh.

1879
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,180
No!

1880
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,480
How does she punish?

1881
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,260
Do I hit this?

1882
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,680
No, she definitely blocked that.

1883
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I didn't...

1884
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,760
I can't believe Toki has gone to the deep side.

1885
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,860
I'm shaking and crying.

1886
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,140
Wait, no!

1887
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:20,420
No!

1888
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:21,900
No!

1889
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,880
No, Dwight!

1890
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,540
No!

1891
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,980
You cannot have fun farming me!

1892
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,560
Please!

1893
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:30,960
Please!

1894
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,680
Please!

1895
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,320
No!

1896
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,320
I'm a one and done!

1897
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:43,480
How dare you trick me into getting farmed!

1898
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,300
How dare you trick me into getting farmed!

1899
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,180
You know the best part?

1900
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,800
That we don't have frame drops.

1901
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,240
That's the best part of all of this.

1902
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,540
That we don't have to deal with the frame drops anymore.

1903
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,260
That we don't have to deal with the frame drops anymore.

1904
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:55,660
Alright.

1905
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,020
Nice.

1906
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,080
That's fucking right!

1907
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,260
I learned how to grab, bitch!

1908
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,120
I need to start.

1909
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,520
Remember, stop doing the parry shit.

1910
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,740
I need to start.

1911
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:06,740
Remember, stop doing the parry shit.

1912
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,440
Guys, this is not...

1913
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,220
This is not button mashing friendly.

1914
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,720
Beefcake enjoyers.

1915
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,460
Win again.

1916
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,340
I keep accidentally glowing!

1917
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,220
I can't help it!

1918
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,040
The button is so close to the other buttons!

1919
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,640
Alright, it's okay.

1920
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,120
I can learn.

1921
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,900
If I can learn King...

1922
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,240
No.

1923
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,860
I can learn Keef!

1924
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,760
It is possible!

1925
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,680
I got that one win!

1926
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,400
Guys, remember that one time I won that one round against the real player?

1927
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,980
Those were the good old days.

1928
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,960
That was fucking wild, guys.

1929
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,420
That was actually fucking wild.

1930
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,380
Oh!

1931
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,500
No!

1932
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,480
No!

1933
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,280
No!

1934
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,320
So close!

1935
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,720
No, the other one!

1936
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,080
The other one!

1937
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,720
The other one!

1938
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:17,920
Okay.

1939
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:19,800
You are not...

1940
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,120
You are not firing me.

1941
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,240
Okay, guys.

1942
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,400
I'm gonna go to the tutorial now.

1943
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,360
I'm gonna...

1944
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,660
I'm gonna go to the tutorial now.

1945
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:30,980
I...

1946
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,240
I guess...

1947
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,560
I think this is the moment where I have to go to the tutorial.

1948
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,620
I need to know what the other buttons do.

1949
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:42,960
Alright.

1950
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,400
What the fuck is this?

1951
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:44,760
Okay.

1952
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,120
Let's get started.

1953
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:49,780
Wait.

1954
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,980
I don't care about these guys.

1955
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,720
Walking.

1956
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,280
Alright.

1957
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,680
Walking.

1958
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,520
Are we doing it?

1959
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,160
There is no farm.

1960
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,680
Alright.

1961
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:02,960
Wait.

1962
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,960
Keef can dash?

1963
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,540
There was no dashing in Keef.

1964
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,820
Keef's dash was literally one...

1965
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,320
He literally walked two steps.

1966
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,260
Wait.

1967
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:13,920
This is classic?

1968
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:14,860
Okay.

1969
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,140
No.

1970
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,680
We don't...

1971
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,800
We don't do classic in this town.

1972
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:18,360
Alright.

1973
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,260
Where is... Where is modern?

1974
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,060
Oh!

1975
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,540
There we go.

1976
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,360
Okay.

1977
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:27,860
Alright.

1978
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,020
Now we're... Nice.

1979
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:30,440
Alright.

1980
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,140
Nothing is different, but like we're finally in modern.

1981
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,260
There we go.

1982
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,160
Dashing.

1983
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,060
Alright.

1984
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,500
Nice.

1985
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,620
Keef... Yeah.

1986
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,400
Keef's dashing is a fucking walk.

1987
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,340
Alright.

1988
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,260
To perform?

1989
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,340
What?

1990
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,740
First jump.

1991
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,020
Oh.

1992
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,560
This is jump.

1993
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,600
I have to look down.

1994
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,580
I forgot what controls.

1995
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:55,900
Alright.

1996
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,260
Nice.

1997
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:56,840
Guys.

1998
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,740
I learned how to jump.

1999
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:58,980
Normal attack.

2000
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,600
Alright.

2001
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,480
Modern champion.

2002
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,040
Alright.

2003
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,520
X.

2004
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,280
Which is X?

2005
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:09,560
Okay.

2006
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:10,520
X.

2007
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,480
Nice.

2008
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,620
I did it.

2009
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,280
Give me Keef!

2010
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,380
I don't care!

2011
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,000
Give me Keef!

2012
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,620
I want to train on Keef!

2013
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,540
I'm using X!

2014
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,000
This is X!

2015
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:31,990
What?

2016
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:41,210
Wait.

2017
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:42,710
Which one's...

2018
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,430
Which one's mine?

2019
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,970
But the X isn't on the X on my controller.

2020
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:58,650
Is that square?

2021
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,090
Wait.

2022
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:01,870
Oh.

2023
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:02,990
That doesn't make any sense.

2024
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:04,250
That doesn't...

2025
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,850
How do I change that?

2026
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,750
How do I keep changing that?

2027
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,290
Why am I on X-Box?

2028
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:15,890
Okay.

2029
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:16,570
It's square.

2030
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:17,410
Oh.

2031
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:17,730
Okay.

2032
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,010
That makes more sense now.

2033
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:19,950
Okay.

2034
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,130
Alright.

2035
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:22,830
Okay.

2036
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:23,610
Which one's A?

2037
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,690
Is A X?

2038
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:26,490
Okay.

2039
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:27,250
A is X.

2040
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:28,470
Oh.

2041
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:29,130
Control mapping.

2042
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:29,730
Okay.

2043
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:31,030
Alright.

2044
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,350
We gotta figure this out, guys.

2045
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,230
Edit control.

2046
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,310
Wait.

2047
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,190
How do I change...

2048
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:36,470
No.

2049
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:37,570
I wanna... How do I...

2050
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,590
How do I change it so that...

2051
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:40,510
Okay.

2052
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,250
Alright.

2053
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,870
X is...

2054
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,370
What is X?

2055
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,510
X is square, right?

2056
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:48,510
X is square.

2057
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:50,770
Oh.

2058
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:51,310
Oh.

2059
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:51,850
No.

2060
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,030
Restore.

2061
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,610
No.

2062
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:55,470
This is not it.

2063
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,390
You can't.

2064
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,350
I can't?

2065
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:02,590
Wait.

2066
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:03,570
Wait.

2067
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,710
Oh.

2068
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,190
This is gonna be very difficult.

2069
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,350
Which is B?

2070
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,810
What is this?

2071
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,230
Oh.

2072
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:11,830
Oh.

2073
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,270
Okay.

2074
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:12,650
Okay.

2075
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:13,910
I gotta go to the main menu.

2076
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,590
I was gonna be like, this is...

2077
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,090
This is not it.

2078
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,890
This is not it for me.

2079
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,010
Alright.

2080
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:21,850
Tab.

2081
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:24,190
Okay.

2082
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:24,730
Option.

2083
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:25,870
Alright.

2084
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,670
How do I make it so that...

2085
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:29,210
So that I'm...

2086
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,610
I'm on the...

2087
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:32,430
Uh...

2088
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,190
Which one is it?

2089
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:36,570
Oh.

2090
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,330
There it is.

2091
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,410
But how do I change it?

2092
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:40,810
I don't...

2093
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,330
I don't want it to be Xbox.

2094
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:43,830
How do I change that?

2095
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,370
Other outputs?

2096
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:47,210
Oh.

2097
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:50,610
Type 2.

2098
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:51,230
Oh.

2099
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:51,790
I did it.

2100
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:52,230
Nice.

2101
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:53,190
You guys are so smart.

2102
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:53,790
Alright.

2103
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:54,490
I figured it out.

2104
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,310
Alright.

2105
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:55,830
Now.

2106
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,470
Now we're... Now we're okay.

2107
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:58,370
Alright.

2108
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:58,890
Practice.

2109
00:59:58,930 --> 00:59:59,410
Tutorial.

2110
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:00,570
Alright.

2111
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:01,790
Modern.

2112
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:02,330
Okay.

2113
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:02,690
Now.

2114
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:03,850
Now.

2115
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:04,130
Okay.

2116
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,830
We're going... We're gonna learn how to walk again.

2117
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:06,330
We're gonna...

2118
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,190
We're gonna learn how...

2119
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,270
We're gonna learn how to walk again.

2120
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,330
We're so bad.

2121
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,590
I accidentally pressed... We went all the way back to the beginning.

2122
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:19,930
Alright.

2123
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:20,630
Dashing.

2124
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:21,910
Okay.

2125
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:23,290
Nice.

2126
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:25,430
Alright.

2127
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:26,950
I told you.

2128
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,710
I know my place as the baby.

2129
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,010
I know my fucking place.

2130
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:31,830
Alright.

2131
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:32,070
Uh.

2132
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,150
Alright.

2133
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:35,650
Nice.

2134
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:36,290
Normal attacks.

2135
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,090
Alright.

2136
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:42,510
Okay.

2137
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:42,950
Square.

2138
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:44,450
Nice.

2139
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:46,290
I forgot where the square was for a second.

2140
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:47,210
Uh.

2141
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:48,970
X.

2142
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:49,410
Medium.

2143
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,070
Alright.

2144
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:51,510
Heavy.

2145
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,690
Circle.

2146
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:53,130
Oh.

2147
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:53,490
Heavy.

2148
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:54,850
Okay.

2149
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:56,450
And then.

2150
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,430
I could feel strength.

2151
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:57,870
Thank you.

2152
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:59,070
Wait.

2153
01:00:59,090 --> 01:00:59,410
What's this?

2154
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:00,090
Oh.

2155
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:00,430
Crouch.

2156
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:02,650
I did it.

2157
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:04,490
What am I supposed to do?

2158
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:07,510
What am I supposed to do?

2159
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:08,770
Oh.

2160
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:09,030
Oh.

2161
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:09,330
Attack.

2162
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,790
Okay.

2163
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:10,750
Attack while crouching.

2164
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:11,690
Alright.

2165
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,210
How do I?

2166
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,790
Wait.

2167
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:17,010
What?

2168
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:18,830
What am I supposed to do?

2169
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:19,950
Wait.

2170
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:21,510
What am I?

2171
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:24,710
Jump attack.

2172
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:25,730
But he's not jumping.

2173
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:31,170
How am I supposed to hit him?

2174
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:36,430
Oh.

2175
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:38,230
Okay.

2176
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:39,070
Sorry.

2177
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:39,670
My timing.

2178
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,390
I might have the fastest APM in the world.

2179
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,230
But like the worst timing.

2180
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:49,470
I might not be very good at timing or anything.

2181
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:50,450
I might not be very good at timing or anything.

2182
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:51,010
Okay.

2183
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:54,510
Nice.

2184
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,370
That was easy.

2185
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:56,690
I can do that.

2186
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,150
Give me my 38 defense.

2187
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,070
Okay.

2188
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:00,650
Crouching.

2189
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,730
I do not have rhythm guys.

2190
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:06,070
Okay.

2191
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,770
What?

2192
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:10,910
I can't.

2193
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:13,950
I'm crouching.

2194
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,410
I'm crouching.

2195
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:17,550
Okay.

2196
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:18,790
Okay.

2197
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,610
Okay guys.

2198
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:24,490
Alright.

2199
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:24,890
Throws.

2200
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:25,770
Oh.

2201
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,130
Square.

2202
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:27,750
At the same time.

2203
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,550
Or L2.

2204
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:29,330
Okay.

2205
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,910
L2.

2206
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:31,310
And then.

2207
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:32,510
Press square.

2208
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,390
And X.

2209
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:33,850
Oh.

2210
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:34,970
Okay.

2211
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:35,570
Wait.

2212
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,310
I didn't read that.

2213
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:36,970
What did it say?

2214
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:39,590
Oh.

2215
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,070
Okay.

2216
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:42,150
Those are great options for.

2217
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:42,550
Alright.

2218
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:43,810
Special moves.

2219
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:45,490
Now let's talk.

2220
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,250
If you're playing Luke.

2221
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,190
Pressing triangle will perform.

2222
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:49,250
Okay.

2223
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:50,990
I got this.

2224
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,290
I figured it out guys.

2225
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:54,050
I think I'm ready for rank again.

2226
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:56,390
I think I'm.

2227
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,190
I think.

2228
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,550
Guys do you think I'm ready?

2229
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,610
I think I'm ready for rank.

2230
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,370
Now that I've learned.

2231
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:09,150
You know that combining will let you perform different special moves.

2232
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:09,750
It does.

2233
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,850
Now that I've learned how to throw.

2234
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:13,230
And.

2235
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:15,150
How to throw.

2236
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:17,250
Perform level one.

2237
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,290
What the fuck is N?

2238
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,530
There's an N button?

2239
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:23,890
What the.

2240
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:26,610
There's.

2241
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:27,410
What.

2242
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,430
There's no letters.

2243
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:30,890
In my fucking controller.

2244
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:32,110
Oh.

2245
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:32,810
Neutral.

2246
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:35,590
Okay.

2247
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:38,670
Alright.

2248
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,030
Oh.

2249
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,030
N is neutral.

2250
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:42,050
Okay.

2251
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,470
I was gonna be like.

2252
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,530
Where the fuck are the letters in my controller?

2253
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,550
Where's the letter N?

2254
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,690
Okay.

2255
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,770
That's the other one.

2256
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,010
I'm gonna press the.

2257
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:54,610
Oh.

2258
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:55,210
Okay.

2259
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:57,490
Down.

2260
01:03:59,250 --> 01:03:59,690
Alright.

2261
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:00,550
I figured it out.

2262
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:02,350
I'm gonna.

2263
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:05,050
I'm gonna like forget all this but I figured it out.

2264
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,750
Beast mode baby.

2265
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:09,090
Alright.

2266
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,530
The drive gauge.

2267
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,950
How do I use.

2268
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,070
Oh this is the one I've been using.

2269
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,610
This.

2270
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:20,010
This is the one that kept fucking spamming.

2271
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:21,590
Okay.

2272
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:21,910
Okay.

2273
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:23,750
Alright.

2274
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:25,550
That's fine.

2275
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,170
So it can absorb two attacks.

2276
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:29,790
Oh okay.

2277
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,190
You use it to break through an attack.

2278
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:33,630
Okay.

2279
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:36,650
Oh god.

2280
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:39,510
Alright.

2281
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:40,770
That can.

2282
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:41,910
They can break corner opponents.

2283
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:44,250
Press L1 to perform a drive.

2284
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:44,670
Okay.

2285
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:45,670
Nice.

2286
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:47,830
We're doing it.

2287
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:50,770
Next.

2288
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:52,590
Roll R1 down.

2289
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:53,750
Oh this is the one I love.

2290
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,150
The blue.

2291
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,750
This is the one I kept.

2292
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,230
Oh shit.

2293
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,050
This is the one I kept spamming.

2294
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:03,550
Nice.

2295
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,270
The blue.

2296
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:06,530
Guys.

2297
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:08,570
Would it be lying.

2298
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:09,690
If I say I'm a speed reader.

2299
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,250
And that's why I skip a lot.

2300
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:13,630
While drive pairs are probably.

2301
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,070
I already know that.

2302
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,370
Alright.

2303
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,270
Uh.

2304
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:17,650
Yes.

2305
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:21,190
Hahaha.

2306
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:22,650
Hahaha.

2307
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,630
You don't know that.

2308
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,050
You don't know that.

2309
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,600
I can speed read.

2310
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
But I didn't say I'm good at it.

2311
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,040
Okay.

2312
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,240
You can try to defend against with.

2313
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,060
I never said I was a good.

2314
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:42,660
Speed reader.

2315
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,320
There we go.

2316
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:46,840
Nice.

2317
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:47,100
See.

2318
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,740
That's from my speed reading.

2319
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:51,800
Haha.

2320
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,420
There.

2321
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:54,640
Of course.

2322
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,040
Do a good defense is a good offense.

2323
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,080
So you can counter a drive impact with one of your own.

2324
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,380
But can lead to some big damage.

2325
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:00,900
Okay.

2326
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:04,920
Didn't we just do this?

2327
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh.

2328
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:07,420
Okay.

2329
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:07,860
Guess not.

2330
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,720
I guess not.

2331
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:13,220
Oh.

2332
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:14,500
Hahaha.

2333
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,020
Hahaha.

2334
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,240
Okay.

2335
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:20,760
There we go.

2336
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,020
Red and red.

2337
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,020
Blue and blue.

2338
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:27,820
Burnout.

2339
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,040
Oh.

2340
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,180
This is when you use it all up.

2341
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:31,900
Wait.

2342
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:32,160
What?

2343
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:33,780
Oh.

2344
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,180
Okay.

2345
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,420
When you enter a burnout.

2346
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:39,910
Okay.

2347
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,830
Oh.

2348
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,970
So I do that when there's burnout.

2349
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:45,830
Okay.

2350
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,550
Battle end.

2351
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,070
Now let's go over the rules of engagement.

2352
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:53,350
Alright.

2353
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:55,630
Yeah.

2354
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,350
I did it.

2355
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:57,990
Wait.

2356
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:58,990
Is that everything I need?

2357
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:00,210
To know?

2358
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,390
To win this game?

2359
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:03,530
Is that it?

2360
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:05,970
Guys.

2361
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:06,590
I think I'm ready.

2362
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,270
I think I'm ready for rank.

2363
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:09,530
Hahaha.

2364
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:11,970
Yes.

2365
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:13,650
Guys.

2366
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:14,310
I think I'm ready.

2367
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:15,770
I think I'm ready for rank now.

2368
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:16,630
Like.

2369
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:18,010
Watch this.

2370
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:19,370
I learned this.

2371
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:21,150
And then I learned.

2372
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:22,350
I learned how to throw.

2373
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,230
I learned how to do this.

2374
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:26,610
Look at that.

2375
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,710
I know that does that.

2376
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:30,550
Look at that.

2377
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,650
And I know this throw.

2378
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:36,990
This is all I need for game.

2379
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:37,370
Right?

2380
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:40,750
Good on you.

2381
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:43,530
I have the winning formula.

2382
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:44,910
Good fight.

2383
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:45,150
Look.

2384
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,370
He even said good fight.

2385
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:48,950
Alright.

2386
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:49,610
I'm ready.

2387
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:50,670
It's over.

2388
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,960
It's so over.

2389
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,640
It's so over.

2390
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:00,460
Guys.

2391
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,580
It's so over.

2392
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,500
Hahaha.

2393
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,200
For them by the way.

2394
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:06,900
Not for me.

2395
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,480
For them.

2396
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,360
It's so over for them.

2397
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,200
Hahaha.

2398
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,540
Wait.

2399
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,220
Hahaha.

2400
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:19,060
Kill me.

2401
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,000
Hahaha.

2402
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,760
How the fuck.

2403
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:25,500
Hahaha.

2404
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:28,640
Fuck.

2405
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,240
I actually couldn't.

2406
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:33,320
Fuck.

2407
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,460
I can't pay attention now.

2408
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:37,660
Hahaha.

2409
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,540
Oh my god.

2410
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:40,780
Fuck.

2411
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,560
I can't even focus.

2412
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,580
Hahaha.

2413
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:44,880
Hahaha.

2414
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,300
Oh my god.

2415
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:47,680
Okay.

2416
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:48,820
Sorry.

2417
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,020
This is actually fucking hilarious.

2418
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:56,180
Like what are the odds that we can win to each other.

2419
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:57,180
Hahaha.

2420
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,920
What the fuck are the odds of that.

2421
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,980
Oh my god.

2422
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,560
Hahaha.

2423
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:05,360
Hahaha.

2424
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,300
Oh my god.

2425
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:08,880
Guys.

2426
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,860
I think she actually knows how to play this game.

2427
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,540
Guys.

2428
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,860
I think she like knows.

2429
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,980
I told you guys.

2430
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,020
Hahaha.

2431
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,160
She knows it.

2432
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,080
They are all crying news.

2433
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,660
She actually read the tutorial.

2434
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:25,800
Hahaha.

2435
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,220

How did she know.

2438
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,080
How did I.

2439
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,180
Oh never mind.

2440
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:35,680
That's how.

2441
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:36,760
Hahaha.

2442
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:37,960
Hahaha.

2443
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,260
How do I do shit.

Hahaha.

2445
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,660
Okay.

2446
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,440
That's fucking right.

2447
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,900
I know how to throw.

2448
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,360
Hahaha.

2449
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,600
That's all I'm gonna do.

2450
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:52,920
Hahaha.

2451
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,180
Hahaha.

2452
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:54,260
Hahaha.

2453
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,580
That's right.

01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,920
I know how to throw.

2455
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,300

2458
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,200

Get grappled.

2462
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,800
Get grappled.

2463
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,360
Get grappled.

2464
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,440
Hahaha.

2465
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,520
Get closer and I'll grapple you.

2466
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:26,760
Oh never mind.

2467
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:27,400
Don't do that.

2468
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,100
Don't do that.

2469
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,460
That's fucking right.

2470
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,160
Oh.

2471
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,400
That's fucking right.

2472
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,080
I will come back to throw you.

2473
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:45,450
Oh.

2474
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:47,850
That's fucking right.

2475
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:49,170
Get grappled.

2476
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,770
I will keep doing it too.

2477
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:53,630
Hahaha.

2478
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:55,570
Hahaha.

2479
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:57,670
Oh no.

2480
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:58,610
That's not what I wanted.

2481
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:00,210
Yeah.

2482
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,740
Oh shit.

2483
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:09,780
Hahaha.

2484
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,520
Hahaha.

2485
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:12,980
Get grappled.

2486
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,880
I defeated a real player.

2487
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,160
I left.

2488
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,000
Hahaha.

2489
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:30,620
The first real player.

2490
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,200
I beat.

2491
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,400
Hahaha.

2492
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,720
Hahaha.

2493
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,520
Hahaha.

2494
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:40,200
Hahaha.

2495
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,000
Hahaha.

2496
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,320
Hahaha.

2497
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:42,840
Hahaha.

2498
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,040
Hahaha.

2499
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,540
Get grappled.

2500
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,680
Hahaha.

2501
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,300
You were the first real person.

2502
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,120
I beat.

2503
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,380
You were the first real person.

2504
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,760
I beat.

2505
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:01,860
You were the first real person.

2506
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,600
I hate you.

2507
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:04,200
Hahaha.

2508
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,820
Why did you rematch me?

2509
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,440
I hate you.

2510
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:08,440
Hahaha.

2511
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,020
Bye.

2512
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,460
Hahaha.

2513
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,120
The first real person.

2514
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,700
I beat today.

2515
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:19,880
Hahaha.

2516
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,300
Hahaha.

2517
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,780
Because I think I'm meant to play GEEF.

2518
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,120
Because I think I'm meant to play GEEF.

2519
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:28,500
Hahaha.

2520
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,740
No rematch.

2521
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,120
Hahaha.

2522
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,340
Oh my god.

2523
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:35,980
Oh my god.

2524
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:36,860
I'm a GEEF player.

2525
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:38,620
Oh.

2526
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,080
Guys.

2527
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,820
Don't GEEF.

2528
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,180
Because I think Zanky.

2529
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:45,440
Okay.

2530
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,620
Do we get Zanky or don't GEEF?

2531
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,720
What are we?

2532
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:50,780
Alright.

2533
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,660
Is there like...

2534
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:52,980
Okay.

2535
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,400
No.

2536
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,060
I like the red.

2537
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,080
I like the red.

2538
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,180
There you go.

2539
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,020
There's no more.

2540
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,080
Hahaha.

2541
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,660
No GEEF.

2542
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,160
Hahaha.

2543
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:08,240
I can't believe she was literally the first player I won.

2544
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,820
And all I did was this.

2545
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:13,220
And literally all I did.

2546
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:14,400
Hahaha.

2547
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,340
Hahaha.

2548
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:21,200
Hahaha.

2549
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,240
Alright.

2550
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,400
New challenger.

2551
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,880
New challenger.

2552
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,640
Going all the way.

2553
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,640
She's asking Twine how to beat me.

2554
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,500
She's asking Twine how to beat me.

2555
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:34,420
Hahaha.

2556
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:40,500
I think she was doing real combos too.

2557
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,880
I think she was doing real combos too.

2558
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,540
I think that was like...

2559
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,320
That was the funniest shit.

2560
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,360
The fact that she was doing real moves.

2561
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,040
I'm just like, grappa.

2562
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,000
Oh, oh no.

2563
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:54,780
Grappa.

2564
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:01,380
Grappa.

2565
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,340
Okay, it's fine.

2566
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:10,100
Bro, you're gonna let me grappa, right?

2567
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,680
Oh no.

2568
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,560
Oh shit.

2569
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,180
Oh, hey there.

2570
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,020
That was an accident.

2571
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,200
Grappa.

2572
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,280
That's all I need to know.

2573
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,060
Oh shit.

2574
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:21,880
Maybe not.

2575
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,880
Maybe that's not all I need.

2576
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,580
Oh no, he got me.

2577
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,240
He got me.

2578
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,840
Somebody stop.

2579
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,160
How do I not do enough damage on him?

2580
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,380
Is it because he's buff?

2581
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:39,080
Does like size change the amount of damage he takes?

2582
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:40,140
Oh shit.

2583
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,280
It's not fair.

2584
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,900
Get closer so I can do this.

2585
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,000
I need you to get closer.

2586
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,160
Oh.

2587
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:48,800
No.

2588
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,000
No.

2589
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,520
He didn't figure it out.

2590
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,860
How does he figure this out?

2591
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,540
It's okay.

2592
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,960
It's the moral victory that I've had.

2593
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,760
How did he figure it out that I only know two moves?

2594
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,800
That's actually crazy.

2595
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:04,960
Grappa.

2596
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,000
You're not supposed to adapt.

2597
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,340
Gumi didn't adapt.

2598
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,660
It's all downhill from there.

2599
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,700
He's rookie two no longer.

2600
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,540
Oh my god, no way.

2601
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,760
We're one and done.

2602
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,720
He used it.

2603
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,940
I can't believe it.

2604
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,260
By pressing triangle?

2605
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:35,180
Okay.

2606
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:36,260
This.

2607
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:37,900
Alright.

2608
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,740
Ohhhh!

2609
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:39,840
Okay.

2610
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,500
Triangle.

2611
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:42,860
Alright.

2612
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,600
We figured it out.

2613
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,980
We figured out other triangle moves that we can use.

2614
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:48,960
Alright, this.

2615
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:55,320
Okay, we gotta do this triangle and then this triangle and then...

2616
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,740
Oh, now you're playing Geef.

2617
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,820
Okay, we figured it out.

2618
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,400
We're so ready.

2619
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,520
Hold R2 triangle for more damage.

2620
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:08,380
Where's R2 triangle?

2621
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:08,860
Oh, there.

2622
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,580
Alright, we figured it out guys.

2623
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,400
It's so over.

2624
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,100
It's so over.

2625
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,660
Even Brawl Pro is playing Geef.

2626
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,480
New move unlocked.

2627
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,920
Oh my god, I figured it out.

2628
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:36,000
I can't believe they wanted me to play Honda.

2629
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,260
I can't believe it.

2630
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,580
They wanted me to play Honda when I could just do this.

2631
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:47,580
How do I do?

2632
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,380
How do I level 3 again?

2633
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:50,260
Was it...

2634
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,940
No, that's not it.

2635
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,080
I'm trying to remember.

2636
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:53,840
How do I do it again?

2637
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:54,880
Oh, this!

2638
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:55,900
Whoa!

2639
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,120
Triangle circle.

2640
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,340
I don't know your style.

2641
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,120
Grandpa!

2642
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:11,260
Grandpa!

2643
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,780
Hello, Grandpa.

2644
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,800
Alright, I figured it out.

2645
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,660
Okay, I'm ready.

2646
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,400
What the fuck?

2647
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,320
What the fuck did he do?

2648
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,200
What?

2649
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:30,760
What?

2650
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:31,700
What?

2651
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,600
Guys, maybe now I... guys...

2652
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,560
Guys, I think I know why...

2653
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,060
I think I know why they want me to do Honda.

2654
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,060
How do I get close?

2655
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:47,940
What the fuck?

2656
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,000
He didn't get in.

2657
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,000
How do I get in if I can't even make it through it?

2658
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,440
Grandpa's making so I can't touch him.

2659
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,320
Grandpa, please!

2660
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,940
I need this Grandpa.

2661
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,660
This is not fair, Grandpa.

2662
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:06,740
What?

2663
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,600
How do I...

2664
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:09,340
How do I block?

2665
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,000
Oh, jump?

2666
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,460
You have to jump in?

2667
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,000
Okay, I almost killed him, though.

2668
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,860
Actually, I almost killed him.

2669
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,460
Welcome to JV.

2670
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:21,500
Oh, God.

2671
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:22,660
Oh, my God.

2672
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,500
What is this bullshit?

2673
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,960
What is this bullshit?

2674
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,380
You have to let me get to you!

2675
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,560
Can't let me get to you!

2676
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:39,300
Can't let me get to you!

2677
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,200
Oh, no.

2678
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:40,980
Oh, no.

2679
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,020
He grabbed me.

2680
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,780
This is anime, Sony.

2681
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,020
This is so fucked.

2682
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,840
This is actually so fucked.

2683
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:51,760
Get down!

2684
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:53,700
That's right.

2685
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,800
It's time to retire, Grandpa.

2686
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:58,960
It's...

2687
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,140
I need to unbind the...

2688
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,320
I need to unbind...

2689
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,220
Let me get close.

2690
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,900
Let me...

2691
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,820
Ow.

2692
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,420
Go, start timing.

2693
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,080
Oh, my God.

2694
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:10,340
Please.

2695
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,640
Please, you got to let me grab.

2696
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,920
You got to let me grab.

2697
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,680
I'm going to unbind the Perry button.

2698
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,560
Welcome to the real world.

2699
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,440
I'm going to unbind the Perry button.

2700
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,900
I'm actually, only Perry.

2701
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,360
This is the real world.

2702
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,180
Bro.

2703
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,800
We have sent out Grandpa to open Power methicon.

2704
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,540
Past retirement, we're gonna buy a coffin for that grandpa.

2705
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,660
I need to learn.

2706
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,840
I need to learn.

2707
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,760
When you say aware, prepare, you jump.

2708
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,320
But there's a different projectile with a different voice line.

2709
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:52,860
I hope to god nobody is smart enough to learn grandpa.

2710
01:19:53,320 --> 01:20:01,220
I hope to fucking god nobody is smart enough to learn him.

2711
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:03,280
That was actually bullshit.

2712
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,480
How do I time that?

2713
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,780
I don't know how to time.

2714
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,200
Timing is so hard.

2715
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,460
Oh Akuma.

2716
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,500
Is that Akuma?

2717
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,110
Wait, not Akuma.

2718
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,670
Oh yeah, it is.

2719
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:26,590
Is Gumi still raging?

2720
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,410
I'm literally in another game.

2721
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:35,290
How is she still raging?

2722
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:35,590
I'm literally in another game.

2723
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:39,030
I'm literally in another game right now.

2724
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,710
Let me grab you!

2725
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:48,350
Grab!

2726
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:50,430
That's right.

2727
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,630
Oh shit.

2728
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:53,430
Oh shit.

2729
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:55,750
You fucking know I wanna grab you so badly!

2730
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:58,270
You know this is all I know!

2731
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,010
That's fucking right!

2732
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:06,590
That's literally all I know!

2733
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:10,830
Alright.

2734
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:14,010
Lose don't lose.

2735
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:18,570
I can't help it.

2736
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:19,790
He's so fucking...

2737
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:22,010
He's so rangy!

2738
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,930
Wait, he grabbed me?

2739
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:27,330
I grabbed you!

2740
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,150
That's...

2741
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:29,430
Oh.

2742
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:32,870
That's right.

2743
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:34,350
I must hit...

2744
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:38,890
It's okay.

2745
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:39,930
We're fine.

2746
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:42,910
No, we're not fine!

2747
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,550
We're not fine!

2748
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:44,950
It's okay.

2749
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:45,450
We're fine!

2750
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:47,370
We're still fine!

2751
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:49,410
Okay.

2752
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:51,270
Okay.

2753
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:53,110
Nice.

2754
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:53,710
Alright.

2755
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:57,510
No!

2756
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,250
No!

2757
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:04,590
He is the Shadow Man!

2758
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:08,770
Not the crap dead dead!

2759
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,030
I'm dead dead!

2760
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:15,910
Yeah.

2761
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:19,490
Oh come on!

2762
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:21,070
Let me fucking grab you!

2763
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:22,090
This is all I want!

2764
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:24,350
This is all I want!

2765
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:26,690
That's fucking right!

2766
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,910
Grab!

2767
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:33,590
I will grab you for the rest of my life!

2768
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:34,550
Get over here!

2769
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:40,910
Oh no, fuck.

2770
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:43,430
I messed that up, oops.

2771
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:45,590
Oh, what?

2772
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:47,130
No.

2773
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,690
You have to let me grab you.

2774
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:51,950
That's right!

2775
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,550
One more grab!

2776
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:56,310
One more grab!

2777
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:01,670
I'm too big to dash!

2778
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,750
I'm way too fucking big to dash!

2779
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:08,410
Just grab and dash as a fucking walk to the park!

2780
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:13,570
Oh my god.

2781
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:14,430
Alright.

2782
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:16,890
I don't remember the other.

2783
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:17,590
What were the other?

2784
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:18,250
Oh, this one.

2785
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,970
Up triangle.

2786
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:21,110
I don't remember up triangle.

2787
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:23,050
Run.

2788
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:23,510
Grab.

2789
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,930
I'm too swole!

2790
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,490
I'm too swole to do it!

2791
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:28,270
Okay.

2792
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:29,250
Back.

2793
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:31,350
You need a jump.

2794
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:32,630
Alright.

2795
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:34,170
Thank you.

2796
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,170
Guys, one more.

2797
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:38,710
Okay, I'll do the character guide after I do one more rank match.

2798
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:39,490
I want a place.

2799
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,390
I want a place.

2800
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:43,370
Remember, you can jump forward.

2801
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:44,570
I can jump forward?

2802
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,430
Wait, is it Gumi again?

2803
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:52,810
Only I know.

2804
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:53,770
Oh no, it's not.

2805
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:54,190
Okay.

2806
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:55,090
It's Brimo Bunny.

2807
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:57,070
I know Gumi is playing her.

2808
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,210
That's why I was like, is that her again?

2809
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:01,410
Is she still...

2810
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:02,870
Is she still inky?

2811
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:04,330
Like...

2812
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:11,830
Oh no.

2813
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:13,250
That's fine.

2814
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:15,030
That's fine.

2815
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:15,730
Grab!

2816
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,410
Oh shit.

2817
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:32,490
He punished me.

2818
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:33,510
Oh.

2819
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:38,860
Oh shit, no.

2820
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,100
I didn't mean to.

2821
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,500
Please, let me grab you!

2822
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,320
Nice.

2823
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:44,660
Alright.

2824
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:46,400
Now I did like 200 million.

2825
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,120
Oh, do I get this out?

2826
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:48,540
No!

2827
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,440
She gets this!

2828
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:51,860
Oh.

2829
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:53,500
Alright, nice.

2830
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,340
I blocked it off.

2831
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:57,420
Oh.

2832
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,200
Alright, come on.

2833
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,400
Come on.

2834
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:00,780
No!

2835
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,020
No!

2836
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:04,900
Come on!

2837
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:05,780
Let me grab you!

2838
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:06,680
No!

2839
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:07,880
You're so close!

2840
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,780
She wouldn't let me grab you!

2841
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,900
I just wanna grab!

2842
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,260
No!

2843
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:22,650
Okay, that's good.

2844
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:24,850
That's good!

2845
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:26,630
I got the thing I wanted to do!

2846
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,230
Nice!

2847
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:30,990
Get countered!

2848
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:34,430
No!

2849
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:36,590
Okay.

2850
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:37,630
Come on.

2851
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:38,990
Come on!

2852
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:39,250
Yes!

2853
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:40,130
Okay.

2854
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,410
You can't dodge this, bitch!

2855
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:50,030
That's fucking right!

2856
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:51,790
You can't get this!

2857
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,970
You're on a win streak!

2858
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:54,110
Oh!

2859
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:56,290
Too bad!

2860
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:03,730
Too fucking bad!

2861
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:08,450
Have the opponent's HP!

2862
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:09,970
Get over here!

2863
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,310
Get over here!

2864
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:17,830
This is the only thing I know.

2865
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,410
Oh no!

2866
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:22,150
I messed it up!

2867
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:22,450
No!

2868
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:28,660
No!

2869
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,740
She got it before me!

2870
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,300
Oh no!

2871
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,280
Oh no!

2872
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,400
Oh no, guys!

2873
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,460
Guys, she knows!

2874
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,360
She knows!

2875
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:38,980
I had one!

2876
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,320
She downloaded me!

2877
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:40,960
She knows!

2878
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,840
She knows that I don't know a lot of moves!

2879
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:46,680
How did she figure it out?

2880
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,540
Oh my god!

2881
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,880
I don't understand!

2882
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,760
How the fuck did she figure it out?

2883
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,360
I don't understand!

2884
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,760
This is literally the only thing I can do.

2885
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,120
No!

2886
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,720
She thought faster!

2887
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,600
She thought faster than me!

2888
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,020
She thought faster than me!

2889
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,300
Who was that?

2890
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,580
I became rookie.

2891
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,680
Who was that?

2892
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,600
Who was that?

2893
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:19,680
I became rookie.

2894
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,240
Okay.

2895
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:22,740
Alright.

2896
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:25,100
What was it?

2897
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:25,540
View tutorial?

2898
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,600
Where is...

2899
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,540
How do I...

2900
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:29,880
No.

2901
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:30,940
I don't want to fight.

2902
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,480
Return to mode select.

2903
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,380
Alright.

2904
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,520
How do I...

2905
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,340
Oh, character guides!

2906
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,220
There it is.

2907
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:41,620
Alright.

2908
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,400
Yes.

2909
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,680
I don't fucking know.

2910
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,000
Alright.

2911
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:53,820
How do I play this guy?

2912
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:56,500
Alright.

2913
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:00,630
Alright.

2914
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:00,930
Alright.

2915
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:02,690
Continue to the next guy.

2916
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:03,250
Double!

2917
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:04,250
Alright.

2918
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:05,950
What is that?

2919
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:08,790
How do I do that?

2920
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:10,970
Keep them locked down?

2921
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,830
Yeah, but what's the move?

2922
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,570
Wait, it doesn't even let me...

2923
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:15,210
What?

2924
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:18,410
What are the buttons?

2925
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:20,350
Wait!

2926
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,030
Throw an opponent...

2927
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:24,130
What are the buttons?

2928
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:25,270
How am I...

2929
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:30,370
Guys, I told you I'm a speed reader.

2930
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:32,210
Guys, I told you.

2931
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:34,410
But what are the buttons?

2932
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:36,350
But what are the buttons?

2933
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,310
What are the fucking buttons?

2934
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:38,630
What are the fucking buttons?

2935
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:41,470
How do I do that?

2936
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,390
How do I do that?

2937
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:45,710
Reigning is fundamental.

2938
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:48,810
Behold the red cyclone.

2939
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:51,370
A devastatingly powerful throw.

2940
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:53,910
It reaches long and its damage is immense.

2941
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:54,410
It reaches long and its damage is immense.

2942
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:58,150
But like...

2943
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,010
How do I...

2944
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,550
Okay.

2945
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,350
Okay, maybe not...

2946
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:06,110
Okay, combo trials.

2947
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,490
Maybe that's it.

2948
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:08,430
Okay.

2949
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,250
I'm just like... I don't...

2950
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:12,370
What does that mean?

2951
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,830
I don't just...

2952
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:18,650
Okay.

2953
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:21,350
Okay.

2954
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:21,930
Okay.

2955
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:22,610
Machine gun.

2956
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,710
Where is it?

2957
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:26,670
Where's the buttons?

2958
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:29,850
RS?

2959
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:31,650
Which one's RS?

2960
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:36,140
What?

2961
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,280
Okay.

2962
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,420
Command list?

2963
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:44,860
What's RS?

2964
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:48,860
What's RS?

2965
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,420
What's RS?

2966
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:52,860
What's...

2967
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:56,680
What the fuck is RS?

2968
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,320
R3?

2969
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,800
This?

2970
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,480
Is this RS?

2971
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:05,800
Is it...

2972
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,020
Right...

2973
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,380
Oh, right stick!

2974
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,780
Then what do I do?

2975
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:16,440
Wait.

2976
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,940
Okay.

2977
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,260
Okay.

2978
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,060
That's it.

2979
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,160
Alright.

2980
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,740
This.

2981
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:28,880
Okay.

2982
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,040
This.

2983
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,300
Alright.

2984
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,140
I need help.

2985
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,480
I don't know how to...

2986
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,820
It doesn't show me the...

2987
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:41,060
The buttons.

2988
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:41,880
I...

2989
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:48,980
I don't know what I'm doing.

2990
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,380
Try... Oh, there we go.

2991
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,980
Oh, thank god.

2992
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:56,700
There we go.

2993
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,780
What the fuck is yellow M?

2994
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,300
The fuck is yellow M?

2995
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:04,340
Okay.

2996
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,320
Okay.

2997
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:07,940
Control settings.

2998
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,400
Okay.

2999
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:10,180
X.

3000
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:10,600
Okay.

3001
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:11,700
Okay.

3002
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:13,480
Yellow M is X.

3003
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,240
How do I show that?

3004
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:19,530
How do I...

3005
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:20,950
How does it show it?

3006
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:26,440
Oh, medium.

3007
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,540
Which one is medium?

3008
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:31,740
Which...

3009
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,440
Okay.

3010
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,700
This is blue.

3011
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:34,720
Red.

3012
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:35,820
Yellow.

3013
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:36,200
Okay.

3014
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:36,520
Yellow.

3015
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:39,100
Alright.

3016
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:39,700
There we go.

3017
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,420
You're not...

3018
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:41,600
Exactly.

3019
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,280
Okay, guys.

3020
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,120
I need to grab...

3021
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,140
I need to grab water.

3022
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,080
I'll be right back.

3023
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:50,720
I'll be right back.

3024
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:52,660
Like, why is it not...

3025
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,960
Why is it not shapes?

3026
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:55,560
Why is it color?

3027
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,620
I can't read color.

3028
01:31:58,700 --> 01:31:59,460
The fuck

3029
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,240
is blue?

3030
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,620
Give me...

3031
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,580
Do I have to, like, write the color?

3032
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:19,240
Don't get...

3033
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,200
I need to get markers.

3034
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:32,120
Guys, I need to get, like, markers.

3035
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,060
And I need to color my controller stick.

3036
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:35,040
I need to...

3037
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,860
I need to color my...

3038
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:38,460
My leverless controller.

3039
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,520
So I can figure out what the fuck is blue.

3040
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:42,500
Like...

3041
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:44,400
Okay.

3042
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,520
Okay.

3043
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:47,240
Blue is...

3044
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,360
Blue is square.

3045
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,560
Square.

3046
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,240
Okay.

3047
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:52,600
There we go.

3048
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,500
How do I... What?

3049
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:56,320
Okay.

3050
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,040
This is... Not this?

3051
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:58,860
No.

3052
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:01,020
Oh, this is yellow!

3053
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:01,580
Fuck!

3054
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:02,320
X is yellow!

3055
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,160
Okay.

3056
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:04,740
X is yellow.

3057
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,480
X is yellow.

3058
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,440
X is yellow.

3059
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:11,560
Okay.

3060
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:12,700
We're doing it.

3061
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:13,740
Alright.

3062
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:17,980
It's so difficult.

3063
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,260
What the fuck is auto press button blue?

3064
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:22,720
Okay.

3065
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,380
Blue is...

3066
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,480
Auto button press blue?

3067
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:33,220
What the fuck is auto?

3068
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:34,120
What the fuck is auto?

3069
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:34,380
What the fuck is auto?

3070
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:34,520
Is this?

3071
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,340
Oh, auto!

3072
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,140
I figured it out.

3073
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,980
I figured it out.

3074
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,580
It's the auto button.

3075
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,240
Nice.

3076
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:44,520
Okay.

3077
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:45,300
I figured it out.

3078
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,300
I figured it out.

3079
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:49,580
Alright.

3080
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:50,440
This is auto.

3081
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:53,260
Nice.

3082
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:53,520
Nice.

3083
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,020
We did it.

3084
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:59,500
Oh, you mean I can just press this and just do all the combos?

3085
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:01,680
It's over.

3086
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,820
It's so over!

3087
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:05,480
Wait...

3088
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,060
I can literally press R2 and do the combos!

3089
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:09,740
Oh my god.

3090
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,160
This is...

3091
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,440
I love modern Q... Okay, I'm ready.

3092
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:12,920
I'm fucking ready.

3093
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,560
I can let the gameplay for me.

3094
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:17,040
I love it.

3095
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:44,540
Knowing that I know I know I'm ready I'm so ready oh she getting cut I saw something tell me she's getting coached on Keith I think she's the only person I That's why Ashley won.

3096
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:55,800
She suffered so much emotional damage.

3097
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,220
All I did was lose too.

3098
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:06,500
I didn't even know about the triangle until now.

3099
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,900
You actually hurt Bentley.

3100
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,820
God, I love fighting games.

3101
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:19,780
I'm so ready.

3102
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,880
I'm so fucking ready.

3103
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:27,540
Oh shit, I need to remember not to do that.

3104
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:28,180
What is this?

3105
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,040
Is it triangle?

3106
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,360
Okay, it's triangle circle.

3107
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:39,620
You see, this is why I went in with zero ego.

3108
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:43,360
Like, I know my place in this game.

3109
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,520
So I went in with zero ego.

3110
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:51,430
Wait,

3111
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,010
what?

3112
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:10,350
Right triangle.

3113
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,150
No I can't.

3114
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:14,990
Where's right triangle?

3115
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:17,630
Am I looking at the right same right?

3116
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:21,970
Am I even looking at the same right?

3117
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:23,250
I have zero LP.

3118
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:27,010
Wait, how much LP is it to rank up?

3119
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:29,850
That's right.

3120
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:31,270
It's over for you, grandpa.

3121
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:33,930
It's so over for you.

3122
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:35,790
I learned about L2.

3123
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:37,450
Wait, you're in Modern Controls 2?

3124
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:42,110
Who let you be on Modern Controls?

3125
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:46,290
Oh shit.

3126
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:47,710
Nice!

3127
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:50,530
Uh oh, not nice.

3128
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:51,150
Not nice.

3129
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:52,050
Not nice.

3130
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,970
Come on, get it closer.

3131
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:56,610
Get closer.

3132
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:57,190
Get closer.

3133
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:58,910
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3134
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:00,410
No, stop getting closer.

3135
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:02,130
Stop getting closer.

3136
01:37:04,570 --> 01:37:05,010
Yes!

3137
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,390
That's fucking right.

3138
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:10,510
That's right.

3139
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:12,070
Get out of here!

3140
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:18,610
Whoop!

3141
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:20,070
Whoop!

3142
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:23,510
Oh, come on.

3143
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:32,230
That's fucking right.

3144
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:33,050
That's right!

3145
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:34,250
Get grabbed!

3146
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:38,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3147
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:40,950
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3148
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:42,090
Oh.

3149
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:43,790
Come on.

3150
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:45,190
This is not fair.

3151
01:37:45,930 --> 01:37:46,730
This is not fair!

3152
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,000
That's right.

3153
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:56,300
Stop it.

3154
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:56,460
Stop it.

3155
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,520
Get punched!

3156
01:37:58,680 --> 01:37:59,660
He was red?

3157
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:00,580
Oh!

3158
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:03,620
Come on.

3159
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,760
Oh, I'm fucked.

3160
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:07,940
I'm so fucked.

3161
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,220
Holy shit.

3162
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,160
Oh yeah.

3163
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,780
That's GG's.

3164
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,400
That's GG's for me.

3165
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,060
Oh my god.

3166
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:22,180
I did a fucking Yamcha pose in the end.

3167
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,180
I got demons so hard.

3168
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:27,780
That's fucking right.

3169
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:29,220
Grabbed!

3170
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:33,060
Oh no.

3171
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:33,500
Oh no.

3172
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,060
Come on.

3173
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:35,860
Come on!

3174
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:36,900
Haha!

3175
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,140
And then...

3176
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:43,620
Grab!

3177
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,040
That's fucking right.

3178
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,020
Grab!

3179
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:50,480
Hahaha.

3180
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:51,360
Oh no.

3181
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,040
JK.

3182
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:53,540
Hahaha.

3183
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,300
Oh no.

3184
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:56,980
JK.

3185
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,700
Wait, how does that do nothing?

3186
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,040
Big damage!

3187
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:04,440
Oh!

3188
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:05,840
That's right.

3189
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,560
No win streak for you.

3190
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:10,580
You're the second person I beat today.

3191
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:11,480
Hahaha.

3192
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,320
You're...

3193
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:18,380
You're the second person I beat today.

3194
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,440
Hahaha.

3195
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,240
That's fucking right.

3196
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:26,860
He lost his win streak on a guy that's only won two games.

3197
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:28,540
Hahaha.

3198
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:33,880
Hahaha.

3199
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:34,780
Yeah, I think I like Keef.

3200
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:35,900
It's been pretty fun.

3201
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,080
Oh, I beat three people today.

3202
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:46,380
Okay, you guys know damn well that if you go fast, fast, parry, press parry and dash.

3203
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,940
Guys, this is my dash.

3204
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:51,480
This is how Keef dashes.

3205
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:52,600
Hahaha.

3206
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:54,820
Little hop.

3207
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:55,760
Little bunny hop.

3208
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:56,520
Little bunny hop.

3209
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:57,200
Hahaha.

3210
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:57,940
Hahaha.

3211
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:00,960
Bunny hop.

3212
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:01,760
Bunny hop.

3213
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,260
Hahaha.

3214
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:04,080
Hahaha.

3215
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,200
Hold parry and then dash.

3216
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,860
Oh my god, this is over.

3217
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,600
I learned to move faster.

3218
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,240
It's so over.

3219
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:17,260
I learned to move even faster.

3220
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,720
Oh my god.

3221
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:24,340
From little bunny hop to fucking manly hop.

3222
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,640
The bear runs.

3223
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,240
Alright.

3224
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:34,240
I wonder why does anybody want to queue into me?

3225
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:38,720
Guys, why doesn't anybody want to queue into me?

3226
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:40,220
Alright, you know what?

3227
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,040
I know what to do.

3228
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,040
I know what to do.

3229
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:44,740
It's time.

3230
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,040
It's time.

3231
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,040
Hahaha.

3232
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:52,680
Okay, one on one.

3233
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,020
Singles.

3234
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:57,180
Get in here.

3235
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,040
Hahaha.

3236
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,520
I'm on the left.

3237
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:04,120
Get in here.

3238
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:04,380
Get in here.

3239
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:06,380
Wait, passcode off?

3240
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,740
Wait, how do I make a passcode?

3241
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:08,840
Wait, JK, sorry.

3242
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:09,540
Not yet.

3243
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:13,120
I just realized that I didn't even make a passcode.

3244
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,460
Alright, give me a sec.

3245
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:15,140
Hahaha.

3246
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,500
Okay, I'll figure this out.

3247
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,440
Oh wait, no.

3248
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,480
That's not it.

3249
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:21,600
Create room.

3250
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,300
How the fuck role setting?

3251
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:24,780
Role setting.

3252
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:27,420
Uhhhh.

3253
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:30,260
Uhhhh.

3254
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:34,300
One, one, one, one, one.

3255
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,140
There you go.

3256
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:37,340
How do you guys get in?

3257
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,840
Anyway, like, create room.

3258
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,360
Is that it?

3259
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,660
Alright, it's over.

3260
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,520
Alright guys, get in here.

3261
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:48,780
Hahaha.

3262
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,200
Hahaha.

3263
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:53,260
I'll show you the power.

3264
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,780
Wait, you're diamond.

3265
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,680
Wait, not there.

3266
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,920
But not there though.

3267
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,200
Get in here.

3268
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,900
Okay, that's a lot better.

3269
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:03,640
Hahaha.

3270
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:06,640
Hahaha.

3271
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:12,580
Hahaha.

3272
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,040
Hahaha.

3273
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:16,680
Bro, he's fucking diamond.

3274
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,740
Like, I'm not gonna win against that.

3275
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:20,060
Hahaha.

3276
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:20,720
I'm not.

3277
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,500
I'm not gonna win against that.

3278
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:28,970
Watch this.

3279
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:31,670
I learned how to play today.

3280
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:34,690
Oh, yeah.

3281
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:35,430
You got it.

3282
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:36,930
Imagine being...

3283
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:37,490
Oh, shit.

3284
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:38,090
I'm so sorry.

3285
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:39,150
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

3286
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:40,090
I'm so sorry.

3287
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:41,810
Oh, ma'am.

3288
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:42,250
I'm sorry.

3289
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:43,650
Ma'am.

3290
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:49,630
Let me have a hit, ma'am.

3291
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:50,370
Hahaha.

3292
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:51,330
Hahaha.

3293
01:42:53,610 --> 01:42:54,650
Holy shit.

3294
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:55,550
Hahaha.

3295
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:57,630
Okay.

3296
01:42:58,170 --> 01:42:59,650
We gotta figure this out.

3297
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:01,530
Guys, it's okay.

3298
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:02,190
It's okay.

3299
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:03,290
I let her win.

3300
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:05,090
I let her have that one win, guys.

3301
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:06,110
Like...

3302
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:07,310
It's okay.

3303
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:08,670
She's on fucking classic.

3304
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:09,690
It's over for her.

3305
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:12,830
Like, the moment I figured this out, it's so over.

3306
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:13,830
Like...

3307
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:21,130
Guys, I'll get out of this corner and it's gonna be so over.

3308
01:43:22,050 --> 01:43:24,290
I swear... Okay.

3309
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:25,430
Hahaha.

3310
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:29,870
Hahaha.

3311
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:32,310
Guys, I was just going easy.

3312
01:43:32,610 --> 01:43:33,430
I was just...

3313
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:35,950
I was just... I was going easy on him.

3314
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:38,350
I wanted people to, you know, oh my god.

3315
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:39,330
Why are you on me?

3316
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:40,050
Alright.

3317
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:40,850
Okay.

3318
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:42,370
Oh, new challenger.

3319
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:43,230
Hey!

3320
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:45,170
You don't have a rank.

3321
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:45,850
Hahaha.

3322
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:47,030
You don't have...

3323
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:47,930
You're new.

3324
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:49,290
I'm new.

3325
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:52,070
We can both be new together.

3326
01:43:53,370 --> 01:43:54,430
We can...

3327
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:56,350
We can both be new.

3328
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:58,430
Funny fact.

3329
01:43:58,630 --> 01:43:59,310
Okay.

3330
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:00,630
Hahaha.

3331
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:02,210
No way.

3332
01:44:02,290 --> 01:44:04,030
People smurfing in video games?

3333
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:05,990
That's against the laws.

3334
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:07,610
No way.

3335
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:11,090
Who would do such a thing?

3336
01:44:11,610 --> 01:44:14,570
Who would... Who would fucking do such a thing?

3337
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:15,770
Wait.

3338
01:44:15,870 --> 01:44:16,810
He's dodging everything.

3339
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:17,890
Wait.

3340
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:20,230
Are you... Are you lying on the internet?

3341
01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:21,490
Hahaha.

3342
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:24,470
Wait.

3343
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:25,390
Wait.

3344
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:27,170
You don't seem new.

3345
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:28,090
Hahaha.

3346
01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:33,470
I see dodging.

3347
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:33,930
Hahaha.

3348
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:35,610
Guys.

3349
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:37,570
Guys, I don't think he's new.

3350
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:38,190
Guys.

3351
01:44:38,290 --> 01:44:38,930
Guys.

3352
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:41,030
Guys, I don't think he's new.

3353
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:43,630
I don't think he's new.

3354
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:45,590
Guys, I can't grab him at all.

3355
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:46,970
He won't...

3356
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:48,830
He won't let me grab.

3357
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:50,730
It's so cruel.

3358
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:53,970
He's not letting me grab.

3359
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:55,230
Hahaha.

3360
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:55,950
Hahaha.

3361
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:58,270
Guys.

3362
01:44:58,270 --> 01:44:58,910
Guys.

3363
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:00,370
I can't do anything.

3364
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:02,910
Hahaha.

3365
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:03,790
Hahaha.

3366
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,550
I can't believe it.

3367
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:09,750
I can't believe he lied.

3368
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:10,810
Hahaha.

3369
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:12,850
I can't believe he lied.

3370
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,190
Wait.

3371
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:14,830
You're new.

3372
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:15,510
Okay.

3373
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:17,350
You're clearly not new, guys.

3374
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:19,130
Guys, get out.

3375
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:19,850
Hahaha.

3376
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:20,950
Hahaha.

3377
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:23,250
Wait.

3378
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:24,050
You're iron.

3379
01:45:24,270 --> 01:45:26,610
Let me fight the iron player.

3380
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:30,430
Let me fight the iron player.

3381
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:34,430
I wanna fight the iron player.

3382
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:35,890
I...

3383
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:36,570
Hahaha.

3384
01:45:38,350 --> 01:45:38,990
Hahaha.

3385
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:40,410
Okay.

3386
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:43,110
Don't worry.

3387
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:43,870
Don't worry.

3388
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:45,010
This guy is platinum.

3389
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:47,690
He can't be that good.

3390
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:49,250
There's no way.

3391
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:50,950
Wait.

3392
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:51,710
You can make faces?

3393
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:52,050
Oh.

3394
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:52,910
You can make faces.

3395
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:55,850
Large black bear.

3396
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:56,730
Thank you, Super Chat.

3397
01:45:56,830 --> 01:45:57,250
Thank you.

3398
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:57,850
Thank you.

3399
01:45:57,970 --> 01:45:59,890
The training montage begins.

3400
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:00,910
Good luck, Doki.

3401
01:46:02,490 --> 01:46:03,090
It's okay.

3402
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:06,910
There's no way she knows that, like, all I know how to do is grab.

3403
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:07,630
There's no way.

3404
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:09,730
There's no fucking way.

3405
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:12,610
Like, my secret is safe.

3406
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:15,230
There's no way.

3407
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:17,390
There's no way she knows that.

3408
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:18,470
There's no way.

3409
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:21,390
The moment I learn how to move, there's no...

3410
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:24,130
The moment I can, like...

3411
01:46:24,130 --> 01:46:25,830
The moment I can touch her!

3412
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:27,050
Hahaha.

3413
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:28,770
Hahaha.

3414
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:30,450
Hahaha.

3415
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:32,510
Hahaha.

3416
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:33,210
Hahaha.

3417
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:34,250
Hahaha.

3418
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:38,010
Please let me...

3419
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:41,730
Fuck you, whore.

3420
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:42,590
Hahaha.

3421
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,090
Oh, I didn't mean it.

3422
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:45,750
I was joking.

3423
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:47,290
I was joking.

3424
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:48,230
I...

3425
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:50,270
I'm sorry!

3426
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:53,490
Please let me fucking do something!

3427
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:54,270
Hahaha.

3428
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:58,500
Hahaha.

3429
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:01,200
How did...

3430
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:01,500
What?

3431
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,540
What is she doing?

3432
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:05,340
Oh.

3433
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:08,280
Wait, did I... No, I can't even grab her!

3434
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:11,060
Please.

3435
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,100
Let me just...

3436
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,280
Please just let me... Please just let me grab you.

3437
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:15,920
Please, that's all I ask!

3438
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:16,820
Hahaha.

3439
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,900
That's all I ask.

3440
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:19,580
Please.

3441
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:20,980
No!

3442
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:24,080
Okay, I got the grab.

3443
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,720
I got the grab, guys.

3444
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,860
I did it.

3445
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,680
I... Guys.

3446
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,920
I got another grab, guys!

3447
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:32,500
I did it.

3448
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,960
I got another grab.

3449
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,700
Oh my god.

3450
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:36,900
I got...

3451
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,880
I got another grab!

3452
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,540
Bro, Jesus, please.

3453
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:44,440
There's no way.

3454
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,440
Hahaha.

3455
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:48,440
I might as well have won.

3456
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,520
Guys, I got a grab.

3457
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,240
It's the moral victory of that.

3458
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,000
Hahaha.

3459
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,660
It's...

3460
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:56,440
I got the grab.

3461
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,220
I... I got the grab.

3462
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:00,300
I...

3463
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:03,300
How do I kick people out?

3464
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,220
Okay.

3465
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:05,980
Guys, can I...

3466
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,940
Guys, can I get any...

3467
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,540
Oh, please.

3468
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:09,860
How do I...

3469
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:10,540
Hahaha.

3470
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:12,660
I won't bother you.

3471
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:13,800
Don't keep trust.

3472
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,140
How do I kick people out?

3473
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:17,040
Hahaha.

3474
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:20,400
Hahaha.

3475
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,340
Oh my god.

3476
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:25,340
Okay.

3477
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,400
It can't be that bad.

3478
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,280
She's clearly new at this character.

3479
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:29,320
Like...

3480
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:31,720
The other guy, they know how to play this character.

3481
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,100
This guy, she's clearly new.

3482
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,580
She's clearly new at this character, right?

3483
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:42,580
Surely.

3484
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:44,840
Surely, right?

3485
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:49,380
This person doesn't know how to play her, right?

3486
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,540
Oh my god, please.

3487
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:51,560
Hahaha.

3488
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:52,740
Please.

3489
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:54,520
There's no way.

3490
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,740
Yeah, that's actually right.

3491
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:58,200
Oh, he doesn't know how to play her.

3492
01:48:58,460 --> 01:48:59,520
Wait, this is it.

3493
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:02,140
She doesn't know how to play her.

3494
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,280
I figured it out.

3495
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,320
Wait.

3496
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,760
He doesn't know how to play her.

3497
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:08,740
Wait, this is it.

3498
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,080
He's actually new.

3499
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,860
He's actually new.

3500
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:14,200
There's hope.

3501
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:15,500
Hahaha.

3502
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,720
There's actual hope.

3503
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:19,700
There's actual hope.

3504
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,120
I can actually win.

3505
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,120
Oh my god.

3506
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:25,880
A new player.

3507
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:28,840
Fresh meat.

3508
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,620
Fresh meat.

3509
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:32,980
Just do a few punches.

3510
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,040
But what punch when I can grab?

3511
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:38,600
Grab.

3512
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,140
Grab.

3513
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:42,840
Come on.

3514
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:43,260
Grab.

3515
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:43,860
Grab.

3516
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:44,680
Hahaha.

3517
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:47,100
What will she possibly...

3518
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:47,540
Grab.

3519
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,140
Grab.

3520
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:52,140
What will she do?

3521
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:53,140
Will she grab?

3522
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,960
Why punch when I can grab?

3523
01:49:59,100 --> 01:49:59,480
Why punch when I can grab?

3524
01:49:59,480 --> 01:49:59,580
Exactly.

3525
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:01,420
Oh no.

3526
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:03,100
Oh no.

3527
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:04,980
Oh no.

3528
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,240
She's doing that thing.

3529
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:08,820
She's doing that thing.

3530
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:11,100
But I can do things too.

3531
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,200
No, I can't.

3532
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:12,860
No, I can't.

3533
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:14,220
Oh, what?

3534
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:16,920
Why?

3535
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:17,940
Hahaha.

3536
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:26,280
Who can tell what Toki, the grappling master, will do next?

3537
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:28,260
That's not fair.

3538
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,680
He's using range.

3539
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:31,800
That's not fair.

3540
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:32,920
That should be illegal.

3541
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:38,520
How do I grab something that has range?

3542
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:42,220
That's fucking right.

3543
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:43,260
Anti-air.

3544
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,720
Jump again, bitch.

3545
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:46,500
Hahaha.

3546
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:49,700
That's like, do it again.

3547
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:51,020
Oh, yeah?

3548
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,700
Did you want to...

3549
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:53,240
Hahaha.

3550
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:57,560
That's fucking right.

3551
01:50:59,000 --> 01:50:59,700
Hahaha.

3552
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:00,480
Whoa.

3553
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:04,240
That's fucking right.

3554
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:05,840
There we go.

3555
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,620
We beat one dragoon today.

3556
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:08,800
That's all that matters.

3557
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,380
Oh my god, an iron player.

3558
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:11,280
Let's go.

3559
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:12,340
Hahaha.

3560
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,220
Let's go.

3561
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:15,480
Hahaha.

3562
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:19,320
Oh my god.

3563
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:19,880
Oh my god.

3564
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:24,320
Their actual bad play is just like me.

3565
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:26,920
I win.

3566
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:27,620
Let's go.

3567
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:30,400
What will I do?

3568
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:32,580
What would I do?

3569
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,200
Oh, shit.

3570
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,860
What would I do?

3571
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:36,800
The grab master.

3572
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:38,040
Come on.

3573
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:38,780
Get over here.

3574
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:39,480
Hahaha.

3575
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:41,280
Hahaha.

3576
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:42,960
Hahaha.

3577
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:46,820
What would I possibly do?

3578
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:48,420
Hahaha.

3579
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:50,840
Oh my god.

3580
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:55,560
It's such a mystery.

3581
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:56,680
Hahaha.

3582
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:58,880
What a mystery.

3583
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,840
What would I possibly do?

3584
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:03,680
Hahaha.

3585
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:06,340
Easy.

3586
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:09,580
What would she do?

3587
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:10,500
Thanks.

3588
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,420
No one can predict this mixup.

3589
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:16,900
Fucking mixup, guys.

3590
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,120
Oh.

3591
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:21,860
Oh, come on.

3592
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,820
Come on.

3593
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:23,260
Jump up.

3594
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:24,720
Hahaha.

3595
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:29,070
Hahaha.

3596
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:31,290
Hahaha.

3597
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:35,610
What would I possibly do next?

3598
01:52:36,190 --> 01:52:37,690
We'll never know.

3599
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:39,830
Oh my god.

3600
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:40,310
What's that?

3601
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:40,970
A punch?

3602
01:52:41,470 --> 01:52:42,150
Hahaha.

3603
01:52:43,470 --> 01:52:44,150
Okay.

3604
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,590
Oh my god.

3605
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:47,570
In another way.

3606
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:47,850
What?

3607
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:51,130
How are you ironed?

3608
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:53,670
How the fuck are you ironed?

3609
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:56,690
Hahaha.

3610
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:59,670
How are you fucking ironed?

3611
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:00,290
Bro.

3612
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:02,070
Bro, I...

3613
01:53:02,070 --> 01:53:02,590
Hahaha.

3614
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:05,690
No way.

3615
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:08,090
No way.

3616
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:09,950
I should be ironed.

3617
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:11,890
I should be fucking ironed.

3618
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:14,310
Why the fuck am I a rookie?

3619
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:16,990
Here comes a new challenger.

3620
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:18,630
Hahaha.

3621
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:20,970
She isn't ironed.

3622
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:22,970
He's new.

3623
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:24,390
Is he actually new?

3624
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:25,250
There's no way.

3625
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:26,690
He actually has to be new.

3626
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:27,550
Whoa.

3627
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:28,410
Hahaha.

3628
01:53:31,470 --> 01:53:32,030
Alright.

3629
01:53:34,510 --> 01:53:36,070
Look, iron is pretty good.

3630
01:53:36,210 --> 01:53:37,010
It's iron is...

3631
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:39,430
Iron is better than...

3632
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:43,430
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but iron is like better than...

3633
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:44,350
Oh shit.

3634
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:46,250
Oh.

3635
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:46,890
Come on.

3636
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:47,930
No, come on.

3637
01:53:48,710 --> 01:53:49,610
Is that fair?

3638
01:53:50,230 --> 01:53:52,130
You're supposed to be new at this game.

3639
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:54,370
What are you doing?

3640
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:55,610
Hahaha.

3641
01:53:58,290 --> 01:53:58,870
Come on.

3642
01:53:58,910 --> 01:53:59,850
Let me grab you.

3643
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:00,530
Come on.

3644
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:02,250
Just let me grab you one time.

3645
01:54:02,530 --> 01:54:02,930
Please.

3646
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:05,430
That's fucking right, bitch.

3647
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:06,670
Why you let me grab you, huh?

3648
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,850
You let me grab you, you're a bad player.

3649
01:54:09,530 --> 01:54:09,930
Hahaha.

3650
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:12,690
Oh shit.

3651
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:13,170
I'm sorry.

3652
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:15,310
I'm the bad player.

3653
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:17,350
I'm the bad player.

3654
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:18,290
Whoops.

3655
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:20,290
Hahaha.

3656
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:23,990
Guys, this guy is not new.

3657
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:26,410
This guy is not new.

3658
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:27,150
He lie.

3659
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:29,870
No.

3660
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:31,870
That's right.

3661
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:32,850
I have auto combos.

3662
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:35,430
Come on.

3663
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,610
Let me use my auto combos.

3664
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:37,790
Yes.

3665
01:54:39,910 --> 01:54:40,750
Down you go.

3666
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:42,130
And I can do it.

3667
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:43,710
I can't do it again.

3668
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:45,550
Oh no.

3669
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:46,410
I can't do it again.

3670
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:46,990
I'm dizzy.

3671
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:48,370
I'm dizzy.

3672
01:54:49,370 --> 01:54:49,810
Whoa.

3673
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:52,570
No.

3674
01:54:53,710 --> 01:54:56,580
Do the thing.

3675
01:55:01,810 --> 01:55:02,250
Guys.

3676
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:04,550
Guys, I don't think he's new.

3677
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:06,510
Guys, I don't think he's new.

3678
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:07,790
Guys.

3679
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:10,030
Guys.

3680
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:11,570
What the fuck am I doing?

3681
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:14,530
What the fuck was that?

3682
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:16,110
Please.

3683
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:18,390
If you let me grab, it'll be so funny.

3684
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:19,010
Please.

3685
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:20,310
That's all right.

3686
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:22,010
You know it'll be so funny.

3687
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:26,550
He doesn't like funny.

3688
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:30,730
He doesn't like funny.

3689
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:32,910
He doesn't like funny.

3690
01:55:32,910 --> 01:55:34,170
He doesn't like funny.

3691
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:35,110
He doesn't like funny.

3692
01:55:35,110 --> 01:55:35,190
Oh.

3693
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:35,970
Wait.

3694
01:55:36,730 --> 01:55:37,490
All right.

3695
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:39,230
Since you're on gif, it's fine.

3696
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:41,650
All right.

3697
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:41,870
Okay.

3698
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:44,430
Who's gonna be the better gif?

3699
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:48,850
Me who just learned how to play two hours ago?

3700
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:50,250
Or this guy?

3701
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:54,670
There's no way.

3702
01:55:56,130 --> 01:55:58,550
Like, how does he know more gif than I?

3703
01:55:58,730 --> 01:56:00,370
I have two hours of gif.

3704
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:02,630
Wait.

3705
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:03,750
Wait.

3706
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:04,390
He threw me.

3707
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:05,450
What?

3708
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:07,410
I wanna throw.

3709
01:56:07,410 --> 01:56:08,070
Wait.

3710
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:09,110
He threw me again.

3711
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:10,090
Wait.

3712
01:56:10,210 --> 01:56:11,770
How does he get that before I do?

3713
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:14,270
Come on.

3714
01:56:15,370 --> 01:56:15,870
What?

3715
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:20,990
Come on.

3716
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:22,310
This is not fair.

3717
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:26,250
Wait.

3718
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:29,590
Use classic controls, you bitch.

3719
01:56:31,630 --> 01:56:34,110
I thought you were supposed to be a FGC player.

3720
01:56:34,330 --> 01:56:35,670
Why are you using modern?

3721
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:41,570
Why are you using modern?

3722
01:56:43,070 --> 01:56:43,510
Dang.

3723
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:48,430
Wait.

3724
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:55,990
How does he do that?

3725
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:58,010
How does he do that?

3726
01:56:58,770 --> 01:56:59,210
You

3727
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:03,160
did it.

3728
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:03,700
That's right.

3729
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:04,820
You already got one grab in.

3730
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:05,900
It's already too late.

3731
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:08,300
It's already embarrassing for you.

3732
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:10,800
It's already embarrassing to you.

3733
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:15,980
You did it.

3734
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:17,600
That's the key word.

3735
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:18,460
Oh my god.

3736
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:18,760
Okay.

3737
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:19,260
I regret.

3738
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:28,060
Not even a double perfect.

3739
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:30,420
Not even a double perfect.

3740
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:31,200
She's kofing.

3741
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:35,180
All I'm saying, it wasn't even a double perfect.

3742
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:40,980
All I'm saying, it wasn't even a double perfect.

3743
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:41,280
Alright.

3744
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:44,900
This person has to be new, right?

3745
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:47,980
He has to be new.

3746
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:48,460
There's no way.

3747
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:51,920
There's no way I'm fighting two smurfs at the same time.

3748
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:56,400
Yeah.

3749
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,940
How could you fumble so hard, man?

3750
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:04,180
How could you fumble that?

3751
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:05,100
Oh no.

3752
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:06,280
He punished me.

3753
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:08,060
Okay.

3754
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:08,540
It's okay.

3755
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:09,020
I got the grab.

3756
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:10,920
That's fucking right.

3757
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:12,980
That's right.

3758
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:13,560
Dodge.

3759
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,560
That's right.

3760
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:16,480
This is what I learned.

3761
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:24,480
I've taken your stride and made it my own.

3762
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:27,400
Easy.

3763
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:29,580
Easy.

3764
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:33,620
I've absorbed the skill.

3765
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:35,220
That's the way.

3766
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:37,680
He was teaching.

3767
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:39,100
I learned.

3768
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:41,580
I fucking learned.

3769
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:43,580
I fucking learned.

3770
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,020
That's fucking right.

3771
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,020
Oh shit.

3772
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:47,040
That's not right.

3773
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:49,100
Oh no.

3774
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:49,820
It's okay.

3775
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:52,320
I figured it out.

3776
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,240
I downloaded it.

3777
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:56,500
I realize all I have to do...

3778
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:56,840
Get closer.

3779
01:58:56,940 --> 01:58:57,280
Come on.

3780
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:57,620
Come on.

3781
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,060
Get closer.

3782
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:02,080
Get over here.

3783
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:02,480
Get over here.

3784
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:04,500
Oh shit.

3785
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:07,060
That's fucking right.

3786
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:08,880
Get over here.

3787
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:09,680
Come on.

3788
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:10,800
Don't do that again.

3789
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:11,120
Oh.

3790
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:12,000
Oh.

3791
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:13,040
Missed.

3792
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:13,760
No.

3793
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:14,400
I missed.

3794
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:15,680
My turn.

3795
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:18,300
Easy.

3796
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:23,460
That's so easy.

3797
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:26,780
Look at that.

3798
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:29,100
I figured it out.

3799
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,000
I'm a natural.

3800
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:34,520
Literally ran her like a buck.

3801
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:34,760
Look.

3802
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:38,540
No.

3803
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:40,480
No.

3804
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:43,480
Oh my god.

3805
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:44,780
What can I say?

3806
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:48,420
I think... I think I'm a gamer guys.

3807
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:50,320
I think I'm...

3808
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:51,960
I think that...

3809
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,540
I think we're gonna have two geese.

3810
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:56,520
I think we're gonna have two geese in the team.

3811
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:00,060
Toki, this is robbery.

3812
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,240
She can't keep getting away with this.

3813
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:03,900
Ruin, thank you for this super chat.

3814
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:04,320
Thank you.

3815
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:04,500
Thank you.

3816
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:04,940
Thank you.

3817
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:06,540
Alright.

3818
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:07,140
I'll see you guys.

3819
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:08,520
Alright.

3820
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,760
I'll do one last.

3821
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,060
We'll call it one last ranked game.

3822
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,440
I'm feeling confident.

3823
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:15,740
I'm feeling confident.

3824
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:16,960
Right here.

3825
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:20,340
I'm feeling so confident.

3826
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:23,300
Not team pro pro three kings again.

3827
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:24,840
Yeah.

3828
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:26,400
But then we're gonna have two geese at least.

3829
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,320
I beat the goons.

3830
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,860
If I can beat the goons, I can beat the world.

3831
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,700
How are you gonna counter me?

3832
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:39,680
How?

3833
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:42,100
I hope we get three geese.

3834
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:43,600
That would be so fucking funny.

3835
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:45,940
I hope.

3836
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:50,000
I do hope we do get three geese.

3837
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:53,220
Okay.

3838
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:55,500
Alright.

3839
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:55,900
Here we go.

3840
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,980
Like I know all the moves that I have to know.

3841
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:00,440
Triangle.

3842
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:01,880
Left triangle.

3843
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:03,980
And then...

3844
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,480
No.

3845
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:05,880
No.

3846
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:06,180
No.

3847
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:06,820
Don't say that.

3848
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,080
There's nobody smart enough to use JP.

3849
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,640
Don't fucking say that.

3850
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,480
Don't...

3851
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:13,680
Guys.

3852
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:14,740
I'm not...

3853
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,220
I'm not Doki Bird.

3854
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:18,280
Do you not see my name?

3855
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,560
It says not Doki Bird.

3856
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:20,700
Sorry.

3857
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:21,820
Welcome to tomato farm.

3858
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:22,180
Welcome.

3859
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:22,700
Welcome.

3860
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:24,580
Guys.

3861
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:25,220
It says...

3862
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:26,920
It says not Doki Bird.

3863
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:28,640
So that means I'm not learning geese.

3864
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:29,820
No.

3865
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:32,160
She's not gonna learn JP.

3866
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:35,080
She says she wants to learn foot lady.

3867
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:39,260
If she backs out on foot lady, she's a fucking coward.

3868
02:01:43,860 --> 02:01:45,980
She's a fucking coward.

3869
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:53,940
Okay.

3870
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:55,080
Whoa.

3871
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:55,360
Whoa.

3872
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:55,680
Whoa.

3873
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:56,000
Whoa.

3874
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:56,280
Whoa.

3875
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:56,500
Whoa.

3876
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:02,840
Come on.

3877
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:05,500
Wait.

3878
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:06,500
How does she know?

3879
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,020
How does he know that that's all I wanted?

3880
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:10,100
JK.

3881
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:12,220
You didn't know bitch.

3882
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:13,880
You didn't.

3883
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:14,880
Oh my god.

3884
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:15,600
He actually knows.

3885
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:17,480
He actually knows.

3886
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:19,240
No you don't.

3887
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:20,660
No you don't.

3888
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:22,520
Oh shit.

3889
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:23,360
Unless.

3890
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:25,440
Unless.

3891
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:27,120
That's fucking right.

3892
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:27,740
You don't know.

3893
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,180
Oh no.

3894
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:30,200
Oh no.

3895
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:30,940
I'm too tired.

3896
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:34,840
Oh I'm so tired.

3897
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,960
But it's okay.

3898
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:36,680
You're down.

3899
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:37,820
Get out.

3900
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:42,840
I punched.

3901
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:45,000
Holy shit.

3902
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,040
She can learn.

3903
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,640
The mix up.

3904
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:49,340
Guys.

3905
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:51,340
The mix up is that I start punching.

3906
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:53,320
Imagine.

3907
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,080
The mix up.

3908
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:57,720
The punch mix up.

3909
02:02:57,900 --> 02:03:00,780
The punch mix up is gonna be fucking wild guys.

3910
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:05,360
Get off of me.

3911
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:05,940
Get off of me.

3912
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,580
That's fucking right.

3913
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:09,860
Get down.

3914
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:11,620
You think you own the skies?

3915
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:13,680
No skies for you.

3916
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:14,840
Oh.

3917
02:03:14,940 --> 02:03:15,180
Oh.

3918
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:15,420
Oh.

3919
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,700
There's no way he defends that.

3920
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:18,500
Yes.

3921
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:21,660
She thinks she's.

3922
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:23,160
Let's go.

3923
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:25,660
Get out.

3924
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,140
You can't fly.

3925
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:29,400
Oh shit.

3926
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:30,800
You don't need to fly apparently.

3927
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:32,620
Oh.

3928
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:33,600
What the fuck.

3929
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:34,740
That's fucking right.

3930
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:35,900
Get down.

3931
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:38,940
Come on.

3932
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:40,040
Oh shit.

3933
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,040
That's fucking right.

3934
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:42,380
Get out.

3935
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:50,600
Yeah.

3936
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:53,720
I think I'm gonna be a geek player.

3937
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:58,380
Little air superiority.

3938
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,880
I was the master jury at the bottom.

3939
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:02,860
Was hoping to fight.

3940
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:03,260
But alright.

3941
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:06,940
Good luck with your street fighter 6 journey.

3942
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,680
Thank you for the super chat cake.

3943
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:10,980
This is why you did not fight me.

3944
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:12,320
The master jury.

3945
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:13,760
This is exactly why.

3946
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:15,280
I'm literally in rookie.

3947
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:16,160
I'm not here.

3948
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:19,180
I'm not here to get fucking beat up.

3949
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:22,600
Okay.

3950
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:23,780
That was fun.

3951
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:26,100
That was fun for the first street fighter.

3952
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:31,340
That was really fun for the first street fighter.

3953
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:34,040
Street fighter 6 stream.

3954
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:36,680
I...

3955
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:37,060
Yeah.

3956
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,020
You need a smurf.

3957
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:39,980
You need a smurf.

3958
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:40,400
Wait.

3959
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:42,980
To make sure we...

3960
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:43,380
Alright.

3961
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:43,820
Let's see.

3962
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:47,180
To make sure that everybody knows that...

3963
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:49,660
Okay.

3964
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:50,320
Let's see.

3965
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:53,800
How do I change my profile?

3966
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,200
Okay.

3967
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:56,340
Triangle.

3968
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:58,540
How do I do that?

3969
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,360
Wait.

3970
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:01,740
How do I change my profile?

3971
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:03,520
I need people to know.

3972
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:05,720
I need people to know what I'm playing.

3973
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:08,040
There's no way they'll find out, right?

3974
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:10,180
There's no way.

3975
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,120
There's no way they'll know.

3976
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:15,100
There's no way they'll know who I'm gonna play.

3977
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:17,000
How do I change my name?

3978
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:20,420
How do I change my name?

3979
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:21,680
Guys, how do I change my name, chat?

3980
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:25,260
Change your selected kick.

3981
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:26,900
Go under.

3982
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:28,260
What the fuck?

3983
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:29,120
Oh, is it this?

3984
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:30,300
CFN?

3985
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:31,840
Oh.

3986
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:32,760
Okay.

3987
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:35,540
Players Rankings.

3988
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:36,240
Is that it?

3989
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:39,040
Oh, it's in main settings?

3990
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:39,700
Okay.

3991
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:42,860
Okay.

3992
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:43,500
Let's see.

3993
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:46,340
Multi-menu.

3994
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:49,580
Options.

3995
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,060
What do I do?

3996
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:51,820
Oh, there you go.

3997
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:55,120
Not do...

3998
02:05:57,860 --> 02:05:58,320
Dogeef.

3999
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:03,730
There you go.

4000
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,390
Don't ever know.

4001
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:08,170
Don't ever know.

4002
02:06:10,450 --> 02:06:11,590
I'm not.

4003
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:12,550
I'm not.

4004
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:12,850
It's not.

4005
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:16,270
Not do...

4006
02:06:16,270 --> 02:06:16,630
Not.

4007
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:17,570
Nobody will know.

4008
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:21,870
Do I do dogeef or dogeef, guys?

4009
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:26,370
Is it dogeef or... Should I do dogeef or dogeef?

4010
02:06:26,810 --> 02:06:28,990
Totally not a geef teaser.

4011
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:30,790
Don't ever know.

4012
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:32,990
How would they know?

4013
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:35,550
Dogeef or dogeef?

4014
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:36,450
Okay, we'll make a poll.

4015
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:39,510
We'll make a poll chat.

4016
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:44,130
Dogeef or dogeef?

4017
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:46,030
Dogeef.

4018
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:47,190
Dogeef.

4019
02:06:48,410 --> 02:06:49,370
There you go.

4020
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:51,770
Alright, you guys get to decide my...

4021
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:54,070
By watching the clip.

4022
02:06:54,250 --> 02:06:54,590
What clip?

4023
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:56,730
Do not delete.

4024
02:06:56,890 --> 02:06:58,290
I won't delete the VOD.

4025
02:06:58,550 --> 02:07:00,070
Archives your VOD.

4026
02:07:08,050 --> 02:07:08,830
Oh my god.

4027
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:09,010
Oh my god.

4028
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:09,510
If I just do...

4029
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:09,970
Oh my god.

4030
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:13,230
If I just do like do Honda and then just play away.

4031
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:14,430
That's so good.

4032
02:07:15,090 --> 02:07:15,570
Okay.

4033
02:07:26,990 --> 02:07:27,970
They'll never know.

4034
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:30,470
They'll think I'm a Honda player.

4035
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:31,550
They'll never know.

4036
02:07:32,590 --> 02:07:33,750
The mixup.

4037
02:07:33,770 --> 02:07:34,310
Exactly.

4038
02:07:34,370 --> 02:07:35,130
The mixup.

4039
02:07:35,150 --> 02:07:35,630
Yes!

4040
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:37,170
Exactly.

4041
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:41,970
They'll never know.

4042
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:43,850
They'll think I'm a Honda player.

4043
02:07:47,150 --> 02:07:48,390
Honda key.

4044
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:49,370
No, do Honda.

4045
02:07:49,970 --> 02:07:51,810
Do Honda or do...

4046
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:53,050
Honda key.

4047
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:54,890
Honda key or do Honda.

4048
02:07:54,890 --> 02:07:55,510
Honda honkey.

4049
02:07:55,970 --> 02:07:58,210
No, no, not honkey.

4050
02:07:59,870 --> 02:08:00,730
Now you're good.

4051
02:08:01,490 --> 02:08:02,070
Yes!

4052
02:08:02,070 --> 02:08:03,690
I mean, it's like reverse psychology.

4053
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:04,890
It says not.

4054
02:08:05,150 --> 02:08:06,070
So then they'll be like...

4055
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:06,850
Oh, she's not.

4056
02:08:07,110 --> 02:08:07,790
You know?

4057
02:08:08,490 --> 02:08:09,610
It'll say like...

4058
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:10,350
Honda.

4059
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:13,610
Honda key.

4060
02:08:14,030 --> 02:08:16,070
We're not doing honkey.

4061
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:18,590
We're not doing honkey.

4062
02:08:21,950 --> 02:08:23,050
Oh my god.

4063
02:08:23,090 --> 02:08:24,130
What if we do honkey?

4064
02:08:24,610 --> 02:08:25,570
Oh my god.

4065
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,590
The actual mixup.

4066
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:28,450
No, actually do Honda.

4067
02:08:28,830 --> 02:08:29,610
We'll do do Honda.

4068
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:31,050
Honda key.

4069
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:35,170
Honda bird.

4070
02:08:36,190 --> 02:08:37,150
Honda bird.

4071
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:37,790
Wait!

4072
02:08:38,730 --> 02:08:39,470
Honda bird.

4073
02:08:39,970 --> 02:08:40,350
No, okay.

4074
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:40,710
Do Honda.

4075
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:41,870
We'll do do Honda.

4076
02:08:43,110 --> 02:08:44,970
God, that's so hard to pick.

4077
02:08:45,230 --> 02:08:45,890
It's so hard.

4078
02:08:46,110 --> 02:08:46,870
It's so hard.

4079
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:49,290
All of them are such good names.

4080
02:08:50,370 --> 02:08:52,110
They're all such good names.

4081
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:52,930
Do Honda.

4082
02:08:54,010 --> 02:08:54,810
Alright,

4083
02:08:58,890 --> 02:08:59,910
Honda bird.

4084
02:09:00,110 --> 02:09:00,830
Honkey bird.

4085
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:01,850
Okay.

4086
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:03,410
Honda key.

4087
02:09:03,590 --> 02:09:04,230
No, do Honda.

4088
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:06,110
Not do Honda.

4089
02:09:08,670 --> 02:09:10,010
Not do...

4090
02:09:10,490 --> 02:09:11,450
No, not...

4091
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:12,910
Not honkey.

4092
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:13,950
Is that honkey bird?

4093
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:15,330
Uh...

4094
02:09:15,330 --> 02:09:16,410
Honda.

4095
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:18,930
No, Honda doesn't sound good.

4096
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:20,490
Yeah, not do Honda.

4097
02:09:20,970 --> 02:09:21,690
There we go.

4098
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:22,990
They're all good.

4099
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:24,010
They're all so good.

4100
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:24,810
Not gonna lie.

4101
02:09:25,230 --> 02:09:26,530
But I had a great time.

4102
02:09:26,750 --> 02:09:27,930
It was a great learning experience.

4103
02:09:28,410 --> 02:09:31,370
Figuring out my main throughout that journey.

4104
02:09:31,630 --> 02:09:33,730
I had a great time figuring out my main.

4105
02:09:33,930 --> 02:09:35,070
We did it, guys.

4106
02:09:35,310 --> 02:09:36,210
We fucking did it.

4107
02:09:39,170 --> 02:09:40,030
But yeah.

4108
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:45,950
Honestly, I hope BroadPro and I get the our coach pick.

4109
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:48,790
Because we know for sure we're gonna be on the same team.

4110
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:50,770
And we're both gonna be key players.

4111
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:52,190
Sorry, we're both gonna be Honda players.

4112
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:55,450
So, when are teams gonna be announced?

4113
02:09:55,650 --> 02:09:57,650
I believe, like, is it this week?

4114
02:09:57,910 --> 02:09:58,570
I don't know.

4115
02:09:58,690 --> 02:09:59,790
I didn't pay much attention.

4116
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:06,550
Okay, Wednesday.

4117
02:10:07,070 --> 02:10:08,210
It's on Wednesday.

4118
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:11,030
It's on...

4119
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:13,070
They're announcing it on Wednesday.

4120
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:14,690
So, um...

4121
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:16,630
You already saw...

4122
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:19,390
Guys, you already saw my speed reading today.

4123
02:10:20,170 --> 02:10:20,690
Um...

4124
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:24,470
But yeah, it's been really fun playing Street Fighter for the very first time.

4125
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:25,550
Um...

4126
02:10:25,550 --> 02:10:26,670
And I'm looking...

4127
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:31,090
I'm honestly looking forward to the real TokiBeard.

4128
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:33,530
Oh my god, there's the real TokiBeard.

4129
02:10:33,810 --> 02:10:34,850
There she is.

4130
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:37,310
Not like that poser.

4131
02:10:37,450 --> 02:10:38,670
Not TokiBeard.

4132
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:42,450
Anyway, Wednesday would be the team announcement.

4133
02:10:42,650 --> 02:10:44,290
So, we'll see who we get.

4134
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:45,610
I'm gonna request Brian.

4135
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:47,850
Bravo and I are both gonna request Brian.

4136
02:10:48,050 --> 02:10:49,510
So, we'll see if we do get Brian.

4137
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:52,430
Like, I mean, Brian could just, you know, reject me.

4138
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:55,070
Cause they're like... He's like, I don't wanna coach fucking...

4139
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:56,070
Like...

4140
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:01,290
Like, Brian sees this VOD and he's like, no, she's...

4141
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:02,050
she's hopeless.

4142
02:11:05,010 --> 02:11:07,070
Like, this would mean I'll get Brian.

4143
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:09,970
Um... But yeah, it was great.

4144
02:11:10,110 --> 02:11:10,910
I had a great time.

4145
02:11:10,930 --> 02:11:11,530
It was really fun.

4146
02:11:11,890 --> 02:11:14,650
Um, as always, everybody stay hydrated.

4147
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:15,670
Posture check.

4148
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:17,670
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4149
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:19,850
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4150
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:21,330
Cause you deserve it.

4151
02:11:21,450 --> 02:11:22,550
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4152
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:23,910
Bye, guys.

4153
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:25,090
Bye-bye.
