1
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,830
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,030
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,930
Oh my god, fucking... my internet's back.

4
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,510
Yay!

5
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:05,330
Oh my god, I have so many things to update you guys about because so many things happened in the last couple of days since my internet was out.

6
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:14,350
First of all, um, as you guys all know, uh, or maybe you don't, or you don't follow me on Twitter, uh, which is understandable, it is Twitter.

7
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,470
Mint and I will be doing a 3D concert!

8
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,530
Yay!

9
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,790
It's gonna be our, uh, revenge concert, because the last time it was pretty scuffed.

10
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,030
So, um, um, OshiSparks, let me, let me put up, I'm sorry, it's, it's been a while.

11
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,390
I know, like, it's been, like, two days, but I already feel so unprofessional.

12
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,990
I already lost my, like, how do you do anything anymore?

13
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,950
Whenever I don't stream for a while, I'm just like, how do I, how do I be a streamer again?

14
00:02:51,070 --> 00:03:01,690
Anyway, so the biggest update, yes, on December 14th in Atlanta, uh, Mint and I will be doing a 3D concert.

15
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,250
Yes, full 3D.

16
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,390
It's not chibi models, guys.

17
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,110
It's full 3D.

18
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,890
Um, and I want to say a huge thank you to, uh, OshiSpark for the, giving us, like, a proposal.

19
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,770
They reached out to us asking us if, you know, if they could, like, um, um, organize the whole thing.

20
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,710
And, uh, because, like, we talked, like, you know, we were tweeting about wanting to do a revenge concert, and they actually reached out to us.

21
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,530
This is a plan has been, like, a lot, like, to be fair, it's not like this has been planned for a long time.

22
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,930
If I'm, like, very truthfully honest with you guys, this was not planned for a long time.

23
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,570
Like, this 3D concert, um, it just, everything just happened to line up.

24
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:54,770
Like, uh, they reached out to us, like, I think, like, um, a month or two ago about it, and then everything just happened to line up.

25
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,850
Um, so yeah, I'm really excited.

26
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:09,550
They are, uh, they are going to, uh, be handling majority of the organization for this, like, vent booking event.

27
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,750
Venue-wise, like, so we don't have to worry about the venue.

28
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,790
Venue, merch, tickets, um, everything.

29
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,390
Unfortunately, um, there won't be any streaming tickets because of music licensing.

30
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:35,030
Um, as y'all know, music rights is, like, really... music rights is really difficult to get and everything in terms of, like, what you think we can do with the songs after, like, for the concerts and everything.

31
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:44,390
But, um, I asked the organizers, um, also, yeah, they're handling the, you know, motion capture and everything.

32
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,310
So, um, huge shout out to Oshie Sparks for handling all of that for us.

33
00:04:49,730 --> 00:05:06,070
Um, um, another thing is that, uh, because we don't have streaming tickets, um, I specifically requested that, uh, I would like to have clips of, like, some of our favorite performances.

34
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:16,250
Like, uh, each of us, like, Mint and I, we both get to pick one performance that, uh, we like the most from this concert and upload it onto our channels.

35
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,650
Um, and from the music licensing rights, we are allowed to do that.

36
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,790
So, yay!

37
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,930
We just can't stream it.

38
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:31,930
But we are allowed to post a clip of any of the performances that we do, just one for each of us on our own channels.

39
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,150
So for those who can't make it, uh, we will have that up on our own channels after the concert.

40
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,570
I don't know when exactly it'll be posted, um, but that's something we can do for you guys.

41
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:56,090
Anyway, um, I highly recommend joining the members, um, because, uh, we will have early bird ticket pre-sells, um, for the members.

42
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,030
So if you are a, uh, it says on the website, so you can see on the Phantom Thief website.

43
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,810
By the way, the name was decided by the organizers.

44
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,450
They're like, can we call it Phantom Thief Revenge?

45
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,550
And then Mint and I were like, yeah, go for it.

46
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,550
We were like, yeah, why not?

47
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,390
So it was actually, uh, the organizers' idea to, like, name it that.

48
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,890
And we're just like, yeah, go for it.

49
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,270
Like, oh, we don't care.

50
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,770
Like, that's a great name.

51
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:40,390
Um, um, but yeah, um, so if you are a member, I did make a community post, um, and you just basically need to sign in.

52
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:50,890
As long as you're a member on either me or Mint, uh, there is a chance for you to get a, um, the pre-sell tickets, uh, for, for the concert.

53
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:58,470
Um, so yeah, for all the members out there, um, make sure to check the community post for all the details and everything.

54
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,750
Um, I'm trying to remember what else was in the contract.

55
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,090
I'm like, what else do I need to say again?

56
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,490
Guys, I'm very good at shilling stuff.

57
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,310
If you guys didn't know, number one shill here.

58
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,180
Um, anyway, um, but yes, uh, thank you for the super chat.

59
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,420
Thank you.

60
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,680
Thank you.

61
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,280
So excited for your first 3D concert.

62
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,840
I know.

63
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:45,900
I'm really excited because like, um, one of the things I've really, I really wanted, I, I, I, oh my gosh, I really, really wanted to do a 3D concert one day, but like, I never thought like, you know, it'd be something with a venue and stuff, like with actual people going there.

64
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:57,400
Um, because you know, no one really knows me as like, um, as like the, the singer of the groups of like, or just the singer in general.

65
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,820
Um, but like it has, actually is one of my dreams and one of my goals to be able to, to be able to do that creation.

66
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,140
Thank you for the super chat.

67
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Thank you.

68
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,980
Thank you.

69
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,120
Thank you for shilling.

70
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
Doki, here's the payment.

71
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,380
Guys, this is one of the organizers by the way.

72
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,040
Did I do good creation?

73
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,900
Did I, did, did I do good?

74
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,920
Anyway, thank you for the super chat.

75
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,500
Thank you.

76
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,720
Thank you.

77
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,860
Um, zero, thank you for the 10 gifted shifts.

78
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,240
Thank you.

79
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,120
Thank you.

80
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Um, yeah, he's one of the organizers, uh, you know, she's um, but yes, like I said, huge shout out to Oshie Spark for handling everything regarding this.

81
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:49,740
Um, because like Min and I, we were planning something for it, but then Oshie Spark approached us and we're like, oh my God, this is better.

82
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,960
Cause then let's work for us.

83
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,000
You're like, oh, that's, thank God.

84
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,020
Let's work.

85
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,820
You guys can handle it.

86
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,900
We'll, we'll show up.

87
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,440
Um, uh, Rocket, thank you for the five gifted shifts.

88
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,780
Thank you.

89
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,520
Thank you.

90
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,640
Um, what else?

91
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,320
Oh my gosh, I lost my train of thought.

92
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,940
What was it?

93
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,460
What did I want to say guys?

94
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,680
I already lost my train of thought.

95
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,730
Um, what, uh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

96
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:29,750
Regarding dancing and singing because the last time I actually took a lot of dance classes, um, last time.

97
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,250
And like, obviously I wasn't able to show the dance classes.

98
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,150
So now I'm like, oh my God, I gotta do that again.

99
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,550
I gotta go back to dance classes again.

100
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,350
So, um, so I'm really excited.

101
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,310
Uh, I'm really excited.

102
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,010
We have like special choreo, um, for like our, the songs that we're doing and everything.

103
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,130
So I hope you guys are super excited.

104
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:11,110
Um, and even though like, um, even though like for those who aren't able to be there for the concert, um, I am planning on an actual full 3D debut in the future.

105
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:19,890
Um, and, uh, I'm really, oh my gosh, it's like, I have a lot of stuff in my head, um, because I've been planning this.

106
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:29,730
I feel like I've been planning a 3D debut for like a year now, like a year and a half now, but it's very ambitious.

107
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,510
So like now I'm like, all right, back on to back to the beginning.

108
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,930
So, so, um, we're doing it again.

109
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,750
So I hope you guys look forward to like the official 3D debut.

110
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,230
Um, when it does happen, it's not like after the concert, I'll just be like surprised.

111
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,310
I'm just going to use my 3D model now.

112
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,830
Um, I'm still planning something incredibly special for it.

113
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:01,150
Um, and it's going to be on stream, um, when the official 3D debut, like on stream and everything.

114
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,050
Um, and, but it's just, it just takes a while, you know, everything just lined up, um, with the concert.

115
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:14,670
And I feel like it was such a amazing opportunity and I don't rush my, I don't want to rush my official 3D debut.

116
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,350
So like the 3D concert was such an amazing opportunity to have.

117
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,270
Um, and it's with Mint as well.

118
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,090
Like I wouldn't want to do this with anybody else regarding this concert because she can carry my ass.

119
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,710
Like she has the most experience when it comes to like idol and concerts and stuff.

120
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,650
So like, if not, if anything, she can carry my fucking ass throughout it.

121
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,990
So I thought it was like, you know, the perfect occasion.

122
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:52,990
Um, it's really like, even though this would technically be the debut for our 3Ds, um, sorry, I'm still coughing.

123
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,250
It's really hard to say no to this opportunity.

124
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:08,210
And, um, and we will try our best, uh, we'll try our best to make sure that those who can make it will still be able to, uh, will still be able to see like photos and like clips of it.

125
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,950
And like I said, Mint and I will be uploading individual uploads on each of our channel.

126
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,110
Um, and each of our channels.

127
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,690
So those who did miss it will be able to see like one of the performances and stuff.

128
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,170
Uh, but yes, tickets go on sale on Thursday.

129
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,450
Uh, check out phantomthief.com.

130
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:35,890
Um, all I'm saying is that for the VIP packages, Mint and I will be together signing the autographs for the VIP packages.

131
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,050
So I don't know.

132
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,190
I mean, it's pretty hype.

133
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,090
Cucumber, thank you for the super chat.

134
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,410
Thank you.

135
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:42,970
Thank you.

136
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,830
Mental carry.

137
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,370
I'm not gonna read the last one.

138
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,370
Karisha, did I do good?

139
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,670
Did I shill it okay?

140
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,350
Did I do okay, Karisha?

141
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,810
Anyway, um, another update.

142
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,770
Uh, another update.

143
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,330
Um, um, dad's not here.

144
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,030
Uh, because like I said, my internet was out.

145
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,530
Um, and also like there was a flood.

146
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:27,690
So the reason why the internet was out was because, uh, there was a flood that sort of like destroyed the internet.

147
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:38,450
So, so our entire, we never, we, our entire building had no internet and the roads were sort of like low-key flooded and everything was wet.

148
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:45,890
So then I was like, I called up a dog sitter and was like, can you, can you look after, can you look after dad for me?

149
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,030
And then she was like, yeah, it's a new dog sitter because the other one was like not available.

150
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:56,150
And I was like texting, I was like messaging people like emergency, I need a dog sitter right now.

151
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:06,380
Um, anyway, um, this is the photo they sent me of, this, this was the photo they sent me.

152
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,310
You're next.

153
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,000

245
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:23,750

248
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,150
I Stayed there guys.

249
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,110
No, I do not have a problem.

250
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,050
First off.

251
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,190
I do not have a problem Second off.

252
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,450
I swear if I go one more day off the internet.

253
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,750
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

254
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,770
But third off I don't have a

255
00:26:52,710 --> 00:27:19,110
Don't have a problem Look, I even stayed in the lobby I even stayed in the in the apartment lobby because the apartment lobby had Wi-Fi So like I didn't had like free Wi-Fi A lot of people were just downstairs in the apartment lobby using the internet so if I so I can't have a problem if the rest of the people that live in my apartment building also did that so

256
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:48,510
So if they did that then like then you're trying to say they have a problem too, but we don't anyway But yes, I did go to the internet cafe to catch up on a lot of work Anyway We are gonna be playing backyard baseball 97 I'm super excited to Play this game.

257
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:58,770
I can't believe they finally actually reported this on the steam slash PC Because look I might have played like one game of deadlock, but that was okay.

258
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:14,970
That was it Okay, it might have been two games of deadlock and I realized I wasted my time because that was like two hours of deadlock Because I bought like three hours of credit and I realized I only had one hour left to work But so then I bought two more hours of credit.

259
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,970
So that's why I stay there until 4 in the morning But I did get work done

260
00:28:23,530 --> 00:29:06,910
Anyway, anyway As I was saying, so I'm very excited to play backyard baseball 97 because like this was actually a game I played a lot when I was a little bird I didn't know what I was doing because I refused to read at that time, which I got better at Better at refusing to read by the way But like I just thought it was like I just thought I could tell it was fun I just didn't know what I was doing because I didn't understand any of the mechanics because it's all about It was all it's all about like it's like basically question like that equation game where like you're Managing players and stuff like that and then trying to take them to the major league baseball team for kids So yeah,

261
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:35,170
anyway, um The only reason I know about Shohei Otani is because apparently his like 50th home run sold for like How many thousands of 500,000 I don't even know his but I just knew about it cuz like I just saw on Twitter how his baseball sold for a lot Of money and I was like and then that he did and that he I think like the reason The Dodgers had the hololive collab together.

262
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:40,130
It was because like it was also for his birthday I believe was that it?

263
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,550
I don't know.

264
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,330
I could be spreading misinformation but we all know I

265
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,370
I could be spreading misinformation, but

266
00:29:54,810 --> 00:30:16,770
It was okay I was not and I knew about him because of the fact that it's it was like his birthday and then they did the hololive collab and And I thought that was really cool that they did it for his birthday because that means he's like he likes VTubers and I thought that was funny and cool at the same time Cuz then it's like oh my god,

267
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,570
even see see normies like VTubers too.

268
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:29,210
Like we're hitting mainstream, baby Well, obviously we like VTubers in Japan are mainstream, but we're hitting mainstream in NA

269
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:43,760
But that but yeah like his 50th home run sold for like two million dollars and like I I was like damn That's a lot of fucking money.

270
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,800
And then that's how I know about Shohei Hotani.

271
00:30:47,100 --> 00:31:02,200
Anyway, we're gonna make the next one guys in 97 obviously We're gonna make the next one in 97, let's fucking go Let's see, I don't know Oh sound guy is here.

My god, this is a oh my god, this is so nostalgia.

291
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,860

298
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,760
There you go How long can I make the name?

299
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:32,240
Jokey Wait real wait, no in honor of real jokey bird By the way, the reason why real jokey bird was like bottom frag in game two and three was because after the first game they felt really bad that they were Fucking demolish.

300
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:44,060
Oh my god shit that they were Demolishing the other team because they were supposed to be a sub that they Unbinded paper form and also turned on mouse acceleration.

301
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,580
So

302
00:33:51,520 --> 00:34:07,500
If you were a real jokey bird if you're a real jokey bird you would you would make sure like even though you know We were gonna get DQ'd anyway, because like hat like basically we legitimately had like two players that were from the original team Everybody else were substitutes.

303
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,940
So

304
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:47,140
So like so like they were so like they got they so they were like We had to get disqualified because like the whole team wasn't there which is Understandable because half the like all the substitutes the substitutes of this Tronova tournament were like Actual players that's been playing the fucking game since like it since it since it first came out in CN servers so like obviously they're fucking good And we had three of them So then so then the bot so then he was like,

305
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:55,860
okay I'm gonna unbind a paper form and turn on mouse acceleration So they were like so they could make it more fair.

306
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,580
I was like how fucking dare we were gonna get DQ'd anyway, like Might as well just break their spirit

307
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:20,000
If you were if you were a real jokey bird you would do you wouldn't care just break their spirit All right, there you go create team real dokey.

308
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,660

00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,600
Thank you for always entertaining me and with your streams.

443
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,420
Thank you for the super chat.

444
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:40,720
Thank you.

445
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,280
Thank you.

446
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,800
Happy birthday to you.

447
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,300
Happy birthday to you.

448
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,960
Happy birthday dear OneBody.

449
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,460
Happy birthday to you.

450
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:47,940
Yeah!

451
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,140
All right, OneBody, since it's your birthday, do we get Angela?

452
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,720
Does Angela deserve to be on our team?

453
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,140
To be in our... the next Dodger...

454
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,700
Dodgers, watch out.

455
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,620
We're gonna head over to the Major League Baseball.

456
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,080
What do you say, OneBody?

457
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,600
Do we pick her up?

458
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,420
What do you say?

459
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,000
It's your choice.

460
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,580
Do you think she deserves to be a Dodger?

461
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,360
Sorry, the Rockets?

462
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,180
We don't want Dodgers to sue us either, so...

463
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,980
All right, OneBody, take it a little bit.

464
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,040
I'm gonna... I'll get back to Ashley later.

465
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,600
I'll get back to Ashley later.

466
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,300
I'll keep a spot open for her if you say yes.

467
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,240
We still have two more.

468
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,860
Oh, absolutely, get in here.

469
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,580
If Angela fucks up, I'm timing you out.

470
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,720
I'm taking...

471
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:01,820
If Angela... If Angela fucking fucks up, OneBody, you're timed out for the stream.

472
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,540
All right, two more, two more.

473
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:08,780
Who else?

474
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,620
Who should we put as our two... Oh, wait, she has a...

475
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,140
She has baseball clothes on.

476
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,760
Put her in the outfield and she'll daydream all day, guaranteed.

477
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,920
Loves playing shortstop and that's where she should go.

478
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,980
Oh, no.

479
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,560
We don't want that.

480
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,380
We don't... We don't want that, guys.

481
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,520
We don't want that.

482
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,580
She's a daydreamer.

483
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,100
She has to be locked in.

484
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,020
Position should not matter.

485
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,560
If she was a real baseball fan, position shouldn't matter.

486
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,700
She should just be happy that she could play the game.

487
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,560
You're too limited right now.

488
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,200
You gotta be happy that you're on the field.

489
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,300
Frog... Bro, he doesn't run.

490
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,500
Frogboy doesn't run.

491
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,160
I can't take Frogboy.

492
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,700
She's a one-trick.

493
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,440
We cannot have one...

494
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,240
It is... Alright.

495
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,640
It is...

496
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,480
Showing Otani a one-trick.

497
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,080
Exactly.

498
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,280
We're making the...

499
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,300
I agree with Frogkid.

500
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,340
Okay, fine.

501
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,560
We'll have Frogkid.

502
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,360
Okay.

503
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,640
Alright, fine.

504
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,720
We'll bring him over.

505
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,700
Alright, he's just gonna warm the bench, guys.

506
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,140
Alright, last guy.

507
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:32,960
What do we get?

508
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,940
I mean, we have Pablo.

509
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,120
He can literally fucking single-handedly carry this entire team.

510
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,860
That's not true!

511
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,880
They can all run!

512
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,200
They can all run!

513
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,060
What do you mean?

514
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,760
The nerd?

515
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,900
What the fu... Why are you here?

516
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,480
We're here to make champions!

517
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,320
You clearly don't even wanna be here!

518
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,540
Oh my god.

519
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,580
Alright.

520
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,160
Endless Popcorn Kid.

521
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,840
Oh my god, he can run!

522
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,420
Wait,

523
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,980
he's our all-rounder!

524
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,820
We don't have any of those!

525
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,980
Alright, you're in, Dante.

526
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,380
Wait, what?

527
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:27,920
No, wait.

528
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,560
I did say no.

529
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,140
Get in here.

530
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,900
Dante, you're in!

531
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,860
Alright, we're ready.

532
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,340
The Dodgers are ready.

533
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,440
There you go.

534
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,540
Real Doki's Humongous Rocket.

535
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:44,860
Oh.

536
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,960
Wait.

537
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,340
I might have... We should not...

538
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:50,980
Oh.

539
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,380
I realize that name is a little...

540
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,280
I...

541
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,120
Okay.

542
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,960
I realize I might have...

543
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,400
I might have fucked up with the name a little.

544
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:16,900
But...

545
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:18,980
Okay.

546
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,700
Alright, let's figure this out.

547
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,920
Who is our pitcher again?

548
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,380
Okay, we're gonna put a batting order.

549
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:27,860
Pablo.

550
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:28,960
Where are you, Pablo?

551
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,200
Pablo.

552
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:29,940
Which one's Pablo?

553
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:30,900
Pablo.

554
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:31,700
Okay.

555
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,100
Who's the best pitcher, guys?

556
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,660
You guys were saying...

557
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,440
Angela.

558
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,340
Alright, Angela.

559
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,440
Angela, you're in.

560
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,620
What the fuck?

561
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,160
Angela.

562
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,240
Get over here.

563
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,220
You're gonna be pitching.

564
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,440
And then...

565
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,020
Pablo will be first.

566
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,900
Marky, I know Marky, you're really good at...

567
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,320
hitting those balls as well.

568
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,560
So if we hit it all the way here, that would be a home run.

569
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,380
And...

570
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,920
Best batter is fourth?

571
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,080
Okay, you're right.

572
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,100
Alright, there we go.

573
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,020
This should be it.

574
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,800
Frogboy is the catcher.

575
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:08,700
And then...

576
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,120
I don't remember who's fast, guys.

577
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,540
Who's fast again?

578
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:11,880
Okay.

579
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,160
These are all our players.

580
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,940
Oh my god, they're all fast.

581
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,680
Okay, as long as our slowest...

582
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,900
Okay, Jacinda.

583
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,760
Are you...

584
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,560
Who is it that hates Zeus Daydreams again?

585
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,140
Did I get the Daydreamer?

586
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:26,980
I didn't, right?

587
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,740
Okay, good.

588
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,860
We didn't have a Daydreamer.

589
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,600
Because I made sure.

590
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,160
Alright, let's see.

591
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,700
Dante and Pablo are the fastest.

592
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,680
Oh, Dante and Pablo are the fastest.

593
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,740
Oh my god, MarkyD, you get over here.

594
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,020
You get over here.

595
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,520
I don't trust you, MarkyD.

596
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,220
You don't run.

597
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,320
You don't...

598
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,800
You don't run.

599
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,280
Wait, hover over Pablo?

600
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,620
Where's Pablo?

601
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:51,760
Where's Pablo?

602
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,770
Oh my god, Pablo.

603
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,970
Oh my god.

604
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,650
No thoughts, just Pablo.

605
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,590
He's getting ready.

606
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,610
He's locked in right now.

607
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:25,590
Oh my god.

608
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,290
He is my final boss.

609
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,570
I literally picked the best player.

610
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,250
Those other teams, they don't know what's coming.

611
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,010
Okay.

612
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,710
Alright, this should be good.

613
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,870
Center field, left field.

614
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:38,970
Alright.

615
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,450
Alright, Rockets, I believe in you.

616
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:42,890
Third base, first base.

617
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,530
This should be it.

618
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,250
He's got his own theme song.

619
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,070
I think we're ready.

620
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,970
Alright, we're playing against the wombats first.

621
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,570
This should be fine.

622
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:03,590
BBL?

623
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,300
Oh no.

624
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,880
The super duper wombats.

625
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,800
It's gonna be over for them.

626
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,120
What?

627
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,380
It's Backyard Baseball League, guys.

628
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,780
What else is this supposed to mean, guys?

629
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,600
It's Backyard Baseball League.

630
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,200
I love BBL.

631
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,120
Alright.

632
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,680
Come on, Humongous Rockets!

633
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,040
Do it for real, Doki!

634
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,060
Play ball!

635
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,600
Where the fuck is she?

636
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,460
Where the fuck is Laura?

637
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,160
Alright.

638
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,160
Alright, Pete!

639
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,220
Pete, all you do is love writing, Pete!

640
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,560
You got this!

641
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,940
Oh, I have to bat?

642
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,680
Oh shit, that's why I keep losing.

643
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:09,880
Um...

644
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,780
Alright.

645
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,960
We're gonna get...

646
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,400
We're gonna get this.

647
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,140
And then, I don't remember how...

648
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,400
Okay.

649
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,580
Okay!

650
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,540
It's fine!

651
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,900
Lock in, lock in, Pete!

652
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,580
Guys, I'm adjusting.

653
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,880
I didn't realize.

654
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,540
I forgot.

655
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,720
Oh, come on, Pete!

656
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,600
Pete, what are you doing?

657
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,200
I forgot.

658
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,740
This is why I was really bad at this game.

659
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,220
No!

660
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,140
Oh, Pete!

661
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,740
What are you doing?

662
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,660
What?

663
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,020
What are you doing, Pete?

664
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,580
It's okay, Kenny's gonna...

665
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,060
Kenny's gonna redeem us.

666
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,720
It's okay.

667
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,060
What am I doing?

668
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,340
What is Pete doing?

669
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,400
It's not my fault!

670
00:55:59,400 --> 00:55:59,480
What is it?

671
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,620
Oh!

672
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,600
What are these bitches?

673
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:06,680
What?

674
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,080
Okay.

675
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,600
There's no way.

676
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,500
There's no way.

677
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,020
There's no way, Kenny!

678
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,100
Guys!

679
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,880
Guys, I'm figuring this out.

680
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,540
Oh, God.

681
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:22,840
Okay.

682
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,640
Okay, there's no way.

683
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,660
Come on, Kenny, I believe in you.

684
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:27,880
That's a ball.

685
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,780
That has to be a ball.

686
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,900
Okay, I can read it.

687
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,420
Okay, this is it.

688
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,800
I'm walking in.

689
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,270
That was a hit!

690
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:43,410
That was a hit!

691
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,850
Kenny, how could you do this to me, Kenny?

692
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,070
That should have been a hit!

693
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,350
It's okay, Dante.

694
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,750
Come on, Dante.

695
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,250
You can't let me down.

696
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,310
I brought you the hot dog.

697
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,630
You can't...

698
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,330
It was the ping, guys!

699
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:00,810
It was the ping!

700
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:03,990
Yes!

701
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:05,850
Go, Dante, go!

702
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,190
Run!

703
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,990
Your heart loves it!

704
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,870
You love running, Dante!

705
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,410
Okay, I believe in Kenny.

706
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,470
Don't kill me.

707
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:16,930
Oh, Pablo.

708
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:19,110
Pablo!

709
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,830
My man!

710
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,730
Let's go, Pablo!

711
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,710
You can't disappoint me.

712
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,390
You're in tight.

713
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,030
That's right.

714
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,950
I'm putting it power level.

715
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:32,750
Oh, fuck.

716
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,450
Oh, fuck.

717
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:34,810
No!

718
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:37,010
Run!

719
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,230
Oh, thank God.

720
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:38,870
They're stupid.

721
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:39,510
They're children.

722
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,290
Oh, thank God.

723
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,350
Children are stupid.

724
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:43,170
Oh, thank God.

725
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:43,510
Okay.

726
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,410
Oh, no.

727
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:45,550
I put Ashley on fifth.

728
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,130
I put Ashley on fifth.

729
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,850
Okay, this is gonna...

730
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:52,530
Okay, line drive.

731
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,470
This is the only way we can do this.

732
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,690
Pablo, you got this.

733
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,550
Oh, come on!

734
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:59,430
Come on!

735
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,010
No!

736
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:01,270
Yes!

737
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:02,770
Run!

738
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,170
No, Ashley!

739
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,430
Why can't you run?

740
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,030
Ashley, you...

741
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,590
I should've got your sister!

742
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,210
I should've got your fucking sister!

743
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:14,110
Oh, you're terrible!

744
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:19,810
Ashley.

745
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:21,350
Okay.

746
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:22,290
Alright.

747
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,670
Okay, we're not gonna put Ashley as fifth batter.

748
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,150
It's not... Oh my... No, I should've got the other sister.

749
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:34,890
I...

750
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,130
Things I've said to an ex.

751
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,070
Okay.

752
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:41,630
The left hook.

753
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:42,570
There's no way.

754
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,590
The left hook.

755
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,990
So it'll be like... Alright, here we go.

756
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,830
Alright, let's go.

757
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:53,930
What?!

758
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:54,630
Get it, Angela!

759
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:55,610
Get it!

760
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:56,470
Get it!

761
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:56,910
Get it!

762
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:57,510
Yes!

763
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:58,770
I knew it!

764
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:00,150
I knew I could count on you, Angela!

765
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,070
Oh, you're so good!

766
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,550
You should get a scholarship, Angela!

767
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,210
You should get a scholarship!

768
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:07,710
You're gonna redeem us right here!

769
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,670
You're gonna redeem the Rockets!

770
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:15,310
I can't believe he bunted.

771
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:17,890
Like, what kind of loser does that?

772
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:20,570
What?!

773
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:20,930
Foul!

774
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:21,510
Thank God.

775
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:21,890
Good.

776
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,230
Okay.

777
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:22,730
Strike.

778
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:23,430
Alright.

779
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,010
Okay, right hook.

780
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,710
Right hook right here.

781
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:28,450
There's no way.

782
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,650
Another strike, Angela!

783
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:31,070
Oh!

784
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,210
The Dodgers are watching right now, Angela.

785
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,330
You got this!

786
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:35,970
Alright.

787
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:37,710
Heat time.

788
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,210
Right here.

789
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:41,890
What?!

790
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:45,210
What?!

791
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,350
Kenny, please.

792
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:49,450
Kenny, no!

793
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:04,590
Alright.

794
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:05,750
We did it.

795
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:06,710
No, no.

796
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,570
Kenny is fine.

797
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,550
Kenny deserves it.

798
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,010
Oh my God.

799
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,490
We're baseballing right now.

800
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:13,770
There's no way.

801
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,930
Strike one.

802
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:15,570
Get out.

803
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,610
Get out of here.

804
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:21,670
Get out of here.

805
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:21,730
Get out of here.

806
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,090
You're so stupid.

807
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:23,970
You're children.

808
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:28,890
Alright.

809
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:29,630
Right steal.

810
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:32,230
What?!

811
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:32,910
How?!

812
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:33,590
Oh my God.

813
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,430
No, Kenny!

814
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,170
Kenny, please!

815
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:39,590
Kenny, no!

816
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,310
Kenny!

817
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:42,610
No!

818
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:43,290
Kenny!

819
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,450
Oh my God.

820
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,650
Kenny, please.

821
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:48,530
Come on.

822
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:48,810
Run.

823
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:49,670
Run.

824
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,710
Run.

825
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:51,670
Come on.

826
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:52,770
Run.

827
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,670
You wanna run.

828
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:55,290
Come on.

829
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:56,530
Run.

830
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:57,470
Come on.

831
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:57,990
Run.

832
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:02,790
Yeah!

833
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,710
You're so stupid!

834
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,650
That's what you write!

835
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:12,910
Get baited!

836
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,950
Get baited!

837
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:15,850
Children!

838
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,250
Children!

839
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,190
No way.

840
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,170
I knew it.

841
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:28,690
I knew they would run.

842
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:30,310
Kids can't...

843
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,170
Kids can't fucking...

844
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,350
They're never patient.

845
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,770
I know children aren't patient.

846
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:35,630
Don't catch it.

847
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:36,210
No!

848
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,610
They're never patient.

849
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:45,430
They can't wait.

850
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:46,770
They're just gonna be like...

851
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,090
If they don't...

852
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:50,250
If they...

853
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,390
They're just like...

854
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:52,890
What are they gonna do?

855
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:53,910
It has to be ball.

856
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,130
It's outside the square.

857
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:57,910
Alright, here we go.

858
01:01:59,010 --> 01:01:59,810
We got this.

859
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,150
What if I...

860
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:05,750
That's another ball.

861
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,790
She's gonna let me walk.

862
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:07,630
That's right.

863
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,530
You don't have Angela on your team.

864
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:10,410
I do.

865
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,590
That has to be no ball.

866
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:16,470
What?

867
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:17,510
How?

868
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:18,310
How?

869
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:20,850
That's so high.

870
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,350
That's higher than my height.

871
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,710
That should be a ball.

872
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:26,250
Okay.

873
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:27,330
There's no way.

874
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:28,170
You run.

875
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:29,270
She doesn't run.

876
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,110
I forgot you don't run.

877
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:36,710
I forgot she doesn't run.

878
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,990
Oh my god.

879
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,250
He doesn't run.

880
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:46,510
I forgot to put all my runners at the beginning.

881
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:51,010
I put all my runners in the beginning.

882
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:54,630
It's okay.

883
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,270
You got this.

884
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,730
That's a hit.

885
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,250
That was a hit.

886
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,170
What do you mean that wasn't?

887
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:07,290
I'm in.

888
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:08,930
I'm in.

889
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,730
That's right.

890
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,250
You blew it for the rest of the team.

891
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,910
I hope you feel the guilt later.

892
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:22,110
Oh my god.

893
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:25,010
There's still four more rounds.

894
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:26,610
Oh my god.

895
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,950
You got headphones on.

896
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,510
You're not taking this seriously.

897
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:35,030
Okay.

898
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,150
That's okay.

899
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:36,810
Right hook.

900
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,390
That's alright.

901
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:38,930
Angeles.

902
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,250
Are you serious?

903
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:41,810
How?

904
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,610
How?

905
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,790
What if you guys get it?

906
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,550
That's fine.

907
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:48,870
You're gonna move.

908
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:50,690
You wanna move, don't you?

909
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,470
That's my guy.

910
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:55,050
You wanna run, don't you?

911
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,310
You know you wanna run.

912
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:58,910
Come on.

913
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:00,390
I knew it.

914
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,430
I knew it.

915
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:03,910
I knew it.

916
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:04,670
Put it back.

917
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,190
That's right.

918
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,870
Yeah, get out.

919
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:08,930
Get out.

920
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,950
Get out.

921
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,470
Get out of here.

922
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:24,430
That cannot be it.

923
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,110
There's no way that's a foul.

924
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:32,050
Why does the commenters sound like Travis, thank you for the super chat.

925
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,510
Thank you.

926
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:34,790
It just works.

927
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,650
It just works.

928
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:37,910
Okay, I'll stop cheesing here.

929
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:38,950
I'm just mad.

930
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,930
I'm just mad right now.

931
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:45,670
I'll stop bullying the kids.

932
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:46,710
Are you serious?

933
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:47,270
How?

934
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,270
How?

935
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:49,570
Ashley, please.

936
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:50,910
No, Ashley.

937
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:51,770
No!

938
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,850
Why is she on my team?

939
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:57,650
Why?

940
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,350
How do they do it?

941
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:05,230
How?

942
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:06,950
It's all...

943
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,930
This is the only way they'll get a point.

944
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,330
This is...

945
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,350
Goddamn children.

946
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,230
There's no way this AI is 97.

947
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,630
How could they know what I'm trying to do?

948
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:23,690
I'll do a slow ball.

949
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,890
They won't know.

950
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:27,750
That's... I knew it.

951
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,790
They won't know.

952
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,810
And I'll do a fast ball.

953
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,090
Okay.

954
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:35,690
Alright.

955
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:40,750
Come on.

956
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:41,610
Come on, Angela.

957
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:43,510
You can't disappoint...

958
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,370
He didn't even register what happened.

959
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,510
He didn't... Oh, we do a right hook.

960
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:49,850
And then after that...

961
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:51,610
We do a right hook.

962
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,530
He didn't even register in his brain what happened.

963
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:55,690
Get out.

964
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,510
Get out of my game.

965
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:58,250
Right now.

966
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,470
And we'll do another slow ball.

967
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:01,830
We'll do another slow ball.

968
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,030
He's gonna swing.

969
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:04,350
Yes!

970
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:07,330
Get your ass outta here.

971
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:09,970
Get your ass... I have learned how to play.

972
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,650
Still another one?

973
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:13,410
Did I not get...

974
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,850
Oh my god, it's cause he got a home run.

975
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:15,730
I forgot.

976
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,570
It's cause she got a fucking home run.

977
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:19,510
I was like, fireball.

978
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:20,170
This is it.

979
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,410
Okay, no.

980
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:22,690
We'll do right hook first.

981
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,750
Right hook and then we'll do fireball.

982
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:27,770
We'll do fireball as the last resort.

983
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:29,570
Alright, slow ball.

984
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:31,170
He won't expect another...

985
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:33,450
He won't expect another slow ball.

986
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,290
There's no way.

987
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:36,450
Come on.

988
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,150
Are you serious?

989
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:39,650
Pablo, please.

990
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:40,410
Pablo.

991
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,470
Pablo, please.

992
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,170
Get over here.

993
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,960
That's right, get back in here.

994
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:55,950
You thought you could get a second base?

995
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,190
Use your head.

996
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,390
Use your fucking head.

997
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:00,710
You stupid child.

998
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:06,610
Got so greedy and now you disappointed your team.

999
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,230
That's what you get.

1000
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:09,810
Get outta here.

1001
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,770
Okay, um...

1002
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,570
Marky, I need you to get a home run.

1003
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:15,530
Marky, I...

1004
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,090
I mean...

1005
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:19,390
I need you to...

1006
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,330
What do you mean no cheese?

1007
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,770
He ran to second base himself.

1008
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:25,490
I didn't even cheese it.

1009
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,390
Okay, that...

1010
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:28,130
That was my bad.

1011
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:32,850
Yes!

1012
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:37,510
Go!

1013
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:38,050
Go!

1014
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:38,930
You're so...

1015
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,750
Go, please!

1016
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:40,930
Mark, no!

1017
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,230
You're so slow!

1018
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:46,470
Fraud!

1019
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,170
Why are you so slow?

1020
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,010
Why?

1021
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,070
Why are you so slow?

1022
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,630
I don't understand.

1023
01:07:57,390 --> 01:07:59,110
Oh my god.

1024
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,470
Oh my god.

1025
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:01,930
Why?

1026
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:02,710
That's okay.

1027
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:05,290
We need a home run.

1028
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:06,590
We just need one point.

1029
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,030
Oh, wait, no!

1030
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:10,970
No, no, come on, get over there!

1031
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:11,350
Yes!

1032
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:12,930
You're so fast!

1033
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:13,730
I knew it!

1034
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:14,690
You're so fast.

1035
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:15,750
Oh my god.

1036
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:21,450
Oh my god, Kenny, you got this, Kenny.

1037
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,570
Alright, Kenny.

1038
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,430
First game of the season.

1039
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:29,030
First game of... Oh, shit.

1040
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:30,870
We were just testing it out.

1041
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:33,750
First game... This is the first game of the season, guys.

1042
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:34,730
We need the win.

1043
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,230
We need a win, guys.

1044
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:41,750
The moment we get our first win, it's over for the entire season.

1045
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:44,490
We know we can get this.

1046
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:46,090
The wombats...

1047
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:49,470
The wombats are the best team of the league right now.

1048
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:54,310
The moment we get this first win, the rest of the team will be so easy.

1049
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:57,730
Okay, there we go.

1050
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:58,670
Go, go!

1051
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,110
Go, you're so fast!

1052
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,390
Kenny, I swear to god, use your wheels!

1053
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:03,670
Use your wheels!

1054
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:04,470
Yes, Kenny!

1055
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,610
Oh my god, bases are going to be loaded soon.

1056
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:08,510
Who is it?

1057
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,650
Alright, Dante.

1058
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:11,350
Come on, Dante.

1059
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:15,030
I need you to do this for the rest of the boys.

1060
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:16,130
Dante.

1061
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:17,910
This is... Oh, shit.

1062
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:20,670
Okay, I wanted to swap to open.

1063
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,610
Alright.

1064
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:22,970
Come on, Dante.

1065
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,670
We need that home run.

1066
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,870
Dante, that's okay.

1067
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:31,910
We can make one mistake, Dante.

1068
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,690
You got the burger in you.

1069
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:34,930
Come on.

1070
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:37,370
No!

1071
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:39,910
Okay, it's okay, Dante.

1072
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,390
If you get out, we have Pablo.

1073
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:43,390
If you get out, we have Pablo.

1074
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:45,550
We don't matter, Dante.

1075
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:47,170
We just need Pablo.

1076
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,290
Okay, wait.

1077
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:50,590
Okay,

1078
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,180
we gotta do square.

1079
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:55,920
We gotta get squared.

1080
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:57,300
Come on, Pablo.

1081
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,620
That has to be ball.

1082
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:01,420
Thank god.

1083
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,840
Okay, come on.

1084
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:04,920
Come on, Pablo.

1085
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,300
It's okay, if Dante fucks up, we have Pablo as our backup.

1086
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:10,700
God!

1087
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,200
Okay, that's fine.

1088
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,760
That's fine.

1089
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:16,820
That's fine.

1090
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,600
This is why we got Pablo in.

1091
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:20,600
Come on.

1092
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,340
Pablo.

1093
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,580
I can't help it.

1094
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,020
I just wanna swing.

1095
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,020
Come on, Pablo.

1096
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,240
Baseball is in your blood, Pablo.

1097
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,620
You already have a baseball scholarship.

1098
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,660
And you're like...

1099
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:36,980
What?

1100
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,680
Come on, Pablo.

1101
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:42,940
Come on, Pablo.

1102
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,400
You already have a baseball scholarship.

1103
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,760
And you haven't even gone to middle school yet.

1104
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,380
This is it!

1105
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,540
Go, Pablo!

1106
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:52,920
Yes!

1107
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,100
Yes!

1108
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,780
The first one today.

1109
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,240
Okay, that's...

1110
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,280
Let's go.

1111
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,060
Let's go, Pablo!

1112
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,720
You got us the score we needed.

1113
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,440
Alright, Ashley.

1114
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,540
I know you can't run.

1115
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,900
So I'm just gonna...

1116
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:26,880
We're gonna make sure that your ball will not hit.

1117
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,740
That can't be...

1118
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,760
That's a strike?

1119
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,740
That's barely in there.

1120
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,130
There's no way.

1121
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:39,330
What?

1122
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:42,170
That's barely in the...

1123
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,590
That's not in the square.

1124
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:44,970
There!

1125
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,250
Okay, come on.

1126
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,230
Yes!

1127
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:51,810
Yes!

1128
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:55,750
Kenny!

1129
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,270
You had wheels!

1130
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:00,970
No, Ashley!

1131
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,270
This is your fault, Ashley!

1132
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:04,750
We're benching, Ashley.

1133
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:05,990
We're benching, Ashley.

1134
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:07,370
Kenny.

1135
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:11,430
You're literally in a car, Kenny.

1136
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,430
Kenny, why?

1137
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,270
Why, Kenny?

1138
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:20,710
You're literally...

1139
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,710
I'm angry.

1140
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,110
I'm fucking angry.

1141
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,830
I'm angry.

1142
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:31,210
Now we...

1143
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,070
That's all that was.

1144
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:36,130
Oh my god.

1145
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:39,610
Ashley was the worst mistake I ever made.

1146
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:43,550
Ashley was actually the worst...

1147
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:45,770
The worst mistake I ever made.

1148
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,370
But Angela's gonna...

1149
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,190
Angela...

1150
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:51,290
Has been doing so well for us.

1151
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:51,690
Ball?

1152
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,910
How is mine a ball?

1153
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:55,950
Okay.

1154
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,050
Here we go.

1155
01:12:58,890 --> 01:12:59,550
This should be fine.

1156
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:01,250
Get out!

1157
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,250
Get out of my game!

1158
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,390
Get out!

1159
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:06,330
You don't even have personality or characteristics.

1160
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:10,330
You're all just NPCs against my children.

1161
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:12,670
Alright, let's go.

1162
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,830
Okay, we're gonna put slow-mo.

1163
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,290
Slow-mo will work.

1164
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,010
Nice.

1165
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:20,310
It was so slow.

1166
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:22,070
She can't see more than five frames.

1167
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:24,470
You need both twins.

1168
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,530
But I didn't want both twins.

1169
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:32,350
I didn't realize that they get depressed if it wasn't both twins.

1170
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:35,230
I thought I could get away with one twin.

1171
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,070
Okay, right hook.

1172
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:38,150
Is it?

1173
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,350
No, Angela will never rest.

1174
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,290
Angela, you rest when I tell you, Angela.

1175
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:48,170
You're literally carrying the entire team on your shoulders right now.

1176
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:56,550
Oh my god.

1177
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:56,850
Okay.

1178
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:58,550
We have big freeze.

1179
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,590
We're gonna use extra slow-mo.

1180
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,310
We're gonna use big freeze.

1181
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:02,930
Actually, no.

1182
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:04,610
We gotta left hook first.

1183
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:06,590
He doesn't know.

1184
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,070
You punted?

1185
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,810
Oh my god.

1186
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:12,250
You're both so fucking slow.

1187
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,790
Oh my god.

1188
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:22,590
Oh my god.

1189
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:23,910
Oh my god.

1190
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:24,450
Oh, how?

1191
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:26,270
How?

1192
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:28,890
Who told me to get the frog boy?

1193
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:32,490
Who told me to get the frog boy?

1194
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,650
Oh my god.

1195
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,850
Frog boy was a mistake.

1196
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:38,430
It was...

1197
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:40,150
It was a mistake.

1198
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:43,290
She's a disappointment to the entire team.

1199
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:45,430
What?

1200
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,170
I was like, what's going on?

1201
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,710
What are you trying to steal?

1202
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:56,810
I'm sorry.

1203
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,110
I got brain lag.

1204
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,770
There.

1205
01:14:59,150 --> 01:14:59,650
My god.

1206
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:04,630
I got brain lag right there when she's like trying to steal.

1207
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,130
I was like, what do you mean?

1208
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:09,890
Okay.

1209
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:11,830
Alright, Josinda.

1210
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,670
This is it.

1211
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:15,350
Okay, wait.

1212
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:16,770
Is Josinda fast?

1213
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:18,670
I'm gonna do this.

1214
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:22,130
I'm gonna do this.

1215
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,150
I'm gonna bunt it.

1216
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:25,290
There's no way.

1217
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:27,670
What?

1218
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:28,970
Okay.

1219
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:31,370
Oh, done.

1220
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,210
Okay, it's fine.

1221
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:36,210
Oh, great hitter?

1222
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:37,310
Okay, we'll do this then.

1223
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:38,550
I didn't realize she's a great hitter.

1224
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:39,290
I already forgot.

1225
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:40,850
I forgot all their stats.

1226
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,030
Oh, god.

1227
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,210
Great hitter, my fucking ass.

1228
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,610
Josinda, you're so slow.

1229
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:46,890
Josinda!

1230
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:51,290
Great hitter, my fucking ass.

1231
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,090
A great what?

1232
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,630
What do you mean?

1233
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,650
You hit a bad...

1234
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:05,470
Oh, it's my fault.

1235
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,350
It's my...

1236
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:10,470
Okay.

1237
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,230
Are you fast?

1238
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:13,090
I don't remember.

1239
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:16,010
There's too many kids on my team.

1240
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,750
It's hard to keep track.

1241
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:22,150
Guys, there's too many children on my team.

1242
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:24,090
I can't remember.

1243
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:26,230
I can't remember who's who.

1244
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,870
God damn it, Angela.

1245
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:33,870
Please.

1246
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:34,530
Please.

1247
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:39,210
I'm surprised I couldn't even remember my children's names.

1248
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:41,570
There's so many of you.

1249
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,990
Okay, we got a foul.

1250
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:47,510
We get a foul.

1251
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:48,030
That's fine.

1252
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:49,710
Come on, Angela.

1253
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:50,890
Come on.

1254
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,510
I will never swap you out of you.

1255
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:55,490
No!

1256
01:16:58,150 --> 01:16:59,030
One more foul.

1257
01:16:59,130 --> 01:16:59,850
We can do one more.

1258
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,690
Angela, lock the fuck in.

1259
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:03,690
We need one.

1260
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,310
Angela, please.

1261
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,650
Oh, nice, Angela!

1262
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:08,050
Go!

1263
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,310
Go, Angela!

1264
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,810
Oh, no!

1265
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,370
It's so high in the air!

1266
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:15,110
Angela, you're so slow, Angela!

1267
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:16,310
Oh!

1268
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,580
You got this!

1269
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:23,440
Get your slow ass around the base, Angela!

1270
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,120
You got this!

1271
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:26,300
Oh.

1272
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,320
Oh, my God.

1273
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,240
Get your slow ass across.

1274
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,700
It's so good.

1275
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,140
That's so good.

1276
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,560
Angela!

1277
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:39,940
Angela!

1278
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,560
Alright, here we go.

1279
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,440
We take those.

1280
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,260
Oh, God.

1281
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:46,540
Come on, Achmed.

1282
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,120
We need you to do this for Angela.

1283
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,300
She's so slow.

1284
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:56,580
The fuck is that?

1285
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,400
Come on, lock in.

1286
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,060
Lock in.

1287
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,340
This has to be ball.

1288
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,700
That has to be ball.

1289
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:07,980
That was so out of there.

1290
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,620
Come on, let me walk.

1291
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:10,960
Come on, let me walk.

1292
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,060
Let me walk.

1293
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,360
Oh, that's a walk right there.

1294
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:18,840
Get my walk across!

1295
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,180
Wait, he gets another ball?

1296
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,480
Come on.

1297
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:24,580
Come on.

1298
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,040
Oh, God.

1299
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,080
Damn it.

1300
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:34,010
Give me another ball.

1301
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:37,290
No!

1302
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,310
Achmed!

1303
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:41,870
Oh, God.

1304
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,220
Get your headphones off.

1305
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,880
You can't hear anything.

1306
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,280
You can't hear anything.

1307
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,900
Achmed, take those off.

1308
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:55,460
Oh, my God.

1309
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:55,960
Why did you...

1310
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:56,700
I don't know.

1311
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,720
I don't know the FPS.

1312
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,040
I don't know the...

1313
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,120
Oh, no.

1314
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,500
No, you're so...

1315
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,800
No, you're so slow.

1316
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,600
You're so...

1317
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,700
You're so slow.

1318
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,160
I don't know when I need to hit.

1319
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,380
I can't tell.

1320
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,260
I can't tell the frames of when I'm supposed to hit the ball.

1321
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,200
I...

1322
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:23,820
I don't know the frames per second when I'm supposed to click it.

1323
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,780
What is the hitbox?

1324
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,620
What is the hitbox?

1325
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,220
He's better at bunting.

1326
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,660
Let's bunt two carries at this point.

1327
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:36,500
Here we go.

1328
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,300
How do you fuck up bunting?

1329
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,160
How do you...

1330
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,640
How do you...

1331
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,340
How do you fuck it up?

1332
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,740
How do you fuck up bunting?

1333
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:54,980
Alright.

1334
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,400
Bro, I'm scared.

1335
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,740
How do you...

1336
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,960
How does he fuck up bunting?

1337
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,380
I don't understand.

1338
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,100
This is...

1339
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,960
I don't...

1340
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,140
I don't... Oh, my God.

1341
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,180
After everything Angela did.

1342
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,020
After...

1343
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:21,760
Why'd you bunt?

1344
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,460
Cause chat told me to bunt.

1345
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,260
Angela, I need you.

1346
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,680
Angela, you can do this.

1347
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,620
Go all the way to the end, Angela.

1348
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,720
Oh, my God.

1349
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,640
Get those poor fools out.

1350
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,360
Full strikeout, no hits.

1351
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,580
Angela will swap until I tell her.

1352
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,560
She'll get swapped when I tell her to get swapped.

1353
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,960
She has one more in her, guys.

1354
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,920
She has one more in her.

1355
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,020
She has one more.

1356
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,660
Use all of that.

1357
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,840
That's right.

1358
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:01,780
What?

1359
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,120
Don't worry.

1360
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,560
She'll pitch until...

1361
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,740
Angela, you got this.

1362
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:15,660
Okay, maybe a timeout.

1363
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,520
Maybe a timeout.

1364
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,100
Wait, how do I swap her?

1365
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,160
Okay, Angela, you got it.

1366
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:25,700
We're gonna put you...

1367
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:29,020
Alright, we got...

1368
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,660
Oh, my God, Mark.

1369
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,100
I can't.

1370
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:40,780
No, wait.

1371
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:41,860
She's slow?

1372
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,820
Where do we put her?

1373
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,080
And he's my other only pitcher.

1374
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,240
Where the fuck do we put her?

1375
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,820
Okay, we're gonna put you...

1376
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,880
Oh, you're also slow.

1377
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:52,400
Okay.

1378
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:54,780
Okay, here we go.

1379
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,240
This is it.

1380
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,040
This should be fine.

1381
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,100
These are all fast people.

1382
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:59,500
Oh, you're right.

1383
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,180
We put her as a catcher.

1384
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:01,580
You're right.

1385
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,720
But then he's also... MarkyD is also slow.

1386
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,000
They're both slow.

1387
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,600
What the fuck do I do?

1388
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:12,920
Okay, that's fine.

1389
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,960
Go back in.

1390
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:16,340
Alright.

1391
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,780
Alright, Kenny, I believe in you.

1392
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,400
Get that big freeze in there.

1393
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:22,620
Yeah!

1394
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:23,560
Get out!

1395
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,720
Get out of here.

1396
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,420
I have the best pitchers.

1397
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,060
I have the best pitchers in this team.

1398
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,780
Not bad or dope, but it's not me.

1399
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,280
It's my children's fault.

1400
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:36,920
What?

1401
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:39,520
What?

1402
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:41,760
Oh my god, Ashley.

1403
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,680
Please, Ashley.

1404
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,880
That's fucking right.

1405
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,560
Get out!

1406
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,280
Get out!

1407
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,520
Trying to steal just because my children can't fucking hit balls?

1408
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:57,620
Just...

1409
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,080
That's fucking...

1410
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,200
Okay, we're not doing that again.

1411
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,240
We're not...

1412
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,120
We're not doing that again.

1413
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:10,660
Just because my kids can't hit a ball, you think you can steal a base from me?

1414
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:12,440
Alright.

1415
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,560
Guys, I'm not...

1416
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,860
I'm not a dance mom, guys.

1417
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,480
Get out of here.

1418
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,720
Get that right hook in there.

1419
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,620
Get out!

1420
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,840
Get out of my game!

1421
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:30,460
We are the worst batting team, but we can sure pitch.

1422
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,600
Oh my god, this is so intense.

1423
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,380
This is so intense.

1424
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,080
This is one game.

1425
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,820
This is game one.

1426
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,940
Oh my god, my adrenaline is so high right now.

1427
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,400
This is even better than Koishin.

1428
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,400
This is...

1429
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,860
Oh my god.

1430
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,020
Oh my god.

1431
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,000
I love baseball.

1432
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,700
Oh my god, we have the power hitters on now.

1433
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,080
We got the power hitters in.

1434
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:12,060
This is it, Pete.

1435
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,340
Oh, Pete.

1436
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,700
Oh, Pete.

1437
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,500
Pete, let's go, Pete!

1438
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,120
Go!

1439
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,960
I'm bunting.

1440
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,300
I'm fucking bunting.

1441
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,500
I don't care.

1442
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:49,590
Okay, we're not bunting anymore.

1443
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:52,670
That has to be a ball.

1444
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:53,830
That's a strike?

1445
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:54,070
That's a strike?

1446
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:00,750
That's a strike?

1447
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:02,490
Kenny, please.

1448
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:04,450
Oh, no.

1449
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,790
Kenny, no.

1450
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,530
Toki, please.

1451
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:11,550
How did I miss a bunt?

1452
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:16,450
I thought...

1453
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:21,930
I thought I could...

1454
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:25,290
I thought I was bunting.

1455
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:28,010
I thought I was bunting.

1456
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:29,130
I thought I was bunting.

1457
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:29,990
Oh my god.

1458
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:31,730
I swear.

1459
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:34,570
I thought I hit bunt.

1460
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:35,830
I swear to god.

1461
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:37,150
I swear to god.

1462
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:42,530
Dante, please.

1463
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:44,070
Please.

1464
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,100
Okay, here we go.

1465
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:51,760
Oh my god.

1466
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:53,700
What's the speed?

1467
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,060
Okay, I need to not be early.

1468
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:57,440
I need to not be early.

1469
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,020
Come on, Dante.

1470
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,420
Yes!

1471
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:03,740
Power!

1472
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,780
Oh my god, power.

1473
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,460
We're putting it all in on power.

1474
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:13,480
That has to be a ball.

1475
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:30,130
This coach...

1476
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:34,410
I don't...

1477
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:35,710
I don't understand.

1478
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:38,950
We have more juice.

1479
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:40,270
We're gonna get...

1480
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:44,030
We're gonna lock it up.

1481
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:46,650
Are you serious?

1482
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:48,390
I thought...

1483
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:49,210
Oh my god.

1484
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:49,550
Why

1485
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:56,350
can't my children...

1486
01:26:56,350 --> 01:27:00,170
Why can't my children do the same thing?

1487
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:04,050
I don't understand.

1488
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:08,390
No, we can do this.

1489
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:14,790
Please.

1490
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,930
We can do this, guys.

1491
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:18,510
It's not me.

1492
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:19,730
I swear.

1493
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:21,410
Time out.

1494
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:23,730
Angela, get your ass back in here.

1495
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:24,250
Angela.

1496
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:26,170
Angela, where are you?

1497
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:28,510
Angela, we need you in here.

1498
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,010
We need you in here.

1499
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:31,270
There we go.

1500
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,710
This is it.

1501
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:34,710
Alright, back in it.

1502
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:35,670
Oh my god.

1503
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,830
Get in.

1504
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:39,450
Get that juice in.

1505
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:41,610
Alright.

1506
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,530
Here we go.

1507
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,570
Angela, you've never disappointed me.

1508
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:48,990
We're benching Kenny after that.

1509
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:50,590
We're benching Kenny.

1510
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:52,090
Kenny's back in the bench.

1511
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:56,680
Oh my god.

1512
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,800
Good job.

1513
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,920
Good job, Angela.

1514
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,400
I knew I could always count on you.

1515
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,660
I knew it.

1516
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,920
Come on.

1517
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,400
What?

1518
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:08,360
Foul.

1519
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,020
Nice.

1520
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,040
Another foul.

1521
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,780
That's good.

1522
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:13,320
Heat.

1523
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:17,300
Good job, Angela.

1524
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,540
You're my girl.

1525
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,820
You're my fucking girl.

1526
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:23,220
You've never disappointed me.

1527
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,280
You don't disappoint the coach.

1528
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:26,560
And a strike.

1529
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,180
Get your ass out of here.

1530
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:29,260
Nancy.

1531
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:30,680
Get out.

1532
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:35,860
Alright.

1533
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,940
Mickey O'Connor.

1534
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,200
You have zero personality.

1535
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:42,220
You're just an NPC in this lobby.

1536
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,280
Alright.

1537
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,460
Oh, and we have more juice.

1538
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:45,500
That's good.

1539
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:46,980
Go, Angela.

1540
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:47,400
Go.

1541
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,200
Do another left hook.

1542
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:49,680
Yes.

1543
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:50,620
Foul.

1544
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:52,980
Alright.

1545
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,480
Angela's carrying this team.

1546
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,820
She's putting her entire team up there.

1547
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,400
Another.

1548
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:01,880
No, there's no way.

1549
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:02,980
That's a foul.

1550
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:03,680
There's no way.

1551
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:04,300
I knew it.

1552
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,060
I fucking knew that's a foul.

1553
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,740
Oh my god.

1554
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:11,580
Our entire team might be fucked in terms of batting.

1555
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,820
Not because of me, though, by the way, guys.

1556
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:15,860
Get out.

1557
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:18,760
Get out, Mickey O'Connor.

1558
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,640
Get out.

1559
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:26,720
Don't keep experiencing how it feels to be a mess.

1560
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,620
It's not me.

1561
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,540
I swear to god.

1562
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:34,920
Come on.

1563
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:35,420
Zigzag.

1564
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:37,580
It's not me.

1565
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,260
I'm not the problem.

1566
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,460
I don't know the hitbox and the speed.

1567
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:46,100
What?

1568
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,340
Angela, get over here.

1569
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:50,220
Get out.

1570
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,520
Get out, Angela.

1571
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,000
You got it, girl.

1572
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:58,340
You are the best pitcher in the fucking world.

1573
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,240
Oh my god.

1574
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:04,500
We need one.

1575
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,640
It's one point.

1576
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,700
It's one.

1577
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,820
Come on, Pablo.

1578
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,640
You are my only hope, Pablo.

1579
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:13,800
Where's the auto?

1580
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:17,180
Where's the auto batting?

1581
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,120
Where is it?

1582
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,200
I need one.

1583
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,380
I literally need...

1584
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:24,580
Please.

1585
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:27,320
Please, Pablo.

1586
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,420
What kind of pitcher is she?

1587
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,160
Go, Pablo.

1588
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:35,560
Go.

1589
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,100
Go, Pablo.

1590
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,450
I don't understand.

1591
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,730
I don't understand.

1592
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:59,410
Ashley, go fucking run.

1593
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:01,910
Just run as fast as you...

1594
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:03,250
I don't understand.

1595
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:04,230
I don't understand.

1596
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:06,030
Pablo, how?

1597
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,810
Did I not select...

1598
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,550
I didn't select power.

1599
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:15,490
I didn't even realize I didn't select power.

1600
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,110
I thought he was already on power.

1601
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:19,750
I was so hyped for him.

1602
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:22,450
I...

1603
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:23,710
I...

1604
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:24,270
Oh, no.

1605
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:25,650
You're so slow.

1606
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:26,650
No!

1607
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:32,510
I thought...

1608
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:35,170
I thought he was on power.

1609
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,550
Oh my god, Angela.

1610
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:38,590
This is it.

1611
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:40,670
Does Angela do well on power?

1612
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:41,770
I can't remember.

1613
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:42,830
Guys.

1614
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:45,310
Angela, this is it.

1615
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:45,750
All in.

1616
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:46,510
All on you.

1617
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:48,570
All on you, Angela.

1618
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,110
It's okay.

1619
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:51,930
It's okay, Angela.

1620
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:54,410
Angela, it's all on you.

1621
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:54,850
Angela.

1622
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:57,410
It's all on you.

1623
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:00,130
We just gotta hit one hit.

1624
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:03,850
Okay.

1625
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:08,030
Angela, it's now or never, Angela.

1626
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:12,950
Angela, come on.

1627
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:13,570
How?

1628
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:14,750
Are you serious?

1629
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:15,650
How?

1630
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:16,510
How?

1631
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:18,530
Angela, please.

1632
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:19,450
Please, this is it.

1633
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:20,730
This is your character arc.

1634
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:24,890
Angela, please.

1635
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:26,510
No, not another foul.

1636
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:27,530
We have one more.

1637
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,170
We have one more.

1638
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:31,130
There's no pressure, Angela.

1639
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,270
There's no pressure.

1640
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:35,370
No!

1641
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:35,890
No!

1642
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:39,350
No!

1643
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:44,330
It's okay.

1644
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:46,230
Guys, team.

1645
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:48,970
Team.

1646
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:50,450
It's okay.

1647
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:52,850
It's one game.

1648
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:53,850
Rockets.

1649
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:57,330
Rockets, this is our character arc.

1650
01:32:57,890 --> 01:32:58,450
We...

1651
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:01,270
We might have lost the first game.

1652
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:05,270
Rockets, don't...

1653
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:07,430
Don't let this loss affect you.

1654
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,170
This is one game.

1655
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:10,210
Rockets.

1656
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:11,510
Rockets.

1657
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,050
It's okay.

1658
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,990
They were the hardest team in this entire lineup.

1659
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:26,130
We still have the whole season ahead of us.

1660
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:27,890
It's okay.

1661
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:31,030
Like, we're not even last.

1662
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,730
We're fifth place.

1663
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:35,590
It's okay.

1664
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:38,350
We have the entire season.

1665
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:39,710
Rockets.

1666
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:41,850
Guys.

1667
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,510
Alright, group pep talk here.

1668
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:46,690
Guys, it's not me.

1669
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:51,550
Good pep talk.

1670
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:57,710
Look.

1671
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:58,290
Look.

1672
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:01,030
We all know who the MVP is here.

1673
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:03,150
And it's goddamn Angela.

1674
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:08,010
Angela has put our entire team on her fucking backs.

1675
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:09,650
And like, we got...

1676
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:09,830
Look.

1677
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:10,850
Look, guys.

1678
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:13,550
The moment I realized what the...

1679
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:19,090
What the hitbox and the frames and the projectile speed of the baseball is.

1680
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:20,910
It's all over, team.

1681
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:24,290
I just haven't downloaded the projectile speed yet.

1682
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:27,690
The moment I figure out what the projectile speed of the baseball is.

1683
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:28,850
The moment I figure out what the projectile speed is.

1684
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:30,430
It's so over.

1685
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:31,290
It's...

1686
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:35,090
It's gonna...

1687
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:36,350
We're gonna do it.

1688
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:39,810
I just need to know the projectile speed of this game.

1689
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:43,490
Alright, guys.

1690
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:44,650
This is it.

1691
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:46,050
Come on, Rockets.

1692
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,150
This is it.

1693
01:34:58,090 --> 01:34:59,950
The crazy Giants.

1694
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,490
Oh, my God.

1695
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:01,410
It's the Giants.

1696
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:03,890
Pablo is gonna leave.

1697
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:05,290
But Pablo...

1698
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:07,850
Pablo fucked up.

1699
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,370
It's not because I fucked up.

1700
01:35:09,610 --> 01:35:10,450
Pablo fucked up.

1701
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:11,010
Not me.

1702
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:16,050
This is it.

1703
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:20,390
Alright.

1704
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:22,630
This is where we're gonna redeem ourselves.

1705
01:35:24,130 --> 01:35:26,550
New York Football Giants.

1706
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:29,550
Do you need medical attention, Dookie?

1707
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:31,690
Especially if the joke is that hard.

1708
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:33,890
Are you saying thank you for the super chat thing?

1709
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,010
Oh, guys.

1710
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:35,990
We're gonna...

1711
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:37,110
This is our character arc.

1712
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:41,330
We lose our first game, and then we're gonna fucking register everything.

1713
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:43,550
This is it.

1714
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:46,970
Oh, my God.

1715
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:49,210
I figured...

1716
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:50,910
I'm figuring out the speed, guys.

1717
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:54,490
I'm figuring out the speed right now.

1718
01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:59,750
Oh, come on!

1719
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:01,990
Come on!

1720
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:04,010
Power.

1721
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:05,470
Come on.

1722
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:17,190
What is the projectile speed?

1723
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:20,770
Yes!

1724
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:21,670
Let's go!

1725
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:23,330
Don't catch it!

1726
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:32,030
No!

1727
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:34,410
I can't do...

1728
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:35,930
Kenny, please.

1729
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:40,670
Kenny, please.

1730
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:42,490
Kenny, yes!

1731
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:43,750
Get that out there!

1732
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,390
No!

1733
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:44,910
Kenny!

1734
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:50,930
At least I'm hitting it.

1735
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:52,950
Guys, I'm hitting the ball.

1736
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:56,150
Guys, I'm hitting the ball now.

1737
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:56,990
Okay.

1738
01:36:57,090 --> 01:36:58,890
The ball is getting hit.

1739
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:04,330
Oh, my God.

1740
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:06,950
Oh, thank God.

1741
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:08,410
The ball is getting hit.

1742
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:14,910
Okay,

1743
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:19,290
Pablo.

1744
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:21,610
This is it, Pablo.

1745
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:22,570
This is it, Pablo.

1746
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:25,950
I'm hitting the ball.

1747
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:27,850
They're getting caught.

1748
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:30,050
But I'm hitting the ball, though.

1749
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:31,490
I'm hitting it.

1750
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:32,710
This is it.

1751
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:33,770
Come on, Pablo.

1752
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:36,650
That had to be a ball.

1753
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:38,210
That had to be a ball.

1754
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,450
We're in power.

1755
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:43,230
This is it.

1756
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:44,810
We're doing it.

1757
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:47,730
There's no way.

1758
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:49,110
I was gonna say, there's no way.

1759
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:52,670
Come on.

1760
01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:54,750
Come on.

1761
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:00,150
Come on.

1762
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:03,570
Come on, Pablo.

1763
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:05,370
Don't do this to me.

1764
01:38:07,690 --> 01:38:08,850
Ball three.

1765
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:10,090
One more ball, Pablo.

1766
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:11,530
One more ball.

1767
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:14,110
We're gonna get the easiest walk of our lives, Pablo.

1768
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:20,190
Swing!

1769
01:38:20,530 --> 01:38:21,250
Go, Pablo!

1770
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:22,310
Pablo, no!

1771
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:24,250
Pablo!

1772
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:33,020
Oh,

1773
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,680
my God, Pablo.

1774
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:38,960
I'm hitting the ball.

1775
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,600
I'm hitting the ball.

1776
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,060
I'm hitting it.

1777
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:43,500
He hit the ball.

1778
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,500
He hit the ball.

1779
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:49,480
I thought you guys said Pablo was the juice.

1780
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,460
I thought you said Pablo was the blood.

1781
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,560
When baseball was in his blood.

1782
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,540
I'm not even throwing anymore.

1783
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:58,920
This is all Pablo.

1784
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:01,360
This is all Pablo.

1785
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:02,800
That's ball, Angela.

1786
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,660
What happened?

1787
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:06,880
It's first inning.

1788
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,240
Oh, my God.

1789
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,440
Why can't my children do this?

1790
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:15,060
Oh, Kenny.

1791
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,140
Why?

1792
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:18,740
Why, Kenny?

1793
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:20,440
No!

1794
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,020
Move your ass.

1795
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:23,740
Move.

1796
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:25,400
Run.

1797
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:27,960
Run.

1798
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:30,080
I need this.

1799
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:31,400
Be quiet.

1800
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:40,880
I couldn't.

1801
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,860
I couldn't trick the AI.

1802
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,380
What happened?

1803
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,680
What happened, Angela?

1804
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:47,260
What?

1805
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:51,440
Angela, what happened?

1806
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:53,940
Angela!

1807
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,760
At least

1808
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:08,410
get him out.

1809
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:09,810
Oh, thank God.

1810
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:13,690
How is this team even better?

1811
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:16,250
How is this team better?

1812
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:18,590
This team is not bad.

1813
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:20,070
No!

1814
01:40:20,690 --> 01:40:24,330
We still have so many innings left, guys.

1815
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:25,010
This is...

1816
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:27,290
This is our character art.

1817
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:29,970
This is our character art, guys.

1818
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,530
How can they analyze Angela?

1819
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:37,830
Angela, please.

1820
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:39,970
You are literally the chosen one, Angela.

1821
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:41,170
Get out.

1822
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:41,930
Yes!

1823
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,360
We need one more.

1824
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:52,500
We got Molly out.

1825
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:53,620
Just one more.

1826
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:55,940
One more, guys.

1827
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,020
Oh, my God.

1828
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,980
How do they do this?

1829
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:00,440
Who is their coach?

1830
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:03,460
How are they hitting their balls?

1831
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:04,260
I don't know.

1832
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,740
Who is their coach?

1833
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:09,280
How did you get my zigzag?

1834
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:11,620
Get out.

1835
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:12,780
Just get out.

1836
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,520
He is coaching.

1837
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:15,540
Get out.

1838
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:19,840
No, it's not falling apart.

1839
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,840
We can redeem ourselves.

1840
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,640
We got him.

1841
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:24,520
They are all out.

1842
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,980
We are hitting the ball now, guys.

1843
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,280
We are hitting the ball.

1844
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:31,700
Guys, we are hitting their ball.

1845
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:34,140
We are figuring it out.

1846
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:35,460
What do you mean?

1847
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,500
Your team had a coach.

1848
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,560
It has to be ball.

1849
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:41,680
What?

1850
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:42,640
What?

1851
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,220
Oh, my God.

1852
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,160
That did not look like...

1853
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:55,580
It's so high.

1854
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,840
It's higher than my face.

1855
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:03,990
Okay.

1856
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:04,950
Come on.

1857
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:06,970
There is no way.

1858
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:09,450
Yes.

1859
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:11,590
Thank God, Ashley.

1860
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:12,830
Thank God.

1861
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:14,930
Oh, my God, Ashley.

1862
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:16,430
Okay.

1863
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:18,570
We got this.

1864
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,130
You are the slowest...

1865
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:22,690
runner out there.

1866
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:24,490
We got this.

1867
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:27,670
We got this.

1868
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:31,090
Oh, come on.

1869
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:32,710
Yes.

1870
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:33,930
Go, Ashley.

1871
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:34,550
Go.

1872
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,270
Oh, my God.

1873
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:37,990
You are so slow.

1874
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:38,450
Go.

1875
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,450
You are so slow.

1876
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:44,790
Oh, my God.

1877
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:47,550
We are okay.

1878
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:50,790
Nice hit.

1879
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:54,230
Oh, my God.

1880
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:55,550
Angela.

1881
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:58,550
We are going in on the power, Angela.

1882
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:01,830
Angela, this is it.

1883
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:03,290
You got this.

1884
01:43:03,570 --> 01:43:04,930
Remember what you trained for.

1885
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:09,510
It's okay.

1886
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:10,210
It's okay, Angela.

1887
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:12,850
We all make mistakes, Angela.

1888
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:14,270
It's okay.

1889
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:19,110
It's okay.

1890
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:20,190
That's all right.

1891
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:21,450
We all make mistakes.

1892
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:24,710
It's okay, Angela.

1893
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:33,350
It's okay, Angela.

1894
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:34,690
It's okay, Angela.

1895
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:36,130
You are just a thrower.

1896
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:37,330
You are just a pitcher.

1897
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:38,830
You are not meant to bat.

1898
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:40,090
And that's okay, sweetie.

1899
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:41,990
Oh, my God, Achmed.

1900
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:44,290
Okay, Achmed.

1901
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:48,670
Okay, Achmed.

1902
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:51,770
This is going to be a little awful.

1903
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:54,350
Achmed, we had not been doing well with you.

1904
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:54,770
Achmed.

1905
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:57,090
Oh, my God, Achmed.

1906
01:43:58,170 --> 01:43:59,490
Oh, my God, Achmed.

1907
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:00,870
I don't know what to do with you.

1908
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:02,830
I don't know what to do with you, Achmed.

1909
01:44:03,690 --> 01:44:04,330
Just swing.

1910
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:08,970
Achmed, just lock in.

1911
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:10,810
I need you to lock in.

1912
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:12,350
That's all I need you to...

1913
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:13,330
Oh, my God, I'm just going to do a butt.

1914
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:14,930
Achmed, just lock in.

1915
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:15,530
That's all I want.

1916
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:18,890
Achmed, just...

1917
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:21,770
Achmed, I just...

1918
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:22,610
Oh, my God, that's fine.

1919
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:24,870
That's fine.

1920
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:26,010
That's...

1921
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:33,190
I heard somebody say butt.

1922
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:35,170
And I was like, alright, I'm going to do it.

1923
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:43,150
I'll never butt again.

1924
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:45,450
I'm never going to butt again.

1925
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:46,950
Alright, Marky, please.

1926
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:49,550
Oh, God.

1927
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:50,150
Oh, God, come on.

1928
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:51,590
Oh, my God.

1929
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,900
Let's go, Ashley.

1930
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:58,100
Go, Ashley, go.

1931
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,800
Just run for your life.

1932
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:03,930
Let's go, Ashley.

1933
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:07,070
Let's fucking go.

1934
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:11,710
He did it.

1935
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:13,890
He fucking did it.

1936
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:15,870
Oh, my God.

1937
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:19,010
Marky, you actually...

1938
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:21,830
Are you mad, man?

1939
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:23,310
Are you fucking mad, man?

1940
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:25,770
Oh, my God.

1941
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:31,270
Oh, my God, go, go, go, go, go.

1942
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:35,470
As fast as you can.

1943
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:35,970
Go.

1944
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:40,550
There's no way she can throw that far and you fucking know it.

1945
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:42,050
Get that second point in.

1946
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:44,070
Yeah, do you know what?

1947
01:45:44,190 --> 01:45:46,170
Let's go, let's go.

1948
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:49,010
This might be the craziest shit I've ever done.

1949
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,670
Let's go.

1950
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:58,350
Oh, my God.

1951
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:00,110
Kenny, come on.

1952
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:01,870
Kenny, we're making...

1953
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:03,290
The arc is now...

1954
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:05,130
Our baseball arc is right here.

1955
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:08,130
I can't believe it.

1956
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:10,290
It's time to fucking believe.

1957
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:12,050
That's okay.

1958
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:15,950
All right, that's fine.

1959
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:18,030
That's so fine.

1960
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:19,630
Come on, Kenny.

1961
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:22,130
That has to be a ball.

1962
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:23,770
Thank God, that's a ball.

1963
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:26,230
Absolute cinema.

1964
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:29,130
The redemption arc right here.

1965
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:34,470
Oh, come on.

1966
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:35,210
Was I too...

1967
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:37,350
Was I too slow?

1968
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:39,070
Kenny, please.

1969
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:41,210
Kenny, I need you to hit one ball.

1970
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:44,810
That has to be a ball.

1971
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:45,490
That has to be a ball.

1972
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:46,790
Thank God, okay.

1973
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:47,650
That has to be a ball.

1974
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,310
That's too late.

1975
01:46:51,450 --> 01:46:51,750
Okay.

1976
01:46:53,170 --> 01:46:53,810
Come on.

1977
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:57,070
Yes!

1978
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:57,470
No!

1979
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,950
One ball.

1980
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:04,630
Just one hit, Kenny.

1981
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:05,850
That's all I need.

1982
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:08,550
No!

1983
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:09,970
Kenny!

1984
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:10,070
Kenny!

1985
01:47:13,570 --> 01:47:16,130
Oh, I just need you to hit one.

1986
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:18,090
It's okay, we're ahead.

1987
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,670
We're ahead, guys.

1988
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:20,930
We're ahead.

1989
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:22,630
Barely, but we're ahead.

1990
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:23,770
Oh my God.

1991
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:26,910
Holy shit.

1992
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,970
Okay, Zigzag, come on, Angela.

1993
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:31,030
We're literally...

1994
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:32,930
We're literally ahead by one.

1995
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:35,590
This is the first time we've ever been ahead, chat.

1996
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:38,810
Dragons, this is literally the first game that we've been ahead.

1997
01:47:38,810 --> 01:47:40,730
Gotta retire Pablo.

1998
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:43,050
This is 15th year in the league.

1999
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:44,990
Thank you for the super chat, Laura.

2000
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:45,490
Thank you.

2001
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:46,670
How?

2002
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,950
How?

2003
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:51,750
Kenny, please.

2004
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:53,370
Get in there.

2005
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:57,350
I'm gonna trick the AI.

2006
01:47:59,090 --> 01:48:00,550
That's fucking right.

2007
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:01,870
Get out.

2008
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:02,990
I'm desperate.

2009
01:48:03,610 --> 01:48:04,330
Get out.

2010
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,580
Get over here.

2011
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:15,200
Okay.

2012
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:24,150
Okay.

2013
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:25,050
Alright.

2014
01:48:25,970 --> 01:48:27,070
Get out.

2015
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,700
Get the fuck out of my game.

2016
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,860
Get out of my game.

2017
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:42,080
It worked, though.

2018
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,040
Guys.

2019
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:46,240
Let my girl...

2020
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:47,820
If they get tired...

2021
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:49,600
If they get tired...

2022
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:50,800
Get out of my game.

2023
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,600
Who hurt you?

2024
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,220
The entire Major League Baseball.

2025
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,020
Thank you for the super chat.

2026
01:48:59,200 --> 01:48:59,600
Thank you.

2027
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,040
Congratulations on your position.

2028
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:07,520
I can tell from your performance...

2029
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,140
That you're on to do great things.

2030
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:10,700
Thank you for the super chat.

2031
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:12,360
Thank you.

2032
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:15,640
We got tired of them.

2033
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:16,160
Get out.

2034
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:18,740
We got tired of them.

2035
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,240
We tired them out.

2036
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:21,660
We win.

2037
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:24,360
Thank you for the super chat.

2038
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:25,020
Thank you.

2039
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:28,700
She's holding up the entire team.

2040
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,420
And her coach on her back.

2041
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,080
There you go.

2042
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:34,640
Thank God.

2043
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:35,480
Another foul.

2044
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:40,580
She's in a game made for toddlers.

2045
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,080
That's my streamer.

2046
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:43,500
What?

2047
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:47,040
How is it so good?

2048
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:49,740
Oh my God.

2049
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,300
She's slow.

2050
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:52,540
No.

2051
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,380
Don't.

2052
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,500
Come on.

2053
01:49:56,810 --> 01:49:57,480
Come on.

2054
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:58,580
You know you want to run.

2055
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:05,050
Get out.

2056
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:07,150
Come on.

2057
01:50:07,670 --> 01:50:08,250
Run.

2058
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:11,590
You know you want to run.

2059
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:13,470
You know you want to run.

2060
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:14,610
She doesn't want to run.

2061
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:20,010
Thank you.

2062
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:22,130
She refuses to run.

2063
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:26,610
He's going to make this entire league.

2064
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:31,110
Thank you for the super chat.

2065
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:32,610
Thank you.

2066
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:37,370
She saw what I did to the other kid.

2067
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:39,110
What do you mean?

2068
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:42,570
I don't know what you're talking about.

2069
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:47,930
Her coach is streaming.

2070
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:48,590
Stay.

2071
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:52,790
Are you serious?

2072
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:53,810
Dante, come on.

2073
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:54,650
Nice.

2074
01:50:56,990 --> 01:50:58,450
That's fucking right.

2075
01:50:58,610 --> 01:50:59,130
Get out.

2076
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:00,610
Come on.

2077
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:01,310
Run.

2078
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:02,670
Run.

2079
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:04,230
You know you want to run.

2080
01:51:05,010 --> 01:51:06,210
Come on.

2081
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:07,490
Come on.

2082
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:07,690
Run.

2083
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:11,770
She's just staying there.

2084
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:16,810
She's just staying there.

2085
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:17,950
She's not running.

2086
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:19,470
I don't understand.

2087
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:21,030
Why is she running?

2088
01:51:22,130 --> 01:51:23,930
I don't understand.

2089
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:26,330
She knows.

2090
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:28,690
They're learning.

2091
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:31,670
Come on.

2092
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:32,070
Run.

2093
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:33,490
You fucking coward.

2094
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,350
I don't understand.

2095
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:43,030
I don't understand why she's not running.

2096
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:51,190
This is 1997.

2097
01:51:51,890 --> 01:51:53,090
How are they getting smarter?

2098
01:51:57,190 --> 01:51:58,610
Why aren't you running?

2099
01:51:58,910 --> 01:51:59,950
That was so in.

2100
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:00,790
I know, right?

2101
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:04,490
Ramsey, thank you for your very first super chat.

2102
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:04,870
Thank you.

2103
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:06,610
Oh my god.

2104
01:52:06,830 --> 01:52:07,350
How?

2105
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:09,910
Get out.

2106
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:12,270
I can say for certain.

2107
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:13,770
I wish Doki was my coach.

2108
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:15,930
Thank you for your very first super chat.

2109
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:16,970
Thank you.

2110
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:18,450
Thank god.

2111
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:19,370
We're still in the lead.

2112
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:23,730
Still in the lead, guys.

2113
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:26,190
Oh my god.

2114
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:27,110
Dante, please.

2115
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:32,990
Guys, I know how to...

2116
01:52:32,990 --> 01:52:34,430
I know how to hit now.

2117
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:36,050
I know how to bat.

2118
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:37,750
I figured it out.

2119
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:45,630
I figured it out now.

2120
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:47,770
This is it.

2121
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:48,350
This time.

2122
01:52:48,790 --> 01:52:49,370
This time.

2123
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:50,950
There has to be a ball.

2124
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:51,870
There's no one.

2125
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:52,310
Okay.

2126
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:55,490
I'm not gonna bunt.

2127
01:52:55,590 --> 01:52:56,710
That time I bunted.

2128
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:57,610
It was a mistake.

2129
01:52:59,230 --> 01:52:59,830
This is it.

2130
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:00,230
This is it.

2131
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:03,710
That's it.

2132
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:04,370
Go.

2133
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:04,950
Go.

2134
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,200
It's not gonna be a mistake.

2135
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:14,180
It's not gonna be a mistake.

2136
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:15,320
Dante, let's go.

2137
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:21,030
Let's fucking go.

2138
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:24,430
Oh my god.

2139
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:25,890
We're doing it.

2140
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:27,030
Run for me, boy.

2141
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:27,710
Run.

2142
01:53:29,590 --> 01:53:30,670
Oh my god, Pablo.

2143
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:31,630
This is it.

2144
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:35,910
Pablo, if you get a home run, we get two bases.

2145
01:53:35,910 --> 01:53:38,230
Pablo, please.

2146
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:41,810
Pablo, if Dante can do this, so can you, Pablo.

2147
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:43,490
This is it.

2148
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:44,110
Pablo.

2149
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:48,040
Pablo, please.

2150
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:50,830
For the love of...

2151
01:53:50,830 --> 01:53:51,110
Pablo.

2152
01:53:59,150 --> 01:53:59,970
Pablo.

2153
01:54:00,450 --> 01:54:01,710
What happened?

2154
01:54:02,190 --> 01:54:04,190
What happened to you?

2155
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:05,050
What?

2156
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:08,270
They all told me you were a prodigy.

2157
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:13,350
Everybody told me you were a fucking prodigy.

2158
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:19,030
Fucking prodigy.

2159
01:54:19,370 --> 01:54:21,290
Were they all lying?

2160
01:54:22,110 --> 01:54:24,310
Ashley did more than you.

2161
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:25,390
Ashley.

2162
01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:28,410
Fucking motherfucking Ashley.

2163
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:37,730
He is your judgment.

2164
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:39,870
Ashley did more.

2165
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:43,650
Ashley picking up his slack.

2166
01:54:46,590 --> 01:54:48,970
Oh my god.

2167
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:51,990
Has to be a ball.

2168
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:53,710
That's a strike?

2169
01:54:54,630 --> 01:54:55,650
Oh my god.

2170
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:58,370
Ashley popped off.

2171
01:54:59,910 --> 01:55:01,210
Oh my god.

2172
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:02,490
I don't understand.

2173
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:05,030
How does...

2174
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:07,650
How does fucking Ashley...

2175
01:55:08,210 --> 01:55:09,210
No, no, no, no.

2176
01:55:09,370 --> 01:55:10,750
No, no, no, no.

2177
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:11,950
Ashley, no, no!

2178
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:18,990
Jacinda, why?

2179
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:21,470
Why, Jacinda?

2180
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:22,230
Why?

2181
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:25,630
I didn't think you were gonna...

2182
01:55:25,630 --> 01:55:26,610
It's okay, we're ahead.

2183
01:55:26,770 --> 01:55:27,550
We're ahead.

2184
01:55:27,850 --> 01:55:28,450
We're ahead.

2185
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:34,110
It's okay.

2186
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:34,850
Guys, no.

2187
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:36,050
It's not over.

2188
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:36,830
We're ahead.

2189
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:39,570
We're ahead right now.

2190
01:55:40,110 --> 01:55:40,870
Angela's ready.

2191
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:43,350
Angela's so ready now.

2192
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:48,950
Pablo got paid off.

2193
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:51,270
Pablo's playing against the team.

2194
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:52,910
There's no other way.

2195
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:54,910
I refuse to believe...

2196
01:55:57,870 --> 01:56:01,930
I refuse to believe Pablo...

2197
01:56:02,710 --> 01:56:04,510
Pablo was like a person anymore.

2198
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:05,950
There's no way.

2199
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:10,410
The story of Doki's legacy in baseball is having so many twists and turns.

2200
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:12,330
Marie, thank you for the superchat.

2201
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:12,750
Thank you.

2202
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:13,510
Thank you.

2203
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:15,810
Pablo must have got bought out.

2204
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:18,910
There's no way that fucking...

2205
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:21,590
I...

2206
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:22,010
Okay.

2207
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,010
Come on.

2208
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:26,370
Get out.

2209
01:56:26,530 --> 01:56:26,950
Get out.

2210
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:28,410
You think you can fool Angela?

2211
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:30,330
You think you can fool her?

2212
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:32,830
Angela's coming in clutch.

2213
01:56:34,210 --> 01:56:36,530
He's a rat for fucking the Giants.

2214
01:56:36,650 --> 01:56:38,690
He's a rat for the Giants.

2215
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:39,970
I refuse to believe.

2216
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:43,090
I refuse to believe he's like...

2217
01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:44,750
Oh my god, Angela, do this again.

2218
01:56:45,310 --> 01:56:46,370
Angela, do this again.

2219
01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:47,270
That's right.

2220
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:47,850
Get out.

2221
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:49,990
Get your ass out of here.

2222
01:56:51,090 --> 01:56:54,370
She is a goddamn prodigy.

2223
01:56:56,110 --> 01:56:56,450
Out.

2224
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:57,930
Let's go.

2225
01:56:58,770 --> 01:56:59,270
Easy.

2226
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:03,050
A poor workman blames his tools.

2227
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:06,250
Gordon Freeman, thank you for the superchat.

2228
01:57:06,370 --> 01:57:06,610
Thank you.

2229
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:07,230
Thank you.

2230
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:09,770
Angela, you are doing it.

2231
01:57:09,970 --> 01:57:13,930
Pablo Sanchez must be holding up for a large contract.

2232
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:16,410
Carla, thank you for the superchat.

2233
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:16,870
Thank you.

2234
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:17,670
Thank you.

2235
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:20,430
Pablo Sanchez?

2236
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:22,790
Who the fuck is he?

2237
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:27,950
Everything Pablo has done has been...

2238
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:30,150
has been nothing.

2239
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:32,790
He has done nothing for this team.

2240
01:57:34,010 --> 01:57:36,250
Alright, we're gonna put open right here.

2241
01:57:37,290 --> 01:57:38,450
Come on, Angela.

2242
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:41,730
That's another ball.

2243
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:42,070
Good.

2244
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,810
Good.

2245
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:44,490
Power?

2246
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:45,430
Alright, Angela.

2247
01:57:46,190 --> 01:57:48,810
This must have been out Charlie Brown.

2248
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:51,430
That has to be another ball.

2249
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:53,570
One more.

2250
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:55,590
Give me a walker for Angela.

2251
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:02,220
Oh, she's...

2252
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:02,800
Let's go.

2253
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:05,140
Let's go, Angela.

2254
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:08,660
Let's fucking go, Angela.

2255
01:58:14,810 --> 01:58:15,970
Let's go.

2256
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:18,150
Let's go.

2257
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:19,730
let's go.

2258
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:21,510
Pablo Caneve.

2259
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:24,450
You're a pitcher and a batter.

2260
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:27,190
Angela, let's go.

2261
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:28,950
Okay, Akhmed, okay.

2262
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:31,310
Don't fuck this up for her.

2263
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:33,930
Don't fuck this up for Angela, Akhmed.

2264
01:58:34,030 --> 01:58:36,210
I swear to God, that's all I ask.

2265
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:38,530
Do not fuck this up for her.

2266
01:58:39,910 --> 01:58:41,050
That has to be a ball.

2267
01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:42,090
That has to be, yeah.

2268
01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:46,670
Come on, Angela, the true MC.

2269
01:58:52,070 --> 01:58:53,410
No, that's a foul.

2270
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:56,570
Hey, batter, batter, batter.

2271
01:58:57,870 --> 01:58:58,710
Come on.

2272
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:00,190
Come on, Akhmed.

2273
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:02,070
Don't fuck this up for Angela.

2274
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:05,130
Akhmed, please!

2275
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:07,450
Please, Akhmed.

2276
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:11,370
Don't fuck this up for her.

2277
01:59:16,490 --> 01:59:17,490
Akhmed.

2278
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:21,670
Again.

2279
01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:23,910
I need you to hit one.

2280
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:25,450
One ball.

2281
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:29,150
Oh my God.

2282
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:30,870
Okay, Marky.

2283
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:31,750
Marky boy.

2284
01:59:33,390 --> 01:59:34,970
Okay, Marky.

2285
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:39,150
You are one of the slowest runners, so we're gonna...

2286
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:39,470
Alright.

2287
01:59:42,350 --> 01:59:43,210
That's a ball.

2288
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:44,650
Okay, Mark.

2289
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:46,630
Okay, fucking Marky Mark.

2290
01:59:47,250 --> 01:59:50,170
Marky Mark, remember what you've done before, Marky Mark.

2291
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:53,570
Oh, no.

2292
01:59:54,570 --> 01:59:55,730
No, goodbye.

2293
01:59:58,350 --> 01:59:59,970
Nerdy, thank you for the super chat.

2294
02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:00,950
Thank you, thank you.

2295
02:00:01,310 --> 02:00:04,190
Okay, wish Daniel and me a happy first wedding anniversary.

2296
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:05,690
This is one of his favorite games.

2297
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:08,410
He asked Daniel how to fucking win.

2298
02:00:09,390 --> 02:00:11,270
But happy anniversary.

2299
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:12,710
Nerdy.

2300
02:00:13,230 --> 02:00:13,490
Thank you.

2301
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:17,090
Frog boy was not locked in.

2302
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:18,490
He was not.

2303
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:23,030
How did he win?

2304
02:00:23,770 --> 02:00:24,950
Oh, no.

2305
02:00:25,470 --> 02:00:26,150
Run!

2306
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:28,610
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

2307
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:30,550
You're not fucking getting there.

2308
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:31,470
You're not.

2309
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:33,830
Angela, you had to stay.

2310
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:35,250
You're not getting over there.

2311
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,490
I saw how slow she was running.

2312
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:40,650
I knew it was over.

2313
02:00:41,090 --> 02:00:44,570
I knew it was over with her running.

2314
02:00:46,710 --> 02:00:48,070
Okay, Kenny, please.

2315
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:50,430
You haven't zeroed out for two today.

2316
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:51,650
But this is the moment.

2317
02:00:54,530 --> 02:00:55,070
How?

2318
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:58,030
Kenny, that...

2319
02:00:58,030 --> 02:00:58,890
How?

2320
02:00:59,490 --> 02:01:00,110
Kenny, how?

2321
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:01,150
Kenny.

2322
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:02,690
Kenny, how?

2323
02:01:04,030 --> 02:01:15,190
Okay, that's it.

2324
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:23,400
Kenny!

2325
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:31,490
Kenny, this is...

2326
02:01:31,490 --> 02:01:32,770
Zero out of three.

2327
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:33,750
Kenny.

2328
02:01:34,410 --> 02:01:37,710
You had...

2329
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:44,250
You had one job, Oh my god, do we have juice?

2330
02:01:44,650 --> 02:01:45,930
Guys, we need juice here.

2331
02:01:46,290 --> 02:01:48,670
Guys, bring in the juice.

2332
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:49,850
Where's the juice?

2333
02:01:52,450 --> 02:01:54,270
Alright, that's fine.

2334
02:01:55,470 --> 02:01:55,850
Okay.

2335
02:01:56,350 --> 02:01:56,990
Where's Kenny?

2336
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:58,410
Can he get in here?

2337
02:01:59,010 --> 02:02:00,170
We need you here.

2338
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:01,390
I need you here.

2339
02:02:01,950 --> 02:02:03,930
And then, this is fine.

2340
02:02:04,890 --> 02:02:05,310
Okay.

2341
02:02:06,270 --> 02:02:07,050
Alright, Kenny.

2342
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:09,850
Oh my god.

2343
02:02:10,190 --> 02:02:11,270
Kenny, please.

2344
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:13,810
Oh my god.

2345
02:02:13,930 --> 02:02:14,970
Kenny, please.

2346
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:18,110
Do not fuck this up for me.

2347
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:19,570
Kenny, I can't.

2348
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:21,690
Oh my god.

2349
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:26,130
They're just... Baseball is a serious sport.

2350
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:27,670
It doesn't matter if they're children.

2351
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:30,690
It doesn't matter if they're kids.

2352
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:33,630
This is all or nothing right now for these children.

2353
02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:43,750
If they don't make it out of the BPL, If they don't make it out of the BPL, they'll never get anywhere in life.

2354
02:02:45,450 --> 02:02:46,970
They gotta learn.

2355
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:50,510
There's no crying in baseball.

2356
02:02:52,230 --> 02:02:54,390
It's a backyard baseball league.

2357
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:55,870
It's serious.

2358
02:02:56,150 --> 02:02:57,370
It's so serious.

2359
02:02:57,690 --> 02:03:00,250
It's the champion of the fucking universe.

2360
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:08,310
It's literally the champion of the fucking universe, guys.

2361
02:03:09,010 --> 02:03:10,350
The fuck is elevator?

2362
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:16,910
What the fuck is elevator?

2363
02:03:17,170 --> 02:03:18,090
That did nothing.

2364
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:23,070
Oh my god.

2365
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:23,590
It's fine.

2366
02:03:23,590 --> 02:03:24,050
We have two.

2367
02:03:24,210 --> 02:03:24,430
One more.

2368
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:26,590
Oh my god.

2369
02:03:26,650 --> 02:03:27,150
Come on.

2370
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:29,030
Kenny, please.

2371
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:30,830
For the love of god.

2372
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:33,170
Strike one.

2373
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:33,590
Nice.

2374
02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:34,590
Okay.

2375
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:36,290
That's good.

2376
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:38,370
That's good.

2377
02:03:39,610 --> 02:03:40,570
Lock in.

2378
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:42,270
Lock in, Kenny.

2379
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:43,530
You're the backup.

2380
02:03:43,650 --> 02:03:44,190
I need you.

2381
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,410
Oh my god.

2382
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:47,710
Kenny, please!

2383
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:52,040
Oh my god.

2384
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:52,440
Pick it up.

2385
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:54,400
Come on.

2386
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:55,360
Run!

2387
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:56,920
Run!

2388
02:03:58,240 --> 02:03:58,940
Run!

2389
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,300
Run!

2390
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,400
Run!

2391
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:08,460
Run!

2392
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:12,220
Run, you fucker!

2393
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:14,740
Run!

2394
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,940
I don't wanna run.

2395
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:25,220
You coward.

2396
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,440
Oh my god.

2397
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:32,100
Dante, why did you run that way?

2398
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:33,700
Get out.

2399
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:34,800
Get out.

2400
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,400
It's hilarious.

2401
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:42,540
We're two ahead.

2402
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:43,220
This is good.

2403
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:49,820
I didn't cheese because it didn't work.

2404
02:04:50,020 --> 02:04:52,220
Is it really cheesing if it didn't work?

2405
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:53,540
Chat, is it really?

2406
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:55,380
Is it really cheesing?

2407
02:04:58,880 --> 02:04:59,960
Oh my god.

2408
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:10,660
Oh my god.

2409
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:12,700
This is so hard.

2410
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:14,920
Oh my god.

2411
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:18,000
Baseball is fucking serious business, chat.

2412
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:22,840
Baseball is so fucking serious.

2413
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:23,960
Come

2414
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:27,890
on!

2415
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:31,590
That was so fast.

2416
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:39,220
What?

2417
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:40,400
How did I not hit?

2418
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,340
How did I not hit?

2419
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:43,760
That was a hit.

2420
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:45,980
That was such a hit.

2421
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,420
Oh my god.

2422
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:57,880
Oh my god.

2423
02:05:57,880 --> 02:05:58,500
Okay, that's fine.

2424
02:05:58,600 --> 02:05:59,040
We'll do a square.

2425
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:00,740
We're gonna get squared.

2426
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:03,280
It has to be.

2427
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:04,420
It has to be a ball.

2428
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,940
That was literally outside the fucking square.

2429
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,020
Come on.

2430
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:15,120
That's it.

2431
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:17,000
That's another foul?

2432
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:19,900
Dante, please.

2433
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:22,880
Dante, you were able to hit every ball.

2434
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,940
Today will be the first time you miss.

2435
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:27,760
Oh!

2436
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,120
Dante!

2437
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:31,860
Dante!

2438
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:36,540
Pablo, I don't...

2439
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:37,980
I have zero hope for you, Pablo.

2440
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,880
Pablo, I don't even...

2441
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:42,540
Pablo, I...

2442
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:44,220
I just have zero hope for you.

2443
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,600
I don't know what the fuck you're gonna be doing today.

2444
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,560
I don't know.

2445
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:52,480
Oh, that was...

2446
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:55,540
Bro, I can't even tell that was a strike.

2447
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:59,320
Pablo is a sellout.

2448
02:07:02,260 --> 02:07:04,400
Oh, come on.

2449
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:07,820
Pablo, it was paid off.

2450
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:09,540
I was lied to.

2451
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:11,160
Everyone was like, Pablo's clutch.

2452
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:14,060
Pablo's so fucking clutch.

2453
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:15,620
Pablo...

2454
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:16,940
Pablo, please.

2455
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:18,340
Oh, Pablo!

2456
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,140
Oh my god, Pablo, no, no, no!

2457
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:23,080
Oh, fucking life!

2458
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,100
That was the worst hit ever, but for the first time in your life...

2459
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:32,660
That was the worst hit I ever saw, but that's fine.

2460
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:41,520
That was literally the worst hit I've ever saw in my life.

2461
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:45,540
But that's fine.

2462
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:54,480
Oh my god, Ashley, please.

2463
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:55,900
You're so slow, Ashley.

2464
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:58,420
No, it's okay, but Pablo got here.

2465
02:07:58,980 --> 02:08:00,140
Pablo got there.

2466
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:00,800
It's fine.

2467
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:04,340
You sacrificed yourself for Pablo, Ashley.

2468
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:11,960
Alright.

2469
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,220
I'm gonna do a line drive.

2470
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:18,320
I'm gonna do a line drive, and I'm gonna close right here.

2471
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:20,980
Now, that is...

2472
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:23,580
That had to be a ball.

2473
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:24,820
That was, like, way too low.

2474
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:27,940
Power?

2475
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:30,200
Okay, I'm gonna do power!

2476
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:34,200
Oh!

2477
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:34,680
Oh!

2478
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:35,420
Wait!

2479
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:38,880
Oh my god, you're so slow!

2480
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:39,660
Please!

2481
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:41,020
You got this!

2482
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:42,500
Josinda, please!

2483
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:44,080
Josinda!

2484
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:47,100
Josinda!

2485
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,460
Holy shit!

2486
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,440
I should've just made him run to boom.

2487
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:52,780
I should've just...

2488
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:54,880
Angela, this is it, Angela!

2489
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:56,900
You never...

2490
02:08:58,660 --> 02:08:59,900
She's so slow.

2491
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:03,180
She's actually so fucking slow.

2492
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,500
Holy shit, watching Josinda.

2493
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,820
Oh my god.

2494
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:11,440
Oh my god, that has to be a foul.

2495
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:16,600
Okay.

2496
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:19,000
Angela, please, please.

2497
02:09:19,140 --> 02:09:20,720
We need you to get us up one point.

2498
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:21,820
That's all I want.

2499
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:24,540
Angela!

2500
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:25,600
Angela, go!

2501
02:09:39,890 --> 02:09:41,350
Oh my god, Josinda!

2502
02:09:42,050 --> 02:09:44,530
It's been 20 years, we're not getting it!

2503
02:09:44,590 --> 02:09:45,690
Josinda, please!

2504
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:48,110
Why are you so slow?

2505
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:51,730
Oh my god.

2506
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:52,930
Why is...

2507
02:09:53,690 --> 02:09:55,590
Josinda so slow?

2508
02:09:56,930 --> 02:10:00,710
How is she...

2509
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:02,410
like this?

2510
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:04,510
How is she like this?

2511
02:10:05,610 --> 02:10:07,910
Pablo almost made it.

2512
02:10:08,250 --> 02:10:10,690
I didn't realize he wasn't running!

2513
02:10:11,150 --> 02:10:12,830
I thought he would run!

2514
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:12,950
He didn't!

2515
02:10:13,190 --> 02:10:15,150
He didn't run!

2516
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:17,470
Time out!

2517
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:18,590
Time out!

2518
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:20,850
Angela, get back in here.

2519
02:10:22,550 --> 02:10:24,110
Angela, get back in there.

2520
02:10:24,490 --> 02:10:26,870
Get back in there.

2521
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:34,390
Oh my god.

2522
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:38,610
Oh my god.

2523
02:10:38,890 --> 02:10:41,030
Why did he stand there?

2524
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:43,330
Why did he stand there?

2525
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:47,170
Sometimes they auto-run, but he didn't!

2526
02:10:47,290 --> 02:10:49,430
He didn't auto-run!

2527
02:10:50,230 --> 02:10:52,570
He didn't automatic run!

2528
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:55,270
I don't understand!

2529
02:10:57,050 --> 02:10:58,190
Let's go!

2530
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:02,010
Go, Angela, you're my only hope in this fucking world!

2531
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:12,420
He doesn't understand English.

2532
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:12,920
I'm just joking.

2533
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:16,180
I'm desperate.

2534
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:18,020
I'm so desperate.

2535
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:20,220
Oh, that's right!

2536
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:21,820
Get your ass out here!

2537
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:23,660
Alright, get Kenny back in.

2538
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:25,640
Okay, alright.

2539
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:27,700
Okay.

2540
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:32,220
Okay, alright.

2541
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:35,060
Alright, get back Kenny in there.

2542
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:35,960
I got what I needed.

2543
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:36,840
I got...

2544
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:40,140
I got what I needed.

2545
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:41,940
Get him back in here.

2546
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:44,100
Alright, Kenny.

2547
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:45,840
Now it's your turn.

2548
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:51,140
Get out!

2549
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:52,100
Child!

2550
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:53,740
Get out!

2551
02:11:57,720 --> 02:11:59,240
Oh my god.

2552
02:12:03,820 --> 02:12:04,940
That's a ball!

2553
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:06,400
Kenny, stop doing a ball!

2554
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:07,880
Kenny!

2555
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:11,360
I need you to stop doing balls!

2556
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:13,640
Oh my god, Kenny!

2557
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:15,560
Oh, Kenny!

2558
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:18,480
Kenny!

2559
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:26,550
Kenny!

2560
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:28,050
Kenny!

2561
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:29,510
Why?

2562
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:34,650
Kenny, I swapped you out one time!

2563
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:41,790
No way!

2564
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:44,530
No fucking way!

2565
02:12:45,110 --> 02:12:45,450
Kenny!

2566
02:12:45,790 --> 02:12:47,210
Kenny, please!

2567
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:54,730
Oh my god.

2568
02:12:55,410 --> 02:12:56,790
There's no way.

2569
02:12:57,430 --> 02:13:00,410
Oh my god, that's why he's not the ace.

2570
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:00,910
Kenny!

2571
02:13:03,010 --> 02:13:04,530
Oh my god.

2572
02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:06,170
If I could...

2573
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:09,570
If I could, I would fucking bring Angela back.

2574
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:12,010
I would fucking bring Angela back.

2575
02:13:15,790 --> 02:13:19,430
Oh my god, I would bring her back if I could, chat.

2576
02:13:22,710 --> 02:13:28,650
She refuses to get back in the field because for some reason her arm is tired.

2577
02:13:29,730 --> 02:13:32,570
She doesn't know this is life or death right now.

2578
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:38,090
She doesn't fucking know right now that it's life or death, that this is money on the line.

2579
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:40,010
Like...

2580
02:13:42,110 --> 02:13:43,050
There's no way.

2581
02:13:43,150 --> 02:13:43,890
Oh, thank god.

2582
02:13:43,970 --> 02:13:45,130
At least you did something.

2583
02:13:45,790 --> 02:13:47,850
At least you fucking did something.

2584
02:13:48,670 --> 02:13:50,430
Kenny, I'm so proud of you.

2585
02:13:51,670 --> 02:13:53,190
Well, I should thank you for the super chat.

2586
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:54,030
Thank you, thank you.

2587
02:13:54,130 --> 02:13:57,950
I'm with the Chicago White Sox after setting the record for most losses ever.

2588
02:13:58,430 --> 02:13:59,890
No one wants to be our next manager.

2589
02:14:00,110 --> 02:14:00,750
Would you be...

2590
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:03,450
What are you trying to say?

2591
02:14:03,670 --> 02:14:05,450
What are you trying to say, Washer?

2592
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:07,690
I am in the lead right now.

2593
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:09,770
I'm gonna win my first game.

2594
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:11,470
This is it.

2595
02:14:12,330 --> 02:14:12,950
Come on.

2596
02:14:13,070 --> 02:14:14,310
Come on, get this court through.

2597
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:14,790
Yes!

2598
02:14:15,670 --> 02:14:16,110
Yes!

2599
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:17,910
Thank you for the super chat, Washer.

2600
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:18,450
Thank you.

2601
02:14:18,710 --> 02:14:19,070
Thank you.

2602
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:22,610
Alright.

2603
02:14:22,610 --> 02:14:23,630
Alright.

2604
02:14:24,910 --> 02:14:26,070
Alright, this is it.

2605
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:27,750
This is it.

2606
02:14:29,530 --> 02:14:30,170
Oh my god.

2607
02:14:31,390 --> 02:14:31,970
One...

2608
02:14:32,420 --> 02:14:33,610
One more round.

2609
02:14:34,310 --> 02:14:35,930
One more round.

2610
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:38,110
Oh my god, it's Achmed.

2611
02:14:38,330 --> 02:14:40,390
I need to pause myself real quick.

2612
02:14:40,450 --> 02:14:40,710
Okay.

2613
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:42,690
Okay, Achmed.

2614
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:44,710
Achmed, please.

2615
02:14:44,950 --> 02:14:48,270
You're 0- You're 0-2 right now.

2616
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:50,430
Come on.

2617
02:14:52,610 --> 02:14:53,690
Okay, ball.

2618
02:14:58,190 --> 02:15:00,150
Come on, Achmed.

2619
02:15:00,850 --> 02:15:03,190
This is your one time in your entire life.

2620
02:15:04,190 --> 02:15:04,830
This is...

2621
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:05,770
Ach- Oh!

2622
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:09,710
Oh my god!

2623
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:10,570
Achmed!

2624
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:15,590
Oh, you mad lad!

2625
02:15:16,090 --> 02:15:18,110
Oh my god, Achmed!

2626
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:20,970
She dropped the fumble!

2627
02:15:20,970 --> 02:15:21,070
Fumble!

2628
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:28,980
Holy shit!

2629
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:30,960
The fucking fumble!

2630
02:15:40,910 --> 02:15:41,810
Another fumble!

2631
02:15:42,190 --> 02:15:42,690
Okay.

2632
02:15:43,230 --> 02:15:44,070
It's fine.

2633
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:45,050
It's fine.

2634
02:15:45,090 --> 02:15:46,070
We got another fumble.

2635
02:15:46,190 --> 02:15:46,810
That's fine.

2636
02:15:47,410 --> 02:15:48,690
That's fine.

2637
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:51,170
We got double fumbles.

2638
02:15:55,010 --> 02:15:56,070
Okay, Achmed.

2639
02:15:56,230 --> 02:15:56,790
That's good.

2640
02:15:57,390 --> 02:15:57,810
That's good.

2641
02:15:57,890 --> 02:15:58,910
We got double fumbles.

2642
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:03,030
Oh, come on.

2643
02:16:03,130 --> 02:16:04,190
Come on, Pete!

2644
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:05,870
Pete, come on!

2645
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:09,210
Come on, Pete.

2646
02:16:09,310 --> 02:16:09,770
Come on.

2647
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:10,690
Come on.

2648
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:14,010
Oh, Pete.

2649
02:16:14,350 --> 02:16:14,650
Please.

2650
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:15,350
Please.

2651
02:16:15,410 --> 02:16:16,170
You're so fast.

2652
02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:17,590
You're so fast.

2653
02:16:17,990 --> 02:16:18,950
Oh my god.

2654
02:16:19,370 --> 02:16:19,630
Nice.

2655
02:16:20,370 --> 02:16:21,210
Oh god, nice.

2656
02:16:21,590 --> 02:16:22,410
Oh, thank god.

2657
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:26,590
Oh my- Kenny, I swear.

2658
02:16:26,910 --> 02:16:27,730
Kenny, you're 0-3.

2659
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:28,530
Kenny.

2660
02:16:29,070 --> 02:16:30,610
Kenny, you're 0-3, Kenny.

2661
02:16:31,170 --> 02:16:33,530
Kenny, you're fucking 0-3, Kenny.

2662
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:36,770
I- Kenny, I need you to lock it in, Kenny.

2663
02:16:39,190 --> 02:16:39,790
Oh my god.

2664
02:16:39,830 --> 02:16:40,310
Kenny, please.

2665
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:40,990
Please.

2666
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:42,830
I need you to lock in.

2667
02:16:43,170 --> 02:16:47,430
Like, I- I need you to lock in, Kenny, for the love of god.

2668
02:16:49,090 --> 02:16:49,570
That has to be a ball.

2669
02:16:49,650 --> 02:16:50,270
That has to be a ball.

2670
02:16:50,830 --> 02:16:51,410
That has to be a ball.

2671
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:51,650
Okay.

2672
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:53,930
Come on.

2673
02:16:54,610 --> 02:16:54,970
Kenny.

2674
02:16:55,290 --> 02:16:56,650
Kenny, you have the wheels.

2675
02:16:57,010 --> 02:16:58,430
You literally have wheels, Kenny.

2676
02:16:59,550 --> 02:16:59,890
Like.

2677
02:17:01,490 --> 02:17:02,110
Oh god.

2678
02:17:02,270 --> 02:17:03,310
No, don't catch the ball.

2679
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:05,170
No, kennyyyyyyyyy!

2680
02:17:11,890 --> 02:17:12,570
KENNNYYYYYYYYYYYY!

2681
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:15,990
I- I- Kenny.

2682
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:17,270
I- Kenny.

2683
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:22,750
I- They auto-run!

2684
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:24,530
They auto-run!

2685
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:26,610
I couldn't stop them!

2686
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:32,070
I couldn't stop them I actually couldn't.

2687
02:17:32,110 --> 02:17:33,490
Oh my god, get out.

2688
02:17:33,650 --> 02:17:36,290
Kenny, I need you to get out of my fucking game right now.

2689
02:17:36,630 --> 02:17:38,610
I couldn't stop them from running.

2690
02:17:38,970 --> 02:17:40,090
I swear to God.

2691
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:45,050
Oh my god, there's no way.

2692
02:17:45,570 --> 02:17:46,910
There's no way.

2693
02:17:47,010 --> 02:17:47,830
Get juiced up.

2694
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:49,970
Get juiced up, Angela.

2695
02:17:50,350 --> 02:17:53,010
We need you to be so fucking juiced.

2696
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:00,330
No, Dante, please.

2697
02:18:02,810 --> 02:18:03,690
Come on.

2698
02:18:04,490 --> 02:18:04,970
Run.

2699
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:06,330
Come on.

2700
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:12,360
Get out.

2701
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:13,260
Get out.

2702
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:14,560
Yeah, I'm desperate.

2703
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:16,440
I need my win for the children.

2704
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:18,640
Kenny's a fucking win trader.

2705
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:19,700
I swear to God.

2706
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:20,800
I won't even be surprised.

2707
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:24,200
I won't even be surprised if he's a win trader.

2708
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:26,200
Guys, my children need to win.

2709
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:27,680
I don't care if I'm cheesing it.

2710
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:35,020
Guys, my children... after everything Angela's been through, you cannot... you cannot say I'm cheesing.

2711
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:36,880
Angela has been through so much.

2712
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:40,040
She has tried her fucking ass to carry the team.

2713
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:42,380
Angela has been through so fucking much.

2714
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:43,440
She deserves this.

2715
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:45,780
She deserves this fucking win.

2716
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:46,980
Get out.

2717
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:47,940
Get out.

2718
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:58,260
She gave her arm for this fucking team, chat.

2719
02:19:02,020 --> 02:19:03,960
Are you fucking serious?

2720
02:19:04,180 --> 02:19:04,980
Kenny, please.

2721
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:13,240
And yeah, you want to run.

2722
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:14,820
Don't you want to run?

2723
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:17,700
Don't you want to run?

2724
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:20,800
Don't you want to run?

2725
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:21,280
Run.

2726
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:22,760
Run right now.

2727
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:25,720
Run your fucking ass right now.

2728
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:30,400
Run.

2729
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:32,640
You know you want to run.

2730
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:33,560
Come on.

2731
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:37,320
Come on.

2732
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:38,380
Run.

2733
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:43,580
I need this out.

2734
02:19:44,420 --> 02:19:45,360
Come on.

2735
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:47,320
Oh, he's gonna have the ball now too.

2736
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:48,440
You know you want to run.

2737
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:51,480
Come on.

2738
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:52,940
Come on.

2739
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:54,020
You know you want to run.

2740
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:54,600
Come on.

2741
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:57,840
Come on.

2742
02:19:57,880 --> 02:19:59,280
Where is he gonna throw it?

2743
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:02,740
He's gonna flinch.

2744
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:04,720
I believe in him flinching.

2745
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:06,440
He's gonna flinch right now.

2746
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:08,860
He's gonna... He does.

2747
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:10,700
Come on.

2748
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:12,600
Run, you fool.

2749
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:14,090
God damn it.

2750
02:20:19,130 --> 02:20:21,290
God fucking damn it.

2751
02:20:21,670 --> 02:20:23,130
He refuses to run.

2752
02:20:23,210 --> 02:20:24,070
What do I do?

2753
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:26,410
He fucking refuses to run.

2754
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:27,630
Are you serious?

2755
02:20:28,150 --> 02:20:28,930
What?

2756
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:04,970
How is this?

2757
02:21:05,330 --> 02:21:07,030
What is this character rank?

2758
02:21:11,070 --> 02:21:13,630
A friend has to help untangle the pitcher's arm.

2759
02:21:14,050 --> 02:21:15,190
How is that allowed?

2760
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:20,950
I don't understand.

2761
02:21:22,310 --> 02:21:23,770
How is that allowed?

2762
02:21:23,970 --> 02:21:25,430
How is she allowed to do that?

2763
02:21:28,310 --> 02:21:29,970
There's no way.

2764
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:33,570
Angela, Angela, this is... Angela, please.

2765
02:21:34,230 --> 02:21:35,410
Yes, Angela!

2766
02:21:36,210 --> 02:21:37,490
Let's go!

2767
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:42,830
After everything we've been through.

2768
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,650
Angela, we did it.

2769
02:21:46,070 --> 02:21:46,310
Angela.

2770
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:49,670
Angela, let's fucking go.

2771
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:51,430
I knew it.

2772
02:21:51,750 --> 02:21:53,050
I knew it.

2773
02:21:53,230 --> 02:21:55,710
Whoever that was that told me to get Angela.

2774
02:21:56,090 --> 02:21:56,830
What is your name?

2775
02:21:57,130 --> 02:21:57,530
Bombatti?

2776
02:21:57,970 --> 02:22:02,690
Bombatti, your pick was the clutchest pick I've ever seen.

2777
02:22:02,830 --> 02:22:03,450
Bombatti.

2778
02:22:03,850 --> 02:22:05,010
You know Bombatti.

2779
02:22:05,010 --> 02:22:06,030
You know what, Bombatti?

2780
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:07,070
You're getting mod.

2781
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:07,810
Where are you?

2782
02:22:07,890 --> 02:22:09,110
I'm fucking modding you.

2783
02:22:13,410 --> 02:22:16,990
Bombatti fucking gave me... Who the fuck told me Pablo?

2784
02:22:17,470 --> 02:22:21,230
Whoever told me Pablo, if I remember your name, I'm fucking timing you out.

2785
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:26,990
Oh my god.

2786
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:29,370
You got promoted, Bombatti.

2787
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:30,470
Happy birthday.

2788
02:22:30,610 --> 02:22:34,250
Angela was the most clutchest pick I've ever had.

2789
02:22:34,250 --> 02:22:36,010
I can't believe it.

2790
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:37,270
You're mod for a day.

2791
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:38,950
I'll give you mod for a day.

2792
02:22:39,050 --> 02:22:41,510
You'll go be fucking happy birthday.

2793
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:44,190
You get to be mod for a fucking day.

2794
02:22:45,970 --> 02:22:46,970
Where is he?

2795
02:22:47,270 --> 02:22:48,210
Get him up here.

2796
02:22:48,490 --> 02:22:49,710
Where are you, Bombatti?

2797
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:51,390
Angela has been the most...

2798
02:22:51,390 --> 02:22:51,910
Okay, look.

2799
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:53,390
Wombats was literally the best team.

2800
02:22:53,470 --> 02:22:54,670
They won another game chat.

2801
02:22:55,170 --> 02:22:59,130
Wombats was literally the best team in this entire run.

2802
02:23:01,970 --> 02:23:03,870
Oh my god.

2803
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:05,550
Holy shit.

2804
02:23:05,650 --> 02:23:06,190
I'm done.

2805
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:08,170
I'm too stressed out.

2806
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:11,090
My god.

2807
02:23:12,450 --> 02:23:14,730
I'm way too stressed out right now.

2808
02:23:15,390 --> 02:23:17,470
Oh, happy birthday, Bombatti.

2809
02:23:17,590 --> 02:23:18,710
You get to be...

2810
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:20,590
You get to be mod for a day.

2811
02:23:21,690 --> 02:23:22,270
Congratulations.

2812
02:23:23,450 --> 02:23:25,970
I'm gonna remember to take mod for a day.

2813
02:23:26,450 --> 02:23:27,530
Congratulations, Bombatti.

2814
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:31,090
You gave me the best pick of my life there.

2815
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:33,230
Holy shit.

2816
02:23:34,010 --> 02:23:35,410
That was so... I'm done.

2817
02:23:35,810 --> 02:23:36,770
I won my game.

2818
02:23:36,910 --> 02:23:38,530
That was my character arc right there.

2819
02:23:38,650 --> 02:23:39,150
Oh my god.

2820
02:23:39,170 --> 02:23:40,270
We have another stream anyway.

2821
02:23:42,590 --> 02:23:43,670
Holy shit.

2822
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:45,890
That was my character arc for the day.

2823
02:23:45,890 --> 02:23:48,710
Oh my god, Angela.

2824
02:23:49,230 --> 02:23:52,650
Thank god, Angela did it.

2825
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:54,130
Oh my god.

2826
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:57,390
Oh my god, my goat.

2827
02:23:57,710 --> 02:23:59,990
Angela, my fucking goat.

2828
02:24:00,490 --> 02:24:05,290
You literally had the entire team on your back and brought us to the finish line.

2829
02:24:05,490 --> 02:24:07,390
I'm so proud of my girl.

2830
02:24:07,630 --> 02:24:09,250
I'm so proud of her.

2831
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:13,870
Oh my god.

2832
02:24:14,930 --> 02:24:17,770
If it wasn't for her, I don't know what I'll do.

2833
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:21,830
Holy shit.

2834
02:24:22,510 --> 02:24:23,510
She was a hero.

2835
02:24:23,910 --> 02:24:26,970
She was actually a hero throughout that run.

2836
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:31,310
That was so intense.

2837
02:24:31,430 --> 02:24:35,790
My adrenaline is pumping so hard from those games, guys.

2838
02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:43,550
Like, actually, I've never felt so much adrenaline right now from those two games.

2839
02:24:44,070 --> 02:24:45,350
I don't know about you guys.

2840
02:24:45,430 --> 02:24:52,390
I don't know if your adrenaline is like so fucking high from those two games, but that was intense.

2841
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:55,430
That fucking crazy bunt in the end.

2842
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:58,490
This was the most hype I've seen you all.

2843
02:24:58,490 --> 02:25:00,870
Bro, it was so intense.

2844
02:25:01,070 --> 02:25:05,470
It was so intense and everything, guys.

2845
02:25:06,010 --> 02:25:07,190
Like, oh my god.

2846
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:08,090
That was so fun.

2847
02:25:08,230 --> 02:25:12,250
I had a lot of fun playing chat, and I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching today.

2848
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:20,490
We do have a Goodnight Dragoon stream in two hours, so I'm saving most of my yapping over there, but I hope you guys had a great time watching me today.

2849
02:25:20,890 --> 02:25:27,370
I'm gonna be showing a lot of like sneak peeks for future projects tomorrow in the... not tomorrow, today.

2850
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:34,790
Tonight in the Goodnight Dragoons, so stick around for the Goodnight Dragoon stream to see what I'm... what's been cooking and behind the scenes.

2851
02:25:35,050 --> 02:25:37,810
Anyway, guys, I'm gonna rest now.

2852
02:25:37,990 --> 02:25:39,030
I need to calm down.

2853
02:25:39,170 --> 02:25:39,510
I need...

2854
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:41,170
I need to fucking calm down.

2855
02:25:41,330 --> 02:25:42,410
That was so fun, though.

2856
02:25:42,870 --> 02:25:43,810
I... oh my god.

2857
02:25:43,850 --> 02:25:45,310
The fucking batting was...

2858
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:46,130
oh my god.

2859
02:25:46,830 --> 02:25:49,550
What is that fucking projectile speed?

2860
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:52,710
What is the... what do you mean I don't hit it?

2861
02:25:52,710 --> 02:25:53,050
Why?

2862
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:57,230
Pablo, I thought you were the chosen one.

2863
02:25:57,410 --> 02:26:00,990
I thought baseball was in your fucking blood, but you know who carried?

2864
02:26:01,330 --> 02:26:02,370
Goddamn Angela.

2865
02:26:02,650 --> 02:26:04,070
God, Angela got like doubles.

2866
02:26:04,510 --> 02:26:08,870
She got... she didn't get a hard one, but at least she didn't get a fucking weak-ass hit.

2867
02:26:10,990 --> 02:26:12,150
And also Kenny.

2868
02:26:12,430 --> 02:26:18,950
Kenny and Pablo, my two star... my two supposed star players, ended up throwing so hard.

2869
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:27,870
