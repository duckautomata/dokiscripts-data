1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:11,040
There was one more game, like solo exhibition that we had to play and he just wasn't there.

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,900
Oh my god!

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,760
Okay, that's pretty funny.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:27,680
We were in the spot to win the whole tournament, the entire tournament, but we got crypto ulted, altar pushed into a building and died like in three seconds.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,940
It was the weirdest shit ever.

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,480
We died in literally like two milliseconds.

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,580
Crypto ult, altar kill, boom.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,800
And then he just left.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,180
He just... like he even went offline on Discord.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,820
He didn't even say bye.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,720
I just saw him disappear on Fugi.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,280
I just saw his icon disappear.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,340
Okay, that's pretty funny.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,240
That's pretty funny.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,160
Oh my god.

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,720
That's why he's my idol.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,440
He's the funny.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,180
He's toxic like you.

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,880
Yeah, yeah, he's my hero.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,940
Why can't you be more like Zero?

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,700
I invented toxicity in Apex, to be honest.

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,860
Sure.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,840
Like back in my day when I was competing, I used to flame pros.

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,340
Back in my day.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,560
Okay, grandpa.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,820
It's been two years.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,400
Okay, grandpa.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,580
That's like what?

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,320
20 years in internet?

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,440
Internet?

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:26,780
Dude.

32
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,640
One month is one year in internet.

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,120
Didn't Zero win two years ago?

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
It's been two years since I competed.

35
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,480
Yeah, wasn't Zero also like better than...

36
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,120
What are you trying to say?

37
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,220
Nothing.

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,520
But that doesn't matter.

39
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,120
I invented toxicity in Apex Legends.

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,160
You invented toxicity in Apex Legends?

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,760
Yeah, I remember the day it happened.

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,800
When we got contested by six Russian teams in Overlook.

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,520
Yeah, what did you do?

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,600
That was a dark day.

45
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,480
What did you say?

46
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,520
We won every single contest and teabagged the fuck out of everyone.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,320
And kept fucking...

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,940
Kept being toxic until they left.

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,060
Damn.

50
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,160
Do we have to put the delay on for our team?

51
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,820
No.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,380
No.

53
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,720
What the fuck?

54
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,040
We're not nerds.

55
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,740
Even if he says we have to, I'm not doing it.

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,160
Yeah, we're not nerds.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,760
We're not nerds.

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:26,980
Okay.

59
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm not doing anything like this.

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,300
We don't need to put TSM in front of our names.

61
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,440
They know who we are.

62
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,020
They know we're TSM.

63
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,340
Team... team... slightly Minhera.

64
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,160
Only slightly.

65
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,140
Only slightly.

66
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,460
Locked and ready.

68
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,600
Locked and ready.

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,140
We're so locked in.

70
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,300
Guys, fucking ready up.

71
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,900
Ready up.

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,920
Just start.

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,480
No, shit.

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:54,760
My bad.

75
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,800
Yeah.

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,260
Hello, I'm here.

77
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,860
Yeah, yeah, Docu's here.

78
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,700
We can go.

79
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,920
Yeah, I'm here already.

80
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,600
Just start.

81
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,100
I should say that.

82
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,460
Just start.

83
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,000
Who cares about team five?

84
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,840
Oh my god.

85
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,980
Oh, he's starting.

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,080
Oh my god, he's starting.

87
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,400
Let's go!

88
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,760
No, we're not.

89
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,740
Oh, they're back.

90
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:28,740
Exactly.

91
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,320
They don't need that guy.

92
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,640
All right, here we go.

93
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,380
I mean, why should we wait for one person?

94
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,180
To be honest, you were three minutes late at the time as well.

95
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,420
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,080
I don't really feel like you get to talk...

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,360
This man, this man was late...

98
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,640
When I got in, there was like 15 people not even there yet.

99
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,460
You can't say that.

100
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,100
Yeah, but everyone who's late doesn't get to speak.

101
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,120
You also told him to start!

102
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,260
You said the same thing!

103
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,540
I was first in the lobby.

104
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,300
You said the same thing.

105
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,340
You told him to start and move out this man.

106
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,600
Yeah, but I get to speak because I joined on time.

107
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,740
Yeah, and I just repeated what you said.

108
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,920
No, I repeated what you said.

109
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,760
We're not fighting guys, we're just having a discussion.

110
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,320
Wait, wait, wait.

111
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,760
Take the character.

112
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm Bloodhound.

113
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,340
You play Catalyst.

114
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,720
I'm Bloodhound.

115
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,660
For your...

116
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,800
Dita, for your upgrade, just pick the wall upgrade two times.

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,740
What was my upgrade again?

118
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,580
I forgot.

119
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,140
Which one?

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,220
Left side or right side?

121
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,960
I think it's right side and left side, but I'm not sure.

122
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,080
Just read it.

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,980
Okay, I'm reading.

124
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,340
Doki, your upgrade is I think...

125
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,720
I think your upgrade is...

126
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,320
Your upgrades are...

127
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,520
Fuck, I think it's something with duration of scan.

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Oh, yeah, I remember.

129
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,500
The right one?

130
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,260
The right one.

131
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,340
The left one for me.

132
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,300
I'm left.

133
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,140
Alright, Dita, you're Jumpmaster.

134
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,320
No, no, no, no, peace.

135
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,080
No, no, no, no, not me.

136
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,140
I don't know where I'm going.

137
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm waiting, I'm waiting my flag.

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,900
In case Macnum...

139
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,120
Guys, guys, listen.

140
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,780
Yes, yes, Imperial RPR.

141
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,620
We're gonna scan every single beacon until we have purple armor.

142
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,520
This is the strata.

143
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,180
What about the armor thing?

144
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,880
And we're opening every single red bin for turbocharger.

145
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,480
Oh, we have...

146
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,060
Every single one.

147
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,440
We have scan.

148
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,300
Yeah, that's why we're landing here.

149
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,720
We're gonna scan people and then we're gonna scan...

150
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm gonna land in the far right.

151
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,460
Okay.

152
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,400
We're gonna scan people and we're gonna scan zone.

153
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,400
And we're gonna just fucking get purple armors.

154
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,640
No more blue armor bullshit.

155
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,040
Yeah.

156
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,340
I believe in us.

157
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,260
You sound so enthusiastic.

158
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,660
Yeah.

159
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,220
Wait, what placement did you end up?

160
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,440
Wait.

161
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,580
We got 10th in Mpex Medsec.

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,280
Wait.

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,800
Wait a minute.

164
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,180
There were people here.

165
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,940
Oh, we're gonna win.

166
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,840
Ah, murder them in cold blood.

167
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,280
Like hello.

168
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Wait, what the fuck?

169
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,840
Somebody...

170
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,120
What?

171
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,800
Who landed next to me?

172
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,120
Well, who do you think they are?

173
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,900
I wasn't even paying attention.

174
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,160
Oh, they're over here.

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,020
They landed there.

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,540
Oh, okay.

177
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:11,820
I'm sorry.

178
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,120
You saw objective.

179
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,220
I saw objective.

180
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,420
Okay.

181
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,280
I have a lot of ping today.

182
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,680
Yeah, what ping?

183
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,740
This server just went from 130 to 180 ping.

184
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,240
I don't know.

185
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,500
This is 84 ping to me.

186
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,760
This is East.

187
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,920
This is a new server.

188
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,740
This is supposed to be Dallas.

189
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,360
Is this Dallas?

190
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,660
I'm 84 ping.

191
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,420
Kuro said Dallas, but I think he's lying to me, and this is like an organizer trying to sabotage me.

192
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,140
Wow.

193
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,540
I think it's not Dallas.

194
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,880
I think it's just North America.

195
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,200
I don't know.

196
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,180
Dallas is NA.

197
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,520
Dallas is North America.

198
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,880
Scan the beacons.

199
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,800
Why do this?

200
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,180
We had both scans too!

201
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,500
What the heck?

202
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,060
We had both scans as well.

203
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,860
This is sabotage.

204
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,120
This is actually sabotage.

205
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,600
Scans are 100% spawn by the way.

206
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,300
Oh, okay.

207
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,740
This is not sabotage.

208
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,060
Dude, he's just being an asshole.

209
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,940
He's just being an asshole.

210
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,580
I think it's unfair because I have Havoc in Flatline.

211
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,220
I thought you had 3 hours!

212
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,740
Hurry up!

213
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,940
I have it in FET later!

214
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,420
Havoc in fucking Flatline.

215
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,760
And they restart.

216
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,520
I think this is targeted by the way.

217
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,180
Please.

218
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,540
Please.

219
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,940
Do they use the same server when we scrim?

220
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,600
I don't know.

221
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,820
Oh.

222
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,940
I'll just play like video game.

223
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,920
Wait, what placement did you guys end up getting for the JP tournament?

224
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,440
10.

225
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,680
We were like 5th last game but we were like if we won the game we would basically win.

226
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,040
That's why 0.

227
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,140
Altifor.

228
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
Yeah, and then we got...

229
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,620
Honestly, we got hit by the most toxic push I've ever seen in my life.

230
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,840
By which team?

231
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,220
Which team?

232
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,880
It was some JP team.

233
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,540
Call them out.

234
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,000
They crypto ulted us.

235
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,520
And then they alter-q'd behind us into the building and then Magibold us so we would double stun.

236
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,320
I couldn't even take out my Havoc.

237
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:33,920
I already died.

238
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,500
It was insane.

239
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,840
What the heck?

240
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,240
What haste that come?

241
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,240
Wait, wait.

242
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,200
What placement did they get though?

243
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
Probably worse than us to win this one.

244
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,580
What if they're higher?

245
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,940
What if they're actually higher?

246
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,300
We were owning solos.

247
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,360
We got 2nd, 2nd and 3rd in solos.

248
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,260
All of us were going crazy in solos.

249
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,500
Yeah, but then you ended up getting...

250
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,040
It doesn't matter how crazy you were.

251
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,600
You were still 10th place.

252
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,200
We don't have any!

253
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,320
You said 100% spawn rate!

254
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,400
You fucking liar!

255
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,580
Yeah, I lied.

256
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,000
So what?

257
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,680
What?

258
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,640
You said it was 100% spawn rate!

259
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,380
Quick, somebody crash right now.

260
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,160
Okay, you ult F4 right now.

261
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,960
Wait, why do I have to ult F4?

262
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,460
I don't even have F4 on my keyboard.

263
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,260
I use a Wooting.

264
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,800
Ult F4 then.

265
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Oh my god.

266
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,400
It's...

267
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
It's your idea.

268
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,640
You do it.

269
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,480
What do you want from me?

270
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,840
You clearly want to do it.

271
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,340
You clearly like the idea.

272
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,020
So you should do it because you're captain.

273
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,140
No, I'm not.

274
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm not going to embarrass my name with your ideas.

275
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,400
My idea?

276
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,800
It's our idea.

277
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,980
How are you going to...

278
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,240
No.

279
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,840
You're not doing this.

280
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,360
We had this idea together as a team.

281
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,820
You're not doing this today.

282
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm not lying.

283
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm not lying.

284
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,240
We have to figure out where we're hitting beacons now.

285
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,220
By the way, I'm reporting Kuro on LGS.

286
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,780
Never let Kuro organize.

287
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,380
He's getting fucking reported.

288
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,260
He fucked over our first game.

289
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,420
Never again.

290
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,380
Yeah, he's reported.

291
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,520
Bad for life.

292
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:20,880
Yeah, buddy.

293
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,340
Count your days, buddy.

294
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,040
You're done for.

295
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,520
You're done.

296
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,120
Ooh, gold backpack.

297
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,900
Never mind.

298
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,500
I don't have my guns anymore.

299
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,140
Can you open this?

300
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,580
Yeah.

301
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,920
Yeah, I will.

302
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,240
But we need to figure out what the fuck are we scanning.

303
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,220
I don't know.

304
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,500
I will go take...

305
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,980
Harvester.

306
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,900
Okay.

307
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
What about Harvester?

308
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,040
Oh, Evo?

309
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Yeah, Evo Harvester.

310
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,200
I have a white backpack.

311
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,900
We can scan and...

312
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,400
We can get poor.

313
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,760
The Chi or Geyser?

314
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,400
The Chi or Geyser.

315
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,540
Long Sight scanned us.

316
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,580
Okay.

317
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Long Sight better not scan us.

318
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,580
Because they're gonna get these hands.

319
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,280
What if they kill us?

320
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,700
Okay, whose team are you on?

321
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,440
I'm just talking about the possibilities.

322
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,400
You're like not bringing any confidence to the team at all.

323
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,620
I said what if, what are the plans?

324
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,100
If, you know, I look like a contingency player.

325
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,020
Like what's the plan if we die?

326
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,920
That's not, I didn't say we die.

327
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,180
What if they scan us?

328
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,040
You said what if they kill us.

329
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,200
No, I said scan.

330
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,500
Somebody is not paying attention.

331
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,740
Why is she lying now?

332
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,580
I think you are...

333
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,100
You just need to fix your ears.

334
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,360
I think I should change my VPN to North America.

335
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,240
Only North America.

336
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,560
It's better for me.

337
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,420
Yeah, you should.

338
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,140
Who the heck told me that last?

339
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,140
Yeah, yeah, RPR.

340
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,500
I think he's trying to sabotage us.

341
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,080
Oh, wait, wait, I'm in here.

342
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,280
I'm with RPR.

343
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,600
What the fuck are they doing there?

344
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,420
I'm with RPR.

345
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,240
I fell down.

346
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,380
What did he say?

347
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,700
Dallas?

348
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,280
Like he's trying to sabotage us.

349
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,940
Guys, how do I get back up?

350
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,360
Where are you?

351
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,980
Hurry up.

352
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,940
We gotta go do shit.

353
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm not even the furthest away from you.

354
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,700
Ditto is further than me.

355
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,120
Yeah, but she's closer to us.

356
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,800
She's closer to the gold than you.

357
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,340
Come on.

358
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,260
Where is... I don't even remember the gold.

359
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,320
Oh, okay.

360
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,560
Kill this guy.

361
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:31,980
I'm here.

362
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,160
I'm here.

363
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,300
Solo crack.

364
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:33,960
Solo crack.

365
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,580
One guy solo crack.

366
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,200
No, no, you're good.

367
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm with you.

368
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,420
We're here.

369
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:40,760
We're here.

370
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,700
Are they zipping?

371
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,760
He's 15 HP left.

372
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,760
Blue armor right here.

373
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,900
On this hill.

374
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,860
He has charge rifle.

375
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,580
I win.

376
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,340
Nah, I'd win.

377
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,980
Wait, but I don't see him.

378
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,580
Cracked.

379
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,000
40 flash.

380
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,400
40 flash.

381
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,900
I don't even have an angle for you guys.

382
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,420
One.

383
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,780
He's ghost tech.

384
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,020
I don't even have an angle.

385
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,860
I think they came from geyser, so that means the zone is probably on us, right?

386
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,140
Yeah, maybe.

387
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,880
I don't even see it.

388
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,040
Yeah, everyone's here and here.

389
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,920
Yeah, everyone is coming to our side.

390
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,400
Okay.

391
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,980
Oh, so we have the zone.

392
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,880
Yeah.

393
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,420
We don't get to scan for purple armor, man.

394
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,760
Fucking hell.

395
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,760
I hate how that goes.

396
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,340
Where should we go then, RPR?

397
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,100
Just here.

398
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,300
We have no other option now.

399
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,340
Yeah, but like, where do we play?

400
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,640
Oh my god.

401
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,720
I should have...

402
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,620
I would play these two houses.

403
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
I should have killed him.

404
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,580
This is our home now.

405
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,960
Oh, they're fighting here.

406
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,300
This team is getting beamed.

407
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,180
Flash!

408
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,260
Flash!

409
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,740
I'm going in!

410
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,740
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

411
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,420
We're coming over.

412
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,140
We're coming over.

413
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,360
Are we pushing?

414
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,500
I don't know.

415
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,420
Let's break the doors and try to poke.

416
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,240
Because these guys are flush.

417
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,720
What if they take our house?

418
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,040
Wait, wait, there's a guy here.

419
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,280
Yeah, yeah.

420
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,160
That guy here.

421
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,340
Behind the pillar.

422
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,100
He's cracked.

423
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,380
Careful.

424
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,820
I don't have much shield cells and batteries.

425
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,300
I have 16 cells.

426
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,100
Okay, goodbye, I guess.

427
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,920
Everybody's shooting at me, but I don't know where...

428
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,240
Let's get to the top of our building.

429
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,320
Oh, wait, there's a rampart.

430
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,720
On the floor of this building right here.

431
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,820
Alright, heading over.

432
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,500
That's a... yeah, that is a rampart.

433
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,300
Okay, let's actually go back to our original house.

434
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,560
I have one of my own house.

435
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay, yeah.

436
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,840
Oh, I see it!

437
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,140
I see it!

438
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,360
We might need to kill these guys.

439
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,800
Oh, this is a bad spot for me.

440
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,040
I might die.

441
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,020
What the... Oh, no.

442
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm good.

443
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,860
I'm feeling safe.

444
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,580
Okay.

445
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,020
Okay, we're gonna eventually have to kill that team because we want that spot.

446
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,600
To be honest.

447
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,380
Maybe...

448
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,300
We kill them now.

449
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,840
Dito, I wanna give you some cells.

450
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,300
I can scan in six.

451
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,160
Yeah, yeah.

452
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,780
Here, I'll give you cells here.

453
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,040
You want me to scan now or wait?

454
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,840
Yeah.

455
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,060
Scan as soon as you can.

456
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm gonna get a right side angle.

457
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,700
Oh, they left.

458
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
They went to the left building.

459
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:04,840
Okay.

460
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,740
I'm gonna take this building now.

461
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,840
And I'm gonna break their doors.

462
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,520
And then we just wanna bully them.

463
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,900
If we have nades, we wanna just throw them.

464
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Yeah, I have nades too.

465
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,100
I'm on high ground for this.

466
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,980
Let me mull the door.

467
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,820
Did you break it?

468
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,500
Yeah, I broke the left door.

469
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
I will try to...

470
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,620
They're over here.

471
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,920
Yeah, just play the scan.

472
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,320
Oh, I got...

473
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,400
They scanned me.

474
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,720
They know I'm alone here.

475
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,000
There's another team.

476
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:35,980
Oh, yeah.

477
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,700
I need help.

478
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,020
I need help.

479
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,660
I need help with this.

480
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,560
I'm trying to cover you.

481
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,580
I knocked one.

482
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,300
I knocked one.

483
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,460
Here?

484
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,900
Here, here, here.

485
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,520
I knocked one.

486
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,480
I cracked one.

487
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,180
I cracked the other here.

488
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,820
We need to focus on behind.

489
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,780
We need to focus on behind.

490
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,840
Yeah, crack the other.

491
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,100
Crack the other.

492
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,420
We can't let this team get close.

493
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
I'm gonna run out of... heavy ammo.

494
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,940
I'm gonna look in front of us.

495
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,700
I'm looking in front of us.

496
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,520
I'm looking in front of us.

497
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,480
I'm letting Bloodhounds scan behind.

498
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,460
I think they can lay.

499
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,040
Yeah.

500
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,580
Yeah, they rez.

501
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:04,880
They rez.

502
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,300
That's fine.

503
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,440
They're running all the way back there.

504
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,240
Back to the car.

505
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,440
There's the last guy.

506
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,380
I'm gonna see if there's heavy...

507
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,600
I'm gonna find heavy ammo.

508
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,320
I need heavy ammo.

509
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,060
I need heavy ammo.

510
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,840
Yeah, I'm looking for ammo right now.

511
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,260
We're going out to get ammo from them, guys.

512
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,080
We don't have another option.

513
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,820
Okay, okay, okay.

514
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
I will throw my nade.

515
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,760
Yeah, yeah.

516
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,320
Throw a nade.

517
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,880
They have blue armors.

518
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,220
This is good for us to get purple.

519
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,820
They have lifeline, though.

520
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,340
They have lifeline, though, which is...

521
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,760
Oh, I can't go.

522
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,600
I can't go.

523
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:32,760
I'm here.

524
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,880
Almost killed Bangalore.

525
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm still selling.

526
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,840
If we're gonna fully commit, I can now.

527
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,380
If we're gonna fully commit, I can now.

528
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,020
Yeah, I'm ready.

529
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,820
Wait, wait.

530
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,580
Nighty's pushing them.

531
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,400
Nighty's pushing them.

532
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,460
I'm smoking in there, so smoke when you can.

533
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,040
I'm smoking in there, so smoke when you can.

534
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,920
I'm looking behind.

535
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,300
Oh, yeah.

536
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,960
They're getting red pushed.

537
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,600
They're getting red pushed.

538
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,380
Revenant cracked.

539
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,760
One of them got knocked inside.

540
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,200
Flash, flash, flash.

541
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,700
Are we going?

542
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,500
Yeah, look to third party.

543
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,640
Okay, I'm scanning.

544
00:16:59,780 --> 00:16:59,920
I'm scanning.

545
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,640
Holy shit.

546
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:01,960
What the fuck am I watching?

547
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,180
No knocks.

548
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,560
No knocks.

549
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,000
No knocks.

550
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,340
There's no knocks.

551
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,080
They have lifeline res.

552
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,240
So just stay close.

553
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,940
Stay close here.

554
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,300
And wait for them to fight.

555
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, yeah.

556
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,660
Okay.

557
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,940
We need the skills because we need ammo.

558
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,500
There's so much light, though.

559
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm gonna look behind us.

560
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,340
There's a team that redeployed behind us.

561
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,980
Yeah, right behind us.

562
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm trying to get them off our backs.

563
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,580
Yeah, we might need to kill those guys.

564
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,180
Fucking hell.

565
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,960
Maybe I have to change my phone.

566
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,080
Yeah.

567
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,660
Oh, this team is peeking.

568
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,640
This team is peeking at the wall here.

569
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,640
Okay, okay.

570
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,160
Who the fuck are you guys?

571
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,880
It is...

572
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,560
I got a Phoenix hit.

573
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,880
There's no team in the house.

574
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,340
Is that from the house?

575
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,380
There's nobody in the house.

576
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,100
Yeah, I scanned it.

577
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,880
Okay, okay.

578
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,000
We got the boat houses then.

579
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
But we didn't get any fucking ammo, though.

580
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,000
But there's people on the bridge now.

581
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,640
There's people on the bridge.

582
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,480
These guys run here.

583
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,620
Okay.

584
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay, I got this house now.

585
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
Watch behind us because that team behind us is like the biggest problem for us.

586
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,300
I might just swap...

587
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,780
I'm gonna swap my gun and go...

588
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,620
I'm gonna swap both short range.

589
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,740
Because I see so much R9 here.

590
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,700
I'm gonna give you my heavy.

591
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,200
Okay.

592
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,240
I just see like all light ammo.

593
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,120
These guys are getting railed here.

594
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,340
But they got a package.

595
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,600
Lifeline package.

596
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,720
Okay.

597
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,200
Nobody's behind us.

598
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,260
Okay.

599
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,980
People crossed the bridge.

600
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,540
We were going this way and this way.

601
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,400
Everyone's going that way and they're all fighting there.

602
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,200
I kinda wanna like do something to them.

603
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,520
I have only one bat and two cells.

604
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,620
I have only one bat and two cells.

605
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,520
I have two bats and six cells.

606
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,580
I have one bat and six.

607
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,120
I have one bat and six.

608
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,230
If they fight on the right side there...

609
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,950
I kinda even wanna...

610
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,610
Look at them on the bridge.

611
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,230
They're gonna try and come over here.

612
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:56,430
Okay.

613
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,750
They're getting beamed.

614
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,290
Walking down there.

615
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,350
They're going up.

616
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,450
Can you hear her?

617
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:07,970
On my ping?

618
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,530
Almost K.

619
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,070
They're heavily split.

620
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,110
Oh she's not alone.

621
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,210
I'm getting shot from...

622
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,490
I'm getting shot from my back from the building.

623
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,870
One guy's so low.

624
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,230
I'm getting shot from behind.

625
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,110
We might have to go back to the building.

626
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,570
I have no heavy ammo.

627
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,450
They're so far.

628
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,230
They might have more ammo.

629
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,690
I'm so poor.

630
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,950
I don't know.

631
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,590
Is he on the left side?

632
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,490
He is.

633
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,350
Purple armor.

634
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,230
Okay.

635
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,510
My last two sales.

636
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,230
They have to come to us.

637
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,690
Wait, right?

638
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,790
These guys have to come to us.

639
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,290
We're good.

640
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,730
We have to chill.

641
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,150
Our issue is we have no meds or ammo.

642
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,130
We have to win a fight.

643
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,590
We can't peek anymore.

644
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,210
Where do you want me to scan?

645
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,310
I want to peek.

646
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,630
Just keep scanning the team in the big building or on the bridge.

647
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,970
Bridge direction would be good.

648
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,510
Okay.

649
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,490
What?

650
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,390
I have this much.

651
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,510
No.

652
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,030
I already gave you all my heavy.

653
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,030
I have three bullets.

654
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:19,130
Wait, I think we should go to the house over and use catalyst on the walls.

655
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,830
Like make catalyst doors.

656
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,530
Like make catalyst doors.

657
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,290
Rita.

658
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:25,870
Okay.

659
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,570
Wait, wait, wait.

660
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,610
He's looking.

661
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,490
So annoying.

662
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,470
Yeah, this door as well.

663
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,470
We're just relaxing.

664
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,730
Please don't hurt us.

665
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:40,810
That's good.

667
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,150
That's good.

668
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,210
This door and that door.

669
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,270
I'm going to scan.

670
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,110
Should I scan at the big house?

671
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,190
Yeah, keep scanning them and like behind us.

672
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,030
I fucking hate that we got zoned because we have no loot.

673
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,250
It pisses me off always.

674
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,470
We're just little guys.

675
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,650
I hate getting zoned.

676
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,930
I changed my gun.

677
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,850
Are you changing it on RE?

678
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,710
No, you don't.

679
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,750
I have fucking 24 bullets in my hemlock.

680
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,850
But I have a lot of energy.

681
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,910
There's a Rita behind us.

682
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,270
16.

683
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,510
There's a Rita behind us.

684
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,190
By the way.

685
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,610
Look at it.

686
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,590
Cracked.

687
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,730
First guy cracked.

688
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,670
Okay.

689
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:25,450
He's dead.

690
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:26,490
Nice.

691
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,790
They're right in front of us.

692
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,690
Be careful.

693
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,530
He's there still?

694
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,550
Are we going to get...

695
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,630
I just want to finish the kill.

696
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,690
Finish it?

697
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,950
No, they lifeline res.

698
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,490
Right here.

699
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,330
I'm going to bang ult right behind this rock.

700
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,850
Behind us?

701
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,150
Okay.

702
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,930
New team landed below.

703
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,690
They're going to fight.

704
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,810
Be careful.

705
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,390
Be careful.

706
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,390
I'll go back too.

707
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,590
I can scan.

708
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,030
Look at this bloodhound.

709
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,050
One on the bloodhound.

710
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,590
Flash.

711
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:05,910
I'm going to flash.

712
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,610
Stop shooting me in the back, asshole.

713
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,710
Fuck off.

714
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,210
We're literally helping you.

715
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,870
It's my last bat.

716
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,730
You have no friends.

717
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,030
Play on Ditto.

718
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,830
Scan these guys and let's see if we can kill them.

719
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,250
Okay.

720
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,730
They scanned us.

721
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,150
I have one cell, no bats.

722
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,870
This is insane.

723
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,370
I have one cell.

724
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,230
I have two cells left.

725
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,750
Two cells left.

726
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,790
There's a team on the house, by the way.

727
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,590
We have to pull in this team.

728
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,150
I kid you not.

729
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,250
We have to pull in this team.

730
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,770
I can bloodhound all of them.

731
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,410
Look at this below.

732
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,030
They're going to fight each other.

733
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,810
I'm completely out of fucking...

734
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,590
I can scan him in one.

735
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,390
I can scan him in one.

736
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,630
I got one.

737
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,810
Scan, scan, scan.

738
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,230
Get that guy to my right.

739
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:58,830
Nice, nice, nice.

740
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,130
I'm dropping down.

741
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,790
I'm going to try to loot some.

742
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,970
You guys stay up.

743
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,490
Okay.

744
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,210
I'll stay.

745
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,450
Do they have loot?

746
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:11,830
Do they have loot?

747
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,690
I need energy and light.

748
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,670
I'm trying to get as much as I can.

749
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,550
They're scanning me though.

750
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,990
I can scan anyone.

751
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:19,490
I'm looking.

752
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,470
I need some cover.

753
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,430
I'm trying to help you.

754
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,230
I can make you a wall.

755
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,590
I'm good for now.

756
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,350
I'm just going to try to loot this box.

757
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,770
I want to make a wall and go to you.

758
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,750
I don't think you can.

759
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,990
I don't think you can.

760
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,110
I need...

761
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,950
I have a redeploy.

762
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,470
Do you want to take my redeploy to climb back up?

763
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,270
I have one.

764
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,350
I'll use it.

765
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,450
I just need you guys to watch these dumbasses that are trying to fucking kill me.

766
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:48,890
You're fine.

767
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,830
I have two seconds of smoke and then I'm smoking.

768
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,030
Guys, I'm on the right side.

769
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,650
We might have to drop.

770
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,790
There's a team looking.

771
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,190
They're looking at us.

772
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,350
Play up top if you can.

773
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,890
I can't.

774
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,270
The other team is meeting up.

775
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,150
Then come to me.

776
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,670
Is there meds in there?

777
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,110
We're going to have to full kill this team.

778
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,870
I'm going to make a wall.

779
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,770
I will swap my armor.

780
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,030
I don't have anything.

781
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,730
I have one bat and 11 cells.

782
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,530
Come with me here.

783
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:18,810
You got to play here.

784
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,090
No choice.

785
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:20,930
Cells here.

786
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,670
Get as many nades as you can.

787
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,590
We can go back up now.

788
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,130
We can go back up.

789
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,130
Go back up in the corner.

790
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,750
The other side is not in the zone anymore.

791
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,590
They're not underneath that.

792
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,590
What the fuck?

793
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,590
I didn't get that scan.

794
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,710
Falcon, you can see us.

795
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,850
It's fine.

796
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,090
I have smoke.

797
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,210
It's fine.

798
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,690
They can apparently just see.

799
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,830
I was going to...

800
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,050
I'm all here.

801
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:45,910
Just chill.

802
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,090
I don't think that team can push.

803
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,010
No, I'm fine.

804
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,050
Just block us.

805
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,730
Block, block, block.

806
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,450
The back boat is...

807
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,470
It's okay.

808
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,310
It's okay.

809
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,790
How can he just do that?

810
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,010
Just play behind my knockdown.

811
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,610
Not yet.

812
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,030
They don't see me yet.

813
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,430
He's just staring at me.

814
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,750
Can you crack him once?

815
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,730
And then res me?

816
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,670
I didn't try.

817
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:10,710
Okay.

818
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,650
Try to Bloodhound scan them maybe.

819
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:16,910
Oh my god.

820
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,230
I can't fucking pick you up.

821
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,810
I used the shield res already just in case.

822
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,590
You can armor swap me.

823
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,130
I already armor swapped.

824
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,890
I already used it.

825
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,350
I'm going to heal it in my own smoke.

826
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,790
We got to go over in a sec.

827
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,150
Yeah, I'm taking your stuff.

828
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,950
Okay, I'm going to go over because this corner is a death sentence.

829
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,450
I'm getting behind this rampart wall to...

830
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,430
I have no more bats and I have 11 cells.

831
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,390
I don't have any shields for you.

832
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,670
This is ours.

833
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,770
I can give you shields.

834
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,250
I only have syringes.

835
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,350
I'm going to have to...

836
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,030
I'm going to have to bang ult this.

837
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:54,730
Okay.

838
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,330
We're going to have to play left side here.

839
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,410
I see a team right in front of us.

840
00:25:59,450 --> 00:25:59,950
Right here.

841
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,650
I'm going to bang ult left side.

842
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,170
There's a guy here.

843
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,490
Solo.

844
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,930
Solo.

845
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,150
Solo.

846
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,470
We're getting poked at though.

847
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,570
This is my ult.

848
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,730
We can play on this.

849
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,030
Okay.

850
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,150
Play on me.

851
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,830
And we slowly move.

852
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,190
I knocked someone in front.

853
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,290
And I cracked like crazy.

854
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,090
Kill the guy.

855
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:20,910
He's alone.

856
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:21,150
Nice.

857
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,490
I knocked two people here in the smoke.

858
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,990
I'm going to go here.

859
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,130
Play the head glitch.

860
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,610
Play the head glitch.

861
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,510
It's one guy.

862
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,610
It's full kill.

863
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,930
It was one guy.

864
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,790
Oh my god.

865
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,230
What do we do?

866
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,510
I knocked two people there.

867
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,850
I think they have...

868
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,030
No.

869
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,530
They full killed your team.

870
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,770
They full killed them.

871
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,270
I got the kills.

872
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,550
You got the kills?

873
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,290
Nice.

874
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,350
There's nothing we can do.

875
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,390
Their zone came on us.

876
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,830
We were so poor.

877
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,990
We were so poor.

878
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,790
I actually just hate getting zoned.

879
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,150
It's so bad.

880
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,630
I hate it so much.

881
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,370
There was nothing we can do.

882
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,670
We got kills.

883
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,550
And sixth place.

884
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,190
We had to.

885
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,450
If we don't kill people.

886
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,210
We don't know how to lose.

887
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,150
If we didn't get...

888
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,970
If we didn't kill people.

889
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,890
We would actually be poor.

890
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,650
And the guys we killed were also poor.

891
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,150
So it's not like we got anything crazy.

892
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,630
Everybody was broke.

893
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,230
Guys.

894
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,730
I mean we made it pretty far.

895
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,010
I got one back and like four cells out of them.

896
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,230
I had one back too.

897
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,330
We did pretty good.

898
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,670
With how far...

899
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,830
With how broke we were.

900
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,050
We killed all three of them and got like four cells out of them.

901
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,850
That was crazy.

902
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,450
I didn't want to get zoned.

903
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,110
And that guy that saw us through smoke too.

904
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,490
That shit was fucked up.

905
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,870
Honestly I'm not gonna lie.

906
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,150
I fucking won't clip the guy through smoke right there in the end.

907
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,470
I'm not gonna lie.

908
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,110
I used scan team.

909
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,870
I smoked him.

910
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,570
And just won't clip him.

911
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,590
And my ult knocked one.

912
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:12,830
I'm not gonna lie.

913
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,970
God this Bloodhound is so rich.

914
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,550
He actually has meds.

915
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,150
That's not fair.

916
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,630
We got sabotaged by the game leader.

917
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,050
There was just so much we had to control.

918
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,310
With so much little resources.

919
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,950
That's messed up.

920
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,090
I bet you that first game would have been our winning game if we didn't get sabotaged.

921
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,150
Yeah.

922
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,590
We had two beacons.

923
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,370
We had red bane.

924
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:38,890
We had everything.

925
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,810
Yeah we had everything.

926
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,950
I had my gun load out.

927
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,950
I had everything I ever wanted in life.

928
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,650
Look at this meta dude.

929
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,530
Smoke, scan.

930
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,130
I mean they are rich.

931
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,430
They actually have loot.

932
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,530
It's not fair.

933
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,550
When we are broke we just have to win fights and take out the shit.

934
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,350
There is no other choice.

935
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,870
And this is also...

936
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,810
This lifeline team is the team that we know.

937
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,750
When they landed below.

938
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,370
This was literally the team we knocked.

939
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,490
But they got second place.

940
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,670
We knocked bloodhound and then they used lifeline res.

941
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,170
So we didn't get the kill for it.

942
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,030
And I wanted to finish.

943
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,370
That's not fair.

944
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:23,850
It's okay.

945
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,130
We killed the other team.

946
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,370
That tried to get in.

947
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,610
We did the best we could with the loot we had.

948
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,450
Yeah with the...

949
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,590
The situation we had.

950
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,450
We got kills.

951
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,870
And we got sixth place.

952
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,550
Let's go.

953
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,130
TSM could never do that.

954
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,470
The old TSM.

955
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,030
That's why we are the new TSM.

956
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,890
Yeah old TSM sucks.

957
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,430
Yeah old TSM fucking sucks.

958
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,710
They could never do something like this.

959
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,630
Yeah I mean...

960
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,210
Old TSM got 17th place.

961
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,570
That's why we are the new TSM.

962
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,470
That's all I'm saying.

963
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,210
We did good considering the fact that we don't have aim assist.

964
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,770
And we have no...

965
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,150
That's true.

966
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,910
That's so true.

967
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,330
So real for that.

968
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,690
We are so real for that.

969
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,570
You are so real.

970
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,670
Oh my god.

971
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:22,990
You are so real for that.

972
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,890
Oh my god.

973
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,550
You are so real.

974
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,970
Say your truth.

975
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,410
Say it to the world.

976
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,270
Alright.

977
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,850
I did.

978
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,090
So I can fucking blame for it.

979
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,450
I need to get some coffee.

980
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,310
I'm fucked right now.

981
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,910
Is it Storm Point or still World's Edge?

982
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:49,970
I think it's World's Edge.

983
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,690
It's three World's Edge and then three Storm Points.

984
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,870
I'll be back.

985
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,070
I'm going to grab some coffee.

986
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,190
I'll be back.

987
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,190
I'm going to grab some coffee.

988
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,210
Okay.

989
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,980
I drank my first coffee in like six months for this tournament.

990
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,540
I drank my first coffee in like six months for this tournament.

991
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,960
It's crazy.

992
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,440
First coffee in six months?

993
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:12,960
Yes.

994
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,500
Wow.

995
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,020
Alright I'm going to go.

996
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,500
I'm back.

997
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,760
Are we doing the same comp?

998
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,500
The refrigerator is right outside my room.

999
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,960
Are you getting iced coffee?

1000
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,800
Yeah I'm getting iced coffee.

1001
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,620
Canned coffee.

1002
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,940
You know.

1003
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,500
Fake coffee where it's just sugar.

1004
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,160
Is that like... I used to drink just like canned coffees from Starbucks.

1005
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,280
Like actual Starbucks canned coffees.

1006
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,180
No it's like Japanese canned coffee.

1007
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,440
So it's mostly just sugar.

1008
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,360
With some caffeine in it.

1009
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,900
Japanese canned coffee.

1010
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,280
You have two options.

1011
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,880
You have the sugary one or the black coffee.

1012
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,060
Oh no the sugary one.

1013
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,700
I'm having the sugary one.

1014
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,140
I cannot eat black coffee.

1015
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,800
That is crazy.

1016
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,780
Like how do people swallow that?

1017
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,080
Wait Dyrus is in this lobby?

1018
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,280
Wait since when?

1019
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,500
He's from Linksr.

1020
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,300
Wait since when though?

1021
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,320
I didn't see him.

1022
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,960
I think Linksr didn't join so he got Dyrus to play or something.

1023
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,300
Oh my god we have to kill Dyrus.

1024
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,660
We have to.

1025
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,460
I mean we can make it happen.

1026
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,320
We have to kill Dyrus.

1027
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,840
Dyrus is going to be like what the fuck dude.

1028
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,520
Is he your friend?

1029
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,920
Yeah sure.

1030
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,540
Sure what?

1031
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,580
I think we can be good friends.

1032
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,160
I think.

1033
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,120
Ditto do you know who Dyrus is?

1034
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,380
No.

1035
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,840
He's a ex-professional League of Legends player for TSM.

1036
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,480
Ditto do you know who Dyrus is?

1037
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,860
Wait I think I have ever seen him.

1038
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,400
Dyrus.

1039
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,280
Dyrus yeah.

1040
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,360
He was pretty famous in League of Legends.

1041
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,300
He was pretty famous in League of Legends.

1042
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,440
Yeah and now he's...

1043
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,420
He's like what's the word...

1044
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,320
He's wild on Twitter now.

1045
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,880
He's wild and free.

1046
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,400
He's bullied by Vtubers.

1047
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,800
He gets bullied by Vtubers in tournaments now in Apex.

1048
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,840
How the mighty have fallen.

1049
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,780
He loves me.

1050
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,500
Okay, we have two.

1051
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,040
Okay, we have two.

1052
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,360
I wish someone would not disconnect.

1053
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,500
I sense sarcasm in your voice, Ducky.

1054
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,890
Yeah, my voice always has sarcasm.

1055
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,760
But it doesn't mean I am sarcastic.

1056
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,320
That's double sarcasm right now.

1057
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,080
You're stacking it like a fucking...

1058
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,760
If I get double sarcasm, that's like two negatives.

1059
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,140
It cancels each other out.

1060
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,160
Do you not know simple math?

1061
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,860
That's not how it works in sarcasm mathematics.

1062
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,760
That is how it works!

1063
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,300
It's literally canceling each other.

1064
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,500
What do you mean?

1065
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,720
Are you some fucking PhD professor?

1066
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,260
I literally invented sarcasm mathematics.

1067
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,480
I literally have a PhD.

1068
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,000
From where?

1069
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,740
From PTSD.

1070
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,360
Oh, hey, there's a triple take.

1071
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
There's so many triple takes.

1072
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,520
I'll take a triple take.

1073
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,680
I shoot too much ammo.

1074
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,580
I need to become Shiv.

1075
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,240
I gotta carry stacks on stacks apparently.

1076
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,280
I shoot way too much.

1077
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,660
Well, to be fair, we had literally no resources going in.

1078
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,080
Oh, I forgot the game audio.

1079
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:45,560
Sorry.

1080
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:45,920
Sorry, guys.

1081
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,220
Can you scan the...

1082
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,860
people beacon?

1083
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:51,820
Right now?

1084
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,460
Yeah.

1085
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,860
Not even there though.

1086
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,080
Alright, I'm heading over.

1087
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,520
When you get there, can you scan the people beacon?

1088
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,040
Alright.

1089
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,020
This thing's right next to me, so I gotta get this.

1090
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,260
I kinda wanna open the red bin behind us, but I don't wanna go back, so we're not doing that.

1091
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,940
You're so lazy.

1092
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,940
What happened?

1093
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,680
No, because we have to rotate.

1094
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,760
What happened to you?

1095
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,260
When did you get so lazy?

1096
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,660
It's not about laziness, it's about efficiency.

1097
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,960
When did you get so lazy?

1098
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,300
Our efficiency is not allowing us to go back.

1099
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,120
We gotta go forward.

1100
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,960
Look at this zone.

1101
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
Yeah, but I have to scan anyway.

1102
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,540
Yeah, hit the scan and start walking towards me.

1103
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,380
Okay.

1104
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm like, no heavy again.

1105
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,960
This game doesn't spawn heavy ammo.

1106
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,300
Alright, scanning in 3, 2, 1.

1107
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,320
Do you need heavy mag?

1108
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,940
No, heavy ammo.

1109
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,240
Ammo, okay.

1110
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,400
I'm ready.

1111
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,920
Oh, there's people here.

1112
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,280
Okay, we can go for this and this on the way.

1113
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,120
Alright.

1114
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,940
And that should give us...

1115
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,320
I have a lot of heavy ammo.

1116
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,700
I have a redeploy.

1117
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,780
Should give us a lot of you.

1118
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,400
I need heavy and energy too.

1119
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,300
I have a lot of energy.

1120
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
I can give you 160 energy.

1121
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,200
Alright.

1122
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,440
I'm just gonna check these bins real quick.

1123
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:14,800
Ooh.

1124
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,460
I can give it to you.

1125
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,220
I have like...

1126
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,760
Run straight toward me, guys.

1127
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,040
Okay, I got heavy.

1128
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,180
I'm heading over.

1129
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,600
Yeah, we gotta...

1130
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,520
We gotta kind of move fast.

1131
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:24,980
We gotta fast rotate.

1132
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,120
There's 20 teams now.

1133
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,320
Ditto.

1134
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,920
Ditto, you're so behind.

1135
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,980
I'm dropping 80 energy here.

1136
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:31,980
Okay.

1137
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,100
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1138
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,040
Another 80 energy here.

1139
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,000
Maybe even more actually.

1140
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,200
Oh, nice.

1141
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,720
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1142
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:40,900
I'm going, I'm going.

1143
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm going, I'm going.

1144
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,020
I'm heading over.

1145
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,760
We're so fast.

1146
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,300
There's no bag...

1147
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,740
Oh, fuck.

1148
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,440
I got bags.

1149
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,620
Purple bag, this shit.

1150
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,560
There's a Havoc here.

1151
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,280
Oh, purple bag.

1152
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,220
Oh, I need Havoc.

1153
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,680
I need Volt.

1154
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:57,960
I'll take that.

1155
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,280
I'll give you Volt.

1156
00:36:59,360 --> 00:36:59,820
I'll give you Volt.

1157
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,220
Okay, I will...

1158
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,720
Okay, okay.

1159
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Here, I take this Havoc, you take the Volt.

1160
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,820
I have two short range, by the way, because I couldn't find any long range gun.

1161
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,940
JK, I found a long range gun.

1162
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,580
I need scope for it though.

1163
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,500
Okay, we'll maybe find some in Fragment.

1164
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,340
We want to hit the Juicer here and then we want to hit another people's gun.

1165
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,500
And then after that, we want to probably go for Zone.

1166
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,480
And this Zone is this...

1167
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,720
I think it's this fucking annoying one, Northside.

1168
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,240
Which one?

1169
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,360
This one on my ping.

1170
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,160
Oh, okay.

1171
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,540
North of Epi.

1172
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,700
Okay.

1173
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,320
There's a bat here.

1174
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:42,840
Can you carry?

1175
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,060
Yeah.

1176
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:43,980
Yeah.

1177
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,460
Okay.

1178
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,380
Carry the heavy too.

1179
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,680
If you found a scope, tell me.

1180
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:50,820
Okay.

1181
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,200
I'm going to throw this energy.

1182
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,700
Both of you need scope.

1183
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,440
Okay, people are here on top of Fragment.

1184
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,000
I have 2x, so I'm okay now.

1185
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,080
Okay, there's people right here.

1186
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,900
I just saw rotate.

1187
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,140
They're going to rotate up the hill here.

1188
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,560
Okay.

1189
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,480
I would read a play.

1190
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:03,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1191
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,120
We have two read a plays that we can use.

1192
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:06,500
Yeah, Bull Armors.

1193
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,920
These guys on top of the fucking building are just going to fucking gatekeep this building.

1194
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,040
I need to scan.

1195
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,040
Someone's beaming me in my back.

1196
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,500
We got to keep moving forward.

1197
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,220
Oh, I see them.

1198
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,560
They're really right behind us.

1199
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,680
Yeah, yeah.

1200
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,700
Get to the diner.

1201
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,800
Keep walking with me.

1202
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,060
They were here 30 seconds ago.

1203
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,440
Okay.

1204
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,280
Yeah, that's the team in front of us, brother.

1205
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,720
Come with me.

1206
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,480
We're going to go up the hill.

1207
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:31,960
I have SCAD and 9.

1208
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,100
Hopefully this team is not holding this high ground.

1209
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,220
I need you to scan here.

1210
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,700
All right, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1211
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:40,900
I'm going to scan.

1212
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,000
Wee!

1213
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,760
Nobody.

1214
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,880
Okay, we're good.

1215
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,980
They have Caustic Barrel.

1216
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,360
Be careful.

1217
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,360
Okay.

1218
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,650
Okay, they scanned the Survey Beacon.

1219
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,430
We can play from here.

1220
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,750
Okay.

1221
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,170
We're not last.

1222
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,630
Let's go.

1223
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,910
People died before us.

1224
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,310
I love it when people are more incompetent.

1225
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,330
Okay, dude.

1226
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,850
Are they fighting on the right side?

1227
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:07,370
Yeah.

1228
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,270
Yeah.

1229
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,390
Because if they are, we can maybe do something about it.

1230
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:10,810
Okay.

1231
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,720
Okay.

1232
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,020
I want to keep moving forward.

1233
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,140
I want to get as far north as we can because I'm...

1234
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,300
Fuck you.

1235
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,300
Oh, that's embarrassing.

1236
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,380
I'm not Bloodhound.

1237
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,040
I can't see that.

1238
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,400
I didn't see that either.

1239
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,880
Okay, I heard a Sentinel from this side.

1240
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,420
Let's keep moving.

1241
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,280
Okay.

1242
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:31,720
All right.

1243
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,580
We're right behind you.

1244
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:32,920
I need you to scan here.

1245
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,800
I've SCAD and 18 because I used it earlier.

1246
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,120
Oh, yeah.

1247
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,240
Sentinel is at the house.

1248
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,440
So we should be able to get here for free.

1249
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,680
10 seconds.

1250
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,640
Honestly, we could even play for 10 seconds.

1251
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:43,720
Okay.

1252
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,040
I'm going to scan the third beacon and then it would probably give us purple armor.

1253
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,100
You want me to scan?

1254
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,500
In this building.

1255
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,060
Scan this.

1256
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,360
I'm scanning.

1257
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,620
People in there.

1258
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:53,940
Yeah, yeah.

1259
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,380
Watch them.

1260
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:54,940
Okay.

1261
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,720
We're going to play from here.

1262
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,180
There's no other choice for us than to play from down here.

1263
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,140
Okay.

1264
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,740
I don't think we can get any more deeper.

1265
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,340
What if they shoot us from the top?

1266
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,960
They're not because I'm going to hold it.

1267
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,780
Oh, okay.

1268
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:07,900
Okay.

1269
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,500
They also...

1270
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,420
They have to hold their house.

1271
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,560
Motherfucker, get off the fucking triple take.

1272
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,680
Where are they?

1273
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,180
Here?

1274
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,280
On the roof.

1275
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,980
Yeah, on the roof.

1276
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,220
I don't see them on the roof.

1277
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,420
If that team is too...

1278
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:19,680
Oh, wait.

1279
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,060
I see a team going left side inside the climate dash.

1280
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,360
Look at them.

1281
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:22,520
Look at them.

1282
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,740
Watch them.

1283
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,600
It's two teams, I think.

1284
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

1285
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,340
It is.

1286
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,480
By the way, I missed every shot.

1287
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:30,820
I haven't done...

1288
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,000
One hit?

1289
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,840
Guys, I have not played the 30-30 in too long.

1290
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,540
Get fucked.

1291
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,040
Motherfuckers.

1292
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,320
Oh, no.

1293
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,240
I haven't shot a 30-30 in a long time.

1294
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,460
Be careful with the fucking...

1295
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:43,620
I'm not going to...

1296
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:43,740
Did you see any team?

1297
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,580
Did you see any team on top?

1298
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,300
No, there is a team in this house right here.

1299
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,060
Dokie, I want you to keep scanning in this direction behind us in case anyone is trying to walk up to us.

1300
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,480
We just need to know if there is people trying to contest us.

1301
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,620
Okay.

1302
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,520
Okay, we go on top.

1303
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,140
We go on top.

1304
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,500
I can give a two time scope.

1305
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,400
I have a two X.

1306
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,020
I have a two X.

1307
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,540
I'm just not hitting shots.

1308
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,700
You want two to four?

1309
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,540
Oh, shit.

1310
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,480
Maybe 2-4 is better for me.

1311
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,540
Someone is evacing and this time I'm gonna watch it.

1312
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,200
I heard a fucking evac.

1313
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,540
Where the fuck... Oh they're coming straight for us I think.

1314
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,280
They're flying over us.

1315
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,060
Red armor is already.

1316
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,220
What the fuck?

1317
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,840
They're gonna fight.

1318
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,720
No, they're not.

1319
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,120
They're definitely lining up people, Red.

1320
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,780
They might be... They might just got from walking around and scanning.

1321
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,440
Yeah, no.

1322
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,320
These guys are just ripping scans of cooldown.

1323
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,440
Honestly, we're like one scan of purple as well, so...

1324
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,480
We just didn't get a chance to scan anything.

1325
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,200
But where's end zone?

1326
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,780
I guess we could have an overlook.

1327
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,360
Woah.

1328
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,140
End zone is somewhere around us.

1329
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,040
I'm not sure exactly.

1330
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,480
It's either pulling to climate test or coming back to us.

1331
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,760
It's either pulling to climate test or coming back to us.

1332
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah, they're fighting in the bottom here.

1333
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah, they're pulling to climate test or coming back to us.

1334
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,340
Like full fighting?

1335
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,480
I don't know, I saw like poking down there, but, and they were running at the building.

1336
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,940
I keep looking at that.

1337
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,820
God, there's too many places to look at.

1338
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:29,880
Aaaaah.

1339
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,580
Focus, focus on looking below and scanning behind us.

1340
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,120
That's all you got to do.

1341
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,080
There's a team on top of Overlook Tower.

1342
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,700
They're fighting over there.

1343
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,640
He threw a fuse grenade.

1344
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,200
Why did I get shot?

1345
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,040
Can this guy triple-dive fuck off?

1346
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,140
Oh that's your chase, I'm not...

1347
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,120
I just got hit around the corner.

1348
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:54,860
Yeah.

1349
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,900
I smoked him.

1350
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,280
He just picks the door always.

1351
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,800
Really annoying.

1352
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,680
Leave us alone!

1353
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,280
Go fucking destroy your fence.

1354
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,940
We kinda have to...

1355
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,520
Save meds.

1356
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,880
So the same shit doesn't happen from last game.

1357
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,360
Yeah, they're getting shot too.

1358
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,600
Maybe you can pick up a killer too.

1359
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,340
I think they're fighting here.

1360
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,940
Yeah, they're full fighting here.

1361
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,400
Come here, Doki.

1362
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:24,860
Look at this.

1363
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,460
I will hit a shot.

1364
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,600
I swear to god.

1365
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,660
You wanna swap?

1366
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,560
You wanna give me repeater and I give you hemlock?

1367
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
No, I will hit a shot.

1368
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,760
I swear.

1369
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,860
In this corner, look.

1370
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,180
Guys.

1371
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,380
Look at these guys.

1372
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,240
Oh, he's dead.

1373
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:48,640
One dead.

1374
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,940
Guys, maybe I'm just...

1375
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,320
Maybe I'm just bad.

1376
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,600
There's so many teams here.

1377
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,360
I don't know what to look at.

1378
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,420
There's one more team up here.

1379
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,260
Okay.

1380
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,600
We have to keep these guys and all of this entire side.

1381
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,400
Because we have this good side over here.

1382
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:08,900
Okay.

1383
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,280
Okay.

1384
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,400
Let's do that.

1385
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,340
I'm waiting.

1386
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,180
I'm just gonna keep smoking this house.

1387
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,840
Oh, there's a guy behind this rock.

1388
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,180
There's like three teams here.

1389
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,340
Wait, it got scanned by somewhere.

1390
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,540
What?

1391
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,440
Probably really far.

1392
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,360
Can you scan this direction?

1393
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,340
It's not flying.

1394
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,200
I didn't see anybody.

1395
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,540
It has to be far because I didn't get scanned.

1396
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:32,840
Oh my god.

1397
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,200
I hit two shots, guys.

1398
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,520
These guys are dead.

1399
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,760
These guys have to die.

1400
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,700
He's in zone.

1401
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,120
What the fuck is he living?

1402
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,520
I cracked him.

1403
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,540
He has to be low.

1404
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,180
Yeah, he's... Oh, he's dead.

1405
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:48,940
Nice, Zito.

1406
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,540
They're rising.

1407
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,120
They're trying to rez.

1408
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:52,600
One more.

1409
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:52,880
One more.

1410
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,760
Nice one.

1411
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,460
They should be able to rez though.

1412
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,660
Yeah, they're trying to rez in here.

1413
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,240
I don't think so.

1414
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,240
They're getting shot from every side.

1415
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,920
I don't think they can.

1416
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,500
I didn't get my kill.

1417
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,920
They crawled inside, I think.

1418
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,900
Yeah, they're rez- they are rez- they are rez-ing.

1419
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,500
I see them rez-ing.

1420
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,400
Stop shooting him.

1421
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,240
I'm fucking ulting them.

1422
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:13,840
I don't give a fuck.

1423
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,180
They got the rez.

1424
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,680
They got the rez.

1425
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:16,780
Yeah, yeah.

1426
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,820
I saw the rez going off.

1427
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,840
What the heck?

1428
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,800
How can they?

1429
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,700
How is no one beaming these guys?

1430
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,160
He just stopped.

1431
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,900
That's actually crazy.

1432
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,680
Maybe they didn't want to give us a kill.

1433
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,040
Maybe.

1434
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,380
Oh, yeah.

1435
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,900
They're still here.

1436
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,500
Yeah, yeah.

1437
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,720
They're inside.

1438
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,260
I got my purple.

1439
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,320
I can't believe it.

1440
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,080
Oh, they're rotating.

1441
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:39,680
They're rotating out.

1442
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,360
They're rotating out.

1443
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,660
They're rotating in.

1444
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,760
These guys are gonna die, I think.

1445
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,060
Nobody's shooting them.

1446
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,160
Yeah, yeah.

1447
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:46,660
Look at the bloodhound.

1448
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,140
Look at the bloodhound.

1449
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,200
Last guy.

1450
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:48,580
Last guy.

1451
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:48,720
Right here.

1452
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,080
I'm reloading.

1453
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,080
Yeah, he's going- He has to die.

1454
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:53,720
20.

1455
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,420
Mark, can I get- Oh, wait.

1456
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,620
Behind us.

1457
00:45:59,140 --> 00:45:59,500
Oh.

1458
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,780
He got shot from behind.

1459
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,240
I'm dropping.

1460
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:02,700
I'm dropping.

1461
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,420
I'm dropping here.

1462
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,560
That's so unlucky.

1463
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,380
We're too busy looking in front.

1464
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,960
Yeah, they know they walked up to us.

1465
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,830
I can't believe that they too rotated so easily.

1466
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:17,630
I can't believe that they too rotated so easily.

1467
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,250
If you can come to me, Ditto, it's kinda okay.

1468
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:19,970
If you can come to me, Ditto, it's kinda okay.

1469
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,070
Where can I rat here?

1470
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,050
Oh my gosh.

1471
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:25,490
Sayonara.

1472
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:28,550
Sayonara.

1473
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,290
Can I go to you?

1474
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,030
I wanna go above us somehow.

1475
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,710
Do you have- I have ball.

1476
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:36,190
Ditto?

1477
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:36,550
What?

1478
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:36,990
Have ball?

1479
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,150
Come here and evac here so we can go above here.

1480
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,010
Okay.

1481
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:41,690
All the time.

1482
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,090
Come to me and just put evac.

1483
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,630
We have to go up here.

1484
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,590
So come here.

1485
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:46,790
Oh my god.

1486
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,510
Ditto is so far.

1487
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:49,070
No, no.

1488
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:49,370
She's fine.

1489
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,690
She just has to cross the lava.

1490
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,090
You got this, Ditto.

1491
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:53,190
They can't hear you.

1492
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,270
Put evac here.

1493
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:54,610
They're deaf.

1494
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,750
And we jump up here on the rock, okay?

1495
00:46:59,310 --> 00:46:59,670
Okay.

1496
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,600
And we play here.

1497
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,560
Oh.

1498
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,980
I like how Ditto is the one that still got shot.

1499
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:10,880
And be careful above.

1500
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,460
You actually had it.

1501
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,280
How are you shooting me?

1502
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,200
You're literally smoked.

1503
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,500
I have no heavy ammo, buddy.

1504
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,900
Get top five for me.

1505
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,360
Oh man, I had all the heavy ammo in the world.

1506
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,520
I can't give you the bomb.

1507
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,520
Man, if only the bloodhound didn't die.

1508
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,760
We can't make sound here, Ditto.

1509
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,680
Huh?

1510
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,280
Ditto, just crouch here.

1511
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,020
We can't make sound.

1512
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,040
Be a rat.

1513
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,900
If the team above us peeks, we die.

1514
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,460
It's rat time.

1515
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,640
We have to rat here until someone drops on us and then we kill them.

1516
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,320
Okay.

1517
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,900
I think there is a team here in this corner.

1518
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:45,720
Yeah, there is.

1519
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,160
Look at them.

1520
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,300
They're going to fight.

1521
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1522
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,280
They will.

1523
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,200
Okay, we don't kill this guy.

1524
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:50,500
Don't shoot.

1525
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:50,840
Don't shoot.

1526
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,740
Oh, never mind.

1527
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,140
Okay, okay.

1528
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,660
That's it.

1529
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,260
I gripped them enough.

1530
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,720
I cracked two.

1531
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:57,980
Okay.

1532
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,400
They're full-filed.

1533
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,100
Oh, we got scanned.

1534
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:00,920
We got scanned by...

1535
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,640
I didn't get scanned.

1536
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,060
Only you.

1537
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,960
They'll think she's a solo.

1538
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,480
Because they fucking hate you.

1539
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:07,900
I don't know.

1540
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,280
I lost with you.

1541
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,040
I don't know.

1542
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,680
They didn't scan me.

1543
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,280
They just hate you.

1544
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:14,800
Is it a bot?

1545
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,700
Maybe it's a bot?

1546
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,600
I mean, you just say you're getting scanned and then it didn't pick up.

1547
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:20,900
I don't know.

1548
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:20,900
I think I was...

1549
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,980
I was a little bit in front of you.

1550
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,360
That's why.

1551
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:23,700
I was a little bit in front of you.

1552
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:23,700
That's why.

1553
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,100
Okay, they finished this fight.

1554
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,460
I believe in top five.

1555
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,680
I believe in top five.

1556
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,840
Maybe top four.

1557
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,000
It would be better.

1558
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,180
I think we're gonna be a little wild.

1559
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,200
Now I got scanned.

1560
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,200
It's max range scan.

1561
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,600
They're scanning from like here.

1562
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,940
It's max range.

1563
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,260
They're right above us.

1564
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,080
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1565
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,240
I think we're really good here.

1566
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:47,880
If we just...

1567
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,440
We're gonna walk here.

1568
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,680
They're right above us.

1569
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,540
They're looking over.

1570
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:52,800
Careful.

1571
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,880
Don't let them see.

1572
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,060
Yeah, they saw me.

1573
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,580
They saw me.

1574
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,380
Oh, they ulted.

1575
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,060
Fuck them.

1576
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,840
But they have Bloodhound ult.

1577
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,500
Won't they be able to see that?

1578
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,600
Oh, they're rotating.

1579
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,340
I tried.

1580
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,820
I think they're dying.

1581
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,180
Those guys rotated.

1582
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,900
Sita, we're gonna play like here.

1583
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:17,720
Okay.

1584
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,660
They're right above us.

1585
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:19,840
Careful.

1586
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,740
Look at this guy fighting.

1587
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:23,940
Fighting.

1588
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,920
Oh, a guy beaming me from the left side.

1589
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,000
God, this is annoying.

1590
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,840
Everybody wants to kill you.

1591
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,220
Do you not have an arena play?

1592
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,340
Is he up here?

1593
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,680
No, no arena play.

1594
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,040
Now I'm lagging all of a sudden.

1595
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,620
No!

1596
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,870
Oh my gosh, this is intense.

1597
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,010
Sit where I am.

1598
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,530
How many shield cells do you have left, Ditto?

1599
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:53,950
Two.

1600
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:56,610
Okay, one left.

1601
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:57,470
It's okay.

1602
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,270
I have... I can give you some.

1603
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,130
Okay.

1604
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:01,650
Nice.

1605
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,170
I'm gonna bang ult here.

1606
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,070
Uh-huh.

1607
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,850
I can't even ping it.

1608
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:09,890
It's okay.

1609
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,430
They shoot another team.

1610
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,570
This team is gonna get beamed from right side.

1611
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:20,770
Uh-huh.

1612
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:22,490
Like, look at this team.

1613
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:22,990
Look at this team.

1614
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,650
Oh, what the fuck?

1615
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:26,570
How can you see me, dude?

1616
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,030
Just doesn't like you.

1617
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,350
Alright, I'm gonna bang ult in here.

1618
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,050
I'm full healing and we're gonna play right side slow.

1619
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:37,110
Okay.

1620
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:40,470
Nade.

1621
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,980
Oh, dude.

1622
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:45,960
Oh, no.

1623
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,980
I'm so... I'm lagging.

1624
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,590
I can't even hit... like, he's teleporting.

1625
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,250
Oh.

1626
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:57,350
Oh.

1627
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:58,570
Oh.

1628
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:58,910
Oh.

1629
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:00,290
Oh.

1630
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:00,350
Oh.

1631
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,290
I didn't see that.

1632
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:01,810
I didn't see that.

1633
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,350
Oh, nice.

1634
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:05,330
She's actually teleporting.

1635
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:05,570
That's insane.

1636
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:06,850
Wait, they're teleporting?

1637
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:07,710
That fucking sucks.

1638
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:08,570
Yeah, for me.

1639
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:10,530
That's so unlucky.

1640
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,570
Yeah, everyone's teleporting.

1641
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,190
This is insane.

1642
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:15,330
Yeah.

1643
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,050
Is it still storming or...?

1644
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,910
No, I don't know what's fucking going on.

1645
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:21,190
We're back.

1646
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,110
Alright.

1647
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,390
Hey, we got top five.

1648
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,490
No, that was Darius' team.

1649
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,130
Yeah, we got top five.

1650
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:30,650
Yeah.

1651
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:31,630
Yeah.

1652
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,810
Wait, I think you knocked Darius.

1653
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:33,670
Oh, wait, he did.

1654
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,690
He knocked Darius.

1655
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:35,770
You know what?

1656
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:36,670
That's great.

1657
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,310
That's all I care about.

1658
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:43,070
And we got top five.

1659
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,730
Oh, we got zero... we had zero kills for top five?

1660
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,570
We didn't kill anybody?

1661
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,110
I'm surprised that we didn't kill anybody.

1662
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:52,650
Yeah.

1663
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,110
I guess we just... we knocked, like, a lot of people.

1664
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,490
Yeah, we didn't get any kill.

1665
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,030
Yeah.

1666
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:01,630
I know.

1667
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,210
Our PR is pulling a zero.

1668
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,090
He's gonna ult at four.

1669
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,850
What the fuck was that Bangalore banner?

1670
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,070
That's Lynxer.

1671
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,910
And he's been doing pro league.

1672
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,300
Not a full VTuber tournament, guys.

1673
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,760
Because I think there's not enough VTuber Apex players in NA.

1674
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:24,960
Back.

1675
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,120
Welcome back.

1676
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,000
Did I get any kills for that?

1677
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,120
Did you fix... no, we didn't get zero.

1678
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,580
I would win that last fight if I'm not lagging.

1679
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,480
Everything's fucking teleporting.

1680
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:37,640
Oh, yeah.

1681
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,220
Yeah.

1682
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,100
I could tell.

1683
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,980
The first mag was not very inspirational.

1684
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,540
I should have used my ult.

1685
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,060
On my screen, that first mag was all over him.

1686
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,980
Literally, aimed straight at him.

1687
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,580
Yeah, yeah.

1688
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,760
On my POV, it was not inspirational.

1689
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,160
Shut up.

1690
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,820
My POV is literally a fullness.

1691
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,980
He was teleporting, so where I was shooting, he wasn't there.

1692
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,160
This shit again.

1693
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:10,940
I'm tilted.

1694
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,480
What?

1695
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,040
Did you fix it?

1696
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:13,520
Or...

1697
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,720
I don't know.

1698
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,720
What did you do?

1699
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,740
I literally don't know.

1700
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,220
Did you do anything to fix it or nah?

1701
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,280
I turned off everything in my house from Wi-Fi.

1702
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,600
I'm gonna switch my VPN as well.

1703
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:28,740
Maybe.

1704
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,060
Maybe that helps.

1705
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,860
Tell the organizer to do one game in Europe.

1706
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,680
I mean, half the team is EU anyway, so...

1707
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,680
Half the tournament.

1708
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,800
More than I should know.

1709
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,180
One third of people in this tournament are EU anyway, so might as well.

1710
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,500
I'm fine with NA.

1711
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,680
As long as I'm not lagging.

1712
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,680
Like, when people start teleporting, I can't play the game.

1713
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,920
I mean, I can't hit people.

1714
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,240
How am I supposed to hit people when I can't see where they are?

1715
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,540
They're not...

1716
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,300
Like, where I'm shooting, they're not there.

1717
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,080
Change the server.

1718
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,740
Change the server.

1719
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,200
I don't know if switching to EU would help.

1720
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,010
Man, that's unlucky.

1721
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,090
Because it always happens, like, in the second or third game for you.

1722
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,950
Because it'll be okay and then suddenly, bam.

1723
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,750
It was fine in the morning.

1724
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,770
I played an entire tournament today in the morning.

1725
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:28,690
It was completely fine.

1726
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:30,190
Oh my gosh, sabotage.

1727
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:31,810
Maybe he is DDoSing you.

1728
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,520
Maybe we are getting sabotaged.

1729
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,120
Alright.

1730
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,160
Yay!

1731
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,360
Game will restart.

1732
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,640
What do you mean, game will restart?

1733
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,180
What?

1734
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,120
What do you mean?

1735
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,660
Please announce new contest.

1736
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,900
Game will restart.

1737
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,900
Oh shit, wait, you're not even in the fucking lobby.

1738
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,780
Wait a minute.

1739
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,160
Yeah, I have to restart my game.

1740
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,500
Hmm.

1741
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,860
What does he mean by game will restart?

1742
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,180
I don't know.

1743
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,100
I hope he's not restarting a whole game.

1744
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,460
He's gonna keep us in the 4AM or what?

1745
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,720
No, they cannot.

1746
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,180
I told him.

1747
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,540
I was like, I'm leaving at 3.

1748
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,120
Like, you literally can't.

1749
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,280
I literally cannot.

1750
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,120
I was like, if I'm doing this tournament, I have to leave at exactly 3.

1751
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,700
Oh, so IPN is grieving.

1752
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,960
That's what's going on.

1753
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,540
Wait, how so?

1754
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:42,500
Because apparently you need to announce a contest and they contested without announcing it.

1755
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,400
Oh!

1756
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,300
Oh wait, who did he grief?

1757
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,220
I don't know.

1758
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,460
Whoever lands Overlook, I think.

1759
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,920
Oh, so they're not gonna count that game?

1760
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,180
No, they're counting it.

1761
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,480
But he said moving onwards.

1762
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,880
If that happens again, he's not gonna count it.

1763
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,960
Oh, that sucks for that team in Overlook.

1764
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,240
That sucks for them.

1765
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,180
They got fucking griefed.

1766
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,320
They should like deduct points for that team.

1767
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,780
IPN should get minus 40.

1768
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,300
Yeah, yeah.

1769
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,160
They should deduct points.

1770
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,080
IPN should get minus 40 points so you can't win.

1771
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,280
At all.

1772
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,640
Like no matter how many points they get.

1773
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,360
You cannot get past top 10.

1774
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,020
Because you griefed.

1775
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,520
You ruined the game for everybody else.

1776
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,400
Who's IPN playing with?

1777
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,500
Fruit and Zero.

1778
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,500
Fruit and Zero?

1779
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,540
Oh my god.

1780
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,580
Fruit and Zero and IPN are griefing.

1781
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,280
That's insane.

1782
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,280
They're griefers.

1783
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:42,900
I know.

1784
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,620
That's what I'm saying.

1785
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,540
They should minus deduct points.

1786
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,800
Wow.

1787
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,520
Why are they playing with two pros and griefing?

1788
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,120
I know, right?

1789
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,620
No.

1790
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:53,620
No.

1791
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,600
Two pros and griefing is crazy.

1792
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,140
I know.

1793
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,500
You gotta do the honorable thing and have one pro and griefing.

1794
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,880
But we're not griefing.

1795
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,860
Griefing our own team, maybe.

1796
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,100
Okay, well.

1797
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,000
Ditto, carry us.

1798
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,140
Let's fucking get beacons.

1799
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,100
Okay.

1800
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,400
Ditto, carry.

1801
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,660
Carry everyone.

1802
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:22,880
Yeah.

1803
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,460
Ditto, what happened?

1804
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,260
You used to kill everybody.

1805
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,600
What happened?

1806
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,400
Don't gaslight her.

1807
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,260
I'm not gaslighting her.

1808
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:31,380
I'm just gonna kill her.

1809
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,480
I'm just gonna kill her.

1810
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,500
I follow RPRs all day.

1811
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,520
You're supposed to give her confidence.

1812
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,140
RPRs making you a worst player.

1813
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,080
How am I worse?

1814
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,460
I literally have the most kills in the air.

1815
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,260
And I'm not yearly.

1816
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,040
I don't know.

1817
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,560
She said she's literally following you and she's not getting kills.

1818
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,020
That's what she said.

1819
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,960
See?

1820
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:54,540
She agreed.

1821
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,240
I'm gonna lose my mind.

1822
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,780
I'm useless again.

1823
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,500
How many pings do you have in NA?

1824
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,600
You should have Blaze ping more than me.

1825
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,380
Well, the problem is not the ping.

1826
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,540
I have 150 ping and it jumps on 200.

1827
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,500
Then I have 150 and it jumps on 200.

1828
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,100
And then makes everyone teleport.

1829
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,520
It's your internet.

1830
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,220
It can't be my internet.

1831
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:19,260
I literally called my company twice to full restart everything and they did.

1832
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,680
And my stream is not lagging.

1833
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,300
How do you know they did it?

1834
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,560
Because everything went down for like half an hour.

1835
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,560
Maybe they just turned it off but they didn't.

1836
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,740
I don't know but...

1837
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,640
Oh, I fucked up my landing so I'm gonna steal your loot.

1838
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,440
I don't know what's going on.

1839
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,540
I'm gonna steal people's loot.

1840
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,200
I don't know how to fix it even.

1841
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,860
Oh, thank god I got a hemlock this time.

1842
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,520
What's your no idea?

1843
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,590
Maybe it's just a...

1844
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,490
It's just Apex but...

1845
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,750
It happened to me in Valorant the other day as well.

1846
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,370
And I don't think it's fixed.

1847
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:08,090
But to be honest, Valorant...

1848
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:08,450
I was...

1849
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,710
I was playing...

1850
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,430
Yeah, but that was before I fixed it.

1851
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:16,770
On Valorant I was playing on like an NA server with like 200 ping so it's kinda...

1852
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:19,530
Could have been disused.

1853
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:21,770
Oh, 3x.

1854
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,430
Is RPL still teleporting for you or is it fixed now?

1855
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:28,870
No, it's not fixed.

1856
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:30,570
It's never gonna be fixed.

1857
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:31,130
No...

1858
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:32,450
No...

1859
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,930
How much time do you have?

1860
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,010
Ooh...

1861
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:37,050
Can you guys scan?

1862
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:38,070
Okay.

1863
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,810
Actual gameplay sabotage.

1864
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:43,570
Oh, actually I'll take that.

1865
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:44,990
I forgot I'm running hemlock.

1866
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:49,010
I'm dropping a 3x if anybody wants it.

1867
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,170
I want it.

1868
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,070
I want any scope.

1869
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:56,250
You want a 2x?

1870
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:57,570
I have an extra 2x.

1871
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,970
Yeah.

1872
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:58,570
2x, 2x.

1873
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,630
I'll take anything.

1874
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:00,550
Alright.

1875
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,310
I'm heading over.

1876
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:08,910
We have zone.

1877
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,590
We have zone again?

1878
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:11,870
Yes.

1879
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,150
We have a zone again.

1880
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:14,430
No!

1881
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:18,930
It's like we should play like from this side where you guys are.

1882
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:19,690
So stay there.

1883
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,710
I'm gonna get us some Evo charge here.

1884
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:23,210
Here?

1885
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:24,470
Yeah.

1886
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:29,150
Like on this building or this height but I think building is probably easier.

1887
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,150
Okay, I'm gonna craft it.

1888
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,150
Okay.

1889
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:33,850
I'm gonna craft it.

1890
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:36,670
I got 3x.

1891
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:37,710
Oh, you have 3x?

1892
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:37,950
Okay.

1893
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,150
I'll keep my 2x.

1894
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:39,410
Okay.

1895
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,670
I'll have you go grab that 3x.

1896
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,190
I need sculpture.

1897
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:47,770
Nice.

1898
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:52,150
I have 3 bats and 8 cells.

1899
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:52,870
3x.

1900
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:56,750
I have 2x12.

1901
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,230
I didn't really find a lot of bats at all.

1902
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,830
And I can't find a Havoc.

1903
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:02,870
I can...

1904
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:03,850
Oh, wait.

1905
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:04,570
Wait, we...

1906
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,130
Is...

1907
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:05,830
Who's getting the...

1908
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,130
Are you getting the Harvester or are we getting it?

1909
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,950
Yeah, I mean, if you can get it but don't die for it.

1910
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,030
I already got one of them.

1911
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,170
I'll get the other then.

1912
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,490
Wait, shouldn't...

1913
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,710
I feel like you should be getting this, not me.

1914
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,870
I'm way too far away to get it.

1915
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:24,210
Oh, okay.

1916
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:24,270
Oh, sorry.

1917
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:25,110
You are...

1918
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,410
Oh, somebody was here.

1919
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:30,470
Somebody was here.

1920
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,330
Probably tree team got the Harvester.

1921
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:34,010
Oh, okay.

1922
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:37,520
I got it.

1923
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,140
I got it.

1924
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,020
Okay, nice.

1925
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,060
I mean, we...

1926
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,100
Our only option is really just playing zone.

1927
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,860
We don't really have much one option here.

1928
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,460
We're just gonna live here.

1929
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:47,820
It's okay.

1930
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,600
We're not gonna be last.

1931
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,620
Somebody's dying already.

1932
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:50,760
Yay!

1933
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,700
I'm pretty sure it ends on this bridge, like right there.

1934
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:55,920
All right.

1935
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,360
Should we go to that bridge or stay here?

1936
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,520
No, no, no.

1937
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,520
I wanna play from like this corner here.

1938
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,240
Those walls are really good.

1939
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,560
Okay.

1940
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,200
That's what...

1941
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:05,740
I'm okay.

1942
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:05,920
I'm gonna check.

1943
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,280
Yeah, that's why I wanna play from this building and the walls.

1944
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,240
I hate holding these walls because like you just get needed.

1945
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,900
I like pushing it more than holding it.

1946
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,900
I don't see anybody yet.

1947
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,040
I'm gonna put four soldiers.

1948
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:23,800
Oh.

1949
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,160
Over there.

1950
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:25,880
I see them.

1951
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,060
And they see us too.

1952
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:29,900
What the fuck?

1953
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,040
Are they coming?

1954
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,060
Oh, he came from...

1955
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,600
These guys came from Geyser.

1956
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:34,840
Geyser?

1957
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:35,820
Or was it...

1958
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:36,680
It came from...

1959
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,820
It helped Sean's life though.

1960
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:38,240
Geyser, big mod.

1961
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,420
These guys came from big mod because he has the paintball gun.

1962
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:40,700
Oh, big mod.

1963
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:41,620
Okay.

1964
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:41,860
Yeah.

1965
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,760
Did you hit the...

1966
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,760
Oh, no.

1967
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:47,960
What?

1968
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,280
We didn't have people scan, did we?

1969
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,120
No, we didn't.

1970
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:51,700
Yeah.

1971
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,800
I'm checking if anybody reapplies to us.

1972
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,220
Adita, you play there and play safe.

1973
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,120
Put all your Qs everywhere.

1974
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,800
We're gonna play roof and just look for the...

1975
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,980
We're gonna look around and try to get information.

1976
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,680
When it gets like...

1977
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,580
When a lot of people start getting here, we're just gonna play here.

1978
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,760
Adita's gonna play there.

1979
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,840
And then if it gets like dicey, we just run to her.

1980
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:16,320
Okay.

1981
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,960
And play from Adita's side.

1982
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:18,560
Like we wanna...

1983
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,300
We don't play those walls over there.

1984
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:20,740
Okay.

1985
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:28,980
And if we can keep this high ground, we want to, but if we can't, we'll just give it up and play walls instead because these walls are pretty much gonna win us the game.

1986
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:29,700
Okay.

1987
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,350
Nobody's rotated to us yet.

1988
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,790
Yeah.

1989
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:40,290
Oh, team over here.

1990
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,610
They're very far.

1991
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,950
They're very slow.

1992
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,230
They're just playing edge, I guess.

1993
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,170
Yeah.

1994
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:48,910
I'm like...

1995
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,470
Cause like usually zone teams would be here already.

1996
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,590
So I'm like surprised I don't see anybody yet.

1997
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,130
I don't even see any redeployers.

1998
01:03:58,830 --> 01:03:59,270
Oh!

1999
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:01,570
The team jump over here.

2000
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:02,110
How close?

2001
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:02,790
Where the fuck?

2002
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,630
Where I'm pinged.

2003
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:05,170
Oh.

2004
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:06,310
Oh, okay.

2005
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,070
Purple armor.

2006
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:08,770
These guys are pretty good.

2007
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:09,650
They're playing super slow.

2008
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:10,010
What the fuck?

2009
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,830
They're just taking scan... like a million... they can scan and shit.

2010
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,180
Look to my left.

2011
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,000
Oh, why is the spawn so low?

2012
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,840
That guy is flashed by the way.

2013
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:27,140
This guy.

2014
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,060
Yeah.

2015
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:29,800
This is bottom.

2016
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,660
Look at this bottom now.

2017
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,220
Did I hit him?

2018
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:31,940
He's gonna move.

2019
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:33,420
Yeah.

2020
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,020
He's gonna move.

2021
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,480
Stop shooting.

2022
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,920
I'm looking to your left.

2023
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,620
I'm gonna make sure...

2024
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:42,460
Oh, there's a team coming... rotating in behind us.

2025
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:43,800
Blue armor.

2026
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,080
Blue armor.

2027
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,060
I'm just gonna make sure these guys...

2028
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:48,720
Whoa.

2029
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:49,640
Okay.

2030
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,120
They have triple takes to get off the roof.

2031
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:51,560
Yeah.

2032
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,130
This is not gonna be a fun game for me.

2033
01:04:58,650 --> 01:04:58,950
Yep.

2034
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:00,270
They're coming to us.

2035
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:01,530
I'm gonna scan.

2036
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,730
They're just chilling.

2037
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:03,510
Oh, okay.

2038
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:04,810
It's pretty far over there.

2039
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:05,810
Yeah.

2040
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:05,970
Yeah.

2041
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:06,990
We're in the back off.

2042
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,010
What the fuck?

2043
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:09,090
Oh, bridge, bridge.

2044
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:09,710
People.

2045
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,190
Okay.

2046
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:11,810
Bridge is fine.

2047
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:12,490
They can hold that.

2048
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:16,590
That bridge team is like... I'm like 99% sure they're gonna die.

2049
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,670
Yeah.

2050
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,230
Because everyone's gonna focus them.

2051
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:18,410
Okay.

2052
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:20,870
I'm just double checking there's extra resources.

2053
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:21,550
I'm gonna hold here.

2054
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,370
One team at the tree.

2055
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:28,930
Bridge team is no longer at bridge from what I can see.

2056
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:29,430
Okay.

2057
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:32,450
Yeah.

2058
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:32,950
They went below.

2059
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,630
There's someone getting charge-rappled like crazy at tree.

2060
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:39,290
Oh, there.

2061
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:40,990
Oh, there.

2062
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:41,310
Here, here.

2063
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,090
Okay.

2064
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:42,390
Yeah.

2065
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:42,650
In this truck.

2066
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,930
So, Dito, you gotta watch that zip line because these guys can be here.

2067
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:45,970
I'm looking behind us.

2068
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:46,650
Oh, there.

2069
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:47,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2070
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:47,910
I'll be watching.

2071
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:50,950
If someone gets close to you, just run straight for me.

2072
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:51,710
I can smoke for you.

2073
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:51,930
Okay.

2074
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:54,550
We'll just give up that house if we have to.

2075
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,530
But for now, just pretend like you're a full team there.

2076
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:57,530
All right.

2077
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:58,530
I'm a full team.

2078
01:05:58,610 --> 01:05:59,550
Don't come near me.

2079
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:02,370
Yeah, they can hear this.

2080
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,370
That works.

2081
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,010
Don't come near me.

2082
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:11,210
I'm standing on the roof because I'm so confident with my team.

2083
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,890
One team that in the tunnel.

2084
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:14,010
Oh, shit.

2085
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,330
Maybe I shouldn't stand on the roof anymore.

2086
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:16,170
Yeah.

2087
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:17,690
I should.

2088
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,390
I'm shooting tunnels so they know I'm here.

2089
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,190
I'm getting longboard from fucking...

2090
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,390
Oh, these guys dropped down.

2091
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,090
Okay, they dropped down.

2092
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,510
One guy dropped down.

2093
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,170
Two of them, I think.

2094
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,150
I think all of them dropped down.

2095
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:31,190
Yeah, they're going for this building.

2096
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:32,110
They're gonna hold that building.

2097
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:34,110
I cannot see people behind me anymore.

2098
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:37,690
Oh, no, they're over here.

2099
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,090
Okay.

2100
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,930
I need to save my heavy and just run through heavy.

2101
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,930
There's people over where I pinged, northeast.

2102
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:46,150
I'm gonna go and get them.

2103
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:46,190
I'm gonna go and get back.

2104
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:46,570
I have seen a lot.

2105
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:48,910
Okay.

2106
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:51,950
Are you okay?

2107
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:52,990
Yeah, I'm okay.

2108
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:53,830
I'm just poking them.

2109
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,210
I'm just being annoying.

2110
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:57,850
Just let everyone know we're here.

2111
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,850
That's basically what we're doing now.

2112
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:00,170
Yeah.

2113
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,590
Like, make as much noise so people are afraid of, like, pushing this area.

2114
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:08,950
And if we get evac, we just have to full fight for the spot.

2115
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,250
We can't lose this spot.

2116
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:15,410
So, if I get, like, pushed here, I need you guys to instantly, like, come and help make me here.

2117
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:21,230
We do not want to give away these walls because they will be our one condition.

2118
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:25,110
I'm so scared of rotating up here on the roof.

2119
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:28,370
Just watch like in that direction just so no one's walking up from you there.

2120
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,070
Oh.

2121
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,630
What?

2122
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:31,590
Oh my god.

2123
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:32,590
I got shot by four people.

2124
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:33,590
Oh my god.

2125
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:35,910
Okay, Deita, I'm gonna go for banner.

2126
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,990
I got shot by so many people.

2127
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,070
Okay, I'm gonna go away.

2128
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,850
I got shot by two different teams.

2129
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:44,050
I hate it here.

2130
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:47,330
Really?

2131
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,490
Guys, never...

2132
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:48,890
Okay.

2133
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:50,170
That's what happened to me.

2134
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,610
That's what happened to me.

2135
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,230
I told you.

2136
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:55,550
I'm gonna stop.

2137
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:56,510
Res, res, res.

2138
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:58,550
I told you.

2139
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,670
Yeah.

2140
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,570
They're pushing, they're pushing, they're pushing.

2141
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:03,930
From where?

2142
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:06,130
You get my... Oh.

2143
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:06,870
Okay, I'm ulting that.

2144
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:08,250
Okay.

2145
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,250
She didn't get the res.

2146
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:09,830
She didn't get the res.

2147
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:11,990
Yeah, I can smoke for you later.

2148
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,450
Just stay alive.

2149
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,030
What the fuck?

2150
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,170
Every team is looking at us.

2151
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:21,810
I will go on top and cover you.

2152
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:23,030
Yeah.

2153
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:24,910
Where do I land?

2154
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:25,390
Where do I land?

2155
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:26,610
Go above.

2156
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:27,790
Above probably is the best.

2157
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:28,010
Cover.

2158
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,990
I can't believe it.

2159
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,210
Everybody's running sniper.

2160
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:34,910
Yeah, it's just normal.

2161
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,690
I can smoke your box later so you can take your shit.

2162
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:37,990
Okay.

2163
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:39,690
Did we lose this spot?

2164
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:40,310
We didn't, right?

2165
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,350
I don't see anyone here.

2166
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:43,170
Oh, here I am.

2167
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:47,810
I don't even know if I can... Yeah, I'll smoke your box later.

2168
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:49,010
Okay.

2169
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:50,150
I think I got these walls.

2170
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,570
Yeah, yeah, I got... Oh, there's landing.

2171
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,430
They're landing on the house.

2172
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:53,130
They're landing on the house.

2173
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:54,470
One team landing.

2174
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:54,870
Yeah.

2175
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:55,190
Okay.

2176
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:55,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2177
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:58,350
Yeah, okay.

2178
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:58,930
We can get that.

2179
01:08:58,930 --> 01:08:59,070
I'm well-kept out.

2180
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:00,270
I'm not teaming up here.

2181
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:00,290
Fuck this.

2182
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,370
I'm gonna run sniper next game.

2183
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:01,990
Yeah, I see him.

2184
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:02,430
There's blue armor.

2185
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:04,650
This guy's alone, I think.

2186
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:05,590
One is B.

2187
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:06,490
Yeah.

2188
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,430
Dude, I can't... Like, I can't hit her because she's teleporting.

2189
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,090
I'm gonna scan behind us.

2190
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:17,650
Fuck, that's a loot box of juice.

2191
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:20,570
That loot box is juice.

2192
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:21,750
I want it.

2193
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:22,990
Cover me.

2194
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:23,630
No.

2195
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,870
Uh... Okay.

2196
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:26,950
Okay, okay.

2197
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,290
Thank you.

2198
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,090
I'll stay up here.

2199
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:32,790
I'll stay up here, guys.

2200
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:35,090
I'm just a little baby.

2201
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:35,430
Holy shit, three bats.

2202
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,170
I need ammo, ammo.

2203
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:38,970
Heavy ammo.

2204
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:39,850
I need sub 2.

2205
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,530
There's no heavy ammo.

2206
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,370
There's only light ammo.

2207
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:42,270
Okay.

2208
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,270
I have seven bats.

2209
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,170
I can give bats.

2210
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:45,770
Okay, yeah.

2211
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:46,250
I know that.

2212
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:46,990
I wanna cross ammo.

2213
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,990
Can I cross ammo there?

2214
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,150
I don't think you can, Dito.

2215
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,190
You might die.

2216
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:52,870
Maybe if I give you some.

2217
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,310
Doki, Doki, three bats right here.

2218
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,290
Yeah, I'll take it.

2219
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:55,610
You need cells?

2220
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:56,810
Here's four cells as well.

2221
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:57,350
Yeah.

2222
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:59,230
Wait, is someone zipping behind us?

2223
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:01,490
Yeah, they are.

2224
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:01,990
They're above.

2225
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:02,370
They're above.

2226
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:04,430
They literally came up when I dropped down.

2227
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:05,990
That's fucked up.

2228
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,310
You have to play for me.

2229
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:07,830
You have to play for me.

2230
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:08,870
Oh my god, that's fucked up.

2231
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,110
I literally got over here.

2232
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:11,230
I got over here.

2233
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,430
These guys are gonna get bullied by everyone, so it's fine.

2234
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:15,850
How is he seeing?

2235
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:16,950
Purple armor.

2236
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:20,030
I'm so sad.

2237
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,610
I literally got off just for the...

2238
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:25,390
Literally, we gotta hyper focus that team.

2239
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:30,570
For that loot box over there, is there attachments in that box or no?

2240
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:31,450
Is there attachments in that box or no?

2241
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:32,410
Yeah, like 301 attachments.

2242
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:33,690
Oh, 301?

2243
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:34,990
I can smoke it if you want.

2244
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:35,730
Oh, no.

2245
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:36,030
I'm fine.

2246
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:36,250
I'm fine.

2247
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:38,010
Wait, is there a scope in there or no?

2248
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:39,350
Probably.

2249
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:39,910
Yeah, two times.

2250
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:40,670
Yeah, I need it.

2251
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:40,930
I need it.

2252
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:41,550
Can you smoke it?

2253
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:42,210
Alright.

2254
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,830
Okay, we gotta only watch this team behind us.

2255
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,710
This team literally has to push us or they die.

2256
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,250
Or they have to go below.

2257
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:53,290
So this team is like hyper priority right now.

2258
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:54,870
They're getting Crypt ulted.

2259
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,790
Okay, I got him.

2260
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:56,050
Okay.

2261
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:57,290
These guys got Crypt ulted.

2262
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:57,690
What the fuck?

2263
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:58,990
Why?

2264
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,430
I think it's just to get griefed.

2265
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:04,670
I don't know.

2266
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:05,990
I think it's just to get griefed.

2267
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:05,990
I don't know.

2268
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,230
I'm running.

2269
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:06,790
Purple armor.

2270
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:07,770
I'm gonna run low and heavy again.

2271
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:12,450
I can give you my heavy and I'm gonna swap to Carbine if you want that.

2272
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:13,730
Actually, wait.

2273
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,050
No, there's no light ammo in there.

2274
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,510
Never mind.

2275
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:16,890
There was 200.

2276
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:18,750
Can you smoke the...

2277
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,390
the replicator?

2278
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,910
20 seconds.

2279
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,410
20 seconds.

2280
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:26,350
We gotta keep looking this team behind us, guys.

2281
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:27,610
Okay.

2282
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:28,050
I'm looking.

2283
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:28,850
I'm looking.

2284
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:29,170
I'm looking.

2285
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:29,410
I'm looking.

2286
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:29,650
I'm looking.

2287
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:29,910
I'm looking.

2288
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:30,070
I'm looking.

2289
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:30,310
I'm looking.

2290
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:30,310
I'm looking.

2291
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:35,770
I'm looking.

2292
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,080
I can scan the replicator, but I don't know if you wanna go or what.

2293
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,280
Alright, you're gonna smoke it?

2294
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:44,640
Smoke it.

2295
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,000
Smoke it.

2296
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:45,580
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2297
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,560
I smoked it if you wanna build ammo.

2298
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,220
Up to you.

2299
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:50,240
Do you wanna do it?

2300
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,320
Keep looking at this.

2301
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:52,920
What is that smoke?

2302
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,360
What the fuck am I watching?

2303
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,980
Okay, I'm gonna see if I can swap to Carbine then with Ditto.

2304
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:01,320
Just make sure you craft ammo and then come back.

2305
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,240
Both of you craft ammo.

2306
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,020
There's a team in front of us!

2307
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:03,660
There's a team in front of us!

2308
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:04,460
I'm backing up.

2309
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:04,580
I'm backing up.

2310
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:06,520
I'm back.

2311
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:06,900
I'm back.

2312
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,080
I'm back.

2313
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:07,480
I'm back.

2314
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:07,640
I'm back.

2315
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:07,800
I'm back.

2316
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:08,440
I cracked one.

2317
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:08,820
I cracked one.

2318
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,480
You're fine, you're fine.

2319
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,100
Okay, just keep watching this team behind us.

2320
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:14,480
I'm gonna...

2321
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,380
smoke and I'm gonna ult them...

2322
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,760
when they push.

2323
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,280
I'm ulting now.

2324
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,840
I'm standing behind us.

2325
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,400
Just watch them.

2326
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,280
Just literally watch them.

2327
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,680
What about the team behind us?

2328
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,120
That team behind us, yes.

2329
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,840
Just watch them, the team above.

2330
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,060
Okay, I'm looking.

2331
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:32,780
I'm watching.

2332
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,920
I keep beaming them.

2333
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,600
There's a team in bridge shooting at us.

2334
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,620
They're getting pushed by zone now.

2335
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,200
Look, look, look.

2336
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,760
I'm looking, I'm looking.

2337
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:44,700
Purple armors.

2338
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,060
They're banging with us.

2339
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,240
I'm going to bloodhound.

2340
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,080
I see them.

2341
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,340
Scan them when you can.

2342
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,840
Inside here is free.

2343
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:53,780
Scan, scan, scan.

2344
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,380
Okay, dodged.

2345
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,280
I got hit by that?

2346
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:57,760
Really?

2347
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:59,700
Okay, I got hit.

2348
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,400
I almost got beamed on.

2349
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,920
Team on the left, team on the left looking at us too.

2350
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,500
Just focus on this team only.

2351
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,940
Focus on this team only in front of us.

2352
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,060
They're still here.

2353
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,260
I cracked them, I cracked them.

2354
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:11,960
I cracked Horizon.

2355
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,040
I got a bat.

2356
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,080
This is not their crypto.

2357
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,060
This is not their ult.

2358
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,340
Yeah, I'm batting, I'm batting too.

2359
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,660
I scan, I scan, I scan.

2360
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,700
Just focus team in front.

2361
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,460
Focus this team in front.

2362
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,020
I'm focusing.

2363
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,380
They're all cracked, bro.

2364
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:24,940
Yeah.

2365
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,020
Flash, flash, flash.

2366
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:30,620
Oh, fuck.

2367
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:31,260
My game.

2368
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,400
All dead, all dead.

2369
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,720
But another team behind us maybe.

2370
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:34,900
My game all tabbed.

2371
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:36,500
What?

2372
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:39,540
One dead.

2373
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,940
I got green.

2374
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,960
My game all tabbed for some reason.

2375
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,260
Did play on me, Ditto.

2376
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,380
There's still more in front.

2377
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,220
I'm so sad.

2378
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,160
I got the heal, I got the heal.

2379
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,260
I got the heal.

2380
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,220
I told you.

2381
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:57,720
Yeah, but it's...

2382
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,860
Don't worry, Sneak.

2383
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,380
Yeah, my game actually all tabbed.

2384
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,380
Bullshit man.

2385
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,400
Holy shit.

2386
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:05,920
I'm shooting at a guy.

2387
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,680
There's nothing happening to him.

2388
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,240
Can you tell them to just swap?

2389
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,580
Maybe swap servers.

2390
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,760
I don't think it's a server thing.

2391
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:14,480
I'm not sure.

2392
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:15,540
Just stay alive.

2393
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,140
Just play your life.

2394
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,280
There's two guys in front of you, Ditto.

2395
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,560
Yeah, just play your life, Ditto.

2396
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,260
Just rat, just rat.

2397
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,060
Yeah, just play below.

2398
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,400
They're probably gonna fight each other.

2399
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:24,900
You'll be free.

2400
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,540
Yeah, there was a team true below us in the earlier so careful.

2401
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:31,520
Okay.

2402
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:31,700
Okay.

2403
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:32,180
Yeah.

2404
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,320
Just play slow here.

2405
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,060
Maybe you can go close to the truck.

2406
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,580
I'll save that.

2407
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:36,520
Later.

2408
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,580
I like this spot's energy.

2409
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:37,780
Let's go.

2410
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:41,900
I think left side, all the way left side, if you walk with zone, you should be okay.

2411
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:42,820
Left side?

2412
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:44,680
Yeah, like there.

2413
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,800
I don't know how I...

2414
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,620
I don't know why it suddenly tabbed out.

2415
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:48,360
It was crazy.

2416
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,520
Maybe click the alt to the left?

2417
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,580
Or maybe...

2418
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,200
No, my game suddenly tabbed out of nowhere.

2419
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,300
Yeah, that cliff maybe, Tito?

2420
01:14:59,420 --> 01:14:59,900
Is that in?

2421
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:00,900
Right in front of you?

2422
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:04,840
Yeah.

2423
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,120
Oh, hey.

2424
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,160
Maybe...

2425
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:06,960
What about left side?

2426
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:09,800
Right here.

2427
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,320
Not in.

2428
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,180
Not in.

2429
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,120
Yeah, she's not in.

2430
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:13,960
She's also in zone now.

2431
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,880
Play behind the truck.

2432
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,100
Right there.

2433
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:16,940
Oh, right side, right side.

2434
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:17,520
Push the right side.

2435
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,400
Nice.

2436
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:19,640
Nice.

2437
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,060
Good kill.

2438
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:20,720
Someone's in truck.

2439
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,960
Just play behind the truck.

2440
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,080
Just crouch behind the truck.

2441
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,280
Yeah.

2442
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,480
Seal their door.

2443
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,200
Seal their door.

2444
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:26,440
Oh.

2445
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:28,600
It's okay.

2446
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:30,500
She's fine.

2447
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,700
When you seal their door though...

2448
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,200
Yeah.

2449
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:34,920
Oh, no!

2450
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,440
No, no.

2451
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,360
You forgot to lock it.

2452
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,060
You forgot to lock it.

2453
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:39,340
What?

2454
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:40,620
Unlock it.

2455
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:41,740
No, you open.

2456
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,520
No, they opened the door when you sealed it.

2457
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,960
So you have to close it again.

2458
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,520
They opened it before she stole it.

2459
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:46,900
I see.

2460
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,840
Only one guy.

2461
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:49,700
Yeah.

2462
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:51,860
No way.

2463
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:52,920
That's one guy.

2464
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,120
We got top five.

2465
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,400
We're always top five.

2466
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:57,340
Oh my god.

2467
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:57,580
Oh my god.

2468
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,680
I'm fighting a Bloodhound.

2469
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,300
And I'm shooting Havok at him.

2470
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,780
And there's no numbers coming out of my house.

2471
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,000
There's nothing.

2472
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,360
Is it because you're streaming?

2473
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,720
Maybe at this time when you're streaming and...

2474
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,000
No, because it was happening off stream as well.

2475
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,580
So I don't think it's a stream thing.

2476
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:14,880
That's weird.

2477
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,700
We're consistent, guys.

2478
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:23,680
It's the pink corner because I didn't see the door open.

2479
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:25,540
Yeah.

2480
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,140
My stream is not dropping any frames.

2481
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,280
It's not lagging.

2482
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,640
Like, it's perfectly fine.

2483
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:31,020
That's so weird.

2484
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,280
By the way, I'm not sure if you can see it.

2485
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,060
Discord is also perfectly fine.

2486
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:33,200
Yeah.

2487
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,440
It's just a game.

2488
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,840
The game is just fucking lagging.

2489
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:36,120
I don't know.

2490
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,860
Maybe it's Apex.

2491
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:38,260
I don't know.

2492
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,020
Oh my god.

2493
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,660
A person is getting beat.

2494
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:46,580
Or maybe it's your VPN.

2495
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,900
It's pretty much the same shit with our VPN.

2496
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,700
It's just more pink.

2497
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,060
You're shooting North America.

2498
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:57,880
Not that line.

2499
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:58,040
Yeah.

2500
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,180
It's North America.

2501
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,240
I am on North America.

2502
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,400
Oh.

2503
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,920
How was the first game?

2504
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:05,820
First game?

2505
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:06,320
First game was fine.

2506
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:07,940
First game...

2507
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:10,020
How about you change to Dallas again?

2508
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,440
I can.

2509
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:12,840
Yeah.

2510
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,380
That's so weird.

2511
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,740
I wonder why you're having these problems.

2512
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:22,620
I don't know.

2513
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:23,680
It might be my shitty ass stream.

2514
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:23,920
Are you doing like...

2515
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,360
Does it only happen during like our tournament thing?

2516
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,440
Or was it...

2517
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,200
Because it was okay.

2518
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:28,840
No.

2519
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,800
It was happening during my...

2520
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,020
Like when I was playing ranked during stream, it was happening too.

2521
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,940
At least I might won, I think.

2522
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,120
Look at him.

2523
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:37,360
Look at him.

2524
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:37,600
Just focus on him.

2525
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,460
Fucking bunny hopping.

2526
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:38,880
Just shoot back.

2527
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:38,980
Oh my God.

2528
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:39,220
Moving.

2529
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,660
Why is he just moving?

2530
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:44,960
Maybe he didn't have reloaded.

2531
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:46,640
Oh.

2532
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,260
Is there 1v1?

2533
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:47,800
Is there 1v1?

2534
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,320
This could be a 1v1.

2535
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:49,440
Yeah.

2536
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,180
I think this is a 1v1.

2537
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:51,680
If they're not...

2538
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,460
He's not getting pushed.

2539
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:53,580
No.

2540
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:53,740
It's 1v1.

2541
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,240
They're not?

2542
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,600
Why were they so scared?

2543
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,820
Why was he so scared?

2544
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,980
Let me try switching movement again.

2545
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,400
Okay.

2546
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:11,780
Guys,

2547
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:15,960
yay!

2548
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:16,700
Top 5!

2549
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,560
Again!

2550
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,120
We're consistent.

2551
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,060
We keep getting top 5 with no kills because I can't kill anyone!

2552
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,920
We got 4 kills!

2553
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:28,140
Oh, did we?

2554
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:28,500
Okay.

2555
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,440
Yeah, we got 4 kills.

2556
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,520
That's something!

2557
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:35,660
But I could have killed both of those guys there if he wasn't just teleporting!

2558
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:42,020
Shooting a whole hell clip and nothing comes out, dude.

2559
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:42,940
It's so stupid.

2560
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:53,080
Also, I think he needs to keep changing the code because I think the server gets laggy over time.

2561
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,500
Oh, let him know that.

2562
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,400
I don't think he has more codes.

2563
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,160
I think he only has one.

2564
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,390
Wait, this is a custom code?

2565
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:07,750
I'm pretty sure this is literally just a random server code.

2566
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:08,490
Yeah, it's a custom code.

2567
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:10,350
Oh, from Apex?

2568
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:15,230
Yeah, it starts with a P. Random server code starts with a C.

2569
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:16,990
But why would he...

2570
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:18,650
Does it matter?

2571
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:21,890
Does it matter though?

2572
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:26,610
If you get a code from EA, it's higher quality because it's a dedicated server.

2573
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:27,210
Oh.

2574
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:29,170
I see.

2575
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:32,530
And I'm guessing he only got one code because...

2576
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:34,070
Yeah.

2577
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,450
15 minutes!

2578
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:38,590
15 minutes!

2579
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:40,950
What am I gonna do for 15 minutes?

2580
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:44,390
Oh yeah, there's a 15... because they're gonna interview the top five teams.

2581
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,530
So we gotta chill for 15 minutes.

2582
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:49,170
Why would you do it mid-turny?

2583
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:50,850
Why would you do it after the turny?

2584
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,750
Yeah, wait, why can't you just do it... you're right though.

2585
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:56,750
This should be the end of the turn.

2586
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:56,850
What the fuck?

2587
01:19:56,850 --> 01:19:58,690
Why are we mid-turny interviewing?

2588
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,570
Like, what are...

2589
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:01,830
They gotta pad it!

2590
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:03,410
They gotta pad the tournament!

2591
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,190
I think...

2592
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:06,830
I think...

2593
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:09,610
They better... okay.

2594
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:11,730
That means... I guess like... they're not...

2595
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:11,910
Did they lie?

2596
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:13,390
Did they see me?

2597
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:14,070
Yeah, yeah.

2598
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:14,910
I mean... yeah.

2599
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,310
They should.

2600
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:20,370
They should be.

2601
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:20,950
Oh shit.

2602
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,210
Why would they interview me?

2603
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,470
So I can tell them their server sucks?

2604
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:25,770
Do it.

2605
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:27,450
We're not top five.

2606
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,590
We're not top five though.

2607
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:29,530
We're top six.

2608
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:31,370
Good.

2609
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:32,190
Thank God.

2610
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:32,690
No interview.

2611
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:34,870
That's my plan.

2612
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:37,610
Midway, the first three games, top six.

2613
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:38,550
So they're gonna interview it.

2614
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,770
And then you win the last three games.

2615
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,250
Oh, haven't we won a game?

2616
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:45,970
We don't lie.

2617
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:47,970
Are you seriously asking that or...

2618
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:51,530
I mean, you like...

2619
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,650
RPR, why haven't we won a... I thought we're TSM.

2620
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:55,690
I don't know, Doki.

2621
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,070
It's kind of hard to win two or three, you know?

2622
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:02,850
Like when someone... when Artemia dies on a roof, Artemia dies on a... on a wall.

2623
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:04,050
It's like...

2624
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:05,570
Wait, who died on the wall?

2625
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,470
Who died on the wall?

2626
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:17,950
Jesus Christ died reincarnated on the wall.

2627
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:19,510
What do you think died on the wall?

2628
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:21,450
I know it wasn't me.

2629
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:22,450
You have selective memory?

2630
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:23,750
I know it wasn't me.

2631
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:26,490
Okay, stop the cat.

2632
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:29,790
Selective memory looking ass.

2633
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:32,530
I contributed.

2634
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:38,630
Thank God we're exactly six, so no interview.

2635
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:42,190
Yeah, we don't have to talk to people, but then you have to talk to me.

2636
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:44,390
Fuck.

2637
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:46,570
Yeah, which is better, right?

2638
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:48,470
Yeah.

2639
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:49,590
Yeah, yippee.

2640
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:50,950
So much better.

2641
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:54,290
It's like so much better.

2642
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,550
Yeah, I think we should change our comp.

2643
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:57,170
No.

2644
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:57,890
Why?

2645
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,330
We didn't get first.

2646
01:21:59,530 --> 01:21:59,890
I think you don't get a...

2647
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:02,590
I don't think you get an input on comp.

2648
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:04,790
But like we didn't get first though.

2649
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:08,330
But both of you have lost your ability to put...

2650
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:09,870
input anything about the comp.

2651
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:12,810
Just gonna put that out there.

2652
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:17,410
Both of you have lost that ability.

2653
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:19,350
I no longer listen to you.

2654
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:20,090
I am the captain.

2655
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:21,370
Okay.

2656
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:22,470
I found a mainstream.

2657
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:24,270
I'm gonna change.

2658
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,050
I'm gonna watch the main stream.

2659
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:26,610
The main stream.

2660
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,650
We're gonna check out the interviews.

2661
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:35,070
I'm surprised they're interviewing five different teams.

2662
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:37,030
That's like a lot of teams.

2663
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:37,450
Why?

2664
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:40,350
Shouldn't it be like three?

2665
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:41,810
Cause like who cares?

2666
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:44,290
Who cares when somebody is like top five?

2667
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,730
Like rank four and five.

2668
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,810
They should just interview you though, Ki-Ling.

2669
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:48,750
Honestly, true.

2670
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:49,850
They should just interview me.

2671
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:50,850
I'm the most important.

2672
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,470
Your stream needs to know what you said before.

2673
01:22:59,130 --> 01:22:59,490
You're so true.

2674
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:01,290
You know what she said?

2675
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,350
You know what she said before she started streaming?

2676
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:03,530
Yeah, what did I say before?

2677
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:07,950
She was like, Arpiel you shouldn't stream so I can get all the viewers.

2678
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,410
And I was like, you don't have enough viewers.

2679
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:12,430
And she was like, I want your viewers too.

2680
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:12,430
No, no, no.

2681
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:13,490
He's twisting the story.

2682
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:16,110
Because he literally was like, I don't wanna stream.

2683
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,310
That's what he said to us.

2684
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,790
He was like, I don't wanna stream.

2685
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:19,850
And I was like, oh I should.

2686
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,010
Okay, then don't stream.

2687
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:22,070
That's good.

2688
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,530
So then I can keep all the viewers.

2689
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:26,850
No, you said, I don't wanna stream.

2690
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:28,530
You literally said, I don't wanna stream.

2691
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:29,630
Stop lying.

2692
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:30,830
I am not lying.

2693
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:32,970
They don't record this conversation.

2694
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:34,090
And you should like...

2695
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:35,710
No, no, actually, actually.

2696
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,470
I will say exactly what I said.

2697
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,230
I said, do we have to stream?

2698
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,730
And you said, you don't have to.

2699
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:43,570
We have to stream.

2700
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,790
Quote on quote, I don't wanna stream.

2701
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:49,250
No, no.

2702
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:50,790
No, that's it.

2703
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,790
Quote on quote, I don't wanna stream.

2704
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:53,810
No, it's not.

2705
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:56,050
I said, do we have to stream?

2706
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:56,590
With that intonation?

2707
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:00,810
Okay, if I was like, do we have to stream?

2708
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,710
If I said it with that intonation.

2709
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:04,370
It's just a question.

2710
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:05,850
If I said it with that intonation.

2711
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,590
Everyone will know that I don't wanna stream.

2712
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,130
You said it with that intonation.

2713
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:11,610
That's not how it works you guys.

2714
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:13,530
Let me finish my sentence.

2715
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:15,030
I said, do we have to stream?

2716
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,450
Doki said, you don't have to if you don't want to.

2717
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:18,650
I said, I'm gonna stream now.

2718
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:21,050
But you don't have to.

2719
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:23,130
And then I was like, why?

2720
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,150
But I'm gonna stream.

2721
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:25,650
And she's like, I want all the viewers.

2722
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,350
I said, you have enough viewers.

2723
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:29,130
She said, I want your viewers too.

2724
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:31,890
Quote for quote.

2725
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:33,330
Ditto, who's right?

2726
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:36,730
Am I right or RP are right?

2727
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:38,630
Ditto, who's right?

2728
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:42,270
Do you wanna hear my answer RP?

2729
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:42,850
Yeah.

2730
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,150
You're gonna betray me again.

2731
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:45,530
It's okay.

2732
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,130
I'm asking.

2733
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:51,730
It's okay because everything was recorded on Ditto's stream.

2734
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:56,750
So whatever you say, everyone is gonna know that you guys are lying.

2735
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:59,230
No, everyone would know I'm fucking right.

2736
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:02,230
I've never lied in my fucking life.

2737
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:04,470
That's true.

2738
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,080
That's the first lie.

2739
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,880
I'm the most honest man in this universe.

2740
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,440
That's already the first lie.

2741
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:14,800
Maybe in two universes.

2742
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,500
You're not the most honest man in the universe.

2743
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:18,820
What did I say?

2744
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,000
You're more honest than fucking Jesus?

2745
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:22,620
Yes.

2746
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:26,300
I'm the reincarnation of Jesus Christ in Apex Legends.

2747
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:31,400
Reincarnation of Jesus Christ who lives in Eastern Europe.

2748
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,840
Reincarnation of Jesus Christ who lives in Eastern Europe.

2749
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,120
I've never lied in my life.

2750
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,760
I would never fucking lie.

2751
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:36,100
That's so fucking cap.

2752
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,660
That's so fucking cap.

2753
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,400
Ask me anything, I won't lie.

2754
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:42,960
How much do you earn per month?

2755
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,800
How much do you earn per month?

2756
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:45,900
NBA.

2757
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,400
NBA, I can tell you.

2758
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:47,540
NBA, I can tell you.

2759
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:51,160
That's not an NBA.

2760
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:52,460
That's not an NBA.

2761
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:53,660
That's literally not a lie.

2762
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,040
That's not an NBA.

2763
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,020
I literally can't tell you.

2764
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,420
Who the fuck you signed a contract with?

2765
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,040
Yourself?

2766
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,320
It's literally your own earnings overall.

2767
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,880
My fucking esports org.

2768
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,540
What do you mean?

2769
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:04,900
You guys said overall.

2770
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,220
That includes everything, not just your esports earnings.

2771
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:12,320
Which also includes my salary, which I can't talk about.

2772
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:12,560
Which also includes my salary, which I can't talk about.

2773
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,260
Okay, minus your esports org.

2774
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,140
Okay, how much do you earn per month?

2775
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,480
How much do you... I asked the question first.

2776
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:18,860
I don't know.

2777
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,040
I never said I never lie.

2778
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,740
Since it's that easy to answer that NBA question.

2779
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:24,360
Okay, I'm a liar.

2780
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,200
I'm a liar.

2781
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:25,780
I can lie.

2782
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,740
We all know you're a liar.

2783
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,200
You're just proving my point.

2784
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:29,960
We all know you're a liar.

2785
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:29,960
You're just proving my point.

2786
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:33,040
Yeah, but I'm trying to prove my point.

2787
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,720
That you said you never lie.

2788
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:35,680
Then fucking tell the truth.

2789
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:37,220
How much do you earn every month?

2790
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,920
I'm not going to lose my job because of you.

2791
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,900
Just minus your esports earnings.

2792
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,800
With all your esports earnings, how much do you earn?

2793
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,180
With my esports earnings?

2794
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:47,200
I mean, what are they?

2795
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,440
Like 150k or something?

2796
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,160
Without your esports earnings?

2797
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,100
For a month?

2798
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,020
Without my esports earnings?

2799
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:54,580
Yeah.

2800
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,180
I don't fucking know.

2801
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:57,840
Like...

2802
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,380
Around 2k-ish?

2803
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:00,880
I don't know.

2804
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,420
2k-ish without esports?

2805
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:07,160
And then 150k is overall?

2806
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,500
And then 150k is overall?

2807
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,540
We're talking about esports earnings.

2808
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:11,620
My esports earnings...

2809
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:14,040
I've earned 150k in my career.

2810
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,060
No, I meant like with...

2811
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,660
I meant your esports org.

2812
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,320
I can't tell you that.

2813
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,640
I can't tell you that.

2814
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:21,140
What do you want?

2815
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:22,800
Minus your esports org.

2816
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,860
What's your current salary per month?

2817
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:27,320
Earnings.

2818
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:27,740
I told you.

2819
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:29,580
I literally told you.

2820
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,120
2k?

2821
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:32,240
I told you around.

2822
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:33,980
Around 2k?

2823
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:35,760
Without esports?

2824
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,760
Yeah, because it depends on the month.

2825
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,780
Oh, okay.

2826
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,860
So on Twitch you earn 2k a month.

2827
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,140
And other shit.

2828
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,440
Wait, what's other shit?

2829
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,300
Sponsors.

2830
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,060
What are you asking me?

2831
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:46,740
What kind?

2832
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,400
I don't know when you get a sponsor.

2833
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,220
Well now we know...

2834
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:54,880
Look, Seekchat.

2835
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,620
Now we know his Twitch earnings.

2836
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,140
And sponsors.

2837
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:01,680
You could have calculated yourself.

2838
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,320
How could I?

2839
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,660
You fucking said NDA.

2840
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:06,220
Yeah.

2841
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,000
You can see my sub count.

2842
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,400
But you can't see my salary that's NDA'd.

2843
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,480
You don't even have a sub count.

2844
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,240
There's literally no sub count on your fucking stream.

2845
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,420
I have your stream open.

2846
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:18,580
It's under my stream.

2847
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,480
Where?

2848
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,620
Oh, there it is.

2849
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:22,940
There's a sub goal.

2850
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,680
Guys, I saw it.

2851
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,180
It's public info.

2852
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,280
Guys, it is public info.

2853
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,000
He was right.

2854
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,520
He doesn't lie.

2855
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,240
Ditto, what question do you want to ask RPR?

2856
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,160
Why do you only want to know about money?

2857
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,300
You could have asked about anything.

2858
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,560
And you focused on money.

2859
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,900
You could have asked me anything in the world.

2860
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:51,160
To be honest about it.

2861
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,980
Then what do I ask you?

2862
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:52,880
I don't know.

2863
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:55,000
I ask you about money.

2864
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,640
Are you a minhara?

2865
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,620
I would say about 25% minhara.

2866
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,220
And as this conversation keeps going, the number is increasing.

2867
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,720
I mean, it's obvious he's a minhara.

2868
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,940
I think you are the 100% minhara right now.

2869
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,780
Like 100% minhara.

2870
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:13,700
Right now.

2871
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,280
No, I'm 25.

2872
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,560
But if you keep talking, it's going to go up.

2873
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,280
Do you like Doki?

2874
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:25,620
What?

2875
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,000
She's okay.

2876
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,480
Do you like Doki?

2877
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,300
Yeah.

2878
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,420
Am I a good person?

2879
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,280
Yeah, you're okay.

2880
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,260
No, I asked you if you like Doki.

2881
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,520
Am I a good person?

2882
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,480
Not she's okay.

2883
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,140
Yeah, I said yeah, she's okay.

2884
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:45,580
Yeah, yeah.

2885
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,420
She's going to get an ego.

2886
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,260
She's going to get an ego from it.

2887
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:52,940
No, I'm not.

2888
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,020
No, I'm not.

2889
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,640
No, I'm not.

2890
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,440
No, because I already know.

2891
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,900
I already know I'm amazing.

2892
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,380
You're not the most narcissistic person I know.

2893
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,780
Doki, I'm your best friend.

2894
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:07,780
He is.

2895
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,020
He's a minhara friend.

2896
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:10,580
I'm literally not a friend.

2897
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,500
He is.

2898
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:18,140
He always talks about how he hates being here.

2899
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,720
But every time I ask him to do a tournament, he says yes.

2900
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,200
Yeah, yeah.

2901
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:23,520
Because I bring in the content.

2902
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,140
I gotta bring in the content for you.

2903
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,440
Who's going to bring in the content?

2904
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,580
I'm literally a content machine.

2905
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:30,960
Content machine.

2906
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:33,860
I'm a content machine.

2907
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,720
What about Ditto?

2908
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:37,660
Yeah, he...

2909
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:38,180
Yeah.

2910
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:45,400
When we play DT together, and when I ask him for money, he always sends me money.

2911
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:48,740
Even if he told me that he didn't want to give me money.

2912
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:49,320
Wait, really?

2913
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,340
Can I have some money?

2914
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,760
I don't send her money.

2915
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,680
She's literally lying.

2916
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,340
Can I have some money?

2917
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:01,300
Ditto, you make like probably 10 times more than me.

2918
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,900
Like what more do you want from me?

2919
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,000
Like you give me money.

2920
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,640
How about you give me some subs?

2921
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:08,400
Wait, why are you asking us for money?

2922
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:10,240
Why are you begging for us?

2923
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:10,980
Because I mean it.

2924
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,200
I literally need it.

2925
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:12,500
I literally need money.

2926
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,660
You make like 2k a month.

2927
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,100
Don't talk about my salary.

2928
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,860
2k is like an estimate.

2929
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,400
Like some months it's lower, sometimes it's higher.

2930
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,380
You know how Twitch works.

2931
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:30,460
Yeah, but you also have your esports salary that you won't tell us.

2932
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:31,480
So it's more.

2933
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:37,300
Esports salary that may I add that I'm still not receiving because I haven't moved to Japan by the way.

2934
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,180
Yeah, that's your own issue.

2935
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:42,540
That's your own issue.

2936
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,880
Now that's a visa issue.

2937
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:45,620
That's true.

2938
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,460
You can move at any...

2939
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:51,060
Technically you can sort of start living there.

2940
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,260
How would they know?

2941
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:03,400
Ditto I think for all the content I create here you should give me some subs for real.

2942
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,920
No, you should give us subs for giving you content.

2943
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,620
You should give us subs for giving you content.

2944
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:12,780
Because we're asking the hard questions here.

2945
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,300
Like can we end this intermission?

2946
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:16,480
I already had enough of you guys.

2947
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,280
Can we get some primes in the chat for this bullshit?

2948
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:20,640
Can we get some primes in the chat for this bullshit?

2949
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:23,940
Yeah, so you go to search my name up on Twitch.

2950
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,640
DokiBird at Twitch.

2951
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,380
And you can start a hype train over there.

2952
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:27,900
You're so greedy.

2953
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:28,960
How am I greedy?

2954
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:32,040
You're literally greedy.

2955
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,540
Like you're literally greedy.

2956
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,980
Like you're the greediest person I know.

2957
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,700
How am I greedy?

2958
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,600
How am I greedy?

2959
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:41,520
Did you see what you just did?

2960
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,340
What did I do?

2961
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:46,120
I just said can I get some primes in my chat.

2962
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:49,620
You're like go to DokiBird Twitch and start a hype train there instead.

2963
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,400
Like what is your problem?

2964
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:52,040
I said instead.

2965
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,320
Let other people eat too.

2966
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,120
Let other people eat too.

2967
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,480
Holy shit.

2968
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:59,460
Let us eat too.

2969
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,440
I said if you want to it's your choice.

2970
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:04,800
Let me eat too.

2971
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,280
Woah RP.

2972
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,160
Why are you so mad?

2973
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,340
Relax bro.

2974
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:19,720
If you're mad you can be IG of for the next match.

2975
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:24,400
You have to calm down or you might lose your hair.

2976
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,240
You're gonna start molding.

2977
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,560
You're gonna start molding.

2978
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,980
I have the most foolish head of hair on the planet.

2979
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,840
Like I literally will never lose hair.

2980
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:35,900
True.

2981
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,980
I'm like I have so much fucking hair I could donate.

2982
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:41,200
Do it.

2983
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:47,540
I mean I'm gonna go to get a haircut on Monday so my donate everything gets off me.

2984
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:47,980
Yeah.

2985
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,900
I'm going for really short.

2986
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:53,300
How many subs for you to shave your entire head?

2987
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,400
I'm not gonna shave my head.

2988
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:56,440
I did that before.

2989
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,400
Oh so you don't want money.

2990
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,760
He doesn't want money guys.

2991
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:08,440
Listen I am an honorable man that draws a line and will not sell my soul.

2992
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,600
He doesn't want money.

2993
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:12,040
To get myself embarrassed on the internet.

2994
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,460
Oh so what being bald is embarrassing?

2995
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:17,780
For me yeah.

2996
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,440
For me it is.

2997
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:21,840
He doesn't like bald people guys.

2998
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,060
He hates the bald.

2999
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,980
I think some people look amazing bald.

3000
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,320
I'm just not that guy.

3001
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,280
You don't know that.

3002
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:29,140
I don't look good bald.

3003
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:33,320
All I'm saying is.

3004
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:33,960
You've never been bald.

3005
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:34,420
Right?

3006
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,560
I have been bald before.

3007
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:38,320
You don't know me my entire life.

3008
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:42,640
You said you have a full head of hair and you'll never lose it.

3009
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,360
Oh thank you.

3010
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:47,860
Yes because I'm no longer cutting it all off.

3011
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:49,920
I'm twitch.

3012
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:50,700
You're insane.

3013
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,040
This is insane.

3014
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,400
This is not even a conversation.

3015
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,060
This is not even a conversation.

3016
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,040
Holy shit.

3017
01:34:58,580 --> 01:34:59,840
Bomb buying shot.

3018
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,180
50 gifted.

3019
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,400
Holy fuck.

3020
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:05,940
Bomb buy.

3021
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:06,880
Bomb buy.

3022
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,300
Dude I think he is like 100%.

3023
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:16,300

3024
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:17,980
Oh my god.

Up here.

3026
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:21,360
I think he's going crazy.

3027
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,500
Sorry I got nuclear bombed in chat.

3028
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,040
It was crazy.

3029
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:27,100
Oh hey I have hype train.

3030
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:27,780
Nuclear bomb buy.

3031
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,120
I'm almost close to hype train too guys.

3032
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,940
Holy fuck we got bomb buy.

3033
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:37,240
Oh my god.

3034
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,220
How do we survive?

3035
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,580
It was a nuclear bomb.

3036
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:44,780
I literally have...

3037
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,760
Listen Doki I've had about 100 chatters today.

3038
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,200
From your chat.

3039
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,520
Come here and apologize in your stead.

3040
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:53,460
That's not true.

3041
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:55,840
They're like sorry that my orsh is the way she is.

3042
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:56,560
Oh yeah?

3043
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,500
In my chat I have people.

3044
01:35:59,500 --> 01:35:59,920
I never lie.

3045
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:04,180
In my chat I have people coming in my chat being like.

3046
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,680

He's crazy.

3048
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,020
They're absolutely right.

3049
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,020
They're absolutely right.

3050
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,940
I've lost the plot a long time ago.

3051
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:14,980
I never lie.

3052
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,940
You were like I would never apologize for Doki.

3053
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,960
And up here in chat.

3054
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:25,560
Always come to my steam and say.

3055
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:26,660
It's up here fault.

3056
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:28,500
It's okay it's up here fault.

3057
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,360
This is just like a blast to me that was created years ago.

3058
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:32,760
Oh hey.

3059
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,260
15 minute intermission is done.

3060
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,420
Our intermission is over.

3061
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,260
The 15 minute torture is done.

3062
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,200
Same comp?

3063
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:40,680
Yeah.

3064
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:45,080
They should call that shit 15 minute torture.

3065
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:47,260
Oh my god thank you for the hype train everybody.

3066
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,520
Thank you for the five gifted subs.

3067
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,140
To the Doki bird twitch.

3068
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,160
Really appreciate it.

3069
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,000
Guys wait.

3070
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:57,060
RPR what's your highest hype train?

3071
01:36:58,860 --> 01:36:59,960
Oh shit.

3072
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,480
How do I know that?

3073
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,960
I'm like maybe level 16 or something.

3074
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,620
Level 16?

3075
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:08,260
During my subathon.

3076
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,480
Oh it was during your subathon.

3077
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,860
Oh that makes sense.

3078
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,480
Why don't we land?

3079
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,800
I don't like honestly like.

3080
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,080
My community like.

3081
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,600
We don't have oilers and I'm fine with it.

3082
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:21,540
I'm not really money.

3083
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:23,280
I'm not a money hungry person in general.

3084
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,840
As long as I have enough to survive.

3085
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,900
Every month I'm chilling.

3086
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:30,900
I don't really care about being a millionaire or being rich as fuck.

3087
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:32,160
I just want to have fun.

3088
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:33,400
Live.

3089
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:34,700
Be alive.

3090
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:35,920
Buy food.

3091
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:39,580
Pay rent.

3092
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:43,600
As long as I can pay your money for my car share.

3093
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,280
Yeah.

3094
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,100
Okay wait.

3095
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:46,460
Wait a minute.

3096
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:50,140
Dude that's less honorable.

3097
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:59,260
As long as I can give this big corporation all my money that I earn with hard work every month.

3098
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,180
As long as I can get cosmetics for a gig.

3099
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:01,580
I'll be okay.

3100
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,140
I'll be okay.

3101
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:08,120
As long as I can give them all my money then.

3102
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,340
I'll be good.

3103
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:09,520
You know what?

3104
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:10,600
She's right.

3105
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,940
You can't judge her RPR.

3106
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:19,360
You spend money on Apex.

3107
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:19,740
I'm not judging.

3108
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:21,680
I don't tell you.

3109
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:22,560
You spend money.

3110
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,100
Yeah but you had.

3111
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:24,940
You did though.

3112
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:26,720
But okay.

3113
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:27,540
Hear me out.

3114
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,560
I was making money off the game.

3115
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:31,460
What Apex?

3116
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,140
I was making money off the game.

3117
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,380
That's why I don't judge you.

3118
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:41,240
By buying skins I was single handedly increasing my prize pool every tournament.

3119
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:42,880
You understand?

3120
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:46,180
So I was investing into my future by buying skins.

3121
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,240
Think about that.

3122
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,240
Think about that for a second.

3123
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,160
That's stupid.

3124
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:52,860
I did.

3125
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:53,660
I thought about it.

3126
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:54,220
That's stupid.

3127
01:38:57,220 --> 01:39:05,140
Why would you invest in the game when you can have other people invest in it?

3128
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:11,660
Because at a certain time in my life I was actually naive and believed that this game was going in a good direction.

3129
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,000
But you're still playing it.

3130
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,280
And I regret all of my choices.

3131
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:17,580
I'm only playing it because you invited me to this tournament.

3132
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,940
Yeah but you were playing it yesterday.

3133
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:21,660
Yeah but you were playing it yesterday.

3134
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:22,860
Yeah because I was practicing for the tournament.

3135
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,660
Yeah but you were playing before.

3136
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,180
Because that's how I am.

3137
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:25,200
I practice.

3138
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,700
But you played before I invited you.

3139
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,480
Because I had Apex Matsuri.

3140
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:31,000
And I knew that I had to practice.

3141
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,840
If you hate it so much why do you keep saying yes to Apex stuff?

3142
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:39,760
Because the only good thing is like playing tournaments in this game.

3143
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,600
Because the only fun thing in this game is tournaments.

3144
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,580
Because you're having fun with us.

3145
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:44,140
No.

3146
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:47,260
But you're saying that's the only good thing.

3147
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:50,840
Wait.

3148
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:52,720
Stop gaslighting me.

3149
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:53,360
Scan the zone.

3150
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:54,940
Okay.

3151
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,300
Oh I have to scan the zone.

3152
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:56,700
Oh I have to scan the zone.

3153
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:57,860
I'm busy.

3154
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:00,900
I scan the zone.

3155
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:02,960
I will scan the zone.

3156
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,620
I scan the zone.

3157
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:06,400
I scan the zone.

3158
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:08,400
Wait I want to crash though.

3159
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,420
I need 2-0-1.

3160
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:13,640
I need 2-0-1.

3161
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:14,740
Wee.

3162
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,300
Oh he is so tsundere.

3163
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,160
I know guys.

3164
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:21,560
Yeah he is tsundere.

3165
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:21,840
I know.

3166
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,560
He straight up was like...

3167
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:26,900
He straight up said you only enjoy playing Apex in tournaments.

3168
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,600
But then you're like not this one.

3169
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:29,800
There's no exceptions.

3170
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:30,540
Yeah because I'm lagging.

3171
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:33,660
Yeah but you were lagging in the last tournament too.

3172
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:35,580
No I wasn't.

3173
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:36,520
I wasn't lagging in Apex.

3174
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,940
Now you're just lagging.

3175
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,520
I'm not talking about this last one.

3176
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,060
I'm talking about the other last one.

3177
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,900
Which I wasn't also lagging in.

3178
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,880
There's a team in front of us.

3179
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,720
Okay I will scan the lane.

3180
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:50,320
I forgot.

3181
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:52,680
Yeah.

3182
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:54,420
Why are they here?

3183
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,020
Can we kill them?

3184
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,180
Yeah that's what I'm saying.

3185
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,340
Who the fuck do you think they are?

3186
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:00,760
They're in my fucking swamp.

3187
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,400
I don't know where they are.

3188
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,180
They disappeared.

3189
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:05,880
They're in my fucking swamp.

3190
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,460
I don't see them anymore though.

3191
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,720
Are they hiding in the... They're in the bowl.

3192
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,220
In the bowl?

3193
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,240
When did they get there?

3194
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,280
Oh my god.

3195
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:17,080
Wait we killed these guys I think.

3196
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,440
We have charge rifle.

3197
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,960
I have the charge rifle.

3198
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,020
I'm trying to find another sniper.

3199
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,000
I can't find one.

3200
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:24,780
Oh there's a longbow.

3201
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:25,360
Okay nevermind.

3202
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:25,760
I got it.

3203
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:29,280
Cause I was like I'm tired of all these other snipers.

3204
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:30,300
I want to snipe too.

3205
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,020
The zone is not here.

3206
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:33,680
Oh they're going left.

3207
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,500
I think we killed them here.

3208
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:37,640
They're going towards spiders.

3209
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,020
Oh I hit him real hard with the fucking nade.

3210
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:41,880
Look at this guy.

3211
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:44,800
I'm terrible.

3212
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,560
I'm actually terrible.

3213
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:48,940
I'm coming over.

3214
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,320
I need to be closer.

3215
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:51,380
I'm terrible.

3216
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,200
Don't talk to me.

3217
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:52,960
I don't want to talk to you.

3218
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,240
Oh that's the...

3219
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:55,580
I stunned two right behind.

3220
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,080
Okay I'm looking.

3221
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,260
Horizon low.

3222
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:00,500
Flash.

3223
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:00,740
Flash.

3224
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,020
Flash.

3225
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:02,000
Flash.

3226
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,160
Flash.

3227
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:02,300
Flash.

3228
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:02,720
I got him.

3229
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:03,000
Dead.

3230
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:03,480
Dead.

3231
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:03,800
Dead.

3232
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,600
I'm trying to thirst him.

3233
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:05,940
I'm going.

3234
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:06,620
I'm going.

3235
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:09,960
Thirst that motherfucker now.

3236
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:10,440
I'm trying to.

3237
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:10,940
I can't.

3238
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:11,200
I can't.

3239
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:13,900
They got three on you.

3240
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,400
Yeah I'm trying to destroy it.

3241
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,320
Yeah I'm just...

3242
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,740
They're all dead.

3243
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,240
Oh my god.

3244
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,260
Boba T lovers.

3245
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,220
Oh no we did this to them.

3246
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:24,860
Is that guy dead too on the left side?

3247
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:25,940
Yeah they're all fucking dead.

3248
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:26,540
He's here.

3249
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,360
I see them.

3250
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:27,920
They're on the right.

3251
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:28,600
That's a spider.

3252
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,480
Those are spiders.

3253
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,980
Don't you have a sniper?

3254
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:34,620
Like hello?

3255
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:37,480
He was peeking behind the rock.

3256
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,680
I have a sniper.

3257
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:42,400
Sniper's not here.

3258
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,880
Oh I need that.

3259
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:44,080
Yeah.

3260
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,520
Are we locating?

3261
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:46,860
No?

3262
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,180
Where do we go?

3263
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:50,740
I'm killing these spiders for you.

3264
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,080
Okay.

3265
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:53,920
I'll go there.

3266
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:55,720
These spiders have moves bro.

3267
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,460
I can't hit them.

3268
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:58,740
That's just sad.

3269
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:02,000
Dude they're tap strafing.

3270
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,540
What do you mean sad?

3271
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:03,840
That's just sad.

3272
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,700
Imagine losing to a spider.

3273
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,980
Well I didn't take any damage so I'm not losing technically.

3274
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,300
Imagine losing to...

3275
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:13,100
In front of your entire chat.

3276
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,020
Guys I would never miss a spider.

3277
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,340
I'll miss a person.

3278
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,440
Guys I'm getting bullied again.

3279
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:19,520
I'd miss a person.

3280
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:23,080
Guys but I would never miss...

3281
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,500
Can we do something about this?

3282
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,580
Do what?

3283
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:26,780
About what?

3284
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:28,500
About you.

3285
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,460
I'm just having a conversation.

3286
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:33,820
Just like how the other TSM have conversations.

3287
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:37,020
I'm not allowed to have a conversation with my team now?

3288
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:37,820
No they don't.

3289
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:38,860
It's only working hard.

3290
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:41,280
Ditto was I bullying?

3291
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:43,380
No.

3292
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,020
Yes.

3293
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,480

3324
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,160

3326
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:47,520

They are?

3337
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,540
I didn't even get a chance to grab the bats.

3338
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:07,440
They look like they're chasing.

3339
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:08,920
Yeah I'm coming over.

3340
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,180

I don't have them man.

3350
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:27,800
Let's get moving.

3351
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,840
I don't wanna get stuck in some stupid longbow dumbass fight across the planet.

3352
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:33,020
Told you.

3353
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:34,800
Everybody's using sniper now.

3354
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:36,040

3355
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:36,040
Everybody's using sniper now.

3356
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:36,280
Hold on.

3357
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:36,980
I'm healing.

3358
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,320
Let's hit this people beacon.

3359
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:39,920

3360
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:40,840
Okay.

3361
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:46,180
And then let's hit the ring console.

3362
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,720
And then we should have purple right?

3363
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:49,340

3364
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,520

01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:04,000
Bloodhound's low.

3372
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,300
We're getting turrets in our back.

3373
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:07,640
I think you guys should go.

3374
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:08,040
Just leave.

3375
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:08,340

3385
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:26,700

3393
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,180
Are they evacing towards me?

3394
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:38,960

3416
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,520
I thought I had time with the medkit.

3417
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:16,760
I thought I had time with the medkit.

3418
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,640
I thought I had time with the medkit.

3419
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:19,980
I timed it incorrectly.

3420
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,480
We're going to scan the zone after you've done that.

3421
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:25,340
We're going to scan the zone after you've done that.

3422
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:25,360
Okay.

3423
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:28,640
I don't have much...

3424
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,000
I have one medkit as well.

3425
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:31,180
Okay.

3426
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:33,020
And then I'm gonna...

3427
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,300
I have a re-replier too.

3428
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,040
Why there was...

3429
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,000

3430
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:40,660

3431
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,740
Here we go again.

3432
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,040
Here we go again.

3433
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,340
Alright somebody...

3434

01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,160
We gotta go cause I only have one medkit.

3436
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,800
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

3437
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:54,460

3438
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:58,040

01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,880
Okay I'm gonna cough here.

Do I have time?

3441
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,980
I think I might die while I'm re-repliering.

3442
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,520
I'm actually dead cause I have no syringes.

3443
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:11,120
I have a medkit but I don't know if I have time to pop it.

3444
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,360
I'm dead.

I have read the play.

3476
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:19,060
You have to get... there's a callus spike in front of you.

3477
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:19,440
So...

3478
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,840
This is what it is.

3479
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:23,060
We have no choice but to run through it.

3480
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,360
You guys have mobile respawn though.

3481
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:29,700
Yeah but these guys are gonna be our biggest problem.

3482
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:30,740
Yeah we have a wall.

3483
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:30,980
We have a wall.

3484
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:33,340
Perfecto.

3485
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,260
Let's go that way.

3486
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,300
Oh my god.

3487
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,060
I almost saw my ult.

3488
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,440
Did you guys get my read the play?

3489
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,740
I don't know.

3490
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:43,320
I didn't get it.

3491
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:45,820
Come with me.

3492
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:46,880
I get my ult.

3493
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,900
I'm gonna ult left side.

3494
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:50,040
2%.

3495
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:50,360
1%.

3496
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,500
Oh there's a guy up the rock.

3497
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:54,200
There's a guy up the rock.

3498
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:54,800
I just saw him.

3499
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:57,600
This guy from the left is annoying.

3500
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,060
This is my ult.

3501
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:00,320
I'm probably dead.

3502
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,100
Yeah you're dead.

3503
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,520
No audio.

3504
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,280
What is wrong with people?

3505
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,100
Why are you guys playing like this?

3506
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,920
Guys we shouldn't play edge.

3507
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,760
We weren't edging there.

3508
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:16,160
We were going zone.

3509
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:21,140
But everyone else was for some reason rotating towards us out of zone.

3510
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,400
Because we don't know how to rotate.

3511
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,200
So they rotated into us.

3512
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:29,260
How does that make sense?

3513
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:30,380
Did we want to swap?

3514
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:34,340
I don't want to play blood out anyway.

3515
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,840
I'm getting bullied on blood out.

3516
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:39,860
They don't know where they're going.

3517
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:42,120
So they're just running randomly I guess.

3518
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,220
What the fuck is going on?

3519
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,020
I think maybe we can play like casual.

3520
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,240
Like kill everyone that we see.

3521
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,440
Yeah maybe we have to just murder people.

3522
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:54,760
I think so too.

3523
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:57,140
We can fight.

3524
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:58,000
We can fight.

3525
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:59,160
We can fight.

3526
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,980
We can rotate because we will do stupid shit.

3527
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,060
So we just have to fight everyone.

3528
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:04,320
Fight the whole server.

3529
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:05,320
Might as well.

3530
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,840
I mean we have to get kill points now at this point.

3531
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:09,120
Yes.

3532
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,160
Yeah we're just getting like capped.

3533
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:14,940
I got fucking capped out.

3534
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,260
I literally saw a guy fucking hugging the wall.

3535
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:23,120
Like two teams came to us outside the zone.

3536
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,540
I don't know why.

3537
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:27,800
Two teams came to barometer behind us.

3538
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,100
Barometer was nowhere.

3539
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:29,820
It was nowhere near the zone.

3540
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:35,640
And then sandwiched us with two more teams that were in prowler nest.

3541
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,320
So we got sandwiched by four teams that were not in the zone.

3542
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:41,100
And not moving towards zone.

3543
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:42,240
This isn't a JP tournament.

3544
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,860
This is an NAU tournament.

3545
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:47,100
Yeah I forgot.

3546
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,280
There's no brain cells here.

3547
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,080
Nobody rotates.

3548
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,300
You gotta remember.

3549
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:53,840
Nobody rotates.

3550
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:55,680
Just fight everyone.

3551
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,100
Just get good loot and fight everyone.

3552
01:52:02,910 --> 01:52:07,730
There's too many control players in this lobby for there to be any IQ involved.

3553
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:08,790
So we have to fight.

3554
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:14,450
We start fighting next game.

3555
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:18,950
We have to just full fight everyone.

3556
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:20,910
Wait are you still lagging though?

3557
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:26,290
I feel like I'm lagging but like I'm just ignoring it mentally.

3558
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:30,990
You choose if you believe there's no lagging.

3559
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:32,170
Maybe there isn't.

3560
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:35,290
There's nothing I can do about it so I'll just ignore it.

3561
01:52:36,110 --> 01:52:36,550
Yeah.

3562
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:41,570
Alright now I'm gonna...

3563
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:47,310
The fact that we even raised you there was only for the fact that there were so many teams there that they couldn't finish you.

3564
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:48,710
Thank fucking god.

3565
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:49,730
See everybody's fighting.

3566
01:52:49,990 --> 01:52:50,830
Nobody's playing zone.

3567
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:55,010
There's a fight to our left as well.

3568
01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:55,630
There's a fight to our left as well.

3569
01:52:57,210 --> 01:52:58,350
They're freaks man.

3570
01:52:58,550 --> 01:52:59,870
These guys think they're playing pubs.

3571
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:01,750
These guys think they're playing pubs.

3572
01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:09,990
We're just gonna run around and hit all the beacons in the world until we have like purple red and we're just gonna fight the first team we see.

3573
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:11,850
Look at that!

3574
01:53:11,850 --> 01:53:13,470
There's only four teams there fighting!

3575
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:17,730
What the fuck am I looking at?

3576
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:20,510
Why can't we do that?

3577
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:22,950
I don't know.

3578
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:24,810
I don't know.

3579
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:26,910
Why can't that be us?

3580
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:27,530
I don't know.

3581
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:29,270
I don't know.

3582
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:30,110
Maybe stop dying?

3583
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:31,350
Oh okay.

3584
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:32,930
Hey Doki, scan the ring.

3585
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:34,130
Okay, no smoke.

3586
01:53:34,330 --> 01:53:34,730
That's fine.

3587
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,430
You can't blame me for that.

3588
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:40,810
Why is there four teams in Prowler Nest?

3589
01:53:43,410 --> 01:53:44,550
Why are they there?

3590
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:45,790
What are they looking for?

3591
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:48,330
The fucking hidden treasure from Captain Morgan?

3592
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:49,610
You can't blame it on me!

3593
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,190
You called me to scan!

3594
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:52,930
I listened.

3595
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:54,030
I was listening.

3596
01:53:54,490 --> 01:53:58,810
But the other game you sit on a roof and three teams beat you up at the same time.

3597
01:53:58,910 --> 01:53:58,930
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

3598
01:53:59,070 --> 01:54:00,310
Hey Doki, do the peek.

3599
01:54:00,430 --> 01:54:01,130
The people scan.

3600
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:03,190
Okay, let me do the people scan.

3601
01:54:03,370 --> 01:54:05,130
As there was no smoke and my...

3602
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:09,530
And my Bangalore was looking away from me while I get shot at.

3603
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:11,890
Oh okay, yeah it's my fault.

3604
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:12,730
First game!

3605
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:13,790
First game!

3606
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:17,770
I didn't die first.

3607
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:19,190
First game, you both died.

3608
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:20,770
You can't gaslight your way out of this.

3609
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:25,890
There are certain situations that you can't gaslight your way out of.

3610
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:27,170
And this is one of them.

3611
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:28,790
Yes I can.

3612
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:30,870
Chat, who's right?

3613
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:33,010
Me or Imperial RPR?

3614
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:37,270
Of course Imperial RPR is always right.

3615
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:39,770
It's always reps and heaven's fault.

3616
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:41,330
You don't fucking know this.

3617
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:46,150
Guys, who's right?

3618
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:48,590
Guys, Imperial RPR?

3619
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:49,130
It's fucking...

3620
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:53,590
Oh my god, look how many RPRs in your chat.

3621
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:54,030
Wow!

3622
01:54:54,490 --> 01:54:55,610
Wow Doki!

3623
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:58,310
Even your viewers know you're lying.

3624
01:54:58,390 --> 01:55:01,450
And you're like, They're saying Dito more than Doki.

3625
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:03,510
Yeah, cause Dito's on my side.

3626
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:07,270
Their hosts and their devs are always together.

3627
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:08,490
No.

3628
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:09,770
No.

3629
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:10,930
Dito, are you on my side?

3630
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:13,010
Yes.

3631
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:13,290
No.

3632
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:13,510
See?

3633
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:13,890
Oh!

3634
01:55:14,130 --> 01:55:16,330
Yeah, Dito and Doki vote together.

3635
01:55:16,770 --> 01:55:17,570
Why am I 2v1?

3636
01:55:17,730 --> 01:55:18,910
I'm not gonna IGL anymore.

3637
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:23,890
You guys IGL'd them.

3638
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:26,870
Imperial HAL is able to get 2v1.

3639
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:28,310
No.

3640
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:31,130
Imperial HAL 1v2s.

3641
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:31,730
There's a difference.

3642
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:33,990
You're just the...

3643
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:35,390
What can I say?

3644
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:36,030
You're just the...

3645
01:55:36,030 --> 01:55:37,550
The poor man's Imperial.

3646
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:42,510
You guys are poor man's Repson Eve Evan.

3647
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:43,950
Like, what the fuck is going on?

3648
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:48,670
No, we're the better version of Repson for hosts cause we're anime girls.

3649
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:51,430
We're the better version cause we're anime girls.

3650
01:55:51,430 --> 01:55:51,530
On the discount section.

3651
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:54,170
We're the better version cause we're anime girls.

3652
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:55,710
Anime girls are out of meta.

3653
01:55:55,890 --> 01:55:56,870
That shit's so 2022.

3654
01:55:57,230 --> 01:55:58,310
Like, we're out of that meta.

3655
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:00,050
What's the current meta, huh?

3656
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:02,530
Funny people on Twitch.

3657
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:06,750
Like how you had to specify on Twitch.

3658
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:08,450
Like how you had to specify on Twitch.

3659
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:14,690
Like twitch .tv slash RPRX or twitch.tv jinxy or twitch.tv twitch.tv the sketch reel.

3660
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:15,870
Like, funny people.

3661
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:16,890
Not anime girls.

3662
01:56:17,030 --> 01:56:18,090
Anime girls are out of meta.

3663
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,570
Anime girls are out of meta.

3664
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:23,290
Bro, this man's fucking coping.

3665
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:26,770
No, no, I'm telling you this is the meta.

3666
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:27,750
Like, I follow the meta.

3667
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:31,270
Okay, I play Bloodhound.

3668
01:56:31,370 --> 01:56:32,450
Yeah, you're Bloodhound now.

3669
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:34,850
You're Catalyst.

3670
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:36,590
Oh, Jesus Maria, someone help us.

3671
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:36,970
Yay, I'm Catalyst!

3672
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:41,460
Is there one more?

3673
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,400
Is there two more games?

3674
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:43,000
Two more games, right?

3675
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:44,300
Yeah, two more games.

3676
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:52,360
Two more games.

3677
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:54,120
And we're just running at people, right?

3678
01:56:58,300 --> 01:56:59,740
We're just running at people.

3679
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:01,520
We're just running at people.

3680
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:08,460
I mean, I feel like at this point, like, everyone's fucking fighting anyway, like, we might as well join the fucking hate fest that's going on.

3681
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,280
So we can at least get kill points and loot.

3682
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:14,620
Like, why be smart when you can be dumb?

3683
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,800
Like, that's my motto in life.

3684
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,720
Yeah, because we're the better dumb players.

3685
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:22,540
Like, why put your effort in being smart when you should be dumb?

3686
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,680
Like you?

3687
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,540
I mean, to be fair, that's you on default, though.

3688
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,100
You're right.

3689
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:35,400
Like, you literally half an hour ago admitted that you are not smart.

3690
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:36,180
You said, I'm dumb.

3691
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:39,400
Yeah, but like, I have smart moments.

3692
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:41,180
Do you?

3693
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:43,380
Okay, I had smart moments in my life too.

3694
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,400
Like, I won ALGS.

3695
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:44,800
Do you?

3696
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:45,280
Like, that was smart.

3697
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:46,100
That was pretty smart.

3698
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,940
Yeah, but that was two years ago.

3699
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:51,680
Okay, and I do smart things every now and then.

3700
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:57,320
But like, I don't need to be smart anymore.

3701
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:58,580
Like, I can be dumb.

3702
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:00,380
I'm in a position where I can be dumb.

3703
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:05,400
So why would I put effort in being smart?

3704
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:06,320
I can just be dumb.

3705
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:07,060
To win the tournament?

3706
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:07,680
To win easier.

3707
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:10,240
Who the fuck cares?

3708
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:11,360
Who the fuck cares?

3709
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:23,310
I'm like, 25% Menhera, 25% dumb, 50% don't care.

3710
01:58:23,850 --> 01:58:25,130
This is the life I lead.

3711
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:28,190
Holy shit, the first place team is 79 points.

3712
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:30,910
That's crazy.

3713
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:34,130
Yeah, I mean, the balancing is just out of this world.

3714
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:38,190
The balance is just out of...

3715
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:39,810
We just blame it on balancing and we're good.

3716
01:58:39,910 --> 01:58:41,750
That team doesn't have a pro player.

3717
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:45,350
The balancing is crazy.

3718
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:47,310
The balancing is crazy.

3719
01:58:47,450 --> 01:58:50,070
That team doesn't even have a pro player.

3720
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:51,910
The balancing is crazy.

3721
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:54,010
In what way?

3722
01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:55,130
They probably have three controllers.

3723
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:58,450
They probably got three controllers.

3724
01:58:58,610 --> 01:59:00,810
Therefore, 0.4...

3725
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:04,030
That's 40% of all their efforts is controlled by an AI.

3726
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:05,530
All of them are MNK.

3727
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:08,270
40% of their... That's bullshit.

3728
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:09,770
There's no way all of them are MNK.

3729
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:11,610
Absolutely not possible.

3730
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:12,930
You don't know this.

3731
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,990
You're just gaslighting.

3732
01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:15,390
No, I'm speaking... Where's Kalos?

3733
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:16,730
Okay, there.

3734
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:19,290
You don't even know where Kalos...

3735
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:23,090
I have Kalos in like a fucking...

3736
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:24,610
two plus months.

3737
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:29,710
Oh my god.

3738
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:32,750
My cable's stuck on the chair!

3739
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,250
What?

3740
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:35,610
What?

3741
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:36,790
What happened?

3742
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:38,870
I watched your stream.

3743
01:59:39,050 --> 01:59:40,750
She's going through a lot right now.

3744
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:43,290
Almost lost my... almost my head.

3745
01:59:43,390 --> 01:59:44,410
Almost run over my head.

3746
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:51,630
She's going through a lot.

3747
01:59:53,130 --> 01:59:54,870
And whose fault is it?

3748
01:59:55,090 --> 01:59:55,650
Not me.

3749
01:59:55,710 --> 02:00:01,650
The first... the first players team, they have good ping.

3750
02:00:01,930 --> 02:00:02,970
That's the reason.

3751
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:03,530
That too.

3752
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:04,730
That is also...

3753
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:06,650
That is a valid factor.

3754
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:09,530
I literally asked you, Isidore, are you okay with playing on NA ping?

3755
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:10,290
And you said yes.

3756
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:14,190
Our good ping players not doing shit.

3757
02:00:15,130 --> 02:00:16,010
You said...

3758
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:18,810
You said we're gonna destroy the tournament.

3759
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:21,510
I was like, are you okay with playing on NA ping?

3760
02:00:21,650 --> 02:00:22,250
And you're like, yes.

3761
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:25,610
Okay, well, but unforeseen circumstances happened.

3762
02:00:25,790 --> 02:00:27,210
One, I'm lagging like a bitch.

3763
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:28,270
Unforeseen circumstances.

3764
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:30,110
Two, what is this balancing?

3765
02:00:30,230 --> 02:00:31,350
Like, what the fuck?

3766
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:32,930
We have three pred players on one team.

3767
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:33,810
You're telling me that's okay?

3768
02:00:34,650 --> 02:00:35,090
What?

3769
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:35,790
For which one?

3770
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:36,870
Which team?

3771
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:38,290
The first team.

3772
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:40,730
First place team is not three pred players.

3773
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:41,790
It's like two master players.

3774
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:42,370
Who are they?

3775
02:00:42,370 --> 02:00:42,910
Do you know them?

3776
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:45,390
It's Kaisa and Hachi.

3777
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:46,470
Stop the cap!

3778
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:50,550
You're telling me Kaisa and Hachi are dropping 79 points?

3779
02:00:50,690 --> 02:00:51,630
Yeah, they are.

3780
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:54,950
Who's their third?

3781
02:00:55,070 --> 02:00:55,570
Who's their third?

3782
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:56,350
I don't know.

3783
02:00:56,510 --> 02:00:57,810
Seroku or some shit.

3784
02:00:57,850 --> 02:00:59,310
I don't fucking know who that guy is.

3785
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:04,430
That's literally a team of masters.

3786
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:04,670
That's literally a team of masters.

3787
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:06,730
Our team is literally three pred players.

3788
02:01:08,210 --> 02:01:09,030
Okay, bro.

3789
02:01:09,150 --> 02:01:11,010
And we're like ninth place.

3790
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:13,310
Three pred players.

3791
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:15,390
Stop the cap.

3792
02:01:16,630 --> 02:01:19,290
None of us have gotten pred in like four years.

3793
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:20,670
Calm down.

3794
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:24,890
Yeah, but the first place team never touched pred.

3795
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:30,310
Okay, but like, touching pred means nothing in this game.

3796
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:32,190
Yeah, and they've never...

3797
02:01:32,190 --> 02:01:32,830
they've been masters.

3798
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:35,010
We've all been masters.

3799
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:36,630
We've all been masters.

3800
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:37,930
Why are we not first?

3801
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:42,250
We might not have touched pred a long time, but we've all been masters.

3802
02:01:43,110 --> 02:01:46,010
I was literally masters like a couple of months ago.

3803
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:50,950
You're probably gonna go kill everyone.

3804
02:01:53,110 --> 02:01:54,550
Why are you not killing anyone?

3805
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:55,930
Why aren't you not...

3806
02:01:55,930 --> 02:01:57,290
Why aren't you killing everyone?

3807
02:01:57,290 --> 02:01:58,490
I'm killing people!

3808
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:00,890
You're not finishing them.

3809
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:02,610
You're not finishing them.

3810
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:08,630
I'm the one with the most issues here and you give me the most shit.

3811
02:02:10,830 --> 02:02:13,790
I literally have people teleporting like what do you want from me?

3812
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:15,330
That's your issue.

3813
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:19,150
Yeah, so fucking help me out and kill someone.

3814
02:02:19,690 --> 02:02:20,450
We do.

3815
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:21,250
We knock people.

3816
02:02:21,410 --> 02:02:22,830
You don't finish them for us.

3817
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:26,730
What am I supposed to trade my life away for a finish?

3818
02:02:27,070 --> 02:02:28,970
Yeah, cause then at least we get kill points.

3819
02:02:30,330 --> 02:02:31,530
Yeah, and we die.

3820
02:02:32,730 --> 02:02:35,450
You get one kill point and you die and think that's how you play tournaments?

3821
02:02:35,530 --> 02:02:38,170
That's better than zero kill points.

3822
02:02:39,910 --> 02:02:41,250
I just can't handle you.

3823
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:45,890
There's no way you're serious.

3824
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:48,490
You're not even serious about this tournament.

3825
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:49,290
What do you mean?

3826
02:02:49,330 --> 02:02:50,670
I was so serious.

3827
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:53,570
I'm like literally the only one that's taking this seriously.

3828
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:55,670
Shut the fuck up.

3829
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:58,790
Me and Ditto are both taking this so seriously.

3830
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:01,470
Yeah, I'm not taking it.

3831
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:03,210
I'm the one that's not taking it seriously.

3832
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:07,550
You told me to scan the people speaking without a smoke.

3833
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:11,110
You didn't even smoke for me.

3834
02:03:11,110 --> 02:03:14,550
Okay, but who can predict four teams to be here when the zone is here?

3835
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:17,410
Yeah, but a good IGL would smoke in advance.

3836
02:03:17,550 --> 02:03:19,050
A good IGL would predict that.

3837
02:03:19,150 --> 02:03:19,550
Yeah, okay.

3838
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:22,550
Let me go out of zero.

3839
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:24,750
Zero would be a good idea.

3840
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:27,850
I don't know what I told Jen to smoke for Sykes.

3841
02:03:28,410 --> 02:03:29,370
Wait, what should I do?

3842
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:31,010
Spikes or Veil?

3843
02:03:31,330 --> 02:03:33,050
Increase ultimate length or increase max?

3844
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:33,710
Always ult.

3845
02:03:35,170 --> 02:03:36,210
Every ult.

3846
02:03:38,410 --> 02:03:40,770
Ultimate length and ultimate duration.

3847
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:44,810
Okay, I'm ready to go whenever.

3848
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:45,590
Okay, I'm ready to go whenever.

3849
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:45,910
Okay, I'm ready to go whenever.

3850
02:03:46,930 --> 02:03:47,450
Yeah.

3851
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:49,550
We're running at people, right?

3852
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:50,370
Let's fight.

3853
02:03:51,370 --> 02:03:53,190
Yeah, but we first want to get purple.

3854
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:55,950
We don't want to fight with shitty fucking Walmart armor.

3855
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:56,870
How do we get purple?

3856
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:57,850
Okay.

3857
02:03:58,110 --> 02:03:59,990
I'm doing literally spiders right now.

3858
02:04:00,130 --> 02:04:01,070
I will scan the enemy.

3859
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:04,290
We're gonna scan every single beacon until we have purple.

3860
02:04:04,630 --> 02:04:06,250
I'm taking the redeploy to you.

3861
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:07,170
We're gonna go here next.

3862
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:08,630
Taking the cannon to you.

3863
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:11,110
Hello.

3864
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:16,310
Oh my god, I'm juicing the spiders.

3865
02:04:17,690 --> 02:04:18,830
You're doing so well.

3866
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:20,350
I'm juicing the spiders.

3867
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:23,490
The spiders will juice the gold mags and purple stocks and shit.

3868
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:24,170
Like what the fuck?

3869
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:25,750
We're rich.

3870
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:29,250
But that's crazy.

3871
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:32,370
There's people in the...

3872
02:04:33,230 --> 02:04:34,310
Okay, there's people in the...

3873
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:36,870
We want to go here so we can hit two more scans.

3874
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:42,170
Oh my god, stop teleporting, stupid game.

3875
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:45,010
We don't have Ditto with us.

3876
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:45,710
Yeah, we're gonna shoot them.

3877
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:47,810
Yeah, we're gonna shoot them.

3878
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:48,390
We're gonna kill them.

3879
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:48,690
We're gonna murder them.

3880
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:50,670
Ditto's far.

3881
02:04:51,890 --> 02:04:52,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

3882
02:04:53,110 --> 02:04:53,950
We're gonna wait for her here.

3883
02:04:54,190 --> 02:04:54,590
Okay.

3884
02:04:55,810 --> 02:04:56,850
I have one bat only.

3885
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:57,590
Do you guys have all the bats?

3886
02:04:57,830 --> 02:04:59,250
I have a bat here.

3887
02:04:59,590 --> 02:05:00,310
I have two.

3888
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:03,090
Be careful, be careful.

3889
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:05,350
Ditto, hurry up.

3890
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:05,590
Let's go.

3891
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:06,830
Yeah.

3892
02:05:07,230 --> 02:05:08,170
She's so far.

3893
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:09,570
We need to be fast and swift.

3894
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:11,930
Can this team scan this from far away?

3895
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:15,290
I'm gonna play from the door here to see if there's teams still here or not.

3896
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:20,440
Are they still there?

3897
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:22,320
I don't see anyone.

3898
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:24,520
But they could be ratting, I guess.

3899
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:28,640
The minespeed is fine.

3900
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:30,840
We wanna hit this beacon, Ditto.

3901
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:35,160
And then when the ring closes, we wanna hit the ring console again.

3902
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,000
Okay.

3903
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,020
And then that should give us purple, I think.

3904
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:45,360
We can't fight.

3905
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:46,760
I can't see anybody.

3906
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:47,720
I'm scared.

3907
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:51,980
Yeah, I think they finally rotated to the zone.

3908
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:53,480
Great job, guys.

3909
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:54,080
Wow!

3910
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:54,300
Wow!

3911
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:55,180
Wow!

3912
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:57,860
Wow, we moved!

3913
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:02,340
Well, I need that.

3914
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:03,140
I should probably...

3915
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:05,120
Why is that door juiced up?

3916
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:07,800
I don't like that.

3917
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:08,440
Should we scan?

3918
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:10,780
Yeah, scan them, Ditto.

3919
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:12,500
Okay, good, good, good.

3920
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,140
Come here and hit the juicer.

3921
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:15,600
Okay.

3922
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:16,580
Yeah, you should smoke here.

3923
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:19,060
Yeah, where's the smoke?

3924
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:21,360
I smoked it!

3925
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:22,900
Oh, there's a car behind us.

3926
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:23,340
What the fuck?

3927
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:27,560
Oh, look at these guys riding!

3928
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:28,480
Look at them riding!

3929
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:30,420
What the fuck?

3930
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:32,480
I thought you said there's a car there.

3931
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:35,460
Oh, there's one team here, one team here too.

3932
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:36,060
Team here, yeah.

3933
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:38,500
Yeah, I'm coming over here.

3934
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:41,160
My bullets are not registering.

3935
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,560
They are not registering.

3936
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:42,980
I repeat.

3937
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:43,720
There's so many teams!

3938
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:47,080
Come to me, play on me.

3939
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:47,740
Oh, no.

3940
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:49,780
Oh, no.

3941
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:50,400
I'm fucking... Bangalore?

3942
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:50,980
Yeah.

3943
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:52,000
I'm at the hill.

3944
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:54,960
That guy's playing juiced Sentinel.

3945
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:56,120
It's not fair!

3946
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:00,520
What is that shit?

3947
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:01,900
They're running back.

3948
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:04,260
Let's go to the tunnel while we can.

3949
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:07,360
I don't want to get stuck here between four fucking teams.

3950
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:08,560
Again.

3951
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:09,640
Yay!

3952
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:11,300
Yay!

3953
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:16,550
I won bad now.

3954
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:17,170
I'm so sad.

3955
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:18,970
Are we not doing the map scan?

3956
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:22,210
No, because they're there and I don't want to die fucking doing it.

3957
02:07:23,490 --> 02:07:23,970
Smoke me.

3958
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:27,750
Yeah, and what did they just decide?

3959
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:28,930
Oh, let's go back.

3960
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:30,430
For no reason at all.

3961
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:31,990
They would never.

3962
02:07:32,690 --> 02:07:33,550
No way.

3963
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:38,670
Listen, we need to adapt to the IQ in the lobby.

3964
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:39,990
Which is not very high.

3965
02:07:40,730 --> 02:07:41,210
Okay?

3966
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:44,630
Okay, guys.

3967
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:45,670
I'm going to tell this a while.

3968
02:07:45,710 --> 02:07:47,450
How many spikes can I have up at one?

3969
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:48,250
Two.

3970
02:07:49,490 --> 02:07:50,990
Doors is three, right?

3971
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:52,010
Is doors three?

3972
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:52,810
Doors is two.

3973
02:07:53,490 --> 02:07:53,810
Doors is two.

3974
02:07:54,030 --> 02:07:55,230
Didn't used to be three?

3975
02:07:57,810 --> 02:07:59,750
I guess they took it away.

3976
02:08:00,070 --> 02:08:00,430
I don't think so.

3977
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:00,690
Oh, wait.

3978
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:01,370
Someone smoked it.

3979
02:08:01,410 --> 02:08:02,010
They're juicing it.

3980
02:08:04,290 --> 02:08:04,930
Blue armor.

3981
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:07,290
Can people stop teleporting?

3982
02:08:07,310 --> 02:08:08,830
I'm actually going to have a moment with myself.

3983
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:12,130
Are they just going to...

3984
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:13,070
Can you scan the building?

3985
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:14,070
Are they just going to sit there?

3986
02:08:14,150 --> 02:08:15,070
Like we want the bacon.

3987
02:08:16,210 --> 02:08:17,290
We want the bacon.

3988
02:08:18,350 --> 02:08:19,450
Where are you guys... Where are they going?

3989
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:20,070
Oh, what?

3990
02:08:20,130 --> 02:08:20,350
Okay.

3991
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:23,570
That's the motherfuckers with the sentry.

3992
02:08:23,570 --> 02:08:24,730
Are we going to start a fight?

3993
02:08:26,210 --> 02:08:27,230
I want to, yeah.

3994
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:27,870
Alright.

3995
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:28,630
They scanned.

3996
02:08:28,850 --> 02:08:29,310
The people scanned.

3997
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:31,470
Twelve seconds.

3998
02:08:31,730 --> 02:08:33,070
I'm fucking... I'm ulting them.

3999
02:08:34,070 --> 02:08:35,350
Oh, they're trying to settle.

4000
02:08:35,390 --> 02:08:37,450
We need to get close so the sentry is useless.

4001
02:08:38,930 --> 02:08:39,830
Wait, another team.

4002
02:08:39,890 --> 02:08:40,170
Another team.

4003
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:41,530
I'm getting beamed around corners.

4004
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:42,090
Another team.

4005
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:42,430
Another team.

4006
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:42,850
Another team.

4007
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:45,630
Okay, we can't fight this anymore.

4008
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:46,750
Yeah, yeah.

4009
02:08:48,190 --> 02:08:48,870
That's so annoying.

4010
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:50,290
What the fuck?

4011
02:08:50,870 --> 02:08:52,250
Are they trying to pull off damage?

4012
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:52,710
Go here.

4013
02:08:54,530 --> 02:08:54,930
Alright.

4014
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:56,070
I'm heading over.

4015
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:57,050
Head to HPR.

4016
02:08:57,250 --> 02:09:03,070
I'm going to... I literally might have to craft a bat here.

4017
02:09:03,410 --> 02:09:04,970
Yeah, I have one bat left too.

4018
02:09:06,630 --> 02:09:09,210
We're getting like, thirded so fast too.

4019
02:09:12,010 --> 02:09:13,070
Oh, they're fighting.

4020
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:15,250
I hear them fighting like behind us from the spiders.

4021
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:16,110
Maybe we can third that.

4022
02:09:16,750 --> 02:09:18,170
Okay, I'm going to craft a bat as well.

4023
02:09:18,910 --> 02:09:19,910
Yeah, craft a bat.

4024
02:09:20,070 --> 02:09:21,630
He used... He used... He used...

4025
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:23,570
I got it.

4026
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:25,810
They're fighting behind us?

4027
02:09:26,070 --> 02:09:26,390
Right?

4028
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:27,570
No, no.

4029
02:09:27,570 --> 02:09:29,350
Yeah, I think they're fighting on this house this here.

4030
02:09:29,530 --> 02:09:30,870
Also, Ditto, I have an ulti-excel.

4031
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:31,310
Do you want it?

4032
02:09:32,490 --> 02:09:32,990
Oh, yeah.

4033
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:33,430
I want it.

4034
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:33,870
Yeah, yeah.

4035
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:34,710
I'm good.

4036
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:40,540
Whoa.

4037
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:41,580
Did someone fly to us?

4038
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:44,160
Fucking sentinel guy is here.

4039
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:45,760
Someone fly to us.

4040
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:46,540
Someone fly to us.

4041
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:46,840
Okay.

4042
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:48,440
Ditto, we're not with us.

4043
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:48,860
You're not with us.

4044
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:49,180
Ditto, Ditto.

4045
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:51,480
Ditto, you're not with us.

4046
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:52,420
Can you wall me?

4047
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,520
Wall, wall, wall me.

4048
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:54,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4049
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:54,680
I'll smoke you.

4050
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:55,000
I'll smoke you.

4051
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:55,880
Oh, I already walled it.

4052
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:58,520
I heard wall and then I walled.

4053
02:09:58,600 --> 02:09:58,980
Okay, that's been nice.

4054
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:02,520
Almost killed that guy.

4055
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:03,200
Almost killed Watson.

4056
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:06,640
Dude, I kind of want to like kill these guys.

4057
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:06,880
Dude, I kind of want to like kill these guys.

4058
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,140
They're just mirroring us the entire time.

4059
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:08,660
Like, fuck off.

4060
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:10,020
Is that a sentinel team?

4061
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:12,740
Yeah, it's a sentinel team.

4062
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:15,800
Can you scan this building?

4063
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:16,760
Uh-huh.

4064
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:18,720
Yeah, they're just there.

4065
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:19,540
Yeah, they're just there.

4066
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:22,000
I just got three norex.

4067
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:22,320
Nice.

4068
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:22,860
Love the game.

4069
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:26,060
Can I see them?

4070
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:26,420
Not a norex.

4071
02:10:26,420 --> 02:10:26,680
Nice.

4072
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:28,080
Are they in there?

4073
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:29,960
Yeah, they're in here.

4074
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:30,500
Second floor.

4075
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:32,380
Almost cracked another one.

4076
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:37,460
Should I push up or no?

4077
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:38,200
Five seconds to scan.

4078
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:39,380
Cracked Watson.

4079
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,580
Like, these guys are getting beamed up.

4080
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:42,540
I'm pushing up.

4081
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:43,180
I'm pushing up.

4082
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:43,620
I'm pushing up.

4083
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:46,000
Climb up here, yeah.

4084
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:47,680
I took the door.

4085
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:48,140
I took the door.

4086
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:48,240
I'm pushing up.

4087
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:48,240
I took the door.

4088
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,400
I think we actually have to go zone because it's so far from me.

4089
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:53,520
I think we actually have to go zone because it's so far from me.

4090
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:54,040
It's only a minute.

4091
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:56,580
I'm smoking you and come back to me.

4092
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,020
I might be dead.

4093
02:10:59,240 --> 02:10:59,880
I'm dead.

4094
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:00,440
I'm dead from this.

4095
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:01,580
I'm alive.

4096
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:01,880
I'm alive.

4097
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:03,320
You're alive.

4098
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:03,640
You're alive.

4099
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:04,000
Heal up.

4100
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:05,540
Down here.

4101
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:05,840
Down here.

4102
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:06,500
Down here.

4103
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:08,100
I'm batting.

4104
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:08,620
I'm batting.

4105
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:09,220
They're looking for her.

4106
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:12,180
One guy second floor, two guys below.

4107
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:13,060
Okay, okay.

4108
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:14,180
I'm gonna reinforce.

4109
02:11:14,860 --> 02:11:15,580
I'm medicating.

4110
02:11:17,020 --> 02:11:18,440
Look for her, Dita.

4111
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:19,220
They're down here.

4112
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:21,660
Okay, I will scan after batting.

4113
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:22,440
We have 44 seconds.

4114
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:23,040
Cracked one.

4115
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:24,440
Almost cracked two.

4116
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,180
Can you scan?

4117
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:26,660
These guys are suicidal.

4118
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:27,240
Let's go.

4119
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:28,100
Okay.

4120
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,440
Leave or...

4121
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:29,840
Oh, okay.

4122
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:30,120
Leave.

4123
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:30,720
No, no, no.

4124
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:31,240
Come, come, come.

4125
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:32,780
Come with me.

4126
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:33,180
Come with me.

4127
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:35,780
We leave them and we gatekeep them.

4128
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:36,940
There's only thing we can do.

4129
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:38,940
I got shot.

4130
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:39,640
You good, Dita?

4131
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,980
Yeah, I'm good.

4132
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:44,520
I have... We have redeploy that we can use.

4133
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:48,780
I'm redeploying here to get ahead of them.

4134
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:49,160
I'm redeploying here to get ahead of them.

4135
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:49,380
Okay.

4136
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:51,840
They have all of us.

4137
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:52,260
Be careful.

4138
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:55,720
Land on these spiders and gatekeep these guys.

4139
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:56,560
Okay.

4140
02:11:57,820 --> 02:11:58,720
Oh, they're going left.

4141
02:11:59,320 --> 02:11:59,760
Fuck.

4142
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:01,820
Fuck, pussies.

4143
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:03,840
Should we kill the spiders?

4144
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:07,180
Yeah, we do spiders for Eva.

4145
02:12:08,620 --> 02:12:09,380
Yeah, that's interesting.

4146
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:11,640
Even the spiders are fucking...

4147
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:13,560
Wait, what?

4148
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:15,140
There's a squad from command center.

4149
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:15,800
Command center.

4150
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:16,600
Oh, okay.

4151
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:22,980
Keep watching the command center team.

4152
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:24,880
Keep watching the command center team.

4153
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:25,520
Okay, like...

4154
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:26,560
Suck a dick?

4155
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,280
Should we go behind us?

4156
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:28,720
No, right?

4157
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:29,880
Double checking.

4158
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:33,240
They could walk up behind us, but I don't...

4159
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:35,080
Okay, this guy's shooting smoke.

4160
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:35,680
He's cheating.

4161
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:43,460
Oh, nice.

4162
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:43,880
Okay.

4163
02:12:43,940 --> 02:12:44,060
Awesome.

4164
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:45,500
Why do we get... I got a limax.

4165
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:46,800
If you guys want, for some reason?

4166
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:47,440
Yeah, I need it.

4167
02:12:49,620 --> 02:12:50,960
We got zones still.

4168
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,040
Like, we're still chilling in zone.

4169
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:52,760
Okay.

4170
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:54,560
Two bad still cells.

4171
02:12:56,220 --> 02:12:57,560
One bad steak cell.

4172
02:12:59,000 --> 02:12:59,800
One bat.

4173
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:00,480
Oh, wait.

4174
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:02,300
13 shield cells.

4175
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:03,920
If anyone needs shield cells.

4176
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:04,460
I hate this.

4177
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:08,160
Give some to Dita.

4178
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:10,480
I gave three.

4179
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:12,600
I'm watching left side here.

4180
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:13,860
We can maybe trip out of here.

4181
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:16,360
Oh, look at this guy.

4182
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,200
One HP on a Watson.

4183
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:20,100
Oh, I'm coming back.

4184
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,480
That's the Watson team in there.

4185
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:25,900
Someone's rezzing there.

4186
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,840
I kind of want to get close here and grieve this team.

4187
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,280
Okay.

4188
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:30,080
I'm pushing up.

4189
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:31,060
One.

4190
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:31,720
I'm pushing up.

4191
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:32,100
Let's fuck them up.

4192
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:32,540
Let's get the building.

4193
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:34,120
I can put a wall.

4194
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:36,180
I don't think we need it.

4195
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:36,760
Okay.

4196
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:38,560
Oh, he's on the fucking door.

4197
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:39,900
But I'm good.

4198
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:40,140
I'm good.

4199
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:40,400
I'm good.

4200
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:41,700
I'm gonna destoy the door.

4201
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:42,580
I'm gonna destoy the door.

4202
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:43,740
I'm gonna take their door actually.

4203
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:44,760
I got a bat.

4204
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:47,800
I'm gonna get on the window.

4205
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:48,440
I took the door.

4206
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:50,100
That's theirs.

4207
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,520
They're on the stairs.

4208
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:54,500
They're vanguarded.

4209
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:56,960
They have a JN on the left stair.

4210
02:13:57,740 --> 02:13:59,180
I can get rid of the door whenever.

4211
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:02,440
Wait, wait, wait.

4212
02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:02,880
You're okay?

4213
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:04,780
Who's shooting you?

4214
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:06,760
New team or?

4215
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:07,760
No, no.

4216
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:08,820
The same team.

4217
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:09,640
They're coming to me.

4218
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:10,220
They're coming to me.

4219
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:11,320
I'm looking for you.

4220
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:11,760
I'm looking for you.

4221
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:12,480
I'm looking for you.

4222
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:12,980
They're not.

4223
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:13,680
They're not.

4224
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:14,240
They're not.

4225
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:14,640
They're not.

4226
02:14:14,740 --> 02:14:14,920
They're not.

4227
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:18,280
They're beaming me around the fucking whole corner apparently.

4228
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:18,900
They're coming.

4229
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:19,160
They're coming.

4230
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:19,320
Oh.

4231
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:20,700
What the fuck is that?

4232
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:24,880
I might need help.

4233
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:25,220
Kill this guy.

4234
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:25,540
Kill this guy.

4235
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:25,740
He's alone.

4236
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:27,520
How can he know?

4237
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:29,140
How can he know?

4238
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:30,060
I got it.

4239
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:30,340
Yeah.

4240
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,220
I died around the whole corner.

4241
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:35,020
That was bullshit.

4242
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:38,820
What am I supposed to do there?

4243
02:14:40,060 --> 02:14:41,340
I think this is your team.

4244
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:42,620
I'm fucking fucking cornered.

4245
02:14:42,620 --> 02:14:42,940
Oh, no.

4246
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:43,780
This is Linkzer's team.

4247
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:44,820
This is Linkzer's team.

4248
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:46,020
I see.

4249
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:49,480
Fucking 200 ping Andy.

4250
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:50,680
Of course I'm on the corner.

4251
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:53,660
Wait, but Linkzer's also EU.

4252
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:55,180
Yeah.

4253
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:56,140
It's double ping.

4254
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:58,120
You guys could run corners even more.

4255
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:01,760
On his skin, I was probably still on the building.

4256
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:04,900
On his skin, I was probably still on the building.

4257
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:05,420
I was really way back.

4258
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:08,480
But why didn't you both cancel each other out?

4259
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:10,300
But why didn't you both cancel each other out?

4260
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:12,500
Yeah, it's double ping.

4261
02:15:12,580 --> 02:15:13,080
I have 200.

4262
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:13,880
He has 200.

4263
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:16,340
It's like 400 minus that.

4264
02:15:16,380 --> 02:15:16,820
It's crazy.

4265
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:19,880
It's crazy, dude.

4266
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:21,020
It's double ping.

4267
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:27,780
It's double ping.

4268
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:28,320
It's crazy.

4269
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:33,660
Oh, they're dead.

4270
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:34,560
Yeah, Karma.

4271
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:34,900
Yeah.

4272
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:36,480
Yeah, Karma.

4273
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:36,920
Yeah.

4274
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:38,940
Oh my God.

4275
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:39,400
He afterhasted.

4276
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:39,600
Yeah, get fucked.

4277
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:41,740
Holy shit.

4278
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:43,420
He got me through the cold blood.

4279
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:45,220
They're being so hard.

4280
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:53,240
By the way, the team in the first place you said is Hachi and Kaisa.

4281
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:55,140
You're lying out of your ass.

4282
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,220
It's 0-0.

4283
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:57,740
No, it is.

4284
02:15:57,980 --> 02:15:58,780
No, it's 0-0.

4285
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:00,260
No, it's numbnuts.

4286
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:01,480
What are you...

4287
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:03,060
It's 0-0.

4288
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:04,780
Oh yeah, it is.

4289
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:09,660
Who are they?

4290
02:16:09,740 --> 02:16:10,200
I don't know.

4291
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:11,920
0-0 and Jaycee.

4292
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:12,940
I don't know who these people are.

4293
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:14,480
0-0 is a literal active pro.

4294
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:16,100
I don't know who these people are.

4295
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:20,900
You're just straight lying.

4296
02:16:21,940 --> 02:16:23,520
We're just lying now.

4297
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:26,640
You didn't fact check me.

4298
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:29,360
I just fact checked you.

4299
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:30,960
It took you like so long.

4300
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:32,360
They're literally three pregs.

4301
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:33,480
Like you're on some shit.

4302
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:35,020
They're actually 19th place.

4303
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:37,720
Yeah, I know.

4304
02:16:37,720 --> 02:16:38,360
I just saw.

4305
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:42,100
I'm like, dude, Kaisa and Hachi are destroying this lobby.

4306
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,780
You're just straight lying out of your ass.

4307
02:16:45,180 --> 02:16:46,300
I wasn't lying.

4308
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:47,660
I read it wrong.

4309
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:50,060
Read it wrong?

4310
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:52,160
What did you turn the leaderboard upside down?

4311
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:52,840
What happened?

4312
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,520
I told you I'm not that smart.

4313
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:58,260
You're the one that didn't fact check the dumb person.

4314
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,440
You're the one that didn't fact check the dumb person.

4315
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:02,520
No, you're right.

4316
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:03,780
I should never trust my teammates.

4317
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:05,860
You're right.

4318
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,180
You're the IGL.

4319
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:09,300
You should think for yourself.

4320
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:12,760
Yeah, you're right.

4321
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:13,800
This is my mistake.

4322
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:14,680
It is.

4323
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:17,560
It is my mistake to ever trust you in anything.

4324
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,520
As the IGL, you should know I was wrong.

4325
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:22,740
That you're a liar.

4326
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:23,060
Yeah.

4327
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:23,700
I got it.

4328
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:25,760
I mean, I admitted it right off the bat.

4329
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:28,380
I mean, yeah.

4330
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:29,180
But still.

4331
02:17:29,680 --> 02:17:35,400
The fact that you continue to trust me after I said I'm a liar.

4332
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:35,840
The fact that you continue to trust me after I said I'm a liar.

4333
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:37,140
It's really your fault.

4334
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:39,620
I might as well have you on mute.

4335
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:42,140
Because you're lying the entire time.

4336
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:44,060
No, because I tell you when people are there.

4337
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:44,960
You can't mute me.

4338
02:17:45,940 --> 02:17:47,060
Nah, I think I'm good.

4339
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:49,680
You might be even lying about that shit.

4340
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:50,120
Who knows?

4341
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:58,220
You're not having fun, though?

4342
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:00,080
Aren't you having fun?

4343
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:02,360
Yeah, it's great fun.

4344
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:02,840
Wow.

4345
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:04,860
So much fun.

4346
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:05,380
Right, Ditto?

4347
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:06,980
Yeah.

4348
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:12,060
That was the worst yeah I ever heard in my life.

4349
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:15,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4350
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:19,600
I'm having the best time of my life, friends.

4351
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:23,820
I can trust you.

4352
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:25,820
I can trust her, dude.

4353
02:18:26,060 --> 02:18:26,520
I can.

4354
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:30,480
How many people are in the same team?

4355
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:37,580
FUDA and Zero Nothing play on the same ALGS team.

4356
02:18:40,420 --> 02:18:41,700
Last call?

4357
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:42,340
I'll say that again.

4358
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:52,340
FUDA and Zero Nothing the members of the first place team are playing in the same ALGS team.

4359
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:55,080
Yeah, but anybody can sign up for ALGS.

4360
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:56,520
The teammates in ALGS.

4361
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,500
Anybody can sign up for ALGS.

4362
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:04,460
Zero Nothing has been playing pro for five years.

4363
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:06,160
Yeah, but he's never made it.

4364
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:09,760
What do you mean he's never made it?

4365
02:19:09,780 --> 02:19:12,660
He's been on G2 and like many other orgs.

4366
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:13,380
What are you on about?

4367
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:17,700
Yeah, but I don't know who he is so he's never made it.

4368
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:20,220
Oh my god.

4369
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:21,460
You're such a narcissist.

4370
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:22,200
It's insane.

4371
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:28,060
She thinks the world revolves around her.

4372
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:28,680
Thank you.

4373
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:30,280
25 kills.

4374
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:32,000
They have 25 kills.

4375
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:33,060
Yeah, bro.

4376
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:36,040
They're playing ALGS against a couple of VTubers.

4377
02:19:36,220 --> 02:19:36,960
That's what I'm saying.

4378
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:38,560
This is not a VTuber tournament.

4379
02:19:39,180 --> 02:19:41,140
Because there's not enough VTubers.

4380
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:44,780
There's not enough VTubers to make a VTuber tournament.

4381
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:46,400
I'm flaming them.

4382
02:19:53,230 --> 02:19:54,870
This is my reality.

4383
02:19:55,090 --> 02:19:58,310
If I don't know who they are they never made it.

4384
02:19:58,810 --> 02:20:00,510
I told them to pack their bags.

4385
02:20:00,650 --> 02:20:00,990
They're done.

4386
02:20:01,170 --> 02:20:02,110
They're done for the day.

4387
02:20:03,150 --> 02:20:05,430
Wait, how did they get into a VTuber tournament?

4388
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:06,670
Wait a minute.

4389
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:09,310
That's actually a good question.

4390
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:11,710
How did they get into a VTuber tournament?

4391
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:20,670
Because I don't understand the other pro players because they know VTubers.

4392
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:23,490
Wait, which VTuber do they know?

4393
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:27,510
I don't think they have a VTuber on their team.

4394
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:28,670
Wait, what?

4395
02:20:29,010 --> 02:20:29,870
Why are they here?

4396
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:32,710
Wait.

4397
02:20:33,030 --> 02:20:34,210
Why are they here?

4398
02:20:34,750 --> 02:20:36,610
I would assume they would have at least one.

4399
02:20:36,930 --> 02:20:38,410
One VTuber.

4400
02:20:38,410 --> 02:20:41,990
They're literally playing ALGS and we're here in kindergarten.

4401
02:20:42,670 --> 02:20:44,810
Wait, people are actually saying they don't have one?

4402
02:20:44,830 --> 02:20:46,090
Wait, what the fuck?

4403
02:20:46,210 --> 02:20:49,730
They don't even have a VTuber on their team?

4404
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:51,970
They don't even have a VTuber on their team?

4405
02:20:51,970 --> 02:20:52,370
No, they don't.

4406
02:20:52,450 --> 02:20:53,490
They actually don't?

4407
02:20:54,650 --> 02:20:56,730
Isn't this a VTuber tournament?

4408
02:20:57,170 --> 02:20:57,550
No?

4409
02:20:57,990 --> 02:21:00,150
By name.

4410
02:21:04,630 --> 02:21:05,870
By name.

4411
02:21:05,870 --> 02:21:06,030
By name.

4412
02:21:06,030 --> 02:21:08,570
It's supposed to be a VTuber tournament.

4413
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:09,970
No.

4414
02:21:10,090 --> 02:21:13,130
We're over here playing in kindergarten league and they're playing ALGS.

4415
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:14,290
This is not fair.

4416
02:21:16,090 --> 02:21:19,330
Their 3D model is just that insane.

4417
02:21:19,810 --> 02:21:19,930
Their 3D model is just that insane.

4418
02:21:25,650 --> 02:21:28,130
Guys, you don't understand guys.

4419
02:21:28,350 --> 02:21:35,510
To be fair, there's not enough NA Apex VTubers or EU Apex VTubers to be fair.

4420
02:21:38,170 --> 02:21:40,930
Type 1 in chat to kick nominates out of the tournament.

4421
02:21:41,310 --> 02:21:42,190
Everyone's typing 1.

4422
02:21:42,350 --> 02:21:43,550
Alright, pack your bags.

4423
02:21:43,650 --> 02:21:47,270
To be fair, they're all from EU and you know how bad EU prize is.

4424
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:48,550
You don't make money in EU.

4425
02:21:50,990 --> 02:21:52,190
They need this.

4426
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:56,830
I mean, in my...

4427
02:21:56,830 --> 02:21:57,410
Is that bad?

4428
02:21:59,090 --> 02:22:01,430
EU is pretty bad when it comes to prize pools.

4429
02:22:01,590 --> 02:22:02,210
You know that.

4430
02:22:05,010 --> 02:22:08,530
How many points do they get?

4431
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:11,150
Bro, they got 25 kills, man.

4432
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:24,360
I think they've had multiple 20 kill games in this lobby.

4433
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,220
I mean, they're running at people who don't even play this game.

4434
02:22:28,340 --> 02:22:30,960
Not don't play, but obviously not that much.

4435
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:31,220
I mean, they're at level.

4436
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:32,900
So it's very easy for them to run.

4437
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,880
Yeah, but I'm saying it's so fucking unbalanced.

4438
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:36,020
No one can say anything.

4439
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:39,420
We have ALGS team in first place and then everyone else.

4440
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:41,740
They have like 100 points already.

4441
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,720
What are we playing?

4442
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:44,240
For a second.

4443
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:49,040
We're here for a second place.

4444
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:50,780
What did I sign up for?

4445
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:58,980
I think even if we killed everyone in the lobby and won the game and respawn farm them, we can't catch up to them.

4446
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:05,200
We need to go on like a...

4447
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:10,860
We need to respawn farm every single team once in this lobby and we still wouldn't catch up to them.

4448
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:16,020
Wait, even with respawn farm, what if we all work together with the other teams and just respawn farm them?

4449
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:17,780
That's what I said.

4450
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:20,660
Kick them out the tournament.

4451
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:24,120
Yeah, but they're still going to be first place no matter what.

4452
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:26,520
Delete the VODs!

4453
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:27,560
Delete their points!

4454
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:28,260
Move along!

4455
02:23:32,510 --> 02:23:34,050
I'd deal with them quick then.

4456
02:23:34,110 --> 02:23:35,950
Second place is first place now guys.

4457
02:23:38,130 --> 02:23:40,130
Yeah, first place no bread.

4458
02:23:40,290 --> 02:23:41,310
Second place all bread.

4459
02:23:41,450 --> 02:23:44,750
And also wherever we land should be like an extra prize pool.

4460
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:47,430
Guys, just start the game.

4461
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:48,990
Guys, I don't care!

4462
02:23:49,210 --> 02:23:50,250
Just let me leave!

4463
02:23:53,530 --> 02:23:58,350
Guys, if they're trying to fix what to do with the first place team, I don't care.

4464
02:23:58,790 --> 02:24:00,330
GG go next.

4465
02:24:00,610 --> 02:24:02,590
I just started so much drama bro.

4466
02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:06,350
I don't care!

4467
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:11,290
Bro, it's literally the first place was literally $125!

4468
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:13,270
I don't care!

4469
02:24:13,770 --> 02:24:17,850
I just started so much drama I'm just going to sit here and laugh.

4470
02:24:17,850 --> 02:24:21,570
I only got an Akasupa to just like in the beginning of the stream.

4471
02:24:21,630 --> 02:24:23,770
I already made more than the tournament.

4472
02:24:23,990 --> 02:24:24,490
Just go!

4473
02:24:25,250 --> 02:24:26,070
I just started this part.

4474
02:24:26,190 --> 02:24:31,750
I just started this part and I'm just going to relax and watch it unfold before my eyes.

4475
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:33,570
This is the best entertainment.

4476
02:24:34,110 --> 02:24:35,590
Akasupa, what did you do?

4477
02:24:35,650 --> 02:24:36,450
This is so good.

4478
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:40,230
You're going to be late to your fucking other stream.

4479
02:24:42,530 --> 02:24:44,430
We're ahead of schedule!

4480
02:24:44,690 --> 02:24:44,850
This is karma.

4481
02:24:44,910 --> 02:24:46,830
This is karma for your gaslighting.

4482
02:24:46,830 --> 02:24:48,730
This is karma for your gaslighting.

4483
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:51,610
This is karma for your gaslighting.

4484
02:24:51,610 --> 02:24:53,490
No matter what I said I was going to leave exactly at 3.

4485
02:24:53,610 --> 02:24:54,330
It doesn't matter.

4486
02:24:54,410 --> 02:24:56,670
I would leave in the middle of the game if I have to.

4487
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:57,310
This is karma.

4488
02:24:58,770 --> 02:25:00,030
My Minhera activated.

4489
02:25:00,450 --> 02:25:02,590
I'm starting drama, bro.

4490
02:25:02,830 --> 02:25:04,110
Next is the Linksr.

4491
02:25:04,310 --> 02:25:04,830
Linksr!

4492
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:08,990
Dude, Linksr next!

4493
02:25:09,210 --> 02:25:10,130
He's a current pro!

4494
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:13,510
Where's your VTuber?

4495
02:25:14,310 --> 02:25:16,310
Start kicking motherfuckers at the lobby!

4496
02:25:16,570 --> 02:25:18,470
Kick all the 3D models out!

4497
02:25:19,830 --> 02:25:20,350
I'm starting shit now!

4498
02:25:20,350 --> 02:25:21,590
I'm starting shit now!

4499
02:25:22,470 --> 02:25:24,350
He is in his Minhera mode.

4500
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:26,390
Oh, you don't have a VTuber?

4501
02:25:26,510 --> 02:25:27,010
Oh!

4502
02:25:28,230 --> 02:25:28,910
Oh my god.

4503
02:25:29,090 --> 02:25:29,810
I'll be out.

4504
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:30,450
You don't have a VTuber model?

4505
02:25:32,630 --> 02:25:33,510
You're out!

4506
02:25:34,870 --> 02:25:36,230
No VTuber model.

4507
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:37,650
No play.

4508
02:25:48,260 --> 02:25:49,780
Ken said I gotta go.

4509
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:51,080
He called me KN.

4510
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:51,960
Holy shit.

4511
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:53,080
AHHHH!

4512
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,040
Why aren't we I... I... Wait.

4513
02:25:57,160 --> 02:25:58,120
Why aren't we starting?

4514
02:25:58,320 --> 02:25:59,120
I'm so confused.

4515
02:25:59,300 --> 02:25:59,540
Why?

4516
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:01,140
I actually don't know.

4517
02:26:01,220 --> 02:26:01,940
I actually think...

4518
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:03,600
I might have started some shit.

4519
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:06,340
Did you... Maybe like people are yelling...

4520
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:06,780
Bro!

4521
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:09,740
What if people are raiding the poor organizer stream?

4522
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:11,180
I mean...

4523
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:13,400
Wait.

4524
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:19,440
If you're going on the organizer stream and talking shit, I do not claim you.

4525
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:20,280
Stop talking shit.

4526
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:26,160
I actually do not do that.

4527
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:27,660
Don't be weird.

4528
02:26:28,040 --> 02:26:28,980
It's all fucking memes.

4529
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:32,440
We'll only talk shit behind the scenes.

4530
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:33,780
Yeah.

4531
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:35,180
Don't talk shit to their face, bro.

4532
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,980
Do it, Bob.

4533
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:39,520
Yeah.

4534
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:41,540
RPR is teaching us a lesson right now.

4535
02:26:41,660 --> 02:26:44,000
Talk shit behind their backs.

4536
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:45,600
Is that right, RPR?

4537
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:46,780
Is that right?

4538
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:48,560
That's what you said, not me!

4539
02:26:48,980 --> 02:26:51,940
I literally reiterated what you just said!

4540
02:26:53,740 --> 02:26:55,340
I just rephrased it.

4541
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:58,600
I said don't go in their chat and talk shit.

4542
02:26:58,640 --> 02:27:01,780
You said don't go in their chat and talk shit in their face.

4543
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:05,360
Yeah, but you were talking shit behind their backs this entire time.

4544
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:07,420
It's called a joke!

4545
02:27:10,120 --> 02:27:11,520
Yeah, sure.

4546
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:12,340
A joke.

4547
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:14,600
You lost your humor?

4548
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:16,800
Like you don't know what jokes are anymore?

4549
02:27:16,980 --> 02:27:17,720
Like what happened?

4550
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:21,920
But you didn't say it on sarcasm!

4551
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:27,040
Do I have to say slash s at the end of every sentence?

4552
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:28,080
Like what is this, Twitter?

4553
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:28,840
Yes.

4554
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:32,380
I'm a little special.

4555
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:35,440
I can't read people's sarcasm.

4556
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:37,240
Trust me, we know you're special.

4557
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:38,680
I'm a little bit.

4558
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:41,780
I think...

4559
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:42,940
Wait, what do you think?

4560
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:43,400
What do you think?

4561
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:46,280
What does that mean?

4562
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:47,600
What does that mean?

4563
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:48,100
What does that mean?

4564
02:27:49,460 --> 02:27:50,160
No, nothing.

4565
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:51,160
Let's go lend.

4566
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:53,760
On our lending spot.

4567
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:54,900
Yeah.

4568
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:56,620
Ditto, you're a jump master.

4569
02:27:57,580 --> 02:27:57,980
Okay.

4570
02:27:59,300 --> 02:28:00,000
So far.

4571
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:04,500
So I say we just fucking...

4572
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:06,760
I don't fucking... let's just kill everyone.

4573
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:08,420
And if we kill them, we kill them, they die.

4574
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:10,360
You said we were going to kill everybody, but we didn't kill everybody.

4575
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:11,200
We kept running away.

4576
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:13,340
We ran into the first place team!

4577
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:14,300
What do you want from me?

4578
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:17,160
You got three breads and two poor pro players.

4579
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:17,720
What can I do?

4580
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:21,240
I did a thousand damage, we still didn't kill anyone.

4581
02:28:23,020 --> 02:28:24,380
What more can I do?

4582
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:25,860
Two thousand damage.

4583
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:27,600
If I had controller, I'd 1v3.

4584
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:31,580
Plug it in, you literally have your roiler next to you.

4585
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:34,320
I can't do that.

4586
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:35,500
I can't play tournament controllers.

4587
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:37,640
That's so beneath me, it's insane.

4588
02:28:38,420 --> 02:28:47,500
I would lose all my fucking achievements I've ever made in like five seconds for plugging in controller during tournament.

4589
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:49,260
People love roller players.

4590
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:50,160
Look at Jen Burton.

4591
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:53,280
Someone in my chat said, is TSM playing?

4592
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:54,760
We're literally TSM.

4593
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:57,940
Yeah, we're literally TSM.

4594
02:28:58,180 --> 02:29:00,920
TSM is in this tournament, guys.

4595
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:02,120
TSM is in this tournament, guys.

4596
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:03,700
Guys, we're in a tournament with TSM, chat.

4597
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:04,760
Guys, we're in a tournament with TSM, chat.

4598
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:06,180
We are TSM.

4599
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:08,040
What do you mean with TSM?

4600
02:29:08,340 --> 02:29:11,140
Yeah, we got signed.

4601
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:15,100
We literally got signed.

4602
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:17,680
We are TSM.

4603
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:19,740
Gotta say, this version of TSM kinda sucks ass.

4604
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:22,520
Yeah, but you're the IGL, so it is your fault.

4605
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:26,400
That's not how things work in life.

4606
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:28,280
You can't just blame everything on the game leader.

4607
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:29,120
Yes, you can.

4608
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:30,680
That's the whole point of having an NG leader.

4609
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:32,240
You have to reflect on your own actions sometimes.

4610
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:35,640
Yeah, but my NG leader doesn't teach me well.

4611
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:37,560
Well, teach you what?

4612
02:29:37,620 --> 02:29:38,440
You're unteachable.

4613
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:39,640
I'm not.

4614
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:43,160
I won first place in the Tekken tournament.

4615
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:45,700
And I was taught to be better.

4616
02:29:45,700 --> 02:29:47,180
Okay, it's not Apex Legends.

4617
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:49,020
Nope, but it's competitive.

4618
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:53,780
Sure.

4619
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:57,980
Are you trying to say fighting games are not competitive?

4620
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:00,240
No, I think Street Fighter is competitive.

4621
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:01,180
Yeah, okay.

4622
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:01,800
What about Tekken?

4623
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:03,940
Yeah, yeah.

4624
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:06,940
You don't think Tekken is competitive?

4625
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:09,260
Yeah, yeah.

4626
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:10,820
That's fucked up.

4627
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:12,240
Guys, he doesn't think Tekken is competitive.

4628
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:16,620
I think whatever game you play is just not competitive.

4629
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:17,980
So I play Apex.

4630
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:19,840
Exactly.

4631
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:21,640
So Apex is not competitive.

4632
02:30:21,900 --> 02:30:24,880
So your achievements don't count because Apex isn't competitive.

4633
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:27,060
No, when I played it was competitive.

4634
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,020
Now it's just us.

4635
02:30:28,660 --> 02:30:29,500
Now it's just us.

4636
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:30,140
That's how things work out.

4637
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:36,000
You think this game is competitive?

4638
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:39,320
Like this game is the most RNG bullshit on the planet.

4639
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:43,440
Like it's probably the least competitive.

4640
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:43,460
It's a BR.

4641
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:47,360
When you used to play it, when you used to play it, it was even more RNG than before.

4642
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:49,020
No, no, no.

4643
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:51,200
It was less RNG because there was no aim assist involved.

4644
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:53,240
You actually took skill to shoot people.

4645
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:54,180
Okay, we have to go gap.

4646
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:55,280
Okay.

4647
02:30:55,540 --> 02:30:57,080
Oh my god, we got zone.

4648
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:57,800
I'm gonna cry.

4649
02:30:58,320 --> 02:30:58,760
Yeah.

4650
02:30:59,420 --> 02:31:00,400
I don't want zone.

4651
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:02,520
I thought we were gonna run at people.

4652
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:03,600
What happened?

4653
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:05,740
We can't run at people if you have zone.

4654
02:31:06,100 --> 02:31:07,540
Like why do we keep giving a zone?

4655
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:08,260
No!

4656
02:31:09,400 --> 02:31:10,820
What is wrong with them?

4657
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:15,000
I don't want to be in zone.

4658
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:16,320
It's scary.

4659
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:20,440
I need...

4660
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:26,960
Any game that allows an AI computer to aim for you is not a competitive game.

4661
02:31:27,140 --> 02:31:27,700
Any game that allows an AI computer to aim for you is not a competitive game.

4662
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:28,280
Maybe you're just...

4663
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:30,020
In a mixed input environment.

4664
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:32,780
Just shoot better than a controller player.

4665
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,280
Just use your movement.

4666
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:37,260
I mean if I install aimbot, I got that.

4667
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:38,380
Why do you say ditto?

4668
02:31:39,400 --> 02:31:40,700
I'm gonna go gap though.

4669
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:41,220
Okay.

4670
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:42,960
I'll cover you.

4671
02:31:44,300 --> 02:31:45,580
I need to open this red bin.

4672
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:47,940
There's people over there on the left.

4673
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:49,740
Already?

4674
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:51,460
People are shooting already.

4675
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:52,560
Wait, people are shooting.

4676
02:31:55,360 --> 02:31:58,040
People are literally shooting each other and going to zone now.

4677
02:31:58,480 --> 02:31:59,940
There's a fight here.

4678
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:01,780
Let's go up top.

4679
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:03,640
I mean, oh my god, this is so sad.

4680
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:04,560
We don't get loot.

4681
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:05,940
We don't get evos.

4682
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:07,080
They just cucked us.

4683
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:07,960
Why do we get zone?

4684
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:09,980
Because they hate us.

4685
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:10,720
I hate getting zone.

4686
02:32:13,340 --> 02:32:14,400
They hate us.

4687
02:32:14,420 --> 02:32:14,960
So stupid.

4688
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:19,900
We can do anything with this.

4689
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:22,380
We got zone like three times out of six games.

4690
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:25,680
I think Kuro is literally just grieving us on purpose.

4691
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:28,800
Like he's placing these zones around our fucking forehead.

4692
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:31,180
They're fighting kinda.

4693
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:32,420
Which way?

4694
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:34,260
They're not gonna fight.

4695
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:36,340
They were fighting earlier.

4696
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:37,220
I saw them.

4697
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:39,180
It's this team and this team.

4698
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:40,700
They're smoking and like poking.

4699
02:32:40,860 --> 02:32:41,480
Oh, there's nades.

4700
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:42,460
Granata.

4701
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:43,600
Granata number one, two.

4702
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:45,400
I'm gonna check behind us.

4703
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:47,820
It's fucking Catalyst.

4704
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,680
They're never gonna fucking fight.

4705
02:32:49,940 --> 02:32:51,600
This guy just made a double door.

4706
02:32:51,820 --> 02:32:53,300
Oh, is that one knock?

4707
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:56,480
No, they killed a player.

4708
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,300
I'm gonna get this door.

4709
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:03,420
And then this door.

4710
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:08,820
And then I'm gonna put...

4711
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:11,840
I'm gonna put spikes right here.

4712
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:13,480
I'm gonna put spikes right here.

4713
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:13,920
Why am I lagging?

4714
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:15,760
Why am I lagging?

4715
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:17,220
Again?

4716
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:19,800
I'm always lagging.

4717
02:33:19,940 --> 02:33:21,040
Where are they?

4718
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:23,280
I don't know where.

4719
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:25,640
They got Crypt ulted.

4720
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:30,320
That shit's crazy.

4721
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:32,060
That shit's crazy.

4722
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:35,300
I'm gonna put all the spikes below us.

4723
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:36,360
Not above us.

4724
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:37,180
Look at this shit.

4725
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:39,320
You get zoned and then what?

4726
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:40,700
You sit here.

4727
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:41,940
No bats, none.

4728
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:43,240
I have...

4729
02:33:43,820 --> 02:33:44,800
Four bats.

4730
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:46,900
You have six bats.

4731
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:48,280
I got one number four.

4732
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:50,860
Oh, I hear your bat.

4733
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:52,080
Thank you.

4734
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:55,380
Oh, look.

4735
02:33:55,380 --> 02:33:56,020
Reemploy, reemploy.

4736
02:34:00,210 --> 02:34:01,190
They're gonna take it.

4737
02:34:01,350 --> 02:34:02,670
Yeah, they made it.

4738
02:34:02,890 --> 02:34:03,870
Come on, come on then.

4739
02:34:05,230 --> 02:34:06,570
You're going to our left here?

4740
02:34:09,530 --> 02:34:10,630
You're going to the nut.

4741
02:34:10,870 --> 02:34:12,070
They landed on the nut.

4742
02:34:12,350 --> 02:34:14,070
Yeah, they're gonna nut.

4743
02:34:15,450 --> 02:34:15,930
Huh?

4744
02:34:16,530 --> 02:34:17,430
They're gonna nut.

4745
02:34:18,430 --> 02:34:19,310
They're going to nut.

4746
02:34:19,970 --> 02:34:20,690
20 flesh!

4747
02:34:21,490 --> 02:34:21,930
Where?

4748
02:34:21,970 --> 02:34:22,310
Nut?

4749
02:34:23,450 --> 02:34:24,650
Oh yeah, they're nutting.

4750
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:29,340
Wait, numbnuts died.

4751
02:34:29,740 --> 02:34:30,680
They fight...

4752
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:31,960
They can bleed!

4753
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:33,760
Who would've thought?

4754
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:35,980
How the fuck did you...

4755
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:37,180
How did they die in this lobby?

4756
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:42,080
We need a water review.

4757
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:43,820
We need a water review.

4758
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:45,660
How do you die to fucking VTubers?

4759
02:34:46,700 --> 02:34:47,820
Fucking VTubers?

4760
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:48,980
How do you die?

4761
02:34:49,140 --> 02:34:49,800
It's so embarrassing.

4762
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:52,360
That is so embarrassing.

4763
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:53,020
God.

4764
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:57,160
I know, you went to pro league.

4765
02:34:57,240 --> 02:34:58,200
How do you die?

4766
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:00,820
That's like Swede dying to a VTuber.

4767
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:02,760
I know, that's so embarrassing.

4768
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:04,140
So embarrassing.

4769
02:35:04,580 --> 02:35:06,220
Fuck, I'd never die to a VTuber.

4770
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:07,660
Okay.

4771
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:11,500
Active pro dying to VTubers is crazy.

4772
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:15,440
It's like dying to an Overwatch player.

4773
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:19,980
One of the most accomplished IGLs in the world dying to a VTuber is actually like just...

4774
02:35:19,980 --> 02:35:21,900
You died to an Overwatch player too.

4775
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:24,080
You died to a VTuber and an Overwatch player.

4776
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:25,860
I didn't.

4777
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:26,940
Yes you did, you died to Surefour.

4778
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:30,100
Yeah, but I died to an Overwatch player.

4779
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:31,920
I didn't die to a pro Overwatch player.

4780
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:33,480
Yeah, so you died to both Apex and...

4781
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:34,560
I didn't die to a VTuber.

4782
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:36,340
No, no, no.

4783
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:39,380
Surefour killed me, therefore I died to an Overwatch player.

4784
02:35:39,740 --> 02:35:40,500
Surefour killed me, therefore I died to an Overwatch player.

4785
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:43,180
He has a VTuber model that he doesn't use, therefore he's not a VTuber.

4786
02:35:43,180 --> 02:35:43,260
He has a VTuber model that he doesn't use, therefore he's not a VTuber.

4787
02:35:43,260 --> 02:35:44,180
He uses it every Wednesday.

4788
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:46,640
What the fuck?

4789
02:35:46,700 --> 02:35:47,440
He changed.

4790
02:35:48,620 --> 02:35:50,020
I remember when he was like...

4791
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:52,060
I don't want to use it.

4792
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:53,400
I don't want to.

4793
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:55,440
Yeah, so you did die to a VTuber.

4794
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:56,820
Oh, he's low.

4795
02:35:56,900 --> 02:35:57,320
He's fresh.

4796
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:59,240
No, back then he wasn't a VTuber, so he didn't count.

4797
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:01,540
Which one, Ditto?

4798
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:02,140
Who's low?

4799
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:04,860
I'm just getting inside the building.

4800
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:05,860
Look at these guys.

4801
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:07,440
What are you guys walking in the open for, huh?

4802
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:11,420
Or just teleporting in the open more like it?

4803
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:13,760
Can I just grief?

4804
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:15,240
Like I really want to just grief.

4805
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:16,540
Grief who?

4806
02:36:17,820 --> 02:36:18,500
These guys.

4807
02:36:21,340 --> 02:36:23,340
Make sure there's nobody behind us.

4808
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:25,820
Yeah, you guys just make sure that...

4809
02:36:25,820 --> 02:36:26,440
I'm gonna grief.

4810
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:28,400
Alright, I'm gonna...

4811
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:29,540
Wait, what?

4812
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:30,280
Oh.

4813
02:36:30,980 --> 02:36:31,840
Yeah, they're fighting here.

4814
02:36:31,880 --> 02:36:33,460
Like this is so third party opera, but...

4815
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:34,520
Okay, okay, I'm ready.

4816
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:36,220
I'm looking.

4817
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:36,900
I'm heading over.

4818
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:37,320
And I'm cooking.

4819
02:36:37,540 --> 02:36:38,360
I'm looking and I'm cooking.

4820
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:40,820
Actually, you can... Yeah, we'll stay up here.

4821
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:42,620
One HP on one.

4822
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:43,900
Wait, he's so low.

4823
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:45,700
They're all low.

4824
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:46,380
No one died.

4825
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:48,720
They had to...

4826
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:49,480
We keep these guys out.

4827
02:36:51,380 --> 02:36:52,340
I'm gonna look behind us.

4828
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:53,020
I'm gonna look behind us.

4829
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:53,740
You guys...

4830
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:55,720
How did I not break the door?

4831
02:36:55,880 --> 02:36:57,360
I wanna make sure nobody comes behind us.

4832
02:36:58,380 --> 02:37:00,740
Cause we've had that happen too many times.

4833
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:02,900
I'm having a dorky moment.

4834
02:37:02,900 --> 02:37:04,180
They're running out on me.

4835
02:37:08,060 --> 02:37:09,160
I'm looking back to help.

4836
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:10,100
I can't.

4837
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:11,160
I don't understand his movement.

4838
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:13,560
Purple?

4839
02:37:13,740 --> 02:37:14,100
Purple?

4840
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:14,800
Coming up, coming up the ramp.

4841
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:15,320
Coming up the ramp.

4842
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:16,800
Yeah.

4843
02:37:17,060 --> 02:37:17,860
They're coming up here.

4844
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:19,300
Yeah, I saw them walking up.

4845
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:20,460
This is my old weather.

4846
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:22,920
I wanna fight this team.

4847
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:23,960
I want them dead.

4848
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:25,360
Okay.

4849
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:27,240
Are they up the ramp?

4850
02:37:27,700 --> 02:37:28,560
I don't see them.

4851
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:30,060
I don't know if they're below or...

4852
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:31,820
Oh, fucking below.

4853
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:32,980
Yeah, they went below.

4854
02:37:34,020 --> 02:37:35,000
Come on, pick it.

4855
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:36,080
Wait, there's a guy still there.

4856
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:37,200
Is this guy still in the building?

4857
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:38,920
Wait, what?

4858
02:37:39,060 --> 02:37:40,000
Yeah, I saw a guy.

4859
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:42,420
There's a guy literally right inside.

4860
02:37:43,060 --> 02:37:43,880
There's three people below.

4861
02:37:43,940 --> 02:37:44,660
I guess that's a rat.

4862
02:37:46,380 --> 02:37:47,660
It has to be a rat, right?

4863
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:48,660
He's like, literally he's inside.

4864
02:37:49,220 --> 02:37:49,580
Purple?

4865
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:52,720
He's still in zone.

4866
02:37:54,040 --> 02:37:54,780
There's two guys.

4867
02:37:55,180 --> 02:37:55,720
I think.

4868
02:37:56,140 --> 02:37:56,760
Be careful.

4869
02:37:56,940 --> 02:37:58,300
What is that bag over there?

4870
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:00,740
They came up.

4871
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:01,100
They came up.

4872
02:38:03,400 --> 02:38:04,440
There's two guys.

4873
02:38:05,380 --> 02:38:05,880
He's behind.

4874
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:06,420
They're behind.

4875
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:07,120
They're way behind.

4876
02:38:07,580 --> 02:38:08,220
They're in zone.

4877
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:09,280
I'm looking at them.

4878
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:13,040
There's no way they got meds for that.

4879
02:38:14,060 --> 02:38:16,180
You guys don't got the facilities for that big man.

4880
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:17,120
You guys don't got the facilities for that big man.

4881
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:17,620
Right here?

4882
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:18,280
I'm ping.

4883
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:19,020
They're under bridge.

4884
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:21,500
Oh, they went so far.

4885
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:22,760
We kill.

4886
02:38:22,820 --> 02:38:23,060
We kill.

4887
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:23,980
They're fighting there.

4888
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:24,600
They're fighting there.

4889
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:24,940
Up here.

4890
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:27,940
I'm gonna look for these guys in zone first.

4891
02:38:28,260 --> 02:38:29,440
I'm looking at them in zone.

4892
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:31,000
They're still in zone.

4893
02:38:31,820 --> 02:38:32,580
Yeah, they're right here.

4894
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:33,120
We're at ping.

4895
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:34,680
There's no way they have meds for this.

4896
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:36,680
I hit them once so they'll die.

4897
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:37,440
If they die...

4898
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:39,180
Wait, someone died to ring.

4899
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:39,660
Is that them?

4900
02:38:41,140 --> 02:38:41,760
Oh, no, no, no.

4901
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:41,980
I see him.

4902
02:38:42,120 --> 02:38:42,940
He's playing off.

4903
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:44,320
I hit him for the purple.

4904
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:46,020
He's running right side.

4905
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:47,100
Okay.

4906
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:50,700
What the fuck is he doing?

4907
02:38:52,140 --> 02:38:52,620
I don't know.

4908
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:53,240
He's right below me.

4909
02:38:54,300 --> 02:38:54,920
He's fighting me.

4910
02:38:56,340 --> 02:38:57,300
I can't see him.

4911
02:38:57,380 --> 02:38:58,020
I can't see him.

4912
02:38:58,080 --> 02:38:58,620
I can't see.

4913
02:38:58,700 --> 02:38:59,220
I can't see.

4914
02:39:00,180 --> 02:39:01,200
He's teleporting for me.

4915
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:02,080
Jesus Christ.

4916
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:02,820
Come help me.

4917
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:03,820
Let's kill this guy.

4918
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:06,360
He's gonna kill me.

4919
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:08,020
He went to the right.

4920
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:08,280
Nice.

4921
02:39:08,280 --> 02:39:08,780
I got him.

4922
02:39:09,060 --> 02:39:09,340
I got him.

4923
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:11,720
He must have meds.

4924
02:39:13,020 --> 02:39:14,400
Peem over here where I'm looking at.

4925
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:16,360
I knocked one.

4926
02:39:16,460 --> 02:39:16,940
I knocked one.

4927
02:39:17,020 --> 02:39:17,340
Okay.

4928
02:39:18,020 --> 02:39:18,740
I'm gonna push.

4929
02:39:19,620 --> 02:39:20,340
Where are you?

4930
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:22,340
Wait, I might be dead to zone.

4931
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:23,720
I live, bitch.

4932
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:26,540
Nice.

4933
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:26,900
Nice.

4934
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:27,580
Let's go.

4935
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:28,400
Fuck him up.

4936
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:29,280
I'm looking behind.

4937
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:31,740
I wanna make sure that nobody walks up to us.

4938
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:34,520
No mercy this game.

4939
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:35,040
No mercy.

4940
02:39:35,380 --> 02:39:35,700
I'm looking for over there.

4941
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:36,020
Over there.

4942
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:36,580
One team.

4943
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:37,360
New team.

4944
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:37,580
New team.

4945
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:38,920
They're flying.

4946
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:39,240
They're flying.

4947
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:41,200
I'm looking.

4948
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:42,500
Are you flying with me?

4949
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:43,000
I'm coming.

4950
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:43,300
I'm coming.

4951
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:43,820
I'm coming.

4952
02:39:44,020 --> 02:39:44,020
I'm coming.

4953
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:44,300
I'm coming.

4954
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:44,880
I'm coming.

4955
02:39:45,880 --> 02:39:46,280
I'm coming.

4956
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:46,860
I'm coming.

4957
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:51,380
I'm running low on heavy ammo.

4958
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:53,660
Red armor on my left.

4959
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:55,600
Ditto, watch for me.

4960
02:39:56,900 --> 02:39:56,900
Okay.

4961
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:57,180
Okay.

4962
02:39:57,300 --> 02:39:57,740
Okay.

4963
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:57,880
Okay.

4964
02:39:58,840 --> 02:39:59,280
Okay.

4965
02:39:59,680 --> 02:39:59,680
Okay.

4966
02:40:00,260 --> 02:40:01,220
That's a whole team behind.

4967
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:03,120
I don't have heavy ammo.

4968
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:05,100
I don't have heavy ammo either.

4969
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:06,600
I'm gonna change.

4970
02:40:06,940 --> 02:40:08,640
There's a lot of light ammo here.

4971
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:10,220
This three-man team is here, right?

4972
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:10,700
Yeah.

4973
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:11,940
They're fighting each other.

4974
02:40:12,340 --> 02:40:13,040
I knocked one.

4975
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:16,400
I knocked one.

4976
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:21,200
I'm past my game.

4977
02:40:21,660 --> 02:40:22,100
Flash.

4978
02:40:22,100 --> 02:40:22,780
Flash on lifeline.

4979
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:24,020
Focus this team.

4980
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:25,180
This team is like two down, I think.

4981
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:27,000
I think they're full dead, aren't they?

4982
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:28,220
No, no, no.

4983
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:28,460
They're not.

4984
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:28,680
They're not.

4985
02:40:28,940 --> 02:40:29,800
Because I knocked one.

4986
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:30,300
I didn't get the kill.

4987
02:40:30,340 --> 02:40:31,000
He's right below me here.

4988
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:32,600
Okay.

4989
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:33,120
Yeah, scan.

4990
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:33,660
Yeah, scan.

4991
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:34,680
Okay.

4992
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:34,960
Yeah.

4993
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:35,580
I'm gonna scan.

4994
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:35,780
Scan.

4995
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:38,800
I'm gonna cover you from this team, but I need energy ammo.

4996
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:41,220
It's just this guy down here.

4997
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:41,460
It's just this guy down here.

4998
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:43,340
Do you need help?

4999
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:43,860
Do you need help?

5000
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:45,880
No.

5001
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:46,860
This guy's just running.

5002
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:49,060
I want to find... Is there energy ammo?

5003
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:49,700
Oh, wait.

5004
02:40:49,720 --> 02:40:50,760
There might be people below us.

5005
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:51,620
I don't want to risk it.

5006
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:55,480
This bot is here solo.

5007
02:40:55,620 --> 02:40:56,760
His teammates are still crawling.

5008
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:00,660
I hear a support.

5009
02:41:00,680 --> 02:41:00,900
Over there.

5010
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:01,240
Over there.

5011
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:05,100
We don't want to stun the team.

5012
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:06,000
We don't want to stun the team.

5013
02:41:06,100 --> 02:41:06,340
Okay.

5014
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:08,940
I don't have energy ammo anymore, so...

5015
02:41:08,940 --> 02:41:09,840
I need to chill.

5016
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:12,860
I have 120 and... I can give it to you, Tom.

5017
02:41:13,180 --> 02:41:13,580
Okay.

5018
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:14,520
Thank you.

5019
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:16,860
I still didn't get my kill.

5020
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:18,220
Like, he's still just crawling.

5021
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:20,340
Yeah, I didn't get anything.

5022
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:20,860
I'm just going to kill him as well.

5023
02:41:22,260 --> 02:41:23,400
This guy's going for the package.

5024
02:41:26,120 --> 02:41:26,980
He's got red armor.

5025
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:30,560
I'm so laggy.

5026
02:41:30,560 --> 02:41:31,040
That's insane.

5027
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:34,600
How am I supposed to hit that teleporting looking ass?

5028
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:38,180
One guy in the way.

5029
02:41:38,280 --> 02:41:39,380
Oh, there he is.

5030
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,920
Where am I getting shot from?

5031
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:43,400
I'm out of heavy ammo completely.

5032
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,140
I have heavy.

5033
02:41:45,300 --> 02:41:45,540
I have heavy.

5034
02:41:45,580 --> 02:41:45,940
I can give you.

5035
02:41:47,180 --> 02:41:47,540
Okay.

5036
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:51,020
I might get walked up on...

5037
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:52,580
I hear Zip.

5038
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:55,540
I have spikes though, so...

5039
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:56,820
Yeah.

5040
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:59,120
Should we find... they also have spikes below us.

5041
02:41:59,780 --> 02:42:00,520
Wait, hold up.

5042
02:42:00,580 --> 02:42:02,960
I'm going to throw my Havoc here with like 30 bullets...

5043
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:03,320
No, Havoc.

5044
02:42:03,480 --> 02:42:03,680
Sorry.

5045
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:06,520
There's someone down here.

5046
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:07,780
Yeah, that's part of the scene.

5047
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:08,820
Okay.

5048
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:11,700
I'm going to play Sentinel to poke.

5049
02:42:13,400 --> 02:42:14,800
Somebody's flying... flying here.

5050
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:15,740
They're flying below.

5051
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:17,080
They're flying right here.

5052
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:18,160
I might fight.

5053
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:20,700
They're all the way down here.

5054
02:42:21,700 --> 02:42:23,200
There's more... oh, I'm going to take that.

5055
02:42:24,220 --> 02:42:26,260
60 on this Newcastle.

5056
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:27,420
I'm going to look here.

5057
02:42:27,500 --> 02:42:29,760
I'm going to look here because I don't have a spike here for us.

5058
02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:31,680
There's people smoking.

5059
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:32,440
I'm going to scan.

5060
02:42:32,660 --> 02:42:32,960
I'm going to scan.

5061
02:42:36,970 --> 02:42:37,590
Hallelujah grenade.

5062
02:42:37,810 --> 02:42:38,110
Okay, a quick one.

5063
02:42:39,610 --> 02:42:41,990
Let's see if I can grab some of those here.

5064
02:42:42,350 --> 02:42:42,710
No, just block over there.

5065
02:42:42,870 --> 02:42:44,990
Okay, they're fighting like crazy.

5066
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:46,430
Oh, I missed that.

5067
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:48,270
They're fighting here.

5068
02:42:51,430 --> 02:42:52,950
Was there a six times scope anywhere?

5069
02:42:53,870 --> 02:42:54,310
Uh...

5070
02:42:55,230 --> 02:42:56,130
I don't think so.

5071
02:42:56,310 --> 02:42:57,250
I don't know, honestly.

5072
02:42:57,390 --> 02:42:57,850
I didn't check.

5073
02:42:58,910 --> 02:43:00,170
I remember seeing one.

5074
02:43:00,370 --> 02:43:01,610
There's a team here.

5075
02:43:04,990 --> 02:43:06,030
Right below us.

5076
02:43:07,490 --> 02:43:09,510
There's a team here that's crafting.

5077
02:43:12,170 --> 02:43:12,710
There's a team here that's crafting.

5078
02:43:12,810 --> 02:43:13,870
Oh my god, a lot.

5079
02:43:13,990 --> 02:43:16,330
A lot of people but I don't have ammo.

5080
02:43:16,690 --> 02:43:17,990
Oh my god, this guy is one shot.

5081
02:43:18,170 --> 02:43:19,550
This guy has red armor.

5082
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:29,460
Oh, I have two mags left.

5083
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:29,980
I'm going to stop.

5084
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:31,500
I can't poke anymore.

5085
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:32,360
This guy is one.

5086
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:33,580
Nice.

5087
02:43:35,960 --> 02:43:37,180
Team here, one ping.

5088
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:38,240
They're fighting here too.

5089
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:40,760
I can't do anything.

5090
02:43:41,080 --> 02:43:42,140
This team is smoking us.

5091
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:44,780
And he's shooting me as well.

5092
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:45,840
Are you cheating, bastard?

5093
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:48,880
This team has to come to us.

5094
02:43:48,880 --> 02:43:49,700
This team has to come to us.

5095
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:52,560
Just watch only that team that's shooting.

5096
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:53,920
Only that team.

5097
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:55,980
You guys watch that, I'll watch everything else.

5098
02:43:56,300 --> 02:43:57,120
Yeah, I'm watching here.

5099
02:43:57,860 --> 02:43:59,260
Both of you watch here.

5100
02:43:59,480 --> 02:44:01,060
There's two teams.

5101
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:02,980
One to the right and one in front of me, Ditto.

5102
02:44:03,980 --> 02:44:04,540
Okay, okay.

5103
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:06,320
This team is moving to the right.

5104
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:09,540
Are they both moving to the right?

5105
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:10,680
They're both moving to the right.

5106
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:11,960
Yeah.

5107
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:17,200
I hate lag.

5108
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:26,150
Okay, that should have hit.

5109
02:44:26,390 --> 02:44:28,330
I don't want to waste ammo.

5110
02:44:28,490 --> 02:44:29,910
I'm just...

5111
02:44:30,310 --> 02:44:31,370
They're crafting here.

5112
02:44:31,490 --> 02:44:31,910
70.

5113
02:44:33,690 --> 02:44:34,790
They dropped to the left.

5114
02:44:36,090 --> 02:44:37,570
Okay, so they're not coming for us.

5115
02:44:37,930 --> 02:44:38,370
No.

5116
02:44:43,890 --> 02:44:45,110
This Puffin is 70.

5117
02:44:45,750 --> 02:44:46,970
I'm getting maggot drill.

5118
02:44:47,090 --> 02:44:50,150
Wow, this game went on longer now that there's like, you know...

5119
02:44:50,150 --> 02:44:50,670
Wow, this game went on longer now that there's like, you know...

5120
02:44:50,670 --> 02:44:53,210
No one of the pro team is alive.

5121
02:44:53,810 --> 02:44:54,890
Isn't that crazy?

5122
02:44:56,630 --> 02:44:57,690
That's pretty crazy.

5123
02:44:57,810 --> 02:44:58,310
Yeah.

5124
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:02,930
That the pro team isn't killing everybody.

5125
02:45:04,470 --> 02:45:05,490
That's how it works.

5126
02:45:06,690 --> 02:45:08,810
I got scan right below me.

5127
02:45:08,990 --> 02:45:09,190
I got scan right below me.

5128
02:45:10,070 --> 02:45:10,930
Let's see.

5129
02:45:11,330 --> 02:45:12,530
Where are the other doors?

5130
02:45:12,530 --> 02:45:15,330
I'm literally draining everyone's fucking meds.

5131
02:45:15,610 --> 02:45:16,490
I have one.

5132
02:45:16,630 --> 02:45:17,090
Nice.

5133
02:45:19,410 --> 02:45:20,530
I missed.

5134
02:45:20,890 --> 02:45:22,590
That is an embarrassment for my family.

5135
02:45:22,750 --> 02:45:23,930
I can't shoot anymore.

5136
02:45:24,110 --> 02:45:24,990
I don't have ammo.

5137
02:45:26,310 --> 02:45:26,750
That's fine.

5138
02:45:26,790 --> 02:45:27,370
You don't have to shoot.

5139
02:45:27,630 --> 02:45:28,610
Save it for the last string.

5140
02:45:31,270 --> 02:45:33,550
There's so many people dying that I want to shoot.

5141
02:45:33,550 --> 02:45:34,190
There's people up here.

5142
02:45:34,290 --> 02:45:34,910
Do you have a nade?

5143
02:45:35,110 --> 02:45:37,010
There's a guy behind this box alone, I think.

5144
02:45:37,190 --> 02:45:37,450
Yeah, I can.

5145
02:45:37,570 --> 02:45:38,510
I have a nade.

5146
02:45:38,570 --> 02:45:38,870
I have a nade.

5147
02:45:39,090 --> 02:45:39,610
Which one?

5148
02:45:39,730 --> 02:45:40,950
The nade right here.

5149
02:45:41,050 --> 02:45:41,850
You see this box right here?

5150
02:45:41,890 --> 02:45:42,390
This blue box?

5151
02:45:43,390 --> 02:45:43,670
Yeah.

5152
02:45:46,110 --> 02:45:46,790
Oh, I see him.

5153
02:45:47,770 --> 02:45:48,190
Cracked him.

5154
02:45:49,350 --> 02:45:49,630
Nice.

5155
02:45:49,630 --> 02:45:49,950
Dead.

5156
02:45:50,870 --> 02:45:52,410
He has teammates somewhere.

5157
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:55,750
Nice, we got it.

5158
02:45:55,830 --> 02:45:56,030
Nice.

5159
02:45:57,550 --> 02:45:58,950
Go to my right.

5160
02:45:59,230 --> 02:46:01,170
We literally have prio zone.

5161
02:46:01,550 --> 02:46:02,210
Oh my god.

5162
02:46:02,230 --> 02:46:03,870
I'm so scared of falling down.

5163
02:46:05,230 --> 02:46:06,470
So don't fall.

5164
02:46:08,490 --> 02:46:10,090
Wouldn't it be funny?

5165
02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:14,630
They're running out here?

5166
02:46:15,870 --> 02:46:16,510
Yeah.

5167
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:21,580
What's on this fuck?

5168
02:46:21,640 --> 02:46:21,740
Yeah?

5169
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:25,340
If you just stop teleporting for a second so I can hit you.

5170
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:25,600
Alright, no more shooting.

5171
02:46:26,220 --> 02:46:28,600
Okay, but what if like...

5172
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:29,740
Mobby rising here?

5173
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:30,840
No, not rising.

5174
02:46:30,900 --> 02:46:32,280
They're just calling in mobs.

5175
02:46:33,460 --> 02:46:34,300
88 on this guy.

5176
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:36,600
88 again.

5177
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:38,380
He's rising, he's rising.

5178
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:39,800
Oh my god, that was so close.

5179
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:41,720
How did he get it off?

5180
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:44,300
That was so close.

5181
02:46:45,180 --> 02:46:45,580
What the fuck?

5182
02:46:49,060 --> 02:46:49,760
That's crazy.

5183
02:46:50,780 --> 02:46:52,220
Oh god, I wanna shoot so bad.

5184
02:46:52,220 --> 02:46:53,040
They're running out here.

5185
02:46:53,320 --> 02:46:54,340
120 headshot.

5186
02:46:55,820 --> 02:46:57,540
Right below me, 120 headshot, Bangalore.

5187
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:58,100
Okay.

5188
02:46:58,380 --> 02:46:59,640
I have two nades.

5189
02:46:59,880 --> 02:47:00,720
I'm just gonna wait.

5190
02:47:00,980 --> 02:47:02,120
He's literally on the bank.

5191
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:07,360
Oh my god, how did he...

5192
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:09,820
How is Stewie not blind?

5193
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:12,720
Hello.

5194
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:16,620
I can't hit.

5195
02:47:19,360 --> 02:47:21,600
We're like last to jump down, I think.

5196
02:47:23,360 --> 02:47:24,020
I'm here.

5197
02:47:25,460 --> 02:47:25,980
Nice.

5198
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:27,520
Where?

5199
02:47:27,900 --> 02:47:28,740
95 headshot there.

5200
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:30,680
One team here.

5201
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:32,780
They have a zip on us.

5202
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:34,580
What the fuck are you doing?

5203
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:38,180
What the fuck are they doing?

5204
02:47:38,340 --> 02:47:38,980
Are you guys okay?

5205
02:47:39,260 --> 02:47:39,960
Like what?

5206
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:41,820
I'm...

5207
02:47:41,820 --> 02:47:42,940
Just a surprise.

5208
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:44,220
They just died, right?

5209
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:45,680
Yeah, he died for that.

5210
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:47,860
I was like, what?

5211
02:47:48,820 --> 02:47:49,940
I'm gonna Bangalore.

5212
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:52,760
I'm gonna place some spikes down there.

5213
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:56,960
That's yours, right?

5214
02:47:57,660 --> 02:47:58,200
Yeah, here, here.

5215
02:47:59,060 --> 02:48:00,740
I will scan.

5216
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:05,760
Okay, they're all right below us.

5217
02:48:05,960 --> 02:48:07,380
We can like...

5218
02:48:09,620 --> 02:48:11,980
That is definitely not yours this time.

5219
02:48:12,060 --> 02:48:12,980
Why are you shooting at me, bro?

5220
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:24,740
We're gonna jump down and wall, okay?

5221
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:26,040
I'm smoking everything.

5222
02:48:26,120 --> 02:48:26,600
He got Nox.

5223
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:27,720
Come with me, come with me.

5224
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:30,640
I need a wall.

5225
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:32,060
Wall is up.

5226
02:48:32,700 --> 02:48:33,340
On me, on me.

5227
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:36,100
I'm dead.

5228
02:48:36,180 --> 02:48:36,920
Come play my nook.

5229
02:48:39,160 --> 02:48:39,800
Playing my nook.

5230
02:48:39,860 --> 02:48:40,080
No.

5231
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:40,720
I have hit.

5232
02:48:41,420 --> 02:48:42,180
It's up to you, Ditto.

5233
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:42,880
Behind you!

5234
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:43,160
Behind you!

5235
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:44,780
It's fine.

5236
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:47,500
Nice try.

5237
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,060
I forgot to nade.

5238
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:50,880
I had two nades too.

5239
02:48:51,160 --> 02:48:52,300
I should've just threw my nades down there.

5240
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:54,520
Why did they just zip when I was... That was crazy.

5241
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:57,500
That zip was actually crazy.

5242
02:48:58,360 --> 02:48:59,360
What was that?

5243
02:48:59,420 --> 02:49:00,480
I was so confused.

5244
02:49:00,540 --> 02:49:01,340
I was like, what?

5245
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:06,440
Did that actually happen?

5246
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:12,940
I was like, no, they're not gonna take it all the way.

5247
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:17,440
I stared at him for two seconds, because I thought he was gonna get off the zip.

5248
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:19,720
But then he kept going, so I shot him.

5249
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:21,040
I was like, wait, what?

5250
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:25,180
I mean, nine kills last game.

5251
02:49:25,240 --> 02:49:26,180
You showed some dominance.

5252
02:49:26,320 --> 02:49:26,960
I'm just saying.

5253
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:29,700
Bro, the boys got fixed 16.

5254
02:49:29,940 --> 02:49:30,340
What are you...

5255
02:49:31,460 --> 02:49:33,820
There's a team below us that got 16.

5256
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:35,280
Okay.

5257
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:37,220
That's Lingzer, isn't it?

5258
02:49:37,240 --> 02:49:37,880
Yeah, it's Lingzer.

5259
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:39,280
Those players don't count.

5260
02:49:40,760 --> 02:49:46,120
All the LG players should lose all their points and should all go to us instead.

5261
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:48,000
It's so true.

5262
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:51,060
GG's, guys.

5263
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:52,800
I don't even know what placement.

5264
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:53,900
What placement did we get?

5265
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:55,800
What placement did we get?

5266
02:49:56,280 --> 02:49:57,200
Let me check.

5267
02:49:58,400 --> 02:49:59,460
Is it updated?

5268
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:00,700
It's not.

5269
02:50:01,960 --> 02:50:02,880
It's not updated.

5270
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:03,700
Not yet?

5271
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:05,520
No, it did.

5272
02:50:05,740 --> 02:50:06,320
Game six.

5273
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:07,340
Yeah.

5274
02:50:07,480 --> 02:50:07,740
Yeah.

5275
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:08,820
Hey, we got third.

5276
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:09,800
Hey!

5277
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:12,220
How the fuck did we get...

5278
02:50:12,220 --> 02:50:13,620
Oh no, that means you have to do an interview.

5279
02:50:14,360 --> 02:50:16,280
How did we get third from that?

5280
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:17,680
I'll take it.

5281
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:19,380
We got third from a second place.

5282
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:24,840
That's actually crazy that we got third.

5283
02:50:26,920 --> 02:50:27,400
Nah.

5284
02:50:27,940 --> 02:50:29,720
Do we have to do an interview?

5285
02:50:30,060 --> 02:50:31,020
Do we have to?

5286
02:50:31,180 --> 02:50:32,460
I thought the interview was only for...

5287
02:50:32,460 --> 02:50:33,620
I nominated you for an interview.

5288
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:35,660
No, I nominate RPR.

5289
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:38,100
No, no, no, no.

5290
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:39,420
I have to go in four minutes!

5291
02:50:40,380 --> 02:50:41,240
Yeah, yeah.

5292
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:43,040
Well, you know, you invited me to this tournament.

5293
02:50:43,160 --> 02:50:43,680
You're the team leader.

5294
02:50:43,820 --> 02:50:44,640
You should just totally like...

5295
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:45,580
You said yes.

5296
02:50:45,580 --> 02:50:46,160
You agreed.

5297
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:49,760
No, no, no, no.

5298
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:50,840
Wait, Ditto, Ditto, Ditto.

5299
02:50:50,960 --> 02:50:51,800
You should do the interview.

5300
02:50:53,260 --> 02:50:53,660
Why?

5301
02:50:53,940 --> 02:50:55,420
Do we need to...

5302
02:50:55,420 --> 02:50:56,180
Yeah.

5303
02:50:56,420 --> 02:50:57,740
...do an interview?

5304
02:50:57,980 --> 02:50:58,340
Yes.

5305
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:00,680
No.

5306
02:51:01,740 --> 02:51:02,860
What do you mean no?

5307
02:51:04,220 --> 02:51:05,560
I'm not good at interviews.

5308
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:08,840
If I do an interview, I'm gonna go say some super shit.

5309
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:11,600
Let RPR do it.

5310
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:12,480
Let RPR do it.

5311
02:51:13,540 --> 02:51:15,860
Dude, there's no way they're gonna interview the third place team.

5312
02:51:16,060 --> 02:51:17,020
There's no need to.

5313
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:18,420
Yes.

5314
02:51:18,420 --> 02:51:22,340
I think he... they will interview only first place.

5315
02:51:22,740 --> 02:51:23,540
Yeah, that's true.

5316
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:25,520
Right.

5317
02:51:25,640 --> 02:51:26,380
They're not gonna...

5318
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:27,480
Yeah, why would anyone talk to us?

5319
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:30,100
Yeah, they already talked to like people already.

5320
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:32,720
Yeah, like whatever.

5321
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:35,540
Talk to the LGS players abusing RPR.

5322
02:51:37,420 --> 02:51:39,440
Yeah, exactly.

5323
02:51:39,860 --> 02:51:41,160
Talk to the numbnuts guys.

5324
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:43,480
Yeah, talk to them.

5325
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:43,900
Talk to them.

5326
02:51:43,900 --> 02:51:44,600
Do to them.

5327
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:45,420
They deserve it.

5328
02:51:46,520 --> 02:51:47,680
Fucking shame them.

5329
02:51:47,900 --> 02:51:48,880
Yeah, whoa!

5330
02:51:50,060 --> 02:51:50,700
Shame them.

5331
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:51,480
Whoa!

5332
02:51:51,540 --> 02:51:52,020
Shame.

5333
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:53,440
I didn't say that.

5334
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:53,960
Shame.

5335
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:54,560
They deserve it.

5336
02:51:59,180 --> 02:51:59,660
Alright.

5337
02:52:00,140 --> 02:52:01,180
Are we actually...

5338
02:52:01,180 --> 02:52:01,440
Shame.

5339
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:02,520
Do we actually have to do the interview?

5340
02:52:03,560 --> 02:52:04,220
I don't know.

5341
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:05,020
I actually have no clue.

5342
02:52:05,280 --> 02:52:05,580
I have no clue.

5343
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:07,640
I didn't even read the rules of the tournament.

5344
02:52:07,820 --> 02:52:09,440
Okay, to be fair, I have read the rules.

5345
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:10,080
I don't even know.

5346
02:52:10,320 --> 02:52:11,540
Alright, let's see.

5347
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:12,940
Where's the rules?

5348
02:52:13,480 --> 02:52:13,920
Questions.

5349
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:16,640
Where's the rules?

5350
02:52:17,640 --> 02:52:18,440
Okay, rules.

5351
02:52:18,540 --> 02:52:19,200
I'm QLG champion.

5352
02:52:19,460 --> 02:52:19,820
No, I'm not.

5353
02:52:20,820 --> 02:52:21,600
Tournament expert.

5354
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:22,080
I'm not.

5355
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:22,260
I'm not.

5356
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:22,640
I'm not.

5357
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:23,080
No champion.

5358
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:24,080
I'm third place.

5359
02:52:24,820 --> 02:52:25,260
Yeah.

5360
02:52:25,300 --> 02:52:26,060
I'm just third place.

5361
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:26,500
We're third place.

5362
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:29,200
I'm not a champion.

5363
02:52:29,500 --> 02:52:30,040
Oh my god.

5364
02:52:30,040 --> 02:52:32,640
Boyspace have a lot of points.

5365
02:52:33,300 --> 02:52:34,260
Like twice.

5366
02:52:36,220 --> 02:52:37,500
Oh, there's no interviews.

5367
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:38,420
There's no interviews.

5368
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:39,460
Let's go.

5369
02:52:39,780 --> 02:52:40,720
Alright, GG's everybody.

5370
02:52:40,760 --> 02:52:41,160
Let's go.

5371
02:52:41,900 --> 02:52:42,420
GG's.

5372
02:52:42,420 --> 02:52:42,820
We did it.

5373
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:43,300
Third place.

5374
02:52:43,440 --> 02:52:44,260
Wow, GG's are so fun.

5375
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:44,600
Wow.

5376
02:52:44,600 --> 02:52:45,840
We're so good at this game.

5377
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:46,800
GG's guys.

5378
02:52:46,920 --> 02:52:47,920
We got third place.

5379
02:52:48,300 --> 02:52:48,460
Hey, hey.

5380
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:50,440
Wasn't even trying.

5381
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:51,920
Wasn't even trying.

5382
02:52:51,960 --> 02:52:53,100
Got third place.

5383
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:53,560
Wow.

5384
02:52:53,560 --> 02:52:54,680
Yeah, wasn't even trying.

5385
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:56,500
Team Slightly Manjera.

5386
02:52:56,620 --> 02:52:57,840
We're going crazy.

5387
02:52:58,280 --> 02:53:03,120
Team... team... team's not slightly anymore here, Manjera.

5388
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:04,860
Anyway, TSM is going to disband.

5389
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:06,660
Ditto and I...

5390
02:53:07,120 --> 02:53:07,220
Yeah.

5391
02:53:07,460 --> 02:53:11,640
Dets and I are going to look for a new IGL, we figured.

5392
02:53:11,700 --> 02:53:20,880
Yeah, if you guys want to... if you guys want to make some like fan art of like us like disbanding, like I'm going to go to Dark Zero from now on.

5393
02:53:20,940 --> 02:53:22,220
So this is going to be our last tournament.

5394
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:27,160
Yeah, like this is Tiro RPR's last tournament as TSM.

5395
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:30,860
We are disbanding now because Ditto and I got better.

5396
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:32,040
So we're not Manjera anymore.

5397
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:33,920
So he has to go to Dark Zero.

5398
02:53:35,180 --> 02:53:40,680
Yeah, so like if you guys want to memorize this moment for the end of eternity, you guys can make some fan art if you want.

5399
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:45,440
But just know that I'm leaving because I just need a better environment.

5400
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:46,180
Because...

5401
02:53:46,180 --> 02:53:48,320
This environment is too toxic for me.

5402
02:53:48,580 --> 02:53:50,680
And I just don't think we can win like this.

5403
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:53,400
So I just got to do what's better for my career.

5404
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:58,360
And I think moving to Dark Zero is actually going to give me a chance to win from now onwards.

5405
02:54:00,740 --> 02:54:04,840
And like we think as TSM, the last two members in TSM...

5406
02:54:04,840 --> 02:54:13,160
we believe that like Imperial RPR was too much of an anchor.

5407
02:54:13,540 --> 02:54:16,960
So we will be trailing new IGL starting next week.

5408
02:54:18,020 --> 02:54:25,640
Yeah, and also as an IGL, I just can't believe that I'm IGLing and I'm also outputting more damage than Verhulst and Repz together.

5409
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:30,680
Like they output 7000 damage together and I output 8000 damage from my IGLing.

5410
02:54:30,680 --> 02:54:31,800
Like this is insane.

5411
02:54:32,120 --> 02:54:33,900
Like this is why I need better teams.

5412
02:54:33,900 --> 02:54:34,820
That's why I need gen-raw.

5413
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:37,760
I'm also tired of IGLing.

5414
02:54:37,860 --> 02:54:40,920
I just want to frag out because I really have the talent for it.

5415
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,100
And I just want to go to like an IGL and just tell me what to do.

5416
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:47,980
And I got teammates that do a ton of damage because my team just doesn't do shit.

5417
02:54:48,460 --> 02:54:54,360
You do a lot of damage because you are IGL because you know when to shoot.

5418
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:55,940
Exactly, we don't know.

5419
02:54:56,080 --> 02:55:03,260
And if we didn't listen to your order and if we shoot, you are gonna mad at us.

5420
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:03,700
Yeah.

5421
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:07,300
You guys are not shooting enough anyway.

5422
02:55:07,900 --> 02:55:09,960
How do you guys never have ammo?

5423
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:12,820
How do you never have ammo but do no damage?

5424
02:55:13,320 --> 02:55:14,260
You don't tell us.

5425
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:16,540
Because you are taking the ammo.

5426
02:55:17,100 --> 02:55:18,480
Yeah, you are taking the ammo.

5427
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:22,400
You guys never have ammo and never have damage.

5428
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:23,840
You are always yelling for light ammo.

5429
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:26,420
So I don't have light ammo anymore.

5430
02:55:27,700 --> 02:55:32,540
Now listen, you guys can see what the problem of TSM is right here right now.

5431
02:55:32,540 --> 02:55:33,240
It's a toxic ammo.

5432
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:33,580
It's a toxic environment.

5433
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:37,880
And I think Dizzy is just a better environment for me where I can really shine as a player.

5434
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:43,140
GG's guys, we got third place.

5435
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:44,080
GG.

5436
02:55:45,680 --> 02:55:46,200
GG's guys.

5437
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:50,480
I gotta go plan for WrestleTuber now.

5438
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:51,620
I'll see you guys later.

5439
02:55:52,460 --> 02:55:52,940
GG's.

5440
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:54,060
Yeah, peace out.

5441
02:55:54,120 --> 02:55:54,900
Bye bye.

5442
02:55:55,020 --> 02:55:55,460
Bye bye.

5443
02:55:56,920 --> 02:55:59,800
Alright guys, I gotta go fucking zoom for WrestleTuber now.

5444
02:56:00,900 --> 02:56:01,380
So...

5445
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:02,740
Oh my gosh.

5446
02:56:02,740 --> 02:56:04,760
I can't even use my head right now.

5447
02:56:05,240 --> 02:56:06,240
What was my outro?

5448
02:56:09,580 --> 02:56:11,200
Guys, what was my outro?

5449
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:12,700
I actually forgot my outro.

5450
02:56:13,680 --> 02:56:14,120
Uh...

5451
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:15,020
Uh...

5452
02:56:15,020 --> 02:56:16,980
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5453
02:56:17,060 --> 02:56:20,420
And if you stayed up for me, there's WrestleTuber later on.

5454
02:56:20,440 --> 02:56:21,720
I'll see you guys soon everybody.

5455
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:23,360
Bye guys.

5456
02:56:23,680 --> 02:56:24,020
Bye.
