one hound is so rich he actually has meds that's not fair we

425
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:28,850

had to control with so much little resources that's messed

426
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:37,830
up i bet you that first game would have been our winning

430
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:07,590

yeah there's no other choice and this is also this lifeline

431
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:15,130
team is the team that we knocked when they landed below like
this was literally the team but they got second place we

432
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:22,370
knocked bloodhound and then they used lifeline rest so we
didn't get the kill for it and i wanted to finish i couldn't

433
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:31,130
because guaranteeing grief it's okay we killed the other
team that tried to get in sorry we did the best we could

00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,170
I think it's World's Edge.

442
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,930
It's three World's Edge and then three Storm points.

443

Are we still doing the same comp?

453

With the refrigerator, it's like right outside my room.

454
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,120
Oh, you're getting ice coffee?

455

Is that what you're getting?

456
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,940
Yeah, I'm getting ice coffee, canned coffee.

457
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,700
You know, fake coffee where it's just sugar.

458
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,320
Is that like, I used to drink just like canned coffees from
Starbucks.

459
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,220
Like actual Starbucks canned coffee is like iced coffee.

460
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,340
No, it's like Japanese canned coffee.

461
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,480
So it's mostly just sugar with some caffeine in it.

462
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,420
But Japanese canned coffee, you have two options.

463
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:02,100
you have the the sugary one or the black coffee oh no the
sugary one i'm having the sugary black one i cannot i don't

mean i am sarcastic that's double sarcasm right now you're

473
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,800
stacking it like a If I get double sarcasm, it counts.

474
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,940
That's like two negatives.

475
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,480
It cancels each other out.

476
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,420
Do you not know simple math?

477
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,780
That's not how it works in sarcasm mathematics.

478
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,460
It's literally cancelled each other.

479
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,640
What do you mean?

480
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,860
What are you some fucking PhD professor?

481
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,540
Yeah, I literally invented sarcasm mathematics.

482
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,700
I literally have PhD.

483
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,120
From where?

484
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:18,800
And PTSD.

485
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,540
Oh, hey, there's a triple take.

486
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:34,420
there's so much so many triple takes i'll take a triple i
shoot too much ammo like i need to become shiv i gotta carry

487
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:44,420
like stacks on stacks apparently i shoot way too much well
to be fair we had like literally no resources oh i forgot

488
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:54,080
the game audio sorry guys can you scan the people beacon
right now Yeah, yeah.

489
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,260
Not even there, though.

490
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,120
Alright, I'm heading over.

491
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,880
Can you do it?

492
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,680
When you get there, can you scan the people begin?

493
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,200
Alright.

494
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,260
These things right next to me, so I'm gonna get this.

495
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,440
I kind of want to open the red bin behind us, but I don't
want to go back, so we're not doing that.

496
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,180
You're so lazy.

497
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,100
What happened?

498
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,800
No, because we have to rotate.

499
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,000
What happened to you?

500
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,520
When did you get so lazy?

501
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,740
It's not about laziness, it's about efficiency.

502
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:30,000
why are you so lazy our efficiency is not allowing us to go
back we got to go forward look at his own yeah but i have to

503
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:42,140
scan anyway yeah hit the scan and start walking towards me
i'm like no heavy again this game doesn't spawn heavy ammo

504
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:57,560
all right scanning in three two one do you need heavy mag no
heavy ammo i'm okay i'm ready oh there's people here okay we

505
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:04,660

506
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:13,060

508
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,540
heading over Yeah, we gotta kind of move fast.

509
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,140
We gotta fast rotate.

510
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,620
There's 20 teams now.

511
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,480
Ditto!

512
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,220
Ditto, you're so behind!

513
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,200
I'm dropping 80 energy here.

514
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,140
Okay.

515
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,380
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

516
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,160
Another 80 energy here.

517
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,160
Maybe even more, actually.

518
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,440
Oh, nice.

519
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,240
I'm heading over.

520
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,960
We're so fast.

521
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,340
There's no bat.

522
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,860
Oh, fuck.

523
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,620
I got bats.

524
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,040
Purple bag.

525
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,780
This shit.

526
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,740
There's a havoc here.

527
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,520
Purple bag.

528
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,380
Oh, I need Davok.

529
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,780
I need Volt.

530
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,020
I'll take that.

531
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,860
I'll give you Volt.

532
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,280
Okay, I reach.

533
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,860
Okay, okay.

534
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,280
Here, I take this Savok.

535
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:03,880
You take the Volt.

536
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,040
I have two short range, by the way, because I couldn't find
a long range gun.

537
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,820
JK, I found a long range gun.

538
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,180
But I might...

539
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,680
I need scope for it, though.

540
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,520
Okay, we'll maybe find some in fragment.

541
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,540
We want to hit the juicer here and then we want to hit
another people scan.

542
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:33,360
okay and then after that we want to probably go for zone
yeah and this zone is this i think it's this annoying one

543
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:42,940
north side which one this one on my ping this one okay i go
north of epi uh there's there's a bat here can you carry

544
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:49,280
yeah yeah i'm gonna carry the heavy if you found a skull

545
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:59,700
energy i have both of you need scope okay people are here on
top of i have two x so i'm okay now okay there's people

546
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,240
right here i just saw rotate they're gonna rotate up the
hill here okay i would read a play yeah we have two read a

547
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:14,760
place there's guys on top of the building are just gonna
keep the skin leave someone's beaming me my back keep we

548
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:22,680
gotta keep moving forward oh i see them they're really right
behind us yeah yeah get to the diner come keep walking with

549
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:31,540
me they were here 30 seconds ago okay yeah that's the team
in front of us brother come with me we're gonna go i have

550
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:37,580
scat and nine hopefully this team hopefully this team is not
holding this hybrid i need you to scan here all right five

551
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:51,430
four three two one we nobody okay we're good they have
caustic barrel be careful okay okay they scanned the survey

552
00:38:51,430 --> 00:39:00,690
beacon we can play from here okay we're not last let's go
people died before us I love it when people are more

553
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:14,060
incompetent okay are they fighting on the right side yeah
because if they are we can maybe do something about it okay

554
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:22,980
I want to keep moving forward I want to get as far north as
we can because I'm fuck you oh that's embarrassing no I'm

555
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:30,940
not bloodhound I can't see that I didn't see that either
okay i heard a sentinel from this side let's keep moving

556
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:38,020
okay all right we're right behind you here i've scanned 18
because i used it earlier they're at the sentinel is at the

557
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:45,460
house so we should be able to get here for free honestly we
could even play for third beacon and then would probably

558
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:55,900
give us purple armor we want me in this building scan this
i'm scanning people in there here.

559
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,420
There is no other choice for us to play from down here.

560
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,880
I don't think we can get any more deeper.

561
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,500
What if they, like, shoot us from the top?

562
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,160
They're not because I'm gonna hold it.

563
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:06,940
Oh, okay.

564
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,020
Okay.

565
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,620
They also, they have to, they have to hold their house.

566
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,680
Motherfucker, get off the fucking triple take.

567
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,860
Where are they?

568
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,280
Yeah?

569
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,400
On the roof.

570
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,080
Yeah, on the roof.

571
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
I don't see them on the roof.

572
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,980
If that team is too, oh, wait, I see a team going left side
inside the climber.

573
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,380
Look at them.

574
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:22,640
Look at them.

575
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,820
What's them?

576
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,740
It's two teams, I think.

577
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,500
Yeah, yeah, it is.

578
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,640
Oh, wait, I missed every shot.

579
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,480
I haven't done it yet.

580
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,140
Guys, I have not played the 30-30 in too long.

581
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,680
Get fucked.

582
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,360
Oh, no.

583
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,320
I haven't shot a 30-30 in a long time.

584
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:43,980
Be careful with the soft team.

585
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,900
Is there any team on toss?

586
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,440
Yeah, no, there's team in this house right here.

587
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,660
Doki, I want you to keep scanning in this direction behind
us in case anyone's trying to walk out.

588
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:05,600
to us we just need to know if there's people trying to
contest us okay i can give a two-time scope i have a two x i

589
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:17,820
have a two x i just i'm just not hitting shots you want two
to four uh oh maybe yeah two to four is better for me here i

590
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:28,900
just wanted oh here someone's uh evaking and this i'm gonna
watch it fucking emote where the fuck oh they're coming

591
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:36,900
straight for us i think they're flying over us red armors
already what the fuck they're gonna fight 100 no they're not

592
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:45,520
i mean they're definitely lining up people red they might be
they might just guy from walking around and scanning yeah no

593
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:56,880
these guys are just ripping scans of cooldown honestly we're
like one scan of uh purple as well so We just didn't get a

594
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,760
chance to scan anything.

595
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,220
But where's Endzone?

596
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:01,920
I guess we could have an overlook.

597
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,560
Whoa.

598
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,240
Endzone is somewhere around us.

599
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,280
I'm not sure exactly.

600
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,560
It's either pulling to climatize or coming back to us.

601
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,560
Yeah, did they play from below?

602
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,220
Wait, they're fighting in the bottom here.

603
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,420
Like full fighting?

604
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,240
I don't know.

605
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,380
I saw like poking down there, but...

606
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,700
And they were running at the building.

607
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I keep looking at that.

608
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,000
Oh god, there's too many places to look at.

609
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,740
Focus, focus on looking below and scanning behind us.

610
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,400
That's all you got to do.

611
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,300
There's a team on top of Overlook Tower.

612
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,020
They're fighting over there.

613
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,080
They threw a fuse name.

614
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,520
Why did they get shot?

615
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,260
Can this triple take fuck off?

616
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,600
Oh, that's your chase.

617
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,540
I'm not here.

618
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,220
I just got hit around the corner.

619
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,020
Yeah.

620
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,080
I smoked him.

621
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,540
He just picks the door always.

622
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,240
Really annoying.

623
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,480
Leave us alone!

624
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,640
Don't fucking destroy your fence.

625
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:15,020
You kind of have to save meds so the same shit doesn't
happen from last game.

626
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,700
Yeah, they're getting shot too.

627
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,460
Maybe you can pick up a killer.

628
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,600
I think they're fighting here.

629
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,200
Okay.

630
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,020
Yeah, I think they're full fighting.

631
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,020
Yeah, yeah, they're full fighting here.

632
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,480
Come here, Doki.

633
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:24,940
Look at this.

634
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,280
Okay.

635
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,620
I will hit a shot.

636
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,820
I swear to God.

637
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:34,840
Do you want to swap?

638
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,720
Do you want me to give me a repeater and I'll give you a
hemlock?

639
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,140
No, I will hit a shot.

640
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,120
I swear.

641
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,340
In this corner, look, look, look.

642
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,460
Guys.

643
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,900
Look at this, look at this.

644
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,780
These guys are...

645
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,340

Maybe I'm just bad.

650
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,700
There's so many teams here.

651
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,460

00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:09,140

657
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,720
Okay, okay, okay.

658
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,300
It has to be far because I didn't get... Oh my god, I hit a
shot.

659
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,500
I hit two shots, guys.

660
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,820
But these guys are...

661
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,840
These guys have to die.

662
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,380
No.

663
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:39,760
He's in zone.

664
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,260
He's losing zone.

665
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,360
What the fuck is he living?

666
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,720
I cracked him.

667
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,580
He has to blow.

668
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:47,920
Yeah, he's...

669
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,240
Oh, he's dead.

670
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,820
Nice.

671
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,480
Nice.

672
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,660
They're rising.

673
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,220
They're trying to res.

674
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:52,700
One more.

675
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,160
One more.

676
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,360
Nice one.

677
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,220
Nice one.

678
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Nice one.

679
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,620
They should be able to res, though.

680
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,320
I don't think so.

681
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,360
They're getting shot from every side.

682
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,080
I don't think they can.

683
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,700
I didn't get my kill.

684
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,140
They crawled inside, I think.

685
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,640
No, no, no, no.

686
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:07,860
They're resing.

687
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:08,340
They are resing.

688
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:08,980
They are resing.

689
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,520
I see them resing.

690
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,620
You stop shooting him.

691
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,360
I'm fucking ulting them.

692
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:13,660

Fuck.

694
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,180

695
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:15,840
They got the res.

696
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,980
Yeah, yeah, I saw the res going off.

If the team above us peaks, we die.

721
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,760
It's rat time.

722
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,000
We have to rat here until someone drops on us and then we
kill them.

723
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,540
Okay.

724
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,060
I think there is a team here in this corner.

725
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,860
Yeah, there is.

726
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,260
Look at them.

735
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,100

00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,180
We grip him.

739
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,000
Okay.

740
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,740
That's it.

741
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,060
I grifted them and I have a crack too.

742
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,080
Okay.

743
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,620
They're full body.

744
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,200
Oh, we got scanned.

745
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,020
We got scanned by on top.

746
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:02,780
I didn't get scanned.

747
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,220
Only you.

748
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,120
So they'll think she's a solo.

749
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,660
Because they fucking hate you.

750
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,160
I don't know.

751
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,480
I was with you.

752
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,120

753
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,420

I mean, you just say you're getting scanned and then it
didn't pick up.

00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,020
I was a little bit in front of you.

758
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:22,480
That's why.

759
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,220
Okay, they finished this fight.

00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,520
Those guys rotated.

772
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,120

That's all I care about.

00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:43,350
And we got top five.

803
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,990
Oh, we got zero- we had zero kills for top five?

804
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:49,790
We didn't kill anybody?

805
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,350
I'm surprised that we didn't kill anybody.

806
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:52,890
Yeah.

807
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,390
I guess we just- we knocked like a lot of people.

808
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,630
Yeah, so we didn't- we didn't get any kill.

809
00:51:58,890 --> 00:51:59,230
Yeah.

810
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,290
Oh no, our PR is pulling a zero.

811
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,310
He's gonna alt have four.

812
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,950
What the fuck was that Bangalore banner?

813
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:09,390
That's Lynxer.

814
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,150
And he's been doing Pro League.

815
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,540
Not a full VTuber tournament, guys.

816
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,960
Because I think there's not enough VTuber Apex players in
NA.

817
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,100
Back.

818
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,200
Welcome back.

819
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,160
Did I get any kills for that?

820
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,340
No, we didn't got zero.

821
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,640
I would win that last fight if I'm not lagging.

822
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:44,220
Oh yeah, yeah, I could tell the first mag was not very
inspirational.

823
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,660
I should have used my oil.

824
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,200
On my screen that first mag was all over him.

825
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,340
Literally aimed straight at him.

826
00:52:54,260 --> 00:53:01,060
Yeah, yeah, on my POV it was not inspirational in my POV.

827
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,140
It was literally a fullness.

828
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:06,120
He was teleporting so where I was shooting he wasn't there.

829
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:18,560
uh this shit again i'm tilted what did you fix it or i don't
know what did you do i literally don't know you do anything

830
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:28,900
to fix it or no i turn off everything in my house like from
the wi-fi oh i'm gonna switch my vpn as well maybe that

831
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:40,380
helps tell tell tell the organizer to do one game in europe
i mean half the team is eu anyways so I have to turn it more

832
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:46,720
than I should know one third of people in this tournament
are EU anyway so might as well I mean I'm fine with it as

833
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:54,580
long as I'm not lagging like when people start teleporting I
can't play the game like I mean I can't hit people like how

834
00:53:54,580 --> 00:54:00,300
am I supposed to hit people when I can't see where they are
they're not like where I'm shooting they're not there change

835
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:06,420
the server change the server I don't know if switching to EU
would help

836
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:22,050
man that's unlucky because it always happens like in the
second or third game for you because it'll be okay and then

837
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:29,370
suddenly bam it was fine in the morning i played an entire
tournament today in the morning was completely fine oh my

838
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,470
gosh sabotage maybe he is dedossing you

839
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:50,760

842
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:11,780
what does he mean by game will restart i don't know i hope
he's not restarting a whole game he's gonna keep us here at

843
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:21,700
4 a.m or what no they cannot i told him i was like i'm
leaving three like you literally can i literally cannot i

844
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:33,360
was like if i'm doing this tournament i have to leave at
exactly three oh so ipn is grieving that's what's going on

845
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:42,620
wait how so because apparently you aren't you're you need to
announce a contest and they contested without announcing it

846
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:48,320
oh oh wait who did he grief I don't know.

847
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,620
Whoever lands Overlook, I think.

848
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,140
Oh, so they're not going to count that game?

849
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,280
No, they're counting it.

850
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,700
But he said moving onwards.

851
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,140
If that happens again, he's not going to count it.

852
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,060
Oh, that sucks for that team in Overlook.

853
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,460
That sucks for them.

854
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,400
They got fucking griefed.

855
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,580
They should, like, deduct points for that team.

856
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:12,920
They should...

857
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,460
IPM, yeah.

858
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,880
IPM should get minus 40.

859
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,420
Yeah, yeah.

860
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,320
They should deduct points.

861
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:27,660
no i've actually got minus 40 points so you can't win at all
like no matter how many points you cannot get past top 10

862
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:38,220
because you grieved you ruined the game for everybody else
who's ipm playing with uh fruit and zero a fruit and zero oh

863
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:45,180
my god fruit zero and ip are grieving that's insane they're
griefers i know that's what i'm saying they should minus the

864
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:59,360
duck points wow there should be no mercy pros and griefing i
know no no two pros and griefing is crazy i know you gotta

865
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:11,300
do the honorable thing and have one pro and grief hey but
we're not grieving griefing our own team maybe okay well

866
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:11,980
that's for you

867
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,220
Ditto carrying us.

868
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,720
Let's fucking get beacons.

869
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,280
Okay.

870
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:19,820
Ditto.

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,700
Ditto, what happened?

875
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,500
You used to kill everybody.

What happened?

877
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,740
Don't gaslight her.

878
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,880
She's doing her best.

879
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,540
I follow RPRs already.

880
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,600
You're supposed to give her confidence.

881
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,320
I'm so RPRs making you a worse player.

882
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,980
How am I?

883
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,340
I literally have the most kills in here.

884
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:50,260
here and i'm not yelling i don't know she said um she said
she's literally following you and she's not getting kills

885
00:57:50,260 --> 00:58:02,160
that's what she said see she agreed i'm gonna lose my mind
i'm useless again how many ping do you have in a you you

886
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:08,760
should have blaze being more than me well the problem is not
the ping i have 150 ping and it jumps on 200 then i have 150

887
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:16,380
and jumps on 200 and it makes everyone teleport it's your
internet like it can't be my internet i literally called my

888
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:22,980
company twice to full restart everything and they did maybe
how do you know it seems not lagging how do you know they

889
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:32,000

an hour maybe they just turned it off but they didn't i

a hemlock this time I have no idea

893
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:09,190
again maybe it's just apex but it happened to me in Valorant
the other day as well but I don't think it's fixed I was I

894
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:16,650
was playing yeah but I was before I fixed it on Valorant I
was playing on like an NA server with like 200 so it's kind

895
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:29,290

teleporting for you or is it fixed now no it's not fixed

I'm going to get some evo charge here.

902
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,710
Yeah, like on this building or this height.

903
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,650
But I think building is probably easier.

904
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:31,390
Okay, I'm going to craft it.

905
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:34,610
Okay.

01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:36,930

Nice.

914
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,430
I have three bats and eight cells.

915
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:53,330
Three eight.

916
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,910
I have two twelve.

917
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,830
I didn't really find a lot of bats at all.

918
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:01,990
And I can't find a havoc.

919
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:03,590
I can...

920
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:03,950
Oh, wait.

921
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:04,310
Wait.

922
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,230
Who's getting the...

923
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,350
Are you getting the Harvester or are we getting it?

924
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,230
Yeah, I mean, if you can, get it.

925
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:14,070
But don't die for it.

926
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,130
I already got one of them.

927
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:16,390
I'll get the other then.

928
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,990
Wait.

929
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:18,970

932
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:46,100
right i got it okay nice i mean we our only option is really
just playing zone we don't really have much one option here

933
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:55,120
we're just gonna live here it's okay we're not gonna be last
I'm pretty sure it ends on this bridge, like right there.

934
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,660
Should we go to that bridge or stay here?

935
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:58,620
No, no, no.

936
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,720
I want to play from, like, this corner here.

937
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,340
Those walls are really good.

938
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,200
I will check.

939
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,560
Yeah, that's why I want to play from this building and the
walls.

940
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,360
I hate holding these walls because, like, you just get
knitted.

941
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,080
I like pushing it more than holding it.

942
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,100
I don't see anybody yet.

943
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,160
I'm gonna put four soldiers.

944
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,000
Oh.

945
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,320
Over there.

946
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,120
I see them.

947
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,600
Yeah, they see us too.

948
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:29,900
What the fuck?

949
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,320
Oh, he came from...

950
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,660
These guys came from Geyser.

951
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:34,960
Geyser?

952
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,900
Or was it?

953
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,060
They came from...

954
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,280
Not Geyser, big mod.

955
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,500
These guys came from big mod because he has the paintball
gun.

956
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:41,660
Okay.

957
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,000
Did you hit the...

958
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:47,840
Oh no.

959
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,380
We didn't have people's skin, did we?

960
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,200
No, we didn't.

961
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:51,840
yeah

962
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:04,860
I'm checking if anybody read a place to us Dita you play
there and play safe throw your cues everywhere we're gonna

963
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:10,340
play roof and just look around and try to get information
when it gets like when a lot of people start getting here

964
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:17,500
we're just gonna play here Dita's gonna play there and then
if it gets like dicey we just run to her and play from like

965
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:23,820
Dita's side like we want to we don't play those walls over
there okay and we if we can keep this high ground we we

966
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:28,740
won't do but if we can't we'll just give it up and play
walls instead because these walls are pretty much gonna win

967
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,940
as the game okay

968
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:48,710
nobody's rotated to us yet yeah over here okay they're very
far oh very slow they're just playing edge i guess yeah i'm

969
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:55,390
like because like usually zone teams would be here already
so i'm like I don't see anybody yet.

970
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,290
I don't even see any redeployers.

971
01:03:59,370 --> 01:03:59,410
Oh!

972
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,810
The team jump over here.

973
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,170
How close?

974
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,090
Where the fuck?

975
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:05,110
Where I'm pinged.

976
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:06,510
Oh, okay.

977
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,170
Purple armor.

978
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,970
These guys are playing super slow.

979
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:10,210
What the fuck?

980
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:15,030
They're just taking like a million bacon skins and shit.

981
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,340
Look to my left.

982
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,180
Why is this one so low?

983
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,240
That guy's flashed by the way, this guy.

984
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:28,280
Yeah.

985
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:29,940
This is blowdown.

986
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:30,840
Look at this blowdown now.

987
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:31,280
Is it him?

988
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,940
He's going to move.

989
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,160
Yeah, he's going to move.

990
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,620
Stop shooting.

991
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,020
I'm looking to your left.

992
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:42,680
Oh, there's a team coming rotating in behind us.

993
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:43,960
Blue armor.

994
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:45,260
Okay.

995
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,100
I'm just going to make sure these guys...

996
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:48,900
Whoa.

997
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,240
Okay, they have triple takes to get off the roof.

998
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:51,800
Yeah.

999
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:58,650
This is not going to be a fun game for me.

1000
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,490
Yep, they are coming to us.

1001
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:01,610
I'm gonna scan.

1002
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:02,890
They're just chilling.

1003
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:03,710
Oh, okay.

1004
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:04,970
It's pretty far over there.

1005
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,550
Yeah, yeah, we're still pretty far.

1006
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:07,270
We're still pretty good.

1007
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:07,930
What the?

1008
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,890
Oh, bridge, bridge people.

1009
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:11,950
Okay, bridge is fine.

1010
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:12,670
They can hold that.

1011
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:18,310
That bridge team is like, I'm like 99% sure they're gonna
die because everyone's gonna focus there.

1012
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:18,590
Okay.

1013
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,130
I'm still checking there's extra resources.

1014
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:23,570
Okay, one team out, the tree.

1015
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:29,070
Bridge team is no longer at bridge from what I can see.

1016
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:29,630
Okay.

1017
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:33,170
Yeah, they went below.

1018
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:37,870
There's someone getting charged-rippled like crazy at three.

1019
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:40,730
Over there, over there, over there.

1020
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:41,510
Over there, here, here.

1021
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:42,730
Yeah, in this truck.

1022
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:45,690
So, Dito, you gotta watch that zipline because these guys
can be here.

1023
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:46,190
I'm looking behind us.

1024
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:47,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1025
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,030
If someone gets close to you, just run straight for me.

1026
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:51,790
I can smoke for you.

1027
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:52,030
Okay.

1028
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:54,670
We'll just give up that house if we have to.

1029
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,670
But for now, just pretend like you're a full team there.

1030
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:57,670
All right.

1031
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,770
I'm a full team.

1032
01:05:58,870 --> 01:05:59,950
Don't come near me.

1033
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:04,530
Yeah, they can hear this, but that works.

1034
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,350
Oh, come near me.

1035
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,470
I'm standing on the roof because I'm so confident with my
team.

1036
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,070
One team that are in a tunnel.

1037
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,110
Oh, shit.

1038
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,710
Maybe I shouldn't stand on the roof anymore.

1039
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:16,350
I'm going to shoot it.

1040
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,490
I'm shooting tunnels so they know I'm here.

1041
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,370
I'm getting a long boat from fucking...

1042
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:25,430
Oh, this guy's dropped down.

1043
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,150
Okay, they dropped down.

1044
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:27,770
One guy dropped down.

1045
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:29,310
Two of them, I think.

1046
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,210
I think all of them dropped down.

1047
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,190
Yeah, they're going for this build.

1048
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,230
They're gonna hold that building.

1049
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,270
I cannot see people behind me anymore.

1050
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:37,930
Oh no, they're over here.

1051
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:39,250
Okay.

1052
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,930
I need to save my heavy.

1053
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:44,050
I just run through heavy.

1054
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,830
There's people over where I pinged, northeast, 72.

1055
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:48,970
Okay.

1056
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:49,750
Three.

1057
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:52,090
Are you okay?

1058
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,050
Yeah, I'm okay.

1059
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:53,970
I'm just poking them.

1060
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,450
Just being annoying.

1061
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,930
Just let everyone know we're here.

1062
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,070
That's basically what we're doing right now.

1063
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:09,130
much noise so people are afraid of like pushing this area
and if we get evac we just have to full fight for the spot

1064
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:17,550
we can't lose this spot so if i get like pushed here i need
you guys to instantly like come here help me here we do not

1067

Oh my god.

1068
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:36,030
Okay, Dita, I'm gonna go for a banner.

1069
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:38,630
I got shot by so many people.

1070
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,250
Okay, I'm gonna go away.

1071
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,050
I got shot by two different teams.

1072
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,230
I hated here.

1073
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:47,110
Really?

1074
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,730
Guys, never...

1075
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,350
Okay, that's what happened to me.

1076
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,810
That's what happened to me.

1077
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,470
I told you!

1078
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:55,650
I don't know, stop.

1079
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:56,690
Res, res, res, res.

1080
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,310
I told you!

1081
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,430
Once you behind us, punch me behind us, yeah.

1082
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,430
Yeah, they're pushing, they're pushing, they're pushing.

1083
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:04,250
From where?

1084
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:07,030
You get my ra- Oh, okay, I'm holding that.

1085
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:07,890
Okay.

1086
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,070
She didn't get the rest, she didn't get the rest.

1087
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,610
Yeah, I can smoke for you later, just stay alive.

1088
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,230
What the fuck?

1089
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:19,370
Every team is looking at us.

1090
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,010
I will go on time and cover you.

1091
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:23,170
Yeah.

1092
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:24,990
Where do I land?

1093
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:25,570
Where do I land?

1094
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:27,010
I'll go, Bob.

1095
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:27,890
A Bob probably is the best.

1096
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:28,190
You cover.

1097
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,370
Everybody's running sniper.

1098
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,050
Yeah, it's just normal.

1099
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:37,790
I can smoke your box later so you can take your shit.

1100
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:40,410
If we lose this spot, we didn't, right?

1101
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:41,470
I don't see anyone here.

1102
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,330
Oh, here I am.

1103
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:46,910
I don't even know if I can.

1104
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,030
I'll smoke your box later.

1105
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:49,130
Okay.

1106
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,270
I think I got these walls.

1107
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:51,050
Yeah, I got them.

1108
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:51,710
Oh, there's landing.

1109
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:52,490
They're landing on the house.

1110
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:53,390
They're landing on the house.

1111
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:54,690
One team landing.

1112
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:55,030
Yeah.

1113
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:55,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1114
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:58,450
Yeah, okay.

1115
01:08:58,530 --> 01:08:58,950
We can get up.

1116
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:00,250
Fuck this.

1117
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,190
I'm going to run sniper next.

1118
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:02,050
Yeah, I see him.

1119
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:02,590
This blue armor.

1120
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:04,730
This guy's alone, I think.

1121
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:05,650
One is me.

1122
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:06,850
No.

1123
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:11,210
I can't, like, I can't hit her because she's teleporting!

1124
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:15,330
I'm gonna scan behind us.

1125
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,850
Fuck, that's a loot box of juice.

1126
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:20,790
That loot box is juice.

1127
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:22,490
I want it.

1128
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:23,230
Cover me?

1129
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:26,050
Uh, okay.

1130
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,050
Okay, okay.

1131
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,290
I'll stay up here.

1132
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:33,250
I'll stay up here, guys.

1133
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:35,530
I'm just a little baby.

1134
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:39,170
I need ammo, ammo, heavy ammo.

1135
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:40,590
There's no heavy ammo.

1136
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:41,510
There's only light ammo.

1137
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:42,430
Okay.

1138
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:44,430
I have seven bats.

1139
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:45,310
I can give bats.

1140
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:46,810
Okay, yeah, I don't have ammo.

1141
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,110
Can I have ammo, dad?

1142
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,330
I don't think you can, Dito.

1143
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:51,330
You might die.

1144
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,030
Maybe if I give you some.

1145
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:54,470
Doki, Doki, three bats right here.

1146
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:55,450
Yeah, I'll take it.

1147
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:55,770
You need cells?

1148
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:56,950
Here's four cells as well.

1149
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:57,630
Yeah.

1150
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:59,390
Wait, is someone zipping behind us?

1151
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:01,470
They are.

1152
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:01,730
They are.

1153
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:02,130
They're above.

1154
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,530
They're above.

1155
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,950
They literally came up when I dropped down.

1156
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:06,190
That's fucked up.

1157
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:07,390
You have to play for me.

1158
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:08,050
You have to play for me.

1159
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:08,310
Oh, my God.

1160
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:09,050
That's fucked up.

1161
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:11,450
I literally got over here.

1162
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,550
These guys are going to get bullied by everyone, so it's
fine.

1163
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:17,090
How is he seeing purple armor?

1164
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:18,330
Okay.

1165
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,190
I'm so sad.

1166
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,810
I literally got off just for the...

1167
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:24,030
It's literally like that...

1168
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:25,490
We got a hyper-focus that team.

1169
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,570
For that loot box over there?

1170
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:30,730
Is there attachments in that box or no?

1171
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,790
Yeah, like 301 attachments.

1172
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:33,850
Oh, 301?

1173
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,110
I can smoke it if you want.

1174
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,110
Oh, no, I'm fine.

1175
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,430
I'm fine.

1176
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:38,190
Wait, is there a scope in there or no?

1177
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:39,470
Probably.

1178
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:39,990
Yeah, two times.

1179
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:40,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1180
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:40,710
I need it.

1181
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:41,050
I need it.

1182
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:41,750
Can you smoke it?

1183
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:42,650
All right.

1184
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:42,950
Okay.

1185
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:45,890
Okay, we got to only watch this team behind us.

1186
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:50,410
This team literally has to push us or they die or they have
to go below.

1187
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,630
So this team is like hyper priority right now.

1188
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,910
They're getting crypto-ulted.

1189
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:55,890
Okay, I got him.

1190
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:56,130
Okay.

1191
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,350
These guys get crypto-ulted.

1192
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:57,810
What the fuck?

1193
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,270
Why?

1194
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:00,430
Why?

1195
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:01,090
Wait, I'm not here.

1196
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:10,150

1201
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,260
I can scan the replicator, but I don't know if you want to
go or what.

1202
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,040
All right, you're gonna smoke it, smoke it, smoke it.

1203
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,780
I smoke it if you want to build ammo.

1204
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,440
Do you want to do it?

1205

Ditto.

01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,620
Yeah, just make sure you craft ammo and then come back past.

1210
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:02,260
Both of you craft ammo.

1211
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,080
There's a team in front of us.

1212
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:03,780

01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:32,480
All dead, all dead.

1245
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,760
But another team behind us, maybe.

1246
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,140
My game all tab!

1247
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:36,660

1248
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:39,680

I got green, my game all tab for some reason!

1250
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,780
Did it play on me, did it though?

1251
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,520
There's still more in front.

1252
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,420
I'm so sad.

1253
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,300

I told you.

1256
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,220
Yeah, but it's... don't worry, it's near fault.

1257
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,380
Yeah, my game actually all tab.

1258
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,540
This is a few laggy bullshit, man.

1259
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:12,860
holy shit i'm shooting at a guy there's nothing happening to
him can you tell him to swap maybe swap servers i don't

1260
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:18,640
think it's a server thing i'm not sure just sit live just
play like play your life two guys in front of you did though

1261
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:24,460
yeah just play your life did oh just rat just rat yeah just
play below you can they're probably gonna fight each other

1262
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:29,900
you'll be free if there was a team true below us in the
earlier so careful

1263
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:42,280
you can go close to the truck later i think left side all
the way left side if you walk with zone you should be okay

1264
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:50,800
left side yeah like there i don't know how i i don't know
why it's suddenly tabbed out it was crazy maybe click the

She's also in zone now.

1274
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,080
Play behind the truck.

1275
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:16,240
Right there.

1276
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,020
Oh, right side.

1277
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:17,620
Person right side.

1278
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:19,720
Nice.

1279
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,100
Good kill.

1280
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:20,800
Someone's in truck.

1281
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,040
Just play behind the truck.

1282
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,180
Just crouch behind the truck.

1283
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,640
Seal their door.

1284
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,280
Seal their door.

1285
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:28,700
It's okay.

1286
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:30,620
She's fine.

1287
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,640
When you seal their door though.

1288
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:43,080
yeah oh no no you forgot to lock it you forgot to lock it
what i lock it no you you open no they opened the door when

1289
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:54,720
you sealed it so you have to close it again before i stay i
stay i stay only one guy yeah no way that's one guy we got

1290
01:15:54,720 --> 01:16:03,460
top five we're always top five i'm fighting a bloodhound and
i'm shooting havoc at him and there's no numbers coming out

1291
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:11,660
of my there's nothing it's like because you're streaming
maybe at this time when you're streaming in no because it

1292
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:20,840
was happening off stream as well so i don't think that's a
stream thing we're consistent guys it's the pink because i i

1293
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:30,380
didn't i didn't see the um door open yeah my stream is not
dropping any frames it's not lagging like it's perfectly

1294
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:38,980
fine my discord is just a game if the game is just fucking
like i don't know maybe it's maybe it's apex i don't know

1295
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:54,840
oh my god a person or maybe it's your vpn um it's it's
pretty much the same with everything it's just more pink you

1296
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:06,640
shoot north america not that light yeah it's not i'm i am on
north america oh how was the first game first game was fine

1297
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,200
first game then how How about you change to Dahlia's again?

1298
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,440
I can, yeah.

1299
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,640
That's so weird.

1300
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,000
I wonder why you're having these problems.

1301
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:22,820
I don't know.

1302
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:23,920
It might be my shitty eyes.

1303
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,440
Does it only happen during, like, our tournament thing, or
was it?

1304
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:28,360
Because it was okay.

1305
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:33,180
No, it was happening during my, like, when I was playing
Ranked, during stream, it was happening, too.

1306
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,120
It is kind of my one, I think.

1307
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:36,440
Ha!

1308
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,680
Look at him looking funny hopping to shoot back.

1309
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:49,620
just shoot back i don't why is he just moving maybe they
didn't have reloaded oh is that 1v1 this could be a 1v1 yeah

1310
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:56,240
yeah i think this is a 1v1 if they're not if he's not
getting pushed wait they're not why are they so scared oh

1311
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:05,680
why are you yeah why was he so scared okay let me try
switching maybe again okay

1312
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:22,820
have ended it early guys yay top five again we're consistent
we keep getting top five with no kills because i can't kill

1313
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:33,080
anyone we got four kills oh did we okay yeah we got four
kills that's something but i i could have killed both of

1314
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:43,340
those guys there if he wasn't just teleporting shooting a
whole hell clip and nothing comes out dude it's so stupid

1315
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:52,740
also I think he needs to like change the he needs to keep
changing the code because I think the server gets laggier

1316
01:18:52,740 --> 01:19:04,610
over time let him know that I don't think he has more codes
I think he only has one wait this is a custom code no I'm

1317
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:13,810
pretty sure this is literally just a random server code it's
a custom code oh from apex oh yeah it starts with a p uh

1318
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:24,430
random server code start with a c but why would he why does
it matter does it matter if you get if you get a code from

1319
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:36,870
ea it's higher quality because dedicated server oh i see and
uh i'm guessing he only got one code because yeah 15 minute

1320
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:44,170
15 minute what am I going to do for 15 minutes oh yeah
there's a 15 because they're going to interview the top 5

1321
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:54,090

it after you turn me yeah yeah wait why can't you just do it

1322
01:19:54,090 --> 01:20:02,750

1323
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,590
the tournament.

1324
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:06,290
I think.

1325
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:09,250

1326
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,750
Okay.

1327
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,230
I guess like they're not...

1328
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:13,530
Did you see me?

1329
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:14,170
Yeah, yeah.

1330
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:15,350
I mean, yeah.

1331
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:15,990
Yeah.

1332
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:19,490
They should.

1333
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:20,530
They should be.

1334
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,330
Why would they interview me?

1335
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,650
So I can tell them their server sucks?

1336
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:25,990
Do it.

1337
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:27,570
We're not top five.

1338
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,670
We're not top five, though.

1339
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:29,670
We're top six.

1340
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:31,610
Good.

1341
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:32,930
Thank God, no interview.

1342
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:35,010
That's my plan.

1343
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:37,690
Midway, the first three games, top six.

1344
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,630
They're going to interview it.

1345
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:39,910
And then you win the last three games.

1346
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:42,610
Oh, haven't we won a game?

1347
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,350
We don't far.

1348
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:47,730
Are you seriously asking that?

1349
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,910
I mean, like, whatever.

1350
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:53,790
RPR, why haven't we won?

1351
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,990
I thought we're TSM.

1352
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:55,790
I don't know, Doki.

1353
01:20:56,150 --> 01:21:01,750
It's kind of hard to win two or three, you know, like when
someone, when our team dies on a roof, our team dies on a,

1354
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:05,870
on a wall, he's like, wait, who died on the wall?

1355
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:08,410
Fucking?

1356
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:11,870
Who died on the wall?

1357
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:18,090
Jesus Christ died reincarnated on the wall.

1358
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:19,650
What do you think died on the wall?

1359
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:21,590
I know it wasn't me.

1360
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:22,670
You had selective memory?

1361
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:24,130
I know it wasn't me.

1362
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:26,650
Okay, stop the cat.

1363
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:29,950
Selective memory, looking ass.

1364
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:41,730
I contributed I think I were exactly six so no interview
yeah we don't have to talk to people but then you have to

1365
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:55,430
talk to me fuck yeah which is better right yeah so much
better it's like so much better I think we should change our

1366
01:21:55,430 --> 01:22:06,450
comp no why we didn't get first I don't think you get a
input on comp But like we didn't get first though Both of

1367
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:17,110
you have lost your ability To put input anything about the
comp Just gonna put that out there Both of you have lost

1368
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:26,550
that ability I no longer listen to you I am the captain Okay
I found the main steam I'm gonna watch main steam The main

1369
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:35,750
steam Wait we're gonna check out the interviews yeah i'm
surprised you're interviewing five different teams that's

1370
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:44,730
like a lot of teams why why should it be like three because
like who cares who cares when somebody is like top five like

1371
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:50,370
rank four and five they should just interview you though
killing honestly true they should just interview me i'm the

1372
01:22:50,370 --> 01:23:01,470
most important i mean yours three needs to know what you
said before You know what she said?

1373
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:03,630
You know what she said before she started streaming?

1374
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:08,230
She was like, RPR, you shouldn't stream so I can get all the
viewers.

1375
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:10,530
And I was like, you already have enough viewers.

1376
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:12,650
And she was like, I want your viewers too.

1377
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:16,350
He's twisting the story because he literally was like, I
don't want to stream.

1378
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:17,370
That's what he said to us.

1379
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:18,870
He's like, I don't want to stream.

1380
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:19,950
And I was like, oh, I should.

1381
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:21,170
Okay, then don't stream.

1382
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:21,890
Just don't stream.

1383
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,270
That's good.

1384
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,610
So then I get to keep all the viewers.

1385
01:23:24,710 --> 01:23:27,030
No, you said, you said, I don't want to stream.

1386
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:28,730
You literally said, I don't want to stream.

1387
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:37,990
stop gaslighting i said should i record this conversation no

1388
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:46,630

what we have to stream comma like quote unquote i don't want

1389
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:58,570

1390
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:06,950

1391
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:13,310

viewers i said you have enough viewers

1395
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,590
Okay, quote for quote.

1396
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:33,590
Ditto, who's right?

1397
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:34,770
Ditto, who's right?

1398
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,850
Am I right or RPR right?

1399
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:37,610
Ditto, come on, Ditto.

1400
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:38,830
Ditto, who's right?

1401
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,250
Come on, Ditto, don't betray me.

1402
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:42,050
Do you want to hear my answer?

1403
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:42,410
Yeah.

1404
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:43,090
Yeah.

1405
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:45,270
You're going to betray me again.

1406
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,070
It's okay.

1407
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:47,290
I'm asking.

1408
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:51,870
It's okay because everything was recorded on Ditto's stream.

1409
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:56,970
So, like, whatever you say, everyone is going to know that
you guys are lying.

1410
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:57,690
Because there's proof.

1411
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,450
No, everybody would know I'm fucking right.

1412
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:02,730
I've never lied in my fucking life.

1413
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:04,790
That's true.

1414
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,100
That's the first lie.

1415
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,020
I'm the most honest man in this universe.

1416
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,680
That's already the first lie.

1417
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,580
You're not the most honest man in the universe?

1418
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,160
When did I lie?

1419
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,160
You're more honest than fucking Jesus?

1420
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:22,840
Yes.

1421
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,540
I'm the reincarnation of Jesus Christ in Apex Legends.

1422
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,380
Reincarnation of Jesus Christ who lives in...

1423
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:33,080
Eastern Europe.

1424
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,340
I've never lied my life.

1425
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,980
I would never fucking lie.

1426
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,180
That's so fucking cap.

1427
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,520
Ask me anti, I won't lie.

1428
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,120
How much do you earn per month?

1429

Literally NDA.

1431
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,240
That's not a lie.

1432

That is literally not a lie because I'm NDA.

1433

I literally can't tell you.

1434

It's not a lie.

01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,140
Who the fuck did you sign a contract with yourself?

1436
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,580

I literally need money.

1497
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:13,840
You're like pulling.

1498
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,780
You make 2K a month.

1499
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:19,320
Don't talk about my salary.

1500
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,160
2K is like an estimate.

1501
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,520
Like some months it's lower.

1502
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:26,460
Sometimes it's high.

1503
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,400
You know how Twitch works.

1504
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,720
But you also have your esports salary that you won't tell
us.

1505
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,700
So it's more.

1506
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,380
An esports salary that may I ask.

1507
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:40,960
that i'm still not receiving because i haven't moved to
japan by the way yeah that was that's that's your own issue

1508
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:51,580
now that's a visa issue that's you you can move at any you
can live technically you can sort of start living there

1509
01:31:55,100 --> 01:32:05,520
how would they know i think i think for all the content i i
i create here you should give me some subs for real and you

1510
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:12,160
should give us subs for giving you content you should give
us subs for giving you content because we're asking the hard

1590
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:20,800

1591
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:27,120
i'm not really money i'm not a money hungry person in
general like as long as i have enough to survive every month

1592
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:32,220
i'm chilling i don't really care about being like a
millionaire or being rich as fuck i just want to have fun

01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:46,680
and live like be alive buy food yeah pay rent as long as i
can pay your money for my gosh yeah okay wait wait a minute

1594
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:58,420
that's less honorable as long as i can give this big
corporation all my money that i earn with hard work every

1595
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:59,540
every month

1596
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:17,040
be okay as long as as long as i can give them all my money
then yeah i'll be good you know what she's right you can't

1597
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:23,900
judge her rpr you spend money on apex i'm judging i don't
tell you i stopped playing money on apex like a year ago but

1598
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:28,140
you had you did though but okay hear me out i was

1599
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:40,940
money of the game that's why i don't judge you by buying
skins i was single-handedly increasing my price pool every

1600
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:51,080
tournament you understand so i was investing into my future
by buying skins think about that think about that for a

1601
01:38:51,080 --> 01:39:00,500
second no that's stupid i did i thought about it that's
stupid whatever why would why would you why would you invest

1602
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:05,220
in the in the game when you could have when you can have
other people invest in it.

1603
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:11,960
Because at a certain time in my life, I was actually naive
and believed that this game was going in a good direction.

1604
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,460
And then I regret all of my choices.

1605
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,780
I'm only playing it because you invited me to this
tournament.

1606
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,200
Yeah, but you were playing it yesterday.

1607
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,020
Yeah, because I was practicing for the tournament.

1608
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:25,140
Yeah, but then you were playing before it.

1609
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,440
But you played before I invited you to the tournament.

1610
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,580
Because I had Apex Matsuri.

1611

And I knew that I had to practice.

1612
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:39,840

only good thing is like playing tournaments in this game

01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:44,620

1723
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:47,600
Okay.

1724
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:48,800
I think I've already.

1725
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,340
It's a full team.

1726
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:51,560
It's a full team.

1727
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,840
Do you have Evac, Dito?

1728
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,940
I had Evac, though.

1729
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:58,660
They were like crouching outside, too.

1730
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:00,240
We have 20 seconds.

1731
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:01,160
We just have to go straight.

1732
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:01,980
We have another choice.

1733
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:04,720
Oh my god.

1734
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:07,840
I got fucking grieved so hard.

1735
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:10,540
I had no meds left, I think.

1736
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,440
I don't know.

1737
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,560
I don't want to die.

1738
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:14,200
I have to read the play.

1739
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:14,760
I have to read the play.

1740
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:23,060
You have to get... There's a callus spike them from you so
yeah this is what it is we are not sure what to run through

1741
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:31,100
it you guys have a mobile respawn though yeah but these guys
are gonna be our biggest problem yes we have a wall we have

1742
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:43,740
a wall perfect oh my god i almost saw my old so one time did
you guys get my redeploy uh i don't know i didn't get i have

1743
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:53,580
mobile mobile come with me i get my ult i'm gonna side okay
okay two percent one percent oh there's a guy up the rock

1744
01:49:53,580 --> 01:50:01,640
there's a guy off the rock i just saw him this guy from the
left is annoying this is my old i'm probably dead yeah

1745
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:13,220
you're dead what is wrong with people why are you guys
playing like this guys we shouldn't play edge we didn't have

1746
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:21,420
we weren't edging there we were going zone but Everyone else
was, for some reason, rotating towards us out of zone.

1747
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,560
Because they don't have to rotate.

1748
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,680
So they rotate into us.

1749
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:29,520
How does that make sense?

1750
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:30,640
Did everyone swap?

1751
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,600
I don't want to play Blood Out anyway.

1752
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:38,060
I'm getting bullied on Blood Out.

1753
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:42,280
They don't know where they're going, so they're just running
randomly, I guess.

1754
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,580
What the fuck is going on?

1755
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:47,600
I mean...

1756
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:51,460
Maybe we can play like casual, like, um, kill everyone that
we see.

1757
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,760
Yeah, maybe we have to just murder people.

1758
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:54,760
I think so.

1759
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:55,200
I think we just fight.

1760
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:56,620
We should fight.

1761
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:57,320
We can fight.

1762
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:58,140
We can't fight.

1763
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:01,080
Because we can't rotate because we will, we will do stupid
shit.

1764
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:02,160
So we just have to fight everyone.

1765
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,460
Fight the horse over.

1766
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,520
Might as well.

1767
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:08,000
I mean, we have to get kill points now at this point.

1768
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:09,360
Yes.

1769
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:15,080
Yeah, we're just getting like, I mean, I got fucking, I got
capped out.

1770
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:17,300
I literally saw a guy fucking hugging the wall.

1771
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:28,680
like three teams came to us like outside the zone i i don't
know why two teams came to barometer behind us barometer was

1772
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:37,220
nowhere near the zone like and then sandwiched us with two
more teams that were in prowler nest so we got sandwiched by

1773
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:44,740
four teams that were not in the zone and not moving towards
this isn't a jp tournament this is a this is an naeu

1774
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:56,240
tournament yeah i forgot brain cells here nobody rotates you
gotta remember nobody rotate just fight everyone just get

1775
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:06,470
good look fight everyone get red armors fight fuck it
there's too many control players in this in this lobby for

1776
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:18,770
there to be any iq involved so we have to fight all right we
start fighting next game okay we have to just full fight

1777
01:52:18,770 --> 01:52:21,270
everyone Wait, are you still lagging, though?

1778
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:26,510
I feel like I'm lagging, but like I'm just ignoring it
mentally.

1779
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:31,130
Yeah, you choose if you believe there's no lagging.

1780
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:32,350
Maybe there isn't.

1781
01:52:33,150 --> 01:52:35,420
There's nothing I can do about it, so I'll just ignore it.

1782
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:42,010
All right, now I'm going to be...

1783
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:46,850
The fact that we even rescued there was only for the fact
that there were so many teams there that they couldn't

1784
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:47,530
finish you.

1785
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:48,870
Thank fucking God.

1786
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:49,950
See, everybody's fighting.

1787
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:51,210
Nobody's playing zone.

1788
01:52:53,410 --> 01:52:55,350
There's a fight to our left as well.

1789
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,550
They're freaks, man.

1790
01:52:58,850 --> 01:52:59,930
These guys think they're playing pubs.

1791
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:08,910
We're just going to run around and get all the beacons in
the world until we have, like, purple, red, and we're just

1792
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:10,150
going to fight the first team we see.

1793
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:11,890
Look at that!

1794
01:53:11,970 --> 01:53:13,650
There's only four teams they're fighting!

1795
01:53:15,970 --> 01:53:18,090
What the fuck am I looking at?

1796
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:20,770
Why can't we do that?

1797
01:53:23,850 --> 01:53:24,990
I don't know.

1798
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:27,110
Why can't that be us?

1799
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:28,830
I don't know.

1800
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:30,290
Maybe stop dying?

1801
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:31,510
Oh, okay.

1802
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:33,150
Hey, Doki, scan the ring.

1803
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:34,350
Okay, no smoke.

1804
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:35,090
That's fine.

1805
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:37,630
You can't blame me for that.

1806
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:38,530
You can't blame me.

1807
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:41,010
Why is there four teams in Prowler Nest?

1808
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:44,790
Why are they there?

1809
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:45,870
Like, what are they looking for?

1810
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:48,370
The fucking hidden treasure from Captain Morgan?

1811
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:49,870
You can't blame it on me!

1812
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:52,390
You call me the scat!

1813
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:54,370
Listen, I was listening.

1814
01:53:54,850 --> 01:53:58,910
The other game, you sit on a roof and three teams beam me up
same time.

1815
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:01,350
Hey, Doki, do the people scan.

1816
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:04,790
Okay, let me do the people scan as there was no smoke.

1817
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:09,750
And my Bangalore was looking away from me while I get shot
at.

1818
01:54:10,210 --> 01:54:10,690
Oh, okay.

1819
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:12,130
Yeah, it's my fault.

1820
01:54:12,270 --> 01:54:12,830
First game.

1821
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:14,550
And then your Bangalore rescued.

1822
01:54:14,850 --> 01:54:15,730
First game.

1823
01:54:16,610 --> 01:54:17,930
I didn't die first.

1824
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:19,210
First game, you both got.

1825
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:20,850
You can't gasp your way out of this.

1826
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:21,950
You can't gasp your way out.

1827
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:22,810
Second game.

1828

We're whole, their hosts and their devs are always together.

1836
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:08,990
No.

1837
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:09,770

1838
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:11,150

Why am I too?

1845
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:19,030
We want, I'm not going to IGL anymore.

1846
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:21,050
Why am I getting too involved if I'm an IGL?

1847
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:22,410
I'm not going to IGL anymore.

1848
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:24,250
You guys ideal then.

1849
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:24,390
You always get 2v1.

1850
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:27,070
Imperial Hal is able to get 2v1.

1851
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:28,410
No.

1852
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:29,330
Imperial 1.

1853
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:31,350
Imperial Hal 1v1 V2s.

1854
01:55:31,390 --> 01:55:32,030
There's a difference.

1855
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:34,610
You're just the...

1856
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:35,490
What can I say?

1857
01:55:35,650 --> 01:55:37,870
You're just the poor man's Imperial.

1858
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:42,470
You guys are poor man's reps in the event.

1859
01:55:42,810 --> 01:55:44,170
Like, what the fuck is going on?

1860
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:48,810
No, we're the better version of reps in for Hulse because
we're anime girls.

1861
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:51,710
We're the better version because we're anime girls.

1862
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:58,670
version because we're anime girls anime girls are out of

1869
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:16,780
at least get kill points and lose like why why be smart when
you can be dumb like that's my motto yeah because we're the

1870
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:22,360
better dumb players like why why why put your effort in
being smart we need to be

1871
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:34,140
I mean to be fair that's you yeah that's you on default
though You're like you literally like half an hour ago

1872
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:42,340
admitted that you are not smart you said I'm dumb Yeah but
like but like I have smart moments Do you okay I had smart

1873
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:49,720
moments in my life too like I won't yes like that was smart
that was pretty smart Yeah but that was two years ago Okay

1874
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:52,240
and I do smart things every now and then

1875
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:57,580
But, like, I don't need to be smart anymore.

1876
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:58,760
Like, I can be dumb.

1877
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,620
I'm in a position where I can be dumb.

1878
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:05,540
So, why would I put effort in being smart?

1879
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:06,340
I can just be dumb.

1880
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:07,160
To win the tournament.

1881
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:08,060
To win easier.

1882
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,420
Who the fuck cares?

1883
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:11,720
Who the fuck cares?

1884
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:23,550
I'm, like, 25% Manera, 25% dumb, 50% 50% don't care.

1885
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:25,290
This is the life I lead.

1886
01:58:25,690 --> 01:58:26,270
Holy shit.

1887
01:58:26,330 --> 01:58:27,970
The first place team is 79%.

1888
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:38,810
points that's crazy yeah i mean the balancing is just out of
this world there's the balance is just out we just blame it

1889
01:58:38,810 --> 01:58:48,070
on balancing and we're good yeah that team doesn't have a
pro player the balancing is way out the balancing is crazy i

1890
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:55,370
fear that team doesn't even have a pro player the balancing
is crazy in what way they probably have three controllers

1891
01:58:57,990 --> 01:59:07,610
controllers therefore uh 0.4 that's 40 of all their efforts
is controlled by an ai therefore mnk 40 of their point

1892
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:14,250
that's bullshit there's no way all of them mnk absolutely
not possible you don't know this you're just gaslighting no

1893
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:20,790
i'm speaking where's callus where's callus where's okay
there okay you don't even know where we're all we're done i

1894
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:33,530
have like callus in like a two two two plus months oh my god
Ah, my cable's stuck on my chair.

1895
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:34,410
What?

1896
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:35,870
What?

1897
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:36,930
What happened?

1898
01:59:38,090 --> 01:59:38,930
I watched your stream.

1899
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:41,010
She's going through a lot right now.

1900
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:43,410
Almost my head.

1901
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:44,910
Almost run over my head.

1902
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:51,890
She's going through a lot.

1903
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:55,150
And whose fault is it?

1904
01:59:55,370 --> 02:00:01,790
No, I mean, the first place team They have good ping.

1905
02:00:02,630 --> 02:00:03,150
That's the reason.

1906
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:03,650
That too.

1907
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:06,830
That is also a valid factor.

1908
02:00:07,070 --> 02:00:09,630
I literally asked you, are you okay with playing on NA ping?

1909
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:10,470
And you said yes.

1910
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:14,470
Our good ping player is not doing shit.

1911
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:19,090
You said we're going to destroy the tournament.

1912
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:21,570
I was like, are you okay with playing on NA ping?

1913
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:22,490
And you're like, yes.

1914
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:25,790
Okay, well, but unforeseen circumstances happen.

1915
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:27,470
One, I'm lagging like a bitch.

1916
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:30,110
Two, what is this balance?

1917
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:31,430
Like, what the fuck?

1918
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:33,030
They have three Fred players on one team.

1919
02:00:33,110 --> 02:00:34,010
You're telling me that's okay?

1920
02:00:34,850 --> 02:00:35,210
What?

1921
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:36,030
For which one?

1922
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:37,010
Which team?

1923
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:38,510
The first team?

1924
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:41,050
First place team is not three Fred players.

1925
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:41,750
It's like two.

1926
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:42,430
Who are they?

1927
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:43,090
Do you know them?

1928
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:45,470
It's Kaisa and Hachi.

1929
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:50,670
You're telling me Kaisa and Hachi are dropping 79 points?

1930
02:00:50,750 --> 02:00:51,850
Yeah, they are.

1931
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:55,070
Who's their third?

1932
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:55,670
Who's their third?

1933
02:00:55,730 --> 02:00:57,910
I don't know, Seroku or some shit.

1934
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:59,570
I don't fucking know who that guy is.

1935
02:01:02,610 --> 02:01:15,910
that's literally a team of magic our team is literally three
fred players okay bro okay three fred players stop the cap

1936
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:27,850
none of us have gotten fred in like four years calm down
yeah but the first place team never touched fred okay but

1937
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:37,450
like touching fred means nothing in game yeah and they never
they've been masters we've all been masters is why are we

1938
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:45,170

1939
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:45,930

1944
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:33,230

then at least we get kill points Yeah, and when we die, you

1945
02:02:33,230 --> 02:02:35,530
get one kill point and you die and think that's how you play
tournaments?

1946
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:38,470
That's better than zero kill points.

1947
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:41,690
I just can't handle you.

1948
02:02:44,790 --> 02:02:45,990
There's no way you're serious.

1949
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:48,590
You're not even serious about his tournament.

1950
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:49,390

02:13:40,700 --> 02:13:41,780
I'm going to dis-tie the door.

2115
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:42,700
I'm on the roof.

2116
02:13:42,820 --> 02:13:43,460

Yes, I told you, I'm not that smart.

2169
02:16:56,900 --> 02:17:00,940
You're the one that, in fact, you're the one that didn't
fact check the dumb person.

2170
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:03,980
Now, you're right, I should never trust my teammates.

2171
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:06,000
You're right.

2172
02:17:07,460 --> 02:17:09,660
You're the IGL, you should think for yourself.

2173
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:13,640
Yeah, you're right, no, this is my mission.

2174
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:22,860

the igl you should know like i was wrong that you're a liar

2175
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:31,100
yeah i got it i mean i admitted it right off the bat like

2176
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:39,740

is really your fault i might as well have you on mute

2177
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:40,620

2180
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:12,420
that was the worst yeah i ever heard my life

2181
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:34,160
I'm having the best time of my life friends I can trust you
I can't trust her I can't X people in the same team Fuda and

2182
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:37,940
Zero Nothing play on the same ALGS team

2183
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:53,140
I'll say that again Fuda and Zero Nothing the members of the
first place team are playing in the same algs team yeah but

2184
02:18:53,140 --> 02:19:04,800
anybody can sign up in algs anybody can sign up zero nothing
i was in algs and cc has been playing pro for five years

2185
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:13,280
yeah but he's never made it what do you mean he's never made
it he's been on g2 and like many other ores what are you on

2186
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:22,400
about yeah but i don't know who he is so he's never made it
oh my god you're such a narcissist it's insane

2187
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:35,140
she thinks the world revolves around her thank you 25 queues
they have 25 queues yeah bro they're playing lgs against a

2188
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:42,200
couple of vtubers that's what i'm saying this is not vtuber
tournament because there's not enough vtubers there's not

2189
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:45,280
enough vtubers to make a vtuber tournament

2190
02:19:53,230 --> 02:20:01,690
this is my reality if i don't know who they are you never
made it i told them to pack their bags they're done they're

2191
02:20:01,690 --> 02:20:09,850
done for the day wait how did they get into a vtuber
tournament wait a minute that's actually a good question are

2192
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:12,490
they in the vtuber tournament of it.

2193
02:20:16,750 --> 02:20:20,850
Because, like, I'd understand the other pro players because
they know VTubers.

2194
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:23,770
Which VTuber do they know?

2195
02:20:25,310 --> 02:20:27,650
I don't think they have a VTuber on their team.

2196
02:20:27,810 --> 02:20:28,930
Wait, what?

2197
02:20:29,210 --> 02:20:30,210
Why are they here?

2198
02:20:32,350 --> 02:20:34,390
Wait, why are they here?

2199
02:20:35,110 --> 02:20:38,350
I would assume they would have at least one VTuber.

2200
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:44,690
They're literally playing ALGS and we're over here in
Kindergarten wait people are actually saying they don't have

2201
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:54,790
one wait what the fuck they don't even they don't even have
a vtuber on their team no they don't they actually don't is

2202
02:20:54,790 --> 02:21:00,410
this isn't this a vtuber to the main no yeah by name

2203
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:14,030
by name it's supposed to be a vtuber tournament no we over
here plugging in league and they're playing lgs this is not

2204
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:19,950
fair their 3d model is just that insane

2205
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:39,610
guys guys you don't understand guys to be fair there's not
enough na apex vtubers or eu to be fair type one in shots to

2206
02:21:39,610 --> 02:21:45,430
kick a nominates at the tournament everyone's typing one all
right pack To be fair, they're all swarming from EU.

2207
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:47,250
And you know how bad EU prize.

2208
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:48,850
You don't make money in EU.

2209
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:53,030
They need this.

2210
02:21:56,130 --> 02:21:56,930
I mean, am I...

2211
02:21:56,930 --> 02:21:57,590
Is that bad?

2212
02:21:59,270 --> 02:22:01,590
EU's pretty bad when it comes to prize pools.

2213
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:02,670
You know that.

2214
02:22:05,570 --> 02:22:09,510
How many points do they get right now?

2215
02:22:09,710 --> 02:22:11,450
They got 25 kills, man.

2216
02:22:11,710 --> 02:22:12,190
Yeah.

2217
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:26,840
I think they've had multiple 20 kill games in this lobby I
mean they're just running I mean they're running at people

2218
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:32,520
who don't even play this game something like not don't play
but like obviously not that level so it's like very easy for

2219
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:38,820
them but I'm saying it's so fucking unbalanced like no one
can say anything we have ALGS team in first place and then

2220
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:48,440
everyone else like they have like a hundred points already
like what are we playing what do I sign up for fucking for a

2221
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:49,760
second place.

2222
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:58,920
Like, I think even if we killed everyone in the lobby and
won the game and respawn farm, then we can't catch up to

2223
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,240
them.

2224
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:10,320
we'd need to go on like a, like a, we'd need to respawn farm
every single team once in this lobby and we still wouldn't

2225
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:10,960
catch up to them.

2226
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:16,240
Wait, even we respawn farm, what if we all work together
with the other teams and just respawn farm them?

2227
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:23,500
Justin Pete yeah we should just kick them kick them out to
tournament yeah but they're still gonna be first place no

2228
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:35,530
matter what delete the wads delete their points move along
i'd deal with them quick then second place is first place

2229
02:23:35,530 --> 02:23:46,210
now guys yeah first place no bread second place all bread
and also wherever we land should be like a extra prize pool

2230
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:49,370
guys just start the game guys i don't care i

2231
02:23:53,150 --> 02:24:01,290
guys if they're trying to figure out what to do with team

are TSM what do you mean with TSM we are TSM yeah we got

2264
02:29:10,980 --> 02:29:22,400

kind of sucks ass yeah but you're the IGL so it is your

2265
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:30,200
follow that's not how things work in life you can just blame
everything on the game leader yes you can that's the whole

2266
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:37,500
point you have to reflect on your own actions sometimes no
but my game leader doesn't teach me well we'll teach you

2267
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:43,300
what you're unteachable I'm not we use yeah Tekken
tournament.

2268
02:29:44,540 --> 02:29:46,060
And I was taught to be better.

2269
02:29:46,060 --> 02:29:47,540
He's not Apex Legends.

2270
02:29:47,980 --> 02:29:49,360
Nope, but it's competitive.

2271
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:53,960
Sure.

2272
02:29:55,800 --> 02:29:58,320
Are you trying to say fighting games are not competitive?

2273
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:00,760
No, I think Street Fighter's competitive, yeah.

2274
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:01,320
Yeah, okay.

2275
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:02,040
What about Tekken?

2276
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:04,100
Yeah, yeah.

2277
02:30:05,380 --> 02:30:07,360
You don't think Tekken's competitive.

2278
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:09,720
Yeah, yeah, no, no.

2279
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:10,920
That's fucked up.

2280
02:30:10,980 --> 02:30:12,380
Guys, he doesn't think Tekken's competitive.

2281
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,400
That's fucked up.

2282
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:16,800
I think whatever game you play is just not competitive.

2283
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:18,180
So I play Apex.

2284
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:19,920
Exactly.

2285
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:21,860
So Apex is not competitive.

2286
02:30:22,220 --> 02:30:25,080
So your achievements don't count because Apex isn't
competitive.

2287
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:27,240
No, when I played was competitive.

2288
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:28,260
Now it's just us.

2289
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:30,300
Now it's just us.

2290
02:30:31,180 --> 02:30:36,240
You think this game is competitive?

2291
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:39,480
Like this game is the most RNG bullshit on the planet.

2292
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:43,440
Like it's probably the least competitive.

2293
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:44,180
Like it's a VR.

2294
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:47,600
When you used to play it, it was even more RNG than before.

2295
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:49,080
No, no, no.

2296
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:51,420
It was less RNG because there was no aim assist involved.

2297
02:30:51,860 --> 02:30:53,340
It actually took skill to shoot people.

2298
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:54,400
Okay, we have to go again.

2299
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:55,420
Okay.

2300
02:30:55,780 --> 02:30:57,200
Oh, my God, we got zone.

2301
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:58,060
I'm going to cry.

2302
02:30:58,700 --> 02:30:59,000
Yeah.

2303
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:00,760
I don't want zone.

2304
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,860
I thought we were going to run at people.

2305
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:03,880
What happened?

2306
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:06,000
We can't run at people if you have zone.

2307
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:07,860
Like, why do we keep giving a zone?

2308
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:09,040
No!

2309
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:11,100
What is wrong with them?

2310
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:14,460
I don't want to keep making me.

2311
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:28,120
in zone it's scary i need any game that allows an ai
computer to aim for you is not a competitive game maybe in a

2312
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:36,840
mixed in a mixed input environment better than a controller
player just use your movement i mean if i install in but i

2313
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:41,420
got that why do you say ditto i'm gonna go gap though okay

2314
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:52,360
i need to open this red bin there's people over there on the
left already we just people are shooting already wait people

2315
02:31:52,360 --> 02:32:02,800
are shooting people are literally shooting each other and
going to zone now yes let's go let's go up top i mean oh my

2316
02:32:02,800 --> 02:32:11,000
god this is so sad we don't get loot we don't get evos they
just cucked us why do we get zone because they hate zone

2317
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:15,220
they hate us too stupid

2318
02:32:18,340 --> 02:32:25,360
i can't do anything with this like three in times and out of
six games i think i think kura is literally just grieving us

2319
02:32:25,360 --> 02:32:33,680
on purpose like displacing these zones around our fucking
forehead they're fighting kind of which way just poking 100

2320
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:37,540
not gonna fight they were fighting earlier I saw them.

2321
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:39,320
It's this team and this team.

2322
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:40,840
They're smoking and, like, poking.

2323
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:41,560
Oh, there's needs.

Oh, look.

2410
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:38,980
They're flying.

2411
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:41,380
I'm looking.

2412
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:42,680
Are you coming?

2413
02:39:42,840 --> 02:39:44,140
Are you going back to the...

2414
02:39:45,960 --> 02:39:46,940
I'm going to go back to the key.

2415
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:48,200
I'll let you...

2416
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:48,480
There's a lot.

2417
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:49,480
Lotty here.

2418
02:39:50,300 --> 02:39:50,820
Yeah, there's two teams.

2419
02:39:52,460 --> 02:39:53,800
Red armor on my left.

2420
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:55,760
Dito, watch for me.

2421
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:57,200
Okay, okay, okay.

2422
02:39:59,060 --> 02:40:00,200
Okay, okay, okay.

2423
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:01,340
That's a whole team game.

2424
02:40:01,620 --> 02:40:03,260
I don't have heavy ammo.

2425
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:05,300
I need more ammo either.

2426
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:06,760
I'm gonna change.

2427
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:08,720
There's a lot of light ammo here.

2428
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:10,440
There's three men team is here, right?

2429
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:12,200
Oh, they're fighting each other.

2430
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:13,640
They got two knocks.

2431
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:15,020
I saw two knocks.

2432
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:16,660
I knocked one.

2433
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:18,720
Oh, there.

2434
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:21,460
Tank, I'm past playing it.

2435
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:22,940
Flash, flash, flash it on Lifeline.

2436
02:40:23,140 --> 02:40:24,080
No, no, focus this team.

2437
02:40:24,140 --> 02:40:25,340
This team is like two down, I think.

2438
02:40:25,660 --> 02:40:27,100
I think they're full dead, aren't they?

2439
02:40:27,780 --> 02:40:28,540
No, no, no, they're not.

2440
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:28,900
They're not.

2441
02:40:28,900 --> 02:40:29,120
They're not.

2442
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:30,360
Because I knocked on it and didn't get the kill.

2443
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:31,580
He's right below me here.

2444
02:40:32,140 --> 02:40:32,140
Okay.

2445
02:40:32,420 --> 02:40:32,740
Last guy.

2446
02:40:32,860 --> 02:40:33,260
Yeah, scan.

2447
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:33,760
Yes, scan.

2448
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:35,940
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna scan, scan.

2449
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:38,920
I'm gonna cover you from this team, but I need energy ammo.

2450
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:41,280
It's just this guy down here.

2451
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:43,420
Do you need help?

2452
02:40:43,640 --> 02:40:44,000
Do you need help?

2453
02:40:45,560 --> 02:40:47,060
No, this guy's just running.

2454
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:49,180
I want to find... Is there energy ammo?

2455
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:49,760
Oh, wait.

2456
02:40:49,820 --> 02:40:50,840
There might be people below us.

2457
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:51,800
I don't want to risk it.

2458
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:55,580
This botan is here solo.

2459
02:40:55,660 --> 02:40:56,880
His teammates are still crawling.

2460
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:00,760
There's, I hear there's a point.

2461
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:01,980
Oh there, oh there.

2462
02:41:03,580 --> 02:41:05,180
We don't want one team.

2463
02:41:05,320 --> 02:41:06,100
We don't want one team.

2464
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:07,000
Careful, careful.

2465
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:09,960
I don't have energy ammo anymore, so I need a chill.

2466
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:11,640
I want one team.

2467
02:41:11,720 --> 02:41:12,900

2468
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:14,660
Okay, thank you.

2469
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:16,980

2470
02:41:17,100 --> 02:41:18,420
Like, he's still just crawling.

2471

I don't want to waste ammo, so I'm just...

2524
02:44:30,350 --> 02:44:31,530
But they're crafting here.

2525
02:44:31,590 --> 02:44:32,370
They dropped to the left.

2526
02:44:34,130 --> 02:44:34,870
They dropped to the left.

2527
02:44:36,310 --> 02:44:37,850
Okay, so they're not coming for us.

2528
02:44:38,230 --> 02:44:38,550
No.

2529
02:44:43,970 --> 02:44:45,310
This buffering is 70.

02:44:45,930 --> 02:44:47,070
Wow, I'm getting maggot drill.

2532
02:44:54,210 --> 02:44:55,170
Isn't that crazy?

2533
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:57,810

What a thought.

02:45:00,830 --> 02:45:03,250
That the pro team isn't killing everybody.

2537
02:45:03,790 --> 02:45:04,190
What a thought.

2538
02:45:04,810 --> 02:45:05,630
But that's how it works.

2539
02:45:07,210 --> 02:45:08,970

Yeah, wasn't even trying.

2640
02:52:55,140 --> 02:52:56,660
Team Slightly Manhara.

2641
02:52:56,960 --> 02:52:58,020
We're going crazy.

2642
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:03,220
Teams, not slightly anymore here, Manhara.

2643
02:53:03,300 --> 02:53:06,380
Anyway, TSM is going to suspend this.

2644
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:15,320
and i uh deaths and i are gonna look for a new igl uh we
figured if you guys wanna if you guys wanna um make some

2645
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:22,080
like fun art of like us like disbanding like i'm gonna go to
dark zero from now on so this is gonna be our last

2646
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:30,620
tournament yeah like this is um hero rpr's last tournament
as tsm we are disbanding now because uh ditto and i got

2647
02:53:30,620 --> 02:53:39,160
better so we're not minhara anymore so he has to go to guys
want to memorize this moment for the end of eternity you

2648
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:46,000
guys can make some fun out if you want uh but just know that
i'm believing because i just need a better environment than

2649
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:52,140
this environment this one is too toxic for me and i just
don't think we can win like this so i'm i just gotta do

2650
02:53:52,140 --> 02:53:58,620
what's better for my career and i think moving to dark zero
is actually gonna give me a chance to win from now onwards

2651
02:53:58,620 --> 02:54:12,920
and like we think as tsm the last two members in tsm we
believe that like imperial rpr was uh was was too much of an

2652
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:21,940
anchor uh so we will be trailing new igl starting next week
yeah and also as an igl i just can't believe that i'm igl

2653
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:29,580
and i'm also outputting more damage than ver holst and reps
together like they all put 7 000 damage together and i 8 000

2654
02:54:29,580 --> 02:54:39,140
damage like this is insane like this is why i need better
teams that's why i need gen tired of igl i just want to frag

2655
02:54:39,140 --> 02:54:45,120
out because i really have the talent for it and i just want
to go to like an igl just tell me what to do and i got

2656
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:52,340
teammates that do a ton of damage because my team just
doesn't do you are i do you do a lot of damage because you

2657
02:54:52,340 --> 02:55:01,040
are igl because you know when to shoot exactly we don't know
and if if we didn't um listen to your order and if if we

2658
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:09,460
shoot you are gonna mad at us yeah yeah you guys are not
shooting enough anyway because how do you guys never have

2659
02:55:09,460 --> 02:55:18,040
how do you never have ammo but do no damage you don't tell
you ask you ask you ask you're taking your ammo yeah you're

2660
02:55:18,040 --> 02:55:26,960
taking your ammo you guys never have ammo you're always
yelling for light ammo so i don't have light ammo anymore

2661
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:34,580
now listen this is the guys you guys can see what of TSM is
right here right now it's a toxic environment and I think

2662
02:55:34,580 --> 02:55:38,000
this is just a better environment for me where I can really
shine as a player

2663
