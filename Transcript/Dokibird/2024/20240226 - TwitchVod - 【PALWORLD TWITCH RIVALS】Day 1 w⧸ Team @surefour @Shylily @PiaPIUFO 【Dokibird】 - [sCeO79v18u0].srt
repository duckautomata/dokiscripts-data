1
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,120
Unmute!

2
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,460

Okay, we were actually discussing strats because we finally
got the achievements and everything.

Now we know what we have to do.

11
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,720
So I guess like a small introduction of all of us.

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,260

How dare you.

33
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,580
It's three against one.

34
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,240
I know, right?

35
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,440

37
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,820
You said three versus one.

38
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,720
I got hands.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,060
Shy Lily has hands.

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,860

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
None of you are freaking real.

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
None of you are freaking real.

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,980
None of you are real.

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,920
You can't hurt me.

46
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,940
How do you know if you're real?

47
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:58,940

00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,400
But I...

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,240

00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,640
Oh, yeah.

55
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,180
Nice immersion break saying you have a webcam.

56
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,820
Maybe I just put it on my feet, man.

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,220
Oh, that's some cryo stuff right there.

58

75
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,420
Hello, Lily.

76
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,100
Understandable.

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,800

No, of course.

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,840
Don't tell them!

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,080
Don't tell them!

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,400

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320

104
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:34,660
match gritty but anyway so we're while we were muted we were
discussing about our the achievements so we're discussing

105
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:45,700
things before then yeah which was very relevant to our
stream right guys relevant to mine i like the achievement i

106
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,860
don't know if my mods like made a command for it but
basically sure for is going to be our power leveler and then

107
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:05,600
that's their strats basically that's how we decided that's
the strats sick so we have a power leveler yeah and then we

108
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,980
got this we got this far we got this far anyway we so are we
doing were we doing a global achievements like for day two

109
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:19,740
right for the extra multiplier i think we just do whatever
we can do yeah pretty much just do can do i think like

110
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,860
keeping track of who's caught what is going to like waste
time so i guess just kind of just do whatever we'll kind of

111
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,800
collect whatever we've done at the only time we need to do
stuff together is for the group achievements yeah we'll be

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,920
there for that the group one was like take a team photo in
the wildlife sanctuary and then with the reincarnated guy

113
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:45,000
and then we have to compete in the ravine grotto dungeon as
well as a mountain stream grotto where the fuck is either of

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,580
those yeah i was gonna say where the are these places no
idea you're the one that linked interactive

115
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:15,080
map i don't i want the what map sorry if there was a map you
should probably hide all the things and then just pick and

116
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,680
choose what you'd want to show up on it.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Sorry.

118
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,140
I mean, the PAL world map, but sorry.

119
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,540
Oh, yeah, the official in-game PAL world map.

120
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,640
Yeah, official in-game map.

121
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,900
Sorry, guys.

122
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,320
How can you use that when it's hidden until you've explored
it?

123
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,400
What?

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,600
Whoa!

125
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,620
Where we just explore everything.

126
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,640
Yeah, as long as we explore everything, it'll be fine,
right?

127
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:39,820
Yeah.

128
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,900
It'll be okay.

129
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,760
We can be fine.

130
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:52,320
figure this out right we're not exploiting anything we
barely know how to play this game let alone exploit it like

131
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,920
so i think how it's gonna work with the base is that if i'm
gonna have you doing power leveling then i'm probably just

132
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,200
gonna work on resource management and just checking in on
where stuff is and in the meantime just trying to level

133
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:15,360
myself okay and then lily and i were just exist you know
just next to it yeah i'll do the level up the chicky pea to

134
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,560
level 30 i'll work on that i'll i'll only use a chicky pea
to fight good freaking job yeah i'm gonna put a face by the

135
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:32,080
desolate church where they've got the uh the ingot like vein
all right wait who wants to catch five humans who wants to

136
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,560
who wants to do that No, you're in base duty.

137
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,040
You're the only one that knows what to do.

138
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:39,860
Raiders show up.

139
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,200
That's where all the buff men show up, right?

140
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,120
That's true.

141
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,940
Yeah, you can do the...

142
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,640
All right, and you can cook the meat, too, because that's
the base thing, too.

143
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,480
I...

144
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,320
How many steaks do I have to cook?

145
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,800
Just one.

146
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,500
Just go...

147
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,960
Yeah, the Mamma arrest steak.

148
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,000
How the fuck?

149
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,480
So, who...

150
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,780
Oh, Mamma arrest steak.

151
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,440
Okay, I think, like, Cherfor needs to...

152
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,700
Cherfor is the one that needs to fucking kill a Mamma arrest
for us.

153
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,160
You're the power level!

154
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,440
You're gonna be the closest...

155
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:14,280
to catching one it's chill it's chill i'm being forced to do
so many things what do you mean wait when they say level

156
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,600
level 100 to level 30 did they mean from one or do they just
mean like have a chickpea and it'd be level 30.

157
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,720
no it says level up a chickpea to level 30.

158
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:30,040
i mean you can probably catch like a level 29 chickpea yeah
up once yeah that's yeah that's yeah but like i feel like by

159
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,180
the time we find a level 29 like i think we should just
level it up by that time

160
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,440
There's like global one was like make a clip where all
teammates are petting different pals of the same element

161
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,640
Does that be like all of us pat all of us petting like water
type or like one of us typing petting water type?

162
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,600
I didn't even fucking pay attention to the global ones.

163
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,080
Oh shit.

164
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,800
There's like breeding as well the new bis and the Oh
Dyermope with three.

165
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,440
I don't know how the breeding things were I mean I didn't
really get into breeding.

166
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:11,100
Oh, hey if he each person like the amount of pals we catch
is points per person too.

167
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

168
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,380
Oh my God, one of them is the dire wolf with three move
speed passives.

169
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,060
I had that.

170
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,260
That's just fast as fuck.

171
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:25,400
So I guess, I guess for the first, for the first hour, I
guess all we should really do is like catch, catch, catch,

172
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:34,320
and like try to move towards where the base is gonna be,
which is like, if you have a mental map, it's gonna be like

173
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,920
in the red area.

174
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:44,420
I don't know where The red area towards the tip of one of
those arrows I'm pretty sure it's like towards the south end

175
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:55,860
of the red and yellow area Alright So basically I don't know
where the fuck That is So I'm just gonna It's by the

176
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,440
desolate church It's too bad they don't have a search
function On the map Yeah it's too bad we're gonna just

177
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:10,800
Explore that together So we find it right Yeah yeah for sure
for sure also to my chat is everybody sounding okay or is

184
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:23,880
background noise if i do like i have no my my setup is super
scuffed and like my setup is super like beginner streamer

185
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:34,620
wait how long have you been streaming a couple years wait
wait what's your graphics card that's it's it's in there

186
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:45,300
it's in graphics card all streamers are lazy it's a it's
something in there somewhere only do things when they have

187
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:53,860
to that's true the moment when her pc dies when she upgrades
i wouldn't be surprised she's still using a 60 hertz monitor

188
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:01,520
are you using a 60 hertz monitor no no it's 60 hertz monitor
mouse acceleration on what's the dpi it's surely more than

189
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:10,160
that it's surely how when was the last time you bought a
monitor upgrade have you ever actively gone to your monitor

190
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:23,240
settings and then change your refresh rates yourself okay so
you're not 60 hertz i'm not bad at any FPS games, I just

191
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
have a 60 Hertz monitor.

192
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,460
It's not my fault.

193
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,060
I'm actually, yeah, it's not like...

194
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,040
Well, so the thing with 60 Hertz is you're living in
blissful ignorance until you realize.

195
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,080
Yeah, that is so true.

196
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,040
Until you see the light, then you can never go back.

197
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,600
Once you see the light, you get blinded by God and you can't
go back.

198
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,500
I'm not sure if I want God to flash me, to be honest.

199
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,180
Well, it's like a really good flash.

200
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,220
Yeah, it's like a flash that's in your memory forever.

201
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
and you can never- Just one time, and then you're gone
forever!

202
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,880
Yeah, and then you can never go back.

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,040
You're like, if anybody else flashes me, it won't be the
same.

204
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,360
It's true, though.

205
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,160
My friend is like a pro Valorant player, and they came over
to my house when they were visiting, and they wanted to use

206
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,400
my computer!

207
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,100
And they flashed you?

208
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,440
No!

209
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:15,460
No, they turned on my stupid monitor, and they were like,
wait, is this 60 hertz?

210
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,100
And I was like, yeah.

211
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,900
And they had gone, like, two weeks without?

212
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,360
And they were like, what's another two weeks?

213
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,540
And then they just walked away.

214
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,660
I was like, are you kidding me?

215
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,620
What?

216
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,260
You're fucking kidding me D&D.

217
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,340
Well...

218
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,360
It's that bad, huh?

219
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,020
Check your herself.

220
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,240
Check your hurts right now.

221
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,120
Go to your monitor, go to your monitor desktop, do display
settings.

222
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,640
Wait wait, wait.

223
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,240
Right click on your desktop.

224
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:38,620
Yeah.

225
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,200
Right click and then do display settings.

226
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,080
Yeah.

227
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,500
And then...

228
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,600
And then I forgot what to do next.

229
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,020
Okay.

230
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,280
And then scroll down until you see advanced display
settings.

231
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,380
Advanced display.

232
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,680
Yeah.

233
00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:06,180
your moderate what is the refresh rate it says 60 called it
called it now go to your refresh rate and see if you can

234
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:19,700
change it wait what should i take i was like what are your
options 60 it doesn't matter also i it could 120 143 you had

235
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:32,980
140 like a legit monitor then yeah yeah so what happened is
shyly we probably bought the monitor is like 6 144 hertz see

236
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:48,340
now you have no excuse for your fps playing oh everything's
on dark help oh we broke it oh wow whoa i see no difference

237
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:58,480
there's no way you see no difference she's not even any game
yet of course you can see it with the mouse cursor what's

238
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,780
different on my mouse cursor wait it's more smoother yeah
because it's not 60 frames it has more it has more hurts

239
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:15,380
whoa that's why i hate 3d cartoons man you're never gonna
get me with that but you and i can only see 30 fps i can't i

240
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,580
hate that comment so much you're like why are you always
complaining about frames we can only see 30 frames for a

241
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:31,600
second Dog logic All right, they're apparently checking
settings now Sure for you, I'd show that to people Don't

242
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,000
worry, team captain I've already been on it Whoa, you gotta
remember, scroll slowly So we can verify all settings all

243
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,140
the time Just scrolling up and down because they don't know
If they're looking or not

244
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:55,440
Alright, here we go I can't wait to start this This Pal
World adventure with all of you I can't wait to be dead,

245
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,000
Wade.

246
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,100
Me too.

247
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,680
Dude, I played so much, but I played so casual.

248
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,220
You know, like when you play Animal Crossing and you're
like, this is nice and you go visit your friend's island and

249
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,140
it's just like fully terraformed and you're like, Wade, what
the fuck?

250
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,820
Okay, what's he gonna do that?

251
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,380
Is this a bad time to admit that the PAL World Building Base
Building contest was mostly based on aesthetic?

252
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,680
Yes, because I saw you won a competition and I was like, you
know, know what this person seems to know what they're doing

253
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,480
someone lied on their resume when i was looking for players

254
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,760
when you show up to your job and you don't know what you're
doing oh my god i came with the confidence the confidence of

255
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,760
a of a guy uh like a 30 year old white guy and then you like
and then and then she had all these vouchers underneath and

256
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,920
i'm like you know what people are vouching Surely she knows
what the fuck she's doing people are vouching for her like

257
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:04,860
she knows surely I do I do I do but I'll also make it look
nice All right, so we don't care there's no points in

258
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:15,960
whether or not it looks nice There's no there's no Which
face has the most aesthetic there's no which face has the

259
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:23,700
most aesthetic face They should have that they they should
though we should ask them the Make a rule just for us.

260
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,460
Put that in there.

261
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,140
Just for us.

262
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,940
I like how some of my chat, when people attack the base,
they'll be in awe of how nice it looks.

263
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,900
Exactly.

264
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,760
They're like, whoa, this looks nice.

265
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,560
What the fuck?

266
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,460
They're like, oh my god, we can't attack that base.

267
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,720
Oh my god, look at how much work they put into it.

268
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,400
Wow.

269
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,740
Wow.

270
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,280
See?

271
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,180
Yeah.

272
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,540
You get it.

273
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:46,880
See?

274
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,580
We understand.

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,300
We just get it.

276
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,160
Alright, let's see.

277
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,300
Are they- I think they haven't even checked us yet, please.

278
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,700
Please.

279
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,320
We just want to join the survey.

280
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:01,980
Did they come in here?

281
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,740
Did they just randomly come in my stream?

282
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,520
I think they just look at your stream because it says just
scroll up and down until it happens.

283
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,180
Until it happens.

284
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:12,980
Until it happens.

285
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,360
Just get it waiting out until it happens.

286
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,780
Bro, I'm all tabbed right now until they tell me something.

287
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,160
We're voice number six.

288
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,120
How long does it take to get to six?

289
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
Yeah, you said this would be fast, huh, first time?

290
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,920
First time.

291
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,640
Oh my god, please, we just want to play PAL world.

292
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,240
Let us in.

293
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,280
Let us in.

294
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,380
Oh my, they should give us names for creative pet names,
too.

295
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,360
By the way, some PALs at the beginning that will be really,
really useful.

296
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,240
If somebody can get that, like, Tombat cat thing, that would
be really, really helpful.

297
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,620
Oh, yeah.

298
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,940
If you can bring that to our base, uh that would be really
great okay why am i going to point it out again because

299
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:03,040
you're power leveling it spawns it spawns at night in like
the starter area but like mostly like towards like the

300
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:10,440
bottom of this one hill you see this is exactly why i got
you you already know where people spawn i already played

301
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:19,740
like three days of power world when it first launched and
then i was done i i have a hundred twenty hours in the game

302
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,900
but i also let my chat backseat a lot so I mean, that's the
point.

303
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
That's the point of streaming.

304
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,380
Why the fuck do you do it for yourself when you can just
have them backseat?

305
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,080
Why won't they verify me?

306
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,800
Dang, you sound so desperate.

307
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,300
Stop trying to get verified, Zart.

308
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
It's kind of cringe.

309
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,900
I'm so fucking lonely.

310
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,680
I just want the touch of an admin.

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,860

rap.

347
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,500
I'm customizing my character real quick.

348
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,440

351
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,440
My Discord crashed.

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:14,960
No!

353
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,320
New down.

354
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,220
Bye, Discord.

355
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,980
Okay, I need to make a new browser, apparently.

356
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,440
Since my Discord crashed.

357
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,080
Don't worry.

358
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,180
It should be fine, right?

359
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,040
No, it's not fine.

360
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,360
Fine.

361
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,020
Okay.

362
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,280
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

363
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,320
I- Oh my god, why are you not showing up on Discord?

364
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,340
What?

365
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,920
I think we need the IP address and then a password or
something.

366
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,680
I don't leak my RP.

367
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:43,640
Well.

368
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
No, three minutes.

369
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,540
Three minutes until the timer starts!

370
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,680
Team Doki Bird is over.

371
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,560
Where do I get the code?

372
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Well, I don't fucking...

373
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,020
Google it.

374
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,620
I don't fucking know.

375
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,280
Google it.

376
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,040
Check the invite code for this world on the option screen
after start.

377
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,880
starting the game.

378
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:57,820
Okay.

379
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,260
Okay.

380
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,140
We only got three minutes!

381
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,780
One.

382
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:03,720
Two.

383
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Calm down.

384
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,380
Counts down from 180.

385
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,900
Nah, it's chill.

386
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,460
I think a minute isn't going to make much of a difference
anyway.

387
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,600
We're going to get okay.

388
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,000
A minute is a pretty long time.

389
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,380
Yeah.

390
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,120
What the fuck are you talking about?

391
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,760
It makes all the difference.

392
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,260
This is a serious update.

393
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,720

00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,190
No.

413
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,370
We're stuck in our cages.

414
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,130
We're gonna be fine.

415
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,810
So many constraints.

00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,210

491
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,430
Valid-based drill.

492
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,330
Preach.

493
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,510
I need more stone.

494
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,070
Oh, crap.

495
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:28,530
Nice.

496
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,850
I can catch a chicken now.

497
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:30,890
All right, where's my chicken?

498
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:31,910
I'll take on.

499
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,890
The chicken's going to be my only pal.

500
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,290
I don't even know if the game volume is, like, okay.

501
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,010
Just a team of chickens.

502
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,690
I'm sure it's fine.

503
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,710
I'm sure it's fine.

504
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,590
I need to make my pickaxe.

505
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,190
All right, there we go.

506
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,450
Why the fuck is there another fucking...

507
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,010
Oh, shit.

508
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,710
I'm the stamina.

509
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,050
Also, don't forget to get wool.

510
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,150
Otherwise, you're going to freeze to death at night.

511
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,750
So kill some of the little sheep.

512
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,650
Nice.

513
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,310
I'm trying to remember how to throw a pal spear.

514
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,570
Murder is wrong.

515
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,950
Murder is wrong from our pal leveler?

516
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,810
That's a problem.

517
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,070
That's a problem right there.

518
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,290
I don't kill, I capture.

519
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,010
You're capture humanely?

520
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,390
Yeah.

521
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,590
Ethically.

522
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,370
Is it an ethical capture?

523
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,470
How do you know it's ethical?

524
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,110
Is it free range?

525
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,410
Yes, it's free range.

526
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:31,190
One of the global events is we have to get 20 humans and put
them in the viewing cage oh yeah oh wow that's neat i love

527
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:44,570
that yeah and he went to catch like five of them earlier too
oh my god my chicken is level five all right let me one of

528
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:52,230
some free points are just flying around and getting max a
lift monk energy whatever those things are oh shit i mean i

529
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,270
could do that Otherwise, Lymphmonk is not a goal.

530
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,550
There's like 400 of them on the map.

531
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,470
It's a global goal.

532
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,050
It's a global.

533
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,690
So do we have to catch all of them?

534
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,330
You get like 150 points.

535
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,210
Oh, okay.

536
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,450
Oh, we have to get to level 10.

537
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,290
Okay, per person.

538
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,650
Oh, so all of us has to do it technically.

539
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,650
I mean, the gods would be able to help with it, but I don't
know.

540
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,590
Yeah, yeah, the gods.

541
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,230
The gods.

542
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:13,890
Yeah.

543
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:21,130
But I can tell you, I got to level 10 doing that, and it
took me like 10 hours.

544
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,970
Yeah, yeah, we could totally do that in like eight hours You
just get a flying you just get a flying pet and then fly

545
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:39,730
around you have to max it up My little chicken go do their
job Oh my god, there's a chicken rolling down No, don't get

546
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,410
distracted by treasure.

547
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,350
Why do I always do this?

548
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,350
All right, go treasure.

549
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,310
I don't even know are we are we doing okay?

550
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:53,510
I can't even tell Yeah, we're doing great right are we are
we doing okay guys the first the first hour The first hour

551
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,590
is, like, gonna kind of be a little rough.

552
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:56,370
It's okay.

553
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,010
I still have my chicken here having a great time.

554
00:35:59,550 --> 00:35:59,830
We're good.

555
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,150
We're good.

556
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,790
Yeah, I can tell it's having a good time.

557
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,470
I can see its health dwindling, yeah.

558
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,230
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,670
No, it's he's like...

560
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,330
Minus 20.

561
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:07,670
Minus 20.

562
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,510
He's doing great.

563
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,250
He's doing great.

564
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:09,750
Yeah.

565
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,990
Oh, I'm gonna get the gum rush so we can have seeds.

566
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,730
So we can plant.

567
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,810
But, God, there's so many just dead animals on the ground as
I'm walking.

568
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,650
They all, like, spawn next to us, which is great.

569
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,870
Get over here.

570
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,070
Wait, where is our base gonna be again?

571
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,910
Our base is gonna be...

572
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,590
Keep walking.

573
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,910
Do you see the tower in the distance?

574
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,890
You're gonna walk towards that, and then you're gonna, like,
turn left.

575
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:35,770
Okay.

576
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:36,970
I see it.

577
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,810
Get over here.

578
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,210
Oh my god, get the fuck over here.

579
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,030
There you go.

580
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,570
Everything will be fine.

581
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:48,770
Yay!

582
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:52,690

That's mine.

586
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,270
You get all the stuff back.

Yeah, this is why you're on my team This is why you this is
why you matter.

You are an asset to this company See parents you were wrong

Go, chicken, go.

That's fine.

597
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,810

Well, that's right.

610
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,770
If you go to your party, you can name them.

611
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:03,790
Oh!

612
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,590
Okay.

613
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,190

Oh, I name it.

615
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,010
Where the fuck is it?

616
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,810
I just go this way?

617
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,850
Can I just go this way?

618
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,190
Where the fuck are you naming?

619
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,130
Maybe I can just go this way.

620
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,970
Also, there's an egg.

621
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,210
Oh, yeah.

622
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:21,870
Pick up eggs.

623
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,450
I just picked up.

624
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,510
Yeah, I picked one up.

625
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,310
Oh, there it is.

626
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,710
That's the best way to get good pals without being in a
high-level area.

627
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,910
Okay.

628
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,070
Nice.

629
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,470
If you don't have space, just get rid of the small ones
before you get rid of the big ones.

630
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:40,690
Don't worry.

631
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,710
I have so much space right now.

632
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,090
Oh, my God.

633
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,930
There's so many dead pals here.

634
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,070
I wonder who did that.

635
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:48,930
Who did that?

636
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,550
Who did that?

637
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,890
That's crazy.

638
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,750
Holy shit.

639
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,890
I wonder who...

640
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:54,130
What the...

641
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,590
Everywhere I go, I see dead pals.

642
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,970
You know, like, the official, like, Power World YouTube
channel posted that short about, like, cooking lambels?

643
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,310
Yes!

644
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,070
I saw it.

645
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,690
I was like, ah!

646
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,210
What's so curious?

647
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,050
Like, the creator does, like, Pokemon versions, too.

648
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,250
Oh, my guys, watch the Pokemon versions are, like, more
fucked up.

649
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:21,290
Like, I love how, like, Power World people are like, yeah,
we want them to make something for us.

650
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,990
Yeah, me, me, me!

651
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,630
Nintendo, this is what we've been asking for.

652
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,330
All these years.

653
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,670
Nintendo would never...

654
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,530
We don't want to make normal sandwiches.

655
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,570
I want to make Pokemon sandwiches.

656
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,410
Oh, me too.

657
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,290
What would be the most tastiest Pokemon sandwich, though?

658
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:42,610
Oh.

659
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,290
Okay, what's the wag you of Pokemon?

660
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,290
Isn't there like a cow Pokemon?

661
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,050
Milk tank?

662
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:51,550
I don't think...

663
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,570
Yeah, Taurus, Taurus.

664
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,230
No, Taurus would be...

665
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,270
But he would be chewy.

666
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,590
He's got too much muscle.

667
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:56,990
Taurus?

668
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,550
I bet Ditto tastes like jam.

669
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,870
Oh, yeah.

670
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,510
I feel like legendary...

671
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,270
I can't agree to that.

672
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:08,850
I feel like legendary Pokemon would be like the most juicy
because they're like aged really well, too.

673
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,070
No, no, because like, you know how like the older they are,
the more aged they are.

674
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,310
It's about the marbling.

675
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,450
It's about the marbling.

676
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:15,890
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:20,650
But wouldn't like legendary Pokemon have like really good
marbling if you think about it?

678
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,630
Since they're legendary.

679
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,850
You got to think about the one with the most like fat on it.

680
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,750
would be the most delicious one?

681
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,750
No, because then there's also slow poke.

682
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:30,350
Snorlax!

683
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,230
No, Snorlax!

684
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,350
Tail is good, right?

685
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,230
Oh, Snorlax!

686
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,570
He doesn't move!

687
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:35,770
I mean, he's like...

688
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,710
But then it's mostly fat, though.

689
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,710
He's so tasty.

690
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,310
But wouldn't it mostly be fat?

691
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,090
It's going to be hard to get lean meat from Snorlax.

692
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:44,870
Oh, yeah.

693
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,290
Maybe you can combine Pokemon.

694
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,730
You can use his fat to, like, fry another Pokemon.

695
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,730
Oh, Truid.

696
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,430
Like, use his fat to make bacon.

697
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,590
If you think about it.

698
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,350
Yeah.

699
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,650
What is the bacon of the bacon of Pokemon?

700
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,830
Uh, the little pig, the little fried pig.

701
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,770
He can fry himself, too, because he's firetight.

702
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:03,930
T-Pig?

703
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,510
Oh, T-Pig!

704
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,590
But they're hard to breed.

705
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,590
Yeah, you don't need to...

706
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,510
I mean...

707
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,810
They're, like, too rare to be the bacon of Pokemon.

708
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,030
What's, like...

709
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:21,810
Depends on whether you have Nintendo Online, because if you
have a Nintendo Online, then every time you go to the

710
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,770
mystery trade, all you're going to get is...

711
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:32,930
and no online someone says you free to play or pay to play

I'm heading over to our base.

718
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,210
Okay, building it now.

719
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,370
You should be able to fast travel once I finish it in five
seconds.

720
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,650
Oh, oh yeah, fast travel.

721
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,770
I almost forgot.

722
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,190
I'm just gonna head to the...

723
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,910
Alright, it's set.

724
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,270
Alright, build a wooden chest and deploy a pal.

725
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:23,690
Okay, so I have a human.

726
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,190
Wait, you caught one already?

727
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:26,610
Nice!

728
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:27,850
Oh my god!

729
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,770
Nice, we just need 19 more.

730
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,530
We need to build our little- No, but four of them have to be
level 10.

731
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,090
Oh, but I guess we could par level them to be level 10.

732
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,830
Do we have to catch them- We need to build our little
prison.

733
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,030
Do we have to catch them at level 10, or do we have to par-
Like, do they just have to be level 10?

734
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:46,970
I don't remember.

735
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,510
You could just level them up, sure.

736
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,470
How are they gonna know?

737
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,510
How are they gonna know?

738
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,930
Uh, watching our streams?

739
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,510
No, what's the point?

740
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:05,490
bullshit No way they watch this I did not consent to be
tracked I didn't accept the cookies Yeah we didn't consent

trying to tell me?

742
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:17,190
It's an invasion of my privacy Watching us right now that's
fucking illegal

743
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:27,930
Oh I should grab some iron I we're Base level 2.

00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,330
Shady bed, primitive workbench.

745
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,910
Oh no, my weapon!

746
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,250
I have a damaged weapon.

747
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,810
Do we have a repair shop and the base?

748
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:38,830
I'm about to build it.

749
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:39,470
Not yet, though.

750
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,170
What do you mean by shop?

751
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,870
Someone just asked me how I get rid of being wanted without
dying.

752
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,090
I don't know, just don't even witness, man.

753
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,390
Just don't look.

754
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,630
It's that easy.

755
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,090
Close your eyes.

756
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,070
And tell me about how much you're wanted.

757
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,290
That's kind of cringe, bro.

758
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:03,790

I need more wood.

770
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,070
If anybody has an abundance of wood, if you can bring back
the base, that'd be great.

771
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,490
I can bring some back.

772
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,030

Yeah, but they're cute, though.

781
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:55,950

The piggies.

797
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:12,130
Shit.

798
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,530
Let's see...

799
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,930
Repair bench...

800
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,230
Are you making repair bench or am I making the repair bench?

801
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,790
I can make it just one second.

802
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,310
Okay, JK, I made it.

803
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:22,170
Okay.

804
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,330
That works too.

805
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,370
Here we go.

806
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:29,950
Nice.

807
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:34,390
Let me repair my fucking pickaxe.

808
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:36,470
Alright, I'll see.

809
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,150
Oh, wait, actually, I need to make clothes.

810
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,070
Because I'm still naked.

811
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,070
Oh, yeah, it isn't even nighttime.

812
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,070
And we're already at this point.

813
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,050
This is actually really good.

814
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,190
Making pretty good time.

815
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,410
I should not put this so close.

816
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,470
I forgot how finicky everything is.

817
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:53,550
Nah, burn it down.

818
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:53,990
It's all good.

819
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:56,330
down.

820
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,910
I mean, oh, I still need two cloths.

821
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:04,950
Do I make...

822
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,190
You should fast travel probably back to the start area.

823
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:12,670
That's the fastest way to get wool is to kill the lambs.

824
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,810
Yeah.

825
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:13,950
Until I can build a ranch.

826
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:14,830
Cloth.

827
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:15,690
No, it's cool.

828
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,170
I forgot you can make cloth with wool.

829
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,010
Nice.

830
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,470
Now I'm not making anymore.

831
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:25,490
Okay.

832
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:25,950
Okay.

833
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:31,770
Yay Yay, it's almost nighttime.

834
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:40,810

tombat.

836
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,370

00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,490
I have like the rush boar Oh, the rush boar is good for now.

838
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:51,550
Yeah, rush boar is nice.

00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,410
If we're not in America, how do all these other people get
guns?

874
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,170
All right.

875
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,250
Tell me where the closest fucking Walmart is.

876
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,290
I'll get a fucking pump.

877
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,050
You live in Central.

878
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,630
You know where the closest Walmart is.

879
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,210
I transfer that into Palworld.

880
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,910
Turn your webcam on.

881
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,590
While you go to Walmart.

882
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,190
There you go.

883
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,010
Easy.

884
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,050
I forgot we all have to catch some to get the...

885
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,130
What was it?

886
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,810
The extra points.

887
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,230
The registered points.

888
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,010
I think you can just drop...

889
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,190
Like, give Pal...

890
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,250

891
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:16,970
Oh my god!

892
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,050
Yeah, that's so smart!

893
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,130
You can't just put them in the base.

894
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:23,210
Yeah, and then we just pick it up and grab it as registered.

895
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:36,590
that's actually so smart yeah i don't have a tombad yet but
i have boar in box i'm gonna put i have duck yes take one

896
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,510
from the base that'll register in your thing but it doesn't
register as a first catch so you can still get the bonus exp

i'm only leveling stamina and carry weights all right i put

I got a new stat.

902
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,090
It finishes, but cannot acquire.

903
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:04,890
I'll put it in.

904
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:06,750
All right.

905
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,560
I need to make myself an outfit.

906
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,420
My motherfucker's gone bad.

907
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:16,700
I can't see.

908
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,720
It's so dark.

909
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,760
Yeah, I got the...

910
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,940
If you have the fire pal, it's really useful.

911
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:22,400
Oh, shit.

912
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:22,860
You're right.

913
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:23,540
Yeah.

914
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,380
You're so smart.

915
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,100
He lights up.

916
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,100
You gotta make a torch.

917
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,240
Dude, sometimes my brain cell has to corner and fall.

918
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,680
You just have your one big breakthrough.

919
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,300
I do shit myself in the process, but it's okay.

920
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,840
Awkward silence.

921
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:47,760
Ruminating.

922
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,480
It's so cute.

923
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,080
You matter.

924
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,000
Don't worry, Lily.

925
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,780
You matter.

926
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,200
Silence can be a beautiful thing.

927
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,120
Yeah, maybe I should just shut the fuck up sometimes.

928
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,180
Who knows?

929
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,840
Oh, wait, the presser can also mine.

930
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,400
I don't, I can't find tombads yet, but...

931
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,960
Okay, that's fine.

932
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,660
We'll find it eventually.

933
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,780
I'll just like invest a thing for now.

934
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:19,660

blue and purple, like, shiny elk looking thing, that thing

935
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,680

936
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:22,600
All right.

937
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,920
We're not at that point yet, though.

938
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,780
No rush.

939
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,800

940
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,640
Let's see.

941
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,540
Why do I want to go back to base?

942
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,960

I don't see any Tombat anywhere.

979
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,030
I saw a daydream.

980
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,650
It spawns near the second waypoint near the Mammal Forest.

981
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:18,630
Oh, okay.

982
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,810

00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:25,870
Back.

00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:28,490
Oh, yeah, rip.

986
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,910
Daytime.

987
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,730
We have a repair bench?

988
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:33,710
Yeah, it's at base.

989
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:36,410
Am I blind?

990
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:37,630
Maybe.

991
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:40,610
I guess so.

992
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:41,070
What the fuck?

993
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:42,770
It's okay.

994
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,670
We all have one blind spot.

995
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:46,430
I don't.

996
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,270
I am.

997
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,330
Oh yeah, sorry, you're perfect.

998
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:49,890
I'm perfect.

999
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,630
I can't fucking see.

1000
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:53,770
I'm pretty sure your chat can figure out something that
you're not perfect.

1001
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:54,690
Oh yeah, for sure.

1002
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:56,650
They're going to say everything.

1003
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:59,170
Yeah, do you think your chat's lying?

1004
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:00,630
Yes.

1005
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,910
I would say your chat's lying.

1006
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:04,570
They only want to see me in pain.

1007
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,230
And you're not cultivating a good chat.

1008
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,510
It's not like a YouTuber chat where everyone's super nice
and will die for you.

1009
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,930
Is that true, chat?

1010
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:13,650
Is that true?

1011
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:19,410
What kind of chat did you cultivate?

1012
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,670
I cultivated a base chat who's not afraid to say their
opinion.

1013
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:25,130
No.

1014
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,370
Wait, then their opinion is true then.

1015
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,290
Unless you guys...

1016
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,410
Opinions can be wrong.

1017
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:34,170
That's what they are.

1018
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:34,930
Their opinions.

1019
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,790
Not all, but are you trying to say every opinion you chat
has is wrong then?

1020
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:47,130
No, I'm saying every opinion is an opinion, dokeybird.

1021
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:47,970
Yeah, yeah.

1022
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,430
So are you trying, so then...

1023
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,010
Do you know what an opinion is, dokeybird?

1024
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,970
Yeah, but then it could be right or wrong.

1025
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,110
So you're trying to say that their opinion is wrong.

1026
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,290
If it doesn't agree with me, then I permabill.

1027
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:10,490
abandon so you're censoring them yeah whoa that's a
dictatorship out here that is a pal world gamer right there

1028
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:24,760
the truth will eventually come out what truth sure for
chatters you come here to say your truth say your truth here

1029
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,200
this is a safe space from sure for my place is a safe space

1030
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:39,780
people rarely it's just the option is there that's the auto
mod i didn't do that you have to establish dominance every

1031
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:53,620

1036
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:31,410
Cool.

1037
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:33,630
Yeah, you can try it out.

1038
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:34,410
You can try it out.

1039
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,170
Ask for forgiveness, not permission.

1040
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,150
That usually goes.

1041
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,150
I never told us, Natsu.

1042
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,190
Oh, sick rocks.

1043
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:42,670
That's true.

1044
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:43,350
That's true.

1045
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:49,430
Please, I've been trying to kill this Lyft Monk for like
five minutes now.

1046
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,870
He's always running.

1047
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:53,610
Look at this, I'm too lazy.

1048
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:58,250
Yay.

1049
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:10,200
Okay, we need to be level 24 somebody needs to be level 24
for us to get base level 12 That's the last recipe is at

1050
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,560
level 24 I'm working on it 24.

1051
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,800
Okay, I'm working on it.

1052
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,400
What level are you right now at once we get to that point?

1053
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,520
All we need to do is do material management to get it to
level 12.

1054
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:30,260
All right But we probably need to catch more stuff I'm
working on it What level are you right now?

1055
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:47,220
13 we're almost there i'm 10 i think close close i'm 13 11
sorry i'm 11 too yeah let's go let's go we're doing our part

1056
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:56,420
it took me like five minutes to catch one lift mug but i'm
doing my part we're getting it okay let me build a ranch

1057
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:10,620
because then we don't have to make pow balls anymore yay but
how much do those actually make the balls when it's split

1058
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:18,800
between four not great but I can make two ranches if I get
enough wood and stone ram ranch what do we need the most

1059
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:25,540
right now right now we need both wood and stone okay I'll
just do wood right now stone.

1060
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,240
I might as well just cut some wood.

1061
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,400
Pit tree.

1062
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,360
Punch tree.

1063
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,200
Do any of my boards do?

1064
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,880
Okay, we're a cart.

1065
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:36,600
What do you do?

1066
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,580
You do mining.

1067
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,740
Mining away.

1068
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,920
I don't know what's left to mine.

1069
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,580
I mine in any ways.

1070
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,620
Oh my god, I can do Minecraft plot covers now.

1071
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,180
We only need to be level 20.

1072
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:51,640
Oh, nice.

1073
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,160
Fuck these trees.

1074
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,180
I'm gonna go level up a little bit.

1075
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,180
Oh shit, I'm two.

1076
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,180
I'm slowly walking over.

1077
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,220
Mine diamonds.

1078
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,680
Don't worry.

1079
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,740
I'm worrying.

1080
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,100
I'll be the lumberjack of this team.

1081
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,280
I just really enjoy walking around, punching pals.

1082
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,520
Wait, did you not make a weapon?

1083
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,980
I just have a weapon.

1084
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,680
Oh, your fist.

1085
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:29,720
Yeah.

1086
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,320
My fist is made out of steel.

1087
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,380
Arcus are surprisingly very strong.

1088
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,660
What the heck?

1089
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,400
Why are my fists too slow?

1090
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,400
I just want to beat up this green squirrel.

1091
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:47,980
Yeah, that was me too.

1092
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,980
I gave up halfway.

1093
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,060
I'm sorry, the back bonus is surprisingly effective, so.

1094
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:55,920
You're going to bane him?

1095
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:57,500
What?

1096
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,860
You're going to bane the squirrel?

1097
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:00,900
Yeah, I bane him.

1098
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,460
Damn, that's fucked up.

1099
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,150
I'd do it to him.

1100
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,520
Why were they running?

1101
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,440
So they won't die?

1102
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,040
What the fuck?

1103
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,100
They just die in snow and that's kind of judgmental.

1104
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,400
I mean, they don't know anything about me.

1105
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,280
I can be really nice.

1106
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,920
You're trying to beat up a squirrel.

1107
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,780
Does that sound like a nice person here?

1108
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,820
You are not the nicest person here.

1109
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:37,940
some dudes down here maybe my hands just want to talk man
i'm gonna catch these guys i'm mining i'm mining all right

1113
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,560
We're doing our part, Lily.

1114
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:01,980
You're like a little set up.

1115
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:02,700
I don't get a gun.

1116
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,540
People catching.

1117
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:05,380
Woo.

1118
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,180
This is what we wanted, Nintendo.

1119
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,480
This is what we wanted.

1120
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,340
I want a cash Professor Oak.

1121
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,960
Yeah, but Nintendo will never do anything because they're
too big.

1122
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,800
They make...

1123
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,820
I feel like Nintendo's main revenue is just merchandising at
this point.

1124
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,880
It's not even gained.

1125
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,600
I got the police is after me.

1126
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,040
It's okay.

1127
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,180
Let me just get this person.

1128
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,420
I just want this person.

1129
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,780
I punched him into a rock and now I can't get him anymore.

1130
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:33,460
And I can't.

1131
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,360
I need to shoot him.

1132
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,000
Kill him.

1133
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:36,820
What do I do?

1134
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,000
Make a message.

1135
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,320
What the fuck?

1136
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,160
Well, there goes my only pal ball.

1137
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,920
Anyway, there's a guy down here in the rock.

1138
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,740
If anybody has a pal ball and want to catch him, he's like
right here.

1139
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,700
Wait, where is he?

1140
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,000
Right down this hill.

1141
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,180
I'm out of...

1142
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:51,940
Okay, I have pal balls.

1143
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,280
I'm out of balls.

1144
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,080
I can almost make a crossbow.

1145
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,260
I got him out of the rock, though.

1146
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,440
And he's ready to catch.

1147
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,500
Okay, I'm trying to fight.

1148
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,080
Oh, I see you.

1149
01:04:59,200 --> 01:04:59,960
I'm heading over.

1150
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,240
Don't worry.

1151
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,320
Help me.

1152
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,800
I'm coming over.

1153
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,880
Five nails.

1154
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,700
My knight in shining armor.

1155
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,520
Where are you?

1156
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,600
I'm coming over.

1157
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,560
Don't worry.

1158
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,700
I went the wrong way.

1159
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,900
Don't worry.

1160
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,320
I'm coming over for real now.

1161
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,220
Is he still there?

1162
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,280
Is he still there?

1163
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,080
Yeah, he's still shooting at me.

1164
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:31,480
Oh, boy.

1165
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,320
Just live.

1166
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,500
Oh, boy.

1167
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:35,580
Help.

1168
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,260
Don't worry.

1169
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,860
Wait, where in the world are you?

1170
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,120
Should I go the wrong way?

1171
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,200
I don't even see your name on the map anymore.

1172
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,120
Don't worry.

1173
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,900
I'm going the right way for real this time.

1174
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:47,680
Oh, okay.

1175
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,040
I see.

1176
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:48,560
I see.

1177
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,600
Oh, fuck.

1178
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,460
I think.

1179
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:50,920
I'm here.

1180
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,460
Don't worry.

1181
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:51,960
Yeah, you're coming.

1182
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:52,420
You're coming.

1183
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:52,880
Help me.

1184
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,780
I'm right here.

1185
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,380
Hello.

1186
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,820
I feel like Boar's gonna fucking kill him before I catch
him.

1187
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:58,840
Okay.

1188
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,980
All right, you have to hit him in the head because he
doesn't technically have a hitbox.

1189
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:02,280
There you go.

1190
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:04,920
Oh my god, look at this one pistol.

1191
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:05,740
You should be able to get him, though.

1192
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,240
Yeah, I got him.

1193
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:06,700
No!

1194
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,960
Oh, I got him out.

1195
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,720
I got him out, though.

1196
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,580
Come on, get over here.

1197
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,140
I have five more.

1198
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:17,340
Oh, wait, that's your Boar.

1199
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,540
That's my Boar, yeah.

1200
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:19,680
I have five more.

1201
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,060
I was trying to kill it.

1202
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,240
He's six?

1203
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,340
Oh, I got it!

1204
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,160
We got a syndicate thug.

1205
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,280
I'm gonna put some dudes in here.

1206
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:33,160
Alright.

1207
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,580
We're doing it.

1208
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,520
We're doing it.

1209
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:44,660
Alright, I'm gonna put my human in the pal box.

1210
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:48,840
Wait, he's already in here.

1211
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,040
I'm being assaulted by three officers for assaulting a
person.

1212
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:53,160
Oh, shit.

1213
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,380
That's it.

1214
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,680
It's like assaulting people is a bad thing, Lily.

1215
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,480
I hope

1216
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,200
No big deal and they but they already have a home.

1217
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,060
What do you mean?

1218
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:16,960
But I can't make a homie your home, but their family isn't
their original home Are you trying to see your buddy now?

1219
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,460
This hole was made for me

1220
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,020
Wow, don't talk to...

1221
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:30,220
Never mind.

1222
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,280
I'm not going to make that show.

1223
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:33,620
Go on.

1224
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:34,440
No, no, no, no.

1225
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,020
No, say it with your chest.

1226
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,780
No, no, it's okay.

1227
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,220
It's okay.

1228
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,020
Say it with your chest.

1229
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,820
Don't go for European, Lily!

1230
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,320
Don't go for European!

1231
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,740
You're so European!

1232
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,800
Well, you were going to go that route, huh?

1233
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,520
Wait, what happened on the rock?

1234
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:52,300
Never mind, never mind.

1235
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,460
This is ending to a tribals!

1236
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,600
We can't get away with this!

1237
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,880
Alright, do now do we have enough for the stone pit?

1238
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,400
Alright, I'm putting out the stone pit.

1239
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:07,640
Alright, nice.

1240
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,280
I should have built the ranch first.

1241
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,360
Wait, what do I need for the ranch?

1242
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,600
Don't worry, it's a good option at this point.

1243
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,960
Alright, don't worry, I have a lot of stone.

1244
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm coming over.

1245
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:23,660
Maybe just put it in the box.

1246
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,200
Yeah, I'm going to put it in the box.

1247
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:34,450
You got any fire Pokemon in the paldex?

1248
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:35,990
We've got one.

1249
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:37,730
I got only the Fox Sparks.

1250
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:39,950
What the?

1251
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,630
I put the stone in.

1252
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,010
Rock and stone.

1253
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:46,830
Rock and stone.

1254
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:50,010
Okay.

1255
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,090
Do we need more stone?

1256
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,130
No, I think we're good.

1257
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:54,010
I'm going to build the first branch.

1258
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:56,590
Nice.

1259
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:58,870
I know it's a make a newbis.

01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,080
He's doing his part.

1265
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,500
Our little teammate.

1266
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:40,980
He's a great asset.

1267
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:42,960
Great ass.

1268
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:44,220
Great, great ass.

1269
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,700
What the hell name is that?

1270
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,520
It says, are you guys making a crossbow?

1271
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,440
Oh, you're making a crossbow.

1272
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,400
I'm making a crossbow.

1273
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,040
Oh, nice.

1274
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,480
Oh, where's the repair bench?

1275
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,860
And I'm going to go murder things.

1276
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:57,520
Oh, I think I put...

1277
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,420
Wait, did I...

1278
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,640
Did I just assemble the repair?

1279
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,380
Why is there, like, four benches?

1280
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,280
We have, like, four benches.

1281
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,360
We can be...

1282
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,580
So we can work on multiple projects.

1283
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,200
We have five.

1284
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:07,760
Okay, I should know.

1285
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,760
We should make we should replace them with the high quality
benches when we can though, because they make stuff faster.

1286
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,780
High quality right here.

1287
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,200
I'm gonna put a repair bench right here.

1288
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,240
Now we have I don't know if we do have a repair bench, but
here is one too.

1289
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:23,240
Nice.

1290
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,280
Why is she so tanky?

1291
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,040

01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,820
Dyerwolf is pretty good.

1295
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:42,640
Dyerwolf, oh, yeah.

1296
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:45,840
You have to, like, chill it anyway, so you can just do chill
it if you want.

1297
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:47,860
I'm going to try to find it.

1298
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:48,460
The first one is.

1299
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,620
I think it's Rushboard.

1300
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,500
Yeah, the Rushboard is the first one.

1301
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,300
I'm trying to remember where the Dyerwolf was.

1302
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:55,740
How did it get the Dyerwolf?

1303
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:56,940
It's near the bridge.

1304
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:57,960
The bridge.

1305
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,560
There's, like, a bridge near a waypoint.

1306
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,160
Where is Dyerwolf?

1307

1313
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,180
I did not double check that.

1314
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,260
Yeah, you always gotta check your balls before you go out.

1315
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:16,270
No comment.

1316
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,630
I want you to live with that thing you just said.

1317
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:22,590
I want you to think about what you just said.

1318
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,110
Man, I think he's not really my strong suit.

1319
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:25,490
It's all good.

1320
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:25,970
I don't agree.

1321
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:30,330
Dang.

1322
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:35,050
You gotta check your boss and make sure you don't have
cancer.

1323
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,470
No, that's for breasts, right?

1324
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,910
No, no, I think you can get testicular cancer.

1325
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:45,410
Yeah, yeah, you have to do that for, yeah, testicular cancer
too.

1326
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:46,050
Mm-hmm.

1327
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:46,470
Yeah.

1328
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:47,730
Okay, you check for lumps.

1329
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,210
So you would say you have fondled them.

1330
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:50,390
Sure, boy, did you check your...

1331
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,650
Yeah, Chad, you should fondle...

1332
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,030
Chad, make sure you don't have lumps.

1333
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,030
Chad, make sure you don't have lumps.

1334
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,030
Real quick, real quick.

1335
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,730
Stop telling your VTuber chats to fondle their balls.

1336
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,750
You know, half of them have lived for a statement like that.

1337
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:10,210
Trevor, did you check your balls today to see?

1338
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:10,990
Yeah, did you?

1339
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,490
I'm being harassed right now.

1340
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,910
We're not the ones checking.

1341
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,810
We're asking if you checked yourself.

1342
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:19,910
Yeah.

1343
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,390
It's one of the global achievements, I think.

1344
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,010
I'm not going to talk about my balls.

1345
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:29,230
We're just concerned about your health.

1346
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:30,530
Cap.

1347
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:31,890

1356
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,890
We just need to wait till nighttime right now.

1357
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:43,130
Yeah.

1358
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:44,070
Yeah.

1359
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,390
It's not nighttime, so we can't do anything.

1360
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,710
But the elk would be good.

1361
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:49,250
Elk should be out right now, so...

1362
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:49,970
If you see one.

1363
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:52,090
Still trying to figure out where the dire wolf is.

1364
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,930
They're on me.

1365
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:54,730
They're on you?

1366
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:55,310
Where are you?

1367
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,290
Oh my god, you're so far away.

1368
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:56,810
I'm heading over.

1369
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,650
I think I need to go...

1370
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,270
Level.

1371
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:06,830
Whoa!

1372
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:08,090
Not the poor sheep!

1373
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,350
It's taking so long!

1374
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:13,570
I want to build the second ranch.

1375
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,710
Wait, maybe I can catch this person.

1376
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:20,190

01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:29,910
Nice!

1380
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:31,590
More human.

1381
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:32,470
Let's go.

1382
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:32,930
More human.

1383
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,390
More work.

1384
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:37,810
Something you're doing?

1385
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:39,970
What are you sure for?

1386
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:40,630

1387
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:41,510
Soak, soak.

1388
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:41,910

1389
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:53,370
Oh, I know where the wait, oh, there's a shiny lambel No,
get it don't get it don't kill it.

1390
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:53,950

1394
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:15,210
Hold four.

1395
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:16,850
It's fine, we're fine.

1396
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,030
It's okay.

1397
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:20,630
I'm beating him up right now.

1398
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:23,030
I'm beating him up now.

1399
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:23,330
Whoa.

1400
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,650
I'm gonna make sure I don't accidentally kill him myself.

1401
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:33,230
I think it's faster to die and just try again.

1402
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:33,750
What the fuck?

1403
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,370

Flip it, bro.

1413
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:47,550
Guys, I haven't been on this Twitch in a long time.

1414
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,090
Do I even have Vaughn history on?

1415
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:50,790
I actually did it, chat.

1416
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:51,710
Oh, no.

1417
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:56,550
That's against the rules.

1418
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:58,750
I have an excuse.

1419
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:00,990
I have an excuse, though.

1420
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,570
You have no excuse.

1421
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,450
I have this note from my doctor.

1422
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:06,850
I do.

1423
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,610
It's okay.

1424
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,050
I might die, though.

1425
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:09,870
I do, though.

1426
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:10,390
I do.

1427
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:11,550
It's fine.

1428
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:13,650
So close!

1429
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:18,670
I'm just saying this.

1430
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:19,370
Saves!

1431
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,510
Has anybody gone to the Chile yet?

1432
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,290
Oh wait, I have no, clips are not on.

1433
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:24,690
Wait, let me put clips on.

1434
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:29,910
Guys, remember to go back to my VOD and clip it when I put
it back on!

1435
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:31,090
Wait, no, if it's...

1436
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:32,850
Wait, if you don't have it on, you won't have a VOD.

1437
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,190
Oh wait, clips are on!

1438
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:35,250
Don't worry, people were...

1439
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,110
Yeah, people were fucking around.

1440
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,430
It's okay, clips are on.

1441
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:44,830
Wait, do you guys see?

1442
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,690
Okay, there's an outpost over here with the thugs.

1443
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:49,510
They've got those elks over there.

1444
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:50,830
Oh, okay.

1445
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:51,310
Nice.

1446
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,310
Why are so many dire wolves here?

1447
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,370
Yeah, we should probably go get those elks.

1448
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:58,210
I have no health because I have no food.

1449
01:17:59,410 --> 01:17:59,810
But...

1450
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:01,730
Maybe I'll find some food.

1451
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,910
If I die, that's probably better, so that's fine.

1452
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,230
If I die, I die.

1453
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,670
You die, just respawn forehead.

1454
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:09,630

01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:53,940
Great progression.

1527
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,020
Get over here.

1528
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,720
I'm gonna fucking catch you.

1529
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,040
Whoa.

1530
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,360

1531
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,500
Yeah, tell your lawyer.

1532
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,120
You saw a chat.

1533
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,440
He shot first, guys.

1534
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,980
Oh my god, I actually might die.

1535
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,420
I'm fucking around way too much.

1536
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,140
Get anything for these diaries?

1537
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:15,940
Oh no, oh no.

1538
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,420
I don't think so.

1539
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:31,560
is the limelock achievement is that a global one or is that
just a day one it's a global i'm pretty sure yeah yeah it's

1540
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:39,740
a global cool cool all that day one achievements are like
very uh just mostly catching the bosses um except for the

1541
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,840
bases and the

1542
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,360
I had two Tombats.

1543
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,760
Who do we replace then for the Tombats?

1544
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,760
Well, we actually, we should be able to build the next
thing.

1545
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:01,660
Sorry, I'm not at base right now, but we should be able to
build the next thing now, which I think is another berry

1546
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,000
thing.

1547
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,420
We were out of resources last time, but we should be able to
do a base upgrade, and then you can just throw them in.

1548
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:07,400
All right, what do we need for the berry?

1549
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:09,580
Give me one second.

1550
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:10,700
I'm almost back at base.

1551
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,600
Okay, I got the Tombat.

1552
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:13,860
I'm heading over to the base.

1553
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:15,140
Alright, sounds good.

1554
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:16,760
10-4.

1555
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,380
I'm getting some Wock.

1556
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,120
Wock.

1557
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:20,760
Shruck.

1558
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,240
Metal.

1559
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,120
Seeds and wood.

1560
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:29,220
We have a lot of seeds, so I think that should be fine.

1561
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:29,700
I'm back in.

1562
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,420
Seed fiber and wood.

1563
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,640
Give me the light.

1564
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,120
Let me just double check and see what we need.

1565
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,820
Next base upgrade, we need one more barrel.

1566
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,340
plantation and hot springs okay i got you a lot i can build
the hot springs right now

1567
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:52,620
yeah i can put some wood for you thank you

1568
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:05,640
and then all right yeah we have like 268 wood oh i have like
ancient civilization parts i have six how do i get six i

1569
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:10,200
think we're gonna need that for the next upgrade What the
fuck did I grab have six already?

1570
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,060
We don't need scope roads, do we?

1571
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,440
What did I do?

1572
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,720
We need five stone.

1573
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,260
Oh, five stone?

1574
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:15,800
Easy.

1575
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,700
Yeah, I'll grab.

1576
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:19,220
No.

1577
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,760
Don't need it.

1578
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,000
All right.

1579
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:26,750
Oh!

1580
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:31,350
When I caught the shiny lamb bill, I got ancient
civilization parts.

1581
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:32,210
That makes sense.

1582
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:34,590
I didn't notice that.

1583
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:35,050
All right.

1584
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:37,010
I put the five stone in.

1585
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:38,490
We can do a dungeon run, too.

1586
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:45,450
There's a dungeon right by the entrance our base we need the
do the dungeon bosses count towards anything uh no well

1587
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:53,450

1694
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:36,820
She keeps alerting the authorities.

1695
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:38,660
How dare her call the cops?

1696
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:39,500
Right?

1697
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:42,300

01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:46,560
And I'm shooting her and I had a couple times so she's
catchable.

She should enjoy the moment.

1702
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,600
She's being too hot on herself.

1703
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,760
Just enjoy the moment.

1704
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,640

That's what I said.

1793
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,680
Before you leave, you gotta check your balls.

1794
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,620
Always check your balls, guys.

1795
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:14,240
Always check your balls before you leave.

1796
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:15,800
Why is it always about balls?

1797
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,300
It's okay.

Nope.

1813
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:48,560
That's right.

1814
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,920
You'll never be able to leave me for a better streamer.

1815
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:51,400
Exactly.

1816
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,440
You'll never know.

1817
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,840
Where the hell is this thing going?

1818
01:39:58,060 --> 01:39:59,840
Can't leave me if you don't have a resume.

1819
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:04,330

1826
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:11,450

1827
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:14,450
He's enough level for sure, for he's level 23 right now.

1833
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:25,090
Oh, hey, there's a Tifa in here.

1834
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:26,250
I'm going to kill him.

1835
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:26,690
All right.

1836
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:30,550
I'm just going to level.

1837
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,430
All right.

1838
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:39,370
Where is Chillit?

1839
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:40,070

All right, do your thing, Dyer Wolf.

01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,740
Don't worry, I have my pickaxe.

1843
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:57,680
Ow.

1844
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:07,060
Don't worry, I'm doing, like, two damage per second with my
pickaxe.

1845
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:08,220
Ow.

1846
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:12,600

1847
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:15,680

It's only, like, 51?

1851
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:21,500
What the fuck?

1852
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:22,200
That's so little?

1853
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:26,160

01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,260

01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:38,060
Go to my stream right now!

1858
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,660
Go to my stream right now!

1859
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:41,400
Go peepees!

1860
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:41,800
Go peepees go!

1861
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,220
We got noodle.

1862
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:46,540
I need butter piles.

1863
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,660
I can't kill shit anymore.

1864
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:50,240
My pile is just like...

1865
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,600
Mining a rock while I'm fighting stuff.

1866
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:54,520
Stop killing everything.

1867
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,500
We're trying to catch them.

1868
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:01,740
I'm heading over now to give us the incubator.

1869
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:05,540
What the fuck?

1870
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:08,320
What the fuck?

1871
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,640
The King Paca just ran off in the other direction.

1872
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:12,180
Can you leave the boss area?

1873
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,540
I think they all can technically if you aggro it.

1874
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,460
If you aggro it, yeah.

1875
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:22,040
I didn't aggro him, but dude, he's got shit to do, I guess.

1876
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,100
I guess he forgot to pay his taxes or something.

1877
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:24,540
He was in a hurry.

1878
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:27,320
All right, let's see.

1879
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:35,700
Uh...

1880
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:36,760
Got to chill in right here.

1881
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:38,580
I'm going to put that chill in my team now.

1882
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:39,700
All right.

1883
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,700
Let me level up that incubator.

1884
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:43,880
We have...

1885
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:45,380
We need palladium fragments.

1886
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:47,520
Does anyone have extra palladium fragments?

1887
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,300
Oh, I can mine some.

1888
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,940
Yeah, I need some fragments to make the incubator.

1889
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:54,700
Pretty sure I just put some in a chest.

1890
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,080
Cut in a month.

1891
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:58,860
Can't make it.

1892
01:42:58,860 --> 01:42:59,560
Oh, yeah, I did.

1893
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,520
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

1894
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:01,700
Alright.

1895
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:02,920
Nice.

1896
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:05,260
Alright, incubator.

1897
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:07,600
I'm gonna put it right here.

1898
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:10,560
Alright.

1899
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,560
Here you go.

1900
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,580
Right, right.

1901
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:19,880
I should finally make a crossbow.

1902
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,220
I've been trying to beat everything up with a pickaxe.

1903
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:27,660
It wasn't really the smartest thing to do.

1904
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:41,200
let's see it's so annoying I can't climb anything because of
like the pingy shield I guess every time I climb I have to

1905
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:49,440
like slow climb because the second I press space I just like
snap back snap back to reality oh there goes gravity he's so

1906

Oh, I can't climb.

1916
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:43,750
Wait, what's our PAL base?

1917
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:45,490
Why do I have all those ingots?

1918
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:47,250
What's our PAL base level right now?

1919
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:49,870
Uh, it should be level 9 or 10.

1920
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:51,490
Oh, shit, Rob was at 12.

1921
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:52,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1922

I got the penguin.

1925
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:58,950
It's only about materials now.

1926
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:02,250
because we already have somebody the right level.

1927
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:04,670
Good question.

1928
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:06,330
I'm about to come back to base.

1929
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:11,110
Yeah, I guess I can mine some materials right now for us and
then sure if we can make it.

1930
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:14,350
I know that we're going to need Inget, but I have like 26.

We'll sue you for discrimination.

Yeah, yeah, we'll plan something.

1971
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:49,380

How am I being called a cheater again?

1973
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,460
Oh, it's a re-entering theme.

1974
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,320
Yeah, you don't know.

1975
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:58,760
You don't know.

1976
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,280
What the?

1977
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:01,720
As coincidence?

1978
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:03,920
Mmm...

1979
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:05,120
Mm-hmm.

01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:07,360
I don't know.

1981
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,480
Doesn't seem much of a coincidence anymore.

1982
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,200
It'll co-winky-dink.

1983
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,080
Surely there's some truth to it.

1984
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:15,880
Mm-hmm.

1985
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,120
I'm getting more iron.

1986
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:21,060
Do we just need ore?

1987
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:25,420
I've got a bunch, but I took it with me for some reason.

1988
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:28,080
Yeah, but like what materials do we need for all the other
stuff?

1989
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:28,540
Ugh.

1990
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,020

I'm just trying to retrieve my stuff.

2027
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:40,920
Mr. Merchant, do you have the seeds?

2028
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:42,660
Oh, I got wheat seeds.

2029
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:44,000
Nice!

2030
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:48,200
I'm dead.

2031
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,140
What can I build right now?

2032
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:50,120
Oh, my God!

2033
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:50,860
What happened?

2034
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:55,920
My Pokemon weren't on aggressive, and then they didn't
attack.

2035
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:57,560
And then I got Swiftie one shot.

2036
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:00,560
You fell off.

2037
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:01,460
Oh, my God.

2038
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:01,860
There you are.

2039
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,320
The most ratio.

2040
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:04,420
All right.

2041
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:06,500
in one of the boxes.

2042
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:07,240
All right.

2043
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:08,560
So you can just make it.

2044
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:10,320
And then I'll make the cooking pot.

2045
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,000
Where is the...

2046
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,780
I'll make the wheat plantation and then someone can make the
cooking pot, yeah.

2047
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:15,760
Yeah, I can make it now.

2048
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,340
All right, cool.

2049
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,080
Nice.

2050
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:19,420
I'll put it right.

2051
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:22,340
I'll put it next to the incubator.

2052
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:24,120
Oh, can you put the wheat seeds in the box?

2053
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:24,620
Yeah, I did.

2054
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,140
I just did.

2055
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,200
Oh, shit.

2056
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:28,200
Should be in one.

2057
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:28,820
Two more.

2058
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:30,220
Oh, we need two wheat seeds?

2059
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:31,300
We need three of them.

2060
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:31,860
Yeah, sorry.

2061
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:32,540
Okay.

2062
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:34,060
Sorry, my bad.

2063
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:34,820
I'll go buy it.

2064
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:35,440
Do I have enough money?

2065
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:37,860
We need two more, right?

2066
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:39,140
Okay, yeah, two more.

2067
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:40,600
Okay, I'm gonna get out of here.

2068
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:42,320
Goodbye.

2069
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:46,780
Don't worry, here I am.

2070
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:49,800
God, we have so much ingot.

2071
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:50,740
I love the space.

2072
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:55,660
I have just enough for two more wheat seeds.

2073
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,460
I'm gonna go grab the...

2074
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,460
I'm gonna go grab the leather I left behind.

2075
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:02,800
Nice.

2076
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:04,880
Alright, now I'm broke for the wheat.

2077
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:06,840
It's for the wheat.

2078
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,060
It's a good purchase.

2079
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:09,040
Do it for the wheat.

2080
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,360
I'm handing over.

2081
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:14,440
Someone's slacking off.

2082
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:15,500
We have to eat him now.

2083
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:16,780
Oh yeah.

2084
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,680
Well, we can make a machete.

2085
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,040
It's to send a message.

2086
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:24,300
No slacking off.

2087
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:33,350
Slack off and get eaten.

2088
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:36,510
We can replace you with another life monk.

2089
01:52:36,870 --> 01:52:37,410
But you matter.

2090
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:38,030

No, no, no, no.

2116
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:03,100
I can't see it, but I think I'm going the right way.

2117
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:09,540
I almost died, because I always...

2118
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:11,440
Turn on my glider before I hit the ground.

2119

2126
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,640
We need someone to make the work bench.

2127
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:11,740
I'm sorry, the weapons work bench at level 20.

2128
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,100
I can make that.

2129
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,220
I'll make nails right now.

2130
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:16,980
Guys, I don't know if I can find him again.

2131
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:17,940
Oh, you got nails?

2132
01:55:18,180 --> 01:55:18,280
Okay.

01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:19,840
Oh, I see, I see.

2134
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:20,500
I'll start.

2135
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:21,820
I'll work on the map.

2136
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,360
Wait, we can mark him?

2137
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:23,600
We?

2138
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:24,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2139
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:26,700
All we need is the weapons work bench.

2140
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:28,200
We'll be level 11 base.

2141
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:28,820
Okay.

2142
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:29,960
I marked him.

2143
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:31,240
I did it.

2144
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,360
I found, all right.

2145
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:34,940
Nearly drowning saved my life.

2146
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:42,420
we need uh for day two do we need a different level of base
or is it like just um day two we need 20.

2147
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:49,360
okay yeah and then we have to catch a two black marketeer
they'll up any pal the low 50.

2148
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:54,980
oh you can't catch them that okay cool yeah we have to catch
you later just normal just normal yeah no i know but i

2149
01:55:54,980 --> 01:56:00,120
didn't know that i didn't i i still feel like it's a little
bit exploited to catch them but like yeah okay no they even

2150
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,260
said it's fine you can do the pal recycling

2151
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:16,450
it's so dark I can't see I might just have to get the fox
spark my

2152
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:28,450
alright we don't need a second tombat do we no we're good
yeah I already have two tombatts here we might as well catch

2153
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:38,650
stuff to just level up yeah yeah true true and you get to if
you find a level 29 chickpea sure for it go for it because

2154
01:56:38,650 --> 01:56:43,590
we still need a level 30 chickpea Whenever you come back to
base, if you can build the weapon.

2155
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:44,730
I think you have to level it yourself.

2156
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:46,730
I don't think there's ever just going to be a random one
unless it's like...

2157
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:47,490
Unless you find shiny.

2158
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:48,430
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

2159
01:56:49,210 --> 01:56:50,030
Oh, we find a shiny.

2160
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:54,430
Oh my god, where am I?

2161
01:56:54,430 --> 01:56:55,170
That was responsive!

2162
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:56,750
Cool.

2163
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:01,850
I'm trying to get to the sweeper.

2164
01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:05,790
But I can't even see.

2165
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:08,310
Uh-oh.

2166
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:12,510
Four of my...

2167
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:13,550
Oh, there you are.

2168
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:17,750
Uh...

2169
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:18,950
Okay, we're still low on wood.

2170
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:21,810
I mean, I should try and capture a flying pal.

2171
01:57:22,490 --> 01:57:25,850
That would be very helpful.

2172
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:31,350
I think the...

2173
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:36,030
the easiest and best one you can get at this level is
like...

2174
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:39,610
I guess it's still the...

2175
01:57:39,610 --> 01:57:40,230
bird one.

2176
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:43,310
I want to get that Why is it the dragon one?

2177
01:57:43,850 --> 01:57:45,170
Yeah, that one's way sicker, though.

2178
01:57:45,230 --> 01:57:46,510
If you can make it out to the desert.

2179
01:57:48,530 --> 01:57:50,290
I need to figure out how to get there.

2180
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:50,630
What the?

2181
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,550
I'm going to kill that sweeper, and then I'm going to get
it.

2182
01:57:56,010 --> 01:57:56,650
Yeah, Quivern.

2183
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:57,930
Yeah, I think that's the one.

2184
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:05,840
Oh, I can't touch.

2185
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:06,980
Oops.

2186
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:09,480
All right.

2187
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:11,180
Acquired.

2188
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,140
Am I close?

2189
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:16,640
Am I close to the sweeper?

2190
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:19,040
Where is he?

2191
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,320
I already forgot where he is.

2192
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:23,600
Where's who?

2193
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:24,680
The sweeper.

2194
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:25,940
Sweeper.

2195
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:27,260
He's so far.

2196
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:29,520
Did you get all the nails made?

2197
01:58:30,220 --> 01:58:31,020
Yep, everything's made.

2198
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,300
All we need is just somebody to make it.

2199
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,300
What do I need to make?

2200
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,720
It's level 20, the weapons workbench.

2201
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:44,860
I'm always lost.

2202
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:45,960
Where the fuck do I put it?

2203
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:49,540
And then we'll be level 12 and we'll have completed base for
today.

2204
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:50,180
Yay!

2205
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:52,200
And then I guess it's just like...

2206
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:54,640
I guess we can like keep leveling the base.

2207
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:55,720
Oh yeah, we can keep leveling it.

2208
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:56,260
Yeah, for sure.

2209
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,220
We level it to level 19.

2210
01:58:58,880 --> 01:58:59,120
Yeah.

2211
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:01,880
So we can get it for levels.

2212
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:03,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2213
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:04,600
True, true, true, base, base.

2214
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,040
As long as you just don't hit the level up button, it
doesn't count.

2215
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,060
Yeah, yeah, we just get it to level 19 and we're fine.

2216
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:11,880
Yeah.

2217
01:59:19,050 --> 01:59:21,630
Oh shit, don't worry, Deja, I'm gonna save you.

2218
01:59:24,350 --> 01:59:24,710
Oh shit.

2219
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:25,510
Oh, he's dead.

2220
01:59:25,790 --> 01:59:26,750
Okay, that's...

2221
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:27,210
Sucks.

2222
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,510
Okay, I got 21 tile balls.

2223
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:33,750
I need to bury the...

2224
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:35,050
I need to catch some stuff.

2225
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:36,750
What is this?

2226
01:59:36,830 --> 01:59:37,510
Oh, hey, there's...

2227
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:38,710
Hey, there's another Tombat!

2228
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:40,370
Hey, yo!

2229
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:42,790
But we don't need it anyway, so I'm just gonna release him.

2230
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:46,450
Yeah, but I mean, if you get the 10...

2231
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:47,250
That's true.

2232
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:52,420
I'm gonna go catch this thing.

2233
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:55,560
Nice.

2234
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:56,660
Oh, I'm...

2235
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:58,580
Put my pal's presence up, his...

2236
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:00,080
Get over here.

2237
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,020
Get over here, dire wolf.

2238
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:05,900
No, please, I don't want to die because I'm still using my
pick ass as a weapon.

2239
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:09,540
No!

2240
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:10,440
Oh.

2241
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:11,800
Okay, I'm just gonna leave.

2242
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:14,920
Get over here, dire wolf.

2243
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,640
We're gonna leave.

2244
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:19,980
Where am I?

2245
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:22,420
Oh.

2246
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:25,840
I should really start crafting a bow.

2247
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,680
I want to get a crossbow.

2248
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:32,340
Yeah, I need a crossbow too.

2249
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,140
I have not been crafting.

2250
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:36,360
I was scared to craft one.

2251
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:38,160
I was like, oh shit, that's not an ingot cost.

2252
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:38,900
I was like, ah!

2253
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:43,040
What the hell is happening to this spark?

2254
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:46,180
Alright.

2255
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,760
See where am I?

2256
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:52,500
Yay, it's almost daytime!

2257
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:56,140
Hold up.

2258
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,360
Oh, hey, there's a Toko-toko.

2259
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:00,420
We needed those, right?

2260
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:00,820
Oh, nice.

2261
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:01,320
We need that.

2262
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:02,400
Yeah, we need 10 of them.

2263
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:03,120
Yeah, okay.

2264
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:11,620
Yeah, now that we've almost got our base up to 12, we might
as well like go towards the desert, I think.

2265
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:13,880
Yeah, there's one here on me.

2266
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:14,720
Yeah, there's one.

2267
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:17,340
Should we start doing the bosses that we have to do
together?

2268
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:20,300
I don't think there's any bosses.

2269
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:21,300
Yeah, there's no bosses.

2270
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:21,960

My dire wolf kind of killed him while I was waiting to
respawn.

2288
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:15,410
Yeah.

I mean, doesn't that count though?

2294
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:22,690
I mean, apparently we have to catch them.

2295
02:03:23,410 --> 02:03:24,030
Oh, okay.

2296
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:30,570
Should we start making, once you have the, well, we've
already got the Palsphere wrench we can already start making

2297
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:39,650
gigaspheres or whatever the green ones are called all right
we can make hyperspheres i can at least i think you're at

2298
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:49,510
the point that you can make hyperspheres yeah all right i
gotta go back and see oh there's a there's some more iron

2299
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:54,750
see he can hear somewhere when do we unlock the secondary

2300
02:03:58,230 --> 02:04:00,830
location uh We might have already, actually.

2301
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:02,250
I don't know what level that unlocks at.

2302
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:03,610
The secondary base?

2303
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:06,870
We'll check right now.

2304
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:07,550
I'll go check.

2305
02:04:08,130 --> 02:04:09,850
Yeah, when will we be over to you reach that point?

2306
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:12,110
Wait, where do we put our secondary base then?

2307
02:04:12,130 --> 02:04:13,170
Yeah, I think you unlock it at level 10.

2308
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:13,930
Yeah, we have it.

2309
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:14,550

Okay, yeah.

I don't know.

2313
02:04:18,030 --> 02:04:18,610
You're the base expert.

2314
02:04:18,990 --> 02:04:19,790
That's probably near the desert or something.

2315
02:04:20,830 --> 02:04:22,410
Yeah, desert sounds nice.

2316
02:04:24,630 --> 02:04:26,710

02:08:55,830 --> 02:08:58,830
I only have a pickaxe.

2368
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:00,310
So I'm not helpful.

2369
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:04,930
No, not the babies.

2370
02:09:06,670 --> 02:09:08,010
We don't care about the babies.

2371
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:08,910
No!

2372
02:09:09,050 --> 02:09:09,870
Oh, God.

2373
02:09:10,050 --> 02:09:10,190
Oh, God.

2374
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:10,970
I might actually die.

2375
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:12,210
Whoa, whoa.

2376
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:15,490
It's okay.

2377
02:09:15,590 --> 02:09:16,610
My dire wolf is okay.

2378
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:17,590
I leveled up.

2379
02:09:17,790 --> 02:09:17,910
Woo.

2380
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:19,090
It's okay.

2381
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:21,090
It's like Dark Souls dodging.

2382
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:21,750
Two more balls.

2383
02:09:22,550 --> 02:09:24,890
Then I have to farm some ball materials.

2384
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:25,830
Nice.

2385
02:09:25,890 --> 02:09:26,810
It's always balls.

2386
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:27,490
Oh, I see.

2387
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:28,810
It's always balls.

2388
02:09:29,630 --> 02:09:31,390
What am I going to do with all these balls?

2389
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:32,690
No way.

2390
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:35,050
That's not worth it.

2391
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:36,090
I'm not running after him.

2392
02:09:38,450 --> 02:09:38,970
Come on.

2393
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:39,730
Dyer wolf.

2394
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:40,150
Nice.

2395
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:42,090
Oh no, he's hungry.

2396
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:43,930
I just have to dodge earlier.

2397
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:45,830
Yeah.

2398
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:48,570
You have to think into the future.

2399
02:09:49,150 --> 02:09:49,750
Yeah, exactly.

2400
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:51,610
I have to think everything a little early.

2401
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:53,470
Just think 200 pinyon advance.

2402
02:09:56,070 --> 02:09:57,610
Oh no, my pal team is hungry.

2403
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:03,970
Yeah, the fastest way to level up in this game is just to
catch pals.

2404
02:10:04,190 --> 02:10:05,710
Like literally just spam catch pals.

2405
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:06,850
Don't worry.

2406
02:10:07,650 --> 02:10:08,770
And I'm out of vaults.

2407
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:09,730
One ball left.

2408
02:10:10,530 --> 02:10:11,850
Give me that sweeper!

2409
02:10:15,070 --> 02:10:17,530
I shall harvest balls.

2410
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:20,410
So proud of you.

2411
02:10:20,810 --> 02:10:21,070
Nice.

2412
02:10:22,230 --> 02:10:22,870
Go for the dick.

2413
02:10:24,910 --> 02:10:25,510
I missed!

2414
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:26,790
Clip!

2415
02:10:27,210 --> 02:10:27,890
I got them!

2416
02:10:28,050 --> 02:10:29,770
Okay, but don't clip the dick part!

2417
02:10:30,110 --> 02:10:31,050
Clip it!

2418
02:10:33,550 --> 02:10:34,510
Clip it!

2419
02:10:35,670 --> 02:10:36,530
The sweeper!

2420
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:38,470
I grabbed the sweeper!

2421
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:39,810
Wait!

2422
02:10:42,370 --> 02:10:43,930
Nice, we did it.

2423
02:10:44,050 --> 02:10:46,550
And it feed my fucking wolf.

2424
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:49,170
Alright, nice.

2425
02:10:50,610 --> 02:10:51,450
Where is this?

2426
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:52,230
Oh my god.

2427
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:56,170
Alright guys, I got the sweeper.

2428
02:10:56,530 --> 02:10:58,130
Another boss down!

2429
02:10:58,870 --> 02:10:59,470
Let's go!

2430
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:01,630
I'm so freaking proud of you.

2431
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:03,370
Oh my god, you're so great.

2432
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:06,050
Do you have a...

2433
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:10,190
Do you cheer for how many bosses have you caught yet now?

2434
02:11:10,490 --> 02:11:11,530
I've killed one.

2435
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:16,610
Why is this cat attacking?

2436
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:22,340
And grab more.

2437
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:25,020
Nice.

2438
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:29,300
Who's next after sweeper?

2439
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:35,260
What do I have to catch next?

2440
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:37,580
The gumas.

2441
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:39,280
Okay, where is gumas?

2442
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:40,740
Gumas, where?

2443
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:48,650
Where is this?

2444
02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:50,350
Come on, get in the boat!

2445
02:11:50,830 --> 02:11:51,130
Nice!

2446
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:52,530
Nice guy.

2447
02:11:52,590 --> 02:11:52,930
Nice guy.

2448
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:55,670
We're doing it.

2449
02:11:56,530 --> 02:11:58,190
Where the fuck is the Gumas boss?

2450
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:01,090
Where is it?

2451
02:12:01,110 --> 02:12:01,910
This is not helpful.

2452
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:02,650
You should get that check though.

2453
02:12:02,770 --> 02:12:03,030
I don't know.

2454
02:12:05,130 --> 02:12:08,410
Gumas POW world boss location.

2455
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:14,050
What?

2456
02:12:15,390 --> 02:12:16,710
What the fuck is it?

2457
02:12:20,950 --> 02:12:23,270
Let me get some stuff away.

2458
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:26,110
Let me steal some of that.

2459
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:28,070
I need some more balls.

2460
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:30,690
What the heck?

2461
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:32,030
We all need balls, don't we?

2462
02:12:33,610 --> 02:12:34,110
Yeah.

2463
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:36,190
I'm gonna steal all the balls.

2464
02:12:36,510 --> 02:12:37,610
We are in need of balls.

2465
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:40,030
Let's see.

2466
02:12:41,230 --> 02:12:43,450
Oh, I need to put away this.

2467
02:12:43,810 --> 02:12:43,810
This.

2468
02:12:44,170 --> 02:12:44,770
Oh, yeah.

2469
02:12:45,010 --> 02:12:47,130
I put some ancient civilization parts away.

2470
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:49,790
Is there anything we need to make in ancient civilization?

2471
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:52,630
No, right?

2472
02:12:55,230 --> 02:12:58,890
There will be, but not right now.

2473
02:12:59,090 --> 02:12:59,890
Not right now, okay.

2474
02:13:00,270 --> 02:13:04,130
You can also make more incubators for the leftover eggs.

2475
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:05,710
And then just tear them down after.

2476
02:13:05,710 --> 02:13:08,010
Yeah, if we can make a second incubator, that'd probably be
pretty good.

2477
02:13:08,870 --> 02:13:10,550
Don't worry, I'll make it now.

2478
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:12,650
We need cloth and stone.

2479
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:15,170
Can someone get that for us?

2480
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:15,950
Yep.

2481
02:13:17,330 --> 02:13:18,230
I can get more.

2482
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:20,730
I'm in the first area, so I can get more lamb.

2483
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:21,870
What is happening?

2484
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:24,090
Get some stone now.

2485
02:13:27,530 --> 02:13:29,710
We're on our way to get $500.

2486
02:13:31,310 --> 02:13:32,910
Guys, we already have $500.

2487
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:36,410
If we're last place right now, we're already at $500.

2488
02:13:37,490 --> 02:13:38,530
Shit, man.

2489

Yeah, let me grab this.

Does that mean all of us must have 10?

2503
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:04,440
We all have to catch them.

2504
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:06,120
Oh, we can just drop pals.

2505
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:08,900
It says Dropping pals.

2506
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:10,020

Okay, what do I need to do?

2520
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,060
Okay, I need to build the NKBA.

2521
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:37,220
Guys, I still need stone.

2522
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:40,600
Wait, who the fuck used up all the stone that I just put
away?

2523
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:43,600
Large, pelvic.

2524
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:46,720
Who used all the stone that I literally just got for us?

2525
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:47,340
Wait, what?

2526
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:52,440
I literally put in like 18 stone, now there's zero.

2527
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:55,380
Where the fuck are you going, motherfucker?

2528
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:03,460
Last player's gang.

2529
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,100
No, but we're playing a long game.

2530
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:06,240
We're playing a long game.

2531
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:07,040
We have a plan.

2532
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:10,500
Oh, if we want to upgrade to level 13.

2533
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:13,040
How do I get him to work?

2534
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:23,580
If you can make us the fluffy pal bed two of them, then we
can be level 13.

2535
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,480
I'm making the egg incubator.

2536
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:26,380
That's literally all we need.

2537
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:29,520
It's a level 24 recipe.

2538
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:32,600
It's the plan to be last place.

2539
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:34,760
Make two fluffy palettes.

2540
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:36,760
All right.

2541
02:16:37,220 --> 02:16:37,580
I hash.

2542
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:40,000
We got a Knox right now.

2543
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:41,960
I'm making the other egg incubator.

2544
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:44,320
We need more cloth.

2545
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:45,620
And then I can make it.

2546
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:47,960
I'm going to try and find a good moss.

2547
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:55,300
Oh, we can make like 139 cloth.

2548
02:16:56,060 --> 02:16:57,220
So I'm going to do that.

2549
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:58,280
Do it now.

2550
02:16:58,720 --> 02:16:59,660
Do it now.

2551
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:00,160
Wow.

2552
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:02,600
Okay, what did I want to do?

2553
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:03,760
I already forgot where I was.

2554
02:17:03,860 --> 02:17:04,560
Oh yeah, Gumas.

2555
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:05,800
Where the fuck is Gumas?

2556
02:17:06,140 --> 02:17:09,240
I'm still trying to figure out where he is.

2557
02:17:10,140 --> 02:17:11,020
Boss map.

2558
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:12,760
Pal world boss map.

2559
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:13,100
There you go.

2560
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:14,580
All alpha boss locations.

2561
02:17:15,480 --> 02:17:15,880
Oh, wait.

2562
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:16,700
Just the alpha boss?

2563
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:17,960
Fucking finally, bro.

2564
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:18,760
Okay.

2565
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:20,620
All right, Anubis.

2566
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:21,440
Gumas.

2567
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:22,940
Where are you?

2568
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:23,880
Gumas.

2569
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:25,620
Worse sec.

2571
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,280
No, I need Gumas.

2572
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:29,740
Okay.

2573
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:31,220
I'll go get a walk.

2574
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:33,160
Okay, Dumas is right here.

2575
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:35,100
Okay, I figured it out.

2576
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:36,700
Alright, I'm gonna head over.

2577
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:40,700

Achievement list.

2579
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:49,500
Dumas?

2580
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:50,400
What's Dumas?

2581
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,360
What's Dumas?

2582
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:55,400
I don't even know what these bosses are.

2583
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:56,340
Dumas?

2584
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:58,420
Oh, it's like, I love him.

2585
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:01,160
He's like this cool, dumb-looking fish dude.

2586
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:01,960
Oh, man.

2587
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:03,840
He's so stupid looking.

2588
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:04,680
I think I know what you're talking about.

2589
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:05,040
Yeah.

2590
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:05,380
Yeah.

02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:07,200
Yeah.

2593
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:12,120
The moment you said the dumb looking fish guy, I'm like,
quite excited.

2594
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:12,980
Oh my God.

2595
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,680
He looks like he has no brain cells.

2596
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:16,540
You're not wrong, though.

2597
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:19,040
Uh, where is Dummit?

2598
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:20,720

2602
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:24,280

2604
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:29,280
Yeah, I can probably take on the Dummit.

2605
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:31,320

Alright.

2622
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:28,060
When do you gotta start capturing?

2623
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:29,140
I can kill bosses.

2624
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:30,480
True.

2625
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:31,800

2626
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:33,220
Start capturing.

You're doing fantastic.

2631
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:42,300
I'm going to make some balls.

2632
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:45,180
I'm trying to find Goumas.

2633
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:48,620

Capturing Goumas.

Yeah, we're just leveling enough to just kill the bosses
back to back.

02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:57,140
Yeah, exactly.

2639
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:59,480
But I forgot to.

2640
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:00,920
See, that's what I'm saying.

2641
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:01,920
It's tortoise and the hare.

2642
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:04,140
We've been taking our time, getting everything ready.

2643
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:07,320
Alright, he's over here.

2644
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:08,360
Like, this is organized.

2645
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:10,840
I'm just gonna use him.

2646
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:13,360
Oops.

2647
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:14,200

2655
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:30,980
I'm downgraded to a material fetcher.

2656
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:34,760
You know your purpose.

2657
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:35,800
You know it.

2658
02:20:36,140 --> 02:20:37,840
I have found my purpose.

2659
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:40,420

Oh, he's past the bamboo.

2729
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:28,280
I'm not fucking catching that.

2730
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:29,220
That's way too far.

2731
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:31,120
All right, I'm just gonna go for Pen King then.

2732
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:33,540
There's another guy on this, like, lake in the middle of the
ocean, though.

2733
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:34,160
Oh, my God.

2734
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,440
It's on a respawn timer right now.

2735
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:36,300
Oh, still?

2736
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:37,020
What?

2737
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:38,320
Probably.

2738
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:39,080
Grinto.

2739
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:39,920
What?

2740
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:44,040
Grintel location.

2741
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,400
Yeah, the lag is...

2742
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:51,300
I'm just material, boy.

2743
02:23:52,660 --> 02:23:54,120
It's better this way.

2744
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:56,460
I can't even fly a freaking pile, man.

2745
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:57,820
Oh, no.

2746
02:23:58,260 --> 02:23:59,940
I figure out where he is, okay.

2747
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:02,180
Let me...

2748
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:03,920
Oh, God, that Lunaris is level 32.

2749
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:05,080
Maybe not.

2750
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:08,880
Don't worry, we won't forget.

2751
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:11,540
We can take the photo any time.

2752
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:22,000
we can take it any time guys do not worry i'm just gonna
kill this guy though i'm not worrying yeah see everybody's

2753
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:27,180
worrying that we're not doing like the baby things right now
like we're doing the hard work yeah we're playing along no

2754
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:33,980
one's believing us what the heck man the base level was like
i don't know how many points but seems like a lot of points

2755
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:44,840
oh my god already right i think we made so many oh my god
that was way too many I don't feel like walking all the way

2756
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:45,360
back.

2757
02:24:46,060 --> 02:24:46,620
Made too many wood.

2758
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:51,000
No, there's like so much wood that I immediately became
over-encumbered.

2759
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:51,620
It's like a foul.

2760
02:24:51,820 --> 02:24:51,940
Oh, yeah.

2761
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:53,460
Woof.

2762
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:54,620
Okay, I'll put this back here.

2763
02:24:56,860 --> 02:24:57,380
It's alright.

2764
02:24:58,020 --> 02:24:59,320
Guys, you're supposed to believe in us.

2765
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:00,520
Like you said, not aesthetics.

2766
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:07,520
I'm just going to catch these random pals for levels.

2767
02:25:11,270 --> 02:25:11,450
Alright.

2768
02:25:11,870 --> 02:25:12,550
Like, I can live...

2769
02:25:12,550 --> 02:25:15,050
I'm almost close to a level 30 chicken, guys.

2770
02:25:15,250 --> 02:25:16,030
Believe in us.

2771
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:16,850
Let's go.

2772
02:25:17,490 --> 02:25:19,650
Well, I mean, you have to be, you know what, it's, yeah,
it's fine.

2773
02:25:20,330 --> 02:25:21,410
I'm so close.

2774
02:25:22,770 --> 02:25:23,750
Okay, let's see.

2775
02:25:23,870 --> 02:25:25,910
Do we have no pals that are picking stuff up?

2776
02:25:26,270 --> 02:25:26,990
Oh my god.

2777
02:25:27,170 --> 02:25:28,390
I'm not in charge of bases.

2778
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:30,790
That stuff really works.

2779
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:32,830
Yeah, that's terrible.

2780
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:34,550
We also have, like, two of them.

2781
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:38,710
We have the Liz Monk and Vixie just stuck downstairs the
whole time.

2782
02:25:39,770 --> 02:25:40,930
Yeah, I think it's this way.

2783
02:25:41,150 --> 02:25:44,470
I'm looking at the map to make sure where the fuck this
place is.

2784
02:25:49,090 --> 02:25:49,870
Where am I?

2785
02:25:50,150 --> 02:25:52,250
Oh my god, I need...

2786
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:53,950
Fox, tell me where I am.

2787
02:25:56,150 --> 02:25:57,270
Help me.

2788
02:26:01,990 --> 02:26:03,990
How much high quality pal oil you get?

2789
02:26:06,210 --> 02:26:06,770
Uh...

2790
02:26:06,770 --> 02:26:08,030
Only regular pal fluids.

2791
02:26:09,210 --> 02:26:10,310
Dammit drops it, I think.

2792
02:26:10,310 --> 02:26:11,550
Selen might have some.

2793
02:26:11,650 --> 02:26:12,270
Fuck me.

2794
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:14,070
Jokey might have some.

2795
02:26:22,190 --> 02:26:34,270

2798
02:26:52,750 --> 02:26:54,930

2799
02:27:04,230 --> 02:27:05,170
Where is this guy?

02:27:07,830 --> 02:27:08,910

2802
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:10,610
Where is this guy?

2803
02:27:12,830 --> 02:27:13,350
Grintail.

2804
02:27:14,790 --> 02:27:14,950
Okay.

2805
02:27:16,210 --> 02:27:19,930
Oh, he drops high quality power oil to a fellow Grintail
member.

2806
02:27:20,170 --> 02:27:20,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2807
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:22,910

Keep swimming.

2815
02:28:30,970 --> 02:28:34,410
If you die in the water, does that make the price go up for
like the gamer?

2816
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:35,490
Like, I'm just like...

2817
02:28:35,490 --> 02:28:36,610
Well, it's the ocean.

2818
02:28:38,130 --> 02:28:39,010
Ah, diluted.

2819
02:28:39,350 --> 02:28:39,770
Please!

2820
02:28:39,990 --> 02:28:40,790
I should be able to.

2821
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:43,110
I should have enough HP to live through this.

2822
02:28:44,130 --> 02:28:46,450
Oh, I do not have enough HP to live through this.

2823
02:28:47,270 --> 02:28:48,070
Oh, no.

2824
02:28:48,830 --> 02:28:49,510
Oh, no.

2825
02:28:49,510 --> 02:28:50,070
There was hope.

2826
02:28:51,070 --> 02:28:51,510
Briefly.

2827
02:28:52,050 --> 02:28:53,330
There was brief hope.

2828
02:28:53,490 --> 02:28:55,270
There was brief hope.

2829
02:28:57,230 --> 02:28:59,690
No, I'm almost at the island, too!

2830
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:04,370
Oh, wait, wait, wait, I can crawl.

2831
02:29:05,130 --> 02:29:06,290
I can crawl to land.

2832
02:29:06,850 --> 02:29:09,350
Pain, misery, absolution.

2833
02:29:09,630 --> 02:29:10,450
Can I crawl to...

2834
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:10,990
I can't.

2835
02:29:11,190 --> 02:29:12,190
Oh, I'm just dead.

2836
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:13,930
Wait, unless...

2837
02:29:13,930 --> 02:29:14,430
Wait, I can!

2838
02:29:15,250 --> 02:29:16,650
I can crawl to land!

2839
02:29:17,790 --> 02:29:19,050
It'll be fine.

2840
02:29:23,460 --> 02:29:25,700
And then she slowly dies on land.

2841
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:26,320
No!

2842
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:27,880
My idol!

2843
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,840
So I was like, don't give up!

2844
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:34,600
I think I might give up right here.

2845
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:38,760
I didn't know how to get to- I was lost!

2846
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:40,860
And I got so lost!

2847
02:29:42,820 --> 02:29:43,360
Oh no.

2848
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:45,340
Ugh.

2849
02:29:45,460 --> 02:29:46,720
It's okay, I can find my items.

2850
02:29:47,260 --> 02:29:49,540
I just need to crawl to land right now.

2851
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:53,700
Bro, I swear I just brought so much to the base and now it's
all gone.

2852
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:53,820
Let's go.

2853
02:29:53,980 --> 02:29:54,620
What did it go?

2854
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:57,360
Did someone pick up the Nightwing Saddle?

2855
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:58,340
Nope.

2856
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:01,600
Guys, I found the island.

2857
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,420
Stone, I mean, not...

2858
02:30:04,420 --> 02:30:06,000
I can get my items back.

2859
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:07,880
Because I'm on land now.

2860
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:09,540
I can get my items.

2861
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:12,760
I was like, how do you get lost when you have a map?

2862
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:14,750
I just wanted to get there faster!

2863
02:30:21,990 --> 02:30:23,410
All the stone is gone!

2864
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:27,010
Oh shit, I can respawn here!

2865
02:30:27,970 --> 02:30:29,870
Yeah, I'd be using the stone to make balls.

2866
02:30:31,430 --> 02:30:32,190
Oh my god.

2867
02:30:33,710 --> 02:30:36,030
My whole life, I've been working for these stones.

2868
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:37,410
Oh my god, okay.

2869
02:30:38,110 --> 02:30:39,270
I figured it out.

2870
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:41,610
That's fucking capitalism.

2871
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:42,710
Stone cold.

2872
02:30:43,890 --> 02:30:45,350
Guys, I'm a little cold right now.

2873
02:30:45,630 --> 02:30:47,510
I lost my shirt.

2874
02:30:50,030 --> 02:30:51,810
Okay, I need to replace my wolf.

2875
02:30:52,970 --> 02:30:54,230
I don't need you anymore.

2876
02:30:54,650 --> 02:30:55,850
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom right back.

2877
02:30:56,490 --> 02:30:57,050
Good luck.

2878
02:30:57,210 --> 02:30:57,410
Yeah.

2879
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:58,750
Don't fall in.

2880
02:30:59,170 --> 02:31:00,390
Don't forget to check your balls.

2881
02:31:02,390 --> 02:31:03,910
Check before you get wrecked.

2882
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:07,330
Oh shit, Dyerwolf's okay.

2883
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:08,650
I only get my first Dyerwolf.

2884
02:31:09,330 --> 02:31:10,470
Oh yeah, that's stone here.

2885
02:31:10,750 --> 02:31:11,130
Nice.

2886
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:13,090
Wait, you know what?

2887
02:31:13,210 --> 02:31:14,730
I can make this so much faster.

2888
02:31:16,970 --> 02:31:19,230
Oh my god, did you just one shot him?

2889
02:31:19,770 --> 02:31:20,770
What's wrong with you?

2890
02:31:24,050 --> 02:31:25,370
My pals are too aggressive.

2891
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:33,340
That's like the worst part is like you get to a certain
like...

2892
02:31:33,340 --> 02:31:38,000
That's one thing that Nintendo did right with Pokemon is
that you get to a certain level and it just makes it so you

2893
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,840
can catch stuff easier without like the lift monks.

2894
02:31:40,940 --> 02:31:44,680
Because all my pals just one-shot everything and then it's
like impossible

2895
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:54,800
Can anyone like does anyone have a quill burn on them right
now and can they give it to me?

2896
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:55,160
Uh-uh.

2897
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:57,740
Oh, no, I just want a quill burn.

2898
02:31:58,760 --> 02:31:59,420
What is a quill burn?

2899
02:31:59,860 --> 02:32:08,060
The the fire not fire but one of the the dragons for flight
Sure forking can you just cancel my saddle?

2900
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:11,640

There's like so many games out of Japan where they have like
a petting feature Whether it's like for animals or for

2936
02:35:35,970 --> 02:35:40,370
people question mark, but like they just you they just
remove that feature.

2937
02:35:40,570 --> 02:35:41,410
It's not manly enough.

2938
02:35:41,770 --> 02:35:41,990
Why?

2939
02:35:42,030 --> 02:35:44,810

02:35:56,730 --> 02:35:57,490
Oh, no.

2947
02:35:57,910 --> 02:35:59,570

2949
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:02,630
Yeah.

2950
02:36:05,950 --> 02:36:06,550
All right.

2951
02:36:06,710 --> 02:36:08,810
I died, but at least I died where I wanted to be.

2952
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:11,290
Out of the fucking water.

2953
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:20,000

2954
02:36:24,890 --> 02:36:31,850

fucking breaking point it's gonna go so fast.

2955
02:36:32,070 --> 02:36:33,830
Once we start petting the pals we're gonna be in first.

2956
02:36:34,270 --> 02:36:44,170
Yeah yeah like you guys might be like wow you guys are only
12 but because this is a long game trust the process yeah

2957
02:36:46,410 --> 02:36:50,090
remember We built the foundation for a sturdy house.

2958
02:36:50,250 --> 02:36:51,530
I was like, trust the process.

2959
02:36:51,690 --> 02:36:53,050
I'm like, where am I?

2960
02:36:55,310 --> 02:36:56,650
No, enough about that.

2961
02:36:57,410 --> 02:36:58,950
Now you trust the process.

2962
02:36:59,090 --> 02:37:00,270
I figured out where I am.

2963
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:05,170

2968
02:37:15,070 --> 02:37:15,630
Oh, shit.

2969
02:37:15,790 --> 02:37:16,610
That's a...

2970
02:37:17,230 --> 02:37:18,510
Oh, he's level 70.

2971
02:37:18,530 --> 02:37:20,090
Wait, he's level 17.

2972
02:37:23,730 --> 02:37:25,870
Oh, you don't have to...

2973
02:37:28,270 --> 02:37:30,330
Oh my god, you're level 10!

2974
02:37:30,490 --> 02:37:31,550
I didn't even realize!

2975
02:37:32,050 --> 02:37:32,310
Okay.

2976
02:37:32,430 --> 02:37:32,950
You kill him?

2977
02:37:33,270 --> 02:37:36,270
No, no, I meant like my fucking wolf is level 10.

2978
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:38,230
It's okay, I got chill tail.

2979
02:37:38,790 --> 02:37:41,410
Yeah, because I forgot I killed the other one accidentally.

2980
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:43,030
Uh...

2981
02:37:43,030 --> 02:37:45,030
You don't lose your pals when you die.

2982
02:37:45,370 --> 02:37:47,690
No, but he died because I drowned him accidentally.

2983
02:37:48,170 --> 02:37:50,010
Oh, she's putting him in the rehabilitation.

2984
02:37:51,210 --> 02:37:51,650
Oops.

2985
02:37:53,770 --> 02:37:55,910
So I have to replace him for a little bit.

2986
02:37:57,490 --> 02:37:58,390
Go chillin' go.

2987
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:02,510

I'm just gonna go grab one of the shitty pigeons from the
start.

2991
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:13,150

02:38:14,470 --> 02:38:15,970

2993
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:17,410

Oh, okay, cool.

3010
02:39:01,890 --> 02:39:03,330
Well, not my fault.

I caught two more humans.

3012
02:39:06,010 --> 02:39:06,290
Nice.

3013
02:39:12,610 --> 02:39:13,950
More balls, less shields.

3014
02:39:14,970 --> 02:39:15,350
That's right.

3015
02:39:15,590 --> 02:39:16,750
I'm going to make a shield.

3016
02:39:17,450 --> 02:39:19,090
Oh, please don't get involved.

3017
02:39:20,210 --> 02:39:24,630
Look at our base is so laggy There's just too much stuff
going on.

3018
02:39:24,730 --> 02:39:26,070
We have so much shit.

3019
02:39:26,210 --> 02:39:26,710
Oh my god

3020
02:39:30,990 --> 02:39:38,690
Lord Because none of the pals are picking up the items so
our base is just like it's time for you to pick it up.

3021
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:43,430
It's in shambles Okay, come on.

3032
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:04,190

02:52:14,480 --> 02:52:15,680
PP, can you pick me up?

3234
02:52:15,820 --> 02:52:17,700
Yeah, wait, wait, pick you up from where?

3235
02:52:17,860 --> 02:52:18,100
Pick me up.

3236
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:18,880
I'm downed.

3237
02:52:19,960 --> 02:52:21,160
Oh, shit, where are you?

3238
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:21,840
Well, let me find you.

3239
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,620
I'm where the van worms are.

3240
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:24,220
Please.

3241
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:25,320
Okay.

3242
02:52:26,220 --> 02:52:27,100
My wolf killed.

3243
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:29,100
No, my wolf killed them.

3244
02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:30,280
No!

3245
02:52:33,790 --> 02:52:34,770
PP, please.

3246
02:52:35,650 --> 02:52:36,970
I'm just catching these men.

3247
02:52:37,890 --> 02:52:39,370
Never mind, I'm gonna give up.

3248
02:52:40,230 --> 02:52:41,790
I don't think I can reach you in time.

3249
02:52:41,930 --> 02:52:43,690
I'm gonna give up.

3250
02:52:43,690 --> 02:52:44,110
No!

3251
02:52:46,750 --> 02:52:48,970
My wolf killed him too!

3252
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:51,730
Was it a shiny?

3253
02:52:52,110 --> 02:52:54,290
No, I just wanted a van worm.

3254
02:52:55,230 --> 02:52:55,410
Oh.

3255
02:52:58,750 --> 02:52:59,190
Okay.

3256
02:52:59,790 --> 02:53:00,990
See, where did I die?

3257
02:53:01,790 --> 02:53:02,750
It wasn't so far.

3258
02:53:05,790 --> 02:53:07,110
Why am I gonna open a window?

3259
02:53:07,310 --> 02:53:08,670
Holy shit, it's hot in my room.

3260
02:53:10,210 --> 02:53:10,650
Passion.

3261
02:53:12,090 --> 02:53:14,430
Catching run rooms is a struggle.

3262
02:53:14,650 --> 02:53:15,870
It's stressful, man.

3263
02:53:17,250 --> 02:53:19,050
I'm just trying to catch humans.

3264
02:53:22,070 --> 02:53:22,670
Alright, you know what?

3265
02:53:23,050 --> 02:53:23,610
Go out there, dude.

3266
02:53:23,790 --> 02:53:23,930
Alright.

3267
02:53:25,210 --> 02:53:26,510
Get in the ball!

3268
02:53:28,270 --> 02:53:29,050
Where the fuck?

3269
02:53:29,210 --> 02:53:30,930
Oh my god, I was getting shot at.

3270
02:53:32,570 --> 02:53:33,010
Please.

3271
02:53:36,090 --> 02:53:36,410
Why?

3272
02:53:37,050 --> 02:53:38,590
Why is this man refusing?

3273
02:53:38,750 --> 02:53:39,410
Get in the ball!

3274
02:53:40,650 --> 02:53:41,910
Did you ask him nicely?

3275
02:53:42,270 --> 02:53:43,090
Get in the ball, man.

3276
02:53:44,670 --> 02:53:47,410
Yeah, he clearly didn't consent to this.

3277
02:53:49,070 --> 02:53:49,350
Sentient.

3278
02:53:49,830 --> 02:53:50,950
Sentient invisible gun.

3279
02:53:51,250 --> 02:53:52,730
He clearly didn't consent to it.

3280
02:53:53,210 --> 02:53:54,170
Pretty, pretty please.

3281
02:53:54,530 --> 02:53:56,870
Can I put you in my human circus?

3282
02:53:58,130 --> 02:53:59,130
Human circus?

3283
02:53:59,310 --> 02:54:00,110
We have like 20.

3284
02:54:00,370 --> 02:54:00,750
Thank you.

3285
02:54:01,290 --> 02:54:04,950
Isn't that, wait, isn't that one of the goals that we have
to put them in like a little cage?

3286
02:54:05,290 --> 02:54:05,610
We need 20.

3287
02:54:06,530 --> 02:54:08,130
That's why I was like, do we have 20?

3288
02:54:10,470 --> 02:54:12,670
I just caught 2 or 3, I think.

3289
02:54:13,610 --> 02:54:16,930
I have, like, I have, like, 3?

3290
02:54:17,170 --> 02:54:18,510
I think 3 or 2 on me.

3291
02:54:19,890 --> 02:54:20,110
Hmm.

3292
02:54:22,710 --> 02:54:24,790
Now I need to find a fucking bambworm again.

3293
02:54:26,130 --> 02:54:27,450
God damn it.

3294
02:54:29,390 --> 02:54:30,670
Oh, I wish I had to chill it.

3295
02:54:30,750 --> 02:54:32,030
Then I could, like, swim over there.

3296
02:54:32,110 --> 02:54:35,350
I really need to get some pal that can do logistics.

3297
02:54:36,650 --> 02:54:37,090
Oh, for real?

3298
02:54:37,270 --> 02:54:37,330
I don't need it.

3299
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:38,010
I don't need it.

3300
02:54:39,050 --> 02:54:39,450
Sweet.

3301
02:54:39,550 --> 02:54:40,550
Yeah, just need it.

3302
02:54:41,110 --> 02:54:42,070
Next time we're at the base.

3303
02:54:43,190 --> 02:54:44,390
Yeah, I'll just put it in the thing.

3304
02:54:45,070 --> 02:54:46,470
Yeah, I'll grab it.

3305
02:54:46,710 --> 02:54:47,170
Thank you.

3306
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:48,370
It's a bad worm.

3307
02:54:49,910 --> 02:54:51,110

3308
02:54:53,730 --> 02:54:54,030
Boom.

3309
02:54:56,030 --> 02:54:58,990
Okay, I hope for now we have enough rock.

We have 800 rock.

3311
02:55:02,630 --> 02:55:04,630
It's gonna have to amount to something right here.

3312
02:55:05,010 --> 02:55:05,550
It has to be.

3313
02:55:06,350 --> 02:55:07,030
It has to.

3314
02:55:07,110 --> 02:55:09,510

Where the fuck is our fire?

We're the fuck over fire ones.

3390
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:54,160
Uh...

3391
02:59:55,580 --> 02:59:56,580
Let's see.

3392
02:59:58,860 --> 02:59:59,920
It's okay to just...

3393
02:59:59,940 --> 03:00:01,160
Trust the process, man.

3394
03:00:01,280 --> 03:00:01,640
It's okay.

3395
03:00:02,140 --> 03:00:03,400
Just trust the process.

3396
03:00:03,660 --> 03:00:04,640
Just trust the process.

3397
03:00:06,060 --> 03:00:11,400
No, when you keep saying trust the process, I'm starting to
trust the process less and less.

3398
03:00:14,840 --> 03:00:17,240
That's when you got to trust the process even more.

3399
03:00:17,900 --> 03:00:18,940
Wait, does Vamworm do fire?

3400
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:20,420
Oh, shit, it does.

3401
03:00:20,660 --> 03:00:21,380
Get out of here.

3402
03:00:21,640 --> 03:00:23,780
I didn't even realize Vamworms are fire.

3403
03:00:23,900 --> 03:00:24,980
I don't care what fuck about you.

3404
03:00:27,160 --> 03:00:27,860
What kind of fire?

3405
03:00:28,040 --> 03:00:29,100
What level fire is it?

3406
03:00:29,940 --> 03:00:32,400
but our other ones aren't kindling it right now.

3407
03:00:37,770 --> 03:00:38,810
All right, do your thing.

3408
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:39,830
I need...

3409
03:00:39,830 --> 03:00:41,130

3413
03:00:46,250 --> 03:00:48,770

I can probably go fight Pen King now if he's respawned.

3446
03:03:10,270 --> 03:03:11,050
He's probably respawned.

3447
03:03:11,050 --> 03:03:11,810
He probably is.

3448
03:03:11,870 --> 03:03:12,970
It's been like two hours.

3449
03:03:13,250 --> 03:03:15,210
He's probably almost three hours.

3450
03:03:15,470 --> 03:03:16,350
He's probably back.

3451
03:03:17,250 --> 03:03:17,350
Yeah.

3452
03:03:18,010 --> 03:03:18,330
Yeah.

3453
03:03:18,570 --> 03:03:19,410
Is there a hatching list?

3454
03:03:19,470 --> 03:03:20,330
There's no hatching list.

3455
03:03:20,470 --> 03:03:21,030
I'm pretty sure.

3456
03:03:21,390 --> 03:03:21,730

3457
03:03:21,870 --> 03:03:22,090

03:03:23,350 --> 03:03:25,190
I don't think there's an achievement for hatching.

3461
03:03:25,850 --> 03:03:29,230
There's only four things we need to hatch that give us.

3462
03:03:29,390 --> 03:03:30,070
Don't touch that.

3463

03:15:50,710 --> 03:15:51,790
I was juicy.

3674
03:15:52,870 --> 03:15:53,090
Dang!

3675
03:15:55,570 --> 03:15:57,550

3679
03:16:03,190 --> 03:16:07,610

3680
03:16:07,790 --> 03:16:07,890
Ew.

The ravine dungeon?

3694
03:16:36,930 --> 03:16:37,930
If someone can find them.

3695
03:16:38,030 --> 03:16:39,290
Yeah, we need to find the ravine dungeon.

3696
03:16:39,310 --> 03:16:39,710

We have to find it.

3708
03:17:08,030 --> 03:17:09,410

03:18:38,810 --> 03:18:40,830
Okay, why are these tiles so fucking worthless?

3728
03:18:41,270 --> 03:18:42,810
Still fire piles.

3729
03:18:43,050 --> 03:18:45,290
Why are these tiles so fucking worthless?

3730
03:18:46,070 --> 03:18:46,590

Don't push them too far, dude.

3736

We don't have the butcher knife.

3737
03:18:59,390 --> 03:19:00,350
We can't hide the evidence.

3738
03:19:05,010 --> 03:19:06,930
Butchering pals is not an exploit.

3739
03:19:07,190 --> 03:19:08,290
It is above board.

3740
03:19:09,690 --> 03:19:10,690
I mean, they know what they did.

3741
03:19:12,970 --> 03:19:14,730
It's more like what they didn't do.

3742
03:19:15,150 --> 03:19:22,610
Isn't one of the achievements is all of us have to butcher a

03:19:57,490 --> 03:19:58,170
But I think it is.

3751
03:20:00,030 --> 03:20:02,570

3752
03:20:04,310 --> 03:20:04,870
Reveen Grotto.

3780
03:21:44,940 --> 03:21:47,440
Make sure the dungeon doesn't despawn though.

3781
03:21:47,520 --> 03:21:49,340
It has like a specific time to despawn.

3782
03:21:49,520 --> 03:21:49,860
Oh, okay.

3783
03:21:50,560 --> 03:21:50,980
Let me see.

3784
03:21:59,680 --> 03:22:12,460
little little because I know it does despawn yeah okay what
happened to it despawns though like the holes we know it

3785
03:22:12,460 --> 03:22:23,380
just we have to find another oh for real yeah because
there's like a timer oh that sucks okay um the amount of

3786
03:22:23,380 --> 03:22:29,520
time we have until this I found a large scorching egg oh we
got we got a ton of time it's like two minutes.

3787
03:22:29,740 --> 03:22:30,040
Okay, nice.

3788
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:30,800
Easy.

3789
03:22:32,520 --> 03:22:33,700
I have a large scorching egg.

3790
03:22:33,840 --> 03:22:34,720
Do we have time to hatch it?

3791
03:22:35,200 --> 03:22:35,600
Yeah.

3792
03:22:36,120 --> 03:22:36,400
All right.

3793
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:38,740
I found a huge scorching egg.

3794
03:22:38,820 --> 03:22:40,820
Okay, we should hatch that first, then.

3795
03:22:41,120 --> 03:22:43,360
Even if we don't, we can set it and it will still cook.

3796
03:22:43,420 --> 03:22:44,020
I found Quiver.

3797
03:22:44,100 --> 03:22:44,920
I'm going to kill this.

3798
03:22:44,920 --> 03:22:46,180
While we're not around.

3799
03:22:46,420 --> 03:22:47,460
It will still cook.

3800
03:22:48,020 --> 03:22:48,180
Yeah.

3801
03:22:48,640 --> 03:22:50,280
I should hold down cooking it.

3802
03:22:50,880 --> 03:22:51,960
Technically, that's not against the rules.

3803
03:22:52,820 --> 03:22:55,540
Wait, is Quiver in the list?

3804
03:22:58,320 --> 03:23:01,520
See, Uh, it is.

3805
03:23:01,640 --> 03:23:03,940
Okay, I'm gonna go catch her at the quiverin right now.

3806
03:23:07,160 --> 03:23:08,300

3807
03:23:08,380 --> 03:23:08,900
Let's go.

3808
03:23:17,080 --> 03:23:18,280

3814
03:23:32,280 --> 03:23:32,920
Oh, shit!

3815
03:23:33,340 --> 03:23:34,360
I don't think I'll be fine.

3816
03:23:39,700 --> 03:23:40,160
Come on.

3817
03:23:43,860 --> 03:23:44,840
Oh, I don't have arrows.

3818
03:23:44,960 --> 03:23:46,680

Oh no, I'm too strong.

3823
03:23:59,520 --> 03:23:59,960
He's dead.

3824
03:24:00,420 --> 03:24:00,660

3825
03:24:00,860 --> 03:24:01,300

this location, you'll be pretty much there.

3834
03:24:21,640 --> 03:24:22,480

My chat says that our ranking has not been updated.

03:24:57,140 --> 03:24:59,600
Well, to be fair, we haven't really been doing any
achievements.

3844
03:24:59,940 --> 03:25:01,220
We've just been, like, progressing.

3845

3855
03:26:00,040 --> 03:26:02,600

quality of work.

3856
03:26:02,800 --> 03:26:02,800

03:28:52,770 --> 03:28:52,990
Okay.

3916
03:28:53,110 --> 03:28:53,890
So we need to take a picture.

3917
03:28:56,430 --> 03:29:00,210
We're at the one hour mark so we have to like speed run,
start speed running now.

3918
03:29:02,270 --> 03:29:03,230
It's bedding hours.

3919
03:29:03,370 --> 03:29:04,590
Trying to find the entrance again.

3920
03:29:04,590 --> 03:29:07,990
At least I marked it on my map, but it's to the right.

3921
03:29:08,290 --> 03:29:08,950
It's over.

3922
03:29:10,070 --> 03:29:10,990
This way.

3923
03:29:11,550 --> 03:29:12,390
I'm just following you.

3924
03:29:12,550 --> 03:29:13,750
It's like this way.

3925
03:29:14,490 --> 03:29:16,290
It says we have to complete it together.

3926
03:29:18,670 --> 03:29:19,330
I'm coming.

3927
03:29:22,890 --> 03:29:23,790
Oh, it's dark now.

3928
03:29:24,090 --> 03:29:24,350
Hold on.

3929
03:29:27,290 --> 03:29:29,190
Okay, it's over this way.

3930
03:29:31,170 --> 03:29:34,390
I'm going to catch five humans with level 10 or higher.

3931
03:29:34,470 --> 03:29:36,030
I have two humans that are level 10.

3932
03:29:37,010 --> 03:29:40,410
Oh Yeah, didn't you guys have little ten humans?

3933
03:29:40,870 --> 03:29:43,550
There's a bunch of syndicates over here that we can catch.

3934
03:29:43,830 --> 03:29:51,010
Yeah, we can do that later then All right, and then it's
over here It's around this ridge somewhere So do we just

3935
03:29:51,010 --> 03:29:52,010
have to complete the dungeon?

3936
03:29:52,250 --> 03:29:54,550
I can't really see the person in the dungeon.

3937
03:29:55,190 --> 03:29:55,970
We have to complete it.

3938
03:29:56,070 --> 03:30:00,390
It's just complete a ravine So we need to speed run and get
to the egg end.

3939
03:30:00,710 --> 03:30:01,150
It's over.

3940
03:30:01,290 --> 03:30:02,350
Does anybody have a fire pal?

3941
03:30:02,650 --> 03:30:02,790

3942
03:30:03,150 --> 03:30:06,850
Yeah, I actually didn't bring any Oh, here it is.

3943
03:30:06,990 --> 03:30:07,330

3944
03:30:07,530 --> 03:30:08,130
It's right here.

3945
03:30:08,130 --> 03:30:08,470
It's right here.

3946
03:30:11,310 --> 03:30:12,130
Reveen Grotto.

3947
03:30:13,410 --> 03:30:13,910

03:30:20,670 --> 03:30:21,550
Okay, okay, okay.

3954
03:30:21,970 --> 03:30:24,110

4006
03:34:50,590 --> 03:34:52,010
Yeah, we have to find the mountain stream.

4007
03:34:52,470 --> 03:34:52,910
I don't know where it is.

4008
03:34:53,250 --> 03:34:53,850
Okay, mountain stream.

4009
03:34:54,330 --> 03:34:55,050

I'm going to go...

4012
03:34:57,710 --> 03:34:58,430
You should...

4013
03:34:58,430 --> 03:34:59,030
Do the thing.

4014
03:34:59,150 --> 03:35:00,550
Yeah, you should start doing bosses.

4015
03:35:02,050 --> 03:35:02,450
All right.

4016
03:35:02,570 --> 03:35:03,650
I know where mountain stream is.

4017
03:35:03,750 --> 03:35:05,350
I'll go search for an entrance.

4018
03:35:05,550 --> 03:35:05,870
Okay.

4019
03:35:06,910 --> 03:35:09,730
I'm just gonna power level the 30 real fast.

4020
03:35:10,150 --> 03:35:10,590
I...

4021
03:35:10,590 --> 03:35:11,510
Oh shit, wait.

4022
03:35:12,710 --> 03:35:14,350
I didn't do that in...

4023
03:35:14,350 --> 03:35:16,210
I'll attempt to level up a little.

4024
03:35:16,310 --> 03:35:17,670
Oh wait, um...

4025
03:35:17,670 --> 03:35:20,370
Lily, can you try and catch level 10 so the ticket thugs?

4026
03:35:21,230 --> 03:35:22,950
We need... I have two on me.

4027
03:35:23,950 --> 03:35:24,850
So we need three more.

4028
03:35:26,210 --> 03:35:27,210
What do we need?

4029
03:35:27,390 --> 03:35:29,190
Level 10... Level 10 humans.

4030
03:35:29,850 --> 03:35:32,150
Let me see what level the humans are that I have at least.

4031
03:35:32,170 --> 03:35:33,650
I have two level 10 humans.

4032
03:35:33,790 --> 03:35:34,070
I'll check.

4033
03:35:35,270 --> 03:35:36,670
You have to catch them at 10?

4034
03:35:36,750 --> 03:35:37,790
Can we just level them?

4035
03:35:38,010 --> 03:35:38,850
Oh, it has to be caught.

4036
03:35:43,010 --> 03:35:46,310
I'm going to go to the beginning and just...

4037
03:35:46,310 --> 03:35:48,110
Actually, do I have enough for the lantern?

4038
03:35:51,150 --> 03:35:51,930
I lantern.

4039
03:35:52,190 --> 03:35:52,610

4040
03:35:53,290 --> 03:35:53,790
Ow, fuck.

4041
03:35:54,010 --> 03:35:54,670
Maybe 13.

4042
03:35:56,310 --> 03:35:57,150
Alright, I got a loot moon.

4043
03:35:58,650 --> 03:36:00,290
I want to craft the lantern.

4044
03:36:04,140 --> 03:36:05,600
Wait, what level do you need to be for the lantern?

4045
03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:07,320
Um...

4046
03:36:08,300 --> 03:36:08,740
No.

4047
03:36:09,800 --> 03:36:10,120
Let's see.

4048
03:36:10,440 --> 03:36:11,240
Level 22.

4049
03:36:12,060 --> 03:36:12,480
Okay, cool.

4050
03:36:12,600 --> 03:36:13,080
I can get a lantern.

4051
03:36:14,720 --> 03:36:14,880
All right.

4052
03:36:15,960 --> 03:36:16,360
Okay.

4053
03:36:18,260 --> 03:36:19,180
Uh, now I can see.

4054
03:36:19,920 --> 03:36:20,300
Oh, wait.

4055
03:36:20,680 --> 03:36:22,740
Has anybody done Bushi yet?

4056
03:36:23,240 --> 03:36:23,600
Bushi?

4057
03:36:23,760 --> 03:36:23,880
No.

4058
03:36:24,080 --> 03:36:24,300
No.

4059
03:36:24,860 --> 03:36:25,020
Okay.

4060
03:36:25,340 --> 03:36:26,720
Is he even one of the things?

4061
03:36:26,820 --> 03:36:27,560
I'm gonna go attempt it.

4062
03:36:27,680 --> 03:36:28,120
Yeah, he is.

4063
03:36:29,480 --> 03:36:30,700
Yeah, I'm gonna go attempt it.

4064
03:36:30,920 --> 03:36:31,640
All right, I'm power leveling.

4065
03:36:37,740 --> 03:36:40,540
Okay, I saved a lot to power level.

4066
03:36:44,170 --> 03:36:45,130
I just need...

4067
03:36:45,130 --> 03:36:46,130
Oh, I'm all out of arrows.

4068
03:36:47,270 --> 03:36:48,310
That probably won't be a problem.

4069
03:36:48,930 --> 03:36:52,890
Oh yeah, sure for you can kill the Mamo swine too, because
we need the meat to make a steak.

4070
03:36:54,790 --> 03:36:55,190
Yeah.

4071
03:36:57,450 --> 03:36:57,850
Okay.

4072
03:37:00,050 --> 03:37:00,450
Shit.

4073
03:37:01,430 --> 03:37:02,190
Go pinking, go.

4074
03:37:02,370 --> 03:37:02,750
Get him.

4075
03:37:02,890 --> 03:37:04,270
Oh my god, my pinking is so small.

4076
03:37:05,630 --> 03:37:06,490
Just a little guy.

4077
03:37:07,370 --> 03:37:08,610
He's just a little guy.

4078
03:37:08,650 --> 03:37:09,270
Just a little guy.

4079
03:37:11,350 --> 03:37:12,070
Oh, true.

4080
03:37:13,670 --> 03:37:14,470
Fucked up, man.

4081
03:37:14,510 --> 03:37:15,310
It's not about the size.

4082
03:37:15,410 --> 03:37:15,970
It's about the power.

4083
03:37:16,150 --> 03:37:16,510
Look at him.

4084
03:37:17,090 --> 03:37:20,010
Yeah, but you're size shaming him right now.

4085
03:37:20,270 --> 03:37:21,010
He's dominating.

4086
03:37:24,090 --> 03:37:25,210
Okay, I'm gonna kill you.

4087
03:37:25,610 --> 03:37:26,010
Let's see.

4088
03:37:26,530 --> 03:37:28,750
We have the five traps for the Lambos yet?

4089
03:37:29,650 --> 03:37:30,110
Uh, no.

4090
03:37:30,330 --> 03:37:31,610
I was waiting for the ingot to be made.

4091
03:37:31,790 --> 03:37:32,170
Oh, okay.

4092
03:37:32,310 --> 03:37:35,030
Because our lazy fire Pokemon don't want to do it.

4093
03:37:35,390 --> 03:37:38,310
I can stay in bays till the ingots are done.

4094
03:37:38,810 --> 03:37:39,730
Because we need 25.

4095
03:37:39,990 --> 03:37:41,370
We need 25 to make the traps.

4096
03:37:41,770 --> 03:37:42,850
Because you need five for trap.

4097
03:37:43,490 --> 03:37:45,070
Like this- If you're doing bear traps.

4098
03:37:45,510 --> 03:37:45,790
Bro!

4099
03:37:45,990 --> 03:37:46,650
There's other traps!

4100
03:37:46,930 --> 03:37:47,850
Walking around!

4101
03:37:48,510 --> 03:37:50,770
Just make another furnace too.

4102
03:37:51,730 --> 03:37:52,350
Make another furnace.

4103
03:37:52,770 --> 03:37:53,990
Yeah, we can make another furnace.

4104
03:37:54,130 --> 03:37:58,830
Yeah, I feel like we could- we could count it with a lot of
time.

4105
03:37:59,810 --> 03:38:00,810
Okay, level 25.

4106
03:38:00,930 --> 03:38:03,090
I need five more levels for my chicken.

4107
03:38:05,970 --> 03:38:06,450
See?

4108
03:38:10,780 --> 03:38:12,260
Get over here, Lambe.

4109
03:38:14,480 --> 03:38:14,960
Alright.

4110
03:38:15,200 --> 03:38:16,940
I'm getting the Gigosphere ready.

4111
03:38:18,040 --> 03:38:18,040
What?

4112
03:38:18,200 --> 03:38:19,060
That's my ball.

4113
03:38:24,790 --> 03:38:25,790
Why are you coming for me, dude?

4114
03:38:26,090 --> 03:38:26,270
No.

4115
03:38:26,670 --> 03:38:27,110
No.

4116
03:38:27,650 --> 03:38:27,870
No.

4117
03:38:27,970 --> 03:38:28,580
Stay away from me.

4118
03:38:31,330 --> 03:38:32,350
Get over here.

4119
03:38:33,150 --> 03:38:35,530
I need as many fucking chickens as I can.

4120
03:38:39,390 --> 03:38:41,430
I need to be level 30.

4121
03:38:45,580 --> 03:38:47,180
I have no arrows, but this is fine.

4122
03:38:47,720 --> 03:38:47,980
That's fine.

4123
03:38:48,160 --> 03:38:48,900
I probably need arrows.

4124
03:38:53,940 --> 03:38:55,080
Or chicken nuggets.

4131
03:39:40,020 --> 03:39:40,340
Traps.

4132
03:39:40,620 --> 03:39:41,380
We can just make a...

4133
03:39:41,380 --> 03:39:42,500
Does it have to be a bear trap?

4134
03:39:42,680 --> 03:39:43,320
Or can it be a hanging trap?

4135
03:39:43,340 --> 03:39:44,160
It has to be a trap.

4136
03:39:44,600 --> 03:39:45,740
It just says...

4137
03:39:45,740 --> 03:39:46,740
Petalia's been caught.

4138
03:39:47,320 --> 03:39:50,720
Wait, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip.

03:39:51,100 --> 03:39:51,760
Yeah, it's just traps.

4140
03:39:51,860 --> 03:39:52,640
Any traps work.

4141
03:39:53,460 --> 03:39:55,060
Okay, then we can just make a hanging trap.

4142
03:39:55,180 --> 03:39:57,740
We need five of them, so 50 what?

4143
03:39:58,520 --> 03:39:59,580

03:40:24,210 --> 03:40:24,750

03:42:54,560 --> 03:42:54,720
Nope.

4193
03:42:56,900 --> 03:42:58,380
I don't think Fangalope's in there.

4194
03:42:58,920 --> 03:42:59,540

Okay.

4221

03:44:59,980 --> 03:45:00,640
This is going to be easy.

4225
03:45:00,820 --> 03:45:01,140
All right.

4226
03:45:01,420 --> 03:45:02,920
We caught five lamb bolts.

4227
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:04,480
I'm going to go catch the humans now.

4228
03:45:04,900 --> 03:45:05,180

Kill a mammoth one.

4239
03:45:24,640 --> 03:45:26,500
The stake is 150 points.

4240
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:27,860
Do it, do it, do it.

4241
03:45:28,600 --> 03:45:29,300

03:45:31,060 --> 03:45:32,980
Wait, what level do we need to be to cook it?

4245
03:45:33,440 --> 03:45:34,020
Any level?

4246
03:45:34,240 --> 03:45:34,460
Yeah.

4247
03:45:34,940 --> 03:45:35,880
Shouldn't be any level?

4248
03:45:35,900 --> 03:45:36,120
Yeah.

4249
03:45:37,460 --> 03:45:38,460

Find you a mammoth.

4252
03:45:41,200 --> 03:45:42,560
There's one in the starting zone.

4253
03:45:42,740 --> 03:45:43,800
Yeah, there's a boss one.

4254
03:45:44,260 --> 03:45:45,500
That one is the boss one.

4255
03:45:46,120 --> 03:45:46,340
Oh, um...

4256
03:45:46,340 --> 03:45:47,580

Wait, I can't...

4258
03:45:48,340 --> 03:45:50,200
I saw a couple of one near me.

4259
03:45:50,560 --> 03:45:52,200
At the start, isn't that one of the bosses?

4260
03:45:52,420 --> 03:45:54,540
Yeah, that's one of the bosses, so...

4261
03:45:54,540 --> 03:45:57,080
I think I know where a couple of men are at spawn.

4262
03:45:57,180 --> 03:45:57,660
I forget that.

4263
03:45:58,380 --> 03:45:59,660
Yeah, I've seen some too.

4264
03:46:01,160 --> 03:46:03,240
Multiple clips that count towards it.

4265
03:46:03,360 --> 03:46:07,380
If I didn't catch them fast enough to make it all just in
one clip, I guess.

4266
03:46:07,480 --> 03:46:07,880
Sure.

4267
03:46:09,480 --> 03:46:14,560
I'm near the waypoint, which means there could be a dungeon
entrance over here somewhere.

4268
03:46:15,580 --> 03:46:17,640
Oh, non-boss one can spawn near the boss.

4269
03:46:19,880 --> 03:46:23,120
Okay, I'm trying to catch these other motherfuckers, though.

4270
03:46:23,900 --> 03:46:24,700
Are you serious?

4271
03:46:24,980 --> 03:46:25,820
They're all dead.

4272
03:46:26,600 --> 03:46:28,420
That sounds like a lot of guns.

4273
03:46:28,800 --> 03:46:30,780
I'm going to fly them out of here.

4274
03:46:30,860 --> 03:46:31,260
I'm too strong.

4275
03:46:31,460 --> 03:46:34,580
I have a mookal for breeding since we need milk.

4276
03:46:36,180 --> 03:46:37,380
I found the entrance.

4277
03:46:37,760 --> 03:46:38,600
We found the entrance here.

Okay, I have one level 10 human.

4287
03:47:44,580 --> 03:47:45,060
How many did we need?

4288
03:47:45,080 --> 03:47:45,900
No, they're all dying.

4289
03:47:46,020 --> 03:47:47,540
They're all being killed by random pals.

4290
03:47:48,840 --> 03:47:49,560
Oh, fuck.

4291
03:47:49,800 --> 03:47:50,800
Oh, no, he's dead.

4292
03:47:51,160 --> 03:47:53,200
Oh, wait.

4293
03:47:53,220 --> 03:47:54,200
They're not being killed by random pals.

4294
03:47:54,280 --> 03:47:55,880
They're being killed by my pals.

4295
03:47:56,160 --> 03:47:56,260
Stupid.

4296
03:47:56,580 --> 03:47:56,980
Oh, no.

4297
03:47:57,720 --> 03:47:58,080
Nice.

4298
03:47:59,200 --> 03:48:00,300
You're doing your part.

4299
03:48:03,080 --> 03:48:03,960
I want to see what it is.

4300
03:48:04,060 --> 03:48:05,440
And here I can...

4301
03:48:06,280 --> 03:48:07,280
What the fuck?

4302
03:48:07,700 --> 03:48:09,040
Oh, Ben, we're really okay?

4303
03:48:10,120 --> 03:48:10,920
My game crashed.

4304
03:48:11,340 --> 03:48:13,200
There's still more people over here, though.

4305
03:48:14,020 --> 03:48:14,940
Somewhere around here.

4306
03:48:16,860 --> 03:48:18,220
I have two level 10 heroes.

4307
03:48:18,240 --> 03:48:21,720
There's like a crap ton of like the Pal Alliance devout
people.

4308
03:48:22,560 --> 03:48:22,820
Wait.

4309
03:48:23,400 --> 03:48:29,680
We don't have the clip of the traps in our team thing.

4310
03:48:30,420 --> 03:48:31,220
Did we do it?

4311
03:48:31,440 --> 03:48:32,520
I thought Lily did.

4312
03:48:33,220 --> 03:48:33,680
Oh, okay.

4313
03:48:34,640 --> 03:48:35,440
PP mod.

4314
03:48:36,420 --> 03:48:36,780
Trap!

4315
03:48:36,900 --> 03:48:37,600
Can we track down that clip?

4316
03:48:38,480 --> 03:48:39,100
Oh, they did it.

4317
03:48:39,180 --> 03:48:39,800
They just did it.

4318
03:48:39,820 --> 03:48:40,200
It's rocked down the clip.

4319
03:48:40,500 --> 03:48:40,760
Okay.

4320
03:48:40,760 --> 03:48:41,360
They just did it.

4321
03:48:41,660 --> 03:48:42,940
I called them out and they did it.

4322
03:48:45,200 --> 03:48:45,420
Amazing.

4323
03:48:46,180 --> 03:48:46,380
Okay.

4324
03:48:46,760 --> 03:48:48,000
Well, it's not great.

4325
03:48:48,160 --> 03:48:48,500
Okay.

4326
03:48:48,820 --> 03:48:49,840
No, that's not what I wanted.

4327
03:48:50,220 --> 03:48:50,320
Fuck.

4328
03:48:50,360 --> 03:48:51,420
One of the right is dying.

4329
03:48:52,400 --> 03:48:53,560
I only caught one.

4330
03:48:54,360 --> 03:48:54,840
That's fine.

4331
03:48:54,920 --> 03:48:55,780
We just need two more.

4332
03:48:56,560 --> 03:48:57,420
We just need two more.

4333
03:48:58,220 --> 03:48:58,480
Okay.

4334
03:48:58,940 --> 03:49:01,680
I'm trying to catch this level 22 human.

4335
03:49:01,880 --> 03:49:02,660
Oh, no.

4336
03:49:02,680 --> 03:49:04,000
He did not want to be caught, I guess.

4337
03:49:05,900 --> 03:49:06,260
Okay.

4338
03:49:06,280 --> 03:49:10,420
Wait, can someone, like, clip the two humans I caught?

4339
03:49:10,720 --> 03:49:12,180
Because we have to compile all of them together.

4340
03:49:15,140 --> 03:49:15,860
Do we have a Kingpaka?

4341
03:49:16,200 --> 03:49:16,920
I don't think we did.

4342
03:49:17,100 --> 03:49:19,880
Yeah, I'm going to catch a Kingpaka while we wait, then.

4343
03:49:23,300 --> 03:49:25,500
Someone, can someone clip the two humans I caught?

4344
03:49:25,640 --> 03:49:26,560
I don't know where.

4345
03:49:27,180 --> 03:49:28,760
Oh, we guys screenshot them in the PAL box.

4346
03:49:29,200 --> 03:49:30,460
I just caught a level 22 human.

4347
03:49:30,620 --> 03:49:31,220
Can somebody clip that?

4348
03:49:31,420 --> 03:49:31,780
Nice.

4349
03:49:32,520 --> 03:49:32,900
Clip, clip, clip.

4350
03:49:34,200 --> 03:49:35,680
Where the fuck is the Kingpaka?

4351
03:49:36,480 --> 03:49:37,160
Where are you?

4352
03:49:37,840 --> 03:49:41,700
uh king kaka is near our base yeah i know i flew the wrong
way

4353
03:49:47,350 --> 03:49:49,310

4354
03:49:57,780 --> 03:50:10,520

and put stop in the incubator have you marked it i have some

4355
03:50:10,520 --> 03:50:19,520

i A huge fire egg and a huge dragon egg in there.

4356
03:50:20,200 --> 03:50:20,940
Oh, dragon!

4357
03:50:21,260 --> 03:50:21,560
Let's go!

4358
03:50:22,180 --> 03:50:24,540
And I'm pretty sure it's the fire dragon.

4359
03:50:24,900 --> 03:50:24,900
Dingus?

4360
03:50:25,280 --> 03:50:25,580
Yeah!

4361
03:50:27,160 --> 03:50:28,360
That's the best one.

4362
03:50:28,560 --> 03:50:29,720
That's literally the best pal.

4363
03:50:31,420 --> 03:50:33,460
Fucking black and red Gyarados looking.

4364
03:50:35,840 --> 03:50:37,600
Okay, there's more people over here.

4365
03:50:37,780 --> 03:50:39,640
There's more human beings over here.

4366
03:50:39,760 --> 03:50:40,660
I'm gonna try to catch a couple.

4367
03:50:42,760 --> 03:50:44,860
Come on, Van Worm, you got this!

4368
03:50:45,640 --> 03:50:46,440
Oh, shit!

4369
03:50:46,540 --> 03:50:46,700
Not the one!

4370
03:50:46,720 --> 03:50:47,220
a rush bore.

4371
03:50:48,100 --> 03:50:49,160
A random rush bore.

4372
03:50:50,120 --> 03:50:51,400
I can catch him, though.

4373
03:50:54,200 --> 03:50:57,220
Alright, we're just going to keep throwing balls at him and
see if we can catch him.

4374
03:50:58,260 --> 03:50:58,440
No!

4375
03:50:59,280 --> 03:51:00,000
Wait, is that it?

4376
03:51:00,420 --> 03:51:02,140
Yeah, let me get a... Oh, he's fucking dead.

4377
03:51:02,520 --> 03:51:03,280
Oh, no.

4378
03:51:03,480 --> 03:51:04,080
He's a corpse.

4379
03:51:04,560 --> 03:51:05,140
Can't catch him.

4380
03:51:05,260 --> 03:51:05,640
He is dead.

4381
03:51:08,340 --> 03:51:10,480
The wild pals are killing him before we can.

4382
03:51:10,900 --> 03:51:11,360
It's the human?

4383
03:51:11,400 --> 03:51:12,040
It's kind of wild.

4384
03:51:12,140 --> 03:51:15,800
Yeah, I mean, that's why you can catch the pals and the
human at the same time.

4385
03:51:20,160 --> 03:51:20,720
Yeah.

4386
03:51:21,900 --> 03:51:24,940
All right, should I come back to base or are we ready to go
to the dungeon?

4387
03:51:25,640 --> 03:51:27,640
Go back to base because Shireforce's not ready yet.

4388
03:51:28,360 --> 03:51:28,660
Ido.

4389
03:51:29,260 --> 03:51:31,380
He's doing catching stuff, right?

4390
03:51:31,720 --> 03:51:32,480
Sounds good.

4391
03:51:36,190 --> 03:51:37,790
I need more hyperspheres.

4392
03:51:40,270 --> 03:51:41,510
These are high-level mobs.

4393
03:51:41,890 --> 03:51:43,630
Tell them to stop taking their riddle in.

4394
03:51:44,370 --> 03:51:45,370
That's how you get hyperspheres.

4395
03:51:47,050 --> 03:51:47,990
Come on, Grinto.

4396
03:51:50,230 --> 03:51:52,650
Why is the boss not spawned?

4397
03:51:52,730 --> 03:51:53,590
Did someone catch this guy?

4398
03:51:53,790 --> 03:51:54,050
Which one?

4399
03:51:55,090 --> 03:51:55,530
Fangalope.

4400
03:51:55,930 --> 03:51:56,270
Fangalope?

4401
03:51:56,690 --> 03:51:56,990
I don't know.

4402
03:51:57,150 --> 03:51:57,750
Then you caught him?

4403
03:51:57,790 --> 03:51:58,410
You caught him.

4404
03:51:59,090 --> 03:51:59,410
No?

4405
03:52:00,210 --> 03:52:02,090
Yes, you said you caught a Fangalope, didn't you?

4406
03:52:04,270 --> 03:52:06,770
No, because it doesn't say on the map that I did.

4407
03:52:07,210 --> 03:52:08,610
Oh, I thought you caught him.

4408
03:52:08,790 --> 03:52:09,150
Did you sound like me?

4409
03:52:09,590 --> 03:52:10,670
Did I catch him?

4410
03:52:10,690 --> 03:52:11,450
Did someone kill him?

4411
03:52:12,230 --> 03:52:13,490
What does the Fangalope look like?

4412
03:52:13,710 --> 03:52:14,290
I don't remember.

4413
03:52:14,550 --> 03:52:15,710
It's on me on the map.

4414
03:52:16,310 --> 03:52:16,490
Oh.

4415
03:52:18,470 --> 03:52:27,010
I thought you caught the No, I've never even been over there
before Yay, I caught the Kingpaka We have a bug Nice,

4416
03:52:27,410 --> 03:52:33,210
Kingpaka, clip it Clip, clip, clip, clip Clip, clip So what
are we supposed to do?

4417
03:52:33,330 --> 03:52:35,350
Are we gonna get complimentary points for that?

4418
03:52:35,530 --> 03:52:36,890
We skip it for now?

4419
03:52:37,350 --> 03:52:38,070
Question mark?

4420
03:52:38,850 --> 03:52:42,910
Sometimes he thaw through the door floor and dies Oh,
sometimes he just dies.

4421
03:52:43,390 --> 03:52:50,770
Okay, well I better get half points for trying All right,
clip it.

4422
03:52:50,850 --> 03:52:51,950
Half points for trying.

4423
03:52:52,390 --> 03:52:53,470
That's what I'm saying.

4424
03:52:55,570 --> 03:52:55,870
Oh, no.

4425
03:52:56,070 --> 03:52:57,030
My game is broken.

4426
03:52:57,250 --> 03:52:58,150
Why is it like this?

4427
03:53:01,170 --> 03:53:01,530
Okay.

4428
03:53:02,190 --> 03:53:02,750
What the heck?

4429
03:53:05,450 --> 03:53:05,710
All right.

4430
03:53:05,790 --> 03:53:06,590
I made an egg.

4431
03:53:06,970 --> 03:53:08,290
I made an egg chest.

4432
03:53:08,470 --> 03:53:09,930
So if you have eggs, please put them in there.

4433
03:53:10,150 --> 03:53:10,370
All right.

4434
03:53:10,470 --> 03:53:11,090
Yeah, no problem.

4435
03:53:15,460 --> 03:53:18,220
Does everyone have a flying pet so we can get to that one
island?

4436
03:53:18,680 --> 03:53:18,900
Yeah.

4437
03:53:19,020 --> 03:53:20,220
Yeah, my money's dead right now.

4438
03:53:21,220 --> 03:53:23,000
Wait, why do we need to go to the island?

4439
03:53:23,300 --> 03:53:28,540
Put that motherfucking hospital because that one place that
we need to take a screenshot is an island.

4440
03:53:28,820 --> 03:53:29,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, we can.

4441
03:53:29,640 --> 03:53:32,180
Yeah, we can do it the last, like, 20 minutes or something.

4442
03:53:34,020 --> 03:53:35,660
We're almost at the last 20 minutes.

4443
03:53:35,700 --> 03:53:36,440
Oh, yeah, we're okay.

4444
03:53:36,540 --> 03:53:37,900
Yeah, that's 35 minutes.

4445
03:53:39,420 --> 03:53:40,840
Let's do the dungeon first.

4446
03:53:41,400 --> 03:53:41,680
All right.

4447
03:53:42,220 --> 03:53:43,080
I'm on my way.

4448
03:53:43,840 --> 03:53:45,160
Okay, I'll go back to the dungeon then.

4449
03:53:45,240 --> 03:53:46,740
These guys, I need to kill them.

4450
03:53:47,620 --> 03:53:50,060
Are you close to a fast travel?

4451
03:53:50,940 --> 03:53:52,020
I don't know.

4452
03:53:52,920 --> 03:53:54,560
Oh, pales are hungry.

4453
03:53:54,700 --> 03:53:55,520
I think we have no food.

4454
03:53:55,760 --> 03:53:56,340
That all's starting.

4455
03:53:56,440 --> 03:53:57,660
I'm putting food in right now.

4456
03:53:58,840 --> 03:53:59,240
Whoops.

4457
03:54:00,860 --> 03:54:04,940
Yeah, because none of them were, like, transporting anything
to the thing, so they've run out of food.

4458
03:54:06,600 --> 03:54:07,140
All right.

4459
03:54:09,380 --> 03:54:10,100
Big oof.

4460
03:54:16,620 --> 03:54:17,840
I'm heading over.

4461
03:54:18,240 --> 03:54:18,900
I'm heading over to the base.

4462
03:54:20,400 --> 03:54:21,600
Let's go get ready.

4463
03:54:22,060 --> 03:54:24,440
We just need sure if we're to find a fast travel boat so he
can get to us.

4464
03:54:26,340 --> 03:54:36,620
okay because i'm just found one i'm flying over yeah i'll
just follow pp okay um the best fast travel spot is up here

4465
03:54:36,620 --> 03:54:44,620

uh the bridge is also fine though i'm heading over to pp and

Where's the cave?

4470
03:55:01,220 --> 03:55:02,100
Head to Pee-Pee.

Okay.

We're flying over right now.

4474
03:55:09,880 --> 03:55:11,660
Oh, we killed them all.

4475
03:55:12,500 --> 03:55:13,280
Except for this one.

4476
03:55:14,580 --> 03:55:16,080
Actually, I'm going to use the wolf.

4477
03:55:16,580 --> 03:55:18,200
Actually, the wolf should be faster.

4478
03:55:20,600 --> 03:55:20,980
Nice.

4479
03:55:22,380 --> 03:55:22,960
Not nice.

4480
03:55:24,040 --> 03:55:24,660
Oh, fuck.

4482
03:55:26,180 --> 03:55:27,940
Did you guys kill the humans?

4483
03:55:28,580 --> 03:55:30,300
No, there's plenty of more with that.

4484
03:55:31,580 --> 03:55:35,060
Look, I can't say that in front of without my lawyer
present.

4485
03:55:35,540 --> 03:55:37,980
Let's not comfortable speaking on that issue.

All right.

4516
03:57:11,360 --> 03:57:12,320
She's in Brazil.

4517
03:57:12,580 --> 03:57:12,780
All right.

4518
03:57:13,080 --> 03:57:13,600
Let's go.

4519
03:57:14,860 --> 03:57:15,480
Hope I don't crash.

4520
03:57:15,600 --> 03:57:16,480
He's just fucking going.

4521
03:57:17,480 --> 03:57:18,220

4522
03:57:18,560 --> 03:57:19,000

Don't crash.

4524
03:57:20,280 --> 03:57:21,460
All right, let's go.

4525
03:57:21,640 --> 03:57:22,880
We just need one human anyway.

4526
03:57:23,560 --> 03:57:24,680
We're flying, right?

4527
03:57:27,060 --> 03:57:27,500
Okay.

4528
03:57:27,880 --> 03:57:29,520
Is one of us catching the one human?

4529
03:57:30,580 --> 03:57:33,240
I have a couple balls, but I probably have the lowest
chance.

4530
03:57:33,460 --> 03:57:37,160
Does anyone know which is the boss room for this one?

4531
03:57:37,240 --> 03:57:37,620
I don't remember.

4532
03:57:38,200 --> 03:57:39,200
Do not remember.

4533
03:57:39,360 --> 03:57:39,980
Chairford, do you remember?

4534
03:57:40,800 --> 03:57:41,220
Probably.

4535
03:57:41,860 --> 03:57:42,560
We'll wait for him.

4536
03:57:43,120 --> 03:57:45,520
What if I catch it?

4537
03:57:48,020 --> 03:57:49,800
Oh, there's bees coming from here.

4538
03:57:50,400 --> 03:57:51,380
Don't we need to catch these?

4539
03:57:51,640 --> 03:57:52,680
The bees.

4540
03:57:52,900 --> 03:57:53,680
I don't think it's the bees.

4541
03:57:53,840 --> 03:57:55,980
We need the little two cans that blow up.

4542
03:57:56,060 --> 03:57:56,700
Oh, I have two.

4543
03:57:56,780 --> 03:57:57,920
I have two for breeding.

4544
03:57:58,100 --> 03:57:58,400
For breeding.

4545
03:57:58,600 --> 03:57:58,940
We need the queen.

4546
03:57:59,160 --> 03:58:00,040
It's not the bee guards.

4547
03:58:00,260 --> 03:58:00,700
It's the queen.

4548
03:58:01,140 --> 03:58:03,120
I think they have what it takes to make unmovies.

4549
03:58:03,740 --> 03:58:03,940
Shit, shit, shit.

4550
03:58:04,180 --> 03:58:04,860
The ping!

4551
03:58:05,800 --> 03:58:06,060
It's okay.

4552
03:58:06,140 --> 03:58:06,480
I got away.

4553
03:58:06,720 --> 03:58:06,980
Okay.

4554
03:58:08,380 --> 03:58:08,760
Ow.

4555
03:58:09,220 --> 03:58:09,960
Oh, that's a human.

4556
03:58:11,340 --> 03:58:12,620
Okay, it's not to the right.

4557
03:58:13,580 --> 03:58:13,780
Okay.

4558
03:58:14,260 --> 03:58:15,080
Oh, that true hard level.

4559
03:58:15,180 --> 03:58:16,000
I cannot catch those.

4560
03:58:18,320 --> 03:58:18,720
Straight.

4561
03:58:19,780 --> 03:58:19,980

She's making me question Who?

4570

4572
03:59:02,500 --> 03:59:02,920

been doing so much farming.

4904
04:16:26,290 --> 04:16:27,110
I'm only 19.

4905
04:16:28,190 --> 04:16:31,250

Like leveling up the bases for tomorrow.

4907
04:16:34,230 --> 04:16:34,490

Shadow Legends.

4910
04:16:43,890 --> 04:16:45,610

I believe in him.

4912
04:16:47,290 --> 04:16:49,190

There's one area that spawns them that's in this lower level
area, but it's unreliable.

4942
04:18:34,370 --> 04:18:38,870
And then if you go to the desert, then you can get a lot of
them, but it's level 25, so I don't know.

4943
04:18:39,130 --> 04:18:39,930
Oh shit, yeah, I can't.

4944
04:18:39,950 --> 04:18:41,870
There is a lower level area around here though.

4945
04:18:42,210 --> 04:18:46,830
Guys, if anybody can get to me, there is a fellback.

4946
04:18:47,610 --> 04:18:49,750
I'm right out of POW balls.

4947
04:18:49,930 --> 04:18:51,730
Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

4948
04:18:52,090 --> 04:18:53,630
I will bring you... Oh, shit.

4949
04:18:53,770 --> 04:18:54,590
I can't bring you.

4950
04:18:54,790 --> 04:18:55,510
I can't bring you.

4951
04:18:55,590 --> 04:18:56,490
There's no balls here.

4952
04:18:57,830 --> 04:18:58,270
No!

4953
04:18:58,570 --> 04:19:00,070
All I have are the regular balls.

4954
04:19:00,730 --> 04:19:00,910
I'm dead!

4955
04:19:01,930 --> 04:19:02,630
It's dead?

4956
04:19:02,910 --> 04:19:03,170
No!

4957
04:19:03,170 --> 04:19:04,390
No, I died.

4958
04:19:05,090 --> 04:19:05,690
Oh, you died?

4959

Okay, that's okay.

4960
04:19:06,470 --> 04:19:07,230
If you died, that's okay.

4961
04:19:07,310 --> 04:19:08,890
We can remedy that.

4962
04:19:09,250 --> 04:19:13,010
But... I thought I had enough POW balls to do this.

4963
04:19:13,790 --> 04:19:14,230

04:20:47,810 --> 04:20:48,850
I don't know what to tell you, man.

4995
04:20:51,810 --> 04:20:53,430

5017
04:21:46,470 --> 04:21:50,630
clipped and match it to anything that we've done, that'd be
great.

Isn't that a global event?

5163
04:30:44,250 --> 04:30:45,650
Or is that per day?

5164
04:30:45,950 --> 04:30:46,890
Well, it's global.

5165
04:30:47,190 --> 04:30:48,250
But doesn't that add it up?

5166
04:30:48,450 --> 04:30:49,590
Doesn't it add up to us?

5167
04:30:51,350 --> 04:30:59,010
the very end of the event because all you do is look at your
pal deck and see registered i have um i have 41 i have 39

04:32:07,620 --> 04:32:08,270

Well, I had a screenshot of Gumas.

5211
04:33:46,370 --> 04:33:48,250
If you have a screenshot, that should be enough.

5212
04:33:48,250 --> 04:33:49,410
Someone has the Gumas clip.

5213
04:33:49,730 --> 04:33:50,070
There you go.

5214
04:33:50,850 --> 04:33:51,450

04:33:54,670 --> 04:33:54,950
Nice.

5218
04:33:55,190 --> 04:33:55,550
Yeah.

5219
04:33:56,330 --> 04:33:57,990
Alright, that should be everything, right?

5220
04:33:58,910 --> 04:33:59,130
Okay.

5221
04:34:02,470 --> 04:34:03,070
We...

5222
04:34:03,690 --> 04:34:04,750
Now we die.

5223
04:34:05,110 --> 04:34:05,450
Now we...

5224
04:34:05,450 --> 04:34:07,130
Okay, now we're done.

5225
04:34:10,490 --> 04:34:12,050
That's all five minutes.

5226
04:34:12,270 --> 04:34:12,750
That's it.

5227
04:34:12,950 --> 04:34:14,250
I just saw my mod DM.

5228
04:34:14,430 --> 04:34:15,730
It's got like 200 messages.

5229
04:34:16,850 --> 04:34:19,550
Mod, how could you not get the Goombas clip?

5230
04:34:20,870 --> 04:34:24,210
I worked so hard on getting that Goombas.

5231
04:34:25,770 --> 04:34:27,530
We got all the fun achievements.

5232
04:34:28,270 --> 04:34:28,670
Yeah.

5233
04:34:28,870 --> 04:34:29,210
Yeah.

5234
04:34:29,670 --> 04:34:30,110
We did.

5235
04:34:30,870 --> 04:34:31,490
We're having fun.

5236
04:34:31,510 --> 04:34:32,390
Except for the Tokos.

5237
04:34:32,630 --> 04:34:33,910
But that was on mute.

5238
04:34:35,770 --> 04:34:36,070
Eh.

5239
04:34:36,350 --> 04:34:37,450
They never enough balls.

5240
04:34:37,470 --> 04:34:39,050
What placement did we get in the end?

5241
04:34:39,750 --> 04:34:40,150
Guys.

5242
04:34:40,590 --> 04:34:41,490
Are they still calculating?

5243
04:34:41,810 --> 04:34:42,470
I think they're still calculating.

5244
04:34:43,130 --> 04:34:44,690
We sent stuff for so long.

5245
04:34:44,790 --> 04:34:45,510
I'm pretty still calculating.

5246
04:34:46,130 --> 04:34:46,490
Yeah.

5247
04:34:46,750 --> 04:34:47,070
Yeah.

5248
04:34:47,290 --> 04:34:50,350
Well, at least now, though, now we know what the
achievements are.

5249
04:34:50,430 --> 04:34:52,610
So we can strategize for how we want to start day two.

5250
04:34:53,670 --> 04:34:55,170
And like, what the plan is.

5251
04:34:55,190 --> 04:34:57,490
We're on 10th place right now.

5252
04:34:57,690 --> 04:34:57,790
All right.

5253
04:34:57,910 --> 04:35:01,550
That's how much money that's not bad I don't I don't know if
they're like finished calculating though.

5254
04:35:01,710 --> 04:35:05,030
That's a thing I don't know they finished calculating.

5255
04:35:06,010 --> 04:35:09,850
All right, that is Hey, that's a hundred eighty seven
dollars.

5256
04:35:10,150 --> 04:35:10,870
Let's go

5257
04:35:16,130 --> 04:35:21,230
The ranking also includes global points not last let's
fucking go.

5258
04:35:21,510 --> 04:35:31,250
We broke top ten Let's go top ten we still have time we
still have time well how are we gonna do tomorrow um i can

5259
04:35:31,250 --> 04:35:42,210
finish the day one i'll i can finish like all the day one
easies okay um uh and then short for can work on the other

5260
04:35:42,210 --> 04:35:51,010
day ones that we missed let's see all right day two cook a
mozzarella cheeseburger i think we already have any of our

5261
04:35:51,010 --> 04:36:00,830
registered pals in yet so that's not in the scoring either
yeah I think looking at how many points we get for tomorrow

5262
04:36:00,830 --> 04:36:08,410
we should probably do the leftover only if we have nothing
better to do because we only get half points for the day one

5263
04:36:08,410 --> 04:36:17,830
and day two gives like already five times more baseline for
similar difficulty for some it seems kind of like what we

5264
04:36:17,830 --> 04:36:25,230
might want to do is we might want to just do whatever we can
to power level sure to level 50 so we can get a towel up to

5265
04:36:25,230 --> 04:36:33,450
level 50 and then we can take on just pat catching towels
yeah yeah just making balls um i think i'll just make a ton

5266
04:36:33,450 --> 04:36:39,750
of balls because like we've been struggling all day yeah
yeah we need more yeah okay yeah i think i'll just stick

5267
04:36:39,750 --> 04:36:48,370
around in base make sure they actually work and make let me
let me check on all of the i'll like make a list after this

5268
04:36:48,370 --> 04:36:56,810
of all the materials that we need to get to base level 20
yeah like just in total um because we're gonna have to have

5269
04:36:56,810 --> 04:37:04,370
uh probably sure make all of the items because they're gonna
start into the high level stuff but i will check and see

5270
04:37:04,370 --> 04:37:12,690
what we need i'm sure we're gonna start needing things like
like coal and stuff so all right yeah so okay legendary pal

5271
04:37:12,690 --> 04:37:19,570
how take a photo with a lift monk energy inside the volcano

04:37:26,490 --> 04:37:32,850
just have one person build bases and stuff yeah yeah so the
strat worked well because then one can just stay back and

5274
04:37:32,850 --> 04:37:39,650
make balls and they have like no waypoints but it doesn't
matter because we need to rush our hot dog a rush or hot dog

5275
04:37:39,650 --> 04:37:45,210
so we need to kill one of those and then a mozzarella
cheeseburger i think i'm gonna see what's in the moderna

5276
04:37:45,210 --> 04:37:50,510
cheeseburger because we already have a whole bunch of milk
so i think we already have tons of milk i think oh that's

5277
04:37:50,510 --> 04:37:54,670
right my z key doesn't work anymore sureforn you need to get
to level 50.

5278
04:37:55,950 --> 04:38:02,070
that should be fine on the multiplier as long as balls yeah
you need level 50 and because you need to get paled at level

5279
04:38:02,070 --> 04:38:11,710
50 or you can just get hard on the balls and the level of
cheeseburger yeah requires oh we need an electric kitchen

5280
04:38:11,710 --> 04:38:20,770
that's the problem we have all this stuff for it but we need
to be level 41 sure freaking like power level fast uh and I

5281
04:38:20,770 --> 04:38:26,810
guess like I can I'll start power leveling as well so I can
help out with catching the stronger powers like the Verdash,

5282
04:38:27,650 --> 04:38:31,010
Memorus and the Violet, and then Chifor can work on the hard
ones.

5283
04:38:32,910 --> 04:38:40,550
Yeah, I'll probably keep management of inventory, and then
once the base is at level 20, I'll just go back.

5284
04:38:40,790 --> 04:38:42,670
We need to work on the breeding stuff as well.

5285
04:38:43,650 --> 04:38:44,010
Yep.

5286
04:38:44,010 --> 04:38:44,370
Okay.

5287
04:38:45,490 --> 04:38:49,730
I think you just do a base management, I'll just craft
bolts.

5288
04:38:50,110 --> 04:38:54,350
The base management, a lot of it is going to be just making
sure we have enough stuff, and then once we do, being like,

5289
04:38:54,470 --> 04:39:03,750
okay, come back sure so all right uh come back craft then
yeah come back please make this thank you all right um yeah

5290
04:39:03,750 --> 04:39:16,650
breeding okay figure that out okay i'll take breeding and
base management for tomorrow good and the balls and and the

5291
04:39:16,650 --> 04:39:23,570
materials be spam capturing so i guess i guess cooking too
because cooking is also just really yeah yeah apparently we

5292
04:39:23,570 --> 04:39:33,370
can get 700 points for petting huh we need 700 points if we
fight but we need to catch every type though oh there's so

5293
04:39:33,370 --> 04:39:42,390
many we probably already do have every type though we need
water grass dark ice earth fire electric dragon the hardest

5294
04:39:42,390 --> 04:39:51,090
one is dragon and we have dragon yeah oh okay so we're good
we're good already let's see i'm just checking They haven't

5295
04:39:51,090 --> 04:39:52,010
they didn't count our chicken.

5296
04:39:52,510 --> 04:39:53,970
We worked so hard on the chicken.

5297
04:39:54,270 --> 04:39:54,830
What do you mean?

5298
04:39:55,670 --> 04:39:56,630
They didn't count our chicken.

5299
04:39:56,990 --> 04:39:57,290
Why not?

5300
04:39:57,330 --> 04:39:58,830
Tell me about my fangalope being bugged.

5301
04:39:59,010 --> 04:40:01,110
I can't believe it.

5302
04:40:01,270 --> 04:40:02,650
Wait, why didn't the chicken count?

5303
04:40:02,770 --> 04:40:03,170
What the heck?

5304
04:40:03,950 --> 04:40:08,470
When it says padding different pals of the same element,
does that mean that we need to have four of the same element

5305
04:40:08,470 --> 04:40:09,750
pal in the same screenshot?

5306
04:40:10,290 --> 04:40:10,670
Maybe.

5307
04:40:11,310 --> 04:40:12,790
Because that's what it looks like in the photo.

5308
04:40:13,230 --> 04:40:14,690
I guess all four of us.

5309
04:40:14,690 --> 04:40:16,790
Yeah, all four of us pet like different ones.

5310
04:40:16,810 --> 04:40:18,150
Okay, so we need four dragons.

5311
04:40:18,550 --> 04:40:18,870

04:41:30,350 --> 04:41:32,390
No, let me check Wait, am I allowed to log back in?

5347
04:41:32,630 --> 04:41:33,290

No, we have to you can.

5349
04:41:34,470 --> 04:41:38,070

04:41:38,230 --> 04:41:39,710
Do you guys have a clip?

5351
04:41:41,190 --> 04:41:42,210
Because you're asking us for it.

5352
04:41:42,210 --> 04:41:45,730
I said it out loud, but I there's no rewind on Twitch.

5353
04:41:45,910 --> 04:41:47,790
I mean, I could easily be like I have

5354
04:41:51,050 --> 04:41:56,770
like it's global so it doesn't matter right we can't get it
tomorrow it's just a it's a global yeah it's a global yeah

5355
04:41:56,770 --> 04:42:02,690
but if it means we get like not i guess okay we're not gonna
get like seven place never mind i'm gonna say what happens

5356
04:42:02,690 --> 04:42:10,390
if you're in the top whatever top what what do you mean does
it matter right now i mean it means it doesn't matter if

5357
04:42:10,390 --> 04:42:16,510
we're seventh place or whatever if we get to seven place
we're tenth place currently so like if we get to seven place

5358
04:42:16,510 --> 04:42:17,350
we just get more money.

5359
04:42:18,650 --> 04:42:19,330
On day one?

5360
04:42:19,710 --> 04:42:20,430

I mean, take the wallet if you can see the register
palettes.

5364
04:42:28,610 --> 04:42:29,750
But I'm pretty sure I'm covering.

5365
04:42:29,990 --> 04:42:32,510
I think it's like in the bottom left corner, isn't it?

5366
04:42:32,610 --> 04:42:35,030
When you open the paldex, I think I'm covering it.

5367
04:42:35,030 --> 04:42:35,970
I have no idea.

5368
04:42:36,270 --> 04:42:38,470
If we're allowed to log in real quick, I can check.

5369
04:42:40,830 --> 04:42:42,810
When we're opening the fucking paldex.

5370
04:42:43,610 --> 04:42:45,430
Yeah, I wish I could just open it.

5371
04:42:45,870 --> 04:42:46,250
Yeah.

5372
04:42:47,210 --> 04:42:54,110
oh my god can we ping a mod and just ask them if we can open
it yeah you can all right i'm just gonna ping a mod because

5373
04:42:54,110 --> 04:43:08,020

What do you mean, V2?

5380
04:43:30,240 --> 04:43:32,800
If I was a face cam streamer, I would cover it too.

5381
04:43:32,900 --> 04:43:33,700
It's the same position!

5382
04:43:35,260 --> 04:43:36,160
What do you mean?

5383
04:43:36,420 --> 04:43:38,520
I mean, you could have put it on the other side.

5384
04:43:39,480 --> 04:43:40,100
I guess.

5385
04:43:40,340 --> 04:43:41,000
I guess so.

5386
04:43:41,040 --> 04:43:41,520
That's true.

5387
04:43:42,040 --> 04:43:42,360
Yeah.

5388
04:43:42,580 --> 04:43:43,180

It's mine.

5394
04:43:54,200 --> 04:43:54,280
Yeah.

5395
04:43:55,620 --> 04:43:58,600

5537
04:50:19,120 --> 04:50:20,540

5541
04:50:26,740 --> 04:50:27,620

5542
04:50:27,620 --> 04:50:28,300

We did.

5545
04:50:32,620 --> 04:50:38,680
I think like the last 30 minutes we should like drop pals to
each other so we can like make sure we all have registered

5546
04:50:38,680 --> 04:50:39,140
pals.

5547
04:50:39,640 --> 04:50:40,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5548
04:50:40,620 --> 04:50:41,440
Well, wait a minute.

5549
04:50:41,480 --> 04:50:43,360
I have a question though and maybe chat can answer this.

5550
04:50:43,500 --> 04:50:47,540
I'm pretty sure if you drop pals, does it register or does
it like not register?

5551
04:50:47,660 --> 04:50:49,060
Like do you actually have to catch it?

5552
04:50:49,140 --> 04:50:49,560
No, no.

5553
04:50:49,560 --> 04:50:56,820
It's just you just get bonus for catching you just have to
you just have to drop pals and then Uh, wait, you can't

5554
04:50:56,820 --> 04:50:57,880
register from dropping pals.

5555
04:50:58,280 --> 04:50:58,280
Really?

5556
04:50:59,300 --> 04:51:00,160

5605
04:53:34,000 --> 04:53:34,520
Thanks for...

5606
04:53:34,520 --> 04:53:37,240
I had a great time for day one.

5607
04:53:37,880 --> 04:53:38,700
GGs, thanks.

5608
04:53:38,820 --> 04:53:39,660

5609
04:53:39,920 --> 04:53:40,960
GGs, see you guys tomorrow.

5610
04:53:41,340 --> 04:53:43,280
Those four hours pass by so fast.

5611
04:53:43,960 --> 04:53:44,600
Yeah, so fast.

5612
04:53:44,760 --> 04:53:45,380
It's so much fun.

5613
04:53:45,620 --> 04:53:46,340
Yeah, all right.

5614
04:53:46,420 --> 04:53:47,040
See ya.

5615
04:53:47,600 --> 04:53:48,000

5616
04:53:48,060 --> 04:53:48,500
Bye.

5617
04:53:48,720 --> 04:53:49,120
Bye.

5618
04:53:51,360 --> 04:53:51,780
Alright.

5619
04:53:52,680 --> 04:53:52,940
Wow.

5620
04:53:53,100 --> 04:53:54,260
That was really fun.

5621
04:53:54,700 --> 04:53:56,380
I hope you guys had a great time.

5622
04:53:57,000 --> 04:54:01,160
I hope you guys had a great time with Shy Lily, Pee-Pee, and
Sure4.

5623
04:54:03,620 --> 04:54:04,040
Yeah.

5624
04:54:04,380 --> 04:54:05,340
Holy shit.

5625
04:54:05,480 --> 04:54:06,980
We were fucking gaming.

5626
04:54:07,700 --> 04:54:08,880
To be fair, we were a bit scum.

5627
04:54:08,880 --> 04:54:09,600
We had no plan.

5628
04:54:09,700 --> 04:54:10,020
Okay.

5629
04:54:10,200 --> 04:54:13,040
We had zero plan and we got top 10.

5630
04:54:13,380 --> 04:54:14,640
That's all that matters.

5631
04:54:19,200 --> 04:54:20,940
No plan, top 10.

5632
04:54:21,160 --> 04:54:22,340
Let's let it go.

5633
04:54:24,380 --> 04:54:26,220
But it's thank you all for the subs.

5634
04:54:26,640 --> 04:54:34,240
Thank you all for the subs, the gifted subs, for following
and all of that on Twitch.

5635
04:54:34,460 --> 04:54:35,300
Thank you guys so much.

5636
04:54:35,380 --> 04:54:36,020
And the bitties.

5637
04:54:36,560 --> 04:54:37,480
Thank you guys.

5638
04:54:37,980 --> 04:54:40,180
I had a great time with all of you.

5639
04:54:40,260 --> 04:54:41,720
I mean, we streamed for four hours.

5640
04:54:41,940 --> 04:54:42,480
Holy fuck.

5641
04:54:42,940 --> 04:54:44,720
Those four hours were intense.

5642
04:54:48,720 --> 04:54:54,400
I'm going to call it here because I want to make sure I have
enough energy for tomorrow because it's going to be another

5643
04:54:54,400 --> 04:54:55,400
four-hour day.

5644
04:54:55,800 --> 04:54:56,840
But thank you, everybody.

5645
04:54:57,460 --> 04:54:59,320
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

5646
04:54:59,640 --> 04:55:04,720
For those who are new here, I usually stream on the
YouTubes, so please check me out on YouTube.

5647
04:55:06,520 --> 04:55:09,660
I think, like, exclamation point YouTube, you can subscribe
to me there.

5648
04:55:10,140 --> 04:55:12,660
Sometimes I stream Twitch stuff like today because it was
Twitch Rivals.

5649
04:55:13,220 --> 04:55:19,720
And if you want to get more updates on when I stream on
Twitch, please check me out on Twitter.

5650
04:55:20,300 --> 04:55:22,060
I don't know if exclamation point Twitter works.

5651
04:55:22,520 --> 04:55:22,800
And merch!

5652
04:55:22,980 --> 04:55:23,180
Merch!

5653
04:55:23,280 --> 04:55:24,600
You're going to support me via other ways!

5654
04:55:24,840 --> 04:55:26,000
There is merch!

5655
04:55:26,400 --> 04:55:27,680
Exclamation point merch.

5656
04:55:28,020 --> 04:55:30,540
I will be putting up Lunar New Year merch.

5657
04:55:31,100 --> 04:55:35,920
I think like I'll have an announcement later on like
Saturday or like Monday or Sunday.

5658
04:55:36,080 --> 04:55:38,820
I think like Lunar New Year merch is going to come up on
Saturday or Sunday.

5659
04:55:39,200 --> 04:55:45,280
Anyway, I had an amazing time with all of you guys and I
hope you guys had an amazing time with my team and

5660
04:55:45,280 --> 04:55:45,740
everything.

5661
04:55:45,920 --> 04:55:52,060
Thank you all stay hydrated, pause your chair, get up and
move around to get that blood flowing.

5662
04:55:52,220 --> 04:55:55,120
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve
it.

5663
04:55:55,280 --> 04:55:56,320
I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

5664
04:55:56,620 --> 04:55:57,260
Bye, guys.

5665
04:55:57,780 --> 04:55:58,080
Bye.
