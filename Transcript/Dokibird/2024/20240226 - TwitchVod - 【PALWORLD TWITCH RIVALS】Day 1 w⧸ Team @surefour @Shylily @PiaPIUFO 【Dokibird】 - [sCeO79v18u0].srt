1
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,100
Unmute!

2
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,740
Yippee!

3
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,720
Yay!

4
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,980
Hey guys!

5
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,240
We're all unmuted now!

6
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,520
I've been silenced.

7
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,440
Silenced.

8
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,080
We're all unmuted now.

9
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,320
Okay, we were actually discussing strats because we finally got the achievements and everything.

10
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,980
But I guess like...

11
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,080
So I guess like a small introduction of all of us so people would know who we are.

12
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,540
Because we have someone that's not a VTuber here in our ranks.

13
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,600
Like our little imposter right here.

14
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,860
Oh, that's that smell.

15
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,340
Who I also forced to make the server.

16
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,360
Beautiful.

17
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,280
Sherfer, why don't you introduce yourself, Sherfer?

18
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,640
I go last because I'm the special one.

19
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,260
You're the special one.

20
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:47,700
Okay.

21
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,780
Okay.

22
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,500
Alright, so hello guys.

23
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm Doki aka DokiBird.

24
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,920
I am the captain but I made Sherfer make the server as the captain.

25
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,260
That's me.

26
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,540
That's just pink strats.

27
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,700
That's just pink strats.

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,880
Yeah, I'm just like outsourcing.

29
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,120
Alright, who's next?

30
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,860
How's it outsourcing when I'm part of the team?

31
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,220
And then I invited you to the team.

32
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,680
Who's next?

33
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,020
Well, you're the captain.

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,420
Okay, I'm the captain.

35
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,140
But I said I'm last.

36
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,620
Okay, Shy Lily.

37
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,880
Don't talk back to the captain.

38
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,440
Yeah.

39
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,600
How dare you.

40
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,020
How dare you.

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,280
It's three against one.

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,100
I know, right?

43
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,200
I got hands.

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,300
What?

45
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,660
You said three versus one.

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
I got hands.

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,900
Shy Lily has hands.

48
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,540
She has 3D.

49
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
I got loads of hands.

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,240
None of you are freaking real.

51
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,140
How do you know if you're real?

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,920
None of you are real.

53
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,680
You can't hurt me.

54
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,860
How do you know if you're real?

55
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,820
Yeah.

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
Because I can turn on my webcam.

57
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,960
Whoa.

58
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,480
AI.

59
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,020
My immersion.

60
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,520
Oh, yeah.

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,920
Nice immersion break saying you have a webcam.

62
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,660
Maybe I just put it on my feet, man.

63
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,400
Oh, that's...

64
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,060
That's some cryo stuff right there.

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,440
Whoa.

66
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,560
For free?

67
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,560
For free?

68
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,200
For free.

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,180
What the heck?

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,200
Alright, alright.

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,580
Shy Lily.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,300
Your turn.

73
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,020
Introduce yourself.

74
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,020
Oh.

75
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,620
Hi.

76
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,380
I'm Lily.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,140
Hey.

78
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,320
Hi, Lily.

79
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,700
What is this?

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,100
AA?

81
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,240
This is some AA shit.

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,100
Hi.

83
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,520
I'm Lily.

84
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,800
I'm addicted to Pal World.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,280
Hello, Lily.

86
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,060
Understandable.

87
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,620
Have a nice day.

88
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,680
My condolences.

89
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,640
Do your parents know?

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,560
Oh, the f...

91
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,280
Then what this own me?

92
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,740
What the heck?

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,600
No, of course not.

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,400
Shh.

95
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,340
Don't tell them.

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,620
Don't tell them.

97
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,160
Alright, who's next?

98
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,640
Guys, don't be shy.

99
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,220
I'm last, though.

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,780
We still have to talk about our achievement stuff later.

101
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,620
We can't spend ten minutes on this.

102
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,180
Oh, shit.

103
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,180
Alright.

104
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,200
I'll go.

105
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,700
I'll go.

106
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,620
Uh...

107
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,520
My name's PP UFO, slime alien, VTuber in a human suit except for all the times when I'm not in a human suit.

108
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,540
I'm a gremlin with a heart of gold.

109
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,200
Just don't ask me where I got the heart or the gold.

110
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,060
Nice to meet ya.

111
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,700
PP.

112
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,700
PP.

113
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, I got that small PP energy, though, because I'm like 153 centimeters tall.

114
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,260
Well, not very tall.

115
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,180
I have decided that this is your nickname.

116
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,300
I'm sorry, but you are PP now.

117
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,480
No, it's acceptable.

118
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,480
Understandable.

119
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,080
Have a nice day.

120
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,380
Just how it works.

121
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,500
I don't know, man.

122
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,280
You've now been dubbed PP to the rest of the world.

123
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,860
Hi, I'm PP.

124
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,800
Nice to meet you.

125
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Alright, last but not least, the flesh tuber.

126
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,860
Okay, I have a name, you know.

127
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
Yeah, but you haven't introduced us, so how would we know?

128
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
Yeah, picked by your parents.

129
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,220
I'm just the flesh tuber.

130
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,220
Hi, I'm Surefour.

131
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,800
I used to be in Overwatch League Pro.

132
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,680
Now I just stream.

133
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,220
Also known as the RP guy, the BattleBit guy.

134
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,060
League of Legends guy.

135
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,780
Congratulations.

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,280
Now the Power World guy.

137
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,780
Do your parents have a name?

138
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
My legacy, the gritty guy.

139
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,380
Oh yeah, the gritty guy!

140
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,080
Oh!

141
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,780
Yeah, he can do a mad gritty.

142
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,000
Anyway, so while we were muted, we were discussing about the achievements.

143
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,540
We were discussing things before then.

144
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,220
Yeah.

145
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,000
Which was very relevant to our stream, right?

146
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,640
Guys?

147
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,600
Relevant to mine.

148
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,360
I like the achievement.

149
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,620
I don't know if my mods...

150
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,460
made a command for it.

151
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,560
But basically, Surefour is going to be our power leveler.

152
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,160
And then that's our strat, basically.

153
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,820
That's all we decided.

154
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,400
Wow.

155
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,980
That's the strat.

156
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,000
That was sick.

157
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,940
So we have a power leveler.

158
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,840
Yeah.

159
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,340
We got this far.

160
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,580
We got this far.

161
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,620
Anyway, so are we doing...

162
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,820
Were we doing the global achievements for day 2?

163
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,220
For the extra multiplier?

164
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,220
I think we just do whatever we can do.

165
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,040
Yeah, pretty much just do whatever you can do.

166
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,680
I think like...

167
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,780
keeping track of who's caught what is going to waste time.

168
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,200
So I guess just kind of...

169
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,120
Just do whatever and we'll kind of collect whatever we've done at the end.

170
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,740
The only time we need to do stuff together is for the group achievements.

171
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,080
Yeah.

172
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,260
We'll be there for that.

173
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,640
The group one was like take a team photo in the wildlife sanctuary.

174
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,580
And then with the reincarnated guy.

175
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,160
And then...

176
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,200
We had to compete in the ravine grotto dungeon.

177
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,820
As well as the mountain stream grotto dungeon.

178
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,200
Where the fuck is that?

179
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,100
I don't know where the fuck those are.

180
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,060
Yeah, I was going to say where the fuck are these places?

181
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,640
I have no idea.

182
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,840
You're the one that linked the interactive map.

183
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,500
I'm thinking about putting her...

184
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,640
The what interactive map?

185
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,340
Oh wait, I mean the...

186
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,840
The what map?

187
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

188
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,280
I'm just like we already have a hype train.

189
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,760
Here's my contribution.

190
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,640
The what map?

191
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,660
If there was a map though, you should probably hide all the things.

192
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,200
And then...

193
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,440
And then just pick and choose what you'd want to show up on.

194
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,460
Sorry, I mean the...

195
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,920
The pal world map.

196
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,920
Sorry.

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,020
The official in-game pal world map.

198
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,420
The official in-game map.

199
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,480
Sorry guys.

200
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,980
How can you use that when it's hidden until you've explored it?

201
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,200
What?

202
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,280
Woah!

203
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Explore everything.

204
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,840
Yeah, as long as we explore everything, it'll be fine.

205
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,420
Right?

206
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,480
Yeah.

207
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,820
It'll be okay.

208
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,360
It'll be okay.

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,700
We can figure this out.

210
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,860
Right.

211
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,700
We're not exploiting anything.

212
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,320
We barely know how to play this game, let alone exploit it.

213
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,220
Like...

214
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:02,600
So I think how it's going to work with the base is that if I'm gonna have you doing power leveling, that I'm probably just gonna work on resource management, and just checking in on where stuff is.

215
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,340
And in the meantime just trying to level myself.

216
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,760
Okay, and then Lily and I, we're just gonna exist.

217
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,840
We are just next to the island.

218
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,780
I'll do the level up the chicky P to level 30.

219
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,640
I'll work on that.

220
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,440
I'll only use a chicky P to fight.

221
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,160
Good freaking job.

222
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,760
I'm gonna put our face by the desolate church where they've got the ingot like vein.

223
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,040
Wait, who wants to catch five humans?

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,680
Who wants to do that?

225
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,340
No, you're in base duty.

226
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,840
You're the only one that knows what to do.

227
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,760
Raiders show up.

228
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,900
That's where all the buff men show up.

229
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,280
That's true.

230
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,360
You can cook the meat too because that's the base thing too.

231
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,260
How many steaks do I have to cook?

232
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,700
Just one?

233
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,560
Yeah, the mammoth steak.

234
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,500
Oh, mammoth steak.

235
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I think surefour is the one that needs to fucking kill a mammoth.

236
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,060
You're the power level.

237
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,260
You're gonna be the closest to catching one.

238
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:07,900
It's true.

239
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,520
I'm being forced to do so many things.

240
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,200
What do you mean?

241
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,480
Power levelers!

242
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:20,520
When they say level up a chickpea to level 30, do they mean from one or do they just mean like have a chickpea and it be level 30?

243
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,520
No, it says level up a chickpea to level 30.

244
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,880
I mean, you can probably catch like a level 29 chickpea level up once.

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,220
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

246
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,900
But I feel like by the time we find a level 29, I think we can just level it up by that time.

247
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,600
Fair enough.

248
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,140
I think.

249
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:35,740
I think.

250
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,660
I think.

251
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,820
There's like global one was like make a clip where all teammates are petting different pals of the same element.

252
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Does that mean like all of us petting like water type or like one of us petting water type?

253
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,360
I didn't even fucking pay attention to the global ones.

254
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh shit.

255
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
There's like breeding as well.

256
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
The Anubis and the...

257
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,340
Yeah.

258
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,700
Oh, Diremope with three.

259
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,380
I don't know how the breeding things work.

260
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,300
I didn't really get into breeding.

261
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,220
Oh, hey, if you...

262
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,700
Each person like the amount of pals we catch is points per person too.

263
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,980
Oh, okay.

264
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,940
Yeah.

265
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,460
Oh my God.

266
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,340
One of them is the Direwolf with three move speed passives.

267
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,960
I had that.

268
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,060
That's just fast as fuck.

269
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,200
So I guess for the first hour, I guess all we should really do is like catch, catch, catch.

270
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,780
Yeah.

271
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,380
And like try to move towards where the base is going to be, which is like...

272
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:29,560
Yeah.

273
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,920
If you have a mental map...

274
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,020
Yeah.

275
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,900
It's going to be like in the red.

276
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah.

277
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,620
Red area.

278
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,680
All right.

279
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,420
I don't know where...

280
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,220
The red area towards the tip of one of those arrows.

281
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,060
I'm pretty sure it's like towards the south end of the red and yellow area.

282
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,960
All right.

283
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,880
So basically, I don't know where the fuck that is.

284
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,120
So I'm just going to...

285
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,820
I'm not mentally...

286
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,140
So mentally...

287
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,480
It's by the Desolate Church.

288
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,340
It's too bad they don't have a search function on the map.

289
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,560
Yeah.

290
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,520
It's too bad.

291
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,360
We're going to just explore that together until we find it.

292
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,620
Right?

293
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,160
Yeah.

294
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,400
Yeah.

295
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,920
For sure.

296
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,220
For sure.

297
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,600
Also to my chat, is everybody sounding okay or is anybody too quiet?

298
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,060
My sound guy is AFK.

299
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,780
I have no idea.

300
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,720
We're all okay.

301
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,060
All right.

302
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,400
Anyway.

303
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,120
So we got our plan, right?

304
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,620
We are...

305
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,260
Oh, fucking hell.

306
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,800
All right.

307
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,020
Hour one, just catch.

308
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,800
Just pump through.

309
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,360
Catch.

310
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:33,680
Yeah.

311
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:33,900
All right.

312
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,280
Nice.

313
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,060
As long as our goal...

314
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,160
Go.

315
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,700
...is not last.

316
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,080
Even if we're last place, we get $500.

317
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,820
So that doesn't really matter in the end.

318
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,400
Let's go.

319
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,320
Yippee.

320
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,140
In the end, even if we're last, $500.

321
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,340
Sheesh.

322
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,100
All right.

323
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,860
I boosted up Lily's volume just in case.

324
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,020
Oh, yeah.

325
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,600
I should boost...

326
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:57,820
Yeah.

327
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,560
It sounds great here, but I'm looking at the little thing on OBS and it doesn't look great.

328
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,980
Man, I'm trying.

329
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,260
Okay.

330
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,700
I'm trying.

331
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:05,920
Okay.

332
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,140
I'm trying.

333
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,800
Push it up.

334
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:06,940
Every single sub is coming right to me and it's being unbelievable.

335
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:06,960
All right.

336
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,540
I look decent.

337
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,440
Put up the gain.

338
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,360
Just put around 200% on Discord.

339
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:11,880
200%.

340
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,080
Yeah, I did.

341
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,880
That's what I did.

342
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,720
Yeah.

343
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,180
I wish I could turn up my shit more, but I have so much background noise if I do.

344
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,560
Like, I have no...

345
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,700
My set-up is super scuffed, and like, my set-up is super like beginner streamer.

346
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,060
Yeah.

347
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,540
How long are you been streaming?

348
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,420
A couple of years.

349
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,100
Wait.

350
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,860
What is your graphics card?

351
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,920
It's...

352
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,160
It's in there.

353
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,800
It's a graphics card.

354
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,500
All screamers are lazy.

355
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,380
Screamers only do things when they have to.

356
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,460
That's true.

357
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,900
The moment when her PC dies when she upgrades.

358
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,480
I wouldn't be surprised.

359
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,420
She's still using a 60Hz monitor.

360
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,200
Are you using a 60Hz monitor, Huli?

361
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
No, no, it's...

362
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,480
60Hz monitor, mouse acceleration on, what's a DPI?

363
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,680
It's surely more than that.

364
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,520
It's surely... when was the last time you bought a monitor upgrade?

365
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,240
It's been a couple years.

366
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,800
Have you ever... actively gone to your monitor settings and then changed your refresh rates yourself?

367
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,020
You're so bright, Nivs!

368
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,760
Okay, so you're on 60Hz.

369
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,660
She's on 60Hz.

370
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,060
I'm not bad at any FPS games, I just have a 60Hz monitor.

371
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
It's not my fault.

372
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,660
Oh, I'm actually... yeah, it's not my fault.

373
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,760
Well, so the thing with 60Hz is you're living in blissful ignorance until you realize...

374
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, that is so true.

375
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,500
Until you realize...

376
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,880
Once you see the light, then you can never go back.

377
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,420
Once you see the light, you get blinded by God and you can't go back.

378
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm not sure if I want God to flash me, to be honest.

379
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,020
Well, it's like a really good flash.

380
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,920
Yeah, it's like a flash that's in your memory forever and you can never...

381
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,980
Just one time and then you're gone forever.

382
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,760
Yeah, and then you can never go back.

383
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,880
You're like, if anybody else flashes me, it won't be the same.

384
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,220
It's true though, my friend is like a pro Valorant player and they came over to my house when they were visiting and they wanted to use my computer.

385
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,440
And I was like, what?

386
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,900
No, no, they turned on... they were like desperate.

387
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,520
Your friend is God?

388
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,280
No, they turned on my stupid monitor and they were like, wait, is this 60Hz?

389
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,920
And I was like, yeah.

390
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,220
And they had gone like two weeks without and they were like, what's another two weeks?

391
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,360
And then they just walked away.

392
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,460
I was like, are you kidding me?

393
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,120
Are you fucking kidding me?

394
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,500
Damn.

395
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:26,780
Well...

396
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,100
It's that bad, huh?

397
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,320
Check your Hertz right now.

398
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,540
I know.

399
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,140
Check your Hertz right now.

400
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,320
How do I do that?

401
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,580
Go to your monitor... go to your monitor desktop.

402
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
Do display settings.

403
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,200
Okay.

404
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,560
Wait, wait, wait.

405
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:36,880
Desktop?

406
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,120
Right click on your desktop.

407
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,420
Yeah.

408
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,820
Right click and then do display settings.

409
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,880
Yeah.

410
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,460
And then... and then I forgot what to do next.

411
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:45,820
Okay.

412
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,300
Oh my God.

413
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,040
And then scroll down until you see advanced display settings.

414
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,260
Advanced display.

415
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,600
Yeah.

416
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,840
And then go to your monitor.

417
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,240
What is the refresh rate?

418
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,040
It says 60Hz.

419
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,660
Called it.

420
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,380
Called it.

421
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,080
Now go to your refresh rate.

422
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,260
And see if you can change it.

423
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,120
Wait, what should I change?

424
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,800
Any number higher than 60 doesn't matter.

425
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,820
Also, I hit 120... 143.

426
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,460
You hit 144.

427
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,300
Wait, that's like a legit monitor then.

428
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,800
Yeah.

429
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,540
Yeah.

430
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,120
Yeah, so what happened is Shiloh probably bought the monitors like six.

431
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,240
144Hz.

432
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,760
And then it keeps getting to 60Hz the whole time.

433
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,180
Bro.

434
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,180
See, now you're like...

435
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Now you have no excuse for your FPS playing.

436
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,560
Oh, everything turned dark.

437
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,000
Help.

438
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Oh, no.

439
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,600
We're broken.

440
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,540
No.

441
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,940
We're broken.

442
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,080
Oh, wow.

443
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,060
Whoa.

444
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,680
Whoa.

445
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,220
I see no difference.

446
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,960
There's no way you see no difference.

447
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,120
Well, she's not even in any game yet.

448
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,660
Of course she says no difference.

449
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,160
You can see it with the mouse cursor.

450
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,720
What's different on my mouse cursor?

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,240
Wait.

452
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,140
It's smoother.

453
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:01,620
It's more smoother.

454
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,380
Yeah, because it's not 60 frames now.

455
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,680
It has more... it has more...

456
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,740
It has more... it has more...

457
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,400
It has more...

458
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,400
it has more...

459
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,080
Whoa.

460
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,320
It's smoother.

461
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,020
That's why I hate 3D cartoons, man.

462
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,320
You're never gonna get me with that.

463
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,880
The human eye can only see 30 FPS.

464
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,100
I fucking... I fucking hate that comment so much.

465
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,660
It's like, why are you always complaining about frames?

466
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,780
We can only see 30 frames per second.

467
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,820
Dog logic.

468
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,840
All right.

469
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,260
They're apparently checking settings now.

470
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,000
Cheer for you.

471
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,160
I'll show that to people.

472
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:30,640
Oh.

473
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,280
Yeah, don't worry, Team Captain.

474
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,620
I'm...

475
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,560
I've already been on it.

476
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:33,940
Whoa.

477
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,660
You gotta...

478
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,140
Gotta remember to scroll slowly so we can verify all settings all the time.

479
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,960
And just scrolling up and down because they don't know if they're looking or not.

480
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,660
Alright, here we go.

481
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,140
I can't wait to start this... this PAL World adventure with all of you.

482
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:53,900
Yippee!

483
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,700
I can't wait to be dead, Wade.

484
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,780
Me too!

485
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,540
Dude, I've played so much but I've played so casually.

486
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,460
You know like when you play Animal Crossing and you're like, this is nice.

487
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,920
And you go visit your friend's island and it's just like fully terraformed and you're like, Wade, what the fuck?

488
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,580
Okay, what's easy to do that?

489
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,220
Is this a bad time to admit that the PAL World base building contest was mostly based on aesthetic?

490
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,580
Yes, because I saw you on the competition and I was like, you know what?

491
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,460
This person seems to know what they're doing.

492
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,080
Gotta...

493
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,940
It worked, it worked!

494
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,480
Someone lied on their resume when I was looking.

495
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,320
Looking for players.

496
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,460
When you show up to your job and you don't know what you're doing.

497
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,260
Oh my god.

498
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,400
I came in with the confidence of a guy.

499
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,280
Like a 30 year old white guy at an interview.

500
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,280
And then she had all these vouchers underneath her and I was like, you know what?

501
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,040
People are vouching for... surely she knows what the fuck she's doing.

502
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,240
People are vouching for her.

503
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,860
Like, she knows, surely.

504
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,280
No, I do, I do, I do, I do.

505
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,380
But I also make it look nice.

506
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:01,800
Okay.

507
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,040
We don't care.

508
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,960
There's no points in whether or not it looks nice.

509
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,760
Okay.

510
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,160
Alright, I'll abuse the pals.

511
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,000
That's what my caption wishes.

512
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,080
I'll abuse the pals and I'll make it ugly as well.

513
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,240
Which face has the most aesthetic...

514
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,040
There's no... which face has the most aesthetic face.

515
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,080
They should have that.

516
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,280
They should have it.

517
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,660
We should ask them to make a rule just for us.

518
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,120
Put that in there.

519
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,640
Just for us.

520
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,660
I like how some of my chat, when people attack the base they'll be in awe of how nice it looks.

521
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,600
Exactly.

522
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,400
They're like, whoa, this looks nice, what the fuck?

523
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,240
They're like, oh my god, we can't attack that base.

524
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Oh my god, look at how much work they put into it.

525
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,000
Wow.

526
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,500
Wow.

527
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,240
See?

528
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,860
Yeah.

529
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,620
You get it, see?

530
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,260
We understand.

531
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,160
We just get it.

532
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,980
Alright, let's see.

533
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,880
I think they haven't even checked us yet, please.

534
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Please.

535
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,060
We just want to join the survey.

536
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,840
Do they come in here?

537
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,400
Do they just randomly come in my stream?

538
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,180
I think they just look at your stream because it says just scroll up and down until it happens.

539
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,140
Until it happens.

540
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,220
Until it happens.

541
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,360
Just get in and out until it happens.

542
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,580
I'm all tabbed right now until they tell me something.

543
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,920
We're voice number six.

544
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,840
How long does it take to get to six?

545
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah, you said this would be fast, huh?

546
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,020
First time.

547
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,780
First time.

548
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,440
First time.

549
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,480
Oh my god.

550
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,220
Please, we just want to play PAL World.

551
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,860
Let us in.

552
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,380
Let us in.

553
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,100
Let us in.

554
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,340
Oh my.

555
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,100
They should give us names for creative pet names too.

556
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,240
By the way, some PALs at the beginning that will be really, really useful.

557
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,100
If somebody can get that like Tom Bat cat thing, that would be really, really helpful.

558
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,240
If you can bring that to our base, that would be really great.

559
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,240
Okay, why am I being pointed out again?

560
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,700
Because you're power leveling.

561
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,460
It spawns at night in like the starter area.

562
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,740
But like mostly like towards like the bottom of this one hill.

563
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,320
You see, this is exactly why I got you.

564
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,240
You already know where people spawn.

565
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,560
I already played like three days of PAL World when it first launched and then I was done.

566
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,460
I have a hundred and twenty hours in the game, but I also let my chat backseat a lot.

567
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,740
I mean, that's the point.

568
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,500
That's the point of streaming.

569
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,780
Why the fuck would you do it for yourself when you can just have them backseat?

570
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,900
Why won't they verify me?

571
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,540
Dang, you sound so desperate.

572
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,440
Stop trying to get verified so hard.

573
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,060
It's kind of cringe.

574
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,540
I'm so fucking lonely.

575
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,420
I just want the touch of an admin.

576
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,400
All host verified so hard.

577
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,660
Dang, he's desperate.

578
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,860
Dang, this Discord kitten really be out here purring.

579
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,640
I'm not a kitten.

580
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,060
Silence kitten.

581
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,820
No.

582
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,360
Admin master hasn't approved your presence yet.

583
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,100
Oh my god.

584
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,020
All host verified.

585
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,100
Start the world and share the code with your...

586
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,040
We're not even verified yet.

587
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,400
We're not verified yet.

588
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,160
We're not verified yet.

589
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,960
Well, it's not against me to verify it.

590
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,260
Please let us in.

591
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,600
Verified by the way.

592
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,080
It's okay.

593
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,340
Please.

594
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,240
We've been looking at the same achievement list for so long.

595
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:52,160
I just like the mental image of like, okay, once you start the world, you better stay in the cave area though.

596
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,620
Don't walk away from there until we start the timer, okay?

597
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,920
How would they know?

598
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,340
Okay.

599
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:57,680
Okay.

600
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,160
Okay.

601
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,600
Oh, that's sure.

602
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,000
God damn sure where you baited me.

603
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,640
I thought they talked in their chat.

604
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,640
Vegeta and Piccolo not big fan of the...

605
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,800
What the fuck is this?

606
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
Can this be our team song?

607
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,580
Can this be your team song?

608
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,060
Yeah, link it in the team chat.

609
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,400
All right.

610
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,180
Oh god, I need to make sure that people don't hear this.

611
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,080
What?

612
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,200
Let them hear.

613
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,780
Vegeta needs to speak.

614
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,140
It was parent-child.

615
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,740
Mental advisory.

616
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,760
Explosive content.

617
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,900
Look up Vegeta and Piccolo not a big fan of the government rap.

618
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,440
There you go.

619
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,560
This is our team song.

620
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,260
This is the song.

621
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,960
My chat was like, let him speak.

622
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,280
What the fuck?

623
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,720
Let him speak.

624
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,500
Let him speak.

625
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,180
I am not...

626
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,180
I am not supposed to be letting my chat hear.

627
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,020
It's saying we're starting in five minutes.

628
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,020
How do I know if I'm verified or not?

629
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,340
We don't even have characters yet.

630
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,160
How do I ping an admin?

631
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,940
I need at least ten minutes to make a campaign.

632
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,600
Come on.

633
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,580
I gotta get that aesthetic.

634
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,100
Admin.

635
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,540
Help.

636
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,560
Am I verified?

637
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,300
Help.

638
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,180
Help.

639
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:18,600
Help.

640
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:18,880
Help.

641
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,860
I gotta hide the screen for a second.

642
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,700
The world name is Among Us Island.

643
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,680
Nice.

644
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,920
Join multiplayer game.

645
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,940
Alright, give us the code, surefour.

646
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,620
I'm closing the thing.

647
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,420
And then I'm...

648
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,800
Look at that.

649
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,120
Finalized.

650
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,800
Where the fuck do I get the code?

651
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,820
What do I click?

652
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,480
We're...

653
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,400
Okay, this is bad that we're all so very confused right now.

654
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,180
Wait, did you send the code in the voice chat?

655
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,600
I don't know where the code is.

656
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:00,900
Oh shit.

657
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,440
Okay.

658
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,560
I don't remember.

659
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,460
It's been so long.

660
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,020
It's been so long since I played this.

661
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,160
I'm customizing my character real quick.

662
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,260
What the fuck?

663
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Oh my gosh.

664
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,520
Oh my god.

665
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,620
My Discord crashed.

666
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,600
No!

667
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:14,860
No!

668
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,580
Goodbye Discord.

669
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,700
Okay, I need to make a new browser apparently.

670
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,040
Since my Discord crashed.

671
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,000
It's not one of your achievements, bro.

672
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,000
Don't worry.

673
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,040
It should be fine, right?

674
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
No, it's not fine.

675
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:26,900
Okay.

676
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,440
Don't worry.

677
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,020
It'll be fine.

678
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,780
I think we need...

679
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,500
Oh my god.

680
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,440
Why are you not showing up?

681
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,140
I'm not showing up on Discord.

682
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,060
What?

683
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,840
I think we need the IP address and then a password or something.

684
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,460
I don't leak my RP.

685
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,700
Well...

686
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:43,920
No.

687
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,700
Three minutes.

688
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,200
Three minutes until timer starts!

689
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:46,520
I guess that's the end of this team.

690
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,500
Team Doki Bird is over.

691
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,380
Where do I get the code?

692
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,480
I don't fucking...

693
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:51,980
Google it.

694
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,520
I don't fucking know.

695
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,140
Google it.

696
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,680
Check the invite code for this world on the options screen after starting the game.

697
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,260
Okay.

698
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,020
Okay.

699
00:25:59,640 --> 00:25:59,960
Google it.

700
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,880
We only got three minutes!

701
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,480
One, two, three.

702
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,420
One, two, three.

703
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,160
Calm down.

704
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,240
Counts down from 180.

705
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,820
Nah, it's chill.

706
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,280
I think a minute isn't gonna make much of a difference anyway.

707
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,220
We're gonna get okay.

708
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,120
A minute is a pretty long time, okay?

709
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,440
Yeah.

710
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,920
What the fuck are you talking about?

711
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,380
It makes all the difference!

712
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,200
This is a serious update!

713
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,520
I'm posting the invite code in the team chat.

714
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,740
It is available for everyone now.

715
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,280
Yay!

716
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,740
Oh, okay.

717
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,460
Yay!

718
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,140
But also the timer starts in three minutes, but we don't start starting.

719
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,880
Oh, okay.

720
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,080
Okay.

721
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,860
That's not a problem then.

722
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,980
Alright, so I can't fix my Discord, Fugi, so nobody will know who's talking now.

724
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,760
I'm so professional.

725
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,980
It is I, Fugi's mom.

726
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,760
Hello.

727
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,460
Alright.

728
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,520
Do we have our code yet?

729
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,520
Okay.

730
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,480
I posted it.

731
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:49,940
What the frick?

732
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,560
Okay.

733
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,260
How do I join?

734
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,900
Wait, what's the IP?

735
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,960
We don't need the IP.

736
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,900
You go to the code one.

737
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,060
We don't need the IP.

738
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,820
Oh, there's a code one?

739
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

740
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
It wasn't working for us.

741
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,040
It wasn't working for us.

742
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,740
It was in the first week, so I hadn't used it before.

743
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,420
Oh, join multi...

744
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,680
Oh my God, there's a code.

745
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,160
That's what we've been saying, team captain.

746
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,020
Wow.

747
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,340
Team captain?

748
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,860
You didn't even know Jack shit.

749
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,580
Team captains are known for their leadership.

750
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,920
You didn't even know what was going on.

751
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,040
Alright, character build, speed run.

752
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,260
Okay.

753
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,740
Oh shit.

754
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,760
Alright, here we go.

755
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,680
There we go.

756
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,880
Okay, cuz I have changed the hat color.

757
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,100
Alright, I'm gonna show people the game now.

758
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,080
Alright.

759
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,700
That looks like me.

760
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,280
30 on 30.

761
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,600
Okay.

762
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,530
We're not allowed to leave the starting area.

763
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,010
No.

764
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,510
No.

765
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,030
We're stuck in our cages.

766
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,850
We'll be fine.

767
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,450
So many constraints.

768
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,090
When will I finally be free?

769
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,390
There you go.

770
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,370
In like two minutes apparently.

771
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,070
Oh, then I can talk about drugs?

772
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:07,630
Yeah.

773
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,090
Complete.

774
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,590
I'm getting my hair color.

775
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,670
I'm alive.

776
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,790
I'm good to go.

777
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,090
Okay, I might need to look a little bit more healthy.

778
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,850
Roger, Dodger.

779
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,210
Alright, there we go.

780
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,770
Make sure it's thick.

781
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,890
The towers are the key to the treeholds.

782
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,170
Wait, this game has lore?

783
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,370
I did not know that.

784
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,650
You have 150 hours on this game.

785
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,110
What do you mean?

786
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,490
I just thought it was like pew pew pokemon.

787
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,290
Wait, the timer started.

788
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,770
Wait, the timer started?

789
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,970
Wait, I'm not even in.

790
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,810
You guys have to get in the guild first.

791
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,790
Oh my god.

792
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,370
They started the timer.

793
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,590
Wait, how do I skip this?

794
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,730
Everyone hold F on me.

795
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,950
I'm holding F.

796
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,250
F on the tower.

797
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,370
Oh my god.

798
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,530
What the heck is going on here?

799
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,490
Accepted.

800
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,630
We're so thick.

801
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:11,630
I'm missing one.

802
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,490
Accepted.

803
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,350
I think we can all just go now.

804
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,790
Where's our base?

805
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,250
Figure it out, motherfucker.

806
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,150
What do you mean?

807
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,070
We're a team.

808
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,010
Timer starts.

809
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,610
I'm power leveling.

810
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,850
Okay, goodbye.

811
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,790
I'll give you 10 wood.

812
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,190
Alright, guys.

813
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,890
Let's punch this Mammorant out.

814
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,870
We all punch it together.

815
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,510
It'll be fine.

816
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,010
We can just punch him and keep respawning, right?

817
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,630
That's an exploit.

818
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,130
That's true.

819
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,790
We all just keep punching it.

820
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,670
Eventually.

821
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,750
We don't even have balls to catch it.

822
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,630
Like, what's the point?

823
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,550
Alright.

824
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,570
We just need his mead.

825
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:52,770
Alright.

826
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,710
Where are we building our base, PP?

827
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,790
Well, first off, go ahead and start making yourself some balls.

828
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,750
I'm making a workbench right here.

829
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,070
Alright.

830
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:03,890
I'm just gonna punch you.

831
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,250
I'm gonna punch this lamb.

832
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,610
Oh, I need a chicken so I can level it to level 30.

833
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,990
Yeah, you can fight one Mon first so you get to level 2.

834
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,550
Level 2!

835
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,010
Level 2 time.

836
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,750
Nice.

837
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:14,770
I'm level 3!

838
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,110
And then you can start catching people.

839
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:16,870
The fuck?

840
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:17,790
How are you level 3?

841
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,570
What do you mean?

842
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,370
Is our power leveler not leveling up?

843
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,750
Wait, what should our stats be?

844
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,370
Oh my god, level 4!

845
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,130
Hell yeah!

846
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,370
Go to technology, unlock pal spheres.

847
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,370
I know, but what stats should we bank on then?

848
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,630
For right now?

849
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,370
Yeah.

850
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,830
For right now, if you die, just go to this one.

851
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,350
But our stats, though...

852
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,410
Oh, stats?

853
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,770
Depends on what you're maxing.

854
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,930
I'm gonna do work speed and weight.

855
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,650
I think I'm gonna do stompie nomie nomie.

856
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,670
I'm gonna do a weight for now.

857
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,270
Oh shit!

858
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,270
This rock isn't real.

859
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,870
What do you mean it's not real?

860
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,410
I can't punch it.

861
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,390
It'd be faster if I actually just got it.

862
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,270
I'm just gonna fucking fuck you.

863
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,510
Alright.

864
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,310
Alright, how do I need...

865
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,710
Wood and stone.

866
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,690
Ah fuck.

867
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,710
Alright, punch some rocks.

868
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,450
Look at us go, we're so efficient.

869
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,950
Shepard, what level are you now?

870
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,650
Our power level.

871
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,450
Uh, 32.

872
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,530
Damn, wow.

873
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,710
By the way, if you need to build a bench, you can deconstruct it and get the materials back.

874
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:21,930
I hit level 2!

875
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,270
What do you mean?

876
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,350
I hit level 2, we're level 3 and 4!

877
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,750
Wait, what do I need?

878
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,610
I need, uh...

879
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:28,810
I need more stone.

880
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,410
Alright, let's see.

881
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,110
Take that back.

882
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,350
Wait.

883
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:37,870
Wait, I needed that.

884
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,490
This is our power level.

885
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,570
Give me my rocks!

886
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,990
Hey, can you build that workbench again?

887
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,590
Wait, what happened to our workbench?

888
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,910
Wait, what's our team name?

889
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:48,610
What the heck?

890
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,090
Vegeta and Piccolo.

891
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,470
Right now it's our name too.

892
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,170
What's that as an acronym?

893
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,470
VPHTG.

894
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:02,850
VPHTG.

895
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:03,550
VPHTG.

896
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:09,350
Basically what we're gonna do is, we're gonna work our way towards where we're gonna set up the base and just catch shit along the way.

897
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:10,790
Sounds good.

898
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,350
Just head towards Desolate Church.

899
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,210
If you get lost, just, uh, you know, ask the gods where it is.

900
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,550
Ask the gods?

901
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,270
Alright, no problem.

902
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,010
Ask the gods.

903
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,150
Yes, the gods.

904
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,430
Let me tab out real quick and ask the gods.

905
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,790
That's crazy.

906
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,750
Guys, I can't ask the gods if I'm in-game.

907
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,830
I'm just saying.

908
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,070
The gods can't know I'm sitting playing Power World.

909
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,890
Yeah, the gods can't know I'm playing it.

910
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,370
It's blasphemous when you're playing Power World.

911
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,670
What the heck?

912
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,030
No, gods, don't look.

913
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,410
Gods, don't look.

914
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,590
I'm sorry, it's not Pokémon.

915
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,170
Don't look.

916
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,990
Legally distinct Pokémon.

917
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,730
Legally distinct Pokémon.

918
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,450
Let's see.

919
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,110
Let's see.

920
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,450
Work speed.

921
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,230
Am I close to- Oh yes, nice, I can build an axe too.

922
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,150
Oh yes, nice, I can build an axe too.

923
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,070
Don't say the P word, the lawyers are coming.

924
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,150
Power has been in development for like two plus years.

925
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:15,370
Power has been in development for like two plus years.

926
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,050
If Nintendo couldn't stop it before then, Nintendo can't stop it now.

927
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:19,930
True.

928
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,210
Valid based drill.

929
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,770
True.

930
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,270
Preach.

931
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,270
I need more stone.

932
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,010
Crap.

933
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,630
Nice, I can catch a chicken now.

934
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,710
Alright, where's my chicken?

935
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,650
The chicken's gonna be my only pal.

936
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,070
I don't even know if the game volume is like okay.

937
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,630
Just a team of chickens.

938
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,490
I'm sure it's fine.

939
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,550
I need to make my pickaxe.

940
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:43,990
Alright, there we go.

941
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:49,850
Why the fuck is there another fucking- Oh shit, I'm- Also, don't forget to get wool.

942
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,030
Otherwise you're gonna freeze to death at night.

943
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,590
So kill some of the little sheep.

944
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,390
Nice.

945
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,190
I'm trying to remember how to throw a pal spear.

946
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:58,690
Murder is wrong.

947
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,610
Murder is wrong from our pal leveler?

948
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,630
That's a problem.

949
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,890
That's a problem right there.

950
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:09,710
That's a problem right there.

951
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,110
I don't kill, I capture.

952
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,840
You capture humanely?

953
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,430
Yeah, ethically.

954
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,070
Is it an ethical capture?

955
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,350
How do you know it's ethical?

956
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:19,890
Is it free range?

957
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,470
Yes, it's free range.

958
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:27,710
One of the global events is we have to get 20 humans and put them in the viewing cage.

959
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:28,590
Oh yeah.

960
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,470
Oh wow, that's neat.

961
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,190
I love that.

962
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,090
I mean we had to catch like five of them earlier too.

963
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,130
Oh my god, my chicken is level five!

964
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,210
I'm killing all the chickens!

965
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:49,870
Alright, let me- Some free points are just flying around and getting max lift monk energy or whatever the fuck it is.

966
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,470
Oh shit, I mean, I could do that.

967
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,070
I'm surprised lift monk is not a goal.

968
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,210
There's like 400 of them on the map.

969
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,230
It's a global goal.

970
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,910
It's a global.

971
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,530
So do we have to catch all of them?

972
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,050
If you get level 10, you get like 150 points.

973
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,130
Oh, okay.

974
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,470
Oh, so all of us have to do it technically.

975
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,630
I mean, the gods would be able to help with it, but I don't know.

976
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,470
Yeah, yeah, the gods.

977
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,050
The gods.

978
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,870
But I can tell you, I got to level 10 doing that and it was a lot of fun.

979
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,150
It took me like 10 hours, so I don't know how worth it is.

980
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,350
Yeah, yeah, we could totally do that in like 8 hours.

981
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,090
You just get a flying pet and then fly around.

982
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,170
You have to max it up.

983
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,870
My little chicken, go do your job.

984
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,350
Oh my god, there's a chicken rolling down.

985
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,250
No, don't get distracted by treasure.

986
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,130
Why do I always do this?

987
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,830
Treasure!

988
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,170
Are we doing okay?

989
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,230
I can't even tell.

990
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,590
We're doing great, right?

991
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,250
Are we doing okay, guys?

992
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,450
The first hour is going to be a little rough.

993
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,770
It's okay, I still have my chicken here having a great time.

994
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,070
We're good, we're good.

995
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,730
Yeah, I can tell it's having a good time.

996
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,970
I can see its health dwindling.

997
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,030
Yeah, yeah.

998
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,190
Minus 20.

999
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,070
He's doing great, he's doing great.

1000
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,710
I'm going to get the gumara so we can have seeds.

1001
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,610
So we can plant.

1002
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,610
There's so many dead animals on the ground as I'm walking.

1003
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,810
They all spawn next to us.

1004
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,490
Which is great.

1005
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,510
Alright, get over here.

1006
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,830
Wait, where is our base going to be again?

1007
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,710
Our base is going to be...

1008
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,410
Keep walking.

1009
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,750
Do you see the tower in the distance?

1010
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,930
You're going to walk towards that.

1011
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,650
And then you're going to turn left.

1012
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,610
Okay, I see it.

1013
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,690
Get over here.

1014
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,950
Oh my god, get the fuck over here.

1015
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:40,810
There you go.

1016
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,210
Everything will be fine.

1017
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:48,530
Yay!

1018
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:48,950
Yay!

1019
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,690
Alright.

1020
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,690
Where's the...

1021
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,210
Do you guys have another bench down there?

1022
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,070
Or no?

1023
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,690
You can just build and disassemble.

1024
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,450
Oh, okay.

1025
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,030
Look at that.

1026
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,910
This is why you're on my team.

1027
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,290
This is why you matter.

1028
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,610
This is why you matter.

1029
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,270
This is why you matter.

1030
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:12,870
You matter.

1031
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,290
That's a way to put it, I guess.

1032
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:16,830
Finally!

1033
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,810
You are an asset to this company.

1034
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,910
See, parents, you were wrong.

1035
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,390
Look, mom, I'm madder.

1036
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,370
I'm doing it!

1037
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:28,670
See?

1038
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,650
I'm not a disgrace being a 2D anime girl.

1039
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,190
We have literally been slaughtering everything.

1040
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,370
I just saw one of the little wooly guys and I was like, Oh, I'm going to fight him.

1041
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:38,610
Dead.

1042
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,550
Literally dead.

1043
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:40,430
That's the fourth one.

1044
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,130
Nice.

1045
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,810
Should have killed them faster.

1046
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,350
Alright, chicken.

1047
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,050
Go fight, chicken!

1048
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,170
Riot?

1049
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,550
Great asset.

1050
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,290
Go fight.

1051
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,370
Nice.

1052
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,750
Go, chicken, go.

1053
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,070
Go, chicken, go.

1054
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,470
I should have had the lift monk right at the start.

1055
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,410
That's fine.

1056
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:06,890
Nice.

1057
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,550
My chicken's level 7 now.

1058
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,630
That's right, I only have worthless pals right now.

1059
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,830
Where are the penguin pals?

1060
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,790
Don't we need that for like...

1061
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,090
Kind of near base, actually.

1062
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,910
Oh, there you go.

1063
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,730
Oh, is this the base?

1064
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,810
Uh, are you already up there?

1065
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:27,470
No.

1066
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,810
Oh, wait, this isn't the base.

1067
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,670
Sorry, I got a little lost already.

1068
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,670
Alright, grab stuff.

1069
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,550
Nice, free items.

1070
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,270
Yeah, I'll try to get to the base ahead of everybody else.

1071
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,910
My little chicken.

1072
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,390
I'm sure I don't end up over encumbered.

1073
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,130
My little chicken.

1074
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,550
I like being cucumber.

1075
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,350
I don't know what... I'm gonna name this chicken.

1076
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,450
Wait, how do you name your pals?

1077
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,930
Uh, in the menu.

1078
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,090
In the menu?

1079
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,210
Can you press F on them or something?

1080
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,450
If you go to your party, you can name them.

1081
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,470
Oh!

1082
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:05,950
Okay.

1083
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,230
I'll name you...

1084
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,270
How do I name it?

1085
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,930
Where the fuck is it?

1086
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,670
Can I just go this way?

1087
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,150
Where the fuck do you name it?

1088
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,030
Maybe I can just go this way.

1089
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,850
Also, there's an egg.

1090
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,130
Oh, yeah!

1091
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:21,750
Pick up eggs!

1092
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,690
Oh, yeah!

1093
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:22,690
Pick up eggs!

1094
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,330
I just picked up... Yeah, I picked one up.

1095
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,030
Oh, there it is!

1096
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,390
That's the best way to get good pals without being in a high level area.

1097
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:29,890
That's the best way to get good pals without being in a high level area.

1098
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:30,770
Okay.

1099
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:36,370
If you don't have space, just get rid of the small ones before you get rid of the big ones.

1100
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,570
Don't worry.

1101
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,470
I have so much space right now.

1102
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,550
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

1103
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,570
There's so many dead pals here.

1104
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,850
I wonder who did that.

1105
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,250
Who did that?

1106
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,650
That's crazy.

1107
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,550
Holy shit!

1108
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,030
I wonder who did that.

1109
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,190
Everywhere I go, I see dead pals.

1110
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,730
You know the official Pal World YouTube channel posted that short about cooking lamb bells?

1111
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,070
Yes!

1112
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,010
I saw it!

1113
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,530
I was like, ah!

1114
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:11,950
The creator does Pokemon versions too.

1115
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,870
Oh my god, watch the Pokemon versions.

1116
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,050
The versions are like more fucked up.

1117
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:21,050
I love how like, Pal World people are like, yeah, we want them to make something for us.

1118
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,370
Do me next!

1119
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,030
Do me next!

1120
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,110
Do me next!

1121
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,470
Yeah, me, me, me!

1122
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,050
Nintendo, this is what we've been asking for all these years.

1123
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,550
Nintendo would never.

1124
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,250
I wanna make normal sandwiches.

1125
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,230
I wanna make Pokemon sandwiches.

1126
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,070
Oh, me too.

1127
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,090
What would be the tastiest Pokemon sandwich though?

1128
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,850
What would be the tastiest Pokemon sandwich though?

1129
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,070
Wait, what's the wagyu of Pokemon?

1130
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,110
Isn't there like a cow Pokemon?

1131
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:50,830
Milk tank?

1132
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,490
I don't think...

1133
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,270
Yeah, Taurus, Taurus!

1134
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,790
No, Taurus would be...

1135
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,110
Yeah, but he would be chewy.

1136
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,130
He's got too much muscle.

1137
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:56,910
Taurus?

1138
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,330
I bet it'll taste like jam.

1139
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,170
I feel like legendary...

1140
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,150
Wait a minute, I'm a slime, I can't agree to that.

1141
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,950
I feel like legendary Pokemon would be like the most juicy.

1142
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,630
Cause they're like aged really well too.

1143
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,850
No, no, cause like you know how like the older they are, the more aged they are.

1144
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,650
It's not about the juice, it's about the mouth.

1145
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,170
It's about the marbling.

1146
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,850
Yeah, but wouldn't like legendary Pokemon have like really good marbling?

1147
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,530
If you think about it.

1148
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,370
Since they're legendary.

1149
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,790
You gotta think about the one with the most like fat on it.

1150
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,630
Wouldn't that mean Chansey would be the most delicious one?

1151
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,850
No, cause then there's also Slowpoke.

1152
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:28,710
Maybe it's just Fluffy.

1153
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,290
Snorlax!

1154
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:30,830
No, Snorlax!

1155
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,250
Wait, Snorlax's tail is good, right?

1156
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,110
Oh, Snorlax!

1157
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,270
He doesn't move!

1158
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,710
But then it's mostly fat though.

1159
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,130
But wouldn't it mostly be fat?

1160
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,830
It's gonna be hard to get lean meat from Snorlax.

1161
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,110
Maybe he can combine Pokemon.

1162
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,710
You can use his fat to like fry another Pokemon.

1163
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:49,430
Oh, true!

1164
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,190
Like use his fat to make bacon.

1165
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,410
If you think about it.

1166
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,590
What is the bacon of Pokemon?

1167
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,250
What is the bacon of Pokemon?

1168
00:41:59,250 --> 00:41:59,750
The little pig.

1169
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,710
The little fried pig.

1170
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,850
He can fry himself too.

1171
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,530
Cause he's fire type.

1172
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,750
Tee pig?

1173
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,130
But they're hard to breed.

1174
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,370
You don't need to...

1175
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,170
I mean...

1176
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,630
They're like too rare to be the bacon of Pokemon.

1177
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,530
Depends on whether you have Nintendo online.

1178
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,670
Cause if you have Nintendo online, then...

1179
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,370
Every time you go to the mystery trade, all you're gonna get is...

1180
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,390
Nintendo online.

1181
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,510
Someone says Lechon.

1182
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,190
You're free to play or pay to play.

1183
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:29,990
That's the question.

1184
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,050
Alright, I'm placing our Pell Box.

1185
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,130
Give me one second.

1186
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,250
Okay, I wanna move over just a little bit.

1187
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,290
So I can get the trees as well.

1188
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,310
I need to get more...

1189
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,290
Balls.

1190
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,770
This is maybe the best I'm gonna get.

1191
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,890
My chickpea's level 9 now!

1192
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,570
Look at him go!

1193
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,490
No, I think it should be further over.

1194
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:53,790
Where am I?

1195
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,730
Is this me?

1196
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:55,650
This is me.

1197
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,170
Alright, I'm heading over to our base.

1198
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,770
Okay, building it now.

1199
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,230
You should be able to fast travel once I finish it in 5 seconds.

1200
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,130
Oh, oh yeah!

1201
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,390
Fast travel!

1202
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,470
Almost forgot.

1203
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:11,970
Head to the...

1204
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:12,550
Alright, set.

1205
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,350
Alright, build a wooden chest.

1206
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,190
And deploy a Pell.

1207
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,490
Lucky as I have a human.

1208
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,990
Wait, you caught one already?

1209
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,030
Nice!

1210
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,670
Oh my god!

1211
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,070
Nice!

1212
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,510
We just need 19 more.

1213
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,590
We need to build our little...

1214
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,230
Four more.

1215
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,330
No, but four of them has to be level 10.

1216
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,950
Oh, but I guess we could power level them.

1217
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:37,850
To be level 10.

1218
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,950
Do we have to catch them?

1219
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,430
Do we have to catch them at level 10?

1220
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,470
Or do we have to power...

1221
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,830
Do they just have to be level 10?

1222
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,870
I don't remember.

1223
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,270
How are they gonna know?

1224
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,650
Watching our streams?

1225
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,390
No, what the fuck?

1226
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,350
Seriously, we have to sit through this bullshit?

1227
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:56,790
What?

1228
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,150
Our mods...

1229
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,610
I did not consent to be tracked.

1230
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,650
I didn't accept the cookies.

1231
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,310
Yeah, we didn't consent to be like...

1232
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,910
Moderated in a tournament.

1233
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,070
What the fuck?

1234
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,330
Are you trying to tell me?

1235
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,730
It's an invasion of my privacy.

1236
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,230
Watching us right now?

1237
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,290
That's fucking illegal.

1238
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,950
Oh, I should grab some iron.

1239
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:23,990
Alright.

1240
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,890
We're base level 2.

1241
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,030
Shoddy bed, primitive workbench.

1242
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:30,490
Alright.

1243
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,750
Oh no, my weapon!

1244
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,110
I have a damaged weapon.

1245
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,670
Do we have a repair shop in the base?

1246
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:38,650
I'm about to build it.

1247
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,430
Not yet though.

1248
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,050
What do you mean by shop?

1249
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,710
Someone just asked me how I get rid of being wanted without dying.

1250
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:46,390
I don't know.

1251
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,890
Just don't even witness, man.

1252
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,110
Just don't look.

1253
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,290
It's that easy.

1254
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,030
Close your eyes.

1255
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,930
Tell me about how much you're wanted.

1256
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,210
That's kinda cringe, bro.

1257
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,230
Uh, stone and wood.

1258
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,270
I need supplies.

1259
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:03,970
If you can put supplies in the chest, I can search for more stuff.

1260
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,950
Alright, here's some meat.

1261
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,010
Here's some wood.

1262
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,110
Some rope.

1263
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,470
I'll put the eggs here too.

1264
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,710
I need to build a shoddy bed.

1265
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,370
Which means that I need infrastructure.

1266
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:13,770
Oh!

1267
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,570
A raider!

1268
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,350
Oh, we're already raiding?

1269
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,130
Damn!

1270
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:17,790
That's fast.

1271
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:19,730
Okay.

1272
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,730
Alright, I'll put some wooden foundation here.

1273
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,650
Oh, we can catch them!

1274
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,650
Let's catch these guys!

1275
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:27,770
Let's do it!

1276
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,150
Let's do it!

1277
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,790
Okay, I don't have any...

1278
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,310
Okay, here we go.

1279
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,610
Let me make some balls right now.

1280
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:35,790
Balls.

1281
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:37,490
Balls.

1282
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,310
I need more wood.

1283
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,970
If anybody has an abundance of wood, if you can bring them back to the base, that'd be great.

1284
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,350
I can bring some back.

1285
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,850
In the meantime, let me assign some pals.

1286
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:47,770
Oh, here they come!

1287
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:48,150
Here they come!

1288
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,570
Here they come!

1289
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:49,010
Oh, shit!

1290
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,670
They're really fucking cute!

1291
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,390
They're not even the good ones!

1292
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,270
Yeah, but they're cute though.

1293
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:56,530
They got the gamer hoodie.

1294
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,250
They probably bring gamer subs.

1295
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,510
Probably their entire blood.

1296
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:01,950
Alright, alright.

1297
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,050
Let's get ready to chill.

1298
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,930
Alright, alright.

1299
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:07,350
Let's get ready to chill.

1300
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,410
Alright, there you go.

1301
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,610
Aw, they're not even the humans!

1302
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:11,930
What's the point?

1303
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,290
They'll cut these trees for us.

1304
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,690
I already forgot what the achievements are.

1305
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,190
I just...

1306
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,290
Well, most of the day one achievements are just killing the field bosses.

1307
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:24,690
Oh, they are?

1308
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,110
Okay.

1309
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,650
A couple of pictures and...

1310
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,610
So we just all power level one level one and then just...

1311
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,430
We are gonna be base level three.

1312
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,830
I think you have to only get to base level seven.

1313
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,090
That's what the screenshot said.

1314
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:36,490
Really?

1315
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:36,770
Okay.

1316
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:37,830
Oh, it's twelve.

1317
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:38,270
It's twelve.

1318
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,210
The screenshot showed seven.

1319
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:45,010
I got to seven in about an hour yesterday when I tested it.

1320
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:49,390
Oh, that's... I think it's twelve because I think the screenshot is just to show you guys.

1321
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,810
And be like, this is how you take a screenshot.

1322
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,230
What are you doing here?

1323
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,410
This is how you take a screenshot.

1324
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,030
If you guys didn't know what it looks like, this is how the screenshot thing looks like.

1325
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,510
I'm gonna...

1326
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,170
I need the...

1327
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,090
Okay, I'm gonna...

1328
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,150
I need the...

1329
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,090
I can get piggies.

1330
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,250
They farm ore really well, the piggies.

1331
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,290
Let's see...

1332
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,090
Repair bench... are you making repair bench or am I making the repair bench?

1333
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,690
I can make it just one second.

1334
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,050
Okay, JK, I made it.

1335
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,190
That works too.

1336
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:27,990
Here we go.

1337
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:29,610
Nice.

1338
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,350
Let me repair my fucking pickaxe.

1339
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,330
Let me repair my fucking pickaxe.

1340
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:37,670
I'm gonna make clothes.

1341
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:39,870
Because I'm still naked.

1342
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,010
Oh yeah, it isn't even night time and we're already at this point.

1343
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:44,810
This is actually really good.

1344
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,070
Making pretty good time.

1345
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,330
I should not put this so close.

1346
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,090
I forgot how finicky everything is.

1347
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:53,490
Nah, burn it down.

1348
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:53,810
It's all good.

1349
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,030
Put it down.

1350
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,510
Alright, I need...

1351
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,990
Oh, I still need two cloths?

1352
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,890
Do I make...

1353
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,050
You should fast travel probably back to the start area.

1354
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:12,530
That's the fastest way to get wool is to kill the lambs.

1355
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,430
Yeah, I just need to make into cloth.

1356
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,550
No, it's cool.

1357
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,950
I forgot you can make cloth with wool.

1358
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:20,890
Nice.

1359
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,150
Now I'm not naked anymore.

1360
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:26,470
Yay.

1361
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:29,730
Yay.

1362
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,710
It's almost night time.

1363
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,630
I got my clothes on.

1364
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,590
Once it hits night time, if you guys can try to catch the flying bat thing.

1365
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,230
We can use him for mining.

1366
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,670
The tombat.

1367
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,230
I have one mining pile.

1368
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,390
I have the rush boar.

1369
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,330
Oh, the rush boar is good.

1370
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,290
Yeah, rush boar is nice.

1371
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,830
Yeah, you can just put it in for now to mine the iron.

1372
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,370
Puts the fire right next to the wood structure.

1373
00:48:59,130 --> 00:48:59,870
It's fine.

1374
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,690
What's gonna happen to us?

1375
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,450
What's the worst thing that can happen?

1376
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:05,050
Let's see.

1377
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,530
Oh yeah, I need to go fight Chilit so I can get ancient points.

1378
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,210
So I can get us a Gankubator.

1379
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:15,410
Oh.

1380
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:18,050
Alright.

1381
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,590
I need to be like level 15 for that.

1382
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,270
So I'll have to go level at some point.

1383
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,490
Yeah, go power level.

1384
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,610
Or somebody with a high level who unlocks it can just build it as well.

1385
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,530
Surefour, what's your level?

1386
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,330
I'm level level.

1387
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,030
You're level level?

1388
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,330
I'm level level.

1389
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,350
Are you in range to fight Chilit yet?

1390
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:46,190
I need fucking like arrows and shit for that, motherfucker.

1391
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,110
You don't need arrows.

1392
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,470
You can one man it.

1393
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,470
Yeah, I bet you.

1394
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,070
You're a gamer.

1395
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:51,570
Yeah.

1396
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,710
Well, yeah, I'm gonna one man it, of course.

1397
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,750
Yeah, but are you trying to say you're not good enough to do a vote?

1398
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,170
No, I'm saying I'm working on things.

1399
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,490
I said I'm working on things.

1400
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,690
What are you working on right now?

1401
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,010
I'm working on building a tower.

1402
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:09,510
I'm making nails so I can send them to a merchant so I can get millions of dollars so then I can buy arrows so I don't have to craft them.

1403
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,190
Why don't you just craft it?

1404
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,750
Because it takes two fucking years!

1405
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,170
But we have the ingot ore.

1406
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:18,990
You don't have to make...

1407
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,210
The ore is gonna be easy.

1408
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,350
Getting ingot is gonna be easy because of our base location.

1409
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,250
Exactly.

1410
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:25,950
Just skip arrows.

1411
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,010
Just go straight to gun.

1412
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,310
Yeah, just go straight to gun.

1413
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,790
Okay, wanna give me a freaking gun then?

1414
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,330
Ah shit, I forgot to make clothes.

1415
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:34,310
You're gonna need a gun for it.

1416
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:35,790
From where?

1417
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,330
We're not in America.

1418
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:43,350
If we're not in America, how do all these other people get guns?

1419
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,130
Alright, tell me where the closest fucking Walmart is.

1420
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,150
I'll get a fucking pump.

1421
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,870
You live in Central?

1422
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,530
You know where the closest Walmart is.

1423
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,030
How do I transfer that into Palworld?

1424
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,210
Turn your webcam on.

1425
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,150
While you go to Walmart.

1426
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,990
There you go.

1427
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,870
Easy.

1428
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,850
I forgot we all have to catch some to get the...

1429
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,990
What is it?

1430
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:09,410
The...

1431
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,610
Extra points.

1432
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,050
The registered points.

1433
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,610
I think you can just drop...

1434
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,230
Like give pals to other people.

1435
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:16,830
Oh my god!

1436
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:17,950
Yeah, that's so smart!

1437
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,110
You can!

1438
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,010
Just put them in the base.

1439
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,350
Yeah, and then we just pick it up and grab it.

1440
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:22,810
It's registered.

1441
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,570
That's actually so smart.

1442
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:26,910
Yeah.

1443
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,330
I don't have a tombad yet.

1444
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,030
But I have boar.

1445
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:30,650
In box.

1446
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:32,690
I'm gonna put...

1447
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,630
I have duck.

1448
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,930
If you take one from the base, it'll register in your thing.

1449
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,310
But it doesn't register as a first catch.

1450
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,450
So you can still get the bonus EXP.

1451
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,390
I'm only leveling stamina and carry weight.

1452
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:44,850
I'm only leveling stamina and carry weight.

1453
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:45,770
Alright, I put a...

1454
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,310
Do you need a penguin?

1455
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,710
I have penguin and a duck.

1456
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,730
You got a fuck?

1457
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:54,950
Yeah, I got a fuck.

1458
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,270
Oh, he finished the cloth.

1459
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,530
I got unused stats.

1460
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,930
He finishes but cannot acquire.

1461
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,690
Alright, I'll put it in.

1462
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:06,490
Oh.

1463
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,240
Alright.

1464
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,220
I need to make myself an outfit.

1465
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,200
My motherfucker's tombad.

1466
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,520
I can't see.

1467
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,440
It's so dark.

1468
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,500
Yeah, I got the...

1469
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,780
If you have the fire pal, it's really useful.

1470
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,720
Oh shit, you're right.

1471
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,260
You're so smart.

1472
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,160
Sometimes my brain cell hits the corner.

1473
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,220
And it's really far.

1474
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,400
You just have your one big breakthrough.

1475
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,080
You just have your one big breakthrough.

1476
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,100
I do shit myself in the process, but it's okay.

1477
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,160
Awkward silence.

1478
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,600
Ruminating.

1479
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,340
It's okay.

1480
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,940
You matter.

1481
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,880
Don't worry, Lily.

1482
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,480
You matter.

1483
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:54,580
Yeah.

1484
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,720
Silence can be a beautiful thing.

1485
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,720
Maybe I should just go back to the game.

1486
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,740
Maybe I should just shut the fuck up sometime.

1487
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,600
Who knows?

1488
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,600
Oh, wait.

1489
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,720
The presser can also mine.

1490
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,060
I can't find tombads yet, but...

1491
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,840
Okay, that's fine.

1492
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,660
We'll find it eventually.

1493
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:19,160
Oh, also, if somebody can get an elk, like that blue and purple, like, shiny elk looking thing.

1494
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,200
That thing helps with wood.

1495
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,420
Alright.

1496
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,660
We're not at that point yet, though, so no rush.

1497
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,300
Just gonna... let's see.

1498
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,400
Why do I want to go back to base?

1499
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,680
I don't even remember why I'm here.

1500
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,740
Where are you?

1501
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,980
I'm at the base.

1502
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,740
I'm at the base.

1503
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,780
I am bringing the presser.

1504
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,420
He's dead, though, so I have to put him in the box.

1505
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,940
Oh, yeah, I wanted to build more balls.

1506
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:44,960
Okay.

1507
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,500
Balls time.

1508
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,900
I mean, we're making good progress.

1509
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,140
Yeah, we're doing good.

1510
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,020
I think.

1511
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,460
We're only, like, less than 30 minutes in, so we're doing good.

1512
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,900
Oh my god, look at us go!

1513
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,680
Like, we gotta be doing, like, alright.

1514
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,420
Yeah, right?

1515
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,960
We can't be last, right?

1516
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,320
Right?

1517
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,000
I think we're base five now.

1518
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,520
Is there achievements for the towers?

1519
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,700
Yeah, there is.

1520
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,520
Wait, let me look at the achievement list.

1521
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:13,940
Base five.

1522
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,900
Achievement report.

1523
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,540
Where the fuck is the achievement link?

1524
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:17,900
Where?

1525
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:19,800
Okay.

1526
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,600
I'm gonna go to the chat for you so they can respond to chat while you're doing things in the game.

1527
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,080
Yeah, and that's PP's mod!

1528
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,440
It's not my mod!

1529
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,320
Do you know anything about multitasking?

1530
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,460
Okay, faction tower.

1531
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,820
Yeah, 20 points per team.

1532
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:42,840
And then, like, one is 20, two is 60, three is 150, four is 250, and five is 350.

1533
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,480
I need one palladium fragment if anybody's got one.

1534
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:45,940
I got one.

1535
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,800
Okay, let's see.

1536
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,520
I'm in base.

1537
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,740
Okay, just drop it in a box.

1538
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,200
You must defeat a boss where all team members use a fox spark with a weapon.

1539
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,840
Last hit with a fox spark using a unique skill.

1540
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,840
Oh, we have to do a thing where we all have fox sparks.

1541
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,900
Alright, I'm gonna build the...

1542
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,280
Is that a global event or a day one event?

1543
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:06,760
It's a global.

1544
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,160
Yeah, so we can do that, like, whenever.

1545
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,080
On day two, yeah.

1546
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,140
We had to catch five lamb bell at the same time using traps.

1547
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,040
How the fuck?

1548
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,300
I guess we all just...

1549
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:18,500
I don't know.

1550
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,040
Someone that knows how traps works can do that.

1551
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,760
When do we unlock traps?

1552
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,720
What level is that?

1553
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,520
We already unlocked it.

1554
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,040
Then I guess we have to build that at the starting area.

1555
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,240
How

1556
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,040
the fuck?

1557
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,980
Everything is so dark.

1558
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,920
You pathetic fox.

1559
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:36,880
Work harder.

1560
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,040
Yeah, tell him.

1561
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,040
Yeah, tell him.

1562
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,640
Build that dictatorship to podium.

1563
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,680
Grab some more palladium fragments.

1564
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,140
More balls later.

1565
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,920
I need 20 palladium fragments.

1566
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,180
To do the next two things I gotta build.

1567
00:55:59,240 --> 00:55:59,320
Oh, okay.

1568
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,020
I can grab some now.

1569
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,660
Just put 40 in the box.

1570
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,300
We need 11.

1571
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:02,880
Oh, okay.

1572
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,160
Cool.

1573
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:03,500
Then we're good.

1574
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,040
We're good then.

1575
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,660
Oh, wait.

1576
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,520
Let me repair my shit.

1577
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,360
Nice.

1578
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,010
I don't see a tombat anywhere.

1579
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:14,990
I saw a daydream.

1580
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,490
It spawns near the second waypoint.

1581
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:17,430
Near the Mammoth Forest.

1582
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:18,450
Oh, okay.

1583
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,110
Alright, I guess I'll go back then.

1584
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:23,270
Oh, no.

1585
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:23,710
No.

1586
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,210
It's daytime now.

1587
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:27,990
Oh, yeah.

1588
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:28,230
Right.

1589
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:29,670
Let's see time.

1590
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,550
We have a repair bench?

1591
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:33,450
Yeah, it's at base.

1592
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:34,050
Yep.

1593
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,230
Am I blind?

1594
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,470
Maybe.

1595
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:40,450
I guess so.

1596
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:40,950
What the fuck?

1597
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:42,550
It's okay.

1598
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,450
We all have one blind spot.

1599
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,350
I don't.

1600
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:47,270
I am the blind spot.

1601
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,430
Oh, yeah.

1602
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:47,690
Sorry.

1603
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:48,210
You're perfect.

1604
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:49,770
I'm perfect.

1605
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:50,590
I can't fucking see.

1606
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:53,890
I'm pretty sure your chat can figure out something that you're not perfect in.

1607
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:54,130
Oh, yeah.

1608
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:54,530
For sure.

1609
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,350
They're gonna say everything.

1610
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,050
You think your chat's lying?

1611
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:00,510
Yes.

1612
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,750
Why would you say your chat's lying?

1613
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:03,990
They know everything about you.

1614
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,350
They only want to see me in pain.

1615
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,130
And you're not cultivating a good chat.

1616
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:11,590
Listen, it's not like a YouTuber chat where everyone's super nice and will die for you, okay?

1617
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,670
Is that true, chat?

1618
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:13,470
Is that true?

1619
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:14,070
What?

1620
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,090
What kind of chat did you cultivate?

1621
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:24,470
I cultivated a base chat who's not afraid to say their opinion.

1622
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:24,710
Oh.

1623
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:24,870
No.

1624
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,050
Wait, then their opinion is true then.

1625
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,650
Unless you're trying to say...

1626
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,910
Are you gonna take that, chat?

1627
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,090
That's what they are.

1628
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:34,730
Their opinions.

1629
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:35,970
They're opinions.

1630
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,030
They're opinions.

1631
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,310
Not all...

1632
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,510
But are you trying to say every opinion your chat has is wrong then?

1633
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:47,010
No, I'm saying every opinion is an opinion, Doki Bird.

1634
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,850
Yeah, yeah.

1635
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:48,890
So are you trying...

1636
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,910
Do you know what an opinion is, Doki Bird?

1637
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,250
Yeah, but then...

1638
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,670
It could be right or wrong.

1639
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,690
So you're trying to say...

1640
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:55,830
that their opinion is wrong.

1641
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:59,630
If it doesn't agree with me, then I permabanned them.

1642
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,070
So you're censoring them?

1643
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:04,230
Yeah.

1644
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,110
Whoa!

1645
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,130
That sounds like...

1646
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:07,930
I run a dictatorship out here.

1647
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,050
That is a PAL World gamer right there.

1648
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,170
The truth will eventually come out.

1649
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,870
What truth?

1650
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,890
Surefour chatters.

1651
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,470
You come here to say your truth.

1652
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:23,740
Speak your truth.

1653
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,660
Say your truth here.

1654
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,600
This is a safe space from Surefour.

1655
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,960
My place is a safe space.

1656
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,520
You literally said you censored people.

1657
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:33,500
Rarely.

1658
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,660
It's just the option is there.

1659
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,740
That's the auto mod.

1660
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,500
I didn't do that.

1661
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,180
You have to establish dominance every now and then.

1662
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,920
Someone in my chat was like, he was mean to me.

1663
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:44,420
Good.

1664
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,340
Run.

1665
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,700
Hey, there's the city.

1666
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,180
There's the town.

1667
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,880
Get over here, Life Monk.

1668
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,540
Oh my god.

1669
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:54,640
He's a monster.

1670
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,520
He's running so fast.

1671
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,420
Okay.

1672
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,200
Get over here.

1673
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,820
Stone pit logging site.

1674
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,100
Yes!

1675
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,580
We're finally at the stone pit logging site!

1676
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,400
Alright, cool.

1677
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,880
Am I high enough level?

1678
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:08,900
That's a question.

1679
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,640
Foxpark, please.

1680
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,640
Shoot him.

1681
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,280
I don't want to chase this lift monk for like 20 years!

1682
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,600
Please!

1683
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,570
Do you think I can put the logging site on top of a tree?

1684
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,710
Or is that an exploit?

1685
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:31,070
Cool.

1686
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,450
You can try it out.

1687
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,010
Ask for forgiveness, not permission.

1688
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,870
That usually goes.

1689
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,030
I never told that Natsu.

1690
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,070
Oh, sick rocks.

1691
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:42,550
That's true.

1692
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:44,130
Please.

1693
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:49,230
I've been trying to kill this lift monk for like five minutes now.

1694
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:50,890
He's always running.

1695
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:52,850
Look at this.

1696
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:53,350
I'm too lazy.

1697
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:57,990
Yay!

1698
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,560
Okay, we need to be level 24.

1699
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,260
Somebody needs to be level 24 for us to get base level 12.

1700
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,540
That's the last recipe is at level 24.

1701
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,780
I'm working on it.

1702
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:12,800
24, okay.

1703
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,840
What level are you at right now?

1704
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,260
Once we get to that point, all we need to do is do material management to get it to level 12.

1705
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:20,860
Alright.

1706
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,120
But we probably need to catch more stuff.

1707
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,300
I'm working on it.

1708
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,500
What level are you right now?

1709
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,340
We're almost there.

1710
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,140
I'm 10, I think.

1711
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:35,600
Close, close.

1712
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,500
I'm 13.

1713
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,880
I'm 11, sorry.

1714
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,520
Yeah, let's go Lily!

1715
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:43,460
We're here!

1716
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,180
Let's go!

1717
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,660
We're doing our part!

1718
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,440
It took me like five minutes to catch one lift monk, but I'm doing my part.

1719
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,360
We're getting it.

1720
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,120
Okay, let me build a ranch.

1721
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,660
Because then we don't have to make pow balls anymore.

1722
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:02,620
Yay!

1723
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,200
But how much do those actually make the balls?

1724
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,840
When it's split between four, not great.

1725
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,520
But I can make two ranches.

1726
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,280
If I get enough wood and stone.

1727
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,460
Ram ranch.

1728
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,220
What do we need the most right now?

1729
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,860
Right now, we need both wood and stone.

1730
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:23,400
Oh, okay.

1731
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,560
I'll just do wood right now.

1732
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,120
Rock and stone.

1733
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,260
Might as well just cut some wood.

1734
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,340
Pitch tree.

1735
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,140
Punch tree.

1736
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,180
Do any of my boards do...

1737
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,240
Okay, we're okay.

1738
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,540
What do you do?

1739
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,340
You do mining.

1740
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,500
Mining away.

1741
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:41,400
Okay.

1742
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,040
I don't know what's left to mine, I mine in anyways.

1743
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,340
Oh my god, I can do Minecraft plot covers now.

1744
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,160
We only need level 20.

1745
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:51,500
Oh nice.

1746
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,900
Fuck these trees.

1747
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,100
Alright, I'm gonna go level 20.

1748
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:56,760
I'm gonna level up a little bit.

1749
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,980
Oh shit, I'm two.

1750
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,580
I'm slowly walking over.

1751
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,880
Mining diamonds.

1752
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,460
Don't worry.

1753
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,600
I'm worrying.

1754
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,860
I'll be the lumberjack of the team.

1755
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,200
I just really enjoy walking around punching pallets.

1756
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,280
Wait, did you not make a weapon?

1757
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,940
I do have a weapon.

1758
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,460
Oh, your fist.

1759
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,920
My fist is made out of steel.

1760
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,420
I got two.

1761
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,940
Arkas are surprisingly very strong.

1762
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,420
What the heck?

1763
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,120
Why are my fists too slow?

1764
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,160
I just wanna beat up this green squirrel.

1765
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,900
Yeah, that was me too.

1766
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,700
I gave up halfway.

1767
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,300
That's alright, the back bonus is surprisingly effective.

1768
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,720
You're gonna bane him?

1769
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,320
What?

1770
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,700
You're gonna bane the squirrel?

1771
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,540
Yeah, I bained him.

1772
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,320
Damn, that's fucked up.

1773
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,880
I had to do it to him.

1774
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,420
Why were they running?

1775
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,200
So they... die?

1776
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,820
What the fuck?

1777
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,520
They just die in snow and that's kinda judgmental.

1778
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,000
That's kinda judgmental.

1779
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,260
They don't know anything about me.

1780
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,080
I can be really nice.

1781
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,780
You're trying to beat up a squirrel.

1782
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,200
Does that sound like a nice person?

1783
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:22,600
I'm the nicest person here.

1784
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,740
You are not the nicest person here.

1785
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,080
There's some dudes down here.

1786
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,800
Maybe my hands just wanna talk, man.

1787
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,860
I'm gonna catch these guys.

1788
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,400
I'm mining.

1789
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,260
I'm mining.

1790
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:37,740
Alright.

1791
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,980
How many people do we already have?

1792
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,300
What do you mean?

1793
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,840
We have one people.

1794
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,620
One people?

1795
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,260
Hopefully we're about to have more people.

1796
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:48,600
Yeah.

1797
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,340
I will catch people too.

1798
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,060
Alright, we got another person.

1799
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,400
We got another one?

1800
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,860
Yeah, let's catch another one right now.

1801
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:57,540
Nice.

1802
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,400
We're doing our part, Lily.

1803
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,580
I don't get a gun.

1804
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,280
People catching!

1805
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:05,140
Woo!

1806
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,860
This is what we wanted, Nintendo!

1807
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,320
This is what we wanted!

1808
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,160
I wanna catch Professor Oak.

1809
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,620
Yeah, but Nintendo will never do anything because they're too big.

1810
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,640
I feel like Nintendo's main revenue is just merchandising at this point.

1811
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,020
It's not even Game Dev.

1812
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,460
I got the police after me!

1813
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,000
It's okay, let me just get this person.

1814
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,240
I just want this person.

1815
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,620
I punched him into a rock and now I can't get him anymore.

1816
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,380
And I can't.

1817
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:33,900
No!

1818
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:34,820
Kill him!

1819
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,700
What do I do?

1820
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,200
What the fuck?

1821
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,060
Well, there goes my only Powerball.

1822
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,740
Anyway, there's a guy down here in the rock.

1823
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,560
If anybody has a Powerball and wanna catch him, I'm right here.

1824
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,500
Wait, where is he?

1825
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,860
Right down this hill.

1826
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,620
I'm out of balls.

1827
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,120
I got him out of the rock though.

1828
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,260
And he's ready to catch.

1829
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,520
Okay, I'm trying to find...

1830
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:58,940
Oh, I see you.

1831
01:04:59,060 --> 01:04:59,700
I'm heading over.

1832
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:02,960
Don't worry.

1833
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,040
Help me!

1834
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,560
I'm coming over.

1835
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,560
Five nails.

1836
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,280
My knight in shining armor, where are you?

1837
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,300
Coming over.

1838
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,300
Don't worry.

1839
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,100
I went the wrong way.

1840
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,720
Don't worry.

1841
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,100
I'm coming over for real now.

1842
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,280
I'm coming over for real now.

1843
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:27,960
Is he still there?

1844
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,040
Is he still there?

1845
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,840
Yeah, he's still shooting at me.

1846
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,240
Oh boy.

1847
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:32,980
Just live.

1848
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,280
Oh boy.

1849
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,440
Help!

1850
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:37,980
Don't worry.

1851
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,660
Wait, where in the world are you?

1852
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,020
Did I go the wrong way?

1853
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,020
I don't even see your name on the map anymore.

1854
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:43,840
Don't worry.

1855
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,040
I'm going the right way.

1856
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,660
For real this time.

1857
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:47,560
Oh, okay.

1858
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:47,900
I see.

1859
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,260
I see.

1860
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:49,580
I think.

1861
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:50,800
I'm here.

1862
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:51,360
Don't worry!

1863
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:51,860
Yeah, you're coming.

1864
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:52,160
You're coming.

1865
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:52,680
Help me!

1866
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,420
I'm right here!

1867
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,220
Hello!

1868
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,700
I feel like Boar is gonna fucking kill him before I catch him.

1869
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:58,700
Okay.

1870
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,880
Alright, you have to hit him in the head because he doesn't technically have a hitbox.

1871
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:02,220
There you go.

1872
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:02,420
Okay.

1873
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,760
Oh my god, look at this one pistol.

1874
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,640
You should be able to get him though.

1875
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,140
Yeah, I got him.

1876
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:06,360
No!

1877
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:07,140
Oh fuck.

1878
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,800
I got him out.

1879
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:09,520
I got him out though.

1880
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:11,680
Come on.

1881
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,240
Get over here.

1882
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,900
I have five more.

1883
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,260
Oh wait, that's your boar.

1884
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,380
That's my boar, yeah.

1885
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,520
I have five more.

1886
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:20,680
I was trying to kill it.

1887
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:24,020
You six?

1888
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,360
Oh!

1889
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,120
Oh, I got it!

1890
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,980
We got syndicate thugs.

1891
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,080
I'm gonna put some dudes in here.

1892
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,020
Alright.

1893
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,920
We're doing it.

1894
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,280
We're doing it.

1895
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:44,380
I'm gonna put my human in the pal box.

1896
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,720
Oh wait, he's already in here.

1897
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,900
I'm being assaulted by three officers for assaulting a person.

1898
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:52,980
Oh shit.

1899
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:54,260
That's a...

1900
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,520
It's like assaulting people is a bad thing, Lily.

1901
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,800
I hope you...

1902
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,540
I just wanted to catch them.

1903
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:00,940
Wow.

1904
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,060
Give them a nice little home.

1905
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:06,380
No big deal.

1906
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,120
But they already have a home.

1907
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:08,720
What do you mean?

1908
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,960
But I can make a homey a home.

1909
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,600
But their family is in their original home.

1910
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,000
I'm the family now.

1911
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,700
Are you trying to say your buddy now?

1912
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,220
Oh, whoa!

1913
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,200
Whoa.

1914
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,260
This hole was made for me.

1915
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,920
We're sorry.

1916
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,360
Wow.

1917
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,140
Don't talk too... never mind.

1918
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,040
I'm not gonna make that joke.

1919
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:32,880
Go on.

1920
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,860
No, say it with your chest.

1921
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:37,640
It's okay.

1922
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,080
It's okay.

1923
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,600
Don't go for European, Lily!

1924
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,040
Don't go for European!

1925
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,560
It's on European!

1926
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,600
Well, you were gonna go that route, huh?

1927
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,380
Wait, what happened on the rock?

1928
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:51,820
Never mind.

1929
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,140
Never mind.

1930
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,200
This is ending Twitch Rivals!

1931
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,000
We can't get away with this!

1932
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:04,800
Alright, do we now... do we have enough for the stone pit?

1933
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,100
Alright, I'm putting out the stone pit.

1934
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,320
Alright, nice.

1935
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:11,800
Alright.

1936
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,020
Alright.

1937
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,140
I should've built the ranch first.

1938
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,220
Wait, what do I need for the ranch?

1939
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:16,660
Don't worry.

1940
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,840
Alright, don't worry.

1941
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:20,640
I have a lot of stone.

1942
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:21,740
I'm coming over.

1943
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,000
Maybe dying is like...

1944
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yeah, I'm going to put it in the box.

1945
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:34,230
You got any fire Pokémon in the Paldex?

1946
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:35,830
We've got one.

1947
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,590
I got only the Fox Sparks.

1948
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:39,930
What the...

1949
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,450
I put the stone in.

1950
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:44,810
Rock and stone.

1951
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,410
Rock and stone.

1952
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:50,890
Okay, do we need more stones?

1953
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,090
No, I think we're good.

1954
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:53,870
I'm going to build the first ranch.

1955
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,450
Nice.

1956
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,630
I noticed in making Nubis, it's like that...

1957
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,090
green...

1958
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:03,850
panda and...

1959
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,690
female bee.

1960
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:06,510
Oh!

1961
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,430
Nice.

1962
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,570
That's how you breed them.

1963
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:11,090
The...

1964
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,750
Vespa Queen, but like...

1965
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,230
Palworld.

1966
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,910
But the Palworld...

1967
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:20,810
version of it.

1968
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,540
Oh no.

1969
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,400
No fucking pickaxe.

1970
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,700
I like seeing the little syndicate guy also swinging...

1971
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,220
a hammer here.

1972
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,340
It's actually kind of endearing.

1973
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,940
He's doing his part.

1974
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,300
Our little teammate.

1975
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:40,760
He's a great asset.

1976
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:42,800
Great asset?

1977
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,680
Great, great asset?

1978
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,180
Great asset.

1979
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,500
What the hell name is that?

1980
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,400
It says, are you guys making a...

1981
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,320
Oh, you're making a crossbow.

1982
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:50,640
Nice.

1983
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,380
I'm making a crossbow.

1984
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:52,620
Oh, nice!

1985
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,400
Where's the repair bench?

1986
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,600
I'm gonna go murder things.

1987
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,360
Oh, I think I put...

1988
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,700
Did I... Did I just assemble the repair...

1989
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,320
Why is there like four benches?

1990
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,120
We have like four benches.

1991
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,520
We can be instructors.

1992
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,800
So we can work on multiple projects.

1993
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,060
We have five.

1994
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:07,700
Okay, I should know...

1995
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,940
We should make... We should replace them with the high quality benches...

1996
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,500
when we can though, cause they make stuff faster.

1997
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,600
We got a high quality right here.

1998
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,920
I'm gonna put a repair bench right here.

1999
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,240
Now we have...

2000
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,780
I don't know if we do have a repair bench, but here is one too.

2001
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,160
Nice.

2002
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,060
Why is she so tanky?

2003
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,160
I'm gonna go...

2004
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,800
I'm gonna go catch some pals.

2005
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,500
Alright, let me put...

2006
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:34,860
Ow!

2007
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,340
Ow!

2008
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:36,420
Where's Vixie?

2009
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,940
That's our first mounted pal.

2010
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,200
Uh...

2011
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,620
Direwolf is pretty good.

2012
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,240
You can also... You have to find Chillit anyway.

2013
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,620
So you can just do Chillit if you want.

2014
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,620
I'm gonna try to find it.

2015
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,340
I think it's Rushboard.

2016
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,260
Yeah, Rushboard is the first one.

2017
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,000
I'm trying to remember where the Direwolf was.

2018
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,720
How do I get the Direwolf?

2019
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,720
It's near the bridge.

2020
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,380
There's like a bridge near a waypoint.

2021
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,080
Where is Direwolf?

2022
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,740
God help me.

2023
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,360
Google is not an exploit.

2024
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,600
That's all I'm gonna say.

2025
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,360
Google is not an exploit.

2026
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,840
Alright, so...

2027
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,680
So let's find which...

2028
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,560
What?

2029
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,320
Whoa!

2030
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,680
Who the fuck is that?

2031
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,160
I don't know.

2032
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,180
That's the word I've been saying for a long time.

2033
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,300
It's like a forgotten memory.

2034
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,280
Alright, let's see it.

2035
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,720
Wait, why can't I use this red... Oh, there we go.

2036
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:41,620
Don't wanna find... Okay, it is in the abandoned mineshaft.

2037
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,740
Don't wanna find...

2038
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:42,740
Okay, it is in the abandoned mineshaft.

2039
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:43,800
Okay...

2040
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,080
Where am I?

2041
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,080
First off, where am I though?

2042
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,440
First off, where am I though?

2043
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,640
Okay, this way.

2044
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,040
Okay, this way.

2045
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,800
No, I shouldn't make the max.

2046
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:57,240
No, I shouldn't make the max.

2047
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,840
Oh shit.

2048
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,060
I think this is the way.

2049
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,320
I only made three arrows.

2050
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,060
Okay.

2051
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,460
Wait, how many balls do I have?

2052
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,000
I did not double check that.

2053
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:11,760
Yeah, you always gotta check your balls before you go out.

2054
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,650
Yeah, you always gotta check your balls before you go out.

2055
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:16,010
No comment.

2056
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,230
I want you to live with that.

2057
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:19,870
Wouldn't you agree?

2058
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:22,410
I want you to think about what you just said.

2059
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:23,690
But I agree.

2060
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:25,030
I think he's not really my strong suit.

2061
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,330
It's all good.

2062
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:25,750
I don't agree.

2063
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:30,130
Dang.

2064
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,930
You gotta check your boss and make sure you don't have cancer.

2065
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,910
No, that's for breasts, right?

2066
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:40,690
No, I think you can get...

2067
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,810
...testicular cancer.

2068
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,530
Yeah, you have to do that for...

2069
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,130
...testicular cancer too.

2070
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:46,250
Yeah.

2071
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,990
So you would say you have fondles.

2072
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:51,590
Yeah, chat, you should fondle...

2073
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,990
Chat, make sure you don't have lumps.

2074
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:53,970
...testicular cancer right now.

2075
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,930
Real quick, real quick.

2076
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:59,530
Stop telling your VTuber chats to fondle their balls.

2077
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:04,650
You know half of them have lived for a statement like that.

2078
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:04,910
You know half of them have lived for a statement like that.

2079
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,770
I'm not sure if you're a VTuber.

2080
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,010
TRIPPER, did you check your balls today?

2081
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:10,770
Yeah, did you?

2082
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:13,170
I'm being harassed right now.

2083
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,730
We're not the ones checking.

2084
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:18,350
We're asking if you've checked yourself.

2085
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:19,650
Yeah.

2086
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,190
It's one of the global achievements, I think.

2087
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:24,710
I'm not gonna talk about my balls.

2088
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:28,990
We're just concerned about your health.

2089
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:30,330
Cap.

2090
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:31,610
Wow.

2091
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,970
We're just here trying to be a good friend.

2092
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,370
We don't have the sticular cancer.

2093
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:38,770
Listen, reverse the rules.

2094
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:47,630
Alright, all the women in chat, have you guys checked your breasts to make sure you don't have breast cancer?

2095
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,270
Just make sure.

2096
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:50,850
We want you to be safe.

2097
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,070
Give a little swipe of the mammaries.

2098
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:56,670
Alright, pressure's built.

2099
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,870
I think that means we're going to the next base level.

2100
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,730
Alright, nice.

2101
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:01,110
Seven.

2102
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,030
Alright, hot spring.

2103
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,490
Oh shit, I know my balls!

2104
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,430
My balls!

2105
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,850
Don't worry, my chickpea's here.

2106
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:14,810
I'm not worried anymore.

2107
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:17,690
No, my little chicken!

2108
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:23,090
I need a wooden stone, but we need to assign people to the actual mine.

2109
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:26,450
Right now we have this shitty little green chipmunk doing all of the...

2110
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:28,110
All of the woodwork.

2111
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:28,930
What do we need for it?

2112
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:33,110
We need that blue and purple elk guy.

2113
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,970
Elk whatever his name is.

2114
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,270
And we need a tombat.

2115
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:40,390
But if we can't get a tombat, that's fine, but...

2116
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,490
We just need to wait until nighttime right now.

2117
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,010
Yeah.

2118
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:46,170
It's not nighttime so we can't do anything.

2119
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:46,550
But the elk would be good.

2120
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:47,950
Elk should be out right now.

2121
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:49,810
If you see one.

2122
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:51,750
Still trying to figure out where the direwolf is.

2123
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:53,730
They're on me.

2124
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:54,550
They're on you?

2125
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:55,230
Where are you?

2126
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:56,190
Oh my god, you're so far away.

2127
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:56,670
I'm heading over.

2128
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,870
I think I need to go...

2129
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:05,170
Level.

2130
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:06,590
Whoa!

2131
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:07,910
Not the poor sheep!

2132
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,090
It's taking so long!

2133
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:13,310
I wanna build a second ranch.

2134
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:17,570
Wait, maybe I can catch this person.

2135
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:20,070
I should get a glider.

2136
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:24,870
Oh!

2137
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:25,930
We got another human!

2138
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,470
Nice!

2139
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,470
We have three humans now!

2140
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:29,570
Nice!

2141
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:31,450
More human.

2142
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:32,790
More work.

2143
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:37,690
Something you doing?

2144
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:39,810
What are you sure for?

2145
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:39,830
Zog's done.

2146
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,430
Zog Zog.

2147
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,270
Oh!

2148
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:46,650
I know where the...

2149
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:49,150
There's a shiny lamb bell!

2150
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:51,330
Let's get it!

2151
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:53,370
Don't we get points for shiny?

2152
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:55,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do!

2153
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,590
Tiebreaker is shinies I think.

2154
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,130
We get extra points as well.

2155
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:04,730
So much more damage.

2156
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:08,310
Please chickpea do not kill him!

2157
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:12,690
Make it so they're not aggressive.

2158
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:13,750
Hold four.

2159
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:15,170
Hold four?

2160
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:16,630
It's fine, we're fine.

2161
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,850
It's okay.

2162
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:19,690
I'm beating him up right now.

2163
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,310
I'm beating him up now.

2164
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:23,350
I'm beating him up now.

2165
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:28,330
Make sure I don't accidentally kill him myself.

2166
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:29,390
Make sure I don't accidentally kill him myself.

2167
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:33,050
I think it's faster to die and just try again.

2168
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:33,630
What the fuck?

2169
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,190
Oh I got it!

2170
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:35,830
I got it!

2171
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:36,150
Nice!

2172
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:37,830
Clip it!

2173
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:38,230
Clip it!

2174
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:40,530
Do I have VOD history on?

2175
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:41,490
Clip it chat!

2176
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:43,830
Clip it bro!

2177
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:47,450
Guys, I haven't been on this Twitch in a long time.

2178
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,950
Do I even have VOD history on?

2179
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,570
I actually didn't chat!

2180
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:51,450
Oh no!

2181
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:56,310
That's against the rules.

2182
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,410
I have an excuse!

2183
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:00,910
I have an excuse though!

2184
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,430
You have no excuse.

2185
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,230
I have this note from my doctor.

2186
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:06,630
I do!

2187
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:07,470
It's okay!

2188
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:08,850
I might die though.

2189
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:09,730
I do though.

2190
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:10,190
I do.

2191
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:11,250
It's fine.

2192
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:13,290
Save!

2193
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:17,450
Save!

2194
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:21,330
Has anybody gone to the chili yet?

2195
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:23,130
No, clips are not on.

2196
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:29,650
Guys, remember to go back to my VOD and clip it when I turn it back on!

2197
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:30,410
Wait, no!

2198
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:32,770
If you don't have it on, you won't have a VOD!

2199
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,010
Oh wait, clips are on!

2200
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,910
Don't worry, people were fucking around.

2201
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,230
It's okay, clips are on.

2202
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:40,010
Alright.

2203
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:41,990
You're trying to sabotage us.

2204
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:43,090
Oh, oh, oh!

2205
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:44,670
Do you guys see?

2206
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:47,630
There's an outpost over here with the thugs.

2207
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,410
They've got those Elks over there.

2208
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:51,070
Oh, okay, nice.

2209
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:52,970
There's so many direwolves here.

2210
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:56,310
Yeah, we should probably go get those Elks.

2211
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,070
I have no health because I have no food.

2212
01:17:58,330 --> 01:17:58,770
But...

2213
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:01,570
Maybe I'll find some food.

2214
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,270
If I die, that's probably better.

2215
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:04,790
So it's fine.

2216
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,010
If I die, I die.

2217
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,650
If you die, just respawn for a head.

2218
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:10,110
Oh wait, did I just die?

2219
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:11,930
Uh, hmm...

2220
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:13,730
Maybe.

2221
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:14,270
Woo!

2222
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:17,790
Nice.

2223
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:19,190
I got direwolf!

2224
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:19,950
Wait, am I dead?

2225
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,510
What level is direwolf?

2226
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,830
Oh, I think I died.

2227
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:24,890
Alright, I'm gonna give up.

2228
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,890
Oh wait, I like, I fell into the water and for some reason...

2229
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,130
Oh, I must have taken fall damage!

2230
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:31,690
Oh, okay.

2231
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:34,730
What level is the direwolf mount?

2232
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:36,690
I don't remember.

2233
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:38,010
15?

2234
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:41,010
Oh, okay, I haven't enough minerals.

2235
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:44,330
Let's see.

2236
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:45,630
Where is it?

2237
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:46,610
Oh, there it is!

2238
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,210
Okay, nine.

2239
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:48,490
Yeah, I can afford it now.

2240
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,410
Oh no, please don't kill me.

2241
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:51,010
Elks spotted.

2242
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:51,950
Getting help.

2243
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,810
Nice, thank you.

2244
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:56,730
There's like a couple at that outpost as well.

2245
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,570
There's a direwolf that wanna fucking kill me.

2246
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,400
God, he's so fast!

2247
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,300
Hit him enough so he'll hit back.

2248
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,740
Come here, boy!

2249
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,580
As long as you don't hit first, you didn't start the fight.

2250
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,560
You can finish it though.

2251
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:18,820
Yes!

2252
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:19,960
Okay, there's a...

2253
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,160
Oh, nice, there's my stuff.

2254
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,380
Oh, I see you, surefour.

2255
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:23,980
Hey.

2256
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,320
Oh.

2257
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:29,860
Ow.

2258
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,180
You catching it?

2259
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,160
That'd be spam-catching shit.

2260
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:36,940
I'm trying.

2261
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,480
I'm trying, Beth.

2262
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,440
Where the fuck is the...

2263
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:45,060
Oh my god, I'm fucking...

2264
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,240
dying.

2265
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,240
Holy shit.

2266
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,180
How the hell do I get over there?

2267
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,860
We got the elk.

2268
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:53,240
Oh wait, I'm gonna go.

2269
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:53,560
I don't know.

2270
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:53,740
Okay.

2271
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:54,820
I need to get home.

2272
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,100
I'm so fucked right now.

2273
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,380
I have 99 HP.

2274
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,040
I need to get home.

2275
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,040
I'm so fucked right now.

2276
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,040
I have 99 HP.

2277
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:01,660
I'm so fucked right now.

2278
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:01,660
I have 99 HP.

2279
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:01,660
Alright.

2280
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,200
Back to the base I go.

2281
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,500
Alright.

2282
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:04,500
Back to the base I go.

2283
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,700
Deploying Elkin base.

2284
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,360
I'll be there soon.

2285
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:07,840
Deploying Elkin base.

2286
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:07,840
I'll be there soon.

2287
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:10,500
Alright.

2288
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,780
Putting all my resources.

2289
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,560
Oh, I'm gonna drown again.

2290
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,900
Why am I like this?

2291
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,980
Our pals are... our pals...

2292
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:21,860
They're stressed out!

2293
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,420
Oh no, they're so depressed.

2294
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,860
Oh no, join the club, bro.

2295
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:26,020
Someone do something!

2296
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:26,120
Oh no, join the club, bro.

2297
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:26,200
Someone do something!

2298
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,520
I'm gonna drown again!

2299
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:32,920
Okay, I need... leather, wood, fiber...

2300
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:33,780
I think I should have enough.

2301
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:34,220
I think I should have enough.

2302
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,400
Where the fuck is the...

2303
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,540
Why have I tried this twice?

2304
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,660
This is...

2305
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,120
Yay!

2306
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,920
I have a level 14 chicken!

2307
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,400
Nice-o!

2308
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,640
Help me, handyman.

2309
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,580
It's about nighttime too, so we can try to get...

2310
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:53,320
Okay, it's Tomabat again.

2311
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,760
Yeah, Tomabat again.

2312
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:57,840
Fuck!

2313
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,540
Yay!

2314
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:06,800
Nice.

2315
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:07,440
Acquired.

2316
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:08,060
Oh yeah, I'm...

2317
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,560
Let's see...

2318
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,680
I wanted more balls.

2319
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,660
Nice!

2320
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,320
Nice.

2321
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,740
There's arrows being...

2322
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,700
crafted somewhere.

2323
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,540
Okay, I'm gonna...

2324
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,160
Do a little leveling.

2325
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,110
Need more balls.

2326
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:28,760
What do I need?

2327
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,840
Let's see...

2328
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,600
Where am I missing?

2329
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:32,180
Wood.

2330
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:32,620
Okay.

2331
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:33,700
When do I get it?

2332
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:35,780
I can't see.

2333
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:37,400
Fox!

2334
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:38,640
Give me the light!

2335
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,740
I'm like AD-ing out of habit.

2336
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:50,020
Like FPS-ing.

2337
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,700
AD-ing?

2338
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,040
AD.

2339
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,680
AD, AD, AD, AD, AD.

2340
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,000
I can't stand still when I'm...

2341
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,580
Can you sidestep, bro?

2342
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,300
Yeah.

2343
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,940
I can't stand still while I'm fucking chopping a tree.

2344
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,100
What does AD stand for?

2345
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,340
A-N-D?

2346
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,220
Like you're A-N-D on your keyboard?

2347
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,940
Really?

2348
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:07,080
A-N-D?

2349
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,280
What do the letters A-D stand for?

2350
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:13,720
What do the letters A-D stand for?

2351
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,000
Oh yeah, cause it's...

2352
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,220
That's why.

2353
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,060
Cause like in Fortnite, I...

2354
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:18,960
Fortnite.

2355
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,440
Yeah, yeah, give me credit.

2356
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,920
No, don't.

2357
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:25,560
Let's see... It's night time!

2358
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:26,800
You're a Fortnite-er?

2359
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,160
Bro, I spend...

2360
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:32,540
I spend like at least $500 on Fortnite skins and I'm not proud of it.

2361
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:35,620
Man, Fortnite's really fun though.

2362
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:37,420
It's near the...

2363
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,540
Combat should be near the Mamoswine, right?

2364
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:40,940
Yes.

2365
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:41,540
Okay.

2366
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,500
I'll see if I can find them.

2367
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:46,400
Yeah, Mamoswine Forest.

2368
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:48,020
Oh, I see!

2369
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:48,680
I found the combat!

2370
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:49,580
I need mana rest.

2371
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,000
Let's go!

2372
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,360
Get over here.

2373
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:52,900
Get your ass over here.

2374
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,420
Get over here, I'm gonna fucking catch you.

2375
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:57,820
Whoa.

2376
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,540
It's self-defense cause he shot first.

2377
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,400
Yeah, tell your lawyer.

2378
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,000
You saw it chat!

2379
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:08,060
He shot first, guys!

2380
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,780
Oh my god, I actually might die.

2381
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,300
I'm fucking around way too much.

2382
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,100
Do you have anything for these diaries?

2383
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:15,720
Oh no, oh no.

2384
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,240
I don't think so.

2385
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:18,780
Okay.

2386
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:22,900
Ummm...

2387
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:28,440
Is the Limb Mug achievement, is that a global one or is that just a day one?

2388
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,580
It's a global, I'm pretty sure.

2389
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,760
Yeah, yeah, it's a global.

2390
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:32,540
Cool, cool.

2391
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,000
All the day one achievements are like very...

2392
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,420
Just mostly catching the bosses.

2393
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:38,580
Okay.

2394
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,900
Except for the bases and the...

2395
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,100
Woo!

2396
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,160
I have two tombats.

2397
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:46,760
Nice!

2398
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,580
Who do we replace then for the tombats?

2399
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:52,800
Ummm...

2400
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:54,980
Well, we actually...

2401
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,660
We should be able to build the next thing.

2402
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,480
Sorry, I'm not at base right now, but we should be able to build the next thing now.

2403
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,880
Which I think is another berry thing.

2404
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,180
We were out of resources last time.

2405
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:05,300
But we should be able to do a base upgrade and then you can just throw them in.

2406
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,360
Alright, what's the...

2407
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,240
What do we need for the berry?

2408
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,600
Give me one second, I'm almost back at base.

2409
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,500
I got the tombat.

2410
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,440
I'm heading over to base.

2411
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,000
Alright, sounds good.

2412
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,280
I'm getting some Wok.

2413
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:20,540
Shrek.

2414
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,020
Metal.

2415
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:25,940
Seeds and wood.

2416
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,660
We have a lot of seeds.

2417
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,120
So I think that should be fine.

2418
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:29,540
Alright, I'm back in.

2419
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,160
Seed, fiber and wood.

2420
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,440
Give me the light.

2421
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,780
Let me just double check and see what we need.

2422
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:37,680
Ummm...

2423
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:42,000
Next base upgrade we need one more berry plantation and hot springs.

2424
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:42,720
Okay.

2425
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:43,620
I got you a lot of wood.

2426
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,840
I can build the hot springs right now.

2427
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,760
I can put some wood for you.

2428
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,200
Thank you!

2429
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,100
Thank you!

2430
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:56,380
And then...

2431
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:57,840
Alright.

2432
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,860
Yeah, we have like 268 wood.

2433
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,240
Oh, I have like ancient civilization parts.

2434
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:03,180
I have six.

2435
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,340
How do I get six?

2436
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,100
I think we're gonna need that for the next upgrade.

2437
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:08,980
What the fuck did I grab?

2438
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,900
We don't need scopefrogs, do we?

2439
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,200
What did I do?

2440
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,560
We need five stone.

2441
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,060
Oh, five stone?

2442
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:15,580
Easy.

2443
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,160
No.

2444
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,280
Don't need it.

2445
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:26,670
Oh!

2446
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:31,230
When I caught the shiny lamb bell, I got ancient civilization parts.

2447
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:31,530
Oh no!

2448
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:32,050
That makes sense.

2449
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:34,390
I didn't notice that.

2450
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:36,890
Alright, I put the five stone in.

2451
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:38,310
We can do a dungeon run too.

2452
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:40,190
There's a dungeon right by the entrance of our base.

2453
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,870
Do the dungeon bosses count towards anything?

2454
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:44,490
Uh uh, no.

2455
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,450
Well, doing the dungeon counts.

2456
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:46,910
There's only alphas in there.

2457
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:53,090
We need to do the ravine grotto dungeon and then the mountain stream grotto dungeon.

2458
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:54,310
We need to do the ravine grotto dungeon and then the mountain stream grotto dungeon.

2459
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:55,530
As a team, by the way.

2460
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:59,770
So if you find the ravine grotto dungeon, that's what we have to do.

2461
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:02,570
Okay.

2462
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:04,370
I'm not sure where that one is, but...

2463
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:05,230
Alright.

2464
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:06,030
Hey, Google.

2465
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:07,750
Where's the ravine grotto dungeon?

2466
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:12,850
It's not an X1 if it's on the internet!

2467
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:14,190
It's not an X1 if it's on the internet!

2468
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:14,210
Base level 8.

2469
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:17,510
It is... wait, it's near us.

2470
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:18,750
Base 8.

2471
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:21,730
Uh, we need a medieval workbench and then we'll be base 9.

2472
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:22,650
Base 8.

2473
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,310
Uh, we need a medieval workbench and then we'll be base 9.

2474
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,870
Uh, good question.

2475
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:30,470
Okay, I'll put the tombats in.

2476
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:31,910
Wait, alright.

2477
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:33,450
Who do we replace for the tombats?

2478
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,310
Uh, anybody really.

2479
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:36,950
Anybody?

2480
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:37,830
Okay, I'm replacing...

2481
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:39,350
Except for the elk.

2482
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:40,670
Pretty much anybody else is...

2483
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,810
The fuck's the elk?

2484
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:42,930
There's no elk in here.

2485
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:44,770
Okay, is someone level 12 on base?

2486
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:45,990
I'm not level 12 yet.

2487
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:49,810
Uh, can you build the medieval workbench?

2488
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:50,650
Yeah.

2489
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:52,870
Thank you.

2490
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,630
Alright, I got rid of the vixie and the creamy.

2491
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:57,690
Do we need those?

2492
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:57,990
Okay.

2493
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:00,570
Um, vixie is probably...

2494
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:02,010
Is good to have, uh, creamy is not.

2495
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:04,270
Alright, I'll... What do you wanna replace for the...

2496
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:05,270
The vixie then?

2497
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:06,770
Why'd they call it creamy?

2498
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:08,910
Uh, let me take a look.

2499
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:09,770
I guess the chicken, right?

2500
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:12,010
Do we need... We don't need the chicken.

2501
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:12,650
Chicken can give us food.

2502
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:14,010
We can get rid of the syndicate thug.

2503
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:14,730
We don't really need him.

2504
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:17,110
We don't need him?

2505
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,270
He is a person.

2506
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:22,070
You can't just throw people away.

2507
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:23,770
You can't just throw people away.

2508
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:24,290
They are...

2509
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:25,050
They all matter.

2510
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:27,790
Don't worry, I'll go to the black marketeer.

2511
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:28,530
I'll sell them off.

2512
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:34,350
Dude, I wish that we could capture him, but that's an exploit.

2513
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:36,370
It's fun having him on base.

2514
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:37,690
No, you can capture him.

2515
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:38,730
What?

2516
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:41,750
You just can't capture him with a campfire.

2517
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:43,510
Yeah, we can't like...

2518
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:45,750
As long as you're doing the damage and stuff.

2519
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:47,310
Yeah, I guess so.

2520
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:50,550
Alright, I have the tombad in.

2521
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,890
Our pals are stressed though, cause there's not enough beds.

2522
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,170
Okay, I'll build some more beds.

2523
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,190
We're gonna find him...

2524
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,070
Someone's like, we're gonna find him a new family.

2525
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:02,490
We're gonna find him a new family.

2526
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:07,590
We'll take care of him much better than any other family ever could.

2527
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:08,050
True.

2528
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:09,750
Yeah, exactly.

2529
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:10,670
So true.

2530
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,930
Alright, I'm gonna see if we can find that fucking...

2531
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:16,770
We have like three stars on Yelp as a family.

2532
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,270
Oh, the ravine dungeon is like...

2533
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:19,390
It's not bad.

2534
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:19,650
It's not bad.

2535
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:21,570
It's not bad.

2536
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:24,130
We're trying our best here.

2537
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:24,210
Could it be better?

2538
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:24,650
Sure.

2539
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:26,810
But like, we're not asking for perfection.

2540
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:29,930
Nobody's perfect, you know.

2541
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:30,930
I am.

2542
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:32,010
Cause he's perfect.

2543
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:33,930
He's the only perfect person out here.

2544
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:34,670
Well then.

2545
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:36,930
Cause he silenced all the other opinions.

2546
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,450
No, I'm not a silencer.

2547
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:41,550
Oh, we got two victims.

2548
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:42,710
Didn't you say you fucking...

2549
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:44,390
Didn't you literally say...

2550
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:47,370
You ban anyone whose opinions don't match yours?

2551
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:48,670
I think you're putting words into my mouth.

2552
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,790
You can't silence...

2553
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,550
You can't ban me.

2554
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:55,890
You're too smart to be gaslit.

2555
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:56,730
You're too smart to be gaslit.

2556
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:02,320
Alright, we got two Vixies in the ranch.

2557
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,220
They're gonna make powballs for us.

2558
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:04,680
Nice.

2559
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,000
Wait, before I go...

2560
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,440
How many powballs do we have?

2561
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,440
I have 12.

2562
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,680
I might wanna grab some more before I go.

2563
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,020
Did someone feed this to me?

2564
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:16,580
Alright, we're base level 9.

2565
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:17,700
Nice.

2566
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:18,200
Nice.

2567
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,960
There's nobody in here.

2568
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:24,280
I'm gonna have to start leveling up myself.

2569
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,000
I can't build any of the new things anymore.

2570
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,580
What did I free?

2571
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,020
I can.

2572
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:28,780
What do you need built?

2573
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:31,860
We need the sphere workbench, which is level 14.

2574
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,880
And we need the cooler box, which is level 13.

2575
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:39,440
For those.

2576
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,160
Sphere bench.

2577
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:42,620
Alright, let me see what materials we need.

2578
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:44,020
And the cooling box?

2579
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:44,720
The cooler?

2580
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,700
We actually have enough stuff for it already.

2581
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,680
We just need...

2582
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,600
Oh, we need ice organs.

2583
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,960
If anybody has ice organs.

2584
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,740
We know where to get them if we don't already have them.

2585
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,960
Wait, who do we kill for that?

2586
01:29:57,580 --> 01:29:58,300
The penguins.

2587
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,100
Oh, okay.

2588
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:00,260
But they're nearby.

2589
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,200
I'm gonna go murder them.

2590
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,360
There should be lots of penguins here.

2591
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:08,500
If you can put any ice organs you have in the chest, we can make the cooler.

2592
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:09,100
Alright.

2593
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,960
I have 15 ice organs.

2594
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:11,340
Hold up.

2595
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:11,960
Ayooo!

2596
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:12,820
Let's go!

2597
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:13,780
There's 3 here.

2598
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,380
There's like 5 of them here.

2599
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:16,960
Ice organs?

2600
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:19,860
Organ.

2601
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:22,580
It's so weird.

2602
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,200
It's like, what are the achievements?

2603
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,560
And I'm like, well, I can't share.

2604
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,320
I don't know why.

2605
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,080
You can't share it.

2606
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,280
I don't know man.

2607
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,780
I'm pretty sure there's viewer Google Docs.

2608
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,540
Yeah, there is.

2609
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:35,020
There is a viewer one.

2610
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:39,020
They just didn't want to link the main one so it doesn't crash and people edit it.

2611
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,720
And we're just like, what's going on?

2612
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,060
I'm freaking out!

2613
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:46,200
Well, if my mods have access to that and want to share it, please do.

2614
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,640
I linked it once, but I don't know.

2615
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:47,660
I don't know.

2616
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,840
I don't know if my mods did anything.

2617
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:50,520
I don't know.

2618
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:50,860
I don't know.

2619
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:51,700
You know what?

2620
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,760
Just enjoy.

2621
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:54,640
Just enjoy the moment.

2622
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:59,820
It's like you see us catching humans and you're like, why are we wasting time catching a human?

2623
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:00,280
What the fuck?

2624
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,560
That was a really nice way of saying, I don't want to do it.

2625
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,340
Just enjoy the moment.

2626
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,580
Don't get absorbed with this.

2627
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,320
You're taking this too seriously.

2628
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:14,860
Come on.

2629
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:16,000
Just look at us.

2630
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,220
Doesn't it look like we're taking this so seriously?

2631
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:19,920
I'm just going to go drown myself.

2632
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,380
Enjoy the moment!

2633
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,500
Enjoy the moment!

2634
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,820
And he's enjoying the moment drowning himself.

2635
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,140
Alright, I'm going to grab a couple things.

2636
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:35,380
I'm going to go level myself for a little bit and come back.

2637
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,860
But yeah, cooler box and the other one.

2638
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,240
I'm going to make another chest.

2639
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,560
Put my ancient civilization thing.

2640
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,740
And then our first sphere worm expunge.

2641
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,860
I can probably...

2642
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,980
catch the penguin dude.

2643
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,160
Lucky.

2644
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,440
Well you said you already had 15 of those ice organs.

2645
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,980
We have like 30 in there now.

2646
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,820
The boss penguin, like the one for the achievement.

2647
01:31:58,860 --> 01:31:59,780
Ah yeah yeah yeah.

2648
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,080
He's pretty low level.

2649
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,080
He's only like 15 or so.

2650
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,900
We have 30 already in there.

2651
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:05,640
The only problem is the other little guys that come with him.

2652
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,320
Wait, is the boss dungeon solo or can you do it in pairs?

2653
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,080
You have to do it as a team.

2654
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,160
Wait actually, boss dungeons?

2655
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:12,020
Let me double check.

2656
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,060
I don't know.

2657
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:13,620
I can wait.

2658
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:14,820
I'm sure you can just solo catch them.

2659
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,660
Yeah the boss dungeons, it's solo.

2660
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,060
Okay okay.

2661
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,960
There's other stuff that's like...

2662
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:23,180
different.

2663
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,920
That's like global for fun.

2664
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,020
But we can easily do other dungeons again.

2665
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:32,800
Also, sure, do you already have the incubator unlocked?

2666
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,360
Did you fight a boss yet?

2667
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,160
Not yet.

2668
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:37,980
I can make a breeding farm.

2669
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:39,480
Okay.

2670
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,400
I mean...

2671
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,280
Yeah?

2672
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:42,900
I don't know what to do right now.

2673
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,140
Right now we need to build the...

2674
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,320
I just need someone who's a higher level to build the thing.

2675
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,220
What level?

2676
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,600
Cooler box and sphere workbench.

2677
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:53,040
14.

2678
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:54,380
Oh I'm 14 already.

2679
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:57,480
I'm only 12 so I gotta go on all.

2680
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,900
The small penguins are an issue.

2681
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,260
We need 20 ingots and 10 nails.

2682
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,260
I'm doing it.

2683
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,500
Oh you're doing it?

2684
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,000
You're building?

2685
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:05,220
Okay.

2686
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,440
We should have nails and ingots already in the box.

2687
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,440
I swear I'm doing it.

2688
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,560
Okay I'm gonna help us get more ingots set.

2689
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,240
Okay.

2690
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,760
I'm on code level.

2691
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,660
I have another dog with me.

2692
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,840
Super mining.

2693
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:19,240
How about?

2694
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,020
Alright.

2695
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,080
What the dog doing?

2696
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,440
What the dog doing?

2697
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,700
Grab more ingots.

2698
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,100
Oh she respawned.

2699
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:29,600
The NPC.

2700
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,620
I can catch her now.

2701
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:31,460
Oh nice!

2702
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,100
Nice.

2703
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,120
We're almost there.

2704
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,200
We're almost at 20.

2705
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,560
She keeps alerting the authorities.

2706
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,460
How dare her call the cops.

2707
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:39,440
Right?

2708
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:41,380
We're trying to get her home.

2709
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,080
Get her home.

2710
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,360
I'm shooting her and I had a couple times so she's catchable.

2711
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,520
What the heck man.

2712
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:49,980
Yeah.

2713
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,420
She should enjoy the moment.

2714
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,440
She's being too hot on herself.

2715
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,620
Yeah just enjoy the moment.

2716
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,000
We should let it happen.

2717
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:06,200
Just get caught.

2718
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,280
Come on.

2719
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,280
VTubers are murderers.

2720
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,060
What?

2721
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:11,480
No.

2722
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,160
What?

2723
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:12,740
Us?

2724
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:17,000
I'm trying to not murder her but the police shows up and they murder her.

2725
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:17,280
Yeah.

2726
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:19,480
It's self defense.

2727
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:23,700
What the?

2728
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:26,960
Alright.

2729
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:27,940
Let's see.

2730
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:29,300
I have a lot of ingots.

2731
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:30,240
Do we need more ingots?

2732
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,300
Do we have enough?

2733
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,920
We need hella ingots.

2734
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,620
On god.

2735
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,400
Alright.

2736
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,300
I'm gonna try to be trifling.

2737
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,840
I put a lot of ores in the box.

2738
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:40,480
Damn it.

2739
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,540
Stay in the box ball thing.

2740
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,220
It's comfy.

2741
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:44,560
Trust.

2742
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:45,980
Trust.

2743
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,320
This box is so comfy.

2744
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,160
Yes.

2745
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:51,720
I did it.

2746
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,480
I'm gonna...

2747
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,060
I'm gonna...

2748
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:56,700
I kinda want it but what if I just walk off?

2749
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,120
Oh.

2750
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,080
Come on.

2751
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:04,600
Stay in the box.

2752
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:07,640
The police follows me after capturing a human.

2753
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,720
That is unfortunate.

2754
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,240
Can't believe this is where our tax dollars go to.

2755
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:17,500
Can't believe you're funding this.

2756
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,080
Yeah.

2757
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,060
Can't believe this is why you shouldn't pay taxes.

2758
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,020
Whose fox pirate is this?

2759
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:26,420
It's mine.

2760
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:27,380
I put it there.

2761
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:27,840
Oh my god.

2762
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,720
Just hit me in the face already.

2763
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:29,340
Please.

2764
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:30,180
I beg you.

2765
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:31,320
Alright.

2766
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,080
I got you.

2767
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,720
We have dwarves.

2768
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:35,140
Nice.

2769
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,300
Now it's a lot faster.

2770
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:37,620
There we go.

2771
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:38,680
Faster burning.

2772
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:41,760
Where in the world...

2773
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,580
Where did that lift monk go?

2774
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:49,380
He's just staring at me.

2775
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,060
Oh my goodness.

2776
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:50,500
Anthony.

2777
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,040
Please.

2778
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,340
Lily you matter.

2779
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:56,640
Lily you matter.

2780
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,080
Don't do it.

2781
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,020
Don't do it.

2782
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:01,900
Oh my god.

2783
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:02,120
Please.

2784
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:02,380
I beg.

2785
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,300
One punch in the face.

2786
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,160
And surely I'm dead.

2787
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:04,720
There we go.

2788
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,400
I...

2789
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,480
I have more ore for you.

2790
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:12,900
I have more ore for you.

2791
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:15,720
Mining away.

2792
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:17,500
Mining away.

2793
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,460
I can do a minecraft cover now.

2794
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,560
You can play giraffe town now.

2795
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:24,860
I can play giraffe town.

2796
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:27,880
Oh yeah.

2797
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:28,700
Giraffe town is a...

2798
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,400
Legendary adventure.

2799
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,480
About a giraffe in a town.

2800
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:33,780
Whoa.

2801
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,260
That little lag spike there.

2802
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:36,780
Holy shit.

2803
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,320
Please stop lagging my game guys.

2804
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:41,680
Please stop lagging my game guys.

2805
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,480
I'm level 15 now.

2806
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:44,840
I'm level 15 now.

2807
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,560
Oh my god.

2808
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,340
You're level 23.

2809
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,760
That is our power leveler.

2810
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:48,260
Right there.

2811
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:51,720
That is our power leveler.

2812
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,380
Have you caught any of the...

2813
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:55,640
Have you caught any of the...

2814
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,960
Boss Pokemons yet?

2815
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,340
I mean Powmons.

2816
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:03,740
Yeah I think we should probably work on getting like the chill out so we can get the egg incubator.

2817
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,600
Yeah I think we should probably work on getting like the chill out so we can get the egg incubator.

2818
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,320
Yeah.

2819
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,060
Go Sheriff 4.

2820
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,000
We're egging.

2821
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,240
Oh shit we still have 3 hours?

2822
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,440
Yeah but the eggs take so long though so we might as well get it now.

2823
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:16,360
No no no the server has it so it's like 2 minutes.

2824
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:16,840
Oh.

2825
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,360
For large eggs it's an hour.

2826
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:20,480
Yeah that's what I'm saying.

2827
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,840
Yeah so I feel like we should grab some eggs now.

2828
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:27,140
Like get the egg incubator now in case we find a large egg.

2829
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:31,060
Like get the egg incubator now in case we find a large egg.

2830
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:31,340
Let's see.

2831
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:34,960
I'll grab some more ore for this.

2832
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,760
No my weapon.

2833
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,860
Tom is taking a break?

2834
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,460
I don't think so.

2835
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:42,140
Is this a competition?

2836
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,160
There's no other eggs in tournaments.

2837
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,040
I dare you.

2838
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,140
But you matter don't worry.

2839
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,800
But you do matter.

2840
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:54,440
But please don't take a break ever.

2841
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,840
Peace and love.

2842
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,060
Where the fuck is it?

2843
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,340
Oh it's so far away.

2844
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:02,440
I'll grab the chillit.

2845
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,660
Where is it?

2846
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:04,200
Chillit.

2847
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:06,500
Chillit is...

2848
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:07,780
like...

2849
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,380
It's okay I googled.

2850
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:11,160
Okay.

2851
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,200
I do not know how to describe where it is.

2852
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:15,240
It's near us though.

2853
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,300
It's not far.

2854
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:21,060
Alright.

2855
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,160
It's like here.

2856
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:27,600
Report my achievements?

2857
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:28,940
What achievement did I get?

2858
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:30,880
It's okay.

2859
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,660
PP's mod.

2860
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:32,380
You got a shiny?

2861
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,480
Did that count for something?

2862
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:34,200
Yeah we got a shiny.

2863
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,820
But which one?

2864
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:37,920
What do we report?

2865
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,480
I don't know what's going on.

2866
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:47,940
PP's mod.

2867
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:49,300
Report my shiny lamp.

2868
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:53,740
Go PP.

2869
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:54,300
Go.

2870
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:55,780
Alright nice.

2871
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:57,520
Wait do I have balls?

2872
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:58,740
I do right?

2873
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:00,340
I don't fuck.

2874
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:00,680
Surely.

2875
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:04,980
I was there and I was like wait a minute I don't even have my pal balls.

2876
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,520
They were there in the next second.

2877
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:08,180
That's what I said.

2878
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:10,560
Before you leave you gotta check your balls.

2879
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,360
Always check your balls guys.

2880
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,060
Always check your balls before you leave.

2881
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:15,540
Why is it always about balls?

2882
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,000
It's okay I got one ball.

2883
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:20,220
That should be enough for chillit.

2884
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,940
Mod says it's done.

2885
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:22,780
Nice.

2886
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,580
Surely balls matter.

2887
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:24,860
Mod make sure all our...

2888
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,700
Okay the cooler box and the pal sphere is made.

2889
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,880
Mod make sure all our achievements getting reported.

2890
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:33,340
Mods.

2891
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,240
Mods.

2892
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:35,540
Mods.

2893
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,220
Unpaid interns do your jobs.

2894
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:37,600
Yeah.

2895
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:45,160
We're not gonna write your references if you don't.

2896
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:46,740
We're not gonna write your references if you don't.

2897
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:47,100
Nope.

2898
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:48,460
That's right.

2899
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:50,760
You'll never be able to leave me for a better streamer.

2900
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,320
Exactly.

2901
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:52,920
You'll never know.

2902
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:55,680
Where the hell is this thing going?

2903
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,560
You can't leave me if you don't have a resume.

2904
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:04,310
Resume.

2905
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:06,850
Oh King Paka?

2906
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:07,910
Wait what level is King Paka?

2907
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:08,730
Oh no he's level 23.

2908
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:09,310
Nah fuck that.

2909
01:40:10,030 --> 01:40:12,790
He's enough level for sure.

2910
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:14,230
He's level 23 right now.

2911
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,170
Yo fuck him up.

01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:17,430

01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:30,430

01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:37,190

Ow.

2927
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:07,000
Don't worry I'm doing like 2 damage per second with my pickaxe.

2928
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:07,160
Ah.

2929
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,120

2930
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:09,740

2931
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:10,380

What the fuck?

2938
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,120
That's so little.

2939
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:24,800
I got the chillit guys.

2940
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:27,880

2942
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:30,620
We can get the incubator.

2943
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,840
Go to my stream right now.

2944
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:38,660

We got noodle.

2947
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:47,480
I need better piles I can't kill shit anymore.

2948
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:49,840
My pile is just like...

2949
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:50,540
Oh I got an egg too.

2950
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,700
Mining a rock while I'm fighting stuff off.

2951
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,440
Stop killing everything.

2952
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:56,020
We're trying to catch them.

2953
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:00,000
I'm heading over now to give us the...

2954
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:01,740
the incubator.

2955
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:02,280
Oh wait what am I doing?

2956
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:05,440

2957
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,100

2958
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,360
What the fuuuu...

2959
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,500
King Paka just ran off in the other direction.

2960
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,000
Can he leave the boss area?

2961
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:14,340
I think they all can technically.

2962
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,340
If you aggro it.

2963
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:17,220
If you aggro it yeah.

2964
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,980
I didn't aggro him but dude he uh...

2965
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:21,780
He's got shit to do I guess.

2966
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,020
I guess he forgot to pay his taxes or something.

2967
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:24,620
He was in a hurry.

2968
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:26,960
Alright let's see.

2969
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:34,600
Uhhhh...

2970
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:36,700
Got the chillit right here.

2971
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:38,220
I'm gonna put that chillit in my team now.

2972
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:39,560
Alright.

2973
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:42,500
Let me level up that incubator.

2974
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,740
We have...

2975
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:44,860
We need palladium fragments.

2976
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:47,180
Does anyone have extra palladium fragments?

2977
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,100
Uh I can mine some.

2978
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,180
Yeah I need some fragments.

2979
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,940
To make the incubator.

2980
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:54,420
I'm pretty sure I just put some in a chest.

2981
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:58,680
No cause I can't make it.

2982
01:42:58,760 --> 01:42:59,660
Oh yeah I did I did.

2983
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:00,280
Yeah I see it.

2984
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:02,220
Alright.

2985
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:02,700
Nice.

2986
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:05,160
Alright incubator.

2987
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,060
I'm gonna put it right here.

2988
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:10,460
Alright.

2989
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,240
Here you go.

2990
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:17,420
Right right.

2991
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:19,700
I should finally make a crossbow.

2992
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,100
I've been trying to beat everything up with a pickaxe.

2993
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,240
I've been trying to beat everything up with a pickaxe.

2994
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,440
It wasn't really the smartest thing to do.

2995
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:30,880
Let's see.

2996
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:33,000
It's so annoying.

2997
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:36,380
I can't climb anything cause of like the pingy shield.

2998
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,320
I guess so I have to look everywhere.

2999
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:39,540
I can't climb anything cause of like the pingy shield.

3000
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:44,700
Every time I climb I have to like slow climb cause the second I press space I just like snap back.

3001
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:44,920
Every time I climb I have to like slow climb cause the second I press space I just like snap back.

3002
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:45,320
Every time I climb I have to like slow climb cause the second I press space I just like snap back.

3003
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,040
Snap back to reality.

3004
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:48,560
Oh there goes gravity.

3005
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:51,000
He won't give up that easy.

3006
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,460
Let's see.

3007
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:54,300
Get more weight in here.

3008
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:56,480
Oh no my pals are stressed.

3009
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,680
Get used to it.

3010
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:01,280
This is your life now.

3011
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:01,860
Woah.

3012
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,860
We have a healthy work environment.

3013
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,980
Don't worry guys.

3014
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:09,440
Nobody is getting abused.

3015
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:10,340
I swear.

3016
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,180
Everybody wants to work for our company.

3017
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:19,440
Our company.

3018
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:19,760
Our company.

3019
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:20,680
Yeah.

3020
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,140
Money isn't real.

3021
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:23,500
Tell them.

3022
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:30,830
Let's see.

3023
01:44:31,170 --> 01:44:31,730
Let's see.

3024
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:32,690
I'm gonna grab more penguins.

3025
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:33,670
Whoops.

3026
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:35,750
No my balls.

3027
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:37,830
Alright I should be 15 in a second.

3028
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:39,210
I can't climb.

3029
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,610
Wait what's our PAL base?

3030
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:45,390
Why do I have all those ingots?

3031
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:47,030
What's our PAL base level right now?

3032
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:49,690
It should be level 9 or 10.

3033
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,190
Oh shit we're almost at 12.

3034
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:53,390
Yeah we're doing really good.

3035
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:56,910
I got the penguin.

3036
01:44:57,330 --> 01:45:02,110
It's only about materials now because we already have somebody the right level.

3037
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:04,090
What materials do we need?

3038
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:04,510
Good question.

3039
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:06,050
I'm about to come back to base.

3040
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:06,690
Yeah.

3041
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:09,670
I can mine some materials right now for us.

3042
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,530
I know that we're gonna need ingot.

3043
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:13,990
But I have like 26.

3044
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:18,890
Did we already build the cooler?

3045
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:20,390
Yeah we have a cooler.

3046
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:22,050
Yeah I already leveled this thing.

3047
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,850
Okay okay.

3048
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:25,190
Alright I'm heading back.

3049
01:45:27,090 --> 01:45:28,510
My new tactic didn't work.

3050
01:45:28,710 --> 01:45:30,370
I figured I can just spam.

3051
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:31,930
The dodge button.

3052
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:33,830
Don't try to kill something.

3053
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:35,490
It doesn't fucking work.

3054
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:41,030
Would I have to stick to killing easy stuff?

3055
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:42,790
So when I get hit it doesn't matter.

3056
01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:44,450
Wait where the fuck is the...

3057
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:47,070
Oh no.

3058
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:47,990
Is it up there?

3059
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:49,490
No it was up there.

3060
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:56,820
I'm like trying to figure out where the fast travel is down here.

3061
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:00,000
I believe in you.

3062
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:04,100
I'm so lost.

3063
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:04,380
I'm so lost.

3064
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,080
Alright grabbing this thing.

3065
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:09,840
Oh it's over here.

3066
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:11,980
Did we make the incubator?

3067
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,960
Yeah we did it's up on the cliff.

3068
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,200
Cool cool cool.

3069
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,720
I put it on the cliff.

3070
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,220
I'm heading back.

3071
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:22,360
Nice I did it.

3072
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,180
I found this thing.

3073
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,300
I did it.

3074
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,180
Did you catch the sweepy yet?

3075
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,160
Or get a sweepy?

3076
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:31,760
Surefour?

3077
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,360
I'm gonna go catch stuff in a bit.

3078
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:38,300
But I just asked my chat if they're gonna clip it when I kill a boss.

3079
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:39,320
And they're all spamming no.

3080
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,040
Guys!

3081
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:47,520
Don't you want us to win?

3082
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,340
They're gonna say no.

3083
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,400
That's not the question you wanna ask.

3084
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,840
Okay don't you want Shy Lily to win?

3085
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:55,900
Yeah!

3086
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,040
Actually they might say yes.

3087
01:46:58,060 --> 01:46:59,740
They might say yes.

3088
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:01,640
They might say yes for Lily.

3089
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,360
Guys think of it.

3090
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,080
Lily wants to win.

3091
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:07,340
Please just feel sorry for me.

3092
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,040
It's like 50-50.

3093
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,260
We got no ifs and yeses for that.

3094
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:15,760
Let's see.

3095
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,700
What do I need to do?

3096
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,920
Someone said if Lily wins, Surefour wins guys.

3097
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:20,480
So no.

3098
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:26,880
Guys don't worry.

3099
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,940
We'll kick Surefour out at the last second.

3100
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,300
So then only Lily...

3101
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:33,700
Only I will win.

3102
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,200
Don't worry.

3103
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,340
We'll sue you for discrimination.

3104
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:39,700
I guess disqualified last second.

3105
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,660
Yeah yeah don't worry.

3106
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:42,040
Disqualified for what?

3107
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,560
We'll plan an exploit.

3108
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,180
We'll plot something.

3109
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:49,180
Don't worry.

3110
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,400
How am I being called a cheater again?

3111
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,280
Oh it's a reentering theme.

3112
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,300
Yeah you don't know.

3113
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:58,500
You don't know.

3114
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,000
What the?

3115
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,680
Coincidence?

3116
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:02,680
Mmmmm.

3117
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:03,200
Mmmmm.

3118
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:04,500
Mmmmm.

3119
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:07,080
I don't know.

3120
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:10,020
Doesn't seem much of a coincidence anymore.

3121
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:12,080
It's a little coinkydink.

3122
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,780
Surely there's some truth to it.

3123
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:15,360
Mmmmm.

3124
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:16,700
Got it.

3125
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,060
I'm getting more iron.

3126
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:20,820
Do we just need ore?

3127
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:25,340
I've got a bunch but I took it with me for some reason.

3128
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:27,180
Yeah but like what materials do we need?

3129
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:27,960
For all the other stuff?

3130
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:29,860
Hold on one second.

3131
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:30,740
Bye.

3132
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:33,820
I'm gonna mark my map.

3133
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:36,340
Bye.

3134
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:43,320
So one of Pia's mods said they would clip and don't worry and now my chat is gunning them down.

3135
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:44,140
What is happening?

3136
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:47,300
Run!

3137
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,680
They're like hide the evidence!

3138
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:50,500
Hide the evidence!

3139
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:53,340
Run!

3140
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,720
The moat is Helper's massacre if you don't know.

3141
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,900
You weren't built for a flesh tuber's chat!

3142
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,860
You weren't built for it!

3143
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:04,600
Don't touch my soft V-tube.

3144
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:05,720
You leave them alone.

3145
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:08,800
Oh no.

3146
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:09,940
You showed weakness.

3147
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:10,880
You're fucked now.

3148
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,560
You should never show weakness.

3149
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:16,300
They bite around here.

3150
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:19,640
Alright I'm putting the ingot in the chest.

3151
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:23,180
I'm gonna look at sweep up where.

3152
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,540
We don't count deaths here.

3153
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:28,040
We don't count deaths.

3154
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:28,940
We don't count deaths.

3155
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:29,600
Sweep up boss.

3156
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:31,060
Me too.

3157
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:32,840
I'm counting too.

3158
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:34,320
Alright.

3159
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,960
Wheat plantation, mill, cooking pot.

3160
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:38,840
Where the fuck is the sweep up boss?

3161
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,480
If you have the resources I can build it.

3162
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:42,920
I think we have right?

3163
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,360
I can build the wheat plantation.

3164
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:45,680
We need wheat seeds though.

3165
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,260
You buy them from Ventar.

3166
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,560
Oh we can just buy it?

3167
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:51,700
Yeah.

3168
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:55,040
I'll buy the seeds now.

3169
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,240
We need wheat seeds and uh let's see.

3170
01:49:57,260 --> 01:49:58,240
What do we need for the cooking pot?

3171
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,060
Where's the house?

3172
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:01,520
Otherwise I think we have everything for that.

3173
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:03,640
Did you kill Pang King?

3174
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:05,580
No I didn't.

3175
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:07,820
I need someone who is level 17 to make the cooking pot.

3176
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:08,500
I can make.

3177
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:09,600
Wait what level am I?

3178
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:10,920
We have all the stuff already.

3179
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,120
I'm level 17 I can make it yeah.

3180
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,000
I'll buy the wheat seeds right now.

3181
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:16,720
Thank you.

3182
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:18,900
So I'll make the cooking pot.

3183
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:22,520
Wait what was the person?

3184
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:24,720
There you are.

3185
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,280
Mr. Merchant do you have the seeds?

3186
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:28,220
I don't.

3187
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,640
No that's the pal Merchant.

3188
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:33,680
Alright.

3189
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:37,380
I'm just trying to retrieve my stuff.

3190
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:39,040
Um.

3191
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,360
Mr. Merchant do you have the seeds?

3192
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:41,040
These ones are fine actually.

3193
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,340
Oh I got wheat seeds.

3194
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,720
Nice!

3195
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:48,020
I'm dead.

3196
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:48,940
What can I build right now?

3197
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:50,680
Oh my god what happened?

3198
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:54,000
Uh my Pokemon weren't on aggressive.

3199
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,720
And then I they didn't attack.

3200
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,420
And then I got swift in one shot.

3201
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,020
Damn.

3202
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:00,340
You fell off.

3203
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,680
Oh my god there you are.

3204
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:06,240
Alright I put the seeds in one of the boxes.

3205
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:07,140
Alright.

3206
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,400
So you can just make it.

3207
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,220
And then I'll make the cooking pot.

3208
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:14,500
I'll make the wheat plantation and then someone can make the cooking pot.

3209
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:15,380
Yeah I can make it now.

3210
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:16,480
Alright cool.

3211
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:17,880
Nice.

3212
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:19,240
I'll put it right.

3213
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:22,160
I'll put it next to the incubator.

3214
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:23,960
Oh can you put the wheat seeds in the box?

3215
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:24,960
Yeah I did I just did.

3216
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,060
Oh shit.

3217
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,100
Should be in one.

3218
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:28,640
We need two more.

3219
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,040
Oh we need two wheat seeds?

3220
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:31,180
We need three of them.

3221
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:33,940
Sorry my bad.

3222
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,420
Do I have enough money?

3223
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:37,580
We need two more right?

3224
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:39,000
Yeah two more.

3225
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:40,320
I'm gonna get out of here.

3226
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:42,180
Goodbye.

3227
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,400
Don't worry here I am.

3228
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:49,700
God we have so much ingot.

3229
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:50,580
I love this space.

3230
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:55,460
I have just enough for two more wheat seeds.

3231
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:56,960
I'm gonna go grab the...

3232
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,320
I'm gonna go grab the leather I left behind.

3233
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:02,700
Nice.

3234
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,760
Alright now I'm broke.

3235
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:04,760
For the wheat.

3236
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:06,740
It's for the wheat.

3237
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:07,740
It's a good purchase.

3238
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:08,860
Do it for the wheat.

3239
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:11,980
I'm heading over.

3240
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,220
Someone's slacking off we have to eat him now.

3241
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:16,660
Oh yeah.

3242
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:18,560
Well we can make a machete.

3243
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:18,720
We can make a machete.

3244
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:22,840
It's to send a message.

3245
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:23,980
No slacking off.

3246
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:33,190
Slack off and get eaten.

3247
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:36,350
We can replace you with another life monk.

3248
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:37,270
But you matter.

3249
01:52:37,370 --> 01:52:37,770
Don't worry.

3250
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:40,490
Setting a large egg.

3251
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:42,570
We got the cooking pot.

3252
01:52:43,710 --> 01:52:44,190
And...

3253
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:45,470
Nice.

3254
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:48,190
I have two seeds now.

3255
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:49,030
I put it in.

3256
01:52:51,790 --> 01:52:52,870
Okay thank you.

3257
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:53,570
I'll build up.

3258
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:56,190
I'll build up the beds for guys.

3259
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:57,350
They're stressed out.

3260
01:52:58,150 --> 01:52:58,790
Got it.

3261
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:03,550
Have we got any extra arrows around here?

3262
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:04,650
Uh...

3263
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:06,710
I'll put some in the box.

3264
01:53:07,090 --> 01:53:07,630
Thank you.

3265
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:10,690
I'm gonna go catch the sweepa.

3266
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:13,350
Oh sorry.

3267
01:53:13,450 --> 01:53:14,090
I only had seven.

3268
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:14,530
My bad.

3269
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:15,630
Good enough.

3270
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,310
Where the fuck is the sweepa?

3271
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:19,550
Sweepa boss where?

3272
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:21,390
Sweepa.

3273
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:22,650
Where are you?

3274
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:25,610

3275
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:26,550
Holy shit.

3276
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:27,230
I can get there.

3277
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,460
Get ready to report this.

3278
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:39,220
I'm ready to travel so fucking far for this one sweepa boss.

3279
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:40,360
I'm ready to travel so fucking far for this one sweepa boss.

3280
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:41,080
I'm ready to travel so fucking far for this one sweepa boss.

3281
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,840
Wait actually...

3282
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:43,520
Can I...

3283
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:44,720
We need more wood.

3284
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:46,260
No?

3285
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:46,560
Okay.

3286
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,080
Guys balls check.

3287
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,300
Balls check.

3288
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:53,020
Balls check.

3289
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,360
Balls check.

3290
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:56,820
Balls still there?

3291
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:02,860
I can't see but I think I'm going the right way.

3292
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:08,680
I almost died cause I always...

3293
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:10,460
Turn on my glider...

3294
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:11,360
Before I hit the ground.

3295
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:12,020
Oh no.

3296
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:15,460
Oh no I think I'm dead.

3297
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:17,220
I accidentally ran into water.

3298
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,480
Accidentally in water.

3299
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:20,660
No!

3300
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:20,980
No!

3301
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:23,860
He'll be fine.

3302
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:25,040
I think he'll be fine.

3303
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:26,040
We'll just keep swimming.

3304
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:27,020
Alright.

3305
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:30,860
Once the wheat farm is finished then we're going to be level 10.

3306
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:32,660
We'll be okay.

3307
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:35,720
I don't know where...

3308
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,200
Oh hey.

3309
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:39,260
Oh I found reincarnated guy!

3310
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:41,440
Come to me.

3311
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:43,340
We got to take a picture.

3312
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:43,680
Let's go.

3313
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,800
Come to me we got to take a picture.

3314
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:49,000
Wait do I have to catch the boss or kill it?

3315
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,980
Cause technically I killed it.

3316
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:53,040
You have to capture field.

3317
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:53,920
You have to capture it.

3318
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,360
You have to capture it.

3319
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:56,940
Oh no.

3320
01:54:58,600 --> 01:54:59,720
Guys get to me!

3321
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:02,080
I found the reincarnated guy!

3322
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:04,480
We can do that.

3323
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:06,560
Okay we need level 20.

3324
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:08,300
We need someone to make the work bench.

3325
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,020
I'm sorry the weapons work bench.

3326
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:11,560
At level 20.

3327
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:13,900
I'll make nails right now.

3328
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,740
I don't know if I can find him again.

3329
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:17,840
Oh you got nails?

3330
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:18,200
Okay.

3331
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:19,700
Oh I see I see.

3332
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,740
You can't mark on the map.

3333
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:23,260
Wait we can mark him?

3334
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:24,680
Yeah yeah yeah.

3335
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,620
All we need is the weapons work bench.

3336
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:27,300
We'll be level 11.

3337
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:28,980
Okay.

3338
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:29,820
I marked him.

3339
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:31,100
I did it.

3340
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:31,840
I found...

3341
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,880
Nearly drowning saved my life.

3342
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:38,100
Do we need for day 2 Do we need a different level of base?

3343
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,360
Or is it like just 12?

3344
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,160
Day 2 we need 20.

3345
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:43,460
Oh okay.

3346
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:44,160
Easy.

3347
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,320
And then we have to capture 2 black marketeer.

3348
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:48,980
Level up any pal to level 50.

3349
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,620
Oh shit you can't catch them then.

3350
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:50,980
Okay cool.

3351
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:52,220
Yeah we have to capture you later.

3352
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,060
Just normal.

3353
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:53,580
Just normal.

3354
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:55,800
No I know but I didn't know that I didn't...

3355
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:59,140
I still feel like it's a little bit exploity to catch them but like...

3356
01:55:59,140 --> 01:55:59,500
Yeah okay.

3357
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:02,400
They even said it's fine you can do the pal recycling with them.

3358
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:02,740
Nice.

3359
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:05,540
How do I get out of here?

3360
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:07,620
It's so dark.

3361
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:08,540
I can't see.

3362
01:56:11,690 --> 01:56:13,730
I might just have to get the fox spark.

3363
01:56:15,850 --> 01:56:16,210
My.

3364
01:56:22,130 --> 01:56:23,950
We don't need a second tombaad do we?

3365
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:25,450
No we're good.

3366
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:27,090
Yeah I already have 2 tombaads here.

3367
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:29,410
Might as well catch stuff to just level up.

3368
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:29,870
Yeah.

3369
01:56:30,190 --> 01:56:31,010
True true.

3370
01:56:32,030 --> 01:56:32,950
And you get to...

3371
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:37,170
If you find a level 29 chickpea go for it.

3372
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:38,390
Go for it.

3373
01:56:38,410 --> 01:56:40,150
Cause we still need a level 30 chickpea.

3374
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:43,550
Whenever you come back to base if you can build the weapon...

3375
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:44,610
I think you have to level it yourself.

3376
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:46,230
I don't think there's ever just gonna be a random one.

3377
01:56:46,330 --> 01:56:47,190
Unless it's like a shiny.

3378
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:48,290
Yeah that's what I was thinking.

3379
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:49,870
We find a shiny.

3380
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:54,330
Oh my god where am I?

3381
01:56:54,370 --> 01:56:55,030
I can't see.

3382
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:55,090
That was responsive.

3383
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:56,610
Cool.

3384
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:01,690
I'm trying to get to the sweeper.

3385
01:57:03,790 --> 01:57:05,450
But I can't even see.

3386
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:08,290
Uh oh.

3387
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:11,190
Where am I?

3388
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:13,210
Oh there you are.

3389
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:18,790
Okay we're still low on wood.

3390
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:21,610
I should try to capture a flying pal.

3391
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:21,930
Yep.

3392
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:25,690
That would be very helpful.

3393
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:30,470
I think the...

3394
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:35,970
The easiest and best one you can get at this level is like...

3395
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:39,030
I guess it's still the...

3396
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:40,050
bird one.

3397
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:42,010
I wanna get that...

3398
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:42,410
What was it?

3399
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:43,090
The dragon one.

3400
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:44,990
Yeah that one's way sicker though.

3401
01:57:45,090 --> 01:57:46,330
If you can make it out to the desert.

3402
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:47,950
That one is good.

3403
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:50,210
I need to figure out how to get there.

3404
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:52,450
I'm gonna kill that sweeper and then I'm gonna get it.

3405
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:56,210
Yeah quiver.

3406
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:57,750
Yeah I think that's the one.

3407
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,660
Oh I can't dodge.

3408
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:06,860
Oops.

3409
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:09,300
Alright.

3410
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:10,440
Alright.

3411
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:11,020
Acquired!

3412
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:13,780
Am I close?

3413
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:16,100
Am I close to the sweeper?

3414
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:16,960
Oh god we're one off on wood.

3415
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:18,880
Where is he?

3416
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:22,060
I already forgot where he is.

3417
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:23,420
Where's who?

3418
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,580
The sweeper.

3419
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:26,940
He's so far.

3420
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:29,320
Did you get all the nails made?

3421
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:30,860
Yep everything's made.

3422
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:33,160
All we need is just somebody to make it.

3423
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:35,240
What do I need to make?

3424
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:37,300
It's level 20.

3425
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,440
The weapons workbench.

3426
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:44,560
I'm always last.

3427
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:45,820
Where the fuck do I put it?

3428
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:49,400
And then we'll be level 12 and we'll have completed base for today.

3429
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,960
And I guess it's just like...

3430
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,480
I guess we can keep leveling the base.

3431
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:55,660
Oh yeah we can keep leveling it.

3432
01:58:55,820 --> 01:58:55,820
Yeah.

3433
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:57,840
We level it to level 19.

3434
01:58:58,580 --> 01:58:58,980
Yeah.

3435
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:01,880
So we can get it for level...

3436
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:02,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3437
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:03,840
True, true, true.

3438
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:04,580
Base, base, base.

3439
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:08,940
As long as you just don't hit the level up button it doesn't count.

3440
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:09,320
Yeah.

3441
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:10,880
We just get to level 19 and we're fine.

3442
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:11,840
Yeah.

3443
01:59:18,990 --> 01:59:21,270
Shit don't worry Deidre I'm gonna save you.

3444
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:25,290
Oh he's dead.

3445
01:59:25,490 --> 01:59:27,050
Okay that's...sucks.

3446
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:31,250
Okay I got 21 pile balls.

3447
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:33,370
I need to bury the...

3448
01:59:33,370 --> 01:59:34,090
Bob.

3449
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:34,850
Catch some stuff.

3450
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:36,670
What is this?

3451
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:37,390
Oh hey there's...

3452
01:59:37,390 --> 01:59:38,570
Hey there's another tombat!

3453
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:40,010
Ayo!

3454
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:42,650
But we don't need it anyway so I'm just gonna release him.

3455
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:45,190
Yeah but I mean if you get the 10.

3456
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:47,030
That's true.

3457
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:54,020
Nice.

3458
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,440
Nice.

3459
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,800
I put my pile spurs in the base.

3460
01:59:58,920 --> 01:59:59,820
Get over here.

3461
02:00:00,620 --> 02:00:01,860
Get over here dire wolf.

3462
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:05,700
No please I don't wanna die because I'm still using my pickaxe as a weapon.

3463
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:09,300
No!

3464
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:11,660
Okay I'm just gonna leave.

3465
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:14,720
Get over here dire wolf.

3466
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:17,400
We're gonna leave.

3467
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:19,740
Where am I?

3468
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:22,340
Out.

3469
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:25,700
I should really start crafting a bow.

3470
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:28,460
Ow.

3471
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:29,400
I want to get a crossbow.

3472
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,960
Yeah I need a crossbow too.

3473
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:34,080
I have not been crafting.

3474
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:34,660
I need quite some ingots for those.

3475
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:38,080
I was scared to craft one I was like oh shit that's what an ingot costs?

3476
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:38,800
I was like ahhh.

3477
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,880
What the hell is happening to this spark?

3478
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,080
Alright.

3479
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:48,540
Let's see where am I?

3480
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:52,320
Yay it's almost day time!

3481
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,860
Hold up I need to steal butterpots.

3482
02:00:57,940 --> 02:00:59,160
Oh hey there's a toko toko!

3483
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:00,320
We needed those right?

3484
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:01,220
Oh nice we need that!

3485
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:02,240
Yeah we need 10 of them.

3486
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:02,960
Yeah okay.

3487
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:04,800
Ummm...

3488
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:11,440
Yeah now that we've almost got our base up to 12 we might as well like go towards the desert I think.

3489
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:13,520
Yeah there's one here on me.

3490
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:17,280
Should we start doing the bosses that we have to do together?

3491
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:18,160
Should we start doing the bosses that we have to do together?

3492
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:19,020
Uhhh...

3493
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:20,880
I don't think there's any bosses we have to do together.

3494
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:21,640
Oh.

3495
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:23,860
Just dungeons we have to do together.

3496
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:26,820
I don't know where they are though.

3497
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:28,860
Don't worry.

3498
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:30,160
Google where are they?

3499
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,860
They're like level 19 dungeons.

3500
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:33,780
God's got my back.

3501
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:37,970
Alright.

3502
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:39,350
How many tokos do we need?

3503
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:40,510
I forgot the thing.

3504
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:41,550
10 I think.

3505
02:01:41,730 --> 02:01:41,850
10?

3506
02:01:41,890 --> 02:01:42,250
Okay.

3507
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:43,870
I got one.

3508
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:45,450
Nice.

3509
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:49,270
Alright nice.

3510
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:50,410
We just need...

3511
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:50,990
Get over here.

3512
02:01:53,610 --> 02:01:54,390
Get over here.

3513
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:54,970
Don't blow up.

3514
02:01:54,990 --> 02:01:55,650
Don't blow up though.

3515
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:58,590
Don't blow up.

3516
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:00,910
Oh shit.

3517
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:03,170
No.

3518
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:03,950
Please.

3519
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:05,690
Nooooooo!

3520
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:07,170
Did you explode?

3521
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:08,350
I died!

3522
02:02:08,590 --> 02:02:09,010
No!

3523
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:10,230
I wanted to catch him!

3524
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:12,190
Guys I'm right... No!

3525
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:13,270
Not like this man.

3526
02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:13,330
Not like this.

3527
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:15,770
My first death!

3528
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:19,390
And then my wolf killed him.

3529
02:02:19,630 --> 02:02:20,770
First time huh?

3530
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:25,050
First time huh?

3531
02:02:27,190 --> 02:02:28,530
Don't worry young one.

3532
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:29,790
You'll get there.

3533
02:02:35,910 --> 02:02:36,510
Okay.

3534
02:02:36,650 --> 02:02:37,530
Alright nice.

3535
02:02:37,830 --> 02:02:39,070
Alright let's see.

3536
02:02:40,210 --> 02:02:41,410
Where did I die?

3537
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:42,690
Oh there it died.

3538
02:02:43,370 --> 02:02:44,870
I can't believe it.

3539
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:46,230
The bird on bird violence.

3540
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:50,660
Like here?

3541
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,380
Where the fuck did I die?

3542
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:54,320
Oh really close to the dungeon.

3543
02:02:58,690 --> 02:03:00,510
Did anybody take down Pen King yet?

3544
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:01,330
Nope.

3545
02:03:01,650 --> 02:03:02,970
Yeah so about that.

3546
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:04,630
He sort of killed him.

3547
02:03:05,590 --> 02:03:07,050
Yeah it's like the...

3548
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:08,130
It's not that he's hard.

3549
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:09,210
It's the other ones.

3550
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:12,550
My dire wolf kind of killed him while I was waiting to respawn.

3551
02:03:12,690 --> 02:03:12,730
Oh.

3552
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:13,790
Yeah.

3553
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,890
Just a little oopsie.

3554
02:03:18,310 --> 02:03:19,970
I mean doesn't that count though?

3555
02:03:20,070 --> 02:03:21,250
No it has to be capture.

3556
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:22,410
We have to catch them.

3557
02:03:22,410 --> 02:03:24,170
Oh okay okay.

3558
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:26,750
Should we start making...

3559
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:27,650
Once you have the...

3560
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:29,630
Well we've already got the palisphere wrench.

3561
02:03:29,710 --> 02:03:30,950
We can already start making gigasphere.

3562
02:03:31,330 --> 02:03:32,630
Or whatever the green ones are called.

3563
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:35,330
Alright.

3564
02:03:35,370 --> 02:03:36,510
We can make hyperspheres.

3565
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:38,790
I can at least.

3566
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:40,530
I think you're at the point where you can make hyperspheres.

3567
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:44,810
Alright I gotta go back and...

3568
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:46,190
See.

3569
02:03:46,570 --> 02:03:47,830
Oh there's a...

3570
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:48,830
I see more iron.

3571
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:50,030
Let's see.

3572
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:52,610
Where?

3573
02:03:52,610 --> 02:03:54,770
When do we unlock the secondary...

3574
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:56,970
Location?

3575
02:03:58,270 --> 02:03:58,670
Uhhh.

3576
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:00,710
We might have already actually.

3577
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:02,030
I don't know what level that unlocks at.

3578
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:03,370
The secondary base?

3579
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:06,650
We check right now.

3580
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:07,310
I'll go check.

3581
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:11,410
Wait where do we put our secondary base then?

3582
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:13,050
I think you unlock it at level 10.

3583
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:13,850
Yeah we have it.

3584
02:04:15,410 --> 02:04:17,130
Where do we want to put our second base though?

3585
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:18,610
I don't know you're the base expert.

3586
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:19,670
I think it's probably near the desert or something.

3587
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:22,110
Yeah desert sounds nice.

3588
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:24,370
Uhhh.

3589
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:26,530
Where the fuck did I put my own repair bench?

3590
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:27,230
There it is.

3591
02:04:28,750 --> 02:04:30,710
We can also make like a...

3592
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:31,550
Gun stuff.

3593
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:33,050
Ooooo.

3594
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:36,110
Where are the...

3595
02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:37,050
Oh.

3596
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:38,970
That's not it.

3597
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:42,370
Oh my god there's so many benches.

3598
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:43,990
Which is the bench I need.

3599
02:04:46,150 --> 02:04:47,250
There's too many.

3600
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:48,410
Too much benches.

3601
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:51,350
I need...

3602
02:04:51,350 --> 02:04:53,270
I need this and your repair my armor.

3603
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:54,750
Ah.

3604
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:57,730
Okay.

3605
02:05:00,290 --> 02:05:01,170
Let's see.

3606
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:10,320
Grab a little bit of that.

3607
02:05:14,210 --> 02:05:15,670
Let's see what do I need.

3608
02:05:17,190 --> 02:05:18,070
What was I doing?

3609
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:18,730
Sweeper.

3610
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:19,490
Sweep attack.

3611
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:23,550
I need to get that sweeper.

3612
02:05:24,710 --> 02:05:25,670
Sweep sweep sweep.

3613
02:05:26,050 --> 02:05:26,650
Sweep sweep sweep.

3614
02:05:26,890 --> 02:05:28,690
Is this sweeper like the most powerful?

3615
02:05:29,410 --> 02:05:31,330
Fifteen seconds detention for you.

3616
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:33,930
Okay why do you actually sound like that guy though?

3617
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:34,890
This is kind of bothering me.

3618
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:36,850
Oh Baldi?

3619
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:39,330
No no you sound like the principal.

3620
02:05:40,370 --> 02:05:41,410
I am the principal.

3621
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:42,870
He is the principal.

3622
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:43,690
He is the law.

3623
02:05:44,450 --> 02:05:44,890
Dang.

3624
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:47,510
D'oh.

3625
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:49,050
Alright.

3626
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:49,990
I'm heading over.

3627
02:05:51,770 --> 02:05:53,150
Sorry about all the stuff I did.

3628
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:53,990
Please don't call my mom.

3629
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:58,010
Sorry I said balls like fourteen.

3630
02:05:58,470 --> 02:05:59,450
Now fifteen times.

3631
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:00,650
I had fun.

3632
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:02,210
Come back again.

3633
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:03,170
Sometimes.

3634
02:06:03,410 --> 02:06:05,090
Level 23 bushy.

3635
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:07,630
I'm bushy.

3636
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:09,730
Where the fuck?

3637
02:06:09,850 --> 02:06:10,910
How do I get across?

3638
02:06:12,370 --> 02:06:13,030
Legally.

3639
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:15,710
There it is.

3640
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:19,010
I'm almost there.

3641
02:06:19,330 --> 02:06:20,470
God they're so fast.

3642
02:06:20,750 --> 02:06:21,690
Stop running.

3643
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:23,750
Perish.

3644
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:27,230
No.

3645
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:28,890
Let me climb.

3646
02:06:30,170 --> 02:06:31,690
Please don't let me drown.

3647
02:06:33,890 --> 02:06:34,430
Okay.

3648
02:06:35,850 --> 02:06:37,210
We're almost up top.

3649
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:39,730
Balls check?

3650
02:06:39,950 --> 02:06:41,110
Don't worry I checked my balls.

3651
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:43,630
Balls have been checked.

3652
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:44,770
Balls have been checked.

3653
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:45,930
No lumps.

3654
02:06:48,110 --> 02:06:49,370
We're checking balls yes.

3655
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:51,250
Bushy and bio yes.

3656
02:06:54,430 --> 02:06:56,030
Why is there a lot of balls?

3657
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:57,230
I got a full grown man in my balls.

3658
02:06:57,950 --> 02:06:58,430
Woah.

3659
02:06:59,510 --> 02:07:00,630
He's just cross checking.

3660
02:07:01,090 --> 02:07:02,970
Thank god you checked those balls.

3661
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:05,910
I mean it's part of the global achievement though.

3662
02:07:06,070 --> 02:07:07,830
You gotta catch like five guys so.

3663
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:09,930
Oh wait.

3664
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:10,810
That's a level 31.

3665
02:07:11,150 --> 02:07:13,070
Getting that killed.

3666
02:07:14,970 --> 02:07:16,250
How many hours do we have left?

3667
02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:17,210
I haven't been paying attention.

3668
02:07:17,790 --> 02:07:18,510
Me either.

3669
02:07:19,410 --> 02:07:20,050
Two and a half.

3670
02:07:21,010 --> 02:07:21,970
Oh no.

3671
02:07:22,530 --> 02:07:23,730
Tom Bat's falling ill.

3672
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:25,070
Take him out the back.

3673
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:26,370
That's cool.

3674
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:27,670
Let's go.

3675
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:28,970
I have no more arrows.

3676
02:07:29,630 --> 02:07:30,310
Oh no.

3677
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:35,050
Wait do I have enough stuff to make arrows right now?

3678
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:35,650
I'll make arrows.

3679
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:38,290
I just need one arrow to get him out of the sky.

3680
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:38,950
That's it.

3681
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:40,730
I need one wood.

3682
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:45,350
Grab that waypoint.

3683
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:48,390
Oh hey there's an effigy here.

3684
02:07:50,070 --> 02:07:52,090
I know we get points for effigies too.

3685
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:52,970
For the global right?

3686
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:55,590
Yes.

3687
02:07:57,210 --> 02:07:59,670
Once you get a flying pal it's really easy to do.

3688
02:08:00,070 --> 02:08:01,390
Especially at night.

3689
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:02,350
Yeah.

3690
02:08:08,930 --> 02:08:09,830
Get over here.

3691
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:11,630
Get over your waypoint.

3692
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:17,950
What the heck?

3693
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:20,890
What's going on Lily?

3694
02:08:21,070 --> 02:08:21,790
What are you doing?

3695
02:08:22,190 --> 02:08:24,390
I'm trying to deal with the pig.

3696
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:25,690
The what?

3697
02:08:27,150 --> 02:08:29,010
I'm battling the pig always.

3698
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:30,070
At all times.

3699
02:08:30,970 --> 02:08:33,110
Is it even a boss?

3700
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:35,330
No it's not.

3701
02:08:35,370 --> 02:08:36,470
It's just the right wing.

3702
02:08:36,650 --> 02:08:37,270
The ping.

3703
02:08:37,490 --> 02:08:39,010
The ping?

3704
02:08:39,410 --> 02:08:40,950
I thought you said pig.

3705
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:42,110
I was like what?

3706
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:46,770
Every time I dodge I'm like...

3707
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:47,670
Oh I'm out.

3708
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:49,590
I'm like no way.

3709
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:52,090
Legendary difficulty ping boss.

3710
02:08:52,550 --> 02:08:54,230
Alright go kill this sweeper.

3711
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:55,450
Go down.

3712
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:58,750
I only have a pickaxe.

3713
02:08:58,850 --> 02:09:00,190
So I'm not helpful.

3714
02:09:03,390 --> 02:09:04,710
No not the babies!

3715
02:09:06,290 --> 02:09:06,810
No not the babies!

3716
02:09:06,810 --> 02:09:07,830
We don't care about the babies!

3717
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:08,450
We don't care about the babies!

3718
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:08,470
No!

3719
02:09:08,990 --> 02:09:10,750
Oh god I might actually die.

3720
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:16,470
It's okay my direwolf is okay.

3721
02:09:16,590 --> 02:09:17,190
I leveled up.

3722
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:18,990
It's okay.

3723
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:21,070
It's like dark souls dodging.

3724
02:09:21,210 --> 02:09:21,570
Two more balls.

3725
02:09:22,010 --> 02:09:24,470
Then I have to farm some ball materials.

3726
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:26,510
It's always balls.

3727
02:09:26,910 --> 02:09:28,510
Always balls.

3728
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:31,370
What am I gonna do with all these balls?

3729
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:32,530
No way.

3730
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:34,930
That's not worth it.

3731
02:09:35,010 --> 02:09:35,810
I'm not running after him.

3732
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:39,570
Come on direwolf.

3733
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:39,890
Nice.

3734
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:41,910
Oh no he's hungry.

3735
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:43,530
I just have to dodge earlier.

3736
02:09:45,210 --> 02:09:45,690
Yeah.

3737
02:09:46,430 --> 02:09:48,350
You have to think into the future.

3738
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:49,510
Yeah exactly.

3739
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:49,930
Yeah yeah.

3740
02:09:50,190 --> 02:09:51,450
Everything a little early.

3741
02:09:51,670 --> 02:09:53,050
Just think 200 ping in advance.

3742
02:09:53,050 --> 02:09:53,210
I'm gonna be more convinced.

3743
02:09:53,610 --> 02:09:57,590
Oh no my pal team is hungry.

3744
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:58,010
Okay I'm almost level 18.

3745
02:10:01,150 --> 02:10:03,810
Yeah the fastest way to level up in this game is just to catch pals.

3746
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:05,590
Like literally just spam catch pals.

3747
02:10:06,150 --> 02:10:06,670
Don't worry.

3748
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:08,490
I'm out of balls.

3749
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:09,470
I have one ball left.

3750
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:11,470
Give me that sweeper!

3751
02:10:14,670 --> 02:10:17,070
I shall harvest balls.

3752
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:19,830
So proud of you.

3753
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:20,890
Nice.

3754
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:25,430
I missed.

3755
02:10:25,570 --> 02:10:25,730
Nice!

3756
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:27,670
Clip clip I got them!

3757
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:29,410
Okay but don't clip the dick part.

3758
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:31,030
Clip it!

3759
02:10:33,670 --> 02:10:34,710
Clip this guy!

3760
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:36,530
The sweeper though!

3761
02:10:36,810 --> 02:10:38,450
I grabbed the sweeper.

3762
02:10:39,110 --> 02:10:39,590
Win!

3763
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:42,770
Nice.

3764
02:10:42,850 --> 02:10:43,490
We did it.

3765
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:46,350
I'm gonna feed my fucking wolf.

3766
02:10:48,110 --> 02:10:48,910
Alright nice.

3767
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:51,310
Where is this?

3768
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:52,050
Oh my god.

3769
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:54,210
Alright guys.

3770
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:55,670
I got the sweeper.

3771
02:10:56,070 --> 02:10:57,690
Another boss down.

3772
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:59,090
Let's go!

3773
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:01,490
I'm so freaking proud of you.

3774
02:11:01,610 --> 02:11:02,190
Oh my god.

3775
02:11:02,310 --> 02:11:03,230
You're so great.

3776
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:06,650
Do you have a...

3777
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:07,290
Do you...

3778
02:11:07,290 --> 02:11:09,810
Surefour how many bosses have you caught yet now?

3779
02:11:10,150 --> 02:11:10,910
I've killed one.

3780
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:16,430
Why is this cat attacking?

3781
02:11:20,460 --> 02:11:21,100
Jesus.

3782
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:21,480
Jesus.

3783
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:24,740
Nice.

3784
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,700
Who's next after sweeper?

3785
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:32,860
Who's next after sweeper?

3786
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:34,940
What do I have to catch next?

3787
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,280
The Goombas.

3788
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,240
Okay where is Goombas?

3789
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:40,440
Goombas where?

3790
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:48,350
Where is this?

3791
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:49,450
Come on get in the boat!

3792
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:51,030
Nice!

3793
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:52,430
Nice guys.

3794
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:55,350
Nice we're doing it.

3795
02:11:56,090 --> 02:11:58,090
Where the fuck is the Goombas boss?

3796
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:00,990
Where is it?

3797
02:12:00,990 --> 02:12:01,870
This is not helpful.

3798
02:12:01,890 --> 02:12:02,570
I know you should get that checked though.

3799
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:02,890
I don't know.

3800
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:07,830
Goombas pow world boss location.

3801
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:13,910
What?

3802
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:16,510
What the fuck is it?

3803
02:12:18,370 --> 02:12:18,990
I don't know.

3804
02:12:20,290 --> 02:12:21,130
I don't know.

3805
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:22,390
I don't know.

3806
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:23,030
I don't know.

3807
02:12:23,070 --> 02:12:23,210
I don't know.

3808
02:12:23,850 --> 02:12:24,050
I don't know.

3809
02:12:24,050 --> 02:12:25,790
I'm gonna steal some of that.

3810
02:12:25,990 --> 02:12:26,690
Boom 17.

3811
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:27,850
I need some more balls.

3812
02:12:29,970 --> 02:12:30,610
What the heck?

3813
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:31,830
We all need balls don't we?

3814
02:12:33,490 --> 02:12:33,930
Yeah.

3815
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:35,930
I'm gonna steal all the balls.

3816
02:12:38,850 --> 02:12:39,530
Let's see.

3817
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:41,750
Uh...

3818
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:43,190
Oh I need to put away this.

3819
02:12:43,610 --> 02:12:44,610
Oh yeah.

3820
02:12:44,730 --> 02:12:46,890
I put some ancient civilization parts away.

3821
02:12:47,370 --> 02:12:49,390
Is there anything we need to make in ancient civilization?

3822
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:52,270
No right?

3823
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:52,670
No right?

3824
02:12:54,050 --> 02:12:54,430
Uh...

3825
02:12:55,110 --> 02:12:56,090
There will be.

3826
02:12:57,370 --> 02:12:58,710
But not right now.

3827
02:12:58,870 --> 02:12:59,350
Not right now.

3828
02:12:59,430 --> 02:12:59,650
Okay.

3829
02:12:59,850 --> 02:13:03,990
We can also make more incubators for the leftover eggs.

3830
02:13:04,110 --> 02:13:05,590
And then just tear them down after.

3831
02:13:05,690 --> 02:13:07,930
Yeah if we can make a second incubator that would be pretty good.

3832
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:08,030
Yeah we can make it.

3833
02:13:08,830 --> 02:13:10,390
Don't worry I'll make it now.

3834
02:13:10,570 --> 02:13:12,330
We need cloth and stone.

3835
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:15,030
Can someone get that for us?

3836
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:15,870
Yep.

3837
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:18,050
I can get more.

3838
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:20,610
I'm in the first area so I can get more lamb.

3839
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:21,510
What is happening?

3840
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:29,510
We're on our way to get $500.

3841
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:32,770
Guys we already have $500.

3842
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:34,550
We're in last place right now.

3843
02:13:34,670 --> 02:13:36,370
We already have $500.

3844
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:38,170
Shit man.

3845
02:13:39,850 --> 02:13:40,750
That's amazing.

3846
02:13:44,270 --> 02:13:44,870
Yeah.

3847
02:13:45,070 --> 02:13:46,190
Let me grab this.

3848
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:51,070
I can't click this stupid word bench.

3849
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:52,070
Oh my goodness.

3850
02:13:52,310 --> 02:13:53,030
Let me craft.

3851
02:13:53,410 --> 02:13:54,030
I can't click this stupid word bench.

3852
02:13:54,050 --> 02:13:55,290
Yeah you'll be fine.

3853
02:13:55,410 --> 02:13:57,850
Guys we're sort of 15th place right now.

3854
02:13:58,190 --> 02:13:58,790
No.

3855
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:02,190
We're 16 teams right?

3856
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:02,630
Guys.

3857
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:03,870
We're not last.

3858
02:14:03,910 --> 02:14:08,790
Guys these things we can do it so fucking fast.

3859
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:09,570
I'm just saying.

3860
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,220
Let's see.

3861
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:23,280
Put stone away.

3862
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:24,560
Okay.

3863
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:27,140
Oh we just got last place apparently.

3864
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:28,660
Oh.

3865
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,000
Shit.

3866
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:32,040
No way.

3867
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,040
Guys don't worry.

3868
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:40,180
I can speed run all these bosses and then we're gonna get out of it.

3869
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:41,140
It's tortoise and the hare baby.

3870
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:41,940
Tortoise and the hare.

3871
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:43,040
We'll be fine.

3872
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:46,960
Because all we need is to catch up a bit.

3873
02:14:47,020 --> 02:14:47,140
Yeah.

3874
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:50,540
We're just trying to kill Mamo right now.

3875
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:56,740
Alright I'm level 19 now.

3876
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:57,360
I'm coming back to base.

3877
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:00,680
Wait team must capture?

3878
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,820
Does that mean all of us must have 10?

3879
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
We all have to catch up.

3880
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,720
Oh we can just drop pals.

3881
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:08,760
It says dropping pals.

3882
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:09,820
Oh my god what happened to the base?

3883
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,100
Wait does it mean like the...

3884
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:13,740
Alright we're level 12 base now.

3885
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:14,520
Nice.

3886
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:16,260
Clip it!

3887
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:16,740
Clip it!

3888
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:17,880
Clip it!

3889
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:18,160
Clip it!

3890
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:19,860
Clip it!

3891
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:20,880
Clip that!

3892
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:24,340
What a really boring...

3893
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:26,220
Oh we're level 12 base now.

3894
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:27,020
Clip it!

3895
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:27,900
Clip it!

3896
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:28,400
Clip it!

3897
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,080
That's cool.

3898
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:34,520
Okay what do I need to do?

3899
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:36,000
Wait I need to build an incubator.

3900
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:37,120
Guys I still need stone.

3901
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:40,240
Wait who the fuck used up all the stone that I just put away?

3902
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:43,480
Large Pelved.

3903
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:46,480
Who used all the stone that I literally just got for us?

3904
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:47,100
Wait what?

3905
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:52,340
I literally put in like 18 stone now there's zero.

3906
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:55,540
Where the fuck are you going mother fucker?

3907
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:02,520
Oh fluffy Pelved.

3908
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:03,320
Last players game.

3909
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:04,960
No we're playing the long game.

3910
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:06,180
We're playing the long game.

3911
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:06,740
We have a plan.

3912
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:10,300
If we want to upgrade to level 13.

3913
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:12,660
How do I get him to work?

3914
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:14,540
How do I get him to work?

3915
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:15,100
How do I get him to work?

3916
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:20,080
If you can make us the fluffy Pelved.

3917
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:20,840
Two of them.

3918
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:21,420
Then we can get the...

3919
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:23,400
Then we can be level 13.

3920
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:25,440
I'm making the egg incubator.

3921
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:26,320
That's literally all we need.

3922
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:28,980
Alright it's a level 24 recipe.

3923
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:32,340
It's the plan to be last place.

3924
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:32,820
What am I making?

3925
02:16:32,820 --> 02:16:34,720
Make two fluffy Pelveds.

3926
02:16:36,060 --> 02:16:36,580
Alright.

3927
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:39,740
We got a Nox right now.

3928
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:41,760
I'm making the other egg incubator.

3929
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:45,500
We need more cloth and then I can make it.

3930
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:46,940
I'm gonna try and find a...

3931
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:47,600
moss.

3932
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:48,660
Oh.

3933
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:55,120
We can make like 139 cloth.

3934
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:55,840
So.

3935
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:58,000
Do it now.

3936
02:16:58,320 --> 02:16:59,500
Do it now.

3937
02:17:01,220 --> 02:17:02,400
What do I want to do?

3938
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:03,800
I already forgot what I was...

3939
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:04,000
Oh yeah.

3940
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:04,440
Gumas.

3941
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:05,600
Where the fuck is Gumas?

3942
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,520
Still trying to figure out where he is.

3943
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:10,660
Boss map.

3944
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:12,580
Pal world boss map.

3945
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:14,180
All alpha boss locations.

3946
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:15,700
Oh wait.

3947
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:16,680
Just the alpha boss?

3948
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:17,700
Finally bro.

3949
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:20,520
Alright Anubis.

3950
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:21,300
Gumas.

3951
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:22,000
Where are you?

3952
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:23,720
Gumas.

3953
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:25,240
Warsec.

3954
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:26,840
Elizabete.

3955
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:27,980
No I need Gumas.

3956
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:30,880
I'll go get a lock.

3957
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:32,920
Okay Gumas is right here.

3958
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:34,540
Okay I figured it out.

3959
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:36,460
Alright I'm gonna head over.

3960
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:40,460
He's like right here somewhere.

3961
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:41,480
Achievement list.

3962
02:17:43,060 --> 02:17:43,620
Uh.

3963
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:49,400
Doomit?

3964
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:50,320
What's Doomit?

3965
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:52,280
What's Doomit?

3966
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:54,900
I don't even know what these bosses are.

3967
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:56,200
Dummit?

3968
02:17:56,580 --> 02:17:57,480
Oh it's like.

3969
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:58,300
I love him.

3970
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:01,000
He's like this cool dumb looking fish dude.

3971
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:02,060
Oh my god.

3972
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:03,720
He's so stupid looking.

3973
02:18:03,740 --> 02:18:04,560
I think I know what you're talking about.

3974
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:04,800
Yeah.

3975
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:06,760
It's like the Quagsire guy right?

3976
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:08,160
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

3977
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:08,940
The Quagsire.

3978
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,880
The moment you said the dumb looking fish guy I'm like quite excited.

3979
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:12,720
Yeah oh my god.

3980
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:14,440
He looks like he has no brain cells.

3981
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:16,160
You're not wrong though.

3982
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:18,980
Where is Dummit?

3983
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:19,620
Let's see.

3984
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:21,840
He's the dented fish.

3985
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:24,080
Derp fish.

3986
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:28,020
I'm gonna crash these guys right now.

3987
02:18:28,060 --> 02:18:29,220
Yeah I can probably take down the Dummit.

3988
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:31,200
I just need to figure out where he is.

3989
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,000
He's on the eastern islands I feel like.

3990
02:18:34,140 --> 02:18:34,540
No?

3991
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:35,520
No.

3992
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:36,760
Why are they fighting?

3993
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:38,440
Oh my god.

3994
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:39,700
Ooh this little Joltik.

3995
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:41,200
I wanna join into this fight.

3996
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:41,820
No!

3997
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:43,360
Oh wait he's still alive.

3998
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:45,440
Oh he's on the Icewind Islands?

3999
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:45,960
Really?

4000
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:48,620
That's really far.

4001
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:49,500
Oh boy.

4002
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:52,820
Uh okay.

4003
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:54,940
Alright well.

4004
02:18:58,360 --> 02:18:58,820
Alright.

4005
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:00,800
Alright.

4006
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:01,620
Alright we've done Chillit.

4007
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:02,820
We've done Pen King.

4008
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,540
Well we haven't done Pen King.

4009
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:07,780
Oh we haven't done Pen King.

4010
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:09,740
Wait what are you doing right now?

4011
02:19:09,860 --> 02:19:10,800
I didn't know.

4012
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:12,480
What are you doing right now?

4013
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,080
Power leveling.

4014
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:15,200
Oh okay.

4015
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:18,700
We have to stop eventually right?

4016
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:21,580
I mean how many hours we got left?

4017
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:22,760
Two?

4018
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:24,160
Two hours?

4019
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:25,280
Yeah.

4020
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:25,880
Alright.

4021
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:28,060
When are you gonna start capturing?

4022
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:29,200
True.

4023
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:32,760
Yeah but when are you gonna start capturing?

4024
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:34,900
You're doing great.

4025
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:36,520
I got two only!

4026
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:37,440
What do you mean?

4027
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:39,540
You're doing fantastic.

4028
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:41,980
I'm gonna make some balls.

4029
02:19:43,560 --> 02:19:45,140
I'm trying to find Umas.

4030
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:48,420
He's like right here somewhere.

4031
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:49,240
Oh there he is.

4032
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:50,480
Alright here I go.

4033
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:51,980
Capturing Gumas.

4034
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:56,820
Yeah we're just leveling enough to just kill the bosses back to back.

4035
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:57,140
Yeah exactly.

4036
02:19:58,060 --> 02:19:59,320
I forgot to...

4037
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:00,820
See that's what I'm saying.

4038
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:01,800
It's tortoise and the hare.

4039
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:02,120
Exactly.

4040
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:03,740
We've been taking our time getting everything ready.

4041
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:05,100
Yes!

4042
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:07,160
Alright he's over here.

4043
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:07,940
Like this is organized.

4044
02:20:08,980 --> 02:20:10,700
Just gonna use him.

4045
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:13,220
Oh.

4046
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:13,960
Oh.

4047
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:18,700
We have base management.

4048
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:19,860
I get the materials.

4049
02:20:20,140 --> 02:20:20,700
Yeah.

4050
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:22,380
We have boss killing.

4051
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:22,820
Exactly.

4052
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:23,900
There you go.

4053
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:25,420
I found my purpose.

4054
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:27,580
I have been defeated by the like.

4055
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:28,420
I'm just...

4056
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:30,880
I'm downgraded to material fetcher.

4057
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:34,560
You know your purpose.

4058
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:35,480
You know it.

4059
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:37,540
I have found my purpose.

4060
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:39,900
There were organized chaos right here.

4061
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:41,380
Guys clip it!

4062
02:20:41,380 --> 02:20:42,020
I got Gumas!

4063
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:43,200
Clip clip!

4064
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:43,880
Gumas!

4065
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:45,180
Gumas!

4066
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:48,500
And I caught this random fish.

4067
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:51,600
Yeah I'm doing my part.

4068
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:52,340
What can I say?

4069
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:53,680
We're doing our part.

4070
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:56,520
We're doing it.

4071
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:00,180
We got Gumas!

4072
02:21:00,460 --> 02:21:01,520
Another 10 points!

4073
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:03,480
We can't be last!

4074
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:06,880
I have become one of the pals!

4075
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:07,620
No way!

4076
02:21:07,860 --> 02:21:08,580
No way!

4077
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,880
We got another 10!

4078
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:11,300
10 on the board!

4079
02:21:13,320 --> 02:21:14,180
We got a...

4080
02:21:15,580 --> 02:21:16,700
Victory Royale!

4081
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,900
Fortnite about to get down.

4082
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:19,800
Get down!

4083
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:23,000
Wait are you doing Dumont right now?

4084
02:21:25,020 --> 02:21:26,360
PP are you doing Dumont?

4085
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:28,500
PP!

4086
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:29,120
I'm not.

4087
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:30,800
Okay okay I'll get Dumont then.

4088
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:31,760
Alright.

4089
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:33,240
I was gonna get a...

4090
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:33,960
What's his name?

4091
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:34,940
I do the higher level bosses.

4092
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:36,200
You do the mediums then.

4093
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:39,040
The mediums are like Beacon and...

4094
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:41,540
Aqua, Patalia...

4095
02:21:43,220 --> 02:21:45,100
Okay where the fuck is...

4096
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:46,460
I need to make a shield.

4097
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:50,880
Dumont, Power, Alpha boss.

4098
02:21:51,380 --> 02:21:51,980
I'm like too reckless.

4099
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:55,380
I just fell through the map.

4100
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:57,680
And I'm in the water.

4101
02:21:57,960 --> 02:21:58,800
And I'm dead.

4102
02:21:58,800 --> 02:21:59,440
And I'm dead.

4103
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:03,360
Oh jeez!

4104
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,820
Oh what came out of that egg?

4105
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,440
Oh a Nox.

4106
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:08,740
Oh nice.

4107
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:09,700
Yeah.

4108
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:10,820
Do we need to use it?

4109
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:14,140
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh What the heck?

4110
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:14,820
Nah.

4111
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:16,540
Where the fuck is...

4112
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:18,180
Where the fuck is Dumont?

4113
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:20,840
Where is he?

4114
02:22:22,140 --> 02:22:23,580
Where is he?

4115
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:24,900
Don't know.

4116
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:27,580
Dumont.

4117
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:28,200
Power.

4118
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:31,120
I'm gonna make a shield.

4119
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:36,140
Pull up your map YouTube video.

4120
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:40,460
Where is he?

4121
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:47,400
Okay.

4122
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,000
Ow.

4123
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:48,360
I'm gonna make a shield.

4124
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:49,580
Boss.

4125
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:50,540
Yeah I have no balls.

4126
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:51,220
I couldn't catch it.

4127
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:54,340
Don't say that about yourself.

4128
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:56,980
You value outside of your balls.

4129
02:22:58,980 --> 02:23:00,340
Balls are all I had Matt.

4130
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:01,180
I just need you to know.

4131
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:01,460
No.

4132
02:23:01,460 --> 02:23:01,860
No.

4133
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:03,400
You're so much more than that.

4134
02:23:03,660 --> 02:23:04,900
You're so much more.

4135
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:05,920
You're so much more.

4136
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:07,680
You're so much more than just balls.

4137
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:08,920
Guys.

4138
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:11,060
Tell me where the fuck is Dumont.

4139
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:14,080
You're so much more than just balls.

4140
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:15,240
I can't fight him.

4141
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:16,320
I can't fight him.

4142
02:23:18,940 --> 02:23:20,340
He's kind of far.

4143
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:21,500
Where are you right now?

4144
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:23,400
I don't fucking know where I am.

4145
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:25,160
He's like past the bamboo groves.

4146
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:27,000
Oh he's past the bamboo.

4147
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:28,140
I'm not fucking catching that.

4148
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:30,900
Alright I'm just gonna go for Pen King then.

4149
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:33,460
There's another guy on this lake in the middle of the ocean though.

4150
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:35,220
Pen King is on a respawn timer right now.

4151
02:23:35,420 --> 02:23:36,100
Oh still?

4152
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:37,760
Probably.

4153
02:23:38,620 --> 02:23:39,180
Grintel.

4154
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:42,400
Grintel location.

4155
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:48,760
He's a lagger.

4156
02:23:49,180 --> 02:23:50,940
I'm just material boy.

4157
02:23:51,820 --> 02:23:53,880
It's better this way.

4158
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:56,120
I can't even fly a freaking pile man.

4159
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:57,560
I can't even fly a freaking pile man.

4160
02:23:57,560 --> 02:23:57,720
Bruh.

4161
02:23:58,020 --> 02:23:59,040
I figured out where he is.

4162
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:03,800
Oh god that Lunaris is level 32.

4163
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:04,800
Maybe not.

4164
02:24:07,220 --> 02:24:08,700
Don't worry we won't forget.

4165
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:10,700
We can take the photo anytime.

4166
02:24:14,700 --> 02:24:16,660
We can take it anytime guys.

4167
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:17,660
Do not worry.

4168
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:20,160
I'm not worrying.

4169
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:24,140
See everybody is worrying that we're not doing the baby things right now.

4170
02:24:24,260 --> 02:24:25,180
Like we're doing the hard work.

4171
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:26,880
Yeah we're playing the long game.

4172
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,200
No one is believing us.

4173
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:30,760
The base level was like...

4174
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:33,500
I don't know how many points but seems like a lot of points.

4175
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:36,340
Oh my god.

4176
02:24:36,340 --> 02:24:37,340
I got the chillit already right?

4177
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:38,240
I got the chillit.

4178
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:40,540
Oh my god that was way too many.

4179
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:43,360
I'm just gonna make a storage right here.

4180
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:44,980
I don't feel like walking all the way back.

4181
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:46,460
You made too many wood.

4182
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:50,960
No there's like so much wood that I immediately became over encumbered.

4183
02:24:50,980 --> 02:24:51,600
It's like a thousand.

4184
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:53,300
Woof.

4185
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:54,460
Okay I'll put this back here.

4186
02:24:56,660 --> 02:24:57,220
It's alright.

4187
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:59,240
Guys you're supposed to believe in us.

4188
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:00,320
Like you said not aesthetics.

4189
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:07,280
I'm just gonna catch these random pals for levels.

4190
02:25:11,430 --> 02:25:12,510
Like I can literally...

4191
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:14,890
I'm almost close to a level 30 chicken guys.

4192
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:15,810
Believe in us.

4193
02:25:16,030 --> 02:25:16,550
Let's go.

4194
02:25:17,350 --> 02:25:18,570
Well I mean you have to be...

4195
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:21,170
I'm so close.

4196
02:25:22,710 --> 02:25:25,770
Holy shit do we have no pals that are picking stuff up?

4197
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:26,830
Oh my god.

4198
02:25:27,010 --> 02:25:28,310
I'm not in charge of bases.

4199
02:25:28,510 --> 02:25:30,610
That stuff really works.

4200
02:25:31,430 --> 02:25:32,610
Yeah it's terrible.

4201
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:34,490
We also have like two of them.

4202
02:25:34,530 --> 02:25:38,550
We have the Lizmonk and Vixie just stuck downstairs the whole time.

4203
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:38,630
Yeah.

4204
02:25:39,330 --> 02:25:40,790
I think it's this way.

4205
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:44,250
I'm looking at the map to make sure where the fuck this place is.

4206
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:49,690
Where am I?

4207
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:51,210
Oh my god.

4208
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:51,690
I need...

4209
02:25:51,690 --> 02:25:53,570
Fox tell me where I am.

4210
02:25:55,990 --> 02:25:56,890
Help me.

4211
02:25:57,170 --> 02:25:57,510
Help me.

4212
02:26:01,590 --> 02:26:03,750
How much high quality pal oil you got?

4213
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:05,510
Uh...

4214
02:26:06,650 --> 02:26:07,890
Only regular pal fluids.

4215
02:26:08,990 --> 02:26:10,270
Dammit drops it I think.

4216
02:26:10,290 --> 02:26:11,430
Selene might have some...

4217
02:26:11,430 --> 02:26:12,090
Fuck me.

4218
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:15,630
I need some pal fluids.

4219
02:26:15,630 --> 02:26:15,730
I need some pal fluids.

4220
02:26:16,210 --> 02:26:17,690
I need some pal fluids.

4221
02:26:17,690 --> 02:26:20,970
I need some pal fluids.

4222
02:26:20,970 --> 02:26:23,710
Okay what do you need me for?

4223
02:26:23,710 --> 02:26:24,730
High quality pal oil.

4224
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:29,770
I have pal fluids.

4225
02:26:30,090 --> 02:26:31,150
Is that what you need?

4226
02:26:31,770 --> 02:26:33,230
I need high quality pal oil.

4227
02:26:33,530 --> 02:26:34,150
I need high quality pal oil.

4228
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:35,570
High quality pal oil.

4229
02:26:36,110 --> 02:26:36,350
Yeah.

4230
02:26:36,450 --> 02:26:37,750
No I don't have any.

4231
02:26:38,490 --> 02:26:38,590
Okay.

4232
02:26:40,350 --> 02:26:40,970
Okay.

4233
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:42,090
Don't worry.

4234
02:26:42,370 --> 02:26:43,670
You'll get there.

4235
02:26:44,150 --> 02:26:44,970
Yeah we'll get there.

4236
02:26:47,470 --> 02:26:50,830
It's like when I had to keep calling Cassidy McCree.

4237
02:26:51,210 --> 02:26:52,530
McCree Cassie.

4238
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:54,670
I believe in you.

4239
02:26:57,890 --> 02:26:58,510
Okay.

4240
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:00,650
Uh...

4241
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:04,990
Where is this guy?

4242
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:07,570
Which bosses are you guys going after right now?

4243
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:08,330
I'm going for...

4244
02:27:09,270 --> 02:27:10,390
Where is this guy?

4245
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:13,230
Grintail.

4246
02:27:14,430 --> 02:27:14,910
Okay.

4247
02:27:15,770 --> 02:27:18,390
Oh he drops high quality pal oil too.

4248
02:27:18,530 --> 02:27:18,790
Does he?

4249
02:27:19,010 --> 02:27:19,470
Grintail?

4250
02:27:19,630 --> 02:27:20,470
Yeah yeah yeah.

4251
02:27:20,890 --> 02:27:22,690
I think I might be able to just buy some.

4252
02:27:23,150 --> 02:27:24,650
Am I going the right way?

4253
02:27:25,430 --> 02:27:26,530
I can't tell.

4254
02:27:27,330 --> 02:27:29,290
I'm just swimming in it.

4255
02:27:29,330 --> 02:27:29,510
Okay cool.

4256
02:27:31,130 --> 02:27:32,530
Guys am I going the right way?

4257
02:27:32,670 --> 02:27:34,450
I'm just riding in the ocean.

4258
02:27:40,030 --> 02:27:40,530
Oh shit.

4259
02:27:40,590 --> 02:27:42,610
Oh shit my dire wolf is dying!

4260
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:43,410
Oh fuck!

4261
02:27:43,730 --> 02:27:44,170
No!

4262
02:27:44,430 --> 02:27:44,910
Oh shit.

4263
02:27:46,670 --> 02:27:47,670
Oh shit.

4264
02:27:48,430 --> 02:27:48,930
Okay.

4265
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:51,130
Hey can you stop not being caught?

4266
02:27:53,090 --> 02:27:54,550
My dire wolf is dead.

4267
02:27:54,570 --> 02:27:55,210
My ass.

4268
02:27:58,210 --> 02:27:59,550
Yeah you have to farm it.

4269
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:00,190
You can't buy it.

4270
02:28:00,350 --> 02:28:03,150
No I'm pretty sure you can buy it from one area.

4271
02:28:03,570 --> 02:28:03,790
Oh.

4272
02:28:05,930 --> 02:28:06,430
Um.

4273
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:06,690
Okay.

4274
02:28:06,890 --> 02:28:07,610
Nobody's done...

4275
02:28:07,830 --> 02:28:08,050
I'm gonna buy some armor.

4276
02:28:08,690 --> 02:28:09,450
Azurobe right?

4277
02:28:09,610 --> 02:28:10,610
I'll do Azurobe.

4278
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:13,250
Guys I might die in the water.

4279
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:15,310
That's not good.

4280
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:17,710
That's called drowning.

4281
02:28:17,970 --> 02:28:18,770
I might drown.

4282
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:19,710
It's got a special name.

4283
02:28:21,030 --> 02:28:23,230
Just one big slurry.

4284
02:28:24,690 --> 02:28:25,510
There's an island.

4285
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:27,070
There's an island right there.

4286
02:28:27,310 --> 02:28:28,350
Keep swimming!

4287
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:30,570
Keep swimming!

4288
02:28:30,790 --> 02:28:33,590
If you die in the water does that make the price go up?

4289
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:34,510
For like the gamer girl?

4290
02:28:34,570 --> 02:28:36,230
Well it's the ocean.

4291
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:38,930
It's the looted.

4292
02:28:39,010 --> 02:28:39,490
Please!

4293
02:28:39,690 --> 02:28:40,710
I should be able to.

4294
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:42,930
I should have enough HP to live through this.

4295
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:46,310
Oh I do not have enough HP to live through this.

4296
02:28:46,870 --> 02:28:47,830
Oh no.

4297
02:28:48,610 --> 02:28:49,370
Oh no.

4298
02:28:49,370 --> 02:28:49,870
There was hope.

4299
02:28:50,910 --> 02:28:51,390
Briefly.

4300
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:53,190
There was brief hope.

4301
02:28:53,330 --> 02:28:55,130
There was brief hope.

4302
02:28:57,130 --> 02:28:59,290
No I'm almost at the island too!

4303
02:29:03,090 --> 02:29:04,270
Oh wait wait I can crawl.

4304
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:05,990
I can crawl to land.

4305
02:29:07,310 --> 02:29:07,790
Pain.

4306
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:08,270
Misery.

4307
02:29:08,730 --> 02:29:09,210
Absolution.

4308
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:10,690
Can I crawl to- I can.

4309
02:29:10,830 --> 02:29:11,990
Oh I'm just dead.

4310
02:29:12,750 --> 02:29:14,170
Wait unless- wait I can!

4311
02:29:14,810 --> 02:29:16,310
I can crawl to land!

4312
02:29:17,630 --> 02:29:18,710
It'll be fine.

4313
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:25,520
And then she slowly dies on land.

4314
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:25,980
No!

4315
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:27,620
My island!

4316
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:31,660
So I was like don't give up!

4317
02:29:31,860 --> 02:29:34,140
Guys I think I might give up right here.

4318
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:38,560
I didn't know how to get to- I was lost!

4319
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:40,540
I got so lost.

4320
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:43,140
Oh no.

4321
02:29:44,980 --> 02:29:46,500
It's okay I can find my items.

4322
02:29:46,780 --> 02:29:48,940
I just need to crawl to land right now.

4323
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:53,640
Bro I swear I just brought so much to the base and now it's all gone.

4324
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:54,340
What did it go?

4325
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:57,120
Did someone make the- pick up the Nightwing saddle?

4326
02:29:57,760 --> 02:29:58,240
Nope.

4327
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:01,400
Guys I found the island.

4328
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:03,780
Stone I mean.

4329
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:05,860
I can get my items back.

4330
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:07,660
Cause I'm on land now.

4331
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:09,760
I can get my items back.

4332
02:30:10,060 --> 02:30:10,520
I can get my items back.

4333
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:12,640
I was like how do you get lost when you have a map?

4334
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:15,020
I just wanted to get there faster!

4335
02:30:21,630 --> 02:30:23,190
Well the stone is gone.

4336
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:25,830
Oh shit!

4337
02:30:25,890 --> 02:30:26,730
I can respawn here!

4338
02:30:27,610 --> 02:30:29,630
Yeah I'd be using this stone to make balls.

4339
02:30:31,010 --> 02:30:32,030
Oh my god.

4340
02:30:33,130 --> 02:30:35,810
My whole life I've been working for these stones.

4341
02:30:36,310 --> 02:30:37,070
Oh my god.

4342
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:37,390
Oh my god okay.

4343
02:30:37,830 --> 02:30:38,870
I figured it out.

4344
02:30:40,090 --> 02:30:41,290
That's fucking capitalism.

4345
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:42,510
Stone cold.

4346
02:30:44,090 --> 02:30:45,130
Cause I'm a little cold right now.

4347
02:30:45,230 --> 02:30:45,970
My shirt.

4348
02:30:46,290 --> 02:30:47,410
I lost my shirt.

4349
02:30:49,430 --> 02:30:51,670
Okay I need to replace my wolf.

4350
02:30:52,690 --> 02:30:54,030
I don't need you anymore.

4351
02:30:54,450 --> 02:30:55,710
Alright I'm gonna use the bathrobe right back.

4352
02:30:56,210 --> 02:30:56,910
Good luck.

4353
02:30:57,770 --> 02:30:58,490
Don't fall in.

4354
02:30:58,950 --> 02:31:00,190
Don't forget to check your balls.

4355
02:31:02,330 --> 02:31:03,810
Check before you get wrecked.

4356
02:31:05,830 --> 02:31:07,230
Oh shit dire wolf's okay.

4357
02:31:07,450 --> 02:31:08,490
I only got my first dire wolf.

4358
02:31:09,030 --> 02:31:10,250
Oh we got a stone here.

4359
02:31:10,530 --> 02:31:10,970
Nice.

4360
02:31:11,950 --> 02:31:12,890
Wait you know what?

4361
02:31:15,250 --> 02:31:19,110
I'm gonna go back to the Oh my god did you just one shot him?

4362
02:31:19,470 --> 02:31:20,570
What's wrong with you?

4363
02:31:23,910 --> 02:31:25,190
My pals are too aggressive.

4364
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:39,660
That's like the worst part is like you get to a certain like That's one thing that Nintendo did right with Pokemon is that you get to a certain level and it just makes it so you can catch stuff easily without like the lift monks.

4365
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:44,260
Because all my pals just one shot everything and then it's like impossible.

4366
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:49,340
Back!

4367
02:31:49,620 --> 02:31:49,900
Oh shit.

4368
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:54,480
Can anyone like... does anyone have a quill burn on them right now and can you give it to me?

4369
02:31:54,660 --> 02:31:54,940
Uh oh.

4370
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:55,880
Oh no.

4371
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:57,460
I just want a quill burn.

4372
02:31:58,160 --> 02:31:59,280
What is a quill burn?

4373
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:01,460
The fire... not the fire burn.

4374
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:03,460
One of the dragons for flight.

4375
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:04,580
Mmm mmm mmm.

4376
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:07,880
Did you just cancel my saddle?

4377
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:08,960
Yeah.

4378
02:32:09,540 --> 02:32:11,540
Well I didn't cancel anyone's saddle.

4379
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:12,380
There was nothing in here.

4380
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:14,820
There's a cowardly victim right here.

4381
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:16,940
Oh yeah there was nothing.

4382
02:32:16,940 --> 02:32:18,040
Alright you're right.

4383
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,520
I'm making a saddle.

4384
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:23,880
I didn't cancel no saddle.

4385
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,160
Wow you're gonna blame a Vtuber?

4386
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:27,540
Your chat will not like that.

4387
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:30,740
I can't believe your chat's not gonna like that.

4388
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:32,140
No they will like that.

4389
02:32:32,660 --> 02:32:35,180
They'll spam evilge.

4390
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:40,020
Alright let's see.

4391
02:32:40,660 --> 02:32:42,560
I'm gonna grab get my shit back.

4392
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:46,160
Dying was a strat.

4393
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:46,920
It made me close enough to the end.

4394
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:47,620
I'm gonna go suit to the boss.

4395
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:52,120
Use the hound.

4396
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:55,880
I am not using this boar to ride him fast.

4397
02:32:56,100 --> 02:32:58,060
I'm using this boar to mine.

4398
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:58,680
I'm almost at the boss out here.

4399
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:00,940
Wait Shufar what level are you right now?

4400
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:02,140
29.

4401
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:04,240
Oh you can catch the Mamos.

4402
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:06,420
You can like kill the Mamos thing soon.

4403
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:08,260
But I wanna make a gun first.

4404
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:10,000
And I also need to make high...

4405
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:14,860
I need ingots to make high resistant...

4406
02:33:14,860 --> 02:33:15,160
...

4407
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:19,260
armor and then I can go and buy high quality metal.

4408
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:21,160
So I can make a gun and then I can buy ammo.

4409
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:22,740
And then I can kill everything.

4410
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:24,540
There's so much to this.

4411
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:26,380
Yeah but we're not supposed to kill everything.

4412
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:27,700
We're supposed to catch things.

4413
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:30,620
But I can kill them and then catch them cause I'm killing them.

4414
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:31,780
Ah wait.

4415
02:33:32,460 --> 02:33:33,220
Where's the logic?

4416
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:35,860
Wait.

4417
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:37,860
There's my stuff though.

4418
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:39,700
Boom.

4419
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:42,300
So I was like I wanna make a gun first.

4420
02:33:42,360 --> 02:33:43,060
A true American.

4421
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:44,160
He's Canadian!

4422
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:49,780
In no time.

4423
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:53,000
Alright nice I got my stuff.

4424
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:53,580
Okay.

4425
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:54,480
You're free Abu.

4426
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:55,780
That's all it is.

4427
02:33:55,900 --> 02:33:57,440
Where the fuck is the Grintail?

4428
02:33:58,820 --> 02:33:59,820
It's right here.

4429
02:34:01,060 --> 02:34:01,560
Efficiency.

4430
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:05,600
I wanna get a flying pal so bad.

4431
02:34:06,260 --> 02:34:07,460
I wanna get that...

4432
02:34:07,460 --> 02:34:08,220
...Quilvern.

4433
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:12,580
I wonder where the closest one is.

4434
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,600
The closest one is like near the bridge area.

4435
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:16,720
Oh really?

4436
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:16,900
Yeah.

4437
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:19,440
Like one of the bridges from what I remember.

4438
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:24,300
Canada is simply North United States.

4439
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:27,720
It's America's hat.

4440
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:30,300
Okay.

4441
02:34:30,700 --> 02:34:31,940
Should be near here.

4442
02:34:35,370 --> 02:34:36,550
Where's that live monk statue?

4443
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:37,970
Oh god I'm gonna fucking drown again.

4444
02:34:38,130 --> 02:34:38,350
Why?

4445
02:34:38,550 --> 02:34:39,430
No not the fuck.

4446
02:34:40,250 --> 02:34:40,730
Why?

4447
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:41,770
Not this again.

4448
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:48,370
Yeah I should probably spec into way quite a bit.

4449
02:34:48,370 --> 02:34:48,870
I don't know.

4450
02:34:49,570 --> 02:34:51,190
I have found my purpose.

4451
02:34:52,230 --> 02:34:52,670
Well.

4452
02:34:53,210 --> 02:34:54,330
I drowned here.

4453
02:34:57,230 --> 02:34:58,250
I've had more eggs.

4454
02:34:59,770 --> 02:35:00,430
Why did I drown here?

4455
02:35:00,430 --> 02:35:01,050
Why is there an energy here?

4456
02:35:02,050 --> 02:35:02,710
Grab that.

4457
02:35:02,790 --> 02:35:03,490
Why did I have to fall?

4458
02:35:04,990 --> 02:35:06,270
Have we pet anything yet?

4459
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:06,470
No.

4460
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:07,050
No.

4461
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:09,130
And we're petting stuff.

4462
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:12,590
We can just grab all our pals and start petting them.

4463
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:13,230
At the end.

4464
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:15,790
Like at the last 30 minutes just start petting.

4465
02:35:16,310 --> 02:35:18,630
Nah they removed that feature for North America.

4466
02:35:18,750 --> 02:35:19,810
We couldn't be trusted with it.

4467
02:35:20,490 --> 02:35:21,610
What petting pals?

4468
02:35:21,750 --> 02:35:22,430
Petting pals?

4469
02:35:22,690 --> 02:35:23,370
What do you guys do?

4470
02:35:23,750 --> 02:35:24,610
What do we do?

4471
02:35:25,130 --> 02:35:26,530
What do you do with them?

4472
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:27,010
Yeah.

4473
02:35:29,450 --> 02:35:33,530
Dude you don't know about that there's like so many games out of Japan where they have like a petting feature.

4474
02:35:33,970 --> 02:35:37,410
Whether it's like for animals or for people question mark.

4475
02:35:37,570 --> 02:35:40,230
But like they just remove that feature.

4476
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:41,210
It's not manly enough.

4477
02:35:41,670 --> 02:35:44,630
Wait what are you guys doing with the petting feature?

4478
02:35:44,910 --> 02:35:45,770
Wait what are you guys doing with the petting feature?

4479
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:46,190
Are we?

4480
02:35:46,270 --> 02:35:47,710
Yeah I'm concerned now.

4481
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:49,670
What are we doing with the petting feature?

4482
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:50,850
We're removing that.

4483
02:35:52,930 --> 02:35:53,930
I've said too much.

4484
02:35:54,490 --> 02:35:55,810
I've said too much.

4485
02:35:56,330 --> 02:35:57,270
Oh no.

4486
02:35:57,770 --> 02:35:59,350
Are we bad people?

4487
02:36:00,210 --> 02:36:01,830
Are we the bad guys?

4488
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:02,410
Yeah.

4489
02:36:05,910 --> 02:36:06,390
Alright.

4490
02:36:06,530 --> 02:36:08,610
I died but at least I died where I wanted to be.

4491
02:36:09,890 --> 02:36:11,190
Out of the fucking water.

4492
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:16,320
Over here.

4493
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:16,980
Stack dog.

4494
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:18,280
Get over here.

4495
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:19,780
Giving them the cake.

4496
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:26,570
Guys we might be 12 now.

4497
02:36:26,910 --> 02:36:30,490
But like the moment we hit our fucking breaking point.

4498
02:36:30,550 --> 02:36:31,530
It's gonna go so fast.

4499
02:36:31,790 --> 02:36:33,590
Once we start petting the pals we're gonna be in first.

4500
02:36:33,810 --> 02:36:39,150
Like you guys might be like wow you guys are only 12.

4501
02:36:39,350 --> 02:36:41,450
But because this is a long game.

4502
02:36:41,610 --> 02:36:42,910
Trust the process.

4503
02:36:46,330 --> 02:36:48,070
We built the foundation.

4504
02:36:49,130 --> 02:36:49,710
We built this dirty house.

4505
02:36:50,010 --> 02:36:51,410
I was like trust the process.

4506
02:36:51,530 --> 02:36:52,610
And I'm like where am I?

4507
02:36:55,270 --> 02:36:56,470
Now enough about that.

4508
02:36:57,110 --> 02:36:58,830
Now you trust the process.

4509
02:36:58,970 --> 02:37:00,090
I figured out where I am.

4510
02:37:04,510 --> 02:37:04,990
Yeah.

4511
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,810
Yeah get him.

4512
02:37:07,990 --> 02:37:08,730
I found the tail.

4513
02:37:08,930 --> 02:37:09,770
I found Grimtail.

4514
02:37:13,330 --> 02:37:13,990
What the?

4515
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:15,970
Oh shit that's a...

4516
02:37:17,230 --> 02:37:18,570
Oh he's level 17.

4517
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:19,850
Wait he's level 17?

4518
02:37:23,710 --> 02:37:25,070
Oh you don't have to...

4519
02:37:26,150 --> 02:37:26,770
Oh you don't have to...

4520
02:37:28,050 --> 02:37:30,190
Oh my god you're level 10.

4521
02:37:30,310 --> 02:37:31,230
I didn't even realize.

4522
02:37:31,930 --> 02:37:32,830
Did you kill him?

4523
02:37:33,070 --> 02:37:36,070
No no I meant like my fucking wolf is level 10.

4524
02:37:36,850 --> 02:37:37,810
It's okay I got you.

4525
02:37:37,870 --> 02:37:38,210
Level 10?

4526
02:37:38,770 --> 02:37:41,150
Yeah cause I forgot I killed the other one accidentally.

4527
02:37:42,350 --> 02:37:44,810
Uh you don't lose your pals when you die.

4528
02:37:45,210 --> 02:37:47,430
No but he died cause I drowned him accidentally.

4529
02:37:47,930 --> 02:37:47,950
No but he died cause I drowned him accidentally.

4530
02:37:47,950 --> 02:37:49,490
Oh so you put him in rehabilitation.

4531
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:51,470
Oops.

4532
02:37:52,990 --> 02:37:55,550
So I had to replace him for a little bit.

4533
02:37:57,050 --> 02:37:58,170
Go chillin go.

4534
02:38:00,110 --> 02:38:01,990
I need to go make the...

4535
02:38:01,990 --> 02:38:03,490
Man I need a flying mount.

4536
02:38:04,730 --> 02:38:05,210
Okay.

4537
02:38:05,290 --> 02:38:06,390
Yeah I've been working on that too.

4538
02:38:06,850 --> 02:38:10,810
I'm just gonna go grab one of the shitty pigeons from the start.

4539
02:38:11,810 --> 02:38:12,890
That's a good idea.

4540
02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:13,310
A shitty pigeon?

4541
02:38:14,350 --> 02:38:15,710
That's all I got okay?

4542
02:38:15,790 --> 02:38:17,390
That's all I have.

4543
02:38:17,390 --> 02:38:18,270
Beggars can't be choosers.

4544
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:22,230
That's a good idea.

4545
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:23,110
Go fox go.

4546
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:25,430
I don't have a weapon still cause I keep...

4547
02:38:25,430 --> 02:38:25,670
Woah!

4548
02:38:28,090 --> 02:38:31,030
He fucking almost one shot me holy shit.

4549
02:38:32,350 --> 02:38:33,310
Do you have a shield?

4550
02:38:33,630 --> 02:38:34,110
No.

4551
02:38:34,550 --> 02:38:35,830
We don't need shields.

4552
02:38:35,830 --> 02:38:36,710
Shields are for losers.

4553
02:38:38,030 --> 02:38:39,750
I say as I'm about to die.

4554
02:38:43,130 --> 02:38:45,030
Oh wait do we still need people?

4555
02:38:45,170 --> 02:38:46,050
Do we have all of our people?

4556
02:38:46,630 --> 02:38:47,670
No we need 10.

4557
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:48,630
I think we still need...

4558
02:38:48,630 --> 02:38:49,130
10?

4559
02:38:49,570 --> 02:38:50,730
No we need 20.

4560
02:38:51,390 --> 02:38:52,610
Oh shit really?

4561
02:38:52,810 --> 02:38:54,650
We need 20 in the viewers range.

4562
02:38:58,750 --> 02:38:59,890
Wait can I catch him?

4563
02:38:59,950 --> 02:39:00,530
He's definitely dead.

4564
02:39:00,870 --> 02:39:01,490
Oh okay cool.

4565
02:39:01,690 --> 02:39:03,230
Not my fault.

4566
02:39:03,690 --> 02:39:05,350
I caught two more humans.

4567
02:39:05,730 --> 02:39:06,130
Nice.

4568
02:39:12,250 --> 02:39:13,770
More balls less shields.

4569
02:39:14,530 --> 02:39:15,270
That's right.

4570
02:39:15,550 --> 02:39:16,550
I'm gonna make a shield.

4571
02:39:17,290 --> 02:39:18,830
Please don't get involved.

4572
02:39:19,870 --> 02:39:20,430
Please.

4573
02:39:22,650 --> 02:39:24,490
There's just too much stuff going on.

4574
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:25,830
We have so much shit.

4575
02:39:25,950 --> 02:39:26,630
Oh my god.

4576
02:39:30,690 --> 02:39:31,130
Lord.

4577
02:39:33,690 --> 02:39:35,770
Cause none of the pals are picking up the items.

4578
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:37,290
So our base is just like...

4579
02:39:37,290 --> 02:39:38,590
It's time for you to pick it up.

4580
02:39:38,630 --> 02:39:39,470
It's in shambles.

4581
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:42,930
Come on.

4582
02:39:43,230 --> 02:39:44,030
Come on.

4583
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:45,570
Come on!

4584
02:39:48,370 --> 02:39:50,110
Please at least give me that.

4585
02:39:51,470 --> 02:39:52,490
I got it!

4586
02:39:52,510 --> 02:39:52,670
One!

4587
02:39:52,910 --> 02:39:53,430
Clip it!

4588
02:39:54,050 --> 02:39:54,990
I got Grintail!

4589
02:39:55,630 --> 02:39:57,770
I'm dead though but I got Grintail.

4590
02:39:57,850 --> 02:39:59,010
That's all that matters.

4591
02:39:59,130 --> 02:40:00,130
That's all that matters.

4592
02:40:01,130 --> 02:40:02,410
That's all that matters.

4593
02:40:02,850 --> 02:40:04,070
What is my purpose?

4594
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:05,310
You mind rock.

4595
02:40:05,690 --> 02:40:06,410
Oh no.

4596
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:09,490
I did my job.

4597
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:13,750
Okay now they grabbed my shit again.

4598
02:40:13,970 --> 02:40:14,210
Why are we winging it?

4599
02:40:15,050 --> 02:40:17,950
Because their fire pokémon is not cooking half the time.

4600
02:40:18,050 --> 02:40:18,370
Oh.

4601
02:40:19,630 --> 02:40:20,450
That's not good.

4602
02:40:20,570 --> 02:40:21,910
It's time to grab more.

4603
02:40:22,030 --> 02:40:23,550
Sounds like that would.

4604
02:40:24,050 --> 02:40:28,550
I might make another base and just have it only for iron and stuff.

4605
02:40:28,750 --> 02:40:29,070
Yeah.

4606
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:31,370
Cause I need it for stuff.

4607
02:40:31,650 --> 02:40:32,670
Okay where's my...

4608
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:33,110
That's fine.

4609
02:40:33,250 --> 02:40:33,390
That's fine.

4610
02:40:35,090 --> 02:40:37,030
My other die will be sixteen.

4611
02:40:40,750 --> 02:40:41,750
Come on.

4612
02:40:42,230 --> 02:40:43,590
Alright we got...

4613
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:45,910
Okay we got Grintail.

4614
02:40:46,050 --> 02:40:48,390
I need the Azurobe.

4615
02:40:48,550 --> 02:40:50,550
Let me still figure out where the fuck Azurobe is.

4616
02:40:51,190 --> 02:40:53,150
Um he's near the bridge.

4617
02:40:54,390 --> 02:40:55,330
Near the bridge?

4618
02:40:55,370 --> 02:40:56,270
He spawns in the water.

4619
02:40:56,550 --> 02:40:57,030
Okay.

4620
02:40:57,970 --> 02:41:01,150
Alright that doesn't really help me too much but I get it.

4621
02:41:01,170 --> 02:41:01,770
Uh sorry the...

4622
02:41:01,770 --> 02:41:07,010
The bridge that's to like the north west of our house.

4623
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:07,730
The bridge that's to like the north west of our house.

4624
02:41:07,730 --> 02:41:08,910
North west of our house?

4625
02:41:09,090 --> 02:41:09,250
Mmhmm.

4626
02:41:09,470 --> 02:41:12,530
Head to the bridge and then go to the water that's to the west of the bridge.

4627
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:14,130
Where's west?

4628
02:41:14,450 --> 02:41:15,150
This way.

4629
02:41:15,330 --> 02:41:15,690
Okay.

4630
02:41:16,450 --> 02:41:18,030
I'm gonna grab my stuff real fast.

4631
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:27,300
Uh...

4632
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:28,240
Why use boar?

4633
02:41:28,340 --> 02:41:29,000
Boar fast.

4634
02:41:29,220 --> 02:41:32,400
Look how fast I'm demolishing this rock with the boar.

4635
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:32,960
Yeah.

4636
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:34,860
Trust in the process.

4637
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:35,360
Boar is crazy.

4638
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:36,900
Just trust the process.

4639
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,120
Yeah trust the fucking process.

4640
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:40,280
Come on.

4641
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:43,360
We might not be like very high placement right now.

4642
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:46,480
But like in the last hour you're gonna see a skyrocket.

4643
02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:47,300
Yeah.

4644
02:41:48,820 --> 02:41:49,720
It's over here.

4645
02:41:49,940 --> 02:41:51,860
Wait where even is the...

4646
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:53,320
Oh there it is.

4647
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:53,740
Okay.

4648
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:55,740
Where's my stuff?

4649
02:41:56,740 --> 02:41:58,440
Where did I... Oh there it is.

4650
02:41:58,560 --> 02:41:58,620
Okay.

4651
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:01,520
Where the fuck is the fire guy?

4652
02:42:03,440 --> 02:42:04,340
Oh he's over there.

4653
02:42:04,420 --> 02:42:05,140
What is he doing?

4654
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:08,280
Wait there's an effigy right here too.

4655
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:09,460
And now we deliver.

4656
02:42:12,060 --> 02:42:12,840
Come here.

4657
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:15,020
Make...

4658
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:16,800
Make ingot.

4659
02:42:17,480 --> 02:42:18,900
You have literally one task.

4660
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:19,880
Just make ingot.

4661
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:20,960
Okay.

4662
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:25,060
Just...

4663
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:25,640
Just...

4664
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:27,180
Spank it into them.

4665
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:30,720
I trust the process.

4666
02:42:30,860 --> 02:42:31,400
And then do nothing.

4667
02:42:31,740 --> 02:42:33,900
I think a lot of them are just getting fucked on pathing.

4668
02:42:34,340 --> 02:42:34,700
Yeah.

4669
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:36,920
I think our base is like so...

4670
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:39,880
Our base is gonna get real fucking crazy to be fair.

4671
02:42:39,940 --> 02:42:40,840
I'm just gonna get rid of some stuff.

4672
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:43,920
Ah shit I didn't want to kill him.

4673
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:47,320
Uh like we're not really using like the mill and shit.

4674
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:48,720
So I'm just gonna get rid of them.

4675
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:50,580
If we need them we can just rebuild them.

4676
02:42:50,680 --> 02:42:51,820
Isolated island cavern.

4677
02:42:51,980 --> 02:42:52,840
Is that part of the...

4678
02:42:52,860 --> 02:42:53,560
Of the dungeons we have to do?

4679
02:42:54,920 --> 02:42:55,360
No.

4680
02:42:57,060 --> 02:42:58,760
Wait why can't I pick up more of these.

4681
02:42:58,900 --> 02:43:00,460
Oh there it all goes.

4682
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:02,640
Where the fuck is the...

4683
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:03,840
It should be up here.

4684
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:04,320
Okay.

4685
02:43:04,880 --> 02:43:07,140
I need to get the...

4686
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:11,560
Nightwing Okay I'm gonna try and find the azurope right now.

4687
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:13,860
Is it because of these fuckers?

4688
02:43:14,720 --> 02:43:15,160
Okay.

4689
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:19,800
Where the fuck...

4690
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:21,120
Oh, it's this way.

4691
02:43:24,460 --> 02:43:25,820
How many hours do we have left?

4692
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:27,460
I don't have my timer up.

4693
02:43:28,020 --> 02:43:29,540
An hour and 45.

4694
02:43:30,060 --> 02:43:30,920
An hour and 45?

4695
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:36,040
I think at an hour we gotta start actually doing a bunch of these.

4696
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:37,960
Aye aye, captain.

4697
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:45,140
I will stone production through the roof.

4698
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:45,860
Damn.

4699
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,680
I'm catching all the stone.

4700
02:43:48,680 --> 02:43:53,340
I'm gonna make a weapon for... holy shit this is laggy.

4701
02:43:54,780 --> 02:43:56,140
Wait, did you go back to the base?

4702
02:43:56,320 --> 02:43:59,080
Yeah, I'm destroying things right now.

4703
02:43:59,480 --> 02:44:00,580
Cause it's really bad.

4704
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:02,600
Okay, I'll grab this.

4705
02:44:06,560 --> 02:44:10,000
How dare you ask me how I'm doing?

4706
02:44:10,160 --> 02:44:11,640
I'm mining a rock.

4707
02:44:11,940 --> 02:44:12,780
What do you think?

4708
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:14,720
How do you think she's doing right now?

4709
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:16,560
How do you think?

4710
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:19,700
This is my life now.

4711
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:20,740
I'm so slow.

4712
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:22,360
Why is it so laggy?

4713
02:44:22,380 --> 02:44:22,960
Oh my god.

4714
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:24,740
Oh, I didn't even have a shield.

4715
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:29,060
I thought you said you didn't need one.

4716
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:32,960
No, I was just... I was just a ha ha joke.

4717
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:33,940
Hee hee.

4718
02:44:34,480 --> 02:44:35,940
I was just testing you guys.

4719
02:44:35,940 --> 02:44:36,900
It was just hee hee funny.

4720
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:38,920
Just doing a little hee hee ha ha.

4721
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:41,020
Yeah, it was just a joke.

4722
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:42,460
Why are you guys so serious?

4723
02:44:43,380 --> 02:44:45,100
Why are you so serious?

4724
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:46,740
Why are you so serious over here?

4725
02:44:47,620 --> 02:44:49,880
Where's the... where's the crafting table?

4726
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:51,680
Uh, there's two.

4727
02:44:51,740 --> 02:44:52,760
There's one right by the Pell Box.

4728
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:54,600
And then, uh, which crafting table?

4729
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:56,080
I need like a regular crafting.

4730
02:44:56,260 --> 02:44:56,960
Is it just this left?

4731
02:44:57,160 --> 02:44:57,380
Yeah.

4732
02:44:57,500 --> 02:44:57,860
Okay.

4733
02:44:58,060 --> 02:44:59,340
There's a... hold on.

4734
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:00,500
I'm building another one.

4735
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:01,540
I'm building a high quality one.

4736
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:02,860
I'm just gonna make this...

4737
02:45:02,860 --> 02:45:03,480
Or I was trying to anyway.

4738
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:04,020
Here we go.

4739
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:06,440
Alright, high quality crafting table right here.

4740
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:08,040
Nice.

4741
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:09,940
And then the speed should go up too.

4742
02:45:12,060 --> 02:45:14,040
We don't have like 30 crafting tables.

4743
02:45:14,340 --> 02:45:15,880
Wait, where's the... where's the other one?

4744
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:16,280
Right here.

4745
02:45:16,280 --> 02:45:16,580
Yeah, the mine.

4746
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:17,680
The stone mine.

4747
02:45:17,780 --> 02:45:18,020
Yep.

4748
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:19,240
Go for it.

4749
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:22,420
Okay, now I should make my shield.

4750
02:45:23,020 --> 02:45:25,680
Okay, who can help me craft?

4751
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,080
Gathering... gathering all my other pals because...

4752
02:45:31,080 --> 02:45:31,380
I am rock.

4753
02:45:31,700 --> 02:45:32,240
Gathering bitches.

4754
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:32,740
Okay.

4755
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:35,020
I am become rock.

4756
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:38,480
I am become rock.

4757
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:38,860
I am become rock.

4758
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:39,260
I am become rock.

4759
02:45:39,260 --> 02:45:39,460
I am become rock.

4760
02:45:40,840 --> 02:45:41,720
I am become rock.

4761
02:45:41,720 --> 02:45:42,620
I am become rock.

4762
02:45:43,140 --> 02:45:44,380
I am become rock.

4763
02:45:44,380 --> 02:45:45,600
Yay!

4764
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:47,420
Yippee!

4765
02:45:47,460 --> 02:45:48,080
Yippee!

4766
02:45:50,380 --> 02:45:53,220
I'm just glad to be a great great asset.

4767
02:45:54,440 --> 02:45:55,540
High ladder.

4768
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:56,860
You matter!

4769
02:45:58,680 --> 02:46:03,560
One of these days I hope my stamina runs out when I jump off this cliff.

4770
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:06,540
I have our... I finally have a weapon guys.

4771
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:07,520
I'm doing it.

4772
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:07,920
Look at that mount.

4773
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:08,360
Beautiful.

4774
02:46:09,440 --> 02:46:11,000
Finally have a weapon.

4775
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:15,640
What happened?

4776
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:16,420
Wait, what happened to the fire?

4777
02:46:16,660 --> 02:46:17,740
I'll put another one here.

4778
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:22,140
I feel like we should make another like... what is it called?

4779
02:46:22,300 --> 02:46:23,440
The ore thing?

4780
02:46:24,320 --> 02:46:24,880
Ore thing?

4781
02:46:25,160 --> 02:46:26,720
Oh, you mean the furnace?

4782
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:30,360
Well, actually we should ask... we should ask Cher to make the better one.

4783
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:31,280
Oh yeah.

4784
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:33,420
I think that they... I think you actually have it unlocked already.

4785
02:46:33,520 --> 02:46:35,200
Do you have like the nice furnace?

4786
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:36,440
I think it's level...

4787
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:37,780
Let's find out.

4788
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:41,180
I don't think so.

4789
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:42,280
Hold on.

4790
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:43,220
What level is that one?

4791
02:46:47,240 --> 02:46:48,420
I get it at 34.

4792
02:46:48,920 --> 02:46:49,500
Oh, okay.

4793
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:49,720
Okay.

4794
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:50,520
Alright.

4795
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:52,140
What level are you right now?

4796
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:53,760
We need like three more POW beds.

4797
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:55,300
Our guys are fucking stressed out.

4798
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:56,160
Got it.

4799
02:46:57,980 --> 02:46:58,420
Okay.

4800
02:46:58,840 --> 02:47:00,420
Now I have arrows.

4801
02:47:00,700 --> 02:47:01,260
Let's go.

4802
02:47:08,940 --> 02:47:09,380
Alright.

4803
02:47:09,560 --> 02:47:11,500
Craft craft craft craft craft craft craft craft.

4804
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:16,100
My job of company morale.

4805
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:16,660
Yes.

4806
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:23,180
After 20 years, I finally did it.

4807
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:24,660
I have a weapon.

4808
02:47:25,800 --> 02:47:26,280
Yay.

4809
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:26,720
MGP.

4810
02:47:26,980 --> 02:47:27,460
Yay.

4811
02:47:28,660 --> 02:47:30,460
Now I can be a true asset.

4812
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:33,360
I have high quality POW all over.

4813
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:35,360
I have six POW all over by the way.

4814
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:36,500
I can't believe she's following my footsteps.

4815
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:37,860
I can't believe it.

4816
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:39,080
I'm learning so much.

4817
02:47:39,100 --> 02:47:40,300
I can't believe it.

4818
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:43,460
Is there any more POW... I need to make some POW balls.

4819
02:47:44,140 --> 02:47:45,620
They grow by so fast.

4820
02:47:46,240 --> 02:47:47,140
POW ball time.

4821
02:47:48,060 --> 02:47:48,940
That's not it.

4822
02:47:49,660 --> 02:47:51,000
Wait, that's a claw farm.

4823
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:51,660
Did it not...

4824
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:52,820
Oh, there you go.

4825
02:47:54,220 --> 02:47:54,740
Uh...

4826
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:55,540
Here.

4827
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:59,680
I'm gonna put more chests so I can give you guys the...

4828
02:48:00,360 --> 02:48:01,960
The high quality POW oil.

4829
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:04,360
Okay.

4830
02:48:07,480 --> 02:48:08,000
Alright.

4831
02:48:08,180 --> 02:48:09,060
Put that away.

4832
02:48:09,060 --> 02:48:09,280
Okay.

4833
02:48:09,280 --> 02:48:10,620
That fixed the fire problem.

4834
02:48:11,020 --> 02:48:12,420
It's like making fire now.

4835
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:13,080
Yay.

4836
02:48:13,940 --> 02:48:14,960
Now we got fire.

4837
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:16,200
We have discovered fire.

4838
02:48:16,300 --> 02:48:17,220
Now we got fire.

4839
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:17,680
We got fire.

4840
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:19,220
Got fire now.

4841
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:22,120
When do I get crossbow?

4842
02:48:23,340 --> 02:48:25,040
I need a POW that can fucking...

4843
02:48:25,980 --> 02:48:26,600
Oh shit.

4844
02:48:26,680 --> 02:48:27,240
I already have crossbow.

4845
02:48:27,300 --> 02:48:27,640
Cool.

4846
02:48:27,720 --> 02:48:27,840
Cool.

4847
02:48:27,900 --> 02:48:27,980
Cool.

4848
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:28,420
I'm gonna make it.

4849
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:30,560
No.

4850
02:48:30,700 --> 02:48:31,860
I can't cause I don't have any.

4851
02:48:34,420 --> 02:48:34,780
Alright.

4852
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:35,660
Get over here.

4853
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:37,260
Oh wait.

4854
02:48:37,320 --> 02:48:37,620
Not you.

4855
02:48:38,660 --> 02:48:41,480
Actually, I heard sweet butt is like the strongest shit ever.

4856
02:48:43,780 --> 02:48:45,860
Did you... Did you beat Azerob?

4857
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:46,920
Azerob?

4858
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:47,220
Nope.

4859
02:48:47,820 --> 02:48:48,220
Okay.

4860
02:48:48,320 --> 02:48:48,380
Okay.

4861
02:48:48,460 --> 02:48:49,860
Are you doing Azerob right now?

4862
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:50,340
Maybe head that way.

4863
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:51,180
Maybe.

4864
02:48:52,580 --> 02:48:53,520
I'm thinking about it.

4865
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:54,960
Yeah.

4866
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:55,560
Go look for it.

4867
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:56,320
Okay.

4868
02:48:56,440 --> 02:48:56,840
I'm gonna go.

4869
02:48:57,360 --> 02:48:59,200
I'm gonna go grab the other stuff then.

4870
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:00,240
Okay.

4871
02:49:00,380 --> 02:49:01,340
Do I have arrows?

4872
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:03,080
Let's see.

4873
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:04,880
I have Giga Spears.

4874
02:49:06,020 --> 02:49:06,420
Oh.

4875
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:07,840
I don't have Giga Spears.

4876
02:49:08,700 --> 02:49:10,660
It's the one after some Mega Spears.

4877
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:11,400
There it is.

4878
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:13,780
Don't have Mega Spears.

4879
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:14,360
Nevermind.

4880
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:18,840
I still need a Quillburn.

4881
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:22,960
Our like Wood and Stone production is really good though.

4882
02:49:23,060 --> 02:49:23,260
Okay.

4883
02:49:23,300 --> 02:49:24,400
Where is Quillburn?

4884
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:24,680
Thank you.

4885
02:49:24,800 --> 02:49:24,940
Thank you.

4886
02:49:28,100 --> 02:49:29,040
I think so too.

4887
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:30,560
Quillburn power.

4888
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:31,720
Great job.

4889
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:32,160
Amazing.

4890
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:33,080
Great job.

4891
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:34,680
Actually goaded.

4892
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:36,940
Where is... Where do you unlock?

4893
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:37,520
Okay.

4894
02:49:37,560 --> 02:49:40,080
I need to find a Quill... Where to find Quillburn.

4895
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:43,460
Where are you?

4896
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:48,410
Wait.

4897
02:49:48,430 --> 02:49:49,190
Not Quillburn.

4898
02:49:49,550 --> 02:49:50,430
What's not that one?

4899
02:49:50,590 --> 02:49:50,710
Okay.

4900
02:49:50,970 --> 02:49:51,370
Dragon.

4901
02:49:51,910 --> 02:49:52,710
Pal world.

4902
02:49:55,390 --> 02:49:55,790
Mount.

4903
02:49:57,870 --> 02:49:58,470
Fuck this.

4904
02:49:58,470 --> 02:49:59,230
I need a flyer.

4905
02:49:59,710 --> 02:50:00,110
Yeah.

4906
02:50:00,130 --> 02:50:01,210
When do you get a saddle though?

4907
02:50:01,250 --> 02:50:01,990
That's the other question.

4908
02:50:03,870 --> 02:50:05,010
The saddle for him?

4909
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:05,790
Van Worm.

4910
02:50:06,370 --> 02:50:07,090
There we go.

4911
02:50:07,110 --> 02:50:08,030
I need to find a Van Worm.

4912
02:50:08,790 --> 02:50:09,190
Yeah.

4913
02:50:09,490 --> 02:50:11,290
They're near the desert I think.

4914
02:50:11,470 --> 02:50:11,830
Okay.

4915
02:50:11,890 --> 02:50:12,390
I can do that.

4916
02:50:12,410 --> 02:50:13,030
I could be wrong.

4917
02:50:13,790 --> 02:50:14,190
Alright.

4918
02:50:14,330 --> 02:50:16,070
I'm getting pal... I'm getting a Van Worm.

4919
02:50:16,190 --> 02:50:16,770
That's the closest.

4920
02:50:19,630 --> 02:50:20,970
It's like next to us right?

4921
02:50:21,690 --> 02:50:22,470
Right here.

4922
02:50:23,330 --> 02:50:24,410
One more rock.

4923
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:29,280
Oops.

4924
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:31,020
That should be where Van Worm lives.

4925
02:50:31,320 --> 02:50:31,480
That's fine.

4926
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:32,060
Van Worm.

4927
02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:36,480
I'm just flying away for a second.

4928
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:36,820
Let's see.

4929
02:50:36,880 --> 02:50:39,580
Van, van, van, van, van, van, van, van, van, van, van.

4930
02:50:40,100 --> 02:50:41,100
Van Worm should be here.

4931
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:44,520
I also want to get a Van Worm.

4932
02:50:44,540 --> 02:50:44,820
Van Worm.

4933
02:50:45,440 --> 02:50:46,920
He's... It's where I am at.

4934
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:48,040
Oh.

4935
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:48,280
Okay.

4936
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:48,420
Wait.

4937
02:50:48,460 --> 02:50:49,000
Let me look on the map.

4938
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:51,880
Should be.

4939
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:55,100
From what my Google tells me.

4940
02:50:57,840 --> 02:50:58,780
Uh... Oh wait.

4941
02:50:58,840 --> 02:51:00,100
Can I see where you are on the map?

4942
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:00,480
Oh wait.

4943
02:51:00,520 --> 02:51:00,640
Yeah.

4944
02:51:00,660 --> 02:51:00,840
I can.

4945
02:51:00,940 --> 02:51:01,140
Okay.

4946
02:51:01,180 --> 02:51:02,720
It's near where I was heading to anyway.

4947
02:51:03,180 --> 02:51:04,040
That's where I was going anyway.

4948
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:04,700
I saw a mozzer.

4949
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:06,300
The mozzerina.

4950
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:06,780
Perfect.

4951
02:51:08,360 --> 02:51:09,660
The fuck are you?

4952
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:09,980
Where are you?

4953
02:51:13,100 --> 02:51:13,840
Van Worm.

4954
02:51:14,460 --> 02:51:15,160
There it is.

4955
02:51:15,340 --> 02:51:15,660
Alright.

4956
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:17,780
Don't worry.

4957
02:51:17,980 --> 02:51:19,220
I have a bow now.

4958
02:51:22,700 --> 02:51:23,560
It's fucking right.

4959
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:24,060
Get over here.

4960
02:51:27,180 --> 02:51:27,780
Come on.

4961
02:51:27,900 --> 02:51:28,540
Get over here.

4962
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:30,080
Oh shit!

4963
02:51:31,060 --> 02:51:32,120
Oh that's not our shield.

4964
02:51:32,260 --> 02:51:32,780
That's fine.

4965
02:51:33,540 --> 02:51:34,360
That's my shield.

4966
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:34,820
That's fine.

4967
02:51:34,980 --> 02:51:35,880
More rock.

4968
02:51:38,860 --> 02:51:39,300
Woo!

4969
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:39,660
Oh.

4970
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:40,660
Pal merchant just died.

4971
02:51:40,740 --> 02:51:41,360
That sucks for him.

4972
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:43,180
No!

4973
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,080
Please get over here.

4974
02:51:45,860 --> 02:51:46,580
Oh actually.

4975
02:51:46,660 --> 02:51:47,680
I guess I should probably catch them.

4976
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:49,820
Oh my god.

4977
02:51:49,900 --> 02:51:50,320
That's...

4978
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:52,440
If they're out here anyway.

4979
02:51:52,460 --> 02:51:53,280
I should probably catch them.

4980
02:51:53,540 --> 02:51:54,080
That's unfortunate.

4981
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:54,620
Please.

4982
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:55,060
No!

4983
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:55,840
I can't aim!

4984
02:51:58,420 --> 02:52:01,260
I'm having a little bit of trouble aiming right now.

4985
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,140
Are you fucking... Are you...

4986
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:04,280
No!

4987
02:52:06,980 --> 02:52:07,420
Guys.

4988
02:52:07,540 --> 02:52:08,380
Can someone pick me up?

4989
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:11,700
Please.

4990
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:13,740
I really don't want to rock back here.

4991
02:52:14,040 --> 02:52:15,460
Peepee can you pick me up?

4992
02:52:15,560 --> 02:52:15,900
Yeah.

4993
02:52:15,980 --> 02:52:16,160
Wait.

4994
02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:16,400
Wait.

4995
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:17,580
Pick you up from where?

4996
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:18,000
Pick me up.

4997
02:52:18,020 --> 02:52:18,480
I'm down.

4998
02:52:19,740 --> 02:52:20,540
Oh shit.

4999
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:21,060
Where are you?

5000
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:21,740
Let me find you.

5001
02:52:21,820 --> 02:52:23,380
I'm where the van worms are.

5002
02:52:23,580 --> 02:52:23,960
Please.

5003
02:52:24,260 --> 02:52:24,480
Uh.

5004
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:25,240
Okay.

5005
02:52:25,940 --> 02:52:27,260
My wolf killed... No!

5006
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:28,720
My wolf killed them!

5007
02:52:29,660 --> 02:52:29,960
No!

5008
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:34,610
Peepee please.

5009
02:52:35,370 --> 02:52:35,770
What?

5010
02:52:35,850 --> 02:52:36,770
I'm just catching these men.

5011
02:52:37,430 --> 02:52:37,830
Okay.

5012
02:52:37,870 --> 02:52:38,250
Never mind.

5013
02:52:38,270 --> 02:52:38,710
I'm gonna give up.

5014
02:52:40,170 --> 02:52:41,670
I don't think I can reach you in time.

5015
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:42,770
I'm gonna give up.

5016
02:52:43,350 --> 02:52:43,770
No!

5017
02:52:44,090 --> 02:52:44,730
Rest in peace.

5018
02:52:46,570 --> 02:52:48,530
My wolf killed him too!

5019
02:52:50,710 --> 02:52:51,610
Was it a shiny?

5020
02:52:51,890 --> 02:52:52,310
No.

5021
02:52:52,410 --> 02:52:53,970
It was... I just wanted a van worm.

5022
02:52:54,830 --> 02:52:55,250
Oh.

5023
02:52:59,230 --> 02:52:59,650
Okay.

5024
02:52:59,650 --> 02:53:00,170
Let's see.

5025
02:53:00,250 --> 02:53:00,830
Where did I die?

5026
02:53:01,470 --> 02:53:02,490
It wasn't so far.

5027
02:53:05,710 --> 02:53:06,990
Why didn't it open a window?

5028
02:53:07,090 --> 02:53:07,810
Holy shit.

5029
02:53:07,830 --> 02:53:08,570
It's hot in my room.

5030
02:53:10,050 --> 02:53:10,490
Passion.

5031
02:53:11,730 --> 02:53:14,290
Catching van worms is a... a struggle.

5032
02:53:14,470 --> 02:53:15,310
It's stressful, man.

5033
02:53:17,230 --> 02:53:18,510
I'm just trying to catch humans.

5034
02:53:21,750 --> 02:53:22,190
Alright.

5035
02:53:22,210 --> 02:53:22,450
You know what?

5036
02:53:22,690 --> 02:53:23,490
Go out there dude.

5037
02:53:23,590 --> 02:53:23,850
Alright.

5038
02:53:24,850 --> 02:53:25,510
I'm back.

5039
02:53:25,850 --> 02:53:26,310
Get the ball!

5040
02:53:27,950 --> 02:53:28,870
Where the fuck?

5041
02:53:29,010 --> 02:53:29,710
Oh my god.

5042
02:53:29,730 --> 02:53:30,650
I was getting shot at.

5043
02:53:32,310 --> 02:53:32,750
Please.

5044
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:36,330
Why?

5045
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:38,550
Why is this man refusing to die?

5046
02:53:38,570 --> 02:53:39,230
Get in the ball.

5047
02:53:40,570 --> 02:53:41,850
If you ask him nicely.

5048
02:53:41,850 --> 02:53:42,730
Get in the ball, man.

5049
02:53:43,130 --> 02:53:43,570
Please.

5050
02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:44,890
Guys.

5051
02:53:45,070 --> 02:53:46,510
He clearly didn't consent to this.

5052
02:53:46,510 --> 02:53:46,590
Pretty please.

5053
02:53:46,590 --> 02:53:47,450
Can you get in the ball?

5054
02:53:48,990 --> 02:53:50,770
Sentient invisible gun.

5055
02:53:50,970 --> 02:53:52,530
He clearly didn't consent to it.

5056
02:53:52,770 --> 02:53:53,710
Pretty please.

5057
02:53:54,010 --> 02:53:56,570
Can I put you in my human circus?

5058
02:53:58,130 --> 02:53:59,010
Human circus?

5059
02:53:59,010 --> 02:54:00,130
We have like 20 yet?

5060
02:54:00,150 --> 02:54:00,390
Thank you.

5061
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:02,630
Isn't that one of the goals?

5062
02:54:02,750 --> 02:54:04,770
That we have to put them in a little cage?

5063
02:54:05,050 --> 02:54:05,490
We need 20.

5064
02:54:06,170 --> 02:54:07,910
I was like, do we have 20?

5065
02:54:10,070 --> 02:54:12,130
I just caught 2 or 3 I think.

5066
02:54:12,130 --> 02:54:13,010
I think we're far from 20.

5067
02:54:13,450 --> 02:54:16,710
I have like... I have like 3?

5068
02:54:16,930 --> 02:54:18,350
I think 3 or 2 on me.

5069
02:54:22,350 --> 02:54:24,330
Now I need to find a fucking bam worm again.

5070
02:54:25,890 --> 02:54:26,910
God damn it.

5071
02:54:29,190 --> 02:54:30,550
I wish I had a chillit.

5072
02:54:30,550 --> 02:54:31,930
Then I could like swim over there.

5073
02:54:32,030 --> 02:54:34,810
I really need to get some pal that can do logistics.

5074
02:54:34,810 --> 02:54:35,670
I can give you the chillit.

5075
02:54:36,270 --> 02:54:37,030
Oh for real?

5076
02:54:37,030 --> 02:54:37,930
I don't need it.

5077
02:54:38,090 --> 02:54:38,150
Oh okay.

5078
02:54:38,930 --> 02:54:39,330
Sweet.

5079
02:54:39,590 --> 02:54:40,350
Just need it.

5080
02:54:40,810 --> 02:54:41,970
Next time you're at the base.

5081
02:54:42,870 --> 02:54:43,710
Yeah I'll just put it in the thing.

5082
02:54:43,710 --> 02:54:44,770
If you can make it one of the pals at the base.

5083
02:54:44,910 --> 02:54:45,110
Yeah.

5084
02:54:45,330 --> 02:54:45,990
I'll grab it.

5085
02:54:46,330 --> 02:54:47,130
Thank you.

5086
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:48,150
Fuck is a bam worm.

5087
02:54:49,610 --> 02:54:50,850
It's a pocha berry.

5088
02:54:53,470 --> 02:54:53,870
Boom.

5089
02:54:55,750 --> 02:54:58,750
Okay I hope for now we have enough rock.

5090
02:55:00,910 --> 02:55:02,310
We have 800 rock.

5091
02:55:02,430 --> 02:55:04,410
It's gonna have to amount to something right?

5092
02:55:04,470 --> 02:55:05,310
Has to be.

5093
02:55:06,130 --> 02:55:07,010
Has to be.

5094
02:55:07,030 --> 02:55:09,410
We must be able to get something out of it.

5095
02:55:10,170 --> 02:55:11,130
Oh sh...

5096
02:55:12,910 --> 02:55:17,090
So I killed those two bam worms and I never found any left or not.

5097
02:55:17,350 --> 02:55:17,410
No.

5098
02:55:19,530 --> 02:55:20,010
Please.

5099
02:55:21,330 --> 02:55:22,010
Let's see.

5100
02:55:22,170 --> 02:55:23,290
These are kinda useless.

5101
02:55:24,690 --> 02:55:25,630
Can I replace?

5102
02:55:26,270 --> 02:55:27,750
Boss is somewhere around here.

5103
02:55:28,690 --> 02:55:29,710
Oh the bees!

5104
02:55:30,490 --> 02:55:31,570
Oh wait no nevermind.

5105
02:55:31,590 --> 02:55:32,790
Oh wait there's an azerope right here.

5106
02:55:32,850 --> 02:55:32,990
Just kidding.

5107
02:55:33,090 --> 02:55:33,490
Fuck.

5108
02:55:34,130 --> 02:55:35,310
Yeah that's the one.

5109
02:55:36,490 --> 02:55:36,970
Fuck.

5110
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:37,890
Oh there it is.

5111
02:55:37,930 --> 02:55:38,770
BAM WORM!

5112
02:55:40,150 --> 02:55:40,770
Get em!

5113
02:55:42,670 --> 02:55:43,150
Go!

5114
02:55:43,690 --> 02:55:44,650
Wait that's not mine.

5115
02:55:45,230 --> 02:55:45,850
There it is.

5116
02:55:46,390 --> 02:55:46,870
No.

5117
02:55:47,030 --> 02:55:48,210
No please don't.

5118
02:55:48,210 --> 02:55:49,430
Please don't shoot him.

5119
02:55:49,590 --> 02:55:50,230
Please don't.

5120
02:55:50,270 --> 02:55:50,390
No!

5121
02:55:53,890 --> 02:55:54,850
Stupid silly.

5122
02:55:54,990 --> 02:55:56,610
Fuck I'm gonna catch you.

5123
02:55:56,630 --> 02:55:58,290
I see we're doing amazing progress.

5124
02:56:00,210 --> 02:56:00,690
Yeah.

5125
02:56:00,830 --> 02:56:01,530
I caught another.

5126
02:56:01,690 --> 02:56:02,450
I'm gonna catch a human.

5127
02:56:05,370 --> 02:56:06,390
I'm gonna kill you though.

5128
02:56:06,410 --> 02:56:06,550
Shit.

5129
02:56:07,030 --> 02:56:07,310
No!

5130
02:56:07,410 --> 02:56:08,650
What the fuck are you doing?

5131
02:56:08,830 --> 02:56:09,250
My bad.

5132
02:56:09,330 --> 02:56:09,330
Come.

5133
02:56:09,530 --> 02:56:09,750
Make ore.

5134
02:56:09,750 --> 02:56:10,490
Alright I got two.

5135
02:56:10,590 --> 02:56:11,050
It's okay.

5136
02:56:11,130 --> 02:56:13,190
I got two syndicate thugs out of this.

5137
02:56:13,590 --> 02:56:17,610
I might not have got a van worm but I caught two syndicate thugs.

5138
02:56:19,630 --> 02:56:20,530
Make ore.

5139
02:56:21,470 --> 02:56:22,570
I'm so sad.

5140
02:56:22,810 --> 02:56:24,490
I just want a van worm.

5141
02:56:26,370 --> 02:56:27,670
Are you still in the van worm area?

5142
02:56:27,990 --> 02:56:28,310
Yes.

5143
02:56:28,850 --> 02:56:29,930
Yes I am.

5144
02:56:30,310 --> 02:56:30,970
Oh dear.

5145
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,320
They killed the only one I found.

5146
02:56:37,320 --> 02:56:38,820
Oh hey there's an electric egg.

5147
02:56:45,950 --> 02:56:46,470
Alright.

5148
02:56:47,130 --> 02:56:49,110
What do you mean my kneecaps are backwards?

5149
02:56:49,310 --> 02:56:49,930
What does that even mean?

5150
02:56:51,430 --> 02:56:52,910
What does that?

5151
02:56:52,990 --> 02:56:54,390
What kind of insult is that?

5152
02:56:54,890 --> 02:56:55,410
What?

5153
02:56:55,470 --> 02:56:55,790
What?

5154
02:56:56,010 --> 02:56:56,530
Hello?

5155
02:57:02,280 --> 02:57:03,520
Where are you?

5156
02:57:04,020 --> 02:57:05,180
Where are you?

5157
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:07,120
Please it's night time.

5158
02:57:12,490 --> 02:57:13,730
Okay it's time.

5159
02:57:16,650 --> 02:57:18,010
Please don't kill him.

5160
02:57:18,010 --> 02:57:19,250
Please.

5161
02:57:19,470 --> 02:57:20,710
That's all I ask.

5162
02:57:21,570 --> 02:57:25,190
Looking for a fast travel point over here.

5163
02:57:27,770 --> 02:57:28,390
Okay.

5164
02:57:28,390 --> 02:57:30,670
I'm gonna use my mega sphere.

5165
02:57:35,240 --> 02:57:36,340
Oh I got one!

5166
02:57:36,540 --> 02:57:37,260
I have five balls.

5167
02:57:37,340 --> 02:57:37,600
Wait.

5168
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:39,480
I got van worm!

5169
02:57:40,060 --> 02:57:40,680
Yay!

5170
02:57:40,760 --> 02:57:42,660
I have discovered flight!

5171
02:57:46,650 --> 02:57:47,270
GG.

5172
02:57:49,820 --> 02:57:50,670
Okay there you go.

5173
02:57:50,670 --> 02:57:52,130
I discovered flight.

5174
02:57:52,250 --> 02:57:54,490
Okay let me put the chillant for you.

5175
02:57:54,670 --> 02:57:54,930
Okay.

5176
02:57:55,570 --> 02:57:56,250
Thank you!

5177
02:57:56,510 --> 02:57:58,170
Uhhh chillant.

5178
02:57:58,910 --> 02:58:01,050
I replaced it with a life monk.

5179
02:58:01,050 --> 02:58:01,610
So is there a life monk over here?

5180
02:58:01,690 --> 02:58:01,930
Hold on.

5181
02:58:02,510 --> 02:58:03,310
Okay thanks.

5182
02:58:03,370 --> 02:58:06,170
And then or lift monk and then I'll put a van worm here.

5183
02:58:10,110 --> 02:58:11,070
And then...

5184
02:58:13,270 --> 02:58:14,030
That's fine.

5185
02:58:18,540 --> 02:58:19,280
Let's see.

5186
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:20,260
I need to make a...

5187
02:58:20,260 --> 02:58:21,300
Where's the pal craft?

5188
02:58:21,300 --> 02:58:22,200
Pal crafter.

5189
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:24,520
Pal crafter?

5190
02:58:24,620 --> 02:58:25,800
Yeah pal gear crafter.

5191
02:58:26,100 --> 02:58:26,720
I need to use it.

5192
02:58:26,740 --> 02:58:28,060
Oh uh you gotta remake it.

5193
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:28,500
Oh.

5194
02:58:30,580 --> 02:58:31,780
Alright let me...

5195
02:58:31,780 --> 02:58:32,760
Wait do I have it right?

5196
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:34,660
It's right here but I'm using it.

5197
02:58:34,780 --> 02:58:35,420
Oh it is?

5198
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:36,240
Where are you?

5199
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:36,760
Oh there you are.

5200
02:58:36,860 --> 02:58:37,180
Okay.

5201
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:39,600
What are you making?

5202
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:40,420
I'm gonna help too.

5203
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:41,880
Thank you.

5204
02:58:43,360 --> 02:58:44,460
We'll all work together.

5205
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:50,200
We're all gonna work together.

5206
02:58:51,320 --> 02:58:52,200
We got this.

5207
02:58:52,420 --> 02:58:53,220
We can do this.

5208
02:58:54,760 --> 02:58:57,000
We're all in this together.

5209
02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:02,180
Okay I'm gonna go kill the... I'm gonna go catch the azerob.

5210
02:59:04,460 --> 02:59:06,840
Actually what's... how much time do we have left actually?

5211
02:59:06,960 --> 02:59:07,320
One hour.

5212
02:59:07,480 --> 02:59:08,620
I think I have an hour mark.

5213
02:59:08,680 --> 02:59:10,460
We gotta like speed run some captures.

5214
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:10,660
Yeah we gotta do shit.

5215
02:59:10,780 --> 02:59:10,920
Yeah.

5216
02:59:12,700 --> 02:59:14,400
We're at an hour and a half.

5217
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:18,300
Once I make my pistol like speed run capture shit.

5218
02:59:19,300 --> 02:59:20,100
Oh shit.

5219
02:59:20,180 --> 02:59:20,360
Hey.

5220
02:59:20,960 --> 02:59:21,400
Yeah.

5221
02:59:21,860 --> 02:59:22,300
Okay.

5222
02:59:22,300 --> 02:59:24,280
Alright now I'm gonna make my saddle.

5223
02:59:25,960 --> 02:59:28,200
Where the fuck is the vanworm's saddle?

5224
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:29,780
We need spears.

5225
02:59:30,220 --> 02:59:30,700
No!

5226
02:59:31,160 --> 02:59:31,920
There it is.

5227
02:59:31,960 --> 02:59:33,080
Oh I just made it.

5228
02:59:33,100 --> 02:59:33,480
Don't let me die here.

5229
02:59:33,500 --> 02:59:34,540
Come on dude.

5230
02:59:34,900 --> 02:59:35,840
Not here.

5231
02:59:37,340 --> 02:59:37,920
I need ingots.

5232
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:37,940
No!

5233
02:59:39,300 --> 02:59:40,760
Okay I need...

5234
02:59:41,500 --> 02:59:42,400
Not you.

5235
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:43,800
My quest for vanworm also ends early.

5236
02:59:44,220 --> 02:59:45,000
Not you.

5237
02:59:45,580 --> 02:59:46,450
Not you.

5238
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:48,500
No!

5239
02:59:48,580 --> 02:59:50,060
Where the fuck is our fire?

5240
02:59:50,240 --> 02:59:51,700
Where the fuck are our fire ones?

5241
02:59:51,880 --> 02:59:52,280
I don't know.

5242
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:54,080
Where's our fire?

5243
02:59:54,080 --> 02:59:56,120
Let's see.

5244
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:01,020
Just trust the process man!

5245
03:00:01,080 --> 03:00:01,460
It's okay!

5246
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:03,240
Just trust the process!

5247
03:00:03,540 --> 03:00:04,460
Just trust the process!

5248
03:00:05,780 --> 03:00:06,260
No!

5249
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:10,880
When you keep saying trust the process, I'm starting to trust the process less and less.

5250
03:00:14,580 --> 03:00:16,940
That's when you gotta trust the process even more.

5251
03:00:17,400 --> 03:00:18,880
Wait, does vanworm do fire?

5252
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:20,060
Oh shit it does!

5253
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:21,200
Get out of here.

5254
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:22,280
I didn't even realize that.

5255
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:23,720
Guys, the bad ones are fire.

5256
03:00:23,780 --> 03:00:24,720
I don't give a fuck about you.

5257
03:00:26,820 --> 03:00:27,740
What kind of fire?

5258
03:00:27,900 --> 03:00:28,940
What level fire is it?

5259
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:32,220
It's level 1, but our other ones aren't kindling it right now.

5260
03:00:37,430 --> 03:00:38,690
Alright, do your thing.

5261
03:00:38,830 --> 03:00:39,190
I need...

5262
03:00:39,750 --> 03:00:40,830
Who's hungry over there?

5263
03:00:41,430 --> 03:00:42,270
Oh, it's Eepie.

5264
03:00:43,850 --> 03:00:44,650
It's Eepie.

5265
03:00:45,010 --> 03:00:46,070
It's Eepie.

5266
03:00:46,110 --> 03:00:46,870
I thought I was stuck.

5267
03:00:47,090 --> 03:00:48,570
Because I kept seeing it was hungry.

5268
03:00:48,790 --> 03:00:50,170
I'm like, man, then go eat something!

5269
03:00:51,150 --> 03:00:52,590
This fucking neat forehead!

5270
03:00:52,590 --> 03:00:55,010
Wait, what level is the chillit saddle on?

5271
03:00:57,450 --> 03:00:58,390
Am I blind?

5272
03:00:59,010 --> 03:01:00,170
Where's the chillit saddle?

5273
03:01:00,310 --> 03:01:04,170
I need like six more ingots if anyone has extra.

5274
03:01:06,430 --> 03:01:08,210
If I can make my van more sadder.

5275
03:01:08,890 --> 03:01:14,910
Wait, do I get the XP for capture if I direct pallets into my bar I haven't captured yet?

5276
03:01:16,450 --> 03:01:18,510
I think no, you don't get the capture rate, right?

5277
03:01:18,770 --> 03:01:19,670
You don't get it.

5278
03:01:20,230 --> 03:01:21,010
Let me see.

5279
03:01:21,050 --> 03:01:22,110
Let me grab this one.

5280
03:01:22,150 --> 03:01:22,570
I might see it.

5281
03:01:22,590 --> 03:01:23,490
Very slowly.

5282
03:01:24,730 --> 03:01:25,610
Very slowly.

5283
03:01:28,870 --> 03:01:29,350
Nope.

5284
03:01:29,350 --> 03:01:30,150
I do not.

5285
03:01:30,230 --> 03:01:30,550
Fuck.

5286
03:01:31,070 --> 03:01:33,370
If you don't trust us, you don't believe in us.

5287
03:01:33,490 --> 03:01:33,970
You're not real.

5288
03:01:34,070 --> 03:01:34,890
You're not true ones.

5289
03:01:35,290 --> 03:01:36,150
Yeah, what the hell?

5290
03:01:36,250 --> 03:01:37,950
How can you not trust this process?

5291
03:01:38,050 --> 03:01:38,530
It's flawless.

5292
03:01:38,790 --> 03:01:40,630
Do you not see our long game here?

5293
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:41,250
I know.

5294
03:01:41,390 --> 03:01:43,310
This is all... like, we're not doing short term here.

5295
03:01:43,430 --> 03:01:45,190
We're all... we have long term goals.

5296
03:01:45,590 --> 03:01:46,070
Yeah.

5297
03:01:47,390 --> 03:01:50,510
We've worked really hard towards this goal.

5298
03:01:50,790 --> 03:01:51,270
Exactly.

5299
03:01:51,270 --> 03:01:51,650
Exactly.

5300
03:01:52,950 --> 03:01:53,570
Tell him.

5301
03:01:55,690 --> 03:01:58,490
Alright, please be fast, you're a van worm, so I can ride you.

5302
03:01:59,110 --> 03:01:59,510
Please.

5303
03:02:00,570 --> 03:02:02,590
I need, like, two more.

5304
03:02:04,250 --> 03:02:05,550
I need one more.

5305
03:02:06,350 --> 03:02:06,750
Blow!

5306
03:02:08,350 --> 03:02:09,410
Wait, where's the palegirl?

5307
03:02:09,730 --> 03:02:10,550
Palegir bench now?

5308
03:02:10,690 --> 03:02:11,570
Oh, is that one over there?

5309
03:02:12,930 --> 03:02:13,750
No, that's repair.

5310
03:02:13,970 --> 03:02:14,530
Oh, wait, there it is.

5311
03:02:14,570 --> 03:02:14,830
Nice.

5312
03:02:14,850 --> 03:02:15,670
Okay, I finally...

5313
03:02:15,670 --> 03:02:17,610
Right, I died a lot for this win.

5314
03:02:17,730 --> 03:02:18,410
Like, come on, man.

5315
03:02:18,470 --> 03:02:18,790
No!

5316
03:02:21,270 --> 03:02:21,650
Oh, shit!

5317
03:02:24,030 --> 03:02:25,310
I'm sorry, can I help you?

5318
03:02:26,970 --> 03:02:28,450
Okay, I don't think... I don't think we...

5319
03:02:28,450 --> 03:02:28,470
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were alive.

5320
03:02:29,690 --> 03:02:32,250
Okay, thank god.

5321
03:02:32,310 --> 03:02:34,810
Okay, now I can... I can make it now.

5322
03:02:37,650 --> 03:02:39,190
My fucking saddle.

5323
03:02:44,510 --> 03:02:45,470
Oh, Pen King!

5324
03:02:46,190 --> 03:02:47,130
Fuck yeah, alright.

5325
03:02:47,310 --> 03:02:48,690
Alright, do we get... we got Pen King?

5326
03:02:49,210 --> 03:02:49,610
Yeah.

5327
03:02:50,210 --> 03:02:50,830
Oh, we did it!

5328
03:02:50,990 --> 03:02:51,790
Did you get it?

5329
03:02:52,090 --> 03:02:52,490
Yeah.

5330
03:02:53,830 --> 03:02:54,910
Did you see it, Sad?

5331
03:02:55,010 --> 03:02:55,650
Did you see it?

5332
03:02:55,970 --> 03:02:57,730
Oh, wait, no, we didn't beat Pen King.

5333
03:02:57,990 --> 03:02:58,850
We hatched Pen King.

5334
03:02:59,230 --> 03:02:59,630
Very different.

5335
03:02:59,630 --> 03:03:00,790
Oh, we had to capture it.

5336
03:03:00,790 --> 03:03:01,490
No, that's different.

5337
03:03:01,830 --> 03:03:02,370
Very different.

5338
03:03:02,370 --> 03:03:03,330
That's very different.

5339
03:03:03,610 --> 03:03:05,250
I was gonna be like, sure, I did it!

5340
03:03:05,750 --> 03:03:09,530
I can probably go fight Pen King now if he's respawned.

5341
03:03:09,930 --> 03:03:11,010
He's probably respawned.

5342
03:03:11,030 --> 03:03:11,710
He probably is.

5343
03:03:11,790 --> 03:03:12,810
It's been, like, two hours.

5344
03:03:13,070 --> 03:03:15,070
He's probably... It's only been almost three hours.

5345
03:03:15,150 --> 03:03:16,090
He's probably back.

5346
03:03:16,770 --> 03:03:17,170
Yeah?

5347
03:03:18,010 --> 03:03:18,210
Yeah.

5348
03:03:18,210 --> 03:03:19,290
Is there a hatching list?

5349
03:03:19,410 --> 03:03:20,850
There's no hatching list, I'm pretty sure.

5350
03:03:21,090 --> 03:03:21,550
Is there?

5351
03:03:21,710 --> 03:03:21,910
No.

5352
03:03:22,250 --> 03:03:22,650
No?

5353
03:03:22,650 --> 03:03:23,170
I don't know.

5354
03:03:23,230 --> 03:03:25,010
I don't think there's an achievement for hatching.

5355
03:03:25,610 --> 03:03:29,090
There's only four things we need to hatch that give us...

5356
03:03:29,090 --> 03:03:29,870
Don't touch that!

5357
03:03:30,790 --> 03:03:31,190
...achievements.

5358
03:03:31,230 --> 03:03:31,850
What is it?

5359
03:03:33,550 --> 03:03:35,170
Anubis, something, something, something, something.

5360
03:03:35,270 --> 03:03:36,170
I thought that was for breeding.

5361
03:03:36,510 --> 03:03:36,950
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5362
03:03:36,950 --> 03:03:37,430
Or unless that counts.

5363
03:03:38,870 --> 03:03:41,830
Anubis, I know you can do even from early game, but I'm...

5364
03:03:41,830 --> 03:03:45,290
Yeah, you need the fat green guy and the queen bee.

5365
03:03:46,130 --> 03:03:47,350
Okay, small settlement.

5366
03:03:48,730 --> 03:03:51,130
Where the fuck did I see the azer... oh, there it is.

5367
03:03:51,250 --> 03:03:53,750
Are you going to get the azerope, or am I getting the azerope?

5368
03:03:54,010 --> 03:03:55,290
I have to go pick up my stuff.

5369
03:03:55,530 --> 03:03:56,850
If you get there first, then you can get the azerope.

5370
03:03:56,850 --> 03:03:57,990
Okay, I'll get the azerope then.

5371
03:03:58,110 --> 03:03:58,370
Help.

5372
03:03:59,590 --> 03:04:00,830
Oh, dude, the azerope.

5373
03:04:01,390 --> 03:04:05,090
I'm having a clerical error right now where I can't seem to... oh, shit.

5374
03:04:05,650 --> 03:04:07,130
I can't seem to stay alive.

5375
03:04:07,330 --> 03:04:07,450
Whoa!

5376
03:04:07,810 --> 03:04:08,210
Shiny!

5377
03:04:09,590 --> 03:04:10,850
Oh, second shiny!

5378
03:04:11,150 --> 03:04:11,730
Extra points.

5379
03:04:13,810 --> 03:04:14,210
Whoa!

5380
03:04:14,370 --> 03:04:15,930
He, like, spawned next to me!

5381
03:04:18,890 --> 03:04:19,270
Ow.

5382
03:04:19,310 --> 03:04:20,070
What shiny is it?

5383
03:04:20,250 --> 03:04:20,890
The fuck?

5384
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:23,150
Oh, shiny fuck.

5385
03:04:23,330 --> 03:04:23,830
Love it.

5386
03:04:25,750 --> 03:04:27,450
I was like, what am I hearing?

5387
03:04:29,170 --> 03:04:29,810
Oh, shit.

5388
03:04:29,890 --> 03:04:32,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I might die.

5389
03:04:32,210 --> 03:04:32,410
No!

5390
03:04:33,190 --> 03:04:34,810
Please, please, let me catch you.

5391
03:04:35,050 --> 03:04:36,170
Please, please.

5392
03:04:37,130 --> 03:04:37,670
Clip it!

5393
03:04:37,790 --> 03:04:38,350
Clip it!

5394
03:04:38,430 --> 03:04:38,970
I got him!

5395
03:04:39,530 --> 03:04:39,910
Yay!

5396
03:04:39,950 --> 03:04:40,850
I got him!

5397
03:04:41,090 --> 03:04:41,410
Yay!

5398
03:04:43,970 --> 03:04:44,590
That's fine.

5399
03:04:45,230 --> 03:04:46,250
I got the fuck.

5400
03:04:47,390 --> 03:04:49,930
And I died next to the respawn beacon.

5401
03:04:50,210 --> 03:04:51,030
I knew you could do it.

5402
03:04:51,510 --> 03:04:52,590
It was worth it.

5403
03:04:52,690 --> 03:04:53,610
Oh, what the fuck was that?

5404
03:04:53,750 --> 03:04:54,070
Boom.

5405
03:04:55,830 --> 03:04:56,570
What was that?

5406
03:04:56,790 --> 03:04:57,510
What was that?

5407
03:04:57,670 --> 03:04:57,890
What was that?

5408
03:04:58,050 --> 03:04:59,370
I leveled up.

5409
03:05:00,310 --> 03:05:02,550
I'm finally managing to kill stuff.

5410
03:05:02,650 --> 03:05:03,490
Oh, finally.

5411
03:05:03,830 --> 03:05:04,950
You're strong enough.

5412
03:05:06,370 --> 03:05:07,850
I'm trying, man.

5413
03:05:10,170 --> 03:05:10,850
I'm here.

5414
03:05:12,090 --> 03:05:12,570
Nice.

5415
03:05:12,670 --> 03:05:15,670
I can't figure out the rhythm to dodge abilities.

5416
03:05:16,210 --> 03:05:16,730
Oh, yeah.

5417
03:05:16,730 --> 03:05:18,370
Because you have to figure out 200.

5418
03:05:18,850 --> 03:05:23,130
Yeah, but I feel like my ping isn't consistently high either.

5419
03:05:23,310 --> 03:05:25,230
Because sometimes I'm like, okay, you know what?

5420
03:05:25,330 --> 03:05:26,290
I think I figured it.

5421
03:05:26,330 --> 03:05:28,870
If I just dodge earlier, then sometimes it's too early.

5422
03:05:28,990 --> 03:05:29,510
I'm like, what?

5423
03:05:29,550 --> 03:05:29,810
How?

5424
03:05:31,550 --> 03:05:33,150
You'll never figure it out.

5425
03:05:33,350 --> 03:05:35,430
You'll always be guessing.

5426
03:05:38,430 --> 03:05:39,090
All right.

5427
03:05:39,110 --> 03:05:39,670
Let's see.

5428
03:05:40,010 --> 03:05:42,590
But if it's far below me, I don't care.

5429
03:05:42,850 --> 03:05:43,790
I can get heat.

5430
03:05:44,010 --> 03:05:44,670
All right.

5431
03:05:44,970 --> 03:05:45,770
Are you getting...

5432
03:05:45,770 --> 03:05:46,030
Oh, wait.

5433
03:05:46,070 --> 03:05:47,270
Are you getting the Azeroth now?

5434
03:05:47,510 --> 03:05:47,870
Or...

5435
03:05:48,630 --> 03:05:49,730
I'm still picking up my gear.

5436
03:05:50,030 --> 03:05:50,370
All right.

5437
03:05:50,670 --> 03:05:51,650
I'll go grab it now.

5438
03:05:51,830 --> 03:05:53,170
God, this serpent is stupid slow.

5439
03:05:53,310 --> 03:05:58,190
I wanted to use the chillit, but since I haven't caught one, it doesn't show up in my saddle list.

5440
03:05:58,230 --> 03:05:59,110
Oh, you have?

5441
03:05:59,330 --> 03:05:59,690
Okay.

5442
03:05:59,890 --> 03:06:00,490
That sucks.

5443
03:06:00,850 --> 03:06:01,090
Rip.

5444
03:06:01,370 --> 03:06:02,210
It does suck.

5445
03:06:02,490 --> 03:06:03,050
All right.

5446
03:06:03,110 --> 03:06:03,470
Rip.

5447
03:06:04,130 --> 03:06:05,410
Now I can kill you.

5448
03:06:08,390 --> 03:06:09,150
Where is it?

5449
03:06:09,330 --> 03:06:09,710
All right.

5450
03:06:11,710 --> 03:06:12,650
Oh, I went the wrong way.

5451
03:06:12,690 --> 03:06:12,950
Fuck.

5452
03:06:12,990 --> 03:06:14,170
I keep going the wrong way.

5453
03:06:14,710 --> 03:06:15,370
Oh, dizzy.

5454
03:06:15,610 --> 03:06:16,290
I'm gonna get this one.

5455
03:06:18,750 --> 03:06:19,530
I'm flying.

5456
03:06:20,670 --> 03:06:21,550
I'm soaring.

5457
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:26,200
What the...

5458
03:06:27,560 --> 03:06:28,200
Oh, shit.

5459
03:06:29,380 --> 03:06:30,040
No, stop.

5460
03:06:30,780 --> 03:06:31,700
I don't want to die.

5461
03:06:31,940 --> 03:06:32,500
All right.

5462
03:06:32,520 --> 03:06:33,040
Kill my pal.

5463
03:06:33,380 --> 03:06:34,320
He can take it.

5464
03:06:34,400 --> 03:06:34,460
Here we go.

5465
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:37,820
This way.

5466
03:06:39,940 --> 03:06:41,720
No, I didn't forget about the reincarnate.

5467
03:06:41,820 --> 03:06:42,860
I literally marked him.

5468
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:44,480
Don't worry, chat.

5469
03:06:44,780 --> 03:06:45,900
Yeah, we could do those group votes.

5470
03:06:45,900 --> 03:06:46,800
A photo's easy.

5471
03:06:47,100 --> 03:06:48,180
Yeah, it's just a photo.

5472
03:06:48,300 --> 03:06:48,400
Yes.

5473
03:06:48,700 --> 03:06:54,060
Wait, do we have a camera option or, like, does photo mean like we just take a screenshot of it?

5474
03:06:54,200 --> 03:06:54,320
What?

5475
03:06:54,820 --> 03:06:55,500
I don't know.

5476
03:06:55,700 --> 03:06:58,260
I'm sure a clip will do just fine.

5477
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:00,740
There he is.

5478
03:07:01,300 --> 03:07:01,660
Azeroth.

5479
03:07:05,240 --> 03:07:05,600
Ouch.

5480
03:07:09,470 --> 03:07:11,350
Dude, I don't know what to tell you, man.

5481
03:07:11,410 --> 03:07:13,190
My balls just fly through the wood.

5482
03:07:13,270 --> 03:07:13,990
What am I doing?

5483
03:07:15,510 --> 03:07:17,050
Your balls are just too smooth.

5484
03:07:17,110 --> 03:07:17,250
Yeah.

5485
03:07:17,270 --> 03:07:21,270
Oh my god!

5486
03:07:21,550 --> 03:07:25,890
I got hit there!

5487
03:07:25,950 --> 03:07:26,130
How?

5488
03:07:28,890 --> 03:07:30,510
I'm having ball troubles.

5489
03:07:31,150 --> 03:07:31,870
Oh no!

5490
03:07:32,090 --> 03:07:32,770
Not the ball!

5491
03:07:33,090 --> 03:07:33,810
No!

5492
03:07:34,050 --> 03:07:34,530
Please!

5493
03:07:35,130 --> 03:07:36,270
Please don't!

5494
03:07:36,490 --> 03:07:37,550
Don't kill me!

5495
03:07:37,590 --> 03:07:37,950
Please!

5496
03:07:39,330 --> 03:07:40,810
How am I missing?

5497
03:07:43,910 --> 03:07:44,390
Okay.

5498
03:07:44,590 --> 03:07:46,430
I gotta focus on dodging now.

5499
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:51,660
Please, Crintail.

5500
03:07:52,100 --> 03:07:53,240
For the love of god.

5501
03:07:53,500 --> 03:07:53,980
No!

5502
03:07:55,460 --> 03:07:56,660
You killed him!

5503
03:07:56,760 --> 03:07:57,600
How could you?

5504
03:07:58,540 --> 03:08:00,020
Will you kill the boss?

5505
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:02,580
No, my Van Wurm.

5506
03:08:02,680 --> 03:08:03,740
I was like, really?

5507
03:08:03,900 --> 03:08:05,100
I was about to catch him.

5508
03:08:05,260 --> 03:08:06,440
And then my Pal...

5509
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:09,180
My Pal went a little bit murder-y.

5510
03:08:09,440 --> 03:08:10,020
It's okay.

5511
03:08:10,140 --> 03:08:10,980
I know how that feels.

5512
03:08:11,580 --> 03:08:12,920
No, the Van Wurm.

5513
03:08:13,560 --> 03:08:14,240
Oh, okay.

5514
03:08:14,560 --> 03:08:15,540
So, thank god.

5515
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:16,520
We still have the Pen King.

5516
03:08:16,520 --> 03:08:19,200
Even if we kill the boss now, we can still retry.

5517
03:08:19,340 --> 03:08:20,040
We have like...

5518
03:08:20,040 --> 03:08:21,800
Yeah, but they respawned though.

5519
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:22,300
Yeah.

5520
03:08:24,520 --> 03:08:27,500
So, worst case, if we try now, we can try again in like an hour.

5521
03:08:29,340 --> 03:08:29,660
Woo!

5522
03:08:29,940 --> 03:08:30,260
Woo!

5523
03:08:30,380 --> 03:08:30,640
Woo!

5524
03:08:31,720 --> 03:08:32,920
Bro, I keep dying!

5525
03:08:33,040 --> 03:08:33,300
Why?

5526
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:34,400
Please!

5527
03:08:41,100 --> 03:08:42,260
No more catching pals.

5528
03:08:42,320 --> 03:08:42,920
Only killing Pal.

5529
03:08:43,800 --> 03:08:44,860
My new motto.

5530
03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:47,080
Oh, I could get this human.

5531
03:08:47,200 --> 03:08:48,140
He's only level 4.

5532
03:08:48,840 --> 03:08:49,760
I might get killed.

5533
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:51,800
How many more do we need for humans?

5534
03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:52,880
Give him a new home.

5535
03:08:52,880 --> 03:08:53,940
Cause I have 4 on me.

5536
03:08:54,820 --> 03:08:56,380
You have 4 on you?

5537
03:08:56,500 --> 03:08:56,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5538
03:08:58,900 --> 03:09:02,020
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

5539
03:09:02,280 --> 03:09:03,000
I have 6 humans.

5540
03:09:03,120 --> 03:09:03,960
We need 20 in total.

5541
03:09:04,980 --> 03:09:06,680
Where's the weapons workbench at?

5542
03:09:07,300 --> 03:09:08,460
I don't think we have one.

5543
03:09:08,860 --> 03:09:09,600
We did.

5544
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:10,140
Oh, we did?

5545
03:09:10,240 --> 03:09:10,500
Oh, yeah.

5546
03:09:10,500 --> 03:09:12,280
We disassembled it.

5547
03:09:12,940 --> 03:09:13,260
We got it.

5548
03:09:14,620 --> 03:09:15,660
I need 3 nails.

5549
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:17,100
Rintel, no!

5550
03:09:17,180 --> 03:09:17,720
You're drowning!

5551
03:09:18,980 --> 03:09:19,740
I can make nails.

5552
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:21,620
I can make some too.

5553
03:09:21,960 --> 03:09:22,760
I'm just wondering.

5554
03:09:25,140 --> 03:09:26,740
Take this from me, sweeper!

5555
03:09:27,240 --> 03:09:27,980
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

5556
03:09:29,320 --> 03:09:30,040
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

5557
03:09:31,400 --> 03:09:32,220
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

5558
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:37,400
I'm just killing these humans and this god is just like, whatever, bro.

5559
03:09:38,360 --> 03:09:39,000
You do you.

5560
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:40,020
Yes!

5561
03:09:40,220 --> 03:09:40,580
Okay.

5562
03:09:41,080 --> 03:09:41,560
That's fine.

5563
03:09:42,940 --> 03:09:43,260
55.

5564
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:44,960
Where are you going?

5565
03:09:45,020 --> 03:09:45,220
Stop.

5566
03:09:46,480 --> 03:09:46,920
Azeroth!

5567
03:09:47,200 --> 03:09:47,600
Done!

5568
03:09:47,780 --> 03:09:48,300
I got another!

5569
03:09:49,160 --> 03:09:49,860
Clip, clip, clip!

5570
03:09:50,940 --> 03:09:51,960
I got Azeroth!

5571
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:54,380
Alright, what do I need to do to make those bear traps?

5572
03:09:54,620 --> 03:09:56,040
I think I should go catch those...

5573
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:57,380
The lamb balls?

5574
03:09:57,760 --> 03:09:58,360
Lamb balls.

5575
03:09:59,460 --> 03:10:01,080
There's nothing in those cages.

5576
03:10:01,360 --> 03:10:02,440
Bear trap, I need ingots.

5577
03:10:02,660 --> 03:10:03,660
Alright, we can make ingots.

5578
03:10:04,060 --> 03:10:10,080
We got Azeroth, Rintel, Wait, did we get the doom mod already?

5579
03:10:10,680 --> 03:10:11,460
Oh, doom mod.

5580
03:10:11,540 --> 03:10:13,020
Oh, I'm gonna go fucking get the doom mod.

5581
03:10:13,080 --> 03:10:13,460
Fuck this.

5582
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:14,920
I should be able to make it.

5583
03:10:16,680 --> 03:10:17,440
We're sleeping?

5584
03:10:17,700 --> 03:10:18,860
Yeah, make something easy target.

5585
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:19,420
What do you mean?

5586
03:10:19,800 --> 03:10:20,200
Alright.

5587
03:10:20,600 --> 03:10:22,260
I need to figure out where doom mod is.

5588
03:10:26,340 --> 03:10:27,580
Get those points.

5589
03:10:28,660 --> 03:10:29,960
Lamb balls are struggling.

5590
03:10:30,080 --> 03:10:31,280
I know, I know.

5591
03:10:32,220 --> 03:10:32,620
I'm kidding.

5592
03:10:33,800 --> 03:10:35,120
Lamb balls are struggling.

5593
03:10:35,300 --> 03:10:35,660
I know.

5594
03:10:38,460 --> 03:10:40,100
Always play Struggle City.

5595
03:10:40,360 --> 03:10:40,680
Bye!

5596
03:10:42,120 --> 03:10:43,100
I'm talking about my balls.

5597
03:10:43,160 --> 03:10:45,340
I'm having performance anxiety.

5598
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:47,580
The balls are getting smaller.

5599
03:10:50,260 --> 03:10:51,400
They're shriveling up.

5600
03:10:51,400 --> 03:10:52,540
They're turning to marbles.

5601
03:10:54,060 --> 03:10:55,420
You're not helping chat.

5602
03:10:58,100 --> 03:10:59,440
You're making them nervous.

5603
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,840
Chat, say something negative about your balls.

5604
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:03,800
It'll make us feel better.

5605
03:11:08,280 --> 03:11:09,760
You caused this problem.

5606
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:10,480
You have to fix it.

5607
03:11:12,300 --> 03:11:13,240
Take your responsibility.

5608
03:11:14,280 --> 03:11:15,480
Okay, let's see.

5609
03:11:15,640 --> 03:11:16,860
I need to...

5610
03:11:16,860 --> 03:11:18,060
What do I need to do?

5611
03:11:18,520 --> 03:11:20,980
I swear, I don't usually struggle like this.

5612
03:11:21,260 --> 03:11:26,180
What the fuck is Doom mod?

5613
03:11:26,920 --> 03:11:27,780
Where's my...

5614
03:11:27,780 --> 03:11:29,340
Where's my Google maps?

5615
03:11:32,180 --> 03:11:34,120
Doom mod, ice, frost...

5616
03:11:35,280 --> 03:11:38,640
They spelled one of the boss's names wrong.

5617
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:40,120
Oh, it's here.

5618
03:11:40,460 --> 03:11:42,100
They spelled one of the boss's names wrong.

5619
03:11:42,120 --> 03:11:43,140
Yeah, it's like DOOMBUD.

5620
03:11:44,400 --> 03:11:45,760
Okay, I know where to go.

5621
03:11:45,860 --> 03:11:46,020
Okay.

5622
03:11:46,180 --> 03:11:48,800
I'm gonna fucking just ride all the way there.

5623
03:11:49,740 --> 03:11:52,180
Okay, I'm gonna steal your gigasphere.

5624
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:52,980
This is gonna be important.

5625
03:11:54,460 --> 03:11:56,620
Whoever's gigasphere is this, I'm stealing it.

5626
03:11:56,700 --> 03:11:56,960
Take it.

5627
03:11:57,220 --> 03:11:58,160
Hey, what the fuck?

5628
03:11:59,440 --> 03:12:00,860
It wasn't even yours!

5629
03:12:02,020 --> 03:12:03,280
What do you mean it's not mine?

5630
03:12:03,500 --> 03:12:04,480
I know it wasn't yours.

5631
03:12:05,200 --> 03:12:06,300
I literally made it.

5632
03:12:06,340 --> 03:12:07,200
No, it wasn't.

5633
03:12:07,700 --> 03:12:09,040
Oh captain, my captain.

5634
03:12:12,120 --> 03:12:13,500
I don't think it was yours.

5635
03:12:14,440 --> 03:12:15,120
It's okay.

5636
03:12:15,340 --> 03:12:16,800
Maybe I just won't kill any bosses.

5637
03:12:17,180 --> 03:12:18,060
Wait, okay.

5638
03:12:18,280 --> 03:12:19,000
Wait, I'm stuck.

5639
03:12:19,260 --> 03:12:20,080
What the fuck?

5640
03:12:20,160 --> 03:12:21,080
My Vanworm was stuck.

5641
03:12:21,420 --> 03:12:22,420
Oh, there you go.

5642
03:12:23,140 --> 03:12:24,720
Vanworm, where are you?

5643
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:26,940
My Vanworm is like, crooked.

5644
03:12:27,180 --> 03:12:28,920
My Vanworm's slanted.

5645
03:12:29,440 --> 03:12:30,880
I'm back to mining to meet.

5646
03:12:30,880 --> 03:12:32,100
My Vanworm is bent.

5647
03:12:32,760 --> 03:12:34,220
Guys, stop looking!

5648
03:12:34,540 --> 03:12:35,580
My Vanworm's slanted.

5649
03:12:35,580 --> 03:12:36,140
Stop looking.

5650
03:12:36,400 --> 03:12:36,700
Stop!

5651
03:12:38,320 --> 03:12:39,940
He's trying his best, okay?

5652
03:12:40,100 --> 03:12:40,840
Leave him alone.

5653
03:12:42,880 --> 03:12:44,560
He couldn't handle the thighs.

5654
03:12:46,320 --> 03:12:47,900
Okay, did you guys get- I'm not a good day.

5655
03:12:47,900 --> 03:12:48,400
I'm gonna get the pen king.

5656
03:12:48,580 --> 03:12:48,980
Fuck this.

5657
03:12:49,180 --> 03:12:50,120
He's like, right here anyway.

5658
03:12:50,440 --> 03:12:50,760
Yeah,

5659
03:12:56,300 --> 03:12:58,360
they usually slant to one side.

5660
03:13:03,440 --> 03:13:06,960
You seem like an expert to slanted Vanworms.

5661
03:13:09,460 --> 03:13:10,300
Oh, I'm hungry.

5662
03:13:10,560 --> 03:13:11,220
Fuck, okay.

5663
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:13,360
I don't wanna fight them.

5664
03:13:13,580 --> 03:13:13,980
Alright.

5665
03:13:15,120 --> 03:13:17,240
I'm gonna go back to... I'm gonna build bear traps.

5666
03:13:22,820 --> 03:13:23,180
Nice.

5667
03:13:24,100 --> 03:13:25,060
How many ink do I need?

5668
03:13:25,160 --> 03:13:25,760
I need...

5669
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:27,760
How many... wait, was it ten or five?

5670
03:13:27,880 --> 03:13:28,720
Wait, I have no more crap.

5671
03:13:28,940 --> 03:13:31,160
How did... I already used 93 arrows?

5672
03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:33,900
Oh no, I actually put away some of my arrows.

5673
03:13:33,980 --> 03:13:34,280
Money's tight.

5674
03:13:35,660 --> 03:13:36,580
I can check.

5675
03:13:36,700 --> 03:13:37,420
I can check the list.

5676
03:13:37,580 --> 03:13:40,560
If anybody knows offhand though, how many land balls...

5677
03:13:40,560 --> 03:13:41,400
How many land balls?

5678
03:13:41,480 --> 03:13:42,220
Was it five or ten?

5679
03:13:42,300 --> 03:13:42,500
Five.

5680
03:13:42,520 --> 03:13:42,660
Five.

5681
03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:44,340
I need to capture five at the same time.

5682
03:13:44,840 --> 03:13:45,200
Easy.

5683
03:13:46,500 --> 03:13:46,940
Easy.

5684
03:13:46,940 --> 03:13:49,020
Wait, what do they mean by at the same time?

5685
03:13:49,140 --> 03:13:49,740
Means like...

5686
03:13:50,400 --> 03:13:51,380
In the same trap?

5687
03:13:51,980 --> 03:13:52,920
Wait, I actually don't know.

5688
03:13:53,180 --> 03:13:54,620
Can someone like clarify that?

5689
03:13:54,640 --> 03:13:56,800
Wait, I think we just make five traps.

5690
03:13:57,120 --> 03:13:58,340
And we like trap five.

5691
03:13:59,260 --> 03:14:01,500
Can someone clarify that for us?

5692
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:02,800
Who knows what that fucking means.

5693
03:14:02,940 --> 03:14:04,160
I think you just keep the traps up.

5694
03:14:04,540 --> 03:14:06,600
Like you... I think you just build the trap.

5695
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:07,600
Oh, and then like have...

5696
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:08,940
You just need to capture five.

5697
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:09,560
Oh, same...

5698
03:14:10,400 --> 03:14:12,440
I got the pen king.

5699
03:14:12,580 --> 03:14:13,700
Guys, I got the pen king!

5700
03:14:13,900 --> 03:14:14,580
Clip, clip, clip!

5701
03:14:14,820 --> 03:14:14,880
Let's go!

5702
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:15,980
Oh, clip it!

5703
03:14:16,020 --> 03:14:16,700
Clip, clip, clip!

5704
03:14:18,960 --> 03:14:20,580
Catch five at the same time.

5705
03:14:20,820 --> 03:14:24,600
I guess we could ask the admin what they mean by that.

5706
03:14:24,780 --> 03:14:25,540
Because actually I'm confused.

5707
03:14:25,640 --> 03:14:26,120
Clarify.

5708
03:14:26,360 --> 03:14:27,820
Yeah, I'm actually confused now.

5709
03:14:28,740 --> 03:14:30,640
Excuse me, can you clarify please?

5710
03:14:31,620 --> 03:14:32,100
Actually.

5711
03:14:32,680 --> 03:14:33,160
Please.

5712
03:14:33,540 --> 03:14:34,020
Actually.

5713
03:14:34,740 --> 03:14:35,220
Actually.

5714
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:36,500
Where is it?

5715
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:38,200
I'm stuck.

5716
03:14:38,640 --> 03:14:39,360
I'm stuck.

5717
03:14:39,540 --> 03:14:40,100
Okay, there you go.

5718
03:14:43,710 --> 03:14:44,410
Oh, fuck.

5719
03:14:45,470 --> 03:14:46,430
Five traps with...

5720
03:14:46,430 --> 03:14:46,690
So many.

5721
03:14:46,790 --> 03:14:49,390
Oh, five traps with five different lambels.

5722
03:14:49,570 --> 03:14:49,930
Oh, okay.

5723
03:14:50,070 --> 03:14:50,430
Okay.

5724
03:14:50,550 --> 03:14:51,390
All right, that's fine.

5725
03:14:51,510 --> 03:14:51,830
Yeah.

5726
03:14:54,310 --> 03:14:55,950
Okay, I need to find...

5727
03:14:56,450 --> 03:14:57,370
All right, where am I?

5728
03:14:59,190 --> 03:15:00,330
I need to go this way.

5729
03:15:01,690 --> 03:15:03,690
All right, I'm heading over to the...

5730
03:15:03,690 --> 03:15:04,590
Doom mod!

5731
03:15:06,330 --> 03:15:07,210
Doom mod!

5732
03:15:07,650 --> 03:15:08,970
Doom mod, get over here.

5733
03:15:09,010 --> 03:15:09,890
I don't need...

5734
03:15:09,890 --> 03:15:10,910
I can get arrows later.

5735
03:15:12,490 --> 03:15:13,490
Wait, there's an effigy.

5736
03:15:13,530 --> 03:15:13,690
Nice.

5737
03:15:13,930 --> 03:15:15,010
I'll grab that effigy actually.

5738
03:15:15,870 --> 03:15:16,310
Nice.

5739
03:15:17,290 --> 03:15:18,290
Oh my God.

5740
03:15:18,390 --> 03:15:19,670
What's so funny?

5741
03:15:19,670 --> 03:15:20,190
What's a effigy?

5742
03:15:20,190 --> 03:15:26,930
I think we're going to have to make it go into character place this time.

5743
03:15:28,410 --> 03:15:28,830
All right.

5744
03:15:28,830 --> 03:15:28,850
Take your own character.

5745
03:15:28,850 --> 03:15:29,390
Oh, I think here, we...

5746
03:15:29,390 --> 03:15:31,110
What's going on here for a second?

5747
03:15:31,110 --> 03:15:31,650
Wait, wait.

5748
03:15:32,270 --> 03:15:38,510
Uhh, Oh my God.

5749
03:15:38,510 --> 03:15:39,770
Wait wait wait wait.

5750
03:15:39,870 --> 03:15:46,290
Wait wait, I'm still doing it.

5751
03:15:46,310 --> 03:15:46,950
What just happened?

5752
03:15:47,190 --> 03:15:48,410
What the fuck?

5753
03:15:48,950 --> 03:15:50,070
I'm sure for sure.

5754
03:15:50,430 --> 03:15:51,530
I'm sure for sure.

5755
03:15:54,770 --> 03:15:55,250
Dang!

5756
03:15:55,250 --> 03:15:57,370
My slime was leaking out of every pore.

5757
03:15:57,630 --> 03:15:58,030
Oh no.

5758
03:15:58,130 --> 03:15:59,290
Hey, what level is this?

5759
03:15:59,450 --> 03:16:00,530
Level 30, I can't...

5760
03:16:01,150 --> 03:16:02,990
But this is good, right?

5761
03:16:03,070 --> 03:16:04,130
It's supposed to be juicy.

5762
03:16:04,290 --> 03:16:07,410
And you wouldn't want to be dry and like all crunchy and stuff.

5763
03:16:07,490 --> 03:16:07,710
Ew.

5764
03:16:07,870 --> 03:16:08,230
Wait.

5765
03:16:08,690 --> 03:16:09,590
Can you imagine?

5766
03:16:10,790 --> 03:16:12,470
I really don't want to.

5767
03:16:14,450 --> 03:16:14,850
I don't want to.

5768
03:16:14,850 --> 03:16:15,070
No thanks.

5769
03:16:16,210 --> 03:16:17,950
I just... I don't know.

5770
03:16:17,990 --> 03:16:19,970
I don't think... I don't know.

5771
03:16:21,190 --> 03:16:22,730
I don't know about that one.

5772
03:16:22,850 --> 03:16:24,170
You know, maybe...

5773
03:16:27,870 --> 03:16:30,230
Okay, what was the one that we needed to do together?

5774
03:16:31,190 --> 03:16:31,990
That dungeon.

5775
03:16:32,310 --> 03:16:33,550
The ravine one, right?

5776
03:16:33,790 --> 03:16:35,310
Do we want to do the ravines?

5777
03:16:35,630 --> 03:16:36,510
The ravine dungeon?

5778
03:16:36,910 --> 03:16:37,830
If someone can find them.

5779
03:16:37,930 --> 03:16:39,370
Yeah, we need to find a ravine dungeon.

5780
03:16:39,690 --> 03:16:42,310
Yeah, one of us find the ravine dungeon, we can do it.

5781
03:16:42,470 --> 03:16:43,810
Alright, I'm gonna ask Google.

5782
03:16:45,490 --> 03:16:46,710
I love asking Google.

5783
03:16:49,170 --> 03:16:52,490
Yeah, if you find it, I fly and try to...

5784
03:16:52,490 --> 03:16:53,710
Is there a... the ravine grotto?

5785
03:16:54,650 --> 03:16:55,930
You can look at the word doc.

5786
03:16:56,370 --> 03:16:57,650
Cause we're like right there.

5787
03:16:59,890 --> 03:17:01,770
I might be standing in front of it, even.

5788
03:17:02,050 --> 03:17:04,510
I mean, you still have to... you have to find it still.

5789
03:17:06,650 --> 03:17:07,890
We have to find it.

5790
03:17:07,910 --> 03:17:09,010
It's not like it's just there.

5791
03:17:17,860 --> 03:17:19,860
Wait, how much time we have left, actually?

5792
03:17:20,220 --> 03:17:20,860
An hour.

5793
03:17:20,960 --> 03:17:24,100
Okay, I'm gonna... after an hour, I'm gonna try... I'm gonna power level to 30.

5794
03:17:25,900 --> 03:17:27,600
So my chicken can be level 30.

5795
03:17:30,200 --> 03:17:31,580
After I get that doom one.

5796
03:17:32,320 --> 03:17:34,040
Come on, stay in the ball, stay in the ball.

5797
03:17:34,940 --> 03:17:35,380
Shit.

5798
03:17:36,760 --> 03:17:38,480
Pals are stored in the balls.

5799
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:39,200
No!

5800
03:17:41,940 --> 03:17:42,380
No!

5801
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:43,440
Ugh.

5802
03:17:46,850 --> 03:17:49,150
No, I think the spot that I died at is right in front of the dungeon.

5803
03:17:49,330 --> 03:17:50,610
So I'm just gonna go there and check.

5804
03:17:50,730 --> 03:17:50,830
Yeah.

5805
03:17:51,050 --> 03:17:53,230
I mean, just mark the dungeon and then we can head over.

5806
03:17:53,810 --> 03:17:54,150
Together.

5807
03:17:54,670 --> 03:17:56,730
I'm like... I'm like... I can just find it in...

5808
03:17:56,730 --> 03:17:58,310
a waypoint.

5809
03:18:00,350 --> 03:18:01,310
Wait, can I open this?

5810
03:18:02,690 --> 03:18:03,030
Yeah.

5811
03:18:03,050 --> 03:18:03,350
Okay.

5812
03:18:03,450 --> 03:18:03,790
Nice.

5813
03:18:03,790 --> 03:18:04,210
It's arrows.

5814
03:18:05,050 --> 03:18:06,450
That's exactly what I needed.

5815
03:18:09,790 --> 03:18:10,130
Recon!

5816
03:18:10,650 --> 03:18:11,450
Wait a minute, actually.

5817
03:18:13,590 --> 03:18:15,310
Yeah, I don't care about these guys.

5818
03:18:19,250 --> 03:18:20,490
Oh, none to level 34.

5819
03:18:20,750 --> 03:18:22,590
I need to get to the fucking...

5820
03:18:23,490 --> 03:18:24,410
Where am I?

5821
03:18:25,030 --> 03:18:25,810
Am I close?

5822
03:18:27,230 --> 03:18:28,490
Am I close to doom one?

5823
03:18:29,890 --> 03:18:30,770
Doom one...

5824
03:18:31,690 --> 03:18:33,070
Am I close to you?

5825
03:18:33,070 --> 03:18:34,250
Oh wait, can I grab that ingot now?

5826
03:18:34,430 --> 03:18:35,410
Did he finish making it?

5827
03:18:35,610 --> 03:18:36,230
Where am I?

5828
03:18:37,410 --> 03:18:38,450
Nobody made it!

5829
03:18:38,590 --> 03:18:40,830
Okay, why are these tiles so fucking worthless?

5830
03:18:41,050 --> 03:18:42,490
But we have still fire pals.

5831
03:18:42,790 --> 03:18:43,830
Why is no one making ingots?

5832
03:18:43,830 --> 03:18:45,070
Why are these tiles so fucking worthless?

5833
03:18:45,910 --> 03:18:46,370
Whoa!

5834
03:18:47,190 --> 03:18:48,350
Make the ingot!

5835
03:18:48,770 --> 03:18:49,830
No, they matter.

5836
03:18:49,830 --> 03:18:50,350
They matter!

5837
03:18:50,370 --> 03:18:51,270
Chill, chill, chill, chill.

5838
03:18:51,330 --> 03:18:51,710
They matter.

5839
03:18:51,770 --> 03:18:52,150
They matter.

5840
03:18:52,370 --> 03:18:53,330
They matter!

5841
03:18:53,350 --> 03:18:55,150
Bro, don't push them too far!

5842
03:18:55,430 --> 03:18:55,670
Dude!

5843
03:18:57,410 --> 03:18:59,010
We don't have the butcher knife!

5844
03:18:59,130 --> 03:19:00,190
We can't hide the evidence!

5845
03:19:04,950 --> 03:19:06,750
Butchering pals is not an exploit.

5846
03:19:06,910 --> 03:19:08,070
It is aboveboard.

5847
03:19:09,190 --> 03:19:10,590
I mean, they know what they did.

5848
03:19:12,770 --> 03:19:14,510
It's more like what they didn't do.

5849
03:19:14,730 --> 03:19:18,250
Isn't one of the achievements is all of us have to butcher a... pal?

5850
03:19:18,650 --> 03:19:19,410
Wait, really?

5851
03:19:19,590 --> 03:19:20,350
Is that global?

5852
03:19:20,530 --> 03:19:20,750
Is it?

5853
03:19:20,950 --> 03:19:21,890
I think it's global.

5854
03:19:22,170 --> 03:19:24,270
I mean, we can do that tomorrow.

5855
03:19:24,890 --> 03:19:26,550
Oh no, that's... oh.

5856
03:19:26,570 --> 03:19:27,930
Oh no, that's terrible.

5857
03:19:28,090 --> 03:19:30,190
That will suck.

5858
03:19:30,610 --> 03:19:31,270
So bad.

5859
03:19:31,710 --> 03:19:34,670
That would be so terrible for us to do, like, ethically too.

5860
03:19:36,270 --> 03:19:36,750
Right?

5861
03:19:37,170 --> 03:19:37,650
Yeah.

5862
03:19:40,150 --> 03:19:41,690
Alright, pick your lambo.

5863
03:19:41,750 --> 03:19:43,710
That's why we catch those five lambos.

5864
03:19:45,770 --> 03:19:48,390
Yeah, we just catch them all and then we just butcher them.

5865
03:19:48,430 --> 03:19:49,190
Yeah, exactly.

5866
03:19:49,930 --> 03:19:51,370
Dude, that's perfect with the traps.

5867
03:19:52,370 --> 03:19:54,330
I am at the dungeon.

5868
03:19:54,410 --> 03:19:55,530
I'm gonna see if this is the one we want.

5869
03:19:57,150 --> 03:19:57,990
I think it is.

5870
03:19:59,490 --> 03:20:01,250
This is the...

5871
03:20:04,010 --> 03:20:04,810
Ravine Grotto.

5872
03:20:04,890 --> 03:20:05,610
Oh, it is.

5873
03:20:05,670 --> 03:20:05,950
It is.

5874
03:20:06,090 --> 03:20:06,310
Okay.

5875
03:20:06,510 --> 03:20:07,190
Yeah, then we can do it.

5876
03:20:07,650 --> 03:20:07,950
We can do it now.

5877
03:20:08,230 --> 03:20:09,510
I'm heading to a...

5878
03:20:10,250 --> 03:20:10,590
We can do it now.

5879
03:20:10,590 --> 03:20:11,150
We can do it now.

5880
03:20:12,250 --> 03:20:13,170
Oh, I put a marker.

5881
03:20:13,310 --> 03:20:15,370
I don't know if you can see my markers, but I put it on there.

5882
03:20:15,490 --> 03:20:15,830
I cannot.

5883
03:20:16,170 --> 03:20:16,650
You cannot.

5884
03:20:16,710 --> 03:20:17,190
You have to...

5885
03:20:17,190 --> 03:20:17,330
Oh, well, it's where I am anyway.

5886
03:20:17,330 --> 03:20:19,090
You just stay where you are and then we're heading over.

5887
03:20:19,270 --> 03:20:19,550
Yeah.

5888
03:20:19,670 --> 03:20:20,190
I know.

5889
03:20:20,650 --> 03:20:21,820
What the fuck is the waypoint?

5890
03:20:24,010 --> 03:20:24,350
That was good.

5891
03:20:24,350 --> 03:20:24,370
Huh?

5892
03:20:28,800 --> 03:20:29,700
Oh, there it is.

5893
03:20:29,780 --> 03:20:30,360
Oh my god.

5894
03:20:30,600 --> 03:20:31,340
There it is.

5895
03:20:36,760 --> 03:20:37,280
Heading over.

5896
03:20:37,680 --> 03:20:38,020
Lambos?

5897
03:20:38,320 --> 03:20:38,960
What lambos?

5898
03:20:39,080 --> 03:20:40,360
We never had any lambos before.

5899
03:20:40,820 --> 03:20:41,160
Exactly.

5900
03:20:41,160 --> 03:20:41,780
What?

5901
03:20:42,380 --> 03:20:42,920
What do you mean?

5902
03:20:43,820 --> 03:20:44,540
Yeah, what do you mean?

5903
03:20:48,020 --> 03:20:48,840
Alright, I'm here.

5904
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:53,880
They need like wide open spaces to be happy, so, you know, it'd be unethical for us to keep them, so we just have...

5905
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:55,120
We're gonna have to eat them, you know?

5906
03:20:55,800 --> 03:20:56,660
That sounds pretty ethical.

5907
03:20:56,660 --> 03:20:57,620
It's the morally right thing to do.

5908
03:20:58,380 --> 03:21:01,800
Alright, we're heading over to... Let's all head over to...

5909
03:21:03,220 --> 03:21:04,000
Small P.P.

5910
03:21:04,380 --> 03:21:05,120
Ravine Grotto.

5911
03:21:05,500 --> 03:21:05,520
Yeah, yeah.

5912
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:06,980
But we all have to do it for the dungeon.

5913
03:21:07,640 --> 03:21:10,580
Yeah, I know, but you guys are gonna have to wait until I get the thing I need.

5914
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:10,760
Okay.

5915
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:11,600
Alright, what do you...

5916
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:12,260
We have to do it all together?

5917
03:21:12,640 --> 03:21:13,660
Yeah, we have to do all of them.

5918
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:14,620
I know.

5919
03:21:15,880 --> 03:21:18,500
Alright, how long do you think you'll be ready?

5920
03:21:19,200 --> 03:21:20,680
I don't know, soon-ish.

5921
03:21:20,960 --> 03:21:22,980
Alright, while you're doing that, I'm gonna...

5922
03:21:22,980 --> 03:21:24,520
I'll go back to getting fragments.

5923
03:21:25,080 --> 03:21:26,700
I'm gonna try and find...

5924
03:21:27,200 --> 03:21:27,860
Doomud still.

5925
03:21:30,460 --> 03:21:31,180
Doomud time.

5926
03:21:32,460 --> 03:21:32,900
Doomud.

5927
03:21:33,860 --> 03:21:34,740
Doodle doodle.

5928
03:21:34,940 --> 03:21:36,260
Oh shit, get over here.

5929
03:21:38,720 --> 03:21:39,680
Okay, this way.

5930
03:21:40,580 --> 03:21:41,600
Here I go.

5931
03:21:42,980 --> 03:21:43,500
Doomud.

5932
03:21:45,020 --> 03:21:47,280
Make sure the dungeon doesn't despawn though.

5933
03:21:47,420 --> 03:21:49,400
It has like a specific time to despawn.

5934
03:21:49,400 --> 03:21:49,760
Oh, okay.

5935
03:21:50,160 --> 03:21:50,900
Let me see.

5936
03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:03,800
I know it does despawn.

5937
03:22:04,160 --> 03:22:04,680
Yeah.

5938
03:22:06,340 --> 03:22:06,860
Okay.

5939
03:22:08,260 --> 03:22:09,720
What happened to the despawns though?

5940
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:10,800
Like the holes?

5941
03:22:10,840 --> 03:22:11,340
We have to find...

5942
03:22:11,940 --> 03:22:12,580
No, just...

5943
03:22:12,580 --> 03:22:14,100
We have to find another hole.

5944
03:22:14,280 --> 03:22:14,660
What?

5945
03:22:14,660 --> 03:22:15,120
For real?

5946
03:22:15,120 --> 03:22:15,580
Yeah.

5947
03:22:15,740 --> 03:22:16,080
Oh, yeah.

5948
03:22:16,080 --> 03:22:16,880
Cause there's like a timer.

5949
03:22:17,420 --> 03:22:18,120
Oh, that sucks.

5950
03:22:20,600 --> 03:22:20,960
Okay.

5951
03:22:21,740 --> 03:22:22,100
Um...

5952
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:24,280
The amount of time we have until the despawns is...

5953
03:22:24,280 --> 03:22:25,480
I found a large scorching egg.

5954
03:22:25,920 --> 03:22:26,720
Oh, we got...

5955
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:27,640
We got a ton of time.

5956
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:29,360
It's like 122 minutes.

5957
03:22:29,400 --> 03:22:29,660
Oh, okay.

5958
03:22:29,720 --> 03:22:29,920
Nice.

5959
03:22:30,020 --> 03:22:30,380
Easy.

5960
03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:33,580
I have a large scorching egg.

5961
03:22:33,700 --> 03:22:34,500
Do we have time to hatch it?

5962
03:22:35,160 --> 03:22:35,520
Yeah.

5963
03:22:35,860 --> 03:22:36,220
Alright.

5964
03:22:36,800 --> 03:22:38,620
I found a huge scorching egg.

5965
03:22:38,780 --> 03:22:39,180
Oh, okay.

5966
03:22:39,240 --> 03:22:40,680
We should hatch that first then.

5967
03:22:40,800 --> 03:22:41,000
Yeah.

5968
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:43,120
Even if we don't, we can set it and it will still cook.

5969
03:22:43,220 --> 03:22:44,020
I found a quiver.

5970
03:22:44,220 --> 03:22:44,960
I'm gonna kill this quiver.

5971
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:45,100
Well, we're gonna have to hatch it.

5972
03:22:45,100 --> 03:22:46,140
While we're not around.

5973
03:22:46,240 --> 03:22:47,260
It will still cook.

5974
03:22:47,580 --> 03:22:48,000
Yeah.

5975
03:22:48,300 --> 03:22:50,260
Like, technically, that's not against the rules.

5976
03:22:50,520 --> 03:22:51,100
I should hold the egg cooking it.

5977
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:51,840
Technically, that's not against the rules.

5978
03:22:52,160 --> 03:22:52,580
Alright.

5979
03:22:52,680 --> 03:22:55,240
Wait, is quiver in the list?

5980
03:22:57,620 --> 03:22:58,460
I did not write that anywhere.

5981
03:22:58,460 --> 03:22:58,620
Let's see.

5982
03:22:58,740 --> 03:22:59,500
Quiver in...

5983
03:22:59,500 --> 03:23:00,120
Uh...

5984
03:23:00,680 --> 03:23:01,360
It is.

5985
03:23:01,460 --> 03:23:01,700
Okay.

5986
03:23:01,800 --> 03:23:03,360
I'm gonna go catch the quiver right now.

5987
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:07,460
Alright.

5988
03:23:07,560 --> 03:23:08,200
Let's hope I don't die.

5989
03:23:08,260 --> 03:23:08,560
Let's go.

5990
03:23:16,660 --> 03:23:17,180
Oh, wait.

5991
03:23:17,220 --> 03:23:18,160
That's my fucking fist.

5992
03:23:18,260 --> 03:23:18,740
There you go.

5993
03:23:19,540 --> 03:23:20,260
Quiver in.

5994
03:23:20,740 --> 03:23:21,160
Boop.

5995
03:23:26,920 --> 03:23:27,440
Oh, shit.

5996
03:23:27,860 --> 03:23:28,620
He'll be fine.

5997
03:23:32,080 --> 03:23:32,800
Oh, shit!

5998
03:23:33,100 --> 03:23:34,240
I don't think I'll be fine.

5999
03:23:39,880 --> 03:23:40,240
My...

6000
03:23:43,840 --> 03:23:44,740
Oh, I don't have arrows.

6001
03:23:44,880 --> 03:23:46,400
Why do I keep forgetting to bring arrows?

6002
03:23:52,140 --> 03:23:52,980
Please don't kill me.

6003
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:53,780
Please don't kill me.

6004
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:54,480
Please don't kill me.

6005
03:23:54,700 --> 03:23:55,420
Please don't kill me.

6006
03:23:55,420 --> 03:23:56,060
Trying to catch this man.

6007
03:23:57,520 --> 03:23:58,200
Oh, no.

6008
03:23:58,280 --> 03:23:58,860
I'm too strong.

6009
03:23:59,300 --> 03:23:59,860
He's dead.

6010
03:23:59,960 --> 03:24:00,520
Oh, well.

6011
03:24:00,640 --> 03:24:01,160
Oh, no.

6012
03:24:01,720 --> 03:24:02,540
It is what it is.

6013
03:24:04,760 --> 03:24:05,120
No!

6014
03:24:05,300 --> 03:24:06,720
Oh, no.

6015
03:24:06,960 --> 03:24:07,320
Oh, no.

6016
03:24:08,300 --> 03:24:09,140
Please, Sweeper.

6017
03:24:10,700 --> 03:24:11,360
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

6018
03:24:12,020 --> 03:24:12,720
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

6019
03:24:13,120 --> 03:24:13,540
Alright.

6020
03:24:13,540 --> 03:24:13,780
Should be ready.

6021
03:24:14,760 --> 03:24:15,180
Alright.

6022
03:24:15,200 --> 03:24:16,940
I'm catching this quiver and I can head over.

6023
03:24:17,060 --> 03:24:17,620
I'm already...

6024
03:24:17,620 --> 03:24:18,700
I'm still pretty close to it.

6025
03:24:18,740 --> 03:24:20,800
So, if you come to this location, you'll be pretty much there.

6026
03:24:21,580 --> 03:24:22,220
Oh, yikes.

6027
03:24:23,900 --> 03:24:24,660
Give me a sec.

6028
03:24:24,740 --> 03:24:27,420
I'm trying to catch this quiver and then I'll be ready.

6029
03:24:28,020 --> 03:24:29,100
I'm almost there.

6030
03:24:31,700 --> 03:24:32,300
Sweeper, go.

6031
03:24:34,400 --> 03:24:34,820
No!

6032
03:24:35,260 --> 03:24:36,020
Sweeper, go.

6033
03:24:42,070 --> 03:24:42,490
Sweeper, go.

6034
03:24:42,490 --> 03:24:42,530
Sweeper, go.

6035
03:24:50,120 --> 03:24:50,520
Okay.

6036
03:24:51,420 --> 03:24:51,820
Yeah.

6037
03:24:51,900 --> 03:24:52,320
What is our...

6038
03:24:52,320 --> 03:24:52,800
What is our...

6039
03:24:52,800 --> 03:24:54,200
What is our ranking now?

6040
03:24:54,260 --> 03:24:56,260
My chat says that our ranking has not been updated.

6041
03:24:56,840 --> 03:24:59,300
Well, to be fair, we haven't really been doing any achievements.

6042
03:24:59,660 --> 03:25:00,940
We've just been like progressing.

6043
03:25:01,320 --> 03:25:02,600
I got quiver and clip, clip.

6044
03:25:02,920 --> 03:25:04,280
I got quiver and...

6045
03:25:05,140 --> 03:25:05,680
Clip, clip, clip.

6046
03:25:05,680 --> 03:25:07,520
Oh, the cutest fucking pal in the game.

6047
03:25:07,640 --> 03:25:08,880
I would die for that thing.

6048
03:25:09,040 --> 03:25:10,440
Yeah, they're so fucking cute.

6049
03:25:10,520 --> 03:25:10,680
Okay.

6050
03:25:10,740 --> 03:25:11,420
I'm heading over to dungeon.

6051
03:25:12,260 --> 03:25:12,660
Okay.

6052
03:25:13,260 --> 03:25:13,780
I'm away.

6053
03:25:14,020 --> 03:25:15,180
I'm loading my inventory.

6054
03:25:16,280 --> 03:25:17,240
I'm trying to get this thing.

6055
03:25:17,240 --> 03:25:21,000
I'm gonna find the waypoint and then I can be there.

6056
03:25:22,080 --> 03:25:24,600
Oh boy, I have some traveling to do.

6057
03:25:26,220 --> 03:25:28,540
Don't shy Lillie's there, I'll head on over.

6058
03:25:28,960 --> 03:25:29,980
Alright, I'm walking back over.

6059
03:25:30,500 --> 03:25:32,820
I'm actually a little bit south of it, so...

6060
03:25:34,220 --> 03:25:35,580
Go north of my position.

6061
03:25:38,080 --> 03:25:40,260
I'm just grabbing arrows and then I should be good.

6062
03:25:43,420 --> 03:25:46,180
I think it's because I left it in one of these boxes, right?

6063
03:25:48,120 --> 03:25:49,380
Yeah, I fucking knew it.

6064
03:25:49,640 --> 03:25:50,680
Oh, there's a raid!

6065
03:25:51,060 --> 03:25:52,980
I heard a passing relaxer.

6066
03:25:54,440 --> 03:25:55,440
Oh, that's not good.

6067
03:25:57,460 --> 03:25:59,780
I guess we should kill them.

6068
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:00,860
We can catch some of them too.

6069
03:26:00,920 --> 03:26:02,440
They give a shit ton of high quality at war.

6070
03:26:02,660 --> 03:26:03,480
Oh, there he is!

6071
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:05,020
Yeah, there's a relaxer, he's right here.

6072
03:26:07,340 --> 03:26:07,860
How many?

6073
03:26:07,980 --> 03:26:09,240
I don't know, I see one.

6074
03:26:13,100 --> 03:26:14,100
It might just be one.

6075
03:26:15,180 --> 03:26:16,340
He's like AFK.

6076
03:26:18,140 --> 03:26:20,120
He's not running over, I think he's stuck.

6077
03:26:21,720 --> 03:26:23,860
I think they're actually... I'm just gonna kill this one.

6078
03:26:24,520 --> 03:26:27,400
Alright, I'm just gonna kill this one then.

6079
03:26:27,900 --> 03:26:29,360
I'm pretty sure he's just stuck.

6080
03:26:30,200 --> 03:26:31,780
A raid of one, let's go.

6081
03:26:34,260 --> 03:26:35,560
Oh, he is definitely stuck.

6082
03:26:40,440 --> 03:26:43,340
Oh shit, we're like, Sarus can breed Anubis.

6083
03:26:45,220 --> 03:26:45,980
We've won.

6084
03:26:46,300 --> 03:26:48,540
I caught one of the relaxasaurus.

6085
03:26:48,760 --> 03:26:50,820
Is the raid done?

6086
03:26:51,100 --> 03:26:52,720
I caught one of them.

6087
03:26:53,140 --> 03:26:53,960
That's the herd.

6088
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:54,860
There's the other one.

6089
03:26:55,760 --> 03:26:56,240
Alright.

6090
03:26:57,140 --> 03:26:58,580
It's done, it was two.

6091
03:27:00,340 --> 03:27:01,980
Wow, what a big raid.

6092
03:27:02,320 --> 03:27:03,560
Alright, let's go, I'm ready.

6093
03:27:04,820 --> 03:27:05,300
Okay.

6094
03:27:06,820 --> 03:27:08,460
I'm waiting for Shy Lily to get there.

6095
03:27:08,600 --> 03:27:09,220
I'm making news.

6096
03:27:09,220 --> 03:27:10,360
Got quite some traveling to do.

6097
03:27:10,580 --> 03:27:12,980
Alright, I'm making some Giga Spear then.

6098
03:27:12,980 --> 03:27:13,840
Yes!

6099
03:27:14,120 --> 03:27:15,860
I got my Van Wurm.

6100
03:27:16,660 --> 03:27:17,260
Let's go.

6101
03:27:17,660 --> 03:27:18,100
Very good.

6102
03:27:18,360 --> 03:27:18,720
Yippee!

6103
03:27:19,320 --> 03:27:19,840
Yippee!

6104
03:27:19,840 --> 03:27:23,740
And then after this, I'm gonna go try and catch those mossos.

6105
03:27:24,080 --> 03:27:26,040
Alright, which one, where are you starting off on?

6106
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:29,380
I don't know, which ones have you done?

6107
03:27:29,620 --> 03:27:40,980
I've done like the, all like the easy ones up to, I got Penking, Gumas, Weepy, Chillit, Azerob, Grintail, and Quiverne.

6108
03:27:45,410 --> 03:27:48,310
So a lot of the ones at the bot, like the bottom are not taken.

6109
03:27:49,490 --> 03:27:50,290
The mediums?

6110
03:27:50,290 --> 03:27:52,390
10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 100.

6111
03:27:52,390 --> 03:27:53,610
Yeah, you can focus the medium then.

6112
03:27:55,250 --> 03:27:56,310
What level are you now?

6113
03:27:56,390 --> 03:27:56,730
Shrew 4?

6114
03:27:57,950 --> 03:27:58,350
31.

6115
03:27:58,630 --> 03:27:59,030
Okay.

6116
03:27:59,250 --> 03:27:59,770
Yeah, you can tackle the medium.

6117
03:27:59,770 --> 03:28:02,410
We've got 200 points it looks like, according to my chat.

6118
03:28:02,650 --> 03:28:03,810
We can tackle the medium.

6119
03:28:03,950 --> 03:28:06,330
Okay, I'm heading over to PP now for the dungeon.

6120
03:28:06,550 --> 03:28:06,710
Okay.

6121
03:28:07,610 --> 03:28:08,290
I got you.

6122
03:28:11,190 --> 03:28:12,310
Wait, am I wearing the wrong up?

6123
03:28:12,310 --> 03:28:12,570
My small PP awaits.

6124
03:28:12,970 --> 03:28:14,210
Oh, I can upgrade armor now?

6125
03:28:14,830 --> 03:28:15,230
Really?

6126
03:28:17,490 --> 03:28:18,110
Oh, I can.

6127
03:28:18,310 --> 03:28:18,750
Metal armor.

6128
03:28:18,950 --> 03:28:19,530
I'll do that later.

6129
03:28:20,670 --> 03:28:23,430
I mean, the dungeon has to be super easy, so it doesn't matter.

6130
03:28:23,870 --> 03:28:23,890
Yeah.

6131
03:28:24,190 --> 03:28:25,790
All right, let me find you.

6132
03:28:26,430 --> 03:28:28,070
All right, I'm heading over to small PP.

6133
03:28:28,310 --> 03:28:29,110
Are we all heading over?

6134
03:28:29,290 --> 03:28:29,310
Okay.

6135
03:28:29,330 --> 03:28:30,850
On my way to small PP.

6136
03:28:31,190 --> 03:28:31,930
Come to me.

6137
03:28:32,370 --> 03:28:37,010
Let me just unlock the waypoint for whenever we have to be around this area.

6138
03:28:40,190 --> 03:28:40,950
You're sure 4?

6139
03:28:42,810 --> 03:28:48,270
Is taking a picture global or day one for the resurrected dude?

6140
03:28:48,570 --> 03:28:51,810
The resurrected dude is day one.

6141
03:28:52,510 --> 03:28:52,950
Okay.

6142
03:28:53,050 --> 03:28:53,790
So we need to take a picture.

6143
03:28:56,470 --> 03:28:59,810
We're at the one hour mark, so we have to like speed run, start speed running now.

6144
03:29:01,970 --> 03:29:03,190
It's better like hours.

6145
03:29:03,230 --> 03:29:04,450
Trying to find the entrance again.

6146
03:29:04,690 --> 03:29:07,910
At least I'm marked on my map, but it's to the right.

6147
03:29:07,910 --> 03:29:10,750
It's over this way.

6148
03:29:10,850 --> 03:29:10,930
Okay.

6149
03:29:10,930 --> 03:29:12,270
I'm just following you.

6150
03:29:12,410 --> 03:29:13,170
It's like this way.

6151
03:29:14,030 --> 03:29:16,090
It says we have to complete it together.

6152
03:29:18,350 --> 03:29:19,110
I'm coming.

6153
03:29:22,530 --> 03:29:23,630
Oh, it's dark now.

6154
03:29:23,750 --> 03:29:24,070
Hold on.

6155
03:29:26,530 --> 03:29:28,910
Okay, it's over this way.

6156
03:29:31,670 --> 03:29:34,310
We're going to catch five humans with level 10 or higher.

6157
03:29:34,390 --> 03:29:35,970
I have two humans that are level 10.

6158
03:29:36,730 --> 03:29:37,210
Oh.

6159
03:29:37,510 --> 03:29:37,950
Oh.

6160
03:29:37,950 --> 03:29:39,330
You guys have level 10?

6161
03:29:40,530 --> 03:29:42,290
There's a bunch of syndicates over here.

6162
03:29:42,390 --> 03:29:44,710
We can do that later then.

6163
03:29:45,090 --> 03:29:46,430
And then it's over here.

6164
03:29:47,750 --> 03:29:49,030
It's around this ridge somewhere.

6165
03:29:50,170 --> 03:29:51,710
So do we just have to complete the dungeon?

6166
03:29:51,710 --> 03:29:52,830
It's dark so I can't really see.

6167
03:29:53,050 --> 03:29:54,370
Or catch the person in the dungeon?

6168
03:29:54,770 --> 03:29:55,850
We have to complete it.

6169
03:29:55,890 --> 03:29:56,910
Just complete Ravine.

6170
03:29:57,050 --> 03:29:59,570
So we need to speedrun and get to the end.

6171
03:30:00,370 --> 03:30:02,170
It's over... does anybody have a fire pal?

6172
03:30:02,330 --> 03:30:02,630
I do.

6173
03:30:03,150 --> 03:30:04,450
I can't see shit.

6174
03:30:05,770 --> 03:30:06,790
Oh here it is.

6175
03:30:06,830 --> 03:30:07,110
It's right here.

6176
03:30:07,530 --> 03:30:08,090
It's right here.

6177
03:30:11,210 --> 03:30:11,990
Ravine Grotto.

6178
03:30:12,930 --> 03:30:13,710
In we go.

6179
03:30:14,130 --> 03:30:14,990
My game crashed.

6180
03:30:15,110 --> 03:30:15,290
No!

6181
03:30:16,150 --> 03:30:16,630
No!

6182
03:30:17,050 --> 03:30:17,530
No!

6183
03:30:18,590 --> 03:30:20,510
I think if we wait here you can enter the room.

6184
03:30:20,510 --> 03:30:21,350
Okay, okay, okay.

6185
03:30:21,570 --> 03:30:23,890
My game was a corrupt data.

6186
03:30:24,090 --> 03:30:24,690
Everything's falling apart.

6187
03:30:25,050 --> 03:30:25,530
No!

6188
03:30:25,590 --> 03:30:26,950
I was just there!

6189
03:30:27,470 --> 03:30:29,330
I didn't find you guys again.

6190
03:30:30,230 --> 03:30:31,950
I can't believe it's all Doki's fault.

6191
03:30:31,990 --> 03:30:32,410
That's crazy.

6192
03:30:32,930 --> 03:30:33,590
Yeah, wow.

6193
03:30:33,830 --> 03:30:34,430
What the heck?

6194
03:30:34,430 --> 03:30:35,970
She was trolling this whole time.

6195
03:30:36,090 --> 03:30:38,230
I was trolling so hard.

6196
03:30:39,910 --> 03:30:41,810
Where the fuck is... okay here.

6197
03:30:41,990 --> 03:30:42,050
There we go.

6198
03:30:42,810 --> 03:30:43,370
Alright.

6199
03:30:45,590 --> 03:30:46,410
I'm back.

6200
03:30:48,170 --> 03:30:49,890
I need to find you guys again.

6201
03:30:50,190 --> 03:30:51,150
Oh my god I'm back!

6202
03:30:51,350 --> 03:30:52,710
Wait, where do I save?

6203
03:30:52,790 --> 03:30:53,670
Where does it save me?

6204
03:30:54,490 --> 03:30:55,530
I'm loading in.

6205
03:30:56,330 --> 03:30:57,810
Thank god I wasn't hosting.

6206
03:31:01,360 --> 03:31:03,260
Come on, load faster.

6207
03:31:05,160 --> 03:31:07,060
Why is it taking so long?

6208
03:31:11,840 --> 03:31:12,400
Guys.

6209
03:31:13,700 --> 03:31:14,920
It's taking a while.

6210
03:31:16,800 --> 03:31:18,040
This is not good.

6211
03:31:18,580 --> 03:31:20,140
Should I restart it?

6212
03:31:20,260 --> 03:31:21,360
Do I restart it?

6213
03:31:22,240 --> 03:31:24,440
Uh, probably?

6214
03:31:24,580 --> 03:31:25,100
Probably?

6215
03:31:25,360 --> 03:31:26,500
Cause your internet's still working.

6216
03:31:27,140 --> 03:31:28,020
I have no pickaxe.

6217
03:31:28,460 --> 03:31:29,960
I have a pickaxe.

6218
03:31:30,560 --> 03:31:32,880
Oh my god, did the game fucking crash?

6219
03:31:34,040 --> 03:31:34,560
Please.

6220
03:31:35,780 --> 03:31:36,800
Please, power.

6221
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:42,380
Should I just go the field bosses then, or...?

6222
03:31:42,380 --> 03:31:46,720
I guess, like, what are you guys- wait, do we have to complete it, as in like- we just have to-?

6223
03:31:46,720 --> 03:31:46,720
We just have to-?

6224
03:31:46,720 --> 03:31:47,820
As in like- All of us have to be at the end?

6225
03:31:48,540 --> 03:31:49,260
Okay, okay.

6226
03:31:49,360 --> 03:31:50,960
No, I meant like, at the boss.

6227
03:31:51,160 --> 03:31:51,640
That's what I meant.

6228
03:31:52,260 --> 03:31:53,680
Working towards the boss?

6229
03:31:53,860 --> 03:31:55,960
Like we just have to be at the boss together, right?

6230
03:31:55,960 --> 03:31:57,340
We just all have to kill the boss together.

6231
03:31:57,880 --> 03:31:59,760
Yeah, we can just go find the boss room.

6232
03:31:59,860 --> 03:32:00,440
Okay, I'm here!

6233
03:32:00,740 --> 03:32:02,340
Oh my god, I can't see though!

6234
03:32:02,460 --> 03:32:03,180
Where is it?

6235
03:32:04,260 --> 03:32:05,220
Oh, where is it?

6236
03:32:05,380 --> 03:32:05,800
Where is it?

6237
03:32:05,800 --> 03:32:06,460
Here, I'll come outside.

6238
03:32:06,860 --> 03:32:08,860
I don't... I can't see!

6239
03:32:09,680 --> 03:32:10,260
Right here.

6240
03:32:11,500 --> 03:32:12,120
There you go.

6241
03:32:14,840 --> 03:32:15,520
Is it here?

6242
03:32:15,940 --> 03:32:16,920
Okay, I'm in.

6243
03:32:17,380 --> 03:32:17,780
Nice!

6244
03:32:17,900 --> 03:32:19,340
Alright, now we run to the end.

6245
03:32:19,600 --> 03:32:20,000
Alright.

6246
03:32:20,060 --> 03:32:20,400
Okay.

6247
03:32:20,900 --> 03:32:21,480
I'm in.

6248
03:32:24,400 --> 03:32:24,800
Doggy.

6249
03:32:25,280 --> 03:32:25,880
Doggy's here!

6250
03:32:26,560 --> 03:32:26,960
Let's go!

6251
03:32:27,260 --> 03:32:30,540
You can use your bird.

6252
03:32:33,300 --> 03:32:36,340
I think it's gonna be... Oh no, I think this thing is slower than me walking.

6253
03:32:36,520 --> 03:32:37,260
It keeps getting stuck all the time.

6254
03:32:37,820 --> 03:32:38,600
I can...

6255
03:32:39,700 --> 03:32:41,900
I think we can catch Syndicate though.

6256
03:32:42,120 --> 03:32:42,940
We can catch these dudes.

6257
03:32:43,520 --> 03:32:45,600
Yeah, but we don't have... It's not like...

6258
03:32:45,960 --> 03:32:46,500
It's not...

6259
03:32:47,880 --> 03:32:48,820
What we need now.

6260
03:32:50,860 --> 03:32:51,760
Why is my...

6261
03:32:51,760 --> 03:32:53,440
Why is my little water snake so slow?

6262
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:54,260
You love water.

6263
03:32:54,840 --> 03:32:55,760
Go fast.

6264
03:32:56,060 --> 03:32:57,280
Go fast, little guy.

6265
03:32:59,120 --> 03:33:00,580
Oh, it's cause it's night time.

6266
03:33:03,080 --> 03:33:03,600
Losers.

6267
03:33:03,620 --> 03:33:04,820
Are we all here?

6268
03:33:05,880 --> 03:33:06,400
Almost.

6269
03:33:06,540 --> 03:33:07,060
Sorry.

6270
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:08,400
We'll just wait.

6271
03:33:08,600 --> 03:33:10,200
We're a bit slow.

6272
03:33:10,460 --> 03:33:11,000
We didn't have...

6273
03:33:12,880 --> 03:33:14,540
I'm on this little, like, noodle.

6274
03:33:14,720 --> 03:33:15,820
This little parasitic noodle.

6275
03:33:21,120 --> 03:33:22,200
We'll just wait a little.

6276
03:33:22,840 --> 03:33:24,200
Surefour and I are here now.

6277
03:33:25,900 --> 03:33:26,780
It's a Wallypop.

6278
03:33:27,300 --> 03:33:28,280
It's a Wallypop.

6279
03:33:28,280 --> 03:33:28,720
He's sleeping.

6280
03:33:29,100 --> 03:33:29,800
He's eepy.

6281
03:33:31,360 --> 03:33:32,600
He eepy sleepy.

6282
03:33:32,620 --> 03:33:37,220
I'm just looking across the way like it's some sort of like Indiana Jones adventure, but it's just Shylalee on the other side.

6283
03:33:37,500 --> 03:33:38,240
Oh my god.

6284
03:33:38,720 --> 03:33:39,540
Alright, we're here.

6285
03:33:39,540 --> 03:33:40,200
Oh no, I'm stuck.

6286
03:33:40,500 --> 03:33:41,920
Oh shit, I'm stuck too.

6287
03:33:42,060 --> 03:33:42,700
Too fat.

6288
03:33:42,780 --> 03:33:43,560
And now we kill.

6289
03:33:43,980 --> 03:33:44,880
Now we kill.

6290
03:33:46,920 --> 03:33:47,880
Alright, let's go.

6291
03:33:48,700 --> 03:33:49,180
Die.

6292
03:33:50,020 --> 03:33:51,000
Who's catching this?

6293
03:33:51,040 --> 03:33:52,600
Oh, he's so freaking cute though.

6294
03:33:52,960 --> 03:33:54,720
I love the sweepers, man.

6295
03:33:55,900 --> 03:33:57,080
They're so cute.

6296
03:34:02,210 --> 03:34:03,430
I can catch this.

6297
03:34:05,190 --> 03:34:06,870
Alright, just this one guy.

6298
03:34:07,350 --> 03:34:08,830
I'm gonna take him out right now.

6299
03:34:08,830 --> 03:34:11,810
Is his health not going down for anybody else?

6300
03:34:11,870 --> 03:34:13,210
No, it is going down.

6301
03:34:13,390 --> 03:34:13,470
Oh, okay.

6302
03:34:13,590 --> 03:34:15,550
Did we catch Pinkin?

6303
03:34:15,830 --> 03:34:17,150
Yeah, we caught the raid.

6304
03:34:17,270 --> 03:34:17,950
I caught the boss.

6305
03:34:18,390 --> 03:34:19,570
Oh, Pinkin is my guy.

6306
03:34:20,270 --> 03:34:20,690
Alright.

6307
03:34:22,550 --> 03:34:22,970
Whoa!

6308
03:34:23,750 --> 03:34:25,610
You guys almost fucking killed him.

6309
03:34:25,990 --> 03:34:27,690
Did we catch him?

6310
03:34:28,170 --> 03:34:28,970
We did it!

6311
03:34:29,010 --> 03:34:30,190
We finished the dungeon!

6312
03:34:30,510 --> 03:34:31,290
Clip, clip, clip!

6313
03:34:31,670 --> 03:34:32,650
Clip, clip, clip, clip!

6314
03:34:34,290 --> 03:34:36,290
Do we have to take a screenshot or anything?

6315
03:34:37,310 --> 03:34:38,470
No, it's just clip.

6316
03:34:39,610 --> 03:34:41,030
It says, requires screenshot or clip.

6317
03:34:41,230 --> 03:34:42,350
Oh, you already got it.

6318
03:34:42,410 --> 03:34:42,710
That's right.

6319
03:34:42,850 --> 03:34:44,610
It says, requires screenshot or clip.

6320
03:34:44,710 --> 03:34:45,090
So we're good.

6321
03:34:45,750 --> 03:34:46,390
Alright, cool.

6322
03:34:47,950 --> 03:34:49,670
Do we need to do any other dungeons?

6323
03:34:50,190 --> 03:34:52,010
Yeah, we have to find that mountain stream.

6324
03:34:52,950 --> 03:34:53,730
Mountain stream?

6325
03:34:54,090 --> 03:34:54,890
Give me a sec.

6326
03:34:55,210 --> 03:34:56,330
I'm gonna go...

6327
03:34:58,130 --> 03:35:00,330
Yeah, you should start doing bosses.

6328
03:35:01,890 --> 03:35:03,530
Alright, I know where mountain stream is.

6329
03:35:03,610 --> 03:35:05,170
I'll go search for an entrance.

6330
03:35:05,430 --> 03:35:05,650
Okay.

6331
03:35:06,910 --> 03:35:08,650
I'm just gonna power level the 30.

6332
03:35:08,830 --> 03:35:09,350
Real fast.

6333
03:35:10,170 --> 03:35:11,350
Oh shit, wait.

6334
03:35:12,410 --> 03:35:14,110
I didn't do that in...

6335
03:35:14,110 --> 03:35:16,050
I'll attempt to level up a little.

6336
03:35:16,110 --> 03:35:16,350
Oh wait!

6337
03:35:17,370 --> 03:35:20,470
Lily, can you try and catch level 10 so the ticket thugs...

6338
03:35:21,030 --> 03:35:22,670
We need... I have two on me.

6339
03:35:23,610 --> 03:35:24,610
So we need three more.

6340
03:35:26,150 --> 03:35:27,110
What do we need?

6341
03:35:27,270 --> 03:35:28,850
Level 10 humans.

6342
03:35:29,550 --> 03:35:31,970
Let me see what level the humans are that I have at least.

6343
03:35:31,990 --> 03:35:32,310
I have two.

6344
03:35:32,550 --> 03:35:33,530
Level 10 humans.

6345
03:35:33,910 --> 03:35:36,650
Do we have to catch them at 10?

6346
03:35:36,650 --> 03:35:36,770
Yeah.

6347
03:35:36,830 --> 03:35:38,630
Oh, it has to be caught.

6348
03:35:42,990 --> 03:35:44,930
I'm gonna go to the beginning.

6349
03:35:45,370 --> 03:35:46,010
And just...

6350
03:35:46,010 --> 03:35:47,810
Chilina, do I have enough for the lantern?

6351
03:35:50,990 --> 03:35:52,330
I lantern, I do.

6352
03:35:53,070 --> 03:35:53,670
Ow, fuck.

6353
03:35:54,010 --> 03:35:54,410
Ow.

6354
03:35:56,090 --> 03:35:56,970
Alright, I got a loot moon.

6355
03:35:58,330 --> 03:35:59,970
I wanna craft the lantern.

6356
03:36:03,940 --> 03:36:05,480
Wait, what level do you need to be for the lantern?

6357
03:36:06,800 --> 03:36:07,200
Um...

6358
03:36:08,060 --> 03:36:08,460
No.

6359
03:36:09,360 --> 03:36:11,060
Let's see... Level 22.

6360
03:36:11,760 --> 03:36:12,400
Okay, cool.

6361
03:36:12,440 --> 03:36:12,920
I can get a lantern.

6362
03:36:14,400 --> 03:36:15,080
Alright, nice.

6363
03:36:15,860 --> 03:36:16,260
Okay.

6364
03:36:17,900 --> 03:36:19,480
Wait, what dungeon is this one?

6365
03:36:19,580 --> 03:36:22,580
Oh wait, has anybody done Bushi yet?

6366
03:36:23,100 --> 03:36:23,500
Bushi?

6367
03:36:23,600 --> 03:36:23,740
No.

6368
03:36:23,880 --> 03:36:24,240
No.

6369
03:36:24,620 --> 03:36:26,560
Is he even one of the things?

6370
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:27,480
I'm gonna go attempt it.

6371
03:36:27,540 --> 03:36:27,940
Yeah, he is.

6372
03:36:29,340 --> 03:36:30,480
Yeah, I'm gonna go attempt it.

6373
03:36:30,600 --> 03:36:31,540
Alright, I'm power leveling.

6374
03:36:37,700 --> 03:36:39,140
Okay, I saved a lot.

6375
03:36:39,320 --> 03:36:39,720
Okay, I saved a lot.

6376
03:36:39,720 --> 03:36:40,380
To power level.

6377
03:36:44,030 --> 03:36:45,050
I just need...

6378
03:36:45,050 --> 03:36:45,930
Oh, I'm all out of arrows.

6379
03:36:46,770 --> 03:36:48,150
That probably won't be a problem.

6380
03:36:48,450 --> 03:36:49,530
Oh yeah, sure.

6381
03:36:49,550 --> 03:36:51,170
You can kill the Mamoswine too.

6382
03:36:51,230 --> 03:36:52,590
Cause we need the meat to make a steak.

6383
03:36:54,670 --> 03:36:55,070
Yeah.

6384
03:36:57,290 --> 03:36:57,690
Okay.

6385
03:36:59,950 --> 03:37:00,350
Shit.

6386
03:37:01,150 --> 03:37:01,990
Go, Panking, go.

6387
03:37:02,150 --> 03:37:02,590
Get him.

6388
03:37:02,730 --> 03:37:04,030
Oh my god, my Panking is so small.

6389
03:37:05,310 --> 03:37:06,190
Just a little guy.

6390
03:37:07,130 --> 03:37:08,450
He's just a little guy.

6391
03:37:08,610 --> 03:37:09,130
Just a little guy.

6392
03:37:09,850 --> 03:37:10,870
Don't size shame.

6393
03:37:11,190 --> 03:37:11,850
Oh true.

6394
03:37:12,930 --> 03:37:14,370
That's fucked up, man.

6395
03:37:14,370 --> 03:37:15,890
It's not about the size, it's about the power.

6396
03:37:15,950 --> 03:37:16,310
Look at him.

6397
03:37:16,850 --> 03:37:19,610
Yeah, but you're size shaming him right now.

6398
03:37:20,030 --> 03:37:20,830
He's dominating.

6399
03:37:23,970 --> 03:37:24,910
Okay, I'm gonna kill you.

6400
03:37:25,330 --> 03:37:25,890
Let's see.

6401
03:37:26,390 --> 03:37:28,510
Do we have the five traps for the Lambos yet?

6402
03:37:29,350 --> 03:37:29,930
Uh, no.

6403
03:37:30,110 --> 03:37:31,510
I was waiting for the ingot to be made.

6404
03:37:31,610 --> 03:37:32,010
Oh, okay.

6405
03:37:32,010 --> 03:37:34,850
Because our lazy fire Pokemon don't wanna do it.

6406
03:37:34,850 --> 03:37:38,010
I can stay in base till the ingots are done.

6407
03:37:38,330 --> 03:37:41,190
We need 25 to make the traps.

6408
03:37:41,410 --> 03:37:42,670
Cause you need five for trap.

6409
03:37:43,450 --> 03:37:44,870
If you're doing bear traps.

6410
03:37:45,270 --> 03:37:47,430
Bro, like, you're just walking around.

6411
03:37:48,350 --> 03:37:48,870
There's other traps.

6412
03:37:48,870 --> 03:37:50,450
Just make another furnace too.

6413
03:37:51,270 --> 03:37:52,290
Make another furnace.

6414
03:37:52,650 --> 03:37:53,890
Yeah, we can make another furnace.

6415
03:37:53,950 --> 03:37:55,170
Yeah, I feel like we could...

6416
03:37:55,170 --> 03:37:58,570
We could spend a lot of time.

6417
03:37:59,390 --> 03:38:00,570
Okay, level 25.

6418
03:38:00,790 --> 03:38:02,670
I need five more levels for my chicken.

6419
03:38:05,810 --> 03:38:06,610
Let's see.

6420
03:38:10,620 --> 03:38:12,160
Get over here, Lambos.

6421
03:38:14,340 --> 03:38:14,880
Alright.

6422
03:38:15,060 --> 03:38:16,500
I'm getting the gigosphere ready.

6423
03:38:17,440 --> 03:38:17,980
What?

6424
03:38:18,040 --> 03:38:18,860
Where's my ball?

6425
03:38:24,430 --> 03:38:25,670
Why you coming for me, dude?

6426
03:38:25,810 --> 03:38:26,110
No.

6427
03:38:26,550 --> 03:38:28,410
No, stay away from me.

6428
03:38:31,010 --> 03:38:32,110
Get over here.

6429
03:38:32,690 --> 03:38:35,230
I need as many fucking chickens as I can.

6430
03:38:39,250 --> 03:38:41,270
I need to be level 30.

6431
03:38:41,290 --> 03:38:41,810
I need to be level 30.

6432
03:38:45,320 --> 03:38:47,020
I have no arrows, but this is fine.

6433
03:38:47,120 --> 03:38:48,700
I don't need arrows.

6434
03:38:53,800 --> 03:38:55,060
Chicken nuggies.

6435
03:38:56,140 --> 03:38:57,780
Get over here, little cat.

6436
03:38:58,340 --> 03:38:59,180
Oh, he's dead.

6437
03:38:59,680 --> 03:39:00,360
What?

6438
03:39:00,420 --> 03:39:02,020
Why the heck?

6439
03:39:02,020 --> 03:39:03,600
Where is she going?

6440
03:39:04,080 --> 03:39:06,300
Dude, she's going on an adventure.

6441
03:39:06,300 --> 03:39:07,380
What the heck?

6442
03:39:08,260 --> 03:39:10,640
She's like five bases away.

6443
03:39:11,540 --> 03:39:12,220
What?

6444
03:39:13,040 --> 03:39:14,440
Is she okay?

6445
03:39:14,640 --> 03:39:15,680
Let her live.

6446
03:39:16,580 --> 03:39:18,980
She doesn't want to be with you anymore.

6447
03:39:19,620 --> 03:39:20,060
She's finding herself.

6448
03:39:20,060 --> 03:39:21,620
She doesn't want to be with you anymore.

6449
03:39:22,180 --> 03:39:24,700
Let me help you find your place at the fucking front.

6450
03:39:30,360 --> 03:39:31,240
Oh shit.

6451
03:39:31,320 --> 03:39:31,660
Have fun.

6452
03:39:32,160 --> 03:39:33,820
Literally have one fucking job.

6453
03:39:34,460 --> 03:39:34,900
Ryan!

6454
03:39:37,140 --> 03:39:37,580
Game.

6455
03:39:39,780 --> 03:39:40,220
Traps.

6456
03:39:40,420 --> 03:39:42,380
We can just make a... does it have to be a bear trap?

6457
03:39:42,500 --> 03:39:44,140
Or can it be a hanging... It has to be a trap.

6458
03:39:44,340 --> 03:39:46,440
It just says... Patalia's been caught.

6459
03:39:47,140 --> 03:39:47,500
Wait.

6460
03:39:47,720 --> 03:39:48,380
Clip, clip, clip!

6461
03:39:49,500 --> 03:39:50,820
Clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip!

6462
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:51,680
Yeah, it's just traps.

6463
03:39:51,760 --> 03:39:52,420
Any traps work.

6464
03:39:53,280 --> 03:39:54,940
Okay, then we can just make a hanging trap.

6465
03:39:55,520 --> 03:39:56,660
We need five of them.

6466
03:39:56,700 --> 03:39:57,880
So fifty would...

6467
03:39:57,880 --> 03:39:59,240
Bushi has been caught!

6468
03:39:59,860 --> 03:40:00,660
Bushi's been caught!

6469
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:01,360
Clip, clip, clip!

6470
03:40:02,000 --> 03:40:02,360
Nice.

6471
03:40:02,780 --> 03:40:03,140
Alright,

6472
03:40:07,060 --> 03:40:07,500
I'm out.

6473
03:40:12,710 --> 03:40:13,250
Let's go!

6474
03:40:13,670 --> 03:40:14,690
Alright, three in a row.

6475
03:40:14,770 --> 03:40:15,370
Alright, Bushi down.

6476
03:40:15,770 --> 03:40:17,230
I'm gonna head back to...

6477
03:40:18,350 --> 03:40:18,710
base.

6478
03:40:18,710 --> 03:40:20,430
And then I'm gonna go to the other dungeon.

6479
03:40:20,530 --> 03:40:21,210
How much time do we have?

6480
03:40:22,610 --> 03:40:23,370
Forty-eight minutes.

6481
03:40:23,930 --> 03:40:24,630
Okay, easy.

6482
03:40:25,130 --> 03:40:25,970
I'll go find the entrance.

6483
03:40:26,030 --> 03:40:28,090
I'll get those screenshots at 1.2.

6484
03:40:28,330 --> 03:40:30,190
Yeah, yeah, we can do that in the last thirty minutes.

6485
03:40:32,270 --> 03:40:34,810
I have the reincarnated guy, like...

6486
03:40:34,810 --> 03:40:35,170
uh...

6487
03:40:36,030 --> 03:40:36,430
marked.

6488
03:40:39,470 --> 03:40:40,310
I'm putting these...

6489
03:40:40,310 --> 03:40:41,530
spheres in a chest.

6490
03:40:42,370 --> 03:40:44,570
Yes, I need them to catch the humans later.

6491
03:40:45,030 --> 03:40:46,150
Oh yeah, we need...

6492
03:40:46,590 --> 03:40:48,590
Okay, do we have... do we only have like...

6493
03:40:48,710 --> 03:40:49,390
two humans?

6494
03:40:49,510 --> 03:40:50,710
Because I... like I said, I have two...

6495
03:40:50,710 --> 03:40:52,650
Alright, I'm coming back to base and I can check.

6496
03:40:53,590 --> 03:40:54,370
I'm fast traveling.

6497
03:40:55,350 --> 03:40:55,710
Okay.

6498
03:40:56,250 --> 03:40:58,710
I caught a couple as well, but they were low level.

6499
03:40:58,810 --> 03:41:00,310
So I just don't count towards that one.

6500
03:41:00,310 --> 03:41:02,930
I know that I attacked some, but I don't know if I caught them.

6501
03:41:05,310 --> 03:41:06,070
Alright, let me check.

6502
03:41:06,970 --> 03:41:07,990
Get over here, you little cat.

6503
03:41:08,210 --> 03:41:09,430
Get over here, I'm gonna kill you.

6504
03:41:11,790 --> 03:41:12,510
Alright, uh...

6505
03:41:12,510 --> 03:41:14,030
The people I have...

6506
03:41:14,870 --> 03:41:15,590
I have...

6507
03:41:16,830 --> 03:41:17,890
None over ten.

6508
03:41:18,710 --> 03:41:18,730
Oh, you're dead.

6509
03:41:18,730 --> 03:41:19,610
So you just need three, Lily.

6510
03:41:20,790 --> 03:41:21,150
Nice.

6511
03:41:22,490 --> 03:41:23,390
I think that's easy.

6512
03:41:23,490 --> 03:41:24,890
You just gotta go to the world that has three.

6513
03:41:25,010 --> 03:41:25,710
That's really it.

6514
03:41:31,490 --> 03:41:31,850
Okay.

6515
03:41:32,070 --> 03:41:33,030
I'm gonna kill them too.

6516
03:41:36,230 --> 03:41:37,770
Alright, let me make my Vanworm Saddle.

6517
03:41:38,890 --> 03:41:39,610
Oh no!

6518
03:41:48,020 --> 03:41:49,760
Where is the Vanworm Saddle?

6519
03:41:49,820 --> 03:41:50,260
There we go.

6520
03:41:50,400 --> 03:41:51,320
Alright, I need ingot.

6521
03:41:51,360 --> 03:41:52,120
Fucking ingot!

6522
03:41:52,780 --> 03:41:53,140
Okay.

6523
03:41:53,980 --> 03:41:56,060
Do you think... Oh, we don't have time to breathe the new...

6524
03:41:56,080 --> 03:41:56,900
...anubis anymore though.

6525
03:41:57,060 --> 03:41:58,280
But that's a global thing.

6526
03:41:58,380 --> 03:41:58,860
We can do that.

6527
03:41:59,000 --> 03:41:59,500
That's global.

6528
03:41:59,540 --> 03:42:01,060
So we should start at that right now.

6529
03:42:01,180 --> 03:42:02,180
We can catch it.

6530
03:42:03,120 --> 03:42:05,360
We can start catching the stuff.

6531
03:42:05,860 --> 03:42:06,300
Okay.

6532
03:42:10,840 --> 03:42:11,280
Uhhh...

6533
03:42:12,280 --> 03:42:12,720
Super...

6534
03:42:12,720 --> 03:42:13,500
...fair.

6535
03:42:16,090 --> 03:42:16,530
Okay.

6536
03:42:17,310 --> 03:42:17,750
Alright,

6537
03:42:25,790 --> 03:42:27,810
let me see what it takes to do the breeding.

6538
03:42:29,050 --> 03:42:33,160
Alright, let me see what it takes to do the breeding.

6539
03:42:33,160 --> 03:42:33,700
Stupid penguin.

6540
03:42:33,860 --> 03:42:34,620
You think you're strong?

6541
03:42:39,490 --> 03:42:41,090
Breeding, breeding, breeding, breeding.

6542
03:42:41,470 --> 03:42:43,430
Alright, I am at levels 26.

6543
03:42:45,210 --> 03:42:47,210
Four more levels now.

6544
03:42:47,950 --> 03:42:48,550
Four more levels now.

6545
03:42:50,900 --> 03:42:51,980
Where's the breeding?

6546
03:42:52,360 --> 03:42:53,560
Did you get Fangalope?

6547
03:42:53,760 --> 03:42:54,340
Nope.

6548
03:42:55,920 --> 03:42:58,140
I don't think Fangalope's in there.

6549
03:42:58,520 --> 03:42:59,300
No, it's not.

6550
03:42:59,600 --> 03:43:00,440
Oh, it is.

6551
03:43:00,520 --> 03:43:01,000
Yeah, it is.

6552
03:43:04,970 --> 03:43:07,730
I'm just catching the level 30 for the chicken.

6553
03:43:10,310 --> 03:43:10,910
I'm just catching the level 30 for the chicken.

6554
03:43:10,910 --> 03:43:11,130
I see it.

6555
03:43:11,150 --> 03:43:11,730
It's level 19.

6556
03:43:12,410 --> 03:43:14,630
Okay, for the breeding farm, we already have everything we need.

6557
03:43:14,730 --> 03:43:15,310
So I'll just make it.

6558
03:43:15,310 --> 03:43:16,050
Yeah, just make it for now.

6559
03:43:16,590 --> 03:43:16,910
Okay.

6560
03:43:20,250 --> 03:43:23,270
I'm gonna put it down in the area with like the trees that we don't usually go down.

6561
03:43:24,070 --> 03:43:24,390
I'm gonna put it down in the area with like the trees that we don't usually go down.

6562
03:43:31,270 --> 03:43:31,590
No!

6563
03:43:33,170 --> 03:43:33,490
Okay.

6564
03:43:34,290 --> 03:43:34,930
My bird!

6565
03:43:36,110 --> 03:43:37,150
Stop killing them!

6566
03:43:41,980 --> 03:43:44,740
Alright, get my Van Worms paddle and then I'm good to go.

6567
03:43:44,820 --> 03:43:45,480
And I can go scout.

6568
03:43:46,200 --> 03:43:46,520
Yes!

6569
03:43:46,960 --> 03:43:47,280
Finally!

6570
03:43:48,040 --> 03:43:48,600
Flying mount!

6571
03:43:49,500 --> 03:43:49,820
Yay!

6572
03:43:50,580 --> 03:43:50,780
Yippee!

6573
03:43:50,780 --> 03:43:51,940
Took way longer than it should have.

6574
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:53,000
That was really...

6575
03:43:53,000 --> 03:43:53,620
Ugh!

6576
03:43:55,560 --> 03:43:57,240
See, I need like...

6577
03:43:57,240 --> 03:43:58,760
I'm almost close to...

6578
03:44:00,840 --> 03:44:02,260
Oh, my Van Worm's hungry.

6579
03:44:02,360 --> 03:44:02,700
Eat.

6580
03:44:03,340 --> 03:44:03,900
Eat.

6581
03:44:03,960 --> 03:44:04,280
Eat.

6582
03:44:04,880 --> 03:44:06,060
I can fast travel.

6583
03:44:07,960 --> 03:44:09,520
Eat everything I kill.

6584
03:44:12,420 --> 03:44:13,260
Oh, hey, creamy.

6585
03:44:13,980 --> 03:44:14,540
Okay.

6586
03:44:19,230 --> 03:44:21,210
Alright, fast travel...

6587
03:44:21,990 --> 03:44:23,110
to the bridge.

6588
03:44:24,290 --> 03:44:25,530
And then from there I'll fly.

6589
03:44:25,610 --> 03:44:25,810
No!

6590
03:44:25,930 --> 03:44:26,130
No!

6591
03:44:26,470 --> 03:44:28,730
I almost lodged myself in the air.

6592
03:44:28,970 --> 03:44:31,250
Oh, Mountain Stream Grotto though is level 29.

6593
03:44:31,490 --> 03:44:32,170
Level 29?

6594
03:44:32,170 --> 03:44:33,090
I mean, there's four of us.

6595
03:44:33,090 --> 03:44:34,810
Well, I mean, I think it's fine because...

6596
03:44:34,810 --> 03:44:35,730
We'll be fine just as long as we dug it down.

6597
03:44:35,950 --> 03:44:39,710
As long as Trip 4 here, Trip 4 can like fucking tank everything for us too.

6598
03:44:39,850 --> 03:44:40,430
Yeah, it should be fine.

6599
03:44:40,630 --> 03:44:41,450
To tank?

6600
03:44:41,730 --> 03:44:42,130
Yeah.

6601
03:44:47,040 --> 03:44:47,440
Alright.

6602
03:44:48,100 --> 03:44:48,680
Go in!

6603
03:44:52,120 --> 03:44:54,300
As long as we find the dungeon, we just need to find it.

6604
03:44:54,660 --> 03:44:55,020
Okay.

6605
03:44:55,180 --> 03:44:55,560
What the heck?

6606
03:44:55,560 --> 03:44:57,240
I'm gonna try my luck this way first.

6607
03:44:58,660 --> 03:44:59,440
We got this.

6608
03:44:59,500 --> 03:44:59,900
We got this.

6609
03:44:59,940 --> 03:45:00,500
This is gonna be easy.

6610
03:45:00,660 --> 03:45:02,820
Alright, we caught five lamb bolts.

6611
03:45:02,900 --> 03:45:04,280
I'm gonna go catch the humans now.

6612
03:45:04,700 --> 03:45:05,060
Nice.

6613
03:45:05,080 --> 03:45:05,940
Wait, for the traps?

6614
03:45:06,720 --> 03:45:07,080
Yes.

6615
03:45:07,580 --> 03:45:08,480
Clip, clip, clip, clip.

6616
03:45:09,040 --> 03:45:10,120
Clip, clip, clip, clip.

6617
03:45:10,120 --> 03:45:10,940
Clip, clip, clip, clip.

6618
03:45:16,420 --> 03:45:18,100
Where's our clips and clippers?

6619
03:45:18,300 --> 03:45:18,340
I go find the humans.

6620
03:45:20,460 --> 03:45:21,520
Okay, we gotta keep going.

6621
03:45:21,580 --> 03:45:21,880
More north.

6622
03:45:21,880 --> 03:45:22,420
Oh!

6623
03:45:22,700 --> 03:45:24,040
Trip 4, kill a Mammoth one.

6624
03:45:24,160 --> 03:45:25,800
The stake is 150 points.

6625
03:45:26,500 --> 03:45:27,560
Do it, do it, do it.

6626
03:45:28,200 --> 03:45:29,200
Is that day one?

6627
03:45:29,280 --> 03:45:29,620
Can anyone cook it?

6628
03:45:30,000 --> 03:45:30,440
Yeah, yeah.

6629
03:45:30,740 --> 03:45:32,520
Wait, what level do we need to cook it?

6630
03:45:33,180 --> 03:45:33,840
Any level.

6631
03:45:34,060 --> 03:45:34,420
Yeah.

6632
03:45:34,720 --> 03:45:35,800
Should it be any level?

6633
03:45:37,240 --> 03:45:38,360
Find me a Mammoth.

6634
03:45:38,800 --> 03:45:39,680
Um, spawn.

6635
03:45:39,900 --> 03:45:41,000
Find you a Mammoth?

6636
03:45:41,060 --> 03:45:42,400
There's one in the starting zone.

6637
03:45:42,480 --> 03:45:45,300
That one is the boss one.

6638
03:45:45,960 --> 03:45:47,500
You just got killed a boss.

6639
03:45:47,580 --> 03:45:49,980
I saw a couple near me.

6640
03:45:50,180 --> 03:45:51,000
At the start.

6641
03:45:51,100 --> 03:45:51,840
Isn't that one a...

6642
03:45:51,880 --> 03:45:53,880
No, that's... yeah, that's one of the bosses, so...

6643
03:45:54,580 --> 03:45:56,520
I think I know where a couple men are.

6644
03:45:56,660 --> 03:45:57,080
I spawned.

6645
03:45:57,120 --> 03:45:57,700
I forget the...

6646
03:45:58,340 --> 03:45:59,420
Yeah, I've seen some too.

6647
03:46:01,040 --> 03:46:03,120
Multiple clips that count towards it.

6648
03:46:03,180 --> 03:46:07,180
If I didn't catch them fast enough to make it all just in one clip, I guess.

6649
03:46:07,340 --> 03:46:07,720
Sure.

6650
03:46:09,520 --> 03:46:10,700
I'm near the waypoint.

6651
03:46:10,960 --> 03:46:14,260
Which means there could be a dungeon entrance over here somewhere.

6652
03:46:15,140 --> 03:46:17,300
Oh, non-boss one can spawn near the boss.

6653
03:46:19,660 --> 03:46:20,080
Okay.

6654
03:46:20,200 --> 03:46:21,620
I'm trying to catch these other...

6655
03:46:21,880 --> 03:46:22,580
motherfuckers though.

6656
03:46:23,680 --> 03:46:24,660
Are you serious?

6657
03:46:24,880 --> 03:46:25,480
They're all dead.

6658
03:46:26,460 --> 03:46:28,220
That sounds like a lot of guns.

6659
03:46:28,520 --> 03:46:29,160
I'm gonna...

6660
03:46:29,700 --> 03:46:30,960
God damn it, I'm too strong.

6661
03:46:31,340 --> 03:46:34,340
I have a moo-cow for breeding since we need milk.

6662
03:46:35,780 --> 03:46:37,100
I found the entrance.

6663
03:46:37,480 --> 03:46:39,020
We found the entrance for the dungeon?

6664
03:46:39,740 --> 03:46:40,080
Yep.

6665
03:46:40,100 --> 03:46:40,460
Oh, okay.

6666
03:46:40,620 --> 03:46:41,520
Are we all ready to go?

6667
03:46:41,700 --> 03:46:44,720
Let me join because then we can catch the humans in there.

6668
03:46:44,860 --> 03:46:45,260
Yeah, we can go.

6669
03:46:45,880 --> 03:46:48,680
Actually, there's humans over here and they're level 7.

6670
03:46:48,920 --> 03:46:49,600
Oh, okay.

6671
03:46:50,100 --> 03:46:51,680
I found a fucking human.

6672
03:46:51,820 --> 03:46:52,520
I'm literally surrounded.

6673
03:46:53,220 --> 03:46:54,240
I'm heading over now.

6674
03:46:54,500 --> 03:46:56,840
The dungeon is still around for another 98 minutes.

6675
03:46:57,840 --> 03:46:59,360
Are we all ready to go?

6676
03:46:59,480 --> 03:47:00,060
Sheriff, are you ready?

6677
03:47:00,760 --> 03:47:01,240
No.

6678
03:47:01,540 --> 03:47:02,020
Okay.

6679
03:47:04,740 --> 03:47:05,640
Where's the dungeon?

6680
03:47:06,540 --> 03:47:07,700
Where I am.

6681
03:47:08,620 --> 03:47:09,580
Where's Peepee?

6682
03:47:09,720 --> 03:47:10,000
Okay.

6683
03:47:10,140 --> 03:47:11,180
Yeah, I can make it then.

6684
03:47:12,000 --> 03:47:12,920
Reasonable time.

6685
03:47:13,400 --> 03:47:15,140
There's so many humans here.

6686
03:47:15,260 --> 03:47:16,300
Whose giga spears is this?

6687
03:47:17,460 --> 03:47:17,940
Mine.

6688
03:47:18,080 --> 03:47:18,460
Yours now.

6689
03:47:19,560 --> 03:47:22,520
Don't say I need those for the high level.

6690
03:47:24,580 --> 03:47:25,640
This is mutiny.

6691
03:47:25,820 --> 03:47:26,480
Okay, here.

6692
03:47:26,840 --> 03:47:28,240
I'm helping you craft them.

6693
03:47:28,400 --> 03:47:30,180
Take your... Where are you?

6694
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:31,740
It's done crafting.

6695
03:47:31,740 --> 03:47:32,640
I'm killing the Bonjuri alpha.

6696
03:47:33,320 --> 03:47:34,980
Okay, it's done crafting.

6697
03:47:35,940 --> 03:47:37,400
I'll go make my own.

6698
03:47:39,140 --> 03:47:39,620
Fine.

6699
03:47:41,260 --> 03:47:44,420
Okay, I have one level 10 human.

6700
03:47:44,480 --> 03:47:45,060
How many did we need?

6701
03:47:45,060 --> 03:47:45,800
No, they're all dying.

6702
03:47:46,300 --> 03:47:47,340
They're being killed by random pals.

6703
03:47:48,680 --> 03:47:49,340
Oh, fuck.

6704
03:47:49,580 --> 03:47:50,560
Oh, no, he's dead!

6705
03:47:50,800 --> 03:47:54,120
Oh, wait, they're not being killed by random pals.

6706
03:47:54,180 --> 03:47:55,660
They're being killed by my pals!

6707
03:47:55,920 --> 03:47:56,280
Stupid.

6708
03:47:56,280 --> 03:47:56,840
Oh, no.

6709
03:47:57,400 --> 03:47:57,800
Nice.

6710
03:47:59,100 --> 03:48:00,080
You're doing your part.

6711
03:48:03,040 --> 03:48:03,920
Let's see what it is.

6712
03:48:03,920 --> 03:48:04,540
I can...

6713
03:48:05,820 --> 03:48:07,000
What the fuck?

6714
03:48:07,680 --> 03:48:08,660
Ben, are we okay?

6715
03:48:09,860 --> 03:48:10,740
My game crashed.

6716
03:48:11,260 --> 03:48:13,140
There's still more people over here, though.

6717
03:48:13,820 --> 03:48:14,800
Somewhere around here.

6718
03:48:16,580 --> 03:48:18,220
I have two level 10 humans.

6719
03:48:18,220 --> 03:48:21,580
There's like a crap ton of the Pal Alliance devout people.

6720
03:48:22,300 --> 03:48:22,700
There's like a crap ton of the Pal Alliance devout people.

6721
03:48:22,700 --> 03:48:22,700
Wait.

6722
03:48:23,320 --> 03:48:25,760
We don't have the clip of the traps.

6723
03:48:27,140 --> 03:48:27,940
In the...

6724
03:48:27,940 --> 03:48:29,420
In our team thing.

6725
03:48:30,040 --> 03:48:30,940
Did we do it?

6726
03:48:31,140 --> 03:48:32,560
I thought we really did it.

6727
03:48:32,820 --> 03:48:33,560
Oh, okay.

6728
03:48:36,080 --> 03:48:37,480
Can we track down that clip?

6729
03:48:38,220 --> 03:48:39,020
Oh, they did it.

6730
03:48:39,080 --> 03:48:39,680
They just did it.

6731
03:48:40,280 --> 03:48:41,300
They just did it.

6732
03:48:41,300 --> 03:48:41,340
Thank you.

6733
03:48:41,460 --> 03:48:42,740
I called them out and they did it.

6734
03:48:45,020 --> 03:48:45,380
Amazing.

6735
03:48:45,500 --> 03:48:45,800
Fuck!

6736
03:48:45,940 --> 03:48:46,300
Okay.

6737
03:48:46,480 --> 03:48:47,900
Well, it's not great.

6738
03:48:48,480 --> 03:48:49,720
No, that's not what I wanted.

6739
03:48:50,000 --> 03:48:51,200
One of the writers died.

6740
03:48:52,320 --> 03:48:53,420
I only caught one.

6741
03:48:54,300 --> 03:48:54,680
That's fine.

6742
03:48:54,800 --> 03:48:55,620
We just need two more.

6743
03:48:55,620 --> 03:48:56,160
The rest isn't high level enough.

6744
03:48:56,460 --> 03:48:57,240
We just need two more.

6745
03:48:58,520 --> 03:49:01,560
Okay, I'm trying to catch this level 22 human.

6746
03:49:01,620 --> 03:49:02,540
Oh, no.

6747
03:49:02,600 --> 03:49:03,880
He did not want to be caught, I guess.

6748
03:49:06,020 --> 03:49:06,380
Wait.

6749
03:49:06,660 --> 03:49:10,260
Can someone clip the two humans I caught?

6750
03:49:10,260 --> 03:49:12,000
Because we have to compile all of them together.

6751
03:49:14,680 --> 03:49:15,720
Do we have a Kingpaka?

6752
03:49:15,960 --> 03:49:16,760
I don't think we did.

6753
03:49:16,980 --> 03:49:17,940
Yeah, I'm going to catch a Kingpaka.

6754
03:49:17,940 --> 03:49:19,320
While we wait then.

6755
03:49:23,200 --> 03:49:23,600
Someone...

6756
03:49:23,600 --> 03:49:25,320
Can someone clip the two humans I caught?

6757
03:49:25,500 --> 03:49:26,720
I don't know where...

6758
03:49:26,720 --> 03:49:28,560
Oh, we got to screenshot them in the Pal box.

6759
03:49:28,760 --> 03:49:30,280
I just caught a level 22 human.

6760
03:49:30,440 --> 03:49:31,100
Can somebody clip that?

6761
03:49:31,280 --> 03:49:31,620
Nice.

6762
03:49:31,740 --> 03:49:32,140
Okay.

6763
03:49:33,760 --> 03:49:35,520
Where the fuck is the Kingpaka?

6764
03:49:36,360 --> 03:49:36,980
Where are you?

6765
03:49:38,060 --> 03:49:39,560
Kingpaka is near our base.

6766
03:49:39,840 --> 03:49:40,420
Yeah, I know.

6767
03:49:40,480 --> 03:49:41,520
I flew the wrong way.

6768
03:49:47,410 --> 03:49:49,130
Alright, let me see if there are any other humans around.

6769
03:49:56,860 --> 03:49:57,300
Uhhhh...

6770
03:49:58,380 --> 03:49:59,400
How much time we got left?

6771
03:49:59,660 --> 03:50:00,400
Uh, 38.

6772
03:50:01,140 --> 03:50:01,580
Okay.

6773
03:50:03,760 --> 03:50:04,200
Uhhhh...

6774
03:50:04,760 --> 03:50:07,460
I might fly back and put a stop in the incubator.

6775
03:50:08,140 --> 03:50:09,360
Bro, have you marked it?

6776
03:50:09,500 --> 03:50:11,680
I have some guys in the incubator.

6777
03:50:12,240 --> 03:50:12,780
Oh, okay.

6778
03:50:13,680 --> 03:50:15,680
I just picked up a large dark.

6779
03:50:16,160 --> 03:50:19,400
A huge fire egg and a huge dragon egg in there.

6780
03:50:19,460 --> 03:50:19,520
Let's go.

6781
03:50:19,520 --> 03:50:20,600
Oh, dragon!

6782
03:50:20,880 --> 03:50:21,380
Let's go!

6783
03:50:21,920 --> 03:50:24,420
I'm pretty sure it's the fire dragon.

6784
03:50:24,560 --> 03:50:24,640
I guess.

6785
03:50:24,940 --> 03:50:25,400
Yeah!

6786
03:50:27,060 --> 03:50:28,200
That's the best one.

6787
03:50:28,300 --> 03:50:29,400
That's literally the best pal.

6788
03:50:31,260 --> 03:50:33,260
Fucking black and red Gyarados looking.

6789
03:50:35,760 --> 03:50:37,500
Okay, there's more people over here.

6790
03:50:37,580 --> 03:50:39,540
There's more human beings over here.

6791
03:50:39,620 --> 03:50:40,600
I'm gonna try to catch a couple.

6792
03:50:42,460 --> 03:50:43,760
Come on, Van Worm.

6793
03:50:43,820 --> 03:50:44,540
You got this.

6794
03:50:45,580 --> 03:50:46,380
Oh, shit!

6795
03:50:46,420 --> 03:50:47,060
Not the Rush Boar.

6796
03:50:48,000 --> 03:50:49,000
Random Rush Boar.

6797
03:50:49,660 --> 03:50:50,860
I can catch him though.

6798
03:50:53,840 --> 03:50:56,900
Alright, we're just gonna keep throwing balls at him and see if we can catch him.

6799
03:50:58,060 --> 03:50:58,280
No!

6800
03:50:59,020 --> 03:50:59,980
Wait, is that a...

6801
03:50:59,980 --> 03:51:01,860
Oh, he's fucking dead.

6802
03:51:02,280 --> 03:51:03,060
Oh, no.

6803
03:51:03,300 --> 03:51:04,060
He's a corpse.

6804
03:51:04,260 --> 03:51:05,060
Can't catch him.

6805
03:51:05,140 --> 03:51:05,420
He's dead.

6806
03:51:07,980 --> 03:51:10,340
The wild pals are killing him before we can.

6807
03:51:10,560 --> 03:51:11,440
The humans?

6808
03:51:11,740 --> 03:51:12,140
Yeah.

6809
03:51:12,840 --> 03:51:15,640
That's why you can catch the pals and the human at the same time.

6810
03:51:16,220 --> 03:51:16,620
True.

6811
03:51:20,240 --> 03:51:20,600
Yeah.

6812
03:51:20,780 --> 03:51:21,100
Yeah.

6813
03:51:22,020 --> 03:51:22,940
Alright, should I...

6814
03:51:22,940 --> 03:51:24,720
Should I come back to base or are we ready to go to the dungeon?

6815
03:51:25,420 --> 03:51:27,500
Go back to base because Surefour's not ready yet.

6816
03:51:29,060 --> 03:51:31,220
He's doing catching stuff, right?

6817
03:51:31,640 --> 03:51:32,360
Sounds good.

6818
03:51:36,310 --> 03:51:37,630
I need more hyperspheres.

6819
03:51:40,030 --> 03:51:41,430
These are high level mobs.

6820
03:51:41,530 --> 03:51:43,450
Tell them to stop taking their Ritalin.

6821
03:51:44,130 --> 03:51:45,290
That's how you get hyperspheres.

6822
03:51:46,670 --> 03:51:47,950
Come on, Grinto.

6823
03:51:48,850 --> 03:51:49,270
Grintoo.

6824
03:51:50,410 --> 03:51:52,190
Why is the boss not spawned?

6825
03:51:52,230 --> 03:51:53,470
Did someone catch this guy?

6826
03:51:53,570 --> 03:51:53,890
Which one?

6827
03:51:55,030 --> 03:51:55,450
Fangalope?

6828
03:51:56,670 --> 03:51:57,710
You caught him?

6829
03:51:58,270 --> 03:51:58,690
No.

6830
03:51:59,970 --> 03:52:01,910
Yes, you said you caught a fangalope, didn't you?

6831
03:52:03,430 --> 03:52:03,850
No.

6832
03:52:04,610 --> 03:52:06,590
It doesn't say on the map that I did.

6833
03:52:06,870 --> 03:52:08,530
Oh, I thought you caught him.

6834
03:52:09,210 --> 03:52:10,450
Did I catch him?

6835
03:52:11,650 --> 03:52:13,410
What does the fangalope look like?

6836
03:52:13,630 --> 03:52:14,130
I don't remember.

6837
03:52:14,370 --> 03:52:15,270
It's on me on the map.

6838
03:52:15,990 --> 03:52:16,390
Oh.

6839
03:52:17,150 --> 03:52:18,410
Oh, you have a patalia.

6840
03:52:18,490 --> 03:52:19,370
I thought you caught the...

6841
03:52:19,370 --> 03:52:21,930
No, I've never even been over there before.

6842
03:52:22,550 --> 03:52:22,950
Yay!

6843
03:52:23,370 --> 03:52:25,150
I caught the Kingpaka!

6844
03:52:25,170 --> 03:52:26,050
We have a bug!

6845
03:52:26,470 --> 03:52:26,870
Nice!

6846
03:52:27,170 --> 03:52:27,930
Kingpaka, clip it!

6847
03:52:28,050 --> 03:52:28,650
Clip, clip, clip!

6848
03:52:29,570 --> 03:52:33,150
So, what are we supposed to do?

6849
03:52:33,190 --> 03:52:35,190
Are we going to get complimentary points for that?

6850
03:52:35,330 --> 03:52:36,530
We skip it for now?

6851
03:52:37,090 --> 03:52:37,810
Question mark?

6852
03:52:38,610 --> 03:52:41,210
Sometimes he falls through the floor and dies.

6853
03:52:41,370 --> 03:52:42,730
Oh, sometimes he just dies.

6854
03:52:42,790 --> 03:52:43,110
Okay.

6855
03:52:45,290 --> 03:52:45,430
Cool!

6856
03:52:45,510 --> 03:52:47,490
I better get half points for trying.

6857
03:52:49,610 --> 03:52:50,650
Alright, clip it!

6858
03:52:50,730 --> 03:52:51,710
Half points for trying!

6859
03:52:52,230 --> 03:52:52,950
That's what I'm saying.

6860
03:52:55,110 --> 03:52:55,770
Oh, no.

6861
03:52:55,850 --> 03:52:56,830
My game is broken.

6862
03:52:57,010 --> 03:52:57,930
Why is it like this?

6863
03:53:00,990 --> 03:53:01,390
Okay.

6864
03:53:01,950 --> 03:53:02,630
What the heck?

6865
03:53:05,210 --> 03:53:06,430
Alright, I made an egg.

6866
03:53:06,850 --> 03:53:09,810
I made an egg chest, so if you have eggs, please put them in there.

6867
03:53:09,970 --> 03:53:10,870
Alright, yeah, no problem.

6868
03:53:15,160 --> 03:53:15,520
Yeah.

6869
03:53:15,520 --> 03:53:18,040
Does everyone have a flying pet so we can get to that one island?

6870
03:53:18,400 --> 03:53:18,760
Yeah.

6871
03:53:19,020 --> 03:53:22,820
Wait, why do we need to go to the island?

6872
03:53:23,100 --> 03:53:28,480
Put that mofuckin' hospital because that one place that we need to take a screenshot is an island.

6873
03:53:28,540 --> 03:53:29,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, we can.

6874
03:53:29,780 --> 03:53:31,960
We can do it the last 20 minutes or something.

6875
03:53:33,960 --> 03:53:35,640
We're almost at the last 20 minutes!

6876
03:53:35,660 --> 03:53:36,320
Oh, wait, we're okay.

6877
03:53:36,400 --> 03:53:36,980
That's okay.

6878
03:53:39,340 --> 03:53:40,480
Let's do the dungeon first.

6879
03:53:41,100 --> 03:53:41,500
Alright.

6880
03:53:42,100 --> 03:53:42,900
I'm on my way.

6881
03:53:43,720 --> 03:53:45,120
Okay, I'll go back to the dungeon then.

6882
03:53:45,180 --> 03:53:46,600
These guys I need to kill though.

6883
03:53:47,440 --> 03:53:49,860
Are you close to a fast travel?

6884
03:53:50,880 --> 03:53:51,680
I don't know.

6885
03:53:51,960 --> 03:53:52,360
Maybe?

6886
03:53:52,760 --> 03:53:53,160
Yeah.

6887
03:53:53,220 --> 03:53:54,480
Our pals are hungry.

6888
03:53:54,540 --> 03:53:55,400
I think we have no food.

6889
03:53:56,100 --> 03:53:57,320
I'm putting food in right now.

6890
03:53:58,700 --> 03:53:59,100
Whoops.

6891
03:54:00,540 --> 03:54:04,820
Yeah, because none of them were like transporting anything to the thing, so they've run out of food.

6892
03:54:06,440 --> 03:54:06,840
Alright.

6893
03:54:09,260 --> 03:54:09,940
Big oof.

6894
03:54:16,500 --> 03:54:17,580
I'm heading over.

6895
03:54:17,860 --> 03:54:19,460
I'm heading over to the base.

6896
03:54:20,140 --> 03:54:21,380
Let's go get ready.

6897
03:54:21,580 --> 03:54:24,360
We just need Shur for the final fast travel so he can get to us.

6898
03:54:25,140 --> 03:54:25,580
Okay.

6899
03:54:26,760 --> 03:54:28,260
I just found one.

6900
03:54:28,460 --> 03:54:29,200
I'm flying over.

6901
03:54:30,560 --> 03:54:31,580
Yeah, I'll just follow.

6902
03:54:32,620 --> 03:54:33,060
Okay.

6903
03:54:34,780 --> 03:54:38,340
The best fast travel spot is up here at the ancient ruins if you can make it up there.

6904
03:54:38,480 --> 03:54:40,400
The bridge is also fine though.

6905
03:54:41,560 --> 03:54:43,460
I'm heading over to the base.

6906
03:54:44,920 --> 03:54:46,580
We have high level humans here.

6907
03:54:46,660 --> 03:54:48,780
How many more do we need?

6908
03:54:48,840 --> 03:54:49,260
For humans?

6909
03:54:50,040 --> 03:54:52,260
I have one so two more?

6910
03:54:52,520 --> 03:54:52,900
Okay.

6911
03:54:53,940 --> 03:54:54,920
There's enough here.

6912
03:54:55,300 --> 03:54:56,240
No, these are level 3.

6913
03:54:59,260 --> 03:55:00,180
Where's the cave?

6914
03:55:00,960 --> 03:55:01,920
Head to Peepee.

6915
03:55:03,280 --> 03:55:04,580
I'm on her.

6916
03:55:05,160 --> 03:55:05,720
Okay.

6917
03:55:05,980 --> 03:55:07,720
We're flying over right now.

6918
03:55:09,920 --> 03:55:11,100
We killed them all.

6919
03:55:12,080 --> 03:55:13,040
Except for this one.

6920
03:55:14,500 --> 03:55:15,940
I'm gonna use the wolf.

6921
03:55:16,360 --> 03:55:18,040
Actually, the wolf should be faster.

6922
03:55:20,320 --> 03:55:20,800
Nice.

6923
03:55:22,060 --> 03:55:22,780
Not nice.

6924
03:55:23,680 --> 03:55:24,440
Oh, fuck.

6925
03:55:24,880 --> 03:55:27,360
Did you guys kill the humans?

6926
03:55:28,160 --> 03:55:28,180
Yeah.

6927
03:55:28,420 --> 03:55:29,400
There's plenty more.

6928
03:55:31,420 --> 03:55:34,760
Look, I can't say that without my lawyer present.

6929
03:55:35,380 --> 03:55:35,980
Let's see.

6930
03:55:35,980 --> 03:55:37,840
Not comfortable speaking on that issue.

6931
03:55:38,220 --> 03:55:39,180
There's a human here.

6932
03:55:39,800 --> 03:55:40,820
Nah, I'm not gonna kill it.

6933
03:55:41,100 --> 03:55:42,760
The dungeon's right over here.

6934
03:55:43,120 --> 03:55:43,900
Yeah, I'm heading over.

6935
03:55:44,600 --> 03:55:44,920
Okay.

6936
03:55:45,400 --> 03:55:48,340
Oh, there's one more Free Panel Alliance devotee.

6937
03:55:48,340 --> 03:55:49,580
I can probably get him, maybe.

6938
03:55:51,900 --> 03:55:52,740
Oh, there's a couple.

6939
03:55:52,820 --> 03:55:53,580
Actually, there's a couple.

6940
03:55:55,400 --> 03:55:58,360
If anybody has the nice spheres, they might have a better chance of getting him.

6941
03:55:58,700 --> 03:55:59,560
I'm almost there.

6942
03:56:00,700 --> 03:56:01,020
Okay.

6943
03:56:01,100 --> 03:56:02,000
Are you close to dungeon?

6944
03:56:02,940 --> 03:56:04,120
Yeah, I'm right in front of it.

6945
03:56:04,220 --> 03:56:04,600
Oh, okay.

6946
03:56:04,860 --> 03:56:05,720
Okay, I caught another one.

6947
03:56:05,760 --> 03:56:06,680
Clip it, clip it, clip it, clip it.

6948
03:56:06,720 --> 03:56:07,360
He was level 17.

6949
03:56:07,500 --> 03:56:10,420
Level 17, so we need two more, right?

6950
03:56:10,680 --> 03:56:11,000
Yeah.

6951
03:56:12,760 --> 03:56:13,140
Oh, we need one more.

6952
03:56:13,460 --> 03:56:14,160
Yeah, one more.

6953
03:56:16,200 --> 03:56:17,800
There was one, but I just killed it.

6954
03:56:19,600 --> 03:56:20,600
Alright, I'm here.

6955
03:56:20,840 --> 03:56:21,560
Wherever you are.

6956
03:56:22,480 --> 03:56:23,320
Wait, where are you?

6957
03:56:23,520 --> 03:56:23,960
Oh, I'm right here.

6958
03:56:24,080 --> 03:56:24,460
Oh, god.

6959
03:56:24,540 --> 03:56:25,940
I'm being attacked by everything.

6960
03:56:26,440 --> 03:56:28,080
One of my chatters gave us the...

6961
03:56:28,600 --> 03:56:28,960
Huh?

6962
03:56:30,440 --> 03:56:31,020
One sec.

6963
03:56:31,400 --> 03:56:32,260
Your chat needs you.

6964
03:56:33,680 --> 03:56:34,860
What did your chat do?

6965
03:56:37,080 --> 03:56:42,080
Someone's saying we can just build one of the PAL bases in that area and then just teleport to it, but I don't know.

6966
03:56:42,760 --> 03:56:44,200
But we already have two PAL bases.

6967
03:56:44,380 --> 03:56:44,940
I mean...

6968
03:56:45,420 --> 03:56:47,640
You can just dismantle it.

6969
03:56:47,900 --> 03:56:49,020
Anyways, get in the dungeon.

6970
03:56:49,060 --> 03:56:50,560
I'm here now.

6971
03:56:50,820 --> 03:56:51,540
Are we all here?

6972
03:56:51,720 --> 03:56:52,000
I'm going to dungeon.

6973
03:56:52,960 --> 03:56:54,640
Wait, I'm not in the dungeon yet.

6974
03:56:54,700 --> 03:56:57,040
I need to finish catching this one real quick.

6975
03:56:57,900 --> 03:56:58,300
Don't worry.

6976
03:56:59,200 --> 03:57:00,300
Wait, what are you trying to catch?

6977
03:57:01,400 --> 03:57:02,200
A glider.

6978
03:57:03,020 --> 03:57:04,520
There's only one person who needs to go over there.

6979
03:57:04,520 --> 03:57:05,180
Where is he going?

6980
03:57:05,320 --> 03:57:05,840
He's just...

6981
03:57:06,460 --> 03:57:07,440
He's just zooming off.

6982
03:57:08,100 --> 03:57:10,320
I guess we're going in.

6983
03:57:10,320 --> 03:57:11,180
Alright, ready?

6984
03:57:11,380 --> 03:57:13,360
Alright, let's go.

6985
03:57:14,600 --> 03:57:15,380
Hope I don't crash.

6986
03:57:15,520 --> 03:57:16,300
He's just fucking going.

6987
03:57:17,380 --> 03:57:18,000
Don't crash.

6988
03:57:20,440 --> 03:57:21,320
Alright, let's go.

6989
03:57:21,460 --> 03:57:22,520
We just need one human anyway.

6990
03:57:23,540 --> 03:57:24,440
We're flying, right?

6991
03:57:26,980 --> 03:57:27,380
Okay.

6992
03:57:27,480 --> 03:57:29,360
Is one of us catching the one human?

6993
03:57:30,360 --> 03:57:32,260
I have a couple balls, but I probably have the lowest chance.

6994
03:57:32,260 --> 03:57:32,900
We still need to catch one human.

6995
03:57:33,420 --> 03:57:37,060
Does anyone know which is the boss room for this one?

6996
03:57:37,120 --> 03:57:37,520
I don't remember.

6997
03:57:38,040 --> 03:57:38,940
Do not remember.

6998
03:57:40,620 --> 03:57:41,060
Probably.

6999
03:57:41,600 --> 03:57:43,160
I'm trying to catch this motherfucker.

7000
03:57:44,020 --> 03:57:45,260
What if I catch it?

7001
03:57:47,880 --> 03:57:49,640
Oh, there's bees coming from here.

7002
03:57:50,280 --> 03:57:51,300
Don't we need to catch these?

7003
03:57:52,420 --> 03:57:53,600
I don't think it's the bees.

7004
03:57:53,720 --> 03:57:55,760
We need the little tweens that blow up.

7005
03:57:55,940 --> 03:57:56,820
Oh, I have two of them.

7006
03:57:57,420 --> 03:57:58,280
We need the queen.

7007
03:57:58,960 --> 03:58:00,480
It's not the bee guards, it's the queen.

7008
03:58:00,800 --> 03:58:02,860
I think they have what it takes to make a move.

7009
03:58:03,600 --> 03:58:04,480
The ping!

7010
03:58:05,460 --> 03:58:06,320
It's okay, I got away.

7011
03:58:08,660 --> 03:58:09,800
Oh, there's a human.

7012
03:58:11,360 --> 03:58:12,480
Okay, it's not to the right.

7013
03:58:13,340 --> 03:58:13,660
Okay.

7014
03:58:14,020 --> 03:58:15,000
Oh, that's too high a level.

7015
03:58:15,060 --> 03:58:15,840
I cannot catch those.

7016
03:58:15,900 --> 03:58:16,040
Is it the main?

7017
03:58:18,280 --> 03:58:18,600
Straight?

7018
03:58:23,500 --> 03:58:24,140
Oh, shit.

7019
03:58:26,620 --> 03:58:27,980
Uh, which way did we go?

7020
03:58:28,520 --> 03:58:30,220
Usually it's this water path.

7021
03:58:30,320 --> 03:58:30,560
Oh, shit.

7022
03:58:32,720 --> 03:58:33,740
Okay, it's fine.

7023
03:58:33,800 --> 03:58:35,080
Oh, shit.

7024
03:58:35,380 --> 03:58:36,800
Yeah, it's right here.

7025
03:58:37,700 --> 03:58:38,220
Okay, cool.

7026
03:58:38,380 --> 03:58:39,180
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

7027
03:58:39,180 --> 03:58:39,980
Give me a sec, guys.

7028
03:58:39,980 --> 03:58:40,680
Let me catch this.

7029
03:58:41,520 --> 03:58:42,760
Alright, take your time.

7030
03:58:42,760 --> 03:58:45,040
Give me a sec, I'm trying to catch this bee guard real fast.

7031
03:58:45,500 --> 03:58:46,240
Get it, get it.

7032
03:58:47,120 --> 03:58:48,260
It's the hot one!

7033
03:58:49,180 --> 03:58:50,140
I love her.

7034
03:58:50,140 --> 03:58:51,060
I love her!

7035
03:58:52,680 --> 03:58:55,000
She's making me listen to them!

7036
03:58:55,280 --> 03:58:57,180
She's making me question things.

7037
03:58:57,400 --> 03:58:59,780
No one ever listens to the flesh tuber!

7038
03:59:01,660 --> 03:59:02,800
I'm sorry, what did you say?

7039
03:59:03,200 --> 03:59:04,240
Don't worry about it.

7040
03:59:05,060 --> 03:59:06,240
You were saying sorry?

7041
03:59:06,240 --> 03:59:07,120
Okay, I'm here.

7042
03:59:07,260 --> 03:59:07,880
Let's go.

7043
03:59:08,720 --> 03:59:10,140
Are we using Giga?

7044
03:59:10,300 --> 03:59:11,140
Does anybody have Giga?

7045
03:59:11,500 --> 03:59:12,540
Yeah, surefour has a lot.

7046
03:59:13,340 --> 03:59:14,300
Not a lot.

7047
03:59:14,500 --> 03:59:15,340
I wish I had a lot.

7048
03:59:15,620 --> 03:59:17,040
He has just enough.

7049
03:59:17,800 --> 03:59:18,420
Get him.

7050
03:59:23,850 --> 03:59:24,790
Alright, he's frozen.

7051
03:59:27,230 --> 03:59:28,190
It's a heat.

7052
03:59:28,330 --> 03:59:28,910
He's frozen.

7053
03:59:31,430 --> 03:59:32,890
But maybe it's a heat.

7054
03:59:32,950 --> 03:59:33,670
You never know.

7055
03:59:34,050 --> 03:59:34,390
Yeah, maybe.

7056
03:59:34,570 --> 03:59:35,950
He's just trying to express himself.

7057
03:59:36,310 --> 03:59:37,030
You don't know.

7058
03:59:37,090 --> 03:59:37,630
It doesn't say.

7059
03:59:39,150 --> 03:59:40,670
There's no male-female sign on there.

7060
03:59:42,130 --> 03:59:42,810
I...

7061
03:59:42,810 --> 03:59:44,630
I wanted to be a female.

7062
03:59:46,970 --> 03:59:49,670
Let your imagination run wild.

7063
03:59:50,170 --> 03:59:52,770
There's no laws against Pokemon, Batman.

7064
03:59:54,430 --> 03:59:55,870
We're at 30%.

7065
03:59:55,870 --> 03:59:56,790
Be careful.

7066
03:59:57,010 --> 03:59:59,290
I'm retrieving my pal.

7067
04:00:05,340 --> 04:00:06,660
My pal is retrieved.

7068
04:00:07,060 --> 04:00:07,780
First try?

7069
04:00:10,900 --> 04:00:11,520
Clip, clip, clip.

7070
04:00:12,000 --> 04:00:12,860
Clip, clip, clip.

7071
04:00:14,500 --> 04:00:15,240
Clip, clip, clip.

7072
04:00:15,680 --> 04:00:16,580
Nice, nice, nice.

7073
04:00:16,940 --> 04:00:18,700
Wanna know what I called Batman?

7074
04:00:21,100 --> 04:00:22,480
I called him little punny Batman.

7075
04:00:25,540 --> 04:00:26,820
Alright, we got another dungeon.

7076
04:00:27,080 --> 04:00:28,700
We should take a photo with our reincarnated guy now.

7077
04:00:28,760 --> 04:00:29,260
Since we're all here.

7078
04:00:29,960 --> 04:00:30,780
Where do we have to go?

7079
04:00:31,860 --> 04:00:33,420
He's not over here.

7080
04:00:33,720 --> 04:00:34,700
Get the person.

7081
04:00:35,640 --> 04:00:37,580
He's a little sub-tig.

7082
04:00:37,900 --> 04:00:38,620
Catch him.

7083
04:00:38,840 --> 04:00:39,300
Catch him.

7084
04:00:39,320 --> 04:00:39,320
Catch him.

7085
04:00:39,360 --> 04:00:39,600
Catch him.

7086
04:00:41,120 --> 04:00:42,360
Level 21, too.

7087
04:00:42,520 --> 04:00:43,240
You gonna help?

7088
04:00:43,680 --> 04:00:44,900
He's freaking running.

7089
04:00:45,120 --> 04:00:47,500
This one's gonna get killed.

7090
04:00:48,280 --> 04:00:49,540
I can catch him.

7091
04:00:49,680 --> 04:00:52,700
I think it went into your ball anyway.

7092
04:00:53,040 --> 04:00:53,660
Which is... oh, shit.

7093
04:00:53,820 --> 04:00:54,100
It's fine.

7094
04:00:54,180 --> 04:00:55,440
I can still try and catch.

7095
04:00:57,540 --> 04:00:59,280
I have 35 attempts.

7096
04:00:59,740 --> 04:00:59,840
GG.

7097
04:00:59,960 --> 04:01:00,380
GG.

7098
04:01:00,520 --> 04:01:02,500
We have all of it.

7099
04:01:02,640 --> 04:01:03,360
Clip, clip, clip.

7100
04:01:03,800 --> 04:01:04,420
We have five.

7101
04:01:05,400 --> 04:01:06,740
We have five humans.

7102
04:01:07,760 --> 04:01:09,400
When do we have to put them in jail?

7103
04:01:09,480 --> 04:01:09,900
By tomorrow?

7104
04:01:10,520 --> 04:01:11,440
By tomorrow.

7105
04:01:11,600 --> 04:01:12,040
It's a global.

7106
04:01:13,660 --> 04:01:14,420
Clip, clip, clip.

7107
04:01:14,820 --> 04:01:16,100
Do we need more humans?

7108
04:01:16,960 --> 04:01:18,460
I don't know actually.

7109
04:01:18,800 --> 04:01:19,740
We could get them later.

7110
04:01:20,080 --> 04:01:22,760
Let's grab the fast travel.

7111
04:01:23,000 --> 04:01:23,760
And then...

7112
04:01:25,160 --> 04:01:27,480
And then we do the reincarnated guy photo.

7113
04:01:28,740 --> 04:01:29,300
Follow me.

7114
04:01:29,300 --> 04:01:31,780
Someone fly to the base and make a base.

7115
04:01:32,120 --> 04:01:35,340
And then during that I'll be trying to catch more thangs.

7116
04:01:35,340 --> 04:01:36,920
I'll dismantle your base.

7117
04:01:37,000 --> 04:01:39,420
You mean dismantle the second base?

7118
04:01:39,520 --> 04:01:40,720
You can dismantle it from the map.

7119
04:01:41,680 --> 04:01:43,000
I want to dismantle yours.

7120
04:01:43,080 --> 04:01:46,220
I just need someone else to fly there while I'm trying to kill the other bosses while I have time.

7121
04:01:46,580 --> 04:01:47,040
Oh, okay.

7122
04:01:47,500 --> 04:01:48,500
I'm trying to min-max.

7123
04:01:49,240 --> 04:01:50,900
You want me to dismantle your base now?

7124
04:01:51,040 --> 04:01:51,940
I can dismantle it now.

7125
04:01:53,580 --> 04:01:53,980
Sure.

7126
04:01:55,340 --> 04:01:56,140
I'm dismantling.

7127
04:02:01,260 --> 04:02:02,740
Alright, dismantling now.

7128
04:02:06,580 --> 04:02:06,980
The...

7129
04:02:07,920 --> 04:02:10,720
The mysterious guy is below the King Paka, right?

7130
04:02:10,920 --> 04:02:12,560
Yeah, I can... I'll fly over there now.

7131
04:02:14,720 --> 04:02:15,120
Uh...

7132
04:02:16,120 --> 04:02:16,640
Let's see.

7133
04:02:16,780 --> 04:02:17,140
Should I follow?

7134
04:02:17,400 --> 04:02:18,480
Do all four of us need to be there?

7135
04:02:18,480 --> 04:02:19,480
All four of us have to be there.

7136
04:02:19,480 --> 04:02:21,180
And then...

7137
04:02:21,920 --> 04:02:24,260
Like below that is where...

7138
04:02:24,900 --> 04:02:26,060
That one base is.

7139
04:02:26,320 --> 04:02:27,520
I need to get to level 30.

7140
04:02:27,680 --> 04:02:29,840
So after the photo I need to take a picture.

7141
04:02:31,360 --> 04:02:32,340
Not after the photo.

7142
04:02:32,380 --> 04:02:32,800
I need to like...

7143
04:02:32,800 --> 04:02:35,620
Power level to level 30 so my chicken can be level 30.

7144
04:02:36,380 --> 04:02:36,960
Is that...

7145
04:02:37,000 --> 04:02:37,540
Today or tomorrow?

7146
04:02:37,680 --> 04:02:37,840
Today.

7147
04:02:38,960 --> 04:02:41,720
I'm only level... I'm like level 28.

7148
04:02:41,720 --> 04:02:42,620
I need two more levels.

7149
04:02:43,660 --> 04:02:43,980
Uh...

7150
04:02:44,840 --> 04:02:46,200
Wait, does it have to be one person?

7151
04:02:46,280 --> 04:02:47,580
Technically you took it most of the way.

7152
04:02:47,640 --> 04:02:48,540
Can we give it to...

7153
04:02:49,080 --> 04:02:49,940
Can we give it to Shure?

7154
04:02:50,080 --> 04:02:50,620
And then...

7155
04:02:50,620 --> 04:02:51,020
Oh yeah!

7156
04:02:51,460 --> 04:02:52,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7157
04:02:52,900 --> 04:02:56,140
I'm gonna give you the chicken and you can high level the chicken to 30.

7158
04:02:56,520 --> 04:02:56,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7159
04:02:56,680 --> 04:02:57,900
Teamwork, teamwork makes teamwork.

7160
04:02:58,240 --> 04:02:59,160
Put it in the thing.

7161
04:02:59,320 --> 04:02:59,840
Okay, okay.

7162
04:03:03,660 --> 04:03:05,820
You start making the fucking ore.

7163
04:03:05,980 --> 04:03:06,680
Oh my goodness!

7164
04:03:07,200 --> 04:03:08,100
Oh my god!

7165
04:03:08,920 --> 04:03:10,100
That's character growth.

7166
04:03:10,480 --> 04:03:12,140
Alright, I'm putting it in the box.

7167
04:03:12,220 --> 04:03:15,440
You fucking power level the rest of this goddamn chicken.

7168
04:03:16,200 --> 04:03:16,600
Yeah.

7169
04:03:17,400 --> 04:03:18,120
Where'd you put it?

7170
04:03:18,260 --> 04:03:19,120
In the PAL box.

7171
04:03:19,820 --> 04:03:21,260
But where in the PAL box?

7172
04:03:21,300 --> 04:03:21,960
In the PALs in the base.

7173
04:03:22,620 --> 04:03:23,360
But where?

7174
04:03:23,400 --> 04:03:23,860
Like where?

7175
04:03:23,900 --> 04:03:24,720
Which one is it?

7176
04:03:24,860 --> 04:03:25,020
At the bottom.

7177
04:03:25,020 --> 04:03:25,380
It's the bottom.

7178
04:03:25,460 --> 04:03:26,120
It's the chicken.

7179
04:03:26,280 --> 04:03:27,040
There's only the chicken.

7180
04:03:27,040 --> 04:03:27,600
It's the one that's high level.

7181
04:03:27,780 --> 04:03:29,080
There's 5,000 chickens.

7182
04:03:29,280 --> 04:03:29,840
What do you mean?

7183
04:03:29,920 --> 04:03:30,540
It's in the...

7184
04:03:30,540 --> 04:03:30,720
It's in the working.

7185
04:03:30,720 --> 04:03:31,920
No, no, it's the one in the PALs at base.

7186
04:03:31,980 --> 04:03:33,100
Yeah, it's working.

7187
04:03:33,620 --> 04:03:34,260
That's like...

7188
04:03:34,260 --> 04:03:34,520
Yeah.

7189
04:03:35,780 --> 04:03:36,180
Dragoons.

7190
04:03:37,000 --> 04:03:39,080
Yeah, he'll be at level 30 in like a second then.

7191
04:03:39,180 --> 04:03:41,640
Like literally one battle and he'll probably pop up.

7192
04:03:41,760 --> 04:03:43,200
Alright, let's go to the reincarnated...

7193
04:03:43,200 --> 04:03:45,180
I marked the reincarnated guy.

7194
04:03:45,220 --> 04:03:45,660
Just follow me.

7195
04:03:45,980 --> 04:03:46,340
Okay.

7196
04:03:47,740 --> 04:03:49,740
He is... oh my gosh.

7197
04:03:49,860 --> 04:03:51,580
Are we flying there or are we...

7198
04:03:51,580 --> 04:03:51,920
No, no, no.

7199
04:03:52,000 --> 04:03:52,980
They're at the fast travel.

7200
04:03:53,420 --> 04:03:54,280
I'm heading over there.

7201
04:03:54,720 --> 04:03:55,120
Okay.

7202
04:03:58,320 --> 04:03:58,720
Okay.

7203
04:04:00,540 --> 04:04:01,580
Alright, fast travel.

7204
04:04:02,340 --> 04:04:03,540
Oh no, I don't have that one!

7205
04:04:03,900 --> 04:04:04,560
Okay, that's alright.

7206
04:04:06,100 --> 04:04:07,920
That's alright, I'll just fly there as fast as I can.

7207
04:04:08,040 --> 04:04:08,500
Just like...

7208
04:04:09,240 --> 04:04:09,560
Alright.

7209
04:04:13,620 --> 04:04:14,660
Am I going in the right direction?

7210
04:04:15,500 --> 04:04:16,040
Kind of.

7211
04:04:16,160 --> 04:04:17,260
Just follow me.

7212
04:04:18,160 --> 04:04:18,660
I'm flying.

7213
04:04:19,040 --> 04:04:19,360
Everybody.

7214
04:04:20,300 --> 04:04:21,760
I'm going as fast as I can.

7215
04:04:22,920 --> 04:04:24,620
I don't have that fast travel point.

7216
04:04:25,140 --> 04:04:25,840
Oh, I can see it though.

7217
04:04:25,920 --> 04:04:26,460
I can see it though.

7218
04:04:26,540 --> 04:04:27,300
So it should be easy.

7219
04:04:27,320 --> 04:04:30,140
Just follow me and then we can all take a picture.

7220
04:04:30,440 --> 04:04:30,760
Just follow me and then we can all take a picture.

7221
04:04:32,520 --> 04:04:34,600
I found him when I was lost.

7222
04:04:35,340 --> 04:04:36,380
And drowning.

7223
04:04:36,860 --> 04:04:38,340
Oh, you're talking about pizza guy!

7224
04:04:38,720 --> 04:04:40,040
Reincarnated guy, right here.

7225
04:04:40,880 --> 04:04:41,760
Okay, okay.

7226
04:04:42,420 --> 04:04:43,100
I'm here.

7227
04:04:44,600 --> 04:04:45,360
I'm flying.

7228
04:04:50,320 --> 04:04:51,100
Pizza guy.

7229
04:04:59,060 --> 04:05:00,600
Taking a picture in the dark.

7230
04:05:01,080 --> 04:05:02,680
Don't worry, I have my lamp.

7231
04:05:02,960 --> 04:05:04,220
I have my lamp.

7232
04:05:04,240 --> 04:05:05,220
I swear he's there.

7233
04:05:06,380 --> 04:05:09,440
Guys, I swear he's right here.

7234
04:05:09,560 --> 04:05:09,700
Trust me.

7235
04:05:09,700 --> 04:05:09,700
Trust the process.

7236
04:05:09,740 --> 04:05:11,100
Where the fuck is...

7237
04:05:11,100 --> 04:05:11,800
Oh, they're here for it.

7238
04:05:11,840 --> 04:05:12,960
Okay, we just need...

7239
04:05:12,960 --> 04:05:13,720
I'm coming.

7240
04:05:14,660 --> 04:05:16,560
I'm at the water.

7241
04:05:19,740 --> 04:05:20,140
Alright.

7242
04:05:20,440 --> 04:05:21,420
Oh, down on the shore, right?

7243
04:05:21,560 --> 04:05:21,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7244
04:05:22,400 --> 04:05:23,920
I guess we can all get off here.

7245
04:05:24,880 --> 04:05:27,640
Don't worry, I have the lamp so he'll be seen on my end.

7246
04:05:29,540 --> 04:05:30,240
There we go.

7247
04:05:30,300 --> 04:05:30,940
Are we all here?

7248
04:05:31,520 --> 04:05:31,920
Yep.

7249
04:05:32,360 --> 04:05:33,560
I can't dismount.

7250
04:05:35,180 --> 04:05:36,580
Okay, stand next to him.

7251
04:05:37,320 --> 04:05:38,540
Alright, screenshot, screenshot.

7252
04:05:38,800 --> 04:05:39,400
We're all here.

7253
04:05:40,300 --> 04:05:40,740
Screenshot!

7254
04:05:41,580 --> 04:05:42,020
Screenshot!

7255
04:05:42,800 --> 04:05:43,340
Let's go!

7256
04:05:44,700 --> 04:05:45,540
Alright, we're done.

7257
04:05:47,140 --> 04:05:50,620
Someone fly to the island and make the base.

7258
04:05:50,900 --> 04:05:53,280
And I'm gonna try and get more of the big boys.

7259
04:05:53,620 --> 04:05:54,060
Who has...

7260
04:05:54,060 --> 04:05:56,800
The island where we can take the picture.

7261
04:05:57,240 --> 04:05:58,580
The wildlife sanctuary.

7262
04:05:59,580 --> 04:06:00,240
Wait, do I do it?

7263
04:06:00,480 --> 04:06:01,380
I don't know where that is.

7264
04:06:01,480 --> 04:06:02,320
Anyone could do it.

7265
04:06:02,400 --> 04:06:05,020
I have to go kill the bosses.

7266
04:06:05,480 --> 04:06:07,300
I'll go find the wildlife...

7267
04:06:07,300 --> 04:06:08,640
Oh, you guys?

7268
04:06:08,700 --> 04:06:09,400
You guys go... There's a picture.

7269
04:06:09,740 --> 04:06:10,200
There's a screenshot.

7270
04:06:13,080 --> 04:06:13,880
Sanctuary... location...

7271
04:06:13,880 --> 04:06:15,160
I don't know where it is so I'm gonna...

7272
04:06:16,040 --> 04:06:17,060
I'm gonna look it up.

7273
04:06:17,140 --> 04:06:19,600
In the docks it shows where it is.

7274
04:06:19,700 --> 04:06:20,460
In the docks?

7275
04:06:20,460 --> 04:06:20,940
There's an image.

7276
04:06:21,140 --> 04:06:21,460
There is?

7277
04:06:21,840 --> 04:06:23,740
Yeah, but... on the map though?

7278
04:06:24,300 --> 04:06:24,520
Yeah.

7279
04:06:24,700 --> 04:06:27,540
Wait, wildlife sanctuary, isn't that that thing that's off the shore?

7280
04:06:27,780 --> 04:06:28,060
I found it.

7281
04:06:28,060 --> 04:06:28,460
I know where it is.

7282
04:06:28,700 --> 04:06:33,820
It's like that big... that like big circular thing with the little outstretched docks, right?

7283
04:06:34,000 --> 04:06:34,240
Yeah.

7284
04:06:34,300 --> 04:06:35,480
Yeah, extreme southeast.

7285
04:06:35,520 --> 04:06:37,620
Oh, it's... I can literally head there right now.

7286
04:06:37,620 --> 04:06:37,980
Okay.

7287
04:06:38,120 --> 04:06:39,840
Yeah, it's like very, very southeast.

7288
04:06:40,560 --> 04:06:42,300
Do I have enough materials for this?

7289
04:06:42,640 --> 04:06:43,640
Uh... rock...

7290
04:06:43,640 --> 04:06:45,040
How many materials for a pall box?

7291
04:06:45,900 --> 04:06:46,940
Uh, not much.

7292
04:06:47,080 --> 04:06:49,340
You need a...

7293
04:06:49,340 --> 04:06:51,600
palladium fragment, 8 wood, 3 stone.

7294
04:06:52,020 --> 04:06:53,260
8 wood, 3 stone.

7295
04:06:53,600 --> 04:06:54,220
Oh, I got it.

7296
04:06:54,300 --> 04:06:54,540
There.

7297
04:06:54,640 --> 04:06:55,020
We're fine.

7298
04:06:55,180 --> 04:06:55,800
I'm heading over now.

7299
04:06:57,600 --> 04:06:59,700
Oh, we got the steak on... we got the steak?

7300
04:07:01,300 --> 04:07:01,860
We did?

7301
04:07:02,360 --> 04:07:03,920
Did you kill the mammoth swine?

7302
04:07:04,180 --> 04:07:05,000
Did we cook it?

7303
04:07:05,460 --> 04:07:06,000
Did we?

7304
04:07:06,180 --> 04:07:07,600
Someone said we already have it.

7305
04:07:07,620 --> 04:07:08,100
We have it in the chest.

7306
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:09,880
Oh, shit.

7307
04:07:10,000 --> 04:07:10,300
What?

7308
04:07:10,640 --> 04:07:11,680
Someone go look, I guess.

7309
04:07:12,420 --> 04:07:13,220
I'm flying back.

7310
04:07:13,400 --> 04:07:13,700
I'm flying back.

7311
04:07:14,820 --> 04:07:16,420
I'll cook it if we got it.

7312
04:07:16,540 --> 04:07:16,760
Oh, no.

7313
04:07:16,860 --> 04:07:18,400
We still need it.

7314
04:07:18,420 --> 04:07:18,720
Never mind.

7315
04:07:19,580 --> 04:07:20,060
Never mind.

7316
04:07:20,160 --> 04:07:20,760
We got one guy.

7317
04:07:20,940 --> 04:07:22,760
Yeah, find me a mammoth and I'll go kill it.

7318
04:07:23,200 --> 04:07:24,400
I went the wrong way.

7319
04:07:24,420 --> 04:07:25,400
I keep flying the wrong way.

7320
04:07:25,460 --> 04:07:25,980
God damn it.

7321
04:07:27,600 --> 04:07:28,560
Mammoth spotting duty.

7322
04:07:28,740 --> 04:07:30,540
What the fuck do those suckers spawn?

7323
04:07:31,620 --> 04:07:33,500
The mammoths spawn at start.

7324
04:07:34,140 --> 04:07:34,500
Easy.

7325
04:07:34,500 --> 04:07:36,180
But then there's like another area.

7326
04:07:37,800 --> 04:07:38,980
I'm opening up the...

7327
04:07:38,980 --> 04:07:40,560
Wait, no, I shouldn't open up the huge dragon egg.

7328
04:07:40,660 --> 04:07:41,700
Or the huge scorching egg.

7329
04:07:41,780 --> 04:07:42,820
You should get the exp for that.

7330
04:07:43,500 --> 04:07:43,980
Coming.

7331
04:07:44,220 --> 04:07:45,040
I'm leaving it.

7332
04:07:46,440 --> 04:07:47,520
I'm heading over.

7333
04:07:47,520 --> 04:07:51,920
We're actually not far from another spawn point of those mammoths.

7334
04:07:53,400 --> 04:07:53,880
We're actually not far from another spawn point of those mammoths.

7335
04:07:53,880 --> 04:07:54,300
Ignis, right?

7336
04:07:54,780 --> 04:07:55,260
Yup.

7337
04:07:55,440 --> 04:07:57,880
Am I heading to the right wildlife sanctuary?

7338
04:07:58,300 --> 04:07:59,100
I just wanna know.

7339
04:07:59,860 --> 04:08:00,980
What was the scorcher?

7340
04:08:00,980 --> 04:08:02,840
Blaze howling gnaw.

7341
04:08:02,840 --> 04:08:03,360
Okay, okay.

7342
04:08:05,160 --> 04:08:07,420
Am I heading towards the correct one, guys?

7343
04:08:08,220 --> 04:08:08,660
Yeah.

7344
04:08:08,680 --> 04:08:11,720
So now we can use that to cook, but you'll probably just get stuck on everything.

7345
04:08:12,140 --> 04:08:12,580
That's the good one.

7346
04:08:12,580 --> 04:08:12,580
The island.

7347
04:08:12,580 --> 04:08:13,060
Yeah, probably.

7348
04:08:14,800 --> 04:08:15,240
Alright.

7349
04:08:15,500 --> 04:08:15,920
You're not wrong.

7350
04:08:19,500 --> 04:08:19,940
Uh...

7351
04:08:21,140 --> 04:08:23,600
I have no idea where the guy is, but I'm almost there.

7352
04:08:24,260 --> 04:08:24,700
Uh...

7353
04:08:24,700 --> 04:08:25,680
How much time we got left?

7354
04:08:26,220 --> 04:08:28,740
We have... 20 minutes.

7355
04:08:29,600 --> 04:08:30,040
Okay.

7356
04:08:31,620 --> 04:08:33,980
Did you get the chicken to level 30 yet, Surefour?

7357
04:08:34,620 --> 04:08:36,100
I'm fucking working on it.

7358
04:08:36,720 --> 04:08:37,160
I'm fucking working on it.

7359
04:08:39,000 --> 04:08:39,440
Faster!

7360
04:08:42,920 --> 04:08:43,860
Do it faster!

7361
04:08:46,680 --> 04:08:47,120
Okay.

7362
04:08:50,340 --> 04:08:51,120
We just have to...

7363
04:08:51,120 --> 04:08:53,580
What else can be done in a really short period of time?

7364
04:08:54,480 --> 04:08:54,920
Bosses?

7365
04:08:54,920 --> 04:08:55,720
All the bosses.

7366
04:08:56,460 --> 04:08:58,480
I'm looking for the Mammal Wreck.

7367
04:08:58,520 --> 04:09:00,080
I'm gonna fight the King P.A.K.A.

7368
04:09:00,240 --> 04:09:01,480
I'll fight King P.A.K.A.

7369
04:09:02,440 --> 04:09:02,940
I did.

7370
04:09:03,040 --> 04:09:03,260
I did.

7371
04:09:03,340 --> 04:09:04,180
I caught King P.A.K.A.

7372
04:09:04,240 --> 04:09:04,420
Okay.

7373
04:09:04,440 --> 04:09:04,820
Just kidding.

7374
04:09:05,740 --> 04:09:06,220
Okay.

7375
04:09:08,200 --> 04:09:09,060
I'm at...

7376
04:09:10,020 --> 04:09:12,400
There's a lot of strong pals here.

7377
04:09:14,360 --> 04:09:14,840
Okay.

7378
04:09:15,600 --> 04:09:16,080
Where?

7379
04:09:16,580 --> 04:09:16,820
Where?

7380
04:09:16,960 --> 04:09:17,040
Where?

7381
04:09:17,340 --> 04:09:19,120
Criminal activity underway.

7382
04:09:19,980 --> 04:09:21,280
What does that mean?

7383
04:09:21,920 --> 04:09:23,200
What about the tower boss?

7384
04:09:24,060 --> 04:09:25,460
Did anybody fight her yet?

7385
04:09:25,840 --> 04:09:27,960
Is that one of the dailies?

7386
04:09:28,360 --> 04:09:29,000
Is it?

7387
04:09:29,180 --> 04:09:29,720
I don't know.

7388
04:09:30,060 --> 04:09:30,760
It's a global.

7389
04:09:32,440 --> 04:09:32,440
Okay.

7390
04:09:32,440 --> 04:09:33,420
I'm making the pal box.

7391
04:09:34,100 --> 04:09:34,800
Is it here?

7392
04:09:36,980 --> 04:09:37,560
I'm here.

7393
04:09:40,100 --> 04:09:40,820
Am I...

7394
04:09:42,020 --> 04:09:43,080
Oh, I'm not supposed...

7395
04:09:43,080 --> 04:09:45,340
Is this the Wildlife Sanctuary?

7396
04:09:46,120 --> 04:09:47,320
I'm pretty sure you're there.

7397
04:09:47,460 --> 04:09:48,840
Is it like a weird...

7398
04:09:48,840 --> 04:09:49,820
Do we have to talk to a person?

7399
04:09:49,840 --> 04:09:50,160
No.

7400
04:09:52,200 --> 04:09:54,220
We just have to take a picture on the island.

7401
04:09:54,420 --> 04:09:54,700
Oh, okay.

7402
04:09:54,820 --> 04:09:55,000
I'm good.

7403
04:09:55,040 --> 04:09:55,160
Yeah.

7404
04:09:55,160 --> 04:09:55,580
Come over here.

7405
04:09:55,660 --> 04:09:56,380
We can take a picture now.

7406
04:09:57,220 --> 04:09:57,580
Alright.

7407
04:09:58,760 --> 04:09:59,280
I'm fast traveling.

7408
04:10:01,060 --> 04:10:01,880
I did it.

7409
04:10:02,600 --> 04:10:04,620
I have to find the fast travel nearby.

7410
04:10:05,500 --> 04:10:06,540
Just get the pal box.

7411
04:10:06,780 --> 04:10:07,360
No, it's a base.

7412
04:10:07,500 --> 04:10:08,040
Just go to base.

7413
04:10:08,220 --> 04:10:08,380
Yeah.

7414
04:10:08,400 --> 04:10:08,960
It's the base.

7415
04:10:09,160 --> 04:10:09,980
We set up a base there.

7416
04:10:10,980 --> 04:10:12,720
I'm not near any travel point.

7417
04:10:12,720 --> 04:10:14,840
Oh, you're not near any fast travel.

7418
04:10:15,760 --> 04:10:17,260
I'm gonna see what else we can do.

7419
04:10:18,960 --> 04:10:19,360
Uh...

7420
04:10:20,540 --> 04:10:21,820
Criminal activity underway.

7421
04:10:22,320 --> 04:10:24,860
We need to capture ten toko tokos.

7422
04:10:26,320 --> 04:10:27,060
I have two.

7423
04:10:27,300 --> 04:10:29,260
Toko tokos are on the far right side of the map.

7424
04:10:29,280 --> 04:10:29,820
Usually.

7425
04:10:29,980 --> 04:10:33,080
I mean, if you go to your pal deck, it shows you where they spawn.

7426
04:10:33,220 --> 04:10:33,460
Yeah.

7427
04:10:33,460 --> 04:10:35,660
I only have... I have two on me, I think.

7428
04:10:35,820 --> 04:10:36,180
Or one?

7429
04:10:36,220 --> 04:10:37,000
I have one on me.

7430
04:10:37,040 --> 04:10:37,380
Only.

7431
04:10:39,340 --> 04:10:42,280
I guess I'm gonna try doing the rest of the bosses after this.

7432
04:10:42,560 --> 04:10:43,700
The chicken's level 30.

7433
04:10:44,040 --> 04:10:44,140
Oh, fuck.

7434
04:10:44,420 --> 04:10:44,860
Screenshot!

7435
04:10:44,940 --> 04:10:45,360
Screenshot!

7436
04:10:45,480 --> 04:10:46,220
Clip, clip, clip!

7437
04:10:47,360 --> 04:10:48,120
Clip, clip, clip!

7438
04:10:54,840 --> 04:10:55,520
I'm waiting.

7439
04:10:58,040 --> 04:10:58,480
Indeed.

7440
04:11:02,060 --> 04:11:02,500
Where's...

7441
04:11:03,200 --> 04:11:04,340
Lily's coming over.

7442
04:11:05,660 --> 04:11:07,420
Almost at the freaking fast travel.

7443
04:11:09,080 --> 04:11:12,020
He just need Lily and then we're good.

7444
04:11:13,720 --> 04:11:14,700
I'm on my way.

7445
04:11:15,040 --> 04:11:16,380
Now I'll go back to Mammoth.

7446
04:11:17,260 --> 04:11:19,120
Back to Mammoth's line, I think.

7447
04:11:20,100 --> 04:11:22,560
Dude, how is something so big so hard to find?

7448
04:11:22,740 --> 04:11:24,120
They're supposed to be everywhere here.

7449
04:11:24,260 --> 04:11:24,700
What the fuck?

7450
04:11:25,580 --> 04:11:26,300
Are we good?

7451
04:11:27,820 --> 04:11:28,560
I'm coming.

7452
04:11:29,040 --> 04:11:29,620
Oh, here.

7453
04:11:29,620 --> 04:11:29,780
Okay.

7454
04:11:29,900 --> 04:11:31,060
Now we're at the island.

7455
04:11:31,600 --> 04:11:32,040
Alright.

7456
04:11:32,480 --> 04:11:33,160
Screenshot, screenshot.

7457
04:11:33,420 --> 04:11:34,240
We're at the island.

7458
04:11:34,680 --> 04:11:34,720
Screenshot!

7459
04:11:35,660 --> 04:11:36,720
What the fuck?

7460
04:11:39,180 --> 04:11:39,900
Screenshot, screenshot!

7461
04:11:40,140 --> 04:11:41,020
That's the kids.

7462
04:11:41,200 --> 04:11:42,360
They're raiding us here.

7463
04:11:42,940 --> 04:11:45,420
We are the herd of wild animals.

7464
04:11:45,760 --> 04:11:46,280
Alright.

7465
04:11:46,280 --> 04:11:47,320
I'll see you guys later.

7466
04:11:47,520 --> 04:11:48,040
I'm gonna go.

7467
04:11:48,860 --> 04:11:49,660
I leave.

7468
04:11:52,340 --> 04:11:53,900
We got our...

7469
04:11:53,900 --> 04:11:55,060
Easy exp.

7470
04:11:55,240 --> 04:11:55,780
Easy, easy.

7471
04:11:56,140 --> 04:11:57,020
Alright, we got it.

7472
04:11:57,200 --> 04:11:59,160
I hope somebody screenshot it.

7473
04:11:59,400 --> 04:12:00,180
I left.

7474
04:12:02,720 --> 04:12:04,800
I'm gonna do the other bosses now.

7475
04:12:04,960 --> 04:12:05,120
I'm gonna do the other bosses now.

7476
04:12:06,960 --> 04:12:08,000
Let's see...

7477
04:12:08,000 --> 04:12:10,220
Got 17 minutes left.

7478
04:12:10,400 --> 04:12:11,100
You got Bushi, right?

7479
04:12:11,260 --> 04:12:12,040
You already got Bushi?

7480
04:12:12,100 --> 04:12:12,580
Yeah, I got Bushi.

7481
04:12:12,580 --> 04:12:12,980
Bushi's done.

7482
04:12:13,020 --> 04:12:13,420
Bushi's done.

7483
04:12:15,760 --> 04:12:16,280
Dammit.

7484
04:12:17,580 --> 04:12:18,100
Okay.

7485
04:12:19,080 --> 04:12:20,440
I'll get the Duma then.

7486
04:12:21,760 --> 04:12:22,780
Oh, they're all dead.

7487
04:12:23,600 --> 04:12:24,120
Nice.

7488
04:12:24,860 --> 04:12:25,380
Okay.

7489
04:12:29,000 --> 04:12:31,420
We need to find the fucking map.

7490
04:12:31,440 --> 04:12:31,860
Oh my goodness!

7491
04:12:31,860 --> 04:12:33,120
It's a dead side.

7492
04:12:33,480 --> 04:12:35,300
The cast rate is so high.

7493
04:12:35,780 --> 04:12:37,840
Alright, we need one person.

7494
04:12:38,320 --> 04:12:39,180
Oh my god.

7495
04:12:39,440 --> 04:12:42,800
We need one person to focus on finding a Mammoth Swine for sure.

7496
04:12:43,280 --> 04:12:45,020
I'm doing that.

7497
04:12:46,780 --> 04:12:47,700
Right now.

7498
04:12:50,040 --> 04:12:51,260
Oh my goodness!

7499
04:12:51,460 --> 04:12:52,300
Stay in!

7500
04:12:54,420 --> 04:12:55,520
Holy shit!

7501
04:12:55,600 --> 04:12:57,040
Let me go get the Mammoth.

7502
04:12:57,340 --> 04:12:57,620
Okay.

7503
04:12:58,680 --> 04:13:01,000
Are we able to fight the level 38?

7504
04:13:02,360 --> 04:13:03,000
Mammoth Swine?

7505
04:13:03,000 --> 04:13:04,620
I feel like... maybe?

7506
04:13:05,440 --> 04:13:06,920
If we do it together, maybe?

7507
04:13:07,920 --> 04:13:09,020
All four of us?

7508
04:13:11,180 --> 04:13:12,500
It's probably on the list.

7509
04:13:12,680 --> 04:13:12,900
Hold on.

7510
04:13:13,120 --> 04:13:14,680
It doesn't look like it's on the list.

7511
04:13:16,020 --> 04:13:16,960
Yeah, it's not.

7512
04:13:18,460 --> 04:13:18,860
Uh...

7513
04:13:18,860 --> 04:13:21,740
The meat is quite some points.

7514
04:13:22,740 --> 04:13:24,000
Yeah, we still need to stay.

7515
04:13:24,040 --> 04:13:25,840
I found a Mammoth Swine.

7516
04:13:26,180 --> 04:13:26,960
Oh, you did?

7517
04:13:27,460 --> 04:13:28,680
Maybe I can kill it.

7518
04:13:28,740 --> 04:13:29,220
We'll find out.

7519
04:13:29,360 --> 04:13:30,040
Where is it at?

7520
04:13:32,260 --> 04:13:32,680
Okay.

7521
04:13:34,420 --> 04:13:35,560
On you, on you.

7522
04:13:36,700 --> 04:13:38,260
I don't have anything.

7523
04:13:38,520 --> 04:13:39,740
Oh, I've got nothing over there.

7524
04:13:39,820 --> 04:13:40,040
Yeah.

7525
04:13:40,840 --> 04:13:42,900
I'm trying to set up a new Pal box.

7526
04:13:43,440 --> 04:13:44,780
I need to get that easy.

7527
04:13:45,120 --> 04:13:46,200
Stupid do-mud.

7528
04:13:46,960 --> 04:13:48,600
I dismantled the base, so...

7529
04:13:48,600 --> 04:13:51,080
Okay, let me fucking look for this.

7530
04:13:51,320 --> 04:13:52,260
Make a new Pal box.

7531
04:13:53,140 --> 04:13:54,500
If only I had hyperspheres.

7532
04:13:55,300 --> 04:13:55,940
Oh no.

7533
04:13:57,020 --> 04:13:58,140
Well, you don't need hyperspheres.

7534
04:13:58,220 --> 04:13:58,880
You need to be dead.

7535
04:13:59,000 --> 04:13:59,680
We just need steak.

7536
04:14:01,860 --> 04:14:02,240
I don't need hyperspheres anyways.

7537
04:14:02,800 --> 04:14:03,460
Fair enough.

7538
04:14:05,460 --> 04:14:06,340
I hear you.

7539
04:14:06,960 --> 04:14:07,940
I'm heading over.

7540
04:14:08,000 --> 04:14:08,340
I got it.

7541
04:14:09,900 --> 04:14:10,340
What?

7542
04:14:12,240 --> 04:14:13,280
You got it?

7543
04:14:13,780 --> 04:14:14,820
I got it.

7544
04:14:14,860 --> 04:14:17,040
You got the steak?

7545
04:14:17,660 --> 04:14:19,640
Cook it, cook it, cook it!

7546
04:14:20,740 --> 04:14:22,780
Alright, alright, alright.

7547
04:14:22,860 --> 04:14:24,180
I need to find a fast travel.

7548
04:14:25,520 --> 04:14:26,860
Or someone could come to me.

7549
04:14:27,740 --> 04:14:28,180
Ugh.

7550
04:14:29,100 --> 04:14:30,200
That's what I thought.

7551
04:14:31,180 --> 04:14:32,480
That's what I thought!

7552
04:14:35,580 --> 04:14:36,160
Impossible.

7553
04:14:36,700 --> 04:14:37,180
Impossible.

7554
04:14:40,940 --> 04:14:41,520
Okay.

7555
04:14:48,020 --> 04:14:49,320
Alright, I'm gonna...

7556
04:14:49,320 --> 04:14:50,460
I'm gonna do a little bit of...

7557
04:14:50,460 --> 04:14:51,480
Go, Fleshboy, go!

7558
04:14:52,000 --> 04:14:54,080
Did someone make a cooking pot or anything?

7559
04:14:54,440 --> 04:14:54,840
Yeah, I did.

7560
04:14:54,900 --> 04:14:56,300
It's next to the incubator.

7561
04:14:59,060 --> 04:14:59,640
Um...

7562
04:14:59,640 --> 04:15:01,780
Alright, I'm gonna...

7563
04:15:01,780 --> 04:15:02,720
What level?

7564
04:15:02,720 --> 04:15:03,440
What's this one?

7565
04:15:03,440 --> 04:15:05,480
Did anyone do the...

7566
04:15:06,560 --> 04:15:07,140
What's this?

7567
04:15:08,420 --> 04:15:09,260
Enter sealed...

7568
04:15:09,260 --> 04:15:10,080
Which one is this?

7569
04:15:11,600 --> 04:15:12,820
I think there's no fault in this.

7570
04:15:12,820 --> 04:15:13,840
No one did the felt bat, right?

7571
04:15:15,200 --> 04:15:15,620
Nope.

7572
04:15:15,620 --> 04:15:16,940
Okay, I'm doing the felt bat now.

7573
04:15:18,460 --> 04:15:19,800
Oh, that's my fucking fist.

7574
04:15:21,300 --> 04:15:22,520
Insufficient materials, why?

7575
04:15:22,660 --> 04:15:23,200
What are we missing?

7576
04:15:25,120 --> 04:15:25,540
Uh...

7577
04:15:25,540 --> 04:15:25,980
Uh?

7578
04:15:33,890 --> 04:15:34,810
Oh wait, cancel.

7579
04:15:36,310 --> 04:15:36,730
Pfft.

7580
04:15:39,130 --> 04:15:39,530
Okay.

7581
04:15:42,810 --> 04:15:43,910
Pal team is hungry.

7582
04:15:44,010 --> 04:15:45,110
You can't be hungry right now!

7583
04:15:45,710 --> 04:15:46,390
Oh, they're hungry!

7584
04:15:46,670 --> 04:15:47,390
I'm going to them.

7585
04:15:47,470 --> 04:15:47,930
I'll feed them.

7586
04:15:48,550 --> 04:15:49,410
No, my pal.

7587
04:15:49,510 --> 04:15:51,090
No, no, my fucking pal is hungry.

7588
04:15:51,430 --> 04:15:51,450
Oh, your pal?

7589
04:15:51,570 --> 04:15:53,350
Yeah, the one that's trying to...

7590
04:15:53,350 --> 04:15:54,150
Nope.

7591
04:15:56,430 --> 04:15:56,830
Uh...

7592
04:15:59,330 --> 04:16:00,010
Mammoth steak.

7593
04:16:00,930 --> 04:16:01,330
Yes.

7594
04:16:01,330 --> 04:16:01,850
Clip, clip, clip!

7595
04:16:02,670 --> 04:16:04,010
Well, it's not cooked.

7596
04:16:04,170 --> 04:16:04,570
Oh, okay.

7597
04:16:04,750 --> 04:16:06,310
Someone has to make it get kindled.

7598
04:16:06,830 --> 04:16:08,090
I'll go ahead and get it done.

7599
04:16:08,090 --> 04:16:08,730
I can make it get kindled.

7600
04:16:08,750 --> 04:16:09,190
I'm at base.

7601
04:16:09,490 --> 04:16:09,930
Okay.

7602
04:16:12,550 --> 04:16:12,990
No!

7603
04:16:13,450 --> 04:16:14,350
Keep it alone!

7604
04:16:14,710 --> 04:16:15,750
Okay, what else is something?

7605
04:16:15,910 --> 04:16:16,730
We have 12 minutes.

7606
04:16:16,930 --> 04:16:18,910
What else is something we can focus on?

7607
04:16:19,490 --> 04:16:19,930
Um...

7608
04:16:19,930 --> 04:16:21,470
Just like doing the bosses.

7609
04:16:22,530 --> 04:16:24,610
I don't think I'm high level enough to do bosses.

7610
04:16:24,750 --> 04:16:25,990
I've been doing so much farming.

7611
04:16:26,070 --> 04:16:26,650
I'm only 19.

7612
04:16:27,850 --> 04:16:28,670
I think like...

7613
04:16:28,670 --> 04:16:30,910
We could focus on like our base for tomorrow.

7614
04:16:31,470 --> 04:16:33,310
Like leveling up the bases for tomorrow.

7615
04:16:33,790 --> 04:16:34,230
Yeah.

7616
04:16:35,270 --> 04:16:36,030
There's a fucking raid?

7617
04:16:36,030 --> 04:16:36,470
Oh, we're being raided?

7618
04:16:38,210 --> 04:16:39,110
Shadow Legends.

7619
04:16:43,530 --> 04:16:45,370
But I think our pals can probably handle it.

7620
04:16:45,570 --> 04:16:46,650
I believe in him.

7621
04:16:46,930 --> 04:16:49,850
We're in like a pretty low level area, so...

7622
04:16:53,470 --> 04:16:53,990
We're in like a pretty low level area, so...

7623
04:16:53,990 --> 04:16:54,770
Please don't kill me.

7624
04:16:54,950 --> 04:16:55,230
Please don't kill me.

7625
04:16:55,770 --> 04:16:56,890
I'm so scared.

7626
04:17:02,130 --> 04:17:04,610
Let me snack some quick XP.

7627
04:17:06,910 --> 04:17:07,430
Oh!

7628
04:17:14,280 --> 04:17:15,260
Mammoth steak!

7629
04:17:15,680 --> 04:17:16,900
Oh wait, let me grab a kindling guy.

7630
04:17:16,960 --> 04:17:17,460
Kindling guy.

7631
04:17:17,480 --> 04:17:17,860
Come here.

7632
04:17:17,940 --> 04:17:18,380
Come here.

7633
04:17:18,500 --> 04:17:18,580
Come here.

7634
04:17:18,980 --> 04:17:21,140
Stop fighting.

7635
04:17:21,260 --> 04:17:22,080
I don't care about these guys.

7636
04:17:22,140 --> 04:17:22,760
Holy shit.

7637
04:17:23,320 --> 04:17:24,700
I suddenly care about these guys.

7638
04:17:25,020 --> 04:17:25,840
I do care.

7639
04:17:25,940 --> 04:17:26,900
I care very much.

7640
04:17:26,900 --> 04:17:27,760
Holy shit.

7641
04:17:29,220 --> 04:17:29,660
Jesus.

7642
04:17:29,660 --> 04:17:30,620
Alright, well...

7643
04:17:30,620 --> 04:17:31,160
Cool.

7644
04:17:31,260 --> 04:17:31,640
Thanks.

7645
04:17:32,660 --> 04:17:33,860
Please catch him.

7646
04:17:37,680 --> 04:17:38,120
Alright.

7647
04:17:39,460 --> 04:17:41,300
Alright, Van Worm, you're gonna do kindling.

7648
04:17:42,360 --> 04:17:43,920
And get the steak done on time.

7649
04:17:44,020 --> 04:17:44,460
No!

7650
04:17:44,460 --> 04:17:44,460
Please!

7651
04:17:48,040 --> 04:17:49,100
Armor is damaged.

7652
04:17:49,440 --> 04:17:50,240
Pal is hungry.

7653
04:17:50,460 --> 04:17:52,060
There's so many things wrong!

7654
04:17:52,620 --> 04:17:55,080
There's so many things wrong!

7655
04:17:55,100 --> 04:17:57,680
There you go.

7656
04:18:03,250 --> 04:18:03,770
No!

7657
04:18:04,390 --> 04:18:04,770
No!

7658
04:18:05,490 --> 04:18:05,830
Please!

7659
04:18:15,050 --> 04:18:16,030
He's leaving alone!

7660
04:18:19,230 --> 04:18:19,990
Oh shit.

7661
04:18:20,070 --> 04:18:20,350
Toko.

7662
04:18:20,550 --> 04:18:20,970
Toko.

7663
04:18:20,990 --> 04:18:21,130
Toko.

7664
04:18:21,170 --> 04:18:21,290
Toko.

7665
04:18:21,650 --> 04:18:24,690
I can get started on the toko toko toko.

7666
04:18:24,830 --> 04:18:24,930
I can get started on the toko toko toko.

7667
04:18:24,930 --> 04:18:25,630
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

7668
04:18:25,910 --> 04:18:26,710
Get toko.

7669
04:18:26,710 --> 04:18:28,250
Where are they on the map?

7670
04:18:28,350 --> 04:18:29,070
There's two different locations.

7671
04:18:29,290 --> 04:18:32,610
There's one area that spawns them that's in this lower level area.

7672
04:18:32,790 --> 04:18:33,710
But it's unreliable.

7673
04:18:33,850 --> 04:18:36,670
And then if you go to the desert, then you can get a lot of them.

7674
04:18:36,730 --> 04:18:38,710
But it's level 25, so I don't know.

7675
04:18:38,730 --> 04:18:39,110
Oh shit.

7676
04:18:39,170 --> 04:18:39,990
Yeah, I can't do desert.

7677
04:18:39,990 --> 04:18:41,690
There is a lower level area around here though.

7678
04:18:41,910 --> 04:18:46,750
Guys, if anybody can get to me, there is a fell bed!

7679
04:18:47,350 --> 04:18:49,270
I'm right out of PAL balls!

7680
04:18:49,830 --> 04:18:51,250
Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.

7681
04:18:51,690 --> 04:18:53,570
I will bring you... Oh shit.

7682
04:18:53,590 --> 04:18:54,450
I can't bring you.

7683
04:18:54,530 --> 04:18:55,470
I can't bring you.

7684
04:18:55,490 --> 04:18:56,290
There's no balls here.

7685
04:18:57,230 --> 04:18:57,750
No!

7686
04:18:58,150 --> 04:18:59,930
All I have are the regular balls!

7687
04:19:00,130 --> 04:19:00,530
I'm dead!

7688
04:19:01,870 --> 04:19:02,390
No!

7689
04:19:03,070 --> 04:19:04,050
I died!

7690
04:19:04,590 --> 04:19:05,810
Oh, you're so sad.

7691
04:19:06,510 --> 04:19:07,130
That's okay.

7692
04:19:07,230 --> 04:19:08,750
We can remedy that.

7693
04:19:08,970 --> 04:19:12,670
I thought I had enough PAL balls to do this.

7694
04:19:15,950 --> 04:19:17,530
Do we need more PAL balls?

7695
04:19:17,670 --> 04:19:18,990
Do we have to craft some?

7696
04:19:19,210 --> 04:19:20,650
Wait, do we get the steak shit yet?

7697
04:19:21,250 --> 04:19:22,230
Steak is being cooked.

7698
04:19:22,890 --> 04:19:24,130
How many do we have to cook?

7699
04:19:24,170 --> 04:19:24,470
Just one?

7700
04:19:25,490 --> 04:19:26,210
Just one.

7701
04:19:26,210 --> 04:19:27,090
That's 100 points.

7702
04:19:27,570 --> 04:19:29,410
It's taking a while to cook, but it's halfway done.

7703
04:19:30,530 --> 04:19:30,890
Okay.

7704
04:19:30,890 --> 04:19:31,910
I need PAL balls.

7705
04:19:32,030 --> 04:19:34,370
I've got my actual PAL on it, so it's more reliable.

7706
04:19:34,370 --> 04:19:36,370
Can I grab... Yeah, I need those PAL balls.

7707
04:19:36,430 --> 04:19:36,750
Yeah, grab them.

7708
04:19:37,850 --> 04:19:38,390
It's done.

7709
04:19:38,590 --> 04:19:38,950
It's done.

7710
04:19:39,610 --> 04:19:40,250
Clip, clip, clip!

7711
04:19:41,830 --> 04:19:42,710
Clip, clip, clip.

7712
04:19:42,870 --> 04:19:43,970
We have one done one.

7713
04:19:45,750 --> 04:19:46,950
Clip, clip, clip...

7714
04:19:47,750 --> 04:19:49,930
Clip, clip, clip...

7715
04:19:49,930 --> 04:19:53,370
I think you have to clip Shy's, because by the time I walked over, there was nothing on there.

7716
04:19:54,030 --> 04:19:57,930
Put it in the thing so I can just clip you opening the chest.

7717
04:19:58,390 --> 04:19:59,390
Okay, true, true, true.

7718
04:20:00,250 --> 04:20:01,030
What do we...

7719
04:20:01,030 --> 04:20:04,110
What do we need left other than the bosses?

7720
04:20:05,530 --> 04:20:06,830
We have three minutes left.

7721
04:20:07,010 --> 04:20:07,450
Oh my gosh.

7722
04:20:07,450 --> 04:20:09,090
I'm gonna try and catch this in three minutes.

7723
04:20:09,770 --> 04:20:11,610
I'm gonna try and catch this in three minutes.

7724
04:20:11,730 --> 04:20:13,410
Yeah, yeah, because we have to report...

7725
04:20:13,410 --> 04:20:14,750
We have eight minutes yet.

7726
04:20:15,130 --> 04:20:18,330
Why was the five minute report stuff?

7727
04:20:18,790 --> 04:20:19,750
Here, chat.

7728
04:20:19,930 --> 04:20:20,210
We can clip this.

7729
04:20:20,410 --> 04:20:21,090
MemRestate, right there.

7730
04:20:21,630 --> 04:20:22,250
There you go.

7731
04:20:22,910 --> 04:20:24,630
Oh, okay, okay, we have eight minutes.

7732
04:20:25,710 --> 04:20:26,030
Okay.

7733
04:20:26,030 --> 04:20:27,650
What other stuff are we missing?

7734
04:20:29,090 --> 04:20:30,890
Trefo, have you done anything that hasn't been clipped yet?

7735
04:20:32,170 --> 04:20:34,810
I mean, I've clipped a bunch of stuff, but I haven't submitted anything.

7736
04:20:34,970 --> 04:20:35,270
I don't know.

7737
04:20:35,430 --> 04:20:35,930
Oh, yeah.

7738
04:20:36,850 --> 04:20:38,010
What have you not submitted?

7739
04:20:39,030 --> 04:20:39,610
I don't know.

7740
04:20:39,710 --> 04:20:41,510
I just asked them to clip, and then I move on.

7741
04:20:44,010 --> 04:20:44,890
What is it?

7742
04:20:44,910 --> 04:20:45,650
What did you do?

7743
04:20:46,590 --> 04:20:47,530
Fuck it, they're in the clips.

7744
04:20:47,630 --> 04:20:48,610
I don't know what to tell you, man.

7745
04:20:51,910 --> 04:20:53,090
But what does it mean?

7746
04:20:53,430 --> 04:20:54,830
Oh my god, the kill him again?

7747
04:20:56,050 --> 04:20:56,370
Okay.

7748
04:20:57,410 --> 04:20:58,510
Thought I didn't have to.

7749
04:20:58,610 --> 04:20:59,970
Okay, I'm gonna see if I can do this again.

7750
04:21:00,570 --> 04:21:02,470
I'm gonna make more powballs, just in case.

7751
04:21:04,270 --> 04:21:04,850
Just kidding.

7752
04:21:04,930 --> 04:21:05,290
No, I'm not.

7753
04:21:05,390 --> 04:21:06,070
We don't need fucking it.

7754
04:21:10,430 --> 04:21:12,090
I think I can do this in seven.

7755
04:21:12,810 --> 04:21:14,050
I think I can do this in seven.

7756
04:21:14,070 --> 04:21:14,690
There's no way.

7757
04:21:15,250 --> 04:21:17,810
I'm trying to do as much as I can in the small amount of time I have.

7758
04:21:18,610 --> 04:21:20,310
What is your mission right now?

7759
04:21:21,010 --> 04:21:22,250
Fucking killing the bosses.

7760
04:21:22,330 --> 04:21:22,950
What do you think, man?

7761
04:21:24,750 --> 04:21:26,190
How many bosses have you done?

7762
04:21:26,890 --> 04:21:28,430
Fucking like six, seven.

7763
04:21:28,990 --> 04:21:29,630
Oh shit.

7764
04:21:29,750 --> 04:21:31,490
Did we even clip seven of Shareforce's bosses?

7765
04:21:32,610 --> 04:21:33,570
They're in the clips.

7766
04:21:35,070 --> 04:21:36,990
Can we see what the clips after still?

7767
04:21:37,330 --> 04:21:37,810
No, no.

7768
04:21:37,830 --> 04:21:39,010
We have to report them while...

7769
04:21:40,330 --> 04:21:41,330
When to report them.

7770
04:21:42,190 --> 04:21:44,750
Mods, if you can check Shareforce clips.

7771
04:21:45,050 --> 04:21:46,750
And see what has been clipped.

7772
04:21:46,750 --> 04:21:49,730
And match it to anything that we've done.

7773
04:21:49,930 --> 04:21:50,530
That'd be great.

7774
04:21:50,590 --> 04:21:52,650
We need to make sure we got everything.

7775
04:21:53,330 --> 04:21:54,470
That'd be great, thanks.

7776
04:21:58,410 --> 04:21:59,370
Oh my god.

7777
04:21:59,710 --> 04:22:01,090
Please leave me alone.

7778
04:22:03,190 --> 04:22:03,670
Alright.

7779
04:22:04,730 --> 04:22:05,550
Where are you at?

7780
04:22:08,230 --> 04:22:09,730
Oh, you're way out there.

7781
04:22:09,790 --> 04:22:10,130
Nevermind.

7782
04:22:10,570 --> 04:22:11,210
Good luck.

7783
04:22:11,330 --> 04:22:11,770
Godspeed.

7784
04:22:13,630 --> 04:22:14,330
No way.

7785
04:22:15,630 --> 04:22:16,650
Yeah, I'm really far.

7786
04:22:19,030 --> 04:22:20,350
I'm gonna get some lift monk statues.

7787
04:22:21,650 --> 04:22:22,770
Just keep making some...

7788
04:22:22,770 --> 04:22:23,170
Do all of us...

7789
04:22:23,170 --> 04:22:27,330
If we all get the lift monk statues, if we all get to level 10, like tomorrow, say.

7790
04:22:28,590 --> 04:22:30,950
Do all of us need to or just one person?

7791
04:22:31,430 --> 04:22:32,290
It's per player.

7792
04:22:33,330 --> 04:22:34,050
Per person.

7793
04:22:34,210 --> 04:22:34,410
Okay.

7794
04:22:35,950 --> 04:22:36,310
Okay.

7795
04:22:37,950 --> 04:22:38,630
Please kill him.

7796
04:22:38,730 --> 04:22:39,430
Please don't kill him.

7797
04:22:42,810 --> 04:22:43,510
Dameron, please.

7798
04:22:47,050 --> 04:22:47,410
Woo!

7799
04:22:51,660 --> 04:22:52,020
Please.

7800
04:22:54,100 --> 04:22:55,100
Oh, clip, clip, clip!

7801
04:22:55,200 --> 04:22:55,760
I got the...

7802
04:22:57,900 --> 04:22:58,380
Let's go!

7803
04:22:58,500 --> 04:22:59,100
I got the bat.

7804
04:22:59,180 --> 04:22:59,760
I got the bat.

7805
04:23:00,560 --> 04:23:00,920
Okay.

7806
04:23:01,600 --> 04:23:03,220
I can do like...

7807
04:23:03,220 --> 04:23:05,260
I can do one more boss, I think.

7808
04:23:05,440 --> 04:23:08,920
I don't think I... I don't need to care about my armor.

7809
04:23:09,560 --> 04:23:11,060
I don't think I need to kill it.

7810
04:23:11,280 --> 04:23:12,060
Don't worry about it.

7811
04:23:12,100 --> 04:23:13,040
Okay, I can get the doom mud.

7812
04:23:13,420 --> 04:23:14,800
The doom mud is like right here.

7813
04:23:23,970 --> 04:23:25,150
We need to start submitting.

7814
04:23:27,370 --> 04:23:27,730
Yeah.

7815
04:23:28,150 --> 04:23:29,810
If we haven't already been submitting...

7816
04:23:29,810 --> 04:23:30,950
Well, I think...

7817
04:23:31,610 --> 04:23:33,970
There's a time frame where you can just submit.

7818
04:23:34,070 --> 04:23:34,290
Okay, okay.

7819
04:23:34,370 --> 04:23:38,990
I think my mods have probably been submitting the whole time.

7820
04:23:41,850 --> 04:23:43,310
Thank you, mods.

7821
04:23:43,990 --> 04:23:44,510
Okay.

7822
04:23:44,750 --> 04:23:45,710
Big appreciate.

7823
04:23:49,140 --> 04:23:49,660
No!

7824
04:23:50,880 --> 04:23:51,880
The fuck hit me?

7825
04:23:53,020 --> 04:23:55,020
Where the fuck is doom mud?

7826
04:23:56,380 --> 04:23:57,220
Oh my god.

7827
04:23:57,220 --> 04:23:58,080
There's too many trees.

7828
04:24:08,240 --> 04:24:10,100
At least have this fast travel.

7829
04:24:14,680 --> 04:24:16,060
Okay, one toko toko.

7830
04:24:19,760 --> 04:24:20,640
Doom mud.

7831
04:24:21,880 --> 04:24:24,400
Oh my goodness, what is that catch rate?

7832
04:24:24,460 --> 04:24:25,460
Just stay in!

7833
04:24:25,480 --> 04:24:26,360
It's 30%!

7834
04:24:27,560 --> 04:24:31,980
You did like 12 balls and won 30% catch rate toko toko.

7835
04:24:34,060 --> 04:24:35,400
What do you mean wrong way?

7836
04:24:35,640 --> 04:24:36,960
I don't know where I am!

7837
04:24:36,960 --> 04:24:38,800
Just toko toko things.

7838
04:24:40,640 --> 04:24:43,400
Okay, I only have six balls left.

7839
04:24:43,560 --> 04:24:44,660
Make them count, I guess.

7840
04:24:45,180 --> 04:24:45,620
East!

7841
04:24:46,740 --> 04:24:47,700
I'm heading east!

7842
04:24:50,920 --> 04:24:51,800
Wrong island!

7843
04:24:52,980 --> 04:24:54,200
I went on the wrong island.

7844
04:24:54,220 --> 04:24:54,880
I'm a fat ass bird.

7845
04:24:55,800 --> 04:24:57,100
Apparently I went on the wrong island.

7846
04:25:00,380 --> 04:25:00,820
No!

7847
04:25:01,440 --> 04:25:03,180
Do you think I can fight this alfederate?

7848
04:25:04,340 --> 04:25:05,340
Do I even have balls?

7849
04:25:06,940 --> 04:25:07,900
No, I should.

7850
04:25:07,900 --> 04:25:09,660
Wait, no, we already fought him, didn't we?

7851
04:25:10,900 --> 04:25:11,500
Which one?

7852
04:25:12,320 --> 04:25:12,720
Alfedrine.

7853
04:25:13,120 --> 04:25:14,640
I don't think so.

7854
04:25:15,240 --> 04:25:15,900
Oh, for real?

7855
04:25:16,300 --> 04:25:17,540
But I probably can't catch it.

7856
04:25:17,640 --> 04:25:18,960
I only have normal ass pal balls.

7857
04:25:19,840 --> 04:25:20,240
Shit.

7858
04:25:22,560 --> 04:25:22,960
Shit.

7859
04:25:23,680 --> 04:25:24,760
That fucking sucks.

7860
04:25:26,720 --> 04:25:27,520
Four minutes?

7861
04:25:27,540 --> 04:25:28,060
No way.

7862
04:25:28,600 --> 04:25:29,960
I can catch the doom mud.

7863
04:25:30,020 --> 04:25:31,140
The doom mud is my last hope.

7864
04:25:31,160 --> 04:25:31,560
I can kill him.

7865
04:25:32,720 --> 04:25:33,520
We'll try.

7866
04:25:35,480 --> 04:25:37,040
What's the worst that could happen?

7867
04:25:37,900 --> 04:25:38,420
I only have four minutes.

7868
04:25:39,260 --> 04:25:41,440
Let's see if I can catch him with my normal ass pal ball.

7869
04:25:45,160 --> 04:25:46,760
What's the worst that could happen?

7870
04:25:46,880 --> 04:25:48,000
Oh, my van worm could die.

7871
04:25:48,040 --> 04:25:48,580
That could happen.

7872
04:25:48,780 --> 04:25:50,380
Why are you hungry?

7873
04:25:51,320 --> 04:25:51,740
Uh...

7874
04:25:53,960 --> 04:25:54,840
Uh oh.

7875
04:25:56,160 --> 04:25:57,940
Uh oh, he's targeting me.

7876
04:25:59,180 --> 04:25:59,620
No!

7877
04:26:00,160 --> 04:26:01,140
Okay, well I'm dead, but that's okay.

7878
04:26:01,140 --> 04:26:03,700
I don't have the balls to catch the freaking tokotoko, man.

7879
04:26:04,280 --> 04:26:05,520
You got this, Lily!

7880
04:26:05,700 --> 04:26:06,600
I believe in you!

7881
04:26:07,020 --> 04:26:08,140
I have the balls!

7882
04:26:09,940 --> 04:26:11,180
We need like eight more!

7883
04:26:11,420 --> 04:26:12,240
The three balls!

7884
04:26:12,340 --> 04:26:12,940
It's gonna count!

7885
04:26:13,120 --> 04:26:14,520
Make those three balls worth it!

7886
04:26:18,130 --> 04:26:18,530
Alright.

7887
04:26:19,670 --> 04:26:21,670
Alright, I'm gonna go back.

7888
04:26:24,880 --> 04:26:27,320
I need to at least get my stuff so I start tomorrow with my stuff.

7889
04:26:32,930 --> 04:26:33,330
Bruh!

7890
04:26:34,250 --> 04:26:35,630
We didn't have any balls!

7891
04:26:35,990 --> 04:26:36,270
Okay.

7892
04:26:36,970 --> 04:26:38,370
We can make some balls now.

7893
04:26:38,490 --> 04:26:39,330
It's not gonna matter though.

7894
04:26:39,510 --> 04:26:41,910
I got the worst sect.

7895
04:26:42,050 --> 04:26:43,350
I don't know how many bosses I got.

7896
04:26:43,730 --> 04:26:44,390
Out of time.

7897
04:26:46,350 --> 04:26:46,410
Alright.

7898
04:26:46,450 --> 04:26:47,570
You got Pyrexec?

7899
04:26:47,890 --> 04:26:49,390
I got Worsec.

7900
04:26:49,930 --> 04:26:50,750
Clip, clip, clip!

7901
04:26:53,590 --> 04:26:56,390
Alright, hopefully someone submitted the clips.

7902
04:26:56,490 --> 04:26:56,850
I don't know.

7903
04:26:57,850 --> 04:26:58,690
Thanks, Moz!

7904
04:26:59,490 --> 04:27:00,370
I don't know.

7905
04:27:00,810 --> 04:27:01,730
We'll find out, I guess.

7906
04:27:03,710 --> 04:27:04,230
It's okay.

7907
04:27:05,190 --> 04:27:06,530
Get over here!

7908
04:27:07,110 --> 04:27:09,250
The last ten points right here!

7909
04:27:09,950 --> 04:27:10,570
Let's go!

7910
04:27:10,570 --> 04:27:10,910
Go!

7911
04:27:16,180 --> 04:27:19,120
I get a free pal while I'm fucking min-maxing?

7912
04:27:20,380 --> 04:27:21,380
Yeah, it was too hard.

7913
04:27:21,440 --> 04:27:22,220
It was worth a try.

7914
04:27:22,240 --> 04:27:23,620
I wanted those tokotokotokos.

7915
04:27:23,760 --> 04:27:26,240
But then I had to use like five...

7916
04:27:27,140 --> 04:27:28,520
...trazillion balls on one.

7917
04:27:29,960 --> 04:27:30,900
Please, please, no.

7918
04:27:31,160 --> 04:27:31,880
That's a lot of balls.

7919
04:27:32,600 --> 04:27:33,660
That is at least two balls.

7920
04:27:33,660 --> 04:27:34,940
I got two more clips!

7921
04:27:35,440 --> 04:27:36,420
I got two more!

7922
04:27:37,360 --> 04:27:37,800
Nice!

7923
04:27:38,260 --> 04:27:39,360
We got MVP!

7924
04:27:39,360 --> 04:27:42,060
Okay, how many minutes do I have left?

7925
04:27:42,820 --> 04:27:43,520
Like none.

7926
04:27:43,600 --> 04:27:44,120
Oh, one minute.

7927
04:27:44,180 --> 04:27:46,680
I got the one we needed.

7928
04:27:46,860 --> 04:27:49,020
Here we got the one ten.

7929
04:27:49,460 --> 04:27:50,640
The one ten pointer.

7930
04:27:51,720 --> 04:27:54,100
I've never even seen a fucking one fourteen.

7931
04:27:54,940 --> 04:27:57,740
Alright, do we have everything that ShoreFloor got though?

7932
04:27:58,540 --> 04:27:59,040
Alright, do we have everything that ShoreFloor got though?

7933
04:27:59,040 --> 04:27:59,520
I think so.

7934
04:27:59,840 --> 04:28:00,340
Maybe.

7935
04:28:00,560 --> 04:28:02,600
Can we double check?

7936
04:28:02,620 --> 04:28:03,860
Because we can report stuff.

7937
04:28:06,120 --> 04:28:06,820
That's it.

7938
04:28:06,980 --> 04:28:08,000
Double check everything.

7939
04:28:12,240 --> 04:28:13,960
Let me check the channel.

7940
04:28:14,060 --> 04:28:14,940
What clips we got.

7941
04:28:15,280 --> 04:28:17,300
Because we have five minutes to report everything.

7942
04:28:18,040 --> 04:28:18,800
Okay, okay, okay.

7943
04:28:19,680 --> 04:28:20,080
Alright.

7944
04:28:20,560 --> 04:28:21,660
We have the steak.

7945
04:28:25,230 --> 04:28:26,030
Yep, steak.

7946
04:28:26,830 --> 04:28:27,230
Photos.

7947
04:28:27,250 --> 04:28:28,490
We already reported the chicken.

7948
04:28:28,770 --> 04:28:29,690
The level 30 chicken.

7949
04:28:29,890 --> 04:28:33,990
My mods said they think they got most, but maybe we should run down the list.

7950
04:28:34,130 --> 04:28:34,910
Yeah, run down everything.

7951
04:28:35,310 --> 04:28:37,050
ShoreFloor, do you remember how many you've caught?

7952
04:28:37,330 --> 04:28:38,450
Can you like name it off?

7953
04:28:39,710 --> 04:28:42,270
You can also just look at the pile box and then...

7954
04:28:42,930 --> 04:28:44,470
Be like, hey, find this clip.

7955
04:28:44,710 --> 04:28:45,430
Ding ding.

7956
04:28:45,790 --> 04:28:47,630
I got the...

7957
04:28:48,790 --> 04:28:49,650
Broncherry Aqua.

7958
04:28:50,530 --> 04:28:52,430
The Fangalope was bugged.

7959
04:28:52,970 --> 04:28:54,150
Relaxed Source Lux.

7960
04:28:54,790 --> 04:28:55,310
Beacon.

7961
04:28:56,730 --> 04:28:57,770
And Petelia.

7962
04:28:57,990 --> 04:28:59,070
And Warsec.

7963
04:28:59,290 --> 04:29:02,030
So I got one, two, three...

7964
04:29:02,750 --> 04:29:03,710
Four, five.

7965
04:29:04,410 --> 04:29:04,930
Okay.

7966
04:29:05,390 --> 04:29:07,430
And then you got the chicken to level 30?

7967
04:29:07,430 --> 04:29:10,770
I would have gotten six if the Fangalope wasn't bugged.

7968
04:29:10,770 --> 04:29:11,950
Did you get the...

7969
04:29:11,950 --> 04:29:13,110
Did we clip the chicken already?

7970
04:29:13,390 --> 04:29:14,710
I took a screenshot.

7971
04:29:16,910 --> 04:29:17,390
Uhhhh...

7972
04:29:18,970 --> 04:29:20,190
Oh, they missed Aqua.

7973
04:29:20,590 --> 04:29:21,970
Okay, they missed the Aqua.

7974
04:29:23,810 --> 04:29:24,290
Uhhhh...

7975
04:29:25,510 --> 04:29:26,810
Did you get the chicken?

7976
04:29:26,850 --> 04:29:29,590
Oh, they said they haven't gotten the chicken to 30 screenshot yet.

7977
04:29:29,850 --> 04:29:29,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7978
04:29:30,570 --> 04:29:32,930
Yeah, I got to post it in the screenshot.

7979
04:29:33,770 --> 04:29:35,270
I think this is the screenshot.

7980
04:29:37,570 --> 04:29:39,930
See level 34 chicken right there.

7981
04:29:39,930 --> 04:29:40,790
Level 32.

7982
04:29:41,150 --> 04:29:45,170
Did they report that we have all the humans?

7983
04:29:45,510 --> 04:29:47,030
Like once we put them all together?

7984
04:29:47,430 --> 04:29:47,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7985
04:29:47,550 --> 04:29:48,230
There you got that.

7986
04:29:48,850 --> 04:29:50,730
So we got the fun achievements.

7987
04:29:52,090 --> 04:29:53,450
We got the level 12 base.

7988
04:29:54,810 --> 04:29:55,250
Yeah.

7989
04:29:55,390 --> 04:29:56,310
Is it in there?

7990
04:29:56,590 --> 04:29:58,310
Wait, did we take a photo of level 12 base?

7991
04:29:58,310 --> 04:29:58,730
I don't think we did.

7992
04:29:58,950 --> 04:29:59,710
I don't think so.

7993
04:29:59,970 --> 04:30:01,010
Oh no, we did, we did, we did.

7994
04:30:01,210 --> 04:30:01,890
Level 12 base.

7995
04:30:01,970 --> 04:30:10,250
I caught the Chilit, the Sweetpea, the Gumas, the Dumut, the Peaking, the Azirobe.

7996
04:30:10,610 --> 04:30:11,250
Let's see.

7997
04:30:14,210 --> 04:30:23,050
Uh, Azirobe, Penking, Quiverne, uh, Kingpaka, the Felbat, and the, yeah.

7998
04:30:23,210 --> 04:30:25,170
That's all the bosses I took out.

7999
04:30:25,310 --> 04:30:26,570
And I have two shinies.

8000
04:30:26,570 --> 04:30:28,710
The Fwock and the Lamba.

8001
04:30:30,930 --> 04:30:32,870
Because we have like the shiny thing, right?

8002
04:30:34,510 --> 04:30:35,610
Yeah, we have two shinies.

8003
04:30:35,650 --> 04:30:36,250
We got two shinies.

8004
04:30:36,770 --> 04:30:39,790
Oh, and then, well we have our registered pals.

8005
04:30:39,930 --> 04:30:40,870
How many pals do we have registered?

8006
04:30:41,390 --> 04:30:42,230
Uh, let me see.

8007
04:30:42,550 --> 04:30:43,830
Isn't that a global event?

8008
04:30:44,030 --> 04:30:45,410
Or is that per day?

8009
04:30:45,770 --> 04:30:48,150
Well, it's global, but doesn't that add it up?

8010
04:30:48,230 --> 04:30:49,410
Doesn't it add up to us?

8011
04:30:49,790 --> 04:30:54,770
I mean, we can just look at the very end of the event, because all you do is look at your pal deck and see registered.

8012
04:30:55,210 --> 04:30:57,170
I have, uh...

8013
04:30:57,170 --> 04:30:58,030
I have 41.

8014
04:30:58,350 --> 04:30:59,370
I have 39 registered.

8015
04:31:00,010 --> 04:31:01,590
Are we doing the...

8016
04:31:02,610 --> 04:31:03,610
Is it the encountered?

8017
04:31:03,810 --> 04:31:04,930
Or is it the registered?

8018
04:31:05,170 --> 04:31:05,710
It's registered.

8019
04:31:05,770 --> 04:31:06,150
Okay, 30.

8020
04:31:06,150 --> 04:31:08,190
I have 39 registered.

8021
04:31:09,070 --> 04:31:09,910
Okay, 21 registered.

8022
04:31:10,990 --> 04:31:11,510
Nice!

8023
04:31:12,890 --> 04:31:13,410
Uh...

8024
04:31:13,930 --> 04:31:14,450
21...

8025
04:31:17,900 --> 04:31:18,940
39 registered.

8026
04:31:18,980 --> 04:31:21,400
I don't know if it's like... does it count to...

8027
04:31:22,340 --> 04:31:22,860
Uh...

8028
04:31:22,860 --> 04:31:24,640
Okay, what's my statue of power?

8029
04:31:25,280 --> 04:31:26,320
I didn't even check.

8030
04:31:26,580 --> 04:31:27,700
I didn't even level it up.

8031
04:31:28,140 --> 04:31:31,020
Okay, I managed to get three tokotokos.

8032
04:31:31,060 --> 04:31:33,280
We don't have by chance... I have four.

8033
04:31:33,380 --> 04:31:34,300
No, we didn't.

8034
04:31:34,300 --> 04:31:34,580
We don't.

8035
04:31:35,580 --> 04:31:35,980
Level...

8036
04:31:36,920 --> 04:31:38,260
two... uh... power...

8037
04:31:38,260 --> 04:31:39,660
Oh, points per player is zero.

8038
04:31:39,740 --> 04:31:40,240
Okay, never mind.

8039
04:31:41,820 --> 04:31:42,220
Uhhhh...

8040
04:31:46,440 --> 04:31:48,520
Wait, did the lift monk matter today or tomorrow?

8041
04:31:48,800 --> 04:31:49,380
That's tomorrow.

8042
04:31:49,540 --> 04:31:50,020
That's global.

8043
04:31:50,240 --> 04:31:50,580
Okay, okay.

8044
04:31:51,100 --> 04:31:51,800
That's global.

8045
04:31:52,400 --> 04:31:52,600
Yeah.

8046
04:31:52,940 --> 04:31:55,800
And we can still do day one and day two.

8047
04:31:56,000 --> 04:31:56,960
And on the day where you're still...

8048
04:31:56,960 --> 04:31:59,080
Yeah, and tomorrow the EXP multiplier is gonna be 20.

8049
04:31:59,160 --> 04:31:59,460
Yeah.

8050
04:32:00,200 --> 04:32:00,600
So...

8051
04:32:02,780 --> 04:32:03,180
Uh...

8052
04:32:03,180 --> 04:32:04,160
It's gonna be kinda wild.

8053
04:32:05,500 --> 04:32:06,300
Let's see...

8054
04:32:07,480 --> 04:32:09,400
The only thing... so we did...

8055
04:32:09,400 --> 04:32:10,720
Yeah, did we... did we...

8056
04:32:10,720 --> 04:32:12,480
report all the ones we captured?

8057
04:32:13,400 --> 04:32:14,200
Oh, logout?

8058
04:32:14,320 --> 04:32:15,140
Oh, I forgot to logout.

8059
04:32:15,200 --> 04:32:15,400
Whoops.

8060
04:32:15,600 --> 04:32:15,920
Oh.

8061
04:32:16,860 --> 04:32:17,260
Logout.

8062
04:32:20,280 --> 04:32:21,300
Oh shit, we have to...

8063
04:32:21,300 --> 04:32:21,700
Yeah.

8064
04:32:22,140 --> 04:32:22,540
Logout.

8065
04:32:27,120 --> 04:32:27,520
Thanks.

8066
04:32:28,200 --> 04:32:29,040
Thanks for the reminder.

8067
04:32:29,200 --> 04:32:30,940
Wait, did the mod cut...

8068
04:32:30,940 --> 04:32:32,200
Did the mod cut all of it?

8069
04:32:32,980 --> 04:32:36,160
Did the mod cut all of our palace that we captured?

8070
04:32:37,100 --> 04:32:43,420
Chillsweet Ghumas Dumad, Pen King Azurobe Grintail Broncherry, right?

8071
04:32:43,480 --> 04:32:44,080
We got Broncherry.

8072
04:32:44,400 --> 04:32:51,140
Cimpaka, Bushy, Quivirn Fellbat Yeah.

8073
04:32:51,540 --> 04:32:52,100
Uh...

8074
04:32:52,100 --> 04:32:52,780
What else?

8075
04:32:53,120 --> 04:32:56,580
Battalia Broncherry Aqua.

8076
04:32:56,780 --> 04:32:57,900
You got both Broncherrys?

8077
04:32:59,040 --> 04:33:01,080
Just Broncherry Aqua, I'm pretty sure.

8078
04:33:01,220 --> 04:33:02,100
Oh, just Broncherry, okay.

8079
04:33:02,160 --> 04:33:05,980
Broncherry, Aqua, Warsec Relaxasaurus.

8080
04:33:06,300 --> 04:33:06,980
Is that Overlord?

8081
04:33:08,240 --> 04:33:08,800
Relaxasaur.

8082
04:33:09,280 --> 04:33:10,920
At... who's our mod?

8083
04:33:11,380 --> 04:33:12,620
What's the mod's name?

8084
04:33:12,820 --> 04:33:14,320
At Overlord.

8085
04:33:14,360 --> 04:33:16,300
Did you get all of them?

8086
04:33:17,980 --> 04:33:19,280
Did you close the server?

8087
04:33:21,160 --> 04:33:22,420
I logged out.

8088
04:33:22,680 --> 04:33:23,660
I logged out.

8089
04:33:23,940 --> 04:33:25,380
I don't know if that closes it or not.

8090
04:33:29,030 --> 04:33:32,070
I think we have everything.

8091
04:33:32,490 --> 04:33:32,810
The server.

8092
04:33:33,270 --> 04:33:34,750
We need Gumos clip?

8093
04:33:34,750 --> 04:33:36,530
Guys, where's the Gumos clip?

8094
04:33:37,410 --> 04:33:38,530
Which one is Gumos?

8095
04:33:38,670 --> 04:33:39,090
Gumos clip.

8096
04:33:39,090 --> 04:33:40,090
I didn't do Gumos.

8097
04:33:40,150 --> 04:33:40,490
I did.

8098
04:33:43,350 --> 04:33:43,750
Uhhhh...

8099
04:33:43,750 --> 04:33:46,090
Well, I had a screenshot of Gumos.

8100
04:33:46,290 --> 04:33:47,910
If you have a screenshot, that should be enough.

8101
04:33:47,910 --> 04:33:49,290
Someone has a Gumos clip.

8102
04:33:49,450 --> 04:33:49,830
There you go.

8103
04:33:50,730 --> 04:33:51,390
There you go.

8104
04:33:51,490 --> 04:33:52,990
If you can put it in the chat.

8105
04:33:54,250 --> 04:33:54,650
Nice.

8106
04:33:55,010 --> 04:33:55,330
Yeah.

8107
04:33:56,290 --> 04:33:57,790
Alright, that should be everything, right?

8108
04:33:58,610 --> 04:33:59,010
Okay.

8109
04:34:01,650 --> 04:34:02,050
We...

8110
04:34:03,810 --> 04:34:04,570
Now we die.

8111
04:34:04,750 --> 04:34:05,210
Now we...

8112
04:34:05,850 --> 04:34:06,870
Okay, now we're done.

8113
04:34:10,610 --> 04:34:11,810
That's all five minutes.

8114
04:34:12,110 --> 04:34:12,510
That's it.

8115
04:34:12,590 --> 04:34:14,130
I just saw my mod DM.

8116
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:15,530
It's got like 200 messages.

8117
04:34:16,850 --> 04:34:19,330
Mod, how could you not get the Gumos clip?

8118
04:34:20,890 --> 04:34:23,910
I worked so hard on getting that Gumos.

8119
04:34:25,650 --> 04:34:27,010
We got all the fun achievements.

8120
04:34:28,290 --> 04:34:28,490
Yeah.

8121
04:34:28,650 --> 04:34:29,010
Yeah.

8122
04:34:29,330 --> 04:34:30,010
We did.

8123
04:34:30,110 --> 04:34:30,270
We did.

8124
04:34:30,530 --> 04:34:31,210
We're having fun.

8125
04:34:31,210 --> 04:34:32,370
Except for the Toko's.

8126
04:34:32,410 --> 04:34:33,650
But that was on mute.

8127
04:34:35,710 --> 04:34:36,110
Yeah.

8128
04:34:36,110 --> 04:34:37,250
The dev enough balls.

8129
04:34:37,290 --> 04:34:38,870
What placement did we get in the end?

8130
04:34:39,530 --> 04:34:39,930
Guys.

8131
04:34:40,230 --> 04:34:40,890
For day one.

8132
04:34:40,890 --> 04:34:41,230
Are they still calculating?

8133
04:34:41,650 --> 04:34:42,450
I think they're still calculating.

8134
04:34:42,610 --> 04:34:44,590
Yeah, we sent stuff for so long.

8135
04:34:44,650 --> 04:34:45,390
Are they still calculating?

8136
04:34:45,890 --> 04:34:46,290
Yeah.

8137
04:34:46,530 --> 04:34:46,930
Yeah.

8138
04:34:47,030 --> 04:34:48,310
Well, at least now though.

8139
04:34:48,350 --> 04:34:50,270
Now we know what the achievements are.

8140
04:34:50,330 --> 04:34:52,550
So we can strategize for how we want to start day two.

8141
04:34:53,330 --> 04:34:53,730
Yeah.

8142
04:34:53,730 --> 04:34:55,290
And like what the plan is.

8143
04:34:55,450 --> 04:34:57,270
We're on 10th place right now.

8144
04:34:57,430 --> 04:34:58,430
Alright, that's how much money.

8145
04:34:58,430 --> 04:34:59,010
That's not bad.

8146
04:34:59,190 --> 04:35:01,430
I don't know if they're like finished calculating though.

8147
04:35:01,490 --> 04:35:01,990
That's the thing.

8148
04:35:02,890 --> 04:35:04,750
I don't know if they finished calculating.

8149
04:35:05,410 --> 04:35:06,950
Alright, that is...

8150
04:35:06,950 --> 04:35:09,250
Hey, that's $187.

8151
04:35:09,570 --> 04:35:10,290
Let's go.

8152
04:35:10,650 --> 04:35:10,910
Ay-yo.

8153
04:35:11,030 --> 04:35:11,990
Ay-yo.

8154
04:35:12,350 --> 04:35:12,850
Ay-y.

8155
04:35:13,270 --> 04:35:14,170
Ay-y.

8156
04:35:15,990 --> 04:35:18,590
The ranking also includes global points.

8157
04:35:18,790 --> 04:35:19,330
Not last.

8158
04:35:19,550 --> 04:35:20,830
Let's fucking go.

8159
04:35:21,030 --> 04:35:21,470
Ay-y.

8160
04:35:21,470 --> 04:35:22,170
We broke top 10.

8161
04:35:23,130 --> 04:35:24,550
Let's go top 10.

8162
04:35:25,030 --> 04:35:25,390
Top 10.

8163
04:35:25,390 --> 04:35:26,030
We still have time.

8164
04:35:26,490 --> 04:35:27,410
We still have time.

8165
04:35:28,050 --> 04:35:29,510
Well, how are we going to do tomorrow?

8166
04:35:30,470 --> 04:35:31,970
I can finish the day one.

8167
04:35:31,990 --> 04:35:35,210
I can finish like all the day one EZs.

8168
04:35:36,690 --> 04:35:37,250
Okay.

8169
04:35:39,430 --> 04:35:43,870
And then Shore4 can work on the other day ones that we missed.

8170
04:35:44,630 --> 04:35:45,290
Let's see.

8171
04:35:45,530 --> 04:35:45,810
Alright.

8172
04:35:46,810 --> 04:35:49,310
Day two, cook a mozzarella cheeseburger.

8173
04:35:49,510 --> 04:35:50,610
I think we already have the stuff for that.

8174
04:35:50,610 --> 04:35:52,550
We don't have any of our registered pals in yet.

8175
04:35:52,630 --> 04:35:54,170
So that's not in the scoring either.

8176
04:35:54,550 --> 04:35:54,790
Yeah.

8177
04:35:56,210 --> 04:36:01,970
I think looking at how many points we get for tomorrow, we should probably do...

8178
04:36:01,970 --> 04:36:05,710
We should probably do the leftover only if we have nothing better to do.

8179
04:36:05,790 --> 04:36:08,250
Because we only get half points for the day one.

8180
04:36:08,410 --> 04:36:15,690
And day two gives like already five times more baseline for similar difficulty for some of them.

8181
04:36:15,710 --> 04:36:23,730
So it seems kind of like what we might want to do is we might want to just do whatever we can to power level Shore to level 50.

8182
04:36:23,870 --> 04:36:25,610
So we can get a pal up to level 50.

8183
04:36:25,730 --> 04:36:26,830
And then we can take on...

8184
04:36:26,830 --> 04:36:28,670
Power level is just catching pals.

8185
04:36:29,090 --> 04:36:29,530
Yeah.

8186
04:36:29,730 --> 04:36:30,610
Just making balls.

8187
04:36:31,970 --> 04:36:33,870
I think I'll just make a ton of balls.

8188
04:36:33,970 --> 04:36:35,670
Because like we've been struggling all day.

8189
04:36:35,710 --> 04:36:36,070
Yeah.

8190
04:36:36,290 --> 04:36:37,330
We need balls.

8191
04:36:37,330 --> 04:36:37,750
Yeah.

8192
04:36:37,910 --> 04:36:38,350
Okay.

8193
04:36:38,450 --> 04:36:38,650
Yeah.

8194
04:36:38,670 --> 04:36:41,970
I think I'll just stick around in base and make sure they actually work.

8195
04:36:43,130 --> 04:36:43,910
And make balls.

8196
04:36:44,530 --> 04:36:46,350
Let me check on all of the...

8197
04:36:46,350 --> 04:36:51,670
I'll like make a list after this of all the materials that we need to get to base level 20.

8198
04:36:52,030 --> 04:36:52,470
Yeah.

8199
04:36:52,490 --> 04:36:53,210
Like just in total.

8200
04:36:55,010 --> 04:36:59,870
Because we're going to have to have probably sure make all of the items.

8201
04:36:59,870 --> 04:37:02,090
Because they're going to start getting into the high level stuff.

8202
04:37:02,310 --> 04:37:04,730
But I will check and see what we need.

8203
04:37:04,830 --> 04:37:06,510
I'm sure we're going to start needing things like...

8204
04:37:07,050 --> 04:37:08,150
Like coal and stuff.

8205
04:37:08,410 --> 04:37:08,650
So...

8206
04:37:08,650 --> 04:37:09,310
All right.

8207
04:37:09,370 --> 04:37:09,730
Yeah.

8208
04:37:10,110 --> 04:37:10,470
So...

8209
04:37:10,950 --> 04:37:11,310
Okay.

8210
04:37:11,510 --> 04:37:12,050
Legendary pal.

8211
04:37:12,870 --> 04:37:15,110
Take a photo with a lift monk energy inside the volcano.

8212
04:37:15,250 --> 04:37:15,550
Okay.

8213
04:37:15,590 --> 04:37:15,810
Easy.

8214
04:37:15,910 --> 04:37:16,030
Easy.

8215
04:37:17,570 --> 04:37:19,630
Get a photo of the top of the Asher Mountains.

8216
04:37:19,970 --> 04:37:20,330
Easy.

8217
04:37:20,430 --> 04:37:21,290
Second wildlife sanctuary.

8218
04:37:21,410 --> 04:37:21,770
Easy.

8219
04:37:22,130 --> 04:37:22,910
Third wildlife sanctuary.

8220
04:37:22,910 --> 04:37:24,370
We can get that in the last hour.

8221
04:37:24,410 --> 04:37:25,010
I feel like the photos.

8222
04:37:25,230 --> 04:37:25,590
Yeah.

8223
04:37:25,590 --> 04:37:25,690
Easy.

8224
04:37:25,910 --> 04:37:26,110
Easy.

8225
04:37:26,110 --> 04:37:28,430
We just have one person build bases and stuff.

8226
04:37:28,710 --> 04:37:28,910
Yeah.

8227
04:37:28,990 --> 04:37:29,250
Yeah.

8228
04:37:29,310 --> 04:37:29,650
So...

8229
04:37:29,650 --> 04:37:30,930
The strat worked well.

8230
04:37:30,990 --> 04:37:33,250
Because then one can just stay back and make balls.

8231
04:37:33,390 --> 04:37:33,610
Yeah.

8232
04:37:33,610 --> 04:37:34,690
And they have like no waypoints.

8233
04:37:34,790 --> 04:37:35,670
But it doesn't matter.

8234
04:37:35,830 --> 04:37:37,130
Because we can just teleport to base.

8235
04:37:37,130 --> 04:37:37,570
We need a rush hour hot dog.

8236
04:37:38,090 --> 04:37:39,570
A rush hour hot dog.

8237
04:37:39,590 --> 04:37:40,570
So we need to kill one of those.

8238
04:37:40,930 --> 04:37:42,550
And then a mozzarella cheeseburger.

8239
04:37:43,110 --> 04:37:43,830
I think...

8240
04:37:43,830 --> 04:37:45,530
I'm going to see what's in a mozzarella cheeseburger.

8241
04:37:45,650 --> 04:37:45,690
Okay.

8242
04:37:45,690 --> 04:37:46,890
Because we already have a whole bunch of milk.

8243
04:37:47,070 --> 04:37:48,330
So I think we already might be able to do it.

8244
04:37:48,330 --> 04:37:48,350
Yeah.

8245
04:37:48,350 --> 04:37:48,870
We have tons of milk.

8246
04:37:49,550 --> 04:37:50,190
I think like...

8247
04:37:50,190 --> 04:37:50,570
Oh, that's right.

8248
04:37:50,610 --> 04:37:51,630
My Z key doesn't work anymore.

8249
04:37:52,750 --> 04:37:53,110
Sure.

8250
04:37:53,130 --> 04:37:54,590
For you need to get to level 50.

8251
04:37:54,730 --> 04:37:55,090
Okay.

8252
04:37:55,950 --> 04:37:58,550
That should be fine on the multiplier as long as balls.

8253
04:37:59,010 --> 04:37:59,170
Yeah.

8254
04:37:59,230 --> 04:38:00,010
You need level 50.

8255
04:38:00,010 --> 04:38:00,290
Yeah.

8256
04:38:00,550 --> 04:38:02,310
Because you need to get power to level 50.

8257
04:38:04,030 --> 04:38:04,710
Or you can catch it.

8258
04:38:04,710 --> 04:38:05,190
But just catch it.

8259
04:38:05,250 --> 04:38:05,890
It's hot on the balls.

8260
04:38:05,970 --> 04:38:07,270
And the mozzarella cheeseburger...

8261
04:38:07,770 --> 04:38:08,130
Honestly, the level should be fine.

8262
04:38:09,570 --> 04:38:09,930
Requires...

8263
04:38:09,930 --> 04:38:11,530
Oh, we need an electric kitchen.

8264
04:38:11,650 --> 04:38:12,370
That's the problem.

8265
04:38:12,470 --> 04:38:13,570
We have all this stuff for it.

8266
04:38:13,590 --> 04:38:14,530
But we need to be level 41.

8267
04:38:14,530 --> 04:38:14,670
Yeah.

8268
04:38:14,670 --> 04:38:14,790
But sure for...

8269
04:38:14,790 --> 04:38:16,310
Sure for getting the power level fast.

8270
04:38:16,770 --> 04:38:16,970
Uh-huh.

8271
04:38:19,950 --> 04:38:21,550
And I guess like I can...

8272
04:38:21,550 --> 04:38:23,570
I'll start power leveling as well.

8273
04:38:23,570 --> 04:38:25,070
So I can help out with catching the balls.

8274
04:38:25,090 --> 04:38:25,410
Yeah.

8275
04:38:25,410 --> 04:38:28,490
And then I can help out with the stronger powers like the Verdasch, Memorus and the Velet.

8276
04:38:28,710 --> 04:38:30,670
And then sure for can work on the hard ones.

8277
04:38:32,510 --> 04:38:32,870
Yeah.

8278
04:38:32,910 --> 04:38:37,570
I'll probably keep management of inventory.

8279
04:38:37,790 --> 04:38:40,390
And then once the base is at level 20, I'll just go back.

8280
04:38:40,590 --> 04:38:40,870
We need the breeding too.

8281
04:38:40,870 --> 04:38:42,470
We need to work on the breeding stuff as well.

8282
04:38:42,810 --> 04:38:43,170
Yeah.

8283
04:38:43,170 --> 04:38:43,410
Yep.

8284
04:38:43,850 --> 04:38:44,210
Okay.

8285
04:38:45,350 --> 04:38:47,310
I think you just do base management.

8286
04:38:47,370 --> 04:38:49,430
I'll just craft balls.

8287
04:38:49,750 --> 04:38:50,110
Okay.

8288
04:38:50,110 --> 04:38:53,070
The base management, a lot of it is going to be just making sure we have enough stuff.

8289
04:38:53,170 --> 04:38:54,830
And then once we do, being like, okay, come back.

8290
04:38:54,890 --> 04:38:55,050
Sure.

8291
04:38:56,870 --> 04:38:57,930
So, all right.

8292
04:38:58,330 --> 04:38:59,530
Come back crafting.

8293
04:38:59,710 --> 04:38:59,930
Yeah.

8294
04:38:59,930 --> 04:39:00,250
Come back.

8295
04:39:00,250 --> 04:39:00,890
Please make this.

8296
04:39:00,950 --> 04:39:01,370
Thank you.

8297
04:39:01,770 --> 04:39:02,350
All right.

8298
04:39:03,170 --> 04:39:03,610
Yeah.

8299
04:39:03,710 --> 04:39:04,050
Breeding.

8300
04:39:04,190 --> 04:39:04,550
Okay.

8301
04:39:06,470 --> 04:39:07,250
Figure that out.

8302
04:39:09,450 --> 04:39:09,890
Okay.

8303
04:39:09,970 --> 04:39:13,030
I'll take breeding and base management for tomorrow.

8304
04:39:13,250 --> 04:39:13,330
Sounds good.

8305
04:39:13,810 --> 04:39:18,250
I'll take balls and the materials we spent on the balls.

8306
04:39:18,350 --> 04:39:18,790
I'll help capturing.

8307
04:39:18,790 --> 04:39:22,110
I guess cooking too because cooking is also just base management.

8308
04:39:22,110 --> 04:39:22,410
Our only soft cap is really ingots.

8309
04:39:22,430 --> 04:39:22,730
Yeah.

8310
04:39:22,750 --> 04:39:22,910
Yeah.

8311
04:39:22,990 --> 04:39:24,110
Apparently we can get 700.

8312
04:39:24,110 --> 04:39:24,590
I've seen a fine with it.

8313
04:39:24,690 --> 04:39:25,070
I've seen a fine with it.

8314
04:39:25,070 --> 04:39:25,950
We can get 700 points for petting.

8315
04:39:26,910 --> 04:39:27,370
Huh?

8316
04:39:27,550 --> 04:39:27,770
Nice.

8317
04:39:27,770 --> 04:39:31,590
We can get 700 points if we find... but we need to catch every type though.

8318
04:39:32,570 --> 04:39:33,530
There's so many.

8319
04:39:33,550 --> 04:39:35,290
We probably already do have every type though.

8320
04:39:36,370 --> 04:39:41,570
We need water, grass, dark, ice, earth, fire, electric dragon.

8321
04:39:41,870 --> 04:39:43,570
The hardest one is dragon and we have dragon.

8322
04:39:43,890 --> 04:39:44,350
Yeah.

8323
04:39:44,470 --> 04:39:45,010
Oh, okay.

8324
04:39:45,150 --> 04:39:45,610
So, we're good.

8325
04:39:45,750 --> 04:39:46,450
We're good already.

8326
04:39:48,270 --> 04:39:48,990
Let's see.

8327
04:39:49,110 --> 04:39:49,870
I'm just checking.

8328
04:39:50,250 --> 04:39:51,830
They didn't count our chicken.

8329
04:39:52,050 --> 04:39:53,770
We worked so hard on the chicken.

8330
04:39:53,890 --> 04:39:54,750
What do you mean?

8331
04:39:55,290 --> 04:39:56,430
They didn't count our chicken.

8332
04:39:56,430 --> 04:39:56,450
Why not?

8333
04:39:56,450 --> 04:39:58,330
They're telling me about my fangalope being bugged.

8334
04:39:58,610 --> 04:40:00,230
I can't believe it.

8335
04:40:01,010 --> 04:40:02,510
Wait, why didn't the chicken count?

8336
04:40:02,710 --> 04:40:03,090
What the heck?

8337
04:40:03,690 --> 04:40:09,530
When it says patting different pals of the same element, does that mean that we need to have four of the same element pal in the same screenshot?

8338
04:40:10,150 --> 04:40:10,550
Maybe.

8339
04:40:10,930 --> 04:40:12,610
Because that's what it looks like in the photo.

8340
04:40:13,010 --> 04:40:13,670
The attached photo.

8341
04:40:13,670 --> 04:40:14,610
I guess all four of us.

8342
04:40:14,630 --> 04:40:16,670
Yeah, all four of us pet like different ones.

8343
04:40:16,730 --> 04:40:17,910
Okay, so we need four dragons.

8344
04:40:18,290 --> 04:40:18,690
Yeah.

8345
04:40:18,890 --> 04:40:22,250
But isn't the flying wavern thing, isn't that one a dragon?

8346
04:40:22,510 --> 04:40:24,730
We're all teammates are paying different pals of the same element.

8347
04:40:24,750 --> 04:40:29,430
So we just need to make sure we're all petting the same one.

8348
04:40:29,550 --> 04:40:29,950
Okay.

8349
04:40:30,650 --> 04:40:31,770
Oh, all right.

8350
04:40:32,530 --> 04:40:33,730
I love stroking pals.

8351
04:40:33,730 --> 04:40:34,670
Different pals of the same element.

8352
04:40:34,670 --> 04:40:36,390
I got pals all over my shit.

8353
04:40:38,490 --> 04:40:38,890
Yay.

8354
04:40:39,550 --> 04:40:40,610
I guess that's it, right?

8355
04:40:40,770 --> 04:40:41,390
I think.

8356
04:40:41,610 --> 04:40:42,610
I think so.

8357
04:40:42,790 --> 04:40:43,370
Until tomorrow.

8358
04:40:43,630 --> 04:40:44,310
Yeah, until tomorrow.

8359
04:40:44,330 --> 04:40:46,110
And then we fucking grind our shit out.

8360
04:40:46,950 --> 04:40:47,530
Grind it.

8361
04:40:47,730 --> 04:40:48,330
All right.

8362
04:40:48,330 --> 04:40:49,170
We got 10 plays.

8363
04:40:49,350 --> 04:40:49,810
Let's go.

8364
04:40:49,970 --> 04:40:50,550
Day one.

8365
04:40:50,550 --> 04:40:51,110
10 plays.

8366
04:40:51,590 --> 04:40:52,270
Not bad.

8367
04:40:52,390 --> 04:40:52,770
Not bad.

8368
04:40:53,070 --> 04:40:53,950
Top 10.

8369
04:40:53,990 --> 04:40:54,630
I think we're hot.

8370
04:40:54,650 --> 04:40:54,730
We're hot.

8371
04:40:54,730 --> 04:40:55,590
Trust the process.

8372
04:40:55,770 --> 04:40:56,410
Trust the process.

8373
04:40:56,630 --> 04:41:00,550
I think we're higher too because we don't have our pokey deck points.

8374
04:41:00,970 --> 04:41:01,330
Yeah.

8375
04:41:01,330 --> 04:41:01,610
Yeah.

8376
04:41:01,690 --> 04:41:01,950
Yeah.

8377
04:41:02,630 --> 04:41:02,990
Yeah.

8378
04:41:02,990 --> 04:41:03,530
Trust the process.

8379
04:41:03,950 --> 04:41:04,210
It's 4 fucking AM.

8380
04:41:04,430 --> 04:41:05,150
I'mma bounce.

8381
04:41:05,850 --> 04:41:06,210
Bruh.

8382
04:41:07,210 --> 04:41:07,930
Go sleep.

8383
04:41:07,990 --> 04:41:08,470
Oh my God.

8384
04:41:08,490 --> 04:41:08,610
Yeah.

8385
04:41:08,650 --> 04:41:09,250
Head to bed.

8386
04:41:09,650 --> 04:41:10,530
You guys have pictures?

8387
04:41:10,670 --> 04:41:10,950
Oh wait.

8388
04:41:10,970 --> 04:41:12,530
They want pictures of the registered pals.

8389
04:41:13,350 --> 04:41:13,710
Oh.

8390
04:41:13,730 --> 04:41:15,270
I have to log back in though.

8391
04:41:15,450 --> 04:41:15,990
Look at my pal deck.

8392
04:41:16,010 --> 04:41:16,070
Oh.

8393
04:41:16,170 --> 04:41:17,330
I would have to log back in.

8394
04:41:17,350 --> 04:41:17,630
Okay.

8395
04:41:17,630 --> 04:41:18,330
No.

8396
04:41:18,410 --> 04:41:19,990
We must have looked at our pal deck, right?

8397
04:41:20,670 --> 04:41:22,250
I can just log in real quick.

8398
04:41:22,450 --> 04:41:22,570
Oh.

8399
04:41:22,630 --> 04:41:23,830
I mean on stream.

8400
04:41:24,110 --> 04:41:24,250
Yeah.

8401
04:41:24,370 --> 04:41:24,670
Yeah.

8402
04:41:24,750 --> 04:41:24,830
Yeah.

8403
04:41:24,830 --> 04:41:25,650
They said they want...

8404
04:41:25,650 --> 04:41:25,830
Oh yeah.

8405
04:41:25,910 --> 04:41:27,210
You just got a picture from your stream.

8406
04:41:27,210 --> 04:41:29,770
I think I'm covering the pal deck on stream.

8407
04:41:29,870 --> 04:41:30,090
No.

8408
04:41:30,250 --> 04:41:30,770
Let me check my...

8409
04:41:30,770 --> 04:41:31,090
Wait.

8410
04:41:31,150 --> 04:41:32,810
Am I allowed to log back in for that or no?

8411
04:41:32,810 --> 04:41:33,110
I don't think so.

8412
04:41:33,290 --> 04:41:33,550
No.

8413
04:41:33,630 --> 04:41:34,290
We can't.

8414
04:41:34,330 --> 04:41:35,610
I think we have it on our stream.

8415
04:41:35,710 --> 04:41:37,290
Do you guys have a clip?

8416
04:41:37,570 --> 04:41:37,930
Guys?

8417
04:41:37,990 --> 04:41:39,490
Do you guys have clips?

8418
04:41:41,210 --> 04:41:45,650
I mean I said it out loud but there's no rewind on Twitch.

8419
04:41:45,690 --> 04:41:47,610
I mean I could easily be like, I have it.

8420
04:41:47,610 --> 04:41:48,770
I have 200 pal.

8421
04:41:50,930 --> 04:41:51,330
That's not how it works.

8422
04:41:51,610 --> 04:41:53,190
It's global so it doesn't matter, right?

8423
04:41:53,290 --> 04:41:53,930
We can get it tomorrow.

8424
04:41:54,250 --> 04:41:54,750
It's just a...

8425
04:41:54,750 --> 04:41:55,450
It's a global one.

8426
04:41:55,450 --> 04:41:55,570
Yeah.

8427
04:41:55,570 --> 04:41:56,270
It's a global point.

8428
04:41:56,370 --> 04:41:56,630
Okay.

8429
04:41:56,630 --> 04:41:58,450
But if it means we get like nine...

8430
04:41:58,450 --> 04:41:58,790
I guess...

8431
04:41:58,790 --> 04:41:58,950
Okay.

8432
04:41:59,030 --> 04:42:00,190
We're not gonna get like seventh place.

8433
04:42:00,330 --> 04:42:00,690
Nevermind.

8434
04:42:01,490 --> 04:42:02,050
I'm gonna say...

8435
04:42:02,050 --> 04:42:02,390
Wait.

8436
04:42:02,390 --> 04:42:04,150
What happens if you're in the top whatever?

8437
04:42:04,890 --> 04:42:05,410
Top what?

8438
04:42:07,190 --> 04:42:07,670
What do you mean?

8439
04:42:07,670 --> 04:42:07,850
Yeah.

8440
04:42:07,850 --> 04:42:08,610
Does it matter right now?

8441
04:42:08,750 --> 04:42:09,590
I mean it means like...

8442
04:42:09,590 --> 04:42:11,310
Or you said does it matter if we're seventh place or whatever?

8443
04:42:11,510 --> 04:42:14,030
If we get to seventh place, we're 10th place currently.

8444
04:42:14,750 --> 04:42:17,210
So like if we could get to seventh place, we just get more money.

8445
04:42:18,310 --> 04:42:19,190
On day one?

8446
04:42:19,430 --> 04:42:19,790
Yeah.

8447
04:42:19,850 --> 04:42:20,230
On day one.

8448
04:42:20,330 --> 04:42:20,550
Yeah.

8449
04:42:20,790 --> 04:42:21,530
Oh shit.

8450
04:42:22,350 --> 04:42:26,350
Let me check the wallet if you can see the registered palts.

8451
04:42:28,290 --> 04:42:29,850
But I'm pretty sure I'm covering...

8452
04:42:29,850 --> 04:42:32,330
I think it's like in the bottom left corner, isn't it?

8453
04:42:32,390 --> 04:42:33,710
When you open the paldex.

8454
04:42:33,870 --> 04:42:34,950
I think I'm covering it.

8455
04:42:34,950 --> 04:42:35,830
I have no idea.

8456
04:42:36,010 --> 04:42:39,070
I mean if we're allowed to log in real quick, I can check but...

8457
04:42:40,790 --> 04:42:42,630
When we're opening the fucking paldex.

8458
04:42:43,490 --> 04:42:43,850
Yeah.

8459
04:42:44,030 --> 04:42:45,250
I wish I could just open it.

8460
04:42:45,610 --> 04:42:46,010
Yeah.

8461
04:42:47,130 --> 04:42:47,910
Oh my god.

8462
04:42:48,010 --> 04:42:49,930
Can we ping a mod and just ask them if we can open it?

8463
04:42:50,170 --> 04:42:50,890
Yeah, you can.

8464
04:42:51,510 --> 04:42:52,730
Alright, I'm just gonna ping a mod.

8465
04:42:53,650 --> 04:42:55,690
Because I don't think any of us had that.

8466
04:42:59,960 --> 04:43:01,100
Yeah, I know I have 39.

8467
04:43:01,100 --> 04:43:02,700
I like showed it on my end.

8468
04:43:03,640 --> 04:43:04,500
That we have 39.

8469
04:43:06,840 --> 04:43:11,380
Yeah, I'm covering it with my model and you can't fucking see it on stream.

8470
04:43:11,720 --> 04:43:11,960
Oh no.

8471
04:43:12,080 --> 04:43:13,980
I haven't opened but you can't see.

8472
04:43:14,480 --> 04:43:15,240
That's so unlucky.

8473
04:43:15,240 --> 04:43:15,660
I got my 41.

8474
04:43:16,600 --> 04:43:17,720
That's so unlucky.

8475
04:43:17,940 --> 04:43:18,840
Wait, who has the clip?

8476
04:43:19,140 --> 04:43:20,800
Does anyone have the clip of my 39?

8477
04:43:21,560 --> 04:43:23,620
Does anybody have a clip of my 32?

8478
04:43:23,620 --> 04:43:25,160
Does anyone have a clip of that?

8479
04:43:28,960 --> 04:43:30,040
What do you mean me too?

8480
04:43:30,120 --> 04:43:32,620
If I was a facecam streamer, I would cover it too.

8481
04:43:32,740 --> 04:43:33,440
It's the same position.

8482
04:43:35,220 --> 04:43:35,900
What do you mean?

8483
04:43:36,300 --> 04:43:38,260
I mean, you could have put it on the other side.

8484
04:43:39,360 --> 04:43:40,000
I guess.

8485
04:43:40,060 --> 04:43:40,800
I guess so.

8486
04:43:41,700 --> 04:43:42,060
Yeah.

8487
04:43:42,500 --> 04:43:42,860
Yeah.

8488
04:43:42,880 --> 04:43:43,080
Okay.

8489
04:43:44,560 --> 04:43:44,920
Yeah.

8490
04:43:44,940 --> 04:43:45,120
Okay.

8491
04:43:45,140 --> 04:43:45,220
Yeah.

8492
04:43:47,800 --> 04:43:49,160
I got it.

8493
04:43:49,380 --> 04:43:50,020
Yeah.

8494
04:43:50,140 --> 04:43:52,020
I only looked at it one time really briefly.

8495
04:43:52,340 --> 04:43:53,340
It's mine.

8496
04:43:55,080 --> 04:43:58,060
Apparently they're still calculating scores.

8497
04:43:58,740 --> 04:44:00,740
We're 11 not who the fuck?

8498
04:44:00,920 --> 04:44:01,340
How?

8499
04:44:01,680 --> 04:44:02,640
What the fuck?

8500
04:44:02,820 --> 04:44:03,860
How are we 11?

8501
04:44:05,840 --> 04:44:07,120
What happened?

8502
04:44:07,340 --> 04:44:08,400
What did I do?

8503
04:44:09,320 --> 04:44:11,780
Because they showed their registered pals.

8504
04:44:13,000 --> 04:44:14,340
Oh, they said no.

8505
04:44:14,500 --> 04:44:14,780
No.

8506
04:44:14,780 --> 04:44:14,860
Oh, they said no.

8507
04:44:14,860 --> 04:44:15,040
Oh, they said no.

8508
04:44:15,040 --> 04:44:15,200
Oh, they said no.

8509
04:44:15,200 --> 04:44:15,680
Okay.

8510
04:44:15,780 --> 04:44:16,020
Well...

8511
04:44:16,020 --> 04:44:19,300
Team Burn found eight lucky pals.

8512
04:44:19,540 --> 04:44:20,260
What the fuck?

8513
04:44:20,500 --> 04:44:21,040
They found eight?

8514
04:44:21,080 --> 04:44:21,260
Wait.

8515
04:44:21,320 --> 04:44:23,540
Did we show our lucky pals?

8516
04:44:23,840 --> 04:44:25,680
Ma, did you show my lucky pals?

8517
04:44:25,800 --> 04:44:26,420
Yeah, we have two.

8518
04:44:26,740 --> 04:44:27,820
It counts as two.

8519
04:44:28,100 --> 04:44:28,300
Yeah.

8520
04:44:28,420 --> 04:44:30,380
I don't know if the Ma showed it though.

8521
04:44:31,940 --> 04:44:33,460
Ma, I worked so hard.

8522
04:44:33,540 --> 04:44:34,660
I swear to God.

8523
04:44:34,860 --> 04:44:36,820
I worked incredibly hard.

8524
04:44:37,040 --> 04:44:37,500
Did we put the lucky pals in here?

8525
04:44:37,500 --> 04:44:37,920
Yeah, they did.

8526
04:44:38,000 --> 04:44:38,360
They did.

8527
04:44:38,460 --> 04:44:39,060
They got one.

8528
04:44:39,880 --> 04:44:40,780
They got what?

8529
04:44:40,880 --> 04:44:41,520
Oh, they got two.

8530
04:44:41,580 --> 04:44:42,040
Thank God.

8531
04:44:42,080 --> 04:44:42,300
Okay.

8532
04:44:42,420 --> 04:44:42,580
Okay.

8533
04:44:42,580 --> 04:44:44,780
I worked so hard capturing this.

8534
04:44:45,000 --> 04:44:46,240
Try and find the clip of yours registered.

8535
04:44:46,240 --> 04:44:47,520
My mods are scrubbing the VOD.

8536
04:44:47,900 --> 04:44:49,640
Shy Lily is not available.

8537
04:44:50,380 --> 04:44:50,780
What?

8538
04:44:51,560 --> 04:44:53,580
Your registered pals are not available.

8539
04:44:54,960 --> 04:44:55,680
Damn it.

8540
04:44:56,440 --> 04:44:57,600
You can kind of...

8541
04:44:57,600 --> 04:45:00,380
If you know where it is in the UI, you can see it.

8542
04:45:00,440 --> 04:45:00,840
Wait.

8543
04:45:00,860 --> 04:45:00,980
Wait.

8544
04:45:00,980 --> 04:45:01,800
You know what you can do?

8545
04:45:02,660 --> 04:45:03,300
Oh, wait.

8546
04:45:03,360 --> 04:45:03,680
That's right.

8547
04:45:03,720 --> 04:45:04,300
You were in front of it.

8548
04:45:04,320 --> 04:45:06,480
For mine, I could just stop the stream right now.

8549
04:45:06,520 --> 04:45:08,420
It'll create a VOD and then they can grab it.

8550
04:45:08,420 --> 04:45:08,580
Yeah.

8551
04:45:09,380 --> 04:45:09,980
Do it.

8552
04:45:10,060 --> 04:45:10,540
Do that.

8553
04:45:12,580 --> 04:45:13,400
I'm going to stop the stream for one second, Huan.

8554
04:45:13,480 --> 04:45:14,080
Hold the line.

8555
04:45:14,180 --> 04:45:14,520
Hold the line.

8556
04:45:15,940 --> 04:45:16,300
Wait.

8557
04:45:16,400 --> 04:45:16,860
I have the...

8558
04:45:16,860 --> 04:45:17,560
I have the VOD.

8559
04:45:17,600 --> 04:45:18,020
Like, it's...

8560
04:45:18,020 --> 04:45:18,940
I have live VOD.

8561
04:45:21,620 --> 04:45:22,100
Oh, wait.

8562
04:45:22,120 --> 04:45:22,560
They got it.

8563
04:45:22,580 --> 04:45:22,880
They got...

8564
04:45:22,880 --> 04:45:23,460
Someone got it.

8565
04:45:23,940 --> 04:45:24,300
You're...

8566
04:45:24,300 --> 04:45:25,740
Oh, she already stopped her stream.

8567
04:45:25,800 --> 04:45:25,980
Yes.

8568
04:45:26,700 --> 04:45:27,180
You can...

8569
04:45:27,180 --> 04:45:27,360
Oh, shit.

8570
04:45:29,140 --> 04:45:30,700
You can see the 21.

8571
04:45:30,940 --> 04:45:31,460
You can...

8572
04:45:31,460 --> 04:45:33,080
If you go into the VOD...

8573
04:45:33,080 --> 04:45:33,240
Okay.

8574
04:45:33,280 --> 04:45:34,160
I'm making a clip.

8575
04:45:34,200 --> 04:45:34,800
If you go here...

8576
04:45:34,800 --> 04:45:35,360
You can still have the sense of the bot while you're streaming?

8577
04:45:35,540 --> 04:45:35,840
What?

8578
04:45:35,860 --> 04:45:36,700
I didn't know that.

8579
04:45:37,060 --> 04:45:38,920
You can see it says 21.

8580
04:45:39,240 --> 04:45:39,820
It's just...

8581
04:45:39,820 --> 04:45:41,720
You just don't see that it says caption...

8582
04:45:41,720 --> 04:45:42,900
But you know that's the UI.

8583
04:45:44,040 --> 04:45:45,080
You know it's there.

8584
04:45:45,120 --> 04:45:45,400
Just post it.

8585
04:45:45,520 --> 04:45:46,700
Just post it.

8586
04:45:46,780 --> 04:45:47,000
Fuck it.

8587
04:45:47,000 --> 04:45:47,280
We ball.

8588
04:45:47,400 --> 04:45:47,940
It technically...

8589
04:45:47,940 --> 04:45:47,960
All right.

8590
04:45:47,960 --> 04:45:48,020
All right.

8591
04:45:48,020 --> 04:45:48,300
Post it.

8592
04:45:48,520 --> 04:45:48,820
Post it.

8593
04:45:48,840 --> 04:45:49,380
Post it.

8594
04:45:49,700 --> 04:45:50,280
Post it.

8595
04:45:50,320 --> 04:45:50,880
Post it.

8596
04:45:50,900 --> 04:45:51,060
Post it.

8597
04:45:51,240 --> 04:45:52,780
It technically counts.

8598
04:45:53,020 --> 04:45:54,100
It counts.

8599
04:45:54,480 --> 04:45:55,900
Let me get it.

8600
04:45:55,900 --> 04:45:56,360
Dude, wild.

8601
04:45:57,060 --> 04:45:57,760
Thanks, mods.

8602
04:46:00,160 --> 04:46:01,340
Well, I'm going to go.

8603
04:46:01,380 --> 04:46:02,320
I need to go to the washroom.

8604
04:46:02,480 --> 04:46:02,780
Okay.

8605
04:46:02,900 --> 04:46:03,300
All right.

8606
04:46:03,340 --> 04:46:04,060
Cheat cheese.

8607
04:46:04,200 --> 04:46:05,440
See you guys tomorrow.

8608
04:46:05,660 --> 04:46:06,480
Cheat cheese.

8609
04:46:11,000 --> 04:46:11,360
See you.

8610
04:46:11,360 --> 04:46:11,440
All right.

8611
04:46:11,560 --> 04:46:12,200
Are we all good?

8612
04:46:12,460 --> 04:46:13,980
I think so.

8613
04:46:13,980 --> 04:46:14,180
I think so.

8614
04:46:14,180 --> 04:46:15,360
I'll come up with a plan for tomorrow.

8615
04:46:15,420 --> 04:46:15,440
Are we all good now?

8616
04:46:15,440 --> 04:46:15,520
I think so.

8617
04:46:15,700 --> 04:46:16,740
Just double-checking.

8618
04:46:16,740 --> 04:46:18,140
I am on base cooking and breeding.

8619
04:46:18,140 --> 04:46:20,600
Yeah, I'm just gonna power level and help.

8620
04:46:20,620 --> 04:46:22,540
I'm just gonna help.

8621
04:46:22,540 --> 04:46:26,120
I'm power leveling and helping Sherifor with capturing pals.

8622
04:46:26,800 --> 04:46:29,280
I evolved into a tradwife over this stream.

8623
04:46:29,360 --> 04:46:31,440
I'm just gonna take care of the house and the kids.

8624
04:46:32,020 --> 04:46:33,200
Oh my god.

8625
04:46:34,640 --> 04:46:41,260
Where the fuck are they finding like... where are they find... we're playing like Twitch plays some random maze right now.

8626
04:46:41,420 --> 04:46:43,100
Where are they finding like placements?

8627
04:46:46,820 --> 04:46:47,380
Bro.

8628
04:46:48,220 --> 04:46:50,320
How do they know what the placements are?

8629
04:46:50,320 --> 04:46:51,280
Wait, did we drop again?

8630
04:46:51,620 --> 04:46:51,840
No.

8631
04:46:52,420 --> 04:46:53,960
No, don't tell me that.

8632
04:46:54,180 --> 04:46:54,520
No.

8633
04:46:55,140 --> 04:46:56,460
I don't wanna hear it.

8634
04:46:57,520 --> 04:47:00,040
I just wanna pretend to be top 10.

8635
04:47:02,900 --> 04:47:07,300
I'm almost top 10.

8636
04:47:07,400 --> 04:47:09,120
That's almost like top 10.

8637
04:47:10,240 --> 04:47:11,960
Nice level 10 points.

8638
04:47:12,000 --> 04:47:12,520
Wait, wait.

8639
04:47:12,520 --> 04:47:13,080
It could be 10 points.

8640
04:47:13,100 --> 04:47:13,940
Wait, no.

8641
04:47:14,260 --> 04:47:16,240
It's like... it's still calculating.

8642
04:47:16,580 --> 04:47:17,260
It should have count.

8643
04:47:17,540 --> 04:47:17,700
Yeah.

8644
04:47:18,020 --> 04:47:24,140
Wait, but like does it count or... I'll peek at it from behind the hair.

8645
04:47:25,460 --> 04:47:26,940
Yes, you can see.

8646
04:47:27,160 --> 04:47:29,760
I'm moving around and you can see it peek through.

8647
04:47:30,000 --> 04:47:31,220
Give us 10 points.

8648
04:47:31,260 --> 04:47:31,400
You can tell it's a 21.

8649
04:47:31,940 --> 04:47:32,420
Yeah.

8650
04:47:32,940 --> 04:47:33,840
Come on.

8651
04:47:34,260 --> 04:47:36,900
You know it says... it says capture.

8652
04:47:37,100 --> 04:47:37,840
You know that's...

8653
04:47:38,800 --> 04:47:40,480
You know I say.

8654
04:47:40,480 --> 04:47:40,920
No.

8655
04:47:42,040 --> 04:47:43,820
Give us those 10 points.

8656
04:47:45,800 --> 04:47:47,080
You know it's there.

8657
04:47:47,180 --> 04:47:48,560
Don't be weird, bot.

8658
04:47:50,300 --> 04:47:51,440
You know it's there.

8659
04:47:51,980 --> 04:47:52,960
You know it's there.

8660
04:47:53,060 --> 04:47:54,660
I'm watching the clip.

8661
04:47:54,820 --> 04:47:55,380
I'm watching the clip back.

8662
04:47:56,760 --> 04:47:58,420
It might be more towards the end.

8663
04:47:58,460 --> 04:47:59,960
You can clearly see it's a 21.

8664
04:48:00,100 --> 04:48:00,740
It says 21.

8665
04:48:01,000 --> 04:48:02,100
You can clearly see it.

8666
04:48:03,020 --> 04:48:03,520
Yeah.

8667
04:48:03,560 --> 04:48:04,400
Oh, yeah.

8668
04:48:04,500 --> 04:48:05,520
You can definitely see it.

8669
04:48:05,520 --> 04:48:05,800
Yeah.

8670
04:48:06,140 --> 04:48:06,800
I'm seeing.

8671
04:48:08,240 --> 04:48:08,740
Bro.

8672
04:48:08,840 --> 04:48:09,520
Screenshot of it.

8673
04:48:09,520 --> 04:48:10,360
We literally... Okay.

8674
04:48:10,360 --> 04:48:10,900
If we count it, we can see it.

8675
04:48:10,900 --> 04:48:11,080
Yeah.

8676
04:48:11,080 --> 04:48:14,680
We got all our... If we count our pal register points, that's like 30 points.

8677
04:48:14,840 --> 04:48:16,300
And then we'll be back to top 10.

8678
04:48:18,980 --> 04:48:19,420
Okay, fine.

8679
04:48:20,920 --> 04:48:21,300
Oh.

8680
04:48:21,340 --> 04:48:22,100
I got it.

8681
04:48:22,120 --> 04:48:22,640
I got it.

8682
04:48:22,660 --> 04:48:23,060
I got it.

8683
04:48:23,100 --> 04:48:23,240
I got it.

8684
04:48:23,240 --> 04:48:23,740
I fucking got it.

8685
04:48:23,880 --> 04:48:24,440
I got it.

8686
04:48:24,440 --> 04:48:24,800
I got it.

8687
04:48:24,900 --> 04:48:25,280
Okay.

8688
04:48:25,360 --> 04:48:25,760
I got it.

8689
04:48:25,780 --> 04:48:26,340
I got it.

8690
04:48:26,560 --> 04:48:27,120
Here you go.

8691
04:48:27,140 --> 04:48:27,340
Here you go.

8692
04:48:28,020 --> 04:48:28,400
Yeah.

8693
04:48:29,520 --> 04:48:30,000
Let's go.

8694
04:48:32,820 --> 04:48:33,200
21.

8695
04:48:33,860 --> 04:48:34,240
21.

8696
04:48:35,340 --> 04:48:36,100
Chicken dinner.

8697
04:48:36,100 --> 04:48:37,480
Can you do some for me?

8698
04:48:38,240 --> 04:48:38,980
Come on.

8699
04:48:39,160 --> 04:48:40,760
I need to know.

8700
04:48:40,760 --> 04:48:40,880
I need to know.

8701
04:48:40,880 --> 04:48:42,260
I need to know our registered pal.

8702
04:48:43,020 --> 04:48:43,520
Wait.

8703
04:48:43,640 --> 04:48:44,240
I'm gonna...

8704
04:48:44,240 --> 04:48:44,460
Wait.

8705
04:48:44,540 --> 04:48:45,000
I'm gonna show...

8706
04:48:45,000 --> 04:48:46,880
I'm gonna show chat how fucking clutch this is.

8707
04:48:48,300 --> 04:48:48,800
Wait.

8708
04:48:48,860 --> 04:48:49,360
Let me save...

8709
04:48:49,360 --> 04:48:49,500
Bro.

8710
04:48:49,500 --> 04:48:50,500
Let me save the actual video.

8711
04:48:50,560 --> 04:48:51,420
I'm just gonna save the video.

8712
04:48:51,540 --> 04:48:52,140
This is wild.

8713
04:48:52,560 --> 04:48:52,900
Bro.

8714
04:48:52,980 --> 04:49:00,020
We have more achievements than the two people who are 9th and 10th.

8715
04:49:00,160 --> 04:49:02,400
It's fucked up, man.

8716
04:49:02,500 --> 04:49:04,760
We just don't have enough pal registered.

8717
04:49:06,620 --> 04:49:07,120
No.

8718
04:49:07,940 --> 04:49:09,110
It's our pal registered.

8719
04:49:09,580 --> 04:49:10,860
We did so many pal registrations.

8720
04:49:10,880 --> 04:49:11,360
We did so many achievements.

8721
04:49:13,660 --> 04:49:14,100
Fuck.

8722
04:49:14,460 --> 04:49:15,440
I hit the button.

8723
04:49:15,640 --> 04:49:16,180
All right.

8724
04:49:16,280 --> 04:49:16,760
I'll show you.

8725
04:49:16,860 --> 04:49:17,540
All right, chat.

8726
04:49:17,680 --> 04:49:19,120
This is what we were working with.

8727
04:49:19,360 --> 04:49:20,100
It's cause...

8728
04:49:20,100 --> 04:49:20,800
Look at it.

8729
04:49:20,860 --> 04:49:21,580
It's right there.

8730
04:49:21,720 --> 04:49:26,100
Someone's like, I'm confused how the team is in 10th place and a heavy.

8731
04:49:26,120 --> 04:49:27,380
It's cause of pal registered.

8732
04:49:27,940 --> 04:49:29,780
It's actually pal registered.

8733
04:49:29,780 --> 04:49:29,800
Here it is.

8734
04:49:29,800 --> 04:49:29,980
Here it is.

8735
04:49:29,980 --> 04:49:30,240
Yes.

8736
04:49:30,240 --> 04:49:30,600
All right.

8737
04:49:30,600 --> 04:49:30,920
Watch.

8738
04:49:30,960 --> 04:49:31,180
Watch.

8739
04:49:31,200 --> 04:49:32,020
We're gonna see that 21.

8740
04:49:32,020 --> 04:49:32,260
Oh.

8741
04:49:32,360 --> 04:49:32,740
Oh.

8742
04:49:33,100 --> 04:49:33,800
Come on.

8743
04:49:33,820 --> 04:49:35,660
Take us to top 10.

8744
04:49:36,760 --> 04:49:37,420
There it is.

8745
04:49:37,420 --> 04:49:38,500
Come on.

8746
04:49:38,500 --> 04:49:38,840
There it is.

8747
04:49:38,920 --> 04:49:39,620
There's the 21.

8748
04:49:40,400 --> 04:49:40,880
Clutch.

8749
04:49:42,080 --> 04:49:42,780
Absolutely clutch.

8750
04:49:43,140 --> 04:49:43,960
Oh my God.

8751
04:49:43,980 --> 04:49:44,500
Come on.

8752
04:49:44,540 --> 04:49:44,860
Clutch.

8753
04:49:44,860 --> 04:49:46,600
Just change it.

8754
04:49:48,020 --> 04:49:48,780
Am I 10?

8755
04:49:48,920 --> 04:49:49,620
We're 10th again?

8756
04:49:49,720 --> 04:49:50,420
Are we 10th place again?

8757
04:49:50,440 --> 04:49:51,000
We're 10th.

8758
04:49:51,000 --> 04:49:51,460
We're 10th again?

8759
04:49:51,600 --> 04:49:52,040
Are we?

8760
04:49:52,040 --> 04:49:52,740
No, it's not.

8761
04:49:52,740 --> 04:49:54,200
I'm looking at the achievement list.

8762
04:49:55,660 --> 04:49:56,140
No.

8763
04:49:56,400 --> 04:49:56,940
We are.

8764
04:49:57,120 --> 04:49:58,060
We're 10th.

8765
04:49:58,920 --> 04:49:59,400
Yeah.

8766
04:50:04,240 --> 04:50:04,760
Let's go.

8767
04:50:05,100 --> 04:50:05,900
We did it.

8768
04:50:06,840 --> 04:50:08,400
We're in top 10.

8769
04:50:08,960 --> 04:50:09,440
We're in top 10.

8770
04:50:10,800 --> 04:50:11,280
We're in top 10.

8771
04:50:11,280 --> 04:50:11,680
Let's go.

8772
04:50:12,880 --> 04:50:14,420
Let's fucking go.

8773
04:50:14,600 --> 04:50:15,000
Finally.

8774
04:50:16,460 --> 04:50:17,420
Top 10.

8775
04:50:18,100 --> 04:50:20,420
We're better than six other teams.

8776
04:50:23,000 --> 04:50:23,480
Nice.

8777
04:50:23,680 --> 04:50:24,380
Oh my God.

8778
04:50:24,460 --> 04:50:24,940
Nice.

8779
04:50:25,140 --> 04:50:25,380
Okay.

8780
04:50:25,420 --> 04:50:25,700
I'm gonna...

8781
04:50:25,700 --> 04:50:26,180
We did it.

8782
04:50:26,400 --> 04:50:27,300
We did it.

8783
04:50:27,460 --> 04:50:27,820
We fucking did it.

8784
04:50:27,900 --> 04:50:28,100
GG.

8785
04:50:28,280 --> 04:50:28,700
I'm gonna...

8786
04:50:28,700 --> 04:50:28,960
Top 10.

8787
04:50:28,960 --> 04:50:29,780
Top 10.

8788
04:50:29,860 --> 04:50:30,360
Top 10.

8789
04:50:30,400 --> 04:50:30,880
Top 10.

8790
04:50:31,000 --> 04:50:31,720
Top 10.

8791
04:50:32,140 --> 04:50:38,880
I think the last 30 minutes, we should drop pals to each other so we can make sure we all have registered pals.

8792
04:50:39,460 --> 04:50:39,640
Yeah.

8793
04:50:39,640 --> 04:50:39,820
Yeah.

8794
04:50:39,880 --> 04:50:40,080
Yeah.

8795
04:50:40,100 --> 04:50:40,240
Yeah.

8796
04:50:40,240 --> 04:50:40,340
Yeah.

8797
04:50:40,340 --> 04:50:40,420
Mm-mm.

8798
04:50:40,460 --> 04:50:42,160
Well, wait a minute, I have a question though.

8799
04:50:42,200 --> 04:50:43,240
And maybe chat can answer this.

8800
04:50:43,360 --> 04:50:47,420
I'm pretty sure if you drop pals, does it register or does it not register?

8801
04:50:47,580 --> 04:50:48,940
Do you actually have to catch it?

8802
04:50:49,000 --> 04:50:49,260
No.

8803
04:50:49,260 --> 04:50:49,500
No.

8804
04:50:49,500 --> 04:50:51,900
You just get bonus for catching.

8805
04:50:52,200 --> 04:50:55,280
You just have to drop pals and then...

8806
04:50:56,000 --> 04:50:57,680
Wait, you can't register from dropping pals?

8807
04:50:57,800 --> 04:50:58,080
Really?

8808
04:50:59,080 --> 04:50:59,740
There's not...

8809
04:50:59,740 --> 04:51:00,160
Oh, no.

8810
04:51:00,200 --> 04:51:00,940
Okay, I got lied to.

8811
04:51:01,260 --> 04:51:02,480
I got one guy earlier.

8812
04:51:02,700 --> 04:51:03,740
Missed opportunity right there.

8813
04:51:03,940 --> 04:51:04,360
I got...

8814
04:51:04,360 --> 04:51:05,180
I got...

8815
04:51:05,620 --> 04:51:06,900
I got one guy earlier.

8816
04:51:07,420 --> 04:51:07,940
All right.

8817
04:51:07,940 --> 04:51:08,580
We have to...

8818
04:51:08,580 --> 04:51:09,440
We're 20th place.

8819
04:51:09,440 --> 04:51:10,880
Stop at the 11th again?

8820
04:51:11,160 --> 04:51:12,900
Who keeps... I refreshed it.

8821
04:51:13,120 --> 04:51:13,520
How?

8822
04:51:14,020 --> 04:51:15,280
Somebody forgot to log off.

8823
04:51:15,280 --> 04:51:15,520
Stop.

8824
04:51:15,960 --> 04:51:17,380
No, they're like fucking around.

8825
04:51:17,600 --> 04:51:19,400
They're fucking around right now.

8826
04:51:19,760 --> 04:51:21,420
They're like... ridiculous.

8827
04:51:22,520 --> 04:51:24,940
It's like every time you refresh, it's different.

8828
04:51:25,020 --> 04:51:25,860
I don't understand.

8829
04:51:27,120 --> 04:51:30,380
Every time you refresh, it's like the placement is changing.

8830
04:51:33,520 --> 04:51:36,020
The doc is being weird right now.

8831
04:51:36,020 --> 04:51:36,360
All done, thanks guys.

8832
04:51:36,480 --> 04:51:38,040
What do you mean all done, thanks guys?

8833
04:51:38,040 --> 04:51:38,880
What do you mean?

8834
04:51:39,180 --> 04:51:39,680
Stop it!

8835
04:51:40,020 --> 04:51:41,700
I don't understand.

8836
04:51:41,940 --> 04:51:43,580
Why does it keep changing?

8837
04:51:43,880 --> 04:51:45,260
It says we're top 10.

8838
04:51:47,720 --> 04:51:48,480
There's no way.

8839
04:51:48,480 --> 04:51:49,040
Are we top 10 anymore?

8840
04:51:49,340 --> 04:51:52,800
Oh my god, we were 20 points away from...

8841
04:51:52,800 --> 04:51:53,180
No!

8842
04:51:53,180 --> 04:51:55,240
From 9th place.

8843
04:51:56,280 --> 04:51:56,840
What?

8844
04:51:56,920 --> 04:51:59,360
We were 20 points away from 9th place.

8845
04:51:59,360 --> 04:51:59,480
What?

8846
04:51:59,520 --> 04:52:00,620
We're like 20 points away?

8847
04:52:00,860 --> 04:52:01,080
Yeah.

8848
04:52:01,800 --> 04:52:03,340
We were that close.

8849
04:52:04,800 --> 04:52:07,640
Dude, yeah, the registered pals really fucked us, didn't it?

8850
04:52:08,180 --> 04:52:08,660
Yeah.

8851
04:52:08,780 --> 04:52:09,560
You know what though?

8852
04:52:10,080 --> 04:52:11,580
We're still pretty high.

8853
04:52:11,780 --> 04:52:12,560
We're pretty high though.

8854
04:52:12,560 --> 04:52:13,760
We got so many achievements.

8855
04:52:14,480 --> 04:52:14,960
Yeah.

8856
04:52:15,380 --> 04:52:17,560
We did well despite struggling.

8857
04:52:17,780 --> 04:52:20,840
We had like the lowest amount of lucky pals though.

8858
04:52:20,920 --> 04:52:22,040
We just did not have luck.

8859
04:52:22,180 --> 04:52:24,900
I mean, I found that I was the only one that had lucky pals.

8860
04:52:25,000 --> 04:52:25,480
Yeah.

8861
04:52:26,260 --> 04:52:28,340
We're traveling far and wide, man.

8862
04:52:28,340 --> 04:52:29,380
They just don't show up.

8863
04:52:29,540 --> 04:52:30,620
No, what do you mean?

8864
04:52:30,700 --> 04:52:34,960
I literally went to a fast travel and it showed up right beside me.

8865
04:52:35,840 --> 04:52:37,220
It was like waiting for you.

8866
04:52:38,200 --> 04:52:40,200
Yeah, it says we're in 10th now again.

8867
04:52:40,380 --> 04:52:40,680
Yeah!

8868
04:52:40,720 --> 04:52:44,760
I'm on the actual one, not the viewer one.

8869
04:52:46,200 --> 04:52:48,600
It says we're 10 and it says they're done.

8870
04:52:48,740 --> 04:52:49,780
So I guess we're in 10th.

8871
04:52:49,960 --> 04:52:50,320
Yeah!

8872
04:52:50,460 --> 04:52:51,020
Top 10!

8873
04:52:51,160 --> 04:52:51,900
You know I take those.

8874
04:52:52,000 --> 04:52:52,800
I take top 10.

8875
04:52:52,980 --> 04:52:54,020
I take top 10.

8876
04:52:54,160 --> 04:52:54,820
Yeah, let's go.

8877
04:52:54,940 --> 04:52:55,560
Top 10.

8878
04:52:58,180 --> 04:52:58,780
GG's guys.

8879
04:52:58,920 --> 04:52:59,720
I had a great time.

8880
04:53:00,140 --> 04:53:00,260
Wait.

8881
04:53:00,260 --> 04:53:04,820
How does the team above us have 20 more points than us when they're registered pals?

8882
04:53:04,820 --> 04:53:05,220
I think our total is zero.

8883
04:53:05,560 --> 04:53:06,240
That must be a glitch.

8884
04:53:06,880 --> 04:53:08,680
They might have like... wait, you're right.

8885
04:53:09,080 --> 04:53:09,520
What?

8886
04:53:09,720 --> 04:53:10,160
Yeah.

8887
04:53:10,640 --> 04:53:11,080
What?

8888
04:53:11,600 --> 04:53:13,340
Honestly, maybe they call it the hard ones.

8889
04:53:13,520 --> 04:53:17,520
Like the... you know, like the pals at the bottom.

8890
04:53:18,660 --> 04:53:25,000
Wait, but doesn't that just mean that tomorrow they're gonna show their registered pals and then they're just gonna yeet themselves into first?

8891
04:53:25,080 --> 04:53:25,620
Sky and Rocket.

8892
04:53:25,820 --> 04:53:26,040
Yeah.

8893
04:53:26,240 --> 04:53:27,320
I don't fucking know.

8894
04:53:29,060 --> 04:53:29,500
Alright.

8895
04:53:30,780 --> 04:53:31,220
Alright.

8896
04:53:31,660 --> 04:53:32,320
GG's guys.

8897
04:53:32,520 --> 04:53:33,720
I'm gonna go talk to my chat.

8898
04:53:34,220 --> 04:53:34,660
GG's.

8899
04:53:34,820 --> 04:53:36,880
I had a great time from day one.

8900
04:53:37,840 --> 04:53:38,620
GG's everyone.

8901
04:53:38,720 --> 04:53:38,740
GG's.

8902
04:53:38,740 --> 04:53:38,740
Thanks.

8903
04:53:38,760 --> 04:53:39,420
See you guys tomorrow.

8904
04:53:39,780 --> 04:53:40,200
GG's.

8905
04:53:40,240 --> 04:53:40,820
See you guys tomorrow.

8906
04:53:41,220 --> 04:53:43,200
Those four hours passed by so fast.

8907
04:53:43,280 --> 04:53:44,420
Yeah, so fast.

8908
04:53:44,520 --> 04:53:45,200
So much fun.

8909
04:53:45,500 --> 04:53:45,760
Yeah.

8910
04:53:45,780 --> 04:53:46,160
Alright.

8911
04:53:46,240 --> 04:53:46,720
See ya.

8912
04:53:47,260 --> 04:53:47,780
See ya.

8913
04:53:47,960 --> 04:53:48,440
Bye.

8914
04:53:48,600 --> 04:53:48,980
Bye.

8915
04:53:51,080 --> 04:53:51,560
Alright.

8916
04:53:52,200 --> 04:53:52,680
Wow.

8917
04:53:52,920 --> 04:53:53,700
That was really fun.

8918
04:53:54,240 --> 04:53:55,960
I hope you guys had a great time.

8919
04:53:56,840 --> 04:54:01,020
I hope you guys had a great time with Shy Lily, Pee Pee, and Surefour.

8920
04:54:03,300 --> 04:54:03,780
Yeah.

8921
04:54:04,040 --> 04:54:04,800
Holy shit.

8922
04:54:04,800 --> 04:54:06,560
We were fucking gaming.

8923
04:54:07,280 --> 04:54:08,800
To be fair, we were a bit scum.

8924
04:54:08,840 --> 04:54:09,400
We had no plan.

8925
04:54:09,600 --> 04:54:09,840
Okay?

8926
04:54:09,920 --> 04:54:12,740
We had zero plan and we got top ten.

8927
04:54:13,180 --> 04:54:14,480
That's all that matters.

8928
04:54:18,940 --> 04:54:20,700
No plan, top ten.

8929
04:54:20,860 --> 04:54:21,820
Let's fucking go.

8930
04:54:24,260 --> 04:54:25,980
But it's thank you all for the subs.

8931
04:54:26,240 --> 04:54:27,460
Thank you all for the subs.

8932
04:54:27,720 --> 04:54:28,360
The gifted subs.

8933
04:54:29,840 --> 04:54:34,100
For following and all of that on Twitch.

8934
04:54:34,100 --> 04:54:35,240
Thank you guys so much.

8935
04:54:35,280 --> 04:54:35,760
And the biddies!

8936
04:54:36,240 --> 04:54:37,080
Thank you guys.

8937
04:54:37,640 --> 04:54:40,100
I had a great time with all of you.

8938
04:54:40,160 --> 04:54:41,600
I mean, we streamed for four hours.

8939
04:54:41,660 --> 04:54:42,280
Holy fuck.

8940
04:54:42,520 --> 04:54:44,380
Those four hours were intense.

8941
04:54:47,900 --> 04:54:49,640
But I'm gonna call it here.

8942
04:54:50,000 --> 04:54:52,820
Because I wanna make sure I have enough energy for tomorrow.

8943
04:54:53,220 --> 04:54:55,120
Because it's gonna be another four hour day.

8944
04:54:55,420 --> 04:54:56,540
But thank you everybody.

8945
04:54:57,020 --> 04:54:59,100
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

8946
04:54:59,360 --> 04:55:02,160
For those who are new here, I usually stream on the YouTubes.

8947
04:55:02,260 --> 04:55:04,080
So please check me out on YouTube.

8948
04:55:05,740 --> 04:55:07,800
I think like, exclamation point YouTube.

8949
04:55:08,100 --> 04:55:09,340
You can subscribe to me there.

8950
04:55:09,760 --> 04:55:12,580
Sometimes I stream Twitch stuff like today because it was Twitch Rivals.

8951
04:55:12,800 --> 04:55:16,460
And if you wanna get more updates on when I stream on Twitch.

8952
04:55:16,920 --> 04:55:19,520
Please check me out on Twitter.

8953
04:55:19,860 --> 04:55:21,860
I don't know if exclamation point Twitter works.

8954
04:55:22,180 --> 04:55:22,640
And merch!

8955
04:55:22,820 --> 04:55:23,120
Merch!

8956
04:55:23,140 --> 04:55:24,320
