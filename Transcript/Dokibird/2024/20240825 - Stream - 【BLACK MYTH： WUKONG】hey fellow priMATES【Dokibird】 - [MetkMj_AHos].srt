00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,550
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,070
Welcome back to MoreMonkey!

3
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,830
Yes, three monkeys this week.

4
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,890
I can't help it.

5
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,050
I actually have been enjoying Wukong a lot lately.

6
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:07,010
So like, I know like I usually do it like once a week, but then today's special... this week has been special!

7
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:13,670
It's been a very enjoyable game series so far and I heard it is very, very long in general.

8
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,030
I thought chapter two was long, but apparently chapter three is like times two longer than chapter two.

9
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:30,870
So yeah, I'm definitely not going to be finishing chapter three in one stream because I do have to do a convention stuff later tonight.

10
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,610
So I can't be too dead inside.

11
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,790
All right.

12
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,050
So, oh my God, I should have got coffee before the stream.

13
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,070
I was like debating.

14
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,630
I was like, oh my God, do I get coffee?

15
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,650
But I was like, no, no, I'm strong enough.

16
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,210
I am so much stronger than this.

17
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,470
I don't need coffee.

18
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,450
I am so much stronger than this.

19
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,830
I don't need extra substances to keep me going.

20
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,650
I was wrong.

21
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,650
I'm always wrong.

22
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,130
Instead, I have water.

23
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,810
I have no caffeine in my apartment at the moment.

24
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,170
I only have water.

25
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,810
I have water and iced tea.

26
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,630
And I don't think the iced tea is going to help me here.

27
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,510
Bite size.

28
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,570
Thank you for the acasupa.

29
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,110
Thank you.

30
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,710
Thank you.

31
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,850
It's time for more monkey business.

32
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,930
We're back.

33
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,050
We're back yet again with some more monkey business.

34
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,810
All right.

35
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,210
All right.

36
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,070
Life update.

37
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,150
Wait.

38
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,610
Fuck.

39
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,790
I should have wrote this down.

40
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,250
Okay.

41
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,510
What did I want to give you guys for life update?

42
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,670
Oh, fuck.

43
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:32,950
Okay.

44
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,410
Never mind.

45
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,070
No life update because I already forgot.

46
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,990
I already forgot what the life update was.

47
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,670
I was like, should I write this down before?

48
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,950
And I was like, no, I'll definitely remember it.

49
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,210
Oh my gosh.

50
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,870
I can't.

51
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,970
I forgot.

52
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,170
I was like, oh man, maybe I should write it.

53
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,630
I was like, no, no, it'll be fine.

54
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,270
I don't need to write it down.

55
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,150
Surely I'll remember what I wanted to talk about.

56
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,170
Surely.

57
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,270
I forgot.

58
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,670
I have no life.

59
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,970
That's the life update.

60
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,770
Oh my gosh.

61
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:10,970
I forgot.

62
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,870
I'm so mad.

63
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,090
That's the life update.

64
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,510
Oh, my gosh.

65
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,130
What was it?

66
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,090
God dammit.

67
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,470
It was on the tip of my tongue.

68
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,650
I was so excited to tell you about a life update.

69
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,370
But now do I even have a life?

70
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,450
Like do I?

71
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,210
Maybe I'll come back later.

72
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:28,810
Yeah.

73
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,830
Maybe I'll come back later.

74
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,770
Well, I talked about yesterday's convention.

75
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:51,890
When, like, majority of the games, because I haven't been touching Apex Legends for a while now, I think the last time I streamed it, whenever that was, was the last time I played Apex.

76
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,390
But then the rules were Wingman and Peacekeeper.

77
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,890
And, you know, I was like, Wingman and Peacekeeper.

78
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,710
I was like, those are two of the guns that I never use.

79
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:09,050
Like, I was like, oh, man, Wingman and Peacekeeper.

80
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:16,890
Those were, yeah, I was like, oh, man, especially with 150 ping, too.

81
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:23,810
I was not, not, you know, I was just like, definitely, this is not gonna be a good time for me.

82
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,890
I'm so fucking washed.

83
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:33,510
And I gotta use two of the most, two of the guns that I'm definitely not very well known for.

84
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,070
With 150 ping.

85
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,950
Peacekeeper, I actually haven't touched the Peacekeeper in, I think, a while now.

86
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,630
I think, like, more than four plus months now.

87
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:51,950
Because, like, why use a Peacekeeper when I could use, like, when usually people don't use short-range guns anymore in Apex.

88
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,870
We always use, like, long-range guns.

89
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,470
We use long-range and short mid-range.

90
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:02,050
So, because it's just more safe versus shotguns.

91
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,690
Shotguns are not safe at all.

92
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,590
So, like, I haven't used Peacekeeper in a very long time.

93
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,430
And I won every match.

94
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,950
I won every one.

95
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,510
I won every one.

96
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:18,210
I got a little bit toxic.

97
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,030
And just started punching people.

98
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,810
Because I was like, alright, I'm gonna get freebies.

99
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,550
I'm just gonna start punching instead.

100
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,710
And, um, yeah.

101
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,910
And they were like, please have mercy.

102
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,730
And I was like, no mercy.

103
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,610
I know you guys really wanna beat me.

104
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,470
So why should I give you guys mercy?

105
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,390
Uh.

106
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,070
Butchop, thank you for the super chat.

107
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,930
Thank you, thank you.

108
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,850
Hi, Toki.

109
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,970
I flew all the way to Malaysia to see you yesterday.

110
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,690
I'm watching you absolutely body.

111
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,810
50 plus dragoons was fun.

112
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,530
I'm still not sorry for calling you fu- Oh my god, that was you?!

113
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,090
Alright.

114
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,290
This fucker.

115
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,710
Thank you for the super chat.

116
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,550
Thank you, thank you.

117
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,170
Alright, so what happened was that, um, there was a Q&A session.

118
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:13,890
And then the MC was like, oh, hey, why don't we get that person with the boob- uh, not sorry, the Doki mouse pad.

119
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,870
And I was like, oh, oh, please don't tell me it's booba.

120
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,970
Like, don't tell me it's a booba mouse pad.

121
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,610
And then, so then he came up and then he was like, oh, don't worry.

122
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,290
You're, you're too flat for booba mouse pad.

123
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,790
So like, I'm going to fucking time you out right now.

124
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,110
Anyway.

125
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,800
Wow.

126
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,280
You show your face.

127
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,860
I fando stab you.

128
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:46,900
You show your face.

129
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:46,900
I fando stab you.

130
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,900
Oh, he is.

131
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,860
Is he?

132
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,080
Yes, he is.

133
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,620
He is wrong.

134
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,100
What do you mean?

135
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,860
Is he wrong though?

136
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
Yes, he is wrong.

137
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,300
There is a bump.

138
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,880
Okay.

139
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,940
There is a bump and he is wrong.

140
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,880
Anyway.

141
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,260
Uh, punishment done.

142
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,300
But it was really fun, honestly.

143
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:28,520
It was a nice ego boost, doing those Apex 1v1s, because I was not gonna lie, I was like, do I even warm up for this?

144
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,100
I was like, oh no, no, warming up isn't gonna help me.

145
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:42,340
I actually went in with zero warm up, and I was like, oh whatever, like, it'll make them happy when they win against me.

146
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,840
So, yeah, thanks for boosting my ego, Dragoons.

147
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,820
I really appreciate it.

148
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,760
It made me realize that, wow, I am a gamer.

149
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,440
I was like, damn, wow, maybe I am good at video games.

150
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,360
Oh my god.

151
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,980
Oh my god, I am the gamer of the year.

152
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,240
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

153
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,140
Thank you, thank you.

154
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,540
No, I am still washed.

155
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,900
I am still washed, but even when in my washed state, I'm still...

156
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:39,600
It's just gonna be, like, tomatoes.

157
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,380
If I ever have, like, a booba mouse pad, the booba part is just gonna be two big-ass tomatoes.

158
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,120
Anyway, uh, today we're gonna be continuing Wukong!

159
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm super excited to do more monkey.

160
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,960
I think next week I'm definitely gonna, uh, I'm just gonna say, like, my brain is still waking up.

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,700
I even took, like, a nap, too.

162
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,120
I took, like, a, uh, a 12 p.m.

163
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,080
nap because, uh, Dokian Burdoj, aka Dad, wakes me, wakes me up at, like, oh my god, okay.

164
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,240
He's such a little shit right now.

165
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,900
Um, uh, basically, um, like, he...

166
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,340
He... okay, I'm definitely... I don't know.

167
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:24,520
I'm definitely gonna, like, feed him a little bit less because today, this morning, he pooped three times.

168
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,480
And I was like, what's... what's going on with your body?

169
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,900
I was like, oh my god, what did I... am I... did I feed you too much?

170
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,460
I was like, no way, I feed you the same... I don't know.

171
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,800
I don't know what the fuck happened.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,500
I pooped three times.

173
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,060
So I was like, alright, it's diet time.

174
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,820
It's... it's...

175
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,900
And the worst part is that the first...

176
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,500
The first two times, it wasn't even outside... like, it wasn't even, like, on the grass.

177
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,920
It was like, um...

178
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,720
It was like... like, we were just walking on the sidewalk to the grass.

179
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,700
And, like, we literally took three steps.

180
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,480
We took three steps outside the... the lobby door.

181
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,180
And then he, like, he was like, it's crouching time.

182
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,920
I was like, why are you crouching?

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,520
Why... why are you... why are you...

184
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,460
I was like... I was like, wait.

185
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,120
Why are you... why are you crouching?

186
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
You don't do that!

187
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
You don't do...

188
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,520
I was like, what?

189
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,780
What do you mean it's crouching time?

190
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,440
He's got him on his new territory.

191
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,620
He accidentally... he accidentally pressed C on accident.

192
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,980
Yeah, just like the... just like the crow game.

193
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,440
He got a little too excited.

194
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,040
He got a little bit too excited there.

195
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,340
But, yes, he's definitely... I'm gonna be feeding him a little bit... not, like, a lot less.

196
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,400
Just a little bit less.

197
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,500
Because that concerned me.

198
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,160
I was like, three is a little bit too much.

199
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,580
Like, two... two, okay.

200
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,060
Maybe two... he... he just... his stomach is being a little extra quirky.

201
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,740
But three times, I was like, okay.

202
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,180
And they're not, like, you know, it's not, like, like...

203
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,040
Like, oh, maybe there's something...

204
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,620
Maybe he's sick.

205
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,760
I know he's not sick.

206
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,740
And I was like, that's not the right life update, by the way.

207
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,180
But I was just like, yeah, I'm just... you're gonna be eating a little bit less now.

208
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,640
He's gonna start complaini-

209
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
Oh my god.

210
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,520
But no, that wasn't the life... I wish I remember what my life update was.

211
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,780
I don't remember!

212
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,700
Oh, I hate it!

213
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,120
Do you... I...

214
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,860
I hate it when...

215
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,240
There's something you want to talk about and it's just there.

216
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,140
You can sort of remember it, but not really.

217
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,700
And it's like so annoying.

218
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,540
Ah!

219
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,020
Okay, okay.

220
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,540
Sorry, I just need to yell out my frustrations right there.

221
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,600
I just need to yell out my frustrations.

222
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,080
Hydration time.

223
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,640
Oh yeah, it's next week.

224
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,700
I will be taking a little bit of like...

225
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,560
I know I've been taking a lot of like breaks recently.

226
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,400
I really hate it, not gonna lie.

227
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,900
Because I feel like I'm losing momentum whenever I do do it.

228
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,900
But like a lot of my breaks haven't really been breaks, breaks, breaks.

229
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,460
And like the move has been... oh my god.

230
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,560
The move has been like a lot.

231
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,060
I know.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,120
I've stopped unpacking since I set up my work PC.

233
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,100
I've like stopped unpacking.

234
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,580
So I feel like I really do need to actually start unpacking stuff.

235
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,560
And like fully reset myself.

236
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,940
So like next week it might not be like an actual break, break.

237
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,360
But like there's definitely gonna be like a little bit less...

238
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,900
Like it's not gonna be the same amount of streams, you know?

239
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,060
Yeah.

240
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:21,200
So I might be doing like two to three streams and then the rest would just be like hibernation day.

241
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,560
So yeah, I just want to give you guys a little warning up ahead about that.

242
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,180
I wish I remember what my life update was.

243
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,060
What the fuck did I want to...

244
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,460
I just out!

245
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,360
I'll never remember!

246
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,860
There's like nothing...

247
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,500
There's not that much exciting stuff going on with my life at the moment.

248
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,220
So I'm like, how do I forget?

249
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,620
How the fuck do I forget?

250
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,580
There's nothing exciting going on.

251
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I'm literally just existing right now.

252
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,360
Like I'm chronically online.

253
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,580
But there was like something...

254
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,680
Oh yes, deadlock!

255
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,180
That's it!

256
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,460
Oh my god.

257
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
Thank you so much.

258
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,460
I wanted to talk about deadlock.

259
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,160
Sorry, I forgot.

260
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,420
The majority of my life updates relies on being online as well.

261
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:21,860
So...

262
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,520
Oh my god.

263
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,020
Alright, deadlock!

264
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,320
I can finally talk about deadlock.

265
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,840
I've been in the...

266
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,760
I've been in the...

267
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,300
The reason why I can't say anything about it was because I've been in the fucking beta...

268
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,440
What was it?

269
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,940
The alpha program since March slash April.

270
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,260
So like, I hate it.

271
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,080
I literally played less than five times.

272
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,920
I've been in it since like...

273
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,880
March, April.

274
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,080
And like, I played it less than five times.

275
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,820
Because it can...

276
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,060
I feel like...

277
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,580
Okay, the reason why I don't like it is...

278
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,200
No, it's not that it's bad.

279
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,060
It's that it's League of Legends.

280
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,300
It's literally...

281
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,460
I got tricked into playing League.

282
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,460
Like...

283
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,400
So if you like League, then you'll like deadlock.

284
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,100
But like, I got...

285
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,620
I don't like MOBAs.

286
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,360
So...

287
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,140
Yeah, it's basically a MOBA game.

288
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,060
But it's like a first person.

289
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,340
And like, the thing is...

290
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,300
Back in the early...

291
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,860
Because I was invited very early on.

292
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,160
I was invited super early on.

293
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,220
So not a lot of like... Because I know like now there's a lot of like actual like casual player base now.

294
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,480
But like, when I was invited to play it, it was mostly like content creators and like League players.

295
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,760
So like, I was fucking playing against Dyrus and Surefour.

296
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,160
Like, every time I like got on.

297
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,320
So I had not the best of times playing the game.

298
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,540
Because I was always playing against League players.

299
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,720
And then...

300
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,840
And then...

301
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,960
The thing is...

302
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,260
You can't stop playing.

303
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,300
It's literally a 30 to 40 minute game.

304
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,660
Actual League.

305
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,000
Actual fucking League.

306
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,240
I don't understand that reference.

307
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,420
Basically the people I was playing against were actual League players.

308
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,300
Who can aim.

309
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,480
So like...

310
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,760
So...

311
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,860
Yeah, so like you're stuck in the game for like 30 to 40 plus minutes.

312
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,740
And you can't forfeit.

313
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,680
There's no forfeit.

314
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,420
I don't know if they added forfeit now.

315
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,480
But like...

316
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
There's no forfeit.

317
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,340
Like the games are on average for like 40 plus minutes.

318
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,400
Just like actual... Just like regular League.

319
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,660
And... I don't know.

320
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,740
Maybe they added it now.

321
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,680
But like...

322
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,140
I did not have a good time.

323
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,840
As somebody that doesn't like League...

324
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,000
I did not have like a very good time.

325
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,800
But if you...

326
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,880
If you like League...

327
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
You can just CC.

328
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:17,720
Yes!

329
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,840
But when I was playing it, it was like mostly content creators and like high elo League of Legends players.

330
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,560
So like I couldn't just DC because they'll know who I am.

331
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,380
They're like...

332
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,520
They're...

333
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,760
They're people in the community.

334
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,080
So I don't know who I am.

335
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,920
So I couldn't just...

336
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,640
I couldn't just leave.

337
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,140
...

338
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,340
...

339
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,160
And...

340
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,640
And so...

341
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,200
Um...

342
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,860
So yes!

343
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,740
If you like League... That's what I'm saying.

344
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,680
Remember when I told you guys like I made that joke about like Who is this game?

345
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,320
Like I don't remember what game it was.

346
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,100
But it was another game that's similar to Deadlock.

347
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,800
We saw a trailer for it during during Gamescom.

348
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,100
And I was like who is this for?

349
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:25,880
I was like, there's not a lot of overlap because a lot of people that play FPS games don't really like to play League.

350
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,300
And a lot of people that play League don't really like to play FPS games.

351
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,960
So it's like such a small overlap of like...

352
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,840
It's such a small overlap of like people.

353
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,340
Like, I'm one of those.

354
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,780
I'm one of those FPS players that don't like MOBAs.

355
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,060
Because like, it hurts my brain.

356
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,840
I was like, it hurts my...

357
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,090
No, it's not Concord.

358
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,300
Concord is like the... it's like...

359
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,820
It looks like a fucking boring ass hero shooter.

360
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,930
It was just...

361
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,280
It was just...

362
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,820
Yes, but Pokemon.

363
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,280
Pokemon Unite is different.

364
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,860
It's like Baby League.

365
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,080
And I'm a baby.

366
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,940
I'm...

367
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,020
It's like...

368
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,000
It's like...

369
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,600
It's basically baby...

370
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,060
It's League for babies.

371
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,900
And like League for babies, I like...

372
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,140
It's a baby game.

373
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,260
And like at least I get to beat up children.

374
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,500
And it's so easy to learn.

375
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,860
But like, I don't know.

376
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,060
I think like if you like League...

377
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,780
If you like FPS games, you won't like Deadlock.

378
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,000
But if you like...

379
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,480
Oh, sorry.

380
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,620
If you like shooters in general...

381
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,240
If you like shooters in general...

382
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,280
I don't know if you'll like Deadlock.

383
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,660
But if you like League, you'll really like Deadlock.

384
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,040
Because I...

385
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,680
I couldn't...

386
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
I couldn't like it.

387
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,920
I...

388
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,260
Because like, I know some people are like, Oh, are you going to stream Deadlock?

389
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,480
I'm just like, I already tried.

390
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,780
I already tried to like it during Alpha.

391
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,140
During the...

392
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,920
I don't know, the...

393
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,880
Whatever the test...

394
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,920
It wasn't even called Deadlock when I got in.

395
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't even remember what the old name was.

396
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,820
It was...

397
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,940
I don't even remember what it was called.

398
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,620
It was like...

399
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,280
There was...

400
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,460
It had a different name other than Deadlock.

401
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,620
But like, if you like League, you'll like Deadlock.

402
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,500
But like, I don't like League.

403
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,960
And I don't like MOBAs.

404
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,580
So like, I couldn't like Deadlock.

405
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,500
I was just like, it's...

406
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,140
I was like, oh my god, I can't.

407
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,520
I don't know.

408
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,700
.

409
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:34,800
.

410
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,120
I was just...

411
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,940
Oh man, I couldn't.

412
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,560
I couldn't.

413
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,480
I just couldn't.

414
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,080
I tried my best to try to like it.

415
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,800
But I was just like, I can't force myself.

416
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,660
I can't force myself to like this game.

417
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,400
I...

418
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,980
To be fair, people are just surprised that Valve made video games again.

419
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,100
Because they don't have to.

420
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,760
They literally can just live off Steam money.

421
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,480
So like, everybody was just surprised.

422
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,820
That, you know, Valve actually made a game.

423
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,880
Because they literally did not have to do that.

424
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,460
Like, they could just live off making money off of Steam for the rest of their life.

425
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:16,980
.

426
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,900
So that's like, good for them.

427
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,340
You know?

428
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,140
Good for them.

429
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
They tried something.

430
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,420
I honestly, I don't know.

431
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,620
I don't know if the game is going to actually...

432
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,140
I don't know.

433
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,400
The game is obviously not made for me.

434
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,580
Like, you know, because I have different tastes and stuff.

435
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,540
Like, we're not...

436
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:39,900
I'm not...

437
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,760
Like, you know, people are not supposed to like everything.

438
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,040
If you like everything.

439
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,900
Like, every single game you've ever played.

440
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,780
Or like, not every single game that ever came out.

441
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,080
Then like...

442
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,360
Good for you, I guess.

443
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,260
Then...

444
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,480
Good for you.

445
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,680
You're a happier person than the rest of us.

446
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,360
At that point, you've like achieved true happiness.

447
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,380
If you like everything.

448
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,960
But like, I know what my tastes and preferences are when it comes to video games.

449
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,980
And that...

450
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,960
Definitely not that.

451
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,060
Deadlock was definitely not it for me.

452
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,640
Anyway.

453
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,940
Anyway, it's time for Monkey.

454
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,920
That was the life update I wanted to give you guys.

455
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,080
That was it.

456
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:31,980
Honestly.

457
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,080
Alright, continue the journey!

458
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,860
We're back to being a monkey!

459
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,480
Yeah, bro achieved true enlightenment.

460
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,990
Alright, here we go.

461
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,290
I wonder if we'll meet the rest of Wukong's old gang.

462
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,350
Because we didn't meet like any of the...

463
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,610
I mean, we met like...

464
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,550
Okay, no, that's not true.

465
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,710
I was thinking like, have we met any of Wukong's like old buddies yet?

466
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,450
I feel like we haven't.

467
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,890
We've only seen them in like cutscenes.

468
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,130
And like in like...

469
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,650
In like...

470
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,290
Like we met the priest.

471
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,770
Like in...

472
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,150
Not like meet me, but like we saw him in a cinematic.

473
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,590
Hmm.

474
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,210
Magic, thank you for the super chat.

475
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,890
Thank you, thank you.

476
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,390
I just like to suffer, I guess.

477
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,410
Alright.

478
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,750
Where do we go?

479
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,530
Oh my gosh, I don't even know where I came from.

480
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,870
Oh my gosh, I don't even know where I came from.

481
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,630
I mean, this map is...

482
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,270
Will make me as equally lost.

483
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,170
Oh, what's this?

484
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,110
Everybody's rocks.

485
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,190
What?

486
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,910
I hope the graphics a lot better though, too.

487
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,610
Oh my God, it's stuttering.

488
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,750
Maybe it's too good.

489
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,950
Okay, no, not anymore.

490
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,750
I was gonna say, do you have to lower the graphics?

491
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,990
Why did that stutter there?

492
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,640
Oh, hey, snow monkey.

493
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,520
Hey.

494
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,940
Monkey?

495
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,180
Say monkey?

496
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,480
Oh.

497
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,960
Wait.

498
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,700
Wait, what?

499
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,620
Wait, what did...

500
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,100
What did monkey not...

501
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,380
Oh!

502
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,540
Monkey, I thought we were friends.

503
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,580
Monkey, why monkey not friends?

504
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,140
I thought we were...

505
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,840
Say monkey.

506
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,780
Okay, new lesser yoga.

507
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,180
Wisdom...

508
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,580
Okay, it's a frozen corpse.

509
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:47,680
Okay.

510
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,140
Let's say that this...

511
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,180
Why aren't we friends?

512
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,680
You're a monkey.

513
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,720
I'm monkey.

514
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,940
All the gods hate us.

515
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,040
Like, we should be good friends after that.

516
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,320
Yeah, apes together.

517
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,980
Not all monkeys are friends.

518
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,080
But the whole world hates us.

519
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,660
Why can't we be friends?

520
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,040
Why can't we be friends?

521
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,680
Why can't we be friends?

522
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,960
Oh, is everything stuttering?

523
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,940
Oh my god, my life right now.

524
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,540
Let's see why.

525
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,440
Oh my god!

526
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,300
Okay, this is a little bit of a concern.

527
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,780
I don't know how, but we've managed to hit 98% memory.

528
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,780
I... Ow!

529
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,540
Do I have a memory leak?!

530
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,500
Do I... How did I hit a mem... Oh my god.

531
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,240
Wait, did I restart my PC before?

532
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,280
Okay, guys.

533
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,300
That is an issue.

534
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,000
That is an actual issue.

535
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,920
How the fuck did I hit 98%?!

536
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,820
Holy shit!

537
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,840
Holy fuck, okay.

538
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,480
Alright, we got it.

539
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,220
I gotta close some... Let me close some... Maybe if I close some tabs?

540
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,200
Question mark!

541
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,760
I don't even have that many tabs open!

542
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,340
How is that possible?!

543
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,120
Oh, hey.

544
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,340
Oh yeah, I was looking up Connect the Crow.

545
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,140
So, do you guys remember when I was talking about...

546
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,400
When I was talking about that crow that was, like, terrorizing people?

547
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,040
So, like, it was the same... And the crow with the knife?

548
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,260
It was the same crow.

549
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,700
It was literally the same crow.

550
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
The crow with the knife?

551
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,680
So, apparently...

552
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,220
Apparently, this crow... His name was Connect the Crow.

553
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,580
And he used to own... He had, like... He owned the streets, basically.

554
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,440
So, like, mail... The post office...

555
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,960
Canada Post had to suspend mail deliveries for a specific street.

556
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,420
Because, like, the crow was attacking mailmen.

557
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,740
So, they're like, sorry, we can't deliver to your street anymore because there's a crow that's terrorizing everybody.

558
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,860
I thought that was just...

559
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,660
Oh, fuck.

560
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,440
Fucking funny.

561
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,640
I was like, it was one crow.

562
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,720
It was one crow.

563
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,820
And, like, they're like...

564
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,760
They actually suspended mail delivery for that street.

565
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,280
For three different streets.

566
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,960
I was like, that's so fucked.

567
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,880
Imagine living at that street.

568
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,860
And you're just like, we can't deliver your mail because this crow is trying to take our mailmen's money.

569
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,440
It was...

570
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,500
He was also the same crow with the knife.

571
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,120
By the way.

572
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,840
It was literally the same crow.

573
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,060
I was...

574
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,100
I was very surprised to find out it was the same fucking crow.

575
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,100
Alright, let's see.

576
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,500
I did close some tabs.

577
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,700
Is it better now?

578
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,940
Are you...

579
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,300
Are you feeling a little...

580
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,980
Shh, PC.

581
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,280
Are you feeling better, PC?

582
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,560
Softly caresses the PC.

583
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,440
Are you...

584
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,640
Are you doing okay?

585
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,260
Okay.

586
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,480
Let's see if this helps it.

587
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,120
I deleted a few tabs.

588
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,300
Alright.

589
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,420
I deleted the...

590
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,680
I deleted the connector crow tab because I was reading up on it.

591
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,580
Alright.

592
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,620
Alright, that feels a lot better.

593
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,700
Now that I'm not at, like, you know...

594
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,460
A hundred.

595
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,680
Oh!

596
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,780
Fake.

597
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,620
Oh shit!

598
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,780
Wait, why is he so strong?

599
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,580
Why am I so weak?

600
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,400
Alright.

601
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,700
Maybe we gotta upgrade our staff.

602
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,140
I heard that there's a dragon we have to beat up to get staff updates.

603
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,780
Alright, let's make sure there's nobody here.

604
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,340
Oh fuck, I fucking knew it.

605
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,520
I fucking knew it.

606
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,340
Alright.

607
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,200
Oh, wait.

608
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,600
You too?

609
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,520
You're supposed to be frozen!

610
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,100
If you move, you're not actually frozen!

611
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,180
What's that word called when, like, it's not what...

612
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,780
It's advertised.

613
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,760
False advertisement!

614
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,460
This is false advertisement right now.

615
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,140
Question.

616
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,200
Why your channel name is Doki Bird?

617
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,900
I'm curious.

618
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,320
Thank you for the super chat, Daniel.

619
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,740
Thank you.

620
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,300
Thank you.

621
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,280
Because I'm a bird.

622
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,960
That goes Doki Doki.

623
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,380
Alright.

624
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,160
Let's see.

625
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh no!

626
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,300
Wait!

627
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,140
I have a better answer.

628
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,320
Scratch what I just said.

629
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,820
Because I'm a bird that makes you go Doki Doki.

630
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:32,980
Wink.

631
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,280
Alright.

632
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,960
Oh, I never even offered the incense.

633
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,860
Oh, wait.

634
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,160
I did.

635
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:43,820
Alright.

636
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,260
Nice.

637
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,100
That's right.

638
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,100
So smooth.

639
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,820
So fucking smooth.

640
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,120
Alright.

641
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,600
60.

642
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,380
This is the weapon I have, right?

643
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:56,940
Yeah.

644
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
That's the weapon I'm using.

645
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,500
This one's 70.

646
00:30:59,520 --> 00:30:59,800
Okay.

647
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,920
So...

648
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,820
Alright.

649
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,420
We gotta go kill the dragon to get this one.

650
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,120
Uh...

651
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,000
Where is it?

652
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Where's the secret?

653
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,500
So smooth.

654
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,880
Alright.

655
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,540
Where's the secret for...

656
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,720
Uh...

657
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,620
For that dragon?

658
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,160
Uh...

659
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,120
It has to be...

660
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,100
It's the mountains, right?

661
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,040
Yeah.

662
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,500
But where?

663
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,720
God dammit!

664
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:29,780
Oh!

665
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,080
Damn!

666
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,580
Damn!

667
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,680
Thank you for the super chat.

668
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,080
Thank you.

669
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,700
Thank you.

670
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,040
Alright.

671
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,620
Black wind.

672
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,740
Black wind.

673
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,540
And then where?

674
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,720
Cave.

675
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,200
Interior.

676
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,920
Outside.

677
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,480
Peak.

678
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,300
Waterfall?

679
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,980
Where the fuck is the waterfall?

680
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,460
There's no waterfall here.

681
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,260
Outside?

682
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
Outside the cave?

683
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,780
Is this?

684
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,160
Remember the snake guy?

685
00:31:59,440 --> 00:31:59,640
No.

686
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,780
He was pretty forgettable, though.

687
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,620
Okay.

688
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,980
It's with the baby?

689
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,040
Wait.

690
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,500
This baby?

691
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,720
Outside of the forest?

692
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,640
Oh my god.

693
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,660
Where did I kill the baby?

694
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,800
I...

695
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,080
I...

696
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,800
I don't remember.

697
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,660
I don't remember!

698
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,680
I don't even...

699
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,140
Guys.

700
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,000
Guys.

701
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,540
I don't rem...

702
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:17,820
It's...

703
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,800
It's been 20 years since I've killed that baby.

704
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,740
It's been...

705
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,020
20 years.

706
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,020
I...

707
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,240
I...

708
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,500
What is it called?

709
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,900
Is it the forest hills?

710
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,200
Is it outside?

711
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:29,480
Oh!

712
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:29,740
It's outside!

713
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,200
It's the baby!

714
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,940
I see him!

715
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,180
It's okay.

716
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,760
I found him.

717
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,920
I saw the baby.

718
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,340
It's okay, guys.

719
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,000
I found him.

720
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,960
It's over for him.

721
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,620
The baby.

722
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,800
Well, you never get to grow up to be an adult.

723
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,460
It's a little...

724
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:46,640
God.

725
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,300
A little dark there.

726
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:47,800
Whoa.

727
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,520
Mistakes.

728
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,260
Thank you for the super chat.

729
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:52,600
Thank you.

730
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,120
Thank you.

731
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,920
I bought this game because of you.

732
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,120
Here's your commission, I guess.

733
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,980
Thank you for the super chat.

734
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,320
Thank you.

735
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,920
Thank you.

736
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:58,820
Okay.

737
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,280
I saw my...

738
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,780
Got my Aspie from that baby.

739
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,620
And you're like, I don't care.

740
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,400
I got my Aspie too.

741
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,440
All right.

742
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,200
All right.

743
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,340
How strong am I now to these guys?

744
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,040
Boom!

745
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,640
What?

746
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,240
It takes me two hits.

747
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,320
My staff is plus 60.

748
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,480
How does it take two hits?

749
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,060
All right.

750
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,720
Where is it?

751
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,800
To the left, right?

752
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,000
Someone mentioned it's to the left.

753
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,740
Oh!

754
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,300
That waterfall!

755
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:28,900
Okay.

756
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,320
I see it.

757
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,760
Oh.

758
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,360
It's the pole guy!

759
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:31,600
All right.

760
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,720
Alright, nice.

761
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,380
Goodbye.

762
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,720
I have to kill the crow again!

763
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,980
Oh wait, I killed him.

764
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,560
Alright, examine.

765
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,780
Fuck water!

766
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,700
No more waterfalls in this town.

767
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,940
Oh, is he talking about the boss I'm going to fight?

768
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,240
Alright, first boss today.

769
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,720
I'm so dead.

770
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,120
I don't think...

771
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,560
I don't think I'm ready to fight him.

772
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,720
But let's do it.

773
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,340
I'm going to make sure I have everything I need.

774
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,260
Okay, I have big baby.

775
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,160
I have my staff.

776
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
I have...

777
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,860
Do I have the items I want for this?

778
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,240
Okay, reduce his cooldown.

779
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,480
Okay.

780
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,800
I just want to be sure.

781
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,440
I want to be sure I have everything I need.

782
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,380
Alright, and these are all the items I'm not using.

783
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,720
These are everything I'm not using.

784
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,200
Okay.

785
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Alright, gotta make sure.

786
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,820
Alright, here we go.

787
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,960
Alright, time to beat up another dragon.

788
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,700
You know, I'm really surprised.

789
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,580
Like, how...

790
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,640
What's the word?

791
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:01,720
Like...

792
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,460
There's not a lot of loading screens, you know?

793
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
For this game.

794
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,040
And like...

795
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,220
It's usually like one loading screen per chapter.

796
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,480
There's so much stuff going on with one area.

797
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,620
That's so nice.

798
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,280
Alright.

799
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,740
It's going to be another dragon, right?

800
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,820
Whoa!

801
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,800
Oh!

802
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,880
Red dragon!

803
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:31,800
That's so long.

804
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,660
You're not red, you're blue.

805
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,720
You're mostly blue.

806
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,740
That's like...

807
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,620
a lie.

808
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,980
How are you red?

809
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,300
Oh, I forgot how to use power-ups.

810
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,260
No!

811
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,190
I didn't say it.

812
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,330
I forgot.

813
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:58,690
I...

814
00:35:59,290 --> 00:35:59,890
I...

815
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,790
I said it.

816
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,870
Wait, he killed all the monkeys?

817
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,930
What the fuck was the point?

818
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,990
I already used up all of it.

819
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,330
Oh no, you're not dead.

820
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,370
Okay, thank god.

821
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,970
Okay, I assume I have to hit this.

822
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,410
Okay, me and my one monkey that's not dead.

823
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,310
Oh my god.

824
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:21,490
Okay.

825
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,570
Alright.

826
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,830
One monkey survived somehow.

827
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,070
Holy fuck.

828
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,570
That's actually bullshit.

829
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,050
Oh my god.

830
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:41,710
I can't believe all the monkeys died except for that one monkey.

831
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,290
What?

832
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,290
That's not fair.

833
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,790
All my monkeys died except for that one monkey.

834
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,730
That is actually not fair.

835
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:51,710
That is...

836
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,970
Like, what's the point?

837
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,770
Oh shit!

838
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,390
Okay.

839
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,510
What's the point of using that monkey power?

840
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,790
Oh, please!

841
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,510
Please.

842
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,210
I'm just a little monkey.

843
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,030
Alright.

844
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:11,970
Come on.

845
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,230
Get over here.

846
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,270
Come on!

847
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,410
Fuck!

848
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,770
Did I hit him?

849
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,470
Oh, I did.

850
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,070
Okay.

851
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,050
Thank god I did.

852
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,230
Thank god I did.

853
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,730
Oh my god.

854
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,430
I don't know what I'm doing.

855
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,810
I don't know what I'm doing.

856
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,190
Oh.

857
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,450
When do you use that?

858
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:30,850
Alright.

859
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:32,850
You know what?

860
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,790
I like your brother more.

861
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,650
At least he had some sick ass jams.

862
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,010
His music was better.

863
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:38,650
Yeah, that's right.

864
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,150
I said it.

865
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,330
He had better taste in music than you.

866
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:41,990
That's right.

867
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,750
I fucking said it.

868
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,910
Your music tastes as good as your brother.

869
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,570
That's fucking right.

870
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,290
Bam!

871
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,950
That's why you're easier to kill.

872
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,590
Haha.

873
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,410
I'm joking.

874
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:57,930
That's fucked.

875
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,970
You can't just roast his music choices.

876
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,790
First try.

877
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,450
Dist and destroy.

878
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,490
Okay.

879
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:21,650
My fucking little monkeys got so fucked up there.

880
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,230
Alright.

881
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,270
Oh, long pearl.

882
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,390
What else did I get?

883
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,670
I got the thunder tail.

884
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,550
What else?

885
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,430
I got the censor, so now I can never curse again.

886
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,470
Alright.

887
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,250
How do I get out of this area?

888
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,110
Where's the exit?

889
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,230
Oh my god.

890
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,310
I wasn't supposed to beat him in first try.

891
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,610
And I don't know where the exit is.

892
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,170
How do I leave?

893
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,510
Is it up here?

894
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,510
Is it?

895
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,710
Is it?

896
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,750
Away from the tree.

897
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,350
Okay.

898
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,130
It's up here.

899
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,370
I don't know.

900
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,150
I didn't die, so I don't know where to go.

901
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,630
Is this it?

902
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,550
Oh, there it is.

903
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,250
The tiny hole.

904
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,310
Alright.

905
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:13,810
Okay.

906
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,070
I think I'm good to go.

907
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,230
I mean, the way I came.

908
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,290
I went through the hole and I got into a cutscene.

909
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,390
And then they transported me into the fight.

910
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,350
Hahaha.

911
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:23,610
Hahaha.

912
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,090
That's true.

913
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,570
The true boss is navigation.

914
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,070
This is why... This is what I don't like about Souls games.

915
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,790
But like, that's on me though.

916
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,290
It's not because the game's bad.

917
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,990
It's because I'm directionally challenged.

918
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,150
Like, it's not the game's fault.

919
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,170
I'm just really bad at read...

920
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,670
Like, really bad at maps.

921
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,790
Or like, not maps, but navigation.

922
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,410
I'm so directionally challenged.

923
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,370
Okay.

924
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,290
No maps.

925
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,370
Only west.

926
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,070
Like, right now, I'm like, where the fuck did I...

927
00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:01,090
Where... Where is the... Where is the... Where's the... The shrine?

928
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,950
And you guys are gonna be like, Oh my god, Doki.

929
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,830
Just use the... No!

930
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,990
I will not use the fucking...

931
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,470
Use that thing to bring me back.

932
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,170
I can do this myself.

933
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,950
I don't need no help.

934
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,610
Hahaha.

935
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,150
I don't need extra help.

936
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,390
I don't need to teleport.

937
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,030
I'm a strong independent bird.

938
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,270
What can I make now?

939
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,870
The back scratcher?

940
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:27,930
What?

941
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:29,690
Wait!

942
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,890
Is it one time use?

943
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,620
Is this like... Is this a consumable?

944
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,420
It says...

945
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,280
It doesn't say hug.

946
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,400
Guys, my back's scratchy.

947
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,980
I love... I used to love these.

948
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,700
It's an equipment?

949
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,160
Oh!

950
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,580
Okay.

951
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,000
Okay, I don't need that then.

952
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,480
I craft.

953
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,640
Can I craft that?

954
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,840
The strong stuff now?

955
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,880
I can.

956
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,700
I just... Okay, maybe there's gold.

957
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,880
Do I have gold?

958
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,800
Uh... Stores...

959
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,480
It's an accessory.

960
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,320
Oh, yes I do.

961
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,300
Nice.

962
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,680
I knew grave robbing was not a mistake.

963
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,600
Hahaha.

964
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,160
Alright, craft weapons.

965
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,240
Can I craft it now?

966
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,240
No!

967
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,680
It's still... Oh wait, that's...

968
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,960
I still don't have enough will.

969
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,220
But what if...

970
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,440
What if I... But... Oh no.

971
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,640
They won't let me sell anything.

972
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,740
Alright, it's time to farm.

973
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,460
How much do I need to farm again?

974
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,240
Alright, I'm gonna beat up some of the lesser wolves here.

975
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,220
Get over here.

976
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,660
I need 500 will.

977
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,320
Get over here.

978
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,980
It's your lucky day.

979
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,400
Just like the apex goons.

980
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,300
It's your lucky day.

981
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,340
Okay, plus 81.

982
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:47,880
Okay!

983
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,720
Uh...

984
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,600
Alright.

985
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,820
Where are all these...

986
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,720
Where are all these wolves?

987
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,080
They won the lottery!

988
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,480
They won the lottery!

989
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,820
But where are they?

990
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,420
I was gonna say, did all of them run away because they know?

991
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,220
Hahaha!

992
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,860
They're like, oh no.

993
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,040
Oh no, she's coming.

994
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,420
Alright, plus 25.

995
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,940
You don't give that much though.

996
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,780
You don't really give that much.

997
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,500
How about you?

998
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,460
How much do you give?

999
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,660
Plus 32.

1000
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,980
Alright, plus 29.

1001
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,080
Oh wait, I'm looking at experience.

1002
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,180
Okay, plus 28.

1003
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,180
Okay.

1004
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,780
God, I need to find a place that has like...

1005
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,520
What's the best place to farm will?

1006
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,320
Do these give will?

1007
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,060
No.

1008
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,380
They see my bloodlust.

1009
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,700
I need to find like a place to farm will.

1010
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,340
I need to farm.

1011
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,740
I need to farm some guise.

1012
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,260
Maybe in chapter 3.

1013
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,380
Maybe I could.

1014
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah, you're right.

1015
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,820
Alright.

1016
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,620
Oh, 28.

1017
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,040
Oh, they gave me gold!

1018
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,040
God!

1019
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:08,420
I love it when they kindly gave me gold and not because I killed them.

1020
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,180
Alright, nice.

1021
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,700
More will.

1022
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,960
Okay, there should be...

1023
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,380
How much more do I need now?

1024
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,180
Must not be that much, right?

1025
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,060
Must not be that much, right?

1026
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,600
Oh, 300!

1027
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,200
Or less than 300.

1028
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,780
Alright, travel, new west.

1029
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,480
Alright.

1030
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,820
The frost guise might give me more.

1031
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,540
204.

1032
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,200
Yeah.

1033
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,840
I might as well go to the...

1034
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,360
I need to be in the snow area anyway.

1035
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,000
So like, I might as well.

1036
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,500
Alright.

1037
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,060
I don't know why that's a TikTok meme.

1038
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,040
I don't know why that's a TikTok meme.

1039
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,600
I saw it or like YouTube shorts meme.

1040
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,160
I don't know if you guys saw it but it was like a bunch of family members being like Give me your money.

1041
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,780
And then they're all like, yay, like, give me your money.

1042
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,860
I don't understand.

1043
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,320
Am I just getting old?

1044
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,600
It's like a new...

1045
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:23,560
It's like a new fucking Gen Alpha YouTube's shorts slash TikTok meme.

1046
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,700
And what's my algorithm?

1047
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,620
It's called being a fucking normie.

1048
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,980
That's somehow...

1049
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,620
Somehow like...

1050
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,180
Somehow always online.

1051
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,280
It's a mistake.

1052
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,760
My algorithm, it's a fucking mistake.

1053
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,800
That's what...

1054
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:51,340
To be fair, like, Gen Alpha memes are like super surreal now.

1055
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,280
Like, humor has evolved into...

1056
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:01,820
I feel like the older we get, the more surreal the humor has become.

1057
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:10,260
Like, I know back then, our fucking humor was like, eee, and then it was like Markiplier's face.

1058
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,900
But like, I don't know how we managed to get even more surreal than that.

1059
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,440
Like...

1060
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:22,380
You can't be like, oh, but like, back in my day, our humor was so...

1061
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,880
Our humor was so much better.

1062
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,040
We literally thought E was the funniest shit ever.

1063
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,240
Like, every...

1064
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,760
Every gen has its like, fucked up face.

1065
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:31,300
Okay?

1066
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,440
I still need...

1067
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,040
Oh, prerequisites required?

1068
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,540
Oh, I have to craft...

1069
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,000
No!

1070
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,480
I need to craft prerequisites!

1071
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,380
We gotta craft this then.

1072
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,540
So we can unlock that.

1073
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,080
And then now I...

1074
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,640
God damn it!

1075
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,500
I didn't craft it.

1076
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,600
I forgot there's prerequisites.

1077
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,500
Our humor was superior.

1078
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,900
We all had...

1079
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,820
We all had our phases.

1080
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,840
Back to chapter 3.

1081
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,540
Back to Suffer, we go.

1082
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,400
From 200 to 2700.

1083
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,200
Let's go.

1084
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,100
I like how you can sorta tell where the which one's the enemy.

1085
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,460
Because you literally just have to lock in.

1086
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:25,900
Boop!

1087
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,200
Alright.

1088
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,280
Alright, nice.

1089
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:32,860
Oh wait, what?

1090
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,300
Oh yeah, they had to move a little bit before too.

1091
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,800
Hello!

1092
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,580
Just lock it in.

1093
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,820
Yeah, it's that easy.

1094
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,840
Just lock it in.

1095
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,140
Oh, what the fuck!

1096
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,080
Okay, I keep forgetting they move after.

1097
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,220
After they die.

1098
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,980
Oh!

1099
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,940
Did somebody cry?

1100
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,420
Why are you crying?

1101
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,980
You're not allowed to cry.

1102
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,980
Oh, the chief?

1103
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,300
Why is that we're friends?

1104
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,540
What happened to apes together in Strang?

1105
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,340
Was that all a lie?

1106
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,260
Planet of the Apes lied to me!

1107
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,400
I can't believe it!

1108
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,760
But what happened to Planet of the Apes?

1109
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,740
Big attack.

1110
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,420
Oh shit.

1111
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,300
Big attack.

1112
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:21,500
Big attack.

1113
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,600
Oh, Firestrike gets ice!

1114
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,800
That's what Pokemon taught me!

1115
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,220
There we go.

1116
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,500
Oh shit.

1117
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,600
Why can't I have a sword?

1118
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,020
Like, I know like...

1119
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,440
Yeah, like, Shroomhong uses a staff, but like...

1120
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,180
Why can't we just give him a gun?

1121
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,380
Imagine Shroomhong with a gun.

1122
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,040
That's some...

1123
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,700
Fucking Zhaoxing CA.

1124
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,020
Hey, hey, hey.

1125
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,430
Save it, man.

1126
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,230
Oh, why are you laughing at me?

1127
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,750
I defeated you!

1128
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:03,450
Alright.

1129
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,330
All I'm saying is that...

1130
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,650
I feel like if we give him a gun, it would elevate his character.

1131
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,330
It would...

1132
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,110
It would...

1133
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:16,970
Yeah, like, I know!

1134
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:17,790
I know!

1135
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,890
Wukong is bulletproof, but like...

1136
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:20,950
Not the other guys!

1137
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,810
The other guys aren't bulletproof!

1138
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,790
Miracle, thank you for the super chat.

1139
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:27,830
Thank you, thank you.

1140
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,250
Journey to the west.

1141
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,670
I mean, we're heading west anyway!

1142
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,090
Like...

1143
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,090
Gun Wukong.

1144
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,650
Journey to the wild, wild west.

1145
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,830
Oh, hello bat.

1146
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,350
I mean, you're a willpower bat.

1147
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,330
Oh shit.

1148
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,290
You can't just stab me with your pitchfork.

1149
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,190
What's this?

1150
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,110
What about...

1151
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:55,210
What about if the gun was attached to the staff?

1152
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,510
And every time he does a thrust, the gun will just go pew pew.

1153
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,110
I just think it's very true to his character.

1154
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,770
If he just suddenly pulls out a gun.

1155
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,850
Like, it won't hurt the gods, but like...

1156
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,450
What if it's a magic gun?

1157
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,130
Technically the staff...

1158
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,590
Like, a normal staff doesn't do jack shit.

1159
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:25,470
A normal staff doesn't jack shit to gods, but my staff is a magic staff.

1160
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,650
So like...

1161
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,630
So like, we just enchant it with the power of the gods.

1162
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:32,550
You know?

1163
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:40,190
We enchant the gun with the power of the gods.

1164
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:47,570
And then the bullet can kill... can kill any guy at that point.

1165
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,570
I'm just talking... I'm just saying real sense here.

1166
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,370
Alright, let's see.

1167
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,510
Cannot awaken.

1168
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,130
Focus for each successful light attack.

1169
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,630
Increases the damage dealt.

1170
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,310
I feel like I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get the health thing.

1171
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:09,790
The elemental bullet!

1172
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:10,230
Yes!

1173
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,830
Imagine having elemental bullets!

1174
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:14,790
Imagine!

1175
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,270
If you're...

1176
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:19,650
If you can have elemental bullets!

1177
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,770
That shit would be...

1178
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,490
That shit would be so strong!

1179
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,110
Just think about it!

1180
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,210
It would be so strong!

1181
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,310
You challenge... will increase the charging speed of all stances.

1182
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,610
Heavy attack that causes additional damage to the enemy.

1183
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,410
Based on... Ooh!

1184
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,450
Wait, that's good.

1185
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,710
Alright.

1186
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,150
Maybe modify a statuette's stun at a rate of 2,000 pokes per minute.

1187
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,470
That would be more sensible for it.

1188
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,870
Yeah, but bullet's stronger!

1189
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,870
If it had the power of the gods, it would be stronger!

1190
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,330
Like, and no fall-off damage too!

1191
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,110
That makes it even better.

1192
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,750
There would be no fall-off damage.

1193
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,010
What the fuck are you?

1194
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,490
Oh my god!

1195
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,430
What are you?

1196
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:16,950
What the fuck?!

1197
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:17,270
Okay.

1198
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,530
Dude, fuck this.

1199
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:19,950
You know I'm gonna cast a...

1200
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,230
Oh, I can't cast a baby.

1201
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,510
I can't even cast a baby.

1202
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,510
What is that?

1203
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,790
That shit guy was so strong.

1204
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,690
It's a patroller.

1205
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,970
With a hideous face and a... Damn!

1206
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:31,570
Okay.

1207
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,230
I didn't think he was that ugly, but okay.

1208
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,670
Like, drawing him ugly doesn't make him actually ugly.

1209
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,470
That's so fucked!

1210
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,150
I thought he wasn't that ugly!

1211
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:48,130
But then he's like, with a hideous face and a crooked blade and suede.

1212
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,830
I thought he looked like a normal guy.

1213
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:57,250
The journal has some beef with him.

1214
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:57,470
Yeah!

1215
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,710
It's not... And like, he purposely drew him so ugly too.

1216
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,170
To like, accentuate his point.

1217
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:07,470
Poke!

1218
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,190
Alright.

1219
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,230
Get him out of here.

1220
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,030
Oh, nice.

1221
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,090
He doesn't do the little swingy thing too after.

1222
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:15,590
Alright.

1223
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,950
This one's also... Oh!

1224
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:18,390
Alright.

1225
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,330
I don't have baby to help me though.

1226
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,910
So this might be a little scary.

1227
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:25,530
Oh, wait.

1228
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:25,730
What?

1229
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:26,990
Why am I doing my heavy attack?

1230
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:29,570
This is not fair!

1231
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,210
He has so many helpers!

1232
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:32,650
What?!

1233
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,150
It's the ugly guy!

1234
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:38,510
Oh, shit.

1235
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:38,930
That's...

1236
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:39,910
That's not good.

1237
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:40,670
That's not good.

1238
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,850
Hey, if you're gonna break...

1239
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:43,850
Okay.

1240
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,310
Okay.

1241
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,450
I accidentally activated all of them.

1242
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:49,410
That's okay.

1243
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,170
That's fine.

1244
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:52,510
We're fine.

1245
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:53,270
We're so fine.

1246
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,450
We are stuck.

1247
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:56,930
We're so fine.

1248
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:58,850
Okay.

1249
00:52:58,910 --> 00:52:59,230
It's fine.

1250
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,230
Alright.

1251
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:03,070
Back we go.

1252
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:04,730
Okay.

1253
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,190
Nope.

1254
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:05,710
Nope.

1255
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:06,770
Back we go.

1256
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:07,050
Please.

1257
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:07,790
Please.

1258
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:08,190
I'm stuck.

1259
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:09,990
I'm stuck.

1260
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,110
Alright.

1261
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:14,290
Okay.

1262
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,230
Do I have enough magic?

1263
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:15,630
I do.

1264
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,010
Okay.

1265
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:16,330
Nice.

1266
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:17,730
Poke.

1267
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:19,210
Oh.

1268
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:19,930
Not poke.

1269
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:21,690
Okay.

1270
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:22,770
Come on.

1271
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:24,230
Nice.

1272
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,070
Alright.

1273
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:29,510
And...

1274
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:30,810
Big poke!

1275
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,890
That's fucking right.

1276
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,670
Give me your essence I'll never use because I have big baby!

1277
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,530
Profile picture versus IRL.

1278
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1279
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,090
Thank you.

1280
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:43,490
Thank you.

1281
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,110
Give the monkey a gun!

1282
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,310
That should be the next DLC.

1283
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,210
Give Xiumhong a gun.

1284
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,710
I want a modern rendition of Journey to the West.

1285
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,630
But like in-game.

1286
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:58,770
Not movies though.

1287
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:03,970
If the movie was made by Zhao Xingqi, then I think it would be pretty funny.

1288
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:04,810
I would...

1289
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:14,530
I feel like if we get a modern Journey to the West movie from Zhao Xingqi then like I think it'd be really funny.

1290
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:20,450
Alright.

1291
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,170
Journey to the West side.

1292
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:33,010
I miss peak movies.

1293
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,610
But what's his English name again?

1294
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,770
I think his Chinese name.

1295
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,270
But I always forget what his English name is.

1296
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,430
But like I don't think he's had like a good film in a long time.

1297
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,930
Stephen Chow.

1298
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,190
Yeah.

1299
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:47,530
Yeah.

1300
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,030
I feel like... I don't know.

1301
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:55,510
I feel like the last good movie for me... I watched his The Mermaid movie he did.

1302
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,550
I didn't like it that much.

1303
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,910
But to be fair he... I don't think he...

1304
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:58,770
Did he acted in it?

1305
00:54:58,890 --> 00:54:59,490
No I don't think so.

1306
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:10,990
I'm trying to like remember when was the last Stephen Chow... like his most recent Stephen Chow movie that he made that I liked.

1307
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,550
And I think like the last one was like... was it the Alien one?

1308
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:15,250
The CJ7?

1309
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,110
Oh that shit was sad too.

1310
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,290
It was funny and sad.

1311
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,950
Kung Fu Hustle one was the best.

1312
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,630
I think the amount of times I've watched Kung Fu Hustle.

1313
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,250
And um...

1314
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,370
The Shaolin Soccer.

1315
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:30,210
Oh.

1316
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,240
Let's see...

1317
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,520
This way...

1318
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,040
For those who don't know who Stephen Chow is...

1319
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,700
Um... He is like...

1320
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,200
One of the best...

1321
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:48,980
Back then one of the best Hong Kong comedy actors and directors back in the day.

1322
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,200
I mean he's still really well known.

1323
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,140
But like...

1324
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,720
His movies are not as good as it was before.

1325
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,760
I will admit.

1326
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,040
Yeah he's like legendary.

1327
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,700
Yeah I saw the Mermaid one in theaters.

1328
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,020
And I was so confused.

1329
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:07,600
Alright.

1330
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,240
Oh this cave is not there?

1331
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,800
There's so many invisible walls.

1332
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,410
I think my favorite Stephen Chow movies are his Journey to the West ones.

1333
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,490
And um...

1334
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:27,530
I feel like if anybody can make a really good modern comedy Journey to the West, it would be Stephen Chow.

1335
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,110
But like I don't know if he'll...

1336
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,550
Unless he gets a lot... Like I feel like he doesn't do much cause like...

1337
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,930
Cause he's like at the retirement age.

1338
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:36,810
Where... Also like...

1339
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,010
Okay there was this whole thing.

1340
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:39,490
I don't know if it's true.

1341
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:40,690
But...

1342
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,330
He used to do... Okay so he was like basically...

1343
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,250
It might be like a bit insulting to say.

1344
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,590
But he was very like Adam Sandler.

1345
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:51,690
Where he would always cast the same people in the role.

1346
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:54,190
Like he would always cast all his friends.

1347
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:55,510
In...

1348
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,010
In movies.

1349
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,570
So like...

1350
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,710
Uh... So like...

1351
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,050
In every movie, it would be the same people.

1352
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,850
Because it was like Adam Sandler where all his friends would be in the same...

1353
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:07,910
In the same movie.

1354
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:08,410
Like...

1355
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,090
Would always be in the movie.

1356
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,530
And he would do that too.

1357
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,710
But like...

1358
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,890
There was this one actor that I really liked.

1359
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,510
What was this?

1360
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,730
I read my fortune.

1361
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:36,770
That's fucked.

1362
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,450
When do I die?

1363
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,990
Oh my god.

1364
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:41,370
It's him.

1365
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:43,690
Oh my god.

1366
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:43,690
It's him.

1367
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:44,410
Oh my god.

1368
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:44,410
It's him.

1369
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:58,210
Oh my god.

1370
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:58,830
I'm a bat.

1371
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,690
This is like the same thing.

1372
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,330
Oh that gives me too much power.

1373
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:05,370
Where am I flying?

1374
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,070
Where am I flying to?

1375
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:10,550
Where am I flying to?

1376
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:11,350
Where am I flying to?

1377
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:13,870
Why can't I be a bird?

1378
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:14,650
Why can't I be a bird?

1379
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:14,830
Why can't I be a bird?

1380
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,740
But yeah, what I was saying.

1381
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,480
There was this one actor I really liked in his...

1382
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,520
In Steven Child's movies.

1383
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,600
Because they worked...

1384
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,360
Their chemistry was really, really good.

1385
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,560
And then at one point, he stopped appearing in his movies.

1386
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:34,600
Because apparently back then, the rumors was that they had an argument or something.

1387
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,180
Like they got into a really big fight.

1388
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,680
So he stopped appearing in his movies.

1389
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,040
And they were so good together too.

1390
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,660
Was it Uncle Tat?

1391
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,640
I think so.

1392
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,540
I forgot his name.

1393
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,740
Yeah, they had a huge falling out.

1394
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,780
And then they they were like the...

1395
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:56,960
They had really, really good movie chemistry together.

1396
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,800
Really?

1397
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,420
Oh my god.

1398
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,340
I'm gonna steal stuff.

1399
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,960
I got permission from the human chicken thing.

1400
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,920
That's enough permission for me.

1401
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,500
If a human chicken thing says I can steal it.

1402
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,400
Then like, it's not morally wrong.

1403
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,660
He seems like a very trustworthy guy.

1404
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,380
Alright, let's see.

1405
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,620
Do I have anything to sell?

1406
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,660
Oh, I can sell all this.

1407
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,400
Okay, nice.

1408
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,740
I don't have enough money to make new outfits though.

1409
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,300
I'm like so...

1410
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,460
I'm so fucking poor right now.

1411
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,480
That's why I'm stealing stuff.

1412
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,220
Alright.

1413
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,980
Landmarks are snow, snow, and snow.

1414
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,120
I wonder which way do I go.

1415
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,280
It's a lot of snow.

1416
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,080
Alright.

1417
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:18,950
I also can tell that these guys are not alive because they don't have a...

1418
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:23,870
It's like, alright, if I didn't lock in, it's like, which one is the guy that's gonna try and kill me?

1419
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:28,650
The one over there who's just trying to dance?

1420
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:32,130
That guy over there that's clearly not holding any weapons.

1421
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:34,870
Or this guy with a giant ass fucking...

1422
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,310
sword in front of me.

1423
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:41,630
Alright.

1424
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:42,450
Oh, shit.

1425
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:42,790
Sorry.

1426
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:44,710
I was gonna poke you, but I stopped holding.

1427
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:45,450
Right click.

1428
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:47,310
Alright.

1429
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,610
Same wolf here.

1430
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,110
Also, they're all in the same pose.

1431
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:50,950
I just realized that.

1432
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,610
I just realized.

1433
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,530
They're all in the same pose.

1434
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,030
There's also that too.

1435
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,930
Alright, let's get rid of him.

1436
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:00,810
I need that item.

1437
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,410
I'm gonna steal the chicken...

1438
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:05,910
That chicken man said it's okay.

1439
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,790
He gave me permission to steal.

1440
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:11,990
Alright.

1441
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:14,890
Open up!

1442
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:15,350
Open up!

1443
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:18,930
Uh, Kara!

1444
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,690
Thank you for your very first Super Chat!

1445
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:21,050
Thank you!

1446
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:21,670
Thank you!

1447
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:22,210
Whoa!

1448
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:24,350
Oh my god!

1449
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:24,830
Thank god!

1450
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,190
Cutscene buff!

1451
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,290
Invincible frames!

1452
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:31,810
Thank god.

1453
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,510
Wait, was that supposed to be an ambush?

1454
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:39,410
It's not really an ambush when the chests, like, make sure I don't die when I'm picking stuff up.

1455
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:40,850
Oh my god!

1456
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:41,610
It's time to meditate!

1457
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,010
It's time to meditate, guys.

1458
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,750
Why can't they give Wukong a gun?

1459
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,210
That's all I ask.

1460
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,110
That's it.

1461
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,210
I've been watching to you live for five minutes.

1462
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,590
I noticed you have an adorable voice.

1463
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,090
Thank you!

1464
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,290
Thank you for the very first Super Chat!

1465
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:13,730
I hope you enjoy being a dragon for the rest of your life.

1466
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,250
For his side special, he holds a gun.

1467
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,310
Oh my god!

1468
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,870
What if we have, like, give him a fucking shotgun?

1469
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,090
Oh my god!

1470
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,350
Give Wukong a shotgun!

1471
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,590
Don't be cowards!

1472
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:53,950
If I saw my staff, it should be able to become a shotgun.

1473
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,090
Can't be like, that's not accurate.

1474
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,610
I'm literally a fucking magic monkey!

1475
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,610
Nothing is already accurate!

1476
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:11,350
I'm literally a fucking magic monkey!

1477
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:16,870
Nothing is already accurate!

1478
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,270
Oh!

1479
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,130
It still remembers my smell?

1480
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,050
Sorry, I haven't taken a bath.

1481
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,190
I'm roleplaying, by the way.

1482
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,890
As the monkey, it's been a while since I took a bath.

1483
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,950
I almost can't fit in.

1484
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:41,330
Is that a money bag?

1485
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:42,070
Is that a money bag?

1486
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:43,070
Are you an evil baby?

1487
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,710
Are you an evil baby?

1488
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:49,230
Come out and help me try on his clothes.

1489
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,790
Oh my god, another dragon?

1490
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:55,870
Oh my god, another dragon?

1491
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,290
Is it enough?

1492
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,770
I have a lot of money!

1493
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,020
I have a lot of money!

1494
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:06,760
How many dragons do I have to kill today?

1495
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:07,020
How many dragons do I have to kill today?

1496
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,680
I'm gonna make sure they're all extinct.

1497
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,560
I'm gonna make sure they're all extinct.

1498
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,720
He didn't seem so evil.

1499
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,560
He seems like a happy Buddha.

1500
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:16,260
He seems like a happy Buddha.

1501
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,140
This fight was annoying.

1502
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,420
Oh my god, he summoned Blue Eyes White Dragon.

1503
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,440
Oh my god, he summoned Blue Eyes White Dragon.

1504
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,600
I didn't even get the rest!

1505
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,760
Oh god, I don't know the pattern.

1506
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,220
Okay, big baby.

1507
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,100
Please don't miss.

1508
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,460
That's all I ask.

1509
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,960
Oh yeah, that's right.

1510
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:34,640
Smack that!

1511
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,600
Smack that!

1512
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:36,760
Oh!

1513
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,280
Okay, he smacked me.

1514
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,420
How do I even hit that?

1515
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:40,740
Okay.

1516
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,320
Fire vs.

1517
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:42,660
Ice!

1518
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,320
I missed!

1519
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,260
Fire vs.

1520
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:45,720
Ice!

1521
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:47,700
It's fine.

1522
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,720
Oh, it's so fine.

1523
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,420
It's so fine.

1524
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,580
Does this hurt?

1525
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:53,040
No.

1526
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,340
It's just a sail.

1527
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:55,600
Boom!

1528
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,580
That's fucking right.

1529
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,420
Get down!

1530
01:04:59,360 --> 01:04:59,880
Boom!

1531
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,300
Who said this fight was annoying?

1532
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,920
This fight is so fucking easy!

1533
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,640
Because I'm a gamer!

1534
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,280
Oh shit.

1535
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:08,880
I lied.

1536
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,200
I lied.

1537
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:09,720
I'm so sorry.

1538
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:10,260
I'm so sorry.

1539
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,160
I didn't mean that.

1540
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,280
I think you're a very respectable dragon.

1541
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,860
Oh my god, what is he trying to do?

1542
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:16,880
Oh!

1543
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,280
Oh!

1544
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:17,880
Where am I?

1545
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,060
Oh no!

1546
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:21,660
Oh god!

1547
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,240
Okay, it's fine.

1548
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,120
It's fine.

1549
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,620
He'll get down, right?

1550
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,900
He'll have to get down, right?

1551
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,060
I can't see!

1552
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,440
I can't see!

1553
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:33,820
No!

1554
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:39,230
Okay, I have to...

1555
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:40,250
I have to unlock.

1556
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:42,210
Alright.

1557
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:44,770
Okay.

1558
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:47,030
I don't like how I have to heal a lot there.

1559
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,030
Oh, come on!

1560
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:49,470
Get down!

1561
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:50,190
Oh shit!

1562
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,690
Not right now!

1563
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:52,850
But not right now though!

1564
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,150
Not right now!

1565
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:54,890
I didn't...

1566
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:58,390
I didn't mean that!

1567
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,650
That was a lie!

1568
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,010
Oh my god.

1569
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:03,630
Are you serious?

1570
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,710
Are you serious?

1571
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:06,670
How does that not hit?

1572
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:09,890
This is bullshit!

1573
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:15,210
What part of the body can I fucking hit?

1574
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:17,810
Oh, the head.

1575
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,130
Okay, that makes more sense actually.

1576
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,570
Oh no!

1577
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:22,790
Oh no!

1578
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:23,950
Wukong, get up!

1579
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,230
Wukong!

1580
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:25,690
Get up!

1581
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:27,810
It's just ice!

1582
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:28,650
Oh shit!

1583
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:31,490
Oh...

1584
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,190
Oh no, he stunned me too.

1585
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:37,830
Okay, this guy is hard.

1586
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:38,770
Never mind, you're right.

1587
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,270
This guy is very...

1588
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:40,610
What?

1589
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:47,750
How do you live that?

1590
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:48,470
How do you live that?

1591
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:51,590
Okay, that was bullshit.

1592
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,690
That's actually bullshit.

1593
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:54,730
Like, I...

1594
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,330
I don't know how to hit him!

1595
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:57,910
I don't know how to hit him!

1596
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:01,570
Please!

1597
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,230
Let me speed dress!

1598
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,630
Let me speed dress!

1599
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,810
Oh no!

1600
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:08,830
Oh no!

1601
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,350
Oh no!

1602
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:14,430
How do I fucking kill him?

1603
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:15,750
How do I fucking kill him?

1604
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:18,290
There's so much of him!

1605
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:18,910
There's so much of him!

1606
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,730
But it's like...

1607
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:21,670
There's so...

1608
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,010
There's so much of him, but like...

1609
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,810
Where do I look at?

1610
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:29,630
If I had a gun, I could have just shot him down.

1611
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:31,090
That's all I'm saying.

1612
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,030
Guys, if I had...

1613
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:35,030
If I had...

1614
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,310
If I could have...

1615
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:41,430
If I could have...

1616
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:42,690
I could have shot him down!

1617
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:43,990
I hate it!

1618
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,630
That's literally all I needed!

1619
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:51,070
The gun DLC!

1620
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:52,130
The gun DLC!

1621
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:53,750
The gun DLC!

1622
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:57,330
I'll even take a bow at this point!

1623
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:57,670
I'll even take a bow at this point!

1624
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:00,490
A bow is basically a prehistoric gun!

1625
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:00,810
A bow is basically a prehistoric gun!

1626
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,970
It's the same thing!

1627
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,470
It's a prehistoric gun!

1628
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,410
Alright, we have...

1629
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:14,850
Alright, we got the... we got the... we got the stick.

1630
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:17,050
We got a taller stick now.

1631
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:21,030
Dodge like a cicada and sting like a monkey.

1632
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,470
God, thank you for the super chat.

1633
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:23,210
Thank you, thank you.

1634
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:27,390
Alright...

1635
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,950
No, Dottie, no!

1636
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,430
Oh no, I'm a little worried.

1637
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:39,630
Dottie's super chat is making me worried right now.

1638
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:41,010
Get closer!

1639
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,590
Why are you running away?

1640
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:45,530
Oh my...

1641
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:47,050
Okay, fuck you.

1642
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,690
Actually, fuck you.

1643
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:54,150
This shit just killed me.

1644
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,630
There's no point.

1645
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:58,870
There's no point.

1646
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,030
Restart.

1647
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,050
We're restarting.

1648
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:04,010
We're restarting this fight.

1649
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:09,630
Alright.

1650
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,910
You learned all the pretty crabs.

1651
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:15,610
We're gonna take in this right now.

1652
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,070
Alright, here we go.

1653
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,610
I'm coming back.

1654
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,130
Alright, this time... this time I'm serious.

1655
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,830
This time...

1656
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,930
This time I'm actually serious.

1657
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:30,690
I'm serious now.

1658
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:33,290
I'm not fucking around this time.

1659
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:37,410
Alright.

1660
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,290
Get down!

1661
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,230
For real!

1662
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:40,230
This time.

1663
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:43,310
Alright.

1664
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,630
I'm not fucking around now.

1665
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:45,330
Alright.

1666
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:46,030
We're good.

1667
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,610
We're just gonna take a while to travel there, but it'll be worth it.

1668
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:50,650
Because I could be Big Baby.

1669
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,450
That's all I want.

1670
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:55,930
I just wanna do...

1671
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,050
Big Baby!

1672
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:57,630
Oh shit!

1673
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:58,710
Okay, that's fine.

1674
01:09:58,710 --> 01:09:59,470
I have...

1675
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,610
Enough HP for this.

1676
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,350
Okay, I'm just gonna use the light attack.

1677
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:05,750
That's fucking right.

1678
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,050
That's fucking right!

1679
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:09,870
Alright.

1680
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:12,510
Okay, we gotta be patient.

1681
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:15,530
Now...

1682
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:16,170
Oh no, fuck!

1683
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:17,450
Okay, that was not what I wanted to do.

1684
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:18,970
Now we gotta be patient.

1685
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,050
Okay.

1686
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,090
Missed the grab.

1687
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,030
Okay.

1688
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:24,650
I think that's his head.

1689
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,310
Okay, that is.

1690
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,370
Alright.

1691
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,930
That's fucking right.

1692
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:30,250
Down from here.

1693
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,150
That's right.

1694
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,410
The sky is not for you, dragon!

1695
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,670
The sky is owned by me!

1696
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,210
And the land too!

1697
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:38,990
Oh...

1698
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:41,330
I own the land and the sky!

1699
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:42,610
That's right!

1700
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:44,250
I own everything!

1701
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:46,170
Cause I'm fucking...

1702
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:46,230
Oh!

1703
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:47,150
I'm sorry!

1704
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:47,930
You could have the sky.

1705
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,650
You could have the sky.

1706
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:50,810
I was just joking.

1707
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,790
You could...

1708
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,550
You could have the sky.

1709
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:55,890
I'm sorry.

1710
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:55,930
I'm sorry.

1711
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:56,830
I'll...

1712
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:57,750
I'll just take the ground.

1713
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,290
The ground's not so bad.

1714
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:02,470
The ground is not as bad as I thought.

1715
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:04,350
The sky denied.

1716
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:07,250
Alright.

1717
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:08,850
Does it need a backup?

1718
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:10,670
Is that a backup?

1719
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:13,410
It'll come down for me, right?

1720
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,630
Alright, nice.

1721
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,750
Alright, maybe he'll...

1722
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,010
Ah, no.

1723
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,230
I fucked it up.

1724
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:23,550
That's fucking right!

1725
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:24,050
JK!

1726
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:25,630
Okay, I don't fuck up.

1727
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:26,710
It was fake.

1728
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:29,350
I gave you a false sense of security there.

1729
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,050
That's fucking right.

1730
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:32,750
Now I'm gonna get high.

1731
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:37,550
All right, never mind.

1732
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:40,550
Okay, nice.

1733
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:43,470
Nice smack you in the head.

1734
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:45,150
It's fucking right.

1735
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,350
Oh, what?

1736
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,050
That's not fair!

1737
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,830
That's right, I'll smack you in the tail too.

1738
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:58,230
No part of your body is safe from the smacks.

1739
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:00,030
Oh, god.

1740
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:02,570
Oh my god, please.

1741
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:03,970
Oh, please.

1742
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:07,670
Please!

1743
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:10,970
How do you have so much square feet but get none at all?

1744
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,830
It's so absolutely bullshit.

1745
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:22,270
There's like so much of this body, but yet I can't paint anything.

1746
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,630
Will you ever get down?

1747
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:33,990
Oh, okay.

1748
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:34,630
Thank you.

1749
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,490
That's really all I asked.

1750
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:40,070
All right, ask and you shall receive.

1751
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:43,810
Smack!

1752
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:50,150
Big pot, small... like, that should not be legal.

1753
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:52,290
That should not be legal.

1754
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,420
Oh, we did it.

1755
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,460
We fucking did it.

1756
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,080
Wait, what's going on?

1757
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,280
What?

1758
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,140
入了此番轮回,就别想再轻易涅槃。

1759
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:22,220
入了此番轮回 ,就别想再轻易涅槃。

1760
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:22,380
入了此番轮回 ,就别想再轻易涅槃。

1761
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:26,920
You have wings?

1762
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:29,060
Wait, you're not the same monkey!

1763
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:40,980
No wonder you didn't want to be friends!

1764
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,340
He's not a natural monkey!

1765
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,160
Fake monkey!

1766
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:52,310
How the fuck did I get here?

1767
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,850
Wait, I got trapped?

1768
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:01,090
But I can't go to jail!

1769
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,970
Who's gonna pay my bill?

1770
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:05,090
这回来的...

1771
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:06,110
I can't go to jail!

1772
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:06,110
Who's gonna pay my bill?

1773
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:08,730
Please, I'm too poor for bill!

1774
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,850
Oh, okay, never mind.

1775
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:19,430
No cage can hold this monkey!

1776
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:23,750
All right, easiest prison break of my life, I guess.

1777
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:25,970
这股子骚味。

1778
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:27,570
Who's this?

1779
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:28,930
可真是熟悉。

1780
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,750
新来的,我劝你老实待着。

1781
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:34,070
干啥?

1782
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:36,090
这地是...

1783
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:36,730
Just kick the door.

1784
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:38,210
打开门门。

1785
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,910
No monkey cage, only monkey.

1786
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:41,790
只有一只猪猫。

1787
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:46,590
Not a very... Why does he, why does he get a better cage than me?

1788
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,290
I should be a bigger threat.

1789
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:50,470
I'm insulted that...

1790
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:52,150
哈哈哈哈。

1791
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,030
I'm insulted that they didn't give me a better cage.

1792
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:58,910
哈哈哈哈。

1793
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:03,530
I should be a bigger threat.

1794
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,730
哈哈哈哈。

1795
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:06,090
哈哈哈哈。

1796
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:07,710
想走就走的。

1797
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,590
Why did they make it so easy?

1798
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:12,070
They underestimated me!

1799
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:14,430
都没个好下场。

1800
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:16,530
这...

1801
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:18,570
Welcome to the Buddha's realm?

1802
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:19,350
这...

1803
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,330
Why does the Buddha hate me?

1804
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,370
这...

1805
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,430
Could it be all the murdering?

1806
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:25,930
No, no, no, no, it can't be the murdering.

1807
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:26,790
这...

1808
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:30,130
There's apparently an incense here.

1809
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,910
这...

1810
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:32,550
This entire section was made for M's.

1811
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,690
What do you mean by that, Buri?

1812
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:35,210
No!

1813
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:36,870
哈哈哈哈。

1814
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,830
Oh no...

1815
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,470
Is this a maze?

1816
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,530
哦,不听他。

1817
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,280
Oh no, is this why he doesn't want to leave?

1818
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:46,960
这...

1819
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,720
Oh my god.

1820
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,220
会说不...

1821
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,940
Go back to my cage.

1822
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:55,820
不听善言。

1823
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,660
一声...

1824
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,860
Oh no...

1825
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:02,340
Is this a maze?

1826
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,400
IS THIS A MAZE?!

1827
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,460
哈哈哈哈。

1828
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,360
哈哈哈哈。

1829
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,640
No...

1830
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,040
NO!

1831
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,530
I get it.

1832
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:20,070
I get it.

1833
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:21,170
哈哈哈哈。

1834
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,350
It's not a maze.

1835
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,510
It's something much worse.

1836
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,930
哈哈哈哈。

1837
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:30,590
It's gravity.

1838
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:32,910
哈哈哈哈。

1839
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,870
It's actually gravity.

1840
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:38,010
哈哈哈哈。

1841
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:40,450
This place is actually the worst.

1842
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:43,110
There's never one experience in again.

1843
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,930
Sour, thank you for the super chat.

1844
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:46,410
Thank you.

1845
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:49,390
I don't understand.

1846
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:53,230
All the fucking maps before then.

1847
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,510
They had invisible walls.

1848
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:58,470
How could they just remove that?

1849
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:03,490
How could they just suddenly remove the invisible walls?

1850
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:05,250
That should be illegal.

1851
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,990
I would like to talk to the prison warden's manager.

1852
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,750
And so thank you for the Akasupa.

1853
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:13,210
Thank you, thank you.

1854
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,470
I would like to...

1855
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,730
I would like...

1856
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:18,070
Wait, what?

1857
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,570
What happened?

1858
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:24,110
Wait, what the fuck is that?

1859
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:25,450
What the...

1860
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:26,950
What's going on?

1861
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:28,670
What's going on?

1862
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:32,110
Wait, what are these?

1863
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:37,570
I don't know what they are and I'm scared.

1864
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:38,370
I don't...

1865
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:41,550
I don't know what they are and I'm very scared.

1866
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:46,270
Oh no.

1867
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:48,890
Oh no, okay.

1868
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:49,730
It's fine.

1869
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:51,470
Poke!

1870
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:54,650
Oh shit, a thousand and six?

1871
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:56,110
That's a lot.

1872
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,010
Oh fuck!

1873
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:58,270
Okay,

1874
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,720
now I understand what it does.

1875
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,900
No, no, you do not get to put me down there.

1876
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:06,860
Now I understand.

1877
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,280
Now I understand what they do.

1878
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:11,700
Oh no.

1879
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,280
Okay.

1880
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,720
We gotta get rid of him.

1881
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,140
We gotta get rid of him.

1882
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,540
I understand now.

1883
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:19,640
My HP is gone.

1884
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,220
My maximum HP.

1885
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:22,760
Oh god.

1886
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,640
It drains my HP, yeah.

1887
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,500
Oh no, please.

1888
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:28,540
Please.

1889
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,360
There's no way he attacks me, right?

1890
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,060
Oh, I think he does.

1891
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,600
No, where did he go?

1892
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,820
Where did he go?

1893
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:36,980
This is not fair.

1894
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,880
Oh, oh, I see.

1895
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,260
Oh!

1896
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:40,960
Oh!

1897
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:53,390
He kicked me.

1898
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:55,710
He sparred on me.

1899
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,570
He actually sparred.

1900
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,710
That's so fucked.

1901
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:09,610
That is so fucked.

1902
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,590
Man, I can't believe it.

1903
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:14,610
He actually sparred on me.

1904
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,790
Oh my god.

1905
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:19,810
Now I know why everybody hates this level.

1906
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:21,010
Oh.

1907
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:23,810
Alright.

1908
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:27,570
Okay, let's grab this.

1909
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:30,430
Um...

1910
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:31,110
Um...

1911
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:32,270
What do I want?

1912
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:40,410
After six successful hits with the first four moves during mobile spin, each talent barter increases maximum mana.

1913
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:42,450
Oh, we like the mana.

1914
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,870
I like the mana thing.

1915
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,230
Alright, here we go again.

1916
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,510
Here we fucking go again.

1917
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:50,410
Oh!

1918
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:51,150
Okay.

1919
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:52,630
Alright, that's good.

1920
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:54,870
They only live for like...

1921
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:55,810
That's good.

1922
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:57,030
Guys, guys, that's good.

1923
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:00,570
They're only alive for like once.

1924
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:02,470
If I killed them, they're dead forever.

1925
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:04,910
That's good.

1926
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:07,590
That's good to know.

1927
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:10,410
Oh, where is the other guy?

1928
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,490
Wait, where did the other guy go?

1929
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:16,290
The other guy is gone.

1930
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:19,570
Where did he go?

1931
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:19,590
Where did he go?

1932
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:23,390
She lacks critical.

1933
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:26,030
Please let me live in my ignorance.

1934
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:26,650
Let me...

1935
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:30,650
Let me live in my fairy tale.

1936
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:33,170
Let me live in my fairy tale.

1937
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:34,010
Let me live in my fairy tale.

1938
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:34,570
I like...

1939
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,730
I like living in my fairy tale, guys.

1940
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:38,690
I like living in my fairy tale, guys.

1941
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,370
Wait, what's this?

1942
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:42,970
Is this new?

1943
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:44,390
No, it's 36.

1944
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:45,570
It's definitely not new.

1945
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:46,790
Alright.

1946
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:49,890
I definitely am very poor right now.

1947
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:53,870
Oh, what's in here?

1948
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:56,530
Hello?

1949
01:20:58,290 --> 01:20:59,410
You bad guy.

1950
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:00,690
I see you.

1951
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:02,910
Thank you for the will.

1952
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:05,470
Because I'm broke right now.

1953
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,950
I'm so broke.

1954
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:12,350
Wait, what?

1955
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:13,290
Oh, shit.

1956
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:15,550
Okay.

1957
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:15,890
Oh!

1958
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,470
It's fine.

1959
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:18,410
We're better.

1960
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:20,890
We don't need...

1961
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:23,270
We don't need the extra... extra stamina.

1962
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,350
We're so much better.

1963
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:27,210
Wait, how do I get there?

1964
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:32,310
Okay, clearly, like, I'll get out of this part.

1965
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:35,610
Oh, there it is.

1966
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:36,050
Okay.

1967
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:39,350
Snake head mushroom.

1968
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:42,310
Is there, like, extra will here?

1969
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:43,790
I literally see you.

1970
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:45,950
Okay.

1971
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,490
I did see him, though.

1972
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,470
Guys, I did see him.

1973
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:52,970
I didn't dodge him, but I saw him.

1974
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:57,770
Let's see.

1975
01:21:57,930 --> 01:21:59,230
I guess we go this way?

1976
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:01,870
Oh, wait.

1977
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,230
Where's the exit?

1978
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,710
There was, like, the little...

1979
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:05,390
Oh, there it is.

1980
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:05,750
Okay.

1981
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:07,610
Because there's an item here.

1982
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:09,370
Oh, shit.

1983
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:12,410
Wait, how do I get up there, though?

1984
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:13,810
Oh, please don't hit me.

1985
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:14,470
Please.

1986
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:15,170
Okay.

1987
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,070
We gotta...

1988
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:17,750
What?!

1989
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,250
We gotta be very careful here.

1990
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:20,630
We gotta...

1991
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,190
Oh, no.

1992
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:23,370
Oh, no!

1993
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,490
Oh, I don't want to be near the edge.

1994
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:27,930
I don't want to be near the edge!

1995
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:30,770
It's fine.

1996
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,290
As long as I'm not near the edge, it's fine.

1997
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:36,630
Boom!

1998
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:38,910
Okay.

1999
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:39,310
Nice.

2000
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:41,150
We got him.

2001
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:42,510
Oh, no.

2002
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,150
Oh, no, you fuckers.

2003
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,870
No, you fuckers!

2004
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,230
Why?!

2005
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,530
Why?!

2006
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,320
Why?!

2007
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,060
Bimby, get close to you!

2008
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:00,940
This is not fair!

2009
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,440
This is not fair!

2010
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,800
This is not fair!

2011
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,540
He's angry!

2012
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,660
He has a grab?!

2013
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:20,000
He has a grab?!

2014
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,580
He has a fucking grab!

2015
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:24,560
And he's back!

2016
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,940
And he's back!

2017
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,660
I missed!

2018
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,820
I'm not okay!

2019
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,260
I'm not okay!

2020
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:38,580
He has a fucking grab.

2021
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,280
Are you serious, where did he go?

2022
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,500
Where did he go?

2023
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,660
Oh shit, okay.

2024
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:51,640
He's kicking me.

2025
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,540
He's kicking me.

2026
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:56,640
Oh, 1,600.

2027
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,840
There's another one.

2028
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,660
There's another one?

2029
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,680
Where are they?

2030
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,780
What do you mean there's another one?

2031
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,140
Where is he?

2032
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:17,840
Okay, there's not another.

2033
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,760
Okay, I need a rest.

2034
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:33,800
I think I realize why everybody... I think I realize why everybody hates this level.

2035
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,280
I hate that.

2036
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:35,660
I hate that.

2037
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,220
I know now.

2038
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,640
I know now.

2039
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:41,220
You know what?

2040
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,260
I don't even... You know what?

2041
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:44,740
I'm just gonna run.

2042
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,460
I don't even want to farm this area.

2043
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:53,280
I don't even want to be here anymore.

2044
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,700
I'm willing to just run past everything.

2045
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,740
I think I'm just gonna run.

2046
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,660
I don't need the loot, guys.

2047
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,200
I don't need the loot.

2048
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,680
No, no, no.

2049
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,200
It's fine.

2050
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,980
We don't need the loot, guys.

2051
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:17,460
The loot is not that good.

2052
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:24,580
What do you mean there's even a worse part?

2053
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:24,940
Why?

2054
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:29,500
How can they make this section worse?

2055
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,700
I don't understand.

2056
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:40,820
I feel like I'm already experiencing pure fuckery right now.

2057
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,500
There's no way they can make this a worse experience than what I...

2058
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,600
There's no way.

2059
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,560
There's no way.

2060
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:53,860
There's no way.

2061
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:55,320
What the fuck?

2062
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:55,560
How?

2063
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:57,820
Oh, God.

2064
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,460
Oh, God.

2065
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,000
Let me grab this and then freeze him.

2066
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:04,020
I can't.

2067
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,380
I can't right now.

2068
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,700
I don't care if I'm using magic.

2069
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:09,400
I can't.

2070
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,240
This area sucks.

2071
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,420
Hey, I don't need the loot, guys.

2072
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,660
I really do not need the loot.

2073
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,300
I just want to be out of here.

2074
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,080
Hey.

2075
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:23,660
Hey.

2076
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,720
I need to be out of here.

2077
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,080
All right.

2078
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,100
Off we go.

2079
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,480
Now I know why that guy was like...

2080
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,280
He was like, stay in your cage.

2081
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:36,740
Now I know.

2082
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,460
He was right.

2083
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,380
Okay, but, like, what if, like...

2084
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,160
Okay, I know, like, I don't want the loot, but, like, I saw a chest.

2085
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,180
And, like, I can't... I can't...

2086
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,840
Chess equals shiny.

2087
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:51,180
But, like, what about the chest, though?

2088
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,020
I can't resist.

2089
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,140
I see a good-ass chest.

2090
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:58,880
Okay.

2091
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,000
Open.

2092
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:05,780
Oh?

2093
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,640
What is that?

2094
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,440
Are you...

2095
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,320
Are you fucking kidding me?

2096
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:11,660
Please.

2097
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:14,320
I just wanted to open the chest.

2098
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,180
Are you... Are you fucking...

2099
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:21,580
Where?

2100
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,540
Where is he?

2101
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,400
Where is he?

2102
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,740
Oh my god, there he is.

2103
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:31,760
There's that fucker.

2104
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,340
There's no way he sees me.

2105
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,740
Just run?

2106
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:37,980
Okay, I'm just gonna run.

2107
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,540
I'm just gonna run.

2108
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:40,780
I'm just gonna run.

2109
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,280
It's not even worth it anymore.

2110
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,240
I'm just gonna fucking run.

2111
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,740
It's not even worth it.

2112
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,160
I'm just gonna run.

2113
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,280
I'm gonna get rid of these guys though.

2114
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:03,420
Oh no.

2115
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:04,960
Oh no.

2116
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,420
Where do I run to though?

2117
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,140
Is it over?

2118
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:09,720
Is it over?

2119
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,220
Is it over?

2120
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,020
Did I just chill here?

2121
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,120
He doesn't know.

2122
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,000
He doesn't know.

2123
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,240
Do not go outside.

2124
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,020
Do not go.

2125
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,020
Do not open zombie inside.

2126
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,220
It's never open.

2127
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,540
Keep running!

2128
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,460
Oh.

2129
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,340
Oh, it stopped.

2130
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,780
I forgot there was fall damage.

2131
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:12,520
I forgot there was fall damage.

2132
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:22,380
After all of that, I forgot fall damage existed.

2133
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,950
I didn't know.

2134
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:32,610
I didn't know.

2135
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:36,670
I didn't fucking know.

2136
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:43,430
I lived my whole life with no fall damage.

2137
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:50,850
Oh my god, I just wanted to know what's down here.

2138
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:53,250
I saw shiny!

2139
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:57,190
I saw a shiny!

2140
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:01,750
Next scene, thank you for the super chat, thank you.

2141
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,650
I was like, oh, now I can finally open this box!

2142
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:09,870
Nice, I got my fine china.

2143
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:10,410
Woo!

2144
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:12,290
Fine china, let's go!

2145
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:15,410
Alright, we're leaving.

2146
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:20,610
I do not care enough for this.

2147
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:22,630
Alright, here we go.

2148
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:24,970
I just saw shiny.

2149
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:27,910
It knows my weakness.

2150
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:29,390
It knows.

2151
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:33,370
It knows that I can't resist the shiny.

2152
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,550
It fucking knows.

2153
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:39,850
You're so fucking evil.

2154
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,840
Let's get to the very top.

2155
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,380
It'll stop the health drain.

2156
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:48,260
Oh, I like the sound of that.

2157
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,580
Oh, but also shiny.

2158
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,460
Shiny.

2159
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:52,000
Shiny.

2160
01:30:58,340 --> 01:30:59,200
Alright, nice.

2161
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:02,120
Alright, back at it again.

2162
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,260
Am I at the top yet?

2163
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:05,580
Woah!

2164
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:08,880
Is it dead end?

2165
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,940
Oh, this is a dead end.

2166
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,360
God fucking damn it.

2167
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:13,380
How the fuck?

2168
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:15,240
This is a dead end, guys.

2169
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,680
This is a dead end.

2170
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,500
I'm leaving.

2171
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,860
I don't care.

2172
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,600
We're gonna figure out how to get out of here.

2173
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:22,840
Oh, shiny.

2174
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,460
Oh, shiny.

2175
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,700
Okay, but shiny though.

2176
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,660
I know I said I wasn't gonna grab any loot.

2177
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,000
But like, I can't help it.

2178
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,480
When I see shiny, I must grab.

2179
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,440
Oh, woah, woah.

2180
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:37,380
That's not shiny.

2181
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,340
Goodbye, guys.

2182
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,540
Just gotta keep running.

2183
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:41,360
No!

2184
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:43,800
No, no, no.

2185
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:44,540
They're back.

2186
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:45,800
They're back.

2187
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,580
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2188
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:48,600
They're back.

2189
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:49,200
They're back.

2190
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,520
No, no, no, no, no.

2191
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:51,360
Get out of here!

2192
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:56,200
Leave me alone.

2193
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:56,960
Leave me alone.

2194
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:02,000
Leave me alone, bats!

2195
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:04,660
It's okay.

2196
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,580
They won't know I'm here.

2197
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,720
They won't know.

2198
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,800
They won't know.

2199
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:09,500
I'm so safe.

2200
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,100
They can't kick me out.

2201
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,400
I'm gonna wait here.

2202
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:15,040
They won't know.

2203
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,100
This is my safe spot.

2204
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,600
This is my safe zone.

2205
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,320
Please don't kick me out.

2206
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:23,320
Please.

2207
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:25,080
I'm not a squatter.

2208
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:25,720
I swear.

2209
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,040
I pay rent.

2210
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:29,640
I pay rent here.

2211
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,280
I live in New York City rent.

2212
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,700
It's pretty spacious for New York City.

2213
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,440
Not gonna lie.

2214
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:40,860
No, they don't know.

2215
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:41,780
It's all right.

2216
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,600
My studio apartment.

2217
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,360
Please.

2218
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,100
Oh, God.

2219
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,940
Where is he?

2220
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,880
Where is the scary man?

2221
01:32:58,060 --> 01:32:59,280
I'm so scared.

2222
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,380
$4,000 a month?

2223
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:03,000
Wow.

2224
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:03,640
That's a steal.

2225
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:08,500
Just run.

2226
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:12,180
I swear to God, if I get kicked off the cliff.

2227
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:18,500
If I get kicked off the cliff from the guy that was like, just run.

2228
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,380
I swear to fucking God.

2229
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:21,720
I swear to fucking God.

2230
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:21,860
I swear to fucking God.

2231
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:25,160
Alright, nice.

2232
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,220
Lamp man gone.

2233
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,300
Oh no.

2234
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,880
Oh no.

2235
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,800
If anybody is gonna fucking die here.

2236
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:37,760
Okay, that was actually scary.

2237
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,980
I almost thought it was over.

2238
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,980
I don't need that willpower.

2239
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,180
I don't need that willpower.

2240
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:49,460
Goodbye.

2241
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:52,580
Goodbye.

2242
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,280
Goodbye.

2243
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,080
Oh my god.

2244
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:00,720
So far so good.

2245
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,100
Oh.

2246
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:03,860
It's alright.

2247
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,620
I have 200,000 people chase me but it's okay.

2248
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,140
It's okay.

2249
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,240
Oh my god, are they still chasing me?

2250
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:17,660
One guy is.

2251
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:18,920
That one guy.

2252
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,340
Am I safe now?

2253
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:24,380
Am I...

2254
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,520
Am I safe?

2255
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:27,940
Oh.

2256
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:28,940
Hey, who is he?

2257
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,060
Who the fuck is this guy?

2258
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:35,460
This guy is big boy.

2259
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:37,880
Not big enough!

2260
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:38,860
Shit!

2261
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:39,840
Okay.

2262
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,340
That's cheating.

2263
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:42,660
You got a third party.

2264
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,200
That's actually cheating, man.

2265
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:48,120
I used magic but at least I didn't bring a buddy.

2266
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,100
What are you?

2267
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:53,720
With sword in hand, the foe's chest pierced.

2268
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,740
Oh, he's red-haired.

2269
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,120
Hey, at least the guy...

2270
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,020
The journal didn't call him ugly this time.

2271
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:02,100
And this guy was tanky as hell.

2272
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,780
I had to use my mana on him.

2273
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:04,100
Nope.

2274
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:04,460
Leaving.

2275
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:05,340
Nope.

2276
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,440
Nope.

2277
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,220
Not gonna deal with that.

2278
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,720
Oh, thank god.

2279
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,080
Oh, thank god.

2280
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,240
Is it over?

2281
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:16,140
Is it over?

2282
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:17,620
Is it...

2283
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,340
Is it over, guys?

2284
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,740
Am I free?

2285
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,200
Am I...

2286
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,520
Am I free?

2287
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,120
It's never over.

2288
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,560
What do you mean halfway?

2289
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,620
What do you mean?

2290
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,000
No!

2291
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:43,100
Get me out of here.

2292
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,000
Please.

2293
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,200
I...

2294
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,240
I...

2295
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,320
I...

2296
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:24,330
We are back to the boss the moment we fucking get rid of the team.

2297
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:24,770
No.

2298
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:26,850
Wait yes or no.

2299
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,790
No!

2300
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,640
Where's the boss?

2301
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,400
Where the fuck is the boss?

2302
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:50,360
Okay.

2303
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:52,100
Alright.

2304
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,540
Okay, it's- oh he's still there.

2305
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:56,740
It's fine.

2306
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,980
I can outrun him, right?

2307
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:00,640
It's so fine.

2308
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,620
We're so fine.

2309
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,460
We're so healthy.

2310
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,660
We're so healthy.

2311
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:11,340
We're so... I feel so healthy.

2312
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:14,260
It's fine.

2313
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,040
We're gonna run.

2314
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:15,920
We're gonna run.

2315
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,740
We're not gonna let them bait us into the bats again.

2316
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:22,040
We're not letting the bats win.

2317
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:24,380
Stay inside.

2318
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:26,120
Stay inside.

2319
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,500
Oh god.

2320
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:30,720
Up we go!

2321
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,640
I know he lives up there!

2322
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:40,490
Oh god.

2323
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:41,490
Oh god.

2324
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:45,610
Okay, it's fine.

2325
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:46,470
It's fine.

2326
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:47,850
The moment we kill the...

2327
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:50,430
God damn stupid... I went the wrong way.

2328
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:52,510
I went the fucking... Oh no!

2329
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:54,130
There's There's so many people!

2330
01:37:57,110 --> 01:37:57,710
Shit.

2331
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:02,730
I got stuck.

2332
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:03,990
I got stuck.

2333
01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:05,430
It's fine.

2334
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:07,370
I feel so healthy.

2335
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:09,590
Oh my god, this is it!

2336
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:10,770
Oh god.

2337
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:12,950
Oh god, we're almost there.

2338
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:14,530
We're almost there.

2339
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:18,410
Stupid fucking archer, but we're almost there.

2340
01:38:19,410 --> 01:38:20,190
It's fine.

2341
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:23,870
I will freeze your ass to get you out of this lobby.

2342
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:25,950
Alright, here we go.

2343
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:30,710
Oh, please tell me there's gonna be an incense up top.

2344
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:32,510
Oh, thank fucking god.

2345
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:35,190
Thank fucking god.

2346
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:36,790
Holy shit.

2347
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:38,130
Alright.

2348
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:39,830
He has to push up.

2349
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:41,930
Fuck!

2350
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:42,750
Alright.

2351
01:38:43,810 --> 01:38:45,330
There's an incense right here.

2352
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:46,550
There's hope.

2353
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:49,270
There's hope up here.

2354
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:51,310
Oh, there's so much hope.

2355
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:53,430
There's so much hope in the world.

2356
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:57,290
Kyle, thank you for the super chat.

2357
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:59,810
Thank you for the pause at the very top.

2358
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:06,410
Yes, I ran through everything.

2359
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:07,750
This hell!

2360
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:10,510
I don't need the loot down there.

2361
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:12,470
I'll fucking...

2362
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:14,990
I'll go back down when he's dead.

2363
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:18,070
I'll go back downstairs when he's dead.

2364
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:20,430
There's no point to be up there.

2365
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:25,830
Alright.

2366
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:28,970
Alright, there should be no more...

2367
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:30,570
no more of those guys, right?

2368
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:33,050
I'll go back!

2369
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:35,450
I can walk back, guys.

2370
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:38,270
It's not like I turn around...

2371
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:39,570
I turn the car around.

2372
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:41,490
I can turn back.

2373
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:45,870
It's not that typical.

2374
01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:47,450
Oh.

2375
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:49,090
Oh, Birdman.

2376
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:50,570
Oh, hey, it's him!

2377
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:51,350
Oh, hey!

2378
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:52,590
He's a famous...

2379
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,630
He's famous!

2380
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:56,410
Oh my god, you're so famous!

2381
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:57,530
Can I get your autograph?

2382
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:58,410
I'm frozen.

2383
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:00,510
You fucker.

2384
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:02,970
Yes!

2385
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,110
He has a thing!

2386
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:09,810
That's right.

2387
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:10,490
Big baby.

2388
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:16,230
We'll get to the secret boss the moment this is all over.

2389
01:40:18,190 --> 01:40:18,670
Alright.

2390
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:22,150
The falcon fan maker.

2391
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:25,330
The swan soars high.

2392
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:26,550
It's published lush.

2393
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:28,090
Oh, hey, it's that guy.

2394
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:29,250
Yeah, he controls...

2395
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,230
He does the wind shit.

2396
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,550
Okay, I don't like that I'm frozen.

2397
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:34,450
That is... does not...

2398
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:35,730
That does not bring me joy.

2399
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:37,110
Wait, is that it?

2400
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:40,730
What does he...

2401
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:41,290
What?

2402
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:42,450
What does he offer?

2403
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,450
That's it?

2404
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:44,950
That's it?

2405
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:47,750
What is this guy?

2406
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,670
That's it?

2407
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:49,670
What was that for?

2408
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:52,490
Yeah, yeah, I know.

2409
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:53,730
But like, what was that guy for?

2410
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:56,110
Monkey no light cold.

2411
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:57,250
Monkey needs the...

2412
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,650
The hot sauna water.

2413
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:03,150
Yeah, yeah, but like...

2414
01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:04,170
Wait, was there a stutter?

2415
01:41:06,030 --> 01:41:07,350
Was there a stutter, guys?

2416
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:10,770
I didn't notice a stutter on my end.

2417
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,600
It was a bit...

2418
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,020
All right.

2419
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,440
I didn't notice any stutters on my end, though.

2420
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:30,600
There's been a couple.

2421
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,200
I wonder if it's the YouTube side.

2422
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,960
Because like, I haven't been experiencing any stutters.

2423
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,260
Is this him?

2424
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:42,220
Is this the...

2425
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,320
Is this the guy that's causing me so much pain and grief?

2426
01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:00,170
Captain wise voice.

2427
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:02,610
Oh, look at...

2428
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:03,510
At least he has toes.

2429
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:11,790
Oh, he has multiple toes.

2430
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:13,630
All right.

2431
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:15,010
I swear to God.

2432
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:16,910
Did I...

2433
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:17,370
Okay.

2434
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:20,330
Okay.

2435
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:21,750
Okay.

2436
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:24,650
I'm not having a...

2437
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:27,830
I don't know if you noticed, but like, I'm not doing so hot right now.

2438
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:31,190
Wait!

2439
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:32,490
That's like...

2440
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:34,190
What the fuck?

2441
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:35,590
That's my damage?

2442
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,550
What?

2443
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:38,070
How the...

2444
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:39,770
Where is my damage?

2445
01:42:41,810 --> 01:42:43,290
What is your weak spot?

2446
01:42:43,410 --> 01:42:43,910
Is it not...

2447
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:44,930
Is the toes not your weak spot?

2448
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,070
Where...

2449
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:46,810
Are you weak?

2450
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:47,910
No way.

2451
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:49,470
Where are...

2452
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:50,850
Where are you weak?

2453
01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:51,890
I don't understand.

2454
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:55,970
What's the head?

2455
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:57,370
It's the fucking head.

2456
01:42:57,810 --> 01:42:59,030
It's the fucking head.

2457
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:00,670
I will fucking beat your head up.

2458
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:02,050
That's fucking right.

2459
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:04,890
I don't even need stamina to do this.

2460
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:06,070
Ugh, oh, it's gonna curdle.

2461
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:12,220
That's fucking right.

2462
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:12,880
Boom!

2463
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:17,940
Alright.

2464
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:19,380
It's fine.

2465
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:20,440
It's fine.

2466
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:21,780
Just keep hitting the toes!

2467
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,100
Just keep hitting the toes!

2468
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,560
The toes is weak point!

2469
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:29,820
That's fucking right!

2470
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:30,980
I found your weak spot!

2471
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:37,140
Okay.

2472
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:37,620
Nice.

2473
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,420
That's fucking right.

2474
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,100
I know where your weak spot is.

2475
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,160
I know what it is!

2476
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:46,820
You can't hide the toes from me!

2477
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:49,660
Poke!

2478
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,060
Okay.

2479
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:52,320
Nice.

2480
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:52,600
Okay.

2481
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:53,980
I gotta regen now.

2482
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:59,040
Where am I?

2483
01:43:59,180 --> 01:43:59,660
Wait!

2484
01:43:59,740 --> 01:43:59,880
Oh!

2485
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:00,640
That's where I am!

2486
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,540
What the fuck?!

2487
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:06,060
What the fuck?!

2488
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:06,740
How?!

2489
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,580
Okay.

2490
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:11,660
Nice.

2491
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:12,180
Alright.

2492
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:12,840
I stopped it.

2493
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,300
I stopped the evil.

2494
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,100
Okay.

2495
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,060
I don't... I can't see anything.

2496
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,800
I can't see anything sometimes!

2497
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:28,890
Poke!

2498
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:29,630
Oh shit!

2499
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:29,950
Okay.

2500
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:30,850
He does not like the poke.

2501
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:31,530
Oh!

2502
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:32,670
What the fuck?!

2503
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:37,780
Okay.

2504
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:38,380
Okay.

2505
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,240
Alright.

2506
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:41,840
Alright.

2507
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:43,940
What is he doing?

2508
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:45,340
I can't tell!

2509
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:46,940
I can't tell!

2510
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:50,340
What is he doing?!

2511
01:44:59,280 --> 01:44:59,960
What?!

2512
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:10,310
Oh my god.

2513
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:10,550
How?

2514
01:45:11,110 --> 01:45:12,130
Actually how?

2515
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:18,750
Holy shit!

2516
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:22,610
Oh!

2517
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:23,630
I had to jump!

2518
01:45:24,690 --> 01:45:25,890
That's actual bullshit!

2519
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:27,730
I had to jump!

2520
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:31,190
Let me... get me at your toes!

2521
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:34,550
Okay.

2522
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:35,670
Bye-bye.

2523
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:38,310
This is fucked.

2524
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:40,010
This is actually fucked.

2525
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:43,670
Bye.

2526
01:45:45,490 --> 01:45:46,290
Please.

2527
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:48,190
Oh please!

2528
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:51,990
This boss is bullshit!

2529
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:56,210
Toes!

2530
01:45:57,610 --> 01:46:01,600
Oh my god.

2531
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:02,220
This...

2532
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,760
This boss is actually bullshit.

2533
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:09,580
My ch... My wolf barely does anything!

2534
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:12,100
Baby!

2535
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:12,460
Baby!

2536
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:12,680
Baby!

2537
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:12,920
Baby!

2538
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,180
Baby!

2539
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:15,680
Baby!

2540
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:16,180
Baby!

2541
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:16,460
Baby!

2542
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:16,660
Baby!

2543
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:17,100
Come on!

2544
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:18,640
Give me the baby!

2545
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:20,840
Oh

2546
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:24,140
god.

2547
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:25,000
Oh god.

2548
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:26,240
It gave me the baby.

2549
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:27,380
Oh thank god.

2550
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:32,520
Yes!

2551
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:32,760
Yes!

2552
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:33,700
First try!

2553
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,900
Oh thank god!

2554
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:40,080
First try!

2555
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:42,140
I didn't want to finish!

2556
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,720
I don't want to fight him again!

2557
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:45,940
I don't want to fight him again!

2558
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:50,340
Oh!

2559
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:52,220
That's right!

2560
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:53,620
Get out!

2561
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,240
Get your bullshit freeze out of here!

2562
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:00,300
I'm disappointed.

2563
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:00,860
You should have done better.

2564
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:01,880
You should have tried him again!

2565
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:04,740
How dare you be good at this game!

2566
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,680
I demand another shot!

2567
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:13,960
Oh my god.

2568
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,400
Thank fucking god!

2569
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:16,520
Wait!

2570
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,300
It's gold!

2571
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:19,040
Wait!

2572
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:21,280
Is this stronger than Big Baby?

2573
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,800
How dare you not suffer!

2574
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:28,160
Wait!

2575
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:29,220
It's gold!

2576
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:32,660
Let me start the game right now!

2577
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,120
The captain lies.

2578
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,440
Alright.

2579
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,880
Oh I don't even get to use it?

2580
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:42,800
But I absorbed him!

2581
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,960
What do you mean?

2582
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,080
Alright.

2583
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:48,080
Time to fight.

2584
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:48,520
Alright.

2585
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,840
We're running it back now.

2586
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,800
Now we can run it back.

2587
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:53,780
Now!

2588
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:55,060
Now!

2589
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,480
We can actually...

2590
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,520
Oh shit.

2591
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,820
I almost fell off just cause.

2592
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:01,740
Oh.

2593
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,820
Oh thank god.

2594
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:08,620
I don't know if I can craft new armor now.

2595
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,620
Cause I was broke before.

2596
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:13,460
Oh I can!

2597
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,260
Thank god.

2598
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:14,600
Alright.

2599
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,500
Let's grab that.

2600
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:19,220
Confirm.

2601
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,340
And then... Oh!

2602
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,120
29?

2603
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,280
Wait.

2604
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:23,660
What?

2605
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:25,860
Wait.

2606
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,380
Why the fuck did I make this one?

2607
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:27,580
What?

2608
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:31,580
Okay.

2609
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:32,560
Alright.

2610
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,980
Let me make this one too.

2611
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:35,040
Let me...

2612
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:37,680
Alright.

2613
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:38,900
Alright.

2614
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:40,460
Now we make this one.

2615
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:43,460
Confirm.

2616
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:43,900
Alright.

2617
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:45,820
Cause I don't read.

2618
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:47,060
That's a good answer.

2619
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,340
Good answer.

2620
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:50,460
Alright.

2621
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,420
Let's see.

2622
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,920
We can finally head back downstairs.

2623
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:57,400
See that one guy that was like, no you need a...

2624
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:01,700
I wasn't even able to beat the boss because I had to collect all the stuff while I went up there.

2625
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:02,380
That's right.

2626
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:03,460
I told you guys.

2627
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,140
I'm a fucking gamer.

2628
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:05,740
Let's go.

2629
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:08,060
Alright.

2630
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:08,400
Nice.

2631
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:09,680
I don't need no magic.

2632
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:10,000
Okay.

2633
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:10,560
Maybe I should.

2634
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:11,540
Give me a sec guys.

2635
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:12,400
I need to get my magic.

2636
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:14,280
I need it.

2637
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:17,100
I realized I have no magic.

2638
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,560
And like... I don't know.

2639
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,360
Wait.

2640
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:19,840
What the fuck?

2641
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,080
I might... I could possibly die.

2642
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,550
That's right Tommy.

2643
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:31,870
I didn't need that loot Tommy.

2644
01:49:32,830 --> 01:49:34,530
Thank you for the super chat.

2645
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:34,970
Thank you.

2646
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:35,530
Thank you.

2647
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:38,990
Alright.

2648
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:40,550
We can head over.

2649
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:52,370
Let me use the bathroom.

2650
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:39,880
Now I'm mentally ready.

2651
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:42,440
Next scene.

2652
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:43,760
Thank you for the super chat.

2653
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:44,280
Thank you.

2654
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:44,920
Thank you.

2655
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:45,520
Okay.

2656
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:46,920
Now...

2657
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,800
Now I'm...

2658
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,280
I'm mentally ready.

2659
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,160
When he... When that guy kicked me off the ledge.

2660
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:57,700
I realized...

2661
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:00,720
That was the day I realized I was not ready.

2662
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:01,700
But now I am.

2663
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,560
Alright.

2664
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:04,800
Alright.

2665
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:06,600
Alright.

2666
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:07,580
Let's go downstairs.

2667
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:08,440
Alright.

2668
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:09,580
Where is it?

2669
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,100
Where even am I?

2670
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,080
Like...

2671
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,480
Is this where I'm at?

2672
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:14,880
Alright.

2673
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,760
We have to go to the...

2674
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:18,100
Oh!

2675
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,840
If I give this guy...

2676
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:22,080
Who do I...

2677
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:25,040
If I give this guy that killed the warden...

2678
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:25,700
Does he...

2679
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:27,400
Is he free?

2680
01:52:33,170 --> 01:52:33,730
Yeah.

2681
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:34,290
But like...

2682
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:35,810
I want to show him that I killed him.

2683
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:39,510
I want to show that to him.

2684
01:52:39,570 --> 01:52:39,610
I want to show that to him.

2685
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:40,030
And be like...

2686
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:40,210
Look!

2687
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:40,790
I did it!

2688
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:44,830
The NPC...

2689
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:45,010
Yeah!

2690
01:52:46,450 --> 01:52:47,550
He's going to be so impressed.

2691
01:52:50,490 --> 01:52:51,190
I'll be like...

2692
01:52:51,190 --> 01:52:51,290
Yeah.

2693
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:53,070
They should have given me a better cage.

2694
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:57,840
Look!

2695
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:58,500
I did it!

2696
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:00,740
Okay.

2697
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:01,460
He doesn't care.

2698
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:01,960
Okay.

2699
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:02,240
I'm...

2700
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:02,620
Alright.

2701
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:04,300
He doesn't fucking care.

2702
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:04,680
Okay.

2703
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:05,920
He doesn't fucking care.

2704
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:06,960
I might as well just jump off.

2705
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:08,880
Let me jump off!

2706
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:09,300
Oh!

2707
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:10,680
I have to get hit by them?

2708
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:11,280
Alright.

2709
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:11,700
Do it!

2710
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,100
Do it!

2711
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:13,800
Kick me off!

2712
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:14,380
Right now!

2713
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,120
Do it!

2714
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:17,260
Fucking do it!

2715
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:20,560
Do it!

2716
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,720
Oh my god!

2717
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:26,500
He can't even do it.

2718
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,680
It's so fucking pathetic.

2719
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:30,680
Wait.

2720
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,580
There's the other boss?

2721
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,360
I don't even know where the other boss...

2722
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:33,440
Oh!

2723
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:33,580
Hey!

2724
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:34,180
There's loot.

2725
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:36,840
Okay.

2726
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:41,520
Just kick me.

2727
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:41,820
Just kick me.

2728
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,040
Yeah.

2729
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,120
But I'm lazy.

2730
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:47,560
I don't want to deal with it.

2731
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:49,500
Yeah.

2732
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:50,040
I know.

2733
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:51,120
But I'm lazy.

2734
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:53,220
He could...

2735
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:55,500
Kicking me off would make me...

2736
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:59,560
If he kicked me off, it would hit me faster.

2737
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:04,080
Okay.

2738
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:04,280
Okay.

2739
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:04,760
Second shrine.

2740
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,700
Jump down behind.

2741
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:06,380
Okay.

2742
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:06,820
Okay.

2743
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:14,340
This is a shitty prison.

2744
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:16,120
Because I could literally just leave.

2745
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:17,700
If I think about it.

2746
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:21,300
I could literally just travel to the next area.

2747
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:23,960
Jump down here?

2748
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:28,250
Here?

2749
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:34,110
I'm not gonna jump there.

2750
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:36,030
You liars.

2751
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:39,130
Oh, inside.

2752
01:54:39,310 --> 01:54:39,730
Okay.

2753
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:42,370
Here?

2754
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:48,710
No, you idiot.

2755
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:52,190
This way?

2756
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:57,350
Oh, the hole!

2757
01:54:58,730 --> 01:54:59,910
The hole is the goal.

2758
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:01,950
Alright.

2759
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:03,790
Here.

2760
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:08,070
I fucking... Okay.

2761
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:11,150
Oh shit, what the fuck?

2762
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:12,410
What is he?

2763
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:17,330
Oh shit, what the fuck?

2764
01:55:18,190 --> 01:55:19,190
Wait, that's not fair.

2765
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:20,110
How does he do that?

2766
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:24,010
Wait, what?

2767
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:27,370
What the fuck?

2768
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:28,850
Oh, that's legal.

2769
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:31,390
Wait, that's fucking legal.

2770
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:33,750
That's not fair.

2771
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:37,330
It's not fair.

2772
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:37,710
Ow!

2773
01:55:38,350 --> 01:55:39,250
That's not fair.

2774
01:55:39,570 --> 01:55:40,810
What the fuck!

2775
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:44,530
Oh my!

2776
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:46,490
Okay, this is actually really good.

2777
01:55:48,050 --> 01:55:49,030
Don't worry, I got you.

2778
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:52,630
That's fucking right.

2779
01:55:53,230 --> 01:55:55,230
Even if it was in the... Oh shit!

2780
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:55,730
Okay.

2781
01:55:58,030 --> 01:55:58,710
You know what?

2782
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:00,610
That's right.

2783
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:03,610
I don't think it does anything, but that's right.

2784
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:10,210
That didn't do much, but that's fucking right.

2785
01:56:13,150 --> 01:56:13,710
Woo!

2786
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:15,610
Oh, alright, nevermind.

2787
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:15,890
Oh!

2788
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:16,530
Oh!

2789
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:17,470
Oh!

2790
01:56:17,890 --> 01:56:18,450
Oh!

2791
01:56:18,530 --> 01:56:19,090
Okay!

2792
01:56:19,310 --> 01:56:19,890
Oh, alright!

2793
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:21,310
That's fine!

2794
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:22,750
Ah, alright.

2795
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:24,750
Okay.

2796
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:26,610
I... I don't know.

2797
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,060
You please come down.

2798
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,700
Please sir, get down!

2799
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:35,660
Where am I?

2800
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:37,540
What?

2801
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,040
It's alright, I just hit him one time.

2802
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:46,640
That's an accomplishment.

2803
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:50,700
Oh shit!

2804
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:51,400
You don't... Fuck this!

2805
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:53,380
Magic hair!

2806
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:55,500
Ah!

2807
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:56,360
No!

2808
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:57,960
Not the magic hair!

2809
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:00,160
My magic hair!

2810
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,700
This boss is so fucking... What?

2811
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,520
How is this boss harder?

2812
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:07,960
There's too many things...

2813
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,120
How is this boss harder?

2814
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:16,740
I don't understand.

2815
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,720
How are you so difficult?

2816
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:22,700
Okay.

2817
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:26,140
Smack that!

2818
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:27,180
Please!

2819
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,240
Please let me smack that!

2820
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,360
No!

2821
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,980
This boss is so fun!

2822
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:40,780
Oh my god, he's actually more difficult!

2823
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:44,240
How?!

2824
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:47,270
How?!

2825
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:53,030
Where's my gun when I need it?!

2826
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,180
I have to fight this fucker!

2827
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:06,200
The fuck do I...

2828
01:58:09,770 --> 01:58:12,210
Jesus Christ, I hate him.

2829
01:58:12,370 --> 01:58:13,670
I've never hated.

2830
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:14,670
I've...

2831
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:15,930
I've never hated him!

2832
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:22,710
He has a gun!

2833
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:23,730
That's not fair!

2834
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:24,190
He has a gun!

2835
01:58:24,190 --> 01:58:24,190
That's not fair!

2836
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:29,110
He literally has a laser gun!

2837
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:31,850
I have a fucking stick!

2838
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:35,030
Alright.

2839
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:38,710
I get it, I'll go.

2840
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:40,710
This is so not fair.

2841
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:43,430
This is not fair.

2842
01:58:48,170 --> 01:58:50,970
And I take damage getting down from here!

2843
01:58:51,450 --> 01:58:52,210
Like...

2844
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:56,810
Oh my god.

2845
01:58:57,230 --> 01:59:00,310
I should not be taking damage getting down from there.

2846
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:03,290
Fuck this magic hair.

2847
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:04,310
I...

2848
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:06,370
It won't let me use magic hair!

2849
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:10,470
This fucker.

2850
01:59:10,950 --> 01:59:12,390
This fucker!

2851
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:14,330
The boss gets...

2852
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:16,750
You can land on the roof?!

2853
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:18,850
Well, that's good to know.

2854
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:23,710
Now that I know you can land on the fucking roof.

2855
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:25,110
This is not fair!

2856
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:26,170
He's literally made of rock!

2857
01:59:26,330 --> 01:59:27,790
I mean, I'm literally made of rock too.

2858
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:28,450
But like...

2859
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:31,810
But like, I have less rock percentage than him.

2860
01:59:33,650 --> 01:59:36,250
Like, he's like 99% rock.

2861
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:42,110
Oh my god.

2862
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:46,130
I think the hardest part is the fact that like...

2863
01:59:46,130 --> 01:59:46,790
I...

2864
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:48,790
If I like...

2865
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:52,230
If I get hit by one of them, I get hit by all of them.

2866
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:54,270
Like, I...

2867
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,200
Oh my god.

2868
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:06,300
You're not Wukong.

2869
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:07,460
You're just hair.

2870
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:08,480
You're not him.

2871
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,280
Alright.

2872
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,260
Okay, here we go.

2873
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:19,220
I land on the roof this time.

2874
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:20,760
Oh my god.

2875
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:21,400
I did it.

2876
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:22,860
I...

2877
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:23,900
Okay, it doesn't...

2878
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:24,220
Okay.

2879
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:26,120
Okay.

2880
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:27,080
Alright.

2881
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:28,120
I did...

2882
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:30,420
I did not mean to do this.

2883
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:31,200
I...

2884
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:33,280
I care.

2885
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,220
This is it.

2886
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:36,520
I can't.

2887
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:37,660
I actually cannot.

2888
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:38,780
I...

2889
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:41,460
We're all gonna fuck this guy up right now.

2890
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:42,600
I...

2891
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,460
Alright, that's cool.

2892
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:46,020
That's fucking cool.

2893
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:51,760
I didn't mean to heal there too.

2894
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:55,280
That's already...

2895
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:55,900
Alright, transform!

2896
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:57,720
Transform!

2897
02:00:59,070 --> 02:00:59,440
Transform!

2898
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:01,440
Transform!

2899
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:04,860
How much did I do?

2900
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:07,920
How much damage did I do there?

2901
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:10,360
Oh, it does not feel a lot.

2902
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:12,360
It does not.

2903
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:20,700
Let me go!

2904
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:23,340
Let me go!

2905
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:24,400
Oh my god, Pourquoi.

2906
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:32,910
Oh my god.

2907
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:33,830
Please.

2908
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:36,070
Please.

2909
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:39,010
Please free me.

2910
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:41,490
Please.

2911
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:43,750
I don't deserve this.

2912
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:49,630
Okay.

2913
02:01:49,630 --> 02:01:50,350
Nice.

2914
02:01:50,610 --> 02:01:52,890
I actually used that thing.

2915
02:01:53,290 --> 02:01:54,670
You know, that thing.

2916
02:01:54,870 --> 02:01:56,710
Oh, never mind.

2917
02:01:57,690 --> 02:01:59,090
I almost used it.

2918
02:02:00,610 --> 02:02:01,690
Oh god.

2919
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:08,370
Thank you.

2920
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:09,270
Thank you.

2921
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:11,890
I finally used different mechanics, guys.

2922
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:14,070
Holy shit, guys.

2923
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:15,490
I did it.

2924
02:02:15,650 --> 02:02:19,670
I used other mechanics in the video game.

2925
02:02:19,890 --> 02:02:23,490
It only took this one fucking bastard.

2926
02:02:28,290 --> 02:02:31,530
I never had to use it until now.

2927
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:35,450
Oh god.

2928
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:38,490
I don't know.

2929
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:40,870
I don't know how I feel about this.

2930
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:46,680
Okay.

2931
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,680
Okay.

2932
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:51,000
Alright.

2933
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:51,760
That's fine.

2934
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:52,400
That's okay.

2935
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:56,540
That's not okay.

2936
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,260
That's not okay.

2937
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:00,600
Please.

2938
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:05,760
Okay.

2939
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:10,320
Please.

2940
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:12,180
Oh god.

2941
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:13,320
He's so far.

2942
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:14,860
He's so far.

2943
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:16,580
Please.

2944
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:17,860
Please just one hit.

2945
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:25,280
We did it.

2946
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:26,920
We fucking did it.

2947
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:31,400
I've never hated a boss more than this one.

2948
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:36,060
This boss was so much more frustrating than...

2949
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:37,900
Than the other guy.

2950
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:40,360
Than the main boss.

2951
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,980
He's actually so much more frustrating.

2952
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:45,560
Holy shit.

2953
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,420
What are you?

2954
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:50,000
All things are bad.

2955
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:51,260
There is no waxer, Wayne.

2956
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:53,100
Like I'll never know what you are.

2957
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:00,740
I've never hated a boss more than this one before.

2958
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:06,760
Okay.

2959
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:08,420
Where am I?

2960
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:11,560
Where even am I anymore?

2961
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:13,500
I can't tell.

2962
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:15,600
No.

2963
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:16,840
This guy was worse than...

2964
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:16,980
No.

2965
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,460
Actually no.

2966
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:18,120
Baby is worse.

2967
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:20,880
Baby is... God damn it.

2968
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:23,900
No.

2969
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,060
Baby was definitely worse.

2970
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:25,440
You're right.

2971
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:29,180
Baby I was so too under level to even fight Baby.

2972
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:29,860
Alright.

2973
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,560
Get out!

2974
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:36,440
Alright.

2975
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:37,520
Oh.

2976
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:38,580
The locks are gone now?

2977
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:41,640
I didn't even notice it.

2978
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:44,180
I was too busy trying to kill these...

2979
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:44,920
What the fuck?

2980
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:48,020
Oh God.

2981
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:48,880
I don't have any mana now.

2982
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:49,820
I don't...

2983
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:51,860
I used up all my mana for this.

2984
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:53,760
I think I might need to transform.

2985
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,540
I'm too lazy.

2986
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,900
We have to transform.

2987
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:00,920
I don't want to risk it.

2988
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:02,900
Already went through so much.

2989
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:06,280
Keep attacking Wolfman!

2990
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:06,720
He's dead!

2991
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:08,960
Keep doing your thing!

2992
02:05:11,020 --> 02:05:11,800
Oh God.

2993
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:13,160
He's still not dead?

2994
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:15,860
He's still not dead!

2995
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:20,060
Oh shit!

2996
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:22,980
Okay.

2997
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:23,240
It's fine.

2998
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,060
He's dead.

2999
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:24,760
Now he's dead.

3000
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:28,860
Oh.

3001
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:29,460
Absorb.

3002
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:33,300
Wait.

3003
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:33,600
The...

3004
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:35,240
The wolf has an ult?

3005
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:37,840
Wait.

3006
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:38,700
What do you mean?

3007
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:40,480
I only saw two.

3008
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,480
How do I use...

3009
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:42,640
The wolf has an ult?

3010
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:44,240
What?

3011
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:44,780
Wait.

3012
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:46,420
What?

3013
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:47,700
What do you mean?

3014
02:05:48,580 --> 02:05:49,220
You...

3015
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:49,900
You...

3016
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:50,500
You...

3017
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:55,240
No.

3018
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,320
You're lying.

3019
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:58,060
You're lying.

3020
02:05:58,420 --> 02:05:59,620
You're lying.

3021
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:01,540
That can't be right.

3022
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:04,100
You...

3023
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:05,520
You're lying.

3024
02:06:10,350 --> 02:06:11,250
You were lying.

3025
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:11,710
You're lying?!

3026
02:06:14,210 --> 02:06:16,710
I hope he still believes it...

3027
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:20,170
I hope he still believes it...

3028
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:21,130
No.

3029
02:06:21,130 --> 02:06:22,810
You have to be lying to me.

3030
02:06:28,670 --> 02:06:33,770
If you build up the light, move, you get a third move....

3031
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:35,410
Oh my God.

3032
02:06:35,410 --> 02:06:38,230
Who the fuck ever uses the light?

3033
02:06:38,330 --> 02:06:40,710
Other than now because I didn't want to waste it.

3034
02:06:45,410 --> 02:06:47,990
I can't believe the wolf has it all.

3035
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:52,550
Alright, let's recharge this.

3036
02:06:54,070 --> 02:06:55,490
I can't believe it.

3037
02:06:55,530 --> 02:06:57,670
Every day I learn something new.

3038
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:03,650
What the fuck?

3039
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:11,620
Alright.

3040
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:14,020
I just want to make sure I grab everything.

3041
02:07:15,820 --> 02:07:17,640
I don't know why I'm stuttering.

3042
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:19,600
Is it the 1440p?

3043
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,600
That's really annoying though.

3044
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:23,200
I'm sorry guys.

3045
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:28,580
I feel like every fucking stream I'm trying to...

3046
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:35,440
Every stream I'm literally experimenting with new stream settings.

3047
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,840
That's annoying though.

3048
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:40,540
Maybe or YouTube.

3049
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:43,220
So it's just YouTube?

3050
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,580
Is there anyone that's not stuttering?

3051
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:55,050
Oh, it's YouTube.

3052
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:55,670
Okay.

3053
02:07:55,850 --> 02:07:56,850
I don't know.

3054
02:07:56,910 --> 02:07:57,670
That's the thing.

3055
02:07:58,070 --> 02:08:01,430
I don't know if it's my end or like YouTube's side.

3056
02:08:02,970 --> 02:08:05,270
That's like the hard part trying to figure it out.

3057
02:08:06,270 --> 02:08:07,930
It could be YouTube then.

3058
02:08:08,010 --> 02:08:08,490
Okay.

3059
02:08:10,830 --> 02:08:16,090
I mean, the easiest way to find out is like when the VOD's over and we rewatch it.

3060
02:08:17,310 --> 02:08:20,110
Guys, I don't know what I've explored and what I haven't explored.

3061
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:24,450
Like, everything looks the same to me now.

3062
02:08:25,230 --> 02:08:26,610
Like, it's all blurring together.

3063
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:34,100
Everything's literally blurring together for me.

3064
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,400
I can't tell where I'm at and where I'm not at.

3065
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,600
Actually, I don't need that will.

3066
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:39,680
You can have that.

3067
02:08:48,210 --> 02:08:51,830
Now, YouTube's been like super weird lately though from what I've heard.

3068
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:55,790
Alright.

3069
02:08:57,250 --> 02:08:58,910
At least the stream quality looks good.

3070
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:01,590
Fuck.

3071
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:01,990
Okay.

3072
02:09:02,210 --> 02:09:04,070
I was not paying attention to my stamina.

3073
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:12,720
Alright, here we go.

3074
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:17,740
Oh, can I free that man?

3075
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,020
Alright, it's time to free that man.

3076
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:26,220
But also, I want free... I want the loot here too.

3077
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:28,220
Hello, I'm here for the loot.

3078
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:32,840
I know it's your loot, but I'm here for it.

3079
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:42,110
Maybe it's because my CPU is at... My CPU is though?

3080
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:42,870
Oh shit!

3081
02:09:42,950 --> 02:09:43,750
Oh shit!

3082
02:09:43,890 --> 02:09:44,570
Oh shit!

3083
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:47,190
Alright, give me a sec.

3084
02:09:48,690 --> 02:09:49,990
I'm gonna see what the ult is.

3085
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:52,470
My CPU is at 100.

3086
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:54,570
I'm not sure if that's causing stutters too.

3087
02:09:55,270 --> 02:09:56,230
Alright, come on.

3088
02:09:56,970 --> 02:09:57,410
Where's the ult?

3089
02:09:57,470 --> 02:09:58,250
How do I use the ult?

3090
02:09:58,350 --> 02:09:59,770
How do I use the ult, guys?

3091
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:01,390
How do I use it?

3092
02:10:02,610 --> 02:10:03,630
Oh, here it is.

3093
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:05,510
I figured it out.

3094
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:06,390
And then...

3095
02:10:07,630 --> 02:10:08,650
Is that the ult?

3096
02:10:09,850 --> 02:10:10,490
Is that it?

3097
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:11,830
Nice.

3098
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:19,340
I don't know.

3099
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:20,980
I don't know how to fix it.

3100
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:23,060
I'm not even streaming under CPU too.

3101
02:10:23,180 --> 02:10:23,820
That's the thing.

3102
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:26,000
I'm not streaming under...

3103
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,680
I'm using the video for my streaming for OBS.

3104
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:33,480
So, like, I don't know how to, like, lessen the CPU load.

3105
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:38,100
Because, like, I have...

3106
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:40,460
I think the issue also is that I have, like...

3107
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:48,620
I also have, like, you know, all my, like, VTuber stuff on.

3108
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:50,480
And everything.

3109
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:56,310
Check it.

3110
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:57,990
The game is using my graphics card.

3111
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:00,830
Well, shouldn't it be using my graphics card?

3112
02:11:00,830 --> 02:11:01,590
Like...

3113
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:09,090
No, I do not have 50 tabs open!

3114
02:11:11,670 --> 02:11:12,490
Get out!

3115
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:14,450
I did it!

3116
02:11:14,610 --> 02:11:16,530
I killed him!

3117
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:17,510
It's me!

3118
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:22,670
Wait,

3119
02:11:27,050 --> 02:11:28,030
you're captains?

3120
02:11:31,050 --> 02:11:31,810
I knew it!

3121
02:11:32,230 --> 02:11:32,570
Sam!

3122
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:39,350
You're not gonna say thank you?

3123
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:54,210
You're not gonna say thank you?

3124
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:02,490
Oh, you're blind?

3125
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:18,930
That's me!

3126
02:12:19,050 --> 02:12:20,330
I'm the chosen one!

3127
02:12:28,150 --> 02:12:28,590
Alright,

3128
02:12:33,110 --> 02:12:34,310
so we have to kill yellow bro.

3129
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:38,770
If I could, I'd end his suffering before he could even talk because he didn't even say thank you.

3130
02:12:42,690 --> 02:12:44,190
Alright, he's saying the same thing.

3131
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:46,870
Alright.

3132
02:12:48,690 --> 02:12:51,510
We gotta find the... where the fuck was the first shrine?

3133
02:12:54,210 --> 02:12:54,890
Like, where...

3134
02:12:55,790 --> 02:12:57,870
Okay, no.

3135
02:12:57,990 --> 02:13:00,690
This is the one time I use my item because I can't be bothered now.

3136
02:13:01,450 --> 02:13:02,950
I'm just like...

3137
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:04,050
This is too much.

3138
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:05,650
Oh, I never even took one of these!

3139
02:13:06,650 --> 02:13:07,110
Okay.

3140
02:13:07,950 --> 02:13:08,410
Alright.

3141
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:10,850
Let us take one.

3142
02:13:10,890 --> 02:13:12,090
I never even did this.

3143
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:12,890
I...

3144
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:14,770
Okay.

3145
02:13:15,790 --> 02:13:16,250
Alright.

3146
02:13:16,490 --> 02:13:18,250
I made the game a lot harder for myself.

3147
02:13:18,490 --> 02:13:18,770
Okay.

3148
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:23,910
Journey to the first move of...

3149
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:24,190
It's like...

3150
02:13:25,230 --> 02:13:27,850
Extends invincibility duration of the first move of all varied combos.

3151
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:28,970
Wait, which one do I get?

3152
02:13:29,610 --> 02:13:30,330
Whistling wind?

3153
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:31,290
Or...

3154
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:32,470
Or all ears?

3155
02:13:32,590 --> 02:13:34,550
I don't use the rock so, like, it doesn't matter.

3156
02:13:37,570 --> 02:13:38,150
Which one?

3157
02:13:38,210 --> 02:13:38,910
Whistling wind?

3158
02:13:39,150 --> 02:13:40,190
Or all ears?

3159
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:43,960
Three?

3160
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:45,260
Alright, three.

3161
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,180
Fluffy, thank you for the super chat!

3162
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:50,080
Thank you, thank you!

3163
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:54,300
Recently, I had my birthday so I decided to give you part of my gift for always brightening my mood!

3164
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:55,560
Thank you, doggie, for being there for me!

3165
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:57,020
Thank you for the super chat, Fluffy!

3166
02:13:57,140 --> 02:13:57,940
Thank you, thank you!

3167
02:13:58,060 --> 02:13:58,900
Happy birth...

3168
02:13:58,900 --> 02:13:59,140
Oh, wait.

3169
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:00,180
I was trying to use this.

3170
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:01,720
Happy birthday to you!

3171
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:03,480
Happy birthday to you!

3172
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:05,160
Happy birthday, dear Fluffy!

3173
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:06,620
Happy birthday to you!

3174
02:14:06,740 --> 02:14:06,980
Yeah!

3175
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:08,540
Instant transmission!

3176
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:09,980
Let's go.

3177
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:12,540
Alright.

3178
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:14,280
I think I looted enough.

3179
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,440
I can't be bothered to find more loot now.

3180
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:19,880
I don't know where else to go.

3181
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:21,580
I think I...

3182
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:22,260
Fuck it.

3183
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:22,800
I looted enough.

3184
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:24,840
I don't know.

3185
02:14:25,060 --> 02:14:25,540
I don't know.

3186
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:28,020
I've given up already trying to figure out where to go.

3187
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:29,840
Can't...

3188
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:30,520
I mean...

3189
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,220
We...

3190
02:14:32,780 --> 02:14:34,540
That must be all of it, right?

3191
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:35,300
Yeah.

3192
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:37,800
It's just like one or two...

3193
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,140
Two wills?

3194
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:46,620
There were a lot of purple lock cages.

3195
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:50,420
Yeah, I got...

3196
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:51,860
I'm pretty sure I got all of them.

3197
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,180
Yeah, totally.

3198
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:53,660
Definitely.

3199
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:54,240
Yeah.

3200
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:55,380
Yeah.

3201
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:57,240
Oh.

3202
02:14:57,860 --> 02:14:59,160
It's really pretty, though.

3203
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:01,660
I like the boss...

3204
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:03,820
The boss areas are like really pretty.

3205
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:07,320
I like how they have like their own separate arena, too.

3206
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,300
Yeah, I got the most important stuff.

3207
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:13,580
Guys, if I get more important stuff, I'd just be too strong.

3208
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:18,040
I'm trying to make it fair for the bosses.

3209
02:15:20,380 --> 02:15:22,600
I'd just be too strong and it'll be just too easy.

3210
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:27,890
I think the game so far...

3211
02:15:27,890 --> 02:15:28,490
It's been really fun.

3212
02:15:28,710 --> 02:15:29,950
I've definitely been enjoying it a lot.

3213
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:34,440
Alright.

3214
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:35,240
This way.

3215
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:38,860
This way.

3216
02:15:38,980 --> 02:15:39,800
Off I go.

3217
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:44,770
What is this?

3218
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:47,610
It's an open area, so...

3219
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:48,470
Is there gonna be monsters?

3220
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:50,970
I get this chest for free?

3221
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:53,170
Nothing's ever for free.

3222
02:15:53,570 --> 02:15:54,450
What's the catch?

3223
02:15:54,890 --> 02:15:56,130
What's the fucking catch?

3224
02:16:01,070 --> 02:16:01,590
Huh.

3225
02:16:02,270 --> 02:16:03,010
Oh, wait.

3226
02:16:03,010 --> 02:16:04,030
I do get it for free.

3227
02:16:04,090 --> 02:16:05,230
I guess there is no catch.

3228
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:06,550
Free loot.

3229
02:16:07,450 --> 02:16:08,370
That's so...

3230
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:09,430
That's so weird.

3231
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:11,390
I'm not used to free loot.

3232
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:13,950
Oh?

3233
02:16:14,090 --> 02:16:14,750
Alright, this way.

3234
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:19,070
Oh, there's Will, though.

3235
02:16:20,030 --> 02:16:21,410
Free Will, as well?

3236
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:23,570
Is it...

3237
02:16:23,570 --> 02:16:24,850
Is it Wukong's birthday?

3238
02:16:28,190 --> 02:16:28,970
I wonder.

3239
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:31,610
This is not fair!

3240
02:16:31,910 --> 02:16:34,090
Why can't I jump off the tree?

3241
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:34,930
Yeah, but the...

3242
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:35,910
Like...

3243
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:36,370
It's...

3244
02:16:37,010 --> 02:16:39,270
Like, of course I didn't think there was fall damage!

3245
02:16:39,770 --> 02:16:41,910
It wouldn't let me do fall damage!

3246
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:43,610
Like...

3247
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:44,690
No...

3248
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:47,090
Alright.

3249
02:16:50,470 --> 02:16:50,990
Nice.

3250
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:55,390
Lack of mimics is often disappointing.

3251
02:16:56,370 --> 02:16:57,850
There is a lot of mimics.

3252
02:16:57,930 --> 02:17:02,570
I just don't bother grabbing the plants anymore because I don't use the items anyway.

3253
02:17:02,570 --> 02:17:05,490
I don't grab the items.

3254
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:07,430
So I don't grab...

3255
02:17:07,430 --> 02:17:08,570
It's like it's these things...

3256
02:17:09,810 --> 02:17:11,210
I don't even...

3257
02:17:11,210 --> 02:17:12,790
I don't even grab...

3258
02:17:13,130 --> 02:17:13,810
Like, use it.

3259
02:17:18,110 --> 02:17:18,710
Alright.

3260
02:17:19,470 --> 02:17:20,570
Potions are OP.

3261
02:17:20,990 --> 02:17:22,810
I don't need potions.

3262
02:17:23,490 --> 02:17:24,850
Let me just grab this though.

3263
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:30,550
I don't think I've used a single potion yet.

3264
02:17:34,350 --> 02:17:35,550
Oh shit.

3265
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:37,270
Because I'm lazy.

3266
02:17:37,950 --> 02:17:39,450
That's way too many buttons.

3267
02:17:39,530 --> 02:17:40,090
That's like...

3268
02:17:40,090 --> 02:17:43,030
That's an extra button input that I don't want to do.

3269
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:46,990
If I'm still killing them, does it really matter?

3270
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:51,290
Does it really matter if I'm still killing the monsters?

3271
02:17:54,610 --> 02:17:58,670
Yeah, I'm hoarding all my potions for the final fight.

3272
02:17:58,770 --> 02:17:59,350
Chat.

3273
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:01,230
Don't worry.

3274
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:04,970
That final fight where I use all my potions, it'll be worth it.

3275
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,480
Oh, nice.

3276
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:11,700
Maximum mana.

3277
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:12,400
I like that.

3278
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:17,940
Yeah, I'm saving them for Wukong too.

3279
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:21,940
Let's see.

3280
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:23,660
Obviously.

3281
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:26,960
Y'all get out of the snow first so it doesn't matter for me.

3282
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:28,860
I have plenty of time to charge it up.

3283
02:18:28,900 --> 02:18:30,020
And then you have to grab your knife too.

3284
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:34,600
That was worth it.

3285
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:38,660
Cyber, thank you for the super chat.

3286
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:39,060
Thank you.

3287
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:43,140
My birthday was yesterday but I couldn't catch yesterday's stream.

3288
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:46,660
Could I get a birthday shoutout from my OSHA?

3289
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:47,520
Of course, Cyber!

3290
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:49,760
Happy birthday to you.

3291
02:18:50,020 --> 02:18:51,680
Happy birthday to you.

3292
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:53,680
Happy birthday, dear Cyber.

3293
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:55,540
Happy birthday to you.

3294
02:18:56,040 --> 02:19:01,000
Look at these fools.

3295
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,760
Just standing there.

3296
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:08,500
Look at these fools.

3297
02:19:08,660 --> 02:19:10,180
Just standing there.

3298
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:11,200
Look at these fools.

3299
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:11,560
Just standing there.

3300
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,300
So Pokeball!

3301
02:19:17,900 --> 02:19:18,500
Alright.

3302
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:21,360
Is there anything up here?

3303
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,380
Oh shit, what the fuck.

3304
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:26,120
There's a lot of stuff over here.

3305
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:27,940
There's a lot.

3306
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:30,540
Alright, one by one.

3307
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:33,210
Get all that willpower.

3308
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:36,880
Alright.

3309
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:38,280
I'll get you too.

3310
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:40,180
That's fucking right.

3311
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:41,380
You thought I could do anything?

3312
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:42,680
That's right.

3313
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:44,020
Oh shit.

3314
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:44,660
Oh, I keep forgetting.

3315
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:46,060
Hey, what's this?

3316
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:47,800
You're protecting the tree pearl.

3317
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:50,240
Yeah, yoink mine now.

3318
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:53,020
Should protect it better.

3319
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,260
Andrew, thank you for the super chat.

3320
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:57,020
Thank you, thank you.

3321
02:19:57,020 --> 02:20:00,800
So what you're saying is saving your suffering wasn't worth one extra button click?

3322
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:02,000
Oh, no.

3323
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:05,320
Doki, no.

3324
02:20:05,480 --> 02:20:07,360
Andrew, thank you for the super chat.

3325
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:08,120
Thank you, thank you.

3326
02:20:08,420 --> 02:20:09,980
I'm just a gamer.

3327
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:11,620
Oh shit.

3328
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:13,420
What's wrong with your head?

3329
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:16,500
I think you gotta get that checked out, man.

3330
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:18,100
Like, I don't think that's normal.

3331
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:19,620
Bro, I think...

3332
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:21,740
Bro, you need to get that checked out, bro.

3333
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:25,560
Bro, you need to get that checked out, bro.

3334
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:26,100
Hey, don't worry.

3335
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:26,580
I got you.

3336
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:28,320
And your suffering.

3337
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:29,240
I'll check it.

3338
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:30,340
I'll pop it.

3339
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:31,200
I'll pop the pimple.

3340
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:35,860
Alright, what kind of yaoguai was that?

3341
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:36,240
Alright, what kind of yaoguai was that?

3342
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:37,440
Oh, hey, seeds.

3343
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:41,000
Huh.

3344
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:42,340
I killed it before?

3345
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:44,820
I killed giant pimple man?

3346
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:45,220
I killed giant pimple man?

3347
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:50,020
I killed giant pimple man before.

3348
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:50,620
I killed giant pimple man before.

3349
02:20:53,580 --> 02:20:54,060
Alright.

3350
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:55,080
Don't worry.

3351
02:20:55,180 --> 02:20:55,980
Charging it up.

3352
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:02,480
No, I wasn't talking about his bald head.

3353
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:05,800
I was talking about the giant fucking tumor on the top of his head.

3354
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:09,100
I was talking about the giant fucking tumor on the top of his head.

3355
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:12,280
That was what I was focused on.

3356
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:15,040
Oh, okay.

3357
02:21:19,330 --> 02:21:19,810
Alright.

3358
02:21:19,950 --> 02:21:22,270
There's that guy that the journal said he was ugly.

3359
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:22,710
There's that guy that the journal said he was ugly.

3360
02:21:24,870 --> 02:21:25,510
He was ugly too.

3361
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:28,370
That's just his bald head.

3362
02:21:28,470 --> 02:21:29,550
It's not a tumor.

3363
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:32,990
That's worse.

3364
02:21:33,570 --> 02:21:36,190
I was just telling you to get it checked out.

3365
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:39,390
That wasn't that worse.

3366
02:21:39,750 --> 02:21:41,690
I was concerned about his health.

3367
02:21:45,070 --> 02:21:46,370
Poke the guy.

3368
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:48,250
Alright, nice.

3369
02:21:50,430 --> 02:21:52,370
I'll hydrate real fast, too.

3370
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:54,090
Oh, and there's extra will!

3371
02:21:59,310 --> 02:21:59,790
Yay!

3372
02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:01,610
Will time!

3373
02:22:06,450 --> 02:22:06,930
Alright.

3374
02:22:08,330 --> 02:22:09,210
Oh, this way.

3375
02:22:10,410 --> 02:22:11,730
Wait, but what's over here?

3376
02:22:12,330 --> 02:22:12,810
Nothing.

3377
02:22:12,970 --> 02:22:13,590
Okay, never mind.

3378
02:22:14,130 --> 02:22:14,790
This way!

3379
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:20,220
Thank you for the super chat!

3380
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:20,520
Thank you!

3381
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:24,560
Reparation funds from Malaysia due to our 50-0 loss yesterday.

3382
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:27,540
Thanks for making me smile during the convention at home, Doki!

3383
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:30,120
And yes, I bought the merch at the con!

3384
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,160
Thank you for the super chat!

3385
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:32,220
Thank you, thank you!

3386
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:35,200
I'm glad you were there to witness...

3387
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:36,120
um...

3388
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:40,780
public humiliation on the dragon.

3389
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,560
Witness me!

3390
02:22:48,340 --> 02:22:49,940
Thank you for the super chat!

3391
02:22:50,020 --> 02:22:50,400
Thank you!

3392
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:53,740
Bro!

3393
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:57,120
Wait, wait.

3394
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,380
There's people going up the stairs, so I'm gonna go backwards.

3395
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:02,220
Yes!

3396
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:06,680
Now what's over here?

3397
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:07,640
Is it a boss?

3398
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:11,420
What's over here?

3399
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:15,940
Wait, what?

3400
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,440
Is this the right way, or is this the extra way?

3401
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:24,460
Alright, nice.

3402
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:26,360
Willpower.

3403
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:27,580
Will!

3404
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:32,380
Is this the right way, or is this the side way?

3405
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:33,620
Is it an extra way?

3406
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:35,860
I'm glad.

3407
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:36,960
I'm glad you guys were entertained.

3408
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:41,660
At first, I was like, should I grant a little bit of mercy?

3409
02:23:42,140 --> 02:23:43,080
And I was like, nah.

3410
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:44,840
No mercy.

3411
02:23:48,020 --> 02:23:51,740
Alright, let's see.

3412
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:54,660
Reduce the stamina, jump.

3413
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:58,040
I don't know what to upgrade every time.

3414
02:23:58,180 --> 02:23:58,780
I'm just...

3415
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:03,480
I'm literally just doing it as I go along.

3416
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:08,880
Let's see.

3417
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:11,420
I guess staff stances?

3418
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:13,200
I'm using this a lot, so...

3419
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:13,840
Maybe?

3420
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:15,920
Alright.

3421
02:24:23,410 --> 02:24:24,090
Alright.

3422
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:25,110
First time!

3423
02:24:27,470 --> 02:24:27,810
Boom!

3424
02:24:27,810 --> 02:24:28,510
Oh.

3425
02:24:29,350 --> 02:24:30,330
He's like way far.

3426
02:24:30,430 --> 02:24:31,110
He's way too far.

3427
02:24:32,770 --> 02:24:33,490
First time!

3428
02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:39,950
Go stairs first?

3429
02:24:40,070 --> 02:24:40,790
It's a bit shorter?

3430
02:24:41,350 --> 02:24:41,790
Oh!

3431
02:24:41,890 --> 02:24:42,710
I thought this was extra!

3432
02:24:44,150 --> 02:24:46,010
I thought this was like the bonus area.

3433
02:24:46,710 --> 02:24:47,530
Alright, I'll go back.

3434
02:24:49,550 --> 02:24:52,710
I couldn't tell which was bonus and which was like part of the...

3435
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:54,430
which is like the main storyline.

3436
02:24:56,230 --> 02:24:57,070
Alright, I'll go up.

3437
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:02,300
Up we go.

3438
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:04,900
Boop!

3439
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:06,820
Boop!

3440
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:07,760
Boop!

3441
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:08,960
Boop!

3442
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:12,900
Alright, what's over here?

3443
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:14,660
Oh, gather!

3444
02:25:15,640 --> 02:25:17,780
More materials that I'm never gonna use!

3445
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:20,540
Oh no.

3446
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:22,520
Oh no, I don't like this.

3447
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:24,960
Guys, I don't like this.

3448
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:26,560
Cause like...

3449
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:28,140
There's a lot of pathways.

3450
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,000
I might be lost.

3451
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:34,620
Not another instance already?

3452
02:25:39,490 --> 02:25:40,090
Thrust.

3453
02:25:40,990 --> 02:25:42,490
Might be stuff over here.

3454
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:44,110
Alright.

3455
02:25:45,330 --> 02:25:46,090
That's okay.

3456
02:25:46,330 --> 02:25:49,490
Cause I get a little bit closer...

3457
02:25:50,310 --> 02:25:50,910
Boop!

3458
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:52,190
Oh shit, you lived.

3459
02:25:52,390 --> 02:25:53,670
That's not part of the plan.

3460
02:25:55,950 --> 02:25:57,270
You're not supposed to live.

3461
02:26:00,690 --> 02:26:01,890
Alright, whatever.

3462
02:26:01,890 --> 02:26:03,330
You know what?

3463
02:26:04,070 --> 02:26:05,770
I'm just gonna beat you up regular style.

3464
02:26:06,610 --> 02:26:07,370
That's right.

3465
02:26:08,390 --> 02:26:08,950
Congratulations!

3466
02:26:09,090 --> 02:26:10,770
You get the regular beat-em-up.

3467
02:26:12,270 --> 02:26:13,810
That's like extra will too.

3468
02:26:14,450 --> 02:26:15,590
What if I'm like...

3469
02:26:15,590 --> 02:26:17,610
If I'm missing any like...

3470
02:26:17,610 --> 02:26:18,470
loot.

3471
02:26:18,850 --> 02:26:20,670
Cause it's such an open area.

3472
02:26:21,770 --> 02:26:23,530
But like, there's nothing here.

3473
02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:30,690
Such an open area but like literally nothing.

3474
02:26:32,850 --> 02:26:33,370
Yay!

3475
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:35,610
Oh, I got beads!

3476
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:37,350
Nice.

3477
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:41,790
Oh, I should have used those guys as landmarks.

3478
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:42,310
I'm already...

3479
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:43,190
Wait, what the...

3480
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:44,670
What the fuck is that?

3481
02:26:47,170 --> 02:26:47,690
What?

3482
02:26:49,150 --> 02:26:50,970
Now nature hates me?

3483
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:52,690
Lolis, why?

3484
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:54,850
What did I do to nature?

3485
02:26:55,850 --> 02:26:59,730
Other than like burning a couple of plants, what did I do to nature?

3486
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:08,220
Wait, this guy has a different pose.

3487
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:11,740
Alright.

3488
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:12,480
Nice.

3489
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:18,480
I should have used these... I need to use these guys as landmarks cause I'm actually really confused.

3490
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:19,480
Like...

3491
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:21,980
I'm like...

3492
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:23,440
I'm a little bit...

3493
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:25,860
Like... I'm very...

3494
02:27:25,860 --> 02:27:27,020
Not even a little bit.

3495
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:27,860
I'm very confused.

3496
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:32,020
I'm actually very confused.

3497
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:34,140
It's just all...

3498
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:35,120
It's all snow.

3499
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,660
Snow is like the sand of winter.

3500
02:27:43,830 --> 02:27:45,370
Oh, there's a chest.

3501
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:50,010
Thank god.

3502
02:27:50,670 --> 02:27:51,650
Snowland.

3503
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:56,370
Nice loot.

3504
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:02,980
Alright.

3505
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:05,460
Oh, where am I?

3506
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:08,740
Which way was I heading towards?

3507
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:10,840
Is it here?

3508
02:28:11,260 --> 02:28:12,600
Wait, he's not frozen.

3509
02:28:13,620 --> 02:28:14,320
That's illegal.

3510
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:17,940
They said in the snow...

3511
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:18,500
Oh shit!

3512
02:28:18,620 --> 02:28:18,860
Okay.

3513
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:24,020
I was told that everybody in Snowland had to be frozen.

3514
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:26,960
You're not a native at Snowland.

3515
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:28,820
Oh fuck man.

3516
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:30,060
I still don't know your patterns.

3517
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:33,940
You die so fast that I never bothered learning your combos.

3518
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:37,480
Alright.

3519
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:39,500
Wait, you again?

3520
02:28:40,060 --> 02:28:41,080
That's fucking right.

3521
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:41,740
We used a baby.

3522
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:44,560
You're too strong to be left there.

3523
02:28:44,980 --> 02:28:46,200
Wait, do they respawn?

3524
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:47,200
They don't, right?

3525
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:50,180
They're like the eagles.

3526
02:28:50,220 --> 02:28:51,140
They don't respawn.

3527
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:54,560
It's alright.

3528
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:57,460
Nice.

3529
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:01,240
Fuck.

3530
02:29:01,660 --> 02:29:02,060
Okay, you.

3531
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:03,140
Get out.

3532
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:04,460
Get out of my lobby.

3533
02:29:05,580 --> 02:29:06,020
Yay!

3534
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:06,560
Absorb!

3535
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:13,800
Okay, we gotta get rid of the Lotus.

3536
02:29:17,580 --> 02:29:23,000
You know, it's nice though because I feel like this is the longest I haven't had to fight a boss.

3537
02:29:23,560 --> 02:29:24,660
Which is pretty nice.

3538
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:28,620
I forgot what that was like.

3539
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:30,760
Just exploring.

3540
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:39,200
This has been the longest since I get to actually not fight a boss.

3541
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:41,660
Alright, goodbye.

3542
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:43,060
There's your mimic.

3543
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:44,700
You know what?

3544
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:44,900
No.

3545
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:45,660
Fuck it.

3546
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:48,900
I forgot they were pretty tanky.

3547
02:29:48,900 --> 02:29:50,220
It's been so long since I fought a mimic.

3548
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:53,600
I read that out of tanky they were.

3549
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:55,960
Holy shit.

3550
02:29:56,840 --> 02:29:57,360
Alright.

3551
02:30:00,760 --> 02:30:01,440
Where am I?

3552
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:05,420
You again?

3553
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:06,640
You're still here?

3554
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:07,960
Oh shit!

3555
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:12,500
Okay.

3556
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:13,480
That's fine.

3557
02:30:14,190 --> 02:30:15,020
That's fine.

3558
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:17,560
We're gonna use the heavy attack.

3559
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:18,520
Boom.

3560
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:19,940
Boom.

3561
02:30:20,580 --> 02:30:21,940
Okay, nevermind.

3562
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:25,240
I don't feel as fine anymore.

3563
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:28,200
I don't feel as fine.

3564
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:29,700
Nevermind.

3565
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:31,060
It's...

3566
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:33,500
He's extra strong.

3567
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:35,480
That's fucking right.

3568
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:36,100
No.

3569
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:38,500
I don't have enough mana now.

3570
02:30:38,740 --> 02:30:39,320
It's okay.

3571
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:41,620
Wow!

3572
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:42,320
What did you do?

3573
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:42,740
What are you doing?

3574
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:44,360
What are you doing, Wukong?

3575
02:30:46,340 --> 02:30:47,440
What are you doing, monkey?

3576
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:50,700
There you go.

3577
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:52,440
Easy.

3578
02:30:53,860 --> 02:30:55,540
I don't know why he paused there.

3579
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:02,520
I have no idea why.

3580
02:31:02,700 --> 02:31:03,480
What the fuck?

3581
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,400
Bro, I was fucking absorbing.

3582
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:08,240
You don't just stop a man from absorbing!

3583
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:10,460
That's rude!

3584
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:13,560
Boop!

3585
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:17,740
Alright.

3586
02:31:18,060 --> 02:31:19,860
You can't just stop a monkey, man!

3587
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,660
When he is absorbing, you just can't stop!

3588
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:27,400
He's monkeying around.

3589
02:31:30,380 --> 02:31:31,800
That's fucking rude!

3590
02:31:36,460 --> 02:31:37,400
Where am I?

3591
02:31:41,690 --> 02:31:43,150
Did I go in a circle?

3592
02:31:44,310 --> 02:31:45,430
No, this is new.

3593
02:31:46,090 --> 02:31:47,030
No, this is new.

3594
02:31:47,110 --> 02:31:47,610
This is new.

3595
02:31:49,510 --> 02:31:50,170
This is new.

3596
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:52,310
Thank god.

3597
02:31:52,370 --> 02:31:52,650
Okay.

3598
02:31:53,270 --> 02:31:56,270
I was worried because I saw all the bridges.

3599
02:31:56,470 --> 02:31:57,210
Oh my god, please.

3600
02:31:59,210 --> 02:32:01,750
I was a little worried there because I was like, oh no.

3601
02:32:05,570 --> 02:32:06,970
Yeah, I brute-forced that one.

3602
02:32:08,330 --> 02:32:09,270
Oh, it's an item!

3603
02:32:10,730 --> 02:32:11,330
It's an item!

3604
02:32:12,010 --> 02:32:12,490
Tumor man!

3605
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:18,990
Boop!

3606
02:32:20,090 --> 02:32:20,870
Big baby.

3607
02:32:22,070 --> 02:32:22,910
I need your loot!

3608
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:25,650
I know this is your loot, but I need it!

3609
02:32:26,490 --> 02:32:27,290
Oh shit!

3610
02:32:27,990 --> 02:32:29,870
Don't worry, maybe I don't need it!

3611
02:32:30,130 --> 02:32:31,290
Maybe I don't need it!

3612
02:32:31,370 --> 02:32:32,090
I'm so sorry!

3613
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:33,250
I am so sorry!

3614
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:34,510
Haha, JK!

3615
02:32:37,850 --> 02:32:40,330
Wait, is it actually stuttering like crazy now?

3616
02:32:41,010 --> 02:32:42,710
Maybe I'll turn down the graphics.

3617
02:32:45,290 --> 02:32:46,350
Or is anybody...

3618
02:32:46,350 --> 02:32:47,050
Is it just...

3619
02:32:47,650 --> 02:32:48,910
Is it everybody?

3620
02:32:52,430 --> 02:32:52,910
Oh...

3621
02:32:55,330 --> 02:32:55,810
Alright.

3622
02:33:01,030 --> 02:33:02,030
It's getting worse.

3623
02:33:02,150 --> 02:33:03,310
Oh, it has to be YouTube?

3624
02:33:04,730 --> 02:33:05,210
Oh...

3625
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:08,210
Oh, not my fault?

3626
02:33:08,290 --> 02:33:08,830
Oh, thank god.

3627
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:09,110
Okay.

3628
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:12,490
Hahaha!

3629
02:33:13,090 --> 02:33:13,710
Okay.

3630
02:33:13,970 --> 02:33:15,030
Oh, thank god.

3631
02:33:15,250 --> 02:33:18,350
I feel like it's always...

3632
02:33:18,350 --> 02:33:19,470
I never know.

3633
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:21,390
I always think it's my fault.

3634
02:33:21,610 --> 02:33:22,230
Hahaha!

3635
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:25,490
Oh, thank god.

3636
02:33:26,050 --> 02:33:26,670
Oh...

3637
02:33:26,670 --> 02:33:27,870
Hahaha!

3638
02:33:29,730 --> 02:33:31,570
Oh, not me.

3639
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:32,610
Thank god.

3640
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:35,650
I knew it's never my fault.

3641
02:33:36,070 --> 02:33:36,690
Hahaha!

3642
02:33:36,690 --> 02:33:36,890
Hahaha!

3643
02:33:38,790 --> 02:33:42,310
I always have so many problems.

3644
02:33:42,670 --> 02:33:43,270
Hahaha!

3645
02:33:43,710 --> 02:33:44,390
Hahaha!

3646
02:33:44,990 --> 02:33:47,230
I always have so many problems.

3647
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:49,130
I assume it's always my fault.

3648
02:33:49,490 --> 02:33:50,170
Hahaha!

3649
02:33:51,470 --> 02:33:52,690
There's a horseman?

3650
02:33:52,970 --> 02:33:54,550
I'm fucking lost.

3651
02:33:58,870 --> 02:33:59,950
Alright, nice.

3652
02:34:00,990 --> 02:34:05,590
Wait, I think I actually hate this map more than the sand map.

3653
02:34:05,770 --> 02:34:06,550
Hahaha!

3654
02:34:06,550 --> 02:34:07,130
Hahaha!

3655
02:34:11,910 --> 02:34:13,310
I think...

3656
02:34:13,310 --> 02:34:14,630
I think I actually...

3657
02:34:14,630 --> 02:34:18,770
I think I actually do hate this map more than the sand map.

3658
02:34:19,050 --> 02:34:21,230
I'm so fucking lost.

3659
02:34:21,790 --> 02:34:22,390
Hahaha!

3660
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:30,520
I'm lost in the mountains.

3661
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,460
Please somebody...

3662
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:35,100
They're gonna make a documentary about me.

3663
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:36,100
Hahaha!

3664
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:36,300
Hahaha!

3665
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:39,140
And not the one where I survive.

3666
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:40,300
Hahaha!

3667
02:34:45,850 --> 02:34:46,610
Alright.

3668
02:34:47,230 --> 02:34:47,990
Nice.

3669
02:34:48,930 --> 02:34:50,150
What the fuck?

3670
02:34:50,750 --> 02:34:52,950
Wait, where... where does this go?

3671
02:34:54,190 --> 02:34:54,950
Or...

3672
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:55,270
What?

3673
02:34:58,660 --> 02:34:59,040
What?

3674
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:03,960
Where am I?

3675
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:07,540
What the fuck am I?

3676
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:08,420
Hahaha!

3677
02:35:08,420 --> 02:35:09,800
Where am I?

3678
02:35:12,950 --> 02:35:13,710
Alright.

3679
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:18,160
Wait.

3680
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:19,100
Upgrade my stuff?

3681
02:35:19,300 --> 02:35:20,220
Do I have new upgrades?

3682
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:21,700
No, I don't.

3683
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:22,180
No, wait!

3684
02:35:23,140 --> 02:35:24,480
I finally have enough money!

3685
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:25,900
Oh my god, I finally have enough money.

3686
02:35:25,980 --> 02:35:26,200
Okay.

3687
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:27,780
Nice.

3688
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,300
And I have a 6% critical chance now.

3689
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:33,980
Now I have the ice spear.

3690
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:37,320
Okay.

3691
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:39,080
I don't have new armor yet in a while.

3692
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:42,080
Alright.

3693
02:35:46,370 --> 02:35:46,810
Hello.

3694
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:54,750
Oh, is this like the werebear?

3695
02:35:54,990 --> 02:35:55,710
Hahaha!

3696
02:35:57,490 --> 02:35:59,210
He has the circle.

3697
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:05,930
Oh, shit!

3698
02:36:06,070 --> 02:36:06,590
Wait, what?

3699
02:36:08,830 --> 02:36:09,550
Baby!

3700
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:14,390
The weremonkey!

3701
02:36:14,830 --> 02:36:15,810
Oh, shit!

3702
02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:16,770
He has the wings!

3703
02:36:18,390 --> 02:36:19,470
Stop faking it!

3704
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:21,810
Why don't I get the...

3705
02:36:21,810 --> 02:36:23,530
He has poison?!

3706
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:25,670
Bro, pick one thing!

3707
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:26,690
Why are you everything?

3708
02:36:27,110 --> 02:36:27,710
That's not fair!

3709
02:36:28,190 --> 02:36:28,830
Hahaha!

3710
02:36:30,150 --> 02:36:31,290
That's not fair!

3711
02:36:31,970 --> 02:36:33,990
You can't give me a fucking bat!

3712
02:36:34,530 --> 02:36:36,870
A bat poison monkey!

3713
02:36:39,010 --> 02:36:39,690
Okay.

3714
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:45,420
Powerups!

3715
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:48,820
Oh, god.

3716
02:36:48,940 --> 02:36:50,540
Oh, I need a fucking heal.

3717
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:52,200
I need it.

3718
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:52,880
Thank god.

3719
02:36:56,300 --> 02:36:57,060
Fake monkey!

3720
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:59,880
How dare you be a fake monkey!

3721
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:02,300
Oh, god.

3722
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:03,160
Alright.

3723
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:04,960
Boom!

3724
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:05,900
That's fucking right.

3725
02:37:06,120 --> 02:37:06,680
Whoa!

3726
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:07,240
Whoa!

3727
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:08,020
Don't worry.

3728
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:08,480
Freeze!

3729
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:10,840
And then you should be...

3730
02:37:11,420 --> 02:37:11,980
dead.

3731
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:14,280
Oh, now you're dead.

3732
02:37:15,740 --> 02:37:16,620
He's a freak.

3733
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:19,960
This is why...

3734
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:22,780
This is why you're no longer accepted the monkey circle.

3735
02:37:23,140 --> 02:37:25,260
This is why.

3736
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:27,020
Every other monkey picked one.

3737
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:28,280
This is why.

3738
02:37:28,280 --> 02:37:29,600
I was the magic monkey.

3739
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:32,100
But you picked too many monkey!

3740
02:37:32,820 --> 02:37:35,780
But you picked too many monkey!

3741
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:36,860
Friend?

3742
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:40,360
How are we friends?

3743
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:46,500
The bat is right in front of you.

3744
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:47,540
From Monkeyland.

3745
02:37:58,260 --> 02:37:59,620
Oh my god, I'm in the circle.

3746
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:03,500
Now the... now the weird monkey can't come in.

3747
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:06,880
Oh, it was Destiny?

3748
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:24,260
Oh, am I gonna get fire power?

3749
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:34,020
Oh my god, I got the power of fire!

3750
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:38,260
And probably rapid recovery within it.

3751
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:40,260
Wait, what spell is that though?

3752
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:43,460
What spell is that?

3753
02:38:45,940 --> 02:38:47,320
Which one does it replace?

3754
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:52,320
Okay, it could be cool, but like...

3755
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:54,560
What spell does that replace though?

3756
02:38:56,340 --> 02:38:57,740
That's what I'm worried about.

3757
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:01,520
Oh, it replaces freeze time?

3758
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:02,260
Alright, nah.

3759
02:39:05,740 --> 02:39:06,300
Man.

3760
02:39:06,900 --> 02:39:09,260
I guess we'll never know how that works.

3761
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:13,640
That's unfortunate.

3762
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:16,420
We'll never know what it looks like, guys.

3763
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:19,440
Feels bad.

3764
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:26,100
Yeah, I think the stun is too good.

3765
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:28,500
Guys, the stun is meta!

3766
02:39:32,340 --> 02:39:34,300
What the fuck am I gonna do with fire?

3767
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:39,580
Alright, up I go.

3768
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:43,440
I can't believe we'll never see the fire.

3769
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:45,920
Other than the ones in the map.

3770
02:39:48,300 --> 02:39:49,900
Do be like that.

3771
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:51,160
It heals.

3772
02:39:52,820 --> 02:39:54,280
Yeah, but like...

3773
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:55,800
We're here to fight.

3774
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:00,720
Wow.

3775
02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:03,380
I mean, the stun is fun!

3776
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:04,660
The stun is also fun!

3777
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:06,480
The stun makes me summon big baby!

3778
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:09,760
Big baby is always fun.

3779
02:40:14,290 --> 02:40:16,510
It equals more fighting.

3780
02:40:16,850 --> 02:40:18,990
But stun equals die fast!

3781
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:26,920
Big baby go burn!

3782
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:27,460
No, I can't.

3783
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:39,930
War.

3784
02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:40,390
Look at the number of tanks.

3785
02:40:40,390 --> 02:40:41,070
It's $3 ,000.

3786
02:40:41,270 --> 02:40:42,850
It's $1,000.

3787
02:40:43,490 --> 02:40:46,970
No, it's not.

3788
02:40:46,970 --> 02:40:48,470
It's like half a million oxen.

3789
02:40:48,590 --> 02:40:51,930
Or I wish it were a million oxen.

3790
02:40:51,930 --> 02:40:51,950
It's one lot.

3791
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:52,550
But it's in a million.

3792
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:59,770
If it's in a million, it would be a million, right?

3793
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:00,190
Yeah.

3794
02:41:00,190 --> 02:41:00,670
Uh, I don't know.

3795
02:41:00,670 --> 02:41:00,910
Alright.

3796
02:41:01,070 --> 02:41:02,190
Then I'll start the fight.

3797
02:41:02,190 --> 02:41:02,230
I want a battle, not a fight.

3798
02:41:02,230 --> 02:41:02,930
I'm going to win this battle.

3799
02:41:11,170 --> 02:41:12,710
Wait, he knows where the relic is.

3800
02:41:20,650 --> 02:41:21,790
That's right, I did that.

3801
02:41:32,290 --> 02:41:34,110
Hey, I'm not that small.

3802
02:41:37,070 --> 02:41:38,330
I'm not that small.

3803
02:41:40,550 --> 02:41:45,110
All the other monkeys say that that is an average monkey height.

3804
02:42:02,640 --> 02:42:03,240
Oh.

3805
02:42:04,020 --> 02:42:05,320
Oh, is this those like...

3806
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:06,840
Oh, is there those turtles?

3807
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:09,380
Yeah, the turtles with the ladder on top.

3808
02:42:23,690 --> 02:42:24,130
Basement!

3809
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:25,950
I'm sorry, I'll take a bath soon!

3810
02:42:31,950 --> 02:42:38,570
I know I should have taken a bath earlier when the first guy said I was stinky, but like...

3811
02:42:39,170 --> 02:42:41,550
There's so many fighting going on!

3812
02:42:43,030 --> 02:42:44,470
The new west.

3813
02:42:49,290 --> 02:42:50,870
Try my best, lady!

3814
02:42:52,470 --> 02:42:53,910
Oh my gosh, I have no...

3815
02:42:53,910 --> 02:42:55,330
I didn't even get a chance to rest.

3816
02:42:55,870 --> 02:42:57,650
Like, I went straight into the...

3817
02:42:58,100 --> 02:42:59,650
Oh, she grabbed me.

3818
02:42:59,990 --> 02:43:01,610
Oh my god, lady grabbed me.

3819
02:43:02,030 --> 02:43:03,590
I don't think I can one-shot this.

3820
02:43:03,710 --> 02:43:05,330
I didn't even have a chance to rest at all.

3821
02:43:05,630 --> 02:43:07,910
I just went straight into the fighting.

3822
02:43:09,170 --> 02:43:09,490
Holy shit.

3823
02:43:09,710 --> 02:43:10,650
Big baby!

3824
02:43:12,230 --> 02:43:13,310
That's fucking right.

3825
02:43:13,470 --> 02:43:15,690
And I didn't even need to freeze you.

3826
02:43:17,910 --> 02:43:18,570
Oh, fuck!

3827
02:43:18,690 --> 02:43:18,970
Okay.

3828
02:43:20,850 --> 02:43:22,810
Wait, he's back?!

3829
02:43:22,810 --> 02:43:25,010
It was you?!

3830
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:30,670
Wait, there's no way you were the dragon?!

3831
02:43:31,410 --> 02:43:32,950
Oh, not you again.

3832
02:43:34,810 --> 02:43:36,230
Oh god, not her.

3833
02:43:36,970 --> 02:43:37,790
Not again.

3834
02:43:40,170 --> 02:43:40,650
Alright.

3835
02:43:41,570 --> 02:43:42,290
Big attack!

3836
02:43:42,570 --> 02:43:43,210
Big attack!

3837
02:43:43,830 --> 02:43:44,310
Oh.

3838
02:43:45,310 --> 02:43:48,350
If I stand in the center, I won't get hurt, right?!

3839
02:43:50,310 --> 02:43:51,690
That's usually what they say.

3840
02:43:53,990 --> 02:43:54,470
Whoa.

3841
02:43:55,190 --> 02:43:55,670
Whoa!

3842
02:43:56,770 --> 02:43:57,490
That's fine.

3843
02:43:58,890 --> 02:44:00,330
Oh, that's not fine anymore.

3844
02:44:00,370 --> 02:44:00,770
Never mind.

3845
02:44:01,170 --> 02:44:01,910
Never mind.

3846
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:04,970
Oh, he doesn't know where I am.

3847
02:44:07,310 --> 02:44:08,850
Where could I be?

3848
02:44:09,110 --> 02:44:10,070
Please come down.

3849
02:44:10,210 --> 02:44:10,750
Please.

3850
02:44:10,850 --> 02:44:11,790
What are you...

3851
02:44:11,790 --> 02:44:13,010
What are you doing?!

3852
02:44:13,730 --> 02:44:14,270
What...

3853
02:44:15,570 --> 02:44:16,110
What...

3854
02:44:16,110 --> 02:44:18,230
What am I doing?!

3855
02:44:20,670 --> 02:44:21,690
Oh, shit!

3856
02:44:22,990 --> 02:44:23,770
Oh, god.

3857
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:32,680
Okay, I have no idea how to fight her.

3858
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:34,600
Okay.

3859
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:37,680
Okay.

3860
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:41,740
Okay.

3861
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:44,440
I'll just do, like, little slaps here and there.

3862
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:47,480
Just...

3863
02:44:47,480 --> 02:44:49,820
Just one slap per hit.

3864
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:51,500
Slap!

3865
02:44:52,700 --> 02:44:53,700
Okay, and then I run.

3866
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:54,560
And I run...

3867
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:54,660
No!

3868
02:44:59,080 --> 02:44:59,480
Okay.

3869
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:01,780
And then, one, two, three, slap!

3870
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:02,140
Oh!

3871
02:45:02,460 --> 02:45:03,280
Oh, my god.

3872
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:04,040
I was supposed to jump.

3873
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:04,880
Oh, no!

3874
02:45:06,380 --> 02:45:06,780
No!

3875
02:45:06,940 --> 02:45:08,340
Let me drink, please, ma'am!

3876
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:09,300
No!

3877
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:12,160
And...

3878
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:12,740
Oh!

3879
02:45:12,740 --> 02:45:13,200
Slap!

3880
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:13,700
Oh!

3881
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:14,480
Never mind.

3882
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:15,620
No, no, it's okay.

3883
02:45:15,720 --> 02:45:16,300
You don't need a slap.

3884
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:18,300
Oh, please!

3885
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:22,580
What has her moveset?

3886
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:26,440
What the fuck is her moveset?

3887
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:32,320
No, I...

3888
02:45:32,320 --> 02:45:32,880
Fuck this.

3889
02:45:33,080 --> 02:45:33,340
Oh!

3890
02:45:33,440 --> 02:45:33,780
Okay.

3891
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:34,460
No, I'm joking.

3892
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:35,620
I'm only joking, ma'am.

3893
02:45:35,900 --> 02:45:37,200
Ma'am, I was joking.

3894
02:45:37,620 --> 02:45:38,400
I was...

3895
02:45:38,400 --> 02:45:39,040
Just here.

3896
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:39,280
Oh!

3897
02:45:39,280 --> 02:45:39,920
Heeeeeeeeee!

3898
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:45,280
I'm sorry!

3899
02:45:46,700 --> 02:45:48,720
It was just heeeeeeeeee!

3900
02:45:52,540 --> 02:45:53,840
Oh my god.

3901
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:56,480
What is that damage?

3902
02:45:57,220 --> 02:45:59,220
It was not fair!

3903
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:02,920
I don't know what I was doing!

3904
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:07,980
Guys, maybe I should have got the...

3905
02:46:07,980 --> 02:46:08,860
Maybe I should have got the thigh.

3906
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:16,680
Alright, but what if I...

3907
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:19,500
That's fucking right.

3908
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:22,760
Alright, here we go.

3909
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:25,060
We're all gonna slap her!

3910
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:27,000
The multi-slap!

3911
02:46:28,960 --> 02:46:29,820
And the baby!

3912
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:32,660
This is it, we're figuring it out!

3913
02:46:34,300 --> 02:46:36,540
There's so many of us slapping, she can't kill us!

3914
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:39,080
Oh no.

3915
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:41,420
Okay, now this is awkward.

3916
02:46:41,660 --> 02:46:43,600
Now what the fuck are my monkeys gonna do?

3917
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:44,480
Like...

3918
02:46:46,900 --> 02:46:47,380
Nooooo!

3919
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:50,860
My monkeys couldn't do anything!

3920
02:46:53,820 --> 02:46:54,300
Okay.

3921
02:46:55,660 --> 02:46:56,760
It's not fair!

3922
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:01,200
Okay, that's fine.

3923
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:02,060
I can stay here.

3924
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:02,960
I'll stay in there.

3925
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:07,320
Alt!

3926
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:08,760
I did it!

3927
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:10,100
Alt?

3928
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:10,660
Hahahaha!

3929
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:12,560
Did I do it?

3930
02:47:14,500 --> 02:47:14,940
Yeah...

3931
02:47:15,440 --> 02:47:17,020
Oh God, oh god.

3932
02:47:18,220 --> 02:47:18,800
It's okay.

3933
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:20,400
I can tank all of this!

3934
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:22,460
I can tank all of this!

3935
02:47:23,220 --> 02:47:24,680
I'm just a little wolf guy!

3936
02:47:26,820 --> 02:47:27,960
She's wasting it!

3937
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:29,580
Because that's not my real HP!

3938
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:31,900
Oh no, wait, wait a minute!

3939
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:33,920
Okay, but what if I...

3940
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:34,820
STOP THEM!

3941
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:36,460
Oh, okay, I can't stop it.

3942
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:37,480
Hahahaha!

3943
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:40,160
What if I just stop it?

3944
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:43,140
Lil' did I know you can't stop it.

3945
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:44,960
God, thank you.

3946
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:47,660
Thank you for stopping.

3947
02:47:49,960 --> 02:47:51,820
No, I couldn't do the combo!

3948
02:47:56,140 --> 02:47:56,680
Nice.

3949
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:57,680
Okay, bye.

3950
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:58,780
No, no, stop!

3951
02:47:59,080 --> 02:47:59,680
Okay, nice.

3952
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:01,600
Oh, fuck!

3953
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:03,340
Okay, I deserve that.

3954
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:05,040
I actually deserve that.

3955
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:12,240
Oh, no, please, please, please, please!

3956
02:48:12,860 --> 02:48:13,900
Let me heal now!

3957
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:18,120
Oh, God, she let me heal.

3958
02:48:18,220 --> 02:48:18,980
She likes me.

3959
02:48:21,940 --> 02:48:23,300
She let me heal.

3960
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:25,640
She likes me, right guys?

3961
02:48:27,260 --> 02:48:27,700
Poke!

3962
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:31,640
Guys, I think she's like, playing hard to get.

3963
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:33,360
Why else would she let me heal?

3964
02:48:34,820 --> 02:48:35,580
I don't know.

3965
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:39,600
Oh, no!

3966
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:40,940
Not again!

3967
02:48:41,460 --> 02:48:42,520
Not again!

3968
02:48:44,120 --> 02:48:46,120
She loves us.

3969
02:48:49,420 --> 02:48:50,500
Oh, no.

3970
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:52,460
Oh, no.

3971
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:55,860
Oh, no, please!

3972
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:00,280
No, fuck!

3973
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:01,960
Oh.

3974
02:49:04,420 --> 02:49:05,800
Oh, God, thank God.

3975
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:08,360
Okay.

3976
02:49:08,820 --> 02:49:11,000
Oh, no, where is the... No, not the lion!

3977
02:49:11,060 --> 02:49:12,100
NOT THE LION!

3978
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:17,040
Poke!

3979
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:20,860
Do I get greedy?

3980
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:22,100
Do I get greedy?

3981
02:49:22,940 --> 02:49:23,820
I'm gonna get grea...

3982
02:49:29,890 --> 02:49:31,370
Oh, maiden down!

3983
02:49:31,770 --> 02:49:32,550
Maiden down!

3984
02:49:36,930 --> 02:49:37,410
Wait,

3985
02:49:44,150 --> 02:49:44,930
I let her live?

3986
02:49:45,930 --> 02:49:46,830
It's not fair!

3987
02:49:47,610 --> 02:49:48,090
I'm gonna let her live.

3988
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:49,690
I let the others die?

3989
02:49:50,010 --> 02:49:52,050
Is this cause she's a maiden?

3990
02:49:56,090 --> 02:49:57,110
She's a dragon.

3991
02:49:57,210 --> 02:49:58,930
It's time to... We told them.

3992
02:49:59,030 --> 02:50:00,750
We had to make all dragons extinct.

3993
02:50:03,870 --> 02:50:05,330
Even if she's hot.

3994
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:08,270
It's cause she's hot.

3995
02:50:18,670 --> 02:50:20,870
What the fuck am I gonna do with my... Oh, shit!

3996
02:50:21,130 --> 02:50:21,290
Oh!

3997
02:50:35,570 --> 02:50:38,670
Even though... ESPECIALLY the hot ones.

3998
02:50:40,730 --> 02:50:41,530
Eh?

3999
02:50:46,410 --> 02:50:47,210
Wait.

4000
02:50:47,610 --> 02:50:48,850
Isn't that...

4001
02:50:49,890 --> 02:50:51,390
Isn't that the pig weapon?

4002
02:50:51,770 --> 02:50:52,770
That's the ring.

4003
02:50:52,930 --> 02:50:53,070
Oh!

4004
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:56,230
Thank you!

4005
02:50:56,290 --> 02:51:00,790
Wait, it's him!

4006
02:51:20,920 --> 02:51:22,280
Why is he so small?

4007
02:51:24,700 --> 02:51:26,340
Why is he so small?

4008
02:51:26,380 --> 02:51:35,800
Why is he so tiny?

4009
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:37,360
What happened to you?

4010
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:41,460
He's smaller than I remember.

4011
02:51:45,930 --> 02:51:46,750
She dead?

4012
02:52:10,550 --> 02:52:15,440
Why is he so tiny?

4013
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:19,500
Did I say his name right in Cantonese?

4014
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:20,320
I don't remember.

4015
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:21,780
It's been so long.

4016
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:25,800
I always remember Sun Wukong, but like...

4017
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:28,900
He's a bad guy.

4018
02:52:35,180 --> 02:52:35,960
Oh my god.

4019
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:39,620
The only names... I always remember his name.

4020
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:44,260
I haven't said his name in a long time, so I was like, I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly.

4021
02:52:46,420 --> 02:52:47,740
But he's so tiny!

4022
02:52:48,640 --> 02:52:50,100
Why is he so tiny?

4023
02:52:54,100 --> 02:52:55,480
What happened to you?

4024
02:52:55,720 --> 02:52:58,040
Did you lose weight in that... in that area?

4025
02:52:58,380 --> 02:52:59,540
When you're trapped there?

4026
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:04,080
Did you lose weight?

4027
02:53:08,500 --> 02:53:09,440
Oh shit.

4028
02:53:09,540 --> 02:53:11,240
I swear, if I die to a fucking... that.

4029
02:53:11,420 --> 02:53:12,400
I swear to god.

4030
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:17,980
This version is so cute.

4031
02:53:18,080 --> 02:53:19,600
I could like, punch him.

4032
02:53:20,120 --> 02:53:21,180
Like a football.

4033
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:24,080
That's how tiny he is.

4034
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:29,080
He's like a cheap... yeah, he's like cheapy size.

4035
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:39,460
Yeah, we could just give... we give him the piggyback ride.

4036
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:43,780
Oh no, there's so much stuff.

4037
02:53:44,940 --> 02:53:45,540
What?

4038
02:53:46,340 --> 02:53:46,880
What?

4039
02:53:46,940 --> 02:53:47,060
What?

4040
02:53:48,060 --> 02:53:49,740
You're supposed to be frozen longer!

4041
02:53:51,940 --> 02:53:53,780
There's another dragon boss?

4042
02:53:54,640 --> 02:53:56,020
There's another one?

4043
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:56,940
There's...

4044
02:53:57,510 --> 02:54:00,200
Oh my god, there's another...

4045
02:54:00,980 --> 02:54:03,840
Oh my god, where is the other one?

4046
02:54:11,020 --> 02:54:12,820
Oh my god, is he throwing a snowball?

4047
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:16,640
Okay, what time is it at?

4048
02:54:16,780 --> 02:54:20,220
Okay, I just want to know like... hours-wise, how long I've been playing.

4049
02:54:20,740 --> 02:54:21,520
Alright, whoa.

4050
02:54:21,900 --> 02:54:22,720
Leave me alone!

4051
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:24,320
Oh shit, we need to fly to the shrine.

4052
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:26,660
Opposite end, okay.

4053
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:28,340
I need to fly to the shrine.

4054
02:54:28,740 --> 02:54:30,420
I'm so far from that.

4055
02:54:30,980 --> 02:54:33,120
Where the fuck is the shrine?

4056
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:35,440
Oh there it is.

4057
02:54:35,780 --> 02:54:37,800
I asked and I received.

4058
02:54:43,220 --> 02:54:43,700
Nice.

4059
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:45,520
Alright.

4060
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:48,640
Oh, I can craft new armor!

4061
02:54:48,920 --> 02:54:49,980
Do I have enough money?

4062
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:52,700
I do, thank god, okay.

4063
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:57,820
Oh my god, 53!

4064
02:54:58,980 --> 02:55:03,260
That is a huge fucking jump!

4065
02:55:03,660 --> 02:55:10,140
From like 30... from like 30 to... 20 to 53.

4066
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:11,280
Jesus, alright.

4067
02:55:12,380 --> 02:55:13,260
Nice.

4068
02:55:15,460 --> 02:55:17,780
Okay, and then...

4069
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:20,000
Oh, 32.

4070
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:20,920
Wait, that's good.

4071
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:25,160
Yeah, I'll take that.

4072
02:55:27,180 --> 02:55:28,700
The trip improvement, yeah.

4073
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:31,940
When will I get shoes?

4074
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:34,760
Like, my feet... my feet is tired.

4075
02:55:35,360 --> 02:55:38,280
Like, my feet is like getting frostbite from all the snow.

4076
02:55:43,390 --> 02:55:44,610
There's another dragon.

4077
02:55:44,930 --> 02:55:45,910
Alright, where is it?

4078
02:55:46,390 --> 02:55:47,210
Where is he?

4079
02:55:48,630 --> 02:55:50,270
Where is the last dragon?

4080
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:56,230
Where is he?

4081
02:56:00,060 --> 02:56:01,360
Oh, I see him.

4082
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:01,780
Is that him?

4083
02:56:02,300 --> 02:56:03,540
I see him.

4084
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:05,820
Oh, is he fishing?

4085
02:56:07,500 --> 02:56:08,620
What is he doing?

4086
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:11,020
Hello, sir.

4087
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:17,220
Are you fishing?

4088
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:22,920
Hey, can I join you?

4089
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:24,620
Are you Animal Crossing right now?

4090
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:26,980
Time to ruin his day.

4091
02:56:28,180 --> 02:56:29,380
Did I kill your girlfriend?

4092
02:56:30,100 --> 02:56:31,960
Was that other dragon your girlfriend?

4093
02:56:34,320 --> 02:56:35,600
Were you trying to fi...

4094
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:37,640
Well, she's dead now so you can stop fishing.

4095
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:39,160
Oh, you were not fishing.

4096
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:40,080
Oh.

4097
02:56:43,260 --> 02:56:46,860
Oh, okay.

4098
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:49,740
Okay, I don't think he was fishing, guys.

4099
02:56:50,020 --> 02:56:51,980
I don't think...

4100
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:53,840
Wait, how come you're on two legs?

4101
02:56:53,960 --> 02:56:55,480
The other dragons aren't on two legs.

4102
02:56:57,440 --> 02:56:58,000
Bam!

4103
02:56:58,600 --> 02:56:59,720
That's right, big baby.

4104
02:57:02,320 --> 02:57:03,340
That's fucking right.

4105
02:57:04,100 --> 02:57:04,660
Backstab!

4106
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:06,720
Boom!

4107
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:08,000
And then...

4108
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,100
It's fire time!

4109
02:57:12,200 --> 02:57:12,760
Boom!

4110
02:57:12,820 --> 02:57:13,380
Boom!

4111
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:16,460
He's just a big lizard.

4112
02:57:16,980 --> 02:57:18,440
Maybe he's not even a dragon.

4113
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:20,760
It's like those, like, legless liz...

4114
02:57:20,760 --> 02:57:21,400
Oh, shit.

4115
02:57:21,640 --> 02:57:22,420
Oh, my God.

4116
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:24,100
Maybe I should stop talking right now.

4117
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:24,600
Right now.

4118
02:57:26,440 --> 02:57:27,460
You know, like...

4119
02:57:27,460 --> 02:57:29,360
There's, like, legless lizards.

4120
02:57:29,460 --> 02:57:30,520
They're not snakes.

4121
02:57:30,640 --> 02:57:33,520
Because, like, lizards can blink their eyes but snakes can't.

4122
02:57:36,340 --> 02:57:37,120
Oh, shit.

4123
02:57:37,180 --> 02:57:37,820
Oh, no.

4124
02:57:38,460 --> 02:57:39,520
Oh, please.

4125
02:57:39,580 --> 02:57:40,080
I'm sorry.

4126
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:41,300
Oh, he's...

4127
02:57:42,820 --> 02:57:43,880
Wait, what does this do?

4128
02:57:44,360 --> 02:57:45,360
What does that do?

4129
02:57:46,780 --> 02:57:47,260
What?

4130
02:57:47,400 --> 02:57:48,380
Oh, it's just...

4131
02:57:48,380 --> 02:57:49,700
He's just electricity now.

4132
02:57:50,200 --> 02:57:51,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

4133
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:52,240
I'm sorry.

4134
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,040
I'm not sorry.

4135
02:57:56,180 --> 02:57:57,260
That's fucking right.

4136
02:57:59,970 --> 02:58:00,280
Boom!

4137
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:00,900
Oh.

4138
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:01,980
Unlucky.

4139
02:58:02,080 --> 02:58:02,200
Oh!

4140
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:03,780
What the fuck?

4141
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:07,760
How does he have 200 million damage?

4142
02:58:12,320 --> 02:58:14,120
That should be legal.

4143
02:58:16,680 --> 02:58:17,840
That's fucking right.

4144
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:20,180
Oh, shit.

4145
02:58:21,020 --> 02:58:21,720
Oh, God.

4146
02:58:21,740 --> 02:58:22,220
Oh, shit.

4147
02:58:22,220 --> 02:58:22,660
Oh, God!

4148
02:58:24,080 --> 02:58:25,240
Primates assemble!

4149
02:58:29,380 --> 02:58:30,660
Primates assemble!

4150
02:58:31,480 --> 02:58:33,600
I even have, like, 200...

4151
02:58:33,700 --> 02:58:34,900
They're all dead!

4152
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:35,800
What?

4153
02:58:36,140 --> 02:58:36,400
What?

4154
02:58:36,540 --> 02:58:38,340
That was all my magic?

4155
02:58:38,620 --> 02:58:41,620
That was actually all my magic, too?!

4156
02:58:41,620 --> 02:58:42,700
That's fucked!

4157
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:44,260
That's so fucked!

4158
02:58:44,960 --> 02:58:46,640
Oh, my God.

4159
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:49,860
That's all my magic!

4160
02:58:50,220 --> 02:58:50,420
That was all my magic!

4161
02:58:50,420 --> 02:58:52,160
I can't stop.

4162
02:58:52,160 --> 02:58:54,900
All right, now I know not to use the primates.

4163
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:59,400
I know, I know that's useless.

4164
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:03,600
Oh my god, they're useless.

4165
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:09,620
Okay, come on.

4166
02:59:09,860 --> 02:59:10,420
Yes!

4167
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:12,040
Oh, they got it.

4168
02:59:12,080 --> 02:59:13,000
I hit those.

4169
02:59:17,340 --> 02:59:19,920
Oh no, so cool.

4170
02:59:20,040 --> 02:59:21,600
He freezes the frame.

4171
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:24,420
Oh no, I'm so scared.

4172
02:59:24,760 --> 02:59:25,920
I'm so scared.

4173
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:29,660
Oh, this should be illegal.

4174
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:35,340
Like that amount of damage should not be an illegal thing.

4175
02:59:35,440 --> 02:59:35,680
What?

4176
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:37,020
Does he stun me?

4177
02:59:41,060 --> 02:59:41,580
Okay,

4178
02:59:46,540 --> 02:59:48,700
I learned, I learned the monkey.

4179
02:59:48,900 --> 02:59:51,140
Don't do the, don't do the monkeys.

4180
02:59:54,020 --> 02:59:57,080
Don't do the little, the monkeys, the primates.

4181
02:59:57,240 --> 03:00:08,280
The primates, they just fucking killed all of them instantly and that was a waste of my, that was my, a waste of my fucking magic.

4182
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:14,340
Oh my god, he touched me and did so much damage.

4183
03:00:14,380 --> 03:00:15,320
It was so scary.

4184
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:17,480
It was so scary.

4185
03:00:18,440 --> 03:00:19,320
Hey baby!

4186
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:23,600
Okay.

4187
03:00:24,020 --> 03:00:25,520
I stunned him a little bit though.

4188
03:00:25,660 --> 03:00:27,980
Oh, all right, that's fine.

4189
03:00:29,660 --> 03:00:30,420
Wolf time.

4190
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:31,500
Wolf time.

4191
03:00:32,220 --> 03:00:33,140
Wolf time.

4192
03:00:33,360 --> 03:00:34,240
Wolf time.

4193
03:00:34,840 --> 03:00:35,720
Wolf time.

4194
03:00:37,420 --> 03:00:39,080
Oh god, I'm sorry.

4195
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:40,080
I'm so sorry.

4196
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:43,620
Please, please let me heal a little bit.

4197
03:00:44,320 --> 03:00:45,580
Oh, thank god.

4198
03:00:48,140 --> 03:00:49,020
Okay, nice.

4199
03:00:51,260 --> 03:00:53,060
Okay, if I hit him in the back he...

4200
03:00:53,060 --> 03:00:53,560
Aargh!

4201
03:00:53,560 --> 03:00:55,560
Never mind, I keep forgetting the tail.

4202
03:00:59,500 --> 03:00:59,940
Okay.

4203
03:00:59,940 --> 03:01:00,860
All right, nice.

4204
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:05,180
Okay, don't hit him in the back because like the tail.

4205
03:01:05,580 --> 03:01:07,820
Okay, but like which side can I hit?

4206
03:01:08,020 --> 03:01:15,360
All right, eventually I'll figure out the right side.

4207
03:01:17,500 --> 03:01:17,940
What?

4208
03:01:18,060 --> 03:01:18,980
He broke it?

4209
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:24,040
He literally, he broke my fucking stun.

4210
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:25,900
That's fuck.

4211
03:01:26,280 --> 03:01:27,220
That's actually fucked.

4212
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:29,020
That's actually so fucked.

4213
03:01:29,240 --> 03:01:30,560
You broke my stun.

4214
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:32,020
Oh no.

4215
03:01:32,460 --> 03:01:33,180
Come on.

4216
03:01:33,220 --> 03:01:33,620
Nope.

4217
03:01:33,720 --> 03:01:34,280
Goodbye.

4218
03:01:34,700 --> 03:01:35,300
Goodbye.

4219
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:38,360
Stop the please.

4220
03:01:40,980 --> 03:01:46,900
The face is the perfect sheaf if I don't block with the face.

4221
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:48,460
How do I block it?

4222
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:53,260
Oh, god.

4223
03:01:53,660 --> 03:01:55,220
Oh, god.

4224
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:56,300
I need to leave.

4225
03:01:56,460 --> 03:01:57,360
I need to leave.

4226
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:00,040
I need to leave.

4227
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:03,220
Okay, nice.

4228
03:02:18,210 --> 03:02:20,190
Okay, that's... this is not the run.

4229
03:02:20,450 --> 03:02:22,570
I can already tell this is not the run.

4230
03:02:25,030 --> 03:02:26,050
Holy shit.

4231
03:02:27,450 --> 03:02:29,950
This guy is so hard.

4232
03:02:30,950 --> 03:02:33,050
Oh, my god.

4233
03:02:35,430 --> 03:02:37,850
Oh, my god.

4234
03:02:40,010 --> 03:02:41,950
Oh, my god.

4235
03:02:41,990 --> 03:02:43,870
This guy's actually so hard.

4236
03:02:44,530 --> 03:02:47,290
He hits so dark, too.

4237
03:02:50,850 --> 03:02:52,010
This is not fair.

4238
03:02:52,590 --> 03:02:54,930
I'm sorry for killing your girlfriend.

4239
03:02:55,790 --> 03:02:56,570
I'm not sorry.

4240
03:03:00,470 --> 03:03:02,590
I was never... That's right.

4241
03:03:02,690 --> 03:03:03,890
I'm never sorry.

4242
03:03:03,910 --> 03:03:05,090
And I'll do it again.

4243
03:03:06,250 --> 03:03:08,130
And I'll do it again.

4244
03:03:09,850 --> 03:03:10,450
Okay.

4245
03:03:13,230 --> 03:03:13,830
Okay.

4246
03:03:19,370 --> 03:03:22,470
It doesn't matter if I swap out the monkey spell.

4247
03:03:22,590 --> 03:03:24,230
It's still gonna take a lot of...

4248
03:03:25,030 --> 03:03:25,550
MP!

4249
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:30,910
The monkey spell just takes so much magic in general.

4250
03:03:31,610 --> 03:03:32,870
So it doesn't matter.

4251
03:03:34,910 --> 03:03:36,870
I just can't use it.

4252
03:03:40,170 --> 03:03:40,730
Poke!

4253
03:03:43,030 --> 03:03:43,950
Okay, I'll leave.

4254
03:03:44,630 --> 03:03:45,870
Oh, okay.

4255
03:03:45,990 --> 03:03:46,570
Oh, fuck.

4256
03:03:46,610 --> 03:03:47,470
I forgot the second hit.

4257
03:03:52,890 --> 03:03:53,450
Okay.

4258
03:03:53,450 --> 03:03:54,010
Nice.

4259
03:03:54,170 --> 03:03:54,410
Okay.

4260
03:03:55,990 --> 03:03:56,550
Stun!

4261
03:04:03,220 --> 03:04:03,700
Nice.

4262
03:04:03,700 --> 03:04:04,880
I got the poke in, too.

4263
03:04:05,220 --> 03:04:06,340
Oh, goodbye.

4264
03:04:06,560 --> 03:04:06,840
Goodbye.

4265
03:04:07,580 --> 03:04:08,060
Goodbye.

4266
03:04:08,400 --> 03:04:09,160
What's he gonna do?

4267
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:11,140
Swing his sword and I'm 200 miles away?

4268
03:04:11,820 --> 03:04:13,160
That's fucking right, you idiot.

4269
03:04:15,400 --> 03:04:16,420
That's right, you idiot.

4270
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:17,120
I'm not there.

4271
03:04:18,420 --> 03:04:19,180
Oh, whoa.

4272
03:04:19,380 --> 03:04:20,400
Maybe I'm an idiot.

4273
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:21,960
Okay.

4274
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:24,260
I was a little bit silly there.

4275
03:04:27,100 --> 03:04:28,200
Okay, but what if...

4276
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:29,760
Like... Boom!

4277
03:04:29,920 --> 03:04:31,040
That's fucking right.

4278
03:04:32,320 --> 03:04:32,620
Ah!

4279
03:04:32,840 --> 03:04:33,620
The tail!

4280
03:04:33,780 --> 03:04:34,420
Every time!

4281
03:04:34,780 --> 03:04:36,880
Why can't I do that with the tail?

4282
03:04:37,740 --> 03:04:39,520
Why is it dragon-specific?

4283
03:04:43,480 --> 03:04:44,080
Oh.

4284
03:04:46,080 --> 03:04:46,380
Freeze.

4285
03:04:48,120 --> 03:04:48,960
Oh, god.

4286
03:04:49,080 --> 03:04:50,280
Oh, he baited me.

4287
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:52,360
He wanted me to freeze this fucker.

4288
03:04:55,970 --> 03:04:56,890
That's fucking right.

4289
03:04:57,230 --> 03:04:58,450
That's close to me.

4290
03:04:59,370 --> 03:05:01,030
Come on, you know you want to.

4291
03:05:01,470 --> 03:05:02,230
Come on.

4292
03:05:02,770 --> 03:05:03,790
I'm holding it.

4293
03:05:04,270 --> 03:05:05,030
Come on.

4294
03:05:05,330 --> 03:05:06,570
Get a little bit closer.

4295
03:05:07,990 --> 03:05:08,690
Come on!

4296
03:05:09,490 --> 03:05:10,570
There we go.

4297
03:05:14,530 --> 03:05:15,290
I'm so sorry!

4298
03:05:15,370 --> 03:05:15,890
I'm so sorry!

4299
03:05:16,010 --> 03:05:16,770
That was a joke.

4300
03:05:16,930 --> 03:05:17,770
I'm so sorry.

4301
03:05:17,930 --> 03:05:18,810
I'm so sorry!

4302
03:05:19,050 --> 03:05:19,730
Oh god!

4303
03:05:21,230 --> 03:05:21,710
Why?

4304
03:05:22,190 --> 03:05:23,690
How did you predict that?

4305
03:05:25,810 --> 03:05:26,790
That's not fair!

4306
03:05:27,690 --> 03:05:28,430
I like that.

4307
03:05:28,430 --> 03:05:28,930
Come on, get close again.

4308
03:05:29,650 --> 03:05:31,110
You know you want to.

4309
03:05:34,090 --> 03:05:35,270
Come on, get close again.

4310
03:05:35,370 --> 03:05:36,450
You know you want to.

4311
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:37,570
Come on!

4312
03:05:38,450 --> 03:05:38,750
JK!

4313
03:05:39,970 --> 03:05:41,130
Shouldn't have got close.

4314
03:05:44,890 --> 03:05:46,090
Okay, nice.

4315
03:05:46,590 --> 03:05:47,630
Oh shit!

4316
03:05:47,790 --> 03:05:48,390
Nice.

4317
03:05:54,510 --> 03:05:56,770
Oh, my stamina is gone.

4318
03:05:59,230 --> 03:06:00,430
Haha, that's fucking right.

4319
03:06:00,450 --> 03:06:00,930
Get close.

4320
03:06:01,410 --> 03:06:01,810
That's right.

4321
03:06:01,890 --> 03:06:02,750
You know you want to.

4322
03:06:03,370 --> 03:06:04,410
Come on, get close.

4323
03:06:04,590 --> 03:06:05,050
Come on!

4324
03:06:05,930 --> 03:06:06,490
Come on!

4325
03:06:06,570 --> 03:06:07,050
Get over here!

4326
03:06:08,090 --> 03:06:09,390
That's fucking right, bitch!

4327
03:06:10,950 --> 03:06:11,910
Wait, can I cheese this?

4328
03:06:12,770 --> 03:06:13,730
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4329
03:06:13,730 --> 03:06:14,270
Wait a minute.

4330
03:06:14,390 --> 03:06:14,970
Wait a minute.

4331
03:06:15,310 --> 03:06:15,950
Wait a minute.

4332
03:06:16,030 --> 03:06:16,530
Am I cooking?

4333
03:06:17,490 --> 03:06:18,610
Am I cooking right now?

4334
03:06:19,470 --> 03:06:20,230
Wait a minute.

4335
03:06:21,410 --> 03:06:22,390
Wait a minute.

4336
03:06:33,180 --> 03:06:35,280
I was, in fact, not cooking.

4337
03:06:35,600 --> 03:06:36,240
I...

4338
03:06:36,240 --> 03:06:42,580
I think I figured out that I was, in fact, absolutely not cooking.

4339
03:06:44,700 --> 03:06:46,620
I... I might have...

4340
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:48,760
I might have burned the kitchen.

4341
03:06:49,060 --> 03:06:52,020
I... I overcooked it.

4342
03:06:55,020 --> 03:06:55,920
Oh, my God.

4343
03:06:55,940 --> 03:06:57,480
Why is he so difficult?

4344
03:06:59,940 --> 03:07:00,260
Okay.

4345
03:07:00,360 --> 03:07:01,700
Maybe I don't waste this.

4346
03:07:01,700 --> 03:07:02,280
Maybe.

4347
03:07:04,520 --> 03:07:05,240
Big baby!

4348
03:07:05,560 --> 03:07:06,160
Oh, nice.

4349
03:07:06,400 --> 03:07:07,840
Okay, that's actually pretty good, actually.

4350
03:07:10,540 --> 03:07:11,020
No!

4351
03:07:13,420 --> 03:07:13,900
Okay.

4352
03:07:14,740 --> 03:07:16,220
Okay, maybe I might do light attacks.

4353
03:07:16,620 --> 03:07:18,200
And then... Oh, maybe not.

4354
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:20,720
All right.

4355
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:22,560
Big attacks.

4356
03:07:22,740 --> 03:07:23,500
Big attacks only.

4357
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:24,780
Oh, no.

4358
03:07:25,320 --> 03:07:26,000
All right.

4359
03:07:28,520 --> 03:07:29,000
Okay.

4360
03:07:29,480 --> 03:07:29,960
What?

4361
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:30,960
That hits me?

4362
03:07:33,240 --> 03:07:34,200
Oh, no.

4363
03:07:34,300 --> 03:07:35,340
That also hits me.

4364
03:07:35,400 --> 03:07:35,760
I'm sorry.

4365
03:07:35,880 --> 03:07:37,360
I keep trying to cook, but I...

4366
03:07:37,360 --> 03:07:38,600
I'm not a chef.

4367
03:07:38,860 --> 03:07:39,560
I know.

4368
03:07:40,020 --> 03:07:44,940
I keep trying to cook, but then I realize I shouldn't...

4369
03:07:44,940 --> 03:07:46,420
I should not be cooking.

4370
03:07:51,510 --> 03:07:52,350
Oh, run.

4371
03:07:52,470 --> 03:07:52,830
Run!

4372
03:07:52,930 --> 03:07:53,270
No!

4373
03:07:58,510 --> 03:07:59,110
All right.

4374
03:07:59,130 --> 03:07:59,910
He has to come down.

4375
03:08:00,130 --> 03:08:01,390
What comes down?

4376
03:08:01,570 --> 03:08:03,450
What goes up must come down.

4377
03:08:04,030 --> 03:08:04,830
Oh, fuck.

4378
03:08:04,930 --> 03:08:05,430
Not the tail.

4379
03:08:08,450 --> 03:08:09,110
Come on.

4380
03:08:09,850 --> 03:08:10,830
Wait, how did...

4381
03:08:10,830 --> 03:08:11,510
Wait, what?

4382
03:08:12,950 --> 03:08:15,390
It said I used the thing, but I didn't.

4383
03:08:15,690 --> 03:08:17,030
Guys, I don't think this is the run.

4384
03:08:17,370 --> 03:08:18,930
I don't think this is the run, guys.

4385
03:08:19,150 --> 03:08:20,750
I already used so much HP.

4386
03:08:24,170 --> 03:08:24,970
But, um...

4387
03:08:25,650 --> 03:08:26,050
Um...

4388
03:08:28,610 --> 03:08:29,010
Okay.

4389
03:08:29,570 --> 03:08:29,970
Nice.

4390
03:08:33,070 --> 03:08:33,470
No!

4391
03:08:33,710 --> 03:08:34,730
Oh, wait, I didn't get hit!

4392
03:08:35,590 --> 03:08:35,990
Boom!

4393
03:08:36,210 --> 03:08:36,610
Okay.

4394
03:08:36,610 --> 03:08:37,510
I didn't get hit!

4395
03:08:37,630 --> 03:08:38,350
Wait, I did!

4396
03:08:38,510 --> 03:08:39,810
I can't tell!

4397
03:08:39,950 --> 03:08:41,670
I can't tell anymore.

4398
03:08:43,610 --> 03:08:44,730
Did I get hit?

4399
03:08:44,810 --> 03:08:45,630
Did I not get hit?

4400
03:08:46,030 --> 03:08:46,710
Schrodinger's hit!

4401
03:08:48,710 --> 03:08:49,530
Oh, fuck.

4402
03:08:49,570 --> 03:08:50,450
That was not long enough.

4403
03:08:51,230 --> 03:08:52,070
Wait, what?

4404
03:08:55,550 --> 03:08:56,030
Okay.

4405
03:08:57,030 --> 03:08:57,990
I should...

4406
03:08:57,990 --> 03:08:58,710
I should have left.

4407
03:09:01,170 --> 03:09:01,650
Freeze!

4408
03:09:03,950 --> 03:09:04,850
Oh, my God.

4409
03:09:06,730 --> 03:09:07,210
No!

4410
03:09:08,290 --> 03:09:08,770
No!

4411
03:09:09,530 --> 03:09:10,010
Okay.

4412
03:09:10,910 --> 03:09:11,830
No, we run!

4413
03:09:11,950 --> 03:09:12,430
We run!

4414
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:18,240
Run!

4415
03:09:18,400 --> 03:09:19,040
We run!

4416
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:20,120
We run again!

4417
03:09:22,780 --> 03:09:23,260
Boom!

4418
03:09:24,300 --> 03:09:24,780
Oh,

4419
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:38,740
my God, I don't have any heals left, guys!

4420
03:09:41,660 --> 03:09:43,680
I don't have any heals left!

4421
03:09:44,440 --> 03:09:45,500
I'm so scared!

4422
03:09:49,990 --> 03:09:50,470
Please.

4423
03:09:51,090 --> 03:09:52,130
Please have mercy.

4424
03:09:54,670 --> 03:09:55,210
I'm just a little guy.

4425
03:09:55,210 --> 03:09:56,130
Oh, please have mercy.

4426
03:09:56,350 --> 03:09:57,890
I'm just a little guy.

4427
03:09:59,250 --> 03:10:00,910
I'm just a little...

4428
03:10:00,910 --> 03:10:01,650
Oh, shit!

4429
03:10:02,230 --> 03:10:02,950
Get out!

4430
03:10:02,990 --> 03:10:03,390
Get out!

4431
03:10:03,490 --> 03:10:03,770
Oh, God!

4432
03:10:06,820 --> 03:10:07,580
Oh, God...

4433
03:10:07,580 --> 03:10:08,220
Oh.

4434
03:10:10,740 --> 03:10:11,680
Oh, please.

4435
03:10:12,660 --> 03:10:13,780
Get out of there.

4436
03:10:13,820 --> 03:10:14,200
Little guy.

4437
03:10:14,520 --> 03:10:14,940
No!

4438
03:10:18,380 --> 03:10:19,460

4439
03:10:19,460 --> 03:10:21,200
Oh, no.

4440
03:10:21,440 --> 03:10:23,140
We were so close!

4441
03:10:24,640 --> 03:10:26,740
I'm just a little guy!

4442
03:10:26,820 --> 03:10:26,960
No!

4443
03:10:30,880 --> 03:10:33,160
I'm just a little guy.

4444
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:37,680
Oh my god, we were so close.

4445
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:40,080
Oh my god.

4446
03:10:43,200 --> 03:10:44,940
Oh my god, okay.

4447
03:10:45,160 --> 03:10:47,240
Alright, full focus guys, I'm gonna full focus.

4448
03:10:49,300 --> 03:10:50,340

4449
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:55,060
No more Mr. Nice Mukai.

4450
03:10:55,660 --> 03:10:59,580
No more Mr. Mr. How the fuck did I got damage from that?

4451
03:11:00,800 --> 03:11:03,900
No more Mr. Nice Mukai.

4452
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:06,900
Monkey strong.

4453
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:08,660
Monkey strong.

4454
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:11,000
Monkey see, monkey do.

4455
03:11:11,260 --> 03:11:12,860
Okay, now I gotta focus.

4456
03:11:15,480 --> 03:11:18,060
Hard focus time.

4457
03:11:22,600 --> 03:11:26,980
Come on.

4458
03:11:30,780 --> 03:11:31,880

4459
03:11:33,380 --> 03:11:34,100
Poke.

4460
03:11:36,400 --> 03:11:38,000
Alright, nice.

4461
03:11:39,140 --> 03:11:41,260
Come on doki, keep focusing.

4462
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:45,380
Back stab.

4463
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:47,660
Okay, back out.

4464
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:48,560
Back out.

4465
03:11:48,960 --> 03:11:50,180
We gotta back out.

4466
03:11:52,820 --> 03:11:53,540
Okay.

4467
03:11:54,280 --> 03:11:55,000
Freeze.

4468
03:11:56,760 --> 03:11:57,700
Back out.

4469
03:11:59,040 --> 03:11:59,760
Dodge!

4470
03:12:02,220 --> 03:12:02,940
Oh my god.

4471
03:12:02,940 --> 03:12:03,380
Oh my god.

4472
03:12:03,380 --> 03:12:03,980
Oh my god.

4473
03:12:03,980 --> 03:12:05,060
That was such a dodge!

4474
03:12:05,740 --> 03:12:07,720
Oh my god, not the fucking tail.

4475
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:10,940

4476
03:12:11,440 --> 03:12:12,120

4477
03:12:13,960 --> 03:12:16,520

4478
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:22,040

4479
03:12:23,660 --> 03:12:25,480
Somebody watch the replay!

4480
03:12:28,440 --> 03:12:29,120
Okay.

4481
03:12:36,310 --> 03:12:36,990
Alright.

4482
03:12:37,810 --> 03:12:40,750
Okay, come Okay, dodged.

4483
03:12:47,420 --> 03:12:48,540
Okay.

4484
03:12:51,680 --> 03:12:52,240
Nice.

4485
03:12:56,580 --> 03:12:57,480
Dodge, dodge.

4486
03:12:58,200 --> 03:12:59,320

4487
03:13:04,460 --> 03:13:05,480
Dodge, dodge.

4488
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:08,160
Okay.

4489
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:13,740
What?

4490
03:13:14,700 --> 03:13:16,020
That should not have hit me.

4491
03:13:16,480 --> 03:13:17,880
That was actually bullshit.

4492
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:19,360
That was bullshit.

4493
03:13:20,960 --> 03:13:22,840
Oh god, please, Xenia, stop hitting.

4494
03:13:25,600 --> 03:13:26,160
Okay.

4495
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:32,620
Oh, come on!

4496
03:13:35,060 --> 03:13:36,400
That was bullshit!

4497
03:13:36,920 --> 03:13:37,900
And you knew it!

4498
03:13:38,300 --> 03:13:40,100
You fucking knew it, you cheater!

4499
03:13:42,780 --> 03:13:43,340
Poke!

4500
03:13:45,700 --> 03:13:46,220
Oh no.

4501
03:13:46,520 --> 03:13:48,080
Last heal, last heal!

4502
03:13:55,320 --> 03:13:56,160
Okay, nice.

4503
03:13:56,540 --> 03:13:57,780

4504
03:14:01,200 --> 03:14:01,940
Oh thank god.

4505
03:14:02,040 --> 03:14:03,060
Oh thank god.

4506
03:14:03,620 --> 03:14:05,020
We got the baby in time.

4507
03:14:07,240 --> 03:14:07,880
Alright.

4508
03:14:13,460 --> 03:14:14,440
Wolf time!

4509
03:14:14,640 --> 03:14:15,120
Wolf!

4510
03:14:15,540 --> 03:14:16,180
Wolf!

4511
03:14:16,900 --> 03:14:17,840
Wolf power!

4512
03:14:18,220 --> 03:14:19,240
Wolf power!

4513
03:14:19,920 --> 03:14:20,840
Wolf power!

4514
03:14:21,160 --> 03:14:22,300
Wolf power!

4515
03:14:26,320 --> 03:14:26,620
Go Wolf!

4516
03:14:26,620 --> 03:14:27,320
Oh!

4517
03:14:27,320 --> 03:14:27,740
Yes!

4518
03:14:31,020 --> 03:14:31,760
Oh!

4519
03:14:32,400 --> 03:14:34,460
See your girlfriend in hell!

4520
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:35,780
Bitch!

4521
03:14:38,780 --> 03:14:39,520
Ahhh!

4522
03:14:41,080 --> 03:14:43,320
I went full serious mode there.

4523
03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:45,340
I gamed.

4524
03:14:46,040 --> 03:14:47,460
I gamed hard!

4525
03:14:47,800 --> 03:14:49,580
Just for that one moment.

4526
03:14:52,780 --> 03:14:54,160
Oh my god.

4527
03:14:54,280 --> 03:14:55,440
The moment I said...

4528
03:14:55,440 --> 03:14:56,620
Alright, I'm going to go serious now.

4529
03:14:56,800 --> 03:14:58,060
It was over for that wolf man.

4530
03:14:58,420 --> 03:14:59,780
I mean that wolf dragon man.

4531
03:15:03,050 --> 03:15:04,550
It was so over for him.

4532
03:15:04,890 --> 03:15:06,850
The moma said it's wolf time.

4533
03:15:11,170 --> 03:15:12,250
That's fucking right.

4534
03:15:12,750 --> 03:15:13,730
Get out of here.

4535
03:15:14,830 --> 03:15:16,110
Get out of here!

4536
03:15:19,210 --> 03:15:20,610
Thank you for the super chat.

4537
03:15:20,670 --> 03:15:20,930
Thank you.

4538
03:15:20,990 --> 03:15:21,390
Thank you.

4539
03:15:21,430 --> 03:15:23,110
You defeated our ceiling.

4540
03:15:23,650 --> 03:15:24,790
Thank you for the super chat.

4541
03:15:24,890 --> 03:15:25,190
Thank you.

4542
03:15:28,170 --> 03:15:29,390
Oh my god.

4543
03:15:29,550 --> 03:15:29,930
Alright.

4544
03:15:30,370 --> 03:15:31,350
I'm going to call it here.

4545
03:15:33,230 --> 03:15:35,690
That was a good fight to end it on.

4546
03:15:36,330 --> 03:15:38,550
Where's the fucking... where's the shrine?

4547
03:15:39,230 --> 03:15:43,270
I think that was a good fight to end this playthrough on.

4548
03:15:43,670 --> 03:15:44,450
Thank you for the super chat.

4549
03:15:44,530 --> 03:15:45,190
Not the super chat.

4550
03:15:45,250 --> 03:15:46,490
Thank you for the gift of ship.

4551
03:15:46,650 --> 03:15:46,910
Thank you.

4552
03:15:46,910 --> 03:15:47,690
Thank you Mike.

4553
03:15:49,190 --> 03:15:51,210
Wait, I can upgrade my wolf?

4554
03:15:51,590 --> 03:15:54,730
My wolf has not been upgraded in 50 years.

4555
03:15:55,170 --> 03:15:55,610
I...

4556
03:15:58,490 --> 03:15:59,070
Alright.

4557
03:15:59,170 --> 03:16:01,510
I have to figure out how to get back to the shrine first.

4558
03:16:02,430 --> 03:16:03,470
Oh my god.

4559
03:16:03,530 --> 03:16:05,830
My wolf... I don't think I've... I don't think I've...

4560
03:16:05,830 --> 03:16:07,870
Are you fucking kidding me?

4561
03:16:08,370 --> 03:16:09,290
Oh my god.

4562
03:16:13,090 --> 03:16:15,710
I was trying to use the talisman.

4563
03:16:16,170 --> 03:16:18,770
You... It doesn't stop them?

4564
03:16:20,010 --> 03:16:21,090
Instant transmission.

4565
03:16:22,990 --> 03:16:23,570
Alright.

4566
03:16:23,730 --> 03:16:24,670
Oh my god.

4567
03:16:25,370 --> 03:16:26,590
What a fight.

4568
03:16:26,590 --> 03:16:28,230
Oh my god.

4569
03:16:28,730 --> 03:16:30,010
How do I upgrade wolf?

4570
03:16:30,930 --> 03:16:32,330
You can upgrade wolf?

4571
03:16:34,410 --> 03:16:35,250
That's possible?

4572
03:16:36,210 --> 03:16:37,610
Oh, I can craft weapons though.

4573
03:16:38,590 --> 03:16:39,490
Wait, what can I craft?

4574
03:16:41,610 --> 03:16:42,790
Wait, no I can't.

4575
03:16:43,010 --> 03:16:43,950
No, I was lied to.

4576
03:16:44,130 --> 03:16:44,810
No, I can't.

4577
03:16:44,830 --> 03:16:45,490
Oh my god.

4578
03:16:47,050 --> 03:16:49,510
What the fuck are these things that I need?

4579
03:16:52,330 --> 03:16:53,490
What a lie to me.

4580
03:16:53,530 --> 03:16:54,690
I said I could craft weapons.

4581
03:16:54,950 --> 03:16:55,430
I can't.

4582
03:16:55,550 --> 03:16:56,450
I don't even know what these are.

4583
03:16:58,770 --> 03:17:00,070
Okay I can brew though.

4584
03:17:00,910 --> 03:17:01,930
What did I get?

4585
03:17:02,990 --> 03:17:03,630
This?

4586
03:17:04,870 --> 03:17:05,950
What do I have?

4587
03:17:06,310 --> 03:17:07,670
Increases damage reduction?

4588
03:17:11,110 --> 03:17:12,850
No, we need damage reduction.

4589
03:17:12,930 --> 03:17:15,190
We 100% need damage reduction.

4590
03:17:16,510 --> 03:17:20,270
All right, set spells, cultivate sparks.

4591
03:17:23,070 --> 03:17:25,030
Okay, no baby can't be upgraded.

4592
03:17:25,610 --> 03:17:27,610
Wait, how do I upgrade wolf?

4593
03:17:30,810 --> 03:17:31,610
Oh, is this?

4594
03:17:31,750 --> 03:17:32,930
Oh yeah, that's the ring of fire.

4595
03:17:35,750 --> 03:17:40,330
And people were like, you need to use... hey, what the is that?

4596
03:17:41,230 --> 03:17:42,170
No, you can't.

4597
03:17:43,610 --> 03:17:44,650
He's just there.

4598
03:17:48,890 --> 03:17:50,650
You can't upgrade wolf.

4599
03:17:51,330 --> 03:17:52,570
I guess like transformation?

4600
03:17:56,660 --> 03:17:57,640
Is it this?

4601
03:18:07,460 --> 03:18:09,440
I have nothing upgraded by the way.

4602
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:12,140
Wait, what do I get?

4603
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:16,340
What should I upgrade, guys?

4604
03:18:16,760 --> 03:18:17,640
What transformation?

4605
03:18:23,140 --> 03:18:25,060
Also, Johnny Lacone Navi!

4606
03:18:25,160 --> 03:18:27,040
Thank you so much for the gifted chest!

4607
03:18:27,260 --> 03:18:28,000
Thank you, thank you!

4608
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:29,500
Hey, what do I get?

4609
03:18:30,160 --> 03:18:34,160
There's moon, stead, duration or damage.

4610
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:35,940
Okay, which one's duration?

4611
03:18:39,780 --> 03:18:41,040
Guys, which one's duration?

4612
03:18:43,460 --> 03:18:44,900
Is it... might?

4613
03:18:45,060 --> 03:18:46,360
Is it evergreen?

4614
03:18:46,740 --> 03:18:49,060
Or is it... which one is it?

4615
03:18:49,380 --> 03:18:53,460
I can't read this properly.

4616
03:18:56,780 --> 03:18:57,660
I see attack.

4617
03:18:57,940 --> 03:18:58,820
I see this one.

4618
03:18:59,020 --> 03:18:59,800
I'll get the attack.

4619
03:19:02,850 --> 03:19:03,790
Is this one?

4620
03:19:06,210 --> 03:19:07,830
Is the evergreen duration?

4621
03:19:09,190 --> 03:19:10,550
Might is duration, right?

4622
03:19:10,750 --> 03:19:12,050
Okay, we'll get that then.

4623
03:19:12,310 --> 03:19:13,030
All right.

4624
03:19:14,010 --> 03:19:15,070
I am reading!

4625
03:19:15,250 --> 03:19:16,830
I just don't understand!

4626
03:19:17,690 --> 03:19:20,510
I... I am reading!

4627
03:19:20,590 --> 03:19:21,930
I just don't understand!

4628
03:19:23,930 --> 03:19:25,470
That's a different thing!

4629
03:19:28,490 --> 03:19:30,370
Alright, we're gonna call it here.

4630
03:19:30,570 --> 03:19:31,090
That was fun!

4631
03:19:33,670 --> 03:19:35,410
I've been enjoying Wukong a lot.

4632
03:19:35,950 --> 03:19:41,430
I've heard that it's definitely a very long game though, so it's gonna take us like fucking forever to finish this game!

4633
03:19:41,430 --> 03:19:44,990
It's gonna take us so fucking long.

4634
03:19:46,510 --> 03:19:51,770
But it's been an enjoyable, wild ride so far.

4635
03:19:53,650 --> 03:19:55,170
And I'm gonna call it here.

4636
03:19:55,790 --> 03:20:00,830
It was not as long as my other Wukong streams, but this week has been a lot this week.

4637
03:20:00,990 --> 03:20:02,910
So I'm gonna take a rest.

4638
03:20:03,710 --> 03:20:05,530
I do have a convention later on.

4639
03:20:05,650 --> 03:20:07,750
A long day later tonight.

4640
03:20:07,970 --> 03:20:08,910
In like two hours.

4641
03:20:09,030 --> 03:20:10,190
Oh, in two hours by the way.

4642
03:20:10,190 --> 03:20:11,910
I have a panel in two hours, guys.

4643
03:20:12,130 --> 03:20:14,430
So I'm gonna call it here, everybody.

4644
03:20:14,790 --> 03:20:16,250
Thank you for all for watching.

4645
03:20:16,410 --> 03:20:20,650
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture checked, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4646
03:20:20,810 --> 03:20:22,970
And if you stay up for me, head to bed!

4647
03:20:23,110 --> 03:20:24,430
Cause you deserve it!

4648
03:20:24,550 --> 03:20:25,550
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4649
03:20:25,970 --> 03:20:26,730
Bye, guys!

4650
03:20:27,530 --> 03:20:27,930
Bye!
