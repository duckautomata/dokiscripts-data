11
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:06,130
gonna close down her massage parlor but why doki i thought
you were having such good business i was having too much of

12
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:13,990
a good thing you know like the business was going so well
that i can basically retire early i'm retiring like 30 years

13
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,950
early that was just how good the tips were just that good
you know it's like they gave away all their

14
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,770
Like, it was crazy.

15
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,610
Like, they didn't need their life savings anymore.

16
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,470
So, um, no, I didn't run out of clients.

17
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,530
No, no, no, no.

18
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:36,090
I was just doing such a good job that I'm retiring early,
uh, because, you know, people were just giving me so much

19
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,350
money after I finished my appointments.

20
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,390
It's crazy.

21
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,250
It's like their entire life savings.

22
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,350
It's just deleted so much stress out of them.

23
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,870
Um, I think I've been, like, pretty, uh, you know how I was
like, oh, yeah, I try to finish games in three streams.

24
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:57,870
I've been, like, I'm, like, so surprised at myself for,
being able to like keep that consistent the consistency of

25
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:06,150
like finishing a game after like three to four streams and
it's been like super consistent with me so let's hope that i

26
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,730
keep the i keep the pace with competing this game today i'm
gonna i'm gonna not end stream until i kill i mean uh fix

27
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:23,690
until i fix everybody's problems not kill i don't know where
you heard that Thank you.

28
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,650
Can you give us a summary of the story so far?

29
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,150
Like, last time in Shadow Colossus, thank you, the Super
Chat.

30
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,410
Thank you.

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:28,970
Thank you.

32
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:35,390
Last time in Shadow Colossus, I cured, I cured a bunch of
Colossi and they were happy.

33
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,150
The end.

34
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,690
Also, I, like, neutered one of them, I think.

35
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,430
I solved the iguana issue.

36
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,090
The invasive species of iguanas.

37
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,230
I solved that, too.

38
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,490
I'm just, I'm just a jack of all trades.

39
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:03,310
little life update oh my gosh i think like next week uh i
think next week i'm definitely going to uh take a bigger

40
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,710
break next week i'm gonna take like uh double because you
know usually i take sunday off um i think like next week i'm

41
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,910
gonna take sunday and monday off for next week just to like
uh because like one will be because i know it's like rest

42
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:25,830
day but haven't like rested in any my rest days yeah i mean
so i'm gonna take back to back rest days so one of them will

43
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:32,890
be the rest day rest day and then the other one will be the
rest work day so i'm gonna do like so next week i'm gonna

44
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:39,330

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,370
them will actually be resting also thank you for super chat
ninja thank you Thank you.

46
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,110
It's my niece's first birthday.

47
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,850
I thought it would be best to open the credit card in their
name and send you a super chat with that card.

48
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,350
Thank you for the super chat.

49
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:54,810
Thank you.

50
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,670
Thank you, ninja.

51
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,330
You know what would be even a funnier?

52
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,270
I mean, like, even better idea.

53
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,550
If, like, you just didn't give her that credit card.

54
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,310
You just, you know.

55
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,170
Okay, this is, like, an ethical life hack.

56
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:13,410
But, like, you know, like, after the kid is born, you know,
open a credit card in their name.

57
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:21,190
know like you know give them good credit you know they might
have a little bit of debt and then when they hit when they

58
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:27,690
hit at an age where they have their own money um you can
give them the card and be like don't worry i used it to help

59
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:35,750
you build up credit now all you have to do is pay off the
debt pay off that all you have to do is pay off the credit

60
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:43,490
card debt and then you'll have great credit what start them
off young not ruin their credit score it's their fault don't

61
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:54,550
pay it off like that's credit fraud look i i did say
non-ethical life hack okay i made sure to say it's not that

62
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,610
ethical it's just a little bit not that ethical and like for
legal reasons let me just say this is a joke in case the irs

63
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:08,110
is watching okay the irs is american what the fuck are you
gonna do to me i'm in canada okay anyway uh might not be

you got anyway life updates we have new sub badges to be

69
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:06,250
fair we've had new sub badges for like a couple of days now
but really haven't had the time to really announce it

70
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,010
because we haven't really had like I was like I think I was
like super tad so I didn't really I forgot to talk about it

71
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,170
but yes Let me see if I can I'll pull it up after the
stream.

72
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:23,750
I'm not the stream I'll pull it up after we beat the game
like the actual like the the artwork for it But yes, yes,

73
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,790
you some of you guys might have already skipped the tomato
and the egg form So now you're actually dragoons now, but

74
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:40,430
like we have new sub badges Oh my god, look at all these
dragoons Any fresh tomatoes out there that we can eat

75
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:53,810
anywhere so speaking of wear tomatoes we have a new doki
bite short um from uh llama and like they really i don't

76
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,210
know if you guys know it but it's actually like a spiritual
continuation of the other short that llama make where like

77
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:08,110
it was like a magical girl transformation and then the
backwards for like the wear tomato so the wear tomato

78
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:20,390
transformation i just need you guys to know tone it down a
lot more than what the original was the original was like

79
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:34,510
the original was was a little bit more graphic just saying I
was like oh yeah no we gotta oh yeah we gotta we gotta

80
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:42,330
change that up like yo even though this isn't really a
Christian stream like you know this isn't really for kids

81
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,910
But like we don't want to be R-rated, you know, we just want
to be R-rated.

82
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,510
Lord Crow says, thank you for the 10, get the shares, thank
you, thank you.

83
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,030
Also, Trash Boy, welcome back to the tomato farm, welcome,
welcome.

84
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:11,330
But yes, anyway, so it was originally the quote-unquote
tomato juice was more tomato, tomato, I got flavored, sorry,

85
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,310
was more tomato.

86
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:25,030
colored i was like oh yeah no let's just dang on rompa this
i was like oh yeah we're gonna have to dang on rompa this a

87
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:32,070
bit so people you know so youtube won't be like is that
blood because i've got hit by it's very surprising because i

88
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:38,330
actually didn't get hit by limited for the short because i
said to change it to dang on rompa color for those who don't

89
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:51,930
know the reference it's like like ketchup you know and then
um um release the llama cut thank you for the super chat

90
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,530
dark blade thank you thank you so i was like yeah let's just
yeah let's make the tomato juices like you know more neon

91
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:06,070
pink instead of you know tomato ketchup colored because i
don't you know i don't want to fucking i don't want to get

92
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:15,790
in trouble here and also like the sounds was a lot worse It
was, there was, okay, so there was one where, I don't know,

93
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,470
if you watched the short, there was one where the leaves
were coming out of the head, and then there was the, it was

94
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:29,330
the sound for that was not great, like, it was very, like,
yeah, and I was like, bro, okay, we're gonna remove the

95
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:35,350
sound for the head part, because, like, I think, like, you
know, all the others, you know, you can see the stick limbs,

96
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,970
but then on the head, when you hear that sound, it's pretty
bad.

97
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:50,590
especially when it's at the head so we're gonna i'm gonna
have to ask to remove that because

98
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,570
because i'm worried

99
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:07,850
so so we had to we had to like tone it down a little bit
because i didn't want to i just want you guys to know the

100
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:15,010
reason why i asked to tone it down was because like the
experience i've Not on this channel, but there was a short

101
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:24,190
on another channel that like got hit by limited ads and was
like Was like marked by YouTube because there was like blood

102
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:33,590
on it and it's they're like no, no, no That's blood So I was
like, so I was like, okay now I know it's funny that the

103
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,530
sound didn't get hit by the limited ads But I think it's cuz
they're like oh, hey look it's not red.

104
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,610
So it's not actually blood.

105
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,570
So you're okay, dokey Yo, like, you're okay, Doki.

106
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,170
I was like, oh my gosh, I was so surprised.

107
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,210
Anyway, artistic integrity is shabbo's plastic.

108
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:52,730
Thank you, man.

109
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,130
Magenta soup, but thank you, thank you.

110
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:05,830
So I got from that experience, I figured out, like, how to
bypass the, um, how to bypass, like, the censorship on, um,

111
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,770
on YouTube, because apparently at, at companies, like, the
current version.

112
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,310
Also, another funny thing regarding updates.

113
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:18,190
dates so i was like talking to my youtube guy being like so
why is like some of my vods getting hit by limited recently

114
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:24,130
because i've never had that experience before and then my
youtube guy was like looking through the vods because like i

115
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:31,210
have to like i get hit by limited and then after the stream
i get hit by limited and then i have to like appeal it i

116
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:37,070
have to like actually appeal it and be like why is this hit
by limited like what the fuck's going on and then my youtube

117
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:44,230
guy looked at it by the way like like the content warning uh
i got hit by limited ads on content warning stream so I got

118
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:51,570
really confused I was like why the fuck did I get my limited
ads and then I appealed it and then they got like fixed the

119
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:57,950
date like a couple hours later and then my YouTube guy was
like oh yeah I'm looking through the vibes and I think it's

120
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,970
because of profile

121
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:14,550
and you're like yeah like you swear a lie I was like, what
the fuck?

122
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,330
I was like, what do you mean?

123
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,510
Profanity.

124
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,950
And he was like, well, you do swear a lot in the beginning
of these videos.

125
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,510
And I think like the auto detection was like, that's a lot
of swearing.

126
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,270
He's like, he's like, I guess it's profanity.

127
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,110
I can't see why else you got hit.

128
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,530
And then, and then I was like, that is bullshit.

129
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,650
Okay, I didn't say that.

130
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,950
I was like, okay, this is why I say it.

131
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:52,450
I was like, that's so weird because in the past I rarely if
ever got hit by profanity.

132
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,550
So I was like, what do you mean profanity?

133
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,250
I've never changed the way I talk.

134
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,930
I've always had profanity.

135
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,370
Why now?

136
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:03,970
Why?

137
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:12,250
I was like, why did I get hit by profanity now of all time?

138
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:22,410
games so um um so yeah so that's why i've been being hit by
limited but thing is i just have to peel it and then they're

139
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:29,310
like okay you're good now but it was so weird i was like it
hits me like ever so often like one or two streams like

140
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:34,910
it'll be like one stream and then the next stream will be
okay or maybe two streams in a row will hit get hit by

141
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,930
limited and the next stream will be okay i just have to peel
it every time i peel it they're like good to go but it's i

142
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:53,410
was so surprised i like profanity another update another
life update um i've been so fucking busy because like every

143
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:59,970
day i have like oh my gosh i have like these like business
meetings or like business decisions to make and stuff like

144
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:09,530
that oh my gosh i don't want to like spoil anything but um
it's been a problem where i have so many it's so difficult i

145
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,130
hate making decisions i hate making choices Especially when
I do want to do everything.

146
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,450
Goodbye, Arlo.

147
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,050
He's going to be the main character again.

148
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,090
Because there's instances where...

149
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,150
So one of these things I can talk about is that, you know,
like, the Doki Bird World Tour.

150
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,170
It's come to a point where we have...

151
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,090
There's, like, so many conventions are asking for me to be a
guest.

152
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,270
That, like, the dates are conflicting with each other.

153
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,610
So I have to pick and choose which convention I want to do.

154
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,750
And I was like, I hate it because I want to do them all!

155
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:49,150
I wanted to do them all so then I was like oh my gosh like
it's like there's like so many conventions and I was like oh

156
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,030
man I want to do this and I also want to do that and I also
want to do that but I have to pick one because there's only

157
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:03,550
one dokey bird for those days and I was like no there's so
many so like there's going to be a point where there's going

158
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:12,570
to be a convention for me like almost every month um we
haven't hit that streak we have obviously like there's no in

159
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:23,490
April because I got I was a little too late but like we're
gonna have a convention almost like a convention guest

160
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,910
almost every month and it's gonna be like around the world
type deal so it's like oh it won't be like just focusing on

161
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:36,730
one area just NA or anything just think it's the world tour
for a reason it's the world tour for a reason so just get

162
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:46,670
ready we're just gonna be a lot of jokey bird so Oh my gosh,
but it makes me so sad because I can only pick like what

163
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:53,310
like I can only do like what not like Like you know when
there's so many going at the same time like on the same

164
00:17:53,310 --> 00:18:01,390
dates too I think that's the worst part when they're on the
same date and I can only do one and I'm like No, but what if

165
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:08,490
I want to do them on Is that fair?

166
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:25,630
But yeah, that's basically what it's been like at the moment

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,750

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,290
Okay, so the next colossal...

204
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,610

206
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,630
This is my next appointment.

207
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,310
I have so many projects.

208
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:52,870
going on behind the scenes but it's actually you're like how
many are you how how much stuff are you doing behind the

209
00:20:52,870 --> 00:21:06,790
scenes i'm like yes every day i wake up to like 20 plus
discord messages i was like i wake up i was like oh dear are

210
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:18,030

was actually crazy.

211
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,730
We have so many.

212
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,610
Like, I know, like, the last couple of weeks there hasn't
been anything, like, really...

213
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,670
I don't know.

214
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,090
We haven't really have anything, like, major, big on the
channel yet.

215
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,850
But, like, it's because, like, there's so many things going
on.

216
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,870
And behind the scenes, that's going to build up soon.

217
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,470
So we can actually have something fun on the channel.

218
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,890
How do I...

219
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,950
Is it, like, this way?

220
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,750
I guess it's on the...

221
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,970
It has to be on the other side.

222
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,170
We're still cooking.

223
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,690
We're cooking so many things right now.

224
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,050
Back to back.

225
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:53,810
Cease.

226
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,030
You're gonna burn out.

227
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,330
Guys, the thing is, I'm like a huge workaholic.

228
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,150
But like, also like, I still, I do need, like, rest days,
though.

229
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,850
The reason why I have rest days is because I do want to rest
at some points.

230
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,010
But, like, I mean, like, I can, like, work as well on the
rest day.

231
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,850
But, like, I just want to, like, not talk.

232
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,310
Like, you know, be like, be like a...

233
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:22,710
mute for a day and i think like that's what's like like
tilting for me when i have to like do like actually use my

234
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:32,810
mouth when i have to actually like talk and like do like
business meetings and make like business decisions on my

235
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:40,470
rest day like but i can't like do it via text i'm fine if
like it's via text or something like oh make this decision

236
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,750
and then like have i been here before Have I killed the
salamander here before?

237
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:46,970
Time to pray.

238
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,570
But, like, if it's like...

239
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,130
I don't know.

240
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,370
Actually, can't tell.

241
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,250
I can't tell.

242
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,750
All these shrines are blurring together.

243
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,270
Oh, no, I haven't!

244
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,770
Look, there's a salamander right here!

245
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:04,490
But, like, um, if I have to, like, use my mouth during my
resting, that's when I get tilted.

246
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:11,710
That's when I'm like, please, please, I just want to be a
mute for a day and not talk.

247
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,730
and make sure my throat will be okay.

248
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,150
Where the fuck is that bitch?

249
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,830
I thought we solved the invasive species issue.

250
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,150
Where is it?

251
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,390

261
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,090

I don't see him anymore.

272
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,070
He vanished.

The other one, the others just like walked into my mouth.

304
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,130
I don't know why.

305
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,970

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,950

Oh, up.

313
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,490
There we go.

314
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,670
Where the fuck is Salamander again?

315
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,450
Where did he go?

316
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,430
Where did he go?

317
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,570
Where is he?

318
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,070
Oh, I hear him.

319
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,550
No!

320
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:53,510
Stop!

321
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,730
I hear his feet.

322
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,090
They're like Bomberman feet.

323
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,350
Okay.

324
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,350
Where is he?

325
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:12,370
Okay, if I do it like this, will he, like, if I stealth,
maybe if I stealth like this, he'll show up.

326
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,250
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, climb back up.

327
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,990
Please, I need that stamina.

328
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,550
Where did he go?

329
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,410
How did you see me?

330
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,210
Oh, oh, he didn't see me.

331
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,650
He didn't see me.

332
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,650
He's just casually back there.

333
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,310
This is so fucked up.

334
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,570
This is so fucked up.

335
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,210
How the fuck do I get to here?

336
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,170
Okay, what if I, like...

337
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:41,970
Oh, I got an idea.

338
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,450
I got an idea.

339
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,410
I'm just gonna slowly walk to the other side.

340
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:54,290
I'm gonna slowly walk to the other side and then like I'll
have the perfect angle on him right here come on you gotta

341
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:07,090
get up you gotta climb up you can't hang in there forever oh
there you go the perfect angle nice okay there you go that's

342
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:14,810
gonna hit the side watch this okay now watch this There he
got told you!

343
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:15,670
Where did he go?

344
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,650
Where did he go?

345
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,370
Oh my god, he has to be dead.

346
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,790
There's no way he's alive.

347
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,950
Oh yeah, he fucking disappeared.

348
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,830
Thank god.

349
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,230
That has to be the hardest one so far.

350
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,230
I knew it.

351
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,950
Alright, time to kill... Now time to kill the colossi.

352
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,350
Alright, where is it?

353
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,590
Nope, that's not the sword.

354
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,490
When will I get a magic bow?

355
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,830
I feel like I deserve it.

356
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,390
This way, okay.

357
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,650
All right.

358
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,730
Thank you to that backseater that told me that I don't have
to actually navigate my horse.

359
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,430
I don't have to actually move my horse.

360
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,810
He does the auto-travel for me.

361
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,410
Okay, where is that?

362
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,470
Where the fuck is that?

363
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:03,610
Is this?

364
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,710
There's no aces here.

365
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,250
God, I wish the maps actually work.

366
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,930
Okay.

367
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,950
Oh, wait.

368
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,050
Have I consumed these fruits before?

369
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,090
No, I haven't.

370
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,130
All right, it's fruit time.

371
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,970
It's time to eat the fruit.

372
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,410
All right, let's see.

373
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,210
Fruit time.

374
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,750
Snack break.

375
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,550
All right.

376
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,110
Poop.

377
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,910
Can horses just eat grass and survive?

378
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,150
Or do they actually need real food?

379
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,150
Is it possible if you just like...

380
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,590
Oh, hey.

381
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,930
Did they just eat grass?

382
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,690
Can they survive?

383
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,510
Wait, that's really?

384
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,950
They don't need actual hay?

385
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,970
So, like, I can just leave a horse in somebody's backyard
and they'll be okay.

386
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,730
Can we live off grass?

387
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,110
So, like, does that mean, like, humans can live off grass,
too?

388
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,910
Are we just, like, fucked?

389
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,790
Because, like, grass is vegetables.

390
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,050
You think about it?

391
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,710
No?

392
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,450
Why not?

393
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,690
Why can animals live off grass if we can't?

394
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:23,210
they still need water there's water on grass like grass need
water to live and then like if grass need water to live it's

395
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:32,150
like cactus when you eat a cactus there's water inside we
can't digest grass you need more stomachs to digest grass

396
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:43,890
god we're so fucking weak why can't we genetically modify
ourselves dude that this is why we need survival the fittest

397
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:56,610
we should so you know how like for insects you know how like
we selected bred them and wait that's eugenics wait that's

398
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:04,990
bad disregard everything

399
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:17,030
guys that was a joke guys that was a joke Guys, that was a
joke.

400
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,330
That was a joke.

401
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,490
That was a fucking joke, guys.

402
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,690
Pull back.

403
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:25,610
Pull back.

404
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,610
We don't need six stomachs, guys.

405
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,210
No, we don't need six stomachs.

406
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,090
We're fine.

407
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,770
We don't need six stomachs, guys.

408
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,110
One is good enough.

409
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,730
Why would we need to eat grass?

410
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,950
Don't be fucking stupid, chat.

411
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,110
Don't be fucking...

412
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,350
Don't be stupid.

413
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,510
What is enough?

414
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,070
Why would we need all these?

415
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,250
Where the fuck is my son GPS?

416
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,570
Where is my son GPS?

417
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,730
Oh my god!

418
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,670
We're in a desert and I don't have a GPS.

419
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,030
How do I live?

420
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,590
Oh, it's right here.

421
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,630
It's right here.

422
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,870
Don't deny me my third stomach like this.

423
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:21,250
all I'm saying is that okay you know how like how stick
insects are born like how we've like how stick insects like

424
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:29,190
evolved basically like it's not that they know what sticks
look like is that eventually the insect like you know the

425
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:36,910
insects that don't look like a stick got eaten up too many
times by the birds and then like at one point that the

426
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:44,430
insects that looked like sticks were able to live on and
like breed like crazy and then become the sick insects that

427
00:31:44,430 --> 00:32:00,470
it's become so like we should ethically speaking it's so
fucked up but like don't double down what if like okay what

428
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:09,070
if okay what if like all right there's gonna be a little bit
of like uh like like philosophy of thing Like, it's gonna be

429
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:14,090
based off that movie with, like, Andrew Garfield, where,
like, the clone, we clone, we start cloning.

430
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,750
Like, at one point, we're gonna be able to start cloning.

431
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,990
And then we clone, like, these people.

432
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,930
We start cloning ourselves, but they have, like, no...

433
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,930
Because they're clones.

434
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,330
You know, they have, you know, they're not real...

435
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,870
They're not real people, if you think about them.

436
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,410
Okay.

437
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,370
So, like, so, like, we put these clones.

438
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,110
We put these clones in a room, and it's just grass.

439
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,950
And the room will just be grass.

440
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:48,650
You know?

441
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:59,890
And then, and then, so, like, the thing is, um, the thing
is, eventually the clone with the three, eventually the

442
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,810
clones will evolve until, until...

443
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,870
I'm not ignoring him.

444
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,150
Try to figure out the GPS right now.

445
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:17,350
the clones will evolve in a way where they eventually have
more than one stomach because we just put them in a room

446
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:26,250
filled with grass and then at one point at one point the
clones will be able to have all they'll be able to evolve

447
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:34,130
into like people with like more than one stomach and then we
take those clones and then they are now they and then like

448
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:44,550
you know we we put them with the real humans And then
they'll make peepa babies from the clone DNA with like more

449
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,490
than one stomach.

450
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,910
There you go.

451
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,590
Where the fuck is the entrance?

452
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,690
Is it here?

453
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,630
Have I been like dodging this hole this entire?

454
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,170
No, that's not a...

455
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,630
That does not look like a safe hole.

456
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,130
That is...

457
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,630
Unless...

458
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,790
Unless...

459
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,910
It has to be here.

460
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:22,650
where else would it be i've been like fucking walking around
to the same hole multiple times it has to be this hole where

461
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:33,570
else could it be okay this seems safe right it is a safe
what if i'm just trying to make the optimal human where we

462
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:41,830
can survive off grass alone food shortages we can literally
just go outside and eat the grass if we have more than one

463
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:51,970
stomach like think about it guys if we have more than one
stomach then we can just eat grass and then it'll be like

464
00:34:51,970 --> 00:35:01,850
optimal survival the optimal human because like at that
point we'll have like enough we'll we'll be able to like

465
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:08,450
consume oh my god it's all the way over there okay but what
if i just It can't be that bad.

466
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,790
I mean, I already prayed.

467
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:10,970
Okay, guys.

468
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,090
Alright.

469
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,750
Guys, I'm stuck.

I lived!

477
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,320
I fucking knew it!

478
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,060
I knew it would work.

479
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,240
I knew it would work, guys.

480
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,860
I'm a fucking genius.

481
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,160
Arlo, get down from here.

482
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:52,580
I lived I lived Guys this is it guys I am the ultimate human
being If we like If we clone me And

483
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:07,980
Guys Guys We can have like Doki clones that can survive

642
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,760

646
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,540

Another client satisfied Yeah, you guys see the chiropractor

651
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:28,590
he tries the fucking break of dogs while he was out breaking
the dogs back but like it's so disturbing because it's like

652
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:40,860
how do you know if they like it like how do you know they
actually like that they can't verbally tell you be like that

653
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,000
that that is not helping

654
00:47:47,640 --> 00:48:02,790
that's the neat part they don't just ask the dog hey little
doggy was Is that a happy yelp or a not happy yelp?

655
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,670

00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,250
They looked relaxed.

673
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:47,190
I just wondered, like, how do you trial and error it
correctly to become a professional, too?

674
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:52,390
Because it's like, dog skeletons are not the same as human
skeletons.

675
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:58,530
So, I'm just like, how- Y'all just all look very- Yeah,

doing and like suddenly their bones feel different like oh

00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:17,310
my god that's not like that's so freaking freaky

678
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:27,630
it's like oh my god like how we invent stuff you don't think
like how long it took for us to in bed.

679
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:33,990
Okay, this is fucked up for me to say, but it's like, when
did we figure out how to neutering?

680
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,870
It's like, it's similar.

681
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:44,330
It's like, it's similar.

682
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:44,670
It's similar.

683
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,930
The trial and error.

684
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:52,690
When did we figure out how how neutering works?

685
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,730
It's, all of them stop smiling after.

686
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,450
How long did it take?

687
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:00,810
The same with poison.

688
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,950
The fact that we know what's poisonous and what's not.

689
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:10,170
Like, you have to remember how many times it takes us to,
like, figure out which mushrooms we can eat and which we

690
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:10,550
can't.

691
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:14,830
It's like, there's, like, mushrooms that look the same to
each other.

692
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:15,770
And then...

693
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:22,110
And then we have to, like, figure out what mushroom was,
like, poisonous and which one wasn't.

694
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:23,230
There's some of the...

695
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,110
Yeah, they're like, what the fuck?

696
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,590
They're like, the fuck?

697
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,170
All right, we go...

698
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,890
Is this the water?

699
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,290
Is the water there?

700
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,230
Wait, is it underneath here?

701
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:44,250
It's like how, like, back in the medieval times, there would
be poison testers.

702
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,150
We know, yeah, exactly.

703
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:48,870
Experience.

704
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,190
Not our experience.

705
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:52,630
Oh, no.

706
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,030
Not the wand.

707
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,310
We gotta find...

708
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,950

There's no way I'll die from this lake, right?

718
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,460
No, that seems like a pretty deep lake.

720
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,680

Maybe the other side?

758
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,090

759
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,230

00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,170
You can make that jump.

You totally can't.

764
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:02,850

00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,690
Trial and error, Doki.

Now!

877
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,340
This has to be the lake.

878
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,500
Oh my god, there's the lake.

879
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:11,080
How the fuck do I get into the lake?

880
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:12,600
Oh, I have to climb.

881
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:13,780
Okay.

882
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:15,320
Alright.

883
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,520
Don't worry, Arlo.

884
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,340
You can swim too, Arlo, right?

885
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,000
Arlo, just do the jump.

886
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,260
It'll be so funny.

887
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,060
Arlo!

888
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,020
It'll be so funny if you make that jump.

889
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,740
You have more momentum!

890
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,760
We actually made it to the lake.

891
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,100
Oh, thank fucking god.

892
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:45,820
we made it holy shit there's way too many lakes in this area
there's way too many fucking lakes guys all right that'll

893
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:58,160
not go yay he has to be here right all right is it faster if
I swim underwater it is right sorry I can hold my breath for

894
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:06,020
a long time i ate in the the more salamander tails you eat
the longer you can hold your breath real i learned this in

895
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:19,260
the video game guys every time because we all know video
games are so real where is he where is this monster oh why

896
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:32,360
is there like three podiums there yeah of course i eat those
salamander tails me guys i'm thinking like can salamander

897
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:39,680
tails be food because like it's like an infinite food glitch
you know you get a bunch of salamanders and like you know

898
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:45,140
they can regrow their tails right so like all you i feel
like if i had this conversation i feel like i've had this

899
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:58,980
conversation before but but like think about it like um
because like the tails are still meat you know just you just

900
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:06,760
you just like farm a bunch of salamanders and then and then
all you do is just you know every time you're hungry you eat

901
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:14,820
the salamander tail and then wait for it to regrow and then
and then but then you have like a farm of them and they just

902
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:27,140
they don't always grow back then you just kill it it's we're
back to selective breeding like we evolved oh shit that

903
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:32,620
guy's cool We involve the ones that, like, that grow their
tails faster.

904
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,820
Okay, we keep them on a farm.

905
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,680
It's like the whole grass thing again.

906
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,380
And then...

907
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,120
Oh, shit.

908
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,060
Ow, that hurt.

909
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,900
But he has electricity and water?

910
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,540
Oh, my God.

911
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,680
That's fucked up.

912
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,300
Why do you have electricity power?

913
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,200
It's fucking water.

914
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,900
You're just gonna, like, electrocute yourself.

915
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,720
Oh, God.

916
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:56,120
Okay.

917
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,800
Okay, he doesn't see me.

918
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,000
You can't.

919
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,240
This is not realistic.

920
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:03,700
I should have been electrified as well as all the fish
around me.

921
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,300
No, all I'm saying is infinite food glitch.

922
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,320
Just think about it.

923
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,960
It's literally an infinite food glitch because they can grow
back their tails.

924
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,140
So, like, if you're hungry, you just eat the tails and
they're still alive.

925
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,160
They're still alive, right?

926
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:23,040
So, oh my God, please for the love of God, where can I climb
you?

927
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:36,080
you stop following me okay oh this is not fair because he
turns faster than me swimming like how the fuck am I

928
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:46,820
supposed to figure this out yeah we feed the bugs bugs
reproduce so fast salamanders eat bugs right so like oh god

929
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:55,520
okay so like all we do is we oh wait I see it I see it it's
a tail it's a tail my tail theory it's the tail theory guys

930
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:01,200
all over again okay It's the tail theory.

931
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,680
We climb the tail.

932
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,500
Oh my god, please for the love of God.

933
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,460
Maybe I'll swim faster than the weight.

934
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:11,640
Maybe if I swim faster, it'll work.

935
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,560
Oh my god, I fucking knew it's the tail.

936
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:16,980
Alright, here you go.

937
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:17,460
Here you go.

938
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,100
I knew it.

939
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,680
I knew it was gonna be the tail.

940
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,560
It's always the tail.

941
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,300
That's just the theory.

942
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,260
Tail theory.

943
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,440
Oh, I'm seeing.

944
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,860
Like, salamanders, they just need...

945
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,360
bugs, right?

946
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,960
And bugs reproduce crazy fucking fast.

947
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,640
So like, if you're hungry, we give the salamander bugs and
then... What?

948
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,100
Where is it?

949
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,880
Where the fuck is it?

950
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,300
Why does he have like teeth on his head?

951
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:46,380
Where do I take him?

952
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,160
Why is he at like... What?

953
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,440
Why is there teeth on his head?

954
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,060
That's not where you... Why do you have teeth on your head?

955
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,740
Oh god, oh god.

956
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,000
There's no shit.

957
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,060
Oh, shit!

958
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:04,560
Okay.

959
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,980
Oh, that's got to hurt if you hit the tooth straight on.

960
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,660
Oh, I can steer it.

961
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,680
Like a steering wheel.

962
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,060
It's like my very own car.

963
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,940
Bro, this is better than a horse.

964
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,100
Although, I don't mean it.

965
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,540
You know that because I still need you.

966
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,640
You know I don't mean it.

967
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,700
You know, it's like a xylophone teeth.

968
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,800
Can I, like, take him to, like, the other claw?

969
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,400
I assume I have to go here, right?

970
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,540
Like, where else would I fucking go?

971
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,420
Now I'm a dentist.

972
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,440
Guys, now I'm a licensed dentist now.

973
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,100

Honestly, you definitely need braces.

977
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,720

978
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,660

991
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,020
Oh, what are you doing?

992
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:08,940
Oh, my God.

993
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,340
You're giving me your belly?

994
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,240
What do I do here?

995
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:13,960
Oh!

996
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,340
Oh, my God!

997
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,140
Okay, guys.

998
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,400
He needs a belly rub.

999
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,280
Isn't that cute?

1000
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,820
Guys, he needs a little belly rub here.

1001
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:26,600
Don't worry.

1002
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,500
Those juices.

1003
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,140
It's just all the oil from excitement.

1004
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,320
Oh shit!

1005
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,280
Fuck, okay.

1006
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,500
Alright, don't worry, I'm okay.

1007
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,240
I'm okay, guys.

1008
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:41,500
I'm okay.

1009
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,800
I just gave him a little belly rub and he got a little too
excited.

1010
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,060
Guys, come on, let me through.

1011
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,420
Let me through.

1012
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,820
It's like a dentist, like, okay, if a dentist gives you
belly rub, that is not a licensed dentist.

1013
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:56,380
Just silly.

1014
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,740
But I'm different.

1015
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,200
I'm different.

1016
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,120
I'm a specialist.

1017
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:11,300
If a dentist after your procedure tries to give you belly
rubs, I don't think that's a real dentist, guys.

1018
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,520
I think you might.

1019
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,540
I think you might got scammed.

1020
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,420
Unless it's jokey.

1021
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,460
Unless it's jokey.

1022
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,520
I'm a specialist.

1023
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,200
It's like my thing.

1024
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:26,800
I was like, you know, children dentists where like there's
dentists that are just primarily for kids and they have

1025
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,740
these like weird ass offices like kid themed dentist
offices.

1026
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:40,160
I was watching a video where there was a dentist there was a
dentist that specializes on just children and then the thing

1027
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:48,280
is like their entire office was like they have an elevator
in their office like in the procedure room to entertain kids

1028
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:59,400
and I'm like Jesus fucking like they have an actual like
mini elevator where where they do like some willy walk a

1029
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:12,000
shit some willy walk a shit to like make the kids feel
comfortable but it's still like fucking crazy oh god oh sir

1030
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:25,700
i know you gotta stop eating candy look at your overgrown
teeth it's like the bread oh okay i'm okay um i didn't i

1031
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:29,500
didn't uh I didn't ply anything.

1032
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,040
Alright, here we go.

1033
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:33,740
We can climb.

1034
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,100
That was close.

1035
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,840
I'm holding off for dear life right now.

1036
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,980
I don't know what you're talking about, guys.

1037
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,620
I don't know what you're talking about.

1038
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,860
This is how dentist works.

1039
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,500
You guys might not know because you don't see your own
mouth.

1040
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,060
This is what the dentist looks like when you're fixing...

1041
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,400
When they're fixing your teeth.

1042
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,320
You just smack it until something happens.

1043
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:58,760
Turn around.

1044
01:15:59,440 --> 01:15:59,980
Keep turning.

1045
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,180
Who keeps hitting my cavities?

1046
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,060
This is why they put, like, those, um...

1047
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,060
Those, like, anesthesia?

1048
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:09,940
No, not anesthesia.

1049
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,360
What are those things that make your fucking mouth numb?

1050
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:14,060
This is what they do.

1051
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,960
You just whack it.

1052
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,460
I love my Eldritch Horror Dentist, Ariel.

1053
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:23,960
That should be it, right?

1054
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,040

1071
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:24,070
that only specializes on teeth but you've got the
chiropractor dentist acupuncturist massage parlor neuter is

1072
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:25,350
that's not my Fuck.

1073
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:27,790
You could have went for the real deal.

1074
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:31,950
I am real.

1075
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:37,290
But he could have went for the actual specialist dentist
that only works on teeth.

1076
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:41,610
I'm the one with being good at a lot.

1077
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:46,470
Like, being decent at a lot of things means that you're not
good at one thing.

1078
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:54,130
So all I'm saying is that I might not have as much time
doing it.

1079
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:59,250
head teeth versus like massage massages

1080
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:13,310
Jack of all's yeah exactly Jack of all trades master no
exactly Look it doesn't I might be able to have a license on

1081
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:17,950
all of them, but it doesn't mean I am the best at all

1082
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:30,810
Guys I just have a certificate I like pass It doesn't mean I
got a good grade.

1083
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,050
It just means I passed.

1084
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,470
It just means like that.

1085
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:43,630
Another happy client.

Thank you.

1093
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:16,710
I want to watch his stuff.

1094
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:24,130
He's like, uh, He's really I think like any comedian because
like I feel like in order to like master comedy You have to

1095
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,690
be like really smart.

1096
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:32,690
I feel like like a lot of like really good like it's so come
like Universal comedy like things that make people who are

1097
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:37,690
the fuck are these people are they trying to encroach in my
territory Guys, I claim this territory.

1098
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:43,170
This is my neuter massage acupuncturist dentist area.

1099
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:46,930
I claim that it's like it's like gangs like this is my turf.

1100
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:47,870
What are you fuck are you doing?

1101
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:49,350
get out of my turf

1102
01:21:52,920 --> 01:22:03,020
but I feel like like because you have to be smart to be able
to write humor that's like funny that's universally funny um

1103
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:12,680
and like especially humor that sort of transcends like uh
transcends like uh language barriers and like a lot of my

1104
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:20,760
favorite comedians yeah to write good humor a lot of my
favorite comedians I went to like are like ivy league

1105
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:32,960
graduates too and i feel like a good comedian actor can make
can like uh can be an amazing are like i mean can be like

1106
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:40,840
what is this the vast desert oh no not the desert not the
fucking dry lakes

1107
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:55,470
i feel like a lot of comedians are really good actors in
general because like you have to be a really good actor to

1108
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:06,810
make comedy movies work to make a comedy movie seem natural
i feel like especially improv too to be you have to be like

1109
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:16,230
really smart to be able to do improv correctly because like
there can be like super cringe improv like i feel like a lot

1110
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:23,850
of like super good actors like super good comedian actors
they're actually like really good actors in general adam

1111
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:30,910
sandler my favorite actor okay when adam sandler actually
does drama he's a really good actor but he just gets paid

1112
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:37,250
more being a comedian because he just like he doesn't he
doesn't do indie movie films a lot or drama because indie

1113
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:46,790
films and movie films don't pay as much and because of that
um because of that he just does uh he just does like

1114
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:54,350
comedies because he gets a bigger deal Like it gets a bigger
like move gets a bigger pay cut Because if you think like if

1115
01:23:54,350 --> 01:24:00,450
you think like like the Netflix deal he had that paid so
much money And then you're like okay like that movie he did

1116
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:06,350
a pixel You know the worst fucking Adam one of the worst
fucking Adam Sandler movie of all time He basically hired

1117
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:10,230
all his friends so like that they get free paid vacation

1118
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:22,830
He literally did he did that movie so he could get like a
free paid vacation um because he doesn't care he just wants

1119
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:29,990
to have like he just hear the fucking make money to support
his family and his friends yeah all he does is just hire his

1120
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:43,190
friends so his friends can get paid and also and also like
um he can get paid as well i can't forgive him for pics but

1121
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:50,670
then when he does like drama movies he's actually really
like i i like watched uncut gems But I could only watch up

1122
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:58,050
to like a certain point because it was just So good and like
it is like you know what a movie is like for me when a movie

1123
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:06,210
is too good And depressing I just stopped watching because I
got too fucking depressed watching it I was just like oh my

1124
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:12,030
god this feels too real and then I stopped watching it
because it was way Too real and I was like bro I'm getting

1125
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:21,530
really sad and then I stopped but it was good it was a good
movie but like i was just super anxious watching it because

1126
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:31,710
it was so fucking high tension and then uh it was like super
high tension and then like super depressing and i had to

1127
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:35,250
stop watching it because it was actually too good

1128
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:47,110
but yeah that's why i that's honestly what i believe i feel
like comedians are like a lot of comedians or the comedy

1129
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:54,310
actors and actresses are like really good at acting in
general because it takes a lot of skill to make comedy

1130
01:25:54,310 --> 01:26:06,550
movies work in general because like you gotta it has you
have to try to make it not cringe like what's your name uh i

1131
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:11,050
say kate mckinnon uh oh my gosh where the Fuck the alcohol.

1132
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,330
Who is that desert?

1133
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:16,030
Is it Kate McKinnon that...

1134
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:17,030
I'm trying to remember.

1135
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:17,970
No, not Kate McKinnon.

1136
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:18,930
There's the other one.

1137
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:20,430
The other one...

1138
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:22,750
Before Kate McKinnon, there's the other one.

1139
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:23,990
Try to remember.

1140
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:29,190
There was this female actress that's, like, been in a lot of
comedy films.

1141
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:30,710
The wife of Despicable...

1142
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:32,830
The wife of the guy who's in Despicable...

1143
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:38,430
Okay.

1144
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:39,330
Okay.

1145
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:40,330
I'm trying to remember what...

1146
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:43,650
other role she did, but all I can remember is the wife of...

1147
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:44,670
Oh, Kristen Whig!

1148
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:45,230
Yes!

1149
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:47,050
Kristen Whig!

1150
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:56,990
Okay, you know Kristen Whig in a lot of, like, um, in a lot
of, like, comedy films, but she has done, like, some drama

1151
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:57,430
stuff.

1152
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:59,210
Like, they're, like, sort of Indies, though.

1153
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,650
They're, like, indie films, but she's such a good actress.

1154
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:02,930
I watched, like, I'm trying...

1155
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:06,350
There was, like, one she did where she was, like,
apparently, like, pretending to...

1156
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:06,890
Like, not pretending.

1157
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:09,050
She was, like, a twin sister of Bill Hader or something.

1158
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:09,910
Like, that was the plot.

1159
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,650
And like, also Bill Hader too.

1160
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:17,250
Bill Hader in that movie where he's the assassin, that one
was really good as well.

1161
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:23,110
That movie, that TV series, where he was, like, he plays an
assassin.

1162
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,430
He's such a good actor.

1163
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:28,330
Barry, yes!

1164
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:29,090
Barry!

1165
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:30,350
I love that show.

1166
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,550
That show was really good.

1167
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:44,530
Look, I just really love comedians because I think comedians
are, like, are like super talented in general um a lot of

1168
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:46,110

Did I eat this guy already?

1174
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,980
I feel like I have.

1175
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,220
I don't see him.

1176
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,980
I don't hear the flip-flop of his feet.

1177
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,540
I've been here?

1178
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,400
Yeah, I have.

1179
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,220
I've been here already.

1180
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:27,520
Yeah.

1181
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,820
Like, this place has been discovered already.

1182
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:34,300
I don't hear the flip-flop of the feet, too, so I think I
ate him.

1183
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,020
I ate his family already.

1184
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:36,460
Oh, no.

1185
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,340

Oh, no.

1187
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:39,600
There's no GPS.

1188
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:41,300
Sun GPS.

1189
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,720

1190
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,620

1202
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,440
It has to be this way.

1203
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:09,520
Where else could it be?

1204
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,560

1315
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,680
Or do I actually have to steer it?

1316
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:52,880
Oh god.

1317
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,280
I hate this already.

1318
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:58,720
Oh yeah, they do.

1319
01:36:58,920 --> 01:36:59,720
Some birds do.

1320
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:01,740
Because it's like some fucking...

1321
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:02,720
Like those like...

1322
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,300
Like girlfriend dances.

1323
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,960
Where they like puff themselves up for a female.

1324
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,160
And stuff.

1325
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:11,140
Shoot the pouch.

1326
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:12,940
I shoot the pouch.

1327
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,700
Doing finding a girlfriend.

1328
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:16,500
That's fucking right.

1329
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:17,600
No girlfriend for you.

1330
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,360
That's fucking right.

1331
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,600
Who ain't finding no girl?

1332
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,240
Have I had anything to do with it?

1333
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:32,180
No girl.

1334
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,040
No girlfriend.

1335
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:35,240
Oh my god.

1336
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,940
I feel like you need the shot.

1337
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,720
Jesus Christ.

1338
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:41,340
No!

1339
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:45,400
Yo, she got so fucked up!

1340
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:50,530
That's right.

1341
01:37:51,150 --> 01:37:51,930
Deflate the sacks.

1342
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:54,050
Deflate the sacks.

1343
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:56,790
Doki, the veterinarian, is back.

1344
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:59,310

01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:01,530
There you go.

1346
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:05,490
There you go.

1347
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:07,110
You don't deserve to be in the sky.

1348
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:11,330
Only one person deserves to be in the sky, and that's me.

1349
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:14,070
All right, I deflated it.

01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:59,490
It's hidden back here.

All right, it's back to my regular job of being

Oh, he's not, he didn't do the flip, guys.

1367
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:35,310
He didn't do the flip.

1368
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:37,150
That's me back here, right?

1369
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:38,770
Oh, yes, I knew it.

1370
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:39,650
I knew it.

1371
01:40:41,190 --> 01:40:42,570
Oh my God, thank God.

1372
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:44,550
Where is your license?

1373
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:45,990
Oh, what?

1374
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:48,010
Oh, he like closed it.

1375
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,810
Wait, do I have to deflate his sacks again?

1376
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:52,310
Open up.

1377
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,050
Oh wait, did I hit everything?

1378
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:57,310
What is it?

1379
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:57,910
Guys,

1380
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:08,120
do you think he liked it?

1381
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:20,120
Look, after every acupuncture session, he has to take a mud
bath, so, like, the mud will fill up the holes and patch it

1382
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:20,860
up, you know?

1383
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:29,580
So, you know how, like, I poked holes into his body, so now
he has to go take a mud bath to cleanse his skin of all the

1384
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:35,860
excess toxins, and then the mud will fill up the holes,
and...

1385
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:37,400
Where did he go?

1386
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,120
And the mud will fill up his holes.

1387
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:44,020
And so, like, it would, like, block out all the bacteria
outside.

1388
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:45,200
Don't worry.

1389
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:46,200
I'm a specialist.

1390
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:46,700
Oh, my God.

1391
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,080

Oh no, is he going back to take his mud bath?

1413
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:10,100
No, does that mean his sacks are gonna be inflated again?

1414
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,660
Is it filled with sand?

1415
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:13,960

01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:28,000

01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:54,460
this way so i couldn't have that fucking zatsu because i was
so bad at multitasking

1650
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:05,820
um but yeah i've been friends with him like uh for a very
long time like when i was just a really small streamer uh

1651
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:14,200
because like uh where the fuck do i go is it across the map
again it has to be it's across the map i've been friends

1652
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:24,140
with him like but for a long long uh for for a while now uh
before uh before before you know started like actually

1653
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:30,840
vtubing um and like i think like we met when because when we
were like art streamers when we when we did like art and

1654
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:38,960
stuff and like i noticed that like uh they know uh cantonese
and stuff so i was like oh my god you know cantonese i know

1655
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:45,800
cantonese and then we like bonded over that and we like
raided each other and we're like super small art streamers

1656
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:49,380
And then, you know, like, we've been, we became friends
because of that.

1657
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:51,700
Like, we're like, you speak the same language!

1658
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:53,760
I speak the same language!

1659
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:00,420
And then that's how we, like, met.

1660
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:07,660
Yeah, like, when we were all, like, small art streamers and
stuff, we, like, rated each other.

1661
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:10,880
I think it was, like, before, VTubers were a thing, too.

1662
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:16,120
Before, like, not VTubers, before, like, like, uh, before,
like, HALOEN ever, like, debuted and stuff.

1663
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:27,680
like vtbris were still like a new concept in the western
side have i been to that shrine before can't tell yes i

1664
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:28,520
can't tell

1665
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:40,560
oh my god i can't tell if i've been to that one oh my god we
both it's like same hat same hat

1666
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:49,320
Arlo, sometimes I wish you can just jump across this cliff.

1667
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,240
Like, can't you do a cool trick like this?

1668
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:54,060
Arlo, come on, Arlo.

1669
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:56,440
Why can't you do cool tricks like that?

1670
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,100
Okay, it's this way.

1671
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,500
It's this way.

1672
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:00,780
Yay!

1673
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:04,740
Alright.

1674
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:06,560
Have I been to that shrine?

1675
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,860
I must have.

1676
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:09,900
That's like a shrine in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1677
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:11,940
Wait, have I?

1678
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:13,620
No, I haven't.

1679
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:14,720
It hasn't been activated.

1680
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:15,240
Oh, wait.

1681
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:16,120
Wait, I haven't.

1682
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:17,960
I haven't activated this fucking shrine.

1683
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,380
It's, like, in the middle of nowhere.

1684
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:21,500

No, absolutely.

1693
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:30,620
This is, like, the closest.

1694
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:33,500
Everyone always makes fun of me because I can't roll my
eyes.

1695

1702
02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:12,320
what the fuck all right where the fuck did he go but this is
a little oh there he is okay let me grab my bow gamer still

1703
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:23,860
alive so there you are not alive anymore okay this is like i
i want to test my theory out about like if we can do an

1704
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:32,100
infinite food glitch with salamanders it's like okay like
i'm just saying if they can like you know it's like you can

1705
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:41,100
eat worms and stuff right like it's like what was it you
know that like children's book about eating worms god what

1706
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:44,840
was it they always make you read that fucking book that old
book about

1707
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:59,120
uh what is the cod what is that cod that worm how to eat
fried worms yes yes it's just like that i'm just saying we

1708
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:08,200
can fix like it might not be like if we can we can like put
like um because we can have technically we can have infinite

1709
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:15,820
food food glitch with worms if you think about it and like
it's all about how you how you season the worms you know

1710
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:18,900
Okay, it's this way.

1711
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:20,340
I'm going to do the jump.

1712
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:21,480
Goodbye, Arlo.

1713
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:23,420
Wee!

1714
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:24,820
There's no way I die.

1715
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:25,840
See, I'm fine.

1716
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,060
I have so many... I eat so much fruit that I'm fine.

1717
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:30,400
All right, at...

1718
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:31,060
Speed ride.

1719
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,440
I'm just saying...

1720
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:38,860
Okay, well, no, you just raised the children off of a
worm-only diet.

1721
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:41,940
So they never know what actually tastes good.

1722
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:42,900
Like...

1723
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:46,120
It's just all about, like, the same thing.

1724
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:53,760
seasoning if you have put it good enough seasoning it'll
eventually taste good and then all you have to do is just

1725
02:04:53,760 --> 02:05:07,060
like it's so fucked up it's still food the child has no
concept of what what is good food like you raise him like a

1726
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:13,320
bird you mean it's still food i don't that's so cruel

1727
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:18,940
divide.

1728
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:19,800
Okay, look.

1729
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:22,160
Salamander tails and worms.

1730
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:23,280
Is that better?

1731
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,080
Salamander tails and worms.

1732
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:28,540
They're a healthy diet.

1733
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:29,900
That's enough meat, right?

1734
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:32,720
I read thank you for the super chat.

1735
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:34,000
Thank you.

1736
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:35,720
That's enough meat, right?

1737
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:37,980
Where the fuck is...

1738
02:05:37,980 --> 02:05:38,960
Where do I go?

1739
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:41,040
No, that's not it.

1740
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:42,460
I'm sad.

1741
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,300
Most normal dirty tangent.

1742
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:46,960
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

1743
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Thank you, thank you.

1744
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:55,900
This is not it just I'm just trying to figure out how to
like do the infinite food glitch Are you not curious out of

1745
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:56,640
science?

1746
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:08,120
For science you're not care about science tific reasoning
Why don't we just farm real animals because you can't do an

1747
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:14,920
if because when you farm real animal okay Are you trying to
say worms are not real worms deserve like rights to

1748
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:28,640
like okay the thing about farming real animals is that you
have to where the fuck do i get across the thing about

1749
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:37,460
farming real animals is that eventually like it takes too
long to farm them that's the whole issue real animals just

1750
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:46,480
take too long to farm but like but like if you like cut a
worm and like or like you know grab a salamander's tail they

1751
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:55,100
eventually regrow it in like multiple times so like all i'm
saying is like starfish we can eat starfish too because they

1752
02:06:55,100 --> 02:07:01,260
can regrow their limbs think about it we just eat the
animals that can regrow themselves

1753
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:14,440
guys think about it and then we don't have to worry about
like we don't have to build more farms to like we don't have

1754
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:22,200
guys think about we don't have to build more farms to like
uh to fix like the like you know we don't have to demolish

1755
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:29,420
more forest forest and like to build more farms to build
more like uh okay so what about the vegans and the

1756
02:07:29,420 --> 02:07:31,060
vegetarians well

1757
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:47,660
what about i guess we'll grow fruit i don't know i'm
thinking about like the meat lover problems right now.

1758
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:51,880
We'll tackle vegans and vegetarians another time.

1759
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:57,720
This is about like, we'll tackle, we're tackling problems
one at a time, guys.

1760
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:00,140
There's too many problems in the world.

1761
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:00,860
Okay.

1762
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:09,880
That's what grass, that's why we're talking about the
stomach scenario.

1763
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:13,680
Okay, where do I go?

1764
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:14,500
Do I go straight?

1765
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:16,700
Is there, is, am I going the right way?

1766
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:19,600
Am I going the right way?

1767
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:20,140
Is it up?

1768
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:21,640
It has to be up, right?

1769
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:24,440
I feel like I'm not going the right way.

1770
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:27,580
Wait.

1771
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,220
Is this the right way?

1772
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:33,280
Up, I believe.

1773
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:34,900
I don't know.

1774
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,600
I don't even know, guys.

1775
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:40,980
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

1776
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:42,980
To the left?

1777
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:43,960
Have I been here?

1778
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:45,160
Yeah, I have.

1779
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:46,140
Is it the left side?

1780
02:08:48,740 --> 02:09:02,480
this floor I need to figure out where to go it's like here I
guess like this way it's close to the which fish I've like

1781
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:13,220
fucking killed so many like aquatic creatures this is this
way am I going the right way guys I can't tell it has to be

1782
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:19,440
the right way eight hours later This has to be the right
way, right?

1783
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:20,700
Yeah.

1784
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1785
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:25,080
I think I'm so smart.

1786
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:25,780
I think I'm right.

1787
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:26,860
All right.

1788
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:29,620
I think I saw world hunger.

1789
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:36,480
Guys, I think I saw world hunger.

1790
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:40,460
If people aren't like pussies about eating worms and
salamanders, we'll be fine.

1791
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:46,040
Like, eat worms or 600k Scoville chicken with no milk.

1792
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:52,060
the 600k Scoville chicken um because that shit is like not
that spicy to me

1793
02:09:56,680 --> 02:10:05,680
all i'm saying is that people are cowards people are fucking
cowards there's just not it's who cares about what a food

1794
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:17,040
tastes like it's all about getting your proteins right as
long as we get our proteins in we're fine why is why do you

1795
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:27,140
care about what a food tastes like but toky why don't you
try it out then lead by example look okay I can't like lead

1796
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:38,600
by example if no one else wants to like lead with me okay
this is a group effort I can't do this on my own guys I

1797
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:50,500
can't do this on my own it's all about working together you
Look, we're here to work together.

1798
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:53,600
It's not a race here.

1799
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:55,340
It's about teamwork.

1800
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:58,700
It's our ideas.

1801
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,960
We cook this idea together.

1802
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:05,100
It's not your idea.

1803
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:07,540
It's our ideas together.

1804
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:09,680
Because we're a team, dragons.

1805
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:11,340
You and I were a team.

1806
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:13,280
What happened to being a team?

1807
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:23,900
guys we came up with this idea together you do not want to

amnesia you know you hit your head You remember everything

1872
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:56,740
when you get concussion just guys don't follow medical.

1873
02:17:56,880 --> 02:18:08,140
I'm not a doctor I might be like licensed in many things but
doctor isn't it Just so you know Just so you guys know We

1874
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:17,840
might have a lot of licenses in multiple things But anyway
as I was saying We're gonna fix your concussion sir This is

1875
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:24,320
like non-licensed medical advice But like you know I think
if opinion.

1876
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:28,400
You know how those Twitter accounts were like, these are all
just my opinion.

1877
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:40,000
I'm not associated with any company or like my... This is
only my opinion, but like, I think if you like hit your head

1878
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,240
again, we can un-concuss your concussion.

1879
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:46,640
All right, this way.

1880
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:47,800
I have to go this way, right?

1881
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:49,340
I don't know where do we go.

1882
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:53,400
My opinion is a magic word.

1883
02:18:55,120 --> 02:19:03,960
I fucking know God I'm literally doing it right now God
where else am I oh it's this way okay God I'm literally

1885
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:20,240

1886
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,040
Where do I jump?

1887
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:30,360
God is backseating me.

1888
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:33,720
God is like, where do I go?

1889
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:39,040
Okay.

1890
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:45,360
In my opinion, sir, if you keep hitting yourself against the
wall, we'll fix the head concussion.

1891
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:47,720
But this is just my opinion.

1892
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:53,740
You know, if I was wrong, it was you're the one that
followed the opinion instead of getting actual visual

1893
02:19:53,740 --> 02:19:53,820
message.

1894
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:54,640
medical advice.

1895
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:57,500
That's your fault.

1896
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:00,320
Okay, watch where the tower falls.

1897
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:00,680
Okay.

1898

02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:04,220
Okay, this way?

1900
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:06,160
Where is that man falling?

1901
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:09,100
Where am I?

1902
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:16,540

Get up.

1906
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:24,220

1908
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:26,740

2173
02:39:31,460 --> 02:39:32,800
I don't think he liked that.

2174
02:39:33,720 --> 02:39:35,300
God, what do I do, God?

I'm running.

2187
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:00,540
There has to be a thing to clap.

2188
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:02,140
This has to be climbable.

2189
02:40:02,300 --> 02:40:02,440
Nope.

2190
02:40:03,020 --> 02:40:03,200

02:40:03,460 --> 02:40:04,320

Yes.

2193
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:10,260
There has to be something out there that's climbable.

2194
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:13,140
Climb him.

2195
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:14,240

This is climbable.

2199
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:19,100
This has to be climbable.

2200
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:22,860
Please, where are the climbing parts?

2201
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:27,180

Oh, no.

2203
02:40:29,380 --> 02:40:29,900
Oh, no.

02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:49,900
Panels.

02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:52,840
God, please, I'm struggling again!

2206
02:40:53,420 --> 02:40:55,020
God, show me the way.

02:40:58,480 --> 02:40:58,740
Okay.

Oh, bro, he's ghosting me.

2268
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:58,120
It's as if I'm not scary enough for him.

02:44:58,220 --> 02:44:58,980
That's fucked up.

2270
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:04,060
I built up a clientele that deserves to be noticed, sir.

2271

02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:14,000
What's he doing?

2274
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:18,400

There's no way.

02:46:06,170 --> 02:46:07,690

2291
02:46:21,990 --> 02:46:23,690

02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:40,160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2299
02:46:40,220 --> 02:46:41,000
That's an accident!

2300
02:46:43,870 --> 02:46:44,110
No!

2301
02:46:44,270 --> 02:46:45,390
That's an accident, please!

2302
02:46:46,970 --> 02:46:48,430
No, but steady.

2303
02:46:48,990 --> 02:46:49,750
That's an accident!

2304
02:46:50,570 --> 02:46:52,010
Turn your fucking head!

2305
02:46:52,170 --> 02:46:55,050
Please, for the love of God, just let me shoot you in the
arm.

02:46:55,730 --> 02:46:57,390
Let me shoot you on the fucking...

02:47:05,990 --> 02:47:07,110
Bro, please.

02:47:07,350 --> 02:47:08,450
For the love of God.

2311
02:47:09,270 --> 02:47:10,150
Just turn around.

2312
02:47:10,330 --> 02:47:11,530
I need your other arm.

2313
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:13,270
Your other arm has the weak point.

2314
02:47:13,630 --> 02:47:14,930
There's no weak point here.

2315
02:47:19,230 --> 02:47:20,830
There's literally no weak point.

2316
02:47:21,210 --> 02:47:22,010
Stop moving.

2317
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:22,890
Okay.

This was worse than the bird who was trying to find the
girlfriend.

2613
03:07:27,390 --> 03:07:29,350
We literally needed to just hold his hand.

2614
03:07:29,670 --> 03:07:31,070
And this fucker was too shy.

2615
03:07:31,630 --> 03:07:32,470
He was too scared.

2616
03:07:38,980 --> 03:07:40,160
Another happy customer.

2617
03:07:41,260 --> 03:07:42,160
Never return.

2618
03:07:43,260 --> 03:07:45,260

2756
03:16:20,690 --> 03:16:21,610
I hit the jump.

2757
03:16:22,570 --> 03:16:24,550

2903
03:25:41,920 --> 03:25:43,520
This feels like a colossi.

2904
03:25:43,660 --> 03:25:45,280
Because it's built so weird, too.

03:33:39,830 --> 03:33:40,250

04:01:27,710 --> 04:01:29,790
Just grab something.

3374
04:01:30,190 --> 04:01:31,870
My license for your books.

3375
04:01:33,790 --> 04:01:34,930
I can't believe it!

3376
04:01:35,170 --> 04:01:37,730
How did they know this wasn't a real license?

3377
04:01:55,540 --> 04:01:57,160
How did they know?

3378
04:01:58,020 --> 04:01:58,760
How did...

3379
04:01:58,760 --> 04:02:01,460
I can't believe the inspector came!

3380
04:02:04,620 --> 04:02:06,620
I did my job perfectly!

3381
04:02:07,020 --> 04:02:08,800
I watched the YouTube guys!

3382
04:02:13,340 --> 04:02:14,840
I can't believe it.

3383
04:02:14,860 --> 04:02:15,860
The inspector came.

3384
04:02:15,920 --> 04:02:16,860
Who called on me?

3385
04:02:17,240 --> 04:02:19,960
Who, like, ratted me out to the inspectors?

3386
04:02:20,180 --> 04:02:22,080
To the acupuncture inspectors.

3387
04:02:28,530 --> 04:02:30,430
They just left her?

3388
04:02:31,550 --> 04:02:32,190
all that?

3389
04:02:32,410 --> 04:02:33,850
I guess because they thought she was dead.

3390
04:02:40,250 --> 04:02:41,370
She's alive!

3391
04:02:42,510 --> 04:02:43,270
Look at her.

3392
04:02:43,590 --> 04:02:45,470
Now she's less dead looking.

3393
04:02:53,050 --> 04:02:54,730
I'm gonna be like, how the fuck did I get here?

3394
04:02:56,810 --> 04:02:58,210
She's like, what the fuck?

3395
04:02:58,370 --> 04:02:59,290
Where am I?

3396
04:03:23,460 --> 04:03:25,540
The power of acupuncture.

3397
04:03:26,180 --> 04:03:26,800
It works.

3398
04:03:27,940 --> 04:03:29,760
Even my license wasn't real.

3399
04:03:30,080 --> 04:03:31,020
My skills were.

3400
04:03:38,820 --> 04:03:44,180
She doesn't even know where the fuck to go?

3401
04:03:52,130 --> 04:03:53,750
Oh my god, I can control the camera.

3402

3435
04:06:50,870 --> 04:06:53,190
So I don't know which one to start first.

3436
04:06:54,670 --> 04:06:56,070
I might do...

3437
04:06:56,070 --> 04:06:57,070
I don't know, actually.

3438
04:06:57,170 --> 04:06:59,090
I don't know which game to do next.

3439
04:06:59,330 --> 04:07:01,490
Because there's, like, so many I want to play.

3440
04:07:01,990 --> 04:07:03,930
There's so many games I've always wanted to play.

3441
04:07:04,250 --> 04:07:07,130
So it's always hard to figure out the next series.

3442
04:07:08,210 --> 04:07:09,690
But I have, like, a backlog of...

3443
04:07:09,690 --> 04:07:12,110

You could be on top of that this whole time.

3464
04:07:42,430 --> 04:07:44,050
I've always been under there.

3465
04:07:56,050 --> 04:07:59,970
I saved my girlfriend.

3466
04:08:01,490 --> 04:08:05,390

3467
04:08:22,410 --> 04:08:27,050
I mean this whole game was about climbing Just climb Was

3468
04:08:27,390 --> 04:08:28,770

3469
04:08:29,670 --> 04:08:31,270

3479
04:10:05,530 --> 04:10:07,470
I saved up some time.

3480
04:10:12,850 --> 04:10:14,590
I saw my chat.

3481
04:10:14,850 --> 04:10:18,950
They were like, wow, this entire game was grabbing and she
doesn't even grab at the end.

3482
04:10:19,270 --> 04:10:21,230
Because I knew it was useless.

3483
04:10:22,390 --> 04:10:24,610
There was no fucking point.

3484
04:10:33,670 --> 04:10:35,790
But what about the drama?

3485
04:10:35,930 --> 04:10:37,530
I should have been like, Wee!

3486
04:10:37,670 --> 04:10:39,170
Jumped into the pool.

3487
04:10:55,830 --> 04:10:57,150
Wait, but the bridge is gone.

3488
04:10:57,330 --> 04:10:59,590
How the fuck is she gonna get home?

3489
04:10:59,850 --> 04:11:01,110
This is so sad.

3490
04:11:01,710 --> 04:11:03,750
Like, seeing Arlo limping.

3491
04:11:04,110 --> 04:11:05,010
Oh my god.

3492
04:11:06,190 --> 04:11:08,850
Bro, how the fuck do we fix his leg?

3493
04:11:19,710 --> 04:11:21,150
This is home now.

3494
04:11:24,010 --> 04:11:26,550
Yeah, I'm like, how is she gonna... The bridge is gone.

3495
04:11:28,290 --> 04:11:30,070
Where are we gonna get diapers.

3496
04:11:45,110 --> 04:11:45,730
Kill it.

3497
04:11:54,040 --> 04:11:55,120
The deer.

3498
04:11:57,780 --> 04:11:58,850
Why is this no white shit?

3499
04:12:03,610 --> 04:12:04,870
She's so close.

3500
04:12:05,990 --> 04:12:07,250
Kill it for food.

3501
04:12:18,180 --> 04:12:19,340
Oh my god, this is great.

3502
04:12:19,680 --> 04:12:24,680
Because like the the herbivores have never seen an actual
carnivore before.

3503
04:12:25,220 --> 04:12:26,720
So it's like the dodo bird.

3504
04:12:28,200 --> 04:12:36,920
It's like a dodo bird where like dodo birds never
encountered any like actual um actual like uh threat so like

3505
04:12:36,920 --> 04:12:43,560
it was so easy to kill all the dodo birds because uh the
dodo birds just didn't know what is considered a carnivore

3506
04:12:43,560 --> 04:12:50,600
and what is considered like a predator so so the dears they
don't know they don't know so we'll just wait for it to walk

3507
04:12:50,600 --> 04:12:58,400
up to us and then like snap its neck and then that's food
because it's never seen the predator before eagles don't eat

3508
04:12:58,400 --> 04:13:05,800
deers okay maybe like baby deers I've seen an eagle pick up
a fucking baby deer before like not in real life but a

3509
04:13:05,800 --> 04:13:21,260
YouTube video not root it's not ruining them what moment it
was a fucking deer you never seen a video of like a fucking

3510
04:13:21,260 --> 04:13:28,540
eagle pick I think it was like an eagle picking up a fucking
baby deer it's just like because like there's there's like a

3511
04:13:28,540 --> 04:13:35,320
thing so a lot of parents are like super paranoid because
like there's been cases where like eagles will try to pick

3512
04:13:35,320 --> 04:13:43,300
up children like we'll try to abduct kids because it sees it
as like a fucking baby animal yay

3513
04:13:50,910 --> 04:14:07,660
yeah eagles can pick up goats now there's a fear in there
yeah we did it now you have an additional fear if you become

3514
04:14:07,660 --> 04:14:14,080
future parents and then like now you're like what if an
eagle picks up my child my child will never go outside

3515
04:14:14,080 --> 04:14:18,500

3540
04:15:56,100 --> 04:15:56,700
It's so tiny.

3541
04:15:57,920 --> 04:15:58,400
Look.

3542
04:16:00,060 --> 04:16:01,220
It's so cute.

3543
04:16:02,580 --> 04:16:03,680
Look at the little.

3544
04:16:05,000 --> 04:16:05,460
Look.

3545
04:16:05,580 --> 04:16:10,240
They gave me alternatives with, like, the little
handkerchief or, like, the non-handkerchief.

3546
04:16:10,400 --> 04:16:17,100
I went with the non-handkerchief because, like, I felt like,
you know, I wasn't allowed to look dissimilar.

3547
04:16:17,620 --> 04:16:18,340
But, oh, my God.

3548
04:16:18,380 --> 04:16:19,320
And then there's me.

3549
04:16:19,660 --> 04:16:20,880
There's me over here.

3550
04:16:21,280 --> 04:16:33,540
I sort of, like, baited my friend because, like, even
though, like, I commissioned them to draw me, we're going to

3551
04:16:33,540 --> 04:16:34,680
get a new skin suit.

3552
04:16:35,580 --> 04:16:41,780
gonna change in the future like we're not even gonna hit
that subbatch it's just there for decoration i just wanted

3553
04:16:41,780 --> 04:16:47,840
to fill it all the slots up but like we're never even gonna
get this subbatch like the last one

3554
04:16:51,080 --> 04:16:59,980
yeah the last subbatch is gonna change and i was just like
this is just fuck it i just wanted it just wanted it's just

3555
04:16:59,980 --> 04:17:07,200
