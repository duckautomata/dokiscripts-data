00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:28,010
a little playlist for you guys it's like back in the day
when people make mixtapes and be like please listen to my

18
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:39,870
mixtape i made a little video i made a little like uh video
playlist and i'm like please watch my playlist please i made

19
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,250
this special dragoon playlist well to be fair this was my
playlist i'll be like that's funny and i save it but then

20
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,550
i'm like this is my dokey playlist for the dragoons so
please watch my playlist

21
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:07,270
the very important videos uh but welcome welcome welcome to
my react channel that's on twitch because i don't want to

22
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:14,390
get in trouble with youtube i'm now trying to read some
people were asking me were like oh are you gonna like

23
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:26,770
re-upload this and i'm just like i mean i can try i i don't
i I'll see what's gonna happen when I re-upload it on like

24
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:38,590
on if I like upload the VOD on like on my VOD's channel and
just see what happens to it so like you know I can try and

25
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:47,150
see that's the worst I mean it's just I have three strikes
right so like if I get striked I at least I'll have two more

26
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:57,590
strikes you know like the first track strike is just to what
happens you know at least not the main channel and

27
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:06,630
technically if you think about it that means i have two
channels so like that means i can have six strikes so like

28
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:14,530
the more channels i get the more chances i can have so like
maybe i should just create another channel in case the vaude

29
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,990
channels get a strike and i'll have another channel and
that's like a whole new three more strikes that i have like

30
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:31,750
the three more chances uh the five minute move the strike
leveling algorithm but welcome welcome to my twitch

31
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:40,130
everybody um it's not gonna be like a i think like not gonna
i'm not gonna be doing this a lot obviously uh it's just

32
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:47,170

gonna show you my i can finally like show you some videos

33
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:55,690

34
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:04,370
i can i react to your videos can i show your videos and
they'll they'll either not respond or just i don't know i

35
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,090

00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:17,930

was partnered on this on my twitch guys it's been a while

37
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:30,230
it's been oh i usually use my i realize when up on my twitch
channel i was like wow i was i did not set up anything on my

38
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:37,210
i did not really set up anything for like solo streams on
twitch because every time i streamed on twitch it's either

39
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:43,770
for like twitch rivals or okay it's usually for twitch
rivals so then when i was like setting everything up i was

40
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:51,690
like oh my god there's no like i don't know how to i don't
have any like By the way, I was like, wait, sorry if there's

41
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,150
no alerts because I'm scared of putting my alerts up right
now.

42
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,930
Because I don't think...

43
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,310
Wait, I think I did mute it.

44
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,170
Let me see if I can...

45
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,470
I'll put the Twitch alerts because I was like, oh, man, I
don't know if I have.

46
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,150
Let me see.

47
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,330
Okay, there we go.

48
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,190
Okay, here we go.

49
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,670
That's good.

50
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,190
Okay, that's a good sign.

51
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,290
All right, Twitch alerts are...

52
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,790
I think Twitch alerts are muted, I think.

53
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:29,950
so that's why i was a little scared because i didn't even
like adjust my twitch alerts because i was like oh no is our

54
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:39,150
alerts muted i don't know i haven't really figured it out
yet johnny lacone thank you for 20 gifted subs thank you

55
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:47,830
thank you oh my god bacon thank you for the 50 gifted subs
thank you thank you i really appreciate it guys thank you so

56
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:56,250
much I bet I'm like a twitch's favorite streamer because I
don't use up their bandwidth, but I still have subs.

57
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,370
So I'm like

58
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,130
They're like give to keep a partner.

59
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:19,210
She doesn't use up our Our bandwidth, but she still has
people giving her money on Twitch Super cost-effective yeah

60
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:27,170
we're gonna have to resize this alert holy shit all right
i'll play around with it one day and i realized i was like

63
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:56,430

I'll show you guys the first video, guys.

115
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,770
All right, so I saw this and I thought it was really funny.

116
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,090
It's there's a new crab game that's like dark souls related.

117
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,730
Let me know if it's too loud or not.

118
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,090
Bright, colorful souls like game and thought, this is too
happy.

119
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,050
We need more dark and mysterious souls like games.

120
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,530
There just isn't enough out there.

121
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,590
Fair not, fellow gamer.

122
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,870
We have added a new feature to another crab's treasure, dark
souls like mode.

123
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,730
Yeah, because it's too happy.

124
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,610
I should sort of want and replace it with I was sort of like
I've been wanting to play this game for a bit Because like

125
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:58,150
it's basically like a happier version of Dark Souls So and
you play like a cry you play a crab so

126
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:09,270
So so it's just it's just a happier version of Dark Souls
I've been wanting to try out for a bit because like it looks

127
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:18,290
you know, not depressing anyway dark color scheme does krill
appear too happy let's remove that sparkle in his eyes and

128
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,730
determination for adventure in dark souls like mode krill
will become depressed oh look at him not a hope inside are

129
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:33,270
you feeling it now instagram dark souls like mode unlocks a
new costume you might recognize it for redacted redacted

130
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:39,410
copyright strike redacted this costume will hide krill's
defeated face so we're gonna mod that dark souls like mode

131
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,670
also turns all levels into a poison swamp because it's not a
real souls like game without one look at that poisony

132
00:13:45,670 --> 00:14:04,090
goodness we also added arnold londo okay i got okay i got
this ad on my shorts i was like is that markiplier but okay

133
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:14,870
but then like the okay okay i just you guys to know i got
this ad while scrolling through YouTube shorts and

134
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:34,510
and like the plot twist is that not only is that character
based off of Markiplier but it's for Markiplier and like

135
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:41,390
basically I wouldn't get any closer if I were you I'm not
saying by the way if anybody wants to download this game

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:54,650

00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,490
It's not just me!

152
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,170
It was not AI!

153
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,150
It's Vocaloid!

154
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,810
It's different!

155
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,490

166
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,910
Vocaloid walked.

167
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,430

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,970

You guys can't see him.

183
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,390
He's over there on the right.

184
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,590
I'm covering him up.

185
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,870

186
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,270

Jotting in a feeling, choking the mind.

243
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,600
Counting all the raiders out the skies.

Anyway, back to the playlist that I fucking made for you

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,440

00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,920
Anyway, here are, like, actual normal videos that I watched,
by the way.

291
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,320
Here are some actual normal videos.

292
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,780
Okay, I'm going to recommend you guys a channel that I've
actually, like, really liked to watch.

293
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:18,440
ever so often and it's like a cooking channel but um but
like he does like cookbook reviews but he does like gamer

294
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,740
cookbook reviews and it's like really interesting because
like all I always think like who buy these types of

295
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:32,600
cookbooks you know like those types of cookbooks where it's
like gamer gaming or anime or like TV show inspired and like

always wonder who buys these like who the fuck you know like

creed meal inspired like like dinner or so yes it's me so

298
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,660
hungry I just finished binging the fallout TV show okay this
is like actually I thought it really captured the unique

299
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:07,660
post-apocalyptic flavor of the games and it got me really
nostalgic I really he does like updates honestly i'm

300
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:16,960
surprised he only has 150k subscribers because like i
actually really enjoy uh watching his his videos and stuff

morty let's watch the rick and morty one uh hey put me over

303
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,220
Boom, big reveal.

304
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,900
I turned myself into a pickle.

305
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,680
I'm pickle miso.

306
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,720
Why did I turn myself into a pickle?

307
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,000
You gotta have a high enough IQ to understand this.

308
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,720
Well, I hear Rick and Morty might be needing a new voice
actor.

309
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,140
So think of this as my audition.

310
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,120
Come on, Cartoon Network.

311
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,740
If you had any...

312
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,420
All right, we're gonna skip this.

313
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:53,940
This is a little cringe.

314
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,840
We're taking a look at Rick and Morty, a picture cookbook by
August Craig and James Assel.

315
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,140
This book takes us along Rick and Morty's adventure through
space and time with a focus on the funky alien foods they

316
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,480
come across along the way.

317
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,340
I really dig the way they presented this cookbook, basically
for Morty's home economics school project, he decided to put

318
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,040
together a cookbook of his family's favorite recipes.

319
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:20,040
Rick doesn't want Morty wasting his time on this silly
school project since they got to go on adventures, so what

320
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,640
does he do?

321
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,180
Rick fills up the rest of the book itself.

322
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,020
It's so interesting because like some of the cookbooks,
they're like really well designed with like pictures of the

323
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,460
food.

324
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:36,420
Just like the show, it's crazy and wacky and it feels like
there's something fun to expect after every page turn.

325
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
I really love the layout of the book.

326
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,820
I think it's the perfect balance of text and imagery, lots
of fun flavor text to read, and very close in tone to the

327
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
dark humor of the show.

328
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,960
There are no F-bombs or anything, but there are some mature
leading jokes in there that's very on brand.

329
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,580
I also really like how the recipe pages are littered with
illustrations and even screenshots from the show.

330
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:02,560
And the screenshots are usually lifted from the same episode
that the recipe is inspired by, which is a neat addition.

331
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,660
The food photos are awesome as I've always wanted to have a
little bits.

332
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,660
Some photos have lab equipment in the background to make
them look like a part of Rick's lab.

333
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,080
And some photos have the characters interacting with the
food.

334
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,640
The abundant illustrations and attention to detail really
makes this one of the most thematic and most fun cookbooks

335
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,500
to look at.

336
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,380
Not all recipes have photos, but in this case, I don't even
mind because there's so much other good content to

337
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,160
supplement it.

338
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,980
The recipes themselves are based off of food for the show or
are inspired by references in the show.

339
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,960
with names thrown just because like they really tried to
draw it's actually interesting he also shows majority of the

340
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,200
book so like you know i don't have to like actually you know
you know it's like some people just like oh he's just like

341
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,700
one or two pages but he shows majority of books so i don't
actually have to buy the book i can just like pause the

342
00:31:51,700 --> 00:32:00,760
video from the rick and morty now we can't do rick and morty
food without paying tribute to the iconic i just pause the

343
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:10,480
video inspired a bunch of merch including this one so to
make pickle rick's transformation i always find it really

344
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,720
interesting we're gonna skip a lot but then he usually does
like he cooks all of it and he cooks like he um he makes

345
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:27,840
fans pick three rep recipes that he he's gonna cook in the
cookbook and then um and then like he does three and then he

346
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,000
gives obviously he gives his ratings also he's not like a
professional cook or anything he's just some like regular

347
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,460
guy that just wants a like that just you know he's just like
an amateur cook he's just like me he's just like you so it's

348
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:49,340
like anybody can cook type dia um it's really interesting
because like you know he was like obviously like if he can

349
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:58,680
make it like that means i can make it technically and uh and
then he gives like a review and be like which one which one

350
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,100
is good or not and the story point ones are just much less
of a hassle you know but if you're really looking to make

351
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:10,120
homemade ones then this is a pretty solid i like how it's
green screen so you don't see the pickle but these chili

352
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:19,120
dogs are the ones i've been eyeing up they just some guy
yeah he's just some guy taste test with flying colors this

353
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,900
is pretty dang delicious so yeah this is honestly like one
this is like one of my favorite channels to watch just like

354
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:31,020
oh my god i was watching the one piece one and then holy
shit why is that curry blue

355
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:44,020
fuck it's blue and then he made the bacon pancakes right
here i watch i watched that one and then there's the uh okay

356
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:52,020
there's one that i saw i was like really bring along all
your hopes and dreams look at this corn beef is such an

357
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:59,280
underrated it's the one piece turkey more in fried rice so
yeah if you like it's the one piece turkey it looks so okay

358
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,980
this looks actually look so fucking good though like look at
that to wrap my mouth around this thing it's the one piece

359
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,300
turkey i got the ground meat coating in a bit of the
hard-boiled that looks so good the meat was okay but the

360
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:16,960
meat stick a little dry for my second bite i tried to get
more of the drumstick meat which was way more moist and

361
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,760
tasted a lot don't worry he like has his recipe for it what
the fuck there's an egg inside i already forgot there was an

362
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:31,340
egg inside how do you make that don't worry just subscribe
to me so hungry the best part is that he tells the recipe in

363
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:38,220
the video so you actually don't have to buy the book like
you can just follow the recipe in this video which is the

364
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:52,000
but if you really want to support if you want to support the
cook the publisher you should buy the book but

365
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:04,400
but like you know if you really want to support the
publisher you could also buy the book but like the best part

366
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,480
is that you know he gives like a step-by-step guide in the
video itself so like i don't have to worry about like trying

367
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,500
to figure out the recipe loose more seasoning to the meat
maybe marinate the drumstick oh my god i'm so hungry now

368
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,060
looking at this see i think it's this one right no that's
the meat on the bone here when sanji joined the crew on the

369
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:30,480
bone this version of meat on the bone isn't as simple as you
think though because there's a whole egg inside this recipe

370
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,500
is gonna need four chicken drumsticks apparently we're
supposed to make tulips oh it was a turkey it's a chicken so

371
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,020
small that it's kind of hard to make sense out of it but i
think i figured it out so you take your scissors and start

372
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:48,820
at the handle end stick it under the skin and cut up to the
meat cutting as close to the bone as possible why did you

373
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:57,060
start with food videos the other sides of the no we started
off with like kind of inside out we definitely did not start

374
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:03,520
with food videos or a meat salad or a meat upside down
umbrella so that you'll have the meat exposed i'm sorry to

375
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,640
all the vegans and vegetarians that are watching this then
you're gonna take a quarter cup of breadcrumbs and soak it

376
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:16,420
in three tablespoons of milk that much work to be honest you
just cut a chicken in a bowl mixed together 18 ounces of 500

377
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:24,320
grams of ground chicken with one teaspoon of salt but not
the vocal like you're expecting together and then mix in the

378
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,380
milky bread crumbs and knead it again.

379
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,680
Now to assemble the drumsticks, you're going to need one
hard-boiled egg per chicken drumstick.

380
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,120
Take the layers of meat and grate it around a hard ball
there.

381
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,840
I see.

382
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,580
Then oil your hands and then take the meat mixture and cover
the drumstick and egg so it looks like a chicken woman a

383
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:44,960
chicken.

384
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,220
Just like in the anime.

385
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:53,660
When everything is assembled, bake the drumsticks in the
oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes.

386
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:02,660
raise the 10th to 450 and then broil it for another 5 to 10
minutes to give it that nice brown color which is what i did

387
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:15,020
when done you should have four nice if i wasn't so lazy i'd
do this god damn it if i wasn't a streamer i'd do this but

388
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:22,720
yeah this is like one of my favorite channels that like i
i'm really happy whenever whenever they like uh whenever

389
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,600
they have like new episodes I always, like, was like, ooh,
time to watch.

390
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,780
But I feel like he's so high effort.

391
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:39,520
Like, his, the stuff he does, and, like, his, like, video
production, it's so high effort for, like, 150k subscribers.

392
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,380
You guys should check him out.

393
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,520
He's actually, I feel like he's very underrated.

394
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,680
Also, here's one of my favorite videos.

395
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,840
I talked about it before, but I wanted to show you guys,
because I couldn't show it on YouTube.

396
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,180
them draw lola bunny with fewer sexual features so they
wouldn't be horny and reduce your blood flow to make you a

397
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:09,480
millisecond slower is it slow enough for me to kill iris
remember when you were making out with your first girlfriend

398
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:17,680
it was me barry right as she touched your leg it was me
barry i jerked you off at super speed so it'd seem like you

399
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,260
nutted at just a woman's touch sorry i had to

400
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,120
It was me, Barry.

401
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:38,980
It was honestly one of my favorite reverse flash, reverse
flash lines.

402
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,260
It's a classic.

403
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,380
It's such a classic.

404
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,720
Oh my god.

405
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:50,060
So my favorite like DC animator slash, okay, she does like
Team Fortress 2 animations too.

406
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,140
Spineapples.

407
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,980
I don't know if you guys know Spineapples, but like I
fucking love her animations and like her like team fortress

Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

439
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:07,480
Somebody said that they nerfed Tracer's ass, but like, it
never, it didn't really change that much, to be fair.

440
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,960

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,120
I killed it.

448
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,360
Who's that?

449
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,520
Trust to the nines.

450
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,860
They're so good at rapping!

451
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,380
It's not a face.

452
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,980
It's not even super!

453
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,780
This was literally sick!

454
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,940
Six years ago!

455
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,040
Wait, there's Mercy versus Medic?

456
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,720
I've never seen the Mercy versus Medic one.

457
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,480
What's the Mercy versus Medic?

458
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,380
They did so many.

459
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,460
God damn, the animation is so dated.

460
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,180
It's time for your prognosis, the doctor is in.

461
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,760
Heroes never die, but you're not one of them.

462
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:23,720
I arrive on swift wings like a bird in a hurry If you have
an emergency, get blood out to Mercy I may have a halo, but

463
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,900
I am no angel With my damage buffs, I can make your life
better Where's Medic?

464
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,160
I don't care about Mercy Whoa!

465
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,640
Okay, not gonna lie, the voice acting for this is pretty
good

466
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,300
Okay, this one's pretty bad, I'll admit This one was pretty
bad

467
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,120
I'll give you guys that That one was pretty bad

468
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:02,640
Okay, but did you guys know Like the TF2 Like cast Cast
actually did like a song cover together I saved it because I

469
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,000
was like Whoa, that's a Team Forge's 2 voice actors Okay,
where is it?

470
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:17,420
I saved a video too It's called The Sandwich Blues They
actually did like Yeah, they did This was like a month ago,

471
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:17,920
last month.

472
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,220
Walk up this morning.

473
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,080
The sandwich was gone.

474
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,760
Didn't leave no note.

475
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,640
Nothing to go on.

476
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,540
Looked under the covers.

477
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,360
Under the sheet.

478
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,500
Now Heavy's brokenhearted.

479
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,200
He's got nothing to eat.

480
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,320
We got the sandwich blues.

481
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,000
We're down again our soul.

482
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,840
Yeah, they're doing like song coverage now, which I thought
was funny.

483
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,540
We're down again our soul.

484
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:55,720
oh god they're so old yeah i think they're like in their 50s
or 60s now or they have to be in 60s where are we gonna have

485
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:07,020
a plan where we gonna look in so many places we could write
a book those actors are so talented i can only do like three

486
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:12,500
voices child no and this

487
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,860
We got a sandwich blues.

488
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,100
Things are taking control.

489
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,840
This can't be happening.

490
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,360
Heavy is out of control.

491
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,980
Please stop it, Heavy.

492
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,280
You met a mysterious woman.

493
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,780
Oh yeah, this boy, the...

494
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:37,800
How's it?

495
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,640
What's her name?

496
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,200
The announcer?

497
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,360
The announcer and Sniper, like, married Ira.

498
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,640
She's met us in a bar.

499
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,660
But we ain't got no sandwich.

500
00:46:45,780 --> 00:47:03,800
We only got a car We got a sandwich blues And then Our soul
We got a sandwich blues Don't need to take a pole If we

501
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:14,120
don't find it soon Having gone to eat a throne Yeah they're
doing like They're doing like music covers now together

502
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:23,700
Which I thought was really cute cogitated maybe it's a curse
edmund's intimidating she's nobody's nerd if we don't find

503
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:36,880
the sandwich hair is gonna be our hurts we got the sandwich
blues way down in our soul it's still the sandwich blues put

504
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:46,780
it on a scroll all right guys now we're gonna see something
really cursed i need to show you guys this video shabby

505
00:47:46,780 --> 00:48:01,340
traps I'm sure no one will be creeped out by this this
popped up I like look it's the this boss it's the Boston dog

506
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:13,340
look it is who don't know they're gonna create something
very special so I bought a robotic dog this video is brought

507
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,760
to you by Squarespace no not this video

508
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:26,080
so what so they're gonna make something beautiful today with
Furby actually gonna turn our robot into a Furby well we

509
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:35,440
know someone who has a lot of experience 3d printing Furby
projects I never like these masks probably want that mask

510
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:43,000
holy shit that's terrifying that's fucking terrifying by the
way I've I've never watched the full video.

511
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,040
I only watched like the final product.

512
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,000
So I actually don't know what it is.

513
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,000
I don't know how they made this.

514
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,680
Our first step was to 3D scan the robot and send it to him
so he could accurately model the Furby parts for it.

515
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,160
I'm collecting so many points of data.

516
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,020
Now I'm going to angle down and kind of get some of the
nooks and crannies.

517
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,520
Show me your crannies.

518
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,840
All right.

519
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,480
Evan's zooming in on his butt.

520
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,880
Well good posing.

521
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,440
So we just got an update from Austin.

522
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,360
He has a few different mockups of different forms.

523
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:19,520
wait different forms there's more than one when we were
originally talking about this idea Evan was showing like see

524
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:26,320
if we can try to put the the Furby's face like directly over
the front of it oh god that's that's more terrifying maybe

525
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:33,740
than what it was what it came to be the best ones that I
could think of and included like some of the pros and cons

526
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:44,520
and I think we've got yes I'm ready so the first option oh
god oh no i'm just gonna say this up front it's possible

527
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:53,680
that these mock-ups might be too good i know that's really
good glorious heights here we go we'll start with the pros

528
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:02,480
he's huggable yes he's huggable like you hugged this baby i
thought about like baby doll arm sort of thing yeah i've got

529
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,300
mixed feelings yeah there's plenty of room for the
electronics cons It might just look like it's a Furby

530
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:13,600
sitting on a dog's head attachment points is another thing
that we might need to figure out Yeah, we want to make sure

531
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,820
it's not top heavy and toppling right?

532
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:31,860
Well, it's the spider Oh Oh No Oh, I'm so uncomfortable
Arachno Furby Arachno Furby Once again, it could look like a

533
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:37,080
Furby is riding the back of a dog We could have people
commenting how it doesn't actually have six legs Well

534
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,000
spiders have eight legs, so we'd have a lot of legs.

535
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,540
So this is the last one.

536
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,140
I call this one Mr. Nodak What is that?

537
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,840
Oh God.

538
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,320
It looks like a primate Furby Uses less material.

539
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,580
Yeah, very human-like.

540
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,140
It's so cool.

541
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,480
I was like, that looks so cool though.

542
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,160
Look, think of the Twitch Prime.

543
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,140
Thank you.

544
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:07,280
But the original thing that brought up this whole issue was
the front sensors.

545
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:07,900
Yeah.

546
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Yes.

547
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,680
It might be okay, but we could just avoid the whole worry by
going with the Centaur, you know?

548
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,080
Right.

549
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,700
I mean, even though Mr. No-neck looks amazing, and that was
actually one of my original visions, I'm most curious about

550
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,120
Centaur.

551
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:19,660
What about you?

552
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,020
I am also, I think, leaning towards Centaur.

553
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,180
I feel like it gives us a little bit more wiggle room in
terms of electronics.

554
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,500
And honestly, I thought it would be much more cursed feeling
to me, but he almost feels like a llama.

555
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,140
Like he's just got a really long hand.

556
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

557
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,640
He looks so huggable.

558
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:44,780
To be fair you compared this with the other two that we saw
like this looks in between oh, it's so cute now This looks

559
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:55,880
actually cute compared to the other ones that we saw Like it
actually makes it look good I mean compared to the fucking

560
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:05,200
spider It's a no-neck come on So we thought we'd add a pop
of color with pink inspired by the original gray and pink

561
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:12,560
furby we bought i had a furby i had the furby and those
little dog ones little dog pets it's on sale it's always on

562
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:20,540
sale and then the how is it the cat the cat ones as well no
neck was not cute no i don't know what you guys are thinking

563
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:26,680
no neck was not cute it looks like a monkey with a furby
attached to his head we can just save it right yeah

564
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,520
oh for real friends yes That's a pretty good match.

565
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,120
Yeah, it's a good match for the gray.

566
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,760
You combine that with the pink.

567
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,700
I feel like it's very Furby-esque.

568
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,080
That's very Furby-esque.

569
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,200
We did it baby.

570
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,580
He's gonna be so hairy.

571
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,220
He's gonna be so hairy.

572
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:53,460
How to attach all this fur to our- I like how they're giving
us a tutorial on making our very own Furby.

573
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,500
So Furby core.

574
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,060
You cover that with tape.

575
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,240
And then you sharpie over the tape, cut out your pattern,
and then make that in fabric.

576
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:01,700
Yeah.

577
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,560
Let's see how this works.

578
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:10,260
any like and i think the good news okay so i need you guys
to know these costs like what is it it costs like more than

579
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:20,520
30 grand right the boston robots on its own yeah any like
super rich dragoons want to make a dragoon version of a

580
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:31,360
dragon version oh like 10k oh it's less now it used to be
like crazy expensive when they first launched oh it's a

581
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:41,280
thousand six hundred now wait that's a see ya any like
engineer dragoons any engineer dragoons that can make this

582
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,120
oh yeah because it's like mass produced now when it first
came out it was like crazy fucking expensive cut it she

583
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:54,060
ripped it which maybe is best practice for this type of
fabric but she had to use so much effort she was like hold

584
00:53:54,060 --> 00:54:00,160
on i need to chug this real quick i couldn't buy one but i'm
not an engineer i can't make my own dragoon version of this

585
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:06,640
moved on to other one and i was like can i help like I don't
know what I didn't know what to do to like be helpful, but

586
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,860
she was just just oh, it's not from Boston Dynamics It's a
bootleg

587
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:22,380
Can copy your homework let me change it up a little bit
Okay, let's take a little little dress for sure.

588
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,280
Oh, yeah, oh this cuts fine I don't know why she didn't cut
it.

589
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,920
They just use some heavy freaking duty scissors.

590
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,540
They have every freaking duty scissors.

591
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:36,260
It's it's Joann's Either way, I was rooting for her the
whole time.

592
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,600
Can I see that cross-section?

593
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,520
And then the short...

594
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,860
So I'm going to skip the...

595
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,420
I'm going to skip the fur part.

596
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:46,900
Oh my god.

597
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:48,760
What?

598
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,340
Look at it?

599
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,880
That's kind of glorious.

600
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,660
Do you want to do the rest of the leg and see what it looks
like?

601
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:01,080
Oh, they're like plastic wrapping it so the fur doesn't come
off.

602
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,380
Oh, or like getting the...

603
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,620
Oh, they're getting like the pattern.

604
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:12,740
I see there you go there you go Can you imagine it We're
skipping the fur part of the furby Oh my god It looks so

605
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:19,300
good We did such a good job It actually looks so good Oh my
god Yeah I was gonna say the Boston 9 hours When they're

606
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:24,680
crazy expensive Showing like at the elbow and stuff It
doesn't bother me at all Like here it is But you zoom out

607
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:36,660
You don't even notice that Yeah Oh Hey thank you for the
Thank you for the tier 1 set Thank you See it doesn't look

608
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,860
that fucked up.

609
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,500
He's just getting a fur.

610
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:44,040
When we started this project, I really had no clue how we
were going to make it happen.

611
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,740
It doesn't look that bad, guys.

612
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,080
I'm looking at this.

613
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,680
I'll tell you guys the end result looks so cute.

614
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,000
We're doing it.

615
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,060
We don't need any fast patterns or anything like that.

616
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,340
But we are winging it and it's working.

617
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,380
Okay.

618
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,840
Can you walk without the fur getting caught in the joints?

619
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,260
I was not smart enough to do this.

620
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,460
Maybe we check.

621
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,120
Maybe we check after the walk.

622
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:12,760
streams just making like verbi abominations oh my gosh i'm
getting done oh yeah he's moving oh he's moving and grooving

623
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:28,520

boston dynamics like released the first video the dog and

624
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:34,280
all they did was just push it around and like hit it it No!

625
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,080
Can we know a little bit of what we're getting?

626
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,040
But we haven't seen what it looks like.

627
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,900
They stop!

628
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:41,820
Is that a note?

629
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,840
Oh my god.

630
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,440
Oh god.

631
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,420
Austin.

632
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,520
The exhilarating Furbot instruction manual.

633
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh my gosh!

634
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,000
Look at this!

635
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,580
This is so fantastic!

636
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,500
First thing I see is this adorable thing.

637
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:00,360
Yeah, you guys are going to see an even more adorable thing
later.

638
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,620
Oh my god, they gave me this.

639
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,080
in it for a second.

640
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,380
No, I don't get paid!

641
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,460
Squarespace doesn't sponsor this?

642
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,940
Guys, no, don't type that URL.

643
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,300
Instead type the gamer subs way.

644
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,740
Don't type this URL.

645
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,100
Okay, step one.

646
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,620
Insert both support arms into the main support base and
tighten both- We don't get paid.

647
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,580
Step two, slide battery power bank into dedicated slot on
backup quadruped.

648
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,200
Wrap, buckle, and tighten down both support straps around
the cargo bed robot.

649
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,780
I'll pay somebody to follow these instructions.

650
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,760
Okay, place Furby Body on Main Support Base, aligning with
Magnus.

651
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,820
Make a Dragoon version of this.

652
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,300
I will pay you, I will pay Dragoon to make a Dragoon version
of this.

653
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:50,660
I can see.

654
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,180
There's no fur.

655
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,360
Yeah, it's just like the bones.

656
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,940
I can see the mouth through there.

657
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,160
Where's your Squarespace sponsorship?

658
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,500
I don't know Squarespace.

659
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,840
Where is my Squarespace sponsorship?

660
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,660
That's asleep right now.

661
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,620
Oh, this is...

662
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,660
And then have it run around conventions and just terrorize
people.

663
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:18,690
Oh, God.

664
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:20,970
I don't like...

665
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,290
I think he looks worse with the eyes closed.

666
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,390
Oh, I hate that.

667
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:26,510
I don't like that.

668
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,910
I think it's, like, really bad because he doesn't even have
fur.

669
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,470
It's like a skinned Furby.

670
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:31,930
Let's power it up.

671
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,010
God, save us all.

672
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,210
That's awful.

673
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:43,130
Maverick, thank you for the 25k in the sauce.

674
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:43,650
Thank you.

675
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:44,570
Thank you.

676
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:47,890
He's like awakening as he's being operated on.

677
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:49,850
Like his anesthesia is lifting.

678
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:50,710
Oh my gosh.

679
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,850
Let's open the box.

680
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,250
Okay, let's open this last box.

681
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,370
I hate this abomination.

682
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,550
That's so sweet.

683
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,390
Oh my god!

684
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:13,290
Oh, so cute!

685
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,390
They made pens dispenser as a gift.

686
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,770
Stop looking at me.

687
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,530
Just like chalk.

688
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:29,270
Okay, back to it.

689
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:29,830
Back to it.

690
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,070
Let's make it say something.

691
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,710
Ready?

692
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:32,450
Yeah.

693
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:37,050
Doof, doof, doof.

694
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,470
Doof, come on.

695
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:39,450
I'm moving with the words.

696
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:40,770
It's getting it.

697
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,390
Subscribe, subscribe to heaven.

698
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:48,150
Okay, look, for all the...

699
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:54,310
I'm saying, all I'm saying, Dragoons, I'll pay someone to
make a Dragoon equivalent version of this, and then I'll

700
00:59:54,310 --> 01:00:00,490
want it to run around different conventions and be like,
subscribe to dokeybirding.

701
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:24,230
Yeah, I wanted to just to start chilling me I I will pay a
smart engineering dragon to do this I will I will do it I

702
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:32,670
think I think the investment the investment goes a long way
A large switch on the back of the Furbot.

703
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:37,490
If Curiosity got the best of you, you may have found that
no, it's not a power switch to the Furbot.

704
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,330
The switch toggles cursed mode.

705
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:40,250
Curse mode.

706
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:44,030
The effects of this mode will become immediately obvious
upon toggling the switch while the Furbot is powered on.

707
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:45,530
I'm so tempted to press it.

708
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:46,230
I know, me too.

709
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:49,710
Me too, I want to press it, but I feel like we need to
finish him first.

710
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:50,350
Yeah, no.

711
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,830
And then see what can be more cursed than he already is.

712
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,050
He's rising.

713
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:56,390
Oh!

714
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:58,850
The Texas!

715
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,190
The curse of Irby.

716
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,490
Oh my god.

717
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,150
Oh my god.

718
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,950
Oh my god.

719
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,450
This is everything that I hope for.

720
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:12,810
I said thank you for the Twitch prize.

721
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:18,310
Wait, is that even Chris mode?

722
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:19,750
Is it Chris mode yet?

723
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:22,390
I'm ready.

724
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,430
Oh yeah, they're gonna resonate.

725
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,170
Are you gonna put fur on it now?

726
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:28,810
Help.

727
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,950
Oh my gosh.

728
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:35,510
They're like mummifying it.

729
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,650
It's almost like they're mummifying the furby.

730
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,440
That's 3D printed some of yours.

731
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,400
Can you see me?

732
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,880
I can see you.

733
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,620
It's evolving in real time.

734
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,140
It's getting so dusty.

735
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:10,140
I seriously think I'm more used to cat hair being on me Like
this is normal I don't know

736
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:30,780
It's like more fur than robotics if you think about it Oh
god his neck is so long Guys don't look yet There's another

737
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:37,440
child that I really like to watch That does like that does
like Repurposing like Halloween decorations

738
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,210
Oh my god, look at his last try.

739
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,190
Oh my god, you guys!

740
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,730
It's everything I wanted.

741
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:57,190
And more.

742
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:00,830
Not to pat ourselves on the back, but like, we did a really
good job.

743
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,530
Oh my god!

744
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:02,270
He's outside!

745
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:09,050
He is very cursed, but he can still move around, but he's
got that Kirby vibe.

746
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,870
There you go!

747
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,830
Bro, he's better than a real dog!

748
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:19,850
Because he could actually talk!

749
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,150
You'd be like, what?

750
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:26,110
Doki, what happened to Doki Amberdoge?

751
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:29,690
And then...

752
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:29,910
Oh!

753
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:31,570
No, he's getting eggs!

754
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:36,230
That was a lot of our new friends introduced themselves.

755
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,010
Hello, Evan.

756
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,360
How going?

757
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,320
Hello, Coco.

758
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,760
Bring me to life.

759
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:48,740
With good,

760
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,310
I am no longer well

761
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,360
for now.

762
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,420
Coco seems like a nice guy.

763
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,700
So I think he was ready to be introduced to the world.

764
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,260
What do you think?

765
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,040
He seems safe.

766
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:20,560
Yeah.

767
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:21,540
Yeah.

768
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,020
Safe.

769
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,420
Coco seems like a nice guy.

770
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,240
Oh, my God.

771
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,560
Seeing him move like that is so scary.

772
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,220
Oh, my God, he's like shaking his hips.

773
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:31,720
I'm sure it won't be bad.

774
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:32,400
Oh, yeah.

775
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,560
We never got to see evil mode.

776
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,920
I never got to see evil mode.

777
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,080
Evan's pushing the button.

778
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:39,980
What's evil mode?

779
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,540
What does it look like?

780
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,100
Oh, I don't like...

781
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,160
Oh, I don't like evil.

782
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:48,780
Oh!

783
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,040
I don't like evil mode.

784
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,700
Imagine just having this running around during Halloween.

785
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:05,960
Oh!

786
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,000
Oh, no.

787
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,760
It, like, looks towards me.

788
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,080
Can I beat?

789
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,460
Thank you for the tier one song.

790
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,440
Thank you.

791
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,160
Thank you.

792
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:25,900
No!

793
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,860
Okay, back in normal mode.

794
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:35,780
Shall we take him out?

795
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:36,800
Let's take him out.

796
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,820
I'm sure no one will be creeped out by this.

797
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,400
Okay, so I watched the ending.

798
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:41,320
I skipped all the...

799
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,860
I skipped, like, how to make it, but I watched the ending of
this.

800
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,500
Taking it out for a walk.

801
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,980
I didn't even know about the curse mode.

802
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,620
I love how they gave Coco a dog tag and a collar.

803
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,900
And it's named Coco!

804
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,220
The dog tag is named Coco!

805
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,060
Oh!

806
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:06,760
No!

807
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,800
Oh god it's so...

808
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,000
The poor dog!

809
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,280
She's like a new poster, correct?

810
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,480
The poor dog!

811
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,300
Look at this.

812
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,320
Look at this.

813
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:22,880
Look at the usual.

814
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,720
Let's say the least.

815
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,400
And then look at the eyes.

816
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,140
That is so rat.

817
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,400
That is so rat.

818
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,360
That is awesome.

819
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,700
That is so cool.

820
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,440
He's like, ah!

821
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,260
He's a propaganda dog.

822
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:41,680
Yeah.

823
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,180
So rat.

It's like a real dog.

828
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,720
This guy hasn't infected with internet yet.

829
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,840
Be used later for protection and security when they put a
gun attached to it.

830
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,960
The new protection.

831
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,160
Oh my god, look!

832
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,520

Ugh.

860
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:22,110
She has a whole drawer for, like, her kid.

861
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:26,350
Like, this is just dedicated to making food for her
children.

862
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:28,030
What a mom.

863
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:44,120
Like, she has, like, like, there's, like, There's a lot of
these channels of, like, moms making school lunches, or,

864
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,080
like, just, like, lunch and dinner for their children.

865
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:51,320
And, like, one of the moms, like, showed their fucking
collection of cookie cutters.

866
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,820
It was actually crazy.

867
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:57,920
They had, like, they had, like, oh, I think, like, 100
cookie cutters for different themes.

868
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,660
Like, the budget for this?

869
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:02,720
Not gonna lie.

870
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,460
Okay, this is fucked up for me to say.

871
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,180
Uh, this is...

872
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:21,900
so fucked up for me to say but like i feel like she could
buy healthier foods for their child um like that's tastier

873
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:30,200
for like one third of the price of all this stuff oh she has

874
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:40,700
like just like look because you need two cookie cutters And
then look at all this!

875
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,260
Oh my god, that's a lot of seasoning.

876
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,120
Oh my god.

877
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,900
Like, she has, like, a snack drawer, too.

878
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:55,360
And then, like, a container for cheeses?

879
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,610
Anyway, she does, like, but it's crazy.

880
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:09,890
She's, like, so dedicated to her child.

881
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,510
Because...

882
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:16,350
Because she made, like, her own bakery for her child.

883
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:24,650
like oh my god that we often go to she's so creative
surprise her by giving her a french bakery i decided that i

884
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:31,270
was going to at least attempt to make many of the baked
goods by hand even though i don't know how to sew after many

885
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:36,410
failed attempts she doesn't know how to sew but look at what
she made one night at one o'clock in the morning when i

886
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:43,890

lunchbox ideas so for clarification This is a loose

900
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:40,830
interpretation of a ramen bowl not to be taken literally my
harshest critic so if she loves it that's oh my god she no

906
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:15,990
Oh, look at this.

907
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,550
Okay, okay, look at it.

908
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:18,250
Where is it?

909
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:19,750
There was like, did you guys know?

910
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:25,430
Okay, at one point, my algorithm was filled with like Lego
builders.

911
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,570
And like, there was like this, apparently there's like
custom Lego blocks.

912
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:30,990
Where is it?

913
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:33,670
I was, I got recommended some like custom Legos.

914
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:35,470
I was like, what the fuck?

915
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:36,390
Oh, wait, here you go.

916
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:41,630
$211 worth of custom cursed Lego parts, which are the
weirdest in the world.

917
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:42,830
Let's find out what's inside.

918
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:47,170
The first item is a custom Walter White from Breaking Bad.

919
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:50,210
Walter comes with, of course, some nice blue candy, and he
snubbed those over.

920
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:53,450
I looked at the website and like...

921
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:58,450
In this bag, we have an Amazon Prime box and a custom
military helmet.

922
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:01,890
I also got this very strange long head with lots of pieces
around the head.

923
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:04,050
I actually sort of went the long heads.

924
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,590
I don't know what these guys are, but they look funny
enough.

925
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:06,930
Here we have this guy.

926
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:09,130
Look at this tiny face!

927
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:11,030
I've also got this weird double-faced head.

928
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,130
And also this drunken long clown face.

929
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:16,330
I also bought this calculator with a hidden message when you
flip it upside down.

930
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,250
Too bad I can't read.

931
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,450
Here's this cracked phone.

932
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,390
A US passport.

933
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:20,170
A bounce trap.

934
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,150
I also got this oddly chilled sock monkey.

935
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,950
A snack people were eating for some reason.

936
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:24,970
Here's a magic eight ball.

937
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,490
Here we have an innocent videotape.

938
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:27,770
Lastly, a pouch of blood.

939
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:29,430
It's so cool.

940
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:30,190
What the fuck?

941
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:33,130

01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,130
There's like this channel.

01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:36,850
What's that keep going?

944
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:48,770
Anyway, anyway, so there's like this channel, by the way,

russian channels i don't know if it's like i can't tell if

947
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:17,730
it's deep fake or not but like i think it's deep fake
because people are like debating debating it in comments and

948
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:28,350

01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:15,590
I think it's deep fake, but like, they have like, they have

Like, this is cyrofoam!

1016
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:09,850

1018
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,810

Not only can he make, like, whole, like, props for his
figures, but he can make a fucking figure himself.

1026
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:39,010
He doesn't even need to buy figures anymore.

1027
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:40,150
He can literally make them.

1028
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,490
What's the channel name?

1029
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:44,230

Got a 3D printer.

because of gender reviews.

01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:05,560

I'll be on this train.

1062
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,140
Clever, gruh.

1063
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:17,880
He watched the pretty random videos.

1065
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:24,220

1066
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:24,880
I just...

1067
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,940
I'm very...

1068
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:39,060
cultured I guess I watch a lot of fucking random videos I
grew up on the internet finally a normal video my algorithm

1072
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:16,280

1074
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,480

I don't know you know this they make like clay woozoo clay I
really enjoy their stuff it's so cute and very peaceful they

1076
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,040
mostly do like Minecraft because of the algorithm

1077
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:53,500
But I found the way they do, like, the clay art to be, like,
really creative.

1078
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:06,010
Like, I like the little, like, the template they use to help
make the clay art.

1079
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:08,670
Minecraft IRL.

1080
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,010
Yeah, that's what he does.

1081
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:11,170
So interesting.

1082
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,960
And he put his pieces together.

1083
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:32,470
It's so peaceful.

1084
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:35,270
But you can see that it slowly becomes...

1085
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:36,230
Like, look at that!

1086
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:38,070
Oh my god, it's all coming together.

1087
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:45,350
It's very satisfying.

1088
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:49,590
What a submarine!

1089
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:51,850
It's a fucking Minecraft shipwreck.

1090
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:11,230
And they're making the...

1091
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,330
They're making the bottom base of it, I think.

1092
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,350
Yeah, so they're making the...

1093
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:20,110
and the sand biome.

1094
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:26,110
So, so nice.

1095
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:28,390
Very relaxing.

1096
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:30,650
I can do that.

1097
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:33,290
Yeah?

1098
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:36,710
Where's your 2 million subscribers channel?

1099
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:38,070
Where is it?

1100
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,920
Oh my god, it fits perfectly.

1101
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:58,740
I like how there's like Christmas background music in the
background where's yours exactly that is why I'm not

1102
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:03,540
talented enough and I said I joined people's content for
react

1103
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:16,320
that's why I don't have two million subscribers let's go
react at these

1104
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:20,680
Wait, what's that?

1105
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:22,780
What is...

1106
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,480
Oh, that's not the seaweed, right?

1107
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,540
I haven't watched this video yet.

1108
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,600
I watched his other clay videos.

1109
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,020
Oh my god.

1110
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,580
Imagine, like, putting...

1111
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,000
Those could be, like, surgeon fingers, too.

1112
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,620
I feel like instead of becoming a surgeon, a lot of...

1113
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:48,560
It's either you be a surgeon with those, like, steady hands
or, like, uh, or a crafter.

1114
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,860
Yeah, the tiny details.

1115
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:53,700
And then the coral.

1116
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:55,680
Oh, my God.

1117
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,740
They're all broken.

1118
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,560
This could, but this is cooler.

1119
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,620
Look at that.

1120
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,080
That's so fucking tiny.

1121
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:10,540
Oh, I love Tiny Kitchen.

1122
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,000
I watch their stuff, too.

1123
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:13,760
I love Tiny Kitchen.

1124
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,020

01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:09,620
then you're gonna add resin i love the crafting channels

1135
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:27,990
i thought she was joking holy shit it's so tiny next to the
lego i didn't realize how tiny it was

1136
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,410
and then you're gonna put resin on it

1137
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,920
wait they're making their own dye around

1138
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:11,940
My god.

1139
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,920
They didn't even buy a diorama.

1140
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,580
They made their own diorama.

1141
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:20,920
Oh god.

1142
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:25,440
Pushing that down would like make me so scared.

1143
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,000
Yeah, they made their little wood stand.

1144
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,680
I'd be so scared pushing that down.

1145
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,740
And so they have to mix the resin.

1146
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:50,860
thing about resin is that you have to it has to be like 50
50 exactly you have because of chemistry if it's not 50 50

1147
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,600
exactly you you fuck up the resin

1148
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:08,070
so good and the air bubbles make sense because it's water
holy shit

1149
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:24,600
are you gonna take out take off the uh are you gonna take
out the glass part to like keep that in it's so sick i know

1150
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:32,620

everything is like super precise and everything all right

1152
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:53,260
now that we're talking about crafting channel let me show
you guys another uh another craft person that i like to

dioramas that stuff is that's like that's so pretty those
are really cool yeah

1156
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:40,420
and because they need like multiple too they need more than
one card to make this so they have to like like they want to

1157
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:46,580
use like authentic pokemon cards so like they have to make
buy like multiple copies of it

1158
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:59,280
i love doll life was one of my favorite uh doll creators um
and also speaking of dolls because I saw a lot of people,

1159
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:03,260
like, the Doki Bird doll dropped from Moonlight Jewel as
well.

1160
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:05,040
I love watching doll videos.

1161
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:10,380
But, like, the Doki Bird doll video dropped as well.

1162
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:12,120

1166
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,180
That's so pretty.

1167
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:35,560
it's so good all right before we do we should like watch
something fucked up before we watch something uh normal

1168
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:50,120
man i wish i could show like some of the animation channels

1169
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:58,720
i told you guys like so my favorite animation channel is
like there's cast there's flash gets uh and there's meat

1170
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:03,100
canyon but like i feel like if i show you guys

1171
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:22,640
the humor's not for everybody but like those are that's my
humor that's technically my humor um let's see oh i saw like

1172
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:27,540

but those who need to learn japanese this is not actually
helpful

1176
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:10,970
okay the reason why is that like i saw this of it which was
really nice.

1177
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:34,790
.

1178
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,930

1181
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:35,590
.

1182
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:35,750
.

1183
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:36,270

else what else i want to show you guys uh all right let's

1191
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:36,330
look at the oh my god okay have you guys seen those like rug
videos i've been like watching okay i've been watching like

1194
01:40:51,750 --> 01:41:04,310
interesting too the rug making videos no not the cleaning
ones I'm just watch people make rugs like that's it that's

1195
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:06,110
it I literally watch people make rugs

1196
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:18,130
oh it's so nice too the asmr of it it sounds so relaxing

1197
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:30,630
it's so talented too because you have to be like super
precise with everything and look at that and then trimming

1198
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:40,410
it all and then making it so that like things are making it
so that these are more like bumpy than the others oh i've

1200
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,730
Look at that.

Oh my god, I want this rug.

Can someone make a dokeybird rug?

1203
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:55,370
All right, let's watch the doll video.

1204
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:56,530
I haven't watched it yet.

1205
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:58,970
I saved it, though.

1206
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:00,730
Here it is.

1207
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:01,290
Hey-ho.

1208
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:06,690
So if you guys been watching me for a while, you probably
know that I have made some VTuber dolls in the past.

1209
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:07,970
As me, I'm a VTuber.

1210
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:10,910
I love making videos.

1211
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:17,590
I thought how about I make another VTuber doll before I am
taking a tiny break from posting because She's talking about

1212
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:24,870
me guys a lot amazingly enough the decision who to make was
made pretty easy when I saw that the amazing Duckybird

1213
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:30,830
hosted a cherry stream and that's me Duckybird to
participate in that the artworks and items that the artist

1214
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:38,330
offered would then be auctioned off and The proceeds would
go to cherry so I applied get accepted and offered a slot of

1215
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:47,890
a custom Duckybird doll that will go which is what we are
going to do today as always blue pixie did an amazing job by

1216
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:53,830
already sculpting a beautiful face and some of those are my
eyes so how about we get my 3d printer and some resin

1217
01:42:53,830 --> 01:43:02,610

01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:20,680

preparations are done we can now Lude tomato hashtag as a

1222
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:55,820
full-time content creator.

1223
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:03,500
I have to make sure to stay always on top of the game When
it comes to trends on social media one recent trend that I

1224
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,840
picked up was people telling their own stories through short
form.

1225
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:13,060
Yeah, bro Those is I wanted to learn more about this subject
and then found.

1226
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:13,520
Oh my god.

1227
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:17,420
Okay from Holly as a never okay Sorry, I'm gonna skip your
ad

1228
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:29,780
her she reminded me of this other channel that i really like
to watch i think it's nerdy is what is it that she it's also

1229
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:37,640
like a crafting channel too uh her like personality reminds
me of that channel where it's i'm trying to remember they

1230
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:45,740
like make like really cool fat like really cool gaming stuff
as well they once made like a custom was it a pc that was

1231
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:52,200
like inspired by cyberpunk i'm trying to remember the name
we should watch some of their stuff nerd forge yes I love

1232
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:52,820
NerdForge!

1233
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:55,420
This time I start by gluing the bangs on my favorite
channels.

1234
01:44:55,820 --> 01:45:00,960
An essential item that I found recently for making wigs is
this matte styling wax.

1235
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:03,660
Because with this you can really mold the hair into shape.

1236
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:04,300
It's amazing.

1237
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:09,920
To make Docky's bangs a little more spiky, I thin out the
hair by vertically cutting into them and then use the

1238
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,660
styling wax and heat to mold them in shape.

1239
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:16,440
The curling wand is an excellent tool for flattening down
the hair as well.

1240
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:21,440
When I was satisfied with the look, I then proceed and glue,
cut and style her hemobangs.

1241
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:27,100
The front of her hairstyle was actually not that easy to
mimic, which is why I decided to start the wig with it this

1242
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:27,380
time.

1243
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:31,540
The hemobanks are kind of like layered and it was a bit
tricky to make that work.

1244
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:36,920
Once I was satisfied with the look on the front, I glued
more layers on her middle part on top of the head.

1245
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:40,120
And then decided to use my thinning shears to thin out the
hair.

1246
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:42,140
I thought my skin, the skin suit was easier.

1247
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,740
And then finally start on the back of the head.

1248
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:49,800
For the pigtail look, I will go around here in the direction
of the pigtails on the back of her head.

1249
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:58,600
and believe me it was but I basically just had to pull all
the glued hair into a pigtail and then for the final layers

1250
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:04,940
I prepped a bunch of folded around glued wifts which I now
will be using to create all the parting lines on the wig

1251
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:12,180
this was a lot of work and I've been working on the wig for
the whole day already and it was evening and I was pretty

1252
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:19,980
tired so I did that off-camp and I'm sorry oh my god look at
all that hair to make so many layers I cut this shape from

1253
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:23,080
fabric Thank you, thank you!

1254
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:23,520
Yeah!

1255
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,580
Hello, everybody.

1256
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,680
It's me, Ducky Bird.

1257
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:29,580
She's on YouTube.

1258
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,880
But today I'm on Twitch because I'm a React Andy today.

1259
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,480
I made a spade charm to it that I made with my laser cutter.

1260
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:38,180
I also made another ribbon the same way in white.

1261
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:39,180
Oh my gosh, the ribbon's so cute.

1262
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:45,300
And here you can see the final wig so far, on which I now
can finally attach the ribbons with some hot glue.

1263
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:51,160
I actually did try to make Ducky's head out of fabric, but I
failed miserably.

1264
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:57,660
So blue came to the rescue here and sculpted Ducky's head so
I could then see he printed in resin.

1265
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:02,020
And I then just have to simply paint it according to Ducky's
very hard to make.

1266
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:07,740
I love how flawless it looks and will now also glue it to
the wig so that it won't fall off and potentially break in

1267
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:12,980
worst case since resin is a little bit more brittle than
filament and tends to break more easily.

1268
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:17,260
The finished wig looks so cute already and I'm really proud
of the little bows.

1269
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,100
I'm not a fan of making the layers.

1270
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:21,960
the end.

1271
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:23,960
Let's paint Docky's face next.

1272
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:29,780
The pixie did such a nice job sculpting it that you can
already tell by the sculpt itself that it is really

1273
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:30,340
Dockybird.

1274
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:34,080
As always I'm giving the face some sheen with pearly
shimmers.

1275
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:40,020
You can really go a bit overboard with them as sealing them
with Mr. Super Clear later on will make them disappear a

1276
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:40,500
little again.

1277
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:44,200
I also add a little bit of blushing to different areas of
the face.

1278
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:50,620
I know enemy faces tend to look more flat so adding a bit
more blushing i think that's like for example the hardest

1279
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:59,600
part with uh when i was satisfied with the hardest part with
like painting figures is to make it not like one dimensional

1280
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:06,820
type deal and adding shading i mean that's like the hardest
part i've seen so many like custom figures and stuff that

1281
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:14,600
like um that like forget to do like the important parts of
shading because it's so hard to make it look right as well i

1282
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:19,140
then can finally go in with black acrylic paint and line the
lashes with it.

1283
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:24,020
Of course, I also have to line Docky's cute little smug
smile using some gouache paint.

1284
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:27,260
Mistakes can be carefully scratched away with an exacto
knife.

1285
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:27,860
So cute.

1286
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:33,540
To give the eyebrows a little bit more of a blonde look, I
decided to use a little bit of pastel yellow on the middle

1287
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,380
of them, and I really like the look.

1288
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:41,980
For the finishing touches of the face, I'm using my favorite
iridescent sparkly shimmers on her cheeks and forehead

1289
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:44,080
before sealing her off the final time.

1290
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:50,140
To make Docky's eyes, I made these tiny templates on my iPad
and and printed them onto some cardboard paper.

1291
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,900
I'm then taking my half sphere mold and will use the third
biggest one.

1292
01:48:54,080 --> 01:49:01,140
Using some UV resin, I drop one drop of it into the mold and
then place the iris onto the resin upside down like this.

1293
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:06,140
I let it cure for a minute and then add some white UV resin
that I mixed with some white resin pigment.

1294
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:10,140
I cure it again for about three minutes and then it's time
to demold the eye.

1295
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:12,060
And it's for me.

1296
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:12,820
Oh my God.

1297
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:17,960
This happened because my mold might be a little old at this
point and this white.

1298
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:24,220
But don't worry, we're here to rescue it because I can
simply use some UV top coat and gloss it over.

1299
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,760
And to make the resin spread evenly, I can use a lighter and
then cure it in my V-Lamp.

1300
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:29,260
She's blind.

1301
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:33,520
The finished eyes look like this and I think they're really
pretty and super shy.

1302
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:38,800
I mean, honestly, like, that's not a surprise.

1303
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:40,380
I'm just so cute.

1304
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,200
Oh my God.

1305
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,620
The face already looks so much like a docky.

1306
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:47,420
So I absolutely cannot wait to make her outfit next.

1307
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:49,140
Docky's outfit.

1308
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:53,200
I actually really had to think how to even be able to
realize it.

1309
01:49:53,360 --> 01:50:00,920
In the end I opted to make an underdress with the white top
part and a layered skirt and then basically make a black

1310
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:02,760
dress topper separately.

1311
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,280
And of course then make the jacket, accessories and shoes.

1312
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,900
So how about we start with the underdress first.

1313
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:11,080
First let's make the skirt of Docky's dress.

1314
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:17,120
Since it has three layers and little white strips on them I
decided to cut the strips from white fabric vinyl.

1315
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:24,180
vinyl has such a nice and neat finish that i really enjoy
using it after cutting i just have to weed it out and here

1316
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:30,440
you can see i cut three ruffled pieces from blue fabric
already and will iron on those vinyl strips onto them first

1317
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:36,980
i'm just like thinking how expensive all of the machinery
for to make these custom dolls like this especially like

1318
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:44,180
resin dolls too the bottom seams and bottom top seams of the
smaller strips by yeah she's so good at like arts and crafts

1319
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:54,760
gathering threads and now have you guys seen this like
fashion designer that does like pop culture out like does

1320
01:50:54,760 --> 01:51:02,880
like outfits inspired by like movies and tv shows and like
cartoons and then she did one from like the rogers rabbit

1321
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:16,420
the the unrealistic expectations of women outfit uh what's
her name that what's her name she did like uh from roger

1322
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:23,320
rabbit uh jessica yeah jessica rabbit have you guys seen
that the there's like this like youtuber she does like very

1323
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:30,840
little uh she does like she doesn't upload a lot of videos
um but she she has like almost a million subscribers from

1324
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:38,140
the very few videos that she has uploaded it because it's
just so good i'll show it to you guys later however this

1325
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:41,440
whole skirt I saw the short of it and then I watched the
video.

1326
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:41,980
Wow!

1327
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:48,020
So I basically had to go back to the drawing board and try
to figure out how to make this skirt look better.

1328
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,700
I ended up going with a pleated look instead.

1329
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:53,860
So I prepped some new strips for the skirt and cleaned them
up.

1330
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:59,760
Then I sewed the two bottom pleated parts to a tool strip
and then attached the top pleated part to that tool strip.

1331
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:04,660
And then I pressed the pleats according to the markings on
the top pleated part.

1332
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:08,860
For the top part of Ducky's dress, I cut this white fabric
piece and then attach it.

1333
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:10,560
actually like so talented.

1334
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:16,720
I sew it, press it and then stitch it down like this so I
can now pull in a little rubber thread through the tunnel

1335
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,760
that we just created.

1336
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:24,720
If you have trouble threading in threads like this through
needles, a lot of TH, you can just use some tape, attach it

1337
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,860
to the end of the thread, cut it into a tip and then thread
it through the needle like this.

1338
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,640
This is just such a good trick I learned recently that I had
to share it with you guys.

1339
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:35,680
And then I just proceed and thread the rubber band into the
top.

1340
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:42,400
When that was done successfully, I then add a the bottom
part of the top piece and gather it to the length of the

1341
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:48,700
blue lower part of the top i pin it together and sew it
finished sides in afterwards it looks like this and as you

1342
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:55,460
can see i already pinned oh that's the top part of my outfit
sorry the popcorn's hiding it show them on good sides in and

1343
01:52:55,460 --> 01:53:02,520
boom a cute cat appeared a very important assistant i might
say here you can see the finished skirt and now i can take

1344
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:08,160
the finished part of the dress oh wait it's turning the
skirt before sewing the skirt and top together finished

1345
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:15,200
sides in my cat the ruffle straight up so pretty she was
however very interested in the glue cap the sewn together

1346
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:21,860
dress looks like this and i now just have to pin together
the back seam and sew it together about 2.5 inches leaving

1347
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:27,880
just enough of a gap for the closure the finished dress
turned out so good and you can see that even though i have

1348
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:33,760
been making dolls for years sometimes i have to remake
things in order to make them look better and more accurate

1349
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:39,980
and that's okay we learn from amazing sometimes let's make
the black topper that docky wears on top of her dress next i

1350
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:49,040
prepped the fabric pieces with white vinyl strips already
and i'll now bring the cat back where is my kitty cam i will

1351
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:55,580
now attach the blue lining pieces on which i also iron on
some white vinyl strips next i place them onto the black

1352
01:53:55,580 --> 01:54:03,600
parts good sides in and hem them on when flapping around the
lining parts it really looks like watch like this in the end

1353
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:09,700
i already cut and prep the skirt for the top by cleaning up
the bottom i think like honestly like the hardest part with

1354
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:17,680
clothes is based making clothes based off of like anime
characters is that a lot of the clothes that that like

1355
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:23,620
people design for anime characters looks like this is very
hard to make reality because they're not like physically

1356
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:34,120
possible so it's like always super impressive that they're
able to replicate in real life gluing some tiny golden half

1357
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:41,960
it's like designers like manga manga artists and like anime
artists dude the design is to make like clothes that look

1358
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:49,920
cool not like actually real with these final steps the dress
tupper is done and i'm super happy how it turned out it

1359
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:55,700
looks so much like ducky's outfit i think especially the
little details like the blue lining part with the white

1360
01:54:55,700 --> 01:55:03,120
stripes really make it look very accurate to the yeah art
cares not for gravity i first take the sleeves from gray

1361
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:07,800
cotton fabric and prepped them by pulling and gathering
threads on the top and bottom seams.

1362
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:14,160
I then gather the lower part of them and take these tiny
little cuffs that I prepped by ironing them in half and now

1363
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:16,920
pin them to the gathered sleeve parts and sew them on.

1364
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:22,120
When done with that the sleeves look really cute already and
I can now also gather the top part of them.

1365
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:28,440
I then set them aside for a bit and first we'll sew on the
facing for the raglan collar to the bodice of the jacket.

1366
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:32,640
Of course, I fray-checked all my fabric pieces to make sure
they won't trade before.

1367
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:39,180
And after sewing on and steaming the face, Kingdom Hearts
cosplay are very impressive, especially the shoes.

1368
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:40,720
The Kingdom Hearts shoes.

1369
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:42,340
They are not practical at all.

1370
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:46,240
And now I can finally take the crept sleeves and sew them
onto the bodice of the jacket with magic.

1371
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:52,500
Last but not least, I take my cat and gently push her out of
the way so I can show you that I just needed to close the

1372
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,480
sleeve and side stitch of the jacket still.

1373
01:55:54,660 --> 01:56:05,100
I pin them together neatly and try to match up all the live
action movie that disney approved i heard that was like the

1374
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:11,120
hardest part i pinned it before and now okay sorry this is
off topic because someone mentioned kingdom hearts you know

1375
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:19,240
how like the smash brothers trailer for for sora has no
donald and goofy because getting sora on his own was really

1376
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:26,260
hard getting getting disney characters in smash brothers
like okay this is the perfect cut by the way the perfect

1377
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:35,740
angle for you guys uh but if you don't if you notice um if
you notice in the kingdom hearts smash brothers reveal

1378
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:44,360
trailer the the the there there's no donald or goofy um at
all there's no reference to donald or goofy and even then

1379
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:52,300
getting the mickey mouse keychain on the keyblade was in
itself incredibly difficult to do because like you know

1380
01:56:52,300 --> 01:57:00,760
disney was like i don't know i'll definitely attach it to
the jacket with my beloved The horizontal strip is the final

1381
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,220
touch and will attach to the opposite side of the jacket
with a little velcro on the inside.

1382
01:57:04,220 --> 01:57:06,960
That's why like Donald and Goofy doesn't exist in Smash
Brothers.

1383
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:13,100
Or like there's no reference to Donald or Goofy in the for
Sora in Smash Bros.

1384
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:17,980
It's really difficult, but it's a challenge that I really
enjoy conquering.

1385
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,440
Feels like mini cosplay somehow.

1386
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:24,200
Did I actually ever tell you that I used to cosplay back in
the day pre-moonlight jewel times?

1387
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:26,080
Let's make Docky's boots next.

1388
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:27,940
I cut the boot pieces from blue fabric.

1389
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:34,400
already and first sew together the front seam but just about
half an inch after sewing and ironing it it looks like this

1390
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:40,320
and i can now proceed to glue around the seam allowance of
the upper boot part i then take this strip i cut from white

1391
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:46,920
fabric and disney will fuck up the kingdom oh absolutely
disney is past prime unless it goes into another renaissance

1392
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:55,200
era it looks really this is all about like corporate uh
money greed slash greed now for that i care also disney you

1393
01:57:55,200 --> 01:58:03,280
want to sponsor of the boot and instead of a zipper totally
not because i completely forgot to order some i will attach

1394
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:09,440
an elastic fabric on the back of the boot this time i first
glue around the top seam of the elastic fabric and then pin

1395
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:15,760
it to the boot piece like this by my silence along the boot
part of the boot and glue the rest with contact adhesive

1396
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:25,900
afterwards it looks really neat corporate green now not yet
and after that was done i turned the boot inside out and

1397
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:37,460
finally seem good sets in I turn it inside well you see me
sponsored by Disney you would know an old cereal packaging

1398
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:45,580
and will now glue the bottom of the boot oh my god how is
that not sensing for the shoe bases I printed these guide

1399
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:55,440
boys I also prepped these tiny buffers I cut from PVC
covered in silver vinyl on my laser cutter and now take tiny

1400
01:58:55,440 --> 01:59:01,220
pleather strips and thread them through the buckles first As
you can see, I attached one set of buckle straps to the boot

1401
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:03,420
already and will now do the same to the other.

1402
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:10,400
I simply attached them with glue and afterwards can finally
glue the upper boot part to the shoe base using some woohoo

1403
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,400
or purpose glue.

1404
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:15,020
Last but not least, I just attached a tiny golden star to
the boot as well.

1405
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:16,820
How tiny this is, the little stars.

1406
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:23,920
I decided to make them from fabric rather than pleather
because you can see that on Ducky's original artwork, the

1407
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:29,560
boots do actually have some wrinkles and I think the fabric
choice resembles this perfectly here.

1408
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:31,740
All right, the main part of the outfit is done.

1409
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,900
Let's make all of Docky's accessories.

1410
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:39,940
For her stocking, I will be using an actual human kite with
stripes like this and cut out the stocking pattern from it.

1411
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:41,840
I then clean up the other seam with glue.

1412
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:44,660
That's so resourceful.

1413
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:46,540
Not wasting materials.

1414
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:48,200
Afterwards, it looks like this.

1415
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:52,860
Because you can like, you know, there's like, if you want to
make more stock, you just get the same material.

1416
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:57,540
And then take this tiny white lace and glue it to the upper
part of the choker.

1417
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,940
I will do the exact same to the bottom part of the choker as
well and end up with something like this.

1418
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:10,160
Now I carefully glue a tiny satin ribbon to the front of the
choker and also add this tiny prepped folded ribbon to the

1419
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:11,480
middle of the choker as well.

1420
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:12,980
Oh well, I at least try to.

1421
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:18,860
For the final step, I take this tiny golden star and attach
it to the middle of the just attached satin ribbon.

1422
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,640
And with a tiny velcro on the back added, the choker is also
done.

1423
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:24,000
I didn't even know my boots were made of fabric, guys.

1424
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:34,640
aesthetic instead of practicality that's what i mean i
didn't even know i learned something new today i was like

1425
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:41,680
whoa my boots are fabric to really bond the two components i
use a little metal roll it's a really nice tool for that i

1426
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:48,720
proceed and cut the tiny back pieces from the material and
now first attach some glue to the back inside of the back to

1427
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:55,260
be able to attach the little side strip to it afterwards i
attach the front piece in the same fashion and end up with

1428
02:00:55,260 --> 02:01:00,540
this It's the back for all my seething tools.

1429
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:02,380
I don't know you guys know this.

1430
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:15,900
I'm a thief, by the way I don't know if you guys forgot or
not I glued it to the top part already and now we'll attach

1431
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:21,680
the bottom magnet as well with some super glue When it was
dry the back opens and closes nicely Yeah, it's like where I

1432
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:30,280
put all the tools to do the thieving things, you know like
the thief tools yeah turkey what's in what tools to be able

1433
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:37,560
to be used you know i glue them both to one side of the back
post and then carefully glue them around the leg on one of

1434
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:44,780
my novas you know those tools correct last but not least i
added these teeny tiny decorations to the back as well with

1435
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:51,900
some glue and tweezers and finish off the little leg back
like that as well only one more accessory to make the gloves

1436
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:58,100
for these i simply take a folded and cleaned up rectangle
cut from jersey fabric and will sew them along the short

1437
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:03,780
seam just leaving open a tiny gap for ducky's thumb kind of
the same way i made iron mouse's gloves back in the day i

1438
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:09,420
can then simply put them into the hands like this and i
really love this easy but nice technique i feel he's so

1439
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:15,700
stupid you need fingerprints all the accessories for ducky
bird's doll are finally done making accessories is

1440
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:21,600
definitely my favorite thing to do i was 50 done with those
gloves i've been loving ever since i was a kid i'm

1441
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:28,300
especially proud of that little leg back The doll is
actually done at this point, but for those of you who know

1442
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:30,280
me, you probably know that there is this.

1443
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:30,700
Best thief ever.

1444
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,200
Exactly, the doll stand.

1445
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:40,080
I have conveniently vectorized the logo already, so how
about we make that stand now with a final little montage.

1446
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:45,860
Oh, wow.

1447
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:56,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, it's so pretty!

1448
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:57,420
That's like my logo!

1449
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,940
Oh my god!

1450
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:03,940
Wait, that's the stand?

1451
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:07,300
Oh, I love it!

1452
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:10,160
Like the laser cut of the acrylic.

1453
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:18,860
And with that, the doll stand is also done and I can finally
assemble the doll completely for the very first time.

1454
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:23,060
And I was absolutely blown away by how cute she turned out
to be!

1455
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:23,860
It's me!

1456
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:24,780
Ducky!

1457
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:26,040
Ducky bird!

1458
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:28,620
She called me cute!

1459
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:31,800
I just put her together and she is everything.

1460
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:34,400
But I know you're probably dying to see her.

1461
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,460
So presentation time!

1462
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:36,820
Yay!

1463
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:48,580

Bro, you can barely tell which one's the real Ducky bird.

1466
02:04:01,140 --> 02:04:02,040

1467
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:02,580

1494
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:32,660
It's actually insane how talented her, how talented she is
in fashion.

1495
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:33,660
Here.

1496
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:39,400
Picking an hourglass body

1497
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:46,620
Like what the fuck

1498
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:53,210
You can do that

1499
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:58,740
Like oh my god

1500
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:11,920
Like what She went from an A to a D

1501
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:20,200
My ribs hurt.

1502
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:25,220
No, the thing is, she didn't even do it so much.

1503
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:27,900
And like, D for death.

1504
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:29,580
Like, look.

1505
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,720
All she did was just pad it up.

1506
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:32,840
It was just illusion.

1507
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:37,020
She got some foam and padded the fuck out of her thighs.

1508
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:41,180
And she got, like, four fucking bras.

1509
02:07:46,220 --> 02:07:55,660
life is a lie it's all pads i love her stuff she doesn't
even have that many videos but she her like look at how many

1510
02:07:55,660 --> 02:08:05,000
videos she has in general um but she already has three
almost three million views because of like how talented she

1511
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,480
is as a fashion designer like oh my god

1512
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:15,380
You're going for like an extreme look.

1513
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:16,440
Like look!

1514
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:22,140
Hello,

1515
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:27,700
my name is Shay and I like to make things.

1516
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:30,880
And this week I am telling you how I made my Jessica Rabbit
costume.

1517
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:31,200
Okay.

1518
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:35,900
Before I can even throw for it, I'm vaguely following these
two tutorials.

1519
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:37,820
But I'm just gonna kind of wing it.

1520
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:38,280
We'll see.

1521
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:39,840
I should do this.

1522
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:42,100
Okay, wrapping yourself in saran wrap.

1523
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:49,180
little like chicken leg hip shapes and cutting it all apart
to get your pattern it cut a hole in my shirt this could be

1524
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:56,760
you guys jaguns raise them onto four inch upholstery foam
you can add this for your butt you guys wouldn't like have

1525
02:08:56,760 --> 02:09:04,940
more ass add like these pads behind your butt i think once i
shave them down it's actually gonna be really thick i could

1526
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:16,160
be thick you guys can be thick too just gonna kind of go for
it and cut off all the edges until it looks very nice okay

1527
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:28,760
no more squats guys look holy look at that no more squats
but I think this is far too extreme even for Jessica Rabbit

1528
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:34,740
so the hips looked good but they were way too big for my
body shape so I'm doing take two this time with two inch

1529
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:41,560
foam last time I used four hips so this is what it looks
like with the corset I think it's a good shape I think it's

1530
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:45,500
still very without being as crazy

1531
02:09:48,980 --> 02:10:04,340
okay second one is definitely more natural second one is
definitely a lot more natural version one is it just me

1532
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:09,720
version one is Dexter's mom this is literally Dexter's mom
right there

1533
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,280
This is a Jessica Rabbit shoe.

1534
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:18,340
Now all that's left to do is make the booze.

1535
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:23,380
The stuffing bras and stuffing them with socks is an A cup.

1536
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:28,200
It may be a B cup, but I have very little chest to work with
in general.

1537
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:35,220
So for building my chest, I really am trying to like push
one another up and then build the rest out with padding.

1538
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:38,320
First up is just normal push-up bra that fits my size.

1539
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:39,740
This is from Victoria's Secret.

1540
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,900
As you can see, it's not a lot, but it's a little more.

1541
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:44,980
To make it a little bit more, And then she adds a second.

1542
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,100
Oh, wait, she puts pads in there?

1543
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:48,500
Starting to get a little more.

1544
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:50,160
It was time for bra number two.

1545
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:51,400
And then bra number two.

1546
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:53,160
How much does it send to it?

1547
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,640
Oh my God.

1548
02:10:55,380 --> 02:10:56,680
Is this how they do that?

1549
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:58,580
Holy shit.

1550
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:01,760
What do we want?

1551
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:02,600
Science.

1552
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:05,220
Damn.

1553
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:06,400
It's pretty big.

1554
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:07,340
That's all I got.

1555
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,500
Let's put on the hips.

1556
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:11,580
Magic.

1557
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:26,060
Living a fantasy Again, that is all foam and then all foam
the power of theirs Chat is this real?

1558
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:42,740
Why don't you find out yourself by four bras It go even
beyond the super shade She's like 40% foam Holy shit

1559
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:44,360
Alright, sponsored break.

1560
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:46,980
Okay, I need to like what the fuck?

1561
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:59,860
Okay, I also added boning to this lining layer The foam
stays on And with this chest Not gonna lie this is a lot

1562
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:08,100
more boobage than I thought I would be right guys This is so
crazy Bro, this is actually crazy It's okay if it looks like

1563
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:16,100
it's falling out because that's kind of how her boobs are
She went too far I kind of love it.

1564
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:17,180
I kind of love it.

1565
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:20,420
But now that we got the body, now that we got the dress, she
kind of loves it, guys.

1566
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:22,160
Okay, and yeah, like...

1567
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:23,560
So this is the sequence.

1568
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:24,560
What the hell?

1569
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:25,180
Look at this.

1570
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:26,940
What the fuck?

1571
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:28,980
This is the same person.

1572
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,680
The world is...

1573
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:33,360
This is the same person.

1574
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:41,140
That's actually crazy.

1575
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:43,360
She's so talented.

1576
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:45,240
That's a friend.

1577
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:56,700
entrap is this real she looks amazing oh my god this is the
channel by the way she deserves it i'm not subscribed

1578
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:09,800
because now i am it's because she says she rarely uploads
this is the reason why like whenever she does upload like it

1579
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:17,580
just pops up in my recommended whenever she does upload
Because it's so rare.

1580
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:20,600
Alright, wait wait, wait.

1581
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:21,360
Doll rifle.

1582
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:22,360
Not Doll rifle.

1583
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:23,240
I love Nerd Forge.

1584
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:24,540
I love Nerd Forge stuff.

1585
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:26,220
Nerd Forge stuff is like...

1586
02:13:26,220 --> 02:13:28,380
I love her builds.

1587
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:31,080
Um...

1588
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:32,120

02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:34,600

1591
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:37,660
What was it?

1592
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:39,260
Which one is my favorite one?

1593
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:43,720
I think my favorite one has to be like her PC builds.

1594
02:13:43,940 --> 02:13:44,400
When she turns...

1595
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,240
Oh yeah, she turns her PC.

1596
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:47,180
PS5 into a Dwarven Kingdom.

1597
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:48,160
Look at this.

1598
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:51,720
I'm Martina, and I have issues.

1599
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:55,580
I've been waiting for my PS5 to arrive, which it did after
months.

1600
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:59,700
But now, all I can think about is how normal it looks.

1601
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:01,780
And I've been wanting to do things to it.

1602
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:04,100
But I keep telling myself, Martina, there's no need.

1603
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:05,800
I mean, it looks perfectly fine.

1604
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,260
Here, let's do that.

1605
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:11,300
Okay, so, like, all she, she, like, obviously, foam is your
best friend.

1606
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:15,240
But it's actually crazy that she turned it into some
fucking...

1607
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:16,240
Dwarven Kingdom.

1608
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:17,920
I love NerdForge.

1609
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:19,480
I love the stuff she uploads.

1610
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:20,900
I'm not subscribed.

1611
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:21,620
Let me subscribe.

1612
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,260
I was subscribed, okay?

1613
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:29,560
Just not on this channel.

1614
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:32,160
Now I'm subscribed on this channel.

1615
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:40,160
I know it looks like I've done a lot here, but really all
I've done is just cut some stairs.

1616
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:42,040
Balsa, think of a tier one sub.

1744
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:24,440

crazy they used to like just repurpose old animatronics for

1745
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:33,840
this but like but I want to show you guys what's like wait
I'm trying to like show should we try it on holy shit that

1746
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:40,900
shit's so creepy imagine having that like as a kid
trick-or-treating imagine trick-or-treating as a kid and

1747
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:41,580
seeing this

1748
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:52,780
well the box works but the whole thing started to collapse
we fixed it we had to spread the legs out more and they need

1749
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:58,620
to be just want some candy angle because the pose is so
dynamic doesn't balance otherwise but it works and look we

1750
02:25:58,620 --> 02:26:10,760
can even push on it you know what though i hate to say it
that box expensive that's not diy i took off a whole lot of

1751
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:18,800
material and i don't even know if you can tell but there's a
that weird cat's back ma work on this for like three more

1752
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:25,020
days and probably still not be happy with it but at some
point you have to call it and it has to be done because we

1753
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:34,360
have to move on yeah oh my god the wire is coming out of the
eyes okay we're gonna i'm gonna zoom past guys to like its

1754
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:42,720
limits i know you guys really want to watch the diy part but
guys i want to see the finish piece if you want to watch the

1755
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:45,540
full video check it out i'm being a fake

1756
02:26:56,860 --> 02:27:04,940
holy shit i love how like they did the sun's effect where
like if you carve the eye deep enough you can make it so

1757
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:13,980
that i will like follow you around toky please five room and
this is what hangs off of his zipper pole we could just

1758
02:27:13,980 --> 02:27:21,300
paint it gold like it is in the game but i've always wanted
a reason to gold leaf something and it seems like super

1759
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:24,340
extravagant and ridiculous but only the best for our boy.

1760
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,420
I don't even know what gold leafing is.

1761
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:28,380
Well, it's like super thin.

1762
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:30,120
No, you're supposed to eat that.

1763
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:34,380
Oh my gosh, she's wasting precious gold leaf food.

1764
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:36,100
How would the rich eat?

1765
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:38,420
They can't eat food without the gold leaf.

1766
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,720
It's true.

1767
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:48,320
It's true.

1768
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:52,500
In order for rich people to eat, they eat the gold leaf on
top.

1769
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:56,420
The ritual style.

1770
02:27:59,100 --> 02:28:01,480
Oh my god, they use like the pool noodles.

1771
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:02,480
That's so smart.

1772
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:03,520
The pool noodles.

1773
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:07,680
Oh, the rib cage.

1774
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:11,380
It took me several hours, but I got all of the bad paint off
of the nails.

1775
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:12,940
And now I got this cool metallic paint.

1776
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:13,480
We're going to paint it.

1777
02:28:15,140 --> 02:28:17,640
In some ways, building Catnap has gone really well.

1778
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:22,460
We've learned so much since we started making animatronics
that we were able to combine it all into this insanely

1779
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:23,180
awesome build.

1780
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:27,260
But at the same time, this project has been the hardest
thing we've ever done.

1781
02:28:27,700 --> 02:28:29,320
The longest hours, the most setbacks, difficulty.

1782
02:28:29,320 --> 02:28:33,460
For only $3,000 a day, you can starve a...

1783
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:36,480
You can save a starving, rich man.

1784
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:37,640
That's how you get better.

1785
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:44,140
To animate Katnab's head, I'm using a huge servo because the
head is really heavy and we need a lot of torque.

1786
02:28:44,420 --> 02:28:48,040
A servo is different than a wiper motor because I can tell
it exactly how to move.

1787
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:53,800
To do that, I'm using this free software called Botango
which is used to animate animatronics instead of writing

1788
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:59,240
code i can just animate in a timeline it's super fun anytime
i want i can just make a new animation for catnap and then

1789
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:05,560
when it's ready we export it to the arduino y'all we just
did a test run i can't wait for you to see him in action but

1790
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:10,820
before we do we just want to say oh my god i don't like that
channel and helping us grow this is makes me uncomfortable

1791
02:29:10,820 --> 02:29:18,200
just sitting next to it as if like he's friend that's so
creepy

1792
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:44,190
I want one for my six-year-old nephew

1793
02:29:48,350 --> 02:29:56,290
Oh god when it's like nighttime too It's so cool though
They've done like they've actually repurposed like uh

1794
02:29:56,290 --> 02:30:03,610
They've actually done like repurposing um Like Halloween
decorations too Wait, let me show you guys.

1795
02:30:07,090 --> 02:30:08,630
Like the spider one.

1796
02:30:09,810 --> 02:30:11,530
Like, they made that.

1797
02:30:11,870 --> 02:30:13,110
And I'm going to skip to the end.

1798
02:30:13,430 --> 02:30:14,910
We've made a 12-foot spider.

1799
02:30:15,070 --> 02:30:16,210
We've made a Minecraft spider.

1800
02:30:17,130 --> 02:30:21,330
Like, they've repurposed that and turned it into this, which
is insane.

1801
02:30:21,890 --> 02:30:22,870
It's actually crazy.

1802
02:30:23,130 --> 02:30:28,970
They repurposed, like, old Halloween decorations to make,
like, actual cool shit.

1803
02:30:34,230 --> 02:30:35,110
But I want to watch.

1804
02:30:35,130 --> 02:30:36,810
Then watch the channel!

1805
02:30:37,470 --> 02:30:38,470
Wicked Maker!

1806
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:42,230
I'm just showing you an example!

1807
02:30:43,410 --> 02:30:45,710
I've seen this video already!

1808
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:50,410
There's no reaction because I've seen it!

1809
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:56,070
Toki keeps skipping to the end.

1810
02:30:56,470 --> 02:30:57,450
Like, look at that.

1811
02:30:57,510 --> 02:30:58,430
That's so cool.

1812
02:31:02,340 --> 02:31:04,540
I'm showing my favorite...

1813
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:06,760
Guys, it's not you show me...

1814
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:16,380
favorite it's me showing you my favorite channels on
reactive streamer you take that back it's like i'm showing

1815
02:31:16,380 --> 02:31:23,900
you my mixtape but instead i'm showing you my favorite
videos there's actually one where they made like last of us

1816
02:31:23,900 --> 02:31:31,560
props too um i'll show you the short because i can let's
turn the spirit halloween oh my gosh okay the last of us one

1817
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:39,760
was really creepy uh i remember watching their last of us
one uh light videos here.

1818
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:43,940
Let's turn this spirit Halloween animatronic into a clicker
from the last of us.

1819
02:31:44,380 --> 02:31:49,600
A giant mushroom bloom has burst out of the clicker's skull
so first we're gonna cut a big old hole in his face where we

1820
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:50,820
want the mushroom to bloom out.

1821
02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:54,360
To make the mushrooms we'll cut a bunch of flowery looking
shapes out of EVA foam.

1822
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:59,480
We use a heat gun to bend and shape the pieces and then
sculpt on top of them with foam clay to bulk them out and

1823
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:00,340
give them some texture.

1824
02:32:00,800 --> 02:32:00,800
Blah!

1825
02:32:01,400 --> 02:32:06,080
If you look at the clickers in the show they're really
colorful to contrast with a bleak environment.

1826
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:11,180
To match that look, we airbrushed on some really bright
colors and then gave it a brown wash to make it look more

1827
02:32:11,180 --> 02:32:11,580
organic.

1828
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:14,920
While I was painting, Jay tweaked the animatronic to give it
a more scary animation.

1829
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:19,900
It's really cool because the one is the crafter and the
other one's the engineer with the electronics, which is

1830
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:22,020
really cool that they're working together for this.

1831
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:24,400
We'll fill any gaps with foam clay and then add lots of
details.

1832
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:28,580
I show you my mixing, but skip until the end of the song.

1833
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:33,120
I just skip to where the drop is.

1834
02:32:35,080 --> 02:32:36,980
Like, holy shit, that's so cool.

1835
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:38,480
Oh, the Wicked Makers from our...

1836
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:39,820
That's so cool.

1837
02:32:40,220 --> 02:32:41,480
I just skipped to the drop.

1838
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:48,120
Yeah, they made, like...

1839
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:50,600
They've done, like, a lot of stuff, which is really cool.

1840
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:52,020
That's why I love their channel as well.

1841
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:54,480
Because they do, like, a lot of, like...

1842
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:59,220
They repurpose, like, Halloween stuff into, like, actual
cool Halloween decorations.

1843
02:33:00,360 --> 02:33:01,840
I mean, there's, like, stuff...

1844
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:02,100
Okay.

1845
02:33:02,660 --> 02:33:05,040
Like, because, like, I don't want to go outside.

1846
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:12,240
So instead of going outside, and like, I don't like roller
coasters and like animatronics, but I love watching like,

1847
02:33:12,940 --> 02:33:14,940
um, people filming attractions.

1848
02:33:15,580 --> 02:33:18,600
So like, I don't know, if you guys know, like attractions
360.

1849
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:25,120
So like, instead of like actually riding the attractions, I
just watch videos of people.

1850
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:32,860
I just watch videos of like other people like showing what's
in the ride.

1851
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:34,880
So I don't have to go on the ride.

1852
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:38,860
Like...

1853
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:40,360
I live...

1854
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:40,580
Like...

1855
02:33:40,580 --> 02:33:41,860
That's not sad!

1856
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:43,160
I just don't like...

1857
02:33:43,160 --> 02:33:45,080
I don't like animatronics!

1858
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:46,320
IRL!

1859
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:47,020
I like...

1860
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:49,140
Okay, I like how I said I don't like animatronics.

1861
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:53,140
I don't like animatronics, but I love watching people make
animatronics.

1862
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:55,640
Because I find it really interesting.

1863
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:56,560
But I don't like them.

1864
02:33:56,680 --> 02:33:57,080
IRL.

1865
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:57,980
Like I think it's like...

1866
02:33:57,980 --> 02:33:59,120
I'm always like really scared.

1867
02:33:59,140 --> 02:34:00,640
I was like, ooh, what if it touches me?

1868
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:03,780
Like, like it just scares the shit out of me.

1869
02:34:03,980 --> 02:34:05,120
So I like watching...

1870
02:34:05,140 --> 02:34:13,040
experiencing it through video because i'm not actually there
like usually when i do ride because i'll give you an example

1871
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:23,560
i wrote that harry potter one um from like what is it the oh
my god the fucking dementors ride or whatever and then like

1872
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:31,420
i closed my eyes the entire time during universal like you
know the universal rides i closed my eyes and then i just i

1873
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:38,120
i just i just don't experience it and then like the demented
ride and then and then i remember like one of my friends was

1874
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:45,360
like open your eyes oh my god this is the cool part open
your eyes i was like no and then i just rode the entire ride

1875
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:52,980
just closing my eyes like i didn't even open my eyes so then
i was like i was like oh shit what was in there like you

1876
02:34:52,980 --> 02:35:02,280
know it's not like i was super young or anything I think
like I was like like like first year of university or

1877
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:09,180
something it's like first year of university and and the and
it's like and then they're like open your eyes you gotta see

1878
02:35:09,180 --> 02:35:15,420
this this shit do I see this part and then I just closed my
eyes throughout the ride so never actually like saw what

1879
02:35:15,420 --> 02:35:32,140
anything happened I felt it I felt like I I I felt the ride
like felt the wind and i didn't i don't know i don't know

1880
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:39,580
what it was visually what it was so i just like looked up on
youtube what the ride was like and i was like oh hey thank

1881
02:35:39,580 --> 02:35:49,600

didn't think fucking guy but i love like watching videos of

1882

like oh did you guys see the new adam okay guys spoiler
alert if you guys the new like universal Jurassic Park ride

1883
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:00,260
I'll never ride on it, but...

1884
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:08,640
It's the one... This one's like in Beijing, right?

1885
02:36:08,980 --> 02:36:09,980
The Universal Studios?

1886
02:36:10,480 --> 02:36:12,500
I'll never ride on it, but it looks so cool.

1887
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:15,020
The Jurassic Road.

1888
02:36:19,470 --> 02:36:20,350
Yeah, it's in Beijing.

1889
02:36:21,570 --> 02:36:23,510
It's so cool because it's apparently...

1890
02:36:25,590 --> 02:36:26,190
uh...

1891
02:36:26,190 --> 02:36:29,750
It's apparently like the the dinosaur chases you too.

1892
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:38,790
I love looking at the also like I like looking at the queue
the the what is it called you know when you're in queue and

1893
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:46,630
they have like all these like decorations in queue there's
like a special name for it what is it called because like

1894
02:36:46,630 --> 02:36:55,110
sometimes I always I do like the lightning rat the lightning
ticket so you can skip you can skip the line so you skip the

1895
02:36:55,110 --> 02:37:05,430
line you don't get to watch all the the the the decorations
from the queue system so that's what I like to look at too

1896
02:37:05,430 --> 02:37:14,850
because I get and also you get to like absorb it instead of
like being rushed in the queue it's so cool the pre-show

1897
02:37:14,850 --> 02:37:20,610
yeah yeah yeah yeah if you have the lightning ticket you
tend to skip all the pre-show and then you also have to like

1898
02:37:20,610 --> 02:37:27,650
you know you have to walk really fast during the pre-show
because you know you want to get on the line oh my god it's

1899
02:37:27,650 --> 02:37:33,550
like we're there guys it's like we're riding on the
attraction right now oh my god yeah you get to absorb the

1900
02:37:33,550 --> 02:37:43,610
lore of your video it's like we're there holy shit it's so
immersive guys it's like we're just like we're there hands

1901
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:45,130
in the air guys

1902
02:37:54,530 --> 02:37:56,450
We're here right now!

1903
02:37:56,610 --> 02:37:57,870
We're in Beijing!

1904
02:38:02,450 --> 02:38:03,850
This is sad!

1905
02:38:04,190 --> 02:38:05,390
What do you mean?

1906
02:38:18,310 --> 02:38:19,010
It's so cool.

1907
02:38:19,110 --> 02:38:21,470
When it starts chasing you, it's actually so freaky.

1908
02:38:24,730 --> 02:38:28,890
So I think it starts, I would never ride this.

1909
02:38:28,970 --> 02:38:33,510
I would never I would never ride this

1910
02:38:46,550 --> 02:38:53,250
It looks really cool though like it looks so immersive
Really it seems pretty cool.

1911
02:38:53,450 --> 02:38:55,030
Yes, but like what if it touches me?

1912
02:38:55,750 --> 02:39:02,530
Like that's like I just like my irrational fear of like what
if it just touches me These

1913
02:39:07,740 --> 02:39:17,260
dogs look so cool

1914
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:28,540
Like, look, it starts moving!

1915
02:39:29,480 --> 02:39:32,020
Holy shit, that's so fucking scary!

1916
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,360
It just starts chasing you!

1917
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:38,580
Holy fuck!

1918
02:39:41,780 --> 02:39:43,720
Bro, even the car moves!

1919
02:39:45,720 --> 02:39:50,720
Because, like, you think they don't chase you, you know,
like, I don't try, they don't move, but then it moves!

1920
02:40:07,720 --> 02:40:18,640
okay then this is just like um i hate the i'm not a huge fan
of the uh the screens i wish like i wish they use less

1921
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:25,400
screens that's the my only issue i hate how like amusement
park rides use a lot of screens now oh my god there's a

1922
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:38,360
t-rex i hate the imex imax segments in like any animatronic
in any like amusement park ride It just doesn't feel right.

1923
02:40:44,060 --> 02:40:45,500
I thought they were going to kiss.

1924
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:48,080
Just like Godzilla and King Kong.

1925
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:57,420
I love like the whole debate on why is she running with high
heels.

1926
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,280
Oh my god, there's Ted.

1927
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:07,420
Meshit.

1928
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:08,660
Meshit.

1929
02:41:09,320 --> 02:41:09,940
Meshit.

1930
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,520
I want to go to university.

1931
02:41:15,340 --> 02:41:16,920
studios in Beijing.

1932
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:18,180
It looks so cool.

1933
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:23,980
You guys see the new like Zootopia land in the universe.

1934
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:24,580
Not universe.

1935
02:41:24,920 --> 02:41:25,400
Disney.

1936
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:30,520
Soon Disney will buy Universal.

1937
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:36,200
He's just leaping chat.

1938
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:41,360
So cool though.

1939
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:44,420
Let's see.

1940
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:45,320
Yeah, there's a new Zootopia.

1941
02:41:45,340 --> 02:41:56,540
utopia land in disneyland in shanghai uh i swear like the
animatronics there looks like so much to be fair i think

1942
02:41:56,540 --> 02:42:03,960
it's also because like universal and the universal land in
disneyland in like shanghai and beijing are more like are

1943
02:42:03,960 --> 02:42:10,040
newer builds so they use like newer animatronics and stuff
and it's like obviously since it's newer built the

1944
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:18,820
technology is more high tech and the disneyland and
universals and americas are like fucking old as hell so it's

1945
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:33,580
like super dated so like all like all the newer amusement
parks have all the cutting edge technology even like the

1946
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:43,540
apparently so like oh doggy mug purchased jay thank you for
the 5000 videos thank you thank you even like okay so you is

1947
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:51,940
it like uh america disneyland has the frozen ride right so
america disneyland has the frozen ride and then uh hong kong

1948
02:42:51,940 --> 02:43:00,540
disneyland has like the same frozen ride but the
animatronics are better than uh then like america's

1949
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:07,740
disneyland because it's using the newer animatronics where
it's not using the the the what was it the 2d faces where

1950
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:13,400
like they use like the projected faces in america because
that was the old animatronics the newer animatronics

1951
02:43:13,400 --> 02:43:21,500
actually uses like uh molded faces for like the frozen let
me see if i can find it it's actually crazy hong kong

1952
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:34,060
disneyland uh frozen versus america anyone oh there's i want
to know if anyone made like a comparison video oh here you

1953
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:44,300
go here you go this is like he did it here you go you can
tell the difference it's actually crazy well Disney did it

1954
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:50,160
they gave the Elsa animatronic a new face this is actually
new footage Disney released for Frozen Ever After this is

1955
02:43:50,160 --> 02:43:54,640
Hong Kong Disney Land animatronic it's definitely a major
upgrade from that projected face like look

1956
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:12,260
this is America this is Hong Kong she came out of Star Trek
this is the animatronic I mean because like Hong Kong

1957
02:44:12,260 --> 02:44:21,180
Disneyland released a new frozen land the comparison between
the two no fair it's because America I swear I think like

1958
02:44:21,180 --> 02:44:28,640
America Disneyland America Disneyland so Disney World is
like the beta test and then after like beta test is over

1959
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:30,340
they're like alright let's export this

1960
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:42,640
so bad both figures are programmed with the exact same
movements and if you look closely the new animatronic's face

1961
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:48,200
matches the exact animation of the projected facial
expressions and it works even better in my opinion yeah it

1962
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:49,500
does this is perfect

1963
02:44:53,340 --> 02:45:05,400
someone helping oh my god um but i feel like disney the
disney lands in the like universal studios outside of

1964
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:12,460
america are a lot better is better, I feel like, because
it's newer.

1965
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:15,080
Technology is, like, newer, too.

1966
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:16,420
Oh, and then, like, when...

1967
02:45:16,420 --> 02:45:17,940
Okay, it's so freaky.

1968
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:18,640
Okay, wait, wait.

1969
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:24,780
When, like, because they're using projective faces, and
because they're using projective faces, it breaks down.

1970
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:25,280
Okay, wait.

1971
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:28,780
Elsa animatronic malfunction.

1972
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:34,000
And it's just a black screen, and it's so weird.

1973
02:45:34,100 --> 02:45:35,560
It's so scary.

1974
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:38,940
It's actually really scary.

1975
02:45:39,380 --> 02:45:40,220
