00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,090
Sorry, I forgot about the time.

3
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,370
The time fucking messed me up.

Oh, my God.

5
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,950

Sorry, everybody.

7
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,350
I had to do some work stuff.

8
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,050
And I looked at the clock.

9
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,910
I was like, oh, my God, it's fine.

10
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,290
I was like, I don't have anything set up.

11
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:28,870
down and i'm busy i was like okay i can get this done and
then i was like i'm like looking at time like oh wait it's

12
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:39,790
streaming time it's it's streaming did i finish the work the
thing is i'm never done with work i'm always working no but

13
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:52,270
today is like particularly uh stressful because like um I
might have I have received some concepts for my new uh for

14
00:03:52,270 --> 00:04:01,230
my new skin suit and I was like working on like trying to
figure out if like if it looks okay like I was editing it

15
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:13,350
and stuff so I was like editing my new skin suit uh and I
was like with my tailor with my skin suit Taylor and I was

16
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,390
like editing it and editing it I was like oh that's will
this look good.

17
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:31,190
I was so stressed out I was so stressed out because I was
like oh my god I hope the dragon will like this sounds like

18
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,810
what if they don't like it?

19
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,510
What if my fucking taste sucks?

20
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,610
What if I'm fucking terrible at like what makes a good skin
suit?

21
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:47,170
like oh and I was like stressing it out and I was sending it
somebody I was like which one do you like the original skin

22
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:53,630
suit design or like uh or like what I did and then they said
the original's like what's the point and then I had like a

23
00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:03,570
mini breakdown and I was like what's the point I wasted so
many hours editing this and trying to figure out what I want

24
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:13,350
and then people still like the original more what's the
point I was like having a mini breakdown And I was like,

25
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,090
what if I just have bad taste?

26
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:26,150
And I'm just like, oh my God, I just fucking be a tomato.

27
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,750
I don't care.

28
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,790
I used to, I was so stressed out.

29
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,130
Cause I was like, this skin suit is forever.

30
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:43,190
I can't just, I can't just take off the skin suit, but I'm
like, oh my God, This is technically going to be, like, my

31
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,670
new man look forever.

32
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,410
What if I hate it?

33
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,390
What if I hate it, but everybody else loves it?

34
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,050
What if everybody else hates what I think is looks cool?

35
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,990
What if I'm like, this looks so cool.

36
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,990
And everybody else would be like, this sucks.

37
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,010
I'm like, no.

38
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:11,070
So, like, so that's why I've been, like, going through the
past two, okay, the past, like, two weeks.

39
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:21,950
This is what I've been going through Like, but like, the
past two hours was me like Like fucking freaking out and

40
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:30,130
trying to figure out Like what looks good And I'm like, I
was like, this has to look good This has to look like me, my

41
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:38,250
personality Everything I like, my personality And like, it
still has to be unique, but not too complicated Because I

42
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:48,950
don't like it when it's too cluttered or too much It has to
be like easy to cosplay, but not too easy to cosplay Has to

43
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:57,970
look good on merch it has to tell a story and I'm like I
hate this I hate I hate trying to fucking figure this out

44
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,950
I was just like no

45
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:17,250
I guess I'm just it's been a mess It has to be recognizable
with a unique silhouette, but also not too unique because

46
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,390
you don't want it to be too messy and too cluttered.

47
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,550
But also you want to look nice.

48
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,090
You want it just to look nice and be like that's a nice
recognizable design.

49
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,770
And then I'm like, I hate this.

50
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,510
And I'm like editing it and stuff.

51
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,290
I was like, okay, this is like so many ideas I have to make
it look better.

52
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:51,850
better as a skin suit and everything and and then i sent it
to a friend and i was like what do you think which one one

53
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:57,950
or two one being the original two being my edit and they're
like one i'm like what's the point

54
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:08,010
i spend an hour and a half editing this what's the point

55
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:18,650
And like, if you think like that, then what if, what if the
dragoons don't like it either?

56
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:30,750
And so, so that's what, um, so yeah, I've, uh, I've, I had a
mini breakdown.

57
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:39,090
I'm, I'm, I'm, I've had a mini breakdown and I, I spent like
the last 15 minutes getting myself together.

58
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,830
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

59
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,270
It's your skin, so you should focus on making it comfortable
for you.

60
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,890
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

61
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,450
But what about the branding?

62
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,440
But what about the branding?

63
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,420
It needs to have good branding.

64
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,540
So it's so painful.

65
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,440
I wish I can just like hire somebody to do that.

66
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:26,160
do this but then like oh my god it's so it's so painful but
like technically i did but it's just like oh there's so much

67
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:36,140

gonna lie streaming has actually been like my own my my only

68
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:47,880

Anyway, today, sorry, I had to go through that little rant

74
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,340
Little rant today because, holy fuck it.

75
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,160
I've been, like, really stressed out since waking up.

The brand is Dokeybird.

79
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,860
There's no question about that.

80
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,000

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,860
Yeah!

85
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:52,720
I don't know if this game has a like when i opened it up um
like uh when i opened it up it gave me this it's like not

86
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,060
full screen and i i was like whoa it's so tiny

87
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,480
oh it does okay because i was wondering if we were we should
we should watch this intro

88
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,820
I love the artwork so pretty in this game.

89
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,760
I know like the music and I actually, okay, let's see.

90
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,960
Graphic settings, there we go.

91
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,800
Oh, there we go.

92
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,080
Can I, oh, there we go.

93
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,440
Flow screen.

94
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,120
Oh, you have flow screen.

95
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
I don't know the volume.

96
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,440
So, okay, let me turn it.

97
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:52,860
down a little maybe i don't know guys i hope the volume's
okay chat um but yeah i'm super excited to finally play hog

98
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:01,340
here it's been a game that i've been wanting to play for a
very very long time i heard it's like really addicting and

99
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:13,740
um the the biggest crime is that this game is free like this
game i know like um because this is like passion project so

100
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:23,880
i i know like why it's free uh and it's actually crazy that
this game is free because um i was reading the reviews and

101
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,380
uh and like a lot of people are like oh i don't really know
much about hololive but like this is a naturally really fun

102
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,460
game like i don't know like the the i don't know like the
story behind this or i don't know like how to like i don't

103
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,380
know the lore behind this but it's a really fun it's a
really fun game and the fact that the creator wouldn't even

104
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:50,400
was like refused to like accept donations or anything or be
paid for this is actually um like insane because like bro

105
00:12:50,400 --> 00:13:00,960
you deserve money for making this game like holy shit uh i'm
getting rid of screen shake because i've always hated screen

106
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:08,180
shake uh but yeah how's the volume chat i'm worried it might
be too loud um uh my sound guy has been like uh some stuff

107
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:17,740
has came out for my sound guy so like i will have to rely on
you guys to help me with the volume control a bit loud okay

108
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,540
let me turn it down a little bit then uh let's see i'll it
down a little bit.

109
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,780
No, I'm thinking of the Super Chat.

110
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,080
Thank you.

111
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,740
Thank you.

112
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Thank you.

113
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,960
Oh, wait, Sound Guy's here!

114
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,600
Okay, let's see.

115
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,420
Turning it down.

116
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,200
Sound Guy!

117
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,120
I hope everything's okay with you!

118
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,600
But yay!

119
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,800
Sound Guy's here!

120
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,740
Okay, let me see.

121
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,020
Turn it down, the music, a little bit more.

122
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,860
Okay, let's see.

123
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,900
Where is the music?

124
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,680
I love my favorite time.

125
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,980
My... Oh, wait.

126
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,660
I love... My favorite time is sound control.

127
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,680
Yippee!

128
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,420
Sound Guy!

129
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,960
Alright, turn down the music little bit um but yeah but i
understand though because like uh what i really admire is

130
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:06,220
the whole they said uh how i set up this whole like hollow
indie thing which is providing like funding and support to

131
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:15,500
uh indie developers which is um really admirable but i know
like the creator of holocure uh is not in there because they

132
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,880
wanted to like still keep up this passion project and stuff
so um which is understandable because the thing about

133
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:29,020
passion projects is that you have the control of your vision
and everything so like you know like corporate like you know

134
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,040
you don't have to answer to something higher up to you
regarding changes or things or like you want to edit some

135
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,100
things to fit more of what the people in the higher higher
ups would want for it so it's understandable why this kept

136
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:51,440
was free and also not part of the hollow indie um the hollow
indie wants to do is reflecting on what the fans want and

137
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,220
what he his vision is so that's like really understandable
and it's like really honorable the thing to do and um and

138
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,920
yeah you don't have to listen to like what like you know not
just like uh man what management wants but also like other

139
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,940
people um other people that are funding the company and
stuff like that so um it actually is like because like you

140
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,320
know what if like they want to remove something or if they
want to add something that might not be from the vision of

141
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,680
the original creator So that's why it's understandable why
this is still a passion project and the fact that they're

142
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:32,440
doing all of this due to their passion for this company and
the passion for like the individuals who are part of like

143
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,020
Hall of Live, like the talents and everything.

144
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,180
It is very, you know, like the passion of the fans is very
admirable and everything.

145
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,780
But yes, I've always wanted to play this game.

146
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,260
Everybody makes it look so fun.

147
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,380
I like watched a couple of streams of people playing this.

148
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:57,420
and it's very similar to a vampire survivors which is why I
was really interested in this because I've seen people play

149
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:08,840
vampire survivors whenever and then I've only played vampire
survivors once among us edition so that's why I wanted to

150
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:18,280
play this for a while now and it seems like an incredibly
addicting game and the fact that it still gets updates too

151
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
Alright, what's meta?

152
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,940
I just love you guys You're like, no, pick the character
That you enjoyed, pick the talent That you enjoy the most

153
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,000
No, as a gamer It is called Pick the character that's meta

154
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,330
It's all about winning

155
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,210
I need to know What is meta?

156
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:58,670
Right now, out of the five talents that are here, who is the
most meta to start out?

157
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,650
Right now is Mori.

158
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,110
Swing's in half circle arc in the front.

159
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,250
Stage mode.

160
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,030
Okay, defeat the last boss to complete.

161
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,510
Well, obviously, I haven't really unlocked anything yet.

162
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,450
So, I guess I'll do the stage mode.

163
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,910
Okay, it's like the beginning level of Vampire Survivors.

164
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,870
All right, go.

165
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,770
Okay, WAC, left click to toggle or right click to aim.

166
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,150
What, left click to toggle.

167
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,430
Oh, what can I aim here?

168
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,350
What do I aim?

169
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,910
Where does the aim part come from?

170
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,930
I guess if I have, like, a special ability?

171
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,330
Question mark?

172
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,810
Use a controller?

173
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,610
No!

174
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,530
Am I K4EVA!

175
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,390
All right, nice.

176
00:17:50,150 --> 00:18:00,410
where where you aim your attack but i can just move around i
just move around for that all right give me that box your

177
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:07,710
main weapon can be adjusted oh okay but at the moment i
don't think i have anything all right 15 chance to negate

178
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:18,310
one hit uh uh when defeating a target you need to lock it
you can strafe while attacking right click game you can

179
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,270
strafe holy shit this is much more complicated than I
thought.

180
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,510
What the fuck?

181
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,690
Okay, increased damage.

182
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,150
Oh my god, I'm so confused.

183
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,310
Oh my god.

184
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,130
Who would have thought?

185
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,270
This game was much more confusing.

186
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,230
Much more complicated than I expected.

187
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,150
Oh my gosh, I remember when I watched Maureen's debut.

188
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,130
I like, I think I live tweeted it.

189
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,570
too.

190
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,810
I'm pretty

191
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:05,290
I'm pretty sure I live tweeted Mori's debut and she like,
uh, let's see when like Myth First came out.

192
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,430
Uh, we maxed out the Scythe, right?

193
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:09,590
Who?

194
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,410
Okay, guys.

195
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,370
I already took one damage because I was fucking around too
much.

196
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,570
It's okay.

197
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,370
I have experience.

198
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,230
I played Among Us Vampire Survivors.

199
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,130
It's fine.

200
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,630
Okay, apparently in the meta is to max up the scythe.

201
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,590
I gotta kill the deadbeats first.

202
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,570
It's okay, they enjoy it.

203
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,870
I mean, they're technically dead already, so is it really
killing them?

204
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,410
Alright, max up the scythe.

205
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:35,590
Boop.

206
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,030
Oh, this is not good.

207
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,410
This is not good.

208
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,950
This is definitely not good.

209
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,430
Oh, okay.

210
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,570
That was just a bait.

211
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,530
It's just bait.

212
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,130
I mean, since you're dead already, it doesn't really...

213
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:57,230
matter that we kill them again because technically they're
dead so they just come back to life oh do they have orbs

214
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:06,350
here too reduce the time between attacks wait four yeah
we're saving them oh you're right we're saving them by

215
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:18,750
killing them exactly uh one or three all healing is doubled
four okay four it's okay I let my chat tell me what to do

216
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,990
because I can't think for myself

217
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:32,470
This is for your own good Do not worry This is for your own
good Alright, 1 We're gonna max it out still Holy shit I'm

218
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,690
so fucking strong now

219
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:44,850
I think it's like The fact that like all this Like hololive
fans came together to make this Because it's a huge team too

220
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:55,470
That made this game Like that was nothing I got scammed like
the art the music the gameplay being more calm there's like

221
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:09,370
a home decorating thing there's fishing there's fucking
fishing wait is it three wait is this the max this is the

222
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,010
max right

223
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:22,550
oh my god that's a big guy that's a big shrimp oh no no no
no no No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

224
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,270
Don't worry.

225
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:23,850
Thread the needle.

226
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,650
Okay, don't worry.

227
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:27,850
We can kill him.

228
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,550
Can't be that bad.

229
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,690
Wait, what is, is that the boss?

230
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,270
The mini boss where he gives you a chest?

231
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,490
I don't know what the hololive equivalent is.

232
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,570
Oh my god, he's so tanky.

233
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,110
He's so fucking tanky.

234
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,710
All right, we maxed out the scyth.

235
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,770
Her Cali headphones are a good choice because she has a
small dead spot in her scyth swing.

236
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,210
When you unlock specials, Callie can do big damage easily.

237
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,250
Thank you, Super Chat, Richie.

238
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,050
Thank you, thank you.

239
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:56,910
One?

240
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,070
Increase attack by two.

241
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,630
Okay, one.

242
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,010
All right.

243
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,130
I got this too.

244
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,330
Hollow's on.

245
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,870
What did I get?

246
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:09,770
What?

247
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,130
Oh, BL book.

248
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,990
Repel's target with orbiting BL books.

249
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,870
What is...

250
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,730
Black licorice?

251
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,790
Black licorice?

252
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,970
Wait, BL stands for black licorice, right?

253
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,690
Right, guys?

254
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,650
What else would it stand for?

255
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,470
Yowie?

256
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,390
That's a Y.

257
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,250
That's not Yowie.

258
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,390
That starts with a Y.

259
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,130
One, two, three, or four.

260
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,470

Thank you, thank you.

264
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:46,870
Who?

265
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:55,370
30% chance to life steal 2 HP if taking a hit while HP is
less than 15% chance.

266
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,190
Oh, God.

267
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,070
Oh, God.

268
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,250
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

269
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,970
Just gotta get rid of these guys here.

270
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,410
Just keep going, right?

271
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,190
It's okay, I'm gaming.

272
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:03,910
Look at that.

273
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,550
I played Vampire Survivors.

274
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,870
It's okay.

275
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,930
I played Among Us Vampire Survivors.

276
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,930
I know what I'm doing.

277
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,750
It is pretty easy.

278
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:26,110
All right, for each target, defeated I'm gaming I already I
already know the strat okay turn down music one more notch

279
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:31,750
okay sound guy wants me to turn down music one more uh all
healing is double one for each target defeated increase

280
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:42,070
attack okay I'm gonna do attack we're gonna be like uh we're
gonna be like a glass cannon I can't die if I kill everybody

281
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:49,650
first what is these okay sound guy said the music It's just
a little bit too loud, so I turn it down a little bit.

282
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,730
But if it's now too quiet, let me know.

283
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,270
One or two.

284
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,170
Okay.

285
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,910
When do things get harder?

286
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,830
Oh, big taco!

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:13,630
Okay, I never told this to anyone, but now, I mean, I can
post it now, tweet it out now, but I actually have a...

289
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,190

I don't want things to get a little bit harder, guys.

292
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,830
I'm happy with the current difficulty.

293
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,870
I don't need things to be a little bit harder.

294
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,630
But I actually...

295
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:35,930

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,910

We're fine.

385
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,650
We thread the needle.

386
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,690
Okay, I got a little bit distracted there, but we thread the
needle.

387
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,550
I'm full HP!

388
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,890
This is so fucking easy!

389
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:21,950
That's right.

390
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,970
That's why I put my name in here, Doki FPS.

391
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,090

00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,690
Let's see.

397
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,290
Reach, target.

398
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,570
Why do I even need to read this?

399
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,770
I can just let you guys read this for me.

400
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,490
Those headphones are saving you.

401
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,410
No, I'm saving.

402
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,750
I'm saving the world.

403
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,210
Three, two, one.

404
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,450
Okay, targets one take.

405
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,190
15%.

406
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,410
One for each target.

407
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,610
I see more threes.

408
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,910
Okay, I see more threes.

409
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:56,710
Open.

410
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,650
Open time.

411
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,930
Let's see.

412
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,050
All healing is doubled.

413
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:03,890
I'll take it.

414
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,290
I don't need a thing.

415
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,570
Oh, I got leveled up again.

416
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:07,790
Uber sheep.

417
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,490
Increased movement speed.

418
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:09,930
One.

419
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,690
Increases attack size.

420
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,390
One- I like how someone was like One, two, three, four.

421
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,390
Thank you.

422
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:21,450
Very helpful.

423
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:22,630
Okay.

424
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:23,510
Nope.

425
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,470
No, no, no, no, no, no.

426
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,170
Oh, it's fine.

427
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:25,530
It's fine.

428
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:25,990
We're okay.

429
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,010
We just luckily got help by defeating people.

430
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,030
We're fine.

431
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,330
Everything's fine.

432
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,650
I need to, like, grab some more.

433
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,310
Go.

434
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,210
Nope.

435
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,030
Nope.

436
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,510
Get out.

437
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,030
Back out.

438
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,710
Back out.

439
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,910
What's the lore, anyway?

440
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,690
Why are the fans?

441
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,050
I didn't.

442
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:54,810
and read the beginning pick a five back to thank you for the
akasupa thank you thank you um let's see one increase stamp

443
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:07,670
five two okay one i see more ones i i know like we all saw
the intro but what is the lore the fans went crazy and we

444
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:14,650
must save them because what's better than being um than
being dead.

445
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,010
Oh my god.

446
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,330
Don't worry, fans!

447
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,150
It's okay, because Mori's a grim reaper, so she can bring
them back to life.

448
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,750
Because she controls life and death.

449
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,730
Holocure cures the...

450
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,150
Oh my god, that's a big deadbeat.

451
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,410
Get over here.

452
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,390
Get over here.

453
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,330
That's not afraid of you.

454
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,810
Oh my god, he has a bat.

455
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,590
That's, why don't they just get a gun?

456
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,030
We need, we need a fan mascot who just holds a gun.

457
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,250
But I think that might get, you might actually get, like, I
don't think that's, like, good for merch, though.

458
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,270
Wait, they do get guns?

459
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,030
Wait a minute.

460
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.

461
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,710

We're fine.

463
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:07,650
We're fine.

464
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,370
We're, we're threading Danita.

465
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,970
We're threading Danita.

466
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,830
Wait, they do have guns?

467
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:18,470
All right.

468
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,710
Let's see.

469
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,650

512
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,750
Okay, see more twos.

Oh, and then we have more.

Oh my god.

515
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,810
I'm looking like crazy.

516
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,030
Am I doing well for my first run?

517
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,010
Or am I...

518
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,010
I can't tell.

519
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,950
I can't tell if I'm doing well for my first run.

520
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,670
Or if it's just like that.

521
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,950
Three or so far.

522
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,870

They have a shield.

We're halfway!

554
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,870
We don't like to lie.

555
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,150
What do you mean?

556
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:37,930

00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,910
Man, I sure do love black licorice.

560
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,450
Because what else would BL stand for?

561
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,110
Uh, oh, we can max it out.

562
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,630

Thank you, thank you.

565
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,050
Your micro could be better.

566
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,770
Callie is carrying you.

567
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,370
Look.

568
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,350
I'm just playing meta.

569
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,970
There's nothing wrong.

570
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,250
We're playing meta.

571
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,510
Whoa, what's this?

572
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,010
What is this?

573
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,730
Combo.

574
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,490
What does this do?

575
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,710
Is this good?

576
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,710

know if you guys know what that means but it's like when a

578
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:47,130
when two black licorices love each other very much um you
you try to eat two at the same time that's what it means

you for the magenta soup, but thank you, thank you.

580
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,890
Don't know you notice, but items I have a star belong to
that specific talent.

581
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,330
So you can grab them, upgrade them, while worrying about
them taking up a weapon slot.

582
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,930
Oh, that's really interesting.

583
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,970
Thank you, the super chat.

584
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,650

One.

586
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,290
Oh, so this doesn't take my weapon slot because I'm Callie.

587
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:11,590
All right.

588
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:12,830
Thank you, guys.

Oh, my God.

591
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,530
I can just stand still.

592
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,610
I don't even know where my weapon is anymore.

593
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,690
I can just stand still.

594
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,570
I can't wait.

595
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,470
You know, I can't wait for the real gameplay.

596
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,010
Fishing.

597
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,390

00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,550
The real gameplay.

600
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,490
Fishing.

601
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,310
I am the weapon.

602
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,210
The endless black licorice.

603
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,350
Oh my god, it's like I'm opening my own chocolate factory.

604
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,990
Fishing is hard.

605
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,310
How?

606
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:49,970
It's fishing.

607
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,910
It's like the best.

608
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,710
You can make fishing difficult.

609
00:38:53,730 --> 00:39:03,070
it's fishing nightly milk increase attack size and knockback
effects of weapons by 20% also increases pickup range by 50%

613
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,930
Holy shit, there's too many things swinging Reduce opacity,

00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,030
Honestly, I'm surprised.

618
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,330
I'm surprised that I did as well as I thought I did.

619
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,350
Wait, you can do that?

620
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,470
What a streamer.

621
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:17,910
Um.

622
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,250
Three.

623
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,930
Drop lava on the ground.

624
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,250
That's good.

625
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,850
Oh, thank God.

626
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,170
We're doing it.

627
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,610
Oh, there's a big clock.

628
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:28,910
Hello.

629
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,930
It's time to get...

630
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,270
It's time to get you out.

631
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,890
Get out of here.

632
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,610
There can't... There can only be one big clock.

633
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:40,490
Get out.

634
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,490
Down with the clock.

635
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:50,250
I'm always afraid of saying clock because I can slip up and
say the other.

636
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:54,990
big clock.

637
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,870
Nice clock, bro.

638
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:01,890
Nice clock.

639
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:04,990
Okay.

640
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,830
What do we get?

641
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,030
Ooh, a nurses horn.

642
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,610
Level two.

643
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,250
I guess we should take it.

644
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,490
Because we already have it.

645
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:12,970
What?

646
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,710
I'm just talking about clocks.

647
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,830
How is it you're going to tell the time?

648
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,530
The bigger the clock, the easier it is to tell the time.

649
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,910
They don't call me the big Ben for nothing.

650
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,510
Thank you for the super chat.

651
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:35,790

You missed my first Super.

654
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,450
Once you're back in the main menu, click the achievement
section.

655
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,110
It'll tell you how to unlock weapons and items.

656
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:42,350

Thank you.

660
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,170
I don't need to have the game tell me.

661
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,290
I have chat to tell me.

662
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,610
And it's like instant.

663
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,610
Who it means?

664
00:41:53,730 --> 00:42:03,830
Who needs to have the video game tell me what to do When
we're doing chat plays holocure That's actually so nice that

671
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,270
I understand that reference.

672
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,950
Oh, it's over here.

673
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,930
Okay, nice, we dodged it.

Okay, nice.

676
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:14,430
I was worried about, like, having a tree block me.

677
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,110
Q?

678
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,230
Oh, is that my alt?

679
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,190
I don't need to use the Q.

680
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,550
It's like... Oh, wait.

681
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:32,370
with the mv for some reason i thought you meant because like
overwatch ultimate is an apex ultimate is the q button so i

682
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:43,810
was like i have an alt but you're talking about the music
video q which makes a lot more sense now sorry i had gamer

683
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:44,550
brain on

684
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:54,210
i heard this game does have alt though so then i honestly
thought you wanted me to press Q.

685
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,550
I know this has alt, so I honestly thought you were like,
God, alt, alt.

686
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,890
There's so many people.

687
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,370
You should alt.

688
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,870
Uh, increase area.

689
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,090
I do have an alt, though.

690
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,430
Uh.

691
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,150
I have to buy alt?

692
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:14,990
Oh my god.

693
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:16,570
Capitalism.

694
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,210
You can't even escape capitalism and vtubers.

695
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,250
You never escape captives.

696
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,450
Can't believe it.

697
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,290
Pay the queue.

698
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:32,910
Pay the queue.

699
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:37,650
Pay my imaginary currency because the creator won't accept
anybody's money.

700
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:38,930
Alright.

701
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:39,290
Oh.

702
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:39,730
Okay.

703
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:39,930
Wait.

704
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,870
I'll just kill these trams first before I go for the box.

705
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:45,570
Oh, nice.

706
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:45,970
Oh, okay.

707
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:46,950
Oh, okay.

708
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,070
That's a little bit too many.

709
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,030
Fake capitalism!

710
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,130
That is worse than real capitalism.

711
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,870
Because it's a choice.

712
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,410
Oh, thank God.

713
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,470
I'm, like, fucked.

714
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,470
There's a lot of deadbeats and shrimps on me right now.

715
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,470
Uh, okay.

716
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,170
Nice.

717
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,350
We're fine.

718
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,910
Yay!

719
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:11,530
Whoa!

720
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,370
Sorry, we're back to full HP.

721
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,970
We have to head downstairs, though, because...

722
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,750
I need to, like, figure out a way to head down.

723
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:23,770
because there's the other box over there that I kept.

724
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:26,490
I need to get the other box.

725
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,510
There it is.

726
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,850
Yeah, I was trying to get the other box.

727
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:32,790
Okay, increased damage.

728
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,670
Alright, yeah, we got the circled around.

729
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,730
Daruka, thank you for the super chat.

730
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,250
Thank you, thank you.

731
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:47,590

00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,530
Thank me later for...

733
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,190
Alright, thanks.

734
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,170
Oh hey, it's the saplings Wait, is that what they look like?

735
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,070
I thought they I thought they were just like seeds

736
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:16,050
Alright, and then there's the humans I think like When you
become a VTuber One of the hardest things Is to think of Oh

737
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:24,450
no, please Please, I was trying to have a conversation
Please, why every time why every time i want to have a

738
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:40,510
conversation okay okay anyway anyway as i was saying i think
one of the hardest things ever as a as a uh as a vtuber is

739
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:51,710
when you have to think of like good fan names and also like
fan designs to like the to have like a mascot representing

740
00:46:51,710 --> 00:47:00,030
your fans that's like one of the most difficult things it's
because it's all about branding it's all i fucking hate

741
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:12,770
branding um three of increased damage i hate branding
because it's like you want to be like you want to be like

742
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:22,070
the next hello kitty yes oh god where where where oh god
okay oh my god there's way too many people Okay, here he

743
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:29,510
goes And there's like pillars too, please Please, I'm trying
to talk about Branding Please don't want it to be too

744
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:36,330
complicated Because you want the fan mascots to be Easy to
draw and like And but you also want it to be cute But you

745
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:46,430
don't want it to be too girly Because then Because you want
the fan mascots To appeal for both For both boys and girls

746
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,430
So it's like, oh my god No!

747
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,530
Leave me alone!

748
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,210
Okay What did he really...

749
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,250
It dropped three things.

750
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:57,910
Alright.

751
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,010
Alright, what do we...

752
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,850
What do we do?

753
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,270
Three?

754
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,030
The lava?

755
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,210
Is it lava time?

756
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,210
It's lava time.

757
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:06,430
Oh, and it's free!

758
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,610
Oh, God, please.

759
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,010
I have so many arrows.

760
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,050
Okay, here we go.

761
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,870
Please, let me have this.

762
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:16,790
Whatever this is.

763
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:17,130
Okay.

764
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:19,350
Cooking?

765
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,050
Alright, spider cooking.

766
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,590
Alright, nice.

767
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:24,390
We're fine.

768
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,670
We're alive.

769
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:27,590
We're alive.

770
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,650
The best thing about Hullocure is that, like, it'll always
be update, right?

771
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,190
Right, K?

772
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:34,870
It's...

773
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,550
This game will always be getting updates, right?

774
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,830
Right, K?

775
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:46,990
Because...

776
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,490
Because there's always gonna be new members coming in.

777
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:57,410
So that means they game will always have uh will always have
updates and i think that's really great because and the

778
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:06,290
backup is free too oh god oh god oh it's fine we're fine
this game is getting a little bit harder now this game is no

779
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:24,290
pressure or anything of course no credit card uh which one
three increase the frequency all right wait one minute left

780
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:31,090
wait really no i should have read endless this actually is
pretty addicting but i should i don't think i should do

781
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:39,790
endless when i um don't even have a fucking alt yet uh let's
see sean thank you for the super chat thank you thank you

782
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:46,150
fun fact back when this first launch kiara was pretty low
tier kiara then persuaded the dev and quickly updated her in

783
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:52,310
a patch now she's probably one of the easiest for beginners
thank you for the super chat That's interesting.

784
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:58,170
I mean, I guess because they're based off of, like, you
know, actual talents, they can just be like, why does my

785
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:58,910
character suck?

786
00:49:59,050 --> 00:49:59,610
And then...

787
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,550
And then get...

788
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,710
And then be like...

789
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,710
Get, like, patched to become the beefiest fucking character
in the game.

790
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,430
It's just that easy.

791
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,510
But then there's, like, the whole morality of that.

792
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,670
Yeah, give me buff.

793
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:27,110
Make me the strongest character in the game.

794
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,470
It's okay.

795
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,050
We're fine.

796
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:31,870
Everything is fine.

797
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,700
I mean...

798
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,760
If I have a character based off of me and I was an OP as
fuck during launch, of course I...

799
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,940
I prefer pressure the devs to do that too.

800
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,720
Do I just die?

801
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,520
I think I just die, right?

802
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,240
Oh no, this is way too many people.

803
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,540
Oh, the arrow.

804
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,060
Fuck, I forgot about the arrow.

805
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,060
Gamers don't look.

806
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,520
You have to tell me these things earlier.

807
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,280
Gamers don't look.

808
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:07,840
Oh, shit.

809
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,320
Oh, that's a...

810
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:09,880
Oh, no.

811
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,600
Big Ami, please.

812
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,400
Please, let me get the arrow on the...

813
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,060
Oh, okay, okay.

814
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
She has a cooldown.

815
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,140
Big Ami has a cooldown.

816
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,500
Big Ami.

817
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,480
Oh, she's dead.

818
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,380
I killed Big Ami.

819
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,740
Okay, nice.

820
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,240
I had small knockback.

821
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,400
Oh, wait, no, I didn't.

822
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,340
No, I didn't kill her!

823
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,320
She's fucking...

824
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,880
She's gonna pound me.

825
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:35,780
Okay.

826
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,240
What do I get?

827
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:40,880
Uh, a four.

828
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,480
Okay, guys, we gotta run.

829
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,680
We gotta run.

830
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,640
Big army's coming.

831
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:45,820
It's fine.

832
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,400
Just keep running.

833
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,200
Just keep running.

834
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:50,640
Oh, God.

835
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,300
We'll go right.

836
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,500
Why did I go right?

837
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:52,880
We'll go right.

838
00:51:52,900 --> 00:52:02,600

attack is on her at all times so we don't have oh god i keep

Oh, there's the arrow!

843
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,240
Wait, we have to kill Big Amé first.

844
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,880
Because she's closer.

845
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,960
And she has to be close to dying, right?

846
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,980
I'm following the arrow.

847
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,160
Guys, you have to yell at me if I don't follow the arrow.

848
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,440
Oh, God, that was scary.

849
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,080
I thought I died.

850
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,260

851

Okay, three.

855
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,500

856
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,040
Oh, okay.

857
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:52,880
All right.

858
00:52:53,400 --> 00:53:03,880
Before I kill her, I must loot Like a true gamer Oh, it's a
gold anvil Okay Oh god, alright How do we do this?

859
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,520
What is the best combo?

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:12,900

01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,820
What do we want?

1044
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,960
Oh, baby.

1045
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:22,740
A triple.

1046
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,120
V for XP?

1047
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:26,300
No!

1048
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,700
I almost...

1049
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,200
Sorry, I almost...

1050
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,820
I actually almost clicked one.

1051
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,560
I'm not clicking one.

1052
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,440
That was close.

1053
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,380
You guys almost got me there.

1054
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:41,400
Oh my god.

1055
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,000
Is that chicken?

1056
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,060
Oh, thank god.

1057
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,760
Is this one hit if the player does not get attacked by
target?

1058
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,560
That target may become frozen.

1059
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,440
I might as well.

1060
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:50,400
Fuck it.

1061
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,040
Just put everything.

1062
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,640
Oh, I am not doing okay right now.

1063
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:58,740
Bay.

1064
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,580
Bay, why?

1065
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:03,940
Oh, God.

1066
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:04,760
It's okay.

1067
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,500
She's in the head left.

1068
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:07,720
It's like the library.

1069
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,460
I just realized it's like the library level.

1070
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,600
I need more burgers.

1071
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,920
I really need more burgers.

1072
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:13,340
Okay.

1073
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,340
Fine.

1074
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,480
We can't go through this.

1075
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:15,780
No.

1076
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:16,580
Oh, no.

1077
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,860
Oh, that's not even a burger.

1078
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:22,560

01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,230
I'm heading to the arrow.

1086
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,790
I'm getting near as fast as I can.

1087
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:34,410
Oh, nice.

1088
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:37,990
Fuck it, I might as well.

1089
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:40,850
There's nothing more for me.

1090
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:41,230
No!

1091
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:48,130
Be defeated while using Halu.

1092
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,030
I went to Halu.

1093
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:52,110
I went to Halu.

1094
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,370
Alright, shop.

1095
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,670
It's gotcha time.

1096
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,610
I can do one gotcha.

1097
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:58,290
This is it.

1098
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,930
This is where my left turns around.

1099
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,390
This is it.

1100
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:11,670
Okay, this is it.

1101
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,070
Okay, um...

1102
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:17,150
Alright.

1103
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:19,930
Alright, this is it.

1104
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:21,810
Do I have to upgrade anything or are we good?

1105
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:23,250
Sana is good.

1106
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,450
Wait, is she actually good?

1107
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,250
Is she actually?

1108
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:30,890
Is she meta?

1109
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:36,470
Try to get Iris first for money meta to get to true meta
later.

1110
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:37,770
Customer, thank you for the super chat.

1111
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,130
Thank you.

1112
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:38,770
Thank you.

1113
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:40,290
Okay.

1114
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:41,830
Alright, I believe in you.

1115
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,510
This is it.

1116
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:45,810
I believe in you, Sana.

1117
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,390
Okay, we need to have the...

1118
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:51,910
Alright.

1119
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:52,910
How is her attack?

1120
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,330
Okay, it's like a circle.

1121
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,050
Alright, I need more.

1122
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:57,470
more people to be around me.

1123
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,390
I need more fans.

1124
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:00,730
Alright, fans, get over here.

1125
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,550
It's okay, I can't believe it.

1126
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:09,510
I can't believe you guys took advantage of me not reading.

1127
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,530
That's so fucked up.

1128
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,830
A sweet thank you to the super chat.

1129
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:18,630
Thank you, thank you.

1130
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:19,710

I'm glad you were able to make it.

1134
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:23,710
One.

1135
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:24,130
Alright.

1136
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:25,390
Nice.

1137
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:34,970
Okay, we're just going to stay here because this is like
baby mode for now um guys it's not because cali was my my my

1138
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:45,670
crutch it's not because cali was my crutch i am a gamer okay
it's just because i accidentally took halu or halu or it's

1139
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:52,850
because if i didn't take halu if i didn't take halu we could
have made it we could have made it with bay i can i can

1140
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:55,690
fucking beat any stage with any character

1141
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:10,930
It's not because Callie was a crutch It was because I just
chose the wrong item My backseaters fucked me over

1142
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:27,290
Let's see One One or two Stop the cat I don't know what
you're talking about I don't know what you're talking about,

1143
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:27,770
guys.

1144
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:32,010
It's only because I got fucked over by Halu.

1145
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:34,930
That was it.

1146
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,550
It's only because of that.

1147
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:38,150
Right here.

1148
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,590
Who would have thought you needed to read in this game?

1149
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:49,830
I can't believe it foiled by my lack of reading.

1150
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:51,290
Right here.

1151
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,510
Alright, what else, guys?

1152
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:56,490
No!

1153
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:59,910
If it was a skill issue, there would be a journalist mode.

1154
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:01,450
But there isn't.

1155
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:01,990
Hmm?

1156
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,390
There should be a journalist mode.

1157
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,410
And journalist...

1158
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:06,830
Oh, what?

1159
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:07,450
What's that?

1160
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:09,530
What the fuck was that?

1161
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:09,970
Wait.

1162
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:10,670
Oh, no.

1163
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,090
I wonder what would journalist mode be.

1164
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:15,290
Oh, God.

1165
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:15,990

1166
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:16,730

Please, I need a burger.

1169
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:23,830
Oh, my God.

1170
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:24,350
What was that?

1171
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:25,890
Wait, what is my...

1172
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,220

1174
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,510
Just stands still.

1175
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:36,130
Alright.

1176
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:39,170
It's big.

1177
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,030
I'm just big.

1178
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:42,770
Do I damage them?

1179
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:44,950
By being big?

1180
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:46,990
Oh, I do.

1181
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,870
Oh, and I get to absorb!

Entry every 15 seconds.

1184
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,550

01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,010

01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:34,870
I can't believe it.

1191
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:40,210
The recommended upgrades was actually for real recommended.

1192
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:44,950
Who would have thought?

1193
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:47,430
That's crazy.

1194
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:50,930
Who would have thought?

1195
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:53,730
That shit was actually recommended for me.

1196
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:55,530
Not me.

1197
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,610
Oh, God.

1198
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,530

Oh, no.

1201
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,590
This level is so difficult.

1202
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,090
Leave you alone.

1203
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:13,890
Leave you alone.

This is really bad.

1207
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,410
This is...

1208
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,810
This is so bad, there's a maze!

1209
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:24,070
Goodbye, Sana.

1210
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:26,370

1212
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,890
I'm sorry, Sana.

1213
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,130
But I gotcha.

1214
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:35,810
This is it.

Meta.

1216
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:37,310
Meta.

1217
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,130
Meta.

1218
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:42,110

1219
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:42,330

01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,490
This is not a crutch.

1223
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:52,710
This is not a crutch, guys.

1224
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,810
It's not a crutch.

1225
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:02,850
I swear.

1226
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,290
I swear, chat.

1227
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,070
I was just...

1228
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,510
It's not a crutch!

1229
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,510
It's just as intended.

1230
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:17,010
Um, for this, you need these upgrades.

1231
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,610
I'm going to ignore that because I can't read.

1232
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:21,630
Look, I'm going to show you.

1233
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:23,170
We don't need those upgrades.

1234
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,850
when I show you with Mori.

1235
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,910
We're going to be so fine.

1236
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:31,670
I'm going to show you.

1237
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:32,730
I'm going to prove you all wrong.

1238
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:34,990
I'm going to prove you all wrong.

1239
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:37,950
It's because I haven't mastered Bay and Sana yet.

1240
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:40,110
I just haven't mastered them.

1241
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:41,730
But you'll see.

1242
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,390
You'll see.

1243
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:47,130
When I beat this level on Callie.

1244
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:48,530
You'll see.

1245
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:51,290
Not because she is my crutch.

1246
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:53,190
But because I'm that.

1247
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,390
Skillful at video games.

1248
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,130
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

1249
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:01,470
Thank you.

1250
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,930
Thank you.

1251
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:02,670
Oh, God.

1252
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:04,390
Okay, don't worry.

1253
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:04,850
We're fine.

1254
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:05,830
Oh, more upgrades.

1255
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:06,170
Nice.

1256
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:07,090
Okay.

1257
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:08,210
That's fine.

1258
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:09,230
We're fine.

1259
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:10,570
We're okay.

1260
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:11,950
Good luck on the halfway boss.

1261
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:13,090
I don't need luck.

1262
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:14,170
I was...

1263
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:14,970
Oh, okay.

1264
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:15,410
It's fine.

1265
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,990
It's fine.

1266
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,130
All right.

1267
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:18,590
We don't need luck.

1268
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:19,610
We're just that good.

1269
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,730
Okay.

1270
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,650
We just got rid of an upgrade.

1271
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,110
It's literally the only thing that haven't upgraded.

1272
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:25,750
Don't worry.

1273
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:27,030
I got a burger.

1274
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:27,970
I ain't afraid.

1275
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:29,390
Look at that.

1276
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:31,410
See?

1277
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:31,910
Look at that.

1278
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,730
Look at all this money too.

1279
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,330
Look at all this money that I got.

1280
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:37,710
Look at that.

1281
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,150
Alright, now I don't know what to do.

1282
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:40,850
There's no scythe.

1283
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,210
I don't know.

1284
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:51,470
Now that there's no scythe, I don't know what to do anymore.

1285
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:52,350
Poor?

1286
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:52,890
Okay.

1287
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:53,910
Nice.

1288
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,070
This black licorice tab.

1289
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:56,370
Nice.

1290
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:57,670
Okay, we can...

1291
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,190
That'll be fine.

1292
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:00,590
We KO'd him.

1293
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:01,490
See?

1294
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:02,990
Nothing to worry about.

1295
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:05,590
Fucking easiest game of my life on Worry.

1296
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,230
No, not the burger!

1297
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:12,270
I'm wasting my burger!

1298
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:14,770
I'm not afraid.

1299
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:16,010
What do we do?

1300
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:19,430
What do we do, guys?

1301
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,310

1303
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:24,230
Yeah, okay, we're gonna need that for emergencies.

1304
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,990
2.

1305
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:27,390
Alright.

1306
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:28,370
Nice.

1307
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:33,410
Alright, let's just grab all of this real fast and then grab
this box too.

1308
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:34,710
Grab the extra.

1309
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:35,770
No, it's for alt.

1310
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,050
I already have alt!

1311
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,650
Guys, we're gaming.

1312
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,970
We can do this.

1313
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:42,810
I believe.

1314
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,130
I believe.

1315
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:50,390
Nice.

1316
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:53,870

01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:56,230
Okay, this is We don't need all.

1318
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,070
We don't need all, chat.

1319
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,030
We can live past this.

1320
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:01,970
I guess we do the cooking.

1321
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:03,450
What else do we need?

1322
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:05,050

01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:01,870
No, no, no.

1406
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:02,350
We don't need all.

1407
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:03,090
We don't need all.

1408
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:04,590

01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:06,250

Increased haste by 10%, but reduces max HP by... No.

1412
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:14,050
Why are they all so bad?

1413
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:15,250
Why?

1414
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:19,250

1482
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,880
We can max out on that.

Chat.

1488
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,240
Why are they so tanky?

1489
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:13,520
Oh, they have shields.

1490
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,040
Can I kill these?

1491
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,060

1492
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:16,560

I think this is the best mascot design I've ever seen.

1497
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,180
This has to be...

1498
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:30,980
Oh, fuck.

01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:33,800
That's okay.

1501
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,080
We're fine.

1502
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:37,580
Oh, we are so healthy.

1503
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,520

01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,380
Alright.

1510
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,840
I guess he's almost dead.

1511
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,200
He has to be close to dying, right?

1512
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,580
He has to be close to dying.

1513
01:22:58,660 --> 01:22:58,920

01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:17,100
I always mean knockback.

1587
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,680
Okay, now I'm... Now I don't know.

1588
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,180
This is actually the worst...

1589
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,720
Oh, how did I get out of that?

1590
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:26,680
Okay, never mind.

1591
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:27,520
I'm just gaming.

1592
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,900
I'm just gaming because I'm naturally gifted.

1593
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,560
Not because of the choice of the talent.

1594
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:36,300
Okay, here we go.

1595
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,020
It's not because of who I picked.

1596
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,040
It's because I'm just naturally good at this game.

1597
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,540
Knock, knock, back, help.

1598
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:48,660

Oh, wait.

1611
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:36,280

01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:42,740
No, this has decreased the damage.

1614
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,000
Wait, dead in 10 seconds?

1615
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:45,560

Oh, God.

1632
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,420

1633
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,040

1635
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:33,960
Oh, it's a flamethrower.

1636
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:35,900
It's a flamethrower.

1637
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:38,200

1638
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:39,000

Okay.

1640
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:41,020
Oh, God.

1641
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,280
Oh, God, please, please.

01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:34,640
One.

1651
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:35,460
No.

1652
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:36,500
Two for collab.

1653
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:36,700
Okay.

1654
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,560
Two for the collab.

1655
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:39,140
Nice.

1656
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,260
What is this?

1657
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,480
I swear to go.

1658
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:41,780
Okay.

1659
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:42,380
Axe.

1660
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,120
Do I take it?

1661
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,440
I don't think I have an axe.

1662
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:44,900
I don't.

1663
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,100
I have one empty slot.

1664
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:48,160
I think the last empty slot.

1665
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,160
Or do I sell it?

1666
01:29:52,330 --> 01:29:53,110
Max out.

1667
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:53,490
No.

1668
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:54,930
Take?

1669
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:55,290
Alright.

1670
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,010
We'll take it.

1671
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:58,270
I think it's like good for collabs, right?

1672
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:00,670
That's fucking right.

1673
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:07,130
Dude, fuck that person that was like, you're not gonna
survive the halftime boss.

1674
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:08,090
Told you.

1675
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:09,950
Pure skill.

1676
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:16,450
Okay, four, all right.

1677
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:22,330
All right, now we have ten, we just have to live for ten
more minutes.

1678
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:25,690
I feel like, I think we're set for life now.

1679
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:27,110
We're set.

1680
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:29,650
We're set for life.

1681
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:30,450
We can do this.

1682
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:33,890
Oh yeah, the axe with a...

1683
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,470
The axe with a book.

1684
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:36,970
With a black licorice.

1685
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:38,910
Because I love having...

1686
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:40,010
I love using...

1687
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:42,830
I love to cut trees and eat black licorice at the same time.

1688
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:47,790
Alright.

1689
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,390
I guess we'll try...

1690
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,330
We'll upgrade axe so we can collab later.

1691
01:30:54,670 --> 01:30:55,490
Axe time.

1692
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:57,390
We have so many too.

1693
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:58,750
Jesus Christ.

1694
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:00,190
Who keeps giving you the shields?

1695
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:01,490
They're expensive!

1696
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:02,970
Oh my god, there's a collab!

1697
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:03,710
Oh, there's an upgrade!

1698
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:04,250
There's an anvil!

1699
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:05,750
It's okay.

1700
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:06,750
We're five.

1701
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:09,550
We gotta grab the anvil, though.

1702
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,050
Nice.

1703
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:12,790
Axe.

1704
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:15,710
Where's the axe?

1705
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:17,310
There's no more axe.

1706
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:19,950
There's no more axe.

1707
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,350
Let's see.

1708
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:26,450
One or two?

1709
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,170
One or two?

1710
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:29,150
Two?

1711
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:30,010
All right.

1712
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:30,770
Two.

1713
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:36,790
I guess we do the the plug, right?

1714
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:41,210
What a fucking sentence.

1715
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:44,950
Or two?

1716
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:46,470
Alright.

1717
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:49,070
Oh my god, okay.

1718
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:50,130
Alright.

1719
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,410
Oh my gosh, there's so many.

1720
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:54,030
Which one do we do here?

1721
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:57,770
One makes more DPS.

1722
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:59,990
Yes, we do the plug.

01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:35,890
Wait!

1728
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:36,550
Life steal!

1729
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,210
Life steal is always good.

1730
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:39,810
Right?

1731
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:43,910
Yeah!

1732
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:44,970
I'm gonna do it.

1733
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:48,030
I'm gonna get the life steal.

1734
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:50,790
I know life steal is always...

1735
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:51,830
What the fuck is this?

1736
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:56,310
It adds one additional shot to range multi-shot weapons.

1737
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:57,910
Does not affect melee weapon.

1738
01:32:58,210 --> 01:32:59,810
Wait, but I am a melee weapon.

1739
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:01,310
I don't have to sell this.

1740
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,870
Can I upgrade this for free?

1741
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:03,630
Wait, can I upgrade this for free?

1742
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:04,170
Can I strengthen?

1743
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:07,390
Uh, upgrade...

1744
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:09,350
Okay, upgrade, strengthen.

1745
01:33:09,930 --> 01:33:10,270
Confirm.

1746
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:12,510
Holy shit.

1747
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:14,170
I love not thinking for myself.

1748
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:17,970
It's so nice.

1749
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:21,670
This is why I'm a streamer now.

1750
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:28,050
I'm pretty sure becoming a streamer has actually made me
more stupid because I have no free will anymore.

1751
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:29,090
I...

1752
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:33,590
As...

1753
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:37,070
That is the risk you take.

1754
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:40,910
Head empty, let chat decide everything for you.

1755
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:42,930
Oh my gosh, she's from...

1756
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:47,270
You like the movie Wally and then like the humans that are
on those chairs.

1757
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:51,050
But like, and the robots take care of them, that's going to
be me.

1758
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:58,700
It's like, what do I do, chat?

1759
01:33:59,200 --> 01:33:59,780
Oh, what do I...

1760
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:01,140
Oh, hey, what's this?

1761
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:02,520
Crit up.

1762
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:02,940
Oh!

1763
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:10,380
that's the dream right there i don't understand why they
would want to go back to earth

1764
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:29,940
why would they need to go back to earth what's the point

And like, if, if the risk is just, you know, talking about
Wonder Bread ever so often, like, I feel like that's like an

1824
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,500
exchange I'm willing to make.

1825
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,080
Like, it's just Wonder Bread.

1826
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:29,220
Like, it's just, okay, increase.

Okay, this is He has to be normal in real life So this is
his like outlet

You can't be like, like, you know A freak.

1834
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:13,030
So like I swear a lot of like the people with like who are

I mean if he's a really good doctor I feel like I shouldn't

1842
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:31,910
care If he's really good at his job like it should be fine,
right?

1843
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:35,190
As long as he's really good at his job

1844
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:47,720
all right but anyway for those who are confused about like
what the fuck is the wonderbread guy okay this is like old

1845
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:56,640
internet lore but he used to be like oh my god he could be a
better doctor now he could be like a better doctor because

1846
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:05,540
it's like years now if you think about it it's been it's
been fucking years and he has to have improved his doctoring

1847
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:11,520
so like anyway sorry i keep getting off track because i was
supposed to explain to people who don't know who don't know

1848
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:21,500
who the wonderbread guy is so the wonderbread guy he
basically he okay wait uh i guess uh i'll increase that he

1849
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:35,840
basically commissions people to draw like women buying
wonderbread and they're always blonde like he has this very

1850
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:46,940
weird obsession with like And he just commissions women,
like, artwork of women, blonde women, drawing, like,

1851
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,480
drawings.

1852
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,480
And they're all just buying bread.

1853
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:53,180
Oh, and deforestation.

1854
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:54,560
Yeah, and cutting down trees.

1855
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,100
And cutting down trees, because he hates trees, I guess.

1856
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,160
And that's what gets him going.

1857
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:09,520
That's, that's, that's, like, exactly what, like, makes him,
like, really happy.

1858
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:19,600
in life um but like if he's good at his job i feel like okay
if he's like really good at his job like and it's like life

1859
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:31,260
or death like i would like i don't mind if he operates on me
he should like have a card and be like you've just i was

1860
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:41,640
saved by the wonderbread guy But anyway, anyway, um, anyway,
there's a lot of, like, there, I feel like a lot of them

1861
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:45,520
are, like, really normal people outside of the internet.

1862
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:55,300
And then when you find out, holy shit, when you find out,
like, when you find the mask that they take off, it's

1863
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,160
actually crazy.

1864
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:03,540
It's like those people that commission those, like, oh my
god, I used to be on DeviantArt, like, Because I was an

1865
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,620
artist, so, like, you know, like, all...

1866
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:07,180
There was only one place to go.

1867
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:09,740
It was either Tumblr or DeviantArt or both.

1868
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,040
Or other websites.

1869
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,180
Or other websites for different categories.

1870
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:23,540
But, like, this would always pop up in the trending on
DeviantArt.

1871
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:25,620
And...

1872
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:27,040
And...

1873
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,060

Where was I?

1898
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:13,400
Okay, so basically what that is was that apparently artists
made a shitload of money because like There was an article

1899
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:20,100
written about it and they like talked about how much they
made like charged for like those types of Those types of

1901
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:35,140
Oh dragon fire um and basically it is like oh my gosh Look
at that.

1902
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:38,780
Like, it's like a nerdy girl turning into a bimbo.

1903
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,520
It'll be like, first stage, she's reading a lot.

1904
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:49,520
She has glasses on and is reading a library book.

1905
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,300
Second stage, she starts reading easier books.

1906
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,520
And then, like, she starts reading picture books.

1907
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:07,500
And it's so fucking, it's so, it's so, Stop talking to me.

And then...

1910
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:13,820
Um...

1911
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,780
And then she just...

1912
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:16,460
She just...

1913
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:17,120
Oh my god!

1914
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:18,240
Is that Staph's on?

1915
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:21,940
And then she just starts reading, like...

1916
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,440
Like, I guess, like...

1917
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:26,020
Dumber and dumber books?

1918
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:27,820

Until she's like...

01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:34,400
Until she stops reading.

1922
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:38,060

1925
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:46,680
Oh, yeah, we gotta get rid of...

1926
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:48,200
I swear!

1927
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:49,780
We got perms!

1928
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:51,580
Alright, here we go.

1929
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:54,140
Until she becomes a...

1930
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:57,380
Until she cannot think for herself, i.e.

1931
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:57,680
me.

1932
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,800
I mean, streaming is sort of like...

1933
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:00,680
Bipolification!

1934
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:06,760
Okay.

1935
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:08,660
Um...

1936
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:11,720
What do we do?

1937
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:12,840
Two?

1938
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:14,100
Four?

1939
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:15,200
Increase love?

1940
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:15,720
I'll do four.

1941
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:17,780
That's fine.

1942
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:18,440
I swear.

1943
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:21,480
Apparently I accidentally wasted...

1944
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:24,040
Accidentally wasted it for...

1945
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:25,280
Oh no!

1946
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:27,300
What is that?

1947
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,720
Oh no!

1948
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:37,680
Not Toho!

1949
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:40,080
Not Toho!

1950
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:42,140
No!

1951
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,320
No!

1952
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,220
No!

1953
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:48,220
No!

1954
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:49,560
We were so close!

1955
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:52,600
I'm so bad at Toho!

1956
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:56,200
My one weakness!

1957
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:57,640
Toho!

1958
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:00,260
Meta.

1959
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:01,020
Please.

1960
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:01,840
Meta.

1961
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:04,780
Ah!

1962
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:05,920
That's meta!

1963
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:07,800
Iris is meta, right?

1964
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,140
What is this meta?

1965
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:13,820
Okay, I heard, like, Moome's meta, too, right?

1966
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,920
Oh, my God, I'll never get Moome.

1967
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,100
I got meta!

1968
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,220
Okay, nice.

1969
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:23,160
We have meta now.

1970
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:23,900
Alright.

1971
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:25,700
Oh, I have, like, different outfits.

1972
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:26,880
I want to be Santa.

1973
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:28,640
Merry Christmas.

1974
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:31,260
Everyone is meta.

1975
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:32,220
Alright.

1976
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:35,820
Okay, I feel like we can totally...

1977
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:37,820
Like, how do I recommend it upgrades?

1978
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,480
Okay, where do I shop?

1979
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,820
How do I upgrade that?

1980
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:44,140
Is it like...

1981
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:45,240
Oh, stat upgrade!

1982
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,760
There's another tab.

1983
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,760
Hey, guys.

1984
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,420
I don't know if you guys know this.

1985
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,940
But there is another tab for stats.

1986
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:57,400
I can't believe I haven't upgraded stats once.

1987
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,420
I can't believe...

1988
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:02,840
I can't believe it.

1989
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,440
That was the one...

1990
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,880
I was playing everything at by...

1991
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,420
By default.

1992
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,480
Whoa!

1993
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:17,040
No wonder everybody was like, Doki Stats!

1994
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,820
Guys, I didn't realize.

1995
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,760
I didn't realize there was a whole nother tab.

1996
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,700
That's fucking crazy.

1997
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:31,880
Guys, there was a whole nother tab.

1998
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,220
Did you guys know that?

1999
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,740
Oh my god.

2000
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:35,520
You know what?

2001
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:37,760
Maybe I do baby.

2002
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,180
Maybe I do baby.

2003
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:41,120
Yeah.

2004
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:44,460
Um.

2005
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:46,440
Justice!

2006
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,840

2007
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:49,340

01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:49,980
Thank you!

2009
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,080
Hey, is it too late to see you play Phasmophobia?

2010
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:55,840
Thank you for the Aka Aka Aka Supa.

2011
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:59,780
And maybe one day.

2012
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,600
Is Phasmophobia even so popular?

2013
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:04,880
Okay.

2014
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:05,820
What do we get?

2015
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,620
These are all new stuff.

2016
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:16,740
money is 200.4?

2017
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:17,800
Alright, 4.

2018
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:18,600
This.

2019
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:20,880
I can't believe it.

2020
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,420
There was a whole new other level.

2021
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:23,230
I can't.

2022
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:26,360
Who?

2023
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:27,060
Who?

2024
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:28,000
I told you!

2025
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:31,140
Streaming is like modern day film.

2026
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:37,120
It's modern day.

2027
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:41,760
Sam, thank you for the 50 gifted ships.

2028
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:42,380
Thank you, thank you.

2029

Thank you!

2030
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:44,460
Really appreciate it!

2031
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,540
Thank you so much!

2032
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:48,400
Uh, alright, we'll do.

2033
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:50,760
Do we stop?

2034
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:51,360
Ah!

2035
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,200
I read chat!

2036
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:54,280
Alright, that's fine.

2037
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:55,080
We're fine.

2038
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:59,640
I just gotta kill some deadbeats real fast and the shrimps.

2039
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:00,220
Boop!

2040
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:01,600
Boop!

2041
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:02,760
Boop!

2042
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,600
Nice.

2043
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,400
Uh, I guess we upgrade fully on...

2044
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:12,380
Uh, fully on her weapon, right?

2045
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:19,440
there's a pity section for the gotcha by the way 10 pulls
equals one redeem of character oh i love pity this is

2046
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:26,100
exactly why i don't do gotcha i try to avoid gotcha game is
because i'm worried i'm actually gonna find a gotcha game

2047
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:37,160
that i'm really gonna like i like i'm so scared that like
eventually even though like i try not to be invested in i

2048
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:43,960
don't do gotcha game it's because my one fear is that i'll
actually get invested in gotcha games and then i'm gonna

2049
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:55,240
lose all my money that is my one fear because like gotcha is
it's like there's two things that can like be scary um being

2050
01:51:55,240 --> 01:52:03,440
invested in gotcha games or being invested in gambling that
is like the word the the worst fears to have because you

2051
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:12,120
know your wallet is not going to like it your wallet is not
going to like thing of a gotcha is like the game will

2052
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:21,400
eventually shut down one day and then like okay hope
increase quit hit because like the game is going to

2053
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:27,680
eventually one day be shut down with all the servers and
stuff so then you have to think like oh my god all that

2054
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:44,840
money my pngs and then because i already am in fortnite
skins and like i personally have already spent like at least

2055
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:51,540
a thousand dollars on fortnite skins and like that scares me
you know what fuck it we'll get more enemies like this

2056
01:52:51,540 --> 01:53:03,300
should be fine there's more money right this is iris is like
the my wives and husbandos um okay we're getting hollow now

2057
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:10,540
because like we're we can take it you know what fuck it i
ain't scared i have meta!

2058
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,500
Amazing.

2059
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,680
It is a lot.

2060
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:18,080
Wait, what does... What is my hope?

2061
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,420
Oh, it's a bomb.

2062
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:19,820
Okay.

2063
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,440
That's a bomb.

2064
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:23,080
Alright, let's see.

2065
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:26,300
Grab like her or...

2066
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:27,680
Oh, nice.

2067
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,220
That's good.

2068
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:29,720
What is this?

2069
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:31,520
Uh, I guess I'll upgrade.

2070
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:32,960
I'm not gonna upgrade Halu.

2071
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:37,800
It's the greed time!

2072
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,760
Okay, never... No, that's fine.

2073
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:41,020
I don't need more greed.

2074
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:41,680
All right.

2075
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:43,640
Other than three.

2076
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:44,680
What else?

2077
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:46,860
What else?

2078
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:49,800
Who?

2079
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:50,960
Okay.

2080
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:54,020
Guys, we need to max out our shit before we get more greedy.

2081
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:54,860
Guys.

2082
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:59,600
We need to be stronger before we can get greedy.

2083
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:03,600
Okay.

2084
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:04,240
Wait, what's that?

2085
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:05,940
Oh, it's just deadbeats.

2086
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:07,360
It's just a few of them.

2087
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,840
But yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

2088
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,160
of.

2089
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:17,360
I'm afraid of like actually getting really invested in
gotcha and that and then like, because I already have a

2090
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:24,720
Fortnite issue and then I have to think about having a
gotcha issue.

2091
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:31,620
Fuck, I didn't read what she does so I hope it's not
anything that would fuck me over.

2092
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:36,720
It is dangerous when you have like your main gotcha game.

2093
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:37,700
It's so dangerous.

2094
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:38,800
Okay.

2095
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:45,360
It's so, oh my god No, I can't That's NDA asking

like I was like how much do they get paid for that and I'm

2101
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:56,040
like oh my which makes sense because like if you own a
casino you have to make so much money because like because

2102
01:55:56,040 --> 01:56:08,420
like it's Las Vegas my attacks will look pretty there's no
nice that's all I want as long as it looks pretty the best

2103
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:16,300
upgrade there is Because, like, like, Las Vegas rent in
general has to be fucking insane.

2104
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:20,200
Because, like, you know, like, the spear?

2105
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,760
I talked about this before.

2106
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:29,200
But, like, uh, I guess we do half-angel or the RGB meta.

2107
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:32,960
Or one?

2108
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:35,020
Okay, one.

2109
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,760
Okay, so, like, oh, God.

2110
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:39,060
My hands were off my keyboard.

2111
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:50,440
Because, like, the sphere in las vegas you know like i
forgot like for like 30 seconds of advertising on the sphere

2112
01:56:50,440 --> 01:57:03,020
is like what like like 20 000 it has to be more is it more i
don't remember it's more right it's not profit okay they're

2113
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:09,280
not they're making zero profit by the way off of the sphere
it cost a lot it was more than 30 000 i remember i ranted

2114
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:11,600
about it It's not 30,000.

2115
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,580
It was like 100.

2116
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,920
Is it 100,000 or some shit for like 30 seconds?

2117
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,600
It's like so much.

2118
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:21,560
By the way, the sphere right now makes zero profit.

2119
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:29,840
It would take them like, I think like 10 to 20 years before
they actually see real profit.

2120
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:32,500
Yeah, 450k per day.

2121
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:39,740
Yeah, if you want to be on the sphere, you have to pay
450,000 a day to be on the sphere.

2122
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:49,500
sphere oh god bomb time but it's so cool though that is true
but it's also 450 000

2123
01:57:52,980 --> 01:58:05,540
yeah like okay here's to give context so oh chicken okay

2428
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:38,040

2430
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:51,240
when you guys kept yelling at me to upgrade stats like when
you guys would sell stats and I thought that you meant like

2431
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:58,160
the talent the talent has really good stats and that's what
I thought you meant when you guys kept yelling stats at me

2432
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:06,140
and not because of when in reality you were telling me to
purchase my stat upgrades

2433
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,520
I couldn't tell.

2434
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:13,180
I couldn't tell.

2435
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:16,920
Yeah, I was like, what's the context?

2436
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:20,220
I was like, why does my chat keep yelling stats at me?

2437
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:21,520
I don't understand.

2438
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:23,920
Why would they keep yelling that?

2439
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:27,700
Is it because the talents have really good stats in general?

2440
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:29,880
Like, what is the context?

2441
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:35,440

I haven't grabbed this before.

2485
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:31,500

02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:36,560

02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:43,140
There's no way you guys would fuck me over.

2493
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:46,020
Unlike all the other times you guys fucked me over.

2494
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:48,460
This time there's no way you guys would fuck me over.

2495
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:52,100
Okay.

2496
02:16:55,020 --> 02:16:57,480
Compared to all the other times you guys try to fuck me
over.

2497
02:16:57,480 --> 02:16:59,660
There's no way this time it'll work.

It's not one guide if it was multiple guides.

2507
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:27,160

2563

We don't need to take that magnet.

It is.

2592
02:22:04,830 --> 02:22:05,530
Oh, my God.

2593
02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:06,050

2600
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:50,710

Yes, you are.

2604
02:22:57,630 --> 02:23:01,370
I can't believe the devs didn't warn me about Halu.

2605
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:04,490
I can't believe it.

2606
02:23:08,170 --> 02:23:13,070
Why didn't they warn me when...

2607
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:16,990
How could they not do that?

2608
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:19,370

Oh, there's the green.

2613
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:43,650
Attacks have 20% chance to reduce attack and defense of
targets, but that right we don't need that why would it it's

2614

Okay, we're gonna try and figure out how to get to the other
side.

02:32:21,820 --> 02:32:24,000
It can't happen twice in a row.

2768
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:36,840
It can't happen three times in a row, right?

2769
02:32:38,900 --> 02:32:40,920
Okay, we're at the pity stage.

2770

I have to pity pull for her.

2787
02:33:22,700 --> 02:33:23,760
That's so fucked up.

2788
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:25,040
This is why I don't do gotcha.

2789
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:28,300

2852
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:32,340

2853
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:34,060
Uh...

2854
02:36:34,060 --> 02:36:34,900
Let's see.

2855
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:37,120
What do you mean I have no haste?

Wait, where's haste?

2858
02:36:47,400 --> 02:36:49,420
Wait, guys, I don't have haste.

2859
02:36:52,580 --> 02:36:58,300
I don't know why, but, like, I, I, like, assume when you say
haste, you just try to say speed.

2860
02:36:58,440 --> 02:36:59,920
And I was like, maybe that's a British thing.

2861
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:00,360
I don't know.

2862
02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:09,540
Maybe you guys are just trying, like, just saying haste,
which means speed.

2863
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:11,160
I was like, guys, I do have haste.

2864
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:12,280

2865
02:37:12,840 --> 02:37:14,520

02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:06,660
Three?

2878
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:07,660

only reason why I die.

Why didn't they stop me?

2886
02:38:54,620 --> 02:38:56,280
They could have said something.

2887
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:03,780

02:39:03,940 --> 02:39:04,840

02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:04,320
Now I just know, never go down to that corner because it's
never a good idea.

2915
02:41:05,220 --> 02:41:08,900
I'm getting the hang of knowing what the offices look like
now.

2916
02:41:09,940 --> 02:41:10,940
Just do it harder.

Well, that's good for now.

2930
02:41:29,840 --> 02:41:31,060

So that's good.

2934
02:41:36,700 --> 02:41:38,220
Okay, we're gonna...

The Multiple Dudes.

2948
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:03,260
Or the Glasses.

2949
02:42:03,440 --> 02:42:04,360
The Glasses?

2950
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:06,420
The Glasses.

2951
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:06,700
Okay.

2952
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:08,660
Alright.

2958
02:42:18,980 --> 02:42:19,320
Oh!

2959
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:20,720
What the fuck?

2960
02:42:21,280 --> 02:42:22,060

2961
02:42:24,200 --> 02:42:26,480
What the fuck does they all do?

2962
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:28,540

Magical music notes that float vertically in both
Directions.

2972
02:42:51,380 --> 02:42:52,760
Is that good?

2973
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:53,480

2980
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:05,740

I'm so prepared.

2985
02:43:14,500 --> 02:43:15,500
Get ready for this.

2986
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:18,000
Boom.

2987
02:43:18,440 --> 02:43:18,720
Boom.

2988
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:19,740
Boom.

2989
02:43:20,100 --> 02:43:20,100

Oh, nice.

2996
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:23,140
Upgrade.

2997
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:23,760
Free upgrade.

2998
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:28,120
Uh, I guess I'll upgrade Idol sign?

2999
02:43:29,240 --> 02:43:31,540
I mean, there's nothing else to upgrade right now.

3000
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:35,360
Let's see.

3001
02:43:36,120 --> 02:43:36,680
Glasses?

3002
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:40,460
Oh, yeah, I should upgrade glasses because it's, like,
strong XP, right?

3003
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:47,580
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

3004
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:50,700
God, this is my brain right now.

3005
02:43:54,640 --> 02:43:58,820
I can't commentate because all I could think about is
like...

3006
02:44:01,440 --> 02:44:04,340
This is my brain on holo cure.

3007
02:44:05,320 --> 02:44:06,760
Passivist stamp.

3008
02:44:09,960 --> 02:44:13,020
I'm gonna swap this and then...

3009
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:14,700
Intense focus.

3010
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:17,680
When you stop using the trumpet, you'll miss it.

I'm gonna do two.

3017
02:44:57,060 --> 02:44:58,400
I see more twos than ones.

3018
02:45:02,140 --> 02:45:03,060
You know what's crazy?

3019
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:05,280
This game is like, not even...

3020
02:45:05,280 --> 02:45:09,300
This game is not even, like, the file size is not even that
big.

3021
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:12,900
That's actually really, like...

3022
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:13,900
What's the word?

3023
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:15,800
Uh, also, strings!

3024
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:16,960
Thank you for the Akasupa!

3025
02:45:17,700 --> 02:45:18,520
Thank you.

3026
02:45:19,080 --> 02:45:19,140
Dude.

3027
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:26,160
Especially when, like, AAA gaming don't know how to
fucking...

3028
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:31,740
Don't know how to, like, fucking stabilize game sizes.

3029
02:45:32,180 --> 02:45:34,300
Yeah, it's, like, so well optimized.

3030
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:40,520
Like, a lot of AAA devs do not know how to fucking optimize
games these days.

3031
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:45,300
And the fact that this game is the... I don't remember what
the file size was, but I remember when I was, like,

3032
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:56,240
downloading it, I was, like, holy shit at like how small the
game is compared to like because i know there's like lots of

3033
02:45:56,240 --> 02:46:14,880
content too in holocure okay let's see i guess i get glasses
nice and we got the music notes too just get a way big armor

3034
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:25,800
yeah you can tell a key is a like because I still can't
believe I still can't believe the Star Wars classic

3035
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:36,960
battlefront is like how many gigabytes was that 80 plus
gigabytes or was it less than that like 75 75 gigabytes no

3036
02:46:36,960 --> 02:46:44,480
friend oh there's Ben so I'm gonna friend that uses bed for
feather at okay I'll get friend friend it's time it's time

3037
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:54,620
to help me yeah over 70 gigabytes which is insane for like a
game that's supposed to be classic and like apparently the

3038
02:46:54,620 --> 02:47:06,560
reason why oh god please don't hurt me please don't touch me
i don't like social interactions the reason why is that they

3039
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:15,640
forgot to like resize the textures in the game how do you
forget to resize the textures It wasn't even for a holiday.

3040
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:17,480
I don't understand.

3041
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:23,300
Okay, let's see.

3042
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:25,420
What do we get?

3043
02:47:25,460 --> 02:47:25,860
Civilization.

3044
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:27,100
I guess we could do civilization.

3045
02:47:27,380 --> 02:47:28,140
Let's max that out.

3046
02:47:28,940 --> 02:47:29,660
Is there another arrow?

3047
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:30,660
Let's go to my left.

3048
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:36,780
Like, I don't understand if they want to have the game out
in time for Christmas or something.

3049
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:37,660
Or for...

3050
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:38,600

Alright.

3090
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:10,100
Oh, fuck!

That's a one!

3092
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:18,360
My last dude.

3093
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:20,080
I can't tell.

3094
02:50:20,300 --> 02:50:21,380
That's a wall.

3095
02:50:26,750 --> 02:50:28,430
I can't tell.

3096
02:50:31,190 --> 02:50:33,390
It's so hard to tell.

3097
02:50:34,090 --> 02:50:35,530
I don't understand.

3098
02:50:36,970 --> 02:50:37,650
Do I have a dove?

3099
02:50:37,830 --> 02:50:39,710
Okay, maybe this time I'll get Fauna.

3100
02:50:40,990 --> 02:50:41,810
Maybe this time.

3101
02:50:41,930 --> 02:50:43,350
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

3102
02:50:43,490 --> 02:50:43,790
Thank you.

3103
02:50:43,930 --> 02:50:44,490
Okay.

3104
02:50:46,790 --> 02:50:49,130
I got counters, dude.

3105
02:50:49,490 --> 02:50:50,510
Alright, look.

3106
02:50:51,590 --> 02:50:53,970
Apparently, guys, look, it's not a crutch.

3107
02:50:54,550 --> 02:50:55,990
Okay, we're gonna look.

3108
02:50:56,330 --> 02:50:59,730
Okay, maybe, okay, maybe we can do this.

3109
02:51:00,490 --> 02:51:03,590
As long as we don't keep getting too tired.

3110
02:51:06,310 --> 02:51:09,170
No, we don't deserve the house.

3111
02:51:09,870 --> 02:51:11,930
We need to defeat the office.

3112
02:51:12,390 --> 02:51:14,030
We don't deserve it.

3113
02:51:14,730 --> 02:51:15,350
No, my goodness.

3114
02:51:15,410 --> 02:51:16,690
Guys, it's the dude crutch.

3115
02:51:16,710 --> 02:51:19,470
It's the fucking duke curse, okay?

3116
02:51:20,950 --> 02:51:23,510
It's because we kept getting dueted on.

3117
02:51:26,930 --> 02:51:27,970
Always stay centered.

3118
02:51:28,330 --> 02:51:28,530
Yeah, I know.

3119
02:51:28,630 --> 02:51:34,270
I just realized that, like, maybe, like, going to the edges
is not a good idea.

3120
02:51:35,090 --> 02:51:35,990
Who would have thought?

3121
02:51:38,590 --> 02:51:40,490
The duke curse, it's real.

3122
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:42,530
Be careful.

3123
02:51:43,170 --> 02:51:45,710
When you pick up the duke, you can never go back.

3124
02:51:47,270 --> 02:51:48,570
The run is over.

3125
02:51:48,790 --> 02:51:51,210
The moment you start duding, the run is over.

3126
02:51:52,050 --> 02:51:55,910
It's not as a cost as you don't give up.

3127
02:51:56,930 --> 02:51:59,330
Oh my god, no, I'm not at the center.

3128
02:51:59,990 --> 02:52:01,210
I'm not at the center.

3129
02:52:02,330 --> 02:52:03,490
Okay, it's okay, we're fine.

3130
02:52:04,590 --> 02:52:05,630
We're slowly adjusting.

3131
02:52:05,910 --> 02:52:06,730
Oh wait, there's a...

3132
02:52:07,630 --> 02:52:09,290
Okay, this is very risky.

3133
02:52:10,090 --> 02:52:11,650
But, oh my god, okay, it's fine.

3134
02:52:12,890 --> 02:52:13,550
It's fine.

3135
02:52:13,970 --> 02:52:15,010
It's fine.

3136
02:52:16,710 --> 02:52:18,590
We just gotta keep moving forward.

3137
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:19,290
This is it.

3138
02:52:20,350 --> 02:52:20,930
Oh, there's no...

3139
02:52:20,930 --> 02:52:22,030
Okay, what do we get here?

3140
02:52:23,790 --> 02:52:24,670
Institute cause.

3141
02:52:29,910 --> 02:52:30,350
Three?

3142
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:31,790
Okay.

3143
02:52:32,190 --> 02:52:32,690
We get three.

3144
02:52:33,330 --> 02:52:35,050
Oh, we're gonna back out a little bit, though.

3145
02:52:35,090 --> 02:52:36,430
We're gonna back out a little bit.

3146
02:52:36,970 --> 02:52:37,350
Ow.

3147
02:52:37,730 --> 02:52:38,350
That's fine.

3148
02:52:38,470 --> 02:52:38,910
We're fine.

3149
02:52:39,370 --> 02:52:40,150
Oh, box.

3150
02:52:40,290 --> 02:52:40,830
Another box.

3151
02:52:40,970 --> 02:52:41,710
That's just burger.

3152
02:52:42,230 --> 02:52:43,550
We don't need the burger, though.

3153
02:52:44,210 --> 02:52:45,570
Should be fine without it.

3154
02:52:46,250 --> 02:52:46,690
Uh...

3155
02:52:46,710 --> 02:52:47,170
feather.

3156
02:52:48,410 --> 02:52:49,550
We gotta get all the feathers.

3157
02:52:51,070 --> 02:52:52,230
For the ultimate.

3158
02:52:53,050 --> 02:52:54,290
We gotta max out the feathers.

3159
02:52:54,690 --> 02:52:55,850
I'm figuring out the meta.

3160
02:52:56,310 --> 02:52:57,010
Very slowly.

3161
02:52:57,750 --> 02:52:58,190
It's okay.

3162
02:52:58,350 --> 02:53:00,450
The moment we max out the feathers, we can go.

3163
02:53:00,870 --> 02:53:02,110
We can start gaming for reels.

3164
02:53:02,310 --> 02:53:02,850
Ooh, the flower.

3165
02:53:03,850 --> 02:53:04,570
What's the flower?

3166
02:53:05,310 --> 02:53:06,950
Tax to have 20% chance to reduce.

3167
02:53:07,090 --> 02:53:07,710
Okay, nice.

3168
02:53:07,810 --> 02:53:08,450
We got that.

3169
02:53:09,450 --> 02:53:10,370
You don't need the burger.

3170
02:53:11,450 --> 02:53:12,670
We're perfectly healthy.

3171
02:53:13,450 --> 02:53:14,150
Look at us.

3172
02:53:14,230 --> 02:53:15,930
We're perfectly healthy, guys.

3173
02:53:16,330 --> 02:53:18,430
Like, That said, Cali was not a crutch.

3174
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:22,330
We can replicate it.

3175
02:53:24,330 --> 02:53:25,190
Alright, nice.

3176
02:53:25,250 --> 02:53:26,550
Now we have maxed out.

3177
02:53:26,830 --> 02:53:28,250
We will be able to replicate.

3178
02:53:28,490 --> 02:53:29,630
I swear to God.

3179
02:53:33,570 --> 02:53:34,610
It's possible.

3180
02:53:35,810 --> 02:53:37,050
Do I take this?

3181
02:53:37,330 --> 02:53:38,130
Do we take the plug?

3182
02:53:40,610 --> 02:53:46,670
The moment I beat a sage, we might only be able to beat
sages on Cali, but like...

3183
02:53:48,150 --> 02:53:57,810
the moment we can be another stage with a different talent

3184
02:53:57,810 --> 02:53:59,070

3216
02:56:43,340 --> 02:56:44,620
There's just too many balls.

3217
02:56:46,260 --> 02:56:49,540
Don't you just hate it when there's just too many balls on
the screen?

3218
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:50,620
Like, come on.

Alright.

3222
02:57:01,360 --> 02:57:02,160
Understandable.

3223
02:57:04,260 --> 02:57:06,460
Me every day.

3224
02:57:09,220 --> 02:57:10,020
Okay.

3225
02:57:10,580 --> 02:57:11,500
So we have this.

3226
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:13,580

We're making good progress this time.

3232
02:57:26,380 --> 02:57:28,860
I think it's also because I'm not getting distracted by the
dudes.

3233
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:35,000
The dudes aren't hurting me.

3234
02:57:36,920 --> 02:57:38,100
Do you actually read chat?

3235
02:57:38,320 --> 02:57:39,160
No, I do not.

3236
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:41,260
This is all pre-recorded.

3237
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:45,880
My psych...

3247
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:10,280

3248
02:59:10,320 --> 02:59:10,440

02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:29,540
Everything is fine.

3252
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:33,840
If I keep going right, it's like I don't see it.

3253
02:59:33,980 --> 02:59:34,580
What arrow?

3254
02:59:35,080 --> 02:59:37,180
What arrow are you guys talking about?

3255
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:38,600
There's no arrows anywhere.

3256
02:59:39,760 --> 02:59:40,320
What?

3257
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:43,660
What arrows are you talking about?

3258
02:59:44,340 --> 02:59:47,300
But anyway, as I was saying, it's crazy.

3259
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:48,760
AI is too strong now.

3260
02:59:49,140 --> 02:59:51,520
AI has predicted the future for streaming.

3261
02:59:51,940 --> 02:59:54,460
All I do is just be like, chat GPT.

3262
02:59:54,660 --> 03:00:02,860
uh what is my what is my chat gonna tell me today when i

right is actually the chat GPT screen because because

3268
03:00:59,550 --> 03:01:00,070
Civilization.

Nice.

3270
03:01:02,110 --> 03:01:02,870
Good job, friend.

3271
03:01:05,130 --> 03:01:11,930
Okay, as I was saying, uh, that actually shows how good of a
streamer I am.

3272
03:01:12,450 --> 03:01:14,070
That it just feels so real.

3273
03:01:17,630 --> 03:01:23,170
Oh my god, she's so good at streaming that it doesn't even
feel like it's pre-recorded.

3274
03:01:23,230 --> 03:01:23,670
I know!

3275
03:01:23,850 --> 03:01:24,690
It doesn't!

3276
03:01:25,090 --> 03:01:27,750
I'm gonna grab before it because I need a...

3277
03:01:28,270 --> 03:01:29,150
AI is true.

3278
03:01:29,430 --> 03:01:31,470
Oh my god, did you guys hear about the dead internet theory?

3279
03:01:31,790 --> 03:01:32,350
Does it...

3280
03:01:32,930 --> 03:01:39,510
Like, every... If you ever look at, like, popular posts
from, like, big Twitter accounts, uh, there'd be, like, it's

3281
03:01:39,510 --> 03:01:40,230
just bots.

3282
03:01:40,750 --> 03:01:47,930
It's because of, like, because of Elon Musk's fucking, like,
oh, like, advertising, fucking monetization shit.

3283
03:01:48,310 --> 03:01:52,150
For those who don't know what the dead internet theory is,
let me open this box first.

3284
03:01:53,350 --> 03:01:56,990
It's just, the world is becoming more and more infested in
bots.

3285
03:01:57,850 --> 03:02:05,250
like in the internet yeah it's just all up internet they
just they actually use chat gpt and ai to make twitter

3286
03:02:05,250 --> 03:02:21,790
responses it's so fucking weird it's so weird holy shit it's
like y2k it's like modern day y2k um buddy friend you only

3287
03:02:21,790 --> 03:02:36,710
have three oh sorry it's like chat is just my entire chat is
just it's just ai so like if you ever go on like those

3288
03:02:36,710 --> 03:02:42,490
popular like meme twitter accounts or not just like news
twitter accounts or like just like wait what achievement

3289
03:02:42,490 --> 03:02:50,850
don't take any damage for five seconds oh shit i did it i'm
fucking gaming uh but basically like they actually use like

3290
03:02:50,850 --> 03:02:54,210
oh wait okay oh my god but they're super chat time okay

3291
03:02:57,850 --> 03:03:04,950
become high mind and chat GPT all our base blood on the chat
GPT say thank you the super chat thank you thank you it's

3292
03:03:04,950 --> 03:03:13,090
actually so scary though because you don't know like like i
think they haven't targeted vtubers yet like vtubers are not

3293
03:03:13,090 --> 03:03:25,870
targeted yet like viral posts but you ever look no my five
minute not take damage but but you ever look at any viral

3294
03:03:25,870 --> 03:03:34,450
post or anything mostly just like bot accounts and the
reason why they do that is because they can sell twitter

3295
03:03:34,450 --> 03:03:47,050
accounts to like for oh fuck upgrade sorry give me a sec
this is this is important um oh nice uh what do we get here

3296
03:03:47,050 --> 03:03:53,730
what do we get here i mean it's not we're not talking about
like link in bio

3297
03:03:57,850 --> 03:04:06,970
in bio shit is like actual like replies to your tweets it's
like replies to your tweets that feel like real people type

3298
03:04:06,970 --> 03:04:19,410
responses to it because they're trying to get reactions to
it and stuff and then oh whoa Pull in the wall It's not that

3299
03:04:19,410 --> 03:04:30,510
it's like actual viral tweets that have like that are like
there to like get likes and follows and um even like like if

3300
03:04:30,510 --> 03:04:40,730
we started on youtube because it's like the mr b shit um god

want do we invite you

3302
03:04:47,610 --> 03:04:54,710
okay here you go but like it's because like the reason why
they do that is because And they're always verified too.

3303
03:04:55,010 --> 03:04:59,830
They're always verified to take advantage of the
monetization for Elon Musk shit.

3304
03:05:00,650 --> 03:05:07,030
Because they're like, oh, if we have like a viral tweet,
then like, oh my god, get out!

3305
03:05:07,270 --> 03:05:07,790
Leave!

3306
03:05:08,350 --> 03:05:08,710
Stop!

3307
03:05:08,930 --> 03:05:09,410

I guess we'll strengthen one.

3336
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:37,970
We'll sneak it out.

3337
03:07:38,730 --> 03:07:41,650

3344
03:08:16,330 --> 03:08:17,030

Oh, my God.

3352
03:08:33,030 --> 03:08:34,070
What is the range?

3353
03:08:34,150 --> 03:08:36,110
I need to get into an open space.

3354
03:08:37,050 --> 03:08:37,730
This is bad.

3355
03:08:37,830 --> 03:08:39,630
I'm not, like, in an open... Oh, my God.

3356
03:08:43,210 --> 03:08:43,650
Okay.

3357
03:08:43,870 --> 03:08:44,290
I'm... I'm...

3358
03:08:44,290 --> 03:08:50,030
I don't want to look at this.

3359
03:08:50,030 --> 03:08:52,750
I don't want to look at this.

3360
03:08:54,750 --> 03:08:56,590
Get me out of here.

3361
03:08:57,850 --> 03:08:58,870
No, I don't see.

3362
03:08:59,190 --> 03:09:00,230
I don't perceive.

3363
03:09:00,530 --> 03:09:01,910
I don't perceive.

3364
03:09:02,710 --> 03:09:05,070
If I don't look, it's like it doesn't exist.

3365
03:09:05,770 --> 03:09:11,250
If I don't look, it's not there.

3366
03:09:12,790 --> 03:09:14,270
Yeah, that's how I'm going to go with it.

3367
03:09:14,290 --> 03:09:14,670
life.

3368
03:09:15,050 --> 03:09:15,650
Just don't look.

3369
03:09:16,970 --> 03:09:18,830
If I don't look, it doesn't exist.

3370
03:09:20,090 --> 03:09:21,530
I might as well max that out.

3371
03:09:24,010 --> 03:09:24,570
Oh, three!

3372
03:09:25,490 --> 03:09:26,630
I might as well take all of that.

3373
03:09:27,010 --> 03:09:27,010
Yeah.

3374
03:09:27,250 --> 03:09:29,230
The cooking and the super shadow.

3375
03:09:30,350 --> 03:09:32,110
And then we enhance.

3376
03:09:33,930 --> 03:09:38,690
Might as well enhance the... Well, enhance the book.

3377
03:09:39,650 --> 03:09:40,090
Let's see.

3378
03:09:40,150 --> 03:09:41,450
You cannot...

3379
03:09:42,190 --> 03:09:43,110
I'm ready!

3380
03:09:43,270 --> 03:09:44,270
You can't stop me!

3381
03:09:48,930 --> 03:09:50,490
Oh shit, collab!

3382
03:09:52,870 --> 03:09:53,270
Nice.

3383
03:09:54,050 --> 03:09:55,690
I got the collab time.

3384
03:09:59,910 --> 03:10:06,330
But yeah, back then, back then, the meta for YouTube
accounts was to be everywhere with comments.

3385
03:10:06,650 --> 03:10:08,290
So, like, you'd be like...

3386
03:10:09,770 --> 03:10:10,370
Alright.

3387
03:10:10,690 --> 03:10:11,670
Do we strengthen this?

3388
03:10:11,890 --> 03:10:12,810
Or do we swap this?

3389
03:10:13,350 --> 03:10:17,750
We can max out the the the we can snap

3390
03:10:22,570 --> 03:10:34,210
get gorilla paw okay get gorilla paw swap swap two okay swap
two all right and we'll strengthen confirm but yeah back you

3391
03:10:34,210 --> 03:10:46,090
know like back in old youtube the meta was to like have just
oh shit oh my god okay here we go okay we're gonna max up

3392
03:10:46,090 --> 03:10:50,410
book just to have with YouTube comments.

3393
03:10:50,630 --> 03:10:58,510
So every YouTube viral YouTube video, you see like the same
five people commenting on YouTube.

3394
03:10:58,870 --> 03:11:00,690
And then they'll sell their accounts afterwards.

3395
03:11:03,730 --> 03:11:06,070
Because it's like so, that's like easy subscribers.

3396
03:11:07,310 --> 03:11:09,450
It was just so easy to get subscribers.

3397
03:11:09,670 --> 03:11:11,270
And then they'll sell the YouTube account.

3398
03:11:11,770 --> 03:11:15,490
And then there's like free YouTube play button.

3399
03:11:16,530 --> 03:11:20,890
Like free, like, Head Start and stuff for those who are
like, Like, they'll sell it to, like, all...

3400
03:11:20,890 --> 03:11:25,330
They'll sell it to, like, some fucking content creator that
wants, like, more subscribers or something.

3401
03:11:25,650 --> 03:11:26,290
And then, like...

3402
03:11:26,290 --> 03:11:27,750
And then, at one point, they were, like...

3403
03:11:27,750 --> 03:11:30,690
It started hacking other channels, too.

3404
03:11:31,010 --> 03:11:37,150
They were, like, hacking YouTube channels so they can sell
the YouTube channels and stuff for money.

3405
03:11:37,530 --> 03:11:38,770
It's fucking crazy.

3406
03:11:39,710 --> 03:11:40,370
Let's see.

3407
03:11:40,570 --> 03:11:42,010
Do we want... We don't want this, right?

3408
03:11:48,780 --> 03:11:50,200
Do we want this or nah?

3409
03:11:50,460 --> 03:11:51,660
Do we strengthen it?

It's the closest to a dragon.

3774
03:30:57,410 --> 03:31:00,350
I can't believe it's a tomato, too.

3775
03:31:01,010 --> 03:31:01,350
