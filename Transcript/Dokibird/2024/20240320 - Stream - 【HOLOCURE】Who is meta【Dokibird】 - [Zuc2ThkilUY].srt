1
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,890
AHHHHH!

2
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,210
Sorry everybody!

3
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,810
Sorry I forgot to let by the time!

4
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,950
The time fucking messed me up!

5
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,830
Oh my god!

6
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,710
Oh my gosh, sorry everybody!

7
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:13,410
I had to do some work stuff and I looked at the clock and I was like, Oh my god it's 5!

8
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,810
I was like, I don't have anything set up!

9
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:27,970
I'm so stressed out and I'm busy and I was like, Okay, I can get this done and then I was like, I'm like looking at time like, Oh fuck wait!

10
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,790
It's streaming time!

11
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,170
It's streaming time!

12
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,870
Did I finish the work?

13
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,590
The thing is, I'm never done with work.

14
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,750
I'm always working.

15
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,410
No but today is like, particularly...

16
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:50,590
Stressful because like, I might have... I received some concepts for my new...

17
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:59,650
For my new skin suit and I was like working on like trying to figure out if like, if it looks okay.

18
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,610
Like I was editing it and stuff.

19
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,810
So I was like editing my new skin suit and I was like with my tailor.

20
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,310
With my skin suit tailor.

21
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,210
And...

22
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,150
And I was like editing it and editing it and I was like, will this look good?

23
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,690
I was so stressed out.

24
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,690
I was so stressed out because I was like, oh my god I hope the dragoons will like this.

25
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,710
And I was like, what if they don't like it?

26
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,990
What if my fucking taste sucks?

27
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,290
What if I'm fucking terrible at like, what makes a good skin suit?

28
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,750
I'm like, aww.

29
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,950
And I was like stressing it out and I was sending it to somebody.

30
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,070
I was like, which one do you like?

31
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,570
The original skin suit design or like...

32
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,390
Or like what I did?

33
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,630
And then they said the original.

34
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,830
I was like, what's the point?

35
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,530
And then I had like a mini breakdown.

36
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,490
And I was like, what's the point?

37
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:03,130
I wasted so many hours editing this and trying to figure out what I want.

38
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,730
And then people still like the original more.

39
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,270
What's the point?

40
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,670
And I was like having a mini breakdown.

41
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,070
And then I was like, what if I just have bad taste?

42
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,390
And I was like, oh my god.

43
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,030
I just fucking be a tomato.

44
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,130
I don't care.

45
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,710
I was so stressed out.

46
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,830
Because I was like, this skin suit is forever.

47
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,350
I can't just take off the skin suit.

48
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,650
But I'm like, oh my god.

49
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,390
This is technically gonna be like my new main look forever.

50
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,190
What if I hate it?

51
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,190
What if I hate it but everybody else loves it?

52
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,690
What if everybody else hates what I think looks cool?

53
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,870
What if I'm like, this looks so cool.

54
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,890
And everybody else will be like, this sucks.

55
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,530
I'm like, no!

56
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,930
So like...

57
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,470
So that's why I've been like going through the past two...

58
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,710
Okay, the past like...

59
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,030
Two weeks.

60
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,490
This is what I've been going through.

61
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,330
But like the past two hours was me like...

62
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,930
Like fucking freaking out and trying to figure out like what looks good.

63
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,070
And I'm like...

64
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,770
I was like, this has to look good.

65
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,550
This has to look like me.

66
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,470
My personality.

67
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,370
Everything I like.

68
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,470
My personality.

69
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,190
And like it still has to be unique but not too complicated.

70
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,710
Because I don't like...

71
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,250
I don't like it when it's too cluttered or too much.

72
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,750
It has to be like easy to cosplay but not too easy to cosplay.

73
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,190
It has to look good on merch.

74
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,430
It has to tell a story.

75
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,550
And I'm like, I hate this.

76
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,830
I hate...

77
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,730
I hate trying to fucking figure this out.

78
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,810
I was just like...

79
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,350
No!

80
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,470
No!

81
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,090
That's repulsive.

82
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,310
Think about it.

83
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,150
It's been a mess.

84
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,890
Like you bring a good look at me.

85
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,110
It just has to be recognizable.

86
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,130
Like a very unique polk star.

87
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,230
I know for sure it's going to be a mess.

88
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,290
It's been a mess.

89
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,330
It has to be recognizable with a unique silhouette.

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,730
But also not too unique.

91
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,150
Because you don't want it to be too messy and too cluttered.

92
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,390
But also you want it to look nice.

93
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,590
You want it to just look nice and be like that's a nice, recognizable design.

94
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,550
I'm like, I hate this.

95
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,390
And I'm like editing it and stuff.

96
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,290
I was like, okay, this is like so many ideas I have to make it look better and to make it look better.

97
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,450
And so like, maybe this will make it better as a skin suit and everything.

98
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:49,930
And then I sent it to a friend and I was like, what do you think?

99
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,990
Which one?

100
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,190
One or two?

101
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,570
One being the original, two being my edit.

102
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,770
And they're like, one.

103
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,170
I'm like, what's the point?

104
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,990
I spent an hour and a half editing this.

105
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,410
What's the point?

106
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,430
I'm like, if you want to see it, you can.

107
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,190
If you think like that, then what if the dragoons don't like it either?

108
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:30,510
And so that's what... So yeah, I had a mini breakdown.

109
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:38,870
I had a mini breakdown and I spent like the last 15 minutes getting myself together.

110
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,930
Thank you for the super chat.

111
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,270
Thank you.

112
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,790
Thank you.

113
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,870
It's your skin suit.

114
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,170
You should focus on making it comfortable for you.

115
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,030
Thank you for the super chat.

116
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,410
Thank you.

117
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,810
Thank you.

118
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,990
But what about the branding?

119
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,100
But what about the branding and needs to have good branding.

120
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,420
So it's so painful.

121
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,860
I wish I can just like hire somebody to do this.

122
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,780
But then like...

123
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,840
Oh my god, it's so painful.

124
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
But like, technically I did, but it's just like...

125
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,700
I did so much work, so much.

126
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,580
I woke up stressed.

127
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:37,240
And then, not gonna lie, streaming has actually been my only place to escape.

128
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,280
Like, that's why I love streaming so much.

129
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,600
I stream so I can escape off stream life, which is behind the scenes stuff.

130
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:54,760
I stream so I don't have to worry about... I like escape my behind the scenes work and how much work it is and everything.

131
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,240
And I get to spend it with you guys too.

132
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,320
You guys... you guys evalute my stress for me.

133
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,080
That's why I stream.

134
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,960
Every time I get to stream, I'm like, oh my god, thank god.

135
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,800
I get to escape from work.

136
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,340
I get to escape from actual work.

137
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
It's my escapism.

138
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,660
Alright, anyway, today...

139
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,620
Sorry, I had to go through that little...

140
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,480
Little rant today.

141
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,620
Um...

142
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,240
Little rant today because holy fuck it.

143
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,860
I've been like really stressed out since waking up.

144
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,040
Um...

145
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,060
Richie, thank you for the super chat.

146
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,720
Thank you, thank you.

147
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,040
The brand is Doki Bird.

148
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,720
There's no question about that.

149
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,860
Thank you for the super chat.

150
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,920
Thank you, thank you.

151
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,120
Anyway, everybody.

152
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,220
We are playing HOT.

153
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,820
Hello, Cure!

154
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,600
Yeah!

155
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,800
I don't know if this game has a full screen because like...

156
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
When I opened it up...

157
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,900
Um...

158
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,400
Like...

159
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,940
Uh...

160
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,200
When I opened it up, it gave me this.

161
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,260
It's like not full screen.

162
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,640
And I was like, whoa!

163
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,700
It's so tiny!

164
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,140
Oh, it does?

165
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay, because I was wondering if we were...

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,440
We should...

167
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,120
We should watch this intro.

168
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,660
Ba-ba-ba-na-na-ba.

169
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,700
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba.

170
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,280
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba.

171
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,380
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba.

172
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,240
I love...

173
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,660
The artwork is so pretty in this game.

174
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,180
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba.

175
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,980
I know like the music and I actually...

176
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,480
Uh...

177
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:29,880
The...

178
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,580
Okay, let's see.

179
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,140
Graphic settings.

180
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,880
There we go.

181
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,560
Oh, there we go.

182
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,520
Nice.

183
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,320
Can I...

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,900
Oh, there we go.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,340
Full screen.

186
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,620
Yay!

187
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
We get full screen!

188
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,600
I don't know if the volume is okay.

189
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,280
Let me turn it down a little.

190
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,240
Maybe?

191
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,760
I don't know, guys.

192
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,280
I hope the volume is okay, chat.

193
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,640
Uh...

194
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,960
But yeah, I'm super excited to finally play Holog here.

195
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,300
It's been a game that I've been wanting to play for a very, very long time.

196
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,700
I heard it's like...

197
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,100
Really addicting.

198
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,340
And...

199
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,380
The biggest crime is that this game is free.

200
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,180
Like...

201
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,180
This game...

202
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,840
I know like...

203
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,980
Because this is like Passion Project.

204
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,520
So I know like why it's free.

205
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,660
And it's actually crazy that this game is free.

206
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,460
Because I was reading the reviews and...

207
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,460
And like a lot of people are like, oh, I don't really know much about Hololive.

208
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,480
But like this is an actually really fun game.

209
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,540
Like I don't know like the...

210
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,040
The...

211
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,840
The...

212
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,300
I don't know like the story behind this.

213
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,980
Or I don't know like how to...

214
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,300
Like I don't know the lore behind this.

215
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,220
But it's a really fun...

216
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,380
It's a really fun game.

217
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,460
And the fact that the creator wouldn't even...

218
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,720
Was like refused to like accept donations or anything or be paid for this is actually...

219
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,580
Um...

220
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,780
Like insane.

221
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,620
Because like bro, you deserve money for making this game.

222
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,880
Like holy shit.

223
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm getting rid of screen shake.

224
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,080
Because I've always hated screen shake.

225
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,960
But yeah, how's the volume chat?

226
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,520
I'm worried it might be too loud.

227
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,540
My sound guy has been like...

228
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,140
Some stuff has came out for my sound guy.

229
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,620
So like I will have to rely on you guys to help me with the volume control.

230
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,320
A bit loud?

231
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,180
Okay, let me turn it down a little bit then.

232
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,920
Let's see.

233
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,220
I'll turn it down a little bit.

234
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,700
No, I'm thinking of the super chat.

235
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,020
Thank you.

236
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,520
Thank you.

237
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,420
Oh, wait, sound guy's here!

238
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,500
Okay, let's see.

239
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,320
Turning it down.

240
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,880
Sound guy!

241
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,820
I hope everything's okay with you!

242
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,260
But yay!

243
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,420
Sound guy's here!

244
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,480
Okay, let me see.

245
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,840
Turn it down the music a little bit more.

246
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,760
Okay, let's see.

247
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,720
Where is the music?

248
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,460
I love my favorite time.

249
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,380
My...

250
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,860
Oh wait.

251
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,960
I love...

252
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,420
My favorite time is sound control.

253
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,440
Uh...

254
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,360
Yippee!

255
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,260
Sound guy!

256
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,820
Alright, turn down the music a little bit.

257
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,720
Um...

258
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,520
But yeah, but I understand though, because like, what I really admire is the whole...

259
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,040
They set...

260
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:10,960
Hololive set up this whole like, holo indie thing, which is providing like funding and support to indie developers, which is really admirable.

261
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,200
But I know like the creator of Holocure is not in there because they wanted to like still keep up this passion project and stuff.

262
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,460
So, which is understandable because the thing about passion projects is that you have the control of your vision and everything.

263
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:38,780
So, like, you know, like corporate, like, you know, you don't have to answer to something higher up to you regarding changes or things or like you want to edit some things to fit more of what the people in the higher ups would want for it.

264
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:47,820
So it's understandable why this kept was free and also not part of the holo indie, the holo indie project because it is a passion project.

265
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,700
Like what he wants to do is reflecting on what the fans want and what he, his vision is.

266
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,100
So that's like really understandable and it's like really honorable thing to do.

267
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:08,960
And, and yeah, you don't have to listen to like what, like, you know, not just like Matt what management wants, but also like other people, other people that are funding the company and stuff like that.

268
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:18,040
So it actually is like, cause like, you know, what if like they want to remove something or if they want to add something that might not be from the vision of the original creator.

269
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,680
So that's why it's understandable why this is still a passion project.

270
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:33,780
And the fact that they're doing all of this due to their passion for this company and the passion for like, uh, the individuals who are a part of like hololive, like the talents and everything.

271
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,000
It is very, um, you know, like the passion of the fans, um, is very admirable and everything.

272
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,200
But yes, I've always wanted to play this game.

273
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,860
Everybody makes it look so fun.

274
00:15:45,040 --> 00:16:02,780
I like watched a couple of streams of people playing this and it's very similar to a, uh, vampire survivors, which is why I was really interested in this because I've seen people play vampire survivors when they were, and then I've only played vampire survivors once among us edition.

275
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,260
So that's why I wanted to play this for a while now.

276
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,720
And, um, it seems like an incredibly addicting game.

277
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,860
Um, and the fact that it still gets updates too.

278
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,820
All right.

279
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,360
What's meta?

280
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,800
I just love you guys are like, no, pick the character that you enjoy.

281
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,800
Click the talent that you enjoy the most.

282
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,740
No, as, as a gamer, it is called pick the character that's meta.

283
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,850
It's all about winning.

284
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,010
I need to know what is meta.

285
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,950
Right now out of the five.

286
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,530
Talents that are here.

287
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,030
Who has, who is the most meta to start out?

288
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,550
Uh, right now is Mori.

289
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:02,890
Okay.

290
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,930
Swings in half circle arc in the front.

291
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,090
Stage mode.

292
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,450
Okay.

293
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,910
Defeat the last boss to complete.

294
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,170
Well, obviously I haven't really unlocked anything yet.

295
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,330
Um, so I guess I'll do the stage mode.

296
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,170
I've okay.

297
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,490
It's like the beginning level of vampire survivors.

298
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,350
All right.

299
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:21,550
Go.

300
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,890
Okay.

301
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,550
W A C left click to toggle or right click to aim.

302
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,010
What left click to toggle.

303
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,270
Oh, what can I aim here?

304
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,150
What do I aim?

305
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,810
Where does the aim part come from?

306
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,550
I guess if I have like a special ability.

307
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,070
Question mark.

308
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,650
Use a controller.

309
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,150
No.

310
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,010
M I K forever.

311
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:47,930
All right.

312
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,270
Nice.

313
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,370
I want to be a controller for it.

314
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,870
Where, where.

315
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,010
You aim your attack, but I can just move around.

316
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,970
I just move around for that.

317
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:57,990
All right.

318
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,710
Give me that box.

319
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,590
Your main weapon can be adjusted.

320
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,910
Oh, okay.

321
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,090
But at the moment, I don't think I have anything.

322
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:05,930
All right.

323
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,110
15% chance to negate one hit.

324
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,950
Uh, uh, when defeating a target, you need to lock it.

325
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,790
You can strafe while attacking.

326
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,890
Right click aim.

327
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,650
You can strafe.

328
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,650
Holy shit.

329
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,850
This game is much more complicated than I thought.

330
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,370
What the fuck.

331
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,690
Okay.

332
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,310
Increase damage.

333
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,670
Oh my god.

334
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,770
I'm so confused.

335
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,050
Oh my god.

336
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:42,910
Who would have thought this game was much more confusing, much more complicated than I expected.

337
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,350
Oh, my gosh.

338
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,330
I remember when I watched Morrie's debut, I like, I think I live tweeted it too.

339
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:50,830
I want to click on that.

340
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,870
I'm pretty...

341
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,310
I'm pretty sure I live tweeted Mori's debut and she...

342
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,710
Let's see... when like Myth first came out.

343
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,230
We maxed out the Scythe, right?

344
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,450
Who?

345
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,210
Okay guys.

346
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,230
I already took one damage because I was fucking around too much.

347
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,470
It's okay.

348
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,190
I have experience.

349
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,110
I played Among Us Vampire Survivors.

350
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,950
It's fine.

351
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,510
Apparently in the meta is to max out the Scythe.

352
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,310
We gotta kill the dead Beats first.

353
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,470
It's okay.

354
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,230
They enjoy it.

355
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,290
I mean they're technically dead already.

356
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,690
So is it really killing them?

357
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:32,950
Alright.

358
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,190
Max out the Scythe.

359
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,770
Oh, this is not good.

360
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,090
This is not good.

361
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,830
This is definitely not good.

362
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,290
Oh, okay.

363
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,450
That was just a bait.

364
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,350
It's just bait.

365
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,450
I mean...

366
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,430
Since they're dead already, it doesn't really matter.

367
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,050
If we kill them again.

368
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,390
Because technically they're dead.

369
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,510
So they just come back to life.

370
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,530
Do they have orbs here too?

371
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,350
Reduce the time between attacks.

372
00:19:59,570 --> 00:19:59,790
Wait.

373
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,630
Four?

374
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,790
Yeah, we're saving them.

375
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,550
Oh, you're right.

376
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,610
We're saving them.

377
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,910
By killing them.

378
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,550
Exactly.

379
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,650
One or three.

380
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,850
All healing is doubled.

381
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,750
Four?

382
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,190
Okay.

383
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:14,970
Four.

384
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:15,990
It's okay.

385
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,670
I let my chat tell me what to do because I can't think for myself.

386
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,150
This is for your own good.

387
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,390
Do not worry!

388
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,070
This is for your own good.

389
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,270
Alright.

390
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:29,630
One.

391
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,910
We're gonna max it out still.

392
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,550
Holy shit.

393
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,450
I'm so fucking strong now.

394
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,790
I think it's like...

395
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,230
The fact that like all this... like all the iFans came together to make this.

396
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,630
Because it's a huge team too.

397
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,010
That made this game.

398
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,190
That was nothing.

399
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,030
I got scammed.

400
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,110
Like the art.

401
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,050
The music.

402
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,650
The gameplay being more...

403
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,630
There's like a home decorating thing!

404
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,670
There's fishing!

405
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,050
There's fucking fishing!

406
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,530
Wait.

407
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:04,970
Is it three?

408
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,290
Wait.

409
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,150
Is this the max?

410
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,810
This is the max, right?

411
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,110
Oh my god.

412
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,770
That's a big guy!

413
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,910
That's a big shrimp.

414
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,470
Oh no no no no no no no no no no!

415
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:21,930
No!

416
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,750
Don't worry, thread the needle.

417
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,510
Okay, don't worry.

418
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,690
We can kill him.

419
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,350
Can't be that bad.

420
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,430
Is that the boss?

421
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,070
The mini boss where he gives you a chest?

422
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,270
I don't know what the hololive equivalent is.

423
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,370
Oh my god, he's so tanky.

424
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,770
He's so fucking tanky.

425
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,290
Alright, we maxed out the scythe.

426
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,670
For Callie, headphones are a good choice because she has a small dead spot in her scythe swing.

427
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,050
When you unlock specials, Callie can do big damage easily.

428
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,190
Thank you for the super chat, Richie.

429
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:55,730
Thank you, thank you.

430
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,750
One?

431
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,930
Increase attack by two.

432
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,430
Okay, one.

433
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:00,830
Alright.

434
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,950
I got this too.

435
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,410
Open.

436
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,030
Hollow's done.

437
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,750
What did I get?

438
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,750
What?

439
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,010
Oh, BL book.

440
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,770
Repels target with orbiting BL books.

441
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,430
What is...

442
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,450
Black licorice?

443
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,750
Wait, BL stands for black licorice, right?

444
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,270
Right, guys?

445
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,870
What else would it stand for?

446
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,450
Yowie?

447
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,210
That's a Y.

448
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,970
That's not yowie.

449
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,170
That starts with a Y.

450
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,910
One, two, three, or four.

451
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,050
Richie, thank you for the super... Oh, I already read that.

452
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,230
Brother, thank you for the one gifted chest.

453
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,070
Thank you, thank you.

454
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:46,750
Two?

455
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,110
When defeating a target, there is 30% chance...

456
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,190
to life steal 2 HP.

457
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,030
If taking a hit while HP is less than 15% chance.

458
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:55,970
Oh, God.

459
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,910
Oh, God.

460
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,630
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

461
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,790
Just gotta get rid of these guys here.

462
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,230
Just keep going, right?

463
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,070
It's okay, I'm gaming.

464
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:03,750
Look at that.

465
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,430
I played Vampire Survivors.

466
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,670
It's okay.

467
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,690
I played...

468
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,870
I played Among Us Vampire Survivors.

469
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,750
I know what I'm doing.

470
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,570
It's pretty easy.

471
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,210
Alright, for each target defeated... I'm gaming.

472
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,290
I already know the strat.

473
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,970
Okay, turn down music one more notch.

474
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,070
Okay, sound guy wants me to turn down music one more.

475
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,150
All healing is double one.

476
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,990
For each target defeated, increase attack.

477
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,870
Okay, I'm gonna do attack.

478
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,730
We're gonna be like...

479
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,050
We're gonna be like a glass cannon.

480
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,350
I can't die if I kill everybody first.

481
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,310
What is this?

482
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,410
Okay.

483
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,430
Sound guy said the music is just a little bit too loud, so I turned it down a little bit.

484
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,490
But if it's now too quiet, let me know.

485
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,030
One or two.

486
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:54,990
Okay.

487
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,630
When do things get harder?

488
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,530
Oh, big taco!

489
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,550
Get over here.

490
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,230
Okay, I never told this to anyone.

491
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,690
But now...

492
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,970
I mean, I can post it now.

493
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,910
Tweet it out now.

494
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,210
But I actually have a...

495
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,270
Oh, wait.

496
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,070
In a minute?

497
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,050
Wait, guys.

498
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:17,970
No, that was a joke.

499
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,810
I don't want things to get a little bit...

500
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,790
Harder, guys.

501
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,450
I'm happy with the current difficulty.

502
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,610
I don't need things to be a little bit harder.

503
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,130
But I actually...

504
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:35,810
Okay, wait.

505
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,530
Let me grab one, two, three, four.

506
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,370
When do you feel like you're on target?

507
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,210
Scythe, swimming, or death?

508
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,530
Oh, this is new!

509
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,050
Death!

510
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,530
Alright, two?

511
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,670
Okay.

512
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,250
I actually own a...

513
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:48,790
A...

514
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,510
Oh my gosh, wait.

515
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,150
I can't think!

516
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,650
Okay, two again?

517
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,910
Alright, when defeating a target, two.

518
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,610
Okay, two.

519
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,050
Alright, now I get to open.

520
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,830
Alright.

521
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:04,730
Anyway!

522
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,530
There's so many things on the screen!

523
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,870
It's so hard to talk!

524
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,470
I actually own...

525
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,710
Okay, headphones.

526
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:16,490
Super headphones.

527
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,190
40% chance to...

528
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,010
Hit and heal 10...

529
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,870
Oh, it's a Supa!

530
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,950
Okay, I'll take it.

531
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,050
Super is good.

532
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,850
I might not play gacha, but I know Super is good.

533
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,190
But I own a little...

534
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,170
A little...

535
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:29,810
A little taco.

536
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,430
A little taco figure on my desk.

537
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,870
Thank you for the five gift this ship!

538
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,190
Thank you!

539
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,930
I can actually show it on Twitter.

540
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,710
I just recorded it.

541
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,290
Thank you!

542
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,410
Oh...

543
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,570
And she is even red!

544
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,190
Thanks for the two.

545
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,350
Okay, three?

546
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:16,990
Three?

547
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,230
Throw an axe at Spylus?

548
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,810
One?

549
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:19,770
Three?

550
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,830
Three?

551
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,710
Three.

552
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,150
Okay.

553
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,110
I'll do three.

554
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,430
Okay, that's fine.

555
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,530
That's fine.

556
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,630
Everything's fine.

557
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,710
It's fine!

558
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,550
They died so fast!

559
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:32,990
It's fine.

560
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,310
Oh, they missed!

561
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,530
Nerds.

562
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,010
I imagine missing.

563
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,890
Alright, increase size of axe by 20.

564
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,810
Gain 1% crit buff every second.

565
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,670
Add one additional book.

566
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,010
Multiply all damage dealt by 1, 2, 3, 2, 1...

567
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,230
One?

568
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,770
Okay.

569
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,350
It's axe time.

570
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:04,200
I hope the music isn't too quiet now and it's at a reasonable...

571
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,190
Wait, I watched Hollowfest!

572
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,210
Okay, give me a second.

573
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:08,470
Let me see.

574
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:08,990
Everyone's gone!

575
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,550
Every time...

576
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:17,570
Every time I wanted to talk, have a conversation, I was like, give me a sec, guys.

577
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,490
We need to think again.

578
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,950
We need to think, guys.

579
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,710
Give me a sec.

580
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,530
There's so many things happening!

581
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,730
I can't have a conversation!

582
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,830
Sorry, I just leveled up.

583
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,350
Oh yeah, I watched...

584
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,590
I watched Hollowfest.

585
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,210
It's actually like...

586
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,370
Oh my god, fuck!

587
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,650
Okay.

588
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:52,730
I know how much work wearing those like 3D shit is.

589
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,950
So like...

590
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:01,030
So the dancing and all that's the... I'm aware how much fucking work all of that is.

591
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,970
So it's always very impressive and like...

592
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,270
I very admire them for able to do all...

593
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,190
The fucking flip!

594
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,350
Holy fuck!

595
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,610
All the cartwheels and stuff.

596
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,410
Alright.

597
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,130
Oh my god.

598
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,890
It's always... It's super fucking impressive.

599
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,250
Cause I like... It is a lot.

600
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,730
Cause like not only that, you have to do like dance classes.

601
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,390
Like... There's like dance classes too.

602
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,030
To be able to dance like that.

603
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:28,950
And...

604
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,830
Like obviously the choreo depends on like...

605
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,670
What they want to do for choreo.

606
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,170
What the fuck?

607
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,330
Where... Where's my sight?

608
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,650
Where am I doing?

609
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,130
Where am I doing?

610
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,350
Deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

611
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,070
Thank you, thank you.

612
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,550
Don't think.

613
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,570
Just jam.

614
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,510
Alright, which one?

615
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,330
3 increases attack size.

616
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,150
Thank you.

617
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:51,610
Thank you.

618
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,870
This is Chat Plays Holocure.

619
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,690
Welcome to Chat Plays Holocure.

620
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,230
I'm the bot here.

621
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,570
Controls for you.

622
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,470
Alright.

623
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,250
Here we go.

624
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,150
Oh hey!

625
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,630
There's a gator.

626
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:10,990
Ohhhhhhh!

627
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,450
Okay, there we go.

628
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,770
We're fine.

629
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,490
We thread the needle.

630
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,770
Okay, I got a little bit distracted there.

631
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,570
But we thread the needle.

632
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,370
I'm full HP!

633
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,590
This is so fucking easy!

634
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,750
That's right.

635
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,730
That's why I'm...

636
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,550
I put my name in a Doki FPS.

637
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,910
Catch me at the leaderboards.

638
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,530
Doki FPS.

639
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,270
Oh please!

640
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,130
Give me the box!

641
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,670
Give me the box!

642
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,510
Let's see.

643
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,090
Reach target.

644
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,470
Why do I even need to read this?

645
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,630
I can just let you guys read this for me.

646
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,410
Those headphones are saving you.

647
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,250
No, I'm saving.

648
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,450
I'm saving the world.

649
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,710
Uh, 3, 2, 1.

650
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,030
Okay, targets will take 15%.

651
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,150
1 for each target.

652
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,690
I see more 3s.

653
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,910
Okay, I see more 3s.

654
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,510
Open!

655
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,250
Open time!

656
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:01,830
Let's see.

657
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,950
All healing is doubled.

658
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,690
I'll take it.

659
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,170
I don't need a thing.

660
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,170
Oh, I got leveled up again!

661
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,510
Uber sheep.

662
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,190
Increased movement speed.

663
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,690
1?

664
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,290
Increases attack size.

665
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,590
1, 2...

666
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,110
I like how someone was like, 1, 2, 3, 4.

667
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,190
Thank you.

668
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,230
Very helpful.

669
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:22,850
Okay, 3.

670
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,370
No!

671
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

672
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,050
Oh, it's fine.

673
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,430
It's fine.

674
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:25,810
We're okay.

675
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,690
We just luckily got health by defeating people.

676
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:30,850
We're fine.

677
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,130
Everything's fine.

678
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,150
I need to like grab some more dolls.

679
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,990
Nope.

680
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:36,970
Nope.

681
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,430
Get out.

682
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:37,870
Back out.

683
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,610
Back out.

684
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,750
What's the lore anyway?

685
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,670
Why are the fans...

686
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,770
I didn't read the beginning.

687
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,190
Pick 5.

688
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,450
Back to thinking for the Akasupa.

689
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:49,910
Thank you.

690
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,530
Thank you.

691
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,190
Let's see.

692
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:53,690
1.

693
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,430
Increased damp.

694
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,070
5.

695
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,830
1.

696
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,110
2.

697
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:57,830
Okay, 1.

698
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,890
I see more 1s.

699
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,430
I know like we all saw the intro, but what is the lore?

700
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,130
I don't know.

701
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,070
It's like anまり mera.

702
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,650
It's like one of my favourite things I've seen.

703
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,490
Oh, cool, cool, cool.

704
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,690
Let's go ahead with the практиc.

705
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:31,810
1.

706
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,050
Coed?

707
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,090
Poorarya.

708
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,150
1.

709
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,730
It's not delusional.

710
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,550
Get it over here, bro.

711
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,130
1.

712
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,190
Get over here.

713
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,150
I'm not afraid of you.

714
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,570
Oh my god, he has a bat.

715
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,330
Why don't they just get a gun?

716
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,830
We need a fan mascot who just holds a gun.

717
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,750
But I think that might get you... might actually get like...

718
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,970
I don't think that's good for merch though.

719
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,050
Wait, they do get guns?

720
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:01,910
Wait a minute!

721
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,310
No!

722
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

723
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,030
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

724
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,630
Okay, we're fine.

725
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:06,990
We're fine.

726
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,590
We're fine.

727
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,210
We're... we're threatening Danita!

728
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,610
We're threatening Danita!

729
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,450
Wait, they do have guns?

730
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:18,930
Alright.

731
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,530
Let's see.

732
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,510
Everyone is meta.

733
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,870
Okay, welcome to America.

734
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,570
One or three?

735
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,650
I'm gonna...

736
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,230
Okay, one.

737
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,070
I see more ones.

738
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:29,750
Oh god.

739
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,750
Oh, I'm so fucked.

740
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,710
I am so fucked up.

741
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,570
That map fucked me up.

742
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,310
I looked away for one second.

743
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,570
Oh my god.

744
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,870
That... that area actually messed me up a lot.

745
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,150
Holy shit.

746
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,310
Okay, I'm back to full HP.

747
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,370
I'm back to full HP!

748
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,650
Agent, thank you for the super chat.

749
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,410
Thank you, thank you.

750
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:52,050
We must cure them from being delusionals with the good old bonk stick.

751
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,070
Alright.

752
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,410
Let's see.

753
00:32:59,510 --> 00:32:59,810
Three?

754
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:00,690
Three.

755
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:00,990
Okay.

756
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,150
That's alright.

757
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,270
Nothing bad happened.

758
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,550
Jesus Christ, chicken.

759
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,650
It's okay.

760
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,250
I'm back to full HP.

761
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,410
It's like... Oh my god.

762
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,370
Why are the KFP so fucking weak?

763
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,450
Okay.

764
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,370
Where's the box?

765
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,590
Where did I miss the box?

766
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,610
One, two, one.

767
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,130
I'm sorry, KFP.

768
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,550
Sorry!

769
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,810
Sorry, I don't get it.

770
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,530
Okay, create the lore accuracy.

771
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,650
I'm just... I... look at... look at...

772
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,170
I'm just asking questions here.

773
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:51,470
I'm just... I'm just asking the questions of what I'm... what's going on on my screen.

774
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,070
They missed two?

775
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,430
Alright.

776
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,470
Oh, nurse is horn, psych-axe, workaholic.

777
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,110
That's me.

778
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,310
Uh...

779
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,050
She's asking dangerous questions.

780
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,290
Uh... four.

781
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:08,990
Okay.

782
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,050
Nice.

783
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,110
Oh my god, that's all of it?

784
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,550
I swear I had more.

785
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,090
I swear... I thought I had more arrows.

786
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,970
Or gain 15...

787
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,490
Peaky... Oh, uh...

788
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,010
Thank you for the 50 gifted chefs!

789
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,090
Thank you, thank you!

790
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,450
I really appreciate it.

791
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,190
Thank you so much!

792
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,670
Okay, see more twos.

793
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,170
Oh, and then we have more.

794
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,590
Oh my god, I'm looking up like crazy.

795
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,710
Am I doing well for my first run?

796
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,790
Or am I...

797
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,750
I can't tell!

798
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:42,270
I can't tell if I'm doing well for my first run or if it's just like that.

799
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,630
Uh... three or... uh... so far?

800
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,690
You're doing fine.

801
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,350
Decent?

802
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,610
Guys, come on!

803
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,730
Our first... you're right.

804
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,930
Our first run.

805
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,150
Uh...

806
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,190
Let's see... one...

807
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,170
Alright, nice.

808
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,810
Holy shit, my axe is huge now.

809
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,070
I mean, it's the first stage?

810
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,570
Yeah, but like... but like this is my first try.

811
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,630
Guys, as a...

812
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:27,330
Guys, as a streamer, I said that so you can give me an ego boost, you know?

813
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:37,750
Yes, guys, you know, whenever a streamer is like, Hey guys, am I doing well for my first try?

814
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:44,750
Your... your reply would be like, Oh my gosh, Doki, you're doing amazing!

815
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,910
You're... wait, what?

816
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,590
Wait, okay, I can dodge that.

817
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,310
It's like Touhou.

818
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,530
You'd be like, wow!

819
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,650
Doki, you're doing so good!

820
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,790
It's like you're... you're a fucking gamer!

821
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,430
You're supposed to be like boosting my ego here.

822
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,450
Can I kill this thing?

823
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,410
I can't tell!

824
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,490
I don't know if she...

825
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,250
Yeah, yeah, I can.

826
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,330
They have a... they have a shield.

827
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,930
That means I can kill this thing.

828
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,130
Okay, nice.

829
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,530
Easy.

830
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:19,690
Alright.

831
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,270
Open.

832
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,630
Uh...

833
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,590
Oh, hey, nice.

834
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:25,930
Nice.

835
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,650
More black licorice.

836
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,010
Uh...

837
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,490
It's a halfway boss.

838
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:30,910
We're halfway!

839
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,670
But we don't like to lie.

840
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,730
What do you mean?

841
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:37,830
Four.

842
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,850
Alright, more books.

843
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,390
More black licorice.

844
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,670
Man, I sure do love black licorice.

845
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,290
Because what else would BL stand for?

846
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:47,530
Uh...

847
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,910
Oh, we can max it out!

848
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,250
Okay, let's max this out.

849
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,370
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

850
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,130
Thank you, thank you!

851
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,890
Your micro could be better.

852
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,430
Callie is carrying you!

853
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,150
Look!

854
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,130
I'm just playing meta!

855
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,950
There is nothing wrong with playing meta!

856
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,090
Whoa, what's this?

857
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,690
What is this?

858
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,570
Combo?

859
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,330
Nah.

860
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,270
What does... what does this do?

861
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,450
Is this good?

862
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,830
Lab?

863
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,810
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

864
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,510
Black licorice.

865
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,550
What is it?

866
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,850
Black licorice?

867
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,110
Um...

868
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,950
That... I don't know if you guys know what that means.

869
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:39,430
But it's like when two black licorices love each other very much.

870
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,550
You try to eat two at the same time.

871
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,330
That's what it means, chat.

872
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,610
That's...

873
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,750
That's what it means.

874
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,210
Um...

875
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,930
Thank you, thank you for the magenta soup!

876
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:55,890
But thank you, thank you!

877
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,770
Don't know if you noticed, but items that have a star belong to that specific talent.

878
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,190
So you can grab them, upgrade them, while worrying about them taking up a weapon slot.

879
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:02,370
Oh!

880
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,610
That's really interesting.

881
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,850
Thank you for the super chat.

882
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,570
Thank you, thank you!

883
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:05,930
One.

884
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,770
Oh, so this doesn't take my weapon slot.

885
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,170
Because I'm Callie.

886
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:11,470
Alright.

887
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,730
Thank you guys.

888
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,450
Thank you for...

889
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,290
Oh my god, I'm...

890
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,370
I can just stand still.

891
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,170
I don't even know where my weapon is anymore.

892
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,090
I'm right here.

893
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,050
I'm right here.

894
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,590
I can just stand still.

895
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,450
I can't wait.

896
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,270
You know, I can't wait for the real gameplay.

897
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:25,810
Fishing.

898
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:26,650
I...

899
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,230
I'm so excited.

900
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,230
I can't wait, chat.

901
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,210
The real gameplay.

902
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,170
Fishing!

903
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,050
I am the weapon.

904
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,930
The endless black licorice!

905
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,090
Oh my god, it's like I'm opening my own chocolate factory.

906
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,510
Uh...

907
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,890
Fishing is hard?

908
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,130
How?

909
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:49,790
It's fishing!

910
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,030
Is that...

911
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,950
It's like the best...

912
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,590
You can't make fishing difficult.

913
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,470
It's fishing!

914
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,890
Nightly milk.

915
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:59,050
Increase attack size and knockback effects of weapons by 20%.

916
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,610
Also increases pick up range by 50%.

917
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,090
Alright, we're halfway point.

918
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,430
10 more minutes of...

919
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,550
Ooh.

920
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,790
Okay.

921
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,910
Oh yeah.

922
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,770
Oh my god.

923
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,390
Hell yeah.

924
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,150
This is it.

925
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,530
I can't see anything.

926
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,150
I can't see the enemies.

927
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,010
I can't see the enemies.

928
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,490
I can't see anything at all.

929
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,810
Oh god.

930
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,770
Oh my god.

931
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,050
Okay.

932
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,570
I made it.

933
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,230
It's actually so difficult.

934
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:27,930
I...

935
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,190
I...

936
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,050
Where am I?

937
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,210
Where am I?

938
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,470
Holy shit.

939
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,810
There's too many things swinging.

940
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,750
Reduce opacity.

941
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,670
Wait, I can do that?

942
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,510
Okay.

943
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,130
Reduce opacity.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,870
Oh my...

945
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,470
Oh my god.

946
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:43,950
Thank god.

947
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:44,810
Thank you guys.

948
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,590
This is so much better.

949
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,990
I can actually see now.

950
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,990
There's so many questions.

951
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,050
Quality of life stuff.

952
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,430
That's really helpful.

953
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:54,970
Okay.

954
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:55,930
Threading the needle.

955
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:56,890
Whoa.

956
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,690
Whoa.

957
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,290
Alright.

958
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,870
Honestly, I'm surprised.

959
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,050
I'm surprised that I did as well as I thought I did.

960
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,710
Wait.

961
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,050
You can do that?

962
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,890
What a streamer.

963
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,030
Three.

964
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,810
Drop lava on the ground.

965
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:20,990
Okay.

966
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,070
Well.

967
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,130
That's good.

968
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:24,290
Oh.

969
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:24,650
Thank god.

970
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,850
We're doing it.

971
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:26,850
Oh.

972
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,390
There's a big clock!

973
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:28,770
Hello.

974
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,150
It's time to ... It's time to get you out.

975
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:34,690
Get out of here.

976
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,630
Can't.

977
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,370
There can only be one big clock.

978
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,310
Get out.

979
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,310
Down with the clock.

980
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:50,110
I'm always afraid of saying clock because I can slip up and say the other.

981
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:50,850
Haha.

982
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,610
The giant big clock.

983
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,330
Nice clock, bro.

984
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,630
Nice clock.

985
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,870
Okay.

986
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,670
What do we get?

987
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,890
Oh, a nurse's horn.

988
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,430
Level 2.

989
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,030
I guess we should take it.

990
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,290
Because we already have it.

991
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:12,750
What?

992
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,270
I'm just talking about clocks.

993
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,530
How is he going to tell the time?

994
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,330
The bigger the clock, the easier it is to tell the time.

995
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,390
That's really...

996
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,150
They don't call me the big Ben for nothing.

997
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,410
Thank you for the super chat.

998
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:35,710
Thank you.

999
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:40,250
You missed my first super once you're back in the main menu, click the achievement section.

1000
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,030
It'll tell you how to unlock weapons and items.

1001
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,750
Thank you for the super chat.

1002
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,090
Thank you.

1003
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,950
I don't need to have the game tell me.

1004
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,330
I have chat to tell me and it's like instant.

1005
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,330
Who needs...

1006
00:41:53,950 --> 00:42:00,450
Who needs to have the video game tell me what to do when we're doing chat plays holocure?

1007
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:06,330
That's actually so nice that you can decrease the opacity of the attacks.

1008
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:12,470
Because like... that was like one of my biggest gripes with... wait, can I do more?

1009
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,590
Upgrade?

1010
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,990
Oh, what do we upgrade?

1011
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,570
Imagine reading.

1012
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,250
Exactly.

1013
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,430
We don't need to read.

1014
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,530
Let's see.

1015
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,270
The scythe?

1016
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,630
Upgrade to scythe and... Oh I can upgrade!

1017
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,810
Oh yeah, up scythe.

1018
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,590
I'll do the...

1019
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,690
Wait, spider?

1020
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,230
Lava?

1021
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,730
Well it's too late.

1022
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,430
Wait, cast?

1023
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,990
Okay, upgrade.

1024
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,010
Yay!

1025
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,630
I got an achievement!

1026
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:45,710
Let's go!

1027
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:49,390
Yay!

1028
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,290
Oh my god, they have clothes now.

1029
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,550
What are you doing?

1030
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:53,730
Why do you have clothes?

1031
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,530
Oh, it's because of the song!

1032
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,830
I understand that reference.

1033
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,690
Oh, it's over here.

1034
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,710
Okay, nice we dodged it.

1035
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,450
We'll give you clothes.

1036
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:10,970
Okay, nice.

1037
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,150
I was worried about having the tree block me.

1038
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:14,870
Q?

1039
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,110
Oh, is that my alt?

1040
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,010
I don't need to use the Q.

1041
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,410
It's like... Oh, wait.

1042
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,230
I thought you were talking about the MV!

1043
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,790
For some reason I thought you meant...

1044
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:31,450
Because Overwatch Ultimate and Apex Ultimate is the Q button.

1045
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,550
So I was like, I have an alt?

1046
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,670
But you're talking about the music video Q.

1047
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,430
Which makes a lot more sense now.

1048
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,350
Sorry, I had gamer brain on.

1049
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,010
I heard this game does have alt though.

1050
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,930
So then I honestly thought you wanted me to press Q.

1051
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,390
I know this has alt, so I honestly thought you were like...

1052
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,430
Guys, alt, alt!

1053
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,610
There's so many people!

1054
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,070
You should alt.

1055
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:02,170
Alt!

1056
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,570
Increase area.

1057
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,650
I do have an alt though.

1058
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,950
I have to buy alt?

1059
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,670
Oh my god.

1060
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:16,650
Capitalism.

1061
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,050
You can't even escape capitalism in VTubers.

1062
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,050
You never escape capitalism.

1063
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,330
Can't believe it.

1064
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,010
Pay the Q.

1065
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:37,330
Pay my imaginary currency because the creator won't accept anybody's money.

1066
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:38,750
Alright.

1067
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:43,670
I'll just kill these trans first before I go for the box.

1068
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,370
Oh nice.

1069
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,790
Okay, that's a little bit too many.

1070
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:52,670
Fake capitalism!

1071
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,590
That is worse than real capitalism.

1072
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,290
Because it's a choice.

1073
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,050
Because it's a choice.

1074
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:02,190
Oh my god.

1075
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,270
I'm like, fucked.

1076
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,310
There's a lot of dead meats and shrimps on me right now.

1077
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,710
Uh...

1078
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,330
Okay.

1079
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:08,950
Nice.

1080
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,130
We're fine.

1081
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:10,750
Yay!

1082
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:11,310
Woah!

1083
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,230
Sorry, we're back to full HP.

1084
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,530
We have to head downstairs though because...

1085
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:23,570
I need to figure out a way to head downstairs because there's the other box over there that I kept.

1086
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,310
I need to get the other box.

1087
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,010
There it is.

1088
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,710
Yeah, I was trying to get the other box.

1089
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,030
Okay.

1090
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:32,570
Increase damage.

1091
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:32,970
Nice!

1092
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:35,530
Alright.

1093
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,870
Yeah, we got circled around!

1094
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:42,490
Uh...

1095
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,450
Max out her main weapon and get the trumpet sticker.

1096
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,070
Thank me later for...

1097
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:49,610
Alright.

1098
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:50,110
Nice.

1099
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,370
Oh hey!

1100
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,270
This is saplings.

1101
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,870
Wait, is that what they look like?

1102
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:58,930
I thought they...

1103
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,750
I thought they were just like seeds.

1104
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:02,130
Hahaha!

1105
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:03,830
Hahaha!

1106
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,690
Alright, and then there's the humans.

1107
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,130
I think like...

1108
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,130
When you become a VTuber, one of the hardest things...

1109
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,830
Is to think of...

1110
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:16,450
Oh no, please.

1111
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,210
Please, I was trying to have a conversation!

1112
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,050
Please!

1113
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,110
Why every time?

1114
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:20,930
Hahaha!

1115
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,550
Why every time?

1116
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,850
Why I have a conversation?

1117
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:25,830
Hahaha!

1118
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,250
Hahaha!

1119
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:27,490
Hahaha!

1120
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:29,830
Okay.

1121
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:30,630
Okay.

1122
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:31,150
Anyway.

1123
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,210
Anyway, as I was saying...

1124
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,150
I think one of the hardest things ever...

1125
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,130
As a...

1126
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,130
As a...

1127
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,950
As a VTuber...

1128
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,790
Is when you have to think of like...

1129
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,010
Good fan names.

1130
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,050
Hahaha!

1131
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,010
And also like...

1132
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,630
Fan designs too.

1133
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:49,450
Like the...

1134
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,050
To have like a mascot representing your fans.

1135
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,550
That's like one of the most difficult things.

1136
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,050
It's cause it's all about branding!

1137
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,230
Hahaha!

1138
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,450
It's all... I fucking hate branding!

1139
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:02,350
Hahaha!

1140
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:03,570
Hahaha!

1141
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,110
Three.

1142
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,150
Okay, increase damage.

1143
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,150
I hate branding.

1144
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,170
Cause it's like...

1145
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,270
You wanna be like...

1146
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,770
You wanna be like the next Hello Kitty.

1147
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:14,390
Hahaha!

1148
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,290
Oh god, where?

1149
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:16,750
Where?

1150
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:17,170
Where?

1151
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,170
Oh god, okay.

1152
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,110
Oh my god, there's way too many people!

1153
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,030
Okay, here we go.

1154
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,310
And there's like pillars too.

1155
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:23,750
Please.

1156
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,450
Please.

1157
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,150
I'm trying to talk about...

1158
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,810
Branding!

1159
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,950
Please don't want it to be too complicated.

1160
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,030
Cause you want the fan mascots...

1161
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,210
To be easy to draw.

1162
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,890
But you also want it to be cute.

1163
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,730
But you don't want it to be too girly.

1164
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,890
Because then...

1165
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:39,530
Hahaha!

1166
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,430
Cause you want the fan mascots...

1167
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:43,750
To appeal for both...

1168
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,070
For both boys and girls.

1169
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,850
So it's like... Oh my god.

1170
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:48,050
No!

1171
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,210
Leave me alone!

1172
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:49,850
Okay.

1173
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,310
What did you...

1174
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,970
You dropped three things.

1175
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:55,910
Hahaha!

1176
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:57,710
Alright.

1177
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:59,610
Alright, what do we...

1178
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,710
What do we do?

1179
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:01,110
Three?

1180
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:01,910
The lava?

1181
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,030
Is it lava time?

1182
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,030
It's lava time.

1183
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,250
Oh, and it's free!

1184
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,390
Oh god, please.

1185
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:08,810
I have so many arrows.

1186
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:10,790
Okay, here we go.

1187
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,730
Please, let me have this!

1188
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:16,630
Whatever this is!

1189
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,010
Okay.

1190
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:19,190
Cooking?

1191
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,790
Alright, spider cooking.

1192
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,690
Oh!

1193
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,410
Alright, nice.

1194
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,050
We're fine.

1195
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,270
We're alive.

1196
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:27,430
We're alive.

1197
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:28,450
The best thing about...

1198
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,810
Holocure is that like...

1199
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,510
It'll always be update, right?

1200
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,030
Right, Kay?

1201
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,630
Hahaha!

1202
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,090
Hahaha!

1203
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,870
This game will always be getting updates.

1204
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:41,530
Right?

1205
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,070
Right?

1206
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:42,710
Right, Kay?

1207
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:43,750
Hahaha!

1208
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,010
Hahaha!

1209
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:46,650
Because...

1210
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,730
Because there's always gonna be...

1211
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,290
New members coming in.

1212
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,930
So that means this game will always have...

1213
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,090
Uh... will always have updates.

1214
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,550
And I think that's really great.

1215
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,290
Because... and the fact that it's free too.

1216
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,890
Oh god.

1217
00:48:59,050 --> 00:48:59,890
Oh god.

1218
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:00,350
Ohhhhh!

1219
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:01,810
It's fine.

1220
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:02,290
We're fine.

1221
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,070
This game is getting a little bit harder now.

1222
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,210
This game is...

1223
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,590
No pressure or anything.

1224
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:08,290
Of course.

1225
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:08,810
No pressure.

1226
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,050
Hahaha!

1227
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:13,250
Hahaha!

1228
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:14,790
Alright.

1229
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:17,430
Uh...

1230
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,330
Which one?

1231
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:20,950
3?

1232
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:21,950
Increase the frequency?

1233
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:22,530
Alright.

1234
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,090
Wait, 1 minute left?

1235
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:24,790
Wait, really?

1236
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,070
No!

1237
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,290
I should have run endless!

1238
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,650
This actually is pretty addicting.

1239
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,050
But I don't think I should do endless when I...

1240
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,390
Um... don't even have a fucking ult yet.

1241
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,230
Uh...

1242
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:37,850
Let's see...

1243
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,110
Sean, thank you for the super chat.

1244
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:39,750
Thank you, thank you.

1245
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,910
Fun fact, back when this first launched, Kiara was pretty low tier.

1246
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:46,430
Kiara then persuaded the dev and quickly updated her in a patch.

1247
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,570
Now she's probably one of the easiest for beginners.

1248
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,490
Thank you for the super chat.

1249
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,230
Thank you, thank you.

1250
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,090
That's interesting.

1251
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:58,670
I mean, I guess because they're based off of like, you know, actual talents, they can just be like, why does my character suck?

1252
00:49:58,850 --> 00:49:59,250
And then...

1253
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,210
And then...

1254
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,330
And then get...

1255
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:08,390
And then be like... get like patched to become the beefiest fucking character in the game.

1256
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:09,310
Hahaha!

1257
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:10,710
Hahaha!

1258
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,950
It's just that easy.

1259
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,310
But then there's like the whole morality of that.

1260
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:17,610
Hahaha!

1261
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:19,470
Hahaha!

1262
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:21,510
Hahaha!

1263
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,430
Yeah, give me buff.

1264
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,930
Make me the strongest character in the game.

1265
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:28,290
Okay.

1266
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:29,750
It's okay, we're fine.

1267
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,530
Everything is fine.

1268
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,140
I mean...

1269
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:36,840
Hahaha!

1270
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,060
Hahaha!

1271
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,420
If I have a character based off of me and I was an OP as fuck during launch, of course I'd...

1272
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,800
I'd put peer pressure to do that too.

1273
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,500
Do I just die?

1274
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,280
I think I just die, right?

1275
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,880
Oh no.

1276
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,920
This is way too many people.

1277
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,400
Oh, the arrow.

1278
00:50:59,520 --> 00:50:59,780
Fuck!

1279
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,880
I forgot about the arrow!

1280
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,100
Gamers don't look...

1281
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,120
You have to tell me these things earlier!

1282
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,300
Gamers don't look...

1283
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:07,720
Oh shit.

1284
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,880
Oh, that's a...

1285
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,420
Oh no, big o... No!

1286
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,420
Big Omi, please!

1287
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,000
Please!

1288
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,980
Let me get the arrow!

1289
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,980
Oh, okay, okay.

1290
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,400
She has...

1291
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:15,900
a cooldown.

1292
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,840
Big Omi has a cooldown.

1293
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,340
Big Omi.

1294
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,360
Oh, she's dead.

1295
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,220
I killed Big Omi.

1296
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,600
Okay.

1297
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,460
Nice.

1298
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,000
I had small knockback.

1299
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,400
Oh shit, wait, no I didn't...

1300
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,240
No, I didn't kill her!

1301
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:32,980
She fucking...

1302
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,640
She's gonna pound me!

1303
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,600
Okay.

1304
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,100
What do I get?

1305
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,680
Uh, a four.

1306
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,320
Okay, guys, we gotta run.

1307
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,500
We gotta run.

1308
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,460
Big Omi's coming.

1309
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:45,680
It's fine.

1310
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,260
Just keep running.

1311
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,060
Just keep running.

1312
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,380
Oh god, we'll go right...

1313
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,440
Why did I go right?

1314
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,100
We'll go down.

1315
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:01,320
Okay, we just have to, like, make sure that our main attack is on her at all times, so we don't have to...

1316
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,580
Oh god, I keep accidentally clicking it!

1317
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,220
I'm just reflexively clicking my buttons when I don't need to.

1318
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,480
It just locks the crosshair.

1319
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,360
Wait, why the fuck would I need controller?

1320
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,140
Mouse and keyboard is, like, doable.

1321
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,260
Does controller actually make you a better player in this game?

1322
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,160
I don't understand.

1323
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,320
Where?

1324
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,100
Oh, there's the arrow!

1325
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,900
Wait, we have to kill Big Omi first.

1326
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,720
Because she's closer.

1327
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,800
And she has to be close to dying, right?

1328
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,900
I'm following the arrow.

1329
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,980
Guys, you have to yell at me if I don't follow the arrow.

1330
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,320
Oh god, that was scary.

1331
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:36,960
I thought I died.

1332
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:37,520
I...

1333
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,300
...

1334
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:38,760
...

1335
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,200
...

1336
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,440
...

1337
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,180
...

1338
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:47,540
Let's see.

1339
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:47,900
Three?

1340
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:49,560
Two?

1341
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,100
Okay, three.

1342
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,340
Wait, she's the end boss?

1343
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:51,900
Oh, okay.

1344
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,420
Alright.

1345
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,880
Before I kill her, I must loot.

1346
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,580
Like a true gamer.

1347
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,720
Oh, it's a gold anvil!

1348
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,480
...

1349
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,220
Okay.

1350
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,640
Oh god.

1351
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,140
Alright.

1352
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,540
How do we do this?

1353
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,320
What is the best combo?

1354
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,740
I'm also sort of getting locked in right now.

1355
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:08,880
...

1356
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,000
...

1357
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,740
Three?

1358
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,700
And then...

1359
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,140
...

1360
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,060
Which one?

1361
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:17,980
...

1362
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,060
One plus two?

1363
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,480
Wait, what?

1364
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,960
Oh, one...

1365
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,140
... One and two?

1366
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,140
But I can only do one!

1367
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,560
Oh, not three?

1368
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,480
How do I cancel?

1369
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,520
Oh, one and two.

1370
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,080
There you go.

1371
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:32,780
This?

1372
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:33,420
Okay.

1373
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,840
What does this make?

1374
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,140
...

1375
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,740
Unknown side effects if consumed.

1376
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,800
What kind of unknown side effects?

1377
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,120
Alright.

1378
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:43,760
Now we're good.

1379
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,180
We should be good now.

1380
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,900
... We have like...

1381
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,040
... We have no more arrows.

1382
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,040
It's just big Ame.

1383
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,640
... Yay!

1384
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,860
... Let's see.

1385
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,220
Electric heart.

1386
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,160
Thank you for the super chat.

1387
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,060
Thank you thank you.

1388
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,760
KFP uses their own KFP as food.

1389
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,980
Do you really think Yara would care about something like morels?

1390
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,520
... Hey!

1391
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,180
Oh shit!

1392
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,040
I did it!

1393
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:09,680
I did it!

1394
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,260
First try!

1395
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:12,820
Yay!

1396
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,700
I got so... I got like twen... fifth... like... not... okay.

1397
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,300
I got like...

1398
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,260
like ten achievements from that.

1399
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,420
Alright, do I go back to the main menu?

1400
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,520
Main menu and then... I heard you can gacha for other characters.

1401
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,980
Now buy special.

1402
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,440
Main menu, right?

1403
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,020
Increase haste by 10%.

1404
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,600
Shoot a powerful laser beam through the microphone.

1405
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,400
Blacksmith gear, credit card, gorilla paw, hollow house.

1406
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,400
Oh, I got more stages.

1407
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,580
Oh my god, I unlocked everything.

1408
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,500
Okay, shop.

1409
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,400
Uh, upgrades.

1410
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,300
How do I queue?

1411
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,240
Special attack.

1412
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,060
Oh, this is the... this is the alt, right?

1413
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,940
Is this alt?

1414
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,420
Alt.

1415
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,500
Buy.

1416
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,940
Is there anything else I should buy?

1417
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:08,600
Uh...

1418
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,060
Is there anything else?

1419
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:12,860
Enchants.

1420
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,760
Enchantments?

1421
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,100
Here?

1422
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:14,780
Alright.

1423
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,480
And then... stamp... uh...

1424
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,080
Stickers?

1425
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,240
Which one's stickers?

1426
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,700
Oh, is that stickers?

1427
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,960
Drop by target, you can modify the main... okay.

1428
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,720
Is there anything else I need?

1429
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,960
Or is it gacha time?

1430
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:37,020
Is it... a lot worth gains... uh...

1431
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,580
Is it gacha time, or do you want me to unlock anything else?

1432
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,120
Gacha?

1433
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,640
Alright, what's armory?

1434
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,300
Oh it's just the information.

1435
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,800
Okay.

1436
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,080
And then... this has the best character, right?

1437
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,060
This is full meta, right?

1438
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,540
This is full meta, right?

1439
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,140
Nexi, thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

1440
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,100
Thank you, thank you!

1441
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,400
Which is full meta.

1442
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,100
It's all about the meta.

1443
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,100
It's all about the meta.

1444
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,600
It's all about the meta.

1445
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,100
Okay.

1446
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,700
Alright, we're gonna... Oh, debut.

1447
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,140
Alright.

1448
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,680
Okay.

1449
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,300
Oh, hey!

1450
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,180
Hey!

1451
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,060
Alright, you're not meta.

1452
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,480
I'm sorry.

1453
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,160
No!

1454
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,160
I need meta!

1455
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,240
No, crony!

1456
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,080
Why?!

1457
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,680
Are you serious?!

1458
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,380
I needed like...

1459
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,380
one of these three!

1460
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,760
And I get YouTube twice?!

1461
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,980
Oh my god!

1462
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,760
That's not fair!

1463
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,480
I just wanted meta!

1464
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,740
God, I'm so unlucky.

1465
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,620
I can't believe it.

1466
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,960
I just wanted meta.

1467
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,660
I just wanted...

1468
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,600
Metaaaa!

1469
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,120
Alright.

1470
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,180
Is...

1471
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,120
Is Calliope still meta?

1472
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,100
You know what?

1473
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:14,580
Alright.

1474
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
Ah, fuck it.

1475
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,260
Let's go.

1476
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,560
Alright, bae.

1477
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,500
You...

1478
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,120
You're gonna do meta.

1479
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,340
We don't have meta, so...

1480
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:22,980
Wait.

1481
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,000
Recommended upgrades.

1482
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,600
I don't need that.

1483
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,120
I can do it.

1484
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,440
Alright, bae.

1485
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,920
You might not be meta.

1486
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,260
But we don't need it.

1487
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,840
We're gonna...

1488
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,980
We don't need it.

1489
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,580
We don't need it, bae!

1490
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,220
You're not meta!

1491
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:38,660
It's okay!

1492
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,480
We're gonna be that...

1493
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,400
We're gonna be that Overwatch one trick.

1494
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,540
That tour-drawing one trick.

1495
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,160
Oh.

1496
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,780
I do need it?

1497
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,540
No, we don't.

1498
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,600
We don't need it.

1499
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,020
Bae is a glass cannon?

1500
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:55,900
Perfect!

1501
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,740
I love glass cannon builds.

1502
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,300
Okay.

1503
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,240
Um...

1504
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,140
Well, obviously, I have nothing else to upgrade.

1505
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,680
Wait, bae is not his load tier?

1506
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,600
Bae!

1507
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,180
Tell the devs to buff you!

1508
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,000
You have the power!

1509
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:24,400
You have the power to tell the devs to give you a buff!

1510
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,660
Okay.

1511
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,320
Um...

1512
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:32,720
Uh...

1513
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,340
Fan, thank you for the magenta super!

1514
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,300
Thank you, thank you!

1515
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,440
Fun fact about the gacha.

1516
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,420
You can do multiple pulls in one go.

1517
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,140
Before you pull, there's an arrow indicating you can pull from 1 to 10.

1518
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,240
Well, based on by a thousand holocoins.

1519
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,920
Thank you, super chat!

1520
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,420
Thank you, thank you!

1521
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:46,680
Alright.

1522
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,600
It's fine.

1523
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,100
I'm clearly very lucky, right?

1524
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,180
It's not like...

1525
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,720
This is it.

1526
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,980
This is the day my luck turns around!

1527
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,860
This will be the day!

1528
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,640
Wait, what do you mean I just went for it?

1529
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,600
I got...

1530
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,080
No!

1531
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,320
What do you mean?

1532
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,740
I literally ran...

1533
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,760
Oh my god!

1534
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,140
What do you mean no?

1535
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,540
I just looked at my chat!

1536
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,620
I just activated hide mode?

1537
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,380
Okay.

1538
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,520
But...

1539
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,200
Now my luck starts turning around.

1540
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:35,960
Now!

1541
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,160
This is it.

1542
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,920
This is when my luck starts turning around, chat.

1543
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,440
This is the moment!

1544
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,260
It might not have been like...

1545
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,680
It might not be like just now.

1546
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,000
But this is the moment.

1547
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,500
What the... I didn't read!

1548
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,280
I didn't read the HALU!

1549
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,440
What does HALU do?

1550
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,760
I actually didn't read!

1551
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,340
Oh, my god.

1552
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,200
I read the chat.

1553
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,520
Increase the regular VASPONs more.

1554
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,480
Gain one for every four targets defeated since taking this...

1555
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,500
WHAT?!

1556
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,420
Increase regular VASPONs for...

1557
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,160
No!

1558
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,340
I'm not taking four!

1559
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,540
I'm not taking...

1560
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,800
Okay, now I read it.

1561
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,540
I read it for real now.

1562
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,400
I read it for real now.

1563
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,280
Guys, it's okay.

1564
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,480
This time I've read it, chat.

1565
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,960
This time, we're not going to...

1566
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,100
Alright, two.

1567
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,980
I'll just hard upgrade the dice.

1568
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,000
And because this is her...

1569
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,360
Because this is her item.

1570
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,700
Alright, it's fine.

1571
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,040
We're fine.

1572
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,140
I'm just going to go full on on the dice.

1573
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,680
Nothing can go wrong with that, right?

1574
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,980
Nothing can go wrong with that, right?

1575
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,040
Oh my god, please.

1576
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,440
Oh god, okay.

1577
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:07,860
It's fine.

1578
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,560
I saved the burger up top.

1579
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:10,780
It's okay.

1580
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,340
Now I know to ignore every like, holo item for reals now.

1581
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:15,920
Oh god.

1582
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,000
It's fine.

1583
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,620
He's not going to blow up.

1584
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,140
Oh my god, this level.

1585
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,380
This level.

1586
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,600
Oh no.

1587
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:27,700
No.

1588
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,400
Babe, please.

1589
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:33,700
Alright.

1590
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,460
We go full in on the dice.

1591
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,100
Oh no.

1592
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,400
There must be another burger.

1593
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,400
Where the fuck are the burgers?

1594
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,020
Oh, there it is.

1595
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,100
I knew I saved the burger.

1596
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,220
Okay.

1597
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:44,940
Nice.

1598
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:45,700
Alright, we're good now.

1599
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:46,780
Oh, gotcha.

1600
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,400
Is that gotcha?

1601
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,140
What is this?

1602
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:50,940
Size to increase?

1603
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,480
Size to increase?

1604
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,060
Yeah.

1605
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:55,500
Yeah?

1606
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,920
Apply this stamp to the weapon?

1607
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:58,860
Apply it.

1608
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,420
Oh, okay.

1609
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:02,960
Nice.

1610
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:03,900
Finish.

1611
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,340
Alright.

1612
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,520
There you go.

1613
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,180
Do I have alt now?

1614
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:07,640
Oh, I do!

1615
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,040
Okay.

1616
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,420
We're not going to use alt yet.

1617
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,400
We have to like, wait.

1618
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,880
We have to be patient, guys.

1619
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,820
We need to find another burger.

1620
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,020
It's okay.

1621
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,580
We gotta wait.

1622
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,820
We can wait.

1623
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,080
We have to find another burger.

1624
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,560
Okay, we're slowly...

1625
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,740
We're slowly...

1626
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,280
We're slowly turning back okay.

1627
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,700
What is it?

1628
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:34,940
Two?

1629
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:35,420
Okay.

1630
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,280
Two.

1631
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,860
Use it and go le- Okay.

1632
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:40,600
One.

1633
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:41,760
Increase critical- Oh!

1634
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,100
Critical hit chance is always good.

1635
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:43,960
Wait, is this a boss?

1636
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,780
What do I do?

1637
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:46,620
Oh shit!

1638
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,460
Oh, that's what I do!

1639
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,240
We're not doing four.

1640
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:51,640
Okay.

1641
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,280
You can't trick me this time.

1642
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,180
You can not.

1643
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,240
You can not trick me this time.

1644
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,820
I see ones, okay.

1645
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,920
Oh, I got THREE!

1646
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,720
I'll take all of that.

1647
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,760
Throw an axe?

1648
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:08,020
Fine.

1649
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:08,760
Might as well.

1650
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,100
Just take everything.

1651
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,020
I'm fine with that.

1652
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:14,700
Alright.

1653
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,520
What do you want?

1654
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:19,740
Uhhh...

1655
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,560
Oh baby, a triple!

1656
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:23,860
V for XP?

1657
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,360
One?

1658
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,040
No!

1659
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,300
I almost...

1660
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,540
Sorry, I almost... I actually almost clicked one.

1661
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,260
I'm not clicking one.

1662
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,100
That was close.

1663
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,120
You guys almost got me there.

1664
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,800
Oh my god, is that chicken?

1665
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:42,860
Oh thank god.

1666
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,660
Is this one hit if the player does not get attacked by target?

1667
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,400
The target may become frozen.

1668
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,240
I might as well.

1669
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,240
Fuck it.

1670
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,820
Just put everything.

1671
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,180
Oh, I am not doing okay right now.

1672
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,020
Bae... Bae why?

1673
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:03,760
Oh god.

1674
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:04,640
It's okay.

1675
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,260
Do you have a head left?

1676
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,300
It's like the li- I just realized it's like the library level.

1677
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,480
I need more burgers.

1678
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,680
I really need more burgers.

1679
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,220
Okay.

1680
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,200
Fine.

1681
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,320
We can't go through this?

1682
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:15,600
No.

1683
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,460
Oh no.

1684
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,680
Oh, that's not even a burger!

1685
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,100
Okay.

1686
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:23,980
Please.

1687
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,020
Oh please have mercy.

1688
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,820
What is the- is he spawning more?

1689
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,380
Oh no please!

1690
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,340
Okay.

1691
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,420
We're going to go left.

1692
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,260
No!

1693
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,400
Bae please!

1694
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,720
Oh okay.

1695
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,160
We killed him.

1696
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,060
Rest in peace all alive.

1697
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,060
Burgers!

1698
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,100
Oh god.

1699
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,480
Where is my ult?

1700
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,460
Oh god.

1701
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,440
Okay...

1702
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:54,940
Uh...

1703
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,600
So...

1704
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,600
I can't!

1705
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,860
There's so many things in front of me!

1706
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:05,240
I'm literally on life support right now.

1707
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,820
I am on life support.

1708
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,680
Here.

1709
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,320
I have like nothing.

1710
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:09,900
Oh god.

1711
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,740
I live on.

1712
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,600
I live on for just a little bit.

1713
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,300
Oh my god!

1714
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,390
I live on for like one second.

1715
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:24,690
Please.

1716
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,170
Please.

1717
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:27,470
Holy shit, I was so close.

1718
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:30,050
I'm heading to the arrow.

1719
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:32,450
I'm getting there as fast as I can.

1720
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:34,110
Oh, nice.

1721
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:37,390
Fuck it, I might as well.

1722
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:40,770
There's nothing more for me.

1723
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:41,090
No!

1724
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:47,990
Be defeated while using Halu.

1725
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,850
I went to Halu.

1726
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,990
I went to Halu.

1727
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:54,050
Alright, shop.

1728
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,390
It's gacha time.

1729
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,410
I can do one gacha.

1730
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:58,250
This is it.

1731
01:05:58,270 --> 01:05:59,570
This is where my life turns around.

1732
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:01,630
This is it.

1733
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:04,450
Okay.

1734
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:11,510
Okay.

1735
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:16,990
Alright.

1736
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:19,730
Alright, this is it.

1737
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:21,590
Do I have to upgrade anything or are we good?

1738
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,190
Sana is good.

1739
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,210
Wait, is she actually good?

1740
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,070
Is she actually?

1741
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:30,750
Is she meta?

1742
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:36,270
Try to get Iris first for money meta to get to true meta later.

1743
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:37,670
Customer, thank you for the super chat.

1744
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,030
Thank you.

1745
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:38,570
Thank you.

1746
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:40,170
Okay.

1747
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:40,990
Alright.

1748
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:41,750
I believe in you.

1749
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:43,170
This is it.

1750
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,650
I believe in you, Sana.

1751
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,090
Okay, we need to have the...

1752
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:51,730
Alright.

1753
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:52,630
How is her attack?

1754
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,150
Okay, it's like a circle.

1755
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:57,330
Alright, I need more people to be around me.

1756
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:58,090
I need more fans.

1757
01:06:58,850 --> 01:06:59,510
Alright, fans.

1758
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,470
Get over here.

1759
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:05,310
It's okay.

1760
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:06,370
I can't believe it.

1761
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,330
I can't believe you guys took advantage of me not reading.

1762
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:10,970
That's so fucked up.

1763
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:11,730
LOL

1764
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,730
Sweet, thank you for the super chat.

1765
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:18,050
Thank you.

1766
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:18,550
Thank you.

1767
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:19,550
I overslept, but I'm here.

1768
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,250
Hello, Doug.

1769
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:20,810
Nice to see you.

1770
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,730
I'm glad you were able to make it.

1771
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:23,530
One.

1772
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:24,010
Alright.

1773
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:25,270
Nice.

1774
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,730
We're just gonna stay here because this is like baby mode for now.

1775
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,130
Guys, it's not because...

1776
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,370
Callie was my crutch.

1777
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:37,730
It's not because Callie was my crutch.

1778
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:38,990
I am a gamer.

1779
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,510
Okay?

1780
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:41,650
Okay, it's just because I accidentally took Hanlu.

1781
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:43,090
Or Halu.

1782
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:44,870
Or...

1783
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,090
It's because...

1784
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,130
If I didn't take Halu...

1785
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,170
If I didn't take Halu, we could have made it.

1786
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,630
We could have made it with Bae.

1787
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:55,410
I can... I can fucking beat any stage with any character.

1788
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,730
It's not because...

1789
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:04,270
Callie was a crutch.

1790
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:07,550
It was because I just chose the wrong item.

1791
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,250
My back seaters fucked me over.

1792
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,850
Let's see...

1793
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:18,130
One?

1794
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:19,910
One or two?

1795
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,310
Stop the cat.

1796
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:24,430
I don't know what you're talking about.

1797
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,490
I don't know what you're talking about, guys.

1798
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:31,870
It's only because I got fucked over by Halu.

1799
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,750
That was it.

1800
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:36,250
It's only because of that.

1801
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:38,030
All right, here.

1802
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,450
Who would have thought you needed to read in this game?

1803
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,830
I can't believe it.

1804
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,530
Foiled by my lack of reading.

1805
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:51,190
All right, here.

1806
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,290
All right, what else, guys?

1807
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:55,930
Skill issue...

1808
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,070
No!

1809
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:59,670
If it was a skill issue, there would be a journalist mode.

1810
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:00,770
But there isn't.

1811
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:01,690
Hmm?

1812
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,210
There should be a journalist mode.

1813
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:06,290
A journal...

1814
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:07,150
Oh, wait, what's that?

1815
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,330
What the fuck was that?

1816
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:09,870
Wait.

1817
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:10,570
Oh no.

1818
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:12,810
I wonder what would Journalist Mode be?

1819
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,150
Oh god.

1820
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:15,770
Please.

1821
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:16,550
Please.

1822
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,470
Please be a burger.

1823
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,350
Please, I need a burger.

1824
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,170
Oh my god, what was that?

1825
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,770
Wait, what is my ult?

1826
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:27,990
Is my ult just big?

1827
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:33,170
Just stand still.

1828
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:35,890
Alright.

1829
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,910
Is big.

1830
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:39,630
Okay.

1831
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:40,750
I'm just big.

1832
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:42,550
Do I damage them?

1833
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:44,790
By being big?

1834
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:46,770
Oh, I do.

1835
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,370
Oh, and I get to absorb!

1836
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:51,250
Reduce the time.

1837
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:55,230
Every 15 seconds, gain a 15 sec... 15 sec...

1838
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,650
Okay, now every time you guys tell me to get something, I'm gonna read it.

1839
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,030
Reduce the time.

1840
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:03,150
Okay, that's her attack song.

1841
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:06,590
Okay, now I'm gonna reduce... Is that like the... Is that the absorb?

1842
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,450
Like the...

1843
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,450
How is it called?

1844
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:12,750
That like basically... Magnet, right?

1845
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,110
That's the magnet, right?

1846
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:15,330
The thing that glows?

1847
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:16,770
I have trust issues now.

1848
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,590
Oh god.

1849
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:19,350
Oh my god.

1850
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:20,610
This level is so difficult.

1851
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:23,930
No!

1852
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:28,010
When they said recommended, it was actually recommended!

1853
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,470
I can't believe it!

1854
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:39,830
The recommended upgrades was actually for real recommended!

1855
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:44,590
Who would've thought?

1856
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,030
That's crazy!

1857
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:53,550
Who would've thought that shit was actually recommended for me?

1858
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,130
Not me!

1859
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:00,150
Oh god, I'm so fucked up right now.

1860
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:01,850
Oh no.

1861
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,010
Oh no!

1862
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,270
This level is so difficult!

1863
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:09,610
Leave me alone!

1864
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:13,330
Leave me alone!

1865
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,150
Oh no.

1866
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,090
Oh no, this is really bad.

1867
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,650
This is... This is so bad!

1868
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,210
There's a maze!

1869
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:23,830
Goodbye, son.

1870
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:30,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

1871
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:32,470
I'm sorry, son.

1872
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,030
But I can gotcha.

1873
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:35,650
This is it.

1874
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,250
Meta.

1875
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,250
Meta.

1876
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:38,130
Meta.

1877
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:41,470
Meta.

1878
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:41,990
Meta.

1879
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:42,290
Got!

1880
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,250
This is not a crutch.

1881
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,450
This is not a crutch, guys.

1882
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,530
This is not...

1883
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,630
It's not a crutch.

1884
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,650
I swear.

1885
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,070
I swear, chat.

1886
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:07,390
I was just...

1887
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:11,210
It's not a crutch!

1888
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:12,970
It's just as intended!

1889
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,830
For this, you need these upgrades.

1890
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,230
I'm gonna ignore that because I can't read!

1891
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,410
Look, I'm gonna show you!

1892
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:24,490
We don't need those upgrades when I show you with Mori!

1893
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:28,450
No!

1894
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:30,510
We're gonna be so fine!

1895
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:31,590
I'm gonna show you.

1896
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:32,410
I'm gonna prove you all wrong.

1897
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,670
I'm gonna prove you all wrong.

1898
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:37,750
It's because I haven't mastered Bay and Sana yet.

1899
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,850
I just haven't mastered them.

1900
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,530
But you'll see.

1901
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:42,930
You'll see.

1902
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:46,970
When I... When I beat this level on Callie.

1903
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:48,250
You'll see.

1904
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:51,130
Not because she is my crutch.

1905
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,830
But because I'm that skillful at video games.

1906
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:00,150
Okay.

1907
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,050
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

1908
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:01,370
Thank you.

1909
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:01,770
Thank you!

1910
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:02,510
Oh god.

1911
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:04,310
Okay, don't worry.

1912
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,690
We're fine.

1913
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:05,630
Oh, more upgrades.

1914
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:06,010
Nice.

1915
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:06,950
Okay.

1916
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:08,050
It's fine.

1917
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:09,070
We're fine.

1918
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:10,410
We're okay.

1919
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,770
Good luck on the halfway, boss.

1920
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:12,870
I don't need luck!

1921
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:13,930
I was...

1922
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:14,190
Oh!

1923
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:15,270
Okay, it's fine.

1924
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:15,810
It's fine.

1925
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:16,910
Alright.

1926
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:18,490
We don't need luck.

1927
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:19,350
We're just that good.

1928
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:20,590
Okay.

1929
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:21,350
We just got...

1930
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:24,970
It's literally the only thing that I haven't upgraded.

1931
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:25,550
Don't worry.

1932
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:26,930
I got a burger.

1933
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:27,650
I ain't afraid.

1934
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,270
Look at that.

1935
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,250
See?

1936
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:31,890
Look at that.

1937
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:33,530
Look at all this money too.

1938
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:36,010
Look at all this money that I got.

1939
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:37,590
Look at that.

1940
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:38,710
Alright.

1941
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:40,090
Now I don't know what to do.

1942
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:40,690
There's no scythe.

1943
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,050
I don't know.

1944
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:51,250
Now that there's no scythe, I don't know what to do anymore.

1945
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:52,190
Pour?

1946
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:52,750
Okay.

1947
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:53,830
Nice.

1948
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:54,910
This black licorice tab.

1949
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,190
Nice.

1950
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:57,170
Okay.

1951
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:57,690
We can...

1952
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,890
We'll be fine.

1953
01:13:59,210 --> 01:13:59,570
Nice.

1954
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,210
We KO'd him.

1955
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:01,230
See?

1956
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:02,770
Nothing to worry about.

1957
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:05,450
Freaking easiest game of my life on worry.

1958
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:08,330
No!

1959
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:09,050
Not the burger!

1960
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:12,030
My waste of a burger!

1961
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:14,530
I'm not afraid.

1962
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:15,930
What do we do?

1963
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:19,190
What do we do, guys?

1964
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:21,190
I have an ult!

1965
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:21,970
I have an ult too!

1966
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:22,510
Yeah, okay.

1967
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:24,010
We're gonna use that for emergencies.

1968
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:26,850
Two.

1969
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,250
Alright.

1970
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,110
Nice.

1971
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:33,110
Alright, let's just grab all of this real fast and then grab this box too.

1972
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,570
Grab the extra.

1973
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:34,970
No!

1974
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:35,690
It's for ult!

1975
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:36,530
I already have ult!

1976
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:38,610
Guys.

1977
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,410
We're gaming.

1978
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,910
We can do this.

1979
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:42,490
I believe.

1980
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:47,810
I believe.

1981
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:50,210
Nice.

1982
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:53,710
Holy shit.

1983
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:54,690
Okay.

1984
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,070
This is... We don't need ult.

1985
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:57,950
We don't need ult, chat.

1986
01:14:58,610 --> 01:14:59,790
We can live past this.

1987
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,730
I guess we do the cooking?

1988
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:02,870
What else do we need?

1989
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,410
Customer, thank you for the super chat.

1990
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:05,730
Thank you.

1991
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:07,870
Can't believe Calli's back problems.

1992
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,150
Thanks for carrying.

1993
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,650
Thank you for the super chat.

1994
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:12,970
Thank you.

1995
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:13,370
Thank you.

1996
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:15,230
It is a group effort!

1997
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:17,610
What do you mean?

1998
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,010
If I... Okay.

1999
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:21,750
If I die in this game...

2000
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:23,130
It's your fault.

2001
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,910
That means you're not very good backseaters.

2002
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,250
Two... Three or four.

2003
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:34,150
Three or four.

2004
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,630
Or one.

2005
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:37,570
One?

2006
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,150
Okay.

2007
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:48,510
I had to double check that I read that right.

2008
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,510
I was like, wait a minute.

2009
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,330
Is this what I think it is?

2010
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:55,270
Like...

2011
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,770
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

2012
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,590
Are you fucking kidding me?

2013
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,750
Are you act... Like...

2014
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,930
The one thing I got from the boss is the thing I don't...

2015
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:07,150
I can't fucking pick up?

2016
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:10,570
Oh, wait.

2017
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,090
Isn't Norshorn really good?

2018
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:15,050
Coward.

2019
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:15,670
Think of the...

2020
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,030
I am thinking of the coins.

2021
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,510
On the level...

2022
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:22,570
On the level where...

2023
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:22,970
Oh, God.

2024
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:23,710
Oh, God.

2025
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:23,990
Okay.

2026
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,650
There's nothing there.

2027
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:27,250
On the level where, like, I'm...

2028
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,030
I'm...

2029
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,990
I'm not ready for...

2030
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,630
Wait, what do I... What does that do?

2031
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,950
Wait, what does my ult do?

2032
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:35,750
I couldn't tell.

2033
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:37,830
What did my ult do?

2034
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:39,930
Oh!

2035
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:41,810
Wait, what did it do?

2036
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:42,550
A crit buff?

2037
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:42,790
Oh!

2038
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:45,190
Alright, what did we upgrade?

2039
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,370
I wasted ult?

2040
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,590
I didn't know what my ult does!

2041
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,790
My backseaters didn't tell me in time!

2042
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:55,290
Two?

2043
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:56,510
Two.

2044
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,930
Okay.

2045
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:00,150
Alright.

2046
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:00,890
Oh, my God.

2047
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:01,210
It does.

2048
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:01,850
Okay.

2049
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:02,450
We needed this.

2050
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,490
We need more HP anyway.

2051
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,770
We were, like, lacking in the...

2052
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:05,810
Oh!

2053
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,510
Oh, if only I was faster!

2054
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:13,170
Why?

2055
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,410
Why am I not faster?

2056
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:17,990
Oh, no.

2057
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:18,630
Oh, no.

2058
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:21,690
I'm gonna get lifesteal.

2059
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:22,370
I'm gonna get lifesteal.

2060
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:23,290
I really need the lifesteal.

2061
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:26,330
Okay.

2062
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,690
It's fine.

2063
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:28,230
It's fine.

2064
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:28,670
It's fine.

2065
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:30,590
We don't need to be fast.

2066
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,270
We don't need to be fast!

2067
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:34,510
It's fine.

2068
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:35,450
We just need to find a burger!

2069
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:39,450
We just need to find a burger!

2070
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:39,910
It's fine!

2071
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,870
I'm stuck here.

2072
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,070
Oh, I'm not stuck here.

2073
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:43,310
I am not stuck.

2074
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:44,210
It's fine.

2075
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,230
We'll see if we're full HP now.

2076
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,110
We're full HP.

2077
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:47,630
Oh, no.

2078
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:48,390
This is the boss.

2079
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:49,130
The mini boss.

2080
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:50,690
It's okay.

2081
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,430
Alright.

2082
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:53,190
What did we get?

2083
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,850
Level 2 or level...

2084
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:55,870
Look!

2085
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:58,210
Look!

2086
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:02,650
I saw somebody that said I was never gonna live past 4 minutes.

2087
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:04,270
Pay the fuck up!

2088
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:05,790
It's 4 minutes and 5 seconds.

2089
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:06,590
It's...

2090
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,170
There it is.

2091
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,310
Pay the fuck up!

2092
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:17,590
I did it!

2093
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:19,430
I lasted 5 seconds longer!

2094
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,830
I fucking did it.

2095
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,510
This is an accomplishment.

2096
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:32,310
Look, I didn't say which talents that I was gonna get this.

2097
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:33,790
Okay, let's see.

2098
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:36,670
I feel like I need more lifesteal.

2099
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:41,450
Just because how fucked up I am right now.

2100
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:44,390
Oh, God.

2101
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:46,370
Oh, God.

2102
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:46,670
Please.

2103
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:48,030
Please.

2104
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:51,890
I need to grab more upgrades, but it's so hard.

2105
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:53,610
Everybody is there.

2106
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,110
Oh, my God.

2107
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:58,170
Oh!

2108
01:18:58,970 --> 01:18:59,830
Okay, we're fine.

2109
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:00,250
We're fine.

2110
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,610
We're fine.

2111
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:01,790
No, no, no.

2112
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:02,270
We don't need all.

2113
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:02,930
We don't need all.

2114
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:04,250
We're not wasting it!

2115
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:05,930
Alright, what's this?

2116
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,310
Energy drink.

2117
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:09,210
Increase haste by 10%.

2118
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,850
But reduces max HP by... no.

2119
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:13,550
Why are they all so bad?

2120
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,110
I'm not taking it.

2121
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:21,010
What do you mean?

2122
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,810
It says max HP by... by...

2123
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:24,730
20%!

2124
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,250
Take it?

2125
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:27,390
Is it actually good?

2126
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:29,070
I swear to God.

2127
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:31,350
If you guys fuck me over...

2128
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,550
Take it for...

2129
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:41,130
Okay, take it.

2130
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:41,470
Which one?

2131
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:45,640
Which one?

2132
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:48,760
One?

2133
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:49,280
Three?

2134
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:50,820
Four?

2135
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:53,800
Three?

2136
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:55,100
Really?

2137
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,320
Really?

2138
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,580
It is...

2139
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:00,720
Don't get hit.

2140
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,540
I swear to God.

2141
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,140
I swear.

2142
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:05,760
I... I...

2143
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,420
Oh, my God.

2144
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:06,960
I'm so fast.

2145
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:08,340
I'm so fast.

2146
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:08,680
You're right.

2147
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:09,980
I always knew you guys were right.

2148
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:15,900
I always knew you guys wouldn't fuck me over.

2149
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,340
Oh, my God.

2150
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:17,760
Okay.

2151
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,000
Okay, where is my...

2152
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,040
Okay, we can... we can kill...

2153
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,040
We can kill them.

2154
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,780
So we can find... It's gonna be fine.

2155
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,800
We can kill them.

2156
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,080
He's gold.

2157
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:29,540
Get over here.

2158
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:30,660
Get the fuck over here.

2159
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,480
Get him over here.

2160
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,120
Get over here!

2161
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,600
He's golden!

2162
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:37,840
That does you... That...

2163
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,100
That means... Oh, God.

2164
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,140
I think I had a heart attack.

2165
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,100
That means you know he's good.

2166
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:51,540
I was like... I think I had a stroke there.

2167
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,020
Alright.

2168
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:53,520
Nice.

2169
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:54,080
We get money.

2170
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,300
I have no idea if I picked the right one.

2171
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,480
Oh, God.

2172
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,240
Okay.

2173
01:20:59,280 --> 01:20:59,620
It's fine.

2174
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,320
We're fine here.

2175
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:02,700
See?

2176
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,920
I told you guys.

2177
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,100
I told you guys I could... This is the longest I survived.

2178
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,340
He got... Wait, he got away?

2179
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:10,800
I thought I killed him!

2180
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:11,920
Rest in peace.

2181
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:12,640
Alright.

2182
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:16,820
Wait, one?

2183
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,380
Okay.

2184
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,900
How was I supposed to know?

2185
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,600
He just disappeared as if he's dead.

2186
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:25,560
Alright.

2187
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:26,820
Which one, chat?

2188
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,680
Here, thank you in the super chat.

2189
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,020
Thank you.

2190
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:30,460
Thank you.

2191
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:31,820
Lose run.

2192
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,560
Immediately spend run.

2193
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,600
Loss winning on gacha.

2194
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,300
Lose gacha.

2195
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:35,920
Copium.

2196
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,820
Thank you in the super chat.

2197
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:38,320
Thank you.

2198
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:38,920
Thank you.

2199
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:39,540
Alright.

2200
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:39,940
Nice.

2201
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:40,640
And then...

2202
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,720
Do we max out on a book?

2203
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,780
Or do we get... Do we get the sunglasses?

2204
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:48,460
Three?

2205
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,020
Three.

2206
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:51,440
Okay.

2207
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,920
Yeah, there has to be a lot because I dropped a lot.

2208
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,920
Okay, I guess we can... We can gain one more.

2209
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,740
We can max out on that.

2210
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,220
Nice.

2211
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,620
We're doing great.

2212
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,520
I believe in us.

2213
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,620
I believe in our teamwork.

2214
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:08,280
Chat.

2215
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,020
Why are they so tanky?

2216
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,220
Oh, they have shields!

2217
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:14,700
Can I kill these?

2218
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:15,980
Oh, no.

2219
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,080
They just... It's just timed.

2220
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,840
Oh, there's big boy.

2221
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,260
Big boy is here.

2222
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:24,560
I think this is the best mascot design I've ever seen.

2223
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,780
This has to be...

2224
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,780
Oh, fuck!

2225
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,800
Oh, it's okay.

2226
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:33,640
It's okay.

2227
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:34,740
We're fine.

2228
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,360
Oh, we are so healthy.

2229
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,240
We are so healthy.

2230
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,160
We are so healthy.

2231
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:41,740
Dodge.

2232
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,260
Alright, nice.

2233
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,500
No, we don't need all... Okay.

2234
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,500
I'm a coward.

2235
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:46,660
I'm a coward.

2236
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,100
It's fine.

2237
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,280
Alright.

2238
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,720
He's almost dead.

2239
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,040
He has to be close to die, right?

2240
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,480
He has to be close to die.

2241
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:58,800
Nice.

2242
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,860
I swear, if it's another Halu, I swear to fucking god.

2243
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:02,860
It's three!

2244
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,120
Okay, we gotta take the book.

2245
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:06,380
And the cooking.

2246
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,580
Do we take the fan beam?

2247
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:08,480
Or is it useless?

2248
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:13,780
Is that useless?

2249
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,620
Or do we take...

2250
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,900
Or take it?

2251
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:16,580
Take all?

2252
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,120
Alright.

2253
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,840
I got the one person that was like, no.

2254
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,480
Okay.

2255
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,320
Alright, which one?

2256
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:30,520
Chat.

2257
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,640
Which one do we need to get?

2258
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:33,640
Two?

2259
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:36,840
Okay, two.

2260
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:38,140
Nice.

2261
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,840
Oh god, that's a lot of bombs though.

2262
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,640
We're okay though.

2263
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,240
Oh, they blew up.

2264
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:43,660
That's good.

2265
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,900
They made... Oh, shit.

2266
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,420
Nope.

2267
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,240
We need to grab some lifesteal.

2268
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,380
Holy fuck.

2269
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,160
Who the fuck was that?

2270
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:49,300
Oh.

2271
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:51,340
The Onigiris.

2272
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:52,800
What even are...

2273
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,240
What's the fan name of the Onigiri?

2274
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,940
I don't know much about like, the JP mascots.

2275
01:23:58,820 --> 01:23:59,220
Um...

2276
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,140
I don't know the names of all the JP mascots.

2277
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,360
The Mogu Mogu?

2278
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,080
The Oni...

2279
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:10,540
The Oni...

2280
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,100
Okay...

2281
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:11,780
Oh, fuck!

2282
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:12,440
Okay, sorry.

2283
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:13,300
I looked at chat.

2284
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:13,840
Alright.

2285
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:14,520
Hahaha.

2286
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:17,880
I'm sorry.

2287
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,300
There's way too many things going on.

2288
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,140
Oh no.

2289
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,740
Oh no.

2290
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:26,120
Oh, how am I supposed to go through the halls when there's so many of them?

2291
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,120
Oh god.

2292
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:28,780
Please!

2293
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,400
No!

2294
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:30,500
Okay, it's fine.

2295
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:31,720
We're fine.

2296
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:33,480
We're fine.

2297
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:34,440
We actually dodged that.

2298
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,160
That's insane that I managed to dodge that.

2299
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:37,860
Hahaha.

2300
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:38,660
Exactly.

2301
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,640
This is why we have speed.

2302
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:45,200
Look, I told you we didn't need that upgrade, chat.

2303
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,380
Jesus Christ!

2304
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,120
Why are you so tanky?

2305
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,100
Oh no, now they're angry.

2306
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,780
Oh no, what did I do?

2307
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,520
Hahaha.

2308
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,020
Why are you angry?

2309
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,660
What did I do?

2310
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:59,380
We have...

2311
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:00,580
Okay.

2312
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:02,520
I can't go there.

2313
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,400
Alright, we're gonna get more black licorice.

2314
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,980
Oh god, please.

2315
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,980
We need more black licorice.

2316
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,080
Yeah.

2317
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,080
I'm trying to get closer to the...

2318
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,600
I'm trying to get closer to the...

2319
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,700
To the fucking boss!

2320
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,820
There's just too many things!

2321
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:20,920
Okay, here.

2322
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:22,260
Alright.

2323
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:22,980
We gotta...

2324
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,500
We gotta be able to kill the...

2325
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,880
Oh no, get out of here.

2326
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:27,140
No.

2327
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,100
Please, just let me fucking kill him!

2328
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,240
Oh, there's an arrow!

2329
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:33,720
I'm heading over!

2330
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,080
Don't worry!

2331
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,360
Oh, nice.

2332
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,620
But first, let me grab this.

2333
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,100
Please not Halu.

2334
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:39,960
Please not Halu.

2335
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:41,020
Yes!

2336
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,160
We got maxed food.

2337
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,100
Oh, you're gonna die.

2338
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:45,580
Oh, you're gonna die.

2339
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:46,260
We got maxed food.

2340
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:47,480
Okay, arrow time.

2341
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,220
Arrow time!

2342
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:49,880
Just...

2343
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:50,020
Woo!

2344
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,180
Maxed book.

2345
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,600
Arrow time.

2346
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,360
What the fuck was chopping down from here?

2347
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,080
Oh, more cats.

2348
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:00,320
More cats.

2349
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:00,900
Please.

2350
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,900
Get me through here.

2351
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,440
Where the fuck is the arrow?

2352
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:06,540
It's above me?

2353
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:07,340
Oh, it's above me.

2354
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,420
What the fuck is that?

2355
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,000
A crowbar?

2356
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:12,800
Oh, knockback.

2357
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:13,780
Nice.

2358
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:15,520
Yes.

2359
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,000
I always need knockback.

2360
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,360
Okay, now I'm...

2361
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,360
Now I don't know.

2362
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:24,140
This is actually the worst...

2363
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,500
Oh, how did I get out of that?

2364
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,540
Okay, nevermind.

2365
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:27,360
I'm just gaming.

2366
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:31,400
I'm just gaming because I'm naturally gifted, not because of the choice of the talent.

2367
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:36,140
Okay, here we go.

2368
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,900
It's not because of who I picked.

2369
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,860
It's because I'm just naturally good at this game.

2370
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:40,640
Oh.

2371
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,240
Oh, okay.

2372
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:43,760
Okay.

2373
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,280
Knock back help... no no no!

2374
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,320
No no no!

2375
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:53,820
Alright,

2376
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:57,620
which one?

2377
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,820
One, three ish... one, two, four... I see a lot of...

2378
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:06,140
I see a lot of twos or threes.

2379
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,400
Is three actually good?

2380
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:08,940
Three or four?

2381
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,340
Okay, we'll do three.

2382
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,980
Guys, I don't know what you're talking about.

2383
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,400
Oh my god!

2384
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,000
What's going on?

2385
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,560
Oh okay, okay.

2386
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,700
I always thought that thing was gonna come down on me.

2387
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:21,620
Okay, please.

2388
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:22,800
It's literally right there.

2389
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,680
Let me grab that chicken.

2390
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,000
Apply this stamp to this weapon.

2391
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,320
I don't know what it does, but I'll do it.

2392
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,180
Oh, I got wings too!

2393
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:34,280
Decrease damage of the wa- oh wait.

2394
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,020
No, right?

2395
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,860
Yeah, I'm not gonna... no.

2396
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,460
It says decrease the damage.

2397
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,920
Wait, dead in ten seconds?

2398
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:45,240
Why?

2399
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:51,000
So... what do you mean?

2400
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:54,760
What do you mean?

2401
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:59,240
What do you mean by... what do you mean?

2402
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,480
What happens in ten seconds?

2403
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:01,660
What?

2404
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,960
Wait... wait, wait, what happened?

2405
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,880
What happens in ten seconds?

2406
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,880
One... oh no.

2407
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,460
Alright, it's gonna happen in three seconds.

2408
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,940
It's okay, I have all- it's- oh, I got big!

2409
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,180
Okay.

2410
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,200
Oh god.

2411
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:28,880
Oh god.

2412
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,460
I'm running as fast as I can.

2413
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,640
I don't know what she does.

2414
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,920
I don't- oh, it's a flamethrower!

2415
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,880
It's a flamethrower.

2416
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,140
I know what she does.

2417
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,140
Wait, Frozer!

2418
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:38,960
I'm Frozer!

2419
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,220
Okay.

2420
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:40,900
Oh god.

2421
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:41,680
Oh god, please.

2422
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,760
Please, I'm so fast.

2423
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,800
I'm so fucking fa- It's okay.

2424
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:48,480
If I go in a circle!

2425
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:52,320
Big baby.

2426
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,880
Big fucking baby is here.

2427
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,120
Alright.

2428
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:56,740
It's okay.

2429
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,480
The circle's trying- Oh!

2430
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,320
Alright.

2431
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:04,120
I'm gaming.

2432
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:04,820
I knew it!

2433
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,100
The circle's trying!

2434
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,120
Just like real life!

2435
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:07,420
I'm gaming!

2436
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:11,360
The freeze clutch!

2437
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:15,000
We're not doing- I- I could read holo!

2438
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:16,380
I can read!

2439
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,120
Alright.

2440
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,080
Okay, what do we do?

2441
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:21,860
Two?

2442
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:23,300
Two?

2443
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:23,740
Guys!

2444
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:24,680
I can read!

2445
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:28,700
Alright.

2446
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:31,960
Uh...

2447
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:34,380
One.

2448
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:37,400
No, two for- okay, two for the- Oh, the collab.

2449
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:37,800
Alright.

2450
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,020
Nice.

2451
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,020
What is this?

2452
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,380
I swear to god.

2453
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:42,080
Okay, axe.

2454
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:42,940
Do I take it?

2455
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,360
I don't think I have an axe.

2456
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:44,820
I don't.

2457
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:45,800
I have one empty slot.

2458
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,980
I think the last empty slot.

2459
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:48,800
Or do I sell it?

2460
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:52,930
Max out?

2461
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:53,350
No.

2462
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:54,750
Take?

2463
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:55,830
Alright, we'll take it.

2464
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,110
I think it's good for collabs, right?

2465
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:00,450
That's fucking right.

2466
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:06,750
Dude, fuck that person that was like, you're not gonna survive the halftime, boss.

2467
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:07,890
Told you.

2468
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:09,450
Pure skill.

2469
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:15,750
Okay, four.

2470
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:16,210
Alright.

2471
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:22,130
Alright, now we just have to live for ten more minutes.

2472
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:23,710
I feel like...

2473
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:25,510
I think we're set for life now.

2474
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:26,950
We're set.

2475
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:29,470
We're set for life.

2476
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:30,230
We can do this.

2477
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:33,650
Oh yeah, the axe with the...

2478
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:35,290
The axe with the book.

2479
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:36,710
With the black licorice.

2480
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:38,610
Because I love having...

2481
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:39,910
I love using...

2482
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:42,710
I love to cut trees and eat black licorice at the same time.

2483
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:47,590
Aight.

2484
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:51,970
I guess we'll try, we'll upgrade axe so we can collab later.

2485
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:55,250
Axe time.

2486
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,170
We have so many too.

2487
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:59,990
Jesus Christ, who keeps giving you the shields?

2488
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:01,250
They're expensive!

2489
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:02,670
Oh my God, there's a collab!

2490
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:04,170
Oh, there's an upgrade, there's an admin!

2491
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:06,510
Okay, we're fine.

2492
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:08,750
We gotta grab the...

2493
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:09,310
I'm gonna go with the Anvil though.

2494
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:10,910
Nice.

2495
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:12,430
Uhhh... axe.

2496
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:14,630
Uhhh...

2497
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:15,590
Where's the axe?

2498
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:17,110
There's no more axe.

2499
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:19,770
There's no more axe.

2500
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:21,410
Uhhh...

2501
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:25,070
Let's see.

2502
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:26,250
One or two?

2503
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,970
One or two?

2504
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:29,030
Two?

2505
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:29,790
Alright.

2506
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:30,610
Two.

2507
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:32,510
Uhhh...

2508
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:34,610
I guess we do the...

2509
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:36,570
The plug, right?

2510
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:40,850
What a fucking sentence.

2511
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:44,650
Or two?

2512
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:46,230
Alright.

2513
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:47,950
Uhhh...

2514
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:48,950
Oh my god, okay.

2515
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:50,010
Alright.

2516
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:51,130
Oh my gosh, there's so many.

2517
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:53,570
Which one do we do here?

2518
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,550
One makes more DPS.

2519
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:59,610
Yes, we do the plug.

2520
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:02,610
Alright.

2521
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:06,110
Headphones or...

2522
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,390
One or two?

2523
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,130
Weapon... Okay, I'll do...

2524
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:12,290
I'll do... There's more ones.

2525
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:13,730
Upgrade!

2526
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:14,590
What do we upgrade?

2527
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:16,990
I don't even know which one to upgrade.

2528
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:17,530
There's so many.

2529
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:20,410
Do we upgrade our scythe even more?

2530
01:32:24,030 --> 01:32:24,510
Axe?

2531
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:25,290
Who?

2532
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:26,590
Axe.

2533
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:27,610
Okay, I see more axes.

2534
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:29,330
Alright, upgrade.

2535
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:29,890
Nice.

2536
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:30,490
Oh!

2537
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:31,110
What's that?

2538
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:35,310
Once per second, one attacks... weapon hacks may heal a random amount...

2539
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:35,670
Wait!

2540
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:36,530
Lifesteal!

2541
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:37,870
Lifesteal is always good!

2542
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:39,630
Right?

2543
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:43,670
Yeah!

2544
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:44,530
I'm gonna do it.

2545
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:47,950
I'm gonna get the lifesteal.

2546
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:50,790
I know lifesteal is always...

2547
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:51,590
What the fuck is this?

2548
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:56,110
Adds one additional shot to ranged multi-shot weapons.

2549
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:57,610
Does not affect melee weapon.

2550
01:32:57,930 --> 01:32:59,530
Wait, but I am a melee weapon.

2551
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:01,050
How do I sell this?

2552
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:02,750
Can I upgrade this for free?

2553
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:04,050
Wait, can I strengthen?

2554
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:06,970
Uhhh... upgrade...

2555
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:07,850
Okay, upgrade.

2556
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:09,950
Upgrade, strengthen, confirm.

2557
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:10,730
Nice!

2558
01:33:11,490 --> 01:33:12,330
Holy shit!

2559
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:13,890
I love not thinking for myself.

2560
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:17,710
It's so nice.

2561
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:21,590
This is why I'm a streamer now.

2562
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:25,850
I'm pretty sure becoming a streamer has actually made me more stupid.

2563
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:27,730
Because I have no free will anymore.

2564
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:36,090
That is the risk you take.

2565
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:37,850
Head M4.

2566
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:38,210
Empty.

2567
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:40,250
Let chat decide everything for you.

2568
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,150
Oh my gosh.

2569
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,830
You like the movie Wall-E?

2570
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:46,930
And then like the humans are on those chairs.

2571
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,030
But like...

2572
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,490
And the robots take care of them.

2573
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:50,610
That's gonna be me.

2574
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:58,340
It's like, what do I do chat?

2575
01:33:58,860 --> 01:33:59,940
Oh, hey!

2576
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:00,740
What's this?

2577
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,280
Crit up.

2578
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,740
That's the dream right there.

2579
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,860
I don't understand why they would want to go back to earth.

2580
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:10,080
I don't understand why they would want to go back to earth.

2581
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,340
Why would they need to go back to earth?

2582
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,600
What's the point?

2583
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:20,440
Replace?

2584
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:21,880
Swap crowbar?

2585
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:22,340
Okay.

2586
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,220
Swap...

2587
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:24,640
Oh.

2588
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,760
Swap with...

2589
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:29,560
Swap.

2590
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,260
Alright, here we go.

2591
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:31,440
Swap two?

2592
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:32,880
Which one?

2593
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:34,500
Do we replace the crowbar or the chicken?

2594
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,660
The chicken saved my life!

2595
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,440
Oh, that's a good one.

2596
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:41,360
Crowbar is good?

2597
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,060
Okay, I'll swap then.

2598
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:44,740
Alright.

2599
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:46,640
Alright, here we go.

2600
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:47,720
I swapped.

2601
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,100
Alright, we're good.

2602
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:50,880
And then we upgrade.

2603
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:51,600
What do we upgrade?

2604
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:55,660
Strengthen lifesteal?

2605
01:34:58,380 --> 01:34:58,780
Crit?

2606
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,080
Crit or lifesteal?

2607
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:05,360
Okay, I'll strengthen lifesteal.

2608
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:06,940
Nice.

2609
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:07,840
Alright, here we go.

2610
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:08,740
We're good.

2611
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:09,860
Wait, whose mascot is that?

2612
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,620
Oh my god!

2613
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:12,940
Oh my god!

2614
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:13,260
Collab!

2615
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,040
Okay.

2616
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,100
Axe and black licorice.

2617
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:19,340
There you go.

2618
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:24,260
Do we...

2619
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:25,740
Uh...

2620
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:27,820
Is that the collab we want?

2621
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,880
Eating black licorice while we cut down some trees?

2622
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,440
Eating black licorice while we cut down some trees?

2623
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,240
Yeah?

2624
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:36,740
Alright.

2625
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:37,420
Nice.

2626
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:38,940
Okay.

2627
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:41,620
God, I love to cut trees.

2628
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:44,460
Alright, here we go.

2629
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:46,620
We're doing pretty well!

2630
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:47,820
I mean, we're...

2631
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,380
This is like the furthest we've ever gone.

2632
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:53,180
I haven't seen any like bosses in a while too.

2633
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,020
Oh god, where are they running from?

2634
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,180
Who are you running from?

2635
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:58,440
Oh...

2636
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:00,140
Dodge!

2637
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:03,820
Easy.

2638
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:06,680
Alright.

2639
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:08,920
Over here we go.

2640
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,380
I feel like fan mascots are like...

2641
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,720
It's like mini Sanrio.

2642
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:14,020
Alright.

2643
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,300
Increase rate...

2644
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,280
Oh, I don't know any... Okay.

2645
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:19,400
Death or energy drink or glow stick?

2646
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:20,820
Are any of these good?

2647
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,460
Death?

2648
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,480
Okay, death.

2649
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:24,800
Alright.

2650
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,280
I feel like fan mascots, they're like...

2651
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,220
Mini Sanrio characters if you think about it.

2652
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:33,080
It's so smart!

2653
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:34,260
It actually is.

2654
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,520
Because you have anime girls and...

2655
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,780
Who the fuck are you?

2656
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,220
Who's fan mascot is that?

2657
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,220
Where are the blue flames?

2658
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,360
I think it's better than death.

2659
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:50,720
Oh, really?

2660
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,840
I feel like I haven't seen these guys a lot.

2661
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:55,380
Often.

2662
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,100
The comments.

2663
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,260
Yeah, but it's like...

2664
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:02,300
You get anime girls.

2665
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:03,760
Cute anime girls.

2666
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:06,280
And then you also get Sanrio characters.

2667
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,740
Oh, it's not official?

2668
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,560
They're like unofficial designs?

2669
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,340
Do we get...

2670
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,480
I guess we can upgrade the tail.

2671
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:18,800
Who's coming out from here?

2672
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,780
Because I don't see these guys often.

2673
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:23,700
On social media.

2674
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:25,120
I get my news on Twitter.

2675
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,600
Doki is blonde.

2676
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,360
Likes Deforestation.

2677
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,480
Wonderbread man supported.

2678
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,500
No, not Wonderbread.

2679
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,160
Wonderbread man.

2680
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:46,880
You know, I would not oppose to have the Wonderbread guy be a... like Oshii-ing me.

2681
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,720
Because that guy...

2682
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:56,320
The amount of money he fucking spends on fucking Wonderbread art...

2683
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,020
It's like...

2684
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:58,740
It's a lot.

2685
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:04,700
Bro!

2686
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,380
He's... He's like...

2687
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,460
He's an oiler.

2688
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:08,760
For sure.

2689
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:11,500
True.

2690
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,500
And like...

2691
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:13,120
If...

2692
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:18,700
If the risk is just, you know, talking about Wonderbread ever so often...

2693
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:23,340
Like, I feel like that's like an exchange I'm willing to make.

2694
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,820
Like, it's just Wonderbread.

2695
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,520
Like, it's just...

2696
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:28,860
Okay, increase.

2697
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,800
I have... I already have that anyway.

2698
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:37,250
He's a neurosurgeon?

2699
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:40,490
Uh...

2700
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:41,610
I guess...

2701
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:43,590
I guess I'll upgrade the glasses since I...

2702
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,750
I have the glasses on, right?

2703
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:50,210
He's a fucking neurosurgeon?

2704
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:51,950
Okay, this is...

2705
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:53,590
He has to be normal in real life.

2706
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:54,790
So this is his, like, outlet.

2707
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:02,850
Like, I imagine, like, you know, since you're a neurosurgeon you can't be like...

2708
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:03,930
Like, you know, a freak.

2709
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,170
So like...

2710
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:09,030
I swear, a lot of, like, the people with, like, who are like...

2711
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:14,130
freaks on the internet with, like, the craziest fucking, like, shit.

2712
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:15,310
Like...

2713
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:17,250
They, like...

2714
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:19,070
They put on the mask.

2715
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:19,710
You know?

2716
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:26,370
They, like, you know, like, online is where it stays.

2717
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:28,970
Like, he needs an outlet.

2718
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:31,490
So that's why he's able to afford...

2719
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:34,470
Imagine your fucking neurosurgeon is the Wonderbread guy.

2720
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:37,990
So for those who are wondering what the fuck is the Wonderbread guy.

2721
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:39,430
So the... Okay, do we...

2722
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:41,370
Do we get fan beam or, like, the glasses?

2723
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:47,090
Do we... Like, you're about to get, like, the most, like...

2724
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:51,430
You're about to get, like, the most intense heart sur... Uh, wait, where...

2725
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:54,750
It's like a neurosurgeon has a heart surgery.

2726
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:56,510
Sorry.

2727
01:39:56,710 --> 01:39:58,070
Wrong area.

2728
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:00,490
Okay.

2729
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:03,610
You're about to go into surgery and...

2730
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:05,030
And, uh...

2731
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:09,550
And, like, it's like some fucking 10% survival rate or something.

2732
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:11,810
And this is your doc... Like...

2733
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:15,070
And then... And then...

2734
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:18,630
Your doctor is the Wonderbread guy.

2735
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:19,550
Like, I don't know.

2736
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:24,430
I... I mean, if he's a really good doctor, I feel like I shouldn't care.

2737
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:31,130
If he's really good at his job, like, it should be fine.

2738
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:31,550
Right?

2739
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:34,890
Like, as long as he's really good at his job.

2740
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:40,140
Alright.

2741
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:45,780
But anyway, for those who are confused about, like, what the fuck is the Wonderbread guy.

2742
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,480
Okay, this is like old internet lore.

2743
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:50,480
But he used to be, like...

2744
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,160
Oh my god.

2745
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,740
He could be a better doctor now.

2746
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:59,400
He could be, like, a better doctor because it's, like, years now if you think about it.

2747
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:00,860
It's been...

2748
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:02,740
It's been fucking years.

2749
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:05,180
And he has to have improved his doctoring.

2750
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:06,820
So, like, anyway...

2751
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:07,660
Sorry.

2752
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,480
I keep getting off track because I was supposed to explain to people who don't know...

2753
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,020
who don't know who the Wonderbread guy is.

2754
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:14,960
So, the Wonderbread guy...

2755
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,580
Basically, he...

2756
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:17,260
Okay, wait.

2757
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,020
Uh...

2758
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:20,920
I guess, uh... I'll increase that.

2759
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:28,020
He basically commissions people to draw, like, women buying Wonderbread.

2760
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:29,400
And they're always blonde.

2761
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:39,180
Like, he has this very weird obsession with, like, Wonder Bread.

2762
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,900
And he just commissions women... Like, artwork of women.

2763
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:44,400
Um...

2764
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:47,220
Blonde women drawing, like, drawings.

2765
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,940
And they're all just buying...

2766
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,400
buying bread.

2767
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,060
Oh, and... and deforestation.

2768
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:54,240
Yeah, and cutting down trees.

2769
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,860
And cutting down trees because he hates trees, I guess.

2770
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:58,660
Um...

2771
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:59,840
And that's what gets him going.

2772
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:01,640
That's,

2773
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:09,860
like, exactly what, like, makes him, like, really happy in life.

2774
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:10,960
Um...

2775
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,200
But, like, if he's good at his job...

2776
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:20,440
I feel like... Okay, if he's, like, really good at his job, like, and it's, like, life or death...

2777
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:23,940
Like, I would... Like, I don't mind if he operates on me.

2778
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:25,120
Hehehehehehe!

2779
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:30,580
He should, like, have a card and be like, you've just...

2780
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:32,640
I was saved by the Wonderbread guy.

2781
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,980
But anyway...

2782
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,540
Anyway, um...

2783
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,400
Anyway, there's a lot of...

2784
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:40,100
Like, there...

2785
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:45,360
I feel like a lot of them are, like, really normal people outside of the internet.

2786
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:48,520
And then when you found... find out... Holy shit!

2787
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,180
When you...

2788
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:52,100
Okay, when you find out...

2789
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:55,880
Like, when you find the mask that they take off, it's actually crazy.

2790
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:58,100
It's like those people that commission.

2791
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,420
Those, like... Oh my god!

2792
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:02,180
I used to be on DeviantArt.

2793
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:03,720
Like, cause I was an artist.

2794
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,660
So, like, you know...

2795
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:07,100
Like, all... There was only one place to go.

2796
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,480
It was either Tumblr or DeviantArt or both.

2797
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,700
Or other websites.

2798
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:13,100
Hehehehehehe!

2799
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:14,640
Hehehehe!

2800
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,740
Or other websites for different categories.

2801
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:23,420
Um... But, like, this would always pop up in the trending on DeviantArt.

2802
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:24,420
And...

2803
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:29,880
And... I follow him on Twitter and from what I've seen, he's actually very nice.

2804
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,300
Locke, thank you for the super chat!

2805
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:32,200
Thank you, thank you!

2806
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,840
Like, it's just... It's just, like, what he's into.

2807
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:35,560
Hehehehehe!

2808
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,220
It's just... Hahaha!

2809
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:36,980
Hahaha!

2810
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:40,920
Like, he has to be a really nice guy.

2811
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,780
It's just that he's into some really freaky shit!

2812
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:50,340
Um... But, like, there was this, like, one thing that kept, like, showing up on, like, DeviantArt, like, front page.

2813
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,000
And I was... Oh my god!

2814
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,600
Oh my go... Okay, okay, I was scared what that could entail.

2815
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:58,360
Like, when I heard the That shit, like, freaks me out.

2816
01:43:58,460 --> 01:43:58,880
Oh my god!

2817
01:43:58,920 --> 01:43:59,340
I can't see!

2818
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:01,920
There's too many things!

2819
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:02,800
Anyway!

2820
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:05,780
Anyway, do you guys know, like, this thing called... What's it called?

2821
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:06,960
Bimbo-mification?

2822
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:17,000
Like, where, like, people would draw... Like, apparently you... Someone wrote a new... Wrote an actual, like, news article about it.

2823
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:19,400
Because it was such a weird trend.

2824
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,360
And...

2825
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:21,080
Hahaha!

2826
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,840
Hahaha!

2827
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:25,820
It was...

2828
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:29,900
It was such a weird fad slash trend.

2829
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:32,000
Because... Wait, what is that?

2830
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:32,640
What is that?

2831
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,320
Do I have to kill it before it explodes?

2832
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,040
Like, what does that mean?

2833
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:38,700
Do I have to kill this before it explodes?

2834
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:39,640
I'm 18 seconds!

2835
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:41,060
Oh god.

2836
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:42,000
Oh god.

2837
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:42,740
Okay, I'm trying.

2838
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:43,100
I'm trying.

2839
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:45,560
I didn't realize I have to kill this before it explodes.

2840
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,680
Oh, thank god.

2841
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:46,980
Okay.

2842
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,000
Holy shit.

2843
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:55,840
Okay, as I was saying...

2844
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,140
As I was saying...

2845
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:02,760
Where was I?

2846
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,100
Um... Okay.

2847
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:08,520
So, basically, what that is...

2848
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:14,360
Was that... Apparently, artists made a shitload of money because, like, there was an article written about it.

2849
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:16,720
And they, like, talked about how much they made.

2850
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,820
Like, charged for, like, those types of... Those types of, like, art commissions.

2851
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,120
And they made fucking a bank.

2852
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,940
Is this it?

2853
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,240
Are these two the combinations?

2854
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,580
Or is that...

2855
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:28,980
Woo!

2856
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:29,920
Dragonfire!

2857
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:33,820
Um... And basically, it is, like...

2858
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,000
Oh my gosh, look at that.

2859
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:35,960
Like, it's like...

2860
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,600
A nerdy girl turning into a bimbo.

2861
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:49,260
It'll be like, first stage, she's reading a li... She has glasses on and is reading a library book.

2862
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:52,980
Second stage, she starts reading easier books.

2863
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:54,180
And then, like, the...

2864
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:57,200
Like, she starts reading picture books.

2865
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,600
It's so fucking...

2866
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,540
It's so...

2867
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:06,140
Stop talking...

2868
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:10,480
Okay.

2869
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,040
And then...

2870
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,340
Um...

2871
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,400
And then she just... She just...

2872
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:16,900
Oh my god!

2873
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,100
Is that Saf's song?

2874
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:22,120
And then she just starts reading, like... Like...

2875
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:22,980
I guess, like...

2876
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:25,720
Dumber and dumber books?

2877
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:26,380
Like...

2878
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:30,420
It's so fucking weird.

2879
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,200
Until she's, like...

2880
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,980
Until she stops reading.

2881
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:37,820
No!

2882
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,740
I swear I got perms for this game!

2883
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:41,800
Sessa!

2884
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:46,500
Oh god, we gotta... We gotta get rid of...

2885
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,060
I swear!

2886
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,660
We got perms!

2887
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,380
Okay, here we go.

2888
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,860
Until she becomes a...

2889
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:57,240
Until she cannot think for herself, i.e.

2890
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:57,520
me.

2891
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,440
I mean, streaming is sort of like...

2892
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,100
A big publication!

2893
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,460
Okay.

2894
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:07,980
Um...

2895
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:11,480
What do we do?

2896
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:12,660
Two?

2897
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:13,900
Or four?

2898
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:14,980
Increase lab?

2899
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:15,860
I'll do four, okay.

2900
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,560
That's fine.

2901
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,280
I swear, apparently...

2902
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,940
I accidentally wasted...

2903
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,560
I accidentally wasted it for...

2904
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:25,040
Oh no!

2905
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,760
What is that?

2906
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:34,180
Ahaha!

2907
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:35,380
No!

2908
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:37,320
Not Toho!

2909
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,560
Not Toho!

2910
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:41,520
Not Toho!

2911
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:42,640
No!

2912
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:44,180
No!

2913
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:46,820
No!

2914
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,060
We were so close!

2915
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:52,360
I'm so bad at Toho!

2916
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:53,300
I'm so bad at Toho!

2917
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:55,860
My one weakness!

2918
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:56,800
My one weakness!

2919
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,260
Toho!

2920
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:00,060
Meta.

2921
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:00,880
Please.

2922
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:01,600
Meta.

2923
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,080
Hahaha!

2924
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,040
Ah!

2925
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:05,760
That's meta!

2926
01:48:06,220 --> 01:48:07,560
Iris is meta, right?

2927
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,000
Who else is meta?

2928
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:11,600
Okay.

2929
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:13,660
I heard like Mumei is meta too, right?

2930
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:15,900
Oh my god, I'll never get Mumei!

2931
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,860
I got meta!

2932
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:19,260
Hahaha!

2933
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:22,080
Okay, nice.

2934
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:22,960
We have meta now.

2935
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:23,820
Alright.

2936
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,320
Oh, I have like different outfits!

2937
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,580
I wanna be Santa.

2938
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,360
Merry Christmas!

2939
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,500
Hahaha!

2940
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:31,140
Everyone is meta.

2941
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:32,020
Alright.

2942
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,040
Okay, I feel like...

2943
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,680
We can totally...

2944
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,320
Like, how do I recommend upgrades?

2945
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,240
Okay, where do I shop?

2946
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:41,600
Is it... How do I upgrade that?

2947
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:44,040
Is it like...

2948
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:45,060
Oh, stat upgrade!

2949
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:45,740
Hahaha!

2950
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,740
There's another stat!

2951
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:49,360
Hey guys!

2952
01:48:49,580 --> 01:48:53,580
I don't know if you guys know this, but there is another tab for stats!

2953
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,600
I can't believe I haven't upgraded stats once!

2954
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,160
I...

2955
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,820
I can't believe...

2956
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,660
I... I can't believe it!

2957
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:04,240
I... That was the one...

2958
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,520
I was playing everything at by...

2959
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,440
By...

2960
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:08,460
Default!

2961
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,160
Wow!

2962
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:15,320
No wonder everybody was like...

2963
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:15,980
Doki!

2964
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,960
Stats!

2965
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,560
Guys, I didn't realize...

2966
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:24,520
I didn't realize there was a whole other tab!

2967
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:26,400
That's fucking crazy!

2968
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:27,140
Hahaha!

2969
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:27,600
Nice!

2970
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,660
Guys, there was a whole other tab!

2971
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:31,980
Guys, there was a whole other tab!

2972
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,940
Did you guys know that?

2973
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:34,520
Oh my god!

2974
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:35,300
You know what?

2975
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:37,540
Maybe I do, baby!

2976
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,360
Maybe I do, baby!

2977
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,240
Hahaha!

2978
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:44,560
Um...

2979
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:46,260
Justice!

2980
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:48,700
Thank you for the Aka Aka Supa!

2981
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:49,740
Thank you, thank you!

2982
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,720
Hey, is it too late to see you play Phasmophobia?

2983
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:55,320
Thank you for the Aka Aka Supa!

2984
01:49:55,740 --> 01:49:56,260
Hahaha!

2985
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:56,420
Hahaha!

2986
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:00,160
Maybe one day...

2987
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,360
Is Phasmophobia still popular?

2988
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:05,640
Okay, what do we get?

2989
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,140
These are all new stuff.

2990
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:08,500
Uh...

2991
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,420
Time for money!

2992
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:16,320
It's two hundred and...

2993
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:16,560
Four?

2994
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:17,620
Alright, four.

2995
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:18,680
Guys...

2996
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,820
I just can't believe it.

2997
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:22,080
There was a whole new other level.

2998
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:22,900
Hahaha!

2999
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:26,200
Who?

3000
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:26,940
Who?

3001
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:27,700
I told you!

3002
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30,400
Streaming is like modern day...

3003
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,620
Hahaha!

3004
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:33,140
Hahaha!

3005
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,760
It's... it's modern day!

3006
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:37,380
Hahaha!

3007
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,580
Um... Sam, thank you for the fifty gifted chips!

3008
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:42,740
Thank you, thank you!

3009
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:44,360
Really appreciate it!

3010
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:45,040
Thank you so much!

3011
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,460
Uh... alright, we'll do...

3012
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:50,380
Do we stop?

3013
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,120
Ah!

3014
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:51,980
I read chat!

3015
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:54,080
Alright, it's fine.

3016
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:54,860
We're fine.

3017
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:59,120
I just gotta kill some deadbeats real fast and the shrimps.

3018
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:00,140
Boop!

3019
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:02,140
Boop!

3020
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:02,660
Boop!

3021
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:04,440
Nice.

3022
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:06,940
Uh...

3023
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:09,280
I guess we upgrade fully on...

3024
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:10,960
Uh...

3025
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,400
Fully on her weapon, right?

3026
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:15,660
There's a pity section for the gacha by the way.

3027
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:17,780
Ten pulls equals one redeem of character.

3028
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:18,740
Oh, I love pity.

3029
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,200
This is exactly why I don't do gacha.

3030
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:27,540
I try to avoid gacha game is because I'm worried I'm actually gonna find a gacha game that I'm really gonna like.

3031
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,180
I...

3032
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,040
Hahaha!

3033
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:44,900
Like, I'm so scared that like eventually even though like I try not to be invested in... I don't do gacha game is because my one fear is that I'll actually get invested in gacha games and then I'm gonna lose all my money.

3034
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
That is my one fear.

3035
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,980
Cause like gacha is...

3036
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:48,720
Hahaha!

3037
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:53,720
It's like there's two things that can like be scary.

3038
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:54,740
Um...

3039
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:58,620
Being invested in gacha games or being invested in gambling.

3040
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,560
That is like the worst fears to have.

3041
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:05,220
Because you know your wallet is not going to like it.

3042
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:08,300
Your wallet is not going to like it.

3043
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:13,980
And then the worst thing about gacha is like the game will eventually shut down one day.

3044
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:17,860
And then like... Okay, hope increase crit hit.

3045
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:24,480
Cause like the game is going to eventually one day be shut down with all the servers and stuff.

3046
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:27,880
So then you have to think like, oh my god all that money.

3047
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:28,860
Hahaha!

3048
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:29,320
Hahaha!

3049
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:32,860
My PNGs!

3050
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:34,520
Hahaha!

3051
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:36,300
Hahaha!

3052
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:46,480
And then because I already am invested in Fortnite skins and like I personally have already spent like at least a thousand dollars on Fortnite skins.

3053
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,840
And like that scares me.

3054
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:49,540
You know what?

3055
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:50,080
Fuck it.

3056
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:50,900
We'll get more enemies.

3057
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,060
Like this should be fine.

3058
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:52,840
There's more money.

3059
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:53,180
Right?

3060
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:56,940
This is... Iris is like the... My wives!

3061
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:58,060
Hahaha!

3062
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,960
And husbandos!

3063
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:05,280
Um... Okay, we're getting hollow now because like we can take it.

3064
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:05,860
You know what?

3065
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:06,840
Fuck it!

3066
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,180
I ain't scared!

3067
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,100
I have meta!

3068
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:11,700
Hahaha!

3069
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:13,820
It is...

3070
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,520
Um... A lot.

3071
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:16,800
Wait, what does...

3072
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,260
What does my hope... Oh, it's a bomb.

3073
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:19,700
Okay.

3074
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,260
That's a bomb.

3075
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:22,860
Alright, let's see.

3076
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:25,380
Grab like her or...

3077
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:27,480
Oh, nice.

3078
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:28,060
That's good.

3079
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:29,440
What is this?

3080
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,320
Uh... I guess I'll upgrade.

3081
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:32,760
I'm not gonna upgrade hollow.

3082
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:33,880
Hahaha!

3083
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:37,360
It's the greed time!

3084
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:39,480
Okay, never... No, that's fine.

3085
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,820
I don't need more greed.

3086
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:41,420
Alright!

3087
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,380
Other than three.

3088
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:44,460
What else?

3089
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:46,320
What else?

3090
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:49,560
Who?

3091
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:50,860
Okay.

3092
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,860
Guys, we need to max out our shit before we get more greedy.

3093
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:54,520
Guys!

3094
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:59,320
We need to be stronger before we can get greedy.

3095
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:03,700
Okay, wait.

3096
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:04,040
What's that?

3097
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,860
Oh, it's just deadbeats.

3098
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,220
It's just a few of them.

3099
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,060
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

3100
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:10,500
Hahaha!

3101
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:15,360
I'm afraid of like actually getting really invested in gacha and that...

3102
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:16,100
And then like...

3103
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:16,300
I'm afraid of like actually getting really invested in gacha and that...

3104
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:17,960
Because I already have a Fortnite issue.

3105
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:20,540
And then I have to think about having a...

3106
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:21,640
Uh...

3107
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,260
Hahaha!

3108
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:24,200
Gacha issue!

3109
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:25,500
Hahaha!

3110
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,260
Alright.

3111
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:29,040
Fuck, I didn't read what she does.

3112
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,060
So I hope it's not...

3113
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:31,500
Anything that would fuck me over.

3114
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:34,980
It is dangerous when you have like...

3115
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:36,520
Your main gacha game.

3116
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:37,380
It's so dangerous.

3117
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,760
It's so... Oh my god!

3118
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:44,140
No, I can't.

3119
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:45,160
That's NDA asking.

3120
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:46,500
Hahaha!

3121
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:48,780
Hahaha!

3122
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,740
I was gonna say...

3123
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,280
Okay, I was like curious.

3124
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:53,800
Cause I was like...

3125
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,520
Cause you know like...

3126
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:56,800
Okay, not getting three.

3127
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,080
I was thinking about like...

3128
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,520
You know like... Oh my god.

3129
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:02,440
Like those casino sponsors.

3130
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:06,260
Oh my... They get paid so much money.

3131
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:07,020
Hahaha!

3132
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,400
Like it's actually crazy.

3133
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:10,880
Hahaha!

3134
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,460
But obviously I can't say what...

3135
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:15,220
How much...

3136
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:15,940
Hahaha!

3137
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:16,620
Hahaha!

3138
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,320
It's actually crazy.

3139
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:20,800
Oh!

3140
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,700
Okay, it'll be fine.

3141
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:24,100
We'll be fine.

3142
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:24,840
We'll find a burger.

3143
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:26,720
We'll find a burger.

3144
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:27,380
We'll be fine.

3145
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:30,100
Hahaha!

3146
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:31,640
Hahaha!

3147
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:33,020
Hahaha!

3148
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:34,740
Uh...

3149
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:37,320
No fucking course I...

3150
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,320
Of course I didn't get...

3151
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:41,660
I was curious cause I was like...

3152
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:44,220
I was like how much do they get paid for that?

3153
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:45,400
And I'm like...

3154
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,120
Oh my...

3155
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:48,360
Which makes sense because like...

3156
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,540
Like if you own a casino...

3157
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:53,720
You have to make so much money.

3158
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,360
Because like...

3159
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:56,340
Cause like...

3160
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:58,180
It's Las Vegas.

3161
01:55:59,180 --> 01:55:59,780
Like...

3162
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:01,180
My tax will look pretty.

3163
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:01,900
There's no... Nice.

3164
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:02,720
That's all I want.

3165
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:05,000
As long as it looks pretty.

3166
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:05,620
Hahaha!

3167
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:09,580
The best upgrade there is.

3168
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,820
Cause like...

3169
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:11,700
Like...

3170
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:14,180
Las Vegas rent in general...

3171
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:15,760
Has to be fucking insane.

3172
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:19,080
Because like...

3173
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:19,960
You know like the spear?

3174
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:21,460
I talked about this before.

3175
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,720
But like...

3176
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:26,300
Uh... I guess we do half angel?

3177
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,000
Or the RGB meta?

3178
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,300
Or...

3179
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:32,760
One?

3180
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:35,240
Okay.

3181
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,120
So like...

3182
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:36,580
Oh god.

3183
01:56:36,860 --> 01:56:38,920
My hands were off my keyboard.

3184
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:40,540
Cause like the spear...

3185
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:42,800
In Las Vegas...

3186
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,460
You know like... I forgot.

3187
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:45,120
Like...

3188
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:49,020
For like 30 seconds of advertising...

3189
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:50,520
On the spear...

3190
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:51,220
Is like what?

3191
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,800
Like $20,000?

3192
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:55,260
It has to be more.

3193
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:56,040
Is it more?

3194
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:56,980
I don't remember.

3195
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,000
Hahaha!

3196
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:00,960
It's more right?

3197
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:02,180
It's not profit.

3198
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:02,520
Okay.

3199
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:04,980
They're making zero profit by the way.

3200
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:05,660
Off of the spear.

3201
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,120
It cost a lot.

3202
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:08,240
It was more than $30,000.

3203
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,680
I remember I ranted about it.

3204
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,500
It's not $30,000.

3205
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:12,700
It was like $100,000.

3206
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:13,580
Is it $100,000?

3207
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,580
Or some shit for like 30 seconds?

3208
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,480
It's like so much.

3209
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:21,340
By the way, the spear right now makes zero profit.

3210
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:22,140
Hahaha!

3211
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:24,620
It would take them like...

3212
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:26,560
I think like 10 to 20 years.

3213
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:29,540
Before they actually see real profit.

3214
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:30,220
Yeah.

3215
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:32,260
$450k per day.

3216
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:32,860
Yeah.

3217
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,240
If you wanna be on the spear...

3218
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,960
It would take $450,000 a day to be on the spear.

3219
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:40,720
Oh god.

3220
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,240
Bomb time.

3221
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,340
Hahaha!

3222
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:45,320
But it's so cool though.

3223
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:46,400
That is true.

3224
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:49,380
But it's also $450,000.

3225
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:50,280
Hahaha!

3226
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,340
Hahaha!

3227
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:54,700
Yeah like...

3228
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:55,120
Okay.

3229
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:56,420
Here's to give context.

3230
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:57,940
So... Oh chicken!

3231
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:58,340
Okay.

3232
01:57:58,380 --> 01:57:59,420
Here's to give context.

3233
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,420
Um...

3234
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:02,500
Um...

3235
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:05,740
To have like an advertisement...

3236
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:06,760
On the...

3237
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:09,420
On the Tokyo...

3238
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:09,980
Oh god.

3239
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:10,380
Please.

3240
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:11,040
Please.

3241
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:11,780
Hahaha!

3242
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:15,080
The Tokyo like... Subways?

3243
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:17,000
Uh... Oh no.

3244
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:17,520
What do we get?

3245
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:18,120
Alright.

3246
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,620
What did I get?

3247
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:25,230
I didn't...

3248
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:26,150
What did I get?

3249
01:58:26,150 --> 01:58:27,930
I didn't get an upgrade.

3250
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:28,910
Okay.

3251
01:58:29,210 --> 01:58:31,350
I don't know what upgrade I got chat.

3252
01:58:31,570 --> 01:58:32,650
I don't know.

3253
01:58:32,650 --> 01:58:33,090
I stopped.

3254
01:58:33,370 --> 01:58:34,050
Okay.

3255
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:34,730
I'm focused.

3256
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:35,350
I'm focused.

3257
01:58:35,570 --> 01:58:35,910
I'm focused.

3258
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:37,870
Doki on the spear fun.

Wait.

3304
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:35,730

3305
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:36,690
Did I just made up a name?

3306
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:36,970
Oh no.

3307
01:59:37,050 --> 01:59:37,650
There you go!

01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:38,550

01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:53,590
Okay.

3324
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:54,290

3332
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:07,690
Increase lava...

3333
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:10,470
Someone say super chat time!

3334
02:00:11,090 --> 02:00:12,070
Thank you for the super chat!

3335
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:12,410
Thank you!

3336
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:12,970
Thank you!

3337
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:13,130
Shock!

3338
02:00:14,570 --> 02:00:15,050
Okay.

3339
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:15,530
Wait.

3340
02:00:16,230 --> 02:00:17,150
Speed up.

3341
02:00:18,410 --> 02:00:18,890
Lava.

3342
02:00:19,370 --> 02:00:20,190
Band-aid.

3343
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:24,530
Every heal 10 HPI for 3 seconds until 80% of...

3344
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:27,870
Alright!

3345
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:28,750
Thank you for the super chat!

3346
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:29,070
Thank you!

3347
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:29,650
Thank you!

3348
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:32,330
Thank you for the super chat!

3349
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:32,670
Thank you!

3350
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:33,370
Thank you!

3351
02:00:33,410 --> 02:00:34,330
Super chat time!

3352
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:35,690
Alright.

3353
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:36,750
Let's see.

3354
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:38,150
3 or 4...

3355
02:00:38,150 --> 02:00:38,990
Oh my god!

3356
02:00:39,050 --> 02:00:39,350
Luch!

3357
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:40,530
Thank you for the Akka super!

3358
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:41,450
Thank you!

3359
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:42,070
Thank you!

3360
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:44,050
The super chat!

3361
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:44,890
Alright.

3362
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:45,230
3.

3363
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,010
Oh no.

3364
02:00:47,130 --> 02:00:47,630
What is this?

3365
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:49,430
The first target this weapon hit is marked.

3366
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:50,790
The marked target will see... Oh!

3367
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:51,070
Nice!

3368
02:00:51,450 --> 02:00:51,730
Wait.

3369
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:52,030
That's good.

3370
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:53,550
That's great.

3371
02:00:54,630 --> 02:00:56,110
Free super chat!

3372
02:00:56,390 --> 02:00:56,830
Yes.

3373
02:00:57,170 --> 02:01:01,690
When you get to level 4 super chat time, all super chats become free.

3374
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:02,990
That is my goal.

3375
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:10,270
We need to hit level 4 super chat so it can be free and then we can bankrupt YouTube!

3376
02:01:10,890 --> 02:01:12,210
It's like Amazon Prime.

3377
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:15,390
When you subscribe to your favorite Twitch streamer for free.

3378
02:01:16,190 --> 02:01:16,750
Um...

3379
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:19,090
Throw 2 lava buckets.

3380
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:20,250
Super chat time!

3381
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:21,970
David, thank you for the Akka super!

3382
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:22,570
Thank you!

3383
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:23,210
Thank you!

3384
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:24,950
3 or 2.

3385
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:26,250
I guess I'll do...

3386
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:27,950
I'll do 2 then.

3387
02:01:29,150 --> 02:01:29,710
Nice.

3388
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:31,250
Level 3.

3389
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:34,750
Every time I look away.

3390
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:36,770
Oh my god.

3391
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:36,930
Wait.

3392
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:37,330
He's gold.

3393
02:01:38,230 --> 02:01:38,590
Wait.

3394
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:39,030
He's gold.

3395
02:01:39,330 --> 02:01:39,970
Why he gold?

3396
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:41,690
Is he stupid?

3397
02:01:43,650 --> 02:01:46,190
We're at level 3 right now!

3398
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:47,870
We're almost there!

3399
02:01:48,630 --> 02:01:49,190
Okay.

3400
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:50,410
Okay.

3401
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:51,110
We're gonna grab this.

3402
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:52,850
Increase crit.

3403
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:55,050
I guess we'll do hope level 3, right?

3404
02:01:55,330 --> 02:01:55,890
Oh!

3405
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:56,690
He's marked!

3406
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:57,390
Oh!

3407
02:01:58,050 --> 02:01:58,350
That's why.

3408
02:01:58,570 --> 02:02:00,110
I'm stupid chat.

3409
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:01,970
I'm stupid.

3410
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:04,690
I'm stupid.

3411
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:07,590
The goal is to have Doki.

3412
02:02:07,770 --> 02:02:09,330
Let Doki... Oh my god!

3413
02:02:09,370 --> 02:02:10,450
We're at level 4!

3414
02:02:11,230 --> 02:02:11,750
Guys!

3415
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:13,210
All super chats are now free!

3416
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:15,370
Um... Asterisk.

3417
02:02:15,670 --> 02:02:16,930
Um... Legally...

3418
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:20,570
Legal wise, all super chats are not free right now.

3419
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:21,610
That is a joke.

3420
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:36,950
Um... If you accidentally delete... If you accidentally try to super chat me all your money and your bank calls me, you cannot use the excuse that, oh, I was watching a Doki bird stream and she told me that level 4 super chats are now free, so I'm exempt from a no.

3421
02:02:37,610 --> 02:02:39,410
Legally speaking, it is a joke.

3422
02:02:40,590 --> 02:02:42,330
But level 4 super chats!

3423
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:43,810
That means free super chats!

3424
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:44,910
Let's go!

3425
02:02:45,330 --> 02:02:45,630
Oh hey!

3426
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:46,730
What's this?

3427
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:50,530
Attacks have a potential to cause an explosion that hits nearby targets.

3428
02:02:50,790 --> 02:02:52,830
For 30% of the weapons... Ooh!

3429
02:02:53,230 --> 02:02:53,930
Wait, that's good.

3430
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:55,850
Wait, wait, wait.

3431
02:02:55,990 --> 02:02:56,550
That's good.

3432
02:02:59,730 --> 02:03:00,890
I was like, what the is?

3433
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:01,990
What is the 4 I want?

3434
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:02,910
Alright.

3435
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:03,230
Oh.

3436
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:04,030
Oh.

3437
02:03:04,170 --> 02:03:04,570
Oh.

3438
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:04,990
Oh.

3439
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:06,870
This is not good.

3440
02:03:07,150 --> 02:03:08,150
This is not good!

3441
02:03:08,370 --> 02:03:09,910
This is not getting good!

3442
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:10,710
I'm gonna run through.

3443
02:03:10,870 --> 02:03:11,830
I'm just gonna run through.

3444
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:13,250
I'm trying to get to the arrow.

3445
02:03:13,430 --> 02:03:15,250
I think I took too many holos.

3446
02:03:15,630 --> 02:03:18,750
Guys, I think I took too many holos.

3447
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:21,530
Oh my god, it's totally free!

3448
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:25,650
Alright, attacks have 3% chance to hit... Bolo coins.

3449
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:25,950
Oh.

3450
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:26,730
Okay, I'm sorry.

3451
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:28,050
We don't need RGBs anymore.

3452
02:03:32,410 --> 02:03:33,670
I'm sorry, RGB.

3453
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:35,110
Oh, I should sell it!

3454
02:03:35,170 --> 02:03:35,610
Wait, I forgot.

3455
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:36,490
I can sell this.

3456
02:03:36,730 --> 02:03:37,970
Oh, I can strengthen this.

3457
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:39,450
Wait, where do we...

3458
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:40,730
Uh, freeze?

3459
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:43,690
Thank you for the super chat.

3460
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:44,350
Thank you, thank you.

3461
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:45,590
Look, I got a freeze!

3462
02:03:45,790 --> 02:03:46,310
Look at that!

3463
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:46,910
It's working!

3464
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:49,270
Other people are getting free super chats too!

3465
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:50,870
Look at that!

3466
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:56,050
Guys, it's working!

3467
02:03:56,370 --> 02:03:57,370
It was a joke, guys.

3468
02:03:57,510 --> 02:03:59,310
Just so you guys remember, this is a joke.

3469
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:04,290
Okay, we'll do elite bucket.

3470
02:04:05,290 --> 02:04:09,090
Too late, I already spent all of my savings.

3471
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:10,650
Thank you for the super chat.

3472
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:11,790
Magenta soup.

3473
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:13,450
Thank you.

3474
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:16,950
Kisser, is it possible to go beyond?

3475
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:19,190
Dad, thank you for the akka soupa!

3476
02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:20,010
Thank you, thank you.

3477
02:04:20,030 --> 02:04:21,850
Did someone say free soupas?

3478
02:04:21,990 --> 02:04:24,230
Thank you for the akka soupa.

3479
02:04:24,430 --> 02:04:25,070
Thank you.

3480
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:28,590
Is there a level five?

3481
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:29,870
Can we go even further?

3482
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:32,670
What the fuck would a level five soupa be?

3483
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:33,930
You just give me your credit card.

3484
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,890
This is...

3485
02:04:41,230 --> 02:04:42,110
Level five.

3486
02:04:42,410 --> 02:04:43,610
We go beyond.

3487
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:46,930
There is a level five?

3488
02:04:47,110 --> 02:04:47,830
Oh my god.

3489
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:48,610
Level five?

3490
02:04:48,610 --> 02:04:51,370
You call your bank and then transfer your bank ownership...

3491
02:04:51,370 --> 02:04:53,130
bank account ownership.

3492
02:04:58,100 --> 02:04:58,910
That is...

3493
02:04:58,910 --> 02:05:00,870
That is level five.

3494
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:02,030
Oh my god!

3495
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:04,570
Guys!

3496
02:05:09,890 --> 02:05:11,170
Oh my god!

3497
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:12,310
It's here!

3498
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:15,630
Oh my god.

3499
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:17,390
Level five.

3500
02:05:18,290 --> 02:05:18,870
The rich!

3501
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:21,010
Alright, let's get that lava.

3502
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:21,890
Oh my god.

3503
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:22,750
I can't believe it.

3504
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:23,990
Oh my god.

3505
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:26,510
Think of all the interest rates we're gonna get together.

3506
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:32,790
There's a level five as a blank check.

3507
02:05:38,290 --> 02:05:39,250
Level five.

3508
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:41,750
You start a trust fund on your doki's name.

3509
02:05:45,190 --> 02:05:46,150
Holy shit.

3510
02:05:46,150 --> 02:05:47,550
I'm still alive!

3511
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:50,590
Free soupas, let's go!

3512
02:05:50,990 --> 02:05:53,190
Thank you for the magenta soupa.

3513
02:05:53,190 --> 02:05:53,530
Thank you.

3514
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:55,270
It's okay.

3515
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:56,150
I'm okay guys.

3516
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:56,710
Look at that.

3517
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:57,170
I'm gaming.

3518
02:05:57,850 --> 02:05:59,350
Iris is truly meta.

3519
02:06:02,150 --> 02:06:03,150
Oh my god.

3520
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:03,990
Iris, I knew...

3521
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:06,370
I knew Santa would not let me down.

3522
02:06:07,170 --> 02:06:08,190
I knew it.

3523
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:12,130
I knew Santa would never let me down!

3524
02:06:12,970 --> 02:06:13,970
Get over here.

3525
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:15,690
Get o- Oh!

3526
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:16,590
Oh my god.

3527
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:17,370
Oh wait, what did I get?

3528
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:17,630
Oh!

3529
02:06:18,010 --> 02:06:18,370
Haste?

3530
02:06:18,410 --> 02:06:19,110
Reduce the time?

3531
02:06:19,170 --> 02:06:19,390
Wait.

3532
02:06:20,930 --> 02:06:21,650
The first...

3533
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:23,330
What do I get rid of?

3534
02:06:23,330 --> 02:06:24,390
Do I get rid of or do I upgrade?

3535
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:26,010
Should I just use this to upgrade?

3536
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:28,570
Do I just use this to upgrade guys?

3537
02:06:29,070 --> 02:06:30,930
Doki, where is my wallet?

3538
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:33,110
Thank you for the super chat.

3539
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:33,530
Thank you.

3540
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:34,230
Thank you.

3541
02:06:34,870 --> 02:06:36,630
Alright, thank you for the fifty gift and chips.

3542
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:37,010
Thank you.

3543
02:06:37,070 --> 02:06:37,570
Thank you.

3544
02:06:39,370 --> 02:06:39,730
Okay.

3545
02:06:40,450 --> 02:06:41,410
We'll beef that up.

3546
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:43,270
Jesus.

3547
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:45,110
We are so strong right now.

3548
02:06:46,150 --> 02:06:47,750
Okay, now I don't know what to upgrade.

3549
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:48,270
They're all new.

3550
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:51,810
Uh...

3551
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:54,270
No!

3552
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:59,550
I just saw upgrade so I got... Inject super chat into my veins.

3553
02:07:00,130 --> 02:07:01,530
Man, thank you for the super chat.

3554
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:02,510
Thank you.

3555
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:03,530
I ruined it!

3556
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:04,070
No!

3557
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:08,150
I got too greedy!

3558
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:13,070
I saw... I went level five and never looked back.

3559
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:19,010
You've changed, Doki.

3560
02:07:19,150 --> 02:07:23,470
Ever since you went to level five super chat, you've changed.

3561
02:07:23,890 --> 02:07:27,070
All those bank accounts changed you.

3562
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:29,430
Alright, let's see.

3563
02:07:29,630 --> 02:07:31,010
I got so greedy.

3564
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:33,530
I got way too greedy.

3565
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:37,150
The greed!

3566
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:40,150
I can't.

3567
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:41,270
I drank the halloo.

3568
02:07:41,450 --> 02:07:42,990
What even is halloo?

3569
02:07:43,190 --> 02:07:43,730
I...

3570
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:46,470
Alright.

3571
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:50,630
Wait, do we do horn or bucket?

3572
02:07:53,670 --> 02:07:56,010
I missed the old Doki.

3573
02:07:59,070 --> 02:07:59,710
One.

3574
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:00,150
Okay.

3575
02:08:00,610 --> 02:08:02,510
Oh my god, Jesus.

3576
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:03,110
Okay.

3577
02:08:03,290 --> 02:08:04,850
I guess we'll go full bucket.

3578
02:08:05,130 --> 02:08:07,350
And then horn or crit?

3579
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:08,150
Chat.

3580
02:08:08,150 --> 02:08:08,410
Chat.

3581
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:12,430
Horn or corn?

3582
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:17,390
Horn is great.

3583
02:08:17,510 --> 02:08:18,210
No need horn.

3584
02:08:18,290 --> 02:08:18,930
Horn three.

3585
02:08:19,470 --> 02:08:20,670
I'll do horn then.

3586
02:08:20,750 --> 02:08:21,090
Horn.

3587
02:08:21,290 --> 02:08:23,850
Oh my god, there's so much more horn.

3588
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:24,330
Oh fuck!

3589
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:24,750
Okay.

3590
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:25,730
Follow me.

3591
02:08:25,770 --> 02:08:26,650
All healing is doubled.

3592
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:27,590
Oh, credit card.

3593
02:08:27,770 --> 02:08:34,110
Cost of enhancing is reduced, but uh... I guess spider cooking or upgrade my stuff?

3594
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:36,390
Credit card or spider cooking?

3595
02:08:37,010 --> 02:08:37,530
Alright.

3596
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:39,150
Oh my god, there's still more.

3597
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:41,590
We'll go bucket since we're almost there.

3598
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:44,010
Stuff five times in a row in one...

3599
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:46,330
Jesus Christ, I did not upgrade.

3600
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:47,350
I did not...

3601
02:08:48,090 --> 02:08:50,150
I was not picking up anything.

3602
02:08:51,470 --> 02:08:52,930
I can't upgrade greed!

3603
02:08:53,090 --> 02:08:53,890
Oh no.

3604
02:08:54,250 --> 02:08:55,450
Big boy is coming.

3605
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:57,870
Uhhhh...

3606
02:08:57,870 --> 02:09:00,210
Can I get rid of marking?

3607
02:09:00,910 --> 02:09:02,810
Should I swap marking for this?

3608
02:09:03,610 --> 02:09:05,710
I'm gonna swap and then...

3609
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,030
Strengthen greed.

3610
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,430
Greed.

3611
02:09:10,510 --> 02:09:11,070
Upgrade.

3612
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:11,570
Okay, upgrade.

3613
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:13,590
Strength.

3614
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:15,430
Alright, nice.

3615
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:19,130
We have... we have bomb.

3616
02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:20,690
We have bomb.

3617
02:09:21,450 --> 02:09:23,090
Go go go go bomb.

3618
02:09:23,210 --> 02:09:23,530
Go.

3619
02:09:24,010 --> 02:09:25,110
Go go bomb.

3620
02:09:25,330 --> 02:09:25,950
You got this.

3621
02:09:26,230 --> 02:09:27,510
Alright, bomb is gone.

3622
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:31,230
Woah!

3623
02:09:31,570 --> 02:09:32,010
Woah!

3624
02:09:32,190 --> 02:09:32,670
Woah!

3625
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:33,990
Okay.

3626
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:37,270
Alright, I'm getting damaged so fucking hard right now.

3627
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:38,090
Is this the half time boss?

3628
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:39,410
This is.

3629
02:09:39,790 --> 02:09:41,250
This is the half time boss.

3630
02:09:41,610 --> 02:09:42,550
Holy shit.

3631
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:44,730
Bro, he's raining money for me though.

3632
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:48,170
He's actually raining money.

3633
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:48,910
It's raining money.

3634
02:09:49,690 --> 02:09:50,230
Let's go.

3635
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:53,170
This is the power of level four super chats.

3636
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:56,750
This is...

3637
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:57,570
I feel so strong.

3638
02:09:58,150 --> 02:09:59,070
I've changed.

3639
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:00,890
I've changed.

3640
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:02,490
Okay.

3641
02:10:02,630 --> 02:10:04,010
Let's grab the box.

3642
02:10:04,290 --> 02:10:04,770
What do I get?

3643
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:05,790
Nice.

3644
02:10:05,790 --> 02:10:06,450
We need that.

3645
02:10:07,310 --> 02:10:08,790
What happened to you Doki?

3646
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:10,690
Ever since... what is this?

3647
02:10:10,790 --> 02:10:13,190
Weapon hits have... uh...

3648
02:10:14,070 --> 02:10:15,230
Oh, I'm on level five.

3649
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:15,670
Sorry.

3650
02:10:16,430 --> 02:10:16,990
Sorry.

3651
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:22,010
The greed caught me so fast that I don't even know what level I'm on.

3652
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:24,830
I'm drunk off all the bank accounts.

3653
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:26,150
There's so many.

3654
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:30,470
Okay, swap.

3655
02:10:30,730 --> 02:10:31,890
And then we upgrade.

3656
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:34,790
Uh... we upgrade.

3657
02:10:34,930 --> 02:10:35,970
Bomb, right?

3658
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:40,400
Greed level...

3659
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,160
We swap, upgrade three.

3660
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:42,420
Okay.

3661
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:43,380
Nice.

3662
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:44,740
Alright, nice.

3663
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:45,620
Oh my god.

3664
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:52,040
There was this conversation earlier about the fucking... Okay, I was gonna say, to give context as to how...

3665
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:59,540
how fucking crazy $400,000 is... like $450,000 for the sphere.

3666
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:03,360
It is $20,000 for one day, by the way.

3667
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:04,920
The sphere is one day.

3668
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:14,180
$400,000 $250,000 and then for one week on... I think it was at...

3669
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:23,400
in Shibuya Station in Tokyo is $20,000 for one week.

3670
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:30,600
That's how expensive...

3671
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,920
I'm heading to the arrow!

3672
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:33,840
Look at all these rats!

3673
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:36,100
I have to kill all the rats first!

3674
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,220
Okay, let me get sick.

3675
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:42,260
Alright, what do we upgrade?

3676
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:43,440
Here we go.

3677
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:44,680
We'll upgrade the...

3678
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:47,780
We'll upgrade the blast.

3679
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:50,140
Alright, and then...

3680
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:51,720
Oh my god, I got weapon will fire.

3681
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:53,580
There is no other effect!

3682
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,260
It will fire backwards!

3683
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:57,900
Okay, then...

3684
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:01,360
What do we upgrade here?

3685
02:12:04,460 --> 02:12:04,980
Um...

3686
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:06,440
Speed!

3687
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:07,800
Thank you for the five gifted ships!

3688
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:08,200
Thank you!

3689
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:08,720
Thank you!

3690
02:12:09,700 --> 02:12:10,360
Strengthen two?

3691
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:11,180
Okay, strengthen.

3692
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:12,340
Alright.

3693
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:15,460
Is there any more arrows?

3694
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:17,020
Okay, there's no more arrows.

3695
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:17,860
We should be good.

3696
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:20,060
Holy shit!

3697
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:21,760
We're so fucking strong right now.

3698
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,360
Stage one is Ashley, baby.

3699
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:25,200
Alright.

3700
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:30,100
We haven't got like the...

3701
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,220
the collab stuff yet though.

3702
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:34,240
I need to grab the collabs.

3703
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:37,180
Now I know why people can stream hours of this game.

3704
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:43,800
I watch like the VOD, like see the VOD timestamp of this game and it's like uh, five plus hours.

3705
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:45,400
I understand now.

3706
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:46,600
I understand.

3707
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:49,680
I get it now, chat.

3708
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,140
I figured it out.

3709
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:53,180
This is very addicting.

3710
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:56,000
Guys, I know my directions!

3711
02:12:56,180 --> 02:12:58,480
I'm heading down for once in my life.

3712
02:12:58,620 --> 02:12:59,880
I figured out where to go.

3713
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:00,720
Hahaha!

3714
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:04,220
Wait, we're at two hours?

3715
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:07,060
I've been playing this game for two hours now?

3716
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:08,420
Holy fuck!

3717
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:10,080
Jesus, okay.

3718
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:11,860
Okay.

3719
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,100
This might be a problem.

3720
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:14,280
Hahaha!

3721
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:19,060
I did not feel the two hours.

3722
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:20,440
Not gonna... wait, is this good?

3723
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:25,280
Attacks have 20% chance at uh...

3724
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:26,640
Let's see.

3725
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:29,800
Yeah, I can...

3726
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:31,080
I should upgrade this.

3727
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:31,900
Alright.

3728
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,720
Two upgrade, right?

3729
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:36,720
Is that... uh...

3730
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:37,400
Alright, well...

3731
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:38,980
Because I didn't know if I should...

3732
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:41,020
Oh my god, I'm so rich!

3733
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:42,420
I'm so rich!

3734
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:43,500
I can finally upgrade...

3735
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:46,800
You know, I remember when you guys kept yelling at me to upgrade stats.

3736
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:52,160
Like, when you guys would yell stats, and I thought that you meant like the talent...

3737
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:54,320
The talent has really good stats.

3738
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:57,980
And that's what I thought you meant when you guys kept yelling stats at me.

3739
02:13:58,100 --> 02:13:59,760
And not because of...

3740
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:00,440
Hahaha!

3741
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:05,840
When in reality, you were telling me to purchase my stat upgrades.

3742
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:06,640
And...

3743
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,280
I couldn't tell.

3744
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:12,840
I couldn't tell.

3745
02:14:14,740 --> 02:14:16,780
Yelling... Yeah, I was like, what's the context?

3746
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,020
I was like, why does my chat keep yelling stats at me?

3747
02:14:20,140 --> 02:14:21,140
I don't understand.

3748
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:23,740
Why would they keep yelling that?

3749
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:27,540
Is it because the talents are really... have really good stats in general?

3750
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:29,560
Like, what is the context?

3751
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:31,140
Hahaha!

3752
02:14:31,140 --> 02:14:31,220
Hahaha!

3753
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:35,240
Where the fuck is the context?

3754
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:36,720
Alright.

3755
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:38,740
We'll do... We'll max up the cooking.

3756
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:39,500
Alright.

3757
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:40,860
You know what?

3758
02:14:41,220 --> 02:14:42,600
Am I sure about this?

3759
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:43,860
I am so sure.

3760
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:46,640
Bro, this is fucking baby shit.

3761
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:47,600
I'm so sure.

3762
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:48,420
Alright.

3763
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:49,980
Do we get bandage?

3764
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:51,720
We're doing it.

3765
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:52,580
We are max... We're...

3766
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:54,160
We're so fucking... Look at that.

3767
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:56,440
$6000 now.

3768
02:14:56,660 --> 02:15:00,220
I have like so many bank accounts in my... Hahaha!

3769
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:04,680
I have... I have so many bank accounts now.

3770
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:05,320
Hahaha!

3771
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:07,060
Don't...

3772
02:15:07,060 --> 02:15:08,240
I'm gonna do it!

3773
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:10,660
What's the worst that's gonna happen?

3774
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:11,880
Hahaha!

3775
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:13,960
Alright.

3776
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:14,800
Now this is all new.

3777
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:15,540
I don't know what to get.

3778
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:17,420
I'm locked in.

3779
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,880
I am full on hollow now.

3780
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,640
Look at the... I'm fucking drunk with power.

3781
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:25,240
I'm a level 5 super chatter.

3782
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:27,680
Why is chat yelling?

3783
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:28,360
Are they stupid?

3784
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:30,500
I don't think it was a super chat.

3785
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:30,820
They...

3786
02:15:31,140 --> 02:15:31,520
Thank you.

3787
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:32,340
Alright.

3788
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:33,420
One or four.

3789
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:35,760
Uhh... We'll do...

3790
02:15:37,060 --> 02:15:37,840
We'll do four.

3791
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:38,400
Okay.

3792
02:15:38,980 --> 02:15:40,600
What's the worst that could happen?

3793
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:41,340
Anyway.

3794
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:43,380
I'm so much money.

3795
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:45,100
Like, come on.

3796
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:47,080
We're gonna do... Nothing!

3797
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:49,700
Where the fuck is the collab anvil?

3798
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:50,420
Alright.

3799
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:51,260
What do we upgrade, chat?

3800
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:54,720
I already upgraded the blast.

3801
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:57,120
I know, but I have to...

3802
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:58,600
I have to kill... I have to get the one up.

3803
02:15:58,660 --> 02:16:00,260
I need to go up before I can go down.

3804
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:07,680
Chat, I need to go up before I can go down.

3805
02:16:11,060 --> 02:16:12,940
Wait, did I just accidentally pay for that?

3806
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:14,780
Alright.

3807
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:15,020
Yeah.

3808
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:17,220
Oh my gosh.

3809
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:18,820
No regrets.

3810
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:20,480
No regrets.

3811
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:22,180
Wait, what's that?

3812
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:23,200
Peaky, peeky?

3813
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:24,320
Wait, is this good?

3814
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:25,940
I don't know if I should get this.

3815
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:26,900
I haven't grabbed this before.

3816
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:31,140
Wait, grab this or nah?

3817
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:34,880
Take it?

3818
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:36,300
It's called investment?

3819
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:37,540
Is it good?

3820
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:39,100
Take it.

3821
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:39,340
Okay.

3822
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:40,400
I believe.

3823
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:41,480
I trust you guys.

3824
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:42,980
There's no way you guys would fuck me over.

3825
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:45,900
Unlike all the other times you guys fucked me over.

3826
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:48,260
This time, there's no way you guys would fuck me over.

3827
02:16:51,460 --> 02:16:51,860
Okay.

3828
02:16:54,740 --> 02:16:59,020
Compared to all the other times you guys tried to fuck me over, there's no way this time it'll work.

3829
02:16:59,040 --> 02:16:59,720
Uh.

3830
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:06,200
We would never.

3831
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:08,360
It was not one guy!

3832
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:09,620
I literally see!

3833
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:12,560
Two for collab?

3834
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:14,140
Two?

3835
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:14,740
Okay.

3836
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:16,600
Alright.

3837
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:17,680
What do we get, chat?

3838
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:19,500
What do we upgrade?

3839
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:24,740
It's not one guy if it was multiple guys.

3840
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:27,020
It could be multiple one guys though.

3841
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:27,680
Uh.

3842
02:17:30,620 --> 02:17:31,100
Two?

3843
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:32,000
Or three?

3844
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:33,080
Upgrade two and three?

3845
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:33,480
Okay.

3846
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:34,080
We'll do...

3847
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:36,220
We'll do two upgrade first.

3848
02:17:37,140 --> 02:17:37,620
Alright.

3849
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:37,980
Nice.

3850
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:40,920
We're good now.

3851
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:41,660
Alright.

3852
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:42,800
And then...

3853
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:44,500
What do we get here?

3854
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:46,400
Uh.

3855
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:49,400
Do we upgrade the pikki or the bomb?

3856
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:52,680
I think it was multiple two guys.

3857
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:55,000
You need level seven weapons for collab?

3858
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:56,160
Thank you, super chat master.

3859
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:56,560
Thank you.

3860
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:57,760
Three?

3861
02:17:59,180 --> 02:17:59,760
Okay.

3862
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:01,700
This is fine.

3863
02:18:02,420 --> 02:18:04,620
There is so many sparkles up here.

3864
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:05,820
Jesus Christ.

3865
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:08,800
Oh no.

3866
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:09,940
What's coming down?

3867
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:10,960
Okay.

3868
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:12,480
Oh my god!

3869
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:12,800
Okay.

3870
02:18:12,900 --> 02:18:13,500
I need to...

3871
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:15,840
I need to get rid of the...

3872
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:20,160
We need...

3873
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:22,200
There's way too much flashes.

3874
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:22,820
Okay.

3875
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,400
Is it the visual effects?

3876
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:25,660
Okay.

3877
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:26,040
Let's see.

3878
02:18:27,060 --> 02:18:28,700
Is it the visual effects?

3879
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:30,660
Oh my god.

3880
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:30,800
Yeah.

3881
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:31,280
There we go.

3882
02:18:31,460 --> 02:18:34,060
There's like... That was like way too many flashes.

3883
02:18:36,620 --> 02:18:37,800
There's like... That was like way too many flashes.

3884
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:41,200
That was like insane.

3885
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:44,880
Alright.

3886
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:45,420
There we go.

3887
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:45,980
The numbers!

3888
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:46,880
What do they mean?

3889
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,640
What do the numbers mean?

3890
02:18:50,900 --> 02:18:52,140
Can I fix my settings?

3891
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:52,740
I don't remember.

3892
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:54,140
Alright.

3893
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:54,960
Wait.

3894
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,140
What if I do damage?

3895
02:18:57,340 --> 02:18:58,120
What effects is this?

3896
02:18:59,040 --> 02:18:59,320
Was it...

3897
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:00,420
Yeah.

3898
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:00,960
It was.

3899
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:04,900
Let's get rid of that.

3900
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:06,980
No!

3901
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:07,700
The numbers!

3902
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:09,960
We're fine.

3903
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:11,780
Now it's not flashing anymore.

3904
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:13,700
Alright.

3905
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:17,020
Let's increase damage by 5% for each weapon.

3906
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:17,500
Okay.

3907
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:18,140
We maxed everything.

3908
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:19,780
Yeah.

3909
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:20,940
We don't... We can sell this.

3910
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:22,640
Nice.

3911
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:22,940
Alright.

3912
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:25,060
There's another arrow below me.

3913
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:25,600
Oh no.

3914
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:26,960
Oh no.

3915
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:27,380
Okay.

3916
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:28,980
We'll grab this.

3917
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:30,380
Okay.

3918
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:31,120
Oh no.

3919
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:32,060
I'm trying to go down.

3920
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:33,980
Oh my

3921
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:40,720
god!

3922
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:41,600
They're so fast!

3923
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:43,600
Guys!

3924
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:44,200
Okay.

3925
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:44,820
We're fine.

3926
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:45,720
Oh.

3927
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:51,920
Okay.

3928
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:53,740
Okay.

3929
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:54,720
I forgot the...

3930
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:56,480
The Halu shit.

3931
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:59,200
I forgot the Halu shit.

3932
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:01,920
The Halu shit.

3933
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:03,320
Uh...

3934
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:05,260
Three.

3935
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:05,620
Okay.

3936
02:20:06,180 --> 02:20:06,620
Okay.

3937
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:07,140
We're gonna...

3938
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:08,320
This is bad.

3939
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:09,400
This is bad.

3940
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:10,800
I should not have... Guys.

3941
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:11,880
I should not...

3942
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:12,120
Guys.

3943
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:14,880
I realized that maybe... I should not have went full in on Halu.

3944
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:18,400
I should not have went full in on Halu.

3945
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:21,140
Oh my god!

3946
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:21,540
I did it!

3947
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:23,220
Oh my god!

3948
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:23,680
I did it!

3949
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:26,390
Magnet!

3950
02:20:26,450 --> 02:20:27,510
There's so many!

3951
02:20:29,910 --> 02:20:30,830
There's so many.

3952
02:20:30,890 --> 02:20:33,090
It's gonna take forever to get the magnet chat.

3953
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:33,970
Please.

3954
02:20:34,150 --> 02:20:34,970
Oh god.

3955
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,350
Please.

3956
02:20:35,870 --> 02:20:36,010
Oh!

3957
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:38,190
Fucking don't go full Halu!

3958
02:20:39,910 --> 02:20:40,190
Guys.

3959
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:41,710
Never go full Halu.

3960
02:20:44,230 --> 02:20:46,130
I made my mistakes.

3961
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:48,490
Guys.

3962
02:20:48,670 --> 02:20:50,010
Never go full Halu.

3963
02:20:54,330 --> 02:20:56,030
I can't believe it.

3964
02:20:56,090 --> 02:20:58,430
When the upgrade said don't do it.

3965
02:20:58,490 --> 02:20:59,730
Why did I do it?

3966
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:03,610
Who would have thought?

3967
02:21:04,330 --> 02:21:05,890
Who would have thought?

3968
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:07,790
When it says don't do it.

3969
02:21:07,810 --> 02:21:09,550
You should not do it.

3970
02:21:13,830 --> 02:21:15,870
I can't believe it.

3971
02:21:16,110 --> 02:21:17,850
Oh my god.

3972
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:20,550
Oh my god.

3973
02:21:21,850 --> 02:21:22,470
Okay.

3974
02:21:22,510 --> 02:21:22,890
Two.

3975
02:21:24,070 --> 02:21:24,380
Uh...

3976
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:26,590
Two bombs.

3977
02:21:26,950 --> 02:21:27,270
Okay.

3978
02:21:28,090 --> 02:21:29,010
Oh my god.

3979
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:29,490
It's okay.

3980
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:31,050
We got the box.

3981
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:32,430
Axe?

3982
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:33,570
Did we pick up the axe?

3983
02:21:34,150 --> 02:21:35,470
Should we pick up the axe?

3984
02:21:36,510 --> 02:21:38,490
Always go full Halu.

3985
02:21:43,830 --> 02:21:44,350
Yeah?

3986
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:44,870
Drop?

3987
02:21:45,130 --> 02:21:45,470
Okay.

3988
02:21:45,810 --> 02:21:46,330
Yes.

3989
02:21:46,590 --> 02:21:46,810
Okay.

3990
02:21:46,850 --> 02:21:48,290
I see more takes than drops.

3991
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:49,830
Alright.

3992
02:21:49,850 --> 02:21:50,250
What is this?

3993
02:21:50,390 --> 02:21:50,570
Oh.

3994
02:21:50,590 --> 02:21:51,250
I got another axe.

3995
02:21:51,330 --> 02:21:51,510
Nice.

3996
02:21:51,870 --> 02:21:52,390
Okay.

3997
02:21:52,410 --> 02:21:53,530
We don't need to take that magnet.

3998
02:21:53,610 --> 02:21:56,390
We already have like way too many magnets anyway.

3999
02:21:58,010 --> 02:22:01,090
We have more than enough magnets chat.

4000
02:22:01,090 --> 02:22:02,130
Alright.

4001
02:22:02,390 --> 02:22:03,190
It's fine.

4002
02:22:03,370 --> 02:22:03,950
It's fine.

4003
02:22:04,070 --> 02:22:04,450
It is.

4004
02:22:04,550 --> 02:22:05,370
Oh my god.

4005
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:06,370
It might not be fine.

4006
02:22:06,570 --> 02:22:08,190
It might not be FINE!

4007
02:22:09,450 --> 02:22:10,350
Oh my god.

4008
02:22:11,790 --> 02:22:12,910
Holy shit.

4009
02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:14,050
We're okay.

4010
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:16,750
I'm following the arrows!

4011
02:22:21,730 --> 02:22:23,150
Oh my god.

4012
02:22:23,230 --> 02:22:24,230
Three or four.

4013
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:25,610
Four?

4014
02:22:25,790 --> 02:22:26,210
Okay.

4015
02:22:26,690 --> 02:22:27,250
Okay.

4016
02:22:28,190 --> 02:22:28,750
Uh...

4017
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:30,250
We might as well grab the axe.

4018
02:22:30,890 --> 02:22:31,330
Okay.

4019
02:22:31,390 --> 02:22:31,970
There is a hammer.

4020
02:22:32,090 --> 02:22:33,210
I don't know what the hammer does.

4021
02:22:33,350 --> 02:22:34,030
What did that do?

4022
02:22:34,630 --> 02:22:35,610
What did I do?

4023
02:22:35,650 --> 02:22:36,850
I just walked over it.

4024
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:38,010
And I don't know what happened.

4025
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:40,430
What the fuck does the hammer do?

4026
02:22:42,570 --> 02:22:44,030
What did it do?

4027
02:22:44,270 --> 02:22:45,450
I can't tell.

4028
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:50,610
It's a super intense... a super collab?

4029
02:22:50,990 --> 02:22:51,230
Oh.

4030
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:51,750
Okay.

4031
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:53,150
Nothing.

4032
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:53,490
Okay.

4033
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:54,930
Yes you are.

4034
02:22:54,930 --> 02:22:55,410
Hello there.

4035
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:59,070
I can't believe.

4036
02:22:59,170 --> 02:23:01,190
The devs didn't warn me about HALO.

4037
02:23:02,210 --> 02:23:04,370
I can't believe it.

4038
02:23:04,690 --> 02:23:06,370
I can't believe it.

4039
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:10,370
Why didn't they warn me?

4040
02:23:13,910 --> 02:23:16,670
How could they not do that.

4041
02:23:16,970 --> 02:23:17,310
How could they not do that.

4042
02:23:17,310 --> 02:23:19,130
I can't believe it.

4043
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:20,610
Okay.

4044
02:23:20,830 --> 02:23:21,210
Okay.

4045
02:23:21,890 --> 02:23:24,050
Let's just keep going.

4046
02:23:24,930 --> 02:23:25,530
Green over here.

4047
02:23:26,170 --> 02:23:27,550
Let's grab the green first.

4048
02:23:28,610 --> 02:23:29,650
What is the green?

4049
02:23:31,410 --> 02:23:35,190
Attacks have 20% chance to reduce attack and defense of targets but...

4050
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:36,370
We don't need that, right?

4051
02:23:38,270 --> 02:23:39,530
We don't need that.

4052
02:23:42,490 --> 02:23:44,690
Why would it... it's like the bicycle meme.

4053
02:23:44,930 --> 02:23:47,310
You know, when you're riding the bicycle and...

4054
02:23:48,070 --> 02:23:50,490
And then it's like, upgrade Halu.

4055
02:23:50,770 --> 02:23:53,170
And I was like, why would the devs do this?

4056
02:23:55,970 --> 02:23:58,510
Did I stick the stick into my bicycle?

4057
02:23:58,810 --> 02:24:00,910
How could the devs do this to me?

4058
02:24:04,690 --> 02:24:05,810
Oh no.

4059
02:24:06,090 --> 02:24:07,610
Oh no.

4060
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:08,590
I'm trying.

4061
02:24:09,850 --> 02:24:10,410
Okay.

4062
02:24:10,610 --> 02:24:13,870
We're gonna try and figure out how to get to the other side.

4063
02:24:14,050 --> 02:24:17,570
Oh my god, there's the anvil but I can't do anything about it!

4064
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:18,650
There's a trumpet too!

4065
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:21,550
There's too many things on my screen.

4066
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:24,830
Alright, nice.

4067
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:25,570
We got...

4068
02:24:27,550 --> 02:24:28,070
Okay.

4069
02:24:28,150 --> 02:24:29,450
We can...

4070
02:24:32,390 --> 02:24:37,210
No, we have to save our ultimate!

4071
02:24:39,430 --> 02:24:40,110
Let's see.

4072
02:24:41,330 --> 02:24:42,230
What do we do?

4073
02:24:42,610 --> 02:24:43,290
Swap to?

4074
02:24:43,510 --> 02:24:45,250
For the projectile stamp?

4075
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:47,390
Or sell it?

4076
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:49,170
Or do we wait for...

4077
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:50,490
Swap to.

4078
02:24:50,610 --> 02:24:51,170
Okay, swap.

4079
02:24:52,510 --> 02:24:53,030
Confirm.

4080
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:54,510
And then...

4081
02:24:56,010 --> 02:24:56,570
Strengthen.

4082
02:24:56,970 --> 02:24:57,530
Yeah.

4083
02:24:57,630 --> 02:24:58,230
There you go.

4084
02:24:58,770 --> 02:25:00,690
Okay, and then we're gonna grab this anvil.

4085
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:04,050
Let's see.

4086
02:25:04,530 --> 02:25:05,650
Do we get...

4087
02:25:05,650 --> 02:25:06,770
I guess we can...

4088
02:25:09,070 --> 02:25:10,470
And then we'll do...

4089
02:25:10,850 --> 02:25:11,130
The...

4090
02:25:11,130 --> 02:25:11,770
Yeah.

4091
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:14,370
Alright, we gotta grab the trumpet.

4092
02:25:14,830 --> 02:25:16,030
Give me a sec!

4093
02:25:16,210 --> 02:25:17,150
Oh my god!

4094
02:25:17,990 --> 02:25:19,930
Holy shit, he's so strong!

4095
02:25:20,450 --> 02:25:21,410
Okay, we're gonna...

4096
02:25:21,410 --> 02:25:22,890
Okay, we're so slow.

4097
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:25,170
We are so slow right now.

4098
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:26,810
Oh my god.

4099
02:25:26,850 --> 02:25:28,510
We actually need to be faster.

4100
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:31,550
You're not the trumpet!

4101
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:36,180
Oh my god.

4102
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:37,600
You're not the trumpet.

4103
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:41,480
Oh my god.

4104
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:44,060
Alright.

4105
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:48,940
I'm gonna upgrade.

4106
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:51,860
Wait, is it max?

4107
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:53,020
I already maxed it out?

4108
02:25:53,220 --> 02:25:54,240
Okay, we're gonna drop...

4109
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:55,120
I'm gonna drop this for now.

4110
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:56,740
I'm gonna drop this for now.

4111
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:58,140
We get to get the trumpet.

4112
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:02,400
Max, okay.

4113
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:03,740
Oh my god.

4114
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:04,780
We're so fucked.

4115
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:05,700
We are so fucked.

4116
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:07,020
I can't get the trumpet!

4117
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:08,140
There's so many people!

4118
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:10,820
I'm so slow!

4119
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:14,040
Oh no!

4120
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:17,720
Oh, please have a speed somewhere!

4121
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:20,220
Okay.

4122
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:23,140
Max.

4123
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:24,220
I maxed it out.

4124
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:24,480
There's the bomb!

4125
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:26,360
There's the club!

4126
02:26:38,810 --> 02:26:39,450
Okay.

4127
02:26:39,650 --> 02:26:39,970
Alright.

4128
02:26:40,610 --> 02:26:40,790
Alright.

4129
02:26:40,950 --> 02:26:43,050
What do we replace?

4130
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:43,990
Swap two.

4131
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:45,130
Okay.

4132
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:46,790
We swap two.

4133
02:26:47,150 --> 02:26:49,230
And then...

4134
02:26:49,230 --> 02:26:51,170
And then...

4135
02:26:52,310 --> 02:26:53,430
Wait, do we...

4136
02:26:53,430 --> 02:26:54,410
Don't even...

4137
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:55,390
Wait, do we swap two?

4138
02:26:55,490 --> 02:26:55,890
Okay.

4139
02:26:56,170 --> 02:26:57,150
Don't keep...

4140
02:26:57,150 --> 02:26:57,570
What do we...

4141
02:26:57,570 --> 02:26:58,010
What is this?

4142
02:26:58,030 --> 02:26:58,250
What's that?

4143
02:26:58,330 --> 02:26:59,170
There's no...

4144
02:27:02,650 --> 02:27:06,450
You made me risk my life for...

4145
02:27:06,450 --> 02:27:06,630
I'm so sorry.

4146
02:27:06,630 --> 02:27:07,650
Wait, do I...

4147
02:27:11,780 --> 02:27:14,280
You're trying to take advantage of me?

4148
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:20,440
We almost...

4149
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:27,180
It literally said, weapon will sound like a trumpet.

4150
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:28,660
There is no way.

4151
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:32,260
You guys are so close.

4152
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:33,380
You guys almost got me.

4153
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:34,320
You guys...

4154
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:36,040
You guys almost got me.

4155
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:39,020
You guys almost got me.

4156
02:27:39,020 --> 02:27:39,320
You guys almost got me.

4157
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:40,760
I can't believe it.

4158
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:42,900
I could have sold this a long time ago.

4159
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:44,540
I can't believe it.

4160
02:27:46,060 --> 02:27:48,340
You almost got me to do...

4161
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:51,280
Oh my god.

4162
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:51,860
It can't...

4163
02:27:51,860 --> 02:27:52,220
Oh!

4164
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:53,540
It changed!

4165
02:27:55,180 --> 02:27:55,680
Guys!

4166
02:27:56,700 --> 02:27:57,380
Okay.

4167
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:57,940
We're fine.

4168
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:59,660
We're so fucking fine.

4169
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,860
We're the fucking super collab.

4170
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:04,560
Oh god.

4171
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:05,260
Oh, okay.

4172
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:06,820
Okay.

4173
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:08,600
Super collab time.

4174
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:09,320
Oh, okay.

4175
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:10,360
Limited time.

4176
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:11,020
Only...

4177
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:13,420
Only 5,000 yen.

4178
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:14,880
Oh god.

4179
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:15,600
I'm so slow.

4180
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,540
I'm so slow.

4181
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:20,880
Can't be out of here.

4182
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:23,080
Oh my god.

4183
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:24,040
We need more speed.

4184
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:25,620
Everybody's so fast!

4185
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:27,880
Okay.

4186
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:28,560
We have to go around.

4187
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:29,880
It's okay.

4188
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:31,300
At least we have like...

4189
02:28:31,300 --> 02:28:32,420
Holy shit.

4190
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:37,860
The only thing that's saving me right now is the fact that my attack has knocked back.

4191
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:39,320
Because every time I do a...

4192
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:40,580
Everybody's faster than me.

4193
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:45,040
Everybody is so fucking fast.

4194
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:49,340
Okay.

4195
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:50,300
Okay.

4196
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:51,020
We got...

4197
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:52,200
We take this or nah?

4198
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:55,320
Of course now she decides to read.

4199
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:55,800
Yo.

4200
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:57,200
Thank you for the super chat.

4201
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:57,700
Thank you.

4202
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:58,420
Thank you.

4203
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:06,080
I'm literally living because of my knock back.

4204
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:08,500
There's nothing else that's fucking keeping me alive.

4205
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:09,260
Okay.

4206
02:29:11,160 --> 02:29:13,600
Increase attack size by 15%.

4207
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:15,000
Is that good or not?

4208
02:29:17,300 --> 02:29:19,520
The dude would have been better.

4209
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:22,280
Thank you for the super chat.

4210
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:22,620
Thank you.

4211
02:29:22,660 --> 02:29:23,020
Thank you.

4212
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:25,260
This wouldn't have been a problem if you hadn't skipped on it.

4213
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:25,940
Dude!

4214
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:28,040
Thank you for the super chat.

4215
02:29:28,120 --> 02:29:28,500
Thank you.

4216
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:29,060
Thank you.

4217
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:31,760
Oh my god, he's angry.

4218
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:34,500
He's so fucking angry now.

4219
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:40,960
I'm trying so hard to figure out... to like... maybe hope that we get...

4220
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:45,160
Hope that we can get... grab a fucking magnet right now.

4221
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:46,860
This is not good for me.

4222
02:29:47,880 --> 02:29:49,920
This is not good.

4223
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:51,240
Okay.

4224
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:52,400
Don't worry.

4225
02:29:52,780 --> 02:29:54,120
I have knockback.

4226
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:56,100
I have knockback.

4227
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:58,200
They can't fuck their... they might be faster!

4228
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:01,220
But I have the power of knockback!

4229
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:03,900
Oh my god.

4230
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:04,480
Imagine that.

4231
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:10,160
Imagine the amount of money I would have made if I played endless mode.

4232
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:12,780
I should have played endless mode.

4233
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:15,180
I didn't... Oh my god.

4234
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:16,840
Oh my god.

4235
02:30:16,860 --> 02:30:18,400
I could have made so much money!

4236
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:22,640
Bro, this was the money maker!

4237
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:24,860
This was...

4238
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:27,560
This was the money maker round!

4239
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:29,840
Oh no.

4240
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:30,820
Oh no.

4241
02:30:30,860 --> 02:30:32,440
This is an issue right now.

4242
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:33,840
This is a problem.

4243
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:37,340
This is... This is a huge problem!

4244
02:30:39,700 --> 02:30:40,980
Oh no.

4245
02:30:41,580 --> 02:30:42,760
Oh no.

4246
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,160
This is pretty bad.

4247
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:50,700
There was a pillar!

4248
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:55,650
There was a pillar chat.

4249
02:30:55,990 --> 02:30:56,790
I got hit.

4250
02:30:56,850 --> 02:30:57,750
I hit the pillar.

4251
02:30:58,010 --> 02:30:59,470
I hit the pillar.

4252
02:31:01,010 --> 02:31:03,350
One pillar is all it took.

4253
02:31:06,170 --> 02:31:07,790
It was so close.

4254
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:09,970
Okay, maybe we'll get...

4255
02:31:09,970 --> 02:31:10,690
We'll get...

4256
02:31:10,690 --> 02:31:11,290
Wait, what is it?

4257
02:31:11,330 --> 02:31:12,490
Is Risu also meta?

4258
02:31:14,190 --> 02:31:15,150
Where's Risu?

4259
02:31:15,410 --> 02:31:15,930
Okay.

4260
02:31:16,830 --> 02:31:18,490
Risu is also meta, right?

4261
02:31:18,750 --> 02:31:20,010
But I'm gonna do 31.

4262
02:31:22,990 --> 02:31:24,510
Risu is super meta?

4263
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:25,930

02:31:28,010 --> 02:31:29,190
Oh, it's also... Okay.

4266
02:31:30,290 --> 02:31:31,370
Risu is good for money.

4267
02:31:31,430 --> 02:31:33,290
Okay, what is good for endgame?

4268
02:31:33,790 --> 02:31:35,810
Okay, what is good for endgame?

4269
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:38,710
Which one is... Which one is endgame material?

02:31:39,570 --> 02:31:40,810
No doki, dude.

4271
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:42,070
Sad trumpet noise.

4272
02:31:42,390 --> 02:31:43,410
Thank you for the super chat.

4273
02:31:43,530 --> 02:31:43,890
Thank you.

4274
02:31:43,930 --> 02:31:44,490
Thank you.

4275
02:31:50,830 --> 02:31:51,310
Okay.

4276
02:31:53,130 --> 02:31:53,610
Damn.

4277
02:31:53,830 --> 02:31:56,550
Promise has like super... all the meta characters.

4278
02:31:57,750 --> 02:31:59,110
Alright, where the fuck is Promise?

4279
02:31:59,330 --> 02:31:59,790
There you go.

4280
02:32:00,030 --> 02:32:01,190
Alright, we'll do...

4281
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:02,470
We'll do two.

4282
02:32:02,590 --> 02:32:03,290
Maybe two.

4283
02:32:03,430 --> 02:32:04,330
It'll be fine.

4284
02:32:04,330 --> 02:32:05,510
Come on.

4285
02:32:06,310 --> 02:32:07,450
Come on.

4286
02:32:07,610 --> 02:32:08,170
Are you...

4287
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:15,100
How is this possible?

4288
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:21,560
Okay.

4289
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:23,760
It can't happen twice in a row.

4290
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:36,460
It can't happen three times in a row, right?

4291
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:39,320
Okay.

4292
02:32:39,460 --> 02:32:40,760
We're at the pity stage.

4293
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:41,200
Let's go.

4294
02:32:42,860 --> 02:32:44,080
We're at the pity stage.

4295
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:47,300
Alright.

4296
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:48,140
There we go.

4297
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,900
We're at the pity now.

4298
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:50,740
Alright.

4299
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:51,500
We're at the pity.

4300
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:52,040
Let's go!

4301
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:53,700
Woo!

4302
02:32:57,380 --> 02:32:57,940
Wait.

4303
02:32:58,120 --> 02:32:58,340
No.

4304
02:32:58,660 --> 02:32:59,220
Okay.

4305
02:32:59,320 --> 02:33:00,060
We have pity.

4306
02:33:00,540 --> 02:33:01,100
What?

4307
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,780
Is it Fauna or Mumei?

4308
02:33:03,740 --> 02:33:05,460
That's my Oshii.

4309
02:33:05,860 --> 02:33:07,380
Just use the tears.

4310
02:33:07,960 --> 02:33:08,520
Okay.

4311
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:11,220
I can't believe it.

4312
02:33:12,020 --> 02:33:13,800
I can't fucking believe it.

4313
02:33:13,860 --> 02:33:15,920
I can't believe I had to pity pull for Mumei.

4314
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:18,120
Like I can't fucking believe.

4315
02:33:18,820 --> 02:33:22,220
I have to pity pull for her.

4316
02:33:22,340 --> 02:33:23,700
That's so fucked up.

4317
02:33:23,720 --> 02:33:24,840
This is why I don't do gacha.

4318
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:28,340
I swear to fucking...

4319
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:35,120
Oh

4320
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:42,920

4321
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:46,300
Look how much I can upgrade her.

4322
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:46,860
Wow.

4323
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:48,140
I'm so happy.

4324
02:33:54,410 --> 02:33:55,770
Alright.

4325
02:33:55,890 --> 02:33:57,410
Let's get some stats now.

4326
02:33:57,670 --> 02:33:58,630
Let's grab.

4327
02:33:59,130 --> 02:34:00,150

Okay.

4333
02:34:04,250 --> 02:34:05,510
I don't need luck.

4334
02:34:05,730 --> 02:34:07,670
I earn everything.

4335
02:34:07,970 --> 02:34:12,190
With sheer determination and hard work.

4336
02:34:13,530 --> 02:34:15,450
I don't need luck.

4337
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:19,870

Okay.

4341
02:34:24,510 --> 02:34:25,550
It has to be two attacks.

4342
02:34:25,690 --> 02:34:25,910
Alright.

4343
02:34:26,050 --> 02:34:28,330
Let me grab the two attacks real fast.

4344
02:34:28,910 --> 02:34:29,470

4350
02:34:33,150 --> 02:34:34,470
Pick up reins.

4351
02:34:36,030 --> 02:34:37,710
This last word.

4352
02:34:38,030 --> 02:34:38,590
Okay.

4353
02:34:38,650 --> 02:34:39,230
I can upgrade.

4354
02:34:39,330 --> 02:34:40,330
I can max everything.

4355
02:34:42,310 --> 02:34:43,270
Upgrade growth?

4356
02:34:43,730 --> 02:34:44,870
Where the fuck is growth?

4357
02:34:45,170 --> 02:34:46,050
What does that mean?

4358
02:34:50,370 --> 02:34:51,590
Max out which one?

4359
02:34:52,190 --> 02:34:52,750
Speed?

4360
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:54,870
Where to have speed?

4361
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:56,030
Okay.

4362
02:34:56,070 --> 02:34:56,890
What do we max out?

4363
02:34:58,270 --> 02:34:59,370
Upgrade coin game?

4364
02:34:59,570 --> 02:34:59,990

02:35:03,470 --> 02:35:04,510
And then...

4369
02:35:05,190 --> 02:35:05,710
Um...

4370
02:35:06,350 --> 02:35:07,070

02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:14,250
Oh!

4374
02:35:14,730 --> 02:35:15,890
Should I max it out?

4375
02:35:17,490 --> 02:35:21,050
Increase the damage of character in the special attacks by 1%.

4376
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:23,470
Should I do it again?

4377
02:35:23,470 --> 02:35:24,110
Or nah?

4378
02:35:28,350 --> 02:35:29,750
I mean, I could do it one more.

4379
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:30,850
Get to level 2?

4380
02:35:31,570 --> 02:35:32,050
Yeah?

4381
02:35:32,290 --> 02:35:32,550
Alright.

4382
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:33,230
We'll do level 2.

4383
02:35:33,390 --> 02:35:34,450
I mean, we still have enough money.

4384
02:35:34,710 --> 02:35:35,630
And then...

4385
02:35:35,630 --> 02:35:36,710
What else do we get?

4386
02:35:37,070 --> 02:35:37,710
I don't know.

4387
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:42,850
I can't fucking believe.

4388
02:35:43,010 --> 02:35:44,870
I can't fucking...

4389
02:35:47,690 --> 02:35:50,390
I paid to get another Mumei.

4390
02:35:50,570 --> 02:35:52,310

4391
02:35:52,310 --> 02:35:52,690

4392
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:54,410

4394
02:35:55,390 --> 02:35:55,490

02:35:55,490 --> 02:35:57,550
How is that actually possible?

4396
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,290
Holy shit.

Haste.

4406
02:36:11,970 --> 02:36:12,950
I already got...

4407
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:14,230
I don't have enough for another haste.

4408
02:36:14,450 --> 02:36:15,910
I don't have 50,000.

4409
02:36:16,430 --> 02:36:16,950

And then...

4422
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:32,130

4423
02:36:33,050 --> 02:36:33,610

4427
02:36:40,670 --> 02:36:41,230
Wait.

4428
02:36:41,310 --> 02:36:41,790
Where's haste?

4429
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:47,720
Wait.

4430
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:48,360

4431
02:36:48,460 --> 02:36:49,160
I don't have haste.

4432
02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:53,700
I don't know why.

4433
02:36:54,020 --> 02:36:54,880
But like...

4434
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:56,760
I like assume when you say haste.

4435
02:36:56,780 --> 02:36:58,140
You just try to say speed.

4436
02:36:58,320 --> 02:36:58,660
And I was like...

4437
02:36:58,660 --> 02:36:59,780
Maybe that's a British thing.

4438
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:00,220
I don't know.

4439
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:00,980
Maybe...

4440
02:37:00,980 --> 02:37:01,720
Maybe...

4441
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:07,340
Maybe you guys are just trying...

4442
02:37:07,340 --> 02:37:07,620
Like...

4443
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:08,620
Just saying haste.

4444
02:37:08,660 --> 02:37:09,380
Which means speed.

4445
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:09,780
I was like...

4446
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:09,980

4447
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,040
I do have haste.

02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:12,020
It's times three.

4449
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:14,300
It's times three.

4450
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:15,620
Um...

4451
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:18,320

4454
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:20,640
Alright.

4455
02:37:20,700 --> 02:37:21,280
We'll do defense.

4456
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:23,400
We can do another defense too.

4457
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:24,040
We might as well.

4458
02:37:24,180 --> 02:37:24,460
Alright.

4459
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:25,020
There you go.

4460
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:26,160
This is...

4461
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:26,760
This is...

4462
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:27,760
This is our loadout.

4463
02:37:27,820 --> 02:37:28,140
Let's go.

4464
02:37:28,440 --> 02:37:28,980
Alright.

4465
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:29,620
Mumei.

4466
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:30,500
Take me...

4467
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:32,440
Take me to the holo office.

4468
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:34,220
I believe in you.

4469
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:37,420
I believe in you, Mumei.

4470
02:37:37,700 --> 02:37:39,140
You can't fail me.

4471
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:41,220
We so...

4472
02:37:41,220 --> 02:37:42,200
Um...

4473
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:42,640
Joki.

4474
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,860
We don't say haste in the UK.

4475
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:46,000
We said swift.

4476
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:50,700
Learn the difference.

4477
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:53,180
Joki.

4478
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:54,980
Words have specific meaning.

4479
02:37:55,880 --> 02:37:56,500
Guys.

4480
02:37:56,540 --> 02:37:56,740
Alright.

4481
02:37:56,740 --> 02:37:57,960
Oh, bloodthirsty.

4482
02:37:57,960 --> 02:37:58,800
What the fuck?

4483
02:37:59,060 --> 02:37:59,540
Damn.

4484
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:03,060
It's him.

4485
02:38:03,180 --> 02:38:04,100
It's Mumei time.

4486
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:05,540
Do you have one or three?

4487
02:38:06,100 --> 02:38:06,600
Three?

4488
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:07,460
Alright.

4489
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:10,020
I guess because like that's like her main attack, right?

4490
02:38:11,380 --> 02:38:11,880
Uh...

4491
02:38:11,880 --> 02:38:12,480
We'll apply.

4492
02:38:14,540 --> 02:38:19,060
I assume that's because it's like her main attack and then I'll just max out her main attack for now.

4493
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:20,300
Yeah.

4494
02:38:20,340 --> 02:38:21,200
I'll max out her main.

4495
02:38:22,660 --> 02:38:23,640
Just in case.

4496
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:25,840
Alright.

4497
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:26,560
Nice.

4498
02:38:26,740 --> 02:38:28,220
I can't believe.

4499
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:31,160
I can't believe how much...

4500
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:35,680
I can't believe I couldn't...

4501
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:38,520
I can't believe I got fucked over by a pillar.

4502
02:38:39,900 --> 02:38:41,640
That's the only reason why.

4503
02:38:41,980 --> 02:38:43,060
Why I died.

4504
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:47,000
Oh my god.

4505
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:49,440
Why did the devs not warn me about Halu?

4506
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:51,380
Why didn't they stop me?

4507
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:56,000
They could have said something.

4508
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:03,620
They could have said anything to stop me.

4509
02:39:03,720 --> 02:39:03,960
Okay.

4510
02:39:04,060 --> 02:39:04,540
Here we go.

4511
02:39:04,740 --> 02:39:07,120
Of course my second power up is dute.

4512
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:13,060
Here's your doki dutes.

4513
02:39:16,540 --> 02:39:17,500
Here you go.

4514
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:19,140
Here's your dute time.

4515
02:39:19,780 --> 02:39:20,720
Oh no.

4516
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:21,920
Please tell me I can go through.

4517
02:39:22,120 --> 02:39:22,680
Oh!

4518
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:27,180
It's already...

4519
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:28,880
It's already over.

4520
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:31,140
Oh my god.

4521
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:38,660
I don't know how long I'm gonna be over.

4522
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:40,360
It's a curse.

4523
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:41,560
It's...

4524
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:47,290
Am I like just the most unluckiest person?

4525
02:39:47,430 --> 02:39:47,890
You know what?

4526
02:39:48,910 --> 02:39:50,110
Maybe like...

4527
02:39:50,110 --> 02:39:50,830
It's...

4528
02:39:51,510 --> 02:39:53,930
I'm just the most unlucky person here.

4529
02:39:54,130 --> 02:39:55,270
Like of course.

4530
02:39:55,750 --> 02:39:56,830
Alright here we go.

4531
02:40:01,890 --> 02:40:03,090
I'm just...

4532
02:40:03,090 --> 02:40:04,910
I was just never meant to be lucky.

4533
02:40:05,010 --> 02:40:05,510
I'm just...

4534
02:40:05,510 --> 02:40:06,150
I told you.

4535
02:40:06,610 --> 02:40:07,610
I don't have luck.

4536
02:40:07,830 --> 02:40:09,330
I make my own luck.

4537
02:40:09,990 --> 02:40:11,110
Do hard...

4538
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:11,970
It's just...

4539
02:40:11,970 --> 02:40:13,930
Do hard work and determination.

4540
02:40:15,430 --> 02:40:16,270
I'm just...

4541
02:40:16,270 --> 02:40:17,010
I'm not lucky.

4542
02:40:17,130 --> 02:40:18,870
I just earned my way through life.

4543
02:40:22,170 --> 02:40:23,290
Dute maxing.

4544
02:40:23,390 --> 02:40:24,830
The dute of fate.

4545
02:40:25,910 --> 02:40:26,470
Strength.

4546
02:40:27,330 --> 02:40:29,390
What happens when you strengthen dutes?

4547
02:40:29,410 --> 02:40:30,330
Do you just dute more?

4548
02:40:31,130 --> 02:40:32,150
Is that it?

4549
02:40:32,390 --> 02:40:33,370
No money.

4550
02:40:33,590 --> 02:40:34,750
Just a dute.

4551
02:40:34,930 --> 02:40:35,490
I'm just gonna...

4552
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:36,530
Do I just...

4553
02:40:37,270 --> 02:40:38,650
Do I just dute more?

4554
02:40:38,810 --> 02:40:39,930
Like what the fuck happens?

4555
02:40:43,430 --> 02:40:44,270
It's just...

4556
02:40:44,270 --> 02:40:45,890
It's just louder dutes.

4557
02:40:46,810 --> 02:40:47,710
Alright here we go.

4558
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:48,830
Boop.

4559
02:40:49,570 --> 02:40:50,130
Boop.

4560
02:40:50,930 --> 02:40:51,490
Boop.

4561
02:40:52,970 --> 02:40:55,670
Jesus Christ you're so tanky.

4562
02:40:56,130 --> 02:40:56,690
Alright.

4563
02:40:58,490 --> 02:40:59,190
That's fine.

4564
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:04,190
Now I just know never go down to the corner because it's never a good idea.

4565
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:04,550
Haha.

4566
02:41:05,150 --> 02:41:08,670
I'm getting the hang of knowing what the offices look like now.

4567
02:41:09,370 --> 02:41:10,550
Just dute harder.

4568
02:41:12,330 --> 02:41:13,730
Doki just dute harder.

4569
02:41:14,250 --> 02:41:15,250
It's not that difficult.

4570
02:41:15,490 --> 02:41:16,170
Just keep duting.

4571
02:41:17,130 --> 02:41:18,210
Alright let's see.

4572
02:41:18,430 --> 02:41:19,510
We gotta max out the feather.

4573
02:41:20,230 --> 02:41:20,750
Okay.

4574
02:41:21,570 --> 02:41:22,630
Oh no please.

4575
02:41:23,010 --> 02:41:23,530
Please.

4576
02:41:23,770 --> 02:41:24,290
Please.

4577
02:41:24,310 --> 02:41:24,830
Oh my...

4578
02:41:24,830 --> 02:41:26,030
Oh wait I can just run past that.

4579
02:41:26,630 --> 02:41:27,590
Increase damage.

4580
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:31,350
Well that's good for now because I don't have any...

4581
02:41:31,350 --> 02:41:32,710
Oh my god please.

4582
02:41:33,330 --> 02:41:34,530
I don't have any.

4583
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:35,690
I don't have any anyways so that's good.

4584
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:39,990
Oh my god we're duting even...

4585
02:41:39,990 --> 02:41:40,610
We're doing faster!

4586
02:41:42,390 --> 02:41:43,130
Oh god.

4587
02:41:43,430 --> 02:41:44,490
Is it dute?

4588
02:41:44,650 --> 02:41:45,210
Dute?

4589
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:46,150
Dute?

4590
02:41:46,610 --> 02:41:47,170
Dute?

4591
02:41:47,490 --> 02:41:48,050
Dute?

4592
02:41:48,090 --> 02:41:48,790
Now I know...

4593
02:41:48,790 --> 02:41:50,070
Now I know why.

4594
02:41:50,370 --> 02:41:50,770
Okay.

4595
02:41:50,890 --> 02:41:52,090
Ida's song attack up.

4596
02:41:52,370 --> 02:41:53,790
We get nurse's horn.

4597
02:41:55,390 --> 02:41:57,410
The multiple dutes.

4598
02:41:58,510 --> 02:41:58,830
Haha.

4599
02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:02,910
Or the glasses.

4600
02:42:03,230 --> 02:42:03,870
The glasses?

4601
02:42:04,190 --> 02:42:04,530
The glasses?

4602
02:42:05,850 --> 02:42:06,410
Okay.

4603
02:42:07,950 --> 02:42:08,510
Alright.

4604
02:42:08,650 --> 02:42:10,130
Holy shit it's so fast now.

4605
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:12,010
This is so fast.

4606
02:42:13,050 --> 02:42:13,830
Boop boop.

4607
02:42:14,250 --> 02:42:15,070
Boop boop.

4608
02:42:15,210 --> 02:42:15,850
Boop boop.

4609
02:42:16,270 --> 02:42:17,470
Are you a mini boss?

4610
02:42:17,830 --> 02:42:18,630
I didn't even see it.

4611
02:42:18,810 --> 02:42:19,050
Oh!

4612
02:42:19,390 --> 02:42:20,450
What the fuck?

4613
02:42:20,750 --> 02:42:21,770
What does that do?

4614
02:42:24,210 --> 02:42:26,070
What the fuck does that all do?

4615
02:42:26,950 --> 02:42:28,330
I got mooma scared.

4616
02:42:31,250 --> 02:42:32,290
Alright glasses.

4617
02:42:33,070 --> 02:42:33,630

4618
02:42:33,630 --> 02:42:33,830
Oh!

4619
02:42:34,050 --> 02:42:34,510
Oh!

4620
02:42:34,530 --> 02:42:35,650
Oh and I got a box.

4621
02:42:35,750 --> 02:42:35,950
Nice.

4622
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:39,290
Oh it says screen wipe?

4623
02:42:39,990 --> 02:42:40,990
Deletes everyone.

4624
02:42:41,330 --> 02:42:41,490
Oh!

4625
02:42:42,650 --> 02:42:43,510
This is good.

4626
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:48,430
Magical music notes that float vertically in both directions.

4627
02:42:51,770 --> 02:42:52,570
That good?

4628
02:42:52,770 --> 02:42:53,250
Take?

4629
02:42:53,570 --> 02:42:54,130
Okay.

4631
02:42:55,830 --> 02:42:57,210
I got mooma jump scared.

4632
02:42:57,670 --> 02:42:58,570
What is this?

4633
02:42:59,310 --> 02:43:01,430
Increase damage of weapon I might as well.

4634
02:43:01,570 --> 02:43:01,830
Yeah.

4635
02:43:02,610 --> 02:43:03,190
Oh my god.

4636
02:43:03,930 --> 02:43:05,470
Oh my god it's flying everywhere.

4637
02:43:06,210 --> 02:43:06,770
Alright.

4638
02:43:07,450 --> 02:43:09,150
I have more of her ult now.

4639
02:43:10,030 --> 02:43:10,810
This is...

4640
02:43:10,810 --> 02:43:11,590
I'm so prepared.

4641
02:43:12,890 --> 02:43:13,970
I'm so prepared.

4642
02:43:14,270 --> 02:43:15,270
Get ready for this.

4643
02:43:17,450 --> 02:43:18,010
Boop.

4644
02:43:18,110 --> 02:43:18,870
Boop boop.

4645
02:43:19,130 --> 02:43:19,950
Boop boop.

4646
02:43:20,070 --> 02:43:20,810
Boom boom.

4647
02:43:21,090 --> 02:43:21,710
Boom boom.

4648
02:43:21,870 --> 02:43:22,050
Oh!

4649
02:43:22,230 --> 02:43:22,970
Nice upgrade.

4650
02:43:23,150 --> 02:43:23,510
Free upgrade.

4651
02:43:24,570 --> 02:43:25,130
Uh...

4652
02:43:25,750 --> 02:43:27,850
I guess I'll upgrade idol sign?

4653
02:43:28,770 --> 02:43:31,250
I mean there's nothing else to upgrade right now.

4654
02:43:32,550 --> 02:43:33,110
Uh...

4655
02:43:34,250 --> 02:43:35,370
Let's see...

4656
02:43:35,370 --> 02:43:36,410
Glasses?

4657
02:43:36,710 --> 02:43:40,290
Oh yeah I should upgrade glasses because it's like drawing XP right?

4658
02:43:43,570 --> 02:43:44,430
Boop boop.

4659
02:43:46,670 --> 02:43:47,570
Boop boop.

4660
02:43:47,630 --> 02:43:48,250
Photo.

4661
02:43:48,530 --> 02:43:48,930
God.

4662
02:43:49,050 --> 02:43:50,430
This is my brain right now.

4663
02:43:54,050 --> 02:43:59,350
I can't commentate because all I could think about is like boop boop.

4664
02:44:01,370 --> 02:44:04,090
This is my brain on Holocure.

4665
02:44:05,050 --> 02:44:06,030
Passivist stamp.

4666
02:44:09,930 --> 02:44:11,450
I'm gonna swap this.

4667
02:44:11,850 --> 02:44:14,470
And then... intense focus.

4668
02:44:14,470 --> 02:44:18,090
When you stop using the trumpet, you'll miss it.

4669
02:44:18,490 --> 02:44:19,830
Okay, fine!

4670
02:44:21,190 --> 02:44:22,810
Weapon will do it harder!

4671
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:23,530
Okay, fine.

4672
02:44:24,310 --> 02:44:25,010
Fine.

4673
02:44:25,190 --> 02:44:26,470
Is that what you wanted?

4674
02:44:26,470 --> 02:44:28,650
I'm giving you guys what you want.

4675
02:44:28,830 --> 02:44:30,390
The boosted dudes.

4676
02:44:33,010 --> 02:44:35,990
Oh my god, it's duding so fucking hard right now.

4677
02:44:40,330 --> 02:44:40,930
Okay.

4678
02:44:43,310 --> 02:44:44,410
Do we upgrade?

4679
02:44:46,390 --> 02:44:49,170
The poor sound gap boosted dudes.

4680
02:44:50,430 --> 02:44:51,390
One or two?

4681
02:44:52,090 --> 02:44:54,010
I see more...

4682
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:55,270
tools.

4683
02:44:55,490 --> 02:44:56,330
I'm gonna do two.

4684
02:44:56,470 --> 02:44:58,150
I see more twos than ones.

4685
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:02,830
You know what's crazy?

4686
02:45:03,050 --> 02:45:05,110
This game is like not even...

4687
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:06,590
This game is not even like...

4688
02:45:06,590 --> 02:45:09,030
The file size is not even that big.

4689
02:45:09,270 --> 02:45:10,250
That's actually...

4690
02:45:11,590 --> 02:45:12,710
Really... like...

4691
02:45:12,710 --> 02:45:13,710
What's the word?

4692
02:45:14,410 --> 02:45:15,570
Also, strings!

4693
02:45:15,730 --> 02:45:16,850
Thank you for the akasupa!

4694
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:17,310
Thank you!

4695
02:45:21,190 --> 02:45:23,650
Especially when AAA gaming...

4696
02:45:23,650 --> 02:45:25,350
don't know how to fucking...

4697
02:45:28,110 --> 02:45:29,730
Don't know how to like fucking...

4698
02:45:29,730 --> 02:45:31,390
stabilize game sizes.

4699
02:45:31,790 --> 02:45:33,930
Yeah, it's like so well optimized.

4700
02:45:34,510 --> 02:45:40,330
Like, a lot of AAA devs do not know how to fucking optimize games these days.

4701
02:45:40,550 --> 02:45:42,790
And the fact that this game is the...

4702
02:45:42,790 --> 02:45:45,990
I don't remember what the file size was, but I remember when I was like downloading it.

4703
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:48,050
I was like, holy shit!

4704
02:45:49,730 --> 02:45:54,370
And like how small the game is compared to like...

4705
02:45:54,370 --> 02:45:55,210
Because I know there's like...

4706
02:45:55,210 --> 02:45:57,850
Lots of content too in Holocure.

4707
02:46:01,130 --> 02:46:02,170
Okay, let's see.

4708
02:46:02,290 --> 02:46:03,390
I guess I'll get...

4709
02:46:03,390 --> 02:46:04,310
Glasses.

4710
02:46:08,150 --> 02:46:08,670
Nice.

4711
02:46:08,790 --> 02:46:10,330
And we got the music notes too.

4712
02:46:12,450 --> 02:46:15,230
Just get a way big heart right here.

4713
02:46:16,410 --> 02:46:16,930
Yeah.

4714
02:46:17,050 --> 02:46:19,210
You can tell Akia is a fucking gamer.

4715
02:46:20,430 --> 02:46:20,950
Like...

4716
02:46:20,950 --> 02:46:23,130
Because I still can't believe...

4717
02:46:23,130 --> 02:46:25,190
I still can't believe that Star Wars...

4718
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:27,590
Classic Battlefront is like...

4719
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:29,490
How many gigabytes was that?

4720
02:46:29,610 --> 02:46:30,790
80 plus gigabytes?

4721
02:46:31,350 --> 02:46:32,550
Or was it less than that?

4722
02:46:32,590 --> 02:46:33,010
Like 75?

4723
02:46:35,070 --> 02:46:36,050
75 gigabytes?

4724
02:46:36,570 --> 02:46:37,170
No, Friend?

4725
02:46:37,370 --> 02:46:38,030
Oh, there's Friend.

4726
02:46:38,110 --> 02:46:40,630
So I'm gonna Friend that uses Bedfeather at...

4727
02:46:40,630 --> 02:46:41,270
Okay.

4728
02:46:41,450 --> 02:46:42,070
I'll get Friend.

4729
02:46:42,350 --> 02:46:43,230
Friend, it's time.

4730
02:46:43,710 --> 02:46:44,950
It's time to help me.

4731
02:46:45,890 --> 02:46:47,830
Yeah, over 70 gigabytes.

4732
02:46:47,850 --> 02:46:50,630
Which is fucking insane for like...

4733
02:46:50,630 --> 02:46:52,490
A game that's supposed to be classic.

4734
02:46:52,990 --> 02:46:53,750
And like...

4735
02:46:53,750 --> 02:46:55,170
Apparently the reason why...

4736
02:46:55,170 --> 02:46:56,930
Oh god, please don't hurt me.

4737
02:46:56,950 --> 02:46:57,690
Please don't touch me.

4738
02:46:57,730 --> 02:46:59,310
I don't like social interactions.

4739
02:47:04,370 --> 02:47:07,710
The reason why is that they forgot to like...

4740
02:47:07,710 --> 02:47:10,730
Resize the textures in the game.

4741
02:47:11,010 --> 02:47:12,990
How do you forget to resize the textures?

4742
02:47:13,670 --> 02:47:15,470
It wasn't even for a holiday.

4743
02:47:15,890 --> 02:47:17,110
I don't understand.

4744
02:47:21,470 --> 02:47:22,630
Okay, let's see.

4745
02:47:24,570 --> 02:47:25,310
What do we get?

4746
02:47:25,390 --> 02:47:25,730
Civilization.

4747
02:47:25,750 --> 02:47:27,070
I guess we could do Civilization.

4748
02:47:27,070 --> 02:47:28,010
Let's max that up.

4749
02:47:28,610 --> 02:47:29,550
Is there another arrow?

4750
02:47:29,750 --> 02:47:30,450
Let's look to my left.

4751
02:47:31,930 --> 02:47:32,350
Like...

4752
02:47:32,350 --> 02:47:36,550
I don't understand if they want to have the game out in time for Christmas or something.

4753
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:37,570
Or for...

4754
02:47:37,570 --> 02:47:38,450
Oh my god, Lifesteal!

4755
02:47:41,050 --> 02:47:42,350
Guys, I don't know guys.

4756
02:47:46,210 --> 02:47:47,530
I don't know guys.

4757
02:47:47,530 --> 02:47:50,190
Guys, what is happening to you guys?

4758
02:47:50,190 --> 02:47:52,530
I must be busy right now.

4759
02:47:52,530 --> 02:47:53,010
This castle.

4760
02:47:53,090 --> 02:47:53,450
You more cold switches.

4761
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:57,530
You must be cold switches.

4762
02:47:59,470 --> 02:47:59,510
Oh, oh my god.

4763
02:47:59,510 --> 02:48:03,690
Oh, I mean cold switches?

4764
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:04,390
I thought I know ya.

4765
02:48:04,390 --> 02:48:05,090
Sorry, guys.

4766
02:48:08,650 --> 02:48:11,210
I cheering by myself, So cool.

4767
02:48:11,490 --> 02:48:13,470
I started sweating.

4768
02:48:16,590 --> 02:48:18,530
Oh my god.

4769
02:48:18,950 --> 02:48:19,690
Oh my god.

4770
02:48:21,430 --> 02:48:23,950
Always upgrade, dude.

4771
02:48:27,830 --> 02:48:30,950
It will be harmful if this dude is any louder.

4772
02:48:38,050 --> 02:48:40,850
The dude, it must go on.

4773
02:48:40,850 --> 02:48:42,310
Alright, let's see.

4774
02:48:42,350 --> 02:48:43,770
Oh my god, super chat time!

4775
02:48:50,170 --> 02:48:52,350
Dudes and super chat time!

4776
02:48:55,090 --> 02:48:56,530
Just do it.

4777
02:48:56,950 --> 02:48:58,750
I guess like no, three or four.

4778
02:48:59,190 --> 02:49:03,710
Okay, guys.

4779
02:49:04,050 --> 02:49:04,790
Put the money.

4780
02:49:04,890 --> 02:49:06,230
Think about the money though.

4781
02:49:06,570 --> 02:49:07,670
Put the money.

4782
02:49:08,050 --> 02:49:09,470
Think about the money.

4783
02:49:11,150 --> 02:49:11,870
No, no.

4784
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:13,230
This is level one super chat.

4785
02:49:13,290 --> 02:49:15,710
Level one super chat actually costs money.

4786
02:49:16,110 --> 02:49:17,590
Guys, guys, we can't.

4787
02:49:17,690 --> 02:49:20,450
Guys, level one super chat is the money super chat.

4788
02:49:22,030 --> 02:49:23,350

Hey guys, thank you for the super chat.

4790
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:25,070
Thank you, thank you.

4791
02:49:25,170 --> 02:49:25,330
No!

4792
02:49:25,690 --> 02:49:27,270
You used your real money!

4793
02:49:29,390 --> 02:49:32,050
You had to wait until we were at level four!

4794
02:49:32,930 --> 02:49:34,270
You had to wait until we were at level four!

4795
02:49:35,450 --> 02:49:37,330
Oh wait, I'm gonna wipe this out.

4796
02:49:37,450 --> 02:49:39,570
So I can take care of him first.

4797
02:49:39,870 --> 02:49:39,890
So I can take care of him first.

4798
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:42,170
Oh god, please.

4799
02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:43,210
Please chill.

4800
02:49:44,650 --> 02:49:46,530
Alright, let's see.

4801
02:49:47,450 --> 02:49:48,010
Uhhh...

4802
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:50,190
Dude, dude, dude.

4803
02:49:50,430 --> 02:49:52,110
Thank you for the super chat.

4804
02:49:52,190 --> 02:49:52,550
Thank you.

4805
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:53,290
Thank you.

4806
02:49:53,310 --> 02:49:54,110
Thank you.

4807
02:49:55,490 --> 02:49:56,050
Two?

4808
02:49:58,610 --> 02:49:59,270
Are you the sign?

4809
02:49:59,650 --> 02:50:00,530
Or one?

4810
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:02,450
I see a lot of...

4811
02:50:02,450 --> 02:50:05,750
I'm gonna do one.

4812
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:07,030
Alright.

4813
02:50:08,490 --> 02:50:09,930
Oh, fuck!

4814
02:50:10,190 --> 02:50:13,370
I can't tell that's a wall!

4815
02:50:16,820 --> 02:50:18,070
My last dude.

4816
02:50:18,820 --> 02:50:20,910
I can't tell that's a wall!

4817
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:28,260
I can't tell!

4818
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:33,000
It's so hard to tell!

4819
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:34,980
I don't understand!

4820
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:37,480
Do I have a dub?

4821
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:39,640
Okay, maybe this time I'll get Fauna.

4822
02:50:40,540 --> 02:50:41,700
Maybe this time.

4823
02:50:41,740 --> 02:50:43,240
Okay, thank you for the super chat!

4824
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:43,620
Okay.

4825
02:50:46,380 --> 02:50:48,580
I got countered!

4826
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:50,200
Alright, look.

4827
02:50:51,220 --> 02:50:51,820
Apparently...

4828
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:52,900
Guys, look.

4829
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:53,860
It's not a crutch.

4830
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:55,260
We're gonna...

4831
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:57,320
Maybe...

4832
02:50:57,320 --> 02:50:59,480
We can do this.

4833
02:51:00,320 --> 02:51:03,440
As long as we don't keep getting two times.

4834
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:06,860
No!

4835
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:08,820
We don't deserve the house!

4836
02:51:09,480 --> 02:51:10,520
We don't deserve the house!

4837
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:11,360
We don't deserve the office!

4838
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:13,700
We don't deserve it!

4839
02:51:14,140 --> 02:51:14,940
No more.

4840
02:51:15,100 --> 02:51:16,700
Guys, it's the dude curse.

4841
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,200
It's the fucking dude curse, okay?

4842
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:23,260
It's cause we kept getting duded on.

4843
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:27,780
Always stay center.

4844
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,680
Yeah, I just realized that like...

4845
02:51:29,680 --> 02:51:32,280
Maybe like... going to the edges?

4846
02:51:32,640 --> 02:51:33,920
It's not a good idea!

4847
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:35,680
Who would've thought?

4848
02:51:38,560 --> 02:51:39,680
The dude curse!

4849
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:40,240
It's real!

4850
02:51:41,380 --> 02:51:42,260
Be careful!

4851
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:45,440
When you pick up the dude, you can never go back.

4852
02:51:47,220 --> 02:51:48,420
The run is over.

4853
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:50,960
The moment you start duding, the run is over.

4854
02:51:51,880 --> 02:51:55,240
It's not a suck cause you don't give up.

4855
02:51:56,820 --> 02:51:57,820
Oh my god.

4856
02:51:57,840 --> 02:51:59,140
No, I'm not at the center.

4857
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:00,940
I'm not at the center!

4858
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:02,940
Okay, it's okay.

4859
02:52:02,980 --> 02:52:03,300
We're fine.

4860
02:52:04,120 --> 02:52:05,240
We're slowly adjusting.

4861
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:06,620
Oh wait, there's a...

4862
02:52:07,400 --> 02:52:09,120
Okay, this is very risky.

4863
02:52:09,720 --> 02:52:10,860
But, oh my god.

4864
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:11,480
Okay, it's fine.

4865
02:52:12,660 --> 02:52:13,400
It's fine.

4866
02:52:13,900 --> 02:52:14,720
It's fine.

4867
02:52:16,320 --> 02:52:18,400
We just gotta keep moving forward.

4868
02:52:18,480 --> 02:52:19,100
This is it.

4869
02:52:20,020 --> 02:52:21,580
Ah, there's no... Okay, what do we get here?

4870
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:24,280
It's the dude curse.

4871
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:27,420
Three?

4872
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:32,560
Okay, we get three.

4873
02:52:33,240 --> 02:52:34,940
We're gonna back out a little bit though.

4874
02:52:34,980 --> 02:52:35,660
We're gonna back out.

4875
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:36,440
Ow.

4876
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:38,200
It's fine.

4877
02:52:38,340 --> 02:52:38,720
We're fine.

4878
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:39,900
Oh, box.

4879
02:52:40,120 --> 02:52:40,700
Another box.

4880
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:41,520
It's just a burger.

4881
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:43,400
We don't need the burger though.

4882
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:45,400
Should be fine without it.

4883
02:52:45,860 --> 02:52:47,020
Uh, feather.

4884
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:49,380
We gotta get all the feathers.

4885
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:52,020
For the ultimate.

4886
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:54,140
We gotta max out the feathers.

4887
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:55,660
I'm figuring out the meta.

4888
02:52:55,920 --> 02:52:56,740
Very slowly.

4889
02:52:57,340 --> 02:52:58,080
It's okay.

4890
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:02,120
The moment we max out the feathers, we can go... We can start gaming for reals.

4891
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:02,640
Ooh, the flower!

4892
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:04,400
What's the flower?

4893
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:05,660
Taxi?

4894
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:06,740
We still have 20% chance to reduce.

4895
02:53:06,980 --> 02:53:07,560
Okay, nice.

4896
02:53:07,700 --> 02:53:08,220
We got that.

4897
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:10,180
We don't need the burger!

4898
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:12,360
We're perfectly healthy!

4899
02:53:13,160 --> 02:53:13,960
Look at this.

4900
02:53:14,060 --> 02:53:15,680
We're perfectly healthy, guys.

4901
02:53:16,120 --> 02:53:18,220
Like I said, Kali was not a crutch.

4902
02:53:20,180 --> 02:53:21,920
We can replicate it!

4903
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:25,060
Alright, nice.

4904
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:26,300
Now we have maxed out.

4905
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:28,040
We will be able to replicate!

4906
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:29,200
I swear to god!

4907
02:53:33,380 --> 02:53:34,300
It's possible.

4908
02:53:35,860 --> 02:53:36,860
Do we take this?

4909
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:37,940
Do we take the plug?

4910
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:42,480
The moment I beat a Sage!

4911
02:53:42,780 --> 02:53:46,220
We might only be able to beat Sages on Kali, but like...

4912
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:54,500
The moment we can beat another Sage with a different talent, that's when you know!

4913
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,760
That's when you know I can game with any fucking character.

4914
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:01,480
Uh...

4915
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:03,340
Let's see.

4916
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:05,600
Do we level up?

4917
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:07,100
Or do we... We should level up.

4918
02:54:07,160 --> 02:54:07,760
I'm gonna level up.

4919
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:08,160
Actually.

4920
02:54:10,040 --> 02:54:10,900
I'm gonna level up.

4921
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:12,180
I feel like that's good to do.

4922
02:54:14,460 --> 02:54:14,860
Alright.

4923
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:16,000
Let's see.

4924
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:16,820
What do we take, guys?

4925
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:17,980
1, 2, 3, 4.

4926
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:20,340
Which one?

4927
02:54:28,630 --> 02:54:29,030
One?

4928
02:54:29,230 --> 02:54:29,570
Alright.

4929
02:54:30,150 --> 02:54:30,550
One.

4930
02:54:31,490 --> 02:54:32,010
It's okay.

4931
02:54:32,110 --> 02:54:32,730
We're gonna do this.

4932
02:54:32,810 --> 02:54:33,650
We're gonna beat...

4933
02:54:33,650 --> 02:54:35,330
We're gonna Touhou this shit.

4934
02:54:36,550 --> 02:54:36,950
Touhou?

4935
02:54:37,010 --> 02:54:37,450
I swear.

4936
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:38,910
Touhou has to be... I'm...

4937
02:54:39,490 --> 02:54:43,350
Apparently someone said I can get an achievement if I stand here for 10 seconds.

4938
02:54:43,650 --> 02:54:45,710
Am I not in front of this for 10 seconds?

4939
02:54:48,830 --> 02:54:49,310
Yay!

4940
02:54:49,730 --> 02:54:52,110
That was definitely longer than 10 seconds.

4941
02:54:52,250 --> 02:54:52,810
I don't care.

4942
02:54:52,990 --> 02:54:56,390
I don't need this, but like... I just need one win in my life.

4943
02:55:00,370 --> 02:55:02,250
I need one win.

4944
02:55:05,450 --> 02:55:05,930
Alright.

4945
02:55:06,970 --> 02:55:07,690
Let's see.

4946
02:55:08,630 --> 02:55:11,430
Sage seconds are longer than real seconds.

4947
02:55:12,110 --> 02:55:13,190
Alright, we'll grab one.

4948
02:55:13,890 --> 02:55:16,470
I swear if I get one, guys, we'll grab... God damn it!

4949
02:55:16,470 --> 02:55:17,470
The fucking pot!

4950
02:55:18,330 --> 02:55:19,130
Alright, here we go.

4951
02:55:19,930 --> 02:55:20,350
Nice.

4952
02:55:23,050 --> 02:55:23,650
Oh, wait.

4953
02:55:24,250 --> 02:55:24,990
Get over here.

4954
02:55:25,090 --> 02:55:25,630
Give me your money.

4955
02:55:29,090 --> 02:55:30,390
I'll create the pug.

4956
02:55:30,810 --> 02:55:33,370
Cause I won't get a weapon closer for a collab.

4957
02:55:36,030 --> 02:55:37,310
I think I have...

4958
02:55:37,310 --> 02:55:38,270
Yeah, 3.

4959
02:55:38,490 --> 02:55:39,110
I might as well.

4960
02:55:40,450 --> 02:55:41,790
No, we do not.

4961
02:55:41,810 --> 02:55:43,270
We do not want...

4962
02:55:44,390 --> 02:55:46,930
We do not want a lollipop.

4963
02:55:47,410 --> 02:55:47,750
Alright.

4964
02:55:47,930 --> 02:55:48,810
1, 2, 3, 4.

4965
02:55:48,910 --> 02:55:49,690
Which one do we get?

4966
02:55:51,350 --> 02:55:52,430
Which one, chat?

4967
02:55:56,520 --> 02:55:57,080
One?

4968
02:55:57,260 --> 02:55:57,640
Okay.

4969
02:55:57,880 --> 02:55:59,680
I guess we can replace...

4970
02:55:59,680 --> 02:55:59,820
Wait.

4971
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:01,240
I'll replace...

4972
02:56:01,240 --> 02:56:02,580
I'll replace this.

4973
02:56:03,280 --> 02:56:05,360
And then... What do we strengthen?

4974
02:56:06,120 --> 02:56:06,680
Here.

4975
02:56:10,580 --> 02:56:12,080
Do we strengthen the flower?

4976
02:56:12,640 --> 02:56:13,200
Or...

4977
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:14,600
The... What?

4978
02:56:14,780 --> 02:56:15,580
The pallet?

4979
02:56:16,960 --> 02:56:17,480
Greed?

4980
02:56:18,620 --> 02:56:20,880
Okay, we'll strengthen...

4981
02:56:22,540 --> 02:56:23,680
We'll strengthen greed.

4982
02:56:24,180 --> 02:56:25,020
Might as well.

4983
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:25,660
Yeah.

4984
02:56:26,980 --> 02:56:27,760
Oh my god.

4985
02:56:27,820 --> 02:56:28,880
Guys, 3 minutes.

4986
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:32,740
We're at the... But like, I swear toho, I just don't know.

4987
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:34,860
There's just too... I think like...

4988
02:56:34,860 --> 02:56:37,060
I just get like way too...

4989
02:56:37,060 --> 02:56:41,660
When there's just too many things on my screen, I just can't... I like panic so fucking hard.

4990
02:56:43,260 --> 02:56:44,340
There's just too many balls.

4991
02:56:46,020 --> 02:56:49,240
Don't you just hate it when there's just too many balls on the screen?

4992
02:56:49,860 --> 02:56:50,520
Like, come on.

4993
02:56:50,620 --> 02:56:51,240
Anybody...

4994
02:56:51,240 --> 02:56:53,740
Anybody... Anybody would freak out!

4995
02:56:57,060 --> 02:56:57,680
Alright.

4996
02:56:58,080 --> 02:56:58,360
Alright.

4997
02:57:01,320 --> 02:57:01,940
Understandable.

4998
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:05,360
Me everyday.

4999
02:57:09,540 --> 02:57:10,160
Okay.

5000
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:11,180
Grab this.

5001
02:57:12,100 --> 02:57:12,720
Okay.

5002
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:13,180
Who's coming?

5003
02:57:13,260 --> 02:57:13,420
I'm coming over.

5004
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:14,320
Woah.

5005
02:57:14,680 --> 02:57:15,240
Woah.

5006
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:16,320
Nice.

5007
02:57:17,220 --> 02:57:18,280
Oh my god.

5008
02:57:18,300 --> 02:57:19,940
There's too many things around now.

5009
02:57:21,440 --> 02:57:22,000
Alright.

5010
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:24,900
We're making good progress this time.

5011
02:57:25,820 --> 02:57:28,620
I think it's also because I'm not getting distracted by the dudes.

5012
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:34,440
The dudes aren't hurting me.

5013
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:36,320
Uhhh...

5014
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:37,840
Do you actually read chat?

5015
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:38,940
No, I do not.

5016
02:57:39,200 --> 02:57:40,840
This is all pre-recorded.

5017
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:44,400
My...

5018
02:57:44,400 --> 02:57:52,620
My psyc... If you guys don't know, I have a psychic and they tell me what you're gonna say like one week in advance.

5019
02:57:53,220 --> 02:57:53,940
So...

5020
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:57,660
So this stream was pre-recorded.

5021
02:57:58,340 --> 02:58:04,440
This stream was pre-recorded like last week.

5022
02:58:05,360 --> 02:58:08,540
Because like everything is staged.

5023
02:58:08,740 --> 02:58:10,620
It's just like reality TV.

5024
02:58:10,840 --> 02:58:12,720
I knew it.

5025
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:17,400
That's right.

5026
02:58:17,700 --> 02:58:18,780
You're Oshii.

5027
02:58:19,140 --> 02:58:20,840
Every VTuber...

5028
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:21,900
Do not quote me on this.

5029
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:23,640
But...

5030
02:58:24,540 --> 02:58:28,140
Every... Yes, I also use ChatGPT.

5031
02:58:28,340 --> 02:58:31,900
And I would be like, ChatGPT, I'm going to stream...

5032
02:58:32,820 --> 02:58:35,740
I'm going to publish my Holocure...

5033
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:39,540
My Holocure VOD.

5034
02:58:40,840 --> 02:58:40,940
Next week.

5035
02:58:41,380 --> 02:58:41,900
What...

5036
02:58:41,900 --> 02:58:44,900
What will I have to prepare for for my chat?

5037
02:58:45,560 --> 02:58:48,500
50% stint... Do I take this or nah?

5038
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:50,560
Do I... Do I...

5039
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:52,340
The psychic don't...

5040
02:58:52,340 --> 02:58:54,180
Exactly, Geo!

5041
02:58:54,320 --> 02:58:55,860
Thank you for the super chat!

5042
02:58:55,980 --> 02:58:56,900
Thank you, thank you!

5043
02:58:58,160 --> 02:58:58,680
Take?

5044
02:58:58,820 --> 02:58:59,000
Okay.

5045
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:02,400
And then my mod is gonna be like disclaimer.

5046
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:05,180
This is a bit... This is not a bit.

5047
02:59:05,380 --> 02:59:08,160
This whole entire stream has been...

5048
02:59:08,160 --> 02:59:09,820
I swear to fucking god I'm walking away.

5049
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:18,140
Okay, um...

5050
02:59:18,140 --> 02:59:19,500
We're gonna...

5051
02:59:19,500 --> 02:59:22,240
We're gonna walk over there real fast.

5052
02:59:24,520 --> 02:59:25,080
Okay.

5053
02:59:25,240 --> 02:59:26,980
Wait, what's... Oh, it's just the flying.

5054
02:59:27,400 --> 02:59:28,120
We're fine.

5055
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:29,300
Everything is fine.

5056
02:59:30,500 --> 02:59:33,700
If I keep going right, it's like I don't see it.

5057
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:34,340
What arrow?

5058
02:59:34,920 --> 02:59:37,040
What arrow are you guys talking about?

5059
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:38,380
There's no arrows anywhere.

5060
02:59:39,580 --> 02:59:40,140
What?

5061
02:59:40,600 --> 02:59:43,340
What arrows are you talking about?

5062
02:59:43,360 --> 02:59:47,100
But anyway, as I was saying, it's crazy.

5063
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:48,580
AI is too strong now.

5064
02:59:48,700 --> 02:59:51,260
AI has predicted the future for streaming.

5065
02:59:51,640 --> 02:59:56,000
All I do is just be like, ChatGPT, what is my...

5066
02:59:56,620 --> 03:00:00,540
What is my chat gonna tell me today when I stream Holocure?

5067
03:00:00,620 --> 03:00:02,800
And then they're gonna be like, oh, Doki...

5068
03:00:02,800 --> 03:00:07,720
They're gonna be like, in DokiBird's Holocure stream, there is going to be...

5069
03:00:07,720 --> 03:00:08,300
What do I upgrade?

5070
03:00:08,460 --> 03:00:09,280
I guess I'll upgrade greed.

5071
03:00:09,700 --> 03:00:11,640
There is... Wait, actually, is this even good?

5072
03:00:11,820 --> 03:00:12,900
Increase attack size.

5073
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:14,320
Do we need attack size?

5074
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:20,060
Is that good?

5075
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:24,340
I'm actually in ChatGPT, by the way.

5076
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:29,760
ChatGPT!

5077
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:31,420
Is this good?

5078
03:00:31,700 --> 03:00:36,080
If you see me looking to the right, it's actually the ChatGPT screen.

5079
03:00:36,580 --> 03:00:37,140
Because...

5080
03:00:39,240 --> 03:00:42,800
Because obviously I can't re-chat because it's pre-recorded.

5081
03:00:49,640 --> 03:00:50,260
Okay.

5082
03:00:51,160 --> 03:00:51,780
Okay.

5083
03:00:51,780 --> 03:00:51,800
Okay.

5084
03:00:52,380 --> 03:00:53,940
We are...

5085
03:00:53,940 --> 03:00:56,740
You guys are a ChatGPT.

5086
03:00:57,080 --> 03:00:57,800
Let's see.

5087
03:00:57,860 --> 03:00:58,840
I feel like 2.

5088
03:00:59,220 --> 03:00:59,840
Civilization.

5089
03:01:00,420 --> 03:01:01,040
Nice.

5090
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:02,660
Good job, friend.

5091
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:06,500
Okay, as I was saying...

5092
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:07,640
Uh...

5093
03:01:08,420 --> 03:01:11,680
That actually shows how good of a streamer I am.

5094
03:01:11,980 --> 03:01:13,840
It just feels so real.

5095
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:18,520
Oh my god.

5096
03:01:18,540 --> 03:01:23,080
She's so good at streaming that it doesn't even feel like it's pre-recorded.

5097
03:01:23,100 --> 03:01:23,440
I know!

5098
03:01:23,580 --> 03:01:24,520
It doesn't!

5099
03:01:24,980 --> 03:01:27,320
I'm gonna grab the fork because I need a...

5100
03:01:28,100 --> 03:01:29,000
AI is true.

5101
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:29,560
Oh my god!

5102
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:31,120
Did you guys hear about the dead internet theory?

5103
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:33,400
Like every...

5104
03:01:33,400 --> 03:01:39,220
If you ever look at like popular posts from like big Twitter accounts, there'd be like...

5105
03:01:39,220 --> 03:01:40,100
It's just bots.

5106
03:01:40,100 --> 03:01:41,500
It's cause of like...

5107
03:01:41,500 --> 03:01:43,520
Cause of Elon Musk's fucking...

5108
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:45,200
Like... Oh, like advertising.

5109
03:01:45,440 --> 03:01:47,620
Fucking monetization shit.

5110
03:01:47,840 --> 03:01:50,820
For those who don't know what the dead internet theory is...

5111
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:51,940
Let me open this box first.

5112
03:01:52,880 --> 03:01:53,760
It's just...

5113
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:56,700
The world is becoming more and more infested in bots.

5114
03:01:57,240 --> 03:01:58,600
Like in the internet.

5115
03:01:58,820 --> 03:02:01,000
Yeah, it's just all fucking internet.

5116
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:05,540
They just... They actually use ChatGPT and AI to make Twitter responses.

5117
03:02:05,860 --> 03:02:07,420
It's so fucking weird.

5118
03:02:07,420 --> 03:02:09,140
It's so weird.

5119
03:02:10,340 --> 03:02:11,900
Holy shit.

5120
03:02:12,220 --> 03:02:13,640
It's like Y2K.

5121
03:02:13,820 --> 03:02:15,610
It's like modern day Y2K.

5122
03:02:16,380 --> 03:02:17,160
Um...

5123
03:02:18,160 --> 03:02:19,180
Buddy friend.

5124
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:22,440
You only have three...

5125
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:23,320
Three...

5126
03:02:25,940 --> 03:02:27,790
It's like chat is just...

5127
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:30,340
My entire chat is just...

5128
03:02:30,340 --> 03:02:31,560
It's just AI.

5129
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:35,440
So like...

5130
03:02:35,440 --> 03:02:37,200
If you ever go on like those popular...

5131
03:02:37,420 --> 03:02:38,760
like meme Twitter accounts.

5132
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:40,820
Or not just like news Twitter accounts.

5133
03:02:40,940 --> 03:02:42,340
Or like just like... Wait, what achievement?

5134
03:02:42,460 --> 03:02:44,100
Don't take any damage for five seconds?

5135
03:02:44,400 --> 03:02:45,480
Oh shit, I did it.

5136
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:46,180
I'm fucking gaming.

5137
03:02:47,460 --> 03:02:49,460
Uh... But basically like...

5138
03:02:49,460 --> 03:02:50,900
They actually use like...

5139
03:02:50,900 --> 03:02:51,600
Oh wait, okay.

5140
03:02:51,820 --> 03:02:53,340
Oh my god, but there's super chat time.

5141
03:02:56,860 --> 03:02:59,420
We have become high mod and ChatGPT.

5142
03:03:00,100 --> 03:03:02,460
All our base blood are ChatGPTs.

5143
03:03:02,540 --> 03:03:03,200
Thank you, thank you.

5144
03:03:04,400 --> 03:03:06,540
It's actually so scary though.

5145
03:03:07,420 --> 03:03:08,200
Oh no, like...

5146
03:03:08,200 --> 03:03:11,520
I think they haven't targeted VTubers yet.

5147
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:13,740
Like VTubers are not targeted yet.

5148
03:03:13,820 --> 03:03:14,760
Like viral posts.

5149
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:15,960
But you ever look...

5150
03:03:15,960 --> 03:03:16,060
No!

5151
03:03:16,260 --> 03:03:18,680
My five minute not take damage!

5152
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:22,340
But...

5153
03:03:23,320 --> 03:03:25,060
But you ever look at any...

5154
03:03:25,060 --> 03:03:26,700
Viral post or anything.

5155
03:03:27,160 --> 03:03:29,160
It's mostly just like...

5156
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:29,860
Bot accounts.

5157
03:03:30,300 --> 03:03:33,100
And the reason why they do that is because...

5158
03:03:33,100 --> 03:03:34,640
They can sell Twitter accounts.

5159
03:03:35,120 --> 03:03:36,580
To like for... Oh fuck!

5160
03:03:36,640 --> 03:03:37,040
Upgrade!

5161
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:37,840
Sorry, give me a sec.

5162
03:03:39,340 --> 03:03:41,220
This is... This is important.

5163
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:44,180
Oh shit, nice.

5164
03:03:45,320 --> 03:03:46,500
What do we get here?

5165
03:03:49,180 --> 03:03:50,040
What do we get here?

5166
03:03:50,520 --> 03:03:53,240
I mean, it's not... We're not talking about like link in bio.

5167
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:58,760
It's not the link in bio shit.

5168
03:03:58,920 --> 03:04:00,480
It's like actual like...

5169
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:02,360
Replies to your tweets.

5170
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:05,780
It's like replies to your tweets that feel like...

5171
03:04:05,780 --> 03:04:08,040
Real people type responses to it.

5172
03:04:08,120 --> 03:04:10,560
Cause they're trying to get reactions to it.

5173
03:04:10,640 --> 03:04:10,980
And stuff.

5174
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:11,960
And then...

5175
03:04:15,080 --> 03:04:16,100
Pulling the wall.

5176
03:04:18,140 --> 03:04:19,180
It's not that.

5177
03:04:19,320 --> 03:04:21,060
It's like actual viral tweets.

5178
03:04:21,380 --> 03:04:22,940
That have like...

5179
03:04:22,940 --> 03:04:24,960
That are like there to like...

5180
03:04:24,960 --> 03:04:26,260
Get likes and follows.

5181
03:04:26,900 --> 03:04:27,540
And...

5182
03:04:28,220 --> 03:04:29,460
Even like...

5183
03:04:29,460 --> 03:04:33,440
If we started on YouTube because it's like the MrBeast shit.

5184
03:04:33,960 --> 03:04:35,340
Um... God, what do we want?

5185
03:04:35,380 --> 03:04:35,760
SuperTweets?

5186
03:04:35,780 --> 03:04:36,220
Or ChattoTime?

5187
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:37,320
Or Bloodthirsty?

5188
03:04:39,940 --> 03:04:40,920
What do we want?

5189
03:04:41,140 --> 03:04:43,360
Do we invite you?

5190
03:04:47,580 --> 03:04:48,620
Okay, here we go.

5191
03:04:48,860 --> 03:04:52,140
But like, it's cause like... The reason why they do that...

5192
03:04:52,140 --> 03:04:52,880
Is cause...

5193
03:04:52,880 --> 03:04:54,520
And they're always verified too.

5194
03:04:54,740 --> 03:04:57,780
They're always verified to take advantage of the monetization.

5195
03:04:58,060 --> 03:04:59,520
For Elon Musk shit.

5196
03:04:59,980 --> 03:05:01,140
Cause like they're like...

5197
03:05:01,140 --> 03:05:02,220
Oh, we have like...

5198
03:05:02,220 --> 03:05:03,840
A viral tweet.

5199
03:05:04,160 --> 03:05:05,100
Then like...

5200
03:05:05,780 --> 03:05:06,640
Get out!

5201
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:07,440
Leave!

5202
03:05:08,060 --> 03:05:08,580
Stop!

5203
03:05:08,680 --> 03:05:09,260
Okay, sorry.

5204
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:13,800
So many things are going on right now.

5205
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:18,920
The reason why...

5206
03:05:18,920 --> 03:05:22,220
And also they can sell Twitter accounts for money as well.

5207
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:26,800
Alright, do we get three or four?

5208
03:05:28,400 --> 03:05:29,980
This stream is very interesting.

5209
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:31,960
Thank you for making Super Chat Kid!

5210
03:05:32,060 --> 03:05:32,860
Thank you, thank you!

5211
03:05:32,940 --> 03:05:34,300
Tomato and Pie.

5212
03:05:35,780 --> 03:05:36,080
Two?

5213
03:05:36,120 --> 03:05:36,640
Wait...

5214
03:05:36,640 --> 03:05:37,600
Three or four?

5215
03:05:37,700 --> 03:05:38,180
Three.

5216
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:39,440
Okay.

5217
03:05:39,880 --> 03:05:41,760
And then we can...

5218
03:05:43,080 --> 03:05:44,400
Max level this.

5219
03:05:44,860 --> 03:05:45,680
What is this?

5220
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:46,840
Okay, we might as well.

5221
03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:47,800
Cause we already have book.

5222
03:05:48,500 --> 03:05:52,000
So people can sell Twitter accounts as well.

5223
03:05:52,040 --> 03:05:53,080
Cause the more followers...

5224
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:54,740
You know what's like... What is it?

5225
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:56,160
What was that Twitter account?

5226
03:05:56,300 --> 03:05:58,600
There was this really big popular Twitter account.

5227
03:05:58,840 --> 03:05:59,320
Oh yeah!

5228
03:05:59,400 --> 03:06:01,300
Images before they became popular!

5229
03:06:01,660 --> 03:06:03,400
So there was this really...

5230
03:06:03,400 --> 03:06:04,580
Big Twitter account.

5231
03:06:04,840 --> 03:06:08,620
That was like images before they became viral or some shit.

5232
03:06:08,740 --> 03:06:11,760
And that guy sold his Twitter account for like...

5233
03:06:11,760 --> 03:06:13,520
Ten thousand dollars or something.

5234
03:06:13,920 --> 03:06:15,360
That's fucking crazy!

5235
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:18,500

03:06:20,200 --> 03:06:21,200
They like...

5238
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:23,300
The Twitter account suddenly changed into some...

5239
03:06:23,300 --> 03:06:25,040
NFT shit or something.

5240
03:06:29,760 --> 03:06:30,480

5248
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:42,340

5253
03:06:50,360 --> 03:06:51,780
It was either NFT or crypto.

5254
03:06:52,100 --> 03:06:53,020
And then they were like...

5255
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:57,100

5256
03:06:57,100 --> 03:06:59,220

5263
03:07:11,400 --> 03:07:11,960
It's like...

5264
03:07:11,960 --> 03:07:14,260
People would wanna buy the account.

5265
03:07:15,200 --> 03:07:16,080
Oh hey look.

5266
03:07:16,340 --> 03:07:16,940

03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:17,520
Projectiles.

5268
03:07:17,580 --> 03:07:18,520
Oh wait projectiles Sam!

5269
03:07:18,580 --> 03:07:19,120
That's really good!

5270
03:07:22,500 --> 03:07:24,900
Let's see... What is that?

5271
03:07:27,380 --> 03:07:28,100
Swap what?

5272
03:07:28,340 --> 03:07:28,840
Swap.

5273
03:07:28,980 --> 03:07:29,220
Okay.

5274
03:07:29,280 --> 03:07:30,400
And then we'll swap this.

5275
03:07:30,700 --> 03:07:32,460
And then we'll...

5276
03:07:33,400 --> 03:07:34,280
I guess we'll strengthen one.

5277
03:07:36,640 --> 03:07:37,120
Oh.

5278
03:07:37,160 --> 03:07:37,800
Get out.

5279
03:07:38,620 --> 03:07:40,880
Okay what I'm really worried about is...

5280
03:07:40,880 --> 03:07:41,440
Bomb guy.

5281
03:07:43,360 --> 03:07:45,100
Bomb guy freaks me out.

5282
03:07:46,820 --> 03:07:47,300
Yeah.

5283
03:07:47,440 --> 03:07:49,880
I mean it's the same thing with...

5284
03:07:49,880 --> 03:07:50,680
Uh... Fuck.

5285
03:07:50,960 --> 03:07:52,820
They did that with YouTube accounts too.

5286
03:07:53,020 --> 03:07:55,300
Where they get to a hundred... Is that desk?

5287
03:07:55,520 --> 03:07:55,900
Oh okay.

5288
03:07:56,160 --> 03:07:57,200
I was like what the fuck is that?

5289
03:07:59,200 --> 03:08:01,920
They do that with like YouTube accounts as well.

5290
03:08:01,960 --> 03:08:02,960
They try to get it.

5291
03:08:03,400 --> 03:08:04,460
They try to get it to like a hundred K.

5292
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:07,400
Like back then when the whole...

5293
03:08:07,400 --> 03:08:09,620
There was like a meta...

5294
03:08:09,620 --> 03:08:10,700
Where... Oh my god!

5295
03:08:11,460 --> 03:08:11,980
Big...

5296
03:08:12,740 --> 03:08:13,620
I'm not fast.

5297
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:14,400
I'm not fast.

5298
03:08:14,660 --> 03:08:15,200
I'm fast enough.

5299
03:08:15,280 --> 03:08:15,800
I'm fast enough.

5300
03:08:15,960 --> 03:08:16,900
I'm fast enough.

5301
03:08:17,140 --> 03:08:19,320
Oh no no no no.

5302
03:08:19,340 --> 03:08:20,360
No no no.

5303
03:08:20,940 --> 03:08:21,800
No no.

5304
03:08:22,220 --> 03:08:22,740
No.

5305
03:08:24,160 --> 03:08:25,360
Okay don't worry.

5306
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:26,360
I'm fast enough though.

5307
03:08:26,860 --> 03:08:27,380
Okay.

5308
03:08:27,520 --> 03:08:28,500
I'm just gonna...

5309
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:30,300
I'm just gonna be over here.

5310
03:08:30,460 --> 03:08:31,260
Give me a sec.

5311
03:08:31,260 --> 03:08:32,720
Oh my god!

5312
03:08:32,820 --> 03:08:33,720
What is the rage?

5313
03:08:33,880 --> 03:08:35,680
I need to get into an open space!

5314
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:37,600
This is bad.

5315
03:08:37,720 --> 03:08:38,800
I'm not like in an open...

5316
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:39,460
Oh my god.

5317
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:43,480
Okay.

5318
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:45,440
I don't wanna look at it.

5319
03:08:50,100 --> 03:08:52,400
I don't wanna look at this.

5320
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:56,360
Get me outta here.

5321
03:08:57,520 --> 03:08:58,720
No I don't see.

5322
03:08:58,720 --> 03:09:00,060
I don't perceive.

5323
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:01,600
I don't perceive.

5324
03:09:02,240 --> 03:09:04,740
If I don't look it's like it doesn't exist.

5325
03:09:05,140 --> 03:09:05,840
If I...

5326
03:09:08,160 --> 03:09:11,020
If I don't look it's not there.

5327
03:09:12,460 --> 03:09:14,500
Guys that's how I'm gonna go with life.

5328
03:09:14,660 --> 03:09:15,460
Just don't look.

5329
03:09:16,440 --> 03:09:18,460
If I don't look it doesn't exist.

5330
03:09:19,560 --> 03:09:21,080
I might as well max that out.

5331
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:24,200
Oh three!

5332
03:09:25,020 --> 03:09:26,440
I might as well take all of that.

5333
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:26,880
Yeah.

5334
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:28,440
The cooking and the...

5335
03:09:28,720 --> 03:09:29,020
...bruchetto.

5336
03:09:29,660 --> 03:09:32,300
And then we enhance...

5337
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:36,300
Might as well enhance the...

5338
03:09:36,300 --> 03:09:38,480
We'll enhance the book.

5339
03:09:39,280 --> 03:09:39,940
Let's see.

5340
03:09:40,080 --> 03:09:41,400
You cannot run...

5341
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:42,980
I'm running!

5342
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:44,160
You can't stop me!

5343
03:09:48,700 --> 03:09:50,300
Oh shit collab!

5344
03:09:52,520 --> 03:09:53,160
Nice.

5345
03:09:53,840 --> 03:09:55,460
Got the collab time.

5346
03:09:57,380 --> 03:09:58,020
Nice.

5347
03:09:58,080 --> 03:09:58,300
Alright.

5348
03:09:59,740 --> 03:10:00,940
Back then...

5349
03:10:00,940 --> 03:10:03,580
Back then the meta for YouTube accounts...

5350
03:10:03,580 --> 03:10:06,140
...was to be everywhere with comments.

5351
03:10:06,460 --> 03:10:07,040
So like...

5352
03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:08,720
You'd be like...

5353
03:10:09,640 --> 03:10:10,240
Alright.

5354
03:10:10,520 --> 03:10:11,480
Do we strengthen this?

5355
03:10:11,680 --> 03:10:12,560
Or do we swap this?

5356
03:10:13,020 --> 03:10:14,560
We can max out the...

5357
03:10:14,560 --> 03:10:15,620
The...

5358
03:10:15,620 --> 03:10:16,840
The weaken stamp.

5359
03:10:23,700 --> 03:10:25,000
Get gorilla paw?

5360
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:26,200
Okay get gorilla paw.

5361
03:10:26,340 --> 03:10:26,800
Swap?

5362
03:10:26,860 --> 03:10:27,360
Swap two.

5363
03:10:27,580 --> 03:10:27,880
Okay.

5364
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:28,520
Swap two.

5365
03:10:28,860 --> 03:10:29,460
Alright.

5366
03:10:30,040 --> 03:10:31,180
And we'll strengthen.

5367
03:10:32,180 --> 03:10:32,720
Confirm.

5368
03:10:33,020 --> 03:10:35,520
But yeah back... You know like back in old YouTube...

5369
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:36,860
The meta was to like...

5370
03:10:37,450 --> 03:10:39,020
Have... Just... Oh shit.

5371
03:10:39,180 --> 03:10:39,720
Oh my god.

5372
03:10:42,440 --> 03:10:42,980
Okay.

5373
03:10:43,220 --> 03:10:44,000
Here we go.

5374
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:46,220
We're gonna max out book.

5375
03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:49,400
Just to have like... Just to be everywhere...

5376
03:10:49,400 --> 03:10:50,320
...with YouTube comments.

5377
03:10:50,340 --> 03:10:51,600
So every YouTube...

5378
03:10:51,600 --> 03:10:53,660
...viral... Viral YouTube video...

5379
03:10:53,660 --> 03:10:55,400
You'll see like the same...

5380
03:10:55,400 --> 03:10:57,480
...five people commenting...

5381
03:10:57,480 --> 03:10:58,380
...on YouTube.

5382
03:10:58,600 --> 03:10:59,440
And then they'll say...

5383
03:10:59,460 --> 03:11:00,420
...sell their accounts afterwards.

5384
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:05,400
Cause it's like so... That's like easy...

5385
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:06,020
...subscribers.

5386
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:09,140
It was just so easy to get subscribers.

5387
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:10,980
And then they'll sell the YouTube account.

5388
03:11:11,260 --> 03:11:12,060
And then...

5389
03:11:12,860 --> 03:11:15,280
And then it's like free YouTube play button.

5390
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:17,120
Like free like...

5391
03:11:17,120 --> 03:11:19,180
...head start and stuff for those who are like...

5392
03:11:19,180 --> 03:11:20,220
...they'll sell it to like...

5393
03:11:20,220 --> 03:11:23,520
...some fucking content creator that wants like...

5394
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:25,180
...more subscribers or something.

5395
03:11:25,420 --> 03:11:27,280
And then like... And then at one point...

5396
03:11:27,280 --> 03:11:29,140
...they were like... They started hacking other...

5397
03:11:29,460 --> 03:11:30,420
...channels too.

5398
03:11:30,760 --> 03:11:31,520
They were like...

5399
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:33,100
...hacking YouTube channels.

5400
03:11:33,280 --> 03:11:35,600
So they can sell the YouTube channels...

5401
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:36,960
...and stuff for money.

5402
03:11:37,180 --> 03:11:38,400
It's fucking crazy.

5403
03:11:39,460 --> 03:11:40,160
Let's see.

5404
03:11:40,460 --> 03:11:41,460
Do we want... We don't want...

5405
03:11:41,460 --> 03:11:41,800
...this right?

5406
03:11:48,630 --> 03:11:50,030
Do we want this or nah?

5407
03:11:50,270 --> 03:11:51,490
Do we strengthen it?

5408
03:11:55,070 --> 03:11:55,750
Upgrade too.

5409
03:11:55,890 --> 03:11:56,150
Okay.

5410
03:11:59,130 --> 03:11:59,930
It's crazy.

5411
03:12:00,170 --> 03:12:02,210
The things people will do for money...

5412
03:12:02,210 --> 03:12:03,690
...is actually insane.

5413
03:12:06,510 --> 03:12:08,130
But yeah, this is why...

5414
03:12:08,630 --> 03:12:10,250
...this is why like...

5415
03:12:10,250 --> 03:12:10,570
...

5416
03:12:11,350 --> 03:12:13,010
No, we're backing the trumpet.

5417
03:12:13,210 --> 03:12:15,150
Why do I keep coming back to you?

5418
03:12:15,270 --> 03:12:16,790
We get the gorilla paw, right guys?

5419
03:12:18,250 --> 03:12:19,930
Now they just hacked in the show...

5420
03:12:19,930 --> 03:12:20,670
...NFT scams.

5421
03:12:20,730 --> 03:12:22,110
Yeah, or crypto scams.

5422
03:12:22,590 --> 03:12:24,110
We get the monkey paw, right?

5423
03:12:24,170 --> 03:12:24,770
The gorilla paw?

5424
03:12:27,310 --> 03:12:27,790
Two.

5425
03:12:27,890 --> 03:12:28,190
Okay.

5426
03:12:28,570 --> 03:12:29,510
We'll grab two.

5427
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:31,770
And then we'll have a super collab.

5428
03:12:32,850 --> 03:12:33,610
Oh god.

5429
03:12:33,670 --> 03:12:34,590
I cannot see anything.

5430
03:12:34,850 --> 03:12:35,670
I cannot.

5431
03:12:37,290 --> 03:12:39,450
We're at the stage where I can't see anything.

5432
03:12:39,650 --> 03:12:41,750
I always come back to that trumpet.

5433
03:12:41,830 --> 03:12:43,290
Why can I never quit you?

5434
03:12:43,510 --> 03:12:45,330
Why can I never quit you?

5435
03:12:46,190 --> 03:12:47,970
AHHHHH Okay.

5436
03:12:49,090 --> 03:12:50,350
Oh, here we go.

5437
03:12:50,710 --> 03:12:51,390
It's fine.

5438
03:12:51,550 --> 03:12:52,190
Everything is fine.

5439
03:12:52,250 --> 03:12:52,810
We're at the center.

5440
03:12:54,790 --> 03:12:55,770
We're at the center.

5441
03:12:55,870 --> 03:12:56,390
We're all okay.

5442
03:12:56,730 --> 03:12:58,050
We'll get the spider cookie.

5443
03:12:59,690 --> 03:13:01,190
To sell the trumpet.

5444
03:13:01,450 --> 03:13:03,430
No, it's here to punish you all.

5445
03:13:03,630 --> 03:13:04,430
So you...

5446
03:13:06,570 --> 03:13:09,090
So you know wherever I go...

5447
03:13:09,090 --> 03:13:11,870
...you will know where that green arrow is.

5448
03:13:15,090 --> 03:13:17,730
Everywhere I go, you will know...

5449
03:13:17,730 --> 03:13:19,750
...what this green arrow is.

5450
03:13:22,590 --> 03:13:25,330
Just to tempt all of you guys forever.

5451
03:13:26,370 --> 03:13:27,990
It'll always be there.

5452
03:13:29,510 --> 03:13:30,070
I'm tempting you.

5453
03:13:31,290 --> 03:13:32,890
Telling you to be like...

5454
03:13:32,890 --> 03:13:33,670
I'm here.

5455
03:13:35,290 --> 03:13:36,010
I'm here.

5456
03:13:40,490 --> 03:13:41,970
I'm right here.

5457
03:13:42,590 --> 03:13:42,810
I'm right here.

5458
03:13:42,810 --> 03:13:42,990
I'm right here.

5459
03:13:42,990 --> 03:13:43,230
The dude.

5460
03:13:46,630 --> 03:13:48,290
Get ready for the dudes.

5461
03:13:48,650 --> 03:13:48,830
Get ready for the dudes.

5462
03:13:49,170 --> 03:13:50,310
Alright, let's see.

5463
03:13:50,910 --> 03:13:51,750
What did I get here?

5464
03:13:51,770 --> 03:13:53,010
Do I just max out Gorilla Paul?

5465
03:13:53,650 --> 03:13:54,110
Awesome.

5466
03:13:54,130 --> 03:13:54,530
Logical.

5467
03:13:54,550 --> 03:13:55,310
Thank you for the super chat.

5468
03:13:55,310 --> 03:13:55,650
Thank you.

5469
03:13:55,670 --> 03:13:56,170
Thank you.

5470
03:13:56,190 --> 03:13:58,210
Watching you play inspired me to get the game.

5471
03:13:58,310 --> 03:14:00,770
I beat the first stage with Ami and just beat the second with Gurra.

5472
03:14:00,850 --> 03:14:01,710
Thank you for the super chat.

5473
03:14:01,790 --> 03:14:02,070
Thank you.

5474
03:14:02,130 --> 03:14:02,670
Thank you.

5475
03:14:02,730 --> 03:14:03,310
For, right?

5476
03:14:03,950 --> 03:14:05,430
We maxed the Paul for the...

5477
03:14:05,430 --> 03:14:07,150
Okay, maxed the Paul for the super collab.

5478
03:14:07,730 --> 03:14:08,810
Alright, that's fine.

5479
03:14:09,470 --> 03:14:10,370
That's good to know.

5480
03:14:12,810 --> 03:14:13,670
Alright, here we go.

5481
03:14:15,790 --> 03:14:16,450
Oh yeah!

5482
03:14:16,510 --> 03:14:18,330
I was trying to fucking do a Zatsu about...

5483
03:14:18,330 --> 03:14:19,610
...all of this.

5484
03:14:22,310 --> 03:14:23,390
I almost forgot.

5485
03:14:24,090 --> 03:14:25,790
There's just so many things happening on my screen.

5486
03:14:26,710 --> 03:14:27,610
But, oh my...

5487
03:14:27,610 --> 03:14:28,130
Okay, wait.

5488
03:14:28,210 --> 03:14:29,050
Let me think real fast.

5489
03:14:29,310 --> 03:14:29,550
Okay.

5490
03:14:29,690 --> 03:14:30,970
Oh yeah, it's actually...

5491
03:14:30,970 --> 03:14:33,050
Like, I don't know if they did like...

5492
03:14:33,490 --> 03:14:34,690
...personal... Oh fuck, wait.

5493
03:14:34,790 --> 03:14:35,470
Give me a sec guys.

5494
03:14:35,530 --> 03:14:36,010
There's two...

5495
03:14:37,350 --> 03:14:42,310
I'll never be able to talk about Holofest because there's always things happening.

5496
03:14:43,150 --> 03:14:44,230
Okay, what do we want?

5497
03:14:44,630 --> 03:14:45,650
One, two, three, four.

5498
03:14:51,190 --> 03:14:51,590
Four?

5499
03:14:51,830 --> 03:14:52,610
Throw an axe?

5500
03:14:53,030 --> 03:14:53,630
Or two?

5501
03:14:54,250 --> 03:14:54,650
Four?

5502
03:14:54,770 --> 03:14:55,650
Okay, we'll get four.

5503
03:14:56,870 --> 03:14:57,230
Why is this open?

5504
03:14:58,090 --> 03:14:59,890
Alright, that's good.

5505
03:14:59,950 --> 03:15:01,050
We just got the axe too.

5506
03:15:01,470 --> 03:15:02,190
What is this?

5507
03:15:02,470 --> 03:15:07,230
Reduce special cooldown by 45% allows a special...

5508
03:15:07,230 --> 03:15:08,190
Do we get this?

5509
03:15:08,290 --> 03:15:08,930
Or nah?

5510
03:15:11,230 --> 03:15:12,190
Take or nah?

5511
03:15:12,790 --> 03:15:14,510
Is this a... take?

5512
03:15:15,470 --> 03:15:16,150
Oh, okay.

5513
03:15:16,210 --> 03:15:17,150
This is super rare.

5514
03:15:17,710 --> 03:15:18,570
Oh my god.

5515
03:15:18,570 --> 03:15:19,250
Is my luck changing?

5516
03:15:19,510 --> 03:15:20,190
This is it!

5517
03:15:20,530 --> 03:15:22,150
My luck is turning around!

5518
03:15:23,130 --> 03:15:24,430
This is it, Mumei!

5519
03:15:25,310 --> 03:15:26,490
We're doing it!

5520
03:15:29,050 --> 03:15:31,690
My luck is finally turning around!

5521
03:15:32,390 --> 03:15:32,630
My luck is finally turning around!

5522
03:15:32,630 --> 03:15:33,130
My luck is finally turning around!

5523
03:15:33,130 --> 03:15:33,850
It's here!

5524
03:15:36,810 --> 03:15:38,110
Holy shit.

5525
03:15:38,370 --> 03:15:38,450
Holy shit.

5526
03:15:38,450 --> 03:15:40,230
It's actually here.

5527
03:15:41,510 --> 03:15:43,110
Oh my god.

5528
03:15:44,470 --> 03:15:45,170
Oh my god.

5529
03:15:45,170 --> 03:15:45,510
Alright, here we go.

5530
03:15:45,650 --> 03:15:46,670
But no, I'm like...

5531
03:15:46,670 --> 03:15:48,370
Oh my god.

5532
03:15:48,430 --> 03:15:48,710
Fuck!

5533
03:15:48,950 --> 03:15:49,410
Please!

5534
03:15:50,730 --> 03:15:51,990
I'll never...

5535
03:15:51,990 --> 03:15:54,990
I'll never be able to talk about Holofest.

5536
03:15:55,150 --> 03:15:55,850
I'll never be able to talk about Holofest.

5537
03:15:56,950 --> 03:15:58,050
Alright, Gorilla Pop.

5538
03:15:58,730 --> 03:16:01,250
Everything is just too many things on my screen.

5539
03:16:01,830 --> 03:16:03,170
We're too close.

5540
03:16:03,370 --> 03:16:04,890
We're too close.

5541
03:16:05,310 --> 03:16:08,550
I like how you were like, Just all so we can hear the tangents!

5542
03:16:09,230 --> 03:16:09,790
Doki!

5543
03:16:09,930 --> 03:16:11,210
Just fucking all!

5544
03:16:11,890 --> 03:16:12,890
Just fucking all!

5545
03:16:14,010 --> 03:16:17,350
We wanna know about what you think about Holofest!

5546
03:16:17,710 --> 03:16:17,930
We wanna know about what you think about Holofest!

5547
03:16:17,930 --> 03:16:18,530
Just all!

5548
03:16:20,510 --> 03:16:21,070
No.

5549
03:16:21,790 --> 03:16:22,350
No.

5550
03:16:22,470 --> 03:16:23,550
I want the money.

5551
03:16:24,350 --> 03:16:26,090
I want the money too.

5552
03:16:26,310 --> 03:16:26,610
Fine.

5553
03:16:27,930 --> 03:16:29,670
But it doesn't give me the money!

5554
03:16:32,050 --> 03:16:32,870
But it just...

5555
03:16:32,870 --> 03:16:35,770
It's like that screen wipe thing!

5556
03:16:36,350 --> 03:16:37,450

5557
03:16:37,450 --> 03:16:38,650

5558
03:16:40,930 --> 03:16:42,430
The money is so good!

5559
03:16:44,450 --> 03:16:45,350
Yeah, move...

5560
03:16:45,350 --> 03:16:46,190
The ult sucks.

5561
03:16:46,450 --> 03:16:47,030
I hate the ult.

5562
03:16:47,810 --> 03:16:48,910
I don't like... Oh wait, fuck.

5563
03:16:48,970 --> 03:16:49,590
Okay, never mind.

5564
03:16:49,990 --> 03:16:50,830
Okay, never mind.

5565
03:16:50,950 --> 03:16:51,390
This is good.

5566
03:16:51,990 --> 03:16:52,910
It's good now.

5567
03:16:53,170 --> 03:16:54,990
There was just way too many batteries.

5568
03:16:55,410 --> 03:16:57,390
Oh no, is this like the...

5569
03:16:58,410 --> 03:17:00,610
Wait, we gotta grab the axe here.

5570
03:17:00,850 --> 03:17:01,370
We gotta grab the axe here.

5571
03:17:01,370 --> 03:17:01,990
And then...

5572
03:17:01,990 --> 03:17:03,230
The money!

5573
03:17:04,530 --> 03:17:06,670
Guys, how am I supposed to beat Touhou?

5574
03:17:07,170 --> 03:17:08,570
If I don't get rich here.

5575
03:17:08,710 --> 03:17:09,850
In Holokir.

5576
03:17:10,310 --> 03:17:13,110
The fuck am I supposed to beat...

5577
03:17:13,110 --> 03:17:14,210
Beat Touhou?

5578
03:17:15,230 --> 03:17:17,490
That's actually my greatest weakness, Touhou.

5579
03:17:18,410 --> 03:17:19,970
Alright, we gotta kill the battery.

5580
03:17:20,430 --> 03:17:20,990
Nice!

5581
03:17:21,470 --> 03:17:22,190
Battery gun.

5582
03:17:22,870 --> 03:17:23,350
Okay.

5583
03:17:23,790 --> 03:17:24,470
Monkey paw?

5584
03:17:24,670 --> 03:17:25,150
Three!

5585
03:17:25,430 --> 03:17:27,310
Oh, super energy drink.

5586
03:17:27,370 --> 03:17:28,210
Wait, is this really good?

5587
03:17:28,670 --> 03:17:30,950
Wait, this is... Is this an SSR?

5588
03:17:36,260 --> 03:17:37,080
Oh shit!

5589
03:17:37,200 --> 03:17:37,680
Nice.

5590
03:17:37,740 --> 03:17:38,800
Now I'm super fast.

5591
03:17:38,960 --> 03:17:40,380
Wait, there's four arrows?

5592
03:17:40,520 --> 03:17:42,800
What the fuck did I... Oh, I'm so fucking fast.

5593
03:17:43,060 --> 03:17:43,900
Oh my god.

5594
03:17:44,240 --> 03:17:46,200
I'm so fucking fast.

5595
03:17:46,640 --> 03:17:47,760
Okay, can we max?

5596
03:17:47,920 --> 03:17:48,880
Okay, we're gonna sell this.

5597
03:17:49,620 --> 03:17:50,100
Alright.

5598
03:17:50,180 --> 03:17:52,640
I'm gonna sell the... Do I sell this?

5599
03:17:53,800 --> 03:17:54,280
Chat?

5600
03:18:01,240 --> 03:18:03,120
No, I finished upgrading everything.

5601
03:18:03,300 --> 03:18:03,940
I'm pretty sure.

5602
03:18:04,840 --> 03:18:06,680
Yeah, everything's maxed.

5603
03:18:08,440 --> 03:18:08,980
Alright.

5604
03:18:09,080 --> 03:18:10,080
I fucking knew it.

5605
03:18:10,180 --> 03:18:12,180
I knew my luck was gonna change!

5606
03:18:12,740 --> 03:18:14,640
Woman, I've always believed in you.

5607
03:18:14,860 --> 03:18:16,000
I told you!

5608
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:17,340
The dude is the curse!

5609
03:18:18,020 --> 03:18:19,560
I fucking knew it!

5610
03:18:21,900 --> 03:18:23,400
I fucking knew it!

5611
03:18:23,400 --> 03:18:24,680
I knew it.

5612
03:18:24,900 --> 03:18:26,800
I fucking knew the dudes were the curse.

5613
03:18:26,980 --> 03:18:28,300
All this time.

5614
03:18:32,820 --> 03:18:33,280
Yeah.

5615
03:18:33,280 --> 03:18:33,340
God!

5616
03:18:33,860 --> 03:18:35,380
Never took the trumpet!

5617
03:18:35,980 --> 03:18:38,660
Suddenly get two SSRs?

5618
03:18:39,360 --> 03:18:39,820
Coincidence?

5619
03:18:40,460 --> 03:18:41,340
I think not.

5620
03:18:42,060 --> 03:18:42,860
I knew it.

5621
03:18:42,880 --> 03:18:45,100
I knew it was a fucking curse in the end.

5622
03:18:45,540 --> 03:18:46,980
I fucking called it.

5623
03:18:50,540 --> 03:18:51,960
Where the fuck is the bomb?

5624
03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:54,000
I'm like so worried about the bomb right now.

5625
03:18:54,080 --> 03:18:54,220
Oh!

5626
03:18:54,220 --> 03:18:54,340
Oh!

5627
03:18:55,420 --> 03:18:55,940
Okay.

5628
03:18:56,140 --> 03:18:57,200
I was not...

5629
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:59,180
I was not doing so well with that.

5630
03:18:59,400 --> 03:19:01,120
I need that burger.

5631
03:19:01,640 --> 03:19:03,000
Please give me that burger.

5632
03:19:04,620 --> 03:19:05,140
Okay.

5633
03:19:05,460 --> 03:19:06,240
Super collab!

5634
03:19:07,500 --> 03:19:08,340
What is it?

5635
03:19:08,440 --> 03:19:09,440
Wait, what do we combine?

5636
03:19:11,020 --> 03:19:12,460
What do we combine here?

5637
03:19:15,880 --> 03:19:16,860
What do we combine?

5638
03:19:23,700 --> 03:19:24,640
Dragon fire!

5639
03:19:26,620 --> 03:19:27,140
Wait.

5640
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:28,980
No soup.

5641
03:19:29,180 --> 03:19:30,920
Dragon fire and...

5642
03:19:30,920 --> 03:19:31,060
Okay.

5643
03:19:31,260 --> 03:19:32,480
Axe plus book.

5644
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:32,900
Okay.

5645
03:19:33,300 --> 03:19:33,860
Okay.

5646
03:19:34,040 --> 03:19:35,860
It's time to eat some black licorice again.

5647
03:19:36,880 --> 03:19:37,440
Okay.

5648
03:19:38,360 --> 03:19:39,600
It's time to eat some black licorice again.

5649
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:40,060
Okay.

5650
03:19:40,840 --> 03:19:41,800
Here we go.

5651
03:19:42,760 --> 03:19:43,320
Okay.

5652
03:19:43,320 --> 03:19:43,320
Here we go.

5653
03:19:45,240 --> 03:19:45,800
Okay.

5654
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:48,180
Oh my god.

5655
03:19:48,200 --> 03:19:49,180
I can't see anything.

5656
03:19:49,420 --> 03:19:49,700
Okay.

5657
03:19:51,880 --> 03:19:52,440
Okay.

5658
03:19:52,440 --> 03:19:55,000
We actually have to tone this down now.

5659
03:19:55,280 --> 03:19:55,800
Okay.

5660
03:19:56,380 --> 03:19:57,120
We actually have to tone this down now.

5661
03:19:57,120 --> 03:19:58,720
This is like too much.

5662
03:19:59,540 --> 03:20:02,140
This is actually too much on my screen.

5663
03:20:02,740 --> 03:20:03,580
This is actually too much on my screen.

5664
03:20:03,580 --> 03:20:03,780
Holy fuck.

5665
03:20:04,100 --> 03:20:04,600
Okay.

5666
03:20:04,620 --> 03:20:05,920
We need to grab...

5667
03:20:07,840 --> 03:20:08,600
Oh hey.

5668
03:20:08,780 --> 03:20:09,780
We need to...

5669
03:20:10,780 --> 03:20:11,740
Is this good?

5670
03:20:12,040 --> 03:20:12,380
Okay.

5671
03:20:13,880 --> 03:20:14,900
We can sell this.

5672
03:20:15,320 --> 03:20:16,420
Oh I don't have hammer?

5673
03:20:16,600 --> 03:20:16,820
Yeah.

5674
03:20:16,900 --> 03:20:17,680
I need to find a hammer.

5675
03:20:18,800 --> 03:20:20,380
That green thing over there?

5676
03:20:20,540 --> 03:20:21,320
That's the dude.

5677
03:20:21,620 --> 03:20:24,100
If I keep it there, I'll have good luck.

5678
03:20:25,900 --> 03:20:26,380
Uhhhhh...

5679
03:20:27,820 --> 03:20:28,600
Let's see.

5680
03:20:29,280 --> 03:20:29,960
One earth.

5681
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:30,720
One, two, three, four.

5682
03:20:30,980 --> 03:20:32,060
Pirate, thank you for the super chat.

5683
03:20:32,140 --> 03:20:32,380
Thank you.

5684
03:20:32,400 --> 03:20:33,000
Take that.

5685
03:20:33,400 --> 03:20:33,880
Alright.

5686
03:20:39,220 --> 03:20:39,700
Uhhhhh...

5687
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:40,040
Hammer?

5688
03:20:40,400 --> 03:20:40,880
Head...

5689
03:20:40,880 --> 03:20:41,720
Lava?

5690
03:20:41,940 --> 03:20:42,220
Okay.

5691
03:20:42,560 --> 03:20:43,900
I don't know why I said hammer.

5692
03:20:44,080 --> 03:20:46,080
I meant lava.

5693
03:20:47,600 --> 03:20:49,980
My brain is not working so well.

5694
03:20:50,180 --> 03:20:53,320
I've been playing holo cure for like three hours already.

5695
03:20:54,100 --> 03:20:54,340
Wooo!

5696
03:20:56,100 --> 03:20:56,540
Hammer!

5697
03:20:57,180 --> 03:20:58,200
I got the hammer!

5698
03:20:58,880 --> 03:21:00,500
Guys we just need the monkey paw!

5699
03:21:02,020 --> 03:21:02,680
Oh god.

5700
03:21:02,820 --> 03:21:03,100
Oh!

5701
03:21:03,180 --> 03:21:04,160
Do I take this now?

5702
03:21:04,240 --> 03:21:05,400
Or do I wait until monkey paw?

5703
03:21:09,900 --> 03:21:11,600
Do I take that now or wait?

5704
03:21:13,920 --> 03:21:14,360
Now?

5705
03:21:16,220 --> 03:21:16,660
Okay.

5706
03:21:16,660 --> 03:21:17,100
Okay.

5707
03:21:18,440 --> 03:21:19,180
What do I do?

5708
03:21:19,600 --> 03:21:20,040

5709
03:21:21,480 --> 03:21:22,140
Monkey paw!

5710
03:21:22,480 --> 03:21:22,920
Okay.

03:21:23,420 --> 03:21:23,960
That's it?

5712
03:21:24,160 --> 03:21:24,620
Is that it?

5713
03:21:27,480 --> 03:21:27,920
Yes.

5714
03:21:27,960 --> 03:21:27,980
Yeah?

5715
03:21:29,380 --> 03:21:30,220
Oh okay.

5716
03:21:30,380 --> 03:21:31,040
What do I get?

5717
03:21:32,100 --> 03:21:33,020
Holy fire.

5718
03:21:33,320 --> 03:21:36,000
Spits flames which contains the strength of 50 kg.

5719
03:21:36,340 --> 03:21:38,700
All attack damage is also multiplied.

5720
03:21:38,980 --> 03:21:39,700
Holy shit.

5721
03:21:40,380 --> 03:21:40,940
Alright.

5722
03:21:41,260 --> 03:21:42,180
Oh my god.

5723
03:21:42,560 --> 03:21:43,840
Can we get super chat?

5724
03:21:44,020 --> 03:21:45,940
Now super chat is free for sure.

5725
03:21:46,260 --> 03:21:47,000
Oh no.

5726
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:47,580
Okay.

5727
03:21:49,340 --> 03:21:49,900
Uhhhhhhh...

5728
03:21:51,020 --> 03:21:52,580
Do we sell this or keep?

5729
03:21:55,600 --> 03:21:56,160
Sell?

5730
03:21:56,520 --> 03:21:57,080
Sell?

5731
03:21:59,060 --> 03:21:59,660
Sell.

5732
03:21:59,840 --> 03:22:00,220
Okay.

5733
03:22:00,380 --> 03:22:01,340
Oh no it's him.

5734
03:22:01,560 --> 03:22:02,880
Oh no it's him.

5735
03:22:04,260 --> 03:22:05,400
Oh no please.

5736
03:22:05,740 --> 03:22:06,340
Please.

5737
03:22:07,200 --> 03:22:13,000
There's no way that I was gonna say I'm so fucking strong now there's no fucking way.

5738
03:22:16,560 --> 03:22:17,160
Alright.

5739
03:22:17,300 --> 03:22:17,500
Alright.

5740
03:22:17,500 --> 03:22:19,200
We're gonna grab more super chat.

5741
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:23,960
Oh my god.

5742
03:22:24,020 --> 03:22:25,180
What is my screen?

5743
03:22:25,640 --> 03:22:26,240
What?

5744
03:22:28,760 --> 03:22:31,680
Let's go back and just grab everything I missed.

5745
03:22:33,280 --> 03:22:35,560
Oh my... They can't even walk anymore!

5746
03:22:37,160 --> 03:22:38,600
I fucked them up!

5747
03:22:40,540 --> 03:22:42,000
Oh there's this knockback.

5748
03:22:42,400 --> 03:22:43,580
It's so confusing.

5749
03:22:43,800 --> 03:22:46,900
I don't know what's a character and what's an attack anymore.

5750
03:22:51,120 --> 03:22:52,760
It's like such a blur.

5751
03:22:52,940 --> 03:22:55,080
I feel like I can actually stand still.

5752
03:22:55,920 --> 03:22:59,700
I'm pretty sure I can actually just stand still and not have to worry about it.

5753
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:01,480
Yeah I'm at that stage.

5754
03:23:01,640 --> 03:23:02,820
I'm definitely at that stage.

5755
03:23:07,880 --> 03:23:08,400
Alright.

5756
03:23:10,120 --> 03:23:10,640
Uhhhhhhh...

5757
03:23:10,640 --> 03:23:11,360
Alright headphones.

5758
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:14,400
Oh no never mind I can't.

5759
03:23:14,660 --> 03:23:16,200
I can't keep... Okay I can!

5760
03:23:16,340 --> 03:23:16,840
I can kill them!

5761
03:23:17,580 --> 03:23:19,660
That's right I have all the powers!

5762
03:23:20,320 --> 03:23:23,940
I have every perm except for Nintendo because I'm a straight up Nintendo.

5763
03:23:26,140 --> 03:23:26,580
Alright.

5764
03:23:27,280 --> 03:23:28,160
Uhhhh lava.

5765
03:23:29,060 --> 03:23:31,020
Okay we're gonna grab...

5766
03:23:33,420 --> 03:23:34,640
Do we get bomb or nah?

5767
03:23:35,260 --> 03:23:37,420
Do the... give in to the dude.

5768
03:23:37,880 --> 03:23:39,140
Sneeze thank you for the super chat!

5769
03:23:39,200 --> 03:23:39,940
Thank you thank you!

5770
03:23:40,080 --> 03:23:41,240
Clock thank you for the super chat!

5771
03:23:41,340 --> 03:23:41,860
Thank you thank you!

5772
03:23:41,900 --> 03:23:43,880
I'm gonna get super chat.

5773
03:23:46,280 --> 03:23:47,840
One fear Nintendo.

5774
03:23:51,840 --> 03:23:52,280
Alright.

5775
03:23:52,280 --> 03:23:52,500
Alright.

5776
03:23:52,520 --> 03:23:56,600
The one company you do not wanna piss off.

5777
03:23:56,880 --> 03:23:57,920
They have...

5778
03:23:57,920 --> 03:24:00,100
They have like so much power.

5779
03:24:00,420 --> 03:24:01,400
They don't...

5780
03:24:02,280 --> 03:24:04,220
Because it's like one of those...

5781
03:24:04,220 --> 03:24:06,760
It's like a company that's more so of like...

5782
03:24:06,760 --> 03:24:07,100
Um...

5783
03:24:07,100 --> 03:24:13,860
They know they have so much good publicity that like bad publicity doesn't hurt them.

5784
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:15,640
Because they hold...

5785
03:24:15,640 --> 03:24:22,880
They hold so much good publicity at that point that like they can just release a new Zelda game and people will just forget.

5786
03:24:28,500 --> 03:24:29,700
Like... No!

5787
03:24:29,900 --> 03:24:30,740
It's true!

5788
03:24:31,140 --> 03:24:33,240
You can be like Wow Nintendo.

5789
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:34,760
Why would you do that?

5790
03:24:34,880 --> 03:24:40,200
And then the moment they announce a new Zelda game everybody will forget all the bad shit.

5791
03:24:46,520 --> 03:24:49,000
They booed her because she's right!

5792
03:24:54,660 --> 03:24:56,020
Sadly true.

5793
03:24:56,640 --> 03:24:58,340
Do we sell or keep this?

5794
03:25:00,300 --> 03:25:01,480
Do we...

5795
03:25:01,480 --> 03:25:02,340
Do we...

5796
03:25:03,240 --> 03:25:03,920
Swap?

5797
03:25:05,260 --> 03:25:05,940
Okay.

5798
03:25:10,360 --> 03:25:11,940
Do we swap or sell?

5799
03:25:12,020 --> 03:25:12,280
Sell.

5800
03:25:12,400 --> 03:25:12,960
Okay I'm gonna sell.

5801
03:25:15,200 --> 03:25:17,920
You can't boo her because she's right.

5802
03:25:21,720 --> 03:25:22,840
It's true.

5803
03:25:23,700 --> 03:25:24,940
It's so true.

5804
03:25:25,240 --> 03:25:25,500
No.

5805
03:25:25,560 --> 03:25:25,740
No.

5806
03:25:25,880 --> 03:25:26,360
She's coming.

5807
03:25:26,660 --> 03:25:27,860
Oh no.

5808
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:28,900
It's Touhou.

5809
03:25:28,980 --> 03:25:29,560
No.

5810
03:25:29,680 --> 03:25:31,020
Not Touhou!

5811
03:25:32,460 --> 03:25:34,220
I can't do Touhou!

5812
03:25:37,540 --> 03:25:39,460
Like it's so bad because I can't...

5813
03:25:39,460 --> 03:25:40,440
I actually can't see!

5814
03:25:40,820 --> 03:25:43,320
I can't see my attacks!

5815
03:25:47,020 --> 03:25:49,000
I can't see!

5816
03:25:52,740 --> 03:25:59,520
It's bad because I don't know I don't know where... which was her attack and which one is mine!

5817
03:26:03,620 --> 03:26:05,360
That's not what it's about.

5818
03:26:08,260 --> 03:26:09,540
Oh god.

5819
03:26:09,640 --> 03:26:10,360
Oh I did it!

5820
03:26:10,580 --> 03:26:11,640
I did it!

5821
03:26:11,640 --> 03:26:12,240
Look at me!

5822
03:26:14,900 --> 03:26:16,420
We did it!

5823
03:26:17,080 --> 03:26:18,180
Holy fuck!

5824
03:26:18,320 --> 03:26:18,700
Okay.

5825
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:19,460
I knew it!

5826
03:26:19,460 --> 03:26:20,140
Mumei no!

5827
03:26:20,420 --> 03:26:23,680
I know you couldn't fucking disappoint me!

5828
03:26:26,620 --> 03:26:27,740
Holy shit.

5829
03:26:28,020 --> 03:26:28,580
Nice.

5830
03:26:28,640 --> 03:26:29,200
We did it.

5831
03:26:30,520 --> 03:26:31,080
Oh!

5832
03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:33,440
We did it guys.

5833
03:26:33,860 --> 03:26:35,020
Oh my god.

5834
03:26:36,620 --> 03:26:38,260
Oh my god.

5835
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:40,440
Let's go to Mumei's house.

5836
03:26:41,140 --> 03:26:41,860
Let's go.

5837
03:26:42,840 --> 03:26:43,960
Hello Mumei.

5838
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:44,640
What is this?

5839
03:26:45,420 --> 03:26:46,620
Oh my god they're all here!

5840
03:26:46,780 --> 03:26:47,360
What are you doing?

5841
03:26:47,420 --> 03:26:48,560
This is my fucking...

5842
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:49,400
village!

5843
03:26:50,280 --> 03:26:51,620
Do I have enough money?

5844
03:26:51,800 --> 03:26:52,580
Where's my fishing?

5845
03:26:53,600 --> 03:26:54,240
Okay.

5846
03:26:54,260 --> 03:26:54,720
Fishing.

5847
03:26:55,660 --> 03:26:56,640
Beginner's rod.

5848
03:26:57,300 --> 03:26:58,120
Dad's rod.

5849
03:26:59,160 --> 03:27:00,140
Golden rod.

5850
03:27:00,400 --> 03:27:00,720
Okay.

5851
03:27:00,860 --> 03:27:01,660
How do I sell?

5852
03:27:01,740 --> 03:27:02,340
Exchange?

5853
03:27:02,340 --> 03:27:02,760
Talk?

5854
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:04,680
Welcome to the fish shop.

5855
03:27:05,840 --> 03:27:08,300
I'm Bloop and I trade in fishing goods.

5856
03:27:08,520 --> 03:27:08,840
Okay.

5857
03:27:08,980 --> 03:27:09,980
How do I fish?

5858
03:27:11,280 --> 03:27:11,920
Hello.

5859
03:27:15,490 --> 03:27:16,130
Oh.

5860
03:27:18,590 --> 03:27:19,290
Guys.

5861
03:27:19,290 --> 03:27:19,990
I...

5862
03:27:19,990 --> 03:27:20,450
Guys!

5863
03:27:20,550 --> 03:27:20,910
I...

5864
03:27:22,950 --> 03:27:25,330
I don't have the right keyboard!

5865
03:27:25,710 --> 03:27:31,620
I don't have arrow keys!

5866
03:27:32,580 --> 03:27:33,280
Like...

5867
03:27:34,920 --> 03:27:37,200
I don't have arrow keys!

5868
03:27:37,820 --> 03:27:38,520
Okay.

5869
03:27:38,620 --> 03:27:39,240
Now we're good.

5870
03:27:40,280 --> 03:27:41,460
Now we're good.

5871
03:27:41,680 --> 03:27:42,380
Okay.

5872
03:27:42,480 --> 03:27:42,940
Here we go.

5873
03:27:43,670 --> 03:27:44,020
Boom.

5874
03:27:44,780 --> 03:27:45,480
Wait.

5875
03:27:45,560 --> 03:27:45,760
What?

5876
03:27:46,020 --> 03:27:47,740
Is this not arrow keys?

5877
03:27:48,900 --> 03:27:49,460
How?

5878
03:27:50,500 --> 03:27:52,220
I'm using the arrow keys!

5879
03:27:54,240 --> 03:27:55,360
It's WASD?

5880
03:27:56,380 --> 03:27:56,940
It's WASD?

5881
03:27:56,940 --> 03:27:57,000
Okay.

5882
03:27:57,200 --> 03:27:58,060
It's WASD.

5883
03:27:58,220 --> 03:27:58,700
Okay.

5884
03:28:00,800 --> 03:28:01,360
It's WASD.

5885
03:28:01,360 --> 03:28:02,000
How the fuck?

5886
03:28:02,220 --> 03:28:03,620
I see arrow key.

5887
03:28:04,200 --> 03:28:06,140
I see arrow key.

5888
03:28:06,140 --> 03:28:07,420
I see arrow key.

5889
03:28:07,520 --> 03:28:09,420
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

5890
03:28:10,300 --> 03:28:10,860
Like...

5891
03:28:11,500 --> 03:28:13,400
My brain goes like...

5892
03:28:13,400 --> 03:28:13,680
Oh.

5893
03:28:13,680 --> 03:28:13,940
Hey.

5894
03:28:14,020 --> 03:28:14,520
Arrow key.

5895
03:28:14,860 --> 03:28:15,600
Oh shit.

5896
03:28:15,640 --> 03:28:16,340
I got two now.

5897
03:28:16,360 --> 03:28:17,000
Are these real people?

5898
03:28:18,180 --> 03:28:19,380
Are you real people?

5899
03:28:20,280 --> 03:28:21,400
Can I have more stuff?

5900
03:28:24,840 --> 03:28:25,340
Hello.

5901
03:28:25,380 --> 03:28:26,000
Are you real?

5902
03:28:27,380 --> 03:28:27,880
Hello.

5903
03:28:28,080 --> 03:28:28,320
Are you real?

5904
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:28,320
Hello.

5905
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:28,700
Are you real?

5906
03:28:29,580 --> 03:28:30,080
Aww.

5907
03:28:30,620 --> 03:28:32,300
That would be great if they were real.

5908
03:28:32,960 --> 03:28:33,460
Aww.

5909
03:28:34,660 --> 03:28:35,160
That would be great if they were real.

5910
03:28:35,160 --> 03:28:35,880
I was gonna say like...

5911
03:28:35,880 --> 03:28:36,800
Give me all your fish.

5912
03:28:37,400 --> 03:28:38,360
If you're real.

5913
03:28:39,520 --> 03:28:40,500
Oh my god.

5914
03:28:40,680 --> 03:28:41,440
The real game.

5915
03:28:42,400 --> 03:28:42,900
Nice.

5916
03:28:43,100 --> 03:28:43,740
What do I do?

5917
03:28:43,980 --> 03:28:45,280
Can I sell my fish?

5918
03:28:45,280 --> 03:28:48,060
I guess I sell my fish for stuff, right?

5919
03:28:48,680 --> 03:28:52,440
So the more fish I have...

5920
03:28:54,180 --> 03:28:56,340
They're chat GPT.

5921
03:28:56,920 --> 03:28:58,120
They're chat GPT.

5922
03:28:59,040 --> 03:28:59,600
They're chat GPT.

5923
03:29:01,420 --> 03:29:02,540
They're also...

5924
03:29:02,540 --> 03:29:04,940
Why can't I not recruit my fans?

5925
03:29:05,180 --> 03:29:05,320
Why can't I not recruit my fans?

5926
03:29:05,320 --> 03:29:06,260
To fish for me!

5927
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:07,360
To fish for me!

5928
03:29:11,160 --> 03:29:12,940
I can't believe it.

5929
03:29:13,060 --> 03:29:14,360
This is fucked up.

5930
03:29:14,940 --> 03:29:16,220
I can't like...

5931
03:29:16,220 --> 03:29:18,300
I can't have my fans...

5932
03:29:18,300 --> 03:29:19,440
fish for me.

5933
03:29:19,600 --> 03:29:20,460
So I can...

5934
03:29:20,460 --> 03:29:21,420
Oh I can cook!

5935
03:29:21,880 --> 03:29:22,840
I can make tempura!

5936
03:29:23,600 --> 03:29:25,860
Increase attack by... What do I need attack for?

5937
03:29:26,120 --> 03:29:27,380
Is it for like just this run?

5938
03:29:28,060 --> 03:29:28,820
What is this?

5939
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:30,500
Manage, hire, send out...

5940
03:29:30,500 --> 03:29:32,260
an advertisement to get recruits.

5941
03:29:32,500 --> 03:29:33,700
Do I... Can I... Oh!

5942
03:29:33,940 --> 03:29:35,980
Can I collect my fans here?

5943
03:29:39,080 --> 03:29:39,600
Eww.

5944
03:29:42,760 --> 03:29:44,140
They are cooked.

5945
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:47,660
Why do I need... Oh thank you!

5946
03:29:47,880 --> 03:29:49,100
Okay, why do I need a cook?

5947
03:29:49,940 --> 03:29:51,100
Okay, I'll make one tempura.

5948
03:29:51,980 --> 03:29:53,760
I don't have enough money for tempura.

5949
03:29:58,880 --> 03:29:59,980
How do I...

5950
03:29:59,980 --> 03:30:01,180
How do I like...

5951
03:30:01,180 --> 03:30:02,040
Okay, let's see.

5952
03:30:02,100 --> 03:30:02,340
Bye.

5953
03:30:04,780 --> 03:30:06,440
Is there a way to like...

5954
03:30:06,440 --> 03:30:07,600
How do I collect my fans?

5955
03:30:07,720 --> 03:30:10,540
How do I steal other people's fans?

5956
03:30:10,640 --> 03:30:11,820
How do I steal other people's fans?

5957
03:30:16,480 --> 03:30:18,500
I think that's like the better question.

5958
03:30:18,680 --> 03:30:21,240
How do I steal other people's fans?

5959
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:22,020
How do I steal other people's fans?

5960
03:30:22,280 --> 03:30:24,160
Just lead me to my...

5961
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:25,140
I guess.

5962
03:30:25,940 --> 03:30:26,500
Hire.

5963
03:30:26,660 --> 03:30:28,060
Oh I have to hire people.

5964
03:30:28,480 --> 03:30:29,040
Okay.

5965
03:30:29,360 --> 03:30:31,260
I can't believe I have to pay the money!

5966
03:30:34,580 --> 03:30:35,140
Okay.

5967
03:30:35,540 --> 03:30:36,300
Let's see.

5968
03:30:36,580 --> 03:30:38,140
We'll grab a...

5969
03:30:38,140 --> 03:30:39,120
What can I make you do?

5970
03:30:40,180 --> 03:30:40,740
Tomato.

5971
03:30:41,200 --> 03:30:41,700
Alright.

5972
03:30:42,260 --> 03:30:42,820
Status.

5973
03:30:43,160 --> 03:30:44,080
We like curling...

5974
03:30:44,140 --> 03:30:45,380
I don't have tomatoes!

5975
03:30:49,960 --> 03:30:51,440
There, you're a bird now.

5976
03:30:51,640 --> 03:30:53,340
I mean, it's the closest to a...

5977
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:55,240
It's the closest to a dragoon.

5978
03:30:57,080 --> 03:31:00,160
I can't believe it's a tomato too.

5979
03:31:01,100 --> 03:31:02,840
What do you do?

5980
03:31:03,860 --> 03:31:04,500
Collection?

5981
03:31:04,820 --> 03:31:05,720
Give me your money.

5982
03:31:11,780 --> 03:31:13,600
Give me your fucking...

5983
03:31:14,140 --> 03:31:15,680
Give me your fucking money, dragoon.

5984
03:31:17,820 --> 03:31:18,340
Nice.

5985
03:31:18,560 --> 03:31:19,640
That's fucking right.

5986
03:31:20,200 --> 03:31:21,620
EARN ME THE MONEY!

5987
03:31:23,600 --> 03:31:25,120
My lunch money.

5988
03:31:25,580 --> 03:31:26,080
My lunch money.

5989
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:27,800
Alright, we gotta fucking plant a tomato apparently.

5990
03:31:28,320 --> 03:31:29,600
Put me in boss.

5991
03:31:29,780 --> 03:31:31,160
Thank you for the super chat.

5992
03:31:31,240 --> 03:31:32,000
Thank you, thank you.

5993
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:34,620
Kato, thank you for the super chat.

5994
03:31:34,700 --> 03:31:35,340
Thank you, thank you.

5995
03:31:35,380 --> 03:31:36,160
I know it hurts.

5996
03:31:36,300 --> 03:31:38,120
But you might have to read.

5997
03:31:38,360 --> 03:31:38,620
No!

5998
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:39,520
Never!

5999
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:43,240
You'll never get me to read.

6000
03:31:43,600 --> 03:31:44,120
You'll never get me to read.

6001
03:31:44,140 --> 03:31:45,100
Alright, wait.

6002
03:31:45,540 --> 03:31:47,200
What about my fucking...

6003
03:31:47,200 --> 03:31:48,640
I don't have standard soil?

6004
03:31:49,000 --> 03:31:49,480
Okay.

6005
03:31:50,360 --> 03:31:51,220
Standard soil.

6006
03:31:51,320 --> 03:31:53,240
Okay, I'm gonna get enhanced soil.

6007
03:31:53,260 --> 03:31:53,820
I have...

6008
03:31:53,820 --> 03:31:55,400
I have the money for this.

6009
03:31:55,560 --> 03:31:55,920
Okay.

6010
03:31:56,520 --> 03:31:57,340
Just a plant.

6011
03:31:58,220 --> 03:31:59,060
A tomato.

6012
03:31:59,300 --> 03:32:00,040
There we go.

6013
03:32:00,220 --> 03:32:01,760
I have to feed my dragoon somehow.

6014
03:32:02,580 --> 03:32:03,200
That's right.

6015
03:32:03,540 --> 03:32:04,720
That's fucking right, grant.

6016
03:32:05,540 --> 03:32:06,400
That's fucking right.

6017
03:32:06,500 --> 03:32:07,360
EARN YOUR KEEP!

6018
03:32:11,940 --> 03:32:12,420
Hello.

6019
03:32:14,140 --> 03:32:15,680
Alright, I should buy like something.

6020
03:32:16,080 --> 03:32:18,140
Let me buy...

6021
03:32:20,180 --> 03:32:20,840
Uhhh...

6022
03:32:21,760 --> 03:32:23,220
We'll buy a...

6023
03:32:23,220 --> 03:32:25,860
We'll just buy a... We'll buy a gamer chair.

6024
03:32:26,400 --> 03:32:27,860
We'll buy... Okay, we're...

6025
03:32:27,860 --> 03:32:28,940
Yellow gamer chair.

6026
03:32:29,360 --> 03:32:30,320
What the fuck?

6027
03:32:30,340 --> 03:32:33,120
It's 75 thousand dollars?

6028
03:32:33,910 --> 03:32:34,240
Bro!

6029
03:32:34,600 --> 03:32:37,680
This gamer chair better fucking fix my back.

6030
03:32:37,800 --> 03:32:38,960
My back's okay, but...

6031
03:32:40,580 --> 03:32:43,860
I better never have back problems in my life.

6032
03:32:44,140 --> 03:32:44,580
After that.

6033
03:32:44,880 --> 03:32:46,300
Like, what the fuck?

6034
03:32:46,740 --> 03:32:48,400
Do I have to water my tomato?

6035
03:32:48,720 --> 03:32:49,560
Just die.

6036
03:32:53,840 --> 03:32:54,880
75 thousand...

6037
03:32:54,880 --> 03:32:55,360
Bro, okay.

6038
03:32:55,600 --> 03:32:56,980
I can't believe it.

6039
03:32:57,020 --> 03:32:58,420
I'm gonna sleep on the fucking floor.

6040
03:33:02,060 --> 03:33:04,240
Like, why the fuck is the...

6041
03:33:04,240 --> 03:33:04,720
Bro!

6042
03:33:04,920 --> 03:33:05,880
And the night...

6043
03:33:05,880 --> 03:33:07,540
I'm fucking buying this zero dollars.

6044
03:33:07,820 --> 03:33:08,300
Bro.

6045
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:11,560
This is way too fucking expensive, man.

6046
03:33:11,560 --> 03:33:13,680
Bro, we're gonna sleep on the fucking couch.

6047
03:33:15,740 --> 03:33:16,980
Apparently... What the fuck?

6048
03:33:17,420 --> 03:33:18,940
What are these guys doing there?

6049
03:33:19,580 --> 03:33:20,680
Are you okay, Kiara?

6050
03:33:21,280 --> 03:33:21,760
Alright.

6051
03:33:22,520 --> 03:33:23,380
Okay, inventory.

6052
03:33:25,400 --> 03:33:25,880
Apparently...

6053
03:33:25,880 --> 03:33:26,780
Wait, build mode.

6054
03:33:27,180 --> 03:33:28,880
How do I fucking put my stuff here?

6055
03:33:30,140 --> 03:33:30,620
Okay.

6056
03:33:30,620 --> 03:33:31,100
Bed.

6057
03:33:32,220 --> 03:33:32,980
There you go.

6058
03:33:33,700 --> 03:33:34,280
That's it.

6059
03:33:34,340 --> 03:33:34,980
That's all I need.

6060
03:33:36,080 --> 03:33:37,220
Oh wait, I can...

6061
03:33:37,220 --> 03:33:38,260
Wait, can I put a shrimp?

6062
03:33:38,400 --> 03:33:38,680
No.

6063
03:33:39,960 --> 03:33:41,220
This is all I need.

6064
03:33:42,800 --> 03:33:43,500
There you go.

6065
03:33:43,920 --> 03:33:44,320
Nice.

6066
03:33:45,240 --> 03:33:45,860
I can't.

6067
03:33:45,940 --> 03:33:46,140
I'm stuck.

6068
03:33:49,600 --> 03:33:51,060
Did I just find a bug?

6069
03:33:55,120 --> 03:33:55,920
Of course.

6070
03:33:56,060 --> 03:33:56,380
Of course.

6071
03:33:56,680 --> 03:33:58,060
If it's anybody, it's me.

6072
03:33:58,440 --> 03:34:00,140
If it's anybody, it's me.

6073
03:34:00,220 --> 03:34:01,020
Okay, here we go.

6074
03:34:02,400 --> 03:34:03,060
There we go.

6075
03:34:03,600 --> 03:34:04,260
Of course.

6076
03:34:04,740 --> 03:34:06,180
Only I can find bugs.

6077
03:34:06,860 --> 03:34:07,260
Alright.

6078
03:34:07,380 --> 03:34:10,100
So when you place it on top of a person, you get stuck.

6079
03:34:11,560 --> 03:34:12,220
You get stuck.

6080
03:34:14,920 --> 03:34:16,020
Who would've thought?

6081
03:34:16,420 --> 03:34:19,580
Who would've thought?

6082
03:34:20,920 --> 03:34:21,500
Who would've thought?

6083
03:34:21,500 --> 03:34:23,040
What the fuck are you doing here?

6084
03:34:23,380 --> 03:34:24,700
Do I have a pet army too?

6085
03:34:27,560 --> 03:34:30,420
What are you doing there?

6086
03:34:30,500 --> 03:34:30,560
What are you doing there?

6087
03:34:30,560 --> 03:34:31,660
Oh my god, you're earning your money.

6088
03:34:32,200 --> 03:34:32,720
Nice.

6089
03:34:32,780 --> 03:34:33,300
Good job.

6090
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:37,200
I already saw what's behind the house.

6091
03:34:37,680 --> 03:34:39,140
There's a bunch of these guys.

6092
03:34:39,140 --> 03:34:40,400
These fuckers over here.

6093
03:34:40,940 --> 03:34:41,500
Yeah.

6094
03:34:43,020 --> 03:34:43,580
Later.

6095
03:34:43,720 --> 03:34:44,940
Yeah, what are you guys doing, huh?

6096
03:34:45,340 --> 03:34:47,600
Yeah, what the fuck are you guys doing over there, huh?

6097
03:34:47,700 --> 03:34:48,960
Yeah, what the fuck are you guys doing over there, huh?

6098
03:34:50,060 --> 03:34:52,340
She's keeping them in line.

6099
03:34:53,400 --> 03:34:54,240
Feed us?

6100
03:34:54,380 --> 03:34:55,560
I don't have food!

6101
03:34:56,880 --> 03:34:59,080
Oh my god, I have to water.

6102
03:34:59,940 --> 03:35:00,040
Oh my god, I have to water.

6103
03:35:00,220 --> 03:35:01,320
Just chill.

6104
03:35:01,780 --> 03:35:03,880
You'll get your fucking food soon.

6105
03:35:07,180 --> 03:35:07,740
Chill.

6106
03:35:07,740 --> 03:35:08,000
Eww.

6107
03:35:08,800 --> 03:35:10,480
Or you can starve, I don't know.

6108
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:15,560
Alright.

6109
03:35:16,180 --> 03:35:16,880
You know what?

6110
03:35:18,220 --> 03:35:21,040
Oh my god, I can talk about my Zazudon!

6111
03:35:21,900 --> 03:35:22,900
Oh my god.

6112
03:35:23,340 --> 03:35:27,040
Anyway, as I was saying, for HoloFest shit, that shit was so fucking...

6113
03:35:27,040 --> 03:35:32,180
I don't know, I'm pretty sure some of them must... You have to do dance classes and stuff.

6114
03:35:32,320 --> 03:35:33,160
I remember I had to...

6115
03:35:33,160 --> 03:35:36,620
I did personal dance classes and everything too.

6116
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:39,800
And like, oh my god, it's so much work!

6117
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:45,920
So like, I know how like, it's like, that plus tenfold, cause they're doing a concert too.

6118
03:35:46,200 --> 03:35:47,720
Like, oh my god.

6119
03:35:48,100 --> 03:35:53,020

03:38:03,430 --> 03:38:04,070
Free fish.

6172
03:38:04,810 --> 03:38:07,830
There's no balanced diet, it's just tomatoes.

6174

03:38:41,550 --> 03:38:44,210

6188
03:38:44,210 --> 03:38:50,670
I just knew it was like super addicting, but like oh my god I didn't realize how addicting this game is.

6189
03:38:50,850 --> 03:38:54,690
