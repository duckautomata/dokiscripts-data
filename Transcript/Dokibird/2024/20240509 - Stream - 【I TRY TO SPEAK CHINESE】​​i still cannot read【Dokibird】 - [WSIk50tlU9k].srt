00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,360
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,040
Hello!

3
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,680
Hello!

4
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:47,540
Hello!

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,300
Hi, I'm Lukey's cat.

6
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,140
You can tell when I swapped the Chinese accent with my hello.

7
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,920
Hello!

8
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,140
Hello!

9
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,940
You're getting in the mood already?

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,460
Yeah, I'm getting in the mood.

11
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,240
It's been a while since I spoke.

12
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,180
Well, that's not true.

13
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,540
Really?

14
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,160
How long?

15
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,860
Well, I speak Chinese to my parents, but like...

16
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,820
Oh really?

17
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,880
Then you're like an expert, aren't you?

18
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,320
No, I am not.

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,280
I think you're better than me.

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,540
No, no, no.

21
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,500
You actually know how to read and write.

22
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,840
That's different.

23
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,880
What do you mean?

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,400
No, but you speak to your parents in Chinese.

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,100
I speak to my parents in English.

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,120
Bro, I like... okay.

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,000
No, no, no, no.

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,340
Cause like, I speak like... like... like elementary school Chinese though.

29
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,260
Really?

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,520
No, I doubt it.

31
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,800
No.

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,260
Yeah, cause they're like, what do you wanna eat?

33
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,360
And I'll be like, I wanna eat this.

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
I think you're... no.

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,080
I think you're gonna teach me some words today.

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,820
I don't know.

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,080
I'm scared now.

38
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,760
I was... yeah, I was like, okay.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,760
Let me think what I can... hmm... slang words.

40
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,480
Hmm...

41
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,680
Yeah, I know... curse words.

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,120
What?

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,620
Chinese curse words?

44
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,160
I mean, isn't that like the first thing everybody learns?

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,760
That's true.

46
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,280
In every language, you learn like the curse words for every language.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,280
Yeah?

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,540
That is so true.

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,280
Of course, you wanna curse out your teammates a little.

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,200
Yeah, that's true.

51
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,940
By the way, guys.

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,100
Hiro and I were like, talking before... we were like in the... in the starting stream.

53
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,340
She has... she streamed 16 hours yesterday because of Apex and Honkai.

54
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,640
I was like...

55
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,260
Yeah, I... I was... I was going crazy last night.

56
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,780
It was really... it was crazy.

57
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,940
Because I really did not expect like the Honkai story to be like that long, the update.

58
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,300
So I was like, okay, I stream Apex.

59
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,920
You know what?

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,000
It's updated.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm gonna play it for a little while and then pick him night.

62
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,500
Oh my gosh.

63
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,900
Wait, so like... I've asked Ditter this, but how much money have you spent on Honkai?

64
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,460
Uh... wait.

65
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,180
Yeah?

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,340
I don't know.

67
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,760
Do you have... how many characters do you have?

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,740
How many characters do you have on Honkai?

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,340
Let me see.

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,460
Let me see.

71
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,180
I think I can open my game right now.

72
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,040
Wait.

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,140
Let me... let me check.

74
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,580
Because Ditto has 37.

75
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,200
Now, apparently that's the total, right?

76
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,680
Is that the total amount of characters Honkai has?

77
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,920
She has 37?

78
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,420
That's kind of... that's a lot.

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,000
But I have more.

80
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,500
I have...

81
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,740
Wait, you have more?

82
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,840
There's more than 37?

83
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,360
There's 40 and total...

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,120
There's 48 in total!

85
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:55,880
Yeah, I... I... I like... I played since the beginning, but I also took a break for like 6 months and I came back 2 months ago, I think.

86
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,360
Oh, okay.

87
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,340
So like...

88
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,500
So then you have to catch up after... after taking a break.

89
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,540
And then you got...

90
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,440
So you... the only characters you're missing are the ones that you didn't get when you were at break, right?

91
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:08,940
Yeah!

92
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,840
Yeah!

93
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,820
Yeah!

94
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,440
Because I was collecting all of them and then after that I was like, oh crap.

95
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,420
I have like so much like... so many other games to play.

96
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,880
So I was like, okay, I gotta take a break from that.

97
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,960
And like 6 months later I came back and I'm like, oh, I really wanna play it.

98
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,020
Really wanna play it.

99
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,720
Oh my god.

100
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,400
Wait, what other gacha games do you play other than Honkai?

101
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:33,940
Now?

102
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:34,720
Yeah.

103
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,840
Well...

104
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,420
Actually none other... because it's expensive, okay?

105
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,800
Yeah, it's true.

106
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,280
It's gacha.

107
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:51,440
Yeah, you only... like if you play more than like... I think 2 is like the maximum anybody should have because like 1 is like crazy.

108
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,920
If you spend like a little bit on it, like it's enough for like a month or 2 months, you know what I mean?

109
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,660
Yeah.

110
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,060
Yeah.

111
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,280
It's... it's crazy.

112
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
So I only play...

113
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,820
Honkai now, but I play Genshin too before.

114
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,140
Wait, wait, wait.

115
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,320
How many characters do you have in Genshin then?

116
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,460
Don't ask.

117
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,640
I had like 3 accounts, dude.

118
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,020
I had like 3 accounts.

119
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,240
So...

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,460
They're both like... they're all from like the same company too, right?

121
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,400
Mi... Mihoyo?

122
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,380
Yeah, it's Mihoyo.

123
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,920
Oh my gosh.

125
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
They're... they have like... they have like the algorithm or like the...

126
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,680
The structure of it's set.

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,980
Yeah, I played... I played Honkai... like Honkai Impact 3rd.

128
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,560
That one.

129
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,140
Yeah.

130
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,360
Yeah, I played that one too.

131
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,880
That's why.

132
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,440
Oh wait, are you talking about Honkai Star Real?

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:40,820
Yeah.

134
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,580
Yeah, the one before that is like part of Honkai series.

135
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,600
Wait, what's the difference between Honkai Impact and Honkai Star Real?

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,200
Honkai Impact is waifu only basically.

137
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,680
Waifu only, yeah.

138
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,340
Yeah, it's basically waifu only.

139
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,120
Okay.

140
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,540
Oh, so Star Real has... has meh.

141
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,680
Yeah.

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,020
Yeah.

143
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:04,980
Yeah.

144
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,740
Yeah.

145
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,180
Yeah.

146
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,240
Yeah.

147
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,840
It's probably like the same universe though.

148
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,220
I see.

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,000
It's so...

150
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,220
I see.

151
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,700
But it's fun.

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,880
But I know... and like I heard like Star Real is sort of like similar to like Genshin, like the open world, right?

153
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,980
It... it... it's similar but like not similar at the same time.

154
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,920
It's like actually really not similar.

155
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,320
I think Genshin is... is...

156
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,500
Sorry to say, it's a little bit tiring because like you have to do everything manually.

157
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,200
Yeah.

158
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,280
But like in... in Star Real you can kind of like leave your phone there or leave it going and like you'll be...

159
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,060
Oh, so you can like...

160
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,360
Yeah, you can relax while... while looking at it.

161
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,720
I see.

162
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,340
You see, I... I don't know anything about like gacha games in general.

163
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,000
Because like for me, I'm also scared of getting addicted.

164
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,940
It is... it is addictive.

165
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,300
It is...

166
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,300
it is addictive.

167
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,420
Honestly, it is really addictive.

168
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:09,140
I try not to play any gacha game because like I'm scared of getting addicted and I'm scared when I get addicted that I'm gonna spend money.

169
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,900
Yeah.

170
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,740
Because...

171
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,340
I think that's the problem everybody has with like gacha games.

172
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,060
Like damn, that... that woman is so hot that...

173
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,820
Like I must have...

174
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,800
You know, it's like wow.

175
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,760
Yeah, because I already spend money on Fortnite skins and like it... it's... it's a problem.

176
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,540
Yeah.

177
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,460
I'm only...

178
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,300
Fortnite skins?

179
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,780
Yes, Fortnite skins.

180
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,440
Dang, because it's funny.

181
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,780
Like Peter Griffin... like I have Peter Griffin, John Cena, Dragon Ball Z.

182
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,820
What?

183
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,040
I have the like emo dance on it.

184
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,060
I have Ganon style.

185
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:44,680
Fortnite.

186
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,220
Really?

187
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,380
Because it's funny.

188
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,200
I haven't touched Fortnite like once ever and I was like...

189
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,100
To be fair, I don't... I don't like buy the skins to play with it.

190
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,120
I buy the skins like just because I think it's funny.

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,220
Like I don't even play Fortnite.

192
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,680
You don't play?

193
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,320
You don't play Fortnite skins?

194
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,440
I only play... I only play on stream.

195
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,400
I only play...

196
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,780
Wait.

197
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,180
I only play...

198
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,780
But it's funny.

199
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,840
You do...

200
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,100
It's like how you see like...

201
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,340
You see the pretty characters and you're like, oh, they're so pretty.

202
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:18,960
True.

203
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,280
You know what?

204
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,160
I can't judge you.

205
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,100
I see the funny Fortnite skin.

206
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,580
I'm like, oh, it's so funny.

207
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,380
Well, yeah.

208
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,760
I get it.

209
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,500
Well, yeah.

210
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,840
I get it.

211
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,320
You know what?

212
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,020
I can't judge you because...

213
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,340
Yeah.

214
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,040
Financial choices, you know?

215
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,540
Yeah.

216
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,100
Because you don't play gacha games so you can...

217
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,160
You can like buy all the skins you want.

218
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,200
Yeah, exactly.

219
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,200
I save my money by not playing gacha games.

220
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,080
And instead, I spend that money I save from gacha games to play Fortnite...

221
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,100
To buy Fortnite skins.

222
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,580
I...

223
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,600
To buy Fortnite skins?

224
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,520
I don't know which is the lesser evil.

225
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,200
Honestly.

226
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,740
Okay.

227
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,880
Yeah.

228
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,120
Okay.

229
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,380
I can't...

230
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,560
I can't...

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Yeah, we don't know what's the lesser evil, but we both spend money irresponsibly.

232
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,160
It's true.

233
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
But you know what?

234
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
Waifu for life, right?

235
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,380
I haven't heard that in like years, honestly.

236
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,620
Until like in 10 years, the game gets shut down for Genshin Impact.

237
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,240
No!

238
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,200
For the sequel of Genshin Impact.

239
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,740
No!

240
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,920
Dude, that's so sad.

241
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,040
Servers eventually...

242
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,540
I'm like, I'm like...

243
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,980
Eventually, your waifus... your waifus will disappear, you know?

244
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,220
Because the servers will get shut down.

245
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,960
That's what happens to like so many games.

246
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,900
That's why it's so scary.

247
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,840
That's why I don't do gacha too, because of the server.

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,880
I feel like servers tend to get shut down too for gacha games eventually.

249
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,780
And then all those waifus, all those digital waifus will be gone.

250
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,280
Because they're not real.

251
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,660
But the mihoyo is pretty good at keeping like...

252
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,220
That's true.

253
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,460
Mihoyo is...

254
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,100
I don't see like an end to it, you know?

255
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,980
You know what I mean?

256
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,480
Yeah, I feel like mihoyo is sort of like...

257
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,920
It's sort of like Riot, where it's like League-led legends will never die.

258
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,500
So I feel like...

259
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,600
Oh my god, Liga.

260
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,640
Yeah, League of Legends actually...

261
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,780
Never die.

262
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,440
I tried to learn how to play League.

263
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,360
I never learned how to play League.

264
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,980
So I was like learning how to play it.

265
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,620
And it's crazy.

266
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,340
It's like too many heroes in it.

267
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,760
And I'm like, dude, what does this guy do?

268
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,740
What are the combos?

269
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,200
I don't know.

270
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,860
I'm saying there's like a hundred heroes.

271
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,240
Yeah.

272
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,940
It's really difficult actually.

273
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,580
Honestly.

274
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,880
That's why I was like...

275
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,300
That's why I could never learn League.

276
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,920
And also because like it's so fucking toxic too.

277
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,680
So...

278
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,360
Yeah!

279
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,820
Yeah!

280
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,980
It's really toxic.

281
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,560
I heard like...

282
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:45,920
Like people...

283
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,880
Yeah, yeah, what were you gonna say?

284
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,100
No, you can go ahead.

285
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,920
No, okay.

286
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,960
I've seen toxicity.

287
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:58,080
I heard from my friends that the moderating team for League is so intense now.

288
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,920
That if you say anything toxic, they'll like ban you instantly.

289
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,600
So people got like super creative on how to be toxic to each other.

290
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,520
Wait, really?

291
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,400
Yeah, yeah.

292
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,840
They'll be like super passive aggressive.

293
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,420
Like you did a good job when they clearly didn't do a good job.

294
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,180
So just to get away from the...

295
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,080
Yeah, the sarcasm just comes in.

296
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,500
Yeah.

297
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,860
Just to get away from the filters and the bans.

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
They'll just be like...

299
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,000
It'll be like super passive aggressive.

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,400
Oh, yeah.

301
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,100
So it's like good job, smile.

302
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,500
It's just another level.

303
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,400
Oh, wait.

304
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,480
Is this what you meant when your mic was gonna cut off?

305
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,160
I see your mouth moving.

306
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,580
Oh, okay.

307
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,220
Guys.

308
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,240
Hiro's mic is...

309
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,680
Hiro's mic started cutting off.

310
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,540
Now she's just mute now.

311
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,420
Is this Chinese?

312
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,400
Sorry, I got carried away with speaking English.

313
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,240
Oh.

314
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,360
Whoa, are you okay?

315
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,300
You're back.

316
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:04,920
Welcome back.

317
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,380
Wait, never mind.

318
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,880
Okay, welcome back.

319
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,160
Never mind.

320
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
See my problem?

321
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,700
It's crazy.

322
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,820
This thing is like crazy.

323
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,650
Okay, I gotta...

324
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,680
Whoa, she's gotta...

325
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,760
We'll never know.

326
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,740
We'll never know.

327
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,660
She might have to be a PNG, guys.

328
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,700
Like her...

329
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,880
Apparently her PC fucking exploded.

330
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,420
I was like, what?

331
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,960
So like, goodbye.

332
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,000
She's gone.

333
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,400
It's like I could hear her voice suddenly.

334
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,180
This guy is always...

335
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,040
She's gonna be a PNG, guys.

336
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,600
Her PC is fighting with her.

337
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,540
See, I'm not the only one with PC issues.

338
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:55,900
Okay?

339
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,320
Guys, all VTubers have similar problems.

340
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,160
Okay?

341
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,340
I'm not...

342
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,820
I'm not the only one.

343
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,620
Am I back?

344
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,520
Oh, you're back.

345
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:05,960
You're back.

346
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,280
Yeah.

347
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,580
Oh, God.

348
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,220
Yeah, that's scary.

349
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,660
It's so scary.

350
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,720
You just suddenly stopped talking.

351
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,360
I was like...

352
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,820
You know, like, it's only when I screen share.

353
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,280
It's so annoying.

354
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:17,840
That's so weird.

355
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,060
Yeah.

356
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Like, Discord should screen share.

357
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,480
Like, anything else.

358
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,900
Like, it's all fine.

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,300
Like, everything is all fine.

360
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,520
Yeah.

361
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,480
Except screen share.

362
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,220
It's so annoying.

363
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,380
That's so weird.

364
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,940
Like, all my USB, you know, my keyboard, my mouse, my...

365
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,640
Like, everything else just...

366
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,100
My mic.

367
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,540
Yeah.

368
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:34,900
Yeah.

369
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,860
Just stops working, right?

370
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,060
Yeah.

371
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,160
Yeah.

372
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,420
Yeah.

373
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:38,640
Yeah.

374
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:38,780
Yeah.

375
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,680
You sent me a PNG.

376
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:41,700
Yeah.

377
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,520
That I can put on the screen.

378
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,120
Yeah.

379
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,460
Yeah.

380
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:44,560
Yeah.

381
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:44,740
Okay.

382
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:44,920
Yeah.

383
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,420
All right, guys.

384
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,700
Sorry.

385
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,640
She...

386
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,440
We're just waiting until the PNG comes back.

387
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
What were you going to say about League, Yido?

388
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,540
League?

389
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,320
Yeah.

390
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,440
Well, League, I actually am going...

391
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,640
I think there's like competitions.

392
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,820
Like, I think there's a big competition soon or something.

393
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,480
I'm going to be like doing a watch along for League or something.

394
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, yeah.

395
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,800
On PDPD and League.

396
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,780
Is it like an eSport or...

397
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,540
Yeah.

398
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,140
It is the eSport tournament.

399
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,620
I'm not sure which one it is.

400
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,400
Because I don't follow League too much.

401
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,120
Apparently, it's like MSI.

402
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,400
I think so.

403
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm not sure.

404
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,820
But like, because of that too, I'm like, oh crap.

405
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,320
I really got to learn like...

406
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,440
You got to like know what's going on.

407
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,000
I kind of know what's going on.

408
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,260
It's just really difficult to like, you know...

409
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,640
Actually, Chinese is like not my mother language as well.

410
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,340
You know, right?

411
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah.

412
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,860
Wait, wait.

413
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,520
English, right?

414
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,460
Yeah.

416
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,240
How did you...

417
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,400
How did you get so good at Chinese?

418
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,880
I have to...

419
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,600
Actually, I used to stream like everyday in English and then like I converted...

420
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,980
As soon as I went on PDPD, I like just stream in Chinese everyday just to practice.

421
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,000
Just to practice, yeah.

422
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,520
Yeah.

423
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,220
I had...

424
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,980
I was like so scared because I can't read chat, you know?

425
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,340
I could only read chat in like English before.

426
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,900
Yeah.

427
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,620
So I was really like, oh crap.

428
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,600
I can't understand anything at all.

429
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,040
So I was like, okay.

430
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,160
I gotta learn Chinese just to read chat.

431
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,860
Oh my god.

432
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,440
You're like...

433
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,760
You're like so...

434
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,120
You have like the brain capacity for like language learning because you know like Japanese too, right?

435
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,440
Yeah.

436
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,660
You can speak Japanese sort of fluently.

437
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah.

438
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,640
I...

439
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,060
That's also like...

440
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,200
I learned it since like young as well.

441
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,180
Oh my god.

442
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,860
I used to learn like a lot like Japanese and Chinese.

443
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,240
That's insane.

444
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,240
Oh my gosh.

445
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,020
That's like...

446
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,040
Like...

447
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,780
Like language learning is like one of the hardest skills to have because like you actually need...

448
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,300
Like it's a part of your sector in your brain.

449
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,300
Like section in your brain for...

450
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,600
Like you speak it too, right?

451
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,340
Every day?

452
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:54,860
Okay.

453
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,560
That...

454
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,280
Good...

455
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,440
A good...

456
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,160
Good question.

457
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,140
Wait, don't shoot.

458
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,140
Don't shoot.

459
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,800
That's a good question.

460
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,760
Hold that.

461
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,640
Yeah.

462
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,020
I kind of want to...

463
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,620
I want to hear you speak Chinese actually.

464
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,580
I was kind of excited.

465
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:15,780
You want to hear me...

466
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,860
Oh, speak Chinese?

467
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,480
Okay.

468
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah.

469
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,440
All right.

470
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:18,860
Wait.

471
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,300
Okay.

472
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,960
I feel like...

473
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,040
Okay.

474
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,640
Oh my god.

475
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,700
It's been so long since I spoke like Mandarin as well.

476
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,540
Yeah.

477
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,200
I'm like...

478
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,280
Wow.

479
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,540
I've spoken Mandarin before to you like a long time ago.

480
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:36,880
Have you?

481
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,540
Yeah.

482
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,260
Wait.

483
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,600
I don't even remember that.

484
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,540
That's how long it was.

485
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,240
That was very...

486
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,540
I think it was really long ago.

487
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,840
I like how like you're not on the screen so it looks like I'm just talking to myself.

488
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,640
Like I'm talking to the voices in my head.

489
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,560
Yeah.

490
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm like trying to find like...

491
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,900
The voices in my head.

492
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,060
No, no, no.

493
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,900
I'm a ghost actually.

494
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,940
Oh my god.

495
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,040
You know what it's like to ghost in Chinese?

496
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,140
She's haunting me.

497
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,300
Why?

498
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,620
Why?

499
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,520
Yeah.

500
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:10,840
Yeah.

501
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,220
Play.

502
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:11,740
Yeah.

503
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:11,820
Go ahead.

504
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,040
Play.

505
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,560
Your Chinese is great.

506
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,180
What do you mean?

507
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,900
I said one word.

508
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,380
One word.

509
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,540
Oh my god.

510
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,840
You're a natural.

511
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,640
Wow.

512
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,380
Yeah.

513
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,400
Your Chinese is way...

514
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,660
Yeah.

515
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,480
Better than me.

516
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Of course.

517
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,620
That's not true.

518
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,400
I can't even read or write.

519
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,420
I stopped learning Chinese.

520
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,220
Like I stopped like having like teachers for Chinese since like third grade.

521
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,000
Wow.

522
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah.

523
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,520
Because I'm like...

524
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
Okay, that's a long time ago.

525
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,920
Exactly!

526
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,040
Because my parents were like...

527
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,380
I think like... oh yeah, because like...

528
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,980
I moved out of Canada.

529
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,960
And I moved to Asia.

530
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:00,300
And then like, we had a choice... I had a choice between like... oh, like learn Chinese or learn French.

531
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,800
And then my parents were like, you're Canadian.

532
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,420
You should learn French.

533
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,720
And we'll talk to you in Chinese.

534
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,100
So you can get double... Did you learn French too?

535
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,420
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,100
I learned French until like, I graduated high school.

537
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,440
So like, they're like, you have to learn... you should learn French.

538
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,540
We will talk to you in Chinese.

539
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,900
So that's gonna be how you're learning it.

540
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,640
I was like, okay.

541
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,280
So I never learned how to...

542
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:35,260
I never learned... like the only thing I know how to read and like write are like, you know, like the basics for like Chinese.

543
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,240
Like like cat, dog, like...

544
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,560
Mom, Dad...

545
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,460
Like, I know how to write... horse...

546
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,060
Like your spoken Chinese is like way better, isn't it?

547
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,860
Well, like it's cause like... okay, you know how like... okay, cause like I lived in...

548
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,080
I lived in like China as well.

549
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,800
So like, I don't know, like you know uh, like the shows there.

550
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,400
So I would just like watch random shows that would pop up on TV.

551
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,380
And then like I had nothing to do.

552
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,540
So like I would I would just like watch the shows.

553
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,960
So like, you know when you listen to a lot of shows, then you can sort of like understand.

554
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,140
Actually, yeah, that's a lot of like how I learn and stuff.

555
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,580
Yeah, yeah.

556
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,060
I like to watch stuff, watch videos.

557
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,020
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,440
So like, you know, there's nothing else playing on TV.

559
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,660
So I just like, like I'll just really be watching random TV shows and then I just slowly build up like speaking wise.

560
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,940
But then I still have like... like um...

561
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,340
I had like... I don't... I never really liked speaking Chinese.

562
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,460
Like um... in high school.

563
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:41,960
Oh, Cantonese!

564
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,240
Yeah, I could speak like Mandarin and Cantonese.

565
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,020
Like more so Cantonese because I speak Cantonese at home.

566
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:56,180
But like I... like at high school I didn't like speaking Cantonese like out loud because like my friends would make fun of me.

567
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,400
Because I have an English accent.

568
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,500
Because I have an English accent.

569
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,080
Because like you know in Chinese there's different tones.

570
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,160
And it's like very strict.

571
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,840
Like the tonation.

572
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,000
It's very... yeah.

573
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,760
It's extremely strict.

574
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,640
Yeah, yeah.

575
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,640
So like...

576
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,380
I didn't care about that.

577
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,240
So you know I'd be like speaking...

578
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,320
like if I had a question I'll speak in the English tone for questions.

579
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,240
And stuff.

580
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,740
So I don't like follow the... I don't follow the um... Yeah.

581
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,840
I actually have that problem a lot too.

582
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,160
Like I try and fix it as much as I can.

583
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,820
But like...

584
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,780
Because we speak in English so often.

585
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,220
So it's like... yeah.

586
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,480
This fluctuation isn't it?

587
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:38,820
Yeah.

588
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,360
Yeah.

589
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,120
Yeah that's like a problem for me too.

590
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,060
Even though like...

591
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,400
Yeah and then like my chat will make fun of me.

592
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,180
Yeah.

593
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,520
Yeah.

594
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,860
So like that's why I was like...

595
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,440
So then like I wouldn't speak...

596
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,960
I rarely speak um...

597
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,700
like Chinese in public.

598
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,020
Like with my friends.

599
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,060
Because like they would just keep making fun of me.

600
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
They're like say it again!

601
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,040
Say it again!

602
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,260
And I'll be like... No.

603
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
I'll be like... No!

604
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,220
You just cannot make fun of me!

605
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,720
But it's actually really cute!

606
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,600
Wait you...

607
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,580
You heard me say one word.

608
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,480
What do you mean?

609
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:17,880
Yeah!

610
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,440
Okay okay.

611
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,660
Okay well let's try to have a conversation.

612
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,340
You start.

613
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,200
You go first.

614
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,000
Okay.

615
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,460
And then see if I can understand it.

616
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,000
I think you can.

617
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,480
Like what am I gonna talk about?

618
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,080
Oh.

619
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,460
Wait.

620
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,060
Ni hao.

621
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,220
Ni hao.

622
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,080
Yeah.

623
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,500
Today's weather is really nice.

624
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:37,860
Isn't it?

625
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,380
Did she just ask you how the weather's really nice?

626
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh.

627
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,200
Yeah.

628
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,200
Classic conversation.

629
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,440
Wow.

630
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,480
Today's weather is really nice.

631
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:58,980
Wait.

632
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,480
Oh my god.

633
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:00,760
Okay.

634
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,220
Usually you only speak in English right?

635
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,620
Usually.

636
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,420
Yeah.

637
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,360
Well like to my parents I speak in Cantonese.

638
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:09,900
Cantonese.

639
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,440
I want to hear you speak Cantonese.

640
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:12,960
I'm so...

641
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,060
Wait.

642
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,000
Do you understand Cantonese?

643
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,200
So okay.

644
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,320
So I actually did not understand Cantonese for a long time.

645
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,160
Then I learned a little bit from like videos and also being on Vidi Vidi.

646
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,140
And also I stay... Do you know where I live right now?

647
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm like not... Wait.

648
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,220
Where do you live?

649
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,400
Okay.

650
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,160
So I'm actually I'm like Japanese but I stay in Malaysia.

651
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:34,980
Oh.

652
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,260
Wait.

653
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,100
That's so interesting.

654
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,360
Wait.

655
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,260
Do you know Malaysian then?

656
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,100
The local language?

657
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,680
Yeah.

658
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,440
A little bit.

659
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:42,980
Oh.

660
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,460
That's so interesting.

661
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,460
Wait.

662
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,780
So you're like super multilingual then.

663
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,220
Yeah.

664
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,220
Yeah.

665
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,300
I can kind of speak like...

666
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,000
How do I say?

667
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,960
Like people here mix your like languages really often.

668
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,520
Yeah.

669
00:23:59,520 --> 00:23:59,880
Yeah.

670
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,160
Yeah.

671
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,140
So they'll mix English with Canto and stuff like that.

672
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,960
Yeah.

673
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,700
Yeah.

674
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,120
Yeah.

675
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,420
So that's why I hear like a lot of things every day.

676
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,380
So I'm like okay.

677
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,760
I can kind of understand what everybody is saying.

678
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,900
That's similar to me because I learned Cantonese first.

679
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:25,620
And then but like my extended family mostly speaks like on my dad's side mostly speaks like Mandarin.

680
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,100
And then like when I was like growing up I stayed with my grandpa for a bit as well.

681
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,080
And my grandpa only speaks like Mandarin but he could like understand Cantonese and stuff.

682
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,420
So then he'll like talk to me in Mandarin.

683
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,280
That's how I like learned like Mandarin.

684
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,940
Because like people just like talk to me in that in Mandarin instead of Cantonese.

685
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,280
And then your spoken is so good and when you try and like read and write it's like crap.

686
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,340
Oh yeah.

687
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,520
Like I can't read or write so...

688
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,700
Before I would like... I remember when I first did like a I try to speak Chinese stream.

689
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,520
And then people were like typing to me in Chinese.

690
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,100
Really?

691
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,860
You did?

692
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,460
I tried to speak Chinese stream.

693
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Yeah, yeah.

694
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,780
I did like for like a solo.

695
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,840
And then people were like typing to me in Chinese.

696
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,800
I was like I'm sorry I cannot read this.

697
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,440
Like you guys have to type to me in English.

698
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,040
You wanna try again today?

699
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,880
Well you can read it.

700
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,060
You can read it for me.

701
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,820
Yeah.

702
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,380
I can barely read English let alone...

703
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,280
Like I can barely read English let alone Chinese.

704
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,240
I can.

705
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,260
I can.

706
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,080
I can.

707
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,460
I can.

708
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,620
I can.

709
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,520
I can.

710
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,580
Is that all you can say?

711
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,260
What are you talking about?

712
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,300
I can't.

713
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,780
We're gonna be like little kids today.

714
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,140
Yeah honestly I can read actually okay.

715
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,800
拿豆皮本中文 And then I can't read after that.

716
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,500
Someone in my chat was like 拿豆皮本中文 And then I don't know what else.

717
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,620
My traditional Chinese is crap.

718
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,260
Oh yeah, yeah.

719
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,420
I know like traditional and simplified.

720
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,160
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,400
I think in Malaysia they use simplified as well.

722
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,240
So my traditional is really bad.

723
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,640
Like I'm trying to read it and I'm like crap.

724
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,780
It's easier to learn traditional.

725
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,760
I mean traditional is like really difficult.

726
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,480
Cause like that's why I simplify.

727
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,240
Yeah!

728
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:33,580
But like when you know traditional you can tell what is the simplified version because you know you're like wait that sort of looks like the traditional version.

729
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,140
And I learned traditional in Canada.

730
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,700
I learned traditional.

731
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:57,400
So like and then I remember like I remember oh wait no I did like when I like moved overseas I remember like I had one I think like I had like one lesson in like simplified and then I was like I was writing like write the sentence.

732
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,680
So then I wrote it in like traditional and they were like what is this?

733
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,460
And I was like I was like this is me.

734
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,460
This is traditional.

735
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,700
This is me.

736
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,240
But traditional is very it's like much harder that's why I like to simplify.

737
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,800
Cause there's more strokes in it.

738
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,240
You know how I learned like when I went to Bilibidi at first I learned using Duolingo as well.

739
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,540
So I was like ah.

740
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:30,800
Wait is it like Duolingo is not like a good like learning like not like a good like main learning tool type deal.

741
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,040
I was like very confused on where to learn.

742
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,840
I was like okay you know what I'm gonna open Duolingo and learn it there.

743
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:50,100
I think like Chinese is like one of the hardest languages to learn because of how many intonations and like characters there are for like writing and reading as well.

744
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,920
I feel like.

745
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,260
Yeah.

746
00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:01,120
I just cause like I just I don't know like Cantonese has like more intonation like more tones than like Mandarin.

747
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,840
I don't remember it was like 8 or something.

748
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,800
Oh yeah.

749
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,560
There's like a lot of Chinese dialects I think.

750
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,540
Like I don't know how many there are.

751
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,660
Do you know the Chinese tongue twister?

752
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,000
Which one?

753
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:25,280
The one with like one character like one uh what was it one like it sounds like the same but it means different things.

754
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,440
God what one was that one?

755
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,240
Oh the Shi Shi Shi.

756
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:50,980
Eww that one I I hate it like I don't know but like when I first learned Chinese I think like people love to hear like new beginners making mistakes or something and and they forced me to read all those tongue twisters and like I was going crazy.

757
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,000
I was like.

758
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,440
I was like.

759
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,080
What?

760
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,640
What?

761
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,080
Shi Shi Shi Shi Shi Shi?

762
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,840
I'm like no I can't read this.

763
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,260
No!

764
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,100
Try it.

765
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,580
Try one.

766
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,400
Try one of them.

767
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,440
What?

768
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,240
Let me see.

769
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,420
Is there any like easy tongue twister?

770
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,800
If it's a tongue twister it's not meant to be easy.

771
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,980
There's one about milk as well.

772
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,920
A milk?

773
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,400
What's the milk one called?

774
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,000
Like Nai Nai something like that.

775
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,580
Nai Nai.

776
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
I don't remember.

777
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,960
Like there's a lot of tongue twisters.

778
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,000
It's too difficult I think.

779
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,060
Maybe you can try.

780
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:34,720
You know what?

781
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,280
I can't even read.

782
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,200
What do you mean?

783
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,000
I can't even read.

784
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,260
I can't even read.

785
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,200
How do I do tongue twisters if I can't even read?

786
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,660
I can't even read.

787
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,080
It's so difficult honestly.

788
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,700
Tongue twisters I think in any language is difficult.

789
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,280
That's true.

790
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,940
English ones are pretty difficult.

791
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,660
There's some really difficult ones as well.

792
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,980
I think like the Chinese ones are more so like the whole fact that it sounds the same.

793
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,440
It all sounds very similar.

794
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,200
But it's all different meaning.

795
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,860
You gotta know what the tone is and all that.

796
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,700
It's like basically it's testing your tonation reading type deal.

797
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,060
There's so much.

798
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,960
Stop avoiding the Chinese tongue twister.

799
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,480
Yeah Hiro.

800
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,720
Stop avoiding it.

801
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,440
I've gone through like torture doing those tongue twisters.

802
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,260
Like every single time I do a collab with like...

803
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,640
Oh Hiro, we'll teach you Chinese today.

804
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,580
And then they always give me a tongue twister.

805
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,400
I can't take it.

806
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,320
And I'm like Hiro teach me Chinese.

807
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,840
I was like Hiro teach me Chinese.

808
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,820
Anyway do a tongue twister too.

809
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,060
Yeah.

810
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,600
Well okay.

811
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,640
So wait.

812
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,620
Actually teach you something today.

813
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,660
Like useful things.

814
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,140
Like you want to learn like slang or something?

815
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,840
Yeah yeah yeah.

816
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,840
Teach me some modern slang.

817
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,420
But you might know the slang if you talk to your parents right?

818
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,220
Oh no I don't.

819
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,160
Like I don't progress.

820
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,960
What?

821
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,220
I don't progress.

822
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,200
I'm like stuck in this time chamber of the Chinese I've known.

823
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:19,620
Honestly.

824
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,820
Like I never learn anything new.

825
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,020
Just asking.

826
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,040
Do you want to learn curse words or do you know all the curse words already?

827
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:38,880
I feel like I know a lot of the curse words already because like you know like when your parents are driving the car and they start yelling start yelling at the drivers in the car.

828
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,900
What?

829
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,300
Wow.

830
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,380
What did they yell?

831
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,460
I'm so interested.

832
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,440
I don't know.

833
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,500
I don't know.

834
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,280
My mom watches my stream.

835
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,900
Wait really?

836
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,720
But I learn...

837
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,340
Wait wait.

838
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,180
Your mom watches your stream?

839
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,760
Oh okay.

840
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,660
But it's okay right?

841
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,820
Like you learn it from your parents.

842
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,520
Yeah that's true.

843
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,020
That's true.

844
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,660
Yeah.

845
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,440
Yeah.

846
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,400
You can tell me one I'll tell you one.

847
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:25,080
I think the easiest one is like I think everybody knows is like the Chao Ni Ma.

848
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,960
Chao Ni Ma.

849
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,500
Oh no.

850
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,840
Yeah.

851
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,180
It's like and then I know okay this one I've heard of that one.

852
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,300
Yes I've heard of that one.

853
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,500
What?

854
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,600
Well the most tame one is the most tame one is Ba Po which is like bitch.

855
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,380
So...

856
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,300
Well yeah that's pretty tame.

857
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,420
Yeah it's pretty tame.

858
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,600
There's a lot of things I could say but Ba Po is the tame one.

859
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,940
They love to curse.

860
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,520
I would say actually Chinese there's a lot of like different ways you can curse somebody.

861
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,320
Oh yeah.

862
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:20,820
Yeah like I know like when I was growing up my mom would be like So it's like having a having a pork bun is better than having you.

863
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,160
What?

864
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,800
Wait really?

865
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,660

868
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,180
Really?

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,940
Yes it's a very common It's a very common like Cantonese thing to say.

870
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,420
San ta su ho go san lei.

871
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:46,760
San ta su ho go san lei.

872
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,940
Do you...

873
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,640

874
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,300
It's pretty tame.

875
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,260
It's tame though.

876
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,840
There's a lot of cursors that have like abbreviations too do you know?

877
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,920

Oh yeah yeah.

881
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:23,840
I actually don't know a lot of the short form stuff cause like I don't know a lot of like the Chinese stuff for like on the internet type deal like internet slang in Chinese.

882
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,760
Like I think like a lot of it was Internet slang.

883
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,160
Yeah.

884
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:41,420
Yeah a lot of it is like English like like stuff like that in English like cause like I know a lot of the Chinese I learned is also like from movies too.

885
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:51,920
So like you know like the slang from in movies and stuff but like it's also old movies like Okay I got it.

886
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:59,960
I don't know like his name in Mandarin but like you know like Zhao Shengqi like Steven Chow and that's his name.

887
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

888
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,540
Yeah yeah yeah.

889
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:07,040

True.

898
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,600
He has good movies.

899
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:33,600
True.

Oh yeah yeah.

905
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:12,300
So they love to like put all those short forms out on the internet and usually you won't understand because it looks like you know like gibberish basically.

906
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,840
Oh Yeah.

907
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,760
But it looks like gibberish?

908
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,760
I mean you won't understand if you don't know Chinese you won't understand at all.

909
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,540
I don't know until I see it.

910
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,320
Yeah but there's like cute ones too.

911
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,560

I read the original book.

1174
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,360
I was like way too young to read that book by the way.

1175
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,700
Because it was like...

1176
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,900
It's like... It's like two copies and they're like extra thick too.

1177
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:57,840
So...

1178
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,380
Because I love the games.

1179
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,840
Like the Three Kingdoms... The Dynasty Warrior games.

1180
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,160
And through Dynasty Warriors I start... I really liked the stories behind it.

1181
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,860
So then I read the books as well.

1182
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,260
And then I visited the temples.

1183
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,080

1184
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:16,420

1185
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,580
Yeah so like I actually went to see like Lu Bei and Zhuge Liang temple.

1186
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,140
Crazy.

1187
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,140
And...

1188
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,420
Yeah.

1189
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,120
I heard like Cao Cao temple was recently discovered too.

1190
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,800
And like...

1191
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,640
Yeah they have a museum.

1192
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,740
I really want to go there.

1193
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,200
It was like recently discovered.

1194
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:41,900
Because like Cao Cao I don't even know about like the history behind it but like Cao Cao's like temple slash like like... like...

1195
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,080
grave was like super hidden and stuff.

1196
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,940
So he has like... he has like fake graves.

1197
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,780
So people won't like rob it.

1198
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,320
And like recently... Wow.

1199
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,500
They recently discovered like his actual like tomb.

1200
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:57,920
And...

1201
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,640
And people... but like people were like no that can't be his.

1202
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,580
That has to be his son.

1203
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,300
But people were like no this has to be like Cao Cao's tomb.

1204
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,260
Because...

1205
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,700
And then so they made like a whole museum based off of it that recently opened.

1206
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,940
I think like two years ago or last year.

1207
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,060
Wow.

1208
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,300
I didn't know that.

1209
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:15,800
Honestly.

1210
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,980
I'm like wow.

1211
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:17,500
Really?

1212
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,120
I never knew that.

1213
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:19,560
Yeah.

1214
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,220
Because I just like watched the...

1215
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,460
the...

1216
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,260
TV version basically.

1217
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:25,980
Oh there's so many.

1218
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,840
Which one did you watch?

1219
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,220
I'm like crap.

1220
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:30,780
I can't remember.

1221
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,260
Because it was like two, three years ago too already.

1222
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,400
I think at this point.

1223
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,920
Um... It's just all the old ones.

1224
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,240
Basically the OG ones.

1225
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,000
The OG ones.

1226
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,240
I remember it when... Okay do you see the Red Cliff movie?

1227
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,640
Have you ever watched the Red Cliff movie?

1228
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,040
It's like... It's like... I watched that at the theaters in China.

1229
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,560
Wait.

1230
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,300
Isn't it theater?

1231
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,020
Yeah.

1232
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,360
It's not old.

1233
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,740
I'm not... That movie came out not that long.

1234
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,720
Okay it came out maybe like ten years ago.

1235
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,360
But...

1236
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,520
But it's not that... It's not that old.

1237
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,960
I haven't even seen that.

1238
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,120
I've watched...

1239
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,640
I've actually seen that in theaters.

1240
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,200
I think like in the first week it came out.

1241
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,980
Because like also it's because like the actor that played Ju Geok-leon.

1242
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,200
He's like apparently like back then he was like super famous.

1243
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,660
And then like my grandma like had a crush on that actor.

1244
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,800
So like my grandma like bought like...

1245
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:48,800
My grandma bought me and her and like I think like my dad like VIP seats to like watch the...

1246
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,060
Watch the movie.

1247
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,960
During like opening.

1248
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:54,460
Wow!

1249
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,960
Yeah.

1250
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,200
That's actually really interesting.

1251
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,840
Like I...

1252
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:08,920
I don't think like my grandparents I don't think they were ever like like watching that many movies actually.

1253
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,220
So I never really went to theater like to buy seats or anything.

1254
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,840
Have you ever been in a theater in China?

1255
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,080
Like a movie theater in China?

1256
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:18,660
No.

1257
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,580
Oh my gosh.

1258
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,520
I've only gone to China once so far.

1259
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,340
Oh my gosh.

1260
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,400
It's actually... Wait when did you go to China?

1261
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,940
Like when was the last time you went to China?

1262
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:27,280
Recently.

1263
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,060
Actually I went...

1264
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,900

1265
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,040
Oh yeah what did you do?

1266
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:34,940
Wait where did you go?

1267
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,120

1268
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,560
Shanghai.

1269
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:38,840
Shanghai.

1270
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,860
Oh Shanghai.

1271
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,500
It's nice.

1272
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,580
Yeah I did a 3D I did a 3D live that's why.

1273
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,180
Yeah so you went to Shanghai for your 3D?

1274
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,920
Yeah I went to their studio.

1275
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,560
That's so cool.

1276
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,540
Yeah I went to visit the Bidibidi HQ.

1277
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:55,560
Oh.

1278
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,620
Oh my gosh.

1279
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,500
What's it like?

1280
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:58,900
It's actually really cool.

1281
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:14,520
It's actually much nicer like I was kind of scared because you know my mother language is also English and I was like okay my Chinese is like kind of you know you know like okay.

1282
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Like hmmm.

1283
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,500
I was like kind of scared going there but like it was actually really nice like it was really interesting.

1284
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,360
Oh.

1285
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,020
That's really cool though.

1286
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:25,960
You get to see their headquarters.

1287
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,420
It's pretty English friendly so I was like okay.

1288
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,200
Thank God.

1289
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,560
It's like if I don't understand they'll speak English.

1290
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,460
That's really sweet.

1291
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,400
But like have you ever been to like a theatre in China right?

1292
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,100
Like a movie theatre?

1293
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,300
No I've not gone to a theatre.

1294
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:51,620
It's actually really nice cause like I think like the seats are I think like back then when I went to the movie theatre like back then in N.A.

1295
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,040
you don't have like seats reservations in N.A.

1296
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,200
So it's like in N.A.

1297
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,160
when you wanna go to a movie theatre.

1298
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:05,620
I think now people can reserve seats but back then like when I was a lot younger it was like a battle royale for like getting I'm getting good seats.

1299
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:06,660
Really?

1300
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:14,420
Yeah, it was like you have to get there early if you want to have good seats.

1301
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,460
It's like a free-for-all.

1302
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:20,640
So people would have to actually get to the theaters early just to watch it.

1303
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:28,380
If it was a really good movie and people really want to watch it, if you don't get there early, you have to sit at the very front or something.

1304
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,360
But I don't know now.

1305
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,960
Honestly, I haven't been to a movie theater for a long time.

1306
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,100
Anyway, I remember when I started to live in Asia and in China too.

1307
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,620
When I first came to the theater, I was like, oh my god, you get to reserve seats?

1308
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:52,080
You mean I don't have to come to the theater 30 minutes early just to sit in a good spot?

1309
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,800
I'm getting convinced you're becoming like grandma.

1310
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,740
That's so true!

1311
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:02,780
I'm seeing it.

1312
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,220
I'm like, wait, really?

1313
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,960
What you're saying is, I'm like, wait, really?

1314
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,340
No, it's true!

1315
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:19,420
Look, I came from a place where there was a battle royale for movie seats.

1316
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,160
There's some straddle.

1317
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,800
But then also, I think now they have buttered popcorn.

1318
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,900
But I remember popcorn back then was only caramel popcorn back then.

1319
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,160
But I don't know.

1320
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:32,860
I don't know what that means.

1321
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:32,940
I don't know.

1322
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,520
All the parents and grandmas and grandpas say they were like...

1323
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,940
Even when they go anywhere, they always say it's like they went on like a journey.

1324
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,360
It's so difficult to do anything.

1325
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,120
Yeah!

1326
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,220
Even going to the movie theater is like, whoa.

1327
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,600
It's a VR.

1328
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:52,440
That's true.

1329
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:52,820
That's true.

1330
00:52:54,180 --> 00:53:00,140
But I remember there's like the VIP movie theaters too.

1331
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:08,240
Where, like, Oh my gosh, where there's only like 15 seats or whatever, like 15 chairs.

1332
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,340
And they're all like recliners.

1333
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,720
This is... it's true!

1334
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,440
I went to like... my grandma was like... loves movies.

1335
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,040
And then like... and then because like I was like...

1336
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,840
So like in Chinese culture, like I was like the...

1337
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:32,320
The first born grandchild with like the... the last name.

1338
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,100
Because I wasn't the first born grandchild technically.

1339
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,260
Because I had like cousins older than me.

1340
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,940
But I was the first one that came from... that has like...

1341
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:47,460
My last name was like basically like the last name of my grandparents.

1342
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:52,420
So like... so then they... like they were like, okay, we have VIP movie tickets.

1343
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,480
We take doki to the...

1344
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,300
So I get to like... I get to like...

1345
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,740
So I was like considered like the favorite child.

1346
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,320
The favorite grandchild.

1347
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,600
Because of it.

1348
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,420
The favorite what?

1349
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,120
Yeah.

1350
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,520
Favorite child?

1351
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,300
The... the favorite grandchild.

1352
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,080
And the first born perks.

1353
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:21,100
And then... and then so like I got to do like the...

1354
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,540
I got to... I got to do like...

1355
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,320
The VIP movie theaters.

1356
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,420
And it was crazy because like...

1357
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,720
First off like the chairs are recliners.

1358
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,480
And then... and then like...

1359
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,840
And then like you don't have to go to the...

1360
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,760
You don't have to go to like... to outside to order the food.

1361
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,120
You can just order like...

1362
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,340
There's like movie theater tenants that come to you and be like, what do you...

1363
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,320
It's like a flight attendant.

1364
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,620
They'll be like, what do you want to eat?

1365
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,880
And then they'll be like, okay, I'll have this and that.

1366
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,800
And they'll like go... and then they'll like make it and they'll bring it to you.

1367
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,320
And...

1368
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,560
Yeah, back then this is like...

1369
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,000
This is like crazy already.

1370
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,900
Like and then like a lot of like...

1371
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,940
And it's not like...

1372
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:07,040
A lot of like the bigger movie theaters had like a VIP section too.

1373
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,540
But it was like...

1374
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,840
So yeah, I watched the Red Cliff on the VIP movie theaters.

1375
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,100
Are you flexing?

1376
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,760
Like... I'm like listening.

1377
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,760
Favorite grandchild.

1378
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:21,940
VIPC.

1379
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,380
The Red Cliff was a good movie!

1380
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,780
It was so good!

1381
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,100
It deserved to be in the VIP section.

1382
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,780
I wish I was the favorite grandchild.

1383
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,560
It was nice.

1384
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,800
And then like...

1385
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,920
And then I like...

1386
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,760
And I remember I went back to Canada and then at the movie theaters was still...

1387
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,580
Still the Battle Royale.

1388
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,600
Now tell that story in Chinese.

1389
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,900
Okay, then...

1390
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,500
I was young back then.

1391
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,160
I...

1392
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,440
That's Cantonese!

1393
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,360
Okay, my Cantonese is...

1394
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,300
I can listen.

1395
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,400
I can understand.

1396
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,340
But like...

1397
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,320
I can't speak at all, I think.

1398
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,640
I can only listen a little bit.

1399
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:06,740
Wait, wait, wait.

1400
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,980
Say sentence in Cantonese.

1401
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,560
What is like...

1402
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,020
Do you know a sentence in Cantonese?

1403
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,220
I just said I can't speak it at all.

1404
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,060
You did, but you said you know a little bit.

1405
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,260
You said you know a little bit.

1406
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,040
I can listen.

1407
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:16,620
Yeah.

1408
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,580
I only know memes, basically.

1409
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:20,420
Wait.

1410
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,380
Like what memes?

1411
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,700
I don't even know the memes.

1412
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:23,280
Uh...

1413
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,000
Uh...

1414
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,540
Uh...

1415
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,600

00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,120
Wait, what is that?

1417
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:31,220
Do you know that?

1418
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,820
No, I just know like...

1419
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,480
You don't know?

1420
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,740
No, what is that meme?

1421
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,800
There's like a video.

1422
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,860
I think it's on VidiVidi if I'm not mistaken.

1423
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,280
Yeah, it's like...

1424
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:40,760
It's like...

1425
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,720
It's 3pm.

1426
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,380
Like...

1427
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,000
Like...

1428
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,200
Just have some...

1429
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,320
Yeah, yeah.

1430
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,180
Have some time.

1431
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,420
Yeah!

1432
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,400
Like the only meme I know is the one more thing.

1433
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,180
It was like, when they reanimated some...

1434
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:56,120
I think it was like some Cantonese movie into a beaver.

1435
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,820
Like that's the only meme I know.

1436
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,440
You know that one?

1437
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,500
Wait, what is that?

1438
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,420
You don't know the beaver?

1439
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,740
The beaver video meme?

1440
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,000
Like somebody...

1441
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,700
It was like some super passionate speech in Cantonese.

1442
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,880
And then they like reanimated it into a beaver.

1443
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:12,800
Like...

1444
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,580
Like what?

1445
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,420
The dramatic beaver!

1446
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:18,320
You were?

1447
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,400
Yeah!

1448
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:19,600
Yeah!

1449
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,620
Wait, you don't... you never heard of that one?

1450
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,540
Send it to me.

1451
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,480
Wait, okay.

1452
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,400
I think it's because it got so...

1453
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,060
Like, was it in Cantonese or Mandarin?

1454
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:32,680
I don't remember.

1455
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,520
But I just remember it got so...

1456
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,440
Oh, it was in Cantonese?

1457
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:36,540
Sorry.

1458
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,080
Auntie Doki's memory is not as good as it used to be.

1459
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,400
Wait, then what was it in?

1460
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,660
It's because like... okay.

1461
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:58,860
It's because like... it was... that meme got so popular apparently that it transcended overseas.

1462
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,440
So like people overseas were like, what is this?

1463
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,440
They couldn't understand what he was saying.

1464
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,180
They were like, wait, this is pretty funny.

1465
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,680
But they didn't understand what the beaver was saying.

1466
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,920
So that's what I knew about.

1467
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,640
Just because like it went overseas.

1468
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,120
I'll show you.

1469
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,140
I kind of want to...

1470
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:17,180
Okay.

1471
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,040
Let me see if I can find...

1472
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,240
Let me see if I can find...

1473
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,580
Let me see if I can find Chinese beaver.

1474
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,000
Okay.

1475
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:28,660
Oh, yeah.

1476
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:28,840
See?

1477
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,040
It's the original Cantonese.

1478
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:30,760
I knew it.

1479
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,020
It's a better tomorrow.

1480
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:32,600
Is this Cantonese?

1481
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,140
Yeah, it was in Cantonese.

1482
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,200
I fucking knew it.

1483
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,560
I was like... I knew it because like I could understand most of what they were saying.

1484
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,800
It was this one.

1485
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,920
I've never seen this in my whole life.

1486
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,220
You've never seen that one?

1487
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,780
I've never seen it.

1488
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,120
Why does he have like a wound on his face?

1489
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,260
It's because it was like reanimated from the actual movie.

1490
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,380
It was like his persona or something.

1491
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:03,360
Like...

1492
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,040
Yeah, it got... it literally has 2.3 million views.

1493
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,360
Because people like overseas were like, what is this?

1494
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,680
People were like, wait, is this funny?

1495
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,040
I don't know what he's saying, but this is so funny.

1496
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:24,940
Like...

1497
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,040
Yeah, there's like subtitles so I can kind of get it.

1498
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,840
Yeah, so it's like... it's based off...

1499
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:29,880
Yeah.

1500
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,340
Wait, I'll show you the original clip.

1501
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,980
This is... it's based off...

1502
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:33,460
Yeah.

1503
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,800
This is the original clip.

1504
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,720
I've... I've never seen this.

1505
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,340
You've never seen this one?

1506
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,060
No, I've never seen this.

1507
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,400
Maybe it was like not that popular like in like the Chinese internet culture.

1508
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,880
Well, I... I was never...

1509
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,100
You know, I didn't know Chinese for like a long time.

1510
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,860
Yeah, but this was 3 months ago.

1511
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:52,720
Maybe you never looked at it.

1512
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,300
This is 3 months ago.

1513
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,320
3 months ago?

1514
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,220
Yeah, this is 3 months ago.

1515
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,040
I've never seen it.

1516
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,360
This is 3 months ago.

1517
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,940
Maybe it's just because like...

1518
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,640
This is not Grab-a-me.

1519
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,000
Maybe there's like different things...

1520
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,340
Maybe...

1521
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:04,520
Maybe...

1522
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,060
I don't know.

1523
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,820
Like I've never seen this.

1524
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,100
Guys, this is not a Grab-a-me.

1525
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,880
It's literally 3 months ago.

1526
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,220
This is from...a 1986 movie.

1527
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,040
Yes, but the meme was 3 months ago!

1528
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,940
That's not ancient!

1529
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,420
You sure?

1530
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,120
I...

1531
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,340
That's not ancient!

1532
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,060
The meme might be old, but the meme is young!

1533
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,160
The meme is young!

1534
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:31,540
Hm -mmm...

1535
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,540
The meme is young!

1536
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,080
Maybe the memes are made by all the aunties.

1537
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,320
No!

1538
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,100
All the grandmas and grandpas.

1539
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:41,220
No!

1540
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:41,780
I don't want to be naive.

1541
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,320
No!

1542
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,960
I don't want to.

1543
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,720
Take your 1986 movie and put it as a meme.

1544
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,660
I don't want to.

1545
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:58,000
I don't even know how to say young in Chinese.

1546
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,600
Young.

1547
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,540
Young.

1548
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,480
Young.

1549
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,300
I am young.

1550
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:04,880
God,

1551
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:10,880
I'm so scared.

1552
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,920
I'm like, okay, I pray to God.

1553
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,180
I'm saying the correct word.

1554
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,520
Because my pronunciation is crap.

1555
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,620
Sometimes I'm so scared.

1556
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,920
It's not as bad as me.

1557
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,560
Really?

1558
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,600
Of course, yeah.

1559
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,600
It's not as bad as me.

1560
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,540
Because you're actually practicing.

1561
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,700
Speaking Chinese too.

1562
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,360
I'm not.

1563
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,360
My pronunciation has deteriorated a lot over the years.

1564
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,960
Because I'm mostly speaking English now.

1565
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,200
Have you ever learned...

1566
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,360
You play Apex.

1567
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,220
I play Apex, right?

1568
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:46,540
Yeah.

1569
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:50,660
Have you ever learned the Apex characters' Chinese names?

1570
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,700
You taught me some of them.

1571
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,380
I remember you taught me...

1572
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:55,740
What was it?

1573
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,780
The Charger iPhone?

1574
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:58,700
Yeah.

1575
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:58,960
Zibong?

1576
01:01:59,360 --> 01:01:59,800
Yeah.

1577
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:00,420
Zibong.

1578
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,060
Yeah.

1579
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,140
You taught me.

1580
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,360
And I remember you taught me...

1581
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,120
You tried to teach me the other names.

1582
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,040
And then I forgot.

1583
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,220
The new character...

1584
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,260
I was telling you.

1585
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,240
I streamed 16 hours of YouTube.

1586
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:13,340
Yeah.

1587
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,220
The new character speaks Cantonese.

1588
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:16,520
Yeah.

1589
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:16,760
Yeah.

1590
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:16,940
No.

1591
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,480
Yeah.

1592
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,860
Because I didn't know that.

1593
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,280
And then she suddenly started...

1594
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,120
She was like, dun dun.

1595
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:21,860
And I was like...

1596
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:22,960
Yeah.

1597
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,240
She scared me.

1598
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,040
I was like...

1599
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,720
Wait.

1600
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,860
Was that Cantonese?

1601
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,460
I was like...

1602
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:27,760
She was like...

1603
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,180
Dun dun.

1604
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,000
And I was like...

1605
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,140
I was like...

1606
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,640
Wait.

1607
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,240
I understood her.

1608
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,840
She was like suddenly aware.

1609
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:38,880
And I was like...

1610
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,900
Oh my god.

1611
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,380
Wait.

1612
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,360
I know what she's saying.

1613
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:44,880
Yeah.

1614
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,780
I was so surprised.

1615
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:47,820
Actually, do you know...

1616
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,440
Actually, do you know...

1617
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:48,960
Conduit?

1618
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,620
Conduit's Chinese name is kind of like...

1619
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:55,440
The first time I learned it, everyone was telling me it was a bad word, by the way, in Chinese.

1620
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,140
Really?

1621
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:56,360
Really?

1622
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,960
I don't know if you understand.

1623
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,260
I call her Tao Guan.

1624
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,200
Tao Guan.

1625
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:05,500
Wait.

1626

Why is it a bad word?

1646
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:31,940

1812
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,480
Okay, to be honest.

1813
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,300
It was like a show that like...

1814
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,240
parents love to watch.

1815
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,960
And then I would watch it with them.

1816
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,620
It was like the parent show.

1817
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,600
Like every parent...

1818
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,660
Like every parent would watch it.

1819
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,460
Really?

1820
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,500
Yeah, no it's true.

1821
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,040
My child was like...

1822
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,380
Oh my god, my mom watches that show all the time.

1823
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,640
It was true.

1824
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,320
See, my dad loves that show.

1825
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,200
I think you're exposing your dick.

1826
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,060
I didn't watch it willingly.

1827
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,600
It was on tape.

1828
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:17,980
On TV.

1829
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,600
Okay, I did watch it willingly because I could choose not to watch it with my parents.

1830
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,960
But it was interesting.

1831
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:24,740
It was funny.

1832
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,900
Because sometimes it was like...

1833
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,700
Sometimes it was like...

1834
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,420
The guy would be like...

1835
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,280
Really not a good person.

1836
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:34,980
Really?

1837
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,880
He would be like...

1838
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,880
Like an extra deadbeat.

1839
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,560
But he would be on the show.

1840
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,980
And then you would see a panel of women...

1841
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,660
Just be like...

1842
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,540
Pressing the button.

1843
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,980
And then he would be like...

1844
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,620
And then you would see a panel of women...

1845
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:51,860
Just be like...

1846
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,540
Pressing the button.

1847
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,320
And then you would be like...

1848
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,300
All of them rejecting it.

1849
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,720
What is the show called?

1850
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:03,260
What is the show called?

1851
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,940
It was so popular.

1852
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,500
Yes, the host was a bald man.

1853
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,460
Yes, I remember the host.

1854
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,740
He's so famous.

1855
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,400
He's super fucking rich now.

1856
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,680
Because that show made him really famous.

1857
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,120
Because he was such a good host.

1858
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,340
Can you not read it?

1859
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,240
Somebody wrote it.

1860
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,680
What does that say?

1861
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,060
What is it?

1862
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:24,600
In my chat.

1863
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,520
I can't read it.

1864
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:26,620
I told you I can't read.

1865
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,120
I can't read this.

1866
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,440
I can't really...

1867
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,220
I can't really...

1868
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:34,580
I can't really...

1869
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,500
I can't really...

1870
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,020
I've never heard of that in my life.

1871
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,660
I've never heard of that in my life.

1872
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,720
You've never heard of that show?

1873
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,080
It's famous!

1874
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,260
Wait, what kind of Chinese shows do you know?

1875
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,720
That's not old.

1876
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,100
I don't know.

1877
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,700
I don't know Chinese shows that are old.

1878
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:59,000
Doesn't your chat recommend you some shows to watch?

1879
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,220
Doesn't your chat recommend you some shows to watch?

1880
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:01,960
Mostly...

1881
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,660
It's not really...

1882
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,240
How do I put it?

1883
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:08,400
It's mostly like the...

1884
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:09,620
It's mostly like the...

1885
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,240
They recommend the really old one.

1886
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,640
Wait, you can't call it old.

1887
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,020
You can't call me old.

1888
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,280
Your chat recommends these things to you.

1889
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,460
They're recommending me like classic...

1890
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,100
classical stuff, you know?

1891
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,600
Yeah, and I'm like...

1892
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,020
Watch the classical stuff.

1893
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,140
Because I'm cultured.

1894
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,040
You watch classical and like...

1895
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,120
And what?

1896
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,140
We never recommend you any like...

1897
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,760
I'm going to VIP theater.

1898
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,240
Okay.

1899
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,000
Look.

1900
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,300
It's classy.

1901
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:51,880
It's classy.

1902
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,480
Okay.

1903
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,720
Wait, what kind of shows does your chat recommend you?

1904
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,920
Wait, what kind of shows does your chat recommend you?

1905
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,760
Honestly...

1906
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,480
They don't recommend me...

1907
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,980
They recommend me some...

1908
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,700
But I don't really look for them...

1909
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,460
for recommendations or shows.

1910
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,580
Because it's more...

1911
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,740
You don't trust your chat.

1912
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:14,880
I...

1913
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,120
It's because...

1914
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,920
I mostly watch the ones...

1915
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,060
that they already recommend me.

1916
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,980
And it's only the classical ones.

1917
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,800
Because they don't really watch...

1918
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,060
TV shows, you know?

1919
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,320
Wait, what do they watch?

1920
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,100
They only watch...

1921
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,440
People nowadays, they watch...

1922
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,000
You know, they watch movies still.

1923
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,180
But most people just look at videos all the time.

1924
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:38,880
Oh, like...

1925
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,620
So it's just like...

1926
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,440
It's just like NA...

1927
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,360
where people don't watch shows anymore.

1928
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,480
They just watch streamers...

1929
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,520
and YouTube videos.

1930
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,260
Do you think...

1931
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,180
VTuber...

1932
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:54,940
Honestly, they watch more anime...

1933
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:55,260
I think.

1934
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,160
There's like...

1935
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:01,460
Chinese animation is really good now too.

1936
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,140
I heard.

1937
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:03,460
Yeah.

1938
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:03,900
Okay.

1939
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,120
There are some really good Chinese animations.

1940
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:07,600
But...

1941
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,320
Mostly everyone still watches them.

1942
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,560
I think it's because...

1943
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,920
VTuber is actually...

1944
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,740
Do you know...

1945
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,940
VTuber was like...

1946
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,320
Miku fans...

1947
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,560
At first...

1948
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,800
Everyone is...

1949
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,160
It's called Miku fans or something.

1950
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,360
Miku has always been super crazy...

1951
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,140
popular worldwide.

1952
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,780
It's like an otaku...

1953
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:32,740
Basically...

1954
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:36,260
Everyone there is anime fan.

1955
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,960
Oh, yeah.

1956
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:38,420
Yeah.

1957
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:41,380
Yeah.

1958
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:44,480
So they mostly watch...

1959
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,320
into...

1960
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,340
anime stuff.

1961
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,960
But there are still a lot of people that watch like...

1962
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,920
TV, talk shows and all those things.

1963
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,260
It's just that they don't really recommend it to me.

1964
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,760
Since like...

1965
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,220
I don't think I...

1966
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,960
watch that many as well.

1967
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,200
Oh, so you're saying you might not like...

1968
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,100
like it as much as they do.

1969
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,280
I don't understand I think.

1970
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,240
And it's like the way they talk...

1971
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,760
and speaking wise might be like...

1972
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,240
It's difficult.

1973
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,200
It's because they talk really fast.

1974
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,480
It's like fluent so...

1975
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,480
it might be harder to understand.

1976
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,220
That's true.

1977
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,980
I did not understand what was going on in that...

1978
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,280
dating show but like...

1979
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,640
From what I could like...

1980
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,000
peace out from the words...

1981
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,900
I do understand.

1982
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,260
It seemed really funny.

1983
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,700
Yeah.

1984
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,420
Talk shows are just too...

1985
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:35,940
fast.

1986
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:36,920
They talk...

1987
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:37,800
extremely fast.

1988
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,140
Like back and forth kind of thing.

1989
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,700
It's really difficult.

1990
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:41,980
But like I try sometimes.

1991
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:43,300
Yeah.

1992
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,860
That makes sense.

1993
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,080
Do you know...

1994
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,480
like what is like...

1995
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,960
basically otaku in Chinese?

1996
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,740
Wait, what is otaku in Chinese?

1997
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,300
Er Ci Yan.

1998
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,740
Er Ci Yan?

1999
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,680
Er Ci Yan.

2000
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:59,000
Er Ci Yan.

2001
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,460
Yeah, it's like...

2002
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,000
like... how do I...

2003
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,180
put it like...

2004
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,760
There is... Zhai Nan is like...

2005
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:07,240
Zhai Nan.

2006
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,540
There is Zhai Nan in Chinese.

2007
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,360
But that's mostly like...

2008
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,820
I would say Er Ci Yan is more accurate.

2009
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:14,880
Er Ci Yan.

2010
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,500
What does that mean?

2011
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,780
Er Ci Yan?

2012
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,460
Er Ci... Er Ci is...

2013
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,400
Er Ci is...

2014
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,060
two, right?

2015
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:22,540
Er...

2016
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,180
What's Ci Yan?

2017
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:28,580
Er...

2018
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,520
I only know it in Japanese.

2019
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:33,320
Wait, I'm trying to translate it in English in my brain.

2020
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,220
It's not working.

2021
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:34,580
It means 2D.

2022
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,500
Oh, 2D.

2023
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,500
Yeah, it's like...

2024
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,380
like... like... like... like...

2025
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,400
Oh...

2026
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,360
I see.

2027
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:43,920
2D.

2028
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,860
2D is the best.

2029
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,120
It's true.

2030
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:49,780
Yeah.

2031
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:50,580
Yeah.

2032
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,920
Because we're 2D.

2033
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,700
And we're pretty cool.

2034
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,500
Are you?

2035
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,840
Actually, are you?

2036
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,560
And I'm pretty young.

2037
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,460
I'm very young.

2038
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,580
I'm not an auntie.

2039
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,220
I'm very young.

2040
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:07,220
I'm not an auntie.

2041
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,200
Okay, are you like into...

2042
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,260
You're a Vtuber, but are you...

2043
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,440
Are you Er Ci Yan?

2044
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:14,540
Okay, to be fair, I'm like...

2045
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:17,500
Okay, I always tell in my chat this, but I'm actually like really normie.

2046
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,280
Like...

2047
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,120
Normie?

2048
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:23,200
Yeah, I'm actually very normie.

2049
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,040
Um...

2050
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,640
Because like I actually watch 3D shows.

2051
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:29,120
Like, you know, flesh...

2052
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,360
Fleshed shows.

2053
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,160
Of people that are like flesh and not 2D.

2054
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,100
I actually don't watch a lot of anime.

2055
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,160
To be fair.

2056
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,360
Um...

2057
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,880
But it's only because... Yeah.

2058
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,760
But it's only because like...

2059
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,220
Because like I like to watch subs, not dubs.

2060
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,000
So like I watch... So like I have to read it.

2061
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:56,920
And I don't have the time to like just sit down and watch anime type deal.

2062
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:02,660
Like I... If I'm watching a show, I always do something in the background while I'm watching something.

2063
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,320
So like... So I can like split my attention like I can just like... If I...

2064
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,840
I don't have to look at the screen all the time.

2065
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,300
I can just like listen to what they're saying.

2066
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,040
And also like, you know, do stuff.

2067
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,760
So like I think like... Other than like...

2068
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,640
I think... I'm trying to think of like the last anime I've watched.

2069
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,920
Oh my god.

2070
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,520
Don't tell me like a 1980 anime.

2071
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,500
No, no, no.

2072
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,720
I do watch the new stuff.

2073
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:31,380
But it's like only if it's like super... Like you know, it's like the most popular thing on the internet type deal.

2074
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,540
Because I watch...

2075
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,960
I try to watch like 2 episodes of Oshinoko.

2076
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,420
And then I stopped after 2 episodes because I got depressed.

2077
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,780
Oh, yeah.

2078
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:44,820
Actually, Oshinoko...

2079
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:47,180
I actually also like...

2080
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:50,380
I've watched... I spoiled myself a bit and I was...

2081
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,580
I was like, okay, okay, I can't read this.

2082
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,560
It's really... It's kind of sad.

2083
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,740
It's kind of depressing.

2084
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,140
It's too real.

2085
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:57,760
Yeah.

2086
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:04,760
So like I stopped and then like... I think that was like the last anime I've watched.

2087
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,900
But like I would watch like, you know, like Oh, My Hero Academia was so popular.

2088
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,940
Like I mean, I guess it's so popular.

2089
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,660
But I would watch... I think I watched like the first season of My Hero Academia when it first came out.

2090
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:19,180
And then like... Oh, like Demon Slayer was so popular.

2091
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,600
So I watched the first season of Demon Slayer when it came out.

2092
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,680
And then like...

2093
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,000
Oh, JJK is currently so popular.

2094
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,960
So I watched the first season.

2095
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,220
I am!

2096
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,940
I am mainstream!

2097
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,340
I like watch it.

2098
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,740
It's just extremely mainstream.

2099
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,240
I am!

2100
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:40,180
It's like all the things you're listening is the... hmm... okay.

2101
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,560
Yeah, I told you!

2102
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:42,480
Ignore me!

2103
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,340
I just watch the mainstream!

2104
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,420
I told you!

2105
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:48,820
I told you!

2106
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,500
I don't watch... I just watch the mainstream stuff.

2107
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:59,120
The only time I've like gone out to watch like things that weren't mainstream or like read stuff that weren't mainstream.

2108
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,840
It was like years ago I feel like.

2109
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:07,580
Um... but like some of my favorite... like I don't know if you ever heard of the Liar Game.

2110
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,300
That's like one of my favorite like non-mainstream.

2111
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,400
I've heard of.

2112
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,940
Yeah, I probably have.

2113
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:20,260
It's basically cause like Death Note is like one of my favorite like manga slash anime of all time.

2114
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:23,060
Like I love... Okay, you say... okay Death Note is nice.

2115
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,600
It's cool.

2116
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,340
What do you mean nice?

2117
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,520
The way you...

2118
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,940
Yeah, it's nice.

2119
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:29,580
You know what?

2120
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,740
I give you a point for that.

2121
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,320
I'm like... in my head I'm like...

2122
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,080
Okay, I gotta like count everything.

2123
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,080
Everything that she said before.

2124
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:38,680
It's like...

2125
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,060
It is like a work of art.

2126
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,520
But I honestly I love like everything.

2127
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,980
Like I love the writer and the illustrator like when they work together.

2128
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,960
Like I love everything they do together.

2129
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,320
So like I've read like almost everything they've done.

2130
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,860
Like after Death Note.

2131
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,500
Um... like Bakuman.

2132
01:18:58,620 --> 01:18:59,740
I love Bakuman.

2133
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,020
Um... I don't know if you've heard of Bakuman.

2134
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,320
It's like...

2135
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2136
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:04,620
I have.

2137
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,820
Yeah, it's like...

2138
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:16,080
Yeah, it's the one where like they... it was like basically like parodying like Shonen Jump and like what it's like to be a manga writer and illustrator.

2139
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,380
So like I watched...

2140
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,580
Like I love...

2141
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,540
I love Bakuman and I love Death Note.

2142
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,460
But like...

2143
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,800
Yeah, Death Note was like my favorite all time favorite.

2144
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:26,900
I think it was like...

2145
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:30,160
Like before Death Note, I didn't really care about anime and manga.

2146
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,220
Like I was like super normie where I didn't even care.

2147
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:39,160
Other than like the shows that like my parents grew up with.

2148
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:44,540
Because like my parents grew up with like Dr. Slump and like um...

2149
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,160
IQ... IQ Bossy.

2150
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,880
Dr. Slump.

2151
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:48,900
Okay IQ Bossy.

2152
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,720
And then like uh...

2153
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,580
Uh... Oh my god.

2154
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,540
And then Shin-chan.

2155
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,500
You know Shin-chan right?

2156
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,740
Shin -chan is so fucking fun.

2157
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:58,040
Yeah.

2158
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,060
Yeah.

2159
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,760
I'm like listening to you list off the anime.

2160
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,220
I know it's old.

2161
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,820
I know it's old.

2162
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:11,160
But my parents grew up with it.

2163
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,680
So like...

2164
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:19,180
You know how like they grew up with it so they had the DVDs and the manga and then so they gave it to me to watch.

2165
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:23,280
And they gave it to me to watch so I watched it growing up.

2166
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,280
So like...

2167
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,800
And then there's like oh yeah Chibi...

2168
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,280
Maruko-chan.

2169
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,060
Oh my god that's so old.

2170
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,480
That's actually old old.

2171
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,420
I actually did watch Chibi.

2172
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,020
I think Chibi Maruko I watched.

2173
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,040
Yeah Chibi Maruko.

2174
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,440
I think it's cause the opening too.

2175
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:41,940
You remember the opening?

2176
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:42,940
That shit was fire.

2177
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:43,680
You know the opening?

2178
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,040
I was too young to remember.

2179
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:46,300
What are you talking about?

2180
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,460
I'm like...

2181
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,420
It's a good opening.

2182
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,420
It's like kind of like...

2183
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,000
You know the opening to that?

2184
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,580
It's like kind of like...

2185
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,040
It's like kind of like...

2186
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:04,020
No there's like...

2187
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,940
Okay wait no there was like a...

2188
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,960
Peely bada peely bada...

2189
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,240
Yeah that part.

2190
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,420
It was just so catchy.

2191
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,280
That one is like...

2192
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,660
I think even now a lot of people still know it.

2193
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:17,360
Exactly!

2194
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,640
It doesn't mean I'm old!

2195
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:20,660
That's the only part though.

2196
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:21,980
That's the only part though.

2197
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,780
Peely bada peely bada...

2198
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,000
Peely bada peely bada...

2199
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,280
It's a good opening!

2200
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:31,880
Yeah Suyinji.

2201
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,380
Oh yeah yeah that's what it's called.

2202
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,200
Suyinji.

2203
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,520
Cause I only knew like the name.

2204
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,420
I knew the name in Cantonese.

2205
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,520
But I didn't know the name.

2206
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,140
I forgot the name in like Japanese.

2207
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,840
And then Taimo.

2208
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:47,020
Your Cantonese is really great right now.

2209
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:47,560
No.

2210
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:49,000
Like it's better than your Chinese.

2211
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,700
I would say so cause like...

2212
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,020
I speak Cantonese at home.

2213
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:54,940
I don't speak Mandarin.

2214
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,640
I don't speak like Chinese Mandarin.

2215
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,360
Because like only my dad knows how to speak Mandarin.

2216
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,540
But then like...

2217
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,400
He like refused to teach me Mandarin when I was growing up.

2218
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:10,720
Because he was like...

2219
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,820
You don't need to know Mandarin.

2220
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,240
You just need to know Cantonese.

2221
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:15,660
And then he was like...

2222
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:17,840
Dude.

2223
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,080
She's gonna get confused.

2224
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,900
If we teach her more than one.

2225
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:24,260
So we'll just...

2226
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,720
We'll just speak in Cantonese.

2227
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,080
So I never...

2228
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,400
Only when I started getting older.

2229
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,180
And like...

2230
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:37,380
And when I moved overseas.

2231
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,520
That like I started to learn like Mandarin.

2232
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:43,180
Because like people around me were speaking Mandarin.

2233
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:43,740
And I'm like...

2234
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,920
Why didn't you teach me Mandarin dad?

2235
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,140
I was just like...

2236
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:51,060
I was just like...

2237
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,040
I was just like...

2238
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,080
Everybody's speaking Mandarin.

2239
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,820
Why did you not teach me?

2240
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:58,980
It's like...

2241
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,300
It's like...

2242
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,820
All my extended family on my dad's side...

2243
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:02,500
Speaks Mandarin.

2244
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,040
And they'll like tell me stuff.

2245
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,140
And I'll be like...

2246
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:11,700
Maybe they did try when you were like really young.

2247
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,520
You like feel...

2248
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,860
Yeah I couldn't like absorb it.

2249
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,040
Like we give up.

2250
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:23,430
They're like...

2251
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,450
Oh no she's too stupid.

2252
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:27,410
We'll just go with one.

2253
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:30,570
But your accent.

2254
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:31,750
Your accent like...

2255
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,570
Speaking Mandarin and Cantonese.

2256
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:37,350
Like Chinese and Cantonese now is like pretty good isn't it?

2257
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:37,870
Like...

2258
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:41,990
No I feel like it's worse because...

2259
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:44,150
Like I don't know.

2260
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:45,650
I don't use it as often anymore.

2261
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:48,230
Like I think you're definitely better.

2262
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:51,030
Because you speak it more fluently than me.

2263
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:52,850
I feel...

2264
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:53,450
And you're like...

2265
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,910
I'm always like embarrassed sometimes.

2266
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:56,750
Because it's like...

2267
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,470
You know I'm really scared.

2268
01:23:58,590 --> 01:24:00,830
It's like the 口音 is like always there.

2269
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:01,970
You know 口音?

2270
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:04,250
Wait what's 口音?

2271
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:07,350
The accent is always there.

2272
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:07,890
Oh!

2273
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:10,530
And you didn't like grow up.

2274
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:13,090
I think you didn't like naturally like grow up.

2275
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:16,110
I knew English and Japanese though.

2276
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:16,670
It's like...

2277
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:19,510
When I was learning Chinese and all that.

2278
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,350
It was really difficult actually.

2279
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:22,370
Really difficult.

2280
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,770
Right now like when I'm speaking.

2281
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:28,370
Like when I see 聽不懂.

2282
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:29,290
I'm like...

2283
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:29,670
聽不懂!

2284
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,270
聽不懂!

2285
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:33,670
Oh no!

2286
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:37,270
Did I just say that really badly or something?

2287
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:38,050
Hahaha.

2288
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:42,290
Sometimes I'm scared too.

2289
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:43,150
Because I'm like...

2290
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:45,330
Oh no what if I pronounce something wrong?

2291
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:48,610
Ever since in high school.

2292
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,470
When my friends laughed at me for speaking Cantonese.

2293
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:51,230
I...

2294
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:52,970
Oh yeah.

2295
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:54,770
Trauma.

2296
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:56,530
Trauma.

2297
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:58,670
Real trauma.

2298
01:24:59,610 --> 01:24:59,910
I'm like...

2299
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:02,630
Oh my god!

2300
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:06,830
She finally spoke Chinese in the I try to speak Chinese stream.

2301
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:10,430
Should we try and speak in Chinese?

2302
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:12,270
Should we try and speak in Chinese?

2303
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,390
It only took an hour and 30 minutes.

2304
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:13,730
Let's try.

2305
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,390
Yeah.

2306
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,170
My Chinese is a little...

2307
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,590
Like a child.

2308
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:24,210
Oh I'm a child too.

2309
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,170
Hahaha.

2310
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:26,670
Hahaha.

2311
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:27,250
Hahaha.

2312
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,950
I am.

2313
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:30,810
Hahaha.

2314
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:31,690
Hahaha.

2315
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:36,170
Wait a minute.

2316
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,330
You feel like you can...

2317
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,830
If your...

2318
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:43,790
Your Chinese is...

2319
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:45,670
Can you read some comments?

2320
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:47,650
Huh?

2321
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:48,630
Hahaha.

2322
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:50,690
Hahaha.

2323
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:53,410
Sorry I don't know what you're saying.

2324
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:54,270
Hahaha.

2325
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:56,050
Hahaha.

2326
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:00,130
I know a little bit of what you're saying.

2327
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:01,230
I don't know what you're...

2328
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:02,730
Hahaha.

2329
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:05,110
I don't know what you're saying.

2330
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:06,710
Hahaha.

2331
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:09,770
Okay.

2332
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:11,150
I only heard like...

2333
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,670
Half of it.

2334
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:14,450
Hahaha.

2335
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:16,350
I'm like...

2336
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:19,290
I want to show you...

2337
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:22,170
I want to teach you...

2338
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:23,790
Some really...

2339
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:25,070
Funny meme.

2340
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:27,250
But it's like...

2341
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,590
Really difficult.

2342
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,430
Do you know there's Chinese memes?

2343
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:33,250
But it's very difficult to understand.

2344
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:35,510
There's a difference between...

2345
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:37,930
English type of memes...

2346
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:40,850
Versus the China Chinese type of memes.

2347
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:41,390
Like what?

2348
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:43,510
Like they have...

2349
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,750
Abstract kind of memes.

2350
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,270
Do you know there's something about...

2351
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:50,290
Do you know there's a place in China...

2352
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,050
Called Guangdong?

2353
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:52,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2354
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:52,550
I've been there.

2355
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,590
That's where they speak a lot of Cantonese.

2356
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:55,770
And like...

2357
01:26:56,730 --> 01:26:59,110
Apparently there's a lot of cockroaches over there.

2358
01:26:59,210 --> 01:26:59,450
Huh?

2359
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:03,910
I just recently learned this too.

2360
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:04,810
I was like...

2361
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:05,310
Wait, what?

2362
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:07,090
There's a lot of cockroaches there?

2363
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:10,670
And there's a meme where they say...

2364
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:13,710
Because there's so many cockroaches there...

2365
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:15,750
They have a meme saying...

2366
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,470
Guangdong cockroaches are worried about you.

2367
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:18,370
It's like...

2368
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:22,010
The Guangdong cockroaches are worried for you.

2369
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:24,770
And they have a picture of the cockroaches at the window.

2370
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:25,330
And they have a picture of the cockroaches at the window.

2371
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:26,110
It's really stupid.

2372
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:28,270
Yeah.

2373
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,050
That's funny.

2374
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,190
Wait, do you have a picture of that?

2375
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:34,470
Or is it just like a verbal thing?

2376
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:36,370
I think I do.

2377
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,110
But I need to find it.

2378
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:38,650
It's like...

2379
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:42,210
It's a really weird picture.

2380
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,810
It's just a cockroach looking.

2381
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,750
Looking at a window basically.

2382
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,610
It's like...

2383
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:49,350
I was like...

2384
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:51,950
I remember the giant cockroaches.

2385
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,290
Oh my god.

2386
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:55,050
I remember too.

2387
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:57,070
I'll find it.

2388
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:58,290
Oh my god.

2389
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:59,350
I remember like...

2390
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,470
Oh my god.

2391
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:03,910
Because like in Shenzhen.

2392
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:04,350
Shenzhen.

2393
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:06,990
I used to live in Shenzhen.

2394
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,410
And like...

2395
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,710
And like...

2396
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:13,910
I remember like...

2397
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:15,410
I told a story before.

2398
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,490
A long time ago.

2399
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:18,670
But like...

2400
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:21,450
I was getting ready for school.

2401
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,150
And then like...

2402
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:24,210
I was about to leave.

2403
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:27,090
And I felt something hit my head.

2404
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:28,510
I was like...

2405
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:30,970
And I shook my head.

2406
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:32,790
And then I looked down.

2407
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:35,510
And I saw a fucking giant cockroach.

2408
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:37,390
Like between my feet.

2409
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,730
And then I freaked out.

2410
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:40,970
And I screamed.

2411
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:42,690
I went back home.

2412
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:44,530
I was just like at the...

2413
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:45,610
You know like...

2414
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:48,690
Actually I don't know if you know.

2415
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,190
But in Chinese homes.

2416
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:52,590
There's like two layers.

2417
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:55,870
You go out but it's not outside yet.

2418
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:57,830
It's not outside your home yet.

2419
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,890
It's not backyard because it's like an apartment.

2420
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:00,730
Villa thing.

2421
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:03,170
You go out but there's a balcony.

2422
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:04,510
And you have to go out again.

2423
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:05,470
So like...

2424
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:07,610
So I went out.

2425
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:08,710
And then...

2426
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,570
I didn't go out out.

2427
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:12,410
I went out.

2428
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:15,370
And I ran back inside.

2429
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,370
And I took a shower and everything.

2430
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:18,510
I was late for school.

2431
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:20,430
But I couldn't.

2432
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:22,030
I was like...

2433
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:24,170
It touched me.

2434
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:29,990
Are you scared of cockroaches?

2435
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:32,930
No I'm scared of every type of bug.

2436
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:35,990
I'm scared of every type of bug.

2437
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:38,970
I got slapped by a giant moth at one point.

2438
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:40,350
When I was walking down.

2439
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:41,010
Oh my gosh.

2440
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:41,870
Where was this place?

2441
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:42,890
It was like...

2442
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:46,930
I remember one time I took a school trip to...

2443
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:47,770
Oh my gosh.

2444
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:49,930
I'm trying to remember where that place is in China.

2445
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:52,090
But we were walking down this...

2446
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:54,790
Me and my friends were just walking down this pathway.

2447
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:58,030
And a giant fucking moth just slapped me in the face.

2448
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:00,550
I was like...

2449
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:02,590
Yeah I think that was scary.

2450
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:02,910
I was so scared.

2451
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:03,170
I'm lucky.

2452
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:05,090
Yeah it was scary.

2453
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:08,530
I'm scared of like...

2454
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:10,410
Lizards.

2455
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:11,330
Lizards?

2456
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:13,130
Why are you scared of lizards?

2457
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:16,430
I think it's PTSD as well.

2458
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:17,570
Wait what is the PTSD?

2459
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:19,810
It's like...

2460
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:22,290
So there was a time when I was younger.

2461
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,090
And I stayed alone.

2462
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:25,850
When I was a little kid already.

2463
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:27,290
I had my own room basically.

2464
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:30,070
My parents would be staying in another room.

2465
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:31,350
And...

2466
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:34,270
It was dark in the room.

2467
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:36,110
I was trying to turn on the light.

2468
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,150
But I was kind of small and short.

2469
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:41,150
So I was reaching for a really high light switch.

2470
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:43,730
And when I turned it on.

2471
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:44,830
I felt something like...

2472
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:46,990
Drop on my arm in the dark.

2473
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,030
And I was like...

2474
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:49,590
I was like...

2475
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,130
What the hell is that?

2476
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,710
And when I turned on the light.

2477
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:55,530
I saw a lizard on my hand.

2478
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,490
I freaked out and I screamed.

2479
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:00,330
And I threw it on my bed.

2480
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:01,690
And then like...

2481
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:03,910
It disappeared.

2482
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:06,450
Under my covers or something.

2483
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:08,090
And I was like...

2484
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:09,610
I stood there and I was like...

2485
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:10,290
Oh crap.

2486
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,370
Oh my god.

2487
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:12,790
There's a lizard in my bed.

2488
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:15,070
Because I was like a little kid.

2489
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:16,530
I was like 6 or 7.

2490
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:18,310
Yeah yeah.

2491
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:18,890
Oh my god.

2492
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:19,550
It's so scary.

2493
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:20,250
I was like...

2494
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:21,790
Oh no.

2495
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:23,170
There's a lizard in my bed.

2496
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:23,950
What do I do?

2497
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:25,010
I can't sleep here anymore.

2498
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:27,910
And I cried because I was so scared.

2499
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:30,010
Because it was on my bed.

2500
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:30,670
And on my hand.

2501
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:31,550
And I just froze it.

2502
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:32,770
So I cried.

2503
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:35,930
And I cried and called for my parents.

2504
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,050
But the thing is...

2505
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:39,450
My parents were watching TV or something.

2506
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:42,570
And they thought that I was laughing.

2507
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:44,250
Instead of crying.

2508
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:46,670
So I was like crying.

2509
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:48,270
Calling for my mom.

2510
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:49,670
And she was like...

2511
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:50,990
Why is she laughing so hard?

2512
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,630
Oh my god.

2513
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:55,090
They thought I was laughing.

2514
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:56,930
So I stood there crying.

2515
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:59,730
I was like... Why aren't my parents coming?

2516
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:00,710
I'm like...

2517
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:04,010
I'm crying here.

2518
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:05,130
And then like...

2519
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:06,750
Then they called for me.

2520
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:07,110
They were like...

2521
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:07,810
What's so funny?

2522
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:10,230
I'm crying.

2523
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:14,270
I'm not laughing.

2524
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:14,950
I'm crying.

2525
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:16,250
I'm not laughing.

2526
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:16,270
I'm crying.

2527
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:18,670
I didn't sleep in that bed for like 2 weeks.

2528
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:20,090
I slept with my parents.

2529
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:21,230
For like 2 weeks.

2530
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:22,990
I've had that moment before.

2531
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:25,710
I think it was like...

2532
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:26,110
I don't know.

2533
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:27,790
I think it was like...

2534
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:30,110
It was like...

2535
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:31,650
I've had these moments where like...

2536
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:33,050
If I see a bug...

2537
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:34,930
In a room.

2538
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:36,570
I just never go back to that room.

2539
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:38,110
For like...

2540
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:39,650
For like 1-2 weeks.

2541
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:41,410
I just never go back to that room.

2542
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:42,950
I remember like...

2543
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:43,890
When I was younger.

2544
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,110
I think I saw like a spider or something.

2545
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:47,270
In the bathroom.

2546
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:50,330
And then for 1-2 weeks.

2547
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:51,830
I just used my parents bathroom.

2548
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:53,830
Because I was like...

2549
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:54,490
I'm not going.

2550
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:55,390
I was like...

2551
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:56,930
What if it comes back?

2552
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:59,430
Like spiders?

2553
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:00,570
Speaking of spiders...

2554
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:02,430
I've been like...

2555
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:03,130
I don't know why.

2556
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:05,550
Currently...

2557
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:08,970
I stream in a separate room from my...

2558
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:09,610
Sleeping.

2559
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:11,810
My bed is in another room.

2560
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:15,090
I have like 3D cameras set up.

2561
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:16,770
I have like home 3D set up.

2562
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:18,010
In the other streaming room.

2563
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:20,230
And like...

2564
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:22,270
There's a spider in here somewhere.

2565
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:23,350
Actually.

2566
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:24,250
And...

2567
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:26,890
It only comes out when I play Apex.

2568
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:28,370
And I have no idea why.

2569
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:28,590
What?

2570
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:29,130
Apex?

2571
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:32,110
It has disturbed me like...

2572
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:34,190
I think 4 times so far.

2573
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:35,410
When I'm streaming as well.

2574
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:36,970
Only when I'm streaming by the way.

2575
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:37,930
And like...

2576
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,870
During other times when I'm streaming other things.

2577
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:42,950
It does not even bother me at all.

2578
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:45,070
But like when I'm playing Apex.

2579
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:46,210
I'm like fighting a team.

2580
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:49,290
It'll suddenly come in front of me.

2581
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:50,670
Like it'll hang in front of me.

2582
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:52,650
Or it'll drop on my lap.

2583
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:55,630
And I'm like crap this is a spider.

2584
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:57,390
And I have to like AFK you know.

2585
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:59,410
And sometimes I'm like dead.

2586
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:01,670
I'm like basically a death box.

2587
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,090
Oh my god.

2588
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:04,990
It's just like...

2589
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:06,430
It only comes...

2590
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:08,370
Yeah I had no idea why.

2591
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:10,410
The spider just enjoys the gameplay.

2592
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:12,870
So I don't know what to play.

2593
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:15,970
It's been like bothering me.

2594
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:17,810
I even have like a spray now.

2595
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:19,390
Because it's going crazy.

2596
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:19,850
But it's still alive?

2597
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:21,150
Yeah!

2598
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,670
I don't know maybe it had like a wife.

2599
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:24,310
I don't know.

2600
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:26,850
Wait don't say that.

2601
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:29,230
Because then there could be multiple spiders now.

2602
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:30,450
That's scary.

2603
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:31,430
Oh sorry.

2604
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:34,530
Speaking of which there was.

2605
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:35,850
Recently.

2606
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,930
It was like my most recent spider encounter.

2607
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:40,010
There's two.

2608
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:41,530
There was two of them.

2609
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:42,170
I remember.

2610
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:44,750
And I was freaking out because there's two of them.

2611
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:45,710
I was like.

2612
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:47,690
Why are there two of them?

2613
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:49,770
Yeah I was scared.

2614
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:51,450
But oh well.

2615
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:53,910
I'm not that scared of spiders.

2616
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:55,390
It's okay.

2617
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,070
I'm not that.

2618
01:34:57,790 --> 01:34:58,690
I think spiders.

2619
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:01,330
It's okay if there's two of them.

2620
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:03,590
That means it might be two females.

2621
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:04,910
Or two males.

2622
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:08,290
Because I think the female eats the male spider.

2623
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:09,410
If they're after.

2624
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,290
So if you find out there's one spider left.

2625
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,170
Then maybe you should get worried.

2626
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:14,810
Yeah.

2627
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:15,770
Oh.

2628
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:18,350
Oh.

2629
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:21,270
Just maybe after.

2630
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:23,030
There's one spider left.

2631
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:24,670
That means it ate.

2632
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:27,690
The male spider.

2633
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:29,710
Yeah.

2634
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:31,270
Well.

2635
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:33,630
But you're scared of bugs right?

2636
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:35,450
I'm okay actually.

2637
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,850
I'm pretty okay with bugs.

2638
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:39,670
It's just if they are on me.

2639
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:41,750
Then I kind of like don't want them on me.

2640
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:42,390
You know what I mean?

2641
01:35:45,630 --> 01:35:46,030
Yeah.

2642
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:48,910
If it gets really bad.

2643
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:50,790
I remember I used to sleep with a mosquito net.

2644
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:51,430
When I was younger.

2645
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:53,530
I would have like.

2646
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,290
You know like the nets that would go over your bed.

2647
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,150
Yeah.

2648
01:35:57,370 --> 01:36:00,110
I only use it once I think.

2649
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:01,970
When I was growing up in Asia.

2650
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:02,890
I used it a lot.

2651
01:36:03,150 --> 01:36:05,670
Because my blood was apparently really delicious.

2652
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:08,930
So then I would get bit very often.

2653
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:09,670
Yeah.

2654
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,650
So for those who don't know.

2655
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:12,110
Chat.

2656
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:16,130
Mosquitoes only target you if you have really delicious blood.

2657
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,470
It's like a particular blood type.

2658
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:18,790
I don't know what blood type I am.

2659
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:20,630
Because I never found out.

2660
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:22,290
Maybe.

2661
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:23,010
I don't know.

2662
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:24,070
Maybe there's a record somewhere.

2663
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:24,810
Really?

2664
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:25,330
Yeah.

2665
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:26,410
I don't know what my blood type is.

2666
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:30,790
So like you get bit a lot.

2667
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:32,310
It's because your blood type is like.

2668
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:35,870
A particular blood type that mosquitoes really really like.

2669
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,590
And so like I had to like.

2670
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:39,210
I had like mosquito nets.

2671
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,570
And then I would wear these like.

2672
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:41,830
Bracelets.

2673
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:44,430
That was like mosquito repellent bracelets.

2674
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:45,270
And stuff.

2675
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:49,030
And then I would like have to spray myself.

2676
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:50,810
With repellent every fucking day.

2677
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:52,570
Because if I don't.

2678
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:53,910
I scratch a lot.

2679
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:56,050
Yeah.

2680
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:57,530
I couldn't help myself.

2681
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:59,150
I would scratch myself a lot.

2682
01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:01,450
I think I'm pretty similar.

2683
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:02,410
If I'm not mistaken.

2684
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,910
Well I don't think they bite me that much.

2685
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:06,370
But they used to bite me as well.

2686
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:10,170
Like I'm.

2687
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:11,090
But I'm like O.

2688
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:13,110
I don't remember if it's O.

2689
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:15,170
It's the one that can give blood to everyone.

2690
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:16,890
The O that gives blood to everyone.

2691
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:17,950
Yeah blood type O is universal.

2692
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:19,910
Yeah.

2693
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,650
But there's like O minus O.

2694
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:23,630
I would like.

2695
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:25,710
I don't know which one it is.

2696
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:29,110
I know like my dad's blood is even more delicious.

2697
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:30,170
Than mine.

2698
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:32,830
So then like I remember like when we go on trips.

2699
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:34,310
Like we would just stick with my dad.

2700
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:36,110
So then all the mosquitoes would bite my dad.

2701
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:36,750
Instead of me.

2702
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:39,110
That was like.

2703
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:40,430
You get like a meat shield.

2704
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:42,610
So then the mosquitoes would target one person.

2705
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:48,490
Wow.

2706
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:50,510
Even as a kid.

2707
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:52,650
It's true.

2708
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:54,350
My mom taught me that.

2709
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:56,410
Your mom taught you that?

2710
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:56,850
Yeah.

2711
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:58,690
I was like stick with dad.

2712
01:37:58,770 --> 01:37:59,930
His blood is more delicious.

2713
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:04,070
It wasn't my idea.

2714
01:38:06,770 --> 01:38:08,250
It wasn't my idea.

2715
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:10,170
Your mom is.

2716
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,390
Yeah she taught you well.

2717
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:13,690
Yeah she taught you well.

2718
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:16,190
Yeah she taught you well.

2719
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,390
Doesn't she watch your stream?

2720
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:19,050
Yeah she does.

2721
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:19,870
Doesn't she watch your stream?

2722
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:19,990
Yeah she does.

2723
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,410
She's so cute.

2724
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:25,190
Like family watching stream.

2725
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:29,910
Yeah so do you wanna say something?

2726
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:30,450
I don't curse words?

2727
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:32,110
Woah woah woah.

2728
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:36,510
Woah woah woah.

2729
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:37,630
Woah woah woah.

2730
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:38,990
I didn't expect.

2731
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:43,390
I was so scared that we were gonna speak like full chinese the entire time.

2732
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:43,450
I was so scared that we were gonna speak like full chinese the entire time.

2733
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:44,170
Oh yeah that's true.

2734
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:48,810
Somebody in my chat was like the worst part was when they fly around your ears.

2735
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:49,650
Oh I hate that.

2736
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,050
I hate that so much.

2737
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:52,690
When the mosquitoes fly around your ear.

2738
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:54,290
I could never sleep.

2739
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,270
If I hear a mosquito I just don't sleep.

2740
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:58,070
Really?

2741
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:02,390
You know when the mosquitoes fly and it's like...

2742
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:05,630
And it's like so high pitched too.

2743
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:08,730
And then I get super paranoid too.

2744
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:09,850
Cause I was like...

2745
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:11,630
Oh no he wants my blood.

2746
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:13,170
Or she wants my blood.

2747
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:17,150
I can't sleep until she's dead.

2748
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:20,090
Oh yeah.

2749
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:22,550
Yeah I rarely hear...

2750
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:24,170
Actually I think my room...

2751
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:25,430
I keep like a can.

2752
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:27,870
Like basically a bug spray.

2753
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:29,370
Nearby in case.

2754
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:29,910
Yeah.

2755
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:31,630
Yeah I do have one.

2756
01:39:31,730 --> 01:39:34,230
So I regularly make sure it's like...

2757
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:34,530
Yeah.

2758
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:37,010
I would like have like...

2759
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:39,650
I think like later on.

2760
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:40,710
Cause it got really bad.

2761
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:42,290
So I had the mosquito zapper.

2762
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:43,210
You know the blue light.

2763
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:46,390
And I would just sleep with the blue light on.

2764
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,390
And it would be like...

2765
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:52,390
Yeah I think I bought a racket once.

2766
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:53,330
Oh no.

2767
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:55,670
I'm too fucking scared to use the racket.

2768
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:57,910
Cause it's like too close.

2769
01:39:57,910 --> 01:39:59,770
Cause you know there's like...

2770
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:01,590
Cause then you're swinging it.

2771
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:03,670
And then like the fly wing...

2772
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:05,110
The mosquito wings come off.

2773
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,170
Cause you're zapping it.

2774
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:07,770
And I'm like oh I don't want it near me.

2775
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:09,510
So I just have like...

2776
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:12,030
I bought the mosquito zapper.

2777
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:13,410
And I put it on the ground.

2778
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:14,350
And it would be like...

2779
01:40:15,730 --> 01:40:18,110
I think the scariest shit is like...

2780
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:19,130
You know when you open the window.

2781
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:20,570
And you have the mosquito...

2782
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:22,670
Screen.

2783
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,010
Screen.

2784
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:27,510
You know like the screen that you push up.

2785
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:29,350
So like you don't let the mosquitoes in.

2786
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:31,810
But you can have like outside air come in.

2787
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:34,090
And then you just see like...

2788
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:36,310
Like the mosquitoes just fucking...

2789
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:37,890
Be like let me in.

2790
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:41,430
That's just...

2791
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:43,010
I never open the window.

2792
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:45,790
Like I would never open the window.

2793
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,250
Because I just see like...

2794
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,410
All the mosquitoes outside be like...

2795
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:50,570
Let us in.

2796
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:52,650
Like I would never open the window.

2797
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:54,250
Like maybe it's where...

2798
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,110
Like the area you lived in had like a lot of mosquitoes.

2799
01:40:57,230 --> 01:40:58,710
Oh no no I lived...

2800
01:40:58,710 --> 01:40:59,990
I lived in an area...

2801
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:01,150
I remember like growing up.

2802
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:03,970
We would always live in areas with a lot of trees.

2803
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:05,810
And like grass and everything.

2804
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:06,750
So...

2805
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,910
So I would always...

2806
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:11,630
I would see the mosquitoes outside and be like...

2807
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:12,510
Let us in.

2808
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,110
Oh...

2809
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:17,510
Yeah like...

2810
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:19,450
The area I lived in...

2811
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:22,830
They did like regular fogging basically.

2812
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:23,390
Yeah.

2813
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:25,850
Yeah because you know it's...

2814
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:29,210
Pretty disgusting like all the mosquitoes.

2815
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:31,390
So they do like fogging all the time.

2816
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:32,990
Oh that's...

2817
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:35,110
I didn't need to use any nets.

2818
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:36,730
Oh my god.

2819
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:38,350
Because I only used it like once ever.

2820
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:39,310
That's so nice.

2821
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:40,870
Everywhere I lived...

2822
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:43,410
Like when I lived in Asia because I moved around a lot.

2823
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:46,270
Everywhere I lived there were so many mosquitoes.

2824
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:49,430
Because there was so much nature around us.

2825
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:50,530
Well it's not even nature.

2826
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:51,250
It was like...

2827
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:55,730
Sometimes I would live in like a mini gated community.

2828
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:56,970
Because I would...

2829
01:41:56,970 --> 01:41:58,390
At one point I lived with my grandparents.

2830
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:01,030
And they lived in a gated community.

2831
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:03,050
And then like...

2832
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:03,430
But like...

2833
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:07,530
There was like a park and then there was trees around us.

2834
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:07,910
And everything.

2835
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:09,990
So there was a lot of mosquitoes.

2836
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:11,850
And then there was cicadas too.

2837
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:13,430
So I could hear them go like...

2838
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:15,250
Oh that's so annoying.

2839
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:17,130
I had one in my room.

2840
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:18,850
You know like I had...

2841
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:20,850
Okay it was in the wall somewhere.

2842
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:21,390
What?

2843
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:22,770
It was in the wall?

2844
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:23,570
How did it get there?

2845
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:26,350
I think it went through like a pipe or something.

2846
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:27,710
I don't know.

2847
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:30,350
But like it was so noisy.

2848
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:32,190
So I...

2849
01:42:32,190 --> 01:42:34,690
On Bidipidi they have like an app for your phone.

2850
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:36,930
And you can do phone stream by the way.

2851
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:37,910
It's like...

2852
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:39,690
I think YouTube you can do phone stream.

2853
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:43,170
You can use your...

2854
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:45,070
I can use my live 2D in that app.

2855
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:45,510
Basically.

2856
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:47,970
It's like a customized app or something.

2857
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:52,010
And I was trying to do a phone stream in my room.

2858
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:53,730
Like just with live 2D.

2859
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:55,330
And like...

2860
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:57,570
Basically everybody could hear...

2861
01:42:57,570 --> 01:42:58,990
the cicada.

2862
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:00,230
Oh the cicada going like...

2863
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:03,370
Yeah it was really loud.

2864
01:43:03,870 --> 01:43:06,230
Like at night I couldn't sleep by the way.

2865
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:07,310
It was so noisy.

2866
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:09,410
Like it was just constantly...

2867
01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:11,090
making noise at night.

2868
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:13,350
And it was so difficult to sleep actually.

2869
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:14,650
Oh my god.

2870
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:15,950
It was so close as well.

2871
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:17,750
It was like right above my bed.

2872
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:19,430
Like somewhere you know in those pipes.

2873
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:20,370
Yeah yeah.

2874
01:43:20,670 --> 01:43:21,350
Oh my god.

2875
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:23,290
What is he doing?

2876
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:25,470
How did he survive for so long?

2877
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:26,470
Aren't you hungry?

2878
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:29,430
Yeah it was so long.

2879
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:31,830
I was like looking out.

2880
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:33,850
When do cicadas die?

2881
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:35,970
When do cicadas die?

2882
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:38,270
How old is your life span?

2883
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:39,270
I was like...

2884
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:41,750
I was wondering because I was like...

2885
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,750
This guy has been here for so long.

2886
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:46,370
And I was like losing sleep over it.

2887
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:47,310
So I was like...

2888
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:48,550
I was going crazy.

2889
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:50,370
I was like please just die.

2890
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:52,350
I can't take it already.

2891
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,010
It was really difficult.

2892
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:57,630
How long did it live for?

2893
01:43:58,650 --> 01:43:59,650
Well a while.

2894
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:00,950
Until like...

2895
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:03,430
Yeah I was like...

2896
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:05,410
hitting my wall because occasionally...

2897
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:07,630
if I slam my door hard enough...

2898
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:09,230
it would like shut up for a bit.

2899
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:10,650
It was like what's that?

2900
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:12,070
Yeah.

2901
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:15,130
So I had to...

2902
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:17,070
slam my door like...

2903
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:18,630
when I'm going out of my room.

2904
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:20,070
I would just close it really hard.

2905
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,990
And it would shut up for like 10-15 minutes.

2906
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:24,330
And I would be like...

2907
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:25,270
peace and quiet.

2908
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:29,350
Oh my god.

2909
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:31,230
That cicada was just like...

2910
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:34,770
Who is invading my home?

2911
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:36,610
The cicada must be like...

2912
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:37,750
Who is this girl?

2913
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:41,250
What is she doing in my home?

2914
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:41,730
Making a mess?

2915
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:42,650
Making all that noise.

2916
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:44,470
I'm trying to find a mate right now.

2917
01:44:44,490 --> 01:44:46,790
The worst part is that it got used to it.

2918
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:49,670
It actually got used to my door slamming.

2919
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:50,590
Oh my god.

2920
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:54,190
At one point I was trying my best to slam the door.

2921
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:55,990
I slammed it like 3 times in a row.

2922
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:57,230
And it still kept going.

2923
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:58,410
I was like crap.

2924
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:00,210
It's not phased anymore.

2925
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:03,910
He just thinks it's just nature.

2926
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:05,490
He's like oh it must be like...

2927
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:07,290
It must be like some nature thing.

2928
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:09,330
In my new place that I'm living in.

2929
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:13,910
It's like a little bit of a mess.

2930
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:15,290
I was like...

2931
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:17,590
I'm going crazy with this cicada.

2932
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:20,530
I'm going to sleep in my streaming room for a bit.

2933
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:20,970
Oh no.

2934
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:22,530
That's terrible.

2935
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:23,690
Oh my god.

2936
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:26,250
That sucks.

2937
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:29,350
I'm just like thinking.

2938
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:31,150
How did it get in your walls?

2939
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:32,770
I don't know.

2940
01:45:32,770 --> 01:45:35,190
I have no idea actually.

2941
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:39,310
I'm actually not sure how the hell it got in a place.

2942
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:39,850
It's like a pipe or something.

2943
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:41,250
It's really weird.

2944
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:47,150
You know how cicadas only come up after a couple of decades.

2945
01:45:47,410 --> 01:45:48,090
You know that right?

2946
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:49,850
Well no.

2947
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:51,090
Not really actually.

2948
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:52,350
You know why?

2949
01:45:52,490 --> 01:45:55,570
I've never had a cicada near my home before.

2950
01:45:55,970 --> 01:45:56,870
I've never.

2951
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:59,850
That was like my first time ever.

2952
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:00,630
And I was like...

2953
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:04,410
Why is there a cicada in my wall?

2954
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:05,850
I've never heard this before.

2955
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:06,750
Okay so like...

2956
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,290
Cicadas are actually...

2957
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:11,410
They live underground.

2958
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:15,530
They lay dormant for a long time.

2959
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:17,670
And then like after like...

2960
01:46:17,670 --> 01:46:18,110
Oh yeah.

2961
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:19,570
After like 17 years.

2962
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:20,590
They come out.

2963
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:22,270
And they'll be like...

2964
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:25,050
I don't know if that's like Asia.

2965
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,730
I don't know if that's Asian cicadas.

2966
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:30,230
Is this the same as Asian cicadas?

2967
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:31,590
I'm not actually that sure.

2968
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:32,370
But I know like...

2969
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:35,770
In NA it was a problem.

2970
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:38,810
Really?

2971
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,890
I don't even know that.

2972
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:43,210
Because like in NA...

2973
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:45,050
Oh I think I heard about it.

2974
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:45,390
Yeah yeah.

2975
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:46,070
So like...

2976
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:49,590
In NA they come out after 17 years.

2977
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:51,810
So like in NA...

2978
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:53,250
They actually have like a...

2979
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,370
Like a calendar.

2980
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:57,190
To let people know when the cicadas...

2981
01:46:57,190 --> 01:46:58,170
Come out.

2982
01:46:59,930 --> 01:47:01,430
And then like...

2983
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:03,550
So at one point...

2984
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:05,370
There was two cicadas...

2985
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:06,750
That were gonna come out...

2986
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:08,330
At the same day.

2987
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:09,870
Like on the same day.

2988
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:10,870
Which was crazy.

2989
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:13,950
Because like it was gonna be a huge problem.

2990
01:47:14,230 --> 01:47:15,250
Because there's so many of them.

2991
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:16,790
I saw like some news about that.

2992
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:19,270
People on the news were freaking out.

2993
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:20,030
Yeah yeah.

2994
01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:24,350
In NA we have the 17 years ones.

2995
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:25,110
People were like...

2996
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:28,690
Oh no there's gonna be so many cicadas.

2997
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:29,550
It was like an invasion.

2998
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:31,270
It was gonna be an invasion.

2999
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:33,830
It was similar to like the killer bees.

3000
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:34,310
Yeah.

3001
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:38,270
It was similar.

3002
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:40,830
I don't know why but for some reason...

3003
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:44,410
NA has like some fucked up thing with bugs.

3004
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:47,110
Because we also had like the killer bees at one point.

3005
01:47:47,290 --> 01:47:47,730
Because we also had like the killer bees at one point.

3006
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:49,890
Where there was like an infestation of bees.

3007
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:51,510
Like the killer wasp.

3008
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:52,850
Oh yeah the killer wasp.

3009
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:55,270
There was an infestation of killer wasp.

3010
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:57,830
I'm scared of wasps.

3011
01:47:57,850 --> 01:47:58,150
Me too.

3012
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:00,010
I'm freaking scared of wasps as well.

3013
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:01,630
And yeah there was like...

3014
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:03,550
A killer wasp epidemic.

3015
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:04,210
Or something.

3016
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:05,630
And then like...

3017
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:07,630
There was on the news and stuff.

3018
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:12,650
Like oh no the killer wasp are moving to like this area now.

3019
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:14,970
Oh my god be careful everybody.

3020
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:18,690
It was a problem.

3021
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:19,110
So scary.

3022
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:19,790
Yeah.

3023
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:20,550
Yeah.

3024
01:48:21,590 --> 01:48:23,010
Yeah it was a problem.

3025
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:24,390
I'm scared.

3026
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:28,110
I'm not usually that scared of bugs.

3027
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:30,530
But like if it's like in large numbers.

3028
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:32,030
Or if it's like...

3029
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:33,770
Okay deadly or something like that.

3030
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:34,650
Like it'll hurt me.

3031
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:36,190
Then I'm pretty scared.

3032
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:37,410
Like okay no.

3033
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:38,510
Oh yeah.

3034
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:43,430
That's why I have immense fear of insects.

3035
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:45,410
I have such a fear.

3036
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:46,010
I just...

3037
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:48,230
I don't care how small they are.

3038
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:48,990
They just...

3039
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:51,950
They look weird.

3040
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:53,270
They look funky too.

3041
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:58,250
It's like where do you put butterflies?

3042
01:48:58,250 --> 01:48:58,830
Butterflies.

3043
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:02,450
Have you ever seen a close up picture of a butterfly?

3044
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:03,630
It's hideous.

3045
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:04,270
Aren't they cute?

3046
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:05,310
No.

3047
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:09,290
Look up a close up photo of a butterfly.

3048
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:09,930
Really?

3049
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:10,670
No.

3050
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:12,250
They're fucking disgusting.

3051
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:13,450
No.

3052
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:23,850
Isn't it cute?

3053
01:49:24,170 --> 01:49:24,990
What do you mean?

3054
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:26,750
It's pretty cute.

3055
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:29,830
Your definition of cute is...

3056
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:31,950
Now I'm judging your definition.

3057
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:32,030
It's not that.

3058
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:32,670
It's pretty.

3059
01:49:32,890 --> 01:49:33,910
What do you mean?

3060
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:35,050
Look at the eyes.

3061
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:37,810
What do you mean?

3062
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:37,870
It's so big.

3063
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,790
It's so cute.

3064
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:41,890
There's millions of little dots in their eyes.

3065
01:49:42,430 --> 01:49:42,930
What?

3066
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:48,770
Okay the only bug I will say is cute is the domesticated moth.

3067
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:50,930
Have you seen...

3068
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:53,470
Moths are pretty cute.

3069
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:56,750
Okay I only think the domesticated moths are cute.

3070
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:58,730
It's because they're also like extra fluffy.

3071
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:00,370
But like I told my chat this.

3072
01:50:00,770 --> 01:50:02,830
But domesticated moths are...

3073
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:06,330
We domesticated them so hard.

3074
01:50:06,570 --> 01:50:11,010
That like their main purpose is when they come out of their cocoons.

3075
01:50:11,630 --> 01:50:15,770
Is to bang, lay eggs and then die five days later.

3076
01:50:16,490 --> 01:50:17,690
That's their life span.

3077
01:50:19,950 --> 01:50:21,970
Because like they can't fly.

3078
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:23,730
Because we domesticated them.

3079
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:26,730
So like they cannot fly at all.

3080
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:28,830
So like their wings are just decorations.

3081
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:31,250
And then their mouths don't work.

3082
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:32,150
They're just decorations.

3083
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:33,790
They can't eat at all.

3084
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:35,790
That's so sad.

3085
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:37,610
It's like so fucked up.

3086
01:50:37,650 --> 01:50:40,150
But that means it can never fly on me.

3087
01:50:40,350 --> 01:50:41,350
So like...

3088
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:44,070
True.

3089
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:48,410
I think like insects that can fly is the most fucked up thing ever.

3090
01:50:48,690 --> 01:50:51,330
Because like I just don't want them to fly at me.

3091
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:52,310
And like so...

3092
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:56,010
Basically their mouths they can't use it to eat or anything.

3093
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:57,130
It's just like decoration.

3094
01:50:57,130 --> 01:50:59,010
So they don't have like...

3095
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:00,490
It doesn't work.

3096
01:51:00,630 --> 01:51:01,950
It's like they don't have like...

3097
01:51:01,950 --> 01:51:03,590
Well at least they get to get you know...

3098
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,550
They get to bang before it.

3099
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:08,970
But the thing is...

3100
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:09,950
I told my chat this.

3101
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:11,910
But like the moths...

3102
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:14,470
Like the male moths don't know...

3103
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:16,930
They don't know how to stop.

3104
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:20,550
So like they'll be like stuck to the female moths.

3105
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:24,350
And you have to like pry them out their cells.

3106
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:27,550
Because like they don't know how to pull out.

3107
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:30,530
So like the owners have to like...

3108
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:31,510
Have to like...

3109
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:33,650
Like pull them out by themselves.

3110
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:35,150
Like the breeders.

3111
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:37,990
And then cause then if the male moths don't...

3112
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:39,990
The female moths can't lay eggs.

3113
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:44,090
So like cause they would be stuck together until they die.

3114
01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:45,090
Oh my god!

3115
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,570
I learned something today.

3116
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:51,250
Thank you.

3117
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:52,870
Cause like the...

3118
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:55,930
Like people have... like humans have to intervene.

3119
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:57,470
Or they'll like...

3120
01:51:57,470 --> 01:52:00,190
They'll be stuck together until they fucking die.

3121
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:04,490
And the female moths won't be able to lay eggs.

3122
01:52:05,030 --> 01:52:05,630
So then...

3123
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:08,430
Well...

3124
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:09,430
Wow.

3125
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:12,310
But yeah and then they starve to death because they can't eat.

3126
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:13,730
Aww...

3127
01:52:14,930 --> 01:52:15,450
Yeah...

3128
01:52:15,450 --> 01:52:16,950
That's pretty sad.

3129
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:20,250
That's their whole purpose.

3130
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:22,550
I think that's like a lot of insects whole purpose.

3131
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:23,390
It's just a...

3132
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:25,930
It's just a bang and then...

3133
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:26,810
I mean like...

3134
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:29,090
I told a story before but like...

3135
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:31,970
There's a species of mice that also does it.

3136
01:52:32,030 --> 01:52:36,150
The male mice bang so much that they just get a heart attack and die.

3137
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:38,070
Wait...

3138
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:38,710
How much?

3139
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:40,830
Like... a lot.

3140
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:42,670
To the point where they get a heart attack.

3141
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:47,550
Wait how much do you have to do that to get a heart attack?

3142
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:47,970
I don't know.

3143
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:48,930
I'm confused.

3144
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:53,670
I think this is a research you have to do yourself.

3145
01:52:54,570 --> 01:52:55,690
I don't wanna...

3146
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:58,610
I don't wanna have that search history of like...

3147
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:02,250
There's too much cardio.

3148
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:04,450
There's too much cardio.

3149
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:06,470
There's too much cardio.

3150
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:08,030
There's too much cardio.

3151
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:08,130
There's too much cardio.

3152
01:53:08,130 --> 01:53:11,190
I learned that in National Geographic.

3153
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:12,310
About the mice.

3154
01:53:13,450 --> 01:53:15,510
I think it was like...

3155
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:17,110
I think it was like...

3156
01:53:17,110 --> 01:53:17,650
I don't remember.

3157
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:20,370
For some reason that memory...

3158
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:21,590
That fact...

3159
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:23,370
The mouse fact is so like...

3160
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:24,470
ingrained in my head.

3161
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:27,010
Why is it so ingrained in your head?

3162
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:29,130
Okay... it's really fucked up.

3163
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:30,470
Because like...

3164
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:33,490
I was like in my grandparents room.

3165
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:35,570
And I was like watching TV.

3166
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:37,370
In my grandparents room.

3167
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:39,990
And I was like watching National Geographic.

3168
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:42,530
And I rarely ever get a chance to be in my grandparents room.

3169
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,130
And in like that one moment.

3170
01:53:44,210 --> 01:53:45,650
I get to be in my grandparents room.

3171
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:47,790
And I was just by myself in the room.

3172
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:49,350
And I was just watching National Geographic.

3173
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:51,490
And that rat mouse fact.

3174
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:54,050
Just stayed in my head for the longest time.

3175
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:54,950
Because I was like...

3176
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:57,770
One of those rare moments I get to be in my grandparents room.

3177
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:01,050
And it still happened.

3178
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:02,410
It was about the rat...

3179
01:54:02,410 --> 01:54:04,030
I don't remember anything...

3180
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:07,130
I don't remember anything else from that show.

3181
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:09,190
I just remember the mouse thing.

3182
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:10,270
Because I was just like...

3183
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:11,370
It was so interesting.

3184
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:14,690
Oh my god.

3185
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:17,030
My mod found the species.

3186
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:18,410
The type of rat.

3187
01:54:19,870 --> 01:54:20,390
Really?

3188
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:21,550
I think it is that rat.

3189
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:23,890
Oh yeah.

3190
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:25,190
They found it.

3191
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:26,070
They are like...

3192
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:29,210
The mouse experienced mass mortality after mating.

3193
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:34,150
With mouse survival only observed in the very rare cases.

3194
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:34,790
With mouse survival only observed in the very rare cases.

3195
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:37,190
When they actually found the rat species.

3196
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:38,950
Holy shit.

3197
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:39,490
That's crazy.

3198
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:41,150
Holy shit.

3199
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:41,150
That's crazy.

3200
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:41,370
Wow.

3201
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:43,410
I never knew that.

3202
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:47,030
I'm learning so much new.

3203
01:54:47,110 --> 01:54:48,750
Until they get a heart attack.

3204
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:50,610
I know you are learning Chinese by the way.

3205
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:51,570
I know.

3206
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:54,390
You are like...

3207
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:54,710
Wait.

3208
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:56,730
Here is an animal fact.

3209
01:54:56,730 --> 01:54:58,210
Here is an animal fact.

3210
01:54:58,890 --> 01:54:59,850
In China.

3211
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:00,390
No.

3212
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:00,870
Not in Chinese.

3213
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:04,870
Do you remember that bear that looks like a human?

3214
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:06,330
Wait.

3215
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:07,490
The sun bear?

3216
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:08,950
Oh.

3217
01:55:09,090 --> 01:55:09,310
Oh.

3218
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:11,010
I know.

3219
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:11,850
I've seen it.

3220
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:12,850
I've seen pictures of it.

3221
01:55:12,930 --> 01:55:13,070
Yeah.

3222
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:13,810
Do you remember that?

3223
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:15,110
Yeah.

3224
01:55:15,110 --> 01:55:15,350
I don't know.

3225
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:15,570
Yeah.

3226
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:20,430
People were like... Is that a person?

3227
01:55:23,290 --> 01:55:25,610
I remember when it went viral.

3228
01:55:25,650 --> 01:55:26,130
I've seen it.

3229
01:55:26,490 --> 01:55:27,610
I was like...

3230
01:55:28,330 --> 01:55:28,890
Wait.

3231
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:30,850
That's not a person.

3232
01:55:31,050 --> 01:55:31,270
Yeah.

3233
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:32,650
People were like...

3234
01:55:32,650 --> 01:55:35,070
And then the zoo had to like...

3235
01:55:35,070 --> 01:55:36,030
Release the statement.

3236
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:36,930
Yeah.

3237
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:40,550
The zoo had to release the statement.

3238
01:55:40,590 --> 01:55:43,290
I was like... Please stop calling our sun bear a human.

3239
01:55:43,630 --> 01:55:44,930
He is a real bear.

3240
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:47,490
They hired...

3241
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:50,530
A person to just be in the outfit.

3242
01:55:50,690 --> 01:55:50,950
Yeah.

3243
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:52,570
During the summer.

3244
01:55:52,670 --> 01:55:54,150
That person would fucking die.

3245
01:55:56,510 --> 01:55:58,250
It's so fucking humid.

3246
01:55:58,470 --> 01:56:00,710
It's so fucking humid.

3247
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:01,090
Yeah.

3248
01:56:02,730 --> 01:56:03,770
But honestly...

3249
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:04,950
It does look like one.

3250
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:05,250
It does.

3251
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:05,530
Okay.

3252
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:05,930
But...

3253
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:06,250
Yeah.

3254
01:56:06,350 --> 01:56:06,550
True.

3255
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:08,250
It does look like a human.

3256
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:09,150
It doesn't look like a real bear.

3257
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:15,030
That sun bear has always never looked like a real bear.

3258
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:21,070
I remember I saw the video and I was like...

3259
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:21,710
Holy shit.

3260
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:22,870
It does look like a person.

3261
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:22,910
Yeah.

3262
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:24,070
I actually thought...

3263
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:25,870
I was like... No way that could be a bear.

3264
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:27,790
That's just somebody in a barrel.

3265
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:28,290
Look at his eyes.

3266
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:32,090
He has a lot of skin.

3267
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:35,590
I think this is my favorite picture of a sun bear.

3268
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:37,230
I think this is my favorite picture of a sun bear.

3269
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:37,950
Don't worry guys.

3270
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:41,610
He looks like a fucking NPC.

3271
01:56:41,610 --> 01:56:42,010
Doesn't he?

3272
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:43,210
He looks like a fucking NPC.

3273
01:56:44,410 --> 01:56:44,970
Doesn't he?

3274
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:47,510
He looks like a fucking NPC.

3275
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:49,030
Doesn't he?

3276
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:49,570
He looks like a fucking NPC.

3277
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:50,430
I'm big now.

3278
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:52,990
Give me a second.

3279
01:56:52,990 --> 01:56:53,510
Let me resize.

3280
01:56:57,370 --> 01:56:58,830
I'm like looking at the...

3281
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:00,850
Even just randomly googling.

3282
01:57:01,070 --> 01:57:02,050
It's so weird.

3283
01:57:02,630 --> 01:57:03,110
Okay.

3284
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:03,330
Wait.

3285
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:04,970
Let me show my chat.

3286
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:05,790
The sun bear.

3287
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:10,490
I'm looking back at sun bears too.

3288
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:11,770
And I'm like... Oh my god.

3289
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:14,310
Like... Yeah.

3290
01:57:15,110 --> 01:57:16,050
I saw this image.

3291
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:18,930
It was definitely this image.

3292
01:57:19,550 --> 01:57:20,690
And like I saw this.

3293
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:21,310
I was like... No.

3294
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:24,350
It's a person just waving.

3295
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:25,770
It is.

3296
01:57:26,590 --> 01:57:27,450
Here you guys.

3297
01:57:27,670 --> 01:57:28,550
Here's a sun bear.

3298
01:57:28,770 --> 01:57:29,810
This is a real bear.

3299
01:57:29,930 --> 01:57:31,950
It's not a fucking 3D model guys.

3300
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:32,950
It's a real bear.

3301
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:33,810
Look.

3302
01:57:33,810 --> 01:57:34,990
You can tell it's a guy too.

3303
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:35,990
Look.

3304
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:36,030
You can tell it's a guy too.

3305
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:36,030
Look.

3306
01:57:37,190 --> 01:57:37,810
You can tell it's a guy too.

3307
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:39,270
Look.

3308
01:57:45,090 --> 01:57:45,090
You can tell it's a guy too.

3309
01:57:45,090 --> 01:57:46,070
It's really goofy.

3310
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:48,850
It's so fucking funny.

3311
01:57:48,990 --> 01:57:49,470
I love it.

3312
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:53,030
I love how goofy they are.

3313
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:55,570
They're so fucking...

3314
01:57:55,570 --> 01:57:55,990
I don't know.

3315
01:57:56,070 --> 01:57:57,130
It just looks like a human.

3316
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:58,890
And when I first saw it.

3317
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:00,150
It was the waving picture.

3318
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:00,850
So I was like...

3319
01:58:00,850 --> 01:58:00,970
No.

3320
01:58:01,270 --> 01:58:01,650
No.

3321
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:02,830
That can't be real.

3322
01:58:03,110 --> 01:58:03,250
Yeah.

3323
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:04,570
It's just a person waving.

3324
01:58:06,170 --> 01:58:07,530
A guy and a bear.

3325
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:08,690
Also the mouth.

3326
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:09,850
How it's always open.

3327
01:58:10,030 --> 01:58:11,950
It looks like it's just static.

3328
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:12,390
You know?

3329
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:17,270
Why are you scamming us?

3330
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:18,130
It's a person.

3331
01:58:18,350 --> 01:58:18,530
They're like...

3332
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:21,790
Please stop saying our bear is a human being.

3333
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:23,190
He's a real bear.

3334
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:24,870
I love...

3335
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:26,710
I love the random...

3336
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:29,510
animal facts.

3337
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:32,010
Especially the pandas.

3338
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:33,170
I love...

3339
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:34,610
Have you seen videos of...

3340
01:58:36,430 --> 01:58:37,850
pandas being taken care of?

3341
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:39,210
Actually pandas are so cute.

3342
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:41,550
But they're really stupid though.

3343
01:58:41,950 --> 01:58:43,510
I was watching a video.

3344
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:44,590
We have to...

3345
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:47,830
We have to literally take care of them.

3346
01:58:47,910 --> 01:58:48,930
Or they'll die out.

3347
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:51,010
We're literally making sure they don't die out.

3348
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:54,020
Because without human intervention...

3349
01:58:55,290 --> 01:58:57,510
They cannot take care of themselves.

3350
01:58:57,630 --> 01:58:57,690
They cannot take care of themselves.

3351
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:59,110
I'm pretty sure.

3352
01:58:59,450 --> 01:59:00,750
I was watching a video.

3353
01:59:02,210 --> 01:59:03,070
Someone was like...

3354
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:04,250
That makes them more cute.

3355
01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:06,450
Because they can't take care of themselves.

3356
01:59:08,210 --> 01:59:10,590
Animals that are a bit stupid...

3357
01:59:10,590 --> 01:59:11,430
are pretty cute.

3358
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:12,630
Because like...

3359
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:15,150
I remember...

3360
01:59:15,150 --> 01:59:16,870
There was a video I was watching.

3361
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:19,950
Of the zookeepers...

3362
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:22,390
Trying to...

3363
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:24,090
Take care...

3364
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:25,030
Trying to...

3365
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:28,230
It takes a very long time for pandas to...

3366
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:30,690
Um...

3367
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:33,770
It takes a very long time for pandas to...

3368
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:34,050
It takes a very long time for pandas to...

3369
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:34,770
Reproduce.

3370
01:59:34,890 --> 01:59:37,990
I think they reproduce once a year or something.

3371
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:39,170
Not even once a year.

3372
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:39,650
It's longer.

3373
01:59:40,370 --> 01:59:42,470
But you have to force them to.

3374
01:59:42,690 --> 01:59:44,050
Because they're never in the mood.

3375
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:44,690
Like...

3376
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:47,430
Like...

3377
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:51,150
I remember I was watching a video.

3378
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:52,610
A documentary.

3379
01:59:52,910 --> 01:59:54,810
Talking about pandas and the scientists.

3380
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:57,130
And the zookeepers trying to make them...

3381
01:59:57,130 --> 01:59:58,070
Because they're endangered.

3382
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:00,810
The problem was that they had to...

3383
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:02,050
Show pandas videos.

3384
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:04,090
Of how other pandas bang.

3385
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:06,270
To encourage them.

3386
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:08,730
To get in the mood.

3387
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:09,370
Hey...

3388
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:11,070
What?

3389
02:00:11,410 --> 02:00:12,990
This is how they do it.

3390
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:15,850
It's not.

3391
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:17,730
Yeah...

3392
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:19,250
Yeah... and then...

3393
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:21,430
And then...

3394
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:22,570
And then...

3395
02:00:22,570 --> 02:00:25,410
If a female panda has twins.

3396
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:26,910
They will...

3397
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:29,490
They cannot process that they have twins.

3398
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:31,590
So they'll be like...

3399
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:33,490
No, I can only have one child.

3400
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:35,370
So what a zookeeper does...

3401
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:36,850
They would...

3402
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:39,510
Because the baby pandas have to...

3403
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:42,010
Still need the mom to...

3404
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:43,770
They still need the mom to...

3405
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:44,750
Take care of them.

3406
02:00:44,990 --> 02:00:47,390
So what they do is that they swap...

3407
02:00:47,390 --> 02:00:49,610
The baby pandas with each other.

3408
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:51,210
So they'll be like...

3409
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:52,430
Daytime...

3410
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:54,430
Daytime you get your mama.

3411
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:55,970
Nighttime we're swapping.

3412
02:00:56,170 --> 02:00:58,430
But then the mama can't understand that.

3413
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:00,550
They just think it's one child.

3414
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:02,130
They just think it's one kid.

3415
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:04,010
And then it's so funny.

3416
02:01:04,110 --> 02:01:06,270
Because I was watching a video of how they do the swaps.

3417
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:08,930
And all they do is just give the panda...

3418
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:09,710
Like...

3419
02:01:09,710 --> 02:01:10,330
Food.

3420
02:01:10,610 --> 02:01:11,310
They'll be like...

3421
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:11,970
Here's food.

3422
02:01:12,210 --> 02:01:13,110
And then like...

3423
02:01:13,110 --> 02:01:13,890
Just take the child.

3424
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:17,310
And then the mama will be like...

3425
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:18,010
Food.

3426
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:22,950
And then they just grab the child out of the panda's hand.

3427
02:01:23,430 --> 02:01:24,350
And then like...

3428
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:26,510
Put another child in her hand.

3429
02:01:29,870 --> 02:01:31,810
And she just doesn't notice.

3430
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:32,470
She doesn't care.

3431
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:35,590
She doesn't do this or she doesn't care.

3432
02:01:36,670 --> 02:01:37,430
W.

3433
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:41,130
Yeah it's like...

3434
02:01:41,130 --> 02:01:41,950
Food.

3435
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:42,830
W.

3436
02:01:47,830 --> 02:01:49,090
And like...

3437
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:51,010
And like...

3438
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:53,250
You know how they only eat bamboo, right?

3439
02:01:54,330 --> 02:01:55,370
But like...

3440
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:57,850
Bamboo gives zero...

3441
02:01:57,850 --> 02:01:59,690
Almost zero energy.

3442
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:01,250
So they have to eat...

3443
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:03,230
So much bamboo...

3444
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:05,310
To barely have energy.

3445
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:07,290
Every day.

3446
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:09,490
Because it gives like...

3447
02:02:09,810 --> 02:02:12,210
Zero fucking energy for a panda.

3448
02:02:12,530 --> 02:02:14,210
And that's why they're mostly like...

3449
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:14,790
Sleeping.

3450
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:16,770
Because they have to save energy.

3451
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:17,710
Dude.

3452
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:21,690
It's actually...

3453
02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:23,210
Oh my god.

3454
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:24,590
It's just like...

3455
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:27,810
I feel like we're just making...

3456
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:29,130
Pandas worse.

3457
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:30,870
Like worse as in like...

3458
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:32,430
We're making them lazier.

3459
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:34,210
Yeah.

3460
02:02:38,130 --> 02:02:39,150
But they can't...

3461
02:02:39,150 --> 02:02:40,470
But the problem is like...

3462
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:42,110
They just can't survive already.

3463
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:42,750
They can't.

3464
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,330
Yeah there's nothing we can do.

3465
02:02:44,530 --> 02:02:45,510
So there's nothing yet.

3466
02:02:45,570 --> 02:02:46,990
Yeah there's nothing we can do.

3467
02:02:47,050 --> 02:02:48,390
We just don't want them to die out.

3468
02:02:48,450 --> 02:02:49,390
Because they're so cute.

3469
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:52,830
Like we have to.

3470
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:54,690
We have to.

3471
02:02:54,690 --> 02:02:55,650
Dude they're just too cute.

3472
02:02:55,770 --> 02:02:57,170
But oh my god.

3473
02:02:57,290 --> 02:02:58,530
If we did not intervene.

3474
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:00,130
I feel like...

3475
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:02,770
I don't know.

3476
02:03:02,830 --> 02:03:05,150
I don't think they would be existing at this point.

3477
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:06,150
If we didn't intervene.

3478
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:09,130
It's so funny.

3479
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:10,190
Like watching...

3480
02:03:10,190 --> 02:03:10,970
Oh my gosh and then...

3481
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:11,610
They're like...

3482
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:14,630
Baby pandas are like incredibly...

3483
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:17,890
They're like incredibly clingy too.

3484
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:21,190
Yeah they like...

3485
02:03:21,190 --> 02:03:23,050
There was a video I was watching with Zookeeper.

3486
02:03:24,690 --> 02:03:25,650
And there was like three pandas.

3487
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:28,570
Three baby pandas just holding on to her legs.

3488
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:30,110
It's like don't go.

3489
02:03:30,630 --> 02:03:32,110
Don't go.

3490
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:36,270
Yeah they're so cute.

3491
02:03:36,410 --> 02:03:37,210
Oh my god.

3492
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:37,830
They're so cute.

3493
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:38,250
They are.

3494
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:40,030
But they're so stupid.

3495
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:45,670
It's okay.

3496
02:03:45,870 --> 02:03:46,450
Like I was saying.

3497
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:48,790
People just like stupid animals.

3498
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:51,070
Yeah they're just like...

3499
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:54,170
That's what makes them cuter.

3500
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:55,110
Wait.

3501
02:03:55,610 --> 02:03:56,910
You gotta keep it Chinese.

3502
02:03:57,150 --> 02:03:57,830
Okay stupid.

3503
02:03:59,350 --> 02:03:59,870
Shit.

3504
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:01,230
Okay wait.

3505
02:04:01,370 --> 02:04:02,310
I know this.

3506
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:04,690
Fuck.

3507
02:04:07,110 --> 02:04:08,970
It's in the top of my head.

3508
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:12,910
Is it T-Scene?

3509
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:13,370
No.

3510
02:04:13,410 --> 02:04:14,070
T-Scene is crazy.

3511
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:15,510
No.

3512
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:18,610
That's crazy right?

3513
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:23,750
Wait what is it?

3514
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:25,590
What's stupid again?

3515
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:27,710
It's the cute one.

3516
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:29,530
Oh the cute one.

3517
02:04:29,790 --> 02:04:33,010
They say they call you like...

3518
02:04:33,010 --> 02:04:33,550
like...

3519
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:35,270
Oh yeah yeah.

3520
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:36,070
Yeah.

3521
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:41,250
蠢 蠢 is Cantonese.

3522
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:43,090
Yeah yeah yeah.

3523
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:44,210
It's cute.

3524
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:47,250
But it's a cute way of saying it.

3525
02:04:47,330 --> 02:04:49,390
It's not really scolding you or anything.

3526
02:04:49,610 --> 02:04:51,490
Like really cursing you.

3527
02:04:51,650 --> 02:04:53,750
It's just calling you a little bit stupid.

3528
02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:54,990
It's like...

3529
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:57,110
That's why people like to watch me.

3530
02:04:57,210 --> 02:04:58,270
Cause I'm cute and stupid.

3531
02:04:58,670 --> 02:05:00,250
And you too right?

3532
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:03,110
I'm basically like a panda.

3533
02:05:04,050 --> 02:05:06,250
Guys I'll die if you guys don't watch me.

3534
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:06,550
I'm not stupid.

3535
02:05:08,950 --> 02:05:09,850
Excuse me?

3536
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:12,690
I literally have...

3537
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:13,690
Yeah I have like...

3538
02:05:14,590 --> 02:05:16,130
901 IQ by the way.

3539
02:05:16,150 --> 02:05:16,870
In my description.

3540
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:19,950
I'm extremely high IQ.

3541
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:22,050
I'm sorry.

3542
02:05:22,990 --> 02:05:24,290
I'm just like...

3543
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:25,670
I'm just like a panda.

3544
02:05:26,350 --> 02:05:27,290
Oh my god.

3545
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:29,330
I need human intervention.

3546
02:05:30,350 --> 02:05:33,270
I do not feed the panda chat.

3547
02:05:33,490 --> 02:05:34,910
Guys I'm so hungry.

3548
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:38,370
Guys I'm so hungry.

3549
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:39,190
Guys I'm so hungry.

3550
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:42,250
Do you wanna eat bamboo?

3551
02:05:42,890 --> 02:05:44,670
Do you wanna eat bamboo?

3552
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:45,030
Guys...

3553
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:51,010
Oh my god.

3554
02:05:51,010 --> 02:05:53,390
That's why people like to watch me.

3555
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:54,430
I'm just like a panda.

3556
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:55,430
I'm cute but stupid.

3557
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:57,790
Yeah.

3558
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:00,270
I'm cute but stupid.

3559
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:01,170
Can't...

3560
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:04,510
Human intervention.

3561
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:07,730
Please intervene to keep me alive.

3562
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:14,170
Please intervene to keep me alive.

3563
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:17,410
I like how this was a try to speak Chinese stream.

3564
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:18,030
And then we're here.

3565
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:19,590
I'm here giving like animal facts.

3566
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:21,510
Hey but it's still a theme.

3567
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:21,650
I know.

3568
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:23,710
You gave me like so many animal facts.

3569
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:25,970
Yeah but they're like relevant.

3570
02:06:26,050 --> 02:06:27,710
Because like pandas are from China.

3571
02:06:28,670 --> 02:06:29,610
And like...

3572
02:06:29,610 --> 02:06:31,310
And like that mouse...

3573
02:06:31,310 --> 02:06:32,850
The mouse fact I talked about.

3574
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:34,010
Are you trying to like...

3575
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:37,550
You're supposed to speak in Chinese.

3576
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:38,830
Okay but like...

3577
02:06:38,830 --> 02:06:41,150
And also that mouse fact I told you guys about.

3578
02:06:41,230 --> 02:06:43,030
I learned it when I was like in China.

3579
02:06:43,290 --> 02:06:46,090
I learned that fact when I was in China watching it in my grandparents room.

3580
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:47,810
And also...

3581
02:06:47,810 --> 02:06:49,210
The silk moths...

3582
02:06:49,210 --> 02:06:50,530
The domesticated moths.

3583
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:51,730
They're silk moths.

3584
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:57,690
Which is relevant because like silk is very popular in Asia too.

3585
02:06:57,990 --> 02:07:01,490
So like all my facts were very relevant to the topic.

3586
02:07:01,870 --> 02:07:02,110
So like all my facts were very relevant to the topic.

3587
02:07:02,110 --> 02:07:04,590
How will you retell a rating in Chinese?

3588
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:05,110
How will you retell a rating in Chinese?

3589
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:09,610
Do you know that this thing is...

3590
02:07:09,610 --> 02:07:10,250
Do you know that this thing is...

3591
02:07:10,250 --> 02:07:11,590
very relevant?

3592
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:13,550
Very relevant.

3593
02:07:16,090 --> 02:07:18,550
Very relevant to this topic.

3594
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:20,090
Very relevant.

3595
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:25,510
Because what I say is...

3596
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:26,290
representative of...

3597
02:07:26,290 --> 02:07:29,290
representative of Chinese things.

3598
02:07:29,890 --> 02:07:30,670
That's why...

3599
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:34,110
What I say is very relevant to...

3600
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:35,930
What you get to teach me...

3601
02:07:35,930 --> 02:07:37,150
Cantonese as well.

3602
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:38,390
Oh yeah.

3603
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:40,950
I think I know some curse words.

3604
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:42,670
Thanks to like people saying it.

3605
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:45,030
Yeah.

3606
02:07:48,370 --> 02:07:48,890
Nooooooo!

3607
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:52,050
That's pervert.

3608
02:07:52,330 --> 02:07:53,570
Why do you know pervert?

3609
02:07:58,370 --> 02:07:59,630
I only know...

3610
02:07:59,630 --> 02:08:01,190
I only know a few curse words.

3611
02:08:01,190 --> 02:08:02,150
Who taught you pervert?

3612
02:08:02,670 --> 02:08:04,670
My chat.

3613
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:07,370
Wait, are they calling you...

3614
02:08:07,370 --> 02:08:08,930
They called you ham-sop?

3615
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:09,970
No!

3616
02:08:10,050 --> 02:08:12,070
They're like teaching me words.

3617
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,970
And they're like, hey you should learn this one.

3618
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:15,650
You should learn this.

3619
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:18,990
Wait, do you know pervert in Chinese?

3620
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:20,330
Wait, not in...

3621
02:08:20,330 --> 02:08:20,850
What is it?

3622
02:08:20,990 --> 02:08:23,410
It sounds similar to the Japanese word.

3623
02:08:23,570 --> 02:08:24,170
Wait, what is it?

3624
02:08:24,810 --> 02:08:25,210
Hentai?

3625
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:28,310
Yeah, it sounds similar to that.

3626
02:08:28,570 --> 02:08:29,470
Wait, how do you say it?

3627
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:32,370
What I know is...

3628
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:34,010
Oh, bientai.

3629
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:35,150
Wait, that's pervert?

3630
02:08:35,310 --> 02:08:35,570
Yeah.

3631
02:08:36,490 --> 02:08:39,450
So I can be like, you're a pervert.

3632
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:41,070
Can you say that?

3633
02:08:41,070 --> 02:08:41,630
Yeah.

3634
02:08:41,870 --> 02:08:42,650
Yeah, you can.

3635
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:44,710
But I'm not a pervert.

3636
02:08:45,110 --> 02:08:46,050
But you can.

3637
02:08:46,410 --> 02:08:48,030
I can say it though.

3638
02:08:51,050 --> 02:08:51,550
Yeah.

3639
02:08:52,610 --> 02:08:53,490
Yeah, it's...

3640
02:08:53,490 --> 02:08:55,630
When I was learning it, I was like...

3641
02:08:56,190 --> 02:08:58,670
Yeah, it sounds exactly like the Japanese one.

3642
02:08:58,750 --> 02:08:58,990
Yay!

3643
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:00,070
So easy.

3644
02:09:02,690 --> 02:09:04,370
Bientai has a negative connotation.

3645
02:09:04,490 --> 02:09:05,650
Well, it's pervert.

3646
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,430
Pervert has a negative connotation in general.

3647
02:09:07,670 --> 02:09:08,230
Isn't that pervert?

3648
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:09,050
Isn't that pervert?

3649
02:09:11,070 --> 02:09:14,170
There's no way you could make pervert a positive connotation, guys.

3650
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:15,370
There's no way you could make pervert a positive connotation, guys.

3651
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:15,710
Pervert is positive?

3652
02:09:16,050 --> 02:09:19,030
How can pervert be a positive connotation?

3653
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:20,950
It's negative in general.

3654
02:09:21,450 --> 02:09:21,970
Yeah.

3655
02:09:22,190 --> 02:09:22,530
Yeah.

3656
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:26,610
Wait, I'm trying to...

3657
02:09:26,610 --> 02:09:27,410
Is there a way?

3658
02:09:27,410 --> 02:09:27,950
No way.

3659
02:09:28,130 --> 02:09:28,530
No.

3660
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:31,850
You can't be a good pervert.

3661
02:09:32,150 --> 02:09:35,530
There's no way you can be a good pervert.

3662
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:37,390
What do you mean?

3663
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:40,470
What do you mean?

3664
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:41,590
Oh my god.

3665
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:45,190
You can say it in like a cute way, I guess.

3666
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:46,090
You can say it in like a cute way, I guess.

3667
02:09:46,290 --> 02:09:46,770
Bientai.

3668
02:09:50,770 --> 02:09:52,310
Wow, you're a pervert.

3669
02:09:54,230 --> 02:09:56,190
I mean, that's what...

3670
02:09:56,190 --> 02:09:58,330
Don't you know, they play koi?

3671
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:00,170
Oh, true, true.

3672
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:02,270
You know how they are, right?

3673
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:03,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3674
02:10:03,110 --> 02:10:06,290
Even in Japanese, it's like a kind of tsundere type.

3675
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:07,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3676
02:10:07,110 --> 02:10:07,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3677
02:10:09,550 --> 02:10:10,630
Like, huh?

3678
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:11,530
Bientai?

3679
02:10:11,770 --> 02:10:14,070
You know, like...

3680
02:10:14,070 --> 02:10:15,450
You know, like...

3681
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:17,770
Like that, you know?

3682
02:10:17,790 --> 02:10:20,470
You know what I mean?

3683
02:10:24,910 --> 02:10:27,150
Why did you say brother?

3684
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:30,110
Yeah, it's looking the same.

3685
02:10:32,350 --> 02:10:33,530
No, it's like that.

3686
02:10:33,610 --> 02:10:35,470
My sister can't be that cute.

3687
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:39,730
No!

3688
02:10:40,290 --> 02:10:40,310
No!

3689
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:43,310
Actually, when I was learning it, that confused me a lot.

3690
02:10:43,390 --> 02:10:46,710
Because in Chinese, they always say like 哥哥 and 姐姐 for everything.

3691
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:49,470
Everybody calls them 哥哥 and 姐姐.

3692
02:10:50,070 --> 02:10:50,590
Yeah.

3693
02:10:51,550 --> 02:10:52,450
Oh, no.

3694
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:56,410
Oh, but recently, there's another one, you know.

3695
02:10:56,870 --> 02:10:58,650
They like to say 兄弟.

3696
02:10:59,110 --> 02:10:59,630
兄弟?

3697
02:10:59,790 --> 02:11:00,610
What does that mean?

3698
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:02,290
兄弟 is like bro.

3699
02:11:04,070 --> 02:11:04,590
兄弟你好小.

3700
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:04,590
Yeah.

3701
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:06,650
Like, you smell so good, bro.

3702
02:11:07,290 --> 02:11:07,910
Bro, what?

3703
02:11:08,710 --> 02:11:09,270
Yeah!

3704
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:11,710
Wait, how do you use that in a context?

3705
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:12,750
What's the context?

3706
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:15,090
The context is he smells good.

3707
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:17,430
Why would you use that?

3708
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:19,910
Like, um...

3709
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:20,750
I guess...

3710
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:23,970
When you're trying to...

3711
02:11:23,970 --> 02:11:26,710
When you're trying to joke with somebody, I guess?

3712
02:11:27,010 --> 02:11:27,290
Yeah.

3713
02:11:28,210 --> 02:11:28,770
Yeah!

3714
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:33,990
Wait, there's like a picture for it too.

3715
02:11:33,990 --> 02:11:34,570
Bro, you smell good when you're trying to...

3716
02:11:34,590 --> 02:11:35,350
Wait, how do you say it again?

3717
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:37,130
Yeah, 兄弟.

3718
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:38,710
兄弟你好小.

3719
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:42,650
It's a popular meme now.

3720
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:43,230
Wait, really?

3721
02:11:43,290 --> 02:11:44,950
Bro, you smell good.

3722
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:46,130
At least in the Chinese...

3723
02:11:46,130 --> 02:11:50,090
Yeah, in the Chinese community, I don't know why they just like... and then they sniff.

3724
02:11:50,490 --> 02:11:50,970
And then they just...

3725
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:54,290
They're like, you smell good.

3726
02:11:55,170 --> 02:11:57,410
兄弟 No, it's not 兄弟.

3727
02:11:58,670 --> 02:12:02,490
兄弟 What's the last...

3728
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:03,610
How do you say the last part?

3729
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:14,770
兄弟你好小 兄弟你好小 兄弟你好小 兄弟你好小 兄弟你好小 兄弟你好小 兄弟你好小 兄弟你好小

你好小 is like, okay...

3733

That's a bit too much.

3734
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:38,370
兄弟你好小 Actually, there's... I don't know why, but there's like a lot of like...

3735
02:12:38,370 --> 02:12:40,970

3736
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:44,110
You know, that they like to just randomly say.

3737
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:46,390
Not really even in a perverted way.

3738
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:48,690
It's just they like to joke around like that.

3739
02:12:48,750 --> 02:12:49,050
Yeah.

3740
02:12:49,250 --> 02:12:49,710
Yeah.

3741
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:54,750

02:12:54,970 --> 02:12:57,630
基建 基建 基建, you know 基建.

3743
02:12:57,930 --> 02:12:59,870
基建 is like fencing.

3744
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:00,930
Fencing?

3745
02:13:01,070 --> 02:13:01,930
What does that mean?

3746
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:05,030
Just try and think of it in like a weird way.

3747
02:13:05,550 --> 02:13:06,430
Just try and think of it in like a weird way.

3748
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:07,750
In a weird way?

3749
02:13:08,150 --> 02:13:10,570
What do you mean by weird?

3750
02:13:11,030 --> 02:13:12,950
Fencing with something.

3751
02:13:13,870 --> 02:13:14,670
Fencing with something.

3752
02:13:14,670 --> 02:13:15,490
Wait...

3753
02:13:15,490 --> 02:13:18,210
Why do you know that word?

3754
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:21,390
Because that's the thing they teach me.

3755
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:22,530
Why?

3756
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:25,930
They teach...

3757
02:13:28,450 --> 02:13:30,210
What's the context?

3758
02:13:30,890 --> 02:13:31,910
What's the context?

3759
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:33,910
What's the context?

3760
02:13:34,610 --> 02:13:35,090
Yeah.

3761
02:13:35,290 --> 02:13:36,510
It's just fencing.

3762
02:13:36,610 --> 02:13:37,590
That's the context.

3763
02:13:37,690 --> 02:13:38,250
You know?

3764
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:41,090
Yeah.

3765
02:13:41,450 --> 02:13:42,290
Oh my god.

3766
02:13:42,570 --> 02:13:43,750
It's like sword fighting.

3767
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:46,350
It's also not even in a perverted...

3768
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:49,530
Like nobody really regards it as like a perverted meaning.

3769
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:52,450
It's just like a joke to them.

3770
02:13:52,550 --> 02:13:53,110
You know what I mean?

3771
02:13:53,170 --> 02:13:54,830
Oh, it's just like bro you want to fence?

3772
02:13:55,030 --> 02:13:56,650
Like a joke type, you know?

3773
02:13:56,650 --> 02:13:57,530
It's purely joking.

3774
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:58,470
Girls say it too.

3775
02:13:58,750 --> 02:13:59,450
Oh yeah.

3776
02:14:00,530 --> 02:14:01,570
It's purely joking.

3777
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:02,630
Yeah.

3778
02:14:02,770 --> 02:14:04,490
It's like 1v1 me bro.

3779
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:07,670
I feel like it's really bad when you translate it.

3780
02:14:07,770 --> 02:14:08,210
But like...

3781
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:12,170
It's really funny just to hear it as like a joke.

3782
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:13,710
Oh that's funny.

3783
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:14,710
Wait that's so funny.

3784
02:14:16,030 --> 02:14:17,590
Wait wait wait.

3785
02:14:17,730 --> 02:14:19,090
How do you pronounce it again?

3786
02:14:21,170 --> 02:14:23,030
It's literally fencing.

3787
02:14:23,290 --> 02:14:23,570
It's literally fencing.

3788
02:14:23,570 --> 02:14:24,250
Xi jian?

3789
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:28,470
J-I-J-I-J-I-A-N.

3790
02:14:28,730 --> 02:14:29,810
Xi jian?

3791
02:14:30,990 --> 02:14:31,250
Yeah.

3792
02:14:31,910 --> 02:14:32,530

3793
02:14:32,630 --> 02:14:32,990
Bro.

3794
02:14:35,050 --> 02:14:36,210
Bro, Xi jian.

02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:42,070
Okay, nobody says it like that.

3798
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:46,770
Wait, fence me bro.

3799
02:14:47,050 --> 02:14:48,270
That's what I'm trying to say.

3800
02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:49,810
Fence me bro.

3801
02:14:50,830 --> 02:14:52,950
Did no one just say fencing?

3802
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:56,490
No bro.

3803
02:14:58,130 --> 02:14:59,850
I don't think they add a wall.

3804
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:01,570
You know, like me.

3805
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:03,770
Fence me.

3806
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:05,430
It's 1v1 me bro.

02:15:06,590 --> 02:15:07,890
Oh I can't.

3808
02:15:07,950 --> 02:15:12,770
I'm trying to say 1v1 me bro.

3809
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:15,410
I'm trying to say 1v1 me bro.

3810
02:15:15,410 --> 02:15:15,810
1v1.

3811
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:20,050
Actually do you know 1v1 in like Chinese?

3812
02:15:20,230 --> 02:15:20,310
Actually do you know 1v1 in like Chinese?

3813
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:21,470
No no, how do you say 1v1?

3814
02:15:21,790 --> 02:15:23,030
It's just ee dai ee.

3815
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:25,110
It's just like one hit one.

3816
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:27,510
Oh ee dai ee.

3817
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:28,110
Hahaha.

3818
02:15:30,590 --> 02:15:31,110
Yeah.

3819
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:32,730
I can't believe it.

3820
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:33,690
I made it worse.

3821
02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:38,010
Yeah you did make it worse actually.

3822
02:15:38,270 --> 02:15:39,770
I was thinking like.

3823
02:15:40,930 --> 02:15:41,450
Nooooo.

3824
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:43,950
You know what's the worst part?

3825
02:15:44,130 --> 02:15:44,810
Like that meme.

3826
02:15:45,070 --> 02:15:46,450
Like the xiong di ni hao xiang.

3827
02:15:46,550 --> 02:15:49,110
That one is like they usually use it with like chikawa.

3828
02:15:49,370 --> 02:15:50,110
Do you know chikawa?

3829
02:15:50,330 --> 02:15:51,250
No what is that?

3830
02:15:51,910 --> 02:15:54,730
It's a very cute Japanese animation.

3831
02:15:54,730 --> 02:15:57,130
It like got super popular.

3832
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:58,770
Basically in their community.

And like they.

3834
02:16:00,350 --> 02:16:06,830

3841
02:16:18,930 --> 02:16:19,310
Okay.

3842
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:22,630

02:16:32,230 --> 02:16:32,890
But I always see it.

3854
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:40,950

3855
02:16:41,210 --> 02:16:44,550
I've seen it everywhere.

3856
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:46,270
It's so popular now.

3857
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:48,750
It's like the new hamtaro.

3858
02:16:49,610 --> 02:16:51,750
It's like the modern day hamtaro.

3859
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:52,350
It's very cute.

3863
02:16:57,150 --> 02:16:58,350
I don't know about Hiro's day.

3864
02:16:58,350 --> 02:16:59,490
But back in my day.

3865
02:16:59,550 --> 02:16:59,570
It's very short.

3866
02:16:59,570 --> 02:17:00,710
We had hamtaro.

3867
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:03,670
I know hamtaro.

3868
02:17:03,810 --> 02:17:04,890
Like a little bit.

3869
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:06,730
I didn't watch it.

3870
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:08,870
You never watched hamtaro?

3871
02:17:09,210 --> 02:17:09,330
I remember there's like toys.

3872
02:17:10,170 --> 02:17:11,910
Yeah but I remember like.

3873
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:13,850
They had like toys of them.

3874
02:17:13,950 --> 02:17:14,430
And I was like.

3875
02:17:14,530 --> 02:17:15,790
When I was a kid.

3876
02:17:16,070 --> 02:17:18,050
I remember when you buy like.

3877
02:17:18,050 --> 02:17:19,610
I think McDonald's maybe.

3878
02:17:19,670 --> 02:17:20,970
Like some drinks.

3879
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:22,690
They'll give you toys right?

3880
02:17:22,910 --> 02:17:23,670
And like.

3881
02:17:23,810 --> 02:17:25,930
I remember there's like hamtaro toys.

3882
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:26,470
And I was like.

3883
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:27,110
What is this?

3884
02:17:27,930 --> 02:17:28,750
It's cute.

3885
02:17:29,090 --> 02:17:30,830
Could you say that to hamtaro?

3886
02:17:31,350 --> 02:17:34,010
Hamtaro walked so chikawa can run.

3887
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:39,910
Hamtaro started the cute rodent fad.

3888
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:41,530
When was hamtaro?

3889
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:42,950
Hamtaro was so fucking old.

3890
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:45,670
Like hamtaro if he was a real hamster.

3891
02:17:45,670 --> 02:17:46,790
Would be dead right now.

3892
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:48,170
Oh wait.

3893
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:50,990
I mean.

3894
02:17:51,210 --> 02:17:51,670
Okay.

3895
02:17:52,410 --> 02:17:53,290
It's true.

3896
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:54,310
He's old.

3897
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:59,510
He must be really old.

3898
02:17:59,730 --> 02:17:59,990
No.

3899
02:18:02,330 --> 02:18:02,910
It's like.

3900
02:18:03,070 --> 02:18:05,110
Apparently somebody said 90s.

3901
02:18:05,130 --> 02:18:05,970
Oh my god.

3902
02:18:06,030 --> 02:18:07,050
Is hamtaro that old?

3903
02:18:07,390 --> 02:18:09,330
Okay but it's like 90s in Japan.

3904
02:18:09,750 --> 02:18:11,750
So like by the time it came to NA.

3905
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:13,850
Like by the time it came to NA.

3906
02:18:13,970 --> 02:18:15,210
It was like a lot older.

3907
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:16,050
Yes.

3908
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:16,490
Yes.

3909
02:18:16,610 --> 02:18:17,130
Yes.

3910
02:18:17,210 --> 02:18:19,370
I am very sure it takes years to get.

3911
02:18:19,510 --> 02:18:23,730
It takes years to get shows to be like dubbed in English.

3912
02:18:25,730 --> 02:18:26,250
Okay.

3913
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:27,530
Okay.

3914
02:18:27,790 --> 02:18:29,250
I only know the English opening.

3915
02:18:29,370 --> 02:18:33,230
Apparently like Japanese opening for hamtaro is like really popular.

3916
02:18:33,490 --> 02:18:35,450
But I only know the English one.

3917
02:18:37,250 --> 02:18:38,290
English opening?

3918
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:39,850
Yeah the English opening.

3919
02:18:40,010 --> 02:18:40,790
Oh I'm big again.

3920
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:42,310
The English opening for hamtaro.

3921
02:18:43,010 --> 02:18:44,550
Wait let me see if I can find it.

3922
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:48,770
I didn't even know there is like English opening.

3923
02:18:48,810 --> 02:18:49,650
English opening.

3924
02:18:49,770 --> 02:18:50,970
Yeah back then in NA.

3925
02:18:51,690 --> 02:18:53,130
A lot of the shows.

3926
02:18:53,490 --> 02:18:55,230
Like you know how Sailor Moon like.

3927
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:57,870
Bum ba da da dum bum bum.

3928
02:18:58,090 --> 02:18:58,510
Like the.

3929
02:18:59,330 --> 02:19:01,110
The opening for Sailor Moon got like.

3930
02:19:01,550 --> 02:19:03,310
Dubbed into English as well.

3931
02:19:03,490 --> 02:19:04,410
Like a lot of the openings.

3932
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:08,110
Back then would get like dubbed into English openings.

3933
02:19:08,270 --> 02:19:08,850
Cause they are like.

3934
02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:10,370
NA people are so stupid.

3935
02:19:10,430 --> 02:19:11,270
We need to dub everything.

3936
02:19:11,610 --> 02:19:12,270
For them.

3937
02:19:12,270 --> 02:19:14,830
Or they won't watch it.

3938
02:19:14,870 --> 02:19:16,330
They won't watch it.

3939
02:19:16,410 --> 02:19:18,870
If the openings are not in English.

3940
02:19:21,830 --> 02:19:22,510
I honestly.

3941
02:19:23,070 --> 02:19:25,570
I still watch anime.

3942
02:19:25,810 --> 02:19:26,630
And I watch sub.

3943
02:19:27,010 --> 02:19:29,890
I don't watch dub at all.

3944
02:19:30,270 --> 02:19:32,090
Yeah but like when you are growing up.

3945
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:33,370
Like when you are growing up.

3946
02:19:33,390 --> 02:19:34,170
It's all we had.

3947
02:19:34,470 --> 02:19:36,250
So like all the openings were.

3948
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:40,610
And like the openings didn't even like make sense sometimes.

3949
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:42,170
Like are like different from the original.

3950
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:42,250
Like the opening was like.

3951
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:42,690
The original opening.

3952
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:45,430
So like have you ever heard of the Digimon opening in English?

3953
02:19:47,050 --> 02:19:47,890
Wait what?

3954
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:48,350
No.

3955
02:19:48,810 --> 02:19:49,610
Wait okay.

3956
02:19:50,190 --> 02:19:53,430
Cause like you know Digimon opening in Japan is butterfly right?

3957
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:55,130

3958
02:19:55,210 --> 02:19:55,770

Yeah butterfly.

3960
02:19:56,650 --> 02:20:00,710
I grew up with the English Digimon opening.

3961
02:20:01,210 --> 02:20:01,770
What?

3962
02:20:02,390 --> 02:20:05,550
I never heard of butterfly before.

3963
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:06,690
Until like.

3964
02:20:06,770 --> 02:20:07,110
Really?

3965
02:20:07,230 --> 02:20:09,550
It was only until like.

3966
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:12,030
I think like in high school.

3967
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:13,550
When I heard of the.

3968
02:20:13,690 --> 02:20:17,730
When I heard of butterfly for the first time.

3969
02:20:17,990 --> 02:20:19,250
I was like what's this?

3970
02:20:19,790 --> 02:20:21,050
What the hell?

3971
02:20:21,050 --> 02:20:22,710
It's totally different.

3972
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:25,230
Digimon.

3973
02:20:25,390 --> 02:20:26,870
Digital Monsters.

3974
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:28,830
Digital Monsters Champion.

3975
02:20:34,090 --> 02:20:36,890
What is Digimon?

3976
02:20:37,370 --> 02:20:38,710
What is this?

3977
02:20:38,750 --> 02:20:39,350
Digital.

3978
02:20:39,850 --> 02:20:40,990
This cut.

3979
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:42,370
This is the only one we had.

3980
02:20:46,050 --> 02:20:46,470
No.

3981
02:20:47,830 --> 02:20:48,530
No.

3982
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:49,030
No.

3983
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:55,880
I have never heard of the Digimon.

3984
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:57,500
English opening.

3985
02:20:57,940 --> 02:20:58,420
No.

3986
02:20:58,860 --> 02:20:59,700
No.

3987
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:03,220
It was all we had.

3988
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:03,840
Okay.

3989
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:05,520
It was all we had.

3990
02:21:05,580 --> 02:21:07,100
It was pretty catchy.

3991
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:10,360
It was pretty good back then.

3992
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:13,920
This is so interesting.

3993
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:14,560
I've never heard of Digimon opening.

3994
02:21:14,580 --> 02:21:15,440
I've never seen this before.

3995
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:17,180
I'm like just watching it.

3996
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:18,720
I'm like what the hell is this?

3997
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,500
What is this?

3998
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,240
It's just really different.

3999
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:25,120
It's like so different.

4000
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:26,400
And then we would have like.

4001
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:30,020

Yeah, yeah.

4071
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:18,940
Shanghai is extremely like...

4072
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:22,100
Anime culture is extremely big there.

4073
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:22,560
Yeah.

4074
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,320
There's like collaboration cafes...

4075
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:27,180
There's like a whole mall...

4076
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:27,940
which is like...

4077
02:24:27,940 --> 02:24:30,300
Just for otaku!

02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:34,320
There's like Bidi Bidi merch as well.

4079
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:35,980
There's like Bidi Bidi anime merch.

4080
02:24:35,980 --> 02:24:37,240
Wait, did you spot your own merch?

4081
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:39,780
I saw my Nendo.

4082
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:42,540
Oh, it's so cute!

4083
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:45,020
That's really cute though.

4084
02:24:45,380 --> 02:24:45,960
You must be like...

4085
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:46,600
That's me!

4086
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:48,000
But you can't see it cause you want to dox yourself.

4087
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:48,820
So you're like...

4088
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,300
Yeah, I went with my other friend.

4089
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:52,480
My other Vtuber friend.

4090
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,460
And we were like...

4091
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:54,940
Can't see anything.

4092
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:58,480
He took pictures of everybody that I knew by the way.

4093
02:24:58,900 --> 02:24:59,640
He was like...

4094
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:00,720
Okay, I know this guy.

4095
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:01,040
Hey!

4096
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:03,080
Take a picture.

4097
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:04,920
He was like... I see you!

4098
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:08,420
That's so cool though.

4099
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:09,500
It's really interesting.

4100
02:25:10,340 --> 02:25:11,840
Yeah, that's so cool.

4101
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:13,060
Oh my god.

4102
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:14,020
There's like Bocchi.

4103
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:16,500
I remember when there was like Bocchi the Rock.

4104
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:17,300
Do you know Bocchi the Rock?

4105
02:25:17,300 --> 02:25:18,280
Yeah, I know Bocchi the Rock.

4106
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:19,920
I didn't watch it but I know it's super mainstream.

4107
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,480
It's very nice!

4108
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:22,500
Actually I like Bocchi.

4109
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,660
Bocchi was pretty nice.

4110
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:28,120
I only know it because of the meme.

4111
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:28,860
The Face.

4112
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:33,980
Like, when she starts dying and then like the face she makes.

4113
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:36,160
That's the only thing I know about Bocchi the Rock.

4114
02:25:37,140 --> 02:25:38,020
Bocchi the Rock.

4115
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:39,540
Like the meme faces she makes.

4116
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:40,740
The music is really nice!

4117
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:42,060
I like the music a lot.

4118
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:44,840
I haven't seen the show cause it's based off like a rock band.

4119
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:49,620
It would be sad if it was like the rock band anime show and then the music sucks.

4120
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:49,900
It would be sad if it was like the rock band anime show and then the music sucks.

4121
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:51,220
It's all about the music.

4122
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:58,020
Currently, everyone is like Raging over Bochy.

4123
02:25:58,180 --> 02:26:00,540
And then there is My Go now, I think.

4124
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:01,520
What?

4125
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:01,980
What's that?

4126
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:03,740
It's M-Y-G-O.

4127
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:05,940
I think it's Bang Dream.

4128
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:07,440
Do you know Bang Dream?

4129
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:07,960
No.

4130
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:09,700
It's not normie enough for me.

4131
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:13,900
It's not mainstream so I don't know.

4132
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:17,340
Yeah.

4133
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:18,600
Yeah.

4134
02:26:18,780 --> 02:26:23,140
So everyone loves it over in the Chinese community.

4135
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:24,820
They love that too.

4136
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:29,100
It's the music too, right?

4137
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:30,340
The music is just really really good.

4138
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:30,900
Yeah.

4139
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:31,340
Yeah.

4140
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:31,680
Yeah.

4141
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,380
Music is like a big thing.

4142
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:35,300
Oh, it's a rhythm game?

4143
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:37,640
Bang Dream?

4144
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:40,860
I have figures of Bang Dream, the girls.

4145
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:43,280
Oh, I thought it was like an anime.

4146
02:26:43,380 --> 02:26:43,880
Because it's like...

4147
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:46,240
There is an anime.

4148
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:47,580
But it's like...

4149
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:48,100
Yeah?

4150
02:26:48,100 --> 02:26:48,100
Yeah.

4151
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:48,660
It's like...

4152
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:49,860
There's a rhythm game.

4153
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:50,820
There's an anime.

4154
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:53,940
And the anime just came out not too long ago.

4155
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:54,660
Like...

4156
02:26:54,660 --> 02:26:55,720
Are those like the...

4157
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:59,100
Like those rhythm games where you have to wear gloves and stuff to play it?

4158
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:01,960
It's like the circle, you know?

4159
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:02,360
Yeah.

4160
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:02,620
Yeah.

4161
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:02,920
Yeah.

4162
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:03,160
Yeah.

4163
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:03,900
And then you just like...

4164
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:04,220
The girl.

4165
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:04,860
Then the girl.

4166
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:06,740
You can call it the cards, I think.

4167
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:07,200
Yeah.

4168
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:07,540
Yeah.

4169
02:27:07,540 --> 02:27:07,840
Yeah.

4170
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:08,420
Yeah.

4171
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:08,820
Like...

4172
02:27:08,820 --> 02:27:09,440
Oh my gosh.

4173
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:10,220
It's so hardcore.

4174
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:12,920
When I see people play rhythm games, people like...

4175
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:13,720
I remember like...

4176
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:14,540
Have you tried?

4177
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:15,100
No.

4178
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:16,560
I'm so bad at rhythm.

4179
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:17,640
I have zero rhythm.

4180
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:20,160
But like...

4181
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:23,400
People go so hard on rhythm games.

4182
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,340
It's actually crazy.

4183
02:27:24,580 --> 02:27:26,460
Because it's actually crazy impressive too.

4184
02:27:26,660 --> 02:27:28,700
Because I remember like seeing like some...

4185
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:29,460
I think like...

4186
02:27:29,460 --> 02:27:30,660
Like I think...

4187
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:31,560
Like when I was in Asia.

4188
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:34,140
Like I just see like this guy who just got out of work.

4189
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:36,040
You can tell that he just got out of work.

4190
02:27:36,260 --> 02:27:40,000
And he has like those professional gloves on for the rhythm games.

4191
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:40,440
Yeah.

4192
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:42,280
And then he would like put his suitcase down.

4193
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:43,020
And like...

4194
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:45,440
And like scrunch up his sleeves and stuff.

4195
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:47,960
Put the gloves on and go...

4196
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:48,820
Yeah.

4197
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:49,780
I know.

4198
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:50,160
I was like...

4199
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:50,340
Like...

4200
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:51,860
Yeah.

4201
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:52,340
My, my.

4202
02:27:52,380 --> 02:27:52,540
Right?

4203
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:52,900
Yeah.

4204
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:56,220
I had a friend that had gloves before.

4205
02:27:56,340 --> 02:28:00,800
Like I was just randomly going with her like just to hang out together.

4206
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:01,340
Yeah.

4207
02:28:01,380 --> 02:28:04,640
And like we just passed by the arcade actually.

4208
02:28:04,700 --> 02:28:08,180
And she was like, hey, can we stop by the arcade for a while?

4209
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:09,820
And I was like, okay, no problem.

4210
02:28:09,980 --> 02:28:10,660
I like games.

4211
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:11,680
So I was like...

4212
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:12,360
I went in.

4213
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:13,000
I didn't buy anything.

4214
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:13,940
I didn't play anything.

4215
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:16,380
I just watched her go crazy.

4216
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:18,300
She took out...

4217
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:23,500
She had like a bag and she just took out like these white gloves and I was like, oh, we have gloves?

4218
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:26,900
And she had like this big bottle of water as well.

4219
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:27,860
Just like ready there.

4220
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:30,320
And she's like going crazy.

4221
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:32,120
I was like, what the heck?

4222
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:37,280
So it's like you have to reduce the friction or you'll screw your combo.

4223
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:38,000
Oh my God.

4224
02:28:38,040 --> 02:28:38,720
That's so hardcore.

4225
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:42,980
It's like when like FPS gamers have to buy like a mouse pad on the PC.

4226
02:28:42,980 --> 02:28:46,380
And they have to put it on top of their mouse pad because the friction will ruin them.

4227
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:48,120
It's just like that.

4228
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:51,160
I was so surprised because she played like...

4229
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:54,660
I remember like at the time I think she was playing osu!

4230
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:55,480
You know osu!

4231
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:55,800
Yeah.

4232
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:56,140
Yeah.

4233
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:56,440
Yeah.

4234
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:56,540
Yeah.

4235
02:28:56,540 --> 02:28:56,840
Yeah.

4236
02:28:56,880 --> 02:28:58,020
She played osu!

4237
02:28:58,180 --> 02:28:58,520
As well.

4238
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:00,880
She was like some top player and I was like, oh God.

4239
02:29:01,020 --> 02:29:01,660
She's this girl.

4240
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:02,280
Yeah.

4241
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,600
She just played like rhythm games only I think.

4242
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:05,980
Like she only played rhythm games.

4243
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:06,720
That's so cool though.

4244
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:07,060
So she was like...

4245
02:29:07,060 --> 02:29:07,720
Yeah.

4246
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:09,560
It was like my first time because I don't...

4247
02:29:09,560 --> 02:29:12,960
I play a little bit but I don't really, you know, go at it.

4248
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:15,900
I don't play it that much so I was just like watching her the entire time.

4249
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:23,820
I think it's also just like it's like super impressive because it's like the dedication to and how fast they go as well.

4250
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:24,520
Like the...

4251
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:26,160
Like how fast your hands go.

4252
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:26,380
They're like...

4253
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:29,180
I can't see.

4254
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:31,480
Like my eyes are hurting.

4255
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:32,280
Like I'm looking around and it's empty.

4256
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:33,120
It's just like oh my God.

4257
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:35,460
How do you know what to hit?

4258
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:36,680
I think like...

4259
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:39,140
But like arcades are like so popular in LN Asia.

4260
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:40,820
Arcades are still very popular.

4261
02:29:40,860 --> 02:29:41,860
Like fucking NA.

4262
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:42,800
It's like it dies.

4263
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:48,620
Like people are just...

4264
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:53,660
People would just be like why do I have to play... go play at an arcade when I can just play at home, you know?

4265
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:54,820
They'll be like oh I have...

4266
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:55,720
I have PC.

4267
02:29:56,180 --> 02:29:57,900
I have my consoles.

4268
02:29:58,120 --> 02:30:00,340
Why do I need to go to arcades?

4269
02:30:00,380 --> 02:30:03,440
Yeah, a lot of arcades in NA have died out but like I know like...

4270
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:07,020
Because arcades in NA is like a children thing.

4271
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:09,060
Like we see it as like for kids.

4272
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:10,380
The games aren't different.

4273
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:10,820
Like...

4274
02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:12,060
Like are pretty different maybe.

4275
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:21,620
Well, there's like a lot of kids games as well but like even if they have like some games that are made for adults like rhythm games and stuff like that.

4276
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:23,200
It's just not popular in NA.

4277
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:32,680
But like in Asia, it's like it's mostly for adults with like a lot of like arcade machines and like the rhythm games and stuff like that.

4278
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:36,180
And I think it's also like UFO catchers and stuff.

4279
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:37,040
Yeah.

4280
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:39,100
I like UFO catchers.

4281
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:40,220
I love UFO catchers too.

4282
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:41,880
But like...

4283
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:42,040
But like...

4284
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:45,820
I'm always so sad because I'm like crap.

4285
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:48,940
I know I should just buy the item but I can't resist.

4286
02:30:49,220 --> 02:30:50,060
I just want to try.

4287
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:55,600
I just want to try a few times and then I fail and I'm like okay maybe I'll try a few more times.

4288
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:56,920
I feel like I failed.

4289
02:30:57,020 --> 02:30:58,500
And then you'd be like please...

4290
02:30:58,500 --> 02:31:00,860
And then you ask somebody like please can you help me.

4291
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:04,660
Ask those attendants like can you make it easier?

4292
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:07,620
Like oh yeah.

4293
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:12,020
And also like in NA like we have to have prizes in NA.

4294
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:14,040
Like you know like tickets and stuff.

4295
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:18,720
So like if you do well in arcades like you get tickets to exchange it for like prizes.

4296
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:21,720
But like I know like in Asia arcades you just play the game.

4297
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:23,380
Like there's no like actual prizes.

4298
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:26,460
It's like the prize is the experience of gaming.

4299
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,120
I think a long time ago there may have been.

4300
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:31,600
Yeah but it got like...

4301
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:32,660
It's just different now.

4302
02:31:32,740 --> 02:31:33,040
Yeah.

4303
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:34,260
It died out.

4304
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,480
The prize system.

4305
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:39,760
But yeah because like there's just like actual good arcade games and stuff.

4306
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:40,500
Yeah.

4307
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:44,480
It's just like you go there and play the actual games and have fun.

4308
02:31:44,620 --> 02:31:45,880
Yeah it's just the experience.

4309
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:47,580
I miss arcades.

4310
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:48,280
I miss arcades.

4311
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:48,800
And there's like...

4312
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:51,480
And then there's like some areas where you have to be like...

4313
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:55,260
You have to be like 18 or older to like go in.

4314
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:55,780
Wait really?

4315
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:56,340
Yeah.

4316
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:56,660
Yeah.

4317
02:31:56,760 --> 02:31:59,060
I remember this because I remember I was like in the...

4318
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:03,040
The only reason I remember this is because I think I was like in...

4319
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:06,000
I think I was like in like Hong Kong airport.

4320
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:09,900
And then like there was a section there where you can like...

4321
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:10,480
There was like a section where you can like...

4322
02:32:10,480 --> 02:32:16,520
There was like a section like the bottom like the arcades was like you have to be 18 to go to the arcade.

4323
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:20,180
Because we have some games that are for adults only.

4324
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:22,180
And I was like...

4325
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:23,460
And I would be like...

4326
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:24,040
And I would be like...

4327
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:25,020
And I would be like...

4328
02:32:25,020 --> 02:32:27,700
I was like dad I want to go to the arcade.

4329
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:30,640
And then my dad was like no you're not 18.

4330
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:31,340
You can't...

4331
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:32,580
You can't go inside.

4332
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:35,000
And I would be like but there's games inside.

4333
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:39,180
Really?

4334
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:39,840
Yeah.

4335
02:32:40,140 --> 02:32:40,960
Because there's like...

4336
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:42,020
Because there's like...

4337
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:44,260
I think it's like because like some of the machines it's like...

4338
02:32:45,220 --> 02:32:47,400
I think it's like it's sort of like pachinko.

4339
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:48,580
You know like pachinko.

4340
02:32:48,780 --> 02:32:50,320
Oh pachinko.

4341
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:51,380
But then they will have like...

4342
02:32:51,380 --> 02:32:53,760
I'm not a fan of pachinko.

4343
02:32:54,760 --> 02:32:57,300
It's just I think yeah I think...

4344
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,940
I think that's why they're like because there's pachinko.

4345
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:02,100
There's like pachinko machines.

4346
02:33:02,420 --> 02:33:04,640
So they're like you had no children at all.

4347
02:33:04,780 --> 02:33:06,060
But I don't know if it was pachinko.

4348
02:33:06,120 --> 02:33:08,760
I just remembered like they wouldn't let me in.

4349
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:11,940
Because they're like she's not 18 so she can't go in.

4350
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:14,660
And I'm like but there's arcade machines.

4351
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:17,900
I see some arcade machines in there.

4352
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:23,540
But you know Japan has like those large pachinko machines.

4353
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:24,820
Oh yeah yeah I know.

4354
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,780
It's like all just pachinko.

4355
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:28,060
It's like so popular.

4356
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:28,780
It's crazy.

4357
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:30,000
And then they would have like...

4358
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,340

Yeah and they have like crossovers with like different animes and stuff too.

4360
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:37,360
I know there was like a Madoka pachinko machine.

02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:38,740
That was super popular.

4362
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:44,060

I think it was like a popular arcade chain.

4368
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:03,100
I think that was what it's called.

4369
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:03,680
Maybe it's not.

4370
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:04,280
Jumping Gym.

4371
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:06,000

4375
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:17,680
It's not even called that.

4376
02:34:19,860 --> 02:34:20,980
No it is.

4377
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,220
It's called Jumping Gym USA.

4378
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:24,240

And it pushes out tokens and stuff.

4388
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:58,400
And then because like so I think it's because like there's like no you know there's no like gambling places and stuff like that.

4389
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:06,520
And so like all the grannies, all the grandparents and like would just be sitting at the coin pushers.

Because it's like for them it was like.

And then all the coin pushers...

4404
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:31,660
Kids and parents can just be there.

4405
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:35,500
Yeah, and then all the coin pushers were occupied by the grandparents.

4406
02:35:39,260 --> 02:35:42,840
See all these... the grandparents just be at the coin pushers.

4407
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:45,380
Just with like a huge bag of tickets.

4408

Because it's tickets.

4409
02:35:46,460 --> 02:35:50,000
So they'll have like a huge plastic bag filling up the tickets and stuff.

4410
02:35:50,180 --> 02:35:51,940
And then they'll have like a collection of coins.

4411
02:35:51,960 --> 02:35:53,320
Just like doing the coin pusher.

4412
02:35:53,460 --> 02:35:54,400
I'll just be like...

4413
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:56,700
I want to play the coin pusher too.

4414
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:02,680
Yeah, as a kid you don't really know.

4415
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:03,640
You just want to play everything.

4416
02:36:04,220 --> 02:36:05,020

Because we had kids and grandparents.

4427

Because like the prizes there...

4450
02:36:55,800 --> 02:36:57,360

You know what?

4481
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:39,360

4483
02:37:41,020 --> 02:37:41,280

Oh you don't need that phone.

4486
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:46,300
You don't want...

4487
02:37:46,300 --> 02:37:47,220

4488
02:37:47,260 --> 02:37:48,920

4489
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:50,440

02:37:58,600 --> 02:38:01,300
I forgot how it was like a lottery or something.

4495
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:02,100
And like...

4496
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:04,480
They're calling people's names.

4497
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:06,540
And it's calling numbers I think.

4498
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:07,120
And then like...

4499
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:07,900
My number was like...

4500
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:08,780
You got a phone.

4501
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:10,080
And I was so happy.

4502
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:11,220

02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:12,860
Yeah you did.

4505
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:14,740
And I gave it to my parents and like...

4506
02:38:15,240 --> 02:38:15,840
You're too young.

4507
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:17,720
I was like our phone now.

4508
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:20,780
Your phone?

4509
02:38:20,980 --> 02:38:22,140
No our phone.

4510
02:38:23,640 --> 02:38:24,040
Yeah.

4511
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:26,400
I was like so sad.

4512
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:27,260
I was like...

4513
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:27,980
But phone.

4514
02:38:30,860 --> 02:38:33,480
Well I guess I didn't get my phone.

4515
02:38:35,160 --> 02:38:35,560
No.

4516
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:36,840
No phone.

4517
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:38,060
I remember they gave me something else.

4518
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:39,000
They gave me their gift.

4519
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:41,640
I remember their gift was like some wallet or something.

4520
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:43,700
Not as expensive as a phone.

4521
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:45,200
It was like a tiny one.

4522
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:47,000
It was like a tiny one.

4523
02:38:47,340 --> 02:38:48,040
It was very tiny.

4524
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:49,380
I was like oh.

4525
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:50,440
Nice.

4526
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:50,840
It's okay.

4527
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:54,320
At least you get to hold it for a cup for a little bit.

4528
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:54,540
Yeah.

4529
02:38:54,660 --> 02:38:55,580
I was like yeah.

4530
02:38:55,880 --> 02:38:58,400
You need to feel the sense of winning a phone.

4531
02:38:58,400 --> 02:38:59,900
Yeah I had the box in my hand.

4532
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:00,300
Yeah yeah.

4533
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:02,280
You're like at least I have that box.

4534
02:39:02,820 --> 02:39:04,780
No I put it down actually.

4535
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:05,780
Like I went to sleep.

4536
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:06,820
And then like I put it down.

4537
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:07,340
I put it on the table.

4538
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:09,360
And like the next day it was gone.

4539
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:11,660
I was like where did it go?

4540
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:14,040
Oh damn.

4541
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:14,720
It's like well.

4542
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:17,300
One day with a phone.

4543
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:19,080
Yeah.

4544
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:21,480
I was like damn.

4545
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:22,260
Damn.

4546
02:39:22,300 --> 02:39:22,460
Damn.

4547
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:22,960
Well oop.

4548
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:23,820
You got the experience.

4549
02:39:23,900 --> 02:39:25,260
At least you got the experience.

4550
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:27,200
You know it's all about the experience.

4551
02:39:29,220 --> 02:39:29,660
Yeah.

4552
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:32,000
I was kind of okay.

4553
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:33,020
I was like okay.

4554
02:39:33,820 --> 02:39:35,520
Because I was like rationalizing.

4555
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:36,380
Rationalizing.

4556
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:36,440
Rationalizing.

4557
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:37,020
With myself.

4558
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:40,060
I was like okay maybe I am too young to wear a phone.

4559
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:42,220
Maybe my parents are right.

4560
02:39:43,400 --> 02:39:44,300
You know what?

4561
02:39:44,300 --> 02:39:44,900
It's okay.

4562
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:45,980
They can use it.

4563
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:47,560
How old were you when you had your first phone?

4564
02:39:50,060 --> 02:39:51,400
I don't remember.

4565
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:52,360
Damn.

4566
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:53,300
I don't remember.

4567
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:55,640
I remember it was like my dad's phone that he gave me.

4568
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:56,220
Oh yeah.

4569
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:59,920
It was like their second hand phone.

4570
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:03,820
Yeah like I think like I was like middle school when I had my first phone.

4571
02:40:04,060 --> 02:40:04,700
I think.

4572
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:05,660
I think.

4573
02:40:05,660 --> 02:40:09,300
Because I was like all my friends had phones.

4574
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:10,300
Like cell phones.

4575
02:40:10,540 --> 02:40:12,780
Oh like my first phone was the...

4576
02:40:14,580 --> 02:40:16,780
I don't know if you remember Motorola?

4577
02:40:18,860 --> 02:40:19,560
Oh yeah.

4580
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:22,540
And then it was like Motorola.

4581
02:40:23,660 --> 02:40:25,420
It sings that funky song.

4582
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:30,400
I think I saw some like adults using it.

4583
02:40:30,460 --> 02:40:31,220
That's why it's old.

4584
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:33,420
Yeah it was like a hand-me-down.

4585
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:34,540
It was a hand-me-down.

4586
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:34,980
Yeah.

4587
02:40:34,980 --> 02:40:39,860
I remember I got a phone from my parents and then I loved that phone because it would sing the song was so funny.

4588
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,920
I was like somebody call me so I can listen to the song.

4589
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:45,220
Hello Moto.

4590
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:45,640

I was like I hope somebody calls me so I can listen to that song.

4598
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:02,840
I remember I used to like borrow...

4599
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:08,080
I like like take my dad's phone out because like back then I think there's like no games on phones.

4600
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:08,340
Right?

4601
02:41:08,360 --> 02:41:09,300
Those were really old phones.

4602
02:41:09,320 --> 02:41:11,520

4603
02:41:11,620 --> 02:41:11,800

4663
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:13,500
There's like a really funny one.

4664
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:14,200

02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:29,480
It's like totally like it just devolves into like okay okay they just like of course it's like a bit bad but like most of it is just like laughing at the person.

4668
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:29,920
Yeah.

4669
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:30,700
All the time.

4670
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:31,260
Yeah.

4671
02:43:31,280 --> 02:43:43,620
And it's mostly because like there's like a guy who was like he was like if you're if you're like bad at something like bad at the game.

4672
02:43:43,720 --> 02:43:44,060

4673
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:49,820

4675
02:43:51,440 --> 02:43:51,760
Yeah.

4676
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:55,740
So he was he was like a professional in some game or something he was like.

4677
02:43:55,820 --> 02:43:59,280
And he was just like oh just just practice more but he was a hacker.

4678
02:43:59,660 --> 02:43:59,860
Yeah.

4679
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:00,260

Yeah.

4688
02:44:11,100 --> 02:44:17,340
It's really famous actually and it was because he was doing some weird hand gestures and stuff and he looked like a crap by the way.

02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:21,980
Yeah.

4691
02:44:22,300 --> 02:44:30,320
It was because like I think he was like playing competition or something and like in the first half he was like getting beaten really badly and like in the second half.

4692
02:44:30,320 --> 02:44:30,580

It is.

4703
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:47,540

Yeah.

4708
02:44:53,220 --> 02:44:59,140
And there's another one like I think not that old as well like maybe late last year.

4709
02:44:59,420 --> 02:44:59,820
Yeah.

4710
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:00,300
Yeah.

4711
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:07,380
Late last year as well which became really big because it was actually a Vtuber by the way that did it.

4712
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:11,640
It was like a tournament for Valorant.

4713
02:45:11,740 --> 02:45:13,480
Wait I heard about that.

It was so bad.

4717
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:25,100
It became a meme though because it was really funny.

4718
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:28,680
Everybody started like streaming with like a box on your screen.

4719
02:45:28,900 --> 02:45:30,100
Like a little box.

4720
02:45:30,100 --> 02:45:30,300
Like a little box.

4721
02:45:30,300 --> 02:45:32,680
Like a box because it was like the hack she was using.

4722
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:34,260
So yeah it was like.

4723
02:45:34,380 --> 02:45:37,120
What is this square?

4724
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,240
What is this square?

4725
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:41,360
It's the Clara.

4726
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:49,680
Okay because like people okay the reason why like people overseas knew about it is because we had a similar instance with like Clara.

4727
02:45:50,100 --> 02:45:53,400
So like it's a I don't know have you heard about the Clara meme?

4728
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:53,900
Clara?

4729
02:45:53,960 --> 02:45:54,440
Okay.

4730
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:59,200
So like the reason why we knew about it is because like in NA.

4731
02:45:59,320 --> 02:45:59,500
In NA.

4732
02:45:59,500 --> 02:45:59,740
In NA.

4733
02:45:59,740 --> 02:46:03,660
We had a similar experience with like but like it wasn't tournament or anything.

4734
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:08,640
But it was like this girl that was like she's playing CSGO.

4735
02:46:08,940 --> 02:46:11,920
And then and then basically it's it's so similar.

4736
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:18,640
It's so similar but basically she like she accidentally did like click something that showed her her walling and stuff.

4737
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:22,940
And then people on her stream were like what the she's hacking.

4738
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:26,420
And then she was like she noticed and then she was like oh my god it's Clara.

4739
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:27,400
Clara installed.

4740
02:46:27,700 --> 02:46:29,360
Clara was on my PC.

4741
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:31,760
And installed hacks onto my PC.

4742
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:32,340
Clara!

4743
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:34,180
What did you do Clara?

4744
02:46:34,660 --> 02:46:38,000
But obviously people were like who the fuck is Clara?

4745
02:46:40,940 --> 02:46:46,300
So she tried to like blame this fucking made up girl named Clara that...

4746
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:48,700
Yeah.

4747
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:55,360
It was like similar issues like I think because of that like people just put a box on your screen the whole time.

4748
02:46:55,540 --> 02:46:58,240
And she was like oh what is this box?

4749
02:46:58,600 --> 02:46:59,180
What?

4750
02:46:59,360 --> 02:47:00,400
What is this box?

4751
02:47:00,540 --> 02:47:01,480
Oh it can't move.

4752
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:03,520
Why is it moving with the people?

4753
02:47:03,880 --> 02:47:08,020
I think she said it was like because of her setting or like she was doing some preset.

4754
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:09,400
It was like a visual setting.

4755
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:09,860
Like a preset?

4756
02:47:10,380 --> 02:47:12,260
Yeah yeah yeah it was like a preset.

4757
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:13,840
And then I was like...

4758
02:47:14,500 --> 02:47:15,380
Um yeah.

4759
02:47:15,880 --> 02:47:16,320
No.

4760
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:17,120
Preset.

4761
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:17,880
Yeah.

4762
02:47:18,840 --> 02:47:20,240
Oh my god.

4763
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:25,960
That's actually people who I don't understand why would you hack though.

4764
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,680
I think it's better to just admit that.

4765
02:47:27,780 --> 02:47:28,460
Yeah just be bad.

4766
02:47:28,460 --> 02:47:28,980
Just leave.

4767
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:30,220
Just end it.

4768
02:47:30,500 --> 02:47:31,060
Like go.

4769
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:31,960
Just leave.

4770
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:33,220
I think if you defend yourself.

4771
02:47:33,260 --> 02:47:35,580
You can't defend yourself if you like cheat.

4772
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:36,600
You can't defend yourself.

4773
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:37,280
Yeah you can't.

4774
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:38,860
You'll be known as a hacker.

4775
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:39,720
Yeah.

4776
02:47:39,820 --> 02:47:39,900
Probably.

4777
02:47:40,220 --> 02:47:50,840
So most like hacker like those like big streamers or like people who are Vtuber who you know who just like hack it just becomes memes.

4778
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:51,940
Yeah yeah.

4779
02:47:51,960 --> 02:47:52,520
It is.

4780
02:47:52,540 --> 02:47:53,640
Oh like destroyer.

4781
02:47:53,660 --> 02:47:54,140
It just turns funny.

4782
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:57,540
You remember like you saw the Apex hack?

4783
02:47:57,840 --> 02:47:58,440
Destroyer?

4784
02:47:58,440 --> 02:47:59,460
I remember that was happening in tournament.

4785
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:00,180
Oh in the tournament?

4786
02:48:00,460 --> 02:48:01,020
Yeah yeah.

4787
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:02,080
And then the guy.

4788
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:03,100
I saw that.

4789
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:04,680
Yeah I was watching it live.

4790
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:06,720
It was actually crazy how that guy.

4791
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:09,780
Yeah that guy like hacked like Hal.

4792
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:15,740
I think the funniest part was when you know like Jen Burning got hacked and then he like instantly left the game.

4793
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:17,340
And then when Hal.

4794
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:19,260
I don't know if you saw it but when Hal got hacked.

4795
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:19,900
I was watching.

4796
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:20,300
Yeah yeah.

4797
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:21,080
Hal got hacked.

4798
02:48:21,100 --> 02:48:23,720
He said I'm hacked.

4799
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:25,460
And then he shot.

4800
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:26,100
He kept shooting.

4801
02:48:26,240 --> 02:48:26,620
He's like.

4802
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:28,560
What if I don't shoot guys?

4803
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:30,040
And then he kept shooting.

4804
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:35,000
It was really funny you know.

4805
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:36,300
It was so funny.

4806
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:38,840
He's like guys I'll just don't shoot.

4807
02:48:39,100 --> 02:48:41,020
And then killed two people.

4808
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:45,440
It was funny you know.

4809
02:48:47,100 --> 02:48:53,000
But it's just the fact that like the guy who like hacked was just there to be like.

4810
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:54,140
It's crazy though.

4811
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:54,820
The guy that hacked.

4812
02:48:55,100 --> 02:48:56,520
Like did you read more about it?

4813
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:57,680
Like he just wanted to like.

4814
02:48:58,540 --> 02:49:01,760
Like be public about it to like the Apex devs and was like.

4815
02:49:01,900 --> 02:49:04,340
Hey guys like you guys need to fix this.

4816
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:06,280
So he's like.

4817
02:49:06,480 --> 02:49:06,920
Really?

4818
02:49:06,920 --> 02:49:07,100
Yeah.

4819
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:07,900
I didn't really know.

02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:08,960
I just heard about like.

4821
02:49:09,180 --> 02:49:11,000
I just saw the video basically.

02:49:11,100 --> 02:49:12,220
He did it for like.

4823
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:12,660
The competition.

4824
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:13,700
Publicity.

4825
02:49:13,700 --> 02:49:14,940
Because he only did it for attention.

4826
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:17,700
Like he because he's done it before.

4827
02:49:17,780 --> 02:49:18,840
He's like hacked people.

4828
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:24,120
He's only hacked pro players to like reveal like security issues.

4829
02:49:24,280 --> 02:49:25,560
And he was like advertising.

4830
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:26,240

Oh here's some security issues.

4833
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:31,480
And like anyway I did that.

4834
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:34,440
And it was just for publicity.

4835
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:35,000
It's crazy.

4836
02:49:35,340 --> 02:49:35,820
Yeah.

4837
02:49:35,900 --> 02:49:36,100
Hmm.

4838
02:49:37,620 --> 02:49:39,360
Yeah it's about sending a message.

4839
02:49:40,580 --> 02:49:41,100
Yeah.

4840
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:41,740
Well.

4841
02:49:42,580 --> 02:49:43,100
Yeah.

4842
02:49:43,780 --> 02:49:45,780
There's a lot of things that needs to be fixed.

02:49:45,860 --> 02:49:46,880

02:50:11,300 --> 02:50:14,060
But like it's so hard to keep the things secret.

4862
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:14,780
Because I actually.

4863
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:15,240
One.

4864
02:50:15,320 --> 02:50:17,160
I almost leaked out the solos mode.

4865
02:50:17,340 --> 02:50:20,000
Like one month before it came out.

4866
02:50:20,660 --> 02:50:23,680
I almost leaked it out on stream.

4867
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:24,760
Because like.

4868
02:50:24,940 --> 02:50:25,420
Um.

I was in a tournament.

4870
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:28,100
I was in an Apex tournament.

4871
02:50:28,460 --> 02:50:30,380
And then we were joking about like.

4872
02:50:30,580 --> 02:50:30,800

02:50:41,560 --> 02:50:42,120
Oh wait.

4885
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:42,800
I can't say that.

4886
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:44,900
I can't talk about solos modes coming back.

4887
02:50:45,080 --> 02:50:45,880
I can't say it.

4888
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:49,500
Oh is it like you're just chatting.

4889
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:50,540
And then like you're.

4890
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:51,480
You're not thinking.

4891
02:50:51,560 --> 02:50:51,960
Yeah.

4892
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:52,400
You're not.

4893
02:50:52,400 --> 02:50:53,140
I'm not thinking.

4894
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:53,780
Because I knew.

4895
02:50:53,860 --> 02:50:54,360

4896
02:50:54,380 --> 02:50:54,660
Oh yeah.

4897
02:50:54,660 --> 02:50:55,160
Solos mode.

4898
02:50:55,260 --> 02:50:57,440
Because I knew about the solos mode that's coming out.

4899
02:50:57,820 --> 02:50:58,200
And then like.

4900
02:50:58,200 --> 02:50:59,200
Like when you think about it.

4901
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:00,080
And your mouth just opens.

4902
02:51:00,080 --> 02:51:00,140
Yeah.

4903
02:51:00,300 --> 02:51:00,900
And I'll just be like.

4904
02:51:00,940 --> 02:51:01,000
Not really.

4905
02:51:01,460 --> 02:51:01,900
Solo.

4906
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:05,240
Be funny.

4907
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:06,300
Haha.

4908
02:51:10,960 --> 02:51:11,700
It's crazy.

4909
02:51:12,280 --> 02:51:12,720
Yeah.

4910
02:51:13,220 --> 02:51:14,200
I'm also scared.

4911
02:51:14,300 --> 02:51:15,580
Like if I knew something.

4912
02:51:15,860 --> 02:51:18,320
I think it'll be really hard to keep it to myself.

4913
02:51:18,480 --> 02:51:20,340
I just have to not think about it.

4914
02:51:20,340 --> 02:51:20,820
I'll just say.

4915
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:22,600
The stuff I know for next season.

4916
02:51:23,100 --> 02:51:23,540
Wow.

4917
02:51:24,020 --> 02:51:24,460
Wow.

4918
02:51:24,460 --> 02:51:24,640
Wow.

4919
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:26,580
God.

4920
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:27,240
Okay.

4921
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:29,140
Don't worry.

4922
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:31,200
I'll cover your voice in life.

4923
02:51:31,400 --> 02:51:32,580
In case you say anything.

4924
02:51:32,780 --> 02:51:34,760
In next season 22.

4925
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:36,780
There's going to be.

4926
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:38,240
Ahhhh.

4927
02:51:39,880 --> 02:51:40,360
Crazy.

4928
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:42,120
Scary.

4929
02:51:42,580 --> 02:51:43,620
That's so scary.

4930
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:44,780
Oh god.

4931
02:51:46,580 --> 02:51:47,200
It's okay.

4932
02:51:47,320 --> 02:51:48,780
I didn't leak anything though.

4933
02:51:48,840 --> 02:51:49,480
I didn't leak anything.

4934
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:51,180
It just almost slipped out.

4935
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:51,660
Because like.

4936
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:52,180
It was just.

4937
02:51:52,580 --> 02:51:53,520
The solo mode.

4938
02:51:53,560 --> 02:51:54,260
The solo mode thing.

4939
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:54,720
Was like.

4940
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:55,940
It was just right there.

4941
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:58,140
It was just right there.

4942
02:52:00,500 --> 02:52:02,480
I almost forgot it never existed.

4943
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:04,880
Yeah I get it.

4944
02:52:04,880 --> 02:52:05,200
So I was like.

4945
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:06,720
Did you get to play Alter?

4946
02:52:06,980 --> 02:52:08,000
Like new?

4947
02:52:08,420 --> 02:52:10,580
Like Apex just updated right?

4948
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:10,900
Yeah.

4949
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:11,080
Yeah.

4950
02:52:11,080 --> 02:52:11,700
I got to play Alter.

4951
02:52:11,720 --> 02:52:12,920
I think Alter is a team.

4952
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:14,540
A team character.

4953
02:52:14,820 --> 02:52:16,300
She's so bad at solos mode.

4954
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:17,740
I hate playing her in solos.

4955
02:52:18,820 --> 02:52:19,860
She has no mobility.

4956
02:52:20,360 --> 02:52:22,320
She has no mobility other than the portal.

4957
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:22,680
So.

4958
02:52:23,200 --> 02:52:23,640
Yeah.

4959
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:25,320
I was playing her yesterday.

4960
02:52:25,580 --> 02:52:26,920
I played her for a while.

4961
02:52:27,140 --> 02:52:27,940
And then I stopped.

4962
02:52:28,260 --> 02:52:28,580
And now.

4963
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:30,280
And then everyone was asking.

4964
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:30,800
Hey.

4965
02:52:31,140 --> 02:52:32,900
Why aren't you playing the new hero?

4966
02:52:32,980 --> 02:52:33,400
I was like.

4967
02:52:33,480 --> 02:52:34,860
I don't want to play her anymore.

4968
02:52:34,860 --> 02:52:35,060
I'm done.

4969
02:52:35,120 --> 02:52:35,520
You're just like.

4970
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:37,120
I'm done playing with you.

4971
02:52:37,300 --> 02:52:37,860
I went back.

4972
02:52:37,900 --> 02:52:38,840
I went back to Wraith.

4973
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:39,440
I was like.

4974
02:52:39,560 --> 02:52:40,000
Okay.

4975
02:52:41,540 --> 02:52:43,960
I think she's really good for team fights.

4976
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:45,920
Apparently she's really good for rank and stuff.

4977
02:52:46,660 --> 02:52:47,100
Because.

4978
02:52:47,280 --> 02:52:49,180
If you're a very aggressive team.

4979
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:50,060
She's really good.

4980
02:52:50,120 --> 02:52:50,640
Because you can like.

4981
02:52:50,660 --> 02:52:52,360
Get to places and do team fights.

4982
02:52:52,600 --> 02:52:53,360
She's basically.

4983
02:52:53,360 --> 02:52:53,680
Like.

4984
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:55,940
You know like the Octane rev jump pad thing.

4985
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:57,040
I like her.

4986
02:52:57,280 --> 02:52:57,720
Yeah.

4987
02:52:57,820 --> 02:52:59,280
I do like her very much.

4988
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:00,360
It's just like.

4989
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:02,280
I was like playing her every single time.

4990
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:02,460
Yeah.

4991
02:53:02,580 --> 02:53:03,100
I was like.

4992
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:03,660
I'm done.

4993
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:04,600
I gotta change it up.

4994
02:53:04,660 --> 02:53:04,960
Perfect.

4995
02:53:05,100 --> 02:53:05,360
Perfect.

4996
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:05,680
Perfect.

4997
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:07,440
I have like.

4998
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:08,080
Do you know.

4999
02:53:08,180 --> 02:53:10,080
I have like a problem with Valkyrie actually.

5000
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:10,800
Like.

5001
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,200
I played her.

5002
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:13,300
I think in the first season.

5003
02:53:13,380 --> 02:53:14,000
I got master.

5004
02:53:14,060 --> 02:53:14,860
Like solo master.

5005
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:15,520
Yeah.

5006
02:53:15,540 --> 02:53:17,520
I used Valkyrie to play.

5007
02:53:17,700 --> 02:53:18,900
Because at the time.

5008
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:20,440
I think it was like.

5009
02:53:20,580 --> 02:53:22,120
I forgot which season it was.

5010
02:53:22,240 --> 02:53:22,560
But like.

5011
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:23,820
Everybody like.

5012
02:53:23,880 --> 02:53:25,200
Playing solo was like hell.

5013
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:26,900
Because everybody just kept like.

5014
02:53:27,560 --> 02:53:28,400
Dying immediately.

5015
02:53:28,840 --> 02:53:29,820
Like going and just dying.

5016
02:53:29,900 --> 02:53:31,360
So you just play Valk and just fly away.

5017
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:31,980
Yeah.

5018
02:53:32,060 --> 02:53:32,840
I would just.

5019
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:33,740
I would just fly away.

5020
02:53:33,860 --> 02:53:34,640
And I'm like bye.

5021
02:53:35,020 --> 02:53:37,120
I'm going right now.

5022
02:53:37,820 --> 02:53:39,420
Because I played her so much.

5023
02:53:39,540 --> 02:53:40,880
I got like sick of her.

5024
02:53:40,940 --> 02:53:41,160
Yeah.

5025
02:53:41,160 --> 02:53:42,560
And I haven't played her until today.

5026
02:53:42,820 --> 02:53:44,220
And it's been like two years.

5027
02:53:44,900 --> 02:53:45,520
It's true.

5028
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:48,260
Like you just get tired of playing the same character.

5029
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:49,500
You just want some variety.

5030
02:53:50,180 --> 02:53:50,620
To.

5031
02:53:50,820 --> 02:53:51,200

Wait.

5043
02:54:03,960 --> 02:54:05,400
Do you know her name in Chinese?

02:54:05,400 --> 02:54:05,580
Wait.

02:54:07,640 --> 02:54:08,500
It's just Valkyrie.

5048
02:54:08,940 --> 02:54:09,300
Yeah.

5049
02:54:09,420 --> 02:54:09,740
Okay.

02:54:10,480 --> 02:54:11,080
And what do you.

No.

5074
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:35,780

Actually.

5077
02:54:37,100 --> 02:54:39,100
People don't really call it.

5078
02:54:39,260 --> 02:54:39,580
Like.

5079
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:40,820
Do you know what they call it?

5080
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:41,460
What do you call it?

5081
02:54:41,740 --> 02:54:42,180

02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:45,620

No.

5268
02:57:36,620 --> 02:57:39,320

02:57:58,360 --> 02:58:00,700
I had to be sure because I'm like...

5286
02:58:00,700 --> 02:58:02,160
They like to say newbie.

5287
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:04,360
I actually have no idea why.

5288
02:58:04,420 --> 02:58:06,340
This is like something I'm taught as well.

5289
02:58:06,440 --> 02:58:08,840
And I'm like wait why do you guys like to say newbie?

5290
02:58:08,940 --> 02:58:09,680
I don't even know why.

5291
02:58:09,940 --> 02:58:10,820
But like...

5292
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:14,500
But like it does mean it's...

5293
02:58:14,500 --> 02:58:15,880
You're like it's great.

5294
02:58:15,980 --> 02:58:16,620
Something is great.

5295
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:17,740
So you can say like...

5296
02:58:17,740 --> 02:58:17,940
Oh.

5297
02:58:18,960 --> 02:58:19,400

5298
02:58:19,700 --> 02:58:20,580
You're Chinese is noob.

02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:22,880
Or you're good at Apex.

5300
02:58:23,060 --> 02:58:25,140
Like you play Apex really well.

5301
02:58:25,440 --> 02:58:25,940
You know it's like that.

5302
02:58:26,200 --> 02:58:28,180
My Chinese is noob.

5303
02:58:29,060 --> 02:58:29,580
Yeah.

5304
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:30,980
It's true.

5305
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:34,760
Yeah.

5306
02:58:34,900 --> 02:58:38,280
A lot of like curse words become like good words as well.

5307
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:41,920
I can...

5308
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:43,580
I can speak Chinese.

5309
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:45,860
It's true.

5310
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:46,700
Do you know there...

5311
02:58:46,700 --> 02:58:47,900
I think there's one more.

5312
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:48,740
It's like...

5313
02:58:48,740 --> 02:58:49,260
Yeah.

5314
02:58:49,260 --> 02:58:51,220
So there's a...

5315
02:58:51,220 --> 02:58:54,080
They like to use English like sounding...

5316
02:58:54,080 --> 02:58:58,100
Like English words that sound like something else in Chinese as well.

5317
02:58:58,220 --> 02:58:58,900
Yeah like what?

5318
02:58:59,140 --> 02:58:59,260
So...

5319
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:01,800
Can I use a...

5320
02:59:01,800 --> 02:59:03,380
Can I teach you a curse one?

5321
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:04,140
A curse word?

5322
02:59:04,320 --> 02:59:04,540
Wait.

5323
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:05,500
Oh okay.

5324
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:06,300
But how curse?

5325
02:59:06,380 --> 02:59:06,600
It's...

5326
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:07,800
It's like...

5327
02:59:09,080 --> 02:59:10,420
So it's this.

5328
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:11,600
I'm gonna put it in chat.

5329
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:14,780
It's not that bad.

5330
02:59:16,260 --> 02:59:16,780
What?

5331
02:59:16,900 --> 02:59:17,540
Not bad but...

5332
02:59:17,540 --> 02:59:19,040
I mean that's what they like to see.

5333
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:20,780
I got taught this.

5334
02:59:20,860 --> 02:59:22,740
Can you try and think of it in your head?

5335
02:59:22,940 --> 02:59:24,540
And like guess what it is?

5336
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:25,160
Wait but like what does it mean?

5337
02:59:25,360 --> 02:59:26,020
Wait what?

5338
02:59:27,240 --> 02:59:28,420
What does it mean?

5339
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:30,800
It's not worse than...

5340
02:59:30,800 --> 02:59:31,200
Than...

5341
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:33,360
So don't worry.

5342
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:34,560
It's basically...

5343
02:59:35,540 --> 02:59:36,580
What does that mean?

5344
02:59:37,340 --> 02:59:38,280
What does it mean?

5345
02:59:39,620 --> 02:59:39,940
It's...

5346
02:59:39,940 --> 02:59:40,820
But it...

5347
02:59:40,820 --> 02:59:41,440
The word...

5348
02:59:41,440 --> 02:59:42,960
The sentence is like...

5349
02:59:42,960 --> 02:59:43,400
Funny...

5350
02:59:43,400 --> 02:59:44,520
Funny mud go pee.

5351
02:59:45,620 --> 02:59:47,540
Funny mud go pee.

5352
02:59:47,800 --> 02:59:48,600
But if you use...

5353
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:51,100
If you use like a Chinese accent to say it's like...

5354
02:59:51,100 --> 02:59:54,480
Funny mud go pee.

5355
02:59:54,940 --> 02:59:56,280
Wait I don't...

5356
02:59:56,280 --> 02:59:59,120
I know that word.

5357
03:00:00,240 --> 03:00:01,440
I know that word.

5358
03:00:05,560 --> 03:00:06,260
I know.

5359
03:00:07,540 --> 03:00:10,060
I know because I've heard it in a movie.

5360
03:00:10,420 --> 03:00:11,400
I've heard it.

5361
03:00:11,400 --> 03:00:12,500
You heard it in a movie?

5362
03:00:12,660 --> 03:00:14,480
I've heard it in a movie.

5363
03:00:17,160 --> 03:00:17,680
Wait.

5364
03:00:17,680 --> 03:00:18,620
And then I'd be like...

5365
03:00:18,620 --> 03:00:20,040
Mom what's that word?

5366
03:00:20,040 --> 03:00:20,160
What?

5367
03:00:20,380 --> 03:00:21,840
And then I'd be like...

5368
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:23,600
We know it's a bad word.

5369
03:00:24,040 --> 03:00:24,580
What?

5370
03:00:25,440 --> 03:00:25,980
What?

5371
03:00:26,540 --> 03:00:27,560
You know like...

5372
03:00:27,560 --> 03:00:31,020
Like watching a movie and they say some very bad words.

5373
03:00:31,080 --> 03:00:31,680
I'd be like...

5374
03:00:32,230 --> 03:00:33,700
Dad what are they saying?

5375
03:00:33,900 --> 03:00:35,080
It's a very bad word.

5376
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:36,720
Yeah.

5377
03:00:38,320 --> 03:00:40,340
It's interesting because like...

5378
03:00:40,340 --> 03:00:40,660
It's...

5379
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:41,680
You know when...

5380
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:43,440
Like they like to like trick...

5381
03:00:43,440 --> 03:00:45,120
I don't know why but like...

5382
03:00:45,120 --> 03:00:47,360
They like to play pranks basically.

5383
03:00:47,560 --> 03:00:49,340
It's not really a harmful one.

5384
03:00:49,340 --> 03:00:50,060
It's just like...

5385
03:00:50,060 --> 03:00:50,920
They like to say...

5386
03:00:50,920 --> 03:00:53,760
They put something in English and you like don't know what it is.

5387
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:54,460
So you're like...

5388
03:00:54,460 --> 03:00:56,520
You read it out loud and people are like...

5389
03:00:56,520 --> 03:00:57,700
Hey don't say that.

5390
03:00:57,900 --> 03:01:00,100
It's like when people are like...

5391
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:02,020
How do you say corn in Cantonese?

5392
03:01:02,180 --> 03:01:03,160
And then I'll be like...

5393
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:06,360
I'm not gonna say corn in Cantonese.

5394
03:01:06,740 --> 03:01:06,860
Why?

5395
03:01:08,480 --> 03:01:09,840
No it's not.

5396
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,920
But it's so stupid.

5397
03:01:13,180 --> 03:01:14,560
It's so stupid.

5398
03:01:15,500 --> 03:01:15,980
Okay.

5399
03:01:15,980 --> 03:01:16,940
So like...

5400
03:01:16,940 --> 03:01:17,220
Okay.

5401
03:01:17,440 --> 03:01:19,540
Guys you didn't got me.

5402
03:01:19,640 --> 03:01:20,640
You didn't got me.

5403
03:01:20,720 --> 03:01:23,960
Okay it's an English joke but they use Cantonese to make you say it.

5404
03:01:24,140 --> 03:01:25,720
But like basically it's like...

5405
03:01:25,720 --> 03:01:28,620
In Cantonese to say corn is...

5406
03:01:28,620 --> 03:01:30,560
And then they'll be like...

5407
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:32,140
You know?

5408
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:32,780
Oh.

5409
03:01:32,860 --> 03:01:33,500
Oh.

5410
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:39,200
Oh I...

5411
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:41,700
So they'll be like...

5412
03:01:41,700 --> 03:01:43,400
So they're like...

5413
03:01:43,400 --> 03:01:44,820
Oh you know Cantonese?

5414
03:01:44,880 --> 03:01:46,800
How do you say corn in Cantonese?

5415
03:01:46,920 --> 03:01:47,720
And they'll be like...

5416
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:49,180
Oh my god suck my nuts.

5417
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:50,180

So it's like similar to that joke.

5421
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:00,140
Yeah it is.

03:02:00,140 --> 03:02:00,980
It is actually.

5423
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:03,580
It's really funny though.

5424
03:02:03,960 --> 03:02:06,080
These kind of things are so interesting.

5425
03:02:06,500 --> 03:02:07,880
Holy shit.

5426
03:02:08,180 --> 03:02:09,420
Languages are so funny.

5427
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:10,560
I know.

5428
03:02:13,420 --> 03:02:15,380
You know Dito right?

5429
03:02:15,480 --> 03:02:17,420
She taught...

5430
03:02:17,420 --> 03:02:18,980
She taught...

5431
03:02:18,980 --> 03:02:21,420
Me... I think Nachan and I both...

5432
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:22,380
Some like...

5433
03:02:22,380 --> 03:02:24,660
Oh some Thai curse words?

5434
03:02:24,840 --> 03:02:26,440
Oh no she taught me too.

5435
03:02:27,160 --> 03:02:27,440
Yeah.

5436
03:02:27,960 --> 03:02:32,160
I have like another friend that knows Thai.

5437
03:02:32,400 --> 03:02:34,460
And I was like hey I know Thai now.

5438
03:02:34,780 --> 03:02:36,420
And she was like...

5439
03:02:36,420 --> 03:02:38,380
How did you learn Thai?

5440
03:02:38,560 --> 03:02:40,080
I was like my friend taught me.

5441
03:02:40,200 --> 03:02:41,920
And then I said those curse words to her.

5442
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:43,660
She was like...

5443
03:02:44,860 --> 03:02:45,760
You're in public by the way.

5444
03:02:45,820 --> 03:02:46,740
And she was like...

5445
03:02:46,740 --> 03:02:49,140
What the hell did you just say?

5446
03:02:49,620 --> 03:02:51,060
I'm not in public.

5447
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:54,740
Yeah it was really...

5448
03:02:54,740 --> 03:02:55,560
It was really bad.

5449
03:02:55,900 --> 03:02:57,240
She had to hide her face.

5450
03:02:57,460 --> 03:02:58,680
She was hiding her face already.

5451
03:02:59,080 --> 03:03:00,760
Stop no.

5452
03:03:02,020 --> 03:03:03,480
I don't know you.

5453
03:03:06,920 --> 03:03:08,680
Knowing lots of languages...

5454
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:09,680
Is really great.

5455
03:03:09,940 --> 03:03:10,280
It is.

5456
03:03:10,280 --> 03:03:10,380
It is.

5457
03:03:12,050 --> 03:03:12,860
Oh yeah.

5458
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,660
It's really funny especially like when you go into public.

5459
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:18,040
And then like somebody's talking in a different language.

5460
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:20,780
That they think people don't understand.

5461
03:03:20,960 --> 03:03:22,000
And they're like gossiping.

5462
03:03:22,060 --> 03:03:22,800
And then you like eavesdrop.

5463
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:24,200
Bro I had that happen.

5464
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:25,900
Oh my god.

5465
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:30,780
Bro I had like a negative experience with that.

5466
03:03:30,920 --> 03:03:31,540
I was like...

5467
03:03:31,540 --> 03:03:34,200
I embarrassed some fucking mom.

5468
03:03:34,420 --> 03:03:35,840
At like my school.

5469
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:38,060
So like I don't remember where.

5470
03:03:38,060 --> 03:03:40,740
I think like I was just eating at a cafeteria.

5471
03:03:41,400 --> 03:03:42,420
And then like...

5472
03:03:42,420 --> 03:03:43,580
I think like...

5473
03:03:43,580 --> 03:03:45,620
The mom and the child...

5474
03:03:45,620 --> 03:03:48,380
The mom came over to give a lunch to one of the kids.

5475
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:51,180
And then like they didn't realize I can speak Cantonese.

5476
03:03:51,340 --> 03:03:52,880
So then she like...

5477
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:54,740
Was gossiping about like...

5478
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:57,880
Oh I think she was like gossiping about my food or something.

5479
03:03:58,360 --> 03:03:59,220
Cause like...

5480
03:03:59,220 --> 03:03:59,680
I don't know.

5481
03:03:59,720 --> 03:04:00,760
Maybe I had like...

5482
03:04:00,760 --> 03:04:02,480
My food looked bad or something.

5483
03:04:02,820 --> 03:04:05,800
And then she was gossiping about it in Cantonese.

5484
03:04:05,880 --> 03:04:06,800
And then I turned around.

5485
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:10,320
And then she was like...

5486
03:04:10,320 --> 03:04:11,420
I know what you're talking about.

5487
03:04:11,580 --> 03:04:12,460
And then she got...

5488
03:04:12,460 --> 03:04:14,020
She like instantly left.

5489
03:04:14,160 --> 03:04:15,220
Like she was so embarrassed.

5490
03:04:15,360 --> 03:04:16,680
And then like left.

5491
03:04:16,960 --> 03:04:18,640
And I was just like...

5492
03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:20,640
I was like...

5493
03:04:21,120 --> 03:04:22,700
She was like...

5494
03:04:22,700 --> 03:04:23,440
I know what you're talking about.

5495
03:04:26,820 --> 03:04:28,940
That must be so embarrassing though.

5496
03:04:28,980 --> 03:04:31,040
I would die of embarrassment honestly.

5497
03:04:31,240 --> 03:04:31,940
If that was me too.

5498
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:33,180
I was like...

5499
03:04:33,180 --> 03:04:34,220
Bro what the fuck.

5500
03:04:38,060 --> 03:04:38,400
Yeah.

5501
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:40,120
It's really funny.

5502
03:04:40,300 --> 03:04:41,680
It's actually really useful.

5503
03:04:41,960 --> 03:04:44,260
It's like you just assume like you don't know.

5504
03:04:44,460 --> 03:04:45,920
And like you're like I know.

5505
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:47,000
Yeah they just don't know.

5506
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:48,440
And then they're like saying...

5507
03:04:48,440 --> 03:04:50,520
Like gossiping in front of you too.

5508
03:04:50,600 --> 03:04:52,540
And then you're just like bro what the fuck.

5509
03:04:52,720 --> 03:04:53,580
I'm just eating.

5510
03:04:57,280 --> 03:04:59,680
It's like if you're gonna gossip in a different language.

5511
03:04:59,800 --> 03:05:01,220
Make sure they don't understand.

5512
03:05:01,540 --> 03:05:03,120
Or you get roasted hard.

5513
03:05:04,140 --> 03:05:06,520
Like maybe don't gossip in front of people.

5514
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:07,560
Like don't...

5515
03:05:08,300 --> 03:05:10,540
You'll never know if they actually know your language.

5516
03:05:10,880 --> 03:05:11,740
I feel like aunties...

5517
03:05:11,740 --> 03:05:14,440
Like moms and grandmas...

5518
03:05:14,440 --> 03:05:15,340
Oh yeah.

5519
03:05:15,380 --> 03:05:16,880
They love the costumes.

5520
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:20,140
Especially if they think the person doesn't know the language.

5521
03:05:20,300 --> 03:05:21,180
They'll just be like...

5522
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:22,920
Oh you know how like...

5523
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:26,060
My mom does this sometimes.

5524
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:27,620
You know like...

5525
03:05:27,620 --> 03:05:29,340
If somebody in front of...

5526
03:05:29,340 --> 03:05:32,160
If there's someone that did something and they didn't like it.

5527
03:05:32,380 --> 03:05:33,980
And they'll just straight up be like...

5528
03:05:33,980 --> 03:05:35,040
Oh my god this person.

5529
03:05:35,780 --> 03:05:38,300
Right in front of them in a different language.

5530
03:05:39,480 --> 03:05:41,480
And then they'll just be like...

5531
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:42,160
Oh hey...

5532
03:05:43,740 --> 03:05:46,000
They must be saying something nice about me.

5533
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:49,240
Yeah.

5534
03:05:49,240 --> 03:05:49,280
Yeah.

5535
03:05:50,900 --> 03:05:51,880
It's so...

5536
03:05:51,880 --> 03:05:54,280
It's really awkward when they're like speaking...

5537
03:05:54,280 --> 03:05:56,320
For example like we're speaking English one moment.

5538
03:05:56,360 --> 03:05:58,140
And suddenly they switch to like...

5539
03:05:58,140 --> 03:05:59,880
They switch language to like...

5540
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:01,780
Cantonese or Chinese or something.

5541
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:04,380
You're like okay they're definitely saying something bad.

5542
03:06:04,540 --> 03:06:04,920
Like...

5543
03:06:05,380 --> 03:06:06,380
Oh my gosh.

5544
03:06:07,020 --> 03:06:08,720
I think I remember like...

5545
03:06:08,720 --> 03:06:10,840
Like I remember like sometimes like...

5546
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:13,240
Cause like in Cantonese sometimes like...

5547
03:06:13,240 --> 03:06:16,180
Cantonese it sounds like we're talking like super harshly.

5548
03:06:16,360 --> 03:06:16,980
But like...

5549
03:06:16,980 --> 03:06:17,960
It's just like a normal...

5550
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:19,240
Like we're just having a normal conversation.

5551
03:06:19,800 --> 03:06:21,040
And I remember like I was like...

5552
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:23,360
I think I was like talking to my parents about something.

5553
03:06:23,500 --> 03:06:25,600
Like something like oh what do I want to eat or something.

5554
03:06:25,960 --> 03:06:28,160
And then like my friend was like...

5555
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:29,160
Are you guys arguing?

5556
03:06:29,440 --> 03:06:30,560
Like why does this sound like...

5557
03:06:30,560 --> 03:06:31,480
Are you guys okay?

5558
03:06:31,800 --> 03:06:33,180
And I was like yeah I was just ordering food.

5559
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:36,740
And then like my friend was like...

5560
03:06:36,740 --> 03:06:37,160
Are you guys arguing?

5561
03:06:37,160 --> 03:06:38,380
And I was like yeah I was just ordering food.

5562
03:06:38,820 --> 03:06:40,540
And then like my friend was like yeah I was just ordering food.

5563
03:06:40,540 --> 03:06:42,520
Yeah I do feel like...

5564
03:06:42,520 --> 03:06:44,840
Cantonese and Chinese does sound like...

5565
03:06:44,840 --> 03:06:46,320
I think if you don't know the language...

5566
03:06:46,320 --> 03:06:48,020
It sounds a little bit like aggressive.

5567
03:06:48,200 --> 03:06:50,520
But actually it's just how you say the words.

5568
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:51,960
Yeah it's just like the intonation.

5569
03:06:52,420 --> 03:06:52,900
Yeah.

5570
03:06:54,160 --> 03:06:58,160
It just sounds aggressive to people who don't understand.

5571
03:06:58,620 --> 03:06:59,140
It just sounds aggressive to people who don't understand.

5572
03:06:59,700 --> 03:07:00,680
It's just...

5573
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:02,320
Is there any other...

5574
03:07:02,320 --> 03:07:04,360
I think other languages as well.

5575
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:06,720
Like you just don't understand what they're saying.

5576
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:08,040
But it just sounds aggressive.

5577
03:07:08,140 --> 03:07:10,520
But actually they're talking about like...

5578
03:07:10,520 --> 03:07:11,740
Totally normal things.

5579
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:16,020
Yeah it's actually so funny when people who don't understand...

5580
03:07:16,020 --> 03:07:16,140
Yeah it's actually so funny when people who don't understand...

5581
03:07:16,140 --> 03:07:17,140
Are they arguing?

5582
03:07:17,420 --> 03:07:18,120
I'm like no.

5583
03:07:18,700 --> 03:07:20,700
I'm just having a conversation.

5584
03:07:21,640 --> 03:07:22,820
I'm just having a conversation.

5585
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:24,620
Oh my god.

5586
03:07:24,820 --> 03:07:26,000
Have you guys watched any like...

5587
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:27,500
Chinese movies?

5588
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:31,360
Like animation... like pop culture Chinese movies?

5589
03:07:32,280 --> 03:07:34,780
Like animation... like pop culture Chinese movies?

5590
03:07:34,780 --> 03:07:37,020
Like famous ones.

5591
03:07:37,580 --> 03:07:38,900
Cause I was like thinking...

5592
03:07:38,900 --> 03:07:39,960
Do you know about Matau?

5593
03:07:40,360 --> 03:07:41,280
Or Matol?

5594
03:07:41,820 --> 03:07:42,920
But I think that's like...

5595
03:07:43,540 --> 03:07:45,400
Matau is like more Hong Kong though.

5596
03:07:46,440 --> 03:07:48,340
It's like really popular in Hong Kong.

5597
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:51,200
What's that?

5598
03:07:51,260 --> 03:07:51,740
You know Matau?

5599
03:07:51,900 --> 03:07:53,680
It's like a story about pig.

5600
03:07:54,640 --> 03:07:55,200
Um...

5601
03:07:56,560 --> 03:07:57,120
And...

5602
03:07:57,120 --> 03:08:00,520
I know cause like...

5603
03:08:00,520 --> 03:08:03,040
I sort of like grew up with Matau.

5604
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:04,760
And it's like... um...

5605
03:08:05,420 --> 03:08:05,980
Um...

5606
03:08:06,780 --> 03:08:08,380
It's like talking about like...

5607
03:08:09,480 --> 03:08:10,960
It's talking about like...

5608
03:08:10,960 --> 03:08:11,580
A pig.

5609
03:08:11,880 --> 03:08:14,060
But it's like a pig growing up.

5610
03:08:14,280 --> 03:08:16,220
When like growing up in Hong Kong.

5611
03:08:16,580 --> 03:08:17,480
And it's like...

5612
03:08:17,480 --> 03:08:21,100
It's like super memorable because it has...

5613
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:21,860
Uh...

5614
03:08:21,860 --> 03:08:24,380
Because it has like a very memorable song.

5615
03:08:24,580 --> 03:08:28,000
And also like there was a scene about ordering food and stuff.

5616
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:30,060
But like I think it might be too...

5617
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:32,040
It's just like...

5618
03:08:32,040 --> 03:08:33,640
I don't think you would know.

5619
03:08:33,660 --> 03:08:34,220
It's old?

5620
03:08:34,780 --> 03:08:35,200
It's not old!

5621
03:08:35,740 --> 03:08:38,120
It's not everything I say is old!

5622
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:39,320
Okay.

5623
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:41,540
Is it too...

5624
03:08:42,320 --> 03:08:44,300
Probably because I don't know Cantonese.

5625
03:08:44,640 --> 03:08:44,960
Yeah.

5626
03:08:45,380 --> 03:08:46,460
I know it's like...

5627
03:08:46,460 --> 03:08:47,260
It's also...

5628
03:08:49,380 --> 03:08:51,120
It's very popular in Hong Kong.

5629
03:08:51,380 --> 03:08:52,620
But I know that...

5630
03:08:52,620 --> 03:08:54,680
It's also popular outside of Hong Kong.

5631
03:08:54,800 --> 03:08:56,100
But I don't know if you've watched it before.

5632
03:08:56,740 --> 03:08:57,940
It's not old!

5633
03:08:58,300 --> 03:08:59,560
It's pretty old to be honest.

5634
03:08:59,640 --> 03:09:00,200
No it's not!

5635
03:09:01,100 --> 03:09:02,700
Stop saying it's old!

5636
03:09:04,780 --> 03:09:05,200
Is it?

5637
03:09:05,400 --> 03:09:09,100
The last movie was in 2016 guys!

5638
03:09:10,580 --> 03:09:11,300
Whoa!

5639
03:09:11,580 --> 03:09:12,700
Eight years ago!

5640
03:09:13,440 --> 03:09:16,400
Okay the first movie was in 2001.

5641
03:09:16,980 --> 03:09:18,580
But like we don't...

5642
03:09:18,580 --> 03:09:19,300
Wait!

5643
03:09:19,360 --> 03:09:20,140
That's like...

5644
03:09:20,140 --> 03:09:20,880
Oh god!

5645
03:09:21,280 --> 03:09:22,060
It's not!

5646
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:23,180
It's not!

5647
03:09:23,360 --> 03:09:24,000
Nooooo!

5648
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:30,320
I have not...

5649
03:09:30,320 --> 03:09:31,660
I have not seen that.

5650
03:09:31,660 --> 03:09:32,320
You never...

5651
03:09:32,320 --> 03:09:34,600
Honestly it's a good movie actually.

5652
03:09:34,980 --> 03:09:36,000
I think it's...

5653
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,820
I think it was a really good childhood movie.

5654
03:09:39,320 --> 03:09:41,120
I didn't watch it in theaters!

5655
03:09:41,280 --> 03:09:42,960
I watched it on the DVD!

5656
03:09:43,560 --> 03:09:45,900
When my parents bought me a DVD!

5657
03:09:48,620 --> 03:09:49,580
Okay guys!

5658
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:51,340
It's not that old!

5659
03:09:52,060 --> 03:09:53,380
When I watched it!

5660
03:09:53,580 --> 03:09:55,840
VIP seats again!

5661
03:09:56,940 --> 03:10:00,040
I didn't even get to watch it in the theaters!

5662
03:10:00,620 --> 03:10:01,640
I watched it in theaters!

5663
03:10:01,660 --> 03:10:02,360
As a DVD!

5664
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:07,400
Because I was not old enough to watch it in the theaters!

5665
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:11,360
Because I was not old enough to watch it in the theaters!

5666
03:10:11,360 --> 03:10:14,000
Because I was not old enough to watch it in the theaters!

5667
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,040
DVD Boomer!

5668
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:20,300
Who watches DVDs anymore?

5669
03:10:20,520 --> 03:10:21,160

5670
03:10:22,380 --> 03:10:23,020

5671
03:10:23,620 --> 03:10:26,100
Yeah I haven't seen a DVD in years!

5672
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:26,720
That's so true!

5673
03:10:27,340 --> 03:10:31,460
My PC doesn't even have a CD or DVD slot anymore.

5674
03:10:31,660 --> 03:10:33,440
Why did they stop that?

5675
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:35,140
They stopped that in so long!

5676
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:36,860
I don't know.

5677
03:10:37,020 --> 03:10:37,920
I also don't know.

5678
03:10:38,060 --> 03:10:39,660
I think...

5679
03:10:40,640 --> 03:10:43,240
I still had like...

5680
03:10:43,240 --> 03:10:44,900
Anime DVDs.

5681
03:10:45,520 --> 03:10:49,840
I was like into anime when I was young too.

5682
03:10:49,940 --> 03:10:50,920
But like...

5683
03:10:50,920 --> 03:10:53,180
I didn't know what anime is what.

5684
03:10:53,360 --> 03:10:55,020
And you know there's a lot of those like...

5685
03:10:55,470 --> 03:10:56,900

5688
03:10:58,360 --> 03:11:01,540
You know...

5689
03:11:01,540 --> 03:11:04,080
One guy, 100 girls kind of anime.

5690
03:11:04,500 --> 03:11:04,860
No!

5691
03:11:05,120 --> 03:11:06,320
That's pretty sus.

5692
03:11:07,420 --> 03:11:09,800
I don't know those kinds because I'm...

5693
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:12,140
Wait really?

5694
03:11:12,460 --> 03:11:13,600
I am here.

5695
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:15,860
It's not like...

5696
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:17,300
It's not like R18.

5697
03:11:17,500 --> 03:11:19,380
But you know it was like...

5698
03:11:19,380 --> 03:11:20,120
Kind of like...

5699
03:11:20,120 --> 03:11:22,980
The body would come...

5700
03:11:23,800 --> 03:11:24,600
And like...

5701
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:26,320
And like I was like...

5702
03:11:26,320 --> 03:11:29,260
I remember there was like DVD and I was like really young at the time.

5703
03:11:29,400 --> 03:11:30,240
And then like I was...

5704
03:11:30,240 --> 03:11:32,180
I would go with my mom to like look at the DVD.

5705
03:11:32,620 --> 03:11:34,360
And like we bought...

5706
03:11:34,360 --> 03:11:36,420
Like we bought one.

5707
03:11:36,660 --> 03:11:38,160
And it was...

5708
03:11:38,160 --> 03:11:39,220
I think I can say the name.

5709
03:11:39,280 --> 03:11:41,660
It was like a Rosario Vampire.

5710
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:42,360
Do you know that?

5711
03:11:44,060 --> 03:11:46,100
No I don't think so because I think I'm too...

5712
03:11:46,100 --> 03:11:46,680
Rosario Vampire.

5713
03:11:46,800 --> 03:11:48,020
Maybe I know the picture.

5714
03:11:48,200 --> 03:11:52,620
It was Rosario Vampire.

5715
03:11:52,620 --> 03:11:53,800
And I did...

5716
03:11:54,600 --> 03:11:56,240
It looked like very cute at first.

5717
03:11:56,340 --> 03:11:58,220
Because I was like oh it's a pink hair girl.

5718
03:11:58,360 --> 03:11:59,120
It looks so nice.

5719
03:11:59,160 --> 03:11:59,860
Oh it looks cute.

5720
03:12:00,200 --> 03:12:00,620
Yeah.

5721
03:12:01,720 --> 03:12:05,600
Okay so I got tricked by the cover of it.

5722
03:12:05,720 --> 03:12:07,960
Like there's nothing weird about the cover by the way.

5723
03:12:08,080 --> 03:12:09,400
So I bought it.

5724
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:11,300
And like took it home.

5725
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:13,500
And like I was watching it with my mom by the way.

5726
03:12:13,740 --> 03:12:14,280
And like...

5727
03:12:14,280 --> 03:12:15,680
We were both sitting there.

5728
03:12:16,100 --> 03:12:18,640
And like the first...

5729
03:12:18,640 --> 03:12:21,040
I think the first episode or something.

5730
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:24,520
The guy like fell into the girl's like chest.

5731
03:12:24,540 --> 03:12:24,580
And like...

5732
03:12:24,600 --> 03:12:26,440
And my mom was like...

5733
03:12:26,440 --> 03:12:27,740
Oh god no.

5734
03:12:28,140 --> 03:12:29,060
Oh no.

5735
03:12:29,560 --> 03:12:30,700
Oh no.

5736
03:12:32,320 --> 03:12:34,300
It was like crazy.

5737
03:12:34,880 --> 03:12:35,540
And like...

5738
03:12:35,540 --> 03:12:39,020
My mom immediately like stopped the like DVD.

5739
03:12:39,340 --> 03:12:40,340
And she was like okay.

5740
03:12:40,500 --> 03:12:42,360
When you're older you can watch this.

5741
03:12:42,760 --> 03:12:43,720
And I was like...

5742
03:12:44,360 --> 03:12:44,680
Why?

5743
03:12:45,200 --> 03:12:47,180
Why can't I watch it?

5744
03:12:47,240 --> 03:12:48,120
I just bought it.

5745
03:12:48,240 --> 03:12:49,900
And she was like this is not for kids.

5746
03:12:51,540 --> 03:12:52,180
Yeah.

5747
03:12:52,180 --> 03:12:53,140
And I was like...

5748
03:12:53,140 --> 03:12:54,640
I got stopped.

5749
03:12:54,960 --> 03:12:55,860
Oh no.

5750
03:12:58,140 --> 03:13:00,560
You stay here for a little longer.

5751
03:13:01,620 --> 03:13:02,120
Yeah.

5752
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:04,260
But then I secretly went with my like grandfather.

5753
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:05,780
To buy like another DVD.

5754
03:13:06,100 --> 03:13:07,080
Oh my god they watched it.

5755
03:13:07,140 --> 03:13:08,680
But I bought a different one this time.

5756
03:13:08,820 --> 03:13:09,840
I bought Chobits.

5757
03:13:10,060 --> 03:13:12,240
Wait is it Chobits also...

5758
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:14,120
I know Chobits but I never watched it.

5759
03:13:14,140 --> 03:13:15,080
But is it also similar?

5760
03:13:15,580 --> 03:13:16,940
It just looks cute.

5761
03:13:16,940 --> 03:13:18,780
It does look cute.

5762
03:13:18,780 --> 03:13:19,720
Like honestly...

5763
03:13:20,880 --> 03:13:22,180
Chobits looks so like...

5764
03:13:22,180 --> 03:13:23,820
The girl like Chi.

5765
03:13:24,040 --> 03:13:24,740
Her name is Chi.

5766
03:13:24,980 --> 03:13:27,100
And she looks very cute on the cover.

5767
03:13:27,240 --> 03:13:28,660
And I was like oh this is so cute.

5768
03:13:28,880 --> 03:13:30,020
And I bought it as well.

5769
03:13:30,300 --> 03:13:32,980
And like I started watching it.

5770
03:13:33,020 --> 03:13:33,620
I was like no.

5771
03:13:34,140 --> 03:13:34,920
Oh no.

5772
03:13:35,120 --> 03:13:36,200
What does this mean?

5773
03:13:38,100 --> 03:13:39,500
What is she doing?

5774
03:13:39,740 --> 03:13:42,500
And then I knew like oh god they're showing their body again.

5775
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:43,980
I can't let my mom find out.

5776
03:13:46,940 --> 03:13:49,100
I was like what does this mean?

5777
03:13:50,200 --> 03:13:51,520
And then I looked it up.

5778
03:13:51,520 --> 03:13:52,760
Oh my gosh the beach episode.

5779
03:13:52,980 --> 03:13:53,200
Oh no.

5780
03:13:55,680 --> 03:13:57,280
Everyday was the beach episode.

5781
03:13:57,540 --> 03:13:58,020
Everyday.

5782
03:13:58,420 --> 03:13:58,900
Yeah.

5783
03:14:00,640 --> 03:14:02,060
That reminded me.

5784
03:14:02,620 --> 03:14:04,200
Oh my gosh I don't know how to pronounce it.

5785
03:14:04,880 --> 03:14:06,720
Let me google this.

5786
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:07,460
Real fast.

5787
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:09,800
There's like the famous dance.

5788
03:14:09,940 --> 03:14:11,700
The Caramella...

5789
03:14:11,700 --> 03:14:12,900
Is it the Caramella dance?

5790
03:14:12,900 --> 03:14:14,280
Oh can you know the Caramella dance?

5791
03:14:15,320 --> 03:14:16,300
Oh yeah.

5792
03:14:16,640 --> 03:14:20,040
You know that dance right?

5793
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:20,320
Yeah I do.

5794
03:14:20,320 --> 03:14:21,940
You know the origin of that dance right?

5795
03:14:22,280 --> 03:14:25,200
I found that out recently.

5796
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:28,180
Okay for those who don't know.

5797
03:14:28,360 --> 03:14:29,060
The dance.

5798
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:33,960
The origin of that dance.

5799
03:14:34,360 --> 03:14:35,000
Is.

5800
03:14:38,220 --> 03:14:39,200
It's not.

5801
03:14:39,440 --> 03:14:40,160
It's not.

5802
03:14:40,520 --> 03:14:41,820
It's 18 plus.

5803
03:14:41,960 --> 03:14:42,640
Let's just say.

5804
03:14:42,640 --> 03:14:43,500
Really?

5805
03:14:43,940 --> 03:14:45,440
Wait really?

5806
03:14:45,560 --> 03:14:46,480
I didn't know that.

5807
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:47,720
Wait you didn't know that?

5808
03:14:47,820 --> 03:14:48,660
What did you know?

5809
03:14:49,680 --> 03:14:51,460
I just knew about the cute.

5810
03:14:51,600 --> 03:14:53,300
The one that they dance all the time.

5811
03:14:53,400 --> 03:14:55,340
The old video.

5812
03:14:55,660 --> 03:14:56,920
Where the girls are just dancing.

5813
03:14:57,440 --> 03:15:02,660
The origin of it was that the dance came from a porn game.

5814
03:15:03,460 --> 03:15:03,720
Oh!

5815
03:15:05,180 --> 03:15:06,120
Wait really?

5816
03:15:07,060 --> 03:15:08,780
Yes I found out.

5817
03:15:09,680 --> 03:15:10,920

5818
03:15:11,140 --> 03:15:11,400
Like.

5819
03:15:12,640 --> 03:15:13,820
A couple of months ago.

5820
03:15:14,080 --> 03:15:15,160
Cause people were like talking.

5821
03:15:15,220 --> 03:15:17,160
Do you guys remember this dance?

5822
03:15:18,300 --> 03:15:19,260
Oh sorry.

5823
03:15:19,440 --> 03:15:21,720
A porn visual novel.

5824
03:15:22,140 --> 03:15:22,660
Which.

5825
03:15:23,920 --> 03:15:26,060
Thank you for correcting me.

5826
03:15:26,340 --> 03:15:26,880

5827
03:15:26,940 --> 03:15:27,580
Yeah.

5828
03:15:29,600 --> 03:15:31,660
It was like the opening scene.

5829
03:15:31,780 --> 03:15:33,600
For like the opening intro.

5830
03:15:33,720 --> 03:15:34,680
For that game.

5831
03:15:35,660 --> 03:15:38,500
It's so weird that people took that dance.

5832
03:15:38,720 --> 03:15:40,300
When the origin of the game.

5833
03:15:40,500 --> 03:15:41,940
When the game came out.

5834
03:15:42,640 --> 03:15:44,160
It was like innocent.

5835
03:15:44,160 --> 03:15:45,340
Like in the video I saw.

5836
03:15:45,560 --> 03:15:48,580
They were just doing like a cute little dance.

5837
03:15:48,780 --> 03:15:49,140
I'm like.

5838
03:15:49,660 --> 03:15:50,220
Really?

5839
03:15:51,940 --> 03:15:52,500
Yeah.

5840
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:55,660
I'm about to google.

5841
03:15:55,780 --> 03:15:57,120
Carmel dance in origin.

5842
03:15:57,260 --> 03:15:57,580
You know?

5843
03:16:00,940 --> 03:16:02,380

5844
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:04,700
Yeah it is.

5845
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:05,140
Oh wait.

5846
03:16:06,420 --> 03:16:07,420
I'm kind of like.

5847
03:16:07,620 --> 03:16:10,660
My experience with it is kind of like.

5848
03:16:10,660 --> 03:16:11,900
Gone right now.

5849
03:16:13,880 --> 03:16:15,660
I thought it was really cute.

5850
03:16:15,940 --> 03:16:17,220
I just thought it was cute.

5851
03:16:17,400 --> 03:16:18,560
Now I'm thinking damn.

5852
03:16:18,980 --> 03:16:19,580
Oh my god.

5853
03:16:20,760 --> 03:16:21,620
This is the.

5854
03:16:21,880 --> 03:16:22,860
I'm not going to.

5855
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,340
I don't know if my mod should like.

5856
03:16:26,380 --> 03:16:26,860
Like.

5857
03:16:28,100 --> 03:16:29,540
Give the name of the.

5858
03:16:29,660 --> 03:16:31,200
This is the visual novel.

5859
03:16:31,500 --> 03:16:33,140
This is the visual novel.

5860
03:16:35,620 --> 03:16:36,860
If I google that.

5861
03:16:37,420 --> 03:16:37,900
Someone.

5862
03:16:38,400 --> 03:16:40,060
Someone in my chat was like.

5863
03:16:40,660 --> 03:16:41,460
What is it called?

5864
03:16:41,560 --> 03:16:41,880
Erogue.

5865
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:44,440
Yeah ergo.

5866
03:16:44,580 --> 03:16:46,040
Oh my god.

5867
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:48,660
My google chrome is telling me.

5868
03:16:48,680 --> 03:16:49,340
Safe search.

5869
03:16:52,580 --> 03:16:54,220
Your chrome is like.

5870
03:16:54,420 --> 03:16:56,420
It's trying to save you.

5871
03:16:56,520 --> 03:16:56,820
They're like.

5872
03:16:57,060 --> 03:16:58,040
I don't know.

5873
03:16:58,700 --> 03:17:01,780
Safe search is on.

5874
03:17:04,620 --> 03:17:05,600
Oh no.

5875
03:17:08,460 --> 03:17:09,120
Wait.

5876
03:17:10,660 --> 03:17:10,920
Wait.

5877
03:17:12,300 --> 03:17:14,100
But it looks so cute.

5878
03:17:14,280 --> 03:17:15,100
Is this an ergo?

5879
03:17:15,280 --> 03:17:15,720
Really?

5880
03:17:16,020 --> 03:17:17,560
It looks so cute though.

5881
03:17:18,080 --> 03:17:22,420
For my research purposes.

5882
03:17:22,940 --> 03:17:24,520
Yes it is not.

5883
03:17:24,680 --> 03:17:26,580
It's not just that.

5884
03:17:27,100 --> 03:17:27,700
I was like.

5885
03:17:27,860 --> 03:17:28,740
There's no way.

5886
03:17:28,920 --> 03:17:31,960
Just like you I was innocent and pure.

5887
03:17:32,240 --> 03:17:33,160
And I was like there's no way.

5888
03:17:33,520 --> 03:17:34,800
And then I looked further.

5889
03:17:35,160 --> 03:17:35,980
And I was like oh.

5890
03:17:36,900 --> 03:17:37,500
Wait.

5891
03:17:37,520 --> 03:17:37,880
No.

5892
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:42,680
But it looks so innocent.

5893
03:17:43,060 --> 03:17:44,300
Like the first few images.

5894
03:17:44,400 --> 03:17:44,920
Totally.

5895
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:45,740
It looks normal.

5896
03:17:46,120 --> 03:17:47,080
It just looks like.

5897
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:49,340
It just looks like an old anime.

5898
03:17:50,600 --> 03:17:51,160
Wait.

5899
03:17:51,260 --> 03:17:52,600
Is the same character designer.

5900
03:17:52,720 --> 03:17:54,600
As the Monogatari series.

5901
03:17:54,860 --> 03:17:55,220
Wait.

5902
03:17:55,480 --> 03:17:56,040
Really?

5903
03:17:57,380 --> 03:17:58,960
Oh my god.

5904
03:17:59,040 --> 03:17:59,960
Wait I think it.

5905
03:18:00,080 --> 03:18:01,560
Oh my god it is.

5906
03:18:02,280 --> 03:18:04,540
It's the same character designer.

5907
03:18:06,400 --> 03:18:07,520
Oh my god.

5908
03:18:08,300 --> 03:18:10,140
Did you watch Monogatari?

5909
03:18:10,660 --> 03:18:11,340
No I didn't.

5910
03:18:11,440 --> 03:18:12,900
But I know about the show.

5911
03:18:13,320 --> 03:18:14,640
And it was super famous.

5912
03:18:14,960 --> 03:18:17,100
Do you know there's like a tongue twister in that one?

5913
03:18:17,200 --> 03:18:17,920
I really like that.

5914
03:18:17,920 --> 03:18:19,740
Oh is it the Nyan.

5915
03:18:20,660 --> 03:18:21,380
Yeah yeah yeah.

5916
03:18:22,680 --> 03:18:24,920
Let me try.

5917
03:18:25,300 --> 03:18:27,140
Can you say it?

5918
03:18:27,320 --> 03:18:28,880
I know I cannot say it.

5919
03:18:28,880 --> 03:18:29,340
I used to say it.

5920
03:18:29,640 --> 03:18:31,720
Like Baketono.

5921
03:18:33,100 --> 03:18:34,180
Tongue twister.

5922
03:18:34,620 --> 03:18:36,240
Yeah it's right there.

5923
03:18:36,240 --> 03:18:37,020
Umm.

5924
03:18:38,560 --> 03:18:40,120
Yeah it's this one.

5925
03:18:40,380 --> 03:18:40,940
Say it.

5926
03:18:43,200 --> 03:18:46,040
Naname nanaji o nanadono.

5927
03:18:46,360 --> 03:18:48,340
Narabide nakunaku.

5928
03:18:48,980 --> 03:18:51,600
Ina nakuna nanan.

5929
03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:53,580
Nanadai nanaku.

5930
03:18:54,040 --> 03:18:56,180
Narabete naganagame.

5931
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:58,840
I'm pretty sure I butchered that.

5932
03:19:02,080 --> 03:19:03,560
I'm pretty sure I butchered that.

5933
03:19:03,560 --> 03:19:03,600
Cute.

5934
03:19:04,300 --> 03:19:04,580
Cute.

5935
03:19:06,580 --> 03:19:06,980
Okay.

5936
03:19:07,240 --> 03:19:08,340
How do you...

5937
03:19:09,420 --> 03:19:10,020
I'll try.

5938
03:19:10,380 --> 03:19:12,760
I remember I used to be able to do it.

5939
03:19:12,820 --> 03:19:13,900
I don't know if I can do it now.

5940
03:19:14,820 --> 03:19:14,860
Like.

5941
03:19:15,820 --> 03:19:17,400
Naname nanaji o nanadono.

5942
03:19:17,520 --> 03:19:18,500
Narabide nakunaku.

5943
03:19:18,600 --> 03:19:19,520
Ina nakunanana.

5944
03:19:20,820 --> 03:19:21,620
Nanakunarabe nanaganame.

5945
03:19:23,600 --> 03:19:24,460
Oh my god.

5946
03:19:24,560 --> 03:19:26,020
Oh and then you replace all the...

5947
03:19:26,020 --> 03:19:27,580
Oh yeah you replace all the na's with nya.

5948
03:19:29,560 --> 03:19:30,360
Nyananame nyananame.

5949
03:19:30,740 --> 03:19:32,280
Nyaname nyananame.

5950
03:19:36,240 --> 03:19:37,340
I cannot do it.

5951
03:19:37,340 --> 03:19:38,940
I cannot do it.

5952
03:19:38,940 --> 03:19:40,800
You should be able to do it because you're a cat.

5953
03:19:41,700 --> 03:19:42,680
A cat girl.

5954
03:19:43,860 --> 03:19:44,740
I mouth.

5955
03:19:47,780 --> 03:19:49,100
We've been like chatting.

5956
03:19:49,400 --> 03:19:52,320
Like an English thing.

5957
03:19:53,100 --> 03:19:59,180
For me I'm like going like when I'm talking in English like my brain is like fully in English.

5958
03:19:59,300 --> 03:20:01,780
And when I'm talking in Chinese I'm talking fully in Chinese.

5959
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:03,620
When I'm talking in Japanese I'm fully in Japanese.

5960
03:20:03,940 --> 03:20:05,600
Actually I can multitask you know.

5961
03:20:05,860 --> 03:20:07,840
I'm really bad at multitasking.

5962
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:08,320
Oh me too.

5963
03:20:08,960 --> 03:20:09,940
I'm really bad.

5964
03:20:10,180 --> 03:20:13,220
Like I tried before to like multitask.

5965
03:20:13,720 --> 03:20:14,820
And I just failed.

5966
03:20:15,140 --> 03:20:15,860
I was like...

5967
03:20:15,860 --> 03:20:16,840
No.

5968
03:20:17,700 --> 03:20:19,420
What did you try to do?

5969
03:20:20,860 --> 03:20:22,420
No like anything.

5970
03:20:22,680 --> 03:20:25,220
Like whenever I tried multitask.

5971
03:20:25,260 --> 03:20:26,140
I just like...

5972
03:20:26,140 --> 03:20:26,920
I can't.

5973
03:20:27,060 --> 03:20:27,840
I just can't.

5974
03:20:27,880 --> 03:20:28,960
Yeah then it's just too much.

5975
03:20:29,600 --> 03:20:30,280
Nya.

5976
03:20:31,100 --> 03:20:31,780
Nya.

5977
03:20:33,740 --> 03:20:34,420
Nya.

5978
03:20:34,420 --> 03:20:34,580
Nya.

5979
03:20:36,220 --> 03:20:37,800
I have a bad...

5980
03:20:37,800 --> 03:20:40,140
Do you know I used to have a really bad habit?

5981
03:20:40,620 --> 03:20:43,700
Like I would actually do that by the way.

5982
03:20:43,720 --> 03:20:45,000
Like unironically.

5983
03:20:45,300 --> 03:20:46,640
Just be like Nya.

5984
03:20:47,240 --> 03:20:49,560
Just have that cat accent.

5985
03:20:49,720 --> 03:20:50,960
Like unironically.

5986
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:52,820
Not even Vtuber by the way.

5987
03:20:52,980 --> 03:20:53,780
Like I go live.

5988
03:20:53,780 --> 03:20:56,260
Just like out in public and you're like you wanna do this?

5989
03:20:56,360 --> 03:20:56,680
Nya.

5990
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:00,020
Yeah it was...

5991
03:21:00,020 --> 03:21:00,860
Like that.

5992
03:21:00,940 --> 03:21:01,880
It's really bad.

5993
03:21:02,100 --> 03:21:03,360
It's really bad though.

5994
03:21:04,420 --> 03:21:05,040
You did the thing.

5995
03:21:05,400 --> 03:21:09,480
I like trained myself to like stop it basically.

5996
03:21:09,740 --> 03:21:11,480
Because it was really embarrassing.

5997
03:21:11,780 --> 03:21:12,740
Like a long time.

5998
03:21:13,060 --> 03:21:15,620
Did she just Nya?

5999
03:21:16,360 --> 03:21:16,920
Yeah.

6000
03:21:17,720 --> 03:21:18,280
Yeah.

6001
03:21:18,640 --> 03:21:19,200
Yeah.

6002
03:21:21,960 --> 03:21:23,080
And yeah.

6003
03:21:23,640 --> 03:21:25,500
It was really really bad.

6004
03:21:25,640 --> 03:21:27,960
Like before I went to Bilibili as well.

6005
03:21:28,520 --> 03:21:30,120
But yeah it was really really bad.

6006
03:21:30,120 --> 03:21:30,960
I know your chat loves it though.

6007
03:21:31,060 --> 03:21:32,140
Your chat will be like do it again.

6008
03:21:32,620 --> 03:21:32,840
You know.

6009
03:21:32,920 --> 03:21:34,400
Like she did the thing.

6010
03:21:35,660 --> 03:21:36,220
Yeah.

6011
03:21:36,440 --> 03:21:39,540
But I did my best to like stop myself.

6012
03:21:39,740 --> 03:21:46,280
I would end my sentence with like Nya as well sometimes.

6013
03:21:46,500 --> 03:21:46,860
Oh.

6014
03:21:48,060 --> 03:21:50,780
Like not even thinking by the way.

6015
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:51,780
It was really bad.

6016
03:21:52,060 --> 03:21:53,120
Like I don't know why.

6017
03:21:53,320 --> 03:21:55,020
What happened to me.

6018
03:21:55,240 --> 03:21:57,080
Yeah you just couldn't help yourself.

6019
03:21:58,160 --> 03:21:58,720
Yeah.

6020
03:21:59,420 --> 03:21:59,980
Nya.

6021

03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:03,100
Oh no you're looping.

6023
03:22:03,100 --> 03:22:06,040
It happens when I'm like not thinking by the way.

6024
03:22:06,120 --> 03:22:07,000
That's the problem.

6025
03:22:07,840 --> 03:22:08,400
Yeah.

6026
03:22:08,860 --> 03:22:10,060

You know we've been talking for more than three hours.

6033
03:22:25,320 --> 03:22:27,320
How much Chinese have we talked?

6034
03:22:28,140 --> 03:22:28,920
That's crazy.

6035
03:22:28,920 --> 03:22:30,140
That's the important part here.

6036
03:22:30,980 --> 03:22:31,580
Okay.

6037
03:22:32,780 --> 03:22:34,600
We don't look at percentages.

6038
03:22:34,780 --> 03:22:35,380
Okay.

6039
03:22:35,460 --> 03:22:38,200
We don't look at the percentages and the stats.

6040
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:41,640
Do you want to fight?

6041
03:22:41,640 --> 03:22:44,020
My title said I try.

6042
03:22:44,220 --> 03:22:45,500

Okay.

6049
03:23:01,740 --> 03:23:02,940

We're speaking Chinese.

6051
03:23:06,260 --> 03:23:08,560
But we've been talking for a long time.

6052
03:23:09,220 --> 03:23:11,200
We've been talking for too long.

6053
03:23:11,420 --> 03:23:12,460
Too long?

6054
03:23:12,740 --> 03:23:13,240
What's long?

6055
03:23:14,860 --> 03:23:16,720

We've been talking for a long time.

6058
03:23:22,480 --> 03:23:22,520
We've been talking for a long time.

6059
03:23:22,520 --> 03:23:23,940
Does that make sense?

6060
03:23:25,080 --> 03:23:25,680

Chinese.

6065
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:35,520
I'm broken.

I also say broken.

6067
03:23:39,200 --> 03:23:39,940

It basically means it's like broken.

6087
03:24:23,580 --> 03:24:24,820
But it's not really.

6088
03:24:24,940 --> 03:24:25,780
It doesn't mean broken.

6089
03:24:26,020 --> 03:24:27,220

A little bit.

6108
03:25:14,180 --> 03:25:18,080
Can we have a conversation where you speak Chinese and I speak Cantonese?

Sorry, my brain is like trying to fucking remember.

6143
03:26:28,320 --> 03:26:34,240
I'm trying to listen to your Cantonese.

6144
03:26:34,240 --> 03:26:35,000
You're listening to me.

6145
03:26:35,240 --> 03:26:36,620
I really don't know.

6146
03:26:37,020 --> 03:26:38,000
I can't hear you.

6147
03:26:38,380 --> 03:26:40,040
You can hear me.

6148
03:26:40,040 --> 03:26:40,880
I can hear you.

6149
03:26:42,300 --> 03:26:45,100
I'm thinking how to say it.

6150
03:26:49,540 --> 03:26:50,540
It's hard.

6151
03:26:50,920 --> 03:26:51,780
It's really hard.

6152
03:26:52,240 --> 03:26:53,880
It's really hard.

6153
03:26:55,820 --> 03:26:59,340
Are you saying what I'm saying?

6154
03:27:00,020 --> 03:27:03,180
I can hear what you're saying.

6155
03:27:03,460 --> 03:27:05,060
But I'm thinking.

6156
03:27:05,400 --> 03:27:07,920
I'm thinking about what you're saying.

6157
03:27:08,240 --> 03:27:09,920
I'm thinking about what you're saying.

6158
03:27:10,040 --> 03:27:11,260
I'm thinking about what you're saying.

6159
03:27:11,500 --> 03:27:13,160
My brain is...

6160
03:27:14,260 --> 03:27:16,620
I'm thinking about what you're saying.

6161
03:27:16,820 --> 03:27:17,680
And then...

6162
03:27:17,680 --> 03:27:18,820
We're thinking about English.

6163
03:27:19,240 --> 03:27:20,120
We're thinking about English.

6164
03:27:20,600 --> 03:27:21,840
We're thinking about English.

6165
03:27:22,680 --> 03:27:24,620
We're thinking about so many things together.

6166
03:27:26,040 --> 03:27:27,020
Oh my god.

6167
03:27:27,060 --> 03:27:27,940
I didn't hear you.

6168
03:27:28,020 --> 03:27:28,420
What?

6169
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:31,520
Okay.

6170
03:27:31,760 --> 03:27:32,240
I'm...

6171
03:27:33,120 --> 03:27:34,160
I'm saying...

6172
03:27:34,160 --> 03:27:36,280
I'm saying...

6173
03:27:36,280 --> 03:27:37,300
I'm listening to you.

6174
03:27:38,100 --> 03:27:39,020
I'm listening to myself.

6175
03:27:39,480 --> 03:27:40,540
I'm thinking about how to say it.

6176
03:27:40,700 --> 03:27:43,080
I'm thinking about English.

6177
03:27:43,760 --> 03:27:44,880
I'm thinking about...

6178
03:27:44,880 --> 03:27:46,300
Does he know what I'm saying?

6179
03:27:46,440 --> 03:27:47,440
Because I'm speaking really fast.

6180
03:27:48,040 --> 03:27:48,780
I'm thinking...

6181
03:27:48,780 --> 03:27:49,860
I think he doesn't know what I'm saying.

6182
03:27:50,740 --> 03:27:52,780
He's pretending to know what I'm saying.

6183
03:27:52,900 --> 03:27:53,480
I know.

6184
03:27:53,880 --> 03:27:55,480
He doesn't know what I'm saying.

6185
03:27:57,640 --> 03:27:58,520
I understand.

6186
03:28:02,500 --> 03:28:04,240
You said it.

6187
03:28:04,960 --> 03:28:06,460
We're saying the same thing.

6188
03:28:06,640 --> 03:28:07,180
It's the same.

6189
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:09,360
You're saying it really fast.

6190
03:28:09,600 --> 03:28:11,180
And then I'm saying something.

6191
03:28:11,400 --> 03:28:11,720
Yes, yes.

6192
03:28:12,180 --> 03:28:12,700
I understand.

6193
03:28:13,060 --> 03:28:14,420
Do you know what I'm saying?

6194
03:28:16,900 --> 03:28:17,420
What?

6195
03:28:19,180 --> 03:28:20,240
One more time.

6196
03:28:20,520 --> 03:28:21,400
One more time.

6197
03:28:21,620 --> 03:28:22,900
What did I just say?

6198
03:28:26,040 --> 03:28:27,200
I don't know.

6199
03:28:27,340 --> 03:28:28,660
I'm asking you what you're saying.

6200
03:28:29,180 --> 03:28:30,200
I'm saying...

6201
03:28:30,200 --> 03:28:31,280
Do you know what I'm saying?

6202
03:28:32,520 --> 03:28:33,440
I don't know.

6203
03:28:35,580 --> 03:28:37,220
Do you know what I'm saying?

6204
03:28:40,600 --> 03:28:43,370
I don't know how to say it.

6205
03:28:43,610 --> 03:28:44,730
I don't know how to say it in Cantonese.

6206
03:28:44,830 --> 03:28:46,610
I don't know how to say it in Cantonese.

6207
03:28:46,690 --> 03:28:47,210
I can't say anything.

6208
03:28:48,620 --> 03:28:49,550
Not a little bit.

6209
03:28:50,070 --> 03:28:52,890
I'm not that good at speaking.

6210
03:28:53,050 --> 03:28:54,910
I'm not that good at speaking.

6211
03:28:54,910 --> 03:28:56,730
I'm not that good at speaking.

6212
03:28:56,730 --> 03:28:59,090
Oh my God.

6213
03:29:00,930 --> 03:29:02,210
Help me.

6214
03:29:02,470 --> 03:29:02,930
Help me.

6215
03:29:04,860 --> 03:29:05,790
You know what I'm saying?

6216
03:29:06,950 --> 03:29:07,250
Like...

6217
03:29:08,170 --> 03:29:09,690
It means help me.

6218
03:29:10,330 --> 03:29:12,330
Yeah, help me is like save me.

6219
03:29:12,410 --> 03:29:15,050
But I always say help me.

6220
03:29:15,370 --> 03:29:16,130
Help me.

6221
03:29:16,530 --> 03:29:17,390
Save me.

6222
03:29:17,970 --> 03:29:19,010
Help me.

6223
03:29:19,690 --> 03:29:25,030
Is it hard?

6224
03:29:26,630 --> 03:29:28,070
We've said a lot.

6225
03:29:28,490 --> 03:29:30,290
I think we've said the most.

6226
03:29:30,970 --> 03:29:32,010
We've said the most.

6227
03:29:32,230 --> 03:29:32,350
That's right.

6228
03:29:34,950 --> 03:29:36,690
You want to praise me?

6229
03:29:36,930 --> 03:29:38,290
I really can't.

6230
03:29:39,330 --> 03:29:40,090
I really can't.

6231
03:29:40,110 --> 03:29:41,910
I can't hear you at all.

6232
03:29:41,930 --> 03:29:44,150
I can hear you a little bit.

6233
03:29:44,970 --> 03:29:47,750
I think I can hear you more than you can hear me.

6234
03:29:50,830 --> 03:29:51,310
I think I can hear you a little bit.

6235
03:29:51,310 --> 03:29:54,170
do you want to say a little bit of Chinese today?

6236
03:29:55,510 --> 03:29:57,050
I've said a lot.

6237
03:29:59,210 --> 03:30:00,170
I've said a lot.

6238
03:30:00,170 --> 03:30:01,090
I've said a lot.

6239
03:30:01,090 --> 03:30:03,330
I don't understand what you are saying.

6240
03:30:04,110 --> 03:30:07,070
I said it's funny.

6241
03:30:11,530 --> 03:30:13,870
Then what did you learn?

6242
03:30:14,290 --> 03:30:15,230
Tell me.

6243
03:30:15,430 --> 03:30:16,610
What did you learn today?

6244
03:30:16,930 --> 03:30:18,090
I learned...

6245
03:30:18,090 --> 03:30:19,590
I learned...

6246
03:30:20,450 --> 03:30:22,430
I learned...

6247
03:30:22,430 --> 03:30:28,610
A-S...

6248
03:30:29,250 --> 03:30:32,190
A-W-S-L I'm dead.

6249
03:30:32,570 --> 03:30:33,570
You still remember.

6250
03:30:34,050 --> 03:30:34,530
See?

6251
03:30:34,830 --> 03:30:34,830
See?

6252
03:30:34,930 --> 03:30:35,150
See?

6253
03:30:35,210 --> 03:30:36,090
Look, look, look.

6254
03:30:36,330 --> 03:30:36,790
I can do it.

6255
03:30:37,850 --> 03:30:40,930
A-A...A-W-S-L I'm dead.

6256
03:30:44,330 --> 03:30:45,530
Look, look, look.

6257
03:30:45,670 --> 03:30:46,150
I can do it.

6258
03:30:46,230 --> 03:30:46,770
I can say it.

6259
03:30:46,970 --> 03:30:47,550
I know.

6260
03:30:47,830 --> 03:30:48,050
I know.

6261
03:30:48,170 --> 03:30:49,010
You lost that one.

6262
03:30:49,190 --> 03:30:50,790
I can...I know.

6263
03:30:51,770 --> 03:30:52,250
Fencing.

6264
03:30:54,110 --> 03:30:54,590
You?

6265
03:30:56,990 --> 03:30:57,470
Yes.

6266
03:30:58,610 --> 03:30:59,330
No problem.

6267
03:30:59,630 --> 03:31:00,370
No problem.

6268
03:31:00,590 --> 03:31:00,730
No problem.

6269
03:31:00,870 --> 03:31:03,410
What is fencing?

6270
03:31:03,770 --> 03:31:05,890
What is fencing?

6271
03:31:05,890 --> 03:31:07,870
I don't remember.

6272
03:31:08,550 --> 03:31:09,570
I don't remember.

6273
03:31:09,870 --> 03:31:10,630
I asked this.

6274
03:31:10,770 --> 03:31:11,450
I asked the Discord.

6275
03:31:12,370 --> 03:31:13,150
Oh, wait.

6276
03:31:13,310 --> 03:31:13,790
Is it...

6277
03:31:14,610 --> 03:31:15,450
You don't remember.

6278
03:31:15,810 --> 03:31:16,210
I know.

6279
03:31:16,430 --> 03:31:16,570
I know.

6280
03:31:16,850 --> 03:31:17,210
Chicken...

6281
03:31:17,210 --> 03:31:17,970
Chicken...

6282
03:31:18,610 --> 03:31:19,010
Chicken...

6283
03:31:19,610 --> 03:31:19,930
You...

6284
03:31:20,970 --> 03:31:21,610
Chicken...

6285
03:31:21,610 --> 03:31:22,230
You...

6286
03:31:23,870 --> 03:31:24,310
You...

6287
03:31:24,750 --> 03:31:25,010
You...

6288
03:31:26,250 --> 03:31:27,130
You.

6289
03:31:27,130 --> 03:31:29,570
It's fencing with you.

6290
03:31:29,990 --> 03:31:30,870
Dstein...

6291
03:31:30,870 --> 03:31:38,030
But everyone thinks you are good at fencing.

6292
03:31:38,030 --> 03:31:38,130
We have a shadow dirt table where my colleague is helping her and learning how to play surgically.

6293
03:31:38,130 --> 03:31:39,790
Can this...

6294
03:31:39,790 --> 03:31:41,770
really not work?

6295
03:31:42,030 --> 03:31:42,950
This can't work.

6296
03:31:42,950 --> 03:31:43,610
Can't use...

6297
03:31:43,610 --> 03:31:44,130
Why not?

6298
03:31:44,130 --> 03:31:45,410
Why can't I use it?

6299
03:31:45,670 --> 03:31:47,510
This is 1v1 me.

6300
03:31:48,370 --> 03:31:49,330
1v1 you.

6301
03:31:50,610 --> 03:31:51,590
D-Zhan.

6302
03:31:52,330 --> 03:31:52,930
Eh?

6303
03:31:53,210 --> 03:31:54,290
What is 1v1?

6304
03:31:55,290 --> 03:31:56,310
She said...

6305
03:31:56,310 --> 03:31:59,950
D-E-D-A-E-D-A D-E-D-A-E?

6306
03:32:00,370 --> 03:32:01,110
D-E-D-A-E?

6307
03:32:03,890 --> 03:32:13,010
D-E-D-A-E-D-A-E D-E-D-A-E-D-A-E-D-A D-E-D-A-E-D-A-E-D-A I make my own tongue twister.

6308
03:32:15,710 --> 03:32:19,570
D-E-D-A-E-D-A-E-D-A D-E-D-A-E-D-A-E-D-A But you don't know...

6309
03:32:20,130 --> 03:32:20,870
Japanese, right?

6310
03:32:22,030 --> 03:32:22,710
What?

6311
03:32:23,410 --> 03:32:25,410
You don't know Japanese, right?

6312
03:32:26,110 --> 03:32:26,790
What?

6313
03:32:27,270 --> 03:32:27,950
Japanese.

6314
03:32:28,490 --> 03:32:34,770
You don't know Japanese, don't you?

6315
03:32:36,950 --> 03:32:37,630
No...

6316
03:32:37,630 --> 03:32:38,090
Wait, no!

6317
03:32:38,730 --> 03:32:39,410
Murasaki.

6318
03:32:40,090 --> 03:32:40,770
Armor.

6319
03:32:42,190 --> 03:32:42,870
Idiot.

6320
03:32:44,130 --> 03:32:44,510
Murasaki.

6321
03:32:44,570 --> 03:32:47,890
I understand.

6322
03:32:53,810 --> 03:32:54,510
I understand.

6323
03:32:54,510 --> 03:32:55,210
I did it!

6324
03:32:57,230 --> 03:32:58,630
Murasaki armor.

6325
03:32:58,950 --> 03:32:59,650
Yeah!

6326
03:33:00,450 --> 03:33:01,830
That's all I need.

6327
03:33:02,190 --> 03:33:02,830
That's all I need.

6328
03:33:03,430 --> 03:33:04,550
I know the...

6329
03:33:04,550 --> 03:33:06,810
What's about the important information?

6330
03:33:08,050 --> 03:33:09,670
Do you want to know what like...

6331
03:33:09,670 --> 03:33:11,690
He's one in Chinese.

6332
03:33:11,910 --> 03:33:12,570
Oh, wait, wait.

6333
03:33:12,570 --> 03:33:13,770
What is it?

6334
03:33:14,130 --> 03:33:14,950
Like, one dead.

6335
03:33:15,190 --> 03:33:15,950
One dead.

6336
03:33:16,250 --> 03:33:17,930
One dead.

6337
03:33:18,410 --> 03:33:19,550
Yeah, he's one.

6338
03:33:20,630 --> 03:33:22,850
It's not really that dead, but like...

6339
03:33:22,850 --> 03:33:24,010
It's basically that dead.

6340
03:33:24,190 --> 03:33:26,930
I see, I see.

6341
03:33:27,750 --> 03:33:28,990
Oh my god, see guys?

6342
03:33:29,570 --> 03:33:31,050
Don't trust that, by the way.

6343
03:33:31,070 --> 03:33:32,610
If you ever hear that, it's never...

6344
03:33:32,610 --> 03:33:35,090
The same in English too.

6345
03:33:35,410 --> 03:33:37,990
There was somebody's name that was like...

6346
03:33:37,990 --> 03:33:39,530
He's one and it's...

6347
03:33:39,530 --> 03:33:41,250
Okay, I'll type it out.

6348
03:33:41,250 --> 03:33:42,270
It's actually so funny.

6349
03:33:42,410 --> 03:33:43,390
I saw someone's name.

6350
03:33:44,570 --> 03:33:46,890
It's like he's one and then...

6351
03:33:46,890 --> 03:33:48,890
Quote, I mean...

6352
03:33:48,890 --> 03:33:50,190
I hit him once.

6353
03:33:54,360 --> 03:33:55,680
And it's like...

6354
03:33:55,680 --> 03:33:56,740
It's like my favorite.

6355
03:33:57,980 --> 03:33:59,980
It's one of my favorite names.

6356
03:34:00,980 --> 03:34:02,540
Yeah, it's actually...

6357
03:34:02,540 --> 03:34:04,280
Actually it's the same in Chinese too.

6358
03:34:04,320 --> 03:34:05,020
It's like...

6359
03:34:05,020 --> 03:34:07,960
It's not that he's one in Chinese.

6360
03:34:07,980 --> 03:34:09,340
It's my own meaning.

6361
03:34:09,340 --> 03:34:10,100
Yeah, yeah.

6362
03:34:10,220 --> 03:34:12,660
It's not that he's one in Chinese.

6363
03:34:12,900 --> 03:34:13,400
I hit him once.

6364
03:34:15,720 --> 03:34:17,540
I remember like...

6365
03:34:17,540 --> 03:34:18,260
I said that once.

6366
03:34:18,340 --> 03:34:18,900
I was like...

6367
03:34:18,900 --> 03:34:20,040
Or it's like...

6368
03:34:22,320 --> 03:34:24,320
I'm the one that's like...

6369
03:34:24,320 --> 03:34:26,560
I'm the one that's like...

6370
03:34:26,560 --> 03:34:27,120
I'm the one that's like almost dead.

6371
03:34:27,400 --> 03:34:28,640
Oh my god, I remember like...

6372
03:34:28,640 --> 03:34:29,880
I said this once.

6373
03:34:30,080 --> 03:34:31,840
I was like, he's one!

6374
03:34:32,200 --> 03:34:33,280
And then like...

6375
03:34:33,280 --> 03:34:36,260
I think it was on stream before a long time.

6376
03:34:36,400 --> 03:34:38,760
My friend was like, what do you mean he's one?

6377
03:34:39,340 --> 03:34:40,680
And I was like, he was like...

6378
03:34:40,680 --> 03:34:41,560
40 HP.

6379
03:34:41,940 --> 03:34:44,100
And I was like, he's one bullet.

6380
03:34:45,120 --> 03:34:46,820
He's one headshot.

6381
03:34:49,900 --> 03:34:51,980
He was one!

6382
03:34:52,060 --> 03:34:53,300
It's one headshot!

6383
03:34:54,540 --> 03:34:55,960
It's so funny.

6384
03:34:59,200 --> 03:35:00,240
Very like...

6385
03:35:00,240 --> 03:35:01,640
Like the...

6386
03:35:01,640 --> 03:35:03,840
He's one in all languages.

6387
03:35:04,040 --> 03:35:06,580
Honestly the same, I think.

6388
03:35:07,300 --> 03:35:08,420
So it's like...

6389
03:35:09,340 --> 03:35:10,020
One creeper headshot.

6390
03:35:13,660 --> 03:35:14,840
One creeper headshot.

6391
03:35:14,840 --> 03:35:15,860
He's one!

6392
03:35:16,040 --> 03:35:16,540
He's one!

6393
03:35:16,580 --> 03:35:17,760
One creeper headshot!

6394
03:35:21,080 --> 03:35:22,180
Oh my god.

6395
03:35:22,260 --> 03:35:23,540
I had a great... I had fun...

6396
03:35:23,540 --> 03:35:26,000
Oh my god, we fucking talked for so long.

6397
03:35:26,240 --> 03:35:27,180
It's going to...

6398
03:35:27,180 --> 03:35:29,780
I do have another collab.

6399
03:35:30,000 --> 03:35:30,360
Yes!

6400
03:35:31,600 --> 03:35:33,320
You know that game?

6401
03:35:33,540 --> 03:35:34,600
I don't know if you know.

6402
03:35:34,600 --> 03:35:35,060
It's like...

6403
03:35:35,060 --> 03:35:37,240
On Steam now, I think...

6404
03:35:37,900 --> 03:35:38,760
Abiotic Factor.

6405
03:35:39,740 --> 03:35:40,660
Abiotic Factor?

6406
03:35:40,740 --> 03:35:41,860
Is it the one that's like...

6407
03:35:41,860 --> 03:35:43,300
Content creation but...

6408
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:46,220
It's like...

6409
03:35:48,140 --> 03:35:49,680
Half-life a little bit.

6410
03:35:49,880 --> 03:35:50,520
Wait, oh wait.

6411
03:35:50,520 --> 03:35:52,420
Maybe I'm not talking about the same game.

6412
03:35:53,560 --> 03:35:55,500
It was another game that came out.

6413
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:55,640
It was another game that came out.

6414
03:35:55,640 --> 03:35:58,600
That was like the content...

6415
03:35:58,600 --> 03:35:59,800
Oh my gosh.

6416
03:35:59,800 --> 03:36:01,260
What was that content game we played?

6417
03:36:01,560 --> 03:36:02,420
Oh my gosh.

6418
03:36:03,180 --> 03:36:03,480
What was that content game we played?

6419
03:36:04,680 --> 03:36:05,980
Content warning you mean?

6420
03:36:06,040 --> 03:36:06,400
Yeah, yeah.

6421
03:36:06,400 --> 03:36:07,720
There was a game that was like...

6422
03:36:07,720 --> 03:36:07,880
You forgot?

6423
03:36:08,160 --> 03:36:11,400
My brain is not doing so well right now.

6424
03:36:14,760 --> 03:36:15,640
Abiotic Factor.

6425
03:36:15,740 --> 03:36:16,880
I never heard about that game.

6426
03:36:17,020 --> 03:36:17,620
What is that game?

6427
03:36:17,860 --> 03:36:20,800
Yeah, I'm about to play it tonight.

6428
03:36:20,920 --> 03:36:22,720
I had no idea as well.

6429
03:36:23,020 --> 03:36:25,520
Oh, it's a survival crafter.

6430
03:36:26,140 --> 03:36:27,700
Oh, it's a survival game.

6431
03:36:28,740 --> 03:36:29,180
Yeah.

6432
03:36:29,240 --> 03:36:29,860
I don't know.

6433
03:36:30,060 --> 03:36:31,620
I don't know what it's about.

6434
03:36:31,800 --> 03:36:33,320
But apparently it's...

6435
03:36:33,480 --> 03:36:35,180
a little bit like lethal company.

6436
03:36:35,360 --> 03:36:35,760
Oh.

6437
03:36:36,620 --> 03:36:37,960
It's not really like content warning.

6438
03:36:38,160 --> 03:36:40,580
It's like a little bit lethal company but like...

6439
03:36:40,580 --> 03:36:42,960
half-life inspired or something like that.

6440
03:36:43,240 --> 03:36:43,720
Oh, wait.

6441
03:36:43,760 --> 03:36:44,360
That's so cool.

6442
03:36:44,580 --> 03:36:45,580
If it's half-life inspired.

6443
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:47,340
I don't know.

6444
03:36:47,380 --> 03:36:49,080
I'm reading it's like a survival crafter.

6445
03:36:49,300 --> 03:36:52,420
So I feel like it's like a game that you're supposed to play longer than one time.

6446
03:36:52,640 --> 03:36:53,760
It's survival half-life.

6447
03:36:53,800 --> 03:36:54,320
Yeah, yeah.

6448
03:36:54,740 --> 03:36:55,440
Survival half-life.

6449
03:36:55,440 --> 03:36:56,440
It's interesting though.

6450
03:36:56,620 --> 03:36:57,520
Yeah, it sounds interesting.

6451
03:36:58,280 --> 03:37:02,260
Yeah, I'm gonna be collabing that later with Nachan too.

6452
03:37:02,660 --> 03:37:03,100
Nachan.

6453
03:37:03,480 --> 03:37:05,420
How many hours will you guys be playing in?

6454
03:37:06,260 --> 03:37:07,020
Not sure.

6455
03:37:07,360 --> 03:37:08,180
We'll be big again.

6456
03:37:08,240 --> 03:37:10,860
Usually for us, we're like...

6457
03:37:10,860 --> 03:37:13,100
You know, for me at least.

6458
03:37:13,200 --> 03:37:16,060
Me and my closer friends on Vimeo.

6459
03:37:16,680 --> 03:37:19,460
We're just like, okay we'll play it and we'll see what time we end.

6460
03:37:19,660 --> 03:37:20,160
Kind of thing.

6461
03:37:20,580 --> 03:37:22,420
But like when's your collab?

6462
03:37:23,920 --> 03:37:25,400
Oh, it's like...

6463
03:37:25,400 --> 03:37:27,860
It's like at 8 but I'm gonna go eat something.

6464
03:37:27,980 --> 03:37:29,260
Oh, you should go eat.

6465
03:37:29,600 --> 03:37:30,060
Yeah.

6466
03:37:30,060 --> 03:37:30,900
Yeah.

6467
03:37:31,180 --> 03:37:33,100
I had a great time...

6468
03:37:34,260 --> 03:37:35,760
Yapping with you, Hiro.

6469
03:37:36,140 --> 03:37:37,380
Yeah, we were so...

6470
03:37:37,380 --> 03:37:38,140
Yeah, we talked...

6471
03:37:38,140 --> 03:37:41,800
It did not feel like almost 4 hours to be fair.

6472
03:37:41,900 --> 03:37:43,880
I did not feel like I was talking for 4 hours.

6473
03:37:43,920 --> 03:37:44,360
Yeah.

6474
03:37:46,160 --> 03:37:46,680
Chatting.

6475
03:37:46,680 --> 03:37:47,360
Just chatting.

6476
03:37:47,820 --> 03:37:49,300
Yeah, just chatting.

6477
03:37:50,520 --> 03:37:52,200
It's nice to just chat though.

6478
03:37:52,200 --> 03:37:54,040
We didn't clickbait.

6479
03:37:54,120 --> 03:37:57,220
We had a very long conversation like 10 minutes ago.

6480
03:37:57,360 --> 03:37:59,380
We had a very long conversation like 10 minutes ago.

6481
03:37:59,380 --> 03:38:01,260
Guys, there was no clickbait here.

6482
03:38:01,460 --> 03:38:02,220
It's true.

6483
03:38:02,220 --> 03:38:02,780
We did.

6484
03:38:02,860 --> 03:38:04,340
We did talk.

6485
03:38:04,500 --> 03:38:06,200
We tried so hard.

6486
03:38:08,540 --> 03:38:10,520
Our brain is like...

6487
03:38:10,520 --> 03:38:13,160
Our brain right now is overheating.

6488
03:38:13,520 --> 03:38:13,900
Our brain is like...

6489
03:38:15,220 --> 03:38:16,060
Wait, what?

6490
03:38:16,340 --> 03:38:20,340
What does it mean?

6491
03:38:21,180 --> 03:38:22,780
Please praise me.

6492
03:38:23,340 --> 03:38:23,580
Please praise me.

6493
03:38:23,580 --> 03:38:24,260
Please praise me.

6494
03:38:25,380 --> 03:38:26,020
Yeah.

6495
03:38:29,380 --> 03:38:29,940
You can try it cute.

6496
03:38:30,080 --> 03:38:31,040
Say it cutely.

6497
03:38:31,180 --> 03:38:32,600
You go first.

6498
03:38:35,590 --> 03:38:37,170
Please praise me.

6499
03:38:37,290 --> 03:38:39,790
I can do that too.

6500
03:38:40,290 --> 03:38:42,070
Please praise me.

6501
03:38:44,550 --> 03:38:46,230
Please praise me.

6502
03:38:46,250 --> 03:38:46,570
Please praise me.

6503
03:38:46,570 --> 03:38:48,290
Please praise me.

6504
03:38:53,090 --> 03:38:54,070
That's cute.

6505
03:38:55,250 --> 03:39:05,530
Yes, let's all say thank you to Hiro for being a great teacher and like bringing me up to date because I'm not old.

6506
03:39:05,690 --> 03:39:06,530
I'm not auntie.

6507
03:39:06,570 --> 03:39:07,370
I'm not an auntie.

6508
03:39:07,390 --> 03:39:08,130
I'm young.

6509
03:39:08,350 --> 03:39:08,790
I'm young.

6510
03:39:09,850 --> 03:39:12,450
No, thank you for chatting with me.

6511
03:39:13,090 --> 03:39:14,310
We should play something.

6512
03:39:14,550 --> 03:39:15,230
You know, I'm...

6513
03:39:15,890 --> 03:39:18,010
Wait, did you know?

6514
03:39:18,310 --> 03:39:21,850
Dito, Nacha and I were watching the ALGS together.

6515
03:39:21,850 --> 03:39:24,030
Oh yes, I saw you guys were watching.

6516
03:39:25,130 --> 03:39:26,630
We're gonna play Apex tomorrow.

6517
03:39:27,990 --> 03:39:29,310
Oh yeah, the new season.

6518
03:39:29,390 --> 03:39:29,790
The new season.

6519
03:39:29,810 --> 03:39:30,710
We should play sometime.

6520
03:39:30,950 --> 03:39:31,950
Yeah, we should.

6521
03:39:32,010 --> 03:39:34,510
We should play something again soon.

6522
03:39:34,970 --> 03:39:37,130
It was great talking to you.

6523
03:39:37,470 --> 03:39:38,850
Thank you so much.

6524
03:39:39,290 --> 03:39:40,690
Thank you for joining.

6525
03:39:40,850 --> 03:39:43,710
For accepting the invite to just talk.

6526
03:39:43,850 --> 03:39:44,050
Of course.

6527
03:39:44,590 --> 03:39:49,490
Every time it's like having a conversation about like random things.

6528
03:39:49,870 --> 03:39:52,530
And like I hope you learned a lot about animals.

6529
03:39:53,030 --> 03:39:54,930
I learned Cantonese actually.

6530
03:39:55,770 --> 03:39:56,650
Cantonese too.

6531
03:39:56,650 --> 03:39:58,610
I hope you learned a lot about Cantonese language.

6532
03:39:58,830 --> 03:40:00,930
And also a lot about pandas.

6533
03:40:01,530 --> 03:40:02,870
I love pandas.

6534
03:40:03,250 --> 03:40:04,890
I learned about rats too.

6535
03:40:05,030 --> 03:40:05,950
Yeah, and rats too.

6536
03:40:10,350 --> 03:40:12,150
Thank you for your rats fact.

6537
03:40:12,230 --> 03:40:13,390
We should like...

6538
03:40:13,390 --> 03:40:17,210
We should visit a zoo one day just to look at pandas together.

6539
03:40:17,550 --> 03:40:19,390
Just look at them.

6540
03:40:19,550 --> 03:40:22,630
Just be like, we learned so much about you guys.

6541
03:40:23,450 --> 03:40:24,010
Sure.

6542
03:40:25,170 --> 03:40:25,930
I'm down.

6543
03:40:26,110 --> 03:40:26,490
You know?

6544
03:40:27,030 --> 03:40:33,630
Just go to visit a zoo somewhere just to see the pandas and be like, this is how we bonded.

6545
03:40:35,250 --> 03:40:35,790
God.

6546
03:40:36,230 --> 03:40:37,370
God, they're stupid.

6547
03:40:37,770 --> 03:40:38,810
And sun bears.

6548
03:40:38,950 --> 03:40:41,490
We should see a sun bear together.

6549
03:40:46,850 --> 03:40:51,550
Grab like a giant cutout of us and just put them next to the...

6550
03:40:51,550 --> 03:40:52,010
Sun bear.

6551
03:40:54,010 --> 03:40:56,310
You think the zoos will let us bring a cutout of us?

6552
03:40:56,570 --> 03:40:59,450
Like a life-size cutout and we just put it...

6553
03:40:59,450 --> 03:41:00,650
Like our 2D...

6554
03:41:00,650 --> 03:41:01,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6555
03:41:02,650 --> 03:41:11,450
Just put it there with the sun bear and the panda and I'll be like, oh my god pandas, you're so fucking stupid but you're so cute.

6556
03:41:14,570 --> 03:41:15,530
God, I wish.

6557
03:41:16,630 --> 03:41:18,270
It's a scared animal.

6558
03:41:24,010 --> 03:41:28,210
But yes, let's all say goodbye to Hiro and thank you for teaching.

6559
03:41:28,530 --> 03:41:29,290
Thank you.

6560
03:41:29,290 --> 03:41:30,270
No, thank you.

6561
03:41:31,550 --> 03:41:32,330
Bye bye.

6562
03:41:32,410 --> 03:41:33,490
Yeah, let's chat again sometime.

6563
03:41:33,750 --> 03:41:36,350
My brain is like mush right now.

6564
03:41:36,370 --> 03:41:38,230
I don't even know how to do an outro.

6565
03:41:40,430 --> 03:41:42,130
Hiro, do my outro for me.

6566
03:41:42,970 --> 03:41:44,550
Do your outro for you?

6567
03:41:44,590 --> 03:41:44,830
Yeah.

6568
03:41:44,830 --> 03:41:45,910
What do you want me to do?

6569
03:41:46,030 --> 03:41:46,470
