There's 48 in total.

38
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,240
Yeah.

39
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:56,060
I like I played since the beginning, but I also took a break
for like six months and I came back two months ago, I think.

40
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,480
Oh, okay.

41
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:06,600
So like so then you have to catch up after taking a break
and then you got so the only characters you're missing are

42
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,620
the ones that you didn't get when you were at break, right?

43
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,440
Yeah!

44
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:12,960
Yeah!

45
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,660
Because I was collecting all of them and then after that I
was like, oh crap.

46
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,520
I have like so much, like so many other games to play.

47
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,100
So I was like, okay, I gotta take a break from that.

48
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,980
And like six months later I came back.

49
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,120
I'm like, oh, I really want to play it.

50
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,340
I really want to play it.

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,220
Oh my gosh.

52
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,580
Wait, what other gotcha games do you play other than Han
Kai?

53
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,280
Now?

54
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:34,940
Yeah.

55
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,620
Well, actually none other.

56
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,700
Because it's expensive, okay?

57
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,460
Like, gotcha games are expensive.

58
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,880
Yeah, you only...

59
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,520
Like, if you play more than, like...

60
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,520
I think 2 is, like, the maximum anybody should have.

61
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,740
Because, like, 1 is, like, crazy.

62
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,640
If you spend, like, a little bit on it, like, it's...

63
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,020
Now for, like, a month or two months, you know what I mean?

64
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:57,880
Yeah!

65
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,500
It's crazy.

66
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,600
So, I only play Hongkai now.

67
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,120
But I played Genshin 2 before.

68
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,440
Yeah!

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,180
Wait, wait, wait.

70
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,740
How many characters do you have in...

71
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,640
Genshin then.

72
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,740
Don't ask.

73
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,760
I had like three accounts, dude.

74
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,380
I had like three accounts.

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,540
So...

76
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,640
They're both like, they're all from like the same company
too, right?

77
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,540
Me, Mihoio?

78
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
Yeah, it's Mihoio.

79
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,940
Oh my gosh, they're... They have like...

81
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,040
They have like the algorithm or like the the structure of
its set.

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,700
I played... I played like Hongkai Impact third of that one.

83
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,080
Yeah, I played that one too, that's why.

84
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,720
Oh, wait.

85
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,620
Are you talking about Honkai Star Rail?

86
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,020
Yeah.

87
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,740
Yeah, the one before that is, like, part of the Honkai
series.

88
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,920
Wait, what's the difference between Honkai Impact and Honkai
Star Rail?

89
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,520
Honkai Impact is waifu-only, basically.

90
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,860
Waifu-only, yeah.

91
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,480
Yeah, it's basically waifu-only.

92
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Okay, oh, so Star Rail has men.

93
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,140
Yeah.

94
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,300
Yeah.

95
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,100
Yeah.

96
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,860
Yeah.

97
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,740
It's part of, like, the same universe.

98
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,080
I see.

99
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,480
I see.

100
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,920
But it's fun.

101
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,760
But I know.

102
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,480
And like, I heard like Star Rail is sort of like similar to
like Genshin, like the open world right?

103
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,100
It's similar but like not similar at the same time.

104
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,020
It's like actually really not similar.

105
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,360
I think Genshin is tired.

106
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,720
Sorry to say it's a little bit tiring because like you have
to do everything manually.

107
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,420
Yeah.

108
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,740
But like in Star Rail you can kind of like leave your home.

109
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:48,860
phone there or leave it going and like you'll be like okay
type yeah yeah relax while looking at it i see you see i i

110
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:58,620
don't know anything about like gotcha games in general uh
because like for me i'm also scared of getting addicted it

111
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:07,400
is it is addictive i try not to play any gotcha game because
like i'm scared of getting addicted and i'm scared when i

112
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:17,800
get addicted that i'm gonna money yeah I think that's the
problem everybody has like damn that that woman is so hot

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:25,460
that god like I must have you know it's like wow yeah
because I already spend money on fortnite skins and like

114
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:36,060

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,300
Really?

119
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,500
Because it's fun.

120
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,580
I only touched Fortnite, like, once ever.

121
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,620
And I was like, whoa.

122
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,200
I don't, I don't, like, buy the skins to play with it.

123
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,280
I buy the skins, like, just because I think it's funny.

124
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,240
Like, I don't even play Fortnite.

125
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,060
Wait, you don't play it?

126
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,580
You don't play if you buy the skins?

127
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,820
I only play it on stream.

128
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,420
I only play it.

129
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:18,200
I really feel like But it's funny It's like how you see like
You see the pretty characters And you're like Oh they're so

130
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:27,880
pretty You know what I can't judge you I see the funny
Fortnite skin I'm like Oh it's so funny Well yeah I get it

131
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:35,460
Well Yeah I get it You know what I can't judge you Because
Financial choices you know Because you don't like gacha

132
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,460
games So you can like Yeah exactly I saved my money Yeah by
not playing gacha games.

133
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,280
And instead, I spend that money I save from gacha games to
buy Fortnite skins.

134
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,700
I don't know which is the lesser evil.

135
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,380
Honestly, it's the game.

136
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,060
Okay.

137
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,080
Yeah.

138
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,380
Okay, yeah, we don't know what's the lesser evil.

139
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,220
But we both spend money irresponsibly.

140
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,440
It's true.

141
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,740
But you know what?

142
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,740
Wifu for lifu, right?

143
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:21,440
I haven't heard that in like years Until the game Until like
in 10 years The game gets shut down For Genshin Impact For

144
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:34,140
the sequel of Genshin Impact No Dude that's so sad
Eventually your waifus Your waifus will disappear You know

145
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:41,620
because the servers Will get shut down That's what happens
to like so many games that's why it's so scary that's why i

146
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:48,840
don't do gacha too because of the server i feel like servers
tend to get shut down due for gacha games eventually and

147
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:57,220
then all those waifus all those digital waifus will be gone
because they're not real but the mihoyo is pretty good at

148
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:05,840
keeping like that's true mihoyo i don't see like an end to
it you know what i mean yeah i feel like mihoyo It's sort of

149
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,220
like, um, it's sort of like Riot where it's like, like
League of Legends will never die.

150
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,680
So I feel like me.

151
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,460
Yeah, League of Legends actually, I never learn how to play
League.

152
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,020
So I was like learning how to play it.

153
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,900
And it's crazy.

154
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,460
It's like too many heroes in it.

155
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,960
And I'm like, dude, what does this guy do?

156
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,040
What are the combos?

157
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm saying there's like a hundred heroes.

158
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,500
Yeah.

159
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,140
It's really difficult actually.

160
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,560
I was like that's why I could never learn league and also
because like it's so fucking toxic too.

161
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,300
So Yeah, yeah, it's really toxic.

162
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
I heard like yeah, yeah, what are you gonna say?

163
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,340
No, you can go ahead.

164
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,140
No, okay.

165
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:00,700
I heard from my friends that the the moderating team for
league is so intense now that you say anything toxic they'll

166
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,140
like ban you instantly.

167
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,880
So people got like super creative on how to be toxic to each
other.

168
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,880
Wait, really?

169
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,240
Yeah, yeah, they'll be like super passive-aggressive.

170
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,000
Like, you did a good job when they clearly didn't do a good
job.

171
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,200
So, just to get away from the...

172
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:27,220
Just to get away from the filters and the bands, they'll
just be like super passive-aggressive.

173
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,500
Oh, yeah, so it's like, good job, smile.

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,760
What were you going to say about League?

219
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,400

Well, League, I actually am going.

223
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,480
I think there's like competitions.

224
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,640
Like, I think there's a big competition.

225
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,980
soon or something.

226
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,660
I'm going to be doing a watchalong for League or something.

227
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,040
Oh, yeah.

228
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,600
Like, is it like an eSport or?

229
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,320
Yeah, it is the eSport tournament.

230
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,900
I'm not sure which one it is because I don't follow League
too much.

231
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,320
Apparently it's like MSI?

232
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,620
I think so.

233
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,580
I'm not sure.

234
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,040
But, like, because of that too, I'm like, oh crap.

235
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,740
I really got to learn, like, you got to know what's going
on.

236
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,080
I don't know what's going on.

237
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,840
It's just really difficult to like, you know, actually
Chinese is like not my mother language as well.

238
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,660
You know, right?

239

Usually, you only speak in English, right?

338
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:04,760
Usually.

339
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,900
Yeah, usually.

340
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,600
Well, like to my parents, I speak in Cantonese.

341
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,520
And like, it's because like...

342
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I want to hear you speak Cantonese.

343
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,080
Wait, do you understand Cantonese?

344
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,340
So, okay.

345
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,480
So I actually did not understand Cantonese for a long time.

346
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,200
Then I learned a little bit from like videos and also being
on Vidi Vidi.

347
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,720
And also I stay...

348
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,300
Do you know where I live right now?

349
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,500
I'm like, okay, so I'm actually, I'm like Japanese, but I
stay in Malaysia.

350
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,200
Oh, wait, that's so interesting.

351
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,520
Wait, do you know Malaysian then?

352
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,560
The local language, yeah, a little bit.

353
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,720
Oh, that's so interesting.

354
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,060
Wait, so you're like super multilingual then.

355
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:58,260
Yeah, yeah, I can kind of speak, like, how do I say, like,
people here mix your, like, languages.

356
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:10,180
really often yeah yeah yeah so it'll mix english with canto
and stuff like that yeah yeah so that's why like i hear like

357
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:16,160
a lot of things every day so i'm like okay i can i can kind
of understand that's similar to me because like i learned

358
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:25,160
cantonese first and then but like uh my extended family
mostly speaks uh like on my on my dad's side mostly speaks

359
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:32,180
like manner in and then like growing up, I stayed with my
grandpa for a bit as well.

360
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,300
My grandpa only speaks like Mandarin, but he could like
understand Cantonese and stuff.

361
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,480
So then he'll like talk to me in Mandarin.

362
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,520
That's how I like learned like Mandarin because like people
just like talk to me in that in Mandarin instead of

363
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,060
Cantonese.

364
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,900
And then your spoken is so good.

365
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,580
And when you try and like read and write, it's like crap.

366
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,740
Oh, yeah, sure.

367
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,020
Like I can't read or write.

368
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:00,180
So before I would like, I remember when I first did like, I
try to speak stream and then people were like typing to me

369
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:06,420
in chinese really you did look i tried to speak yeah yeah i
did like for like a solo and then people were like typing to

370
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:12,940
me in chinese i was like i'm sorry i cannot read this like
you guys have to type to me in english you want to try again

371
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:25,280
well you can read it you can read it for me yeah i can
barely read english let alone like i can barely read english

372
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,640
let alone chinese

373
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:52,920
I can't read after that.

374
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,400
Someone in my chat was like, And then I don't know whatever,
what else?

375
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,840
Yeah, my traditional Chinese is crap.

376
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,520
I know, like, traditional and simplified.

378
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:09,880
Yeah.

379
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,520
I think in Malaysia, they use simplified as well.

380
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,440
So my traditional is really bad.

381
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,160
Like, I'm trying to read it.

382
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,840
I'm like, crap.

383
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,000
Easier to learn traditional.

384
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,960
Well, I mean, traditional is, like, really difficult.

385
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,880
Because, like, that's why it's simplified.

386
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,380
Yeah!

387
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,500
But, like, when you know traditional, you can tell what is
the simplified version because you know you're like wait

388
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:40,840
that sort of looks like the traditional version and um i
learned traditional in canada i learned traditional so like

389
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,120
and then i remember like i remember oh wait no i did like
when i like when i like moved uh overseas i remember like

390
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:56,540
like i had one i think like i had like one lesson in like um
simplified and then I was like what I like I was right like

391
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:03,620
they're like write this sentence so that I wrote it in like
traditional and they're like what is this And I was like I

392
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:13,200
was like yeah, this is me Like like okay, so there is
traditional but the traditional is very it's like much

393
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,140
harder That's why yeah, because there's more strokes in it
You know how I learned like when I went to Biddy Biddy at

394
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:28,000
first I learned using Duolingo as well So I was like I'm
gonna use dual lingo is not like a good like learning like

395
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,520
not like a good like main learning tool type I was like very
confused on where to learn I was like okay you know what I'm

396
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:44,140
gonna open dual lingo I think like Chinese is like one of
the hardest languages to learn because of how many

397
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,400
intonations and like characters there are for like writing
and reading as well

398
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:02,400
i just just is like i don't know like cantonese has like
more intimate like more tones than like uh mandarin i don't

399
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:11,540
remember it was like eight or something like oh yeah there's
like a lot of chinese dialects i think like i i don't know

Making mistakes or something And they forced me to read All
those tongue twisters And like I was going crazy I was I was

Is there any like easy tongue twister?

415
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,300
If it's a tongue twister, it's not meant to be easy.

416
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,080
There's one of a milk as well.

417
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,080
I remember just like some, some.

418
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah.

419
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,640
What's the milk one called?

420
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,120
Like, nai nai, new nai, something like that.

421
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,460
Nai, new nai.

422
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,560
I don't remember.

423
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,080
Like, there's a lot of tongue twisters.

424
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,100
It's too difficult, I think.

425
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,220
Maybe you can try.

426
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:34,900
You know what?

427
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,480
I can't even read.

428
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,520
What do you mean?

429
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,140
I can't even read.

430
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,880
How do I do tongue twisters?

431
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,520
And I can't even read.

432
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,300
It's so difficult, honestly.

433
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,800
Tongue twisters, I think, in any language is difficult.

434
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,020
Some, like, English ones are pretty difficult.

435
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,940
There's some really difficult ones as well.

436
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,840
Well, I think, like, I think the Chinese ones are, like,
more so, like, the whole fact that, like, it sounds the

437
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,160
same.

438
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,460
It all sounds very similar, but it's all different meaning.

439
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:13,220
Yeah, so you, it's, like, basically, like, it's testing
your, your tonation reading type deal.

440
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,160
There's so much.

441
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,080
Stop avoiding the Chinese tongue twister.

442
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,340
Stop avoiding it.

443
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,600
I've gone through, like, torture doing those tongue
twisters.

444
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:36,800
Like, every single time I do a collab with, like, like,
like, like, oh, Hiro, we'll teach you Chinese today.

445
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,700
And then they always give me a tongue twister.

446
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,800
I can't take it.

447
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,500
And I'm like, Hiro teach me Chinese.

448
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,000
And I was like, Hiro, teach me Chinese.

449
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,180
Anyway, do a tongue twister too.

450
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,340
Yeah.

451
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,180
Well.

452
00:30:51,380 --> 00:31:00,440
Okay, so wait, actually teach you something today like
useful things like you want to learn like slang or something

453
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, teach me some some modern slang But you
well, you might know the slang if you talk to your parents.

454
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:18,160
Oh, no, I don't like I don't progress What I don't I don't
progress that is I'm like stuck in this time chamber of The

455
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,180
Chinese I've known I Like, I never learn anything new.

456
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,040
Just asking, do you want to learn curse words or do you know
all the curse words already?

457
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:34,200
I feel like I know a lot of the curse words already because,
like, you know, like when your parents are driving the car

458
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,460
and they start yelling at the drivers in the car.

459
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,000
What?

460
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,460
Wow, what did they yell?

461
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,820
I'm so interested.

462
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,480
My mom watches my street.

463
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,180
Wait, really?

464
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Yeah, but I learned...

465
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,600
Wait, wait.

466
00:31:59,780 --> 00:31:59,920
I...

467
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,900
Oh, okay.

468
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,860
But it's okay, right?

469
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,920
Like, you learn it from your parents.

470
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,700
Yeah, that's true.

471
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,300
No, that's true!

472
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,600
Yeah.

473
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,560
You can tell me one, I'll tell you one.

474
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,500
I...

475
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:30,120
I think the easiest one is like, I think everybody knows is
like the Chao Nima Oh, Chao Nima Yeah, Chao Nima Oh, no!

476
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:30,980
Yeah!

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:43,200
But it's like And then I know, okay, this one I've heard of
that one Yes, I've heard of that one And then Well, the most

478
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:53,440
tame one is The most tame one is Bapol, which is like Bitch,
so Well, yeah, that's pretty tame.

479
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,460
Yeah, it's pretty tame.

480
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,080
There's a lot of things I could say, but Bapol is the tame
one.

481
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,080
They love the curse.

482
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,740
I would say, actually, Chinese, there's a lot of different
ways you can curse somebody.

483
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,480
Oh, yeah.

484
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:19,680
Yeah, like, I know, like, when I was growing up, my mom
would be like, so it's like, having a pork bun is better

485
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,040
than having you.

486
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,340
What?

487
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,000
Wait, really?

488
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,980
Wow!

489
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,020
Oh my god!

490
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,560
It's like, it's like one of the most common.

491
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,680
That's one of the most...

492
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,460
Yes, it's a very common.

493
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,320

675
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,680
It is really good.

676
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,280
I watched that.

677
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,220
I actually like that.

678
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,820
Yeah, and I watched that with my grandpa when I was like
growing up, like on the TV together.

679
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,480
Oh, that's so cute.

680
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,460
Yeah, because they would always have like reruns because
it's so famous.

681
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,120
I did watch it in 1980s, guys.

682
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,620
There were reruns.

683
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:40,420
I would watch, I would watch the reruns with my grandpa.

684
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,320
I was an older one.

685
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,020
I'm not sure.

686
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,880
It was in 1980s, isn't it?

687
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,900
I'm pretty sure, right?

688
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,740
It may be that one.

689
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,100
I remembered it wrong, I think.

690
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,740
But yeah, it's the one.

691
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,380
It's the OG one, I think.

692
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,760
So, yeah.

693
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,480

Yeah, yeah.

695
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,760

It's like a...

697
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:10,180

720
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:22,280
I haven't even seen that I've actually seen that in theaters
I think like when the first week it came out because like

721
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:31,960
also it's because like the actor that played Chikotland He's

00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:43,780
then like my grandma like had a crush on that actor So like

00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:09,020

were ever, like, watching that many movies, actually.

726
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,420
So I never really went to theater, like, to buy seats or
anything.

727
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,380
I've never had that.

728

That's why.

746
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,800
That's so cool.

747
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,200
Yeah.

748
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,920
Like, I went to visit the Biddy Biddy HQ.

749
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,720
Oh, oh my gosh.

750
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,700
What's it like?

751
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,260
It's actually really cool.

752
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,680
It's actually much nicer.

753
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,740
Like, I was kind of scared because, you know, my mother
language is also English.

754
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:18,340
And I was like, okay, my Chinese is like kind of, you know,
I don't know, like, I was like kind of scared going there.

755
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,220
But like, it was actually really nice.

756
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,680
Like, it was really interesting.

757
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,080
Oh, that's really, that's really cool, though.

758
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,160
You had to see their headquarters.

759
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,620
It's pretty English friendly.

760
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,400
So I was like, okay, thank God.

761
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,820
It's like, if I don't understand, I'll speak English.

762
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,900
That's really sweet.

763
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,540
But like, you never been to like a theater in China, right?

764
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,180
Like a movie theater?

765
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,420
No, I've not gone to a theater.

766
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,560
Really nice.

767
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,200
Because like, I think like the seats are...

768
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,500
I think like back then when I went to the movie theater,
like back then in NA, you don't have like seats reservations

769
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,080
in NA.

770
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,260
So it's like in NA when you want to go to a movie theater.

771
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:04,260
I think now people can reserve seats but back then like when
I was like a lot younger it was like a battle royale for

772
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:13,840
like getting good seats yeah yeah it was like you you have
to get there early if you want uh if you want to have like

773
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:20,580
good seats it's like a free-for-all so like people would be
like actually get to the theaters early just to like watch

774
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:26,020
it like if it was like a really good movie and like people
like really want to watch it like if you don't get there

775
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:31,600
early you have sit at the very front or something but i
don't know but i don't know now honestly like i haven't been

776
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,580
with movie theater for a long time anyway i remember when i
like you know when i started to live in asia and like in

777
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:47,280
china too um when i first came in theater you i was like oh
my god you get to reserve seats oh my god you mean i don't

778
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:57,240
have to come to the theater 30 minutes early just to sit in
a good spot like i'm getting convinced you're you're you're

779
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,120
are becoming like, like, like grandma.

780
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:00,900
You know what?

781
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,020
That's true!

782
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,740
On TV, this is great.

783
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:05,600
Yeah.

784
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,020
And then...

785
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,040
What you're saying to me is, I'm like, wait, really?

786
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:11,840
Have you ever heard?

787
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,720
No, it's true!

788
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,220
Look, I came from a place where there was a battle royale
for movies.

789
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,160
There's some smell.

790
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:25,940
And then, but then like, also like, I think, I don't, I
think now they have buttered popcorn, but like, I remember

791
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,120
like, like popcorn.

792
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:35,240

do you always say it's like it's like it's like they went on

794
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:54,900
like a journey it's like so difficult to do anything yeah
even going to the movie theater it's like that's a VR but

It's literally three months ago.

895
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:15,680
I This is from a 1986 movie.

896
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,260

898
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,780

899
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,520
The movie might be old, but the meme is young.

900
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,260
The meme is young.

901
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,360
Maybe the memes are made by all the aunties.

902
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,140
All the grandmas and grandpas.

903
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:41,980

No!

905
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,900
We should take your 1986 movie and put it as a meme.

I don't even know how to say young in Chinese I don't even

years.

I watch the classical stuff.

1023
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,300
Because I'm cultured.

Wait, what kind of shows that your chat recommends you?

1032
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,440
Honestly, they don't recommend me.

1033
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,520
need some but like I don't really look for them for like
recommendations or shows wait you don't because it's more

1034
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:22,480
you don't trust your chat I uh it's because I mostly watch
the ones that they already recommend me and only it's only

1035
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:31,800
the classical ones because they don't really watch TV shows
you know wait what do they watch they only watch people

1036
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:38,400
nowadays they They watch, you know, they watch movies still,
but like most people just look at videos all the time.

1037
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:42,460
Oh, like, oh, because like, oh, so it's just like, like,
it's just like N.A.

1038
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,460
Where, like, people don't watch, like, shows anymore.

1039
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,760
They just watch, like, like, streamers and, like, YouTube
videos.

1040
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:55,460
Do you think VTuber, like, I mean, honestly, like, they
watch more anime, I think.

1041
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:02,280
Well, there's like, there's like, Chinese animation is
really good, good now, too, I heard.

1042
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:09,820
Yeah, okay, there are really good Chinese, like, some really
good Chinese girly animations, but mostly everyone still

1043
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:11,500
watches like Japanese animations.

1044
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:21,180
Like, Bidi Bidi is actually, like, do you know, like Bidi
Bidi was like, uh, uh, vocal like Miku, Miku fans fan, like,

1045
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:25,320
like, like everyone is like, it was called Miku fans or
something.

1046
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:25,940
Oh, Miku.

1047
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:29,380
Oh, I mean, Volko has always been like super crazy popular
worldwide.

1048
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:36,600
No, but it's like, it's like an Otaku, basically, like,
Like, like, yeah, everyone there is like anime fan.

1049
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1050
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,100
Yeah.

1051
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,400
What's...

1052
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:41,660
Yeah.

1053
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:47,520
So, so they mostly watch into anime stuff.

1054
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:52,040
But there are still a lot of people that watch like TVs,
talk shows and all those things.

1055
01:12:52,260 --> 01:13:00,140
It's just that they don't really recommend it to me since
like I don't think I've watched that many as well.

1056
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,780
Oh, so they're just saying you might not like like.

1057
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,540
as much as they do.

1058
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,240
Or it is like the way they're talking.

1059
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,500
And then like speaking wise might be like a bit calm.

1060
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,480
Yeah, it's like it's like really it's because they talk
really fast.

1061
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:14,000
Because they're like it's like fluent.

1062
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,400
So it's like maybe harder to understand type deal.

1063
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,420
That's true.

1064
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:21,680
I did not understand what was going on in that dating show.

1065
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:28,280
But like from what I could like piece out from the words I
do understand.

1066
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,480
It seemed really funny.

1067
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:32,740
Yeah.

1068
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:40,380
yeah talk shows are just too too fast like they talk
extremely fast like back and forth kind of thing it's really

1069
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:50,380
difficult but like i try sometimes yeah yeah that makes
sense yeah do you know like what is like uh basically otaku

1070
01:13:50,380 --> 01:14:03,720
in chinese wait what is otaku in chinese erciyan erciyan
erciyan yeah it's like it's like like how How do I put it?

1071
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:05,500
Like, there is China.

1072
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,680
China is like, China is Chinese.

1073
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,980
But that's mostly like...

1074
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,040
I would say Erchiyen is more accurate.

1075
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,780
What does that mean?

1076
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:16,980
Erchiyen.

1077
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,080
You don't know Japanese.

1078
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,200
Erchiyen is two, right?

1079
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:23,680
Er...

1080
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,700
And what's...

1081
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:26,400
Erchiyen?

1082
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,680
I only know it in Japanese.

1083
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,780
Wait, I'm trying to translate it in English.

And I don't have the time to like, just sit down and watch
anime type deal.

1093
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:04,140
Like, I, if I'm watching a show, I always do something in
the background while I'm watching something so like so i can

1094
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:08,400
like split my attention like i can just like if i i don't

01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,040
Yeah, that one is like...

1144
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,740
I think even now, like, a lot of people still know it.

1145
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:17,460
Exactly!

1146
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,680
It doesn't mean I'm old!

1147
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,860
That's the only part, though.

1148
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,200
That's the only part, though.

1149
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:26,500
Peely-pada, Peely-pada-pada-pada-pada-pada-pada.

1150
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,740

01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,080
Yeah, Su-yinti.

1152
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:40,140
That's what it's called Tsuyinji Because I only knew like
the name I knew the name In in Cantonese But I didn't know

1153
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:46,880
the name I forgot the name in like Like Japanese Um And then
But your Cantonese Then your Cantonese Is really great right

1154
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:54,160
now Like Like it's better than your Chinese Like Um I would
say so Cause like Um Because like I speak Cantonese at home

1155
01:21:54,160 --> 01:22:02,220
I don't speak Mandarin I don't speak like Chinese Mandarin
Um Because like Only my dad Knows how to speak Uh Mandarin

1156
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:11,420
Um um but then like uh he like refused to teach me Mandarin
when I was growing up because he was like you don't need to

1157
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:18,720
know Mandarin you just need to know Cantonese like because
he was like he's like why should we teach her to she's gonna

1158
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:25,200
get confused because he was like she's just gonna get
confused if we teach her more than one so we'll just like so

1159
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:36,300
we'll just speak in Cantonese and so I never I don't I only
only when I uh started getting older and like and when I um

1160
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:43,540
moved overseas that like I started to learn like manner in
because like people around me were speaking manner in I'm

1161
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:55,000
like why didn't you teach me manner in dad I was just like
why everybody's speaking Mandarin, why did you not teach me?

1162
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:04,600
It's like all my extended family on my dad's side speaks
Mandarin and then they'll like tell me stuff and I'll be

1163
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:11,940
like uh uh maybe they did try when you're like really young.

1164
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,020
Oh yeah, and then I couldn't yeah, I couldn't like absorb
it.

1165
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,600
Like we give up.

1166
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:20,970
Like

1167
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:26,530
They're like, oh no, she's too stupid.

1168
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:27,990
We'll just go with one.

1169
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:35,750
But your accent, your accent, like, for, like, like, like,
speaking Mandarin and Cantonese, like, Chinese and Cantonese

1170
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,490
now is, like, pretty good, isn't it?

1171
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:45,830
Like, because I'm, no, I feel like it's, it's worse because,
like, I don't use it as often anymore.

1172
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:51,230
Like, I think you're, you're, you're definitely better
because you speak it more fluently than me.

1173
01:23:54,290 --> 01:24:01,350
like embarrassed sometimes because it's like you know I'm

surrounding you English and Japanese so it's like like when

1189
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,660
If you're...

1190
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:42,400

1192
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,200

1193
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,820

1194
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:46,600

to i want to teach you some really funny like a meme I think

1198
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:32,980

there's like Chinese memes but it's very difficult to

1199
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:40,000
understand like there's like a difference between like I
think English type of memes versus like the China Chinese

1200
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:47,520
type of memes like what like they have they have like
abstract kind of memes like do you know there's like

1201
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,880
something about do you know there's a place in China called
Guangdong yeah yeah i've been there that's where they speak

1202
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:59,780
a lot of kentany yeah yeah and like and like apparently
there's a lot of cockroaches over there or something like

1203
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:07,840
that yeah so i just recently learned this too i was like
wait what there's like a lot of cockroaches there and there

1204
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:14,460
is like a meme where they they say like it's like it's like
because there's so many cockroaches there they like they

1205
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:23,800
have a meme like saying the the guantung kangang it's like
the guantung cockroach is And they have like a picture of

1206
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,820
the cockroach at a window.

1207
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,500
It's like, it's really stupid.

1208
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:28,580
Yeah.

1209
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,140
That's funny.

1210
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,440
Wait, do you have a picture of that?

1211
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,640
Or is it just like a verbal thing?

1212
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,600
I think I do.

1213
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,180
But I need to find it.

1214
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:42,340

It's just a cockroach looking.

1216
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,980
Looking at a window, basically.

1217
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:48,640

so there's a time when I was younger and I stay alone, like

1237
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,440
when I was a little kid already, like I had my own room,
basically.

1238
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,240
My parents would be like staying in another room.

1239
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,340
And it was dark, you know, in the room.

1240
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:38,300
I was trying to turn on the light, basically, but I was kind
of small and short.

1241
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:41,360
So I was like reaching for a really high light switch.

1242
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:47,100
And like, when I turn it on, I felt something like drop on
my arm in the dark.

1243
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,100
And I was like...

1244
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:51,280
And I was like, what the hell is that?

1245
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,020
You know kind of thing?

1246
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:53,820
And I turned on the light.

1247
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,660
I saw like a lizard on my hand.

1248
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,520
And I was like, I freaked out.

1249
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,640
And I screamed.

1250
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,500
And I threw it on my bed.

1251
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:06,660
And then like, and then like I disappeared under my covers
or something.

1252
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,100
And I was like, I stood there.

1253
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:10,440
I was like, oh crap.

1266
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:24,500
sleep in bed for like two weeks oh my god no i've had like
two weeks i've had that moment before where like i think

1267
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:31,640
like it was like i don't know i think i i think it was like
like it's like it was like i've had these moments where like

1268
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:39,940
if i see like a bug at what in one in a room i just never go
back to that room like for like for like one to two weeks i

1269
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:46,980
just never go back to that room like i remember like when i
was younger i think i saw like a spider or something in the

1270
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:52,340
bathroom And then for one to two weeks, I just used my
parents' bathroom.

1271
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,720
Because I was like, I'm not going.

1272
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,460
I was like, what if it comes back?

1273
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:03,440
Like spiders, being a spider, like I've been like, I don't
know why.

1274
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:09,760
But like, okay, so currently, I stream in like a separate
room from my sleeping.

1275
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,100
Like, my bed is in another room, right?

1276
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:15,460
Yeah, I have like 3D camera set up, actually.

1277
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,660
I have like home 3D setup in the other, like, stream.

1278
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:27,900
yeah and like there's a spider in here somewhere actually
and like it only comes out when I play Apex and I have no

1279
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:36,160
idea why yeah yeah it has disturbed me like I think four
times so far when I'm streaming as well only when I'm

1280
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:42,460
streaming by the way and like um like during other times
when I'm streaming other things like it does not even bother

1281
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:49,440
me at all but like when I'm when I'm playing apex i'm like
fighting a team and it it'll suddenly come in front of me

1282
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:57,440
like it'll hang in front of me or it'll drop on my lap and
i'm like oh crap there's a spider and i have to like afk you

1283
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:06,360
know and like sometimes i'm like i'm like dead 30 i'm like
basically a death box oh my god it just like it only comes

1284
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:16,160
yeah i had no idea why the spider just enjoys the gameplay
you say no watch you play It's been, like, bothering me.

1285
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,760
I even have, like, a spray now because it's...

1286
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,220
Wait, is it going crazy?

1287
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:21,340
Yeah!

1288
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:22,580
I don't know.

1289
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:23,820
Maybe it had, like, a wife.

1290
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:24,420
I don't know.

1291
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,140
Like, yeah.

1292
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:29,600
Wait, no, don't say that because then there could be
multiple spiders now.

1293
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:30,660
That's scary.

1294
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:31,220
Oh, no.

1295
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:31,680
Oh, sorry.

1296
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:32,620
There was, actually.

1297
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,920
Wait, speaking of which, there was...

1298
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:34,960
Trauma.

1299
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:36,840
Recently, recently.

1300
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,280
It was, like, my most recent spider encounter.

1301
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,260
There's two.

1302
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,700
There was two of them.

1303
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:42,440
I remember.

1304
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,740
And I was freaking out because there's two of them.

1305
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:55,200
by the way i was like why are there two of them oh yeah i
was scared but oh well oh no why is there two of them it's

1306
01:34:55,200 --> 01:35:01,900
okay i'm not scared of bugs it's okay i'm not that i think
like spiders i think it's okay if there's two of them then

1307
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:09,220
that means it might be two females or two males because like
i think like the female eats the male spider if they're

1308
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:21,480
after so like if if you find out there's one spider left
then maybe you should get worried yeah just maybe after

1309
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:34,800
there's one spider left that means it ate it ate the male
spider yeah well i'm but you're scared of bugs right i'm i'm

1310
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:42,260
okay actually like i'm i'm pretty okay with bugs it's just
if they are on me then i kind of like on me you know what i

1311
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:50,240
mean oh yeah that's why you get the mosquito net yeah yeah
if it gets really bad i remember i used to sleep with the

1312
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:57,500
mosquito net when i was younger i would have like like you
know like the the nets that would go over your bed and stuff

1313
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:04,960
yeah i only use it once i think i really when i was growing
up in asia i used it a lot because i my blood was apparently

1314
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:12,340
really delicious so then i would get like bit very often
yeah so like it's like like for those who don't know chat

1315
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:18,120
like mosquitoes only target you if you have really delicious
blood it's like a particular blood type i don't know what

1316
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:25,700
blood type i am because like i never found out maybe i don't
know maybe there's a record somewhere like yeah i don't know

1317
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:34,340
what my blood type is but um so like you get bit a lot it's
because your blood type is like um a particular blood type

1318
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:40,420
that mosquitoes really really like and so like i had to like
i had like mosquito nets and then i would wear these

1319
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:49,320
bracelets that was like mosquito repellent bracelets and
stuff um and then i would like have to spray my subway

1320
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:59,060
repellent every fucking day uh because if i don't i scratch
a lot yeah i couldn't help myself i would scratch myself a

1321
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:06,220
lot i think i'm pretty similar if i'm not mistaken well i
don't think they bite me that much but they used to bite me

1322
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:13,200
as well i used to have mosquito repellent as well like i'm
but i'm like oh I'm like, oh, I don't remember it's O.

1323
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:15,400
It's the one that can give blood to everyone.

1324
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,100
The O that gives blood to everyone.

1325
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,220
Yeah, blood type O is universal.

1326
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:20,020
Yeah.

1327
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,840
But there's like O minus O.

1328
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:24,580
I would like, I think like...

1329
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:25,840
I don't know which one it is.

1330
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:30,480
I know like my dad's blood is even more delicious than mine.

1331
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:34,520
So then like, I remember like when we go on trips, like we
would just stick with my dad.

1332
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:37,060
So then all the mosquitoes will bite my dad instead of me.

1333
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,600
That was like, you get like a meat shield.

1334
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,440
will target one person and

1335
01:37:48,720 --> 01:38:05,020
even as a kid it's true my mom taught me that I was like
stick with dad his blood is more delicious it wasn't my idea

1336
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:12,460
your mom is yeah Yeah, she thought you well.

1337
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,480
Doesn't she watch your stream?

1338
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,440
Yes, she does.

1339
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:25,580
It's actually so cute, like, family watching streams.

1340
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,540
Yeah, so do you want to say some curse words?

1341
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:31,780
Whoa,

1342
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:36,780
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1343
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1344
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:39,620
I actually didn't expect...

1345
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:40,580
Like, I was excited.

1346
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,760
so scared that we're gonna speak like full Chinese entire
time.

1347
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:44,380
Oh yeah, that's true.

1348
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:45,000
Oh my god.

1349
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:45,600
Bro, okay.

1350
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:48,860
Somebody my chat was like, the worst part was when they fly
around your ears.

1351
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:49,840
Oh, I hate that.

1352
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,880
I hate that so much when the mosquitoes fly around your ear.

1353
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:53,660
Oh my god.

1354
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:54,440
I could never sleep.

1355
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,440
If I hear a mosquito, I just don't sleep.

1356
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:58,360
Really?

1357
01:38:58,660 --> 01:38:58,820
Yeah.

1358
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:05,700
You know, when the mosquitoes fly and it's like and it's
like so high pitched too.

1359
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:13,740
It's like, and then I get super paranoid too because I was
like, oh no, he wants my blood or she wants my blood.

1360
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,620
It's like probably like, I can't sleep until she's dead.

1361
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:20,300
Oh yeah.

1362
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:29,760
I rarely hear, actually I think my room, like I keep like a
can, like basically like bug spray nearby in case.

1363
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:31,860
Yeah, I do have one.

1364
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,800
So I regularly make sure it's like, yeah.

1365
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:41,680
I like, I would like have like I have like, I think like
later on because it got really bad so i had to get the

1366
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:47,300
mosquito zapper you know the blue light the blue light and i
would just sleep with the blue light on and it would be like

1367
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:57,120
oh god yeah i think i bought a racket once i think we oh no
i i'm too fucking scared to use a racket because it's like

1368
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:05,300
too close because you know there's like like and then like
you know like the fly wing like the mosquito wings come off

1369
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:11,780
because you're zapping in and i'm like oh i don't want it
near me so i just have like i just I bought the mosquito

1370
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:17,940
zapper, like, and I put it on the ground, and it'll be like,
pop, pop, pop, like, I think, like, the scariest shit is,

1371
01:40:17,980 --> 01:40:26,620
like, you know, like, when you open the window, you have the
mosquito, mosquito, um, screen, you know, like, the screen

1372
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:33,300
that you push out, so, like, you don't let the mosquitoes
in, but you can have, like, outside air come in, and then

1373
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:38,140
you just see, like, the mosquitoes just fucking be like, let
me in.

1374
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,180
That's just, I'd never open the window.

1375
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:50,840
Like, I would never open the window because I just see,
like, all the mosquitoes outside being, like, let us in.

1376
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,220
Like, maybe it's where, like, the area you lived in had,
like, a lot of mosquitoes.

1377
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,640
Oh, no, no, I lived.

1378
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:00,020
I lived in an area.

1379
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:05,620
I remember, like, growing up, I would always, we were always
living areas with a lot of trees and, like, grass and

1380
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:06,080
everything.

1381
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:12,880
So, so, so I would always do, I would see the mosquitoes
outside and be like, let us in.

1382
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:16,700
Oh, yeah.

1383
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:23,200
Like, the area I live in, like, they did, they did, like,
regular fogging, basically.

1384
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:24,360
Like, kill.

1385
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:29,380
Yeah, because, you know, it's pretty disgusting, like, like,
all the mosquitoes.

1386
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,980
So they do, like, fogging all the time.

1387
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:35,880
Oh, I'm very, I didn't need to use any nets, like.

01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:10,380
Yeah, it was like...

1410
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:10,840
What's that?

1411
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:12,180
Yeah!

1412
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,320
Well, I had to...

1413
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:20,280
So I had to like slam my door like when I'm going out of my
room, I'll just close it really hard.

1414
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:23,200
And it'll like shut up for like 10 minutes, 15 minutes.

1415
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,400
And then I'll be like, ah, peace and quiet.

1416
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:28,580
Yeah.

1417
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:38,460
Oh my god, that's thinking it was just like, hey, that's
this is who's who's invading my home Who's this who's this

1418
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:38,960
girl?

1419
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,800
What is she doing in my home making all that noise?

1420
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,700
I'm trying to find a mate right now.

1421
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:52,680
The worst part is that it got used to it, you know, it
actually got used to my door slamming At one point I was

1422
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,240
trying my best to slam the door.

1423
01:44:54,320 --> 01:45:00,580
I slammed it like three times in a row and it still kept
going It's not phased anymore.

1424
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,120
He just thinks like, he just thinks it's just nature.

1425
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:09,920
He's like, oh, it must be like, it must be like some nature
thing in my new place that I'm living in.

1426
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:14,040
Yeah, that was really bad.

1427
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:17,580
I was like, oh God, I'm going crazy with this decade.

1428
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:20,940
I gotta like sleep in my streaming room for a bit or
something.

1429
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,920
Oh no, that's terrible.

1430
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:24,380
Oh my God.

1431
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:26,500
That sucks.

1432
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:27,940
Oh my God.

1433
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:37,900
just like thinking how did it get in your walls like i don't

1434
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:44,300

how cicadas you know how cicadas like like they they only

1435
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:52,200

that right well i no not really actually okay so you know

1436
01:45:52,200 --> 01:46:00,440
why i've never had a cicada like near my home before i've
never i've never that was like my first time ever and i was

1437
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:08,660
like why is there why is there a cicada in my walk okay i
never heard this back okay so like if you don't like cicadas

1438
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:18,080
are actually like they live underground for like um they lay
dormant for a long time and then like after like seven oh

1439
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:25,680
yeah after like 17 years they come out and would be like
they'd Like, yeah, I don't know If that's like Asia, I don't

1440
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:30,320
know if that's Asia's cicadas, but I know, like Is this the
same as Asia's cicadas?

1441
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:40,360
I am not actually that sure, but I know Like, because like
in NA, it was a problem Because like, there was a problem I

1442
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:47,900
only know that because like In NA Oh, I think I heard about
it Yeah, yeah, so like because it comes out in NA They come

1443
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:58,460
out after 17 years So like in NA they actually have like a
like a calendar to let people know when the cicadas come out

1444
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:09,300
um and then like um so that at one point there was two
cicadas that were gonna come out at the same day like on the

1445
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:17,020
same day which was crazy because like it was gonna be a huge
problem because there's so many of them like some news about

1446
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:25,120
that yeah the news were freaking out yeah yeah because like
Like, in NA, we had the 17 years once, and people were like,

1447
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:28,860
oh, no, there's gonna be so many cicadas.

1448
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:29,840
It looked like an invasion.

1449
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,600
Yeah, there was gonna be an invasion.

1450
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:34,240
It was similar to, like, the killer bees.

1451
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:34,760
Yeah.

1452
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:43,900
It was similar, like, because I don't know why, but for some
reason, we have, like, NA has, like, some fucked up thing

1453
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:50,380
with bugs, because we also had, like, the killer bees at one
point, where there was, like, an infestation of bees that

1454
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:51,540
are, like, the killer wasp.

1455
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:59,400
the killer wasp there was an infestation of killer wasp that
play wasp i'm scared of wasp me too i'm freaking scared of

1456
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:06,520
wasp as well and yeah there was like like a killer wasp
epidemic or something and then like and then people there

1457
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:14,600
was on the news and stuff were like oh no the killer wasp
we're moving to like this area now oh my god be careful

1458
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:22,900
everybody it was a problem yeah yeah it It was a problem.

1459
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:23,540
It's so scary, honestly.

1460
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,620
I'm scared.

1461
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:33,240
It's like, I'm not usually that scared of bugs, but like, if
it's like in large numbers or if it's like, okay, deadly or

1462
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:36,380
something like that, like it'll hurt me, then of course I'm
pretty scared.

1463
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:37,580
Like, okay, no.

1464
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:38,640
Oh yeah.

1465
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:39,600
100%.

1466
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:43,760
Yeah, I'm, that's why this is why I have an immense fear of
insects.

1467
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:45,560
I have such a fear.

1468
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:48,340
I just, I was just, I don't care how small they are.

1469
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:52,060
It's just, oh, they just, they look weird.

1470
01:48:52,080 --> 01:49:02,220
They look funky too It's be like what about butterflies and
I'm like like have you ever seen a close-up picture of a

1471
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:02,720
butterfly?

1472
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:04,780
It's hideous Aren't it cute?

1473
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:05,100
Huh?

1474
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:09,540
No Look up a close-up photo of a butterfly.

1475
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:10,000
Really?

1476
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:15,540
No, they're fucking disgusting No

1477
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,060
Isn't it cute?

1478
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:34,760
mean look it's pretty cute okay your definition of cute is
now i'm judging you it's pretty it's what you mean look at

1479
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:46,600
the eyes what the what do you mean there's millions of
little dots in their eyes what okay the only bug i will say

1480
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:54,700
is cute is the domesticated moth How do you see Like have it
The fluffy ones Are pretty Okay I only think the

1481
01:49:54,700 --> 01:50:00,960
domesticated moths Are are cute It's because they're also
like Extra fluffy But like I told my chat this But

1482
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:10,840
domesticated moths Are We domesticated them So hard That
like Their main purpose Is when they come out of their

1483
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:22,780
cocoons Is to bang Lay eggs And then die five days later
That's their lifespan And because like they can fly because

1484
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:31,100
we domesticated them so like they cannot fly at all So like
their wings are just decorations and then their mouths don't

1485
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:31,400
work.

1486
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:35,940
They're just decorations They can't eat at all so like
that's so sad.

1487
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:47,220
Yeah, it's it's like so fucked up, but that means it could
never fly on me So like I think like insects that can fly is

1488
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:51,560
the most fucked up thing ever Because like, I just don't
want them to fly at me.

1489
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,080
And like, so basically, they can't...

1490
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,180
Their mouths, they can't use it to eat or anything.

1491
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:57,400
It's just like decoration.

1492
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:59,400
So they don't have like...

1493
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:00,580
It doesn't work.

1494
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:01,000
I don't think...

1495
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,940
It's like they don't have...

1496
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:03,860
Well, at least they get to get, you know...

1497
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:05,840
They get to bang before...

1498
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:07,560
Before...

1499
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:10,200
The thing is, I told my chat this.

1500
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,260
But like, the mobs...

1501
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:14,540
Like, the male mobs don't know...

1502
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:17,280
They don't know how to stop.

1503
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:18,840
So, like, they'll be like...

1504
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:27,800
stuck to the female moths and you have to like pry them your
out yourselves because like they don't know how to pull out

1505
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:35,860
so like so like the owners have to like have to like like
like pull them out by themselves like the the breeders and

1506
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:42,580
then because then if they if the male moths don't the female
mouse can't lay eggs so like they would like be stuck

1507
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:45,680
together until they die oh my god

1508
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:55,560
i learned something they would yeah because they're like
because of like the like people have like humans have to

1509
01:51:55,560 --> 01:52:03,800
intervene or the they'll like they'll be stuck together
until they fucking die and the female moss won't be able to

1510
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:18,260
lay eggs so then well wow but yeah and then they starve to
death because they can't eat yeah that's pretty sad but well

1511
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:25,900
that's their whole purpose I think that's like a lot of
insects whole purpose it's just a it's just a bang and then

1512
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:32,080
I mean like I told a story before but like There's a species
of mice that also does it.

1513
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:36,340
The male mice bang so much that they just get a heart attack
and die.

1514
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:38,880
Wait, how much?

1515
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:42,980
Like, a lot to the point where they get a heart attack.

1516
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:47,660
Wait, how much do you have to do that to get a heart attack?

1517
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:49,400
I'm so few.

1518
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:53,900
I think this is a research you have to do yourself.

1519
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:58,820
I don't want to have that search history of like...

1520
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,340
There's too much cardio, you know?

1521
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:12,960
Yeah, like, I learned that in National Geographic about the
mice.

1522
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:17,760
I think it was like, I think it was like, I don't remember.

1523
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:25,960
Like, for some reason, that memory, that fact, the mouse
fact is so, like, ingrained in my head because, like, it's

1524
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:27,120
so ingrained in your head.

1525
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:29,280
Okay, it's like, okay, it's really fucked up.

1526
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:36,380
Okay, because like I was watch, I was like in my
grandparents room and I was like watching TV in my

1527
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:41,940
grandparents room and I was like watching National
Geographic and I rarely ever get a chance to be in my

1528
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:47,700
grandparents room and in like that one moment I get to be in
my grandparents room and I was just by myself in my in the

1529
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:53,360
room and I was just watching National Geographic and that
rat, the rat mouse fact just stayed in my head for the

1530
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:58,000
longest time because I was like the one of those rare
moments I get to be in my grandparents room.

1531
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,180
It didn't so happen.

1532
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:04,140
It was about that I don't remember anything.

1533
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:07,420
I don't remember anything else from that show.

1534
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:11,700
I just remember the mouse thing because I was just like It
feels so interesting.

1535
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:13,180
It was so interesting.

1536
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:14,760
Oh my god.

1537
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:18,880
My mod found the species the type of rat.

1538
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:20,580
Really?

1539
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:22,040
I think it is that rat.

1540
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:22,720
Yeah.

1541
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,160
Oh yeah.

1542
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,320
They found it.

1543
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:29,420
They're like The mouse experienced mass mortality after
mating.

1544
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:41,120
with male survival only observed in the very rare cases when
they actually found the rat species holy shit that's crazy

1545
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:54,380
wow i never knew that i'm learning i'm learning so much
until they get a heart attack i know you're like you're like

1559
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:05,000
But, but honestly, it does look like one.

1560
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,700
It does, okay, but, yeah, true.

1561
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,100
It does look like a human.

1562
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:09,520
It doesn't look like a real bear.

1563
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:15,340
But it's a very, it's, that sun bear has always never looked
like a real bear.

1564
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:22,640
I remember I saw the video and I was like, holy shit, it
does look like a person.

1565
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:25,980
I actually thought I was like, no way that could be a bear.

1566
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:27,880
There's just somebody in the barrel.

1567
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:32,380
He has a lot of skin.

1568
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:35,820
It's like, I think this is my favorite picture of a sun
bear.

1569
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:38,120
I'm gonna, don't worry guys.

1570
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:39,740
Yeah, I'm gonna...

1571
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:44,120
It looks like a fucking NPC.

1572
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:45,260
Isn't it?

1573
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,300
It looks like a game NPC.

1574
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:49,360
Yeah, right.

1575
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:50,940
Because I'm big now.

1576
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:53,880
You're still gonna be resized.

1577
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:02,160
God, I'm like looking at like the even even just randomly
googling it's so weird.

1578
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:06,060
Okay, wait, let me show my chat the sun bear.

1579
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:12,100
I'm looking back at sun bears too and I'm like, oh my god.

1580
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:16,760
Like, like, yeah, I think I saw this image, I remember.

1581
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:19,240
It was definitely this image.

1582
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:21,580
And like I saw this, I was like, no.

1583
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:23,580
Like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1584
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:24,580
It's a person just waving.

1585
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:25,920
Yeah, it is.

1586
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:27,780
There you go, guys.

1587
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:28,720
Here's a sun bear.

1588
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:29,960
This is a real bear.

1589
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:32,180
It's not a fucking 3D model, guys.

1590
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:33,220
It's a real bear.

1591
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:35,440
Look, you can tell it's a guy, too.

1592
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,360
It's really goofy.

1593
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:49,000
It's so, it's so fucking funny.

1594
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,200
I love it.

1595
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:50,740
I love it.

1596
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,240
I love how goofy they are.

1597
01:57:56,300 --> 01:58:03,400
just looks like a human and when i first saw it it was the
waving picture so i was like no no that can't be real yeah

1598
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:11,460
it's just a person waving at the guy in a burst also the
mouth how it's always open oh it's just it looks like it's

1599
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:19,880
just static you know yeah yeah i mean like why are you
scamming us it's a person they're like please please stop

1600
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:29,320
saying our bear is a human being he's a real bear i love
okay i love like the red random like like animals animal

1601
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:36,840
facts and like the red like especially like the pandas i
love like have you seen like videos of like oh of like yeah

1602
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:43,960
i love actually pandas are so cute okay but they're like
really stupid though like like i was watching the video it's

1603
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:50,340
like we have to like we have to literally like take care of
them or they'll like die we're literally making sure they

1604
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:59,320
don't die out like because like without human intervention
like they cannot take care of themselves i'm pretty sure

1605
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:06,080
he's like i was watching a video i someone's like but that
makes them more cute because they can't take care of

1606
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:15,100
themselves the animals that are like a bit stupid are pretty
cute because like because like okay because like i remember

1607
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:24,280
like there was like a video i was watching of like the uh
the the zookeepers uh trying to like uh take care like

1608
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:34,000
trying to because like it takes a very long time for pandas
to um to it takes a very long time for pandas to like

1609
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:39,520
reproduce like i think they reproduce like one like i don't
even know once a year or something not even once a year it's

1610
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:48,820
like longer and but you have to force them to like because
they're never in the mood they're like like like because

1611
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:55,260
like i remember that was watching a video that was a
documentary talking about pandas and like the scientists and

1612
01:59:55,260 --> 02:00:01,300
like the zookeepers trying to make them because like they're
endangered and then the problem was that they had to show

1613
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:17,720
pandas videos of how other pandas being to like encourage
them to get in the mood this is how they do it it's not yeah

1614
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:28,500
yeah and then um And then, but the thing, and then like, if
a female panda has twins, they would, they cannot process

1615
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,840
that they have twins.

1616
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:33,720
So they'll be like, no, I can only have one child.

1617
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:40,700
So what a zookeeper does is that they would like, they
would, because like the baby pandas have to like still like

1618
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:44,920
need the mom to like, like they still need the mom to like
take care of them.

1619
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:49,860
So what they do is that they swap the baby pandas with each
other.

1620
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:56,540
so like they'll be like all right daytime this will be the
daytime you get your mama nighttime we're swapping but then

1621
02:00:56,540 --> 02:01:03,680
the mama can't understand that they just think it's like the
one child they just think it's one kid and then it's so

1622
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:10,560
funny because i was watching a video of how they do the
swaps and all they do is just give the panda like food

1623
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:19,860
they'll be like here's food like and then like just take the
child and then the mama be like food and then they they just

1624
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:31,880
grab the child out of the panda's hand and then like put
another child in his in her hand and she just doesn't notice

1625
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:35,940
she doesn't care she doesn't know this or she doesn't care

1626
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:56,920
yeah it's like yeah food w and like okay and like you know
how like they only eat bamboo right but like bamboo gives

1627
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:09,500
zero and almost zero energy so they have to eat so much
bamboo to barely have energy every day because it gives like

1628
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:18,020
zero fucking energy for a panda and that's why they're
mostly like sleeping because they have to save energy dude

1629
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:30,880
it's actually oh my god it's just like i feel like i feel
like we're just making pandas work like worse as in like

1630
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:34,640
we're making them lazier yeah

1631
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:44,540
but they can't but the problem is like they just can't
survive already they can't yeah There's nothing we can do.

1632
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:45,620
So there's nothing yet.

1633
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:47,080
Yeah, there's nothing we can do.

1634
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:49,720
We just don't want them to die out because they're so cute.

1635
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:51,520
They're so cute.

1636
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:53,080
Like, we have to.

1637
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:54,820
We have to.

1638
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:55,860
They're just too cute.

1639
02:02:56,160 --> 02:03:02,920
But oh my god, if we did not intervene, I feel like, I feel
like, like, I don't know.

1640
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:06,420
I don't think they would be existing at this point if we
didn't intervene.

1641
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:09,340
It's just, it's so funny.

1642
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:10,580
Like watching, oh my gosh.

1643
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:21,760

they're like incredibly clingy too yeah they like there was

1644
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:27,300

Wait, you don't, but I'm not a pervert.

1718
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:46,300
But you can.

1719
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:48,400
I can say it, though.

1720
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:51,740

1722
02:08:58,160 --> 02:08:58,780
Japanese one.

1723
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,180
Yay.

1724
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:00,400

1725
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:04,540
Me and Ty has a negative connotation.

1726
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:05,720
Well, it's pervert.

1727
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,600
Pervert has a negative connotation in general.

1728
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:08,300
It's not pervert.

1729
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:09,060
It's not pervert.

1730
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:10,220
It's not pervert.

1731
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:14,480
Guys, there's no way you could make pervert a positive
connotation, guys.

1732
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:15,780
Pervert is positive?

1733
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:19,240
How can pervert be a positive connotation?

1734
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,080
It's negative in general.

1735
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:22,220
Yeah.

1736
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:26,780

Not with that.

1741
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,000
Can't be a good pervert.

1742
02:09:32,420 --> 02:09:35,780
No way you would be a good pervert.

02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:22,660
What?

1810
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:24,080

1811
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:26,780

Yeah.

1817
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:43,960
Oh my god, it's like sword fighting.

02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:46,300
It's also not even in a pervert.

1819
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:49,740
Like, nobody really regards it as, like, a perverted
meaning.

1820
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,180
It's just, it's just, like, a joke to them, you know what I

When I was when I was a kid.

1913
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:16,840

They'll.

1919
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:30,240

Hamtaro toys and I was like what is this how could you say

1920
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:34,380
that to Hamtaro Hamtaro walked so Chikawa can run

1921
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:45,760
Hamtaro started the cute rodent fad when was Hamtaro Hamtaro
was so fucking old like Hamtaro if he was a real hamster

1922
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:51,920
would be dead right now I mean Okay.

1923
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,480
It's true.

1924
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:54,760
It's old.

1925
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:59,640
It must be really old.

1926
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:05,200
It's like, apparently somebody said 90s.

1927
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:06,120
Oh my god.

1928
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:07,340
Is Hamtaro that old?

1929
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:09,580
Okay, but it's like 90s in Japan.

1930
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:15,640
So, like, by the time it came to NA, like, by the time it
came to NA, it was, like, a lot older.

1931
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:16,640

1932
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:17,380
Yes.

1933
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:19,500
I am very sure it takes years to get.

1934
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:21,460
It takes years.

1935
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:31,660

2023
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:25,950
Bucci was pretty nice.

2024
02:25:26,550 --> 02:25:29,070
I only know it because of the meme, the face.

Like, when she, like, starts dying and then, like, the face
she makes, that's the only thing I know about Bucci the

I like the music a lot.

2030
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:48,790
I haven't seen the show, because it's off like a rock band
it would be sad if it's like the rock band anime show and

2031
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:57,330
then the music sucks like it's all okay okay yeah i think

I have figures of like Bang Dream, the girls.

2044
02:26:41,490 --> 02:26:43,450
Oh, I thought it was like an anime.

2045
02:26:43,750 --> 02:26:51,390
because you were talking about there is an anime but it's
like yeah it's like there's a rhythm game there's anime and

2046
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:57,570
the anime just like came out like not too long ago like it
was like the like those rhythm games where you have to work

2047
02:26:57,570 --> 02:27:04,970
rows and stuff to play it it's like the the circle you know
yeah yeah yeah and then he was like the girl then the girl

2048
02:27:04,970 --> 02:27:11,950
you can call like the cards i think yeah yeah yeah like oh
my gosh it's so hardcore when i see people play rhythm games

2049
02:27:13,770 --> 02:27:14,710
Have you tried?

2050
02:27:15,030 --> 02:27:16,650
No, I'm so bad at rhythm.

2051
02:27:16,850 --> 02:27:17,850
I have zero rhythm.

2052
02:27:19,790 --> 02:27:23,530
But like, people go so hard on rhythm games.

2053
02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:26,670
It's actually crazy because it's actually crazy impressive
too.

2054
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:33,030
Because I remember like I seeing like some, I think like, I
think like when I was in Asia, like I just see like this guy

2055
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:34,330
who just got out of work.

2056
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:40,270
You tell that he just got out of work and he has like those
professional gloves on for the rhythm games.

2057
02:27:40,750 --> 02:27:47,190
And then he would like put his suitcase down and like,
scrunch up his sleeves and stuff put the gloves on and go

2058
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:58,830
yeah I know yeah my my right like I had a friend that had
gloves before like I was just randomly going with her like

2059
02:27:58,830 --> 02:28:07,430
just to hang out together and like we just passed by the
arcade actually and she was like hey can we stop by the

2060
02:28:07,430 --> 02:28:14,930
arcade for a while and I was like okay no problem I like
games so I was like I went in I didn't play anything i just

2061
02:28:14,930 --> 02:28:23,330
watch her go crazy she had like a bag and she she just took
out like these white gloves and i was like oh but you have

2062
02:28:23,330 --> 02:28:35,010
gloves and and she had like this big bottle of water as well
just like ready there and she's like crazy so it's like you

2063
02:28:35,010 --> 02:28:41,250
have to reduce the friction or just screw your combo oh my
god that's so hardcore it's like when like fps gamers have

2064
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:51,970
to buy like pad because the friction will ruin it's just
like that so surprised because she played like I remember

2065
02:28:51,970 --> 02:28:59,270
like at the time I think she was playing osu you know yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah she played osu as well she was like some

2066
02:28:59,270 --> 02:29:05,490
top player and I was like oh god she's this girl yeah she
just played like rhythm games only I think like she only

2067
02:29:05,490 --> 02:29:11,610
played that's so cool though yeah it was like my first time
because I don't I don't I play a little bit but I don't

2068
02:29:11,610 --> 02:29:16,050
really you know go at it that much So I was just like
watching her the entire time.

2069
02:29:16,390 --> 02:29:23,090
I think it's also just like it's like super impressive
because it's like like the dedication to and how fast they

2070
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:23,970
go as well.

2071
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:26,350
Like the like how fast your hands go there.

2072
02:29:27,950 --> 02:29:33,230
I can't I can't see like my eyes are hurting like I'm just
like oh my god.

2073
02:29:33,470 --> 02:29:35,830
How do you know what to what to what to hit?

2074
02:29:36,330 --> 02:29:39,190
I think like but like arcades are like so popular in
Indonesia.

2075
02:29:39,830 --> 02:29:40,950
Arcades are still very popular.

2076
02:29:41,210 --> 02:29:43,410
Like fucking NA, it's like it died out.

2077
02:29:43,950 --> 02:29:44,350
Really?

2078
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:47,370
Yeah, there's like barely any arcades in NA now.

2079
02:29:47,770 --> 02:29:52,990
Like people are just, people would just be like, why do I
have to play, go play in an arcade when I can just play at

2080
02:29:52,990 --> 02:29:53,770
home, you know?

2081
02:29:53,890 --> 02:29:55,910
They'll be like, oh, I have PC.

2082
02:29:56,490 --> 02:29:58,110
I have my consoles.

2083
02:29:58,410 --> 02:30:00,430
Why do I need to go to arcades?

2084
02:30:00,450 --> 02:30:02,430
Yeah, a lot of arcades in NA have died out.

2085
02:30:02,530 --> 02:30:07,270
But like, I know like, because arcades in NA is like a
children thing.

2086
02:30:07,470 --> 02:30:09,350
Like we see it as like four kids.

2087
02:30:09,550 --> 02:30:10,550
The games aren't different.

2088
02:30:10,730 --> 02:30:12,170
Like, like, are pretty different, maybe.

2089
02:30:13,810 --> 02:30:21,550
games as well but like even if they have like some games
that are made for adults like rhythm games and stuff like

2090
02:30:21,550 --> 02:30:29,150
that it's just not popular in NA but like in Asia it's like
it's mostly for adults with like a lot of like arcade

2091
02:30:29,150 --> 02:30:38,010
machines and like the rhythm games and stuff like that and I
think it's also like you know UFO catchers and stuff yeah I

2092
02:30:38,010 --> 02:30:46,890
like UFO catchers I love UFO catchers too but like whenever
I I'm always so sad because I'm like crap I know I should

2093
02:30:46,890 --> 02:30:54,210
just buy the item but I can't resist I just want to try I
just want to try a few times and then I fail and I'm like

2094
02:30:54,210 --> 02:31:01,430
okay maybe I'll try a few more times and then you'd be like
please you know you ask somebody like please can you help me

2095
02:31:01,430 --> 02:31:12,470
ask those at 10 it's like can you make it easier like oh
yeah and also like in NA like we have to have prizes in for

2096
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:18,430
Like you know like tickets and stuff So like if you do well
in arcades Like you get tickets to exchange it for like

2097
02:31:18,430 --> 02:31:24,570
prizes But like I know like in Asia arcades You just play
the game Like there's no like actual prizes It's like the

2098
02:31:24,570 --> 02:31:32,810
prize is the experience of gaming I think a long time ago
there may have been Like I think it's just different now

2099
02:31:32,810 --> 02:31:40,630
Yeah it died out The prize system But yeah because like
there's just like actual good arcade games And stuff Yeah

2100
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:48,310
it's just like you go there and play the actual games and
have fun yeah it's just the experience i'm miss i'm miss ark

2101
02:31:48,310 --> 02:31:55,150
and there's like and then there's like some areas where you
have to be like you have to be like 18 or older to like go

2102
02:31:55,150 --> 02:32:01,850

of like Pachinko You know like Pachinko And stuff But then

2108
02:32:50,710 --> 02:32:59,430
they will have like I'm not a fan of Pachinko It's just I
think Yeah I think I mean that's why they're like Cause

02:32:59,430 --> 02:33:05,670
there's Pachinko There's like Pachinko machines So they're
like You had no children at all But I don't know if it was

2110
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:13,030
Pachinko I just remembered like They wouldn't let me in
Because they're like She's not 18 So she can't go in And I'm

2111
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:15,050
like, but there's arcade machines.

2112
02:33:15,290 --> 02:33:18,430
I see some arcade machines in there.

2113
02:33:19,890 --> 02:33:23,550

Yeah, and they have like crossovers with like different
animas and stuff too.

02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:31,850
And parents can just be there.

2143
02:35:32,250 --> 02:35:35,830
And then all the coin pushers were occupied by the
grandparents.

2144
02:35:37,790 --> 02:35:38,230
Oh.

2145
02:35:39,150 --> 02:35:46,110
I didn't see all these other grandfares just be at the coin
pushers just with like a huge bag of tick Because it's

2146
02:35:46,110 --> 02:35:51,150
tickets So they'll have like a huge plastic bag filling up
the tickets and stuff And then they'll have like a

2147
02:35:51,150 --> 02:35:57,430
collection of coins just like doing a coin pusher I'll just
be like, but I want to play the coin pusher, too

2168
02:37:41,430 --> 02:37:45,010

They gave me their gift.

2183
02:38:39,230 --> 02:38:41,910
I remember their gift is like some wallet or something.

2184
02:38:42,110 --> 02:38:43,930
Not as expensive as a phone.

2185
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:47,270

2247
02:43:28,290 --> 02:43:38,030
laughing at the person all the time and it's mostly because
like um there's like a guy who was like chai jiu du leian he

2250
02:43:56,950 --> 02:43:59,510
oh, just just practice more, but he was a hacker.

2251
02:44:01,630 --> 02:44:05,750
It's like, it's like, you can't like take losing, don't
play.

2252
02:44:07,710 --> 02:44:09,450
Oh, you're a hacker.

2253
02:44:11,190 --> 02:44:12,750
It's really famous, actually.

2254
02:44:12,970 --> 02:44:15,810
And it was because he was doing some weird hand gestures and
stuff.

2255
02:44:15,970 --> 02:44:17,430
He looked like a crab, by the way.

2256
02:44:18,170 --> 02:44:18,810
You've practiced.

2257
02:44:19,130 --> 02:44:20,770
So it's basically like, get good.

2258
02:44:21,910 --> 02:44:22,350
Yeah.

2259
02:44:22,630 --> 02:44:25,490
It was because, like, I think he was like playing
competition or something.

2260
02:44:25,510 --> 02:44:31,010
something and like in the first half he was getting beaten
really badly and like in the second half he was killing

2261
02:44:31,010 --> 02:44:42,730
everybody so everyone was like wait wait a minute that's a
hacker and then he said that he was like yeah it's like it

2262
02:44:42,730 --> 02:44:53,770
was like some whole big statement it was really funny that's
so funny it is like i was just like get good yeah yeah and

2263
02:44:53,770 --> 02:45:02,470
there's another one like i think not that old as well like
maybe late last year yeah late last year as well which

2264
02:45:02,470 --> 02:45:11,070
became really big because it was it was actually a youtuber
by the way that did it um it was like a tournament for

2265
02:45:11,070 --> 02:45:21,390
valorant wait i heard about that did you hear like yeah it
It was like people overseas her talked about it too It was

2266
02:45:21,390 --> 02:45:28,470
so bad It became a meme though Because it was really funny
Everybody started like streaming with like a box on your

2267
02:45:28,470 --> 02:45:36,730
screen Like a box because it was like the hack she was using
So yeah it was like The clowns just a lot Like like what is

2268
02:45:36,730 --> 02:45:44,510
this square It's like Whoa what is this square It's just
like Clara Okay because like people Okay the reason why like

2269
02:45:44,510 --> 02:45:52,470
people overseas knew about it is because we had a similar
instance with like Clara so like it's a I don't have you

2270
02:45:52,470 --> 02:46:00,530
heard about the Clara meme okay so like the reason why we
knew about it is because like in an NA we had a similar

2271
02:46:00,530 --> 02:46:07,970
experience with like but like it wasn't tournament or
anything but it was like this girl that was like she's

2272
02:46:07,970 --> 02:46:19,450
playing CS go and then and then basically it's it's so
similar it's so that showed her her walling and stuff and

2273
02:46:19,450 --> 02:46:24,890
then people in her stream were like Wait, what the fuck
she's hacking and then she was like she noticed and then she

2274
02:46:24,890 --> 02:46:34,110
was like, oh my god It's Clara Clara installed Clara was on
my PC and installed hacks onto my PC Clara, what did you do

2275
02:46:34,110 --> 02:46:34,570
Clara?

2276
02:46:35,350 --> 02:46:38,330
But obviously people were like who the fuck is Clara?

2277
02:46:41,610 --> 02:46:48,550
So she tried to like blame this fucking made-up girl named
Clara That...

2278
02:46:48,550 --> 02:46:48,890
Yeah.

2279
02:46:49,430 --> 02:46:50,430
It was like similar.

2280
02:46:50,830 --> 02:46:58,030
I think because of that, like people just put a box on your
screen the whole time and she was like, Oh, what is this

2281
02:46:58,030 --> 02:46:58,590
box?

2282
02:46:59,170 --> 02:46:59,450
Wait.

2283
02:46:59,730 --> 02:47:00,530
What is this box?

2284
02:47:00,630 --> 02:47:01,710
Oh, it can't move.

2285
02:47:02,150 --> 02:47:03,670
Why is it moving with the people?

2286
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:08,190
I think she said it was like because of her setting or like
she was doing some preset.

2287
02:47:08,590 --> 02:47:09,830
It was like a visual setting.

2288
02:47:09,850 --> 02:47:10,110
Like a preset?

2289
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:11,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2290
02:47:11,530 --> 02:47:12,450
It was like a preset.

2291
02:47:13,070 --> 02:47:15,130
And Erin was like, oh, no.

2292
02:47:15,130 --> 02:47:15,590
Yeah.

2293
02:47:16,990 --> 02:47:17,330
Preset.

2294
02:47:17,830 --> 02:47:18,110
Yeah.

2295
02:47:19,090 --> 02:47:20,550
Oh, my God.

2296
02:47:20,830 --> 02:47:22,270
That's actually...

2297
02:47:22,270 --> 02:47:22,830
People who...

2298
02:47:22,830 --> 02:47:26,630
I don't understand why would you hack, though, in a video
game?

2299
02:47:26,630 --> 02:47:27,870
I think it's better to just admit that...

2300
02:47:27,870 --> 02:47:28,510
Yeah, just be bad.

2301
02:47:29,510 --> 02:47:30,430
Just end it.

2302
02:47:30,770 --> 02:47:31,250
Like, go.

2303
02:47:31,610 --> 02:47:32,010
Just leave.

2304
02:47:32,230 --> 02:47:33,710
I think if you defend yourself, like...

2305
02:47:33,710 --> 02:47:35,630
You can't defend yourself if you, like...

2306
02:47:35,630 --> 02:47:36,630
You can't defend yourself.

2307
02:47:36,650 --> 02:47:37,230
Yeah, you can.

2308
02:47:37,430 --> 02:47:39,030
You'll be known as a hacker.

2309
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:39,830
Yeah.

2310
02:47:40,250 --> 02:47:48,850
So, so most, most, like, hacker, like, like, those, like,
big, like, or like people who are vtuber who you know who

It's okay.

2345
02:51:47,470 --> 02:51:48,850
I didn't leak anything though.

2346
02:51:48,970 --> 02:51:49,690
I didn't leak anything.

2347
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:52,390
It just almost slipped out because like it was just...

2348
02:51:52,930 --> 02:51:55,130
The solo mode thing was like...

2349
02:51:55,130 --> 02:51:56,150
It was just right there.

2350
02:51:56,330 --> 02:51:58,250
It was just right there.

2351
02:52:00,570 --> 02:52:10,770
I almost forgot I never It didn't exist Did you get to play
Alter like New like Apex just update it right?

2352
02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:11,810
Yeah yeah I gotta play Alter.

2353
02:52:11,810 --> 02:52:14,790
I think Alter is a team A team character.

2354
02:52:15,050 --> 02:52:16,410
She's so bad at Solos mode.

2355
02:52:16,470 --> 02:52:25,050
I hate playing her in Solos She has no mobility She has no
mobility other than the portal So yeah I was playing her

2356
02:52:25,050 --> 02:52:25,530
yesterday.

2357
02:52:25,730 --> 02:52:32,650
I played her For a while and then I stopped And now, and
then Ariana's asking, Hey, why aren't you playing the new

2358
02:52:32,650 --> 02:52:32,990
hero?

2359
02:52:33,170 --> 02:52:34,610
I was like, I don't want to play.

2360
02:52:34,630 --> 02:52:35,010
I'm done.

2361
02:52:35,190 --> 02:52:37,310
You're just like, I'm done playing with you.

2362
02:52:37,510 --> 02:52:38,970
I went back to Rafe.

2363
02:52:39,270 --> 02:52:40,070
I was like, okay.

2364
02:52:41,870 --> 02:52:44,110
I think she's really good for team fights.

2365
02:52:44,290 --> 02:52:46,170
Apparently she's really good for rank and stuff.

2366
02:52:47,150 --> 02:52:52,590
Because if you're a very aggressive team, she's really good
because you can like get to places and do team fights.

2367
02:52:52,970 --> 02:52:56,050
She's basically like, you know, like the Octane Rev jump pad
thing.

2368
02:52:56,090 --> 02:52:57,210
I like her.

2369
02:52:58,330 --> 02:53:05,670

Like you just get tired of playing the same character.

2384
02:53:48,510 --> 02:53:50,870

03:02:35,460 --> 03:02:38,540
And she was like, oh, where, how did you learn Thai?

2538
03:02:38,660 --> 03:02:40,240
I was like, my friend taught me.

2539
03:02:40,340 --> 03:02:42,180
And then I said those curse words to her.

2540
03:02:42,220 --> 03:02:44,460
She was like, She...

2541
03:02:44,460 --> 03:02:47,240
If you're in public, by the way, and she was like...

2542
03:02:47,240 --> 03:02:49,400
What the hell would you just say?

2543
03:02:49,620 --> 03:02:50,340
It's like...

2544
03:02:50,340 --> 03:02:51,240
I'm not in public!

2545
03:02:53,160 --> 03:02:54,860
Yeah, it was really...

2546
03:02:54,860 --> 03:02:55,860
It was really bad.

2547
03:02:56,140 --> 03:02:57,440
And she had to hide her face.

2548
03:02:57,560 --> 03:02:58,840
She was hiding her face already.

2549
03:02:59,020 --> 03:02:59,600
She's like...

2550
03:02:59,900 --> 03:03:00,160
Stop!

2551
03:03:00,700 --> 03:03:01,140
No!

2552
03:03:02,100 --> 03:03:03,780
I don't know you!

2553
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:07,140
I like...

2554
03:03:07,140 --> 03:03:09,820
Knowing lots of languages is really great.

2555
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:11,140
You just like...

2556
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:13,000
Oh, yeah.

2557
03:03:13,140 --> 03:03:18,220
it's really funny especially like when you go into public
and then like somebody's talking in a different language

2558
03:03:18,220 --> 03:03:26,620
that they think people don't understand and they're like
gossiping and then you like that happened oh my god no it

2559
03:03:26,620 --> 03:03:35,680
was bro i okay i had like a negative experience with that i
was like i like embarrassed like some fucking mom at like my

2560
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:43,800
school so like i i don't remember where i think like i was
just eating at a cafeteria and then like um i I think like

2561
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:49,920
like the mom and the child like the mom came over to give a
lunch to like one of the kids and then like they didn't

2562
03:03:49,920 --> 03:03:57,520
realize I can speak Cantonese so then she like was gossiping
about like oh I think she was like gossiping about my food

2563
03:03:57,520 --> 03:04:04,500
or something because like I don't know maybe I had like my
food look bad or something and then she was gossiping about

2564
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:12,440
it and then in Cantonese and then I turned around and I was
like oh I know what you're talking about and then she got

2565
03:04:13,220 --> 03:04:14,180
instantly left.

2566
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:16,940
Like she was so embarrassed and then like, left.

2567
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:21,060
I was like, Wow!

2568
03:04:22,060 --> 03:04:23,560
The instant was like, what's today going on?

2569
03:04:24,180 --> 03:04:24,180
Yeah.

2570
03:04:27,260 --> 03:04:29,040
That must be so embarrassing, though.

2571
03:04:29,120 --> 03:04:32,240
I would die of embarrassment, honestly, if that was me, too.

2572
03:04:32,740 --> 03:04:34,580
I was like, bro, what the fuck?

2573
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:38,520
Yeah!

2574
03:04:39,200 --> 03:04:40,320
It's really funny.

2575
03:04:40,500 --> 03:04:41,880
It's actually really useful.

2576
03:04:42,120 --> 03:04:47,960
It's like, you just Assume like you don't know and like
you're like I know Just don't know and then they're like

2577
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:52,740
saying like gossiping in front of you too And then you're
just like bro, what the fuck?

2578
03:04:53,080 --> 03:04:53,980
I'm just eating

2579
03:04:57,280 --> 03:05:04,700
It's like if you're going to gossip in a different language
Make sure they don't understand or you get roasted hard Like

2580
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:14,520
maybe don't gossip in front of people Like don't you'll
never know they actually know Your language and the grandmas

2581
03:05:14,520 --> 03:05:20,700
and oh yeah yeah love the costume especially like if they
think like the person doesn't know the language they'll just

2582
03:05:20,700 --> 03:05:28,980
be like it's like oh you know like how like okay like my mom
does this sometimes like you know like if somebody like in

2583
03:05:28,980 --> 03:05:34,220
front of like if there's like someone that did something and
they didn't like it and they'll like straight up be like oh

2584
03:05:34,220 --> 03:05:44,780
my god this person right in front of them in a different
language and then like they'll just be like They must be

2585
03:05:44,780 --> 03:05:46,620
saying something nice about me.

2586
03:05:48,820 --> 03:05:49,260
Yeah.

2587
03:05:51,160 --> 03:05:56,800
It's so, it's really awkward when they're like speaking, for
example, like we're speaking English one moment and suddenly

2588
03:05:56,800 --> 03:06:01,940
they switch to like, to say, they switch language to like
Cantonese or Chinese or something.

2589
03:06:02,020 --> 03:06:05,300
You're like, okay, they're definitely saying something bad,
I think.

2590
03:06:05,860 --> 03:06:06,540
Oh my gosh.

2591
03:06:06,800 --> 03:06:12,120
Um, I think I remember like, like, I remember like, but
sometimes like, because like, I don't know, like in

2592
03:06:12,120 --> 03:06:17,700
Cantonese, sometimes like, like Cantonese it sounds like
we're talking like super harshly but like it's just like a

2593
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:22,640
normal like we're just having a normal conversation and I
remember like I was like I think I was like like talking to

2594
03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:27,440
my parents about something like something like oh like oh
what do I want to eat or something and then like I think my

2595
03:06:27,440 --> 03:06:32,640
friend was like are you guys arguing like why does this
sound like like are you guys okay like and I was like yeah I

2596
03:06:32,640 --> 03:06:37,680
was just ordering food and they're like oh I thought you
guys were arguing about something like no we're just we're

2597
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:38,220
just ordering

2598
03:06:43,140 --> 03:06:48,820
and chinese does sound like i think if you don't know the
language it sounds a little bit like aggressive but actually

2599
03:06:48,820 --> 03:06:55,580
it's just it's just how you say the words yeah it's just
like the tonal intonation yeah yeah yeah yeah it just sounds

2600
03:06:55,580 --> 03:07:03,540
aggressive people who don't understand it's just it's just
yeah i think certainly other like yeah i think other

2601
03:07:03,540 --> 03:07:08,640
languages as well like you just don't understand what
they're saying but it just sounds aggressive but actually

2602
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:15,640
it's they're like talking about like totally normal things
yeah is actually it's so funny when people like who don't

2603
03:07:15,640 --> 03:07:25,280
understand are just like are they arguing i'm like no i'm
just having a conversation like oh my god have you ever

2604
03:07:25,280 --> 03:07:35,240
watched any like uh chinese movies like like animation like
pop culture chinese movies oh pop culture chinese dudes like

2605
03:07:35,240 --> 03:07:43,680
like like famous ones because i was like thinking do you
know about matau or matau but i think that's because it's

2606
03:07:43,680 --> 03:07:52,240
but matau is like more hong kong though it's like really
popular in hong kong what what's that you know matau matau

super memorable because it has uh because it has like a very

2610
03:08:23,460 --> 03:08:30,140
memorable song and also like there was a scene about
ordering food and stuff but like I think it might be too

2611
03:08:30,140 --> 03:08:41,180
it's just like I don't know if I don't think you would know
it's not old it's not everything I say is old okay so is it

2612
03:08:41,180 --> 03:08:44,500

Okay.

2853
03:22:32,890 --> 03:22:35,490
We don't look at percentages, okay?

2854
03:22:35,670 --> 03:22:39,010
We don't look at the percentages and the stats here.

2855
03:22:40,990 --> 03:22:42,290

3042
03:35:33,790 --> 03:35:39,490
don't know if You know, it's like, like on Steam now, I
think it's abiotic factor, that one.

3043
03:35:39,890 --> 03:35:40,730
Abiotic factor?

3044
03:35:40,830 --> 03:35:44,190
Is it the one that's like content creation, but what is it?

3045
03:35:44,610 --> 03:35:50,250
It's, it's like, uh, half-life a little bit, I think.

3046
03:35:50,350 --> 03:35:52,630
Oh, and maybe I'm not talking about the same game.

3047
03:35:53,750 --> 03:35:58,410
It was another game that came out that was like, um, that
was like the content.

3048
03:35:58,610 --> 03:36:01,370
Uh, oh my gosh, what was that content game we played?

3049
03:36:04,910 --> 03:36:06,070
Content warning you mean?

3050
03:36:06,150 --> 03:36:11,610
Yeah, yeah, there was a game that was like, Look, my brain
is not doing so well right now.

3051
03:36:14,910 --> 03:36:15,710
Abiotic factor.

3052
03:36:15,890 --> 03:36:17,030
I never heard about that game.

3053
03:36:17,190 --> 03:36:17,770
What is that game?

3054
03:36:17,990 --> 03:36:20,950
Yeah, it's like, yeah, I'm about to play it tonight.

3055
03:36:21,330 --> 03:36:22,850
I had no idea as well.

3056
03:36:23,090 --> 03:36:23,610
And I don't know.

3057
03:36:23,610 --> 03:36:25,570
Oh, like the survival crafter.

3058
03:36:26,470 --> 03:36:28,070
Oh, it's a survival game.

3059
03:36:29,030 --> 03:36:29,970
Yeah, I don't know.

3060
03:36:30,090 --> 03:36:30,830
It was I don't know.

3061
03:36:30,850 --> 03:36:31,790
I don't know what it's about.

3062
03:36:31,930 --> 03:36:38,410
But like, apparently it's a little bit like lethal company
and like content it's not really like content warning it's

3063
03:36:38,410 --> 03:36:44,850
like yeah a little bit lethal company but like half-life
inspired or something like that oh wait that's so cool if

3064
03:36:44,850 --> 03:36:50,210
it's half-life inspired but if it's like i don't know i'm
reading it's like a survival crafter so i feel like it's

3065
03:36:50,210 --> 03:36:56,230
like a game that you're supposed to play longer than one
time survival half-life yeah survival it's interesting

3066
03:36:56,230 --> 03:37:01,290
though yeah it sounds interesting yeah i'm gonna be
collabing that later with
