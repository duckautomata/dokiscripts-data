00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,570
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,550
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,090
They couldn't hear you because I had Discord muted by the
way, now they can.

4
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,270
Hello guys.

5
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,430
So first off, at first I was waiting for Gumi.

6
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,030
You didn't download the game!

7
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,670
You didn't download the game!

8
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,190
I said at first, you didn't let me finish the sentence!

9
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,030
It's okay.

10
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,750
It's it.

11
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,930
Anyway, at first, I was waiting for Gumi before I got really
interrupted.

12
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,670
Anyway, and then, and then I realized I didn't install the
game.

13
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:59,730
I thought, I thought she would take a little longer so I can
use that as an excuse for a bit longer but i told you 10

14
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:07,850
minutes and i joined at 10 minutes no no no no you okay no
no wait you did i misremembered i thought you said 15

15
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:17,170
minutes so i thought it doesn't matter i apparently needed
20 minutes to install 44 gigabytes by the way holy why is

16
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:26,510
this game 44 gigabytes why is this game so huge we literally
talked about how it's 15 hours long yeah it's yeah but like

17
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:36,130
there's aren't that like aren't that long that isn't like 44
gigabytes it's a fucking long it's a huge game but anyway it

18
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:47,470
took me 20 minutes to install install and it takes two we
were talked earlier on we were talking about um how we don't

19
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:56,930
want this child because in Gumi's words in Gumi's words she
thinks are kids ugly.

20
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,290
I never said that!

21
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,810
Then why did you want this child?

22
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,850
What the hell?

23
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,450
I don't want you.

24
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,670
You said the child's ugly!

25
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,670
Dude, the child with one cereal and cereal is $8.

26
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,250
You didn't even know it was $8 until I told you it was $8.

27
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,990
You were able to buy the cereal and looking at the price.

28
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,390
This is why we're getting a divorce.

29
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,370
You don't look at prices.

30
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,710
No, it's just I don't buy cereal.

31
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,150
I don't.

32
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,130
You don't look at prices.

33
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,250
I look at prices.

34
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,490
I just don't eat cereal.

35
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,990
Yeah.

36
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,810
Then why did you buy cereal for a child?

37
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,230
Oh, but if she wants it because I'm a good parent but if
she, I don't want her.

38
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,270
Okay.

39
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,010
All of us say a good parent wouldn't say I don't want her.

40
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,890
that's that is bro.

41
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,890
Are you really I'd say you're a good parent after that.

42
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,030
Yeah, you're winning this case.

43
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,750
You're winning this case.

44
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,370
You can have her.

45
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,690
Hey, you can have her.

46
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,490
I mean, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

47
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,830
No, you're trying to purposely be a bad mom so the court
wouldn't give you the child.

48
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,350
That's fucked up.

49
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,410
That you wanted the child, not me.

50
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:14,970
Wait.

51
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,510
Who's playing husband?

52
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,070
Who's playing wife?

53
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,710
I'm playing a husband.

54
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,010
Okay.

55
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,070
Who's going to be playing the husband if you look at us?

56
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,630
I'm pretty sure you don't have a big dick.

57
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,910
I'm sending you a photo of mine too.

58
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,870

63
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,270
I'm sending you this.

64
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,750
I think that's a chat, but...

65
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,630
Wait, I am not...

66
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,070
I think mine is biggie!

67
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,590
Mine is bigger, but yours is fat!

68
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,730
Yours is attached!

69
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,030
Mine is part of the body.

70
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,310
It is not part of the body!

71
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,430
That's a rat!

72
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,350
Guys, this is part of the body.

73
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,410
This is my...

74
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,170
It's a fucking rat!

75
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,490
Don't say that about him!

76
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,890
He gets sensitive.

77
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,630
I know you're working through it, but...

78
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,270
I'll get sensitive.

79
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,670
Don't say that.

80
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,730
He's gonna... He's gonna retract.

81
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:39,790
He's gonna shrivel up.

82
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,650
He's gonna shrivel up now.

83
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,390
You hurt his feelings.

84
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,090
You're gonna hurt his feelings.

85
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,050
Good.

86
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,570
Mine is bigger than if it shrivels up.

87
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,930
Yours isn't real.

88
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,510

89
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,450
Biological.

90
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,870
Hey, if I glue it on, if I glue it on somehow, it's gonna be
real.

91
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,910
It's not biological.

92
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,890

Yeah, no, I used to be like the stereotypical like quiet
girl in school.

138
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,970
But then, um...

139
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,130
There's no way you were like that.

140
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,330
Playing with Clay, I'm talking to Clay all summer.

141
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,470

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,390
You know your original characters do not steal.

You know we love you.

149
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:12,470
Mm-hmm.

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,730
Your mom doesn't love you, apparently.

151
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,210
That means that...

152
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,450
Okay.

153
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,670
Your dad actually doesn't want you.

154
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,790
Neither of us wants you.

155
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,410
We're trying to say we're sending you away to Harry Styles.

156
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,170
The Harry Styles?

157
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,010

The person!

163
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,490
Oh shit, you know Harry Styles?

164
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,030
Yeah, I don't like that.

165
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,050
I call him Harry, actually.

166
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,810
Actually, I call him Harhar.

167
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,070
Wait, what the fuck is that bird thing on her poster?

168
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,310
Bro, she's so spoiled.

169
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,890
What bird thing?

170
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,330
Dragon?

171
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,470
Yeah, no.

172
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,510
Bro, this girl is so spoiled.

173
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,290
This girl has a room that's like twice as big as my room.

174
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,610
Oh, fuck!

175
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,470
She lives in a fucking barn?

176
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:14,910
I would...

177
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,470
Whoa!

178
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,690
No, it's just...

179
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,850
That's not a barn.

180
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,690
It's like...

181
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,250
It's like when like...

182
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,310
Like suburban areas have like those... Oh, no, this is a
farm.

183
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,870
Never mind.

184
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,410
It's a different body.

185
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,490
This is a farm.

186
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,910
That I saw the milk.

187
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,290
and stay Dr. Hakeem, you have to help me now.

188
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,810
What the fuck, Dr. Hakeem?

189
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:39,410
Together.

190
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,770
But where did she get her British?

191
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,610
Oh, her mom.

192
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,250
Okay, I was going to say, where did the little girl get his
British accent?

193
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,710
That shows I take better care of her because she took after
my accent.

194
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,770
Yeah, because someone has to work and make money for this
family.

195
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,490
I'm a doctor!

196
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,210
I'm literally a doctor!

197
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,710
You don't know, we don't know that.

198
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,490
For real?

199
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:09,350
You could be pretending, you could just say you're a doctor
and then like just go out to the bar some shit that seems

That's us.

204
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,010
Does that mean we can't die now that we're dolls?

205
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,270
Maybe.

206
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,570
Yo, the little girl is pretty impressive.

207
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,250
How the fuck did she make a doll with like puppets?

208
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,990
With like crochet and wood.

209
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,190
Did she like carve that herself?

210
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,570
This looks handmade.

211
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:11,690
Yeah.

212
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,130
Oh, she's pretty talented.

213
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,110
That's our child.

214
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,590
Dude, our place is a mess.

215
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,170
No wonder I'm divorcing you.

216
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,550
Oh, yeah, yeah.

217
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,030
It was my fault that the barn's not clean enough.

218
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,790
You literally say you work in the farm and at the barn.

219
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,950
No, no, no, no.

220
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,050
I say I work.

221
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,010
I didn't say I clean the barn.

222
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,510
What the?

223
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,850
Can't keep your workplace clean.

224
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,890
Dude, this guy makes me uncomfortable.

225
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,890
The book of love.

226
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,830
Dude, he has a butt chin.

227
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,730
Oh my god, he does.

228
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,710
Oh, it's not his lip.

229
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,050
Oh my god, you did jump.

230
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,150
Killing myself in game.

231
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,130
Oh shit, we can't die!

232
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,190
We can't die!

233
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,890
Exactly.

234
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,370
Oh my god.

235
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,430
Mr. Um, he's creepy.

236
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,630
I would never want to talk to this guy.

237
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,850
Hey, this could be our, uh, third husband.

238
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:18,450
Yeah.

239
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:18,930
Yeah.

240
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,990
We're, uh, divorcing third.

241
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,430

242
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,550

243
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:28,910
Third.

244
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,350
I promise your daughter to fix your marriage.

245
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,610
How the fuck do you promise our daughter anything?

246
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:58,170
Why would you- girl wait wait a minute excuse me sir but why

So I guess it's just like I'm left.

250
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,370
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:11,730
I think so.

252
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:11,990
Yeah.

All right.

254
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,410

255
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,130
Oh my god.

256
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,070

257
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,250
Be a deer and help me turn on this lever.

258
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,850
Well, you know you're talking to me about that.

259
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,270
Goomy.

260
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:25,950
How do I punch?

261
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,070
Turn on this lever.

262
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,190
Whoa.

263
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,870
Ew.

264
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,690
They're alive.

265
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,190
What is going on here?

266
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,650
I have no clue.

267
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,010
But whatever's going on, we can't lower that staircase
without those fuses.

268
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,410
But those fuses?

269
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,290
They just...

270
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,730
They just ran away!

271
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,670
I mean, did you see them on their little fuse legs?

272
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,930
Worry about that later.

273
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,910
Let's just bring them back.

274
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,510
Wait, we had to bring them back?

275
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,370
Then what's the point of, like...

276
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,530
Okay, do we work?

277
00:17:59,710 --> 00:17:59,990
Oh, wait.

278
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,450
Oh, no, it's just two.

279
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,750
We already got two of them.

280
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,010
That's the easiest puzzles ever.

281
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,550
Yep.

282
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,810
Last one.

283
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,430
Yeah, but do we have to do it together?

284
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,650
Yeah, we don't even have to do this together.

285
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,710
Only one of us has to do this.

286
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,730
Okay, A, okay, A, B.

287
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,310
Where the fuck?

288
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,510
Oh, it teaches us to control us.

289
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,650
It's like Mega Man.

290
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,870
You know what?

291
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,870
I don't even need to do this.

292
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,850
You can do this yourself.

293
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,830
I'll just wait here.

294
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,730
I don't like the sound of that.

295
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,010
Girl, I literally need you.

296
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:40,890
Look at this shit.

297
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,850
Oh shit.

298
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,270
Okay.

299
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:50,090
I didn't know at first I was like it was like one guy Come
on you're strong enough for that you don't need me

300
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,010
Come on what happened to all the horses?

301
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,890
Girl, I'm not carrying them.

302
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,390
What happened to all the horses?

303
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,450
Yeah, but don't you have to like, you know, like What the
fuck is that sound?

304
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,070
Do you hear that?

305
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,790
What is that?

306
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,450
I think it was the door.

307
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,890
No, there was something.

308
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,450
There was a little grumble sound.

309
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,790
Is it one of your horses?

310
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,990
This is why they're divorced.

311
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,370
Look, that's why we're trying to get divorced right now.

312
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,250
Wait, toggle sprint.

313
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,130
Oh, okay.

314
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,430
We got to press that.

315
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,170
Oh.

316
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,470
Wait.

317
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,930
How do we get there?

318
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:28,990
Oh!

319
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,770
There's a wood.

320
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,070
There's a wood over here.

321
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,090
There's a wood over here.

322
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,570
There's a wood over there.

323
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,750
Alright.

324
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,350
Look at that, see?

325
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,750
Look at this teamwork.

326
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,630
And then we jump.

327
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,470
Wait, oh shit, I'm dead.

328
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,410
Wait, what?

329
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,630
Oh, okay, this is why you're the doctor.

330
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,710
And I'm the farm boy.

331
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,450
Yeah.

332
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,350
This is why you do all the thinking for us here.

333
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,890
I'm the- Oh.

334
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,150

339
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,850
The arm here.

340
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,390
I'm the muscle.

341
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,250
You're like the arm here?

342
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,410
I'm the muscle!

343
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,670
Wait, how did you get there?

344
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,770
Oh, this way.

345
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,010
I'm the muscle!

346
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,970
What do you do?

347
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,170
Let's check it out.

348
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,430
That's why... Oh, okay, I did it!

349
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,870
You're welcome, sir.

350
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,970
Sweetie Hey, I think we have to do something back here.

351
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,170
What do you mean?

352
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:54,930
Not for long I mean our daughter's trying to fix our
relationship right now.

353
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,270
What you don't want our daughter to fix our relationship?

354
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,450

Look at the head size.

385
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, what kind of brain can be stored in that tiny head of
yours?

386
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,320

Your daughter?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

395
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,600
We don't own people anymore.

396
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,620
Whoa, it's 2024.

397
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,440

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,420
Explain Powell World.

399
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,560
That they're not people.

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,620
Oh, except for those people.

401
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,980
Except for- Why do I recognize your voice?

402
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,760
What the fuck?

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,600
Sorry.

405
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,960
Looks a bit like a vacuum cleaner.

406
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:04,900
Oh yeah.

407
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,700
Because it is your vacuum cleaner.

408
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Is that a vacuum cleaner?

409
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,720
Vacuum?

410
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
It's not my job.

411
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,760
Dude, imagine putting some vacuum.

412
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,620
You know, the guy could suck up all kinds of crap in your
stomach.

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Oh, ha, no, that's, uh...

That's you!

415
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,600
You've ruined my bowels with all that crap.

416
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,080
That's your purpose, though.

417
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,180
Yeah.

418
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,600
Oh.

419
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,920
Oh!

00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,240

421
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,040
Oh, God!

422
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,820
Is that dirt?

423

That's a lie.

428
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,330
You have two emotes dedicated to it.

429
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,840
I should have never made that bet with you.

430
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,360
We got bored.

431
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,240

Please just take us to the math part.

434
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,900
That is our strong point.

435
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,080
We're collabing right now.

436
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,940

I don't like that he's like humping the air kind of like
he's on that.

438
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,020
Look at him.

439
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,660
Wait, did he like flex his hips at us?

440
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,540
Yeah, he did.

441
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,720
I think we're getting closer because of our hate of this
guy.

442
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,980
Yeah, I think he is fixing our marriage.

443
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,640
Yeah, look, it is fixable.

444
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,940
I didn't know we'd end up in a place where all vacuum
cleaners alive.

Well, now we are.

446
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,760
Maybe we're stuck here forever.

447
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,480
Forever no way.

448
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,420
We're getting a divorce.

449
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,940
I know we're getting a divorce

450
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:29,800

It's not that way.

464
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,920
It's the other way.

00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,550
Thank God.

537
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,630
Thank God we only traumatized one child.

538
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,070
It's alright.

539
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,450
Only one kid will have to pay for therapy.

540
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,370
I'm not paying for it.

541
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,650
I'm not paying for it.

542
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,150
She's gonna pay for it herself.

543
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,910
What the fuck?

544
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,890
What the fuck?

545
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,710
Okay, I'm dead.

546
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,870
What happened to you?

547
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,190
I don't know.

548
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,330
I don't know.

549
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,370
Someone was trying to jump and I thought she was doing the
right thing.

550
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:26,270
Oh wow you couldn't even make that jump I made it man You
know you had to you got to grip onto the side to make it

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:33,250
That's not making a jump If you barely made it it's not
making a jump What the fuck why did you fucking

There you go.

557
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,250
Good.

558
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,390
Does that mean I can leave you now?

559
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,330
What the fuck?

560
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,330
Well, I'm not the one with the third husband.

561
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,030
Hey, no need to be jealous of Omen, man.

562
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,570
Oh, I actually jumped off it.

563
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:38,550
You know, what they say about marriage to death do us part

564
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,450

00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,450
Do you do this?

00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,050
Get in there!

567
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,350
You get in there!

568
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:51,490
Wow!

569
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,830
Look at me!

570
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,550
You fucking bitch!

571
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,770
I'm not even doing anything!

572
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,370
That's just you!

573
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,590
Swap it!

574
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,170
Oh, there it is!

575
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:15,810
I saw it!

576
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,250
It swaps!

577
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,530
There you go!

578
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,490
God!

579
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,490
How do you go non-verbal?

580
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:35,050
You have to go non- Oh no, we have to do this too.

581
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:35,990
Okay.

582
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,450
Goomy, remember all the good times we've had?

583
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,110
Go.

584
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,990
Goomy, remember all the...

585
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,470
You missed that job!

586
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,690
How do we tie him up?

587
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,570
It's because I don't trust you that I'm double jumping.

588
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,310
What do we do here?

589
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,490
Oh, what the... get on the Roombas.

590
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,150
There we go.

591
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,530
Okay, let's go.

592
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,830
We're such good friends.

593
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,210
Friends.

594
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,530
We have to stay friends after the voice for our child.

595
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,690
I only do that to X I like.

596
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,370
All right.

597
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,390
Wait, where's the other end of this though?

598
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,370
Wait, but where do we, do I just like go here?

599
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,390
No.

600
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,410
It doesn't make sense.

601
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,410
Where does the end of that vacuum go?

602
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,090
Oh, I get sucked in in here.

603
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,650
But you could have said something.

604
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,910
Hey, listen.

605
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,130
Every day's a school day.

606
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,390
You learn more and more every day.

607
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,630
You could have said something.

608
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:52,930
Alright, here you go.

609
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,610
What's this?

610
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,190
I turned out the light.

611
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,370
I don't know what it does.

612
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,130
Why did you turn it back on?

613
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,170
Wait, you don't trust my judge.

614
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,330
We're trying to save electricity here.

615
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,050
Girl, I'm trying to take every cent of your money.

616
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,070
Whoa!

617
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,290
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

618
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,490
I thought we signed a prenup.

619
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,170
Wait, you didn't sign the prenup?

620
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,990
I wrote down Kaza's name instead.

621
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,210
That's fucked up.

622
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,650
That is fucked up.

623
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,490
That is actually illegal.

624
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,970
Wait, did you just admit that you committed fraud on my
stream?

625
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,510
No, hey, no.

626
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,350
Hey, I think one of us had to press the...

627
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,310
You know what to do.

628
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,090
You know what to do.

629
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,890
Agumi, you know what to do.

630
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:49,830
Come on.

631
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,930
You don't trust me?

632
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,050
Okay, that's on you.

633
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,810
That's actually...

634
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,510
I didn't trust you.

635
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,970
Go, go.

636
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,830
Okay, I'm going.

637
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,710
There, see?

638
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,750
Oh, you don't trust me.

639
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,330
Wow.

640
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,330
Wow.

641
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:04,510
Wow.

642
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,270
I'm going to do this.

643
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,150
What?

644
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,190
I'm sending over a platform, man.

645
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,150
How is that a platform?

646
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,730
It's this!

647
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,890
This was a platform!

648
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,530
Oh!

649
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,230
Oh, okay, I see it now.

650
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,790
I'm a little special.

651
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,230
But you like that.

652
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,790

00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,090
You get on it.

657
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,410
You're pissing me off.

Okay.

659
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,300

You didn't tell me where to go.

664
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,440
I need someone to tell me what to do.

665
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,920
You didn't aim it high enough.

666
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,220

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,240

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
Are you aimed then?

718
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,800
If you're so good.

719
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,700
I'm sucking it.

720
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,320
It's too late.

721
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,640
I'm sucking it too.

722
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,360
Look, see?

723
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:44,760
Look!

724
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,240
I hit him!

725
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,640
This is the fucking easiest platform game ever.

726
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,140
What the fuck?

727
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,620
What the fuck?

728
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:51,900
What the fuck?

729
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,540
Just run!

730
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,420
Just run!

731
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,020
You can't fucking throw forever!

732
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,580
See?

733
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,560
Oh shit.

734
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,300
I think you can go forever.

735
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,900
No, no, it's fine.

736
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,380
It's fine.

737
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,000
No, you can't.

738
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,660
See, look.

739
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,080
You got tired.

740
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,380
Alright, I'll be at the bottom.

741
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,520
Okay, I'll let you do the work at the top.

742
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,300
Okay, really?

743
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,500
Ow, I got hit.

744
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,960
I fucked up.

745
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,880
Look, I'm sucking!

746
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,020
There you go, there you go, it's coming in, it's coming in!

747
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,180
That's so easy.

748
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,420
Bro, we can't...

749
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,680
How are we supposed to get a speedrun if they're fucking
making us do all this other shit?

750
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,020
I'm pretty sure there's gotta be an exploit or something,
right?

751
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,680
There has to be.

752
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,460
This is the slowest boss battle ever.

753
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,840
Alright

754
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,700
Okay, I can't suck anymore.

755
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,480
I can't suck anymore.

756
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,060
It's the limit.

757
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,720
It's my limit.

758
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,660
Oh Shit I'm okay I'm okay.

759
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh, I don't know.

760
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,580
Why didn't you care about me getting hurt?

761
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,620
And the fuck that you're into my run

762
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,160
Suck it!

763
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,180
I'm sucking!

764
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:22,640
Yeah.

765
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,420
Yeah, I kind of did all that damage.

766
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,020
I don't know what we're talking about.

767
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,590
Hey, I'm back.

768
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,710
Oh, man.

769
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,410
Look, your husband was gone, but you didn't care.

770
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,970
Oh, wow!

771
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,510
Wow!

772
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,070
You didn't even notice?

773
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,250
Wow!

774
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,270
She's already moved on so fast!

775
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,870
Time to finish this!

776
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,210
How do we finish this?

777
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,470
Can we just...

778
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:00,590
Can we just...

779
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:00,970

Oh, that is so fucked up!

782
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,610
Do you think this is too much?

783
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,490
Kind of.

784
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,310
But he tried to kill us.

785
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,410

00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,700
But that human locked us up in her toolbox and left.

810
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,680
Yeah, that human.

811
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,360

Oh, nice.

829
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,160
I bet you can't whistle.

830
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,460
That's me.

831
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,200
I did that.

832
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,220
That was me.

833
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,340
Do you like my whistle?

834
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,120
Stop!

835
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,720
What are you doing?

836
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,900
Why are you having this?

837
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,820
I can't do anything.

838
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:47,820
Stop!

839
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,700

842
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,380
No, go on the other side.

843
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,620
Go on the other side.

844
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,480
You said jump down.

845
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,520
Oh.

846
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,720
Oh.

847
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,200
Oh.

848
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,560
Okay.

849
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,680
I figured it out.

850
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:33,940
Gumi.

851
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,140
Okay.

852
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,040
So you do that.

853
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,420
Oh, keep doing that.

854
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,100
Gumi.

855
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:37,740
I figured it out.

856
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,900
I know how to solve this puzzle.

857
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,920
And that's how you do it.

858
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,600
You're welcome.

859
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,160
This is why I'm the brains.

860
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:44,760
Thank you.

861
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,240
You're welcome.

862
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,240
Your savior is here now.

863
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,520
Ready now?

864
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,620
What the fuck?

865
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,940
You're five.

866
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,220
But how do I get across?

867
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,300
Can I just swing from this?

868
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,200
Oh, can you throw your nail here?

869
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,340
Oh, okay.

870
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,160
What the fuck?

871
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,260
Okay.

872
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:28,910
You suck at this game.

873
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:29,870
What do you mean?

874
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,590
You suck at the game, too!

875
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,470
Why didn't you make them jump already?

876
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:37,270
Why do you need so much prep time?

877
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,870
Why do you need so much prep time, huh?

878
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,110
It's called momentum!

879
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,510
If you were an engineer, you would know that!

880
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,010
But I'm not.

881
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,490
You're the one that settled with a farm boy.

882
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,250
Throw the buggy nail.

883
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:51,550
Where?

884
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,230
Oh, there.

885
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,350
Sorry, I'm done.

886
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,650
Dude, do I have to wait for it to load a bit?

887
00:47:59,210 --> 00:47:59,610
One?

888
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:00,650
I don't know.

889
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:04,590
I think I have to wait for the wheel to complete.

890
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:06,830
The wheel?

891
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,010
No.

892
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,330
Yeah, it has a small wheel on it.

893
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:10,730
Oh!

894
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,030
Here, have a second nail.

895
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:15,910
Can I get that second nail?

896
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,530
I got two nails!

897
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:19,970
Okay.

898
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:22,350
Nice.

899
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,690
Look, see, we're working together like a good couple.

900
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,190
Why is this?

901
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,290
Why do we do this here?

902
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,050
Oh, wait, maybe...

903
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:33,890
Oh, wait, what?

904
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,070
Oh, you have to hammer that.

905
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:35,890
Oh, it's my turn.

906
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:36,890
No, no, you have to come back here.

907
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:37,710
No, you have to come here.

908
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:38,250
Okay.

909
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:38,990
Throw in the hole.

910
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:44,050
Okay, so what I think is that I have to throw it into a hole
after you do that.

911
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:46,970
See, that's what you do.

912
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,230
So when you hammer...

913
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,590
Yeah, so when you hammer it, I got...

914
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,690
I'm throwing it into the hole.

915
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,250
You're lucky I was here to help you.

916
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,590
I think I'm lucky to have you here.

917
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,550
You're so lucky.

918
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,510
You son of a bitch!

919
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,950
You have to come down here!

920
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,150
How was I supposed to know you didn't make it?

921
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,030
Look at the other screen!

922
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,030
You're trying to...

923
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,850
Why would I look at the other screen?

924
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,250
This is your business.

925
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:24,870
Like...

926
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,370
Nice.

927
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:26,510
Thank you.

928
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:32,970
Whoa.

929
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:34,170
God.

930
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,010
I hate him.

931
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,050
Yeah, leave us alone!

932
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,170
We're trying to fix our marriage!

933
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,570
And it's going really well.

934
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:48,050
Right?

935
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:52,830
Um...

936
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,390
Oh, that's kind of cute.

937
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,070
And you will find the challenge you see.

938
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,350
Do we have to do the challenge?

939
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,550
We're not completionists.

940
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,530
I don't know.

941
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:02,970
Oh!

942
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:07,890
I think we have to.

943
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,730
Well, I guess we're gonna have to.

944
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,210
Alright, you want to give it a try?

945
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,770
We haven't got time for this.

946
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,310
Oh, are you afraid of losing?

947
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,330

Don't worry.

1001
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,180
I figured it out.

1002
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,200
You're welcome.

1003
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,420
And then...

1004
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:54,660
Oops.

1005
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,980
Oh, I got two nails!

1006
00:54:59,380 --> 00:54:59,820
Oh.

00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,600
Alright.

1008
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,560
And then...

1009
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,120
She left it way back where she pulled it out of the platform
early.

1010
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,540
I think you're supposed to have three nails.

1011
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,500
I'm supposed to have three nails?

1012
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,660
Yeah, I think you're supposed to have...

1013
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,500
three nails.

1014
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,400
No, no, no, no.

1015
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,900
I have two nails.

1016
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,380
No, no, no.

1017
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,120
I have two nails now.

1018
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:18,920
Oh, you have it now?

1019
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:20,780
Oh, okay.

1021
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,640
And then I do it here.

1022
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,480
Yeah, I'm good.

1023
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,640
Um.

1024
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:27,540
Um.

1025
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,440
Oh, okay.

1026
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,200
I thought I was gonna be stuck forever.

1027
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,100
I thought I actually soft-locked myself.

1028
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,920
Oh, what's this?

1029
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,740
Oh, we got to go here.

1030
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,100
Oh, it's a game for us.

1031
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,080
What the heck is that?

1032
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,880
Yeah, what is that?

1033
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,620
Flip the switch?

1034
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,940
What do I do here?

1035
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,880
Shoot at...

1036
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,160
Use your hammers on a target to score.

1037
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,100
Oh!

1038
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,560
Wait, where's the target, though?

1039
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,540
This is not fair.

1040
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,580
Like...

1041
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,760
You just have to hammer, I have to aim.

1042
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,580
I think you're gonna be sick!

1043
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,480
Oh god!

1044
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,580
Yeah!

1045
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,720
FBS bitch!

1046
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,180
That's what you like.

1047
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,280
Okay, I had to run towards that bitch.

1048
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,620
It's like playing towards your hammer only.

1049
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,860
I have to aim with a controller.

1050
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,960
I'm not a controller player.

1051
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,880
I have to run.

1052
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,660
I have to aim.

1053
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,020
What happened to your- I have to aim.

1054
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,900
You don't have to aim when they- You don't need to have to
aim with a hammer.

1055
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,380
Yeah.

1056
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,080
My god.

1057
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,720
You have to aim at that.

1058
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,700
You have to aim at it.

1059
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Okay?

1060
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:52,760
Yeah!

1061
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,820
You have to aim!

1062
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,620
Cody, don't screw this up.

1063
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,380
Are you gonna...

1064
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,080
Cody, don't screw this up!

1065
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,780
Yeah, yeah, just get to jump.

1066
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,060
Yeah.

1067
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,680
You're welcome.

1068
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,520
Pull it back.

1069
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,380
Pull it back.

1070
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,260
There you go, you're welcome.

1071
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,200
Yeah, oh, you're not patient.

1072
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,580
You have to be patient.

1073
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,720
There you go.

1074
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,620
See?

1075
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,340
We gotta be patient there.

1076
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
You trust me?

1077
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,320
You didn't say yes or no.

1078
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,380
You didn't answer back.

1079
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,020
Nice one!

1080
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,180
Chissed me off.

1081
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:47,940
Why?

1082
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,280
I asked you if you trusted me.

1083
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,940
You didn't say anything!

1084
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,660
How was I supposed to do?

1085
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,300
Oh, what the fuck?

1086
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,480
Okay, you have to, like, I have to aim it so that you...

1087
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,420
I don't think you can make that, actually.

1088
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,720
You have to go through another cycle.

1089
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,900
The more I got you.

1090
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,940
You trust me?

1091
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,320
I didn't realize.

1092
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,300
You have to...

1093
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,460
Wait, how do you get in here?

1094
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,660
hit over there.

1095
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,200
Do you have to land up here?

1096
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:25,880
Oh!

1097
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,040
Oh, what?

1098
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,300
Wait, what?

1099
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,780
I have to jump early.

1100
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,000
I have to go early.

1101
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,660
Oh, okay.

1102
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,080
So it wasn't my fault.

1103
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,180
Oh, but, okay.

1104
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,280
Oh, whoops.

1105
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,560
Wait, where are you?

1106
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,840
Oh, it's here.

1108
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,720
Oh, there you go.

1109
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,760
What the fuck?

1110
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,960

But how do I get out of here?

1114
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,540
Is there anything on your side?

1115
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,580
How do I get out of this?

1116
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,080
Oh, I can jump?

00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,160

I don't know about that.

1135
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:17,620
The book said so!

1136
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,060

What did I deserve?

1142
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,820

That's his friend.

1145
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,180
That's his best friend.

1146
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,060
It doesn't look like your friend's happy.

1147
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,440

It's parkour.

You have to put a nail in it, don't you?

Just you have to hammer it first.

I'm gaming.

1263
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,860
Oh, oh, he's on you.

1264
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:01,600
I just sat in here.

1265
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:04,700
Oh, shit!

1266
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,040
Oh, it's on you.

1267
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,620
Oh, no, no, no, it would have passed down to you, though.

1268
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,140
I was trying to...

1269
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:19,140
Heather!

1270
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:19,640
Heather!

1271
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:21,340
Get on!

1272
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,780
Get on!

1273
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,160
I need...

1274
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,820
We need to close it!

1275
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,260
That's why I married you!

1276
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:37,280
I hear you're the one that's supposed to yell the context
clues.

1277
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,540
Hover, hover, hover!

1278
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:38,920
Get on!

1279
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,260
Get on!

1280
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:39,920
Get on!

1281
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,360
Dude, you suck!

1282
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:50,740
You didn't tell me the context clues!

1283
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,080
That's what marriage is about!

1284
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,060
I don't need to know what marriage is about!

1285
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,520
You're supposed to tell me the context clues!

1286
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:16,480
Look, him, look, this is not my fault, look, marriage is
like a teamwork, and there was, there is no I in T-Gummy.

1287
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:23,280
There is no, really, there's no I, I have to do quite a bit
of communication here.

1288
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:34,740
There's no I, I don't know, I don't feel like I understood
the context clues in, in, don't Where was my context clues

1289
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:35,320
again?

1290
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,920
Don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die!

1291
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,040
Hammer, hammer, hammer!

1292
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,260
There you go.

1293
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:44,840
Are you happy?

1294
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:45,940
Are you happy now?

1295
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:46,700
I got two.

1296
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,580
Oh my god, our floor!

1297
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,560
Our floor!

1298
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,960
It's okay, it won't cut everything!

1299
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:57,300
Ray?

1300
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,020
Um...

1301
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,340
Um...

1302
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,160
See, I told you!

1303
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,660
I can't cut everything!

1304
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,120
Okay, that's on you.

1305
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,440
I swear to God.

1306
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,260
Where's my fucking wife?

1307
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,940
There you go.

1308
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:32,240
Easy

1309
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:42,490
Nice you see we did it teamwork.

1310
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:44,470
Why do the other tools not have eyes?

1311
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:48,930
Eww oh god

1312
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:59,470
I don't like that at all

1313
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:08,690
You saved us from that bro They're all blind.

1314
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,910
You are a true hero.

1315
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,310
Yeah, I'm a true hero.

1316
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:16,770
Wait, what about me?

1317
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:17,870
I did all the work!

1318
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:19,270
Did you see that explosion?

1319
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,990
Anyway, we still have to get to Rose.

1320
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:22,530
Oh, of course, of course.

1321
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:24,450
We did all the work together.

1322
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:26,330
They have to get to the other side.

1323
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:29,170
Ew.

1324
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,190
Step on board.

1325
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:33,350
Really?

1326
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:33,850
Sure.

1327
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:34,770
Come on, it's safe.

1328
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:35,630
Okay.

1329
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:39,090
Yeah, it does not feel safe at all.

1330
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:39,430
Okay.

1331
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:40,670
Don't worry.

1332
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:41,990
He's very precise.

1333
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,830
I don't think that's how physics work.

1334
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:46,170
Oh

1335
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:52,560
no!

1336
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:53,840
She's leaving!

1337
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:54,780
Rose, wait!

1338
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,780
Rose, look down!

1339
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,360
Gamers, look down!

1340
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,960
What the fuck, asshole?

1341
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,200
What the fuck?

1342
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,140
Bro!

1343
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,620
The moment we turn into human form, we burn the book.

1344
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:14,600
For real.

1345
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,240
And we never buy books for a child again.

1346
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,680
Oh, wait, pause.

1347
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,900
Learning was a mistake.

1348
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,380
Okay, that's why I'm the engineer.

1349
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,380
They turn into dolls, and now she questions the science?

1350
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,560
It's true.

1351
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,780
Oh, we can skate now.

1352
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,160
I'm a skater boy.

1353
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,180
Oh, jump.

1354
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,980
I fucked up.

1355
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,220
I fucked up.

1356
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,440
How far is this fucking thing?

1357
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:07,440
Woo!

1358
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,240
It's like Tony Hawk.

1359
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,120
Skater boy.

1360
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:21,180
Yeah.

1361
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:27,090
Oh my god.

1362
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:28,390
How long is this?

1363
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,990
There's another one.

1364
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,810
There's another one

1365
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:38,510
Oh my god, I'm almost there I almost caught up to you all
right.

1366
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:39,530
Oh my god.

1367
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:41,970
I have to wait for you I always caught up to you.

1368
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:42,530
Don't worry.

1369
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:43,530
Here I am.

1370
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,010
Okay, stay right there.

1371
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:45,810
Stay right there

1372
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:53,890
Hello, I'm with you There you go.

01:11:54,050 --> 01:12:02,150
You're welcome I turn it on Wait Go..

1374
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:02,670
You?

1375
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:04,990
You wait right here.

1376
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:06,270
Okay, you wait right here.

1377
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,850
This one's the shorter path, okay?

1378
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,010
You turn not off when I get over there.

1379
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:10,590
Okay.

1380
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:12,250
Okay?

1381
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:15,490
Okay, go over there...

1382
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,130
Go over there!

1383
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:18,390
I'm heading over!

1384
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:19,110
I'm heading over!

1385
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:24,290
Boom!

1386
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:25,550
You're welcome.

1387
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,770
Okay, how about you wait...

1388
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:30,770
How about you wait next to the start?

1389
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:31,990
How about you go back?

1390
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:33,050

I don't... Wait, I can just let you do everything and I can
just respawn next to you.

1395
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:13,130

1396
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:17,190
Yeah?

1397
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:21,470
Do you need me for that?

1398
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:23,690
Do you need me?

1399
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:26,790
I think I need you.

1400
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,110
Oh, okay, I'm here now.

1401
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,230

Wait, we goomy carry, goomy and dokey carry.

1403
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:42,790
Oh, oh, more eyes.

1404
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:46,150
This game has a weird obsession with eyes.

1405
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:46,990
It does.

1406
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:47,750
Thing.

1407
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,210
I know who you are.

1408
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,450
Nothing escapes my lenses.

1409
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,730
Wait, in here?

1410
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:57,310
All right.

1411
01:13:58,810 --> 01:13:59,550
Let's see.

1412
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:00,690
Uh, huh.

1413
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,450
That's a human.

1414
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:03,270
Is he?

1415
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:04,570
That's a human.

1416
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:05,910
me?

1417
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:10,390
What's going on?

1418
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,530
Yeah, what's going on?

1419
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:12,110
Where's she?

1420
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,130
Where are you?

1421
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:14,470
You're streaming.

1422
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:15,470
I need a little nappy.

1423
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:16,910
I need a little nappy.

1424
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:20,090
Neem, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,
me, me, me, me.

1425
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:25,650
Is the rose sat down there with her dolls, and then you two
came alive?

1426
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:26,830
Also, like, it's weird.

1427
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:30,430
That's a little creepy that there's a binoculars up here.

1428
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,450
Like, who's looking at us?

1429
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:34,850
The bird watching me?

1430
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:35,510
Oh, unaffected.

1431
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:36,470
She was crying.

1432
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:38,670
Oh my god.

1433
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,190
Who heard her?

1434
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,010
Can't be us.

1435
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:41,750
We're good parents.

1436
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:42,370
Yeah.

1437
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,910
I bought her $8 cereal.

1438
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:51,950
I bought her that true American doll that she always wanted
every day.

1439
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,970
She gets a new doll.

1440
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:54,290
What the fuck?

1441
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:54,990
Is that where I'm at?

1442
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:55,390
I'm not even going.

1443
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:57,730
No.

1444
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:02,870
We are having a conversation with a pair of binoculars.

1445
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:05,230
There is no logic in that.

1446
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:07,930
We could be having a nightmare right now.

1447
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:10,730
Well, did you believe that you could be turned into a wooden
doll?

1448
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:13,950
Exactly.

1449
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,030
It had to be the tears.

1450
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:20,230
It was a spell I am telling you.

1451
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:22,310
So.

1452
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,330
I knew it.

1453
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,930
Magic was real.

1454
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,150
How do we break it?

1455
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,090
You didn't believe in me, Gumi.

1456
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:30,930
My little pony.

1457
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:33,390
My little pony.

1458
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:34,570
Just give me some space.

1459
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:35,070
I need the thing.

1460
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,790
Virtual wizard.

1461
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:39,810
I'm still a wizard.

1462
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,090
How do we get a kid?

1463
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:51,790
If the spell was cast through her tears, then in order to
break it, in order to break it, that's the laugh you did.

1464
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,890
Reverse it through her tears.

1465
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:56,070
Boom.

1466
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:59,850
You are an engineer and you married me.

1467
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,230
Yeah.

1468
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:11,470

1474
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:18,170
I had an outburst and I had to say it.

1475
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:22,210
All right, let's swing across.

1476
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:24,210
Oh, that's easy.

1477
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,090
That tree is huge.

1478
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:27,230
Don't worry about it.

1479
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:29,270
The ropes will take us to rows in an instant.

1480
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:31,990
Sorry, I was looking at the ladybugs.

1481
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:33,430
Yeah, I was looking at the ants.

1482
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:36,350
Okay, we don't jump that way, by the way.

1483
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:37,590
We don't jump the left side.

1484
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,790
It's the right side.

1485
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,010
It's the other side.

1486
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:44,310
It's the side I didn't look at.

1487
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:45,250
Oh, there's a plane!

1488
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:46,250
Look at this!

1489
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:47,830
Right here!

1490
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:48,870
Oh, throw it!

1491
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:49,410
Throw it!

1492
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:50,490
Where do I throw it?

1493
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:52,890
Oh, no, wherever you want!

1494
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:53,570
Okay.

1495
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:56,110
Wee.

1496
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:58,070
Wee.

1497
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,390
Where is it going?

1498
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:01,790
We'll never know.

1499
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:04,570
Um, did you build a tree house for Rose?

1500
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:05,290
No.

1501
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:06,570
Why do you ask?

1502
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:07,710
There are windows.

1503
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:08,590
Oh.

1504
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:09,610
There's windows.

1505
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,370
Oh, we're going to build those.

1506
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:11,150
Oh.

1507
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,390
Oh, who lives there?

1508
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,870
I don't know, tree people, I guess.

1509
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:17,810
They exist?

1510
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,670
I mean, if magic exists, tree people exist too, right?

1511
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:24,950
Why are you not waiting up for me?

1512
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:26,330
I'm right behind you.

1513
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,230
You told me to throw in a paper airplane!

1514
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,490
No, no, no, it took 50 years.

1515
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,230
It's a heavy...

1516
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:35,510
Look, it's a heavy airplane, okay?

1517
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:38,750
I'm not as jacked as I was before when you married me.

1518
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:40,250
Okay.

1519
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:41,610
Yeah.

1520
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:49,350
That's because all you do is do your farm work and then eat
them goddamn potato chips Yeah, but we get fresh potato

1521
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,350
chips because of meat.

1522
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:54,570
Those are your favorite potato chips I actually don't like
chips.

1523
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:55,450
So you lied.

1524
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:56,870
So you lied to my face.

1525
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:58,190
I don't like chips at all.

1526
01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:58,930
You lied

1527
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,340
You're welcome.

1528
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:18,320
I grew those Trust me, I need their rice crackers.

1529
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:24,640
I think I was like, lying isn't good for a marriage, you
know?

1530
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,640
I was eating senbei.

1531
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,860
You're so lucky I only had one cracker left on my table.

1532
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,060
That was perfect timing.

1533
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,340
What the fuck?

1534
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,620
Oh my god, it's a fucking rat.

1535
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,220
Dude, I think that's a squirrel.

1536
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,660
No, it's a fucking rat.

1537
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,680
Squirrels are just tree rats.

It's important.

1545
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,460
Have you heard of this book by, um, Dr. Hakim?

1546
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,100
He says that it's important to forgive each other.

1547
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,860
This is so fucked up.

1548
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,180
Imagine, like, you're a daughter.

1549
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,780
Talking to your dad about something important.

1550
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,500
He's just sitting there ignoring your ass.

1551
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,660
Oh, that is.

1552
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,460
That's trauma.

1553
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,000
It's okay.

1554
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,960
She's already gonna get therapy anyway.

1555
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,000
This is just gonna be okay.

1556
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,400
It's okay.

1557
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:54,720
It's okay.

1558
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:56,180
She's already getting therapy anyway.

1559
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,660
It's a two-for-one deal.

1560
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,880
Yeah, she might as well.

1561
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,260
Oh, the extra trauma doesn't doesn't matter.

1562
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,200
What the fuck?

1563
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,360
We're getting interrogated.

Are you in with the wasp?

1565
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,820

Yeah, it's not like they could have guns.

1583
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:50,050
It must be like a broken knife or some shit.

1584
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,720
Oh, it's like, look at that tiny knife.

01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,940

1609
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:30,690
I get the fucking bazooka bitch We sent in an undercover
agent to good operator As planned, the wasps believed the

1610
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,030
robot was their real queen.

1611
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:37,550
But instead of wiping out the wasps, our agent was seduced
by its power and switched sides.

1612
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:42,170
Oh my god.

1613
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:47,010
The agent went rogue.

1614
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:47,890
Uh-huh.

1615
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:52,190
The wasps cannot take our nuts.

1616
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:55,110
There's nobody this game takes 15 hours.

1617
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:59,190
Oh, wait, we're like speedrunning this shit.

1618
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,730
Yeah, I feel like we're already, like, 30% way through.

1619
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:05,450
How far, how much have we finished in this game, guys?

1620
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,030
We got through two bosses already.

1621
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:13,830
The vacuum and within an hour and 30 minutes.

1622
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:16,130
Yeah, yeah, fine, fine.

1623
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:20,190
But we wouldn't even be here if you had it knocked on the
squirrel's door.

1624
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,290
We're not even at 10% of the game.

1625
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:23,030
Oh.

1626
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:24,730
You believe that?

1627
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:26,210
I don't trust those squirrels.

1628
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,890
I don't believe me.

1629
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:30,130
That was a blessing.

1630
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:31,870
Oh, what?

1631
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:36,950
My underwear is now a sophisticated part of a flying
machine.

1632
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:39,070
I sincerely doubt it can fly.

1633
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:40,230
Of course you do.

1634
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:44,850
You never take anything I do seriously.

1635
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:45,510
Wait.

1636
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:48,690
To get back to my real body so that we can get divorce.

1637
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:49,290
Yeah!

1638
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:51,410
Me too.

1639
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:52,410
Oh.

1640
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:53,230
May?

1641
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:54,150
May?

1642
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:54,670
What now?

1643
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:56,130
I guess it's time to kill someone.

1644
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:56,710
Divorce happened early.

1645
01:25:56,970 --> 01:25:58,070
Look at that!

1646
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:58,810
Well, look at that!

1647
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:01,330
They answered our prayers.

1648
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:09,530
Oh, apparently we just completed chapter one.

1649
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:11,610
That was actually chapter one.

1650
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:15,630
Okay, how does this work?

1651
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,430
It's not fair.

1652
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:23,250
Why do you get the cool zone?

1653
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:28,830
Where am I?

1654
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:29,450
What the hell?

1655
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,510
Are you not here yet?

1656
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:36,750
Oh.

1657
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:39,450
I was testing out my gun.

1658
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:54,530
My thing is like fuel.

1659
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:59,090
Okay, you shoot it at the pile of sticks over there.

1660
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,190
My thing is like fuel.

1661
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:00,830
Okay, you shoot.

1662
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:01,970
Okay, you shoot.

1663
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:03,470
The pile of sticks over there.

1664
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:08,430
See, this is why we're good together.

1665
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,190
Here are the context clues.

1666
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:14,510
I'll just watch you fire that shit away.

1667

01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:28,130
Oh, it's the practice.

1673
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,350
We don't need practice.

1674
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:29,950
We're good.

1675
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:30,870
We're good at this.

1676
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:32,710
We don't need practice.

1677
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,370

01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,800
My gun's kind of weak.

1790
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:03,500
What the fuck?

1791
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,860
Your gun is so weak.

1792
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:07,980
There you go.

1793
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,160
Look at that.

1794
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:10,700
Goo.

1795
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,880
Now understand why I'm the goo.

1796
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,660
What does that mean?

1797
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,880
Holy husbands, no.

1798
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,640
Oh.

1799
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:30,320
Hey, I wonder what these buttons do.

1800
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:32,340
What the hell?

1801
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,520
Oh my god, they have a torture chamber.

1802
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,620
Yeah, they do.

1803
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:38,780
What is this?

1804
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,260
What happens?

1805
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,360
Nice move.

1806
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,120
Oh, shit.

1807
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:47,900
What about this?

1808
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:48,920
Oops.

1809
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,040
Wrong button.

1810
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,020
Oh, you're an acorn.

1811
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,300
How did they turn you into an acorn?

1812
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:57,420
Where did you go?

1813
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,700
There you go.

1814
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:03,480
You're welcome.

1815
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:05,740
Wait, what?

1816
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:06,020
You're welcome.

1817
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:08,700
Wait, what?

1818
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:09,620
Oh, I got you out.

1819
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:13,960
Dude, they have a fucking torture chamber for the walls.

1820
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:14,660
I know.

1821
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:15,280
Get out.

1822
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,020
Wait, you can just turn them into any cores forever.

1823
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,280
So you eat them.

1824
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:22,900
Oh.

1825
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:30,370
Wait, do we go this way?

1826
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:32,450
This lid doesn't look so stable.

1827
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:35,750
Hang on, those are interesting calculations.

1828
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:38,090
Over here, over here.

1829
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:39,270
Corrosive.

1830
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:40,770
Chain reaction.

1831
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:42,270
Wait, what?

1832
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:44,130
Do I just put this?

1833
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:48,660
What's it do?

1834
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:48,940
Oh!

1835
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,140
The latches, they're opening.

1836
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:51,620
Oh!

1837
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,380
I got it.

1838
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:53,540
Oh.

1839
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:54,260
Okay, you gotta wait.

1840
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:54,880
You gotta wait.

1841
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:55,800
You gotta wait.

1842
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:58,580
I made a circle.

1843
01:36:58,860 --> 01:36:59,500
Do you like it?

1844
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,180
It's my artwork.

1845
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,140
Wait, this one.

1846
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:02,740
You missed that one.

1847
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:03,700
Okay, wait.

1848
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,660
Sorry, I'm not good at...

1849
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,420
I need more practice, please.

1850
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,920
Let me go to that bathroom real quick.

1851
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:15,920
Oh, no.

1852
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:16,940
Oh, no.

1853
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:18,340
It's...

1854
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:18,620
Oh, no.

1855
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:19,560
Give me a sec.

1856
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:22,860
Whoa!

1857
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,480
Looks like something was kept in here.

1858
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:26,260
Oh.

1859
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,820
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

1860
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:33,020
Oh, it could be like the queen, the queen wasp.

1861
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:35,720
What do we do for this?

1862
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:38,760
Oh.

1863
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,040
It's ready.

1864
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:44,940
It's pulling it over.

1865
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:45,940
Oh, okay.

1866
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,260
And then you...

1867
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:57,420
Yeah, I was gonna say you get rid of that and then you get
rid of of that and then you get rid of that not to get rid

1868
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:04,100

1869
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,460

01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,540
Easy.

1873
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,660
Easiest fucking fight of my life.

1874
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:39,540
Look at that!

1875
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,400
There's nothing!

1876
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:41,720
Yeah!

1877
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:47,400
Okay, simmer down, Simon.

1878
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:49,120
Yeah, Simon.

1879
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:53,440
It's not a weapon, it's how we use it.

1880
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:56,200
Why do we do this?

1881
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:58,900
There's some acorns over here.

1882
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,820
Do those acorns matter?

1883
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:05,280
Oh, I know, I know, I know.

1884
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,200
We light it.

1885
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:08,160
Yeah.

1886
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:10,460
Yeah, and then you blow it up.

1887
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,200
I think you go up there.

1888
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:12,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1889
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,160
And then...

1890
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:19,660
Oh, oh, I get it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I
got it.

1891
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,320
You have to blow this and the other one.

1892
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:24,280
Give me a sec.

1893
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,640
I'll let you know when to blow it up.

1894
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:27,980
Look, we're working together, Gumi!

1895
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:30,620
Maybe this marriage is salvageable!

1896
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:36,300
Okay, you blow like this up, and then blow this up first,
the first one.

1897
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,480
And then the second one.

1898
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:43,600
And then I leave you for another woman.

1899
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,920
And then I guess I just go, fuck myself.

1900
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:45,640
Yeah.

1901
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,320
Hey, May?

1902
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,340
I think there's a bridge here.

1903
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,740
Let's knock it down, then.

1904
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:51,720
There is?

1905
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:54,760
Ow.

1906
01:39:58,630 --> 01:39:59,030
Ow.

1907
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:00,910
Here?

1908
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:04,610
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1909
01:40:04,730 --> 01:40:05,210
I figured it out.

1910
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:05,950
I figured it out.

1911
01:40:09,490 --> 01:40:09,710
Throw it.

1912
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:09,830
Look.

1913
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:10,390
Yeah.

1914
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:12,410
I did it.

1915
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:12,790
See?

1916
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:14,810
I will never leave you.

1917
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:15,950
I told you.

1918
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:16,870
I'll never leave you.

1919
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:18,050
I thought we were getting divorced.

1920
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:19,970
You're literally leaving through divorce.

1921
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:21,510
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1922
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:22,470
No, no, no, no, no.

1923
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:23,490
Oh, you have to shoot that.

1924
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,810
You shoot through that?

1925
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:27,710
Yeah.

1926
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:28,810
Yeah.

1927
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:30,790
You asked for the divorce.

1928
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:33,110
No, you did.

1929
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,770
No, you asked for it.

1930
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,290
I disagreed.

1931
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,870
What the fuck just happened to me?

1932
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:40,930
I came like lied.

1933
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:41,850
Yeah, you lied.

1934
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:42,770
I saw that.

1935
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:44,130
Look how fun.

1936
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:46,330
Wait, what's this?

1937
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:47,310
Oh, it's a tug of war.

1938
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,310
I got the fastest figures in the West.

1939
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:51,370
Oh.

1940
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:52,450
I'm on the right side.

1941
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:52,950
I'm green.

1942
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:54,210
I feel... Oh.

1943
01:40:58,190 --> 01:40:59,430
I'm ready.

1944
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:02,670
I'm ready.

1945
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:08,100
I played Mario Party.

1946
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:13,460
What the fuck?

1947
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:16,850
No,

1948
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:26,270
no, no, we're back.

1949
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:31,930
Back to Mario Party.

1950
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:34,310
Like, my fingers are tired today.

1951
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:34,730
Okay.

1952
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:35,470

Yeah, I played Mario Party.

1955
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:45,560
Would you play it on that?

1956
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,260
You want to go?

1957
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:48,700
No, it's okay.

1958
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,840
He's really good with your fingers, apparently.

Yeah.

01:42:51,230 --> 01:42:51,750
Oh, what?

1973
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:53,370
You weren't here the entire time?

1974
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,570
I'm here, don't worry.

1975
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:58,170
You don't have to worry.

1976
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:00,110
Gumi, I'm here, Gumi.

1977
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:02,610
Don't worry.

1978
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:03,370
Don't worry.

1979
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:07,970
I'm like right behind you.

1980
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:10,330
Say something.

1981
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:13,270
Oh, someone died.

1982
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:14,910
Okay, that's bullshit.

1983
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:16,990
You fucking activated it.

1984
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:18,870
Where am I?

1985
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:20,010
Oh, my God.

1986
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:20,750
I'm getting lost.

1987
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:21,750
I didn't activate shit.

1988
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:24,310
I'm getting lost because of you.

1989
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:29,710
Oh, my God.

1990
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:32,770
Okay, we're fine.

1991
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:34,210
We're fine.

1992
01:43:34,970 --> 01:43:39,510
Maybe I should just keep dying because apparently when I
die, I just respond to wherever you are.

1993
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:41,350
Like...

1994
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:48,500
Oh, this has to be a boss fight.

1995
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:51,760
No, this has to be a mini fight.

1996
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,920
Too early for the boss.

1997
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,420
That's true.

1998
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:54,860
That's true.

1999
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:55,980
It looks like a mini fight.

2000
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,300
May the acorn be with you, they said.

2001
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:03,500
Alright, let's see.

2002
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,680
Oh, we just turn it.

2003
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:08,360
Yeah.

2004
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:13,090
There's nothing wrong with that.

2005
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:13,710
We just turn.

2006
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:15,730
Oh.

2007
01:44:16,110 --> 01:44:19,070
Oh, oh, and then the wasp come in while we turn.

2008
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:21,630
Um, okay.

01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:24,910
They're all down.

2011
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:25,410
It's up to you.

2012
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:26,090
They're all down.

2013
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:30,090
Is there any more?

2014
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:31,790
They're down.

2015
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:32,770
They're down.

2016
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:33,330
They're down.

2017
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:33,850
They're down.

2018
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:37,170
Keep turning.

2019
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:37,990
I'm still turning.

2020
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:45,590
Oh, shield shield was.

2021
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:47,630
This one looks tougher than the other.

They start birthing like male soldiers and in the moment the
Queen Anne is pregnant They like kick them out.

01:47:15,490 --> 01:47:18,810
Yeah, someone's like they mate with a drone and then the
drone dies.

Nice.

2233
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,440
Can you, like, get closer to the camera?

2234
01:52:58,660 --> 01:52:59,400
Can you...

2235
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,720
What do you mean can I get closer to the camera?

2236
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:03,680

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:06,760
Get closer.

2241
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:08,340

01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:08,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2243
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:09,400

Okay, okay, move a little bit more left to the left.

2248
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:22,480
Let me see.

2249
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,460
Back up, back up.

2250
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:29,580
Oh, yeah, okay.

2251
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:30,980

Okay, there you go.

2253
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,340
That's all I wanted.

2254
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,300
Oh, man, they're fighting it.

2255
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:43,300
It's like a history lesson.

2256
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:45,880
Oh, there's a timer.

2257
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,340
Oh, there's a timer!

2258
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:51,260
Those squirrels have some weird machines.

2259
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,980
Is that us?

2260
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:54,240
Look at us.

2261
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:56,820
That's us.

2262
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:58,340
Oh, wait.

2263
01:53:58,480 --> 01:53:59,320
Is this a puzzle?

2264
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:00,760
No.

2265
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:02,240
I think this is just for fun, man.

2266
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:02,880
Oh, okay.

2267
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,180
Oh, my God.

2268
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,800
This is our best photo yet!

2269
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,070
Wait, let me see.

2270
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,300
What the fuck?

2271
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:12,460
I'm not bad.

2272
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,340
What the hell?

2273
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:21,360
No, I'm a great photographer.

2274
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:22,220
I need to go.

2275
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:23,680
I need me to go.

2276
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,620
What about my photo?

2277
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,720
What about my photo?

2278
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:29,560
Okay.

2279
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:31,380
Let me go.

2280
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,340
How do you want me to pose?

2281
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:36,200
How do you want me to pose?

2282
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:43,140
It's beautiful.

2283
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:45,740
What the hell?

2284
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:48,000
Look at this.

2285
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:49,200
Look at that.

2286
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,200
That's pretty good.

2287
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:51,200
I know.

2288
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:53,100
Yeah, hey, that's very good.

2289
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,100
That was a really good photo.

2290
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,260
Oh, these are like all the photos she must have.

2291
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,540
Wait, who took these photos?

2292
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:04,120
Wait a minute.

2293
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:05,500
The squirrels did, man.

2294
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:08,460
Yeah, but there's like a creep shots of us, too.

2295
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:09,800
Oh, that definitely looks like...

2296
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,600
Yeah, it's time to go down.

2297
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,900
There's a lot of creep shots of us, though.

2298
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:14,960
Ducky?

2299
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:15,500
Yeah.

2300
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,500
I think they're breaking out the big guns now.

2301
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:17,920
Oh.

2302
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:22,300
Oh my god.

2303
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,500
Oh, it is a hammer!

2304
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:26,460
Oh god.

2305
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:26,800
I died.

2306
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:27,880
I died.

2307
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:28,080
I died.

2308
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:28,380
I died.

2309
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,280
Oh god.

2310
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:41,560
Where's the HP?

2311
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:43,260
Okay.

2312
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:46,800
Oh god.

2313
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:47,480
There's so many.

2314
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,380
There's so many.

2315
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:49,260
Okay.

2316
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:50,260
She's...

2317
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:50,960
They're full of honey.

2318
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:51,820
They're full of honey.

2319
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,300
Oh god.

2320
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:56,000
They're full of honey.

2321
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:58,040
Oh.

2322
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:58,860
Oh.

2323
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:01,780
Oh, I'm dead.

2324
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:02,120
I'm dead.

2325
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:04,750
I'm okay.

2326
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:05,130
I'm okay.

2327
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:06,250
You can die now.

2328
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:07,190
What?

2329
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:09,450
But not really, not really, not really.

2330
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:12,190
Oh, God.

2331
01:56:13,850 --> 01:56:14,150
It's fine.

2332
01:56:14,290 --> 01:56:14,470
It's fine.

2333
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:14,730
It's fine.

2334
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:15,130
It's fine.

2335
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:17,330
We're good.

2336
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:18,310
We're good.

2337
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:19,030
I'm...

2338
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:20,770
Whoa, there's so many bees.

2339
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:22,570
There's more.

2340
01:56:23,110 --> 01:56:24,170
How is there more?

2341
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:27,430
Oh, God.

2342
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:31,050
Are we supposed to, like, do a goof this?

2343
01:56:32,350 --> 01:56:33,290
Wait a minute.

2344
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:35,010
I don't think so.

2345
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:35,730
I don't think so.

2346
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:36,350
I don't think so.

2347
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:37,030
No, I think it.

2348
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:37,750
I think we were.

2349
01:56:37,790 --> 01:56:38,990
We were supposed to.

2350
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:42,170
I don't think so.

2351
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:42,970
Oh, okay.

2352
01:56:45,490 --> 01:56:46,510
Doki, go for him.

2353
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:47,150
Go for him.

2354
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:53,300
Okay.

2355
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:55,840
Nice.

2356
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,140
Look, I don't want to get dehydrated.

2357
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:02,160
Okay, I got the first box.

2358
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,320
Okay, there you go.

2359
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:04,240
All right.

2360
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:05,840
I'm pooping.

2361
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:08,200
Where is it?

2362
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:09,080
Where was it?

2363
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:10,920
I don't know!

2364
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:20,310
There you go.

2365
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:20,890
How?

2366
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:21,910
What?

2367
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:23,830
Oh, you stupid son of a bitch.

2368
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:26,150
Oh, I'm coming over, I'm coming over!

2369
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:27,330
Oh, I'm here!

2370
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:28,130
Stop, stop, stop!

2371
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:29,850
Why me?

2372
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:30,390
Why me?

2373
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:30,930
Why me?

2374
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:32,210
Why me?

2375
01:57:32,710 --> 01:57:33,490
Why me?

2376
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:36,810
Okay.

2377
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:40,750
But...

2378
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:41,050
Whoa.

2379
01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:42,110

2380
01:57:42,650 --> 01:57:43,630

2381
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:46,070

2387
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:56,870
It's already gooped!

2388
01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:57,230
It's already!

2389
01:57:57,330 --> 01:57:57,490
Okay.

2390
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:03,590
Jesus Christ, how many fucking bees are we killing?

2391
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:06,270
In front of me!

2392
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:07,710
Okay, I'm just gonna jump.

2393
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:08,910
You know, we don't even need to goop this.

2394
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:09,550
We can just jump.

2395
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:11,010
By the way, I just noticed.

2396
01:58:11,810 --> 01:58:13,130
Well, we need goop this one.

2397
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:15,790
What do you think I'm doing?

2398
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:16,410
What do you think I'm doing?

2399
01:58:16,530 --> 01:58:17,150
What do you think I'm doing?

2400
01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:20,710
What why?

2401
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:22,090
Why did you die?

2402
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:23,710
What do you mean?

2403
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:25,730
How did I die?

2404
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:27,870
Why the fuck did you die?

2405
01:58:28,490 --> 01:58:29,870
What did you mean?

2406
01:58:33,650 --> 01:58:35,170
What the fuck did you die?

2407
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:38,390
I wonder how.

2408
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:40,330
I think we need to have that way.

2409
01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:41,590
Come on.

2410
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,350
Are you kids winning this?

2411
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:47,950

01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:49,550
Help me out.

2413
01:58:50,010 --> 01:58:50,850
Help me out?

2414
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:52,030
By boat.

2415
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:52,910
Is this a boat?

2416
01:58:53,090 --> 01:58:53,770
All right, come on.

2417
01:58:54,270 --> 01:58:54,950
There we go.

2418
01:58:57,110 --> 01:58:58,470
Now there's water.

2419
01:58:59,070 --> 01:59:00,510
Now it's the water level.

2420
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:01,870
Everybody's favorite.

2421
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:05,770
Everybody loves water levels.

2422
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:08,030
I love the water level music.

2423
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:10,190
Don't we need like ores or something?

2424
01:59:10,650 --> 01:59:12,010
We don't need ores, Cody.

2425
01:59:12,110 --> 01:59:12,930
We've got an engine.

2426
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:13,810

2427
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:14,450

Wait, it doesn't even do damage if I hit it.

2433
01:59:58,550 --> 02:00:00,850
You have to make sure we don't land in the mines.

2434
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:05,070
Why can't I see that one?

2435
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:14,470
All I'm saying is that you have to make sure we don't land
in the mines.

2436
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:16,930
so I can see the mines at ease.

2437
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:22,010
It's not my fault there.

2438
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:26,370
Oh, this is easy.

2439
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:28,650
It doesn't matter if we hit the side.

2440
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:32,850
It matters for my eyesight.

2441
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:35,390
Oh, that's a lot.

2442
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:37,630

That's a lot of bugs coming in.

How do I get there?

2524
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:24,840
I'm drowning!

2525
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:26,360
At the top!

2526
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:27,100
At the top!

2527
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:27,340
At the top!

2528
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:28,240
I'm here, guys.

2529
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:29,720
I'm here.

2530
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:32,400
I did it.

2531
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:35,180
Wait, I think it's easier if we go into the storm.

2532
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:36,620
It's easier.

2533
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:39,660
No, because our boat's gonna freaking die.

2534
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:41,800
I think it might be easier.

2535
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:47,840
I think it's gonna be easier if we're in the tornado, Gubby.

2536
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:48,640
You're pissing me off.

2537
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:50,880
I think it's gonna be easier.

2538
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:53,120
Oh, crashing us!

2539
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:55,460
We did lose HP!

2540
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:57,420
We did it in front of you in front of you.

2541
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:58,680
My front, my front, my front.

2542
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:01,700
Look, see, we made it through.

2543
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:03,260
We made it through.

2544
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:04,540
Don't crash into that wall.

2545
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:06,500
We made it through.

2546
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:12,700
I mean, we don't have to have a wall if somebody hits the
target.

2547
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:17,720
Well, I have to be close enough to get the target.

2548
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:20,120
Yeah, we did it.

2549
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:24,720
I, like, ripped onto my controller so fucking tightly.

2550
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:27,040
That my hand hurt.

2551
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,520
Bro, you gotta relax, Goomy.

2552
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:32,040
You gotta relax.

2553
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:34,460
Hey, jellyfish.

2554
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:36,740
Poke it.

2555
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:37,920
Let's go.

2556
02:05:39,380 --> 02:05:40,660
Poke the jellyfish.

2557
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:44,340
Okay.

2558
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:44,980
I poked it.

2559
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:47,780
You sure did.

2560
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:53,740
For some reason, I thought it was that, like, Nemo DS game
from the early 2000s.

2561
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:54,460
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2562
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:55,540
And then you could jump on the jellyfish.

2563
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:56,580
You remember when you jump on jellyfish?

2564
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:57,000
Yeah.

2565
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2566
02:05:58,740 --> 02:05:58,860
Yeah.

2567
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:00,880
And then there was some mini-games in the shark tank.

2568
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:05,440
Dude, I actually own that.

2569
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:06,040
Yeah.

2570
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:07,420
The good ones.

2571
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:09,340
Not before they started, like...

2572
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:10,220
Oh, that's a wall.

2573
02:06:10,420 --> 02:06:10,620
Okay.

2574
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:13,000
Not before they... It's, like, cash out.

2575
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:15,200
They used to make actual good...

2576
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:16,940
Actual good movie games.

2577
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:19,740
What does that do?

2578
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:33,560

2581
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,000
Will we be able to just go forward?

2582
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,820
Maybe speedrunners do that shit.

2583
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:00,680
Oh, hey, look, they drew them!

2584
02:07:00,820 --> 02:07:01,300
It's like...

2585
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:01,900
Aw, cute.

2586
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,420
It's like caveman squirrels.

2587
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,020
Wait, there's big evil squirrels.

2588
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:08,260
Oh, my God.

2589
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:08,980
There it is.

2590
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:09,860
There's a dead squirrel.

2591
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:11,260
Holy shit.

2592
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,820
That's a giant, big squirrel.

2593
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:15,180
And then...

2594
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:16,080
Oh, that's us!

2595
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:17,840
I think they think we're good people.

2596
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:19,720
I don't think so.

2597
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:20,820
Look how angry you are.

2598
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,220
she looks.

2599
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:23,000
Wait.

2600
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:25,120
Is that us?

2601
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:26,100
Yeah, look, there's us.

2602
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:27,660
That's me.

2603
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:29,440
You can tell from my big geek.

2604
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:30,340
Whoa.

2605
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:31,800
What?

2606
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:33,160
Whoa.

2607
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:33,840
Whoa.

2608
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:34,520
Wait, look.

2609
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:36,180
Someone did not like that.

2610
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:37,580
They love toilet paper.

2611
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:38,280
They do?

2612
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:38,680
Where?

2613
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:39,760
Oh, they do.

2614
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,120
They love toilet paper.

2615
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,440
Yeah.

2616
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:45,940
They love toilet paper.

2617
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:47,560
And, like, all our other stuff.

2618
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:48,740
I'm stealing from my stuff.

2619
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:49,320
Yeah.

2620
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:50,460
They love to steal.

2621
02:07:50,520 --> 02:08:04,360
So why are we helping them again um so we can get home or
something toilet one of these oh can you light it no i think

2622
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:05,420

02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:28,790
Oh, oh, I couldn't make it!

2625
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:30,990
You have to, like, shoot yourself at it.

2626
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:33,050
Yeah.

2627
02:08:34,570 --> 02:08:35,050
Nice.

2628
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:37,030
I can aim.

2629
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:38,310
Wait, I overshot it.

2630
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:40,370
You have to hit that one.

2631
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:41,530
I did.

2632
02:08:42,690 --> 02:08:44,270
Yay, because I'm a gamer.

2633
02:08:45,330 --> 02:08:45,550
Huh?

2634
02:08:47,010 --> 02:08:48,290
Where's the next one, though?

2635
02:08:48,990 --> 02:08:49,970
Oh, it's over here.

2636
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:51,210
The next one flies.

2637
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:56,280
Where does this take me?

2638
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:57,900
Oh, I have to go in the hole.

2639
02:08:58,460 --> 02:08:59,020
Go in the hole.

2640
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:00,380
See, I didn't miss the hole.

2641
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:01,080
I'm literally right behind you.

2642
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:02,600
I'm literally right behind you.

2643
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:03,180
I didn't even miss the hole.

2644
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:04,520
Are you not proud of me?

2645
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:05,860
Oh, my God, there's a fish.

2646
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:07,400
The hole is pretty darn big, I'll be honest.

2647
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:08,320
It's the sea turtle.

2648
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:09,300
What the?

2649
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:10,480
That's not a turtle.

2650
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:11,720
It's like the sea turtle.

2651
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:12,980
It's like crash.

2652
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:15,440
Oh!

2653
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:16,800
It's like crash.

2654
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:19,620
No, it's like the stingray.

2655
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:21,260
Oh.

2656
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:25,000
It's like the stingray that takes them to school.

2657
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:30,420
Well, well, catfish aren't dangerous.

2658
02:09:30,580 --> 02:09:32,140
He's big enough to eat us.

2659
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:33,400
No, aren't catfish?

2660
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:35,320
Don't catfish, like, eat everything?

2661
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:36,540
Yeah, they do.

2662
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:37,320
Their bottom eaters.

2663
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:39,740
And they have taste buds all around their body.

2664
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:42,220
Wait, so, like, they're tasting my feet right now?

2665
02:09:42,660 --> 02:09:43,520
Yeah, it is.

2666
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,320
This is why we're getting divorced.

2667
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:49,320
What?

2668
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,360
I should show it to you.

2669
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:57,420
That was my breaking...

2670
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:59,340
That is my lie.

2671
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,160
That was the last straw.

2672
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:02,880
That was the last straw.

2673
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:09,280
Oh, it's like on its back now.

2674
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:10,640
Wait, did you die?

2675
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:11,020
Oh.

2676
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:13,180
It did a flip.

2677
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:17,500
Oh my god, look, it's showing us all these cool tricks that
he can do.

2678
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:18,940
Wait, look!

2679
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:20,100
There's more!

2680
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:21,620
There is more!

2681
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:22,640
Do I have to jump on them?

2682
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:25,340
No, I think it's just decoration.

2683
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:29,420
I wish this was cool and all, but like, stop making me move
on this.

2684
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:30,620
This could have been a cutscene.

2685
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:36,880
Oh my god, he's dead.

2686
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:40,600
Fuck you, Cody!

2687
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:42,340
Why are you blaming on me?

2688
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:44,540
What did I do?

2689
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:51,940
When I- when we get divorced, you can't blame anything on me
anymore.

2690
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:53,820
You have to blame it on yourself.

2691
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:55,180
Yeah, that's the point of our divorce, man.

2692
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:00,080
Oh, to finally take responsibility.

2693
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:02,880
Oh, my God, I'm calling him.

2694
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:08,000
Oh, jump and fall like this in your real body.

2695
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:10,480
Oh, are you calling me fat?

2696
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,460
Oh, so enjoy it while it lasts.

2697
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,260
Oh, my God, man.

2698
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:16,940
I let myself go because of you.

2699
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:19,600
Because of me?

2700
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:28,020
Hey, Cody, that looks like a shooting range.

2701
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:29,040
Wait, where?

2702
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:30,500
Oh, a shooting range.

2703
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:31,380
Wait, what?

2704
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:33,180
What are you going to do?

2705
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:36,720
Oh, it's over on the other side.

2706
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:41,280
I'm just big-boned, okay?

2707
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:43,200
This is a dad bod right here.

2708
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:44,840
People love dad bods.

2709
02:11:46,180 --> 02:11:46,700
Okay.

2710
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:49,820
Aren't charged.

2711
02:11:57,840 --> 02:11:58,240
Wait, what?

2712
02:11:58,480 --> 02:11:58,960
Oh!

2713
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:00,360
Oh!

2714
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,220
Oh, I see.

2715
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:08,860
Bro, the aim is so weird, though, for this.

2716
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:14,540
Oh, it's the right stick.

2717
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:17,360
Yeah, no.

2718
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:18,700
I kind of don't like this.

2719
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:19,800
Me too.

2720
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:21,000
Oh, no.

2721
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:23,200
What do you mean there's, like, bullet falloff?

2722
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:24,760
What the fuck?

2723
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:26,660
What the fuck?

2724
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:27,560
I don't like this.

2725
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:30,180
I don't like this.

2726
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:34,900
Oh my god.

2727
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:37,000
Aiming with this is so hard.

2728
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:40,160
It's so difficult to aim with this.

2729
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,460
I think I'm giving up.

2730
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:46,540
Yeah!

2731
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:47,400
FPS!

2732
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:52,840
This is it.

2733
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:54,920
Gamer of the Year.

2734
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:56,640
Gamer of the Year right here.

2735
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:57,440
You're a controller player?

2736
02:12:57,620 --> 02:12:58,380
You're a controller player?

2737
02:12:58,560 --> 02:12:58,960
Is that it?

2738
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:01,400
No, it doesn't matter what input I use.

2739
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:02,040
I'm just good at it.

2740
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:02,900
I'm naturally gifted.

2741
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:11,060
I'm gonna put you on the left side now on my screen

2742
02:13:14,140 --> 02:13:23,880
doesn't matter I'm just naturally talented yeah explain the
Mario party that's not that doesn't require aim that doesn't

2743
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:32,880
require aim that's why explain the hammer game we have to
cross over there we have to cross over

2744
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,920
It's okay we don't die.

2745
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:40,940
Why are you afraid of?

2746
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:41,660
Oh god.

2747
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:43,180
We don't even die.

2748
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:49,640
And where are we supposed to get here?

2749
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:50,580
Oh okay.

2750
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:54,100
How did I get here before you?

2751
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:55,880
I was looking around.

2752
02:13:55,940 --> 02:13:56,420
Where are we going?

2753
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,140
Only one way out.

2754
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:01,100
Oh, look out.

2755
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:01,440
These are here.

2756
02:14:02,540 --> 02:14:02,800
Oh.

2757
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:03,580
Oh.

2758
02:14:04,040 --> 02:14:04,200
Oh.

2759
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:04,860
Okay.

2760
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:06,880
I figured it out.

2761
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:10,800
So, like, we have to avoid the bees on the wood clasp when
we didn't know.

2762
02:14:11,320 --> 02:14:11,760
Yeah.

2763
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:16,040
I think I figured that out a bit earlier, I'll be honest.

2764
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:22,020
You get sort of time where they're...

2765
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:23,760
See where they're gonna be arriving.

2766
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:26,140
Yeah.

2767
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:28,480
Oh.

2768
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:30,860
Bro, this game is for babies.

2769
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:31,840
Look at this.

2770
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:34,560
This is a baby game.

2771
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:35,480
We're so good.

2772
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:38,820
I don't think it's a baby game since they're talking about
divorce.

2773
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:41,560
No, babies need to learn early on.

2774
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:43,640
We can't shelter these babies.

2775
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:45,440
You know, you're right.

2776
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:47,840
Yeah, babies don't need to be sheltered.

2777
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:52,080
Oh, poop time.

2778
02:14:52,180 --> 02:14:52,760
Poop time.

2779
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:55,600
Poop time.

2780
02:14:57,920 --> 02:14:58,500
There you go.

2781
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:01,380
Nothing spawns behind us, right?

2782
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:02,860
No, we're fine, we're fine, yeah.

2783
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:05,880
They just, they only spawn in front of us because they're
not that good.

He's so cute.

2790
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:45,360
What is he gonna do to us?

2791
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:46,620
He's so cute, though.

2792
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:48,640
Okay, I'm gooping.

2793

Oh, shit.

Oh, he's doing a double jump.

2814
02:16:59,370 --> 02:17:00,330
He's doing a triple jump.

2815
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:01,430
Oh, baby, a triple.

2816
02:17:04,430 --> 02:17:06,130

Yeah, it's fine.

2835
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:31,760
We can wait for him to walk.

2836
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:32,260
He's charging.

2837
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:32,720
He wants to charge.

2838
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:33,180
He wants to charge.

2839
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:33,200
He wants to charge.

2840
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:33,500
You ready?

2841
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:35,060

We did it!

2843
02:17:36,980 --> 02:17:37,300
Nice.

2844
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:38,560
We're gaming.

2845
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:40,800
Oh.

2846
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:46,540
Oh!

2847
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:48,100
I'm just a beetle!

2848
02:17:48,980 --> 02:17:49,780
I'm just a beetle!

2849
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,580
He sounds like Seth Rogan.

2850
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:53,500
I'm a mercenary.

2851
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:55,200
I'm a friend of mine.

2852
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,160
What food?

2853
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:57,900
Huh?

2854
02:17:58,820 --> 02:17:59,440
Worms?

2855
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:00,060
Slugs?

2856
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:01,020
Larvae?

2857
02:18:01,220 --> 02:18:01,540
No!

2858
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:03,120
I'm a vegetarian.

2859
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:04,640
And gluten-free.

2860
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:05,420
Oh!

2861
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:06,080
Oh.

2862
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:07,320
Okay.

2863
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:09,060
Well, uh...

2864
02:18:09,060 --> 02:18:09,760
You know the queen?

2865
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:11,760
She has all the nectar.

2866
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:12,180
Huh?

2867
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:16,120
So if you help us take her down, you can have as much as you
can.

2868
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:18,860
Shake my head, not loyal.

2869
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:20,140
Gaslighter, gaslighter.

2870
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:24,880
Oh,

2871
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:30,440
we got a ride now!

2872
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:33,540
Shake my head, not loyal though.

2873
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,820
Wait, how do we... Oh, you shoot!

2874
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:36,500
You're the aimer!

2875
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:37,280
You're the aimer!

2876
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:39,860
You have to shoot!

2877
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:42,900
You have to shoot too!

2878
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:44,040
No, I move!

2879
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:45,840
I move and jump, you shoot!

2880
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:48,560
I move and jump, you shoot!

2881
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:49,740

Just remember to shoot.

2886
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:05,520
You know what's crazy is that you were moving the exact same
way I was moving.

2887
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,560
Wait, really?

2888
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:09,020
So I was like, wait, I thought I'm moving.

2889
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:12,920
Someone wasn't reading.

2890
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:28,700
I Someone wasn't reading This does not have to do with
reading It just It's called Reflexes You see I jumped

2891
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:44,020
You could have shot that No I couldn't have You jumped into
the barrels You could have shot that into the barrels.

2892
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:45,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

2893
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:46,980
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2894
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:49,340
It's shooting time.

2895
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:53,100
All right, nice.

2896
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:54,680
And then I jump.

2897
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:57,100
Look at me go.

2898
02:19:57,360 --> 02:19:58,080
I'm a good driver.

2899
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:01,100
I have a driver's license.

2900
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:04,460
I have a dry shoot.

2901
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:06,740

2902
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:07,480
Yay!

2903
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:13,920
Wait, would it matter?

2904
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:15,260
Would it just fall on us?

2905
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:16,360
Maybe.

2906
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:17,500
Like a bomb?

2907
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:19,520
Let me go.

2908
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:21,340
That's when you know I'm a good driver.

2909
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:27,340
What did you do?

2910
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:28,120
You crushed!

2911
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:31,040
You didn't shoot!

2912
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:32,100

Nailed it.

2916
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,600
Wait, he could have flew all along.

2917
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:51,960
He could have just flown all along for us.

2918
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:58,040
I think he regrets working for us.

2919
02:20:58,480 --> 02:20:59,580
What the fuck?

2920
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:00,700

2921
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:07,820

Damn, that's crazy.

2930
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:25,560
If Mario can do it and have a billion dollar company, we can
too.

2931
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:38,380
There's a squirrel in there.

There's a cooldown.

3123
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:22,850
I can't just pump whenever you tell me to pump.

3124
02:34:24,090 --> 02:34:25,810
Well, you're gonna have to pump it here.

Why they're shooting?

3131
02:34:56,930 --> 02:35:01,470
Yeah, but if you killed them before this I wouldn't get
shot.

3132
02:35:01,470 --> 02:35:03,330
That's why I'm swapping to the mouse and keyboard.

3133
02:35:06,210 --> 02:35:07,270
It's worse!

3134
02:35:07,370 --> 02:35:08,550
It's worse somehow!

3135
02:35:10,170 --> 02:35:11,830
The DPI is so low!

3136
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:14,050
That fucking changes DPI!

3137
02:35:16,450 --> 02:35:18,390

Don't worry, don't worry.

3139
02:35:22,430 --> 02:35:26,790
Because the talented controller input can do this.

02:50:50,850 --> 02:50:52,770
Wait, what do I do as a big boy?

3371
02:50:56,490 --> 02:50:56,970

3379
02:51:16,450 --> 02:51:17,290
I figured it out!

3380
02:51:18,910 --> 02:51:20,470
I go smart.

3381
02:51:22,230 --> 02:51:25,090
And then I do this.

3382
02:51:27,170 --> 02:51:28,650
Wait, do I do this in?

3383
02:51:28,890 --> 02:51:29,310

I was watching your screen.

3390
02:51:45,370 --> 02:51:46,310
That's fucked up.

3391
02:51:47,250 --> 02:51:48,430
We're supposed to be a team.

3392
02:51:49,250 --> 02:51:51,370
There's a control room at the very top.

3393
02:51:51,930 --> 02:51:54,390
If we can get up there, I think we can make it out of here.

3394
02:51:55,410 --> 02:51:56,110
What's this?

3395
02:51:57,570 --> 02:51:57,930
Oh.

3396
02:51:59,970 --> 02:52:00,650
What's this?

3397
02:52:01,850 --> 02:52:02,670
Oh, there's no battery.

3398
02:52:03,210 --> 02:52:03,350
You have to go in there.

3399
02:52:03,430 --> 02:52:04,090
You have to go in there.

3400
02:52:04,510 --> 02:52:05,590
Oh, okay.

3401
02:52:06,490 --> 02:52:08,070
See, this is why we're a team.

3402
02:52:08,210 --> 02:52:09,290
You're in my context, Blues.

3403
02:52:11,270 --> 02:52:12,570
Okay, I'm pushing it in.

3404
02:52:14,070 --> 02:52:14,470
It's on.

3405
02:52:18,170 --> 02:52:21,510
You know, I think sometimes I just stop and I just watch.

3406
02:52:23,050 --> 02:52:24,630
Because of how smart I am, right?

3407
02:52:25,050 --> 02:52:27,170
I just want to see how your mind works.

3408
02:52:27,670 --> 02:52:30,410
Yeah, because it's like, it's like a genius.

3409
02:52:32,630 --> 02:52:32,850
Eh.

3410
02:52:34,890 --> 02:52:35,930
I'm a genius.

3411
02:52:36,970 --> 02:52:39,730
You're just like so impressed with how this mind works.

3412
02:52:42,350 --> 02:52:43,710
What the fuck?

3413
02:52:43,810 --> 02:52:44,770
What the fuck is this?

3414
02:52:46,130 --> 02:52:47,550
Wait, I'm in somewhere else.

3415
02:52:50,150 --> 02:52:52,110
Oh no, I'm with you.

3416
02:52:53,270 --> 02:52:54,510
Oh, it's another game.

3417
02:52:55,410 --> 02:52:56,370
This is another game.

3418
02:52:56,910 --> 02:52:57,510
Spacewalk.

3419
02:52:59,170 --> 02:52:59,770
Okay.

3420
02:53:00,730 --> 02:53:02,050
Oh, we play this.

3421
02:53:03,030 --> 02:53:04,170
Land on platform.

3422
02:53:04,530 --> 02:53:06,750
Oh, it's like that crab game.

3423
02:53:07,010 --> 02:53:08,010
This one's gonna be mine.

3424
02:53:09,190 --> 02:53:11,010
Boxes have always been mine.

3425
02:53:11,910 --> 02:53:12,970
this is platform.

3426
02:53:16,490 --> 02:53:17,210
What the fuck?

3427
02:53:18,110 --> 02:53:18,870
This...

3428
02:53:18,870 --> 02:53:20,470
It's so slow.

3429
02:53:21,950 --> 02:53:22,290
Okay.

3430
02:53:25,250 --> 02:53:25,630
Okay.

3431
02:53:29,990 --> 02:53:31,490
Oh, oh, no.

3432
02:53:31,750 --> 02:53:33,450
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3433
02:53:34,670 --> 02:53:35,870
Come on.

3434
02:53:36,310 --> 02:53:37,410
Give me more.

3435
02:53:38,370 --> 02:53:38,670
No!

3436
02:53:39,450 --> 02:53:40,210
No!

3437
02:53:40,210 --> 02:53:40,810
No!

3438
02:53:42,450 --> 02:53:43,950
Oh, he fell!

3439
02:53:46,350 --> 02:53:46,970
Yes!

3440
02:53:48,150 --> 02:53:48,710
Mine!

3441
02:53:50,250 --> 02:53:52,170
Wait, that's fucked up.

3442
02:53:53,830 --> 02:53:54,670
That's fucked up.

3443
02:53:54,950 --> 02:53:55,610
That's fucked up.

3444
02:53:56,370 --> 02:53:57,270
That's fucked up.

3445
02:53:57,410 --> 02:53:58,490
I can do that too.

3446
02:54:03,470 --> 02:54:05,550
I took you guys!

3447
02:54:05,810 --> 02:54:06,830
I took you guys!

3448
02:54:07,350 --> 02:54:08,370
Another boyfriend!

3449
02:54:08,970 --> 02:54:10,410
Dude, I didn't realize I could take you until later.

3450
02:54:13,390 --> 02:54:16,690
Another Point for joking.

3451
02:54:17,850 --> 02:54:18,150
Yeah.

3452
02:54:20,230 --> 02:54:20,810
I'm going.

3453
02:54:20,850 --> 02:54:21,450
What the fuck was that?

3454
02:54:22,090 --> 02:54:22,130
Yeah.

3455
02:54:23,750 --> 02:54:25,550
It's called being a winning.

3456
02:54:29,430 --> 02:54:30,730
What is this?

3457
02:54:32,050 --> 02:54:34,310
I think I started like a supernova.

3458
02:54:35,390 --> 02:54:38,330
What the fuck?

3459
02:54:38,610 --> 02:54:40,710
Can we like shoot the stars into this?

3460
02:54:41,690 --> 02:54:43,850
Um, I didn't mean to go into the...

3461
02:54:44,790 --> 02:54:46,330
There's the world.

3462
02:54:46,870 --> 02:54:47,850
Oh, there is, yeah.

3463
02:54:48,790 --> 02:54:50,450
Alright, purple world.

3464
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:53,650
I'm not sure this is a good idea!

3465
02:54:54,270 --> 02:54:55,610
What's this?

3466
02:54:56,330 --> 02:54:57,230
Oh my god.

3467
02:54:57,910 --> 02:55:00,070
Now that was one hell of a ride.

3468
02:55:01,910 --> 02:55:02,890
Can I step on it too?

3469
02:55:03,730 --> 02:55:06,830
Oh, we can't- Oh, it's like the monkey ball game.

3470
02:55:08,690 --> 02:55:09,770
Monkey ball?

3471
02:55:10,590 --> 02:55:11,010
Yeah.

3472
02:55:12,550 --> 02:55:14,190
Oh, I- You have to push it.

3473
02:55:14,530 --> 02:55:16,530
Wait, how do I push it?

3474
02:55:18,250 --> 02:55:19,750
Why don't you try becoming big first?

3475
02:55:20,390 --> 02:55:22,110
Big, big time.

3476
02:55:22,370 --> 02:55:23,870
Okay, I'm pushing.

3477
02:55:24,110 --> 02:55:24,610
Yeah, it is!

3478
02:55:24,690 --> 02:55:25,410
It's like that stupid!

3479
02:55:25,770 --> 02:55:27,290
The monkey ball!

3480
02:55:28,070 --> 02:55:29,850
Bro, I push so fucking slow.

3481
02:55:31,450 --> 02:55:31,830
B.

3482
02:55:35,090 --> 02:55:35,730
B.

3483
02:55:37,750 --> 02:55:39,490
Okay, don't worry.

3484
02:55:39,670 --> 02:55:40,150
I push.

3485
02:55:42,610 --> 02:55:43,610
I'm pushing.

3486
02:55:43,950 --> 02:55:44,030
Oh!

3487
02:55:45,770 --> 02:55:48,090
Jesus Christ, I wish I'd go faster.

3488
02:55:48,270 --> 02:55:50,110
I'm so slow, though.

3489
02:55:51,590 --> 02:55:52,630
Can I actually go faster?

3490
02:55:52,850 --> 02:55:53,350
I can't.

3491
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:56,150
Even if you dash?

3492
02:55:56,330 --> 02:55:56,550
No.

3493
02:55:56,990 --> 02:55:57,770
It won't let me.

3494
02:55:58,590 --> 02:56:00,470
I have to push as low as possible.

3495
02:56:01,570 --> 02:56:02,310
Alright, here you go.

3496
02:56:07,650 --> 02:56:08,490
I'm watching.

3497
02:56:08,630 --> 02:56:09,630
I'm watching you.

3498
02:56:10,570 --> 02:56:11,390
Now what do you do?

3499
02:56:12,690 --> 02:56:13,270
Oh no.

3500
02:56:14,530 --> 02:56:14,970
I do.

3501
02:56:15,870 --> 02:56:17,070
Do I just stay here?

3502
02:56:19,550 --> 02:56:19,990
Oh!

3503
02:56:20,430 --> 02:56:20,870

3504
02:56:21,010 --> 02:56:21,410
I small.

3505
02:56:24,330 --> 02:56:25,530
Oh, you crushed me.

3506
02:56:25,910 --> 02:56:25,910
Okay.

3507
02:56:27,270 --> 02:56:28,670
That's a little fucked up.

3508
02:56:28,750 --> 02:56:29,630
But that's okay.

3509
02:56:30,870 --> 02:56:33,870
I knew what I signed up for when I said I do.

3510
02:56:36,290 --> 02:56:36,650
Wait, what?

3511
02:56:37,710 --> 02:56:38,390
Okay, here.

You just don't understand.

3524
02:58:01,570 --> 02:58:03,050
Do we both need to be here?

3525
02:58:04,310 --> 02:58:06,110
Oh, it went all the way up.

3526
02:58:07,370 --> 02:58:07,690
Red?

3527
02:58:07,970 --> 02:58:08,730
Oh, it's this way.

3528
02:58:09,830 --> 02:58:11,070
But you have to jump on the planets.

3529
02:58:14,010 --> 02:58:14,810
And then...

3530
02:58:14,810 --> 02:58:15,210
Here I'll go.

3531
02:58:15,350 --> 02:58:16,650
The planet made me slide off.

3532

That was fucked up.

3533
02:58:18,670 --> 02:58:19,910
Don't worry, you'll get there eventually.

Uh, go to the drawers.

3550
02:59:15,730 --> 02:59:16,370
The drawers?

3551
02:59:16,590 --> 02:59:17,210
There's the drawers.

3552
02:59:17,630 --> 02:59:18,050
The drawers?

3553
02:59:18,050 --> 02:59:18,370
The drawers?

3554
02:59:18,850 --> 02:59:19,330
To you left?

3555
02:59:19,970 --> 02:59:20,690

02:59:21,510 --> 02:59:21,970
Oh, I see.

3557
02:59:22,050 --> 02:59:22,390
I see.

3558
02:59:22,570 --> 02:59:23,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3559
02:59:23,510 --> 02:59:24,290
I'm in.

3560
02:59:25,350 --> 02:59:26,030
Got it.

3561
02:59:29,330 --> 02:59:30,390
I fucked up.

3562
02:59:30,490 --> 02:59:30,910
I fucked up.

3563
02:59:31,090 --> 02:59:31,490
I fucked up.

3564
02:59:31,530 --> 02:59:32,070
I fucked up.

3565
02:59:32,130 --> 02:59:32,790
I fucked up.

3566
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:33,830
You gotta restart.

3567
02:59:34,010 --> 02:59:34,950
You gotta restart.

3568
02:59:35,290 --> 02:59:36,390
I fucked up.

3569
02:59:38,410 --> 02:59:40,750
Yeah, sometimes husbands make mistakes.

3570
02:59:41,610 --> 02:59:42,430
You can't be perfect.

3571
02:59:44,230 --> 02:59:45,550
Because being perfect is very...

3572
02:59:45,550 --> 02:59:46,170
More often than not.

3573
02:59:46,710 --> 02:59:49,970
Being perfect makes a relationship very toxic.

3574
02:59:51,310 --> 02:59:54,590
You gotta be able to make mistakes to show that you're
human.

3575
02:59:54,850 --> 02:59:54,990

3753
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:04,440
After all you put me through today, it's well deserved.

3754
03:10:04,640 --> 03:10:05,240
What do you mean?

3755
03:10:05,300 --> 03:10:06,720
This is a team game!

3756
03:10:06,940 --> 03:10:08,160
We don't progress!

3757
03:10:08,440 --> 03:10:09,860
You don't do it!

3758
03:10:10,660 --> 03:10:11,900
I'm having fun!

3759
03:10:14,100 --> 03:10:14,740

3760
03:10:19,480 --> 03:10:26,500
Don't worry direct our needle imagine you miss that would be

3761
03:10:26,820 --> 03:10:28,620

3762
03:10:32,480 --> 03:10:34,740

3764
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:45,320

3765
03:10:45,860 --> 03:10:47,360
You need to stop hip-thrusting, man.

3766
03:10:47,620 --> 03:10:48,620
I can't stop.

3767
03:10:49,560 --> 03:10:50,300
I can never stop.

3768
03:10:50,300 --> 03:10:51,600
Why don't we have a second child yet?

3769
03:10:53,700 --> 03:10:54,480
That's on you.

3770
03:10:54,620 --> 03:10:55,520
What the fuck does that do?

3771
03:10:55,680 --> 03:10:56,300
I don't know.

3772
03:10:56,560 --> 03:10:57,060
What is this lady?

3773
03:10:57,060 --> 03:10:57,900
Oh, what the hell?

3774
03:11:02,220 --> 03:11:08,300
Oh, there it is.

3775
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:09,720
There it is.

3776
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:10,520
It's over there.

3777
03:11:10,780 --> 03:11:11,400
Oh, you need to turn it off.

3778
03:11:11,460 --> 03:11:12,660
You need to turn it off!

3779
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:13,600
Oh.

3780
03:11:16,900 --> 03:11:19,980
How was I supposed to know that I died?

3781
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:21,660
I died.

3782
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:26,440
You need to turn something on, clearly.

3783
03:11:28,920 --> 03:11:29,900
Do I do this?

3784
03:11:30,460 --> 03:11:30,800
Yeah.

3785
03:11:32,320 --> 03:11:34,000
Then I can do this.

3786
03:11:34,640 --> 03:11:35,100
Oh, oh.

3787
03:11:35,300 --> 03:11:36,060
I fucking, okay.

3788
03:11:36,860 --> 03:11:39,220
I feel you wanted to turn that.

3789
03:11:39,420 --> 03:11:39,780
I thought about it.

3790
03:11:39,880 --> 03:11:40,800
I thought about it.

3791
03:11:40,820 --> 03:11:41,620
I could see you.

3792
03:11:41,640 --> 03:11:43,100
I could see you're a brainer.

3793
03:11:43,120 --> 03:11:45,520
and thinking about it there.

3794
03:11:48,460 --> 03:11:50,480
Okay, I'm pressing it in now.

3795
03:11:51,960 --> 03:11:52,320
It's in.

3796
03:11:53,060 --> 03:11:53,460
It's in.

3797
03:11:54,580 --> 03:11:55,720
I don't know if you noticed.

3798
03:11:57,980 --> 03:11:58,540
Hold on, what?

3799
03:11:58,660 --> 03:11:59,020
It's in?

3800
03:11:59,780 --> 03:12:00,800
Is it in yet?

3801
03:12:04,060 --> 03:12:05,140
I've said that before.

3802
03:12:05,580 --> 03:12:05,980
Whoa!

3803
03:12:12,400 --> 03:12:14,720
We were making our first child.

3804
03:12:16,700 --> 03:12:19,240
And that is why we only have one kid.

3805
03:12:20,460 --> 03:12:21,840
Wait, which color did you go into?

3806
03:12:22,780 --> 03:12:25,440
I went to the one on the left of what we just finished.

3807
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:26,820
Which color is this orange?

3808
03:12:27,020 --> 03:12:27,580
Oh, it's orange.

3809
03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:29,400
I was looking at your screen and not mine.

3810
03:12:31,540 --> 03:12:31,940
Cool.

3811
03:12:33,420 --> 03:12:34,920
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

3812
03:12:36,640 --> 03:12:37,860
All right, heal you.

3813
03:12:38,940 --> 03:12:40,720
You can't find me.

3814
03:12:41,320 --> 03:12:42,060
Where do I go?

3815
03:12:44,340 --> 03:12:45,920
I go up here?

3816
03:12:47,120 --> 03:12:48,460
No, you're supposed to go straight forward.

3817
03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:49,660
I'm here.

3818
03:12:49,900 --> 03:12:50,640
Don't worry.

3819
03:12:51,800 --> 03:12:53,020
The husband is here.

3820
03:12:53,100 --> 03:12:54,180
Oh, I can hip-thresh this.

3821
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:55,340
Watch this.

3822
03:12:55,920 --> 03:12:56,100
Ugh.

3823
03:12:57,300 --> 03:12:59,300
I have a lot of pent-up aggression right now.

3824
03:12:59,740 --> 03:13:01,480
That's not...

3825
03:13:07,020 --> 03:13:08,940
No, I'm 10!

3826
03:13:10,200 --> 03:13:11,120
I'm 10!

3827
03:13:11,720 --> 03:13:13,340
Don't worry, I'm coming back!

3828
03:13:16,740 --> 03:13:18,360
There you go.

3829
03:13:19,440 --> 03:13:20,360
You wanna watch this?

3830
03:13:20,680 --> 03:13:22,840
Look at me go, I'm a beautiful butterfly.

3831
03:13:24,300 --> 03:13:24,400
Bump.

3832
03:13:25,820 --> 03:13:26,120
Bump.

3833
03:13:26,980 --> 03:13:28,200
That was- I was watching.

3834
03:13:28,360 --> 03:13:29,320
That was that beautiful.

3835
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:31,960
Go big.

3836
03:13:32,560 --> 03:13:32,920
Ugh.

3837
03:13:35,140 --> 03:13:36,380
There you go.

3838
03:13:36,480 --> 03:13:37,760
Ew, the noise he made.

3839
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:39,920
What the fuck do you mean?

3840
03:13:40,700 --> 03:13:44,100
He went, I went big.

3841
03:13:45,220 --> 03:13:46,560
How do I get over to you?

3842
03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:47,900
Uh, go big again, I think.

3843
03:13:51,140 --> 03:13:53,120
Alright, I'm checking, I'm big.

3844
03:13:53,980 --> 03:13:54,900
Can you jump on?

3845
03:13:55,660 --> 03:13:56,500
Jump where?

3846
03:13:57,400 --> 03:13:58,320
I can't jump anywhere.

3847
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:00,260
Can I?

3848
03:14:00,360 --> 03:14:01,320
Because I lower it.

3849
03:14:01,860 --> 03:14:02,820
I don't think I can.

3850
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:04,900
Oh, go tiny, go tiny, real quick!

3851
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:08,040
Yeah?

3852
03:14:08,360 --> 03:14:08,640
No.

3853
03:14:10,980 --> 03:14:11,980
Wait, you go...

3854
03:14:11,980 --> 03:14:12,660
Wait, hold on.

3855
03:14:12,920 --> 03:14:14,560
Go on the other side.

3856
03:14:14,820 --> 03:14:15,340
Other side?

3857
03:14:15,940 --> 03:14:16,280
Okay.

3858
03:14:16,640 --> 03:14:18,060
Yeah, and then I jump down.

3859
03:14:19,840 --> 03:14:20,240
Oh!

3860
03:14:20,820 --> 03:14:21,900
And then you go big.

3861
03:14:22,300 --> 03:14:23,600
Go big, yeah.

3862
03:14:24,100 --> 03:14:24,520
Uh-huh.

3863
03:14:25,140 --> 03:14:26,140
And then I go small.

3864
03:14:26,960 --> 03:14:28,040
I go mega small.

3865
03:14:30,760 --> 03:14:32,180
Oh my god, we're doing it.

3866
03:14:32,260 --> 03:14:32,960
We're using our...

3867
03:14:32,960 --> 03:14:34,880
We're putting our two brains together.

3868
03:14:35,140 --> 03:14:36,880
To make one full brain.

3869
03:14:38,140 --> 03:14:40,760
Um, I would say...

3870
03:14:40,760 --> 03:14:42,500
I have about 75%.

3871
03:14:42,500 --> 03:14:43,400
What?

3872
03:14:44,180 --> 03:14:47,060
What happened to the other percent of that brain then?

3873
03:14:47,580 --> 03:14:49,160
You're at a 25%?

3874
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:53,380
Okay, nice.

3875
03:14:54,440 --> 03:14:54,760

03:14:56,340 --> 03:14:56,980
Whoops.

03:14:57,280 --> 03:14:58,340

3878
03:14:59,200 --> 03:15:01,140

What's this?

3895
03:16:38,180 --> 03:16:39,700
Oh, look at the boxes, though.

3896
03:16:40,480 --> 03:16:41,660
Big time.

3897
03:16:43,560 --> 03:16:43,920
Big.

3898
03:16:45,840 --> 03:16:46,060
Oh.

3899
03:16:48,340 --> 03:16:49,180

3900
03:16:49,620 --> 03:16:52,260
Oh, wait, you have to get below.

3901
03:16:53,180 --> 03:16:54,240
On the other side?

3902
03:16:57,800 --> 03:16:59,500
Because, like, look below me.

3903
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:04,160
What do we have to do here?

3904
03:17:04,240 --> 03:17:05,700
Wait, there's something- I see it, I see it.

3905
03:17:05,780 --> 03:17:07,100
There's, like, stuff here, too.

3906
03:17:10,380 --> 03:17:11,420
It's over here.

3907
03:17:11,820 --> 03:17:14,320
Oh, do we have to grab all these little things?

3908
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:17,140
Ow!

3909
03:17:17,680 --> 03:17:18,600
Okay, I figured it out.

3910
03:17:19,780 --> 03:17:22,120
We have to grab all these tiny things.

3911
03:17:25,580 --> 03:17:26,780
I'm heading higher.

3912
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:30,660
Higher before anybody else.

3913
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:35,200
Oop, oop, oop.

3914
03:17:37,340 --> 03:17:38,260
Can I get big?

3915
03:17:40,240 --> 03:17:41,520
How do I get this out?

3916
03:17:44,900 --> 03:17:46,780
I can't get big, though.

3917
03:17:47,480 --> 03:17:50,840
What do I do from here?

3918
03:17:52,180 --> 03:17:53,000
A big time?

3919
03:17:53,220 --> 03:17:53,860
Oh, I can!

3920
03:17:55,500 --> 03:17:56,520
I'm glad.

3921
03:17:56,920 --> 03:17:58,480
Because I can't look at your screen.

3922
03:17:58,780 --> 03:17:59,380
I did it!

3923
03:17:59,440 --> 03:18:00,340
I got one!

3924
03:18:00,980 --> 03:18:01,800
I did it!

3925
03:18:02,680 --> 03:18:03,240
Nice.

3926
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:04,740
I got the second one.

3927
03:18:05,760 --> 03:18:08,960
Okay, and then...

3928
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:10,520
Do I need to put this closer?

3929
03:18:11,780 --> 03:18:12,380
There you go.

3930
03:18:12,820 --> 03:18:13,360
I got one.

3931
03:18:15,400 --> 03:18:27,020
and then the next one is yours here that's the last one i

I'm a hero, Gumi.

3946
03:20:05,590 --> 03:20:06,510
I'm a hero.

3947
03:20:11,200 --> 03:20:13,360
Obviously, we need to put this one over here.

3948
03:20:16,340 --> 03:20:17,900
Are you making them further apart?

3949
03:20:19,280 --> 03:20:19,840
Yeah.

3950
03:20:20,420 --> 03:20:21,760

03:20:25,780 --> 03:20:28,020
Okay, and then...

Here.

3953
03:20:31,020 --> 03:20:31,500
And...

3954
03:20:33,340 --> 03:20:34,920
I'm gonna put this here.

3955
03:20:39,770 --> 03:20:40,090
Do we...

3956
03:20:40,090 --> 03:20:40,970
Are we missing one?

3957
03:20:42,230 --> 03:20:43,110
No, right?

3958
03:20:46,440 --> 03:20:48,000
We got all of them, right?

3959
03:20:50,040 --> 03:20:51,520
Maybe we are missing one.

3960
03:20:54,080 --> 03:20:55,280
Oh, they said we can...

3961
03:20:55,280 --> 03:20:56,420
Oh, I know, I got an idea.

3962
03:20:56,520 --> 03:20:57,380
I got an idea.

3963
03:20:57,520 --> 03:20:57,940
I got an idea.

3964
03:20:58,800 --> 03:20:59,360
I got an idea.

3965
03:21:00,960 --> 03:21:02,200
We slant it.

3966
03:21:02,860 --> 03:21:03,560
Like here.

3967
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:05,860
I got an idea.

3968
03:21:06,020 --> 03:21:07,480
You think your reaches all the way fuck up?

3969
03:21:07,820 --> 03:21:08,860
Wait, I think we can.

3970
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:09,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3971
03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:10,500
And then we...

3972
03:21:12,400 --> 03:21:12,840
Yeah!

3973
03:21:14,220 --> 03:21:15,580
I'm so smart!

3974
03:21:16,060 --> 03:21:17,480
Look at my brain!

3975
03:21:18,420 --> 03:21:19,680
I told you!

3976
03:21:20,300 --> 03:21:22,700
This is exactly why you married me!

3977
03:21:24,560 --> 03:21:25,460
Look at that.

3978
03:21:26,520 --> 03:21:27,540
I told you.

3979
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:30,740
I told you, Gumi.

3980
03:21:31,900 --> 03:21:33,400
I can be smart too.

3981
03:21:33,940 --> 03:21:34,060
This is true.

3982
03:21:34,440 --> 03:21:35,140
It's so true.

3983
03:21:35,780 --> 03:21:36,400
Let's look at that.

3984
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:37,760
This is why I'm a catch.

3985
03:21:38,740 --> 03:21:40,780
This is exactly why I'm the catch here.

3986
03:21:41,080 --> 03:21:42,920
I'm the one that's 10 out of 10.

3987
03:21:45,980 --> 03:21:46,920
I'll press this.

3988
03:21:46,980 --> 03:21:48,140
I'll do the one here.

3989
03:21:51,380 --> 03:21:51,740
Okay.

3990
03:21:53,280 --> 03:21:54,560
I turn everything.

3991
03:21:58,600 --> 03:21:58,960
Yeah!

3992
03:22:04,000 --> 03:22:04,360
Offenses?

3993
03:22:07,540 --> 03:22:07,900
Offenses?

3994
03:22:08,640 --> 03:22:08,760
Yeah.

3995
03:22:09,380 --> 03:22:09,380
Yeah.

3996
03:22:09,520 --> 03:22:10,100
What does he mean?

3997
03:22:11,140 --> 03:22:12,500
Hold on, but I'm waiting for you.

3998
03:22:12,960 --> 03:22:13,500
Oh, wait, you already?

3999
03:22:13,560 --> 03:22:14,700
Oh, you didn't wait for me?

4000
03:22:17,840 --> 03:22:18,680
I'm here now.

4001
03:22:19,660 --> 03:22:20,180
What do we do here?

4002
03:22:20,360 --> 03:22:21,560
Wait for you for what?

4003
03:22:21,880 --> 03:22:22,260
I don't know.

4004
03:22:22,400 --> 03:22:24,220
Just to make sure I'm here.

4005
03:22:26,040 --> 03:22:27,100
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

4006
03:22:27,180 --> 03:22:28,120
We gotta swap it.

4007
03:22:29,660 --> 03:22:30,760
Oh, yeah, there we go.

4008
03:22:31,400 --> 03:22:32,800
And then we swap this.

4009
03:22:34,640 --> 03:22:35,740
Wait, how do you swap it?

4010
03:22:36,400 --> 03:22:37,420
Oh, from here!

4011
03:22:37,560 --> 03:22:38,240
Okay, give me a sec.

4012
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:39,900
Wait.

4013
03:22:40,500 --> 03:22:41,860
Wait, I can't swap this.

4014
03:22:43,220 --> 03:22:43,520
Oh!

4015
03:22:44,140 --> 03:22:44,280

4018
03:22:47,580 --> 03:22:48,580
Come here, come here.

4019
03:22:48,720 --> 03:22:49,040

03:22:49,460 --> 03:22:50,120
Go, no, no, no.

4021
03:22:50,720 --> 03:22:51,960
Go stand on the one to the left.

4022
03:22:52,160 --> 03:22:52,420
On me.

4023
03:22:53,420 --> 03:22:53,760
No.

4024
03:22:54,260 --> 03:22:54,580
Yeah.

4025
03:22:54,960 --> 03:22:55,640
I'm thinking.

4026
03:22:55,700 --> 03:22:56,700
So you're gonna lock it.

4027
03:22:56,840 --> 03:22:57,260
Yeah, yeah.

4028
03:22:58,920 --> 03:22:59,480
Yeah.

4029
03:22:59,920 --> 03:23:01,240
Oh my god!

4030
03:23:01,440 --> 03:23:02,440
We're so smart!

4031
03:23:04,540 --> 03:23:05,060
Nice!

4032
03:23:05,440 --> 03:23:06,600
I knew I could figure it out.

4033
03:23:07,020 --> 03:23:08,000
We did it!

4034
03:23:08,040 --> 03:23:08,520
Together!

4035
03:23:09,960 --> 03:23:11,900
All right, Dr. Hashim.

4036
03:23:12,440 --> 03:23:13,300
I see.

4037
03:23:13,480 --> 03:23:15,060
The current isn't making it through.

4038
03:23:15,600 --> 03:23:17,440
Can you go tiny and then wall jump up?

4039
03:23:17,640 --> 03:23:17,860
Yeah.

4040
03:23:18,600 --> 03:23:19,520
I'm doing it.

4041
03:23:19,840 --> 03:23:20,640
I'm doing it.

4042
03:23:20,900 --> 03:23:21,940
Boom, boom, boom.

4043
03:23:22,360 --> 03:23:23,780
And then I'm plugging it in.

4044
03:23:23,780 --> 03:23:24,840
It's in.

4045
03:23:30,040 --> 03:23:31,060
Overall happiness.

4046
03:23:31,540 --> 03:23:32,820
Happy, neutral, sad.

4047
03:23:33,220 --> 03:23:34,140
This guy's a freak.

4048
03:23:34,460 --> 03:23:34,880
This guy's a freak.

4049
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,640
Why is she monitoring our child?

4050
03:23:38,760 --> 03:23:42,200
Like, daily mood change.

4051
03:23:42,380 --> 03:23:43,920
She could be going through puberty.

4052
03:23:44,240 --> 03:23:45,160
You don't know that.

4053
03:23:46,260 --> 03:23:49,360
Puberty makes boys and girls do crazy things.

4054
03:23:49,720 --> 03:23:50,880
She could be a tween.

4055
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:52,440
Yeah.

4056
03:23:53,180 --> 03:23:55,080
Yeah, still super creepy.

4057
03:23:55,720 --> 03:23:56,840
Hey, what does this do?

4058
03:23:57,040 --> 03:23:57,500
I agree.

4059
03:23:57,640 --> 03:23:58,820
It's super fucking creepy.

4060
03:23:59,980 --> 03:24:01,920
The laugh tracker.

4061
03:24:03,020 --> 03:24:05,260
Dude, ours would be out of the fucking tracker.

4062
03:24:05,680 --> 03:24:06,860

03:24:09,020 --> 03:24:10,460
Yeah, okay.

She's just like us for real.

4068
03:24:21,140 --> 03:24:22,220
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

4069
03:24:22,280 --> 03:24:24,020
Yeah, he's not a licensed therapist.

4070

03:27:11,680 --> 03:27:12,260
I'm dead.

4112
03:27:13,140 --> 03:27:14,840
Don't die yet.

4113
03:27:16,920 --> 03:27:19,960
I figured out that you should not be tiny.

4114
03:27:20,480 --> 03:27:21,320
Don't be tiny.

4115
03:27:21,980 --> 03:27:23,660
Don't be tiny.

4116
03:27:24,440 --> 03:27:26,200
What the fuck?

4117
03:27:28,880 --> 03:27:30,640
Oh my gosh.

4118
03:27:30,780 --> 03:27:31,360
Don't worry.

4119
03:27:32,240 --> 03:27:32,580
Bro.

4120
03:27:32,940 --> 03:27:33,000
Don't worry.

4121
03:27:33,680 --> 03:27:35,000
How do we do this?

4122
03:27:35,360 --> 03:27:36,300
How do we do this?

4123
03:27:38,200 --> 03:27:38,920
You dodge!

4124
03:27:39,120 --> 03:27:41,500
You just dodged the fucking rocket, man!

4125
03:27:41,800 --> 03:27:43,860
I don't... Oh my god, isn't it worse?

4126
03:27:44,040 --> 03:27:45,040
You're like...

4127
03:27:45,040 --> 03:27:45,440
No!

4128
03:27:45,580 --> 03:27:46,420
What is it?

4129
03:27:50,240 --> 03:27:52,800
I... I can't... It's so hard.

4130
03:27:53,020 --> 03:27:53,740
It's so difficult.

4131
03:27:54,300 --> 03:27:55,480
I can't dodge.

4132
03:27:55,720 --> 03:27:57,800
I'm just... I'm just stupid.

4133
03:27:58,480 --> 03:27:59,020
I did!

4134
03:27:59,180 --> 03:27:59,400
I dodged!

4135
03:27:59,400 --> 03:27:59,620
I dodged!

4136
03:27:59,620 --> 03:28:02,140
Okay, you know, you ride the rocket and then you try...

4137
03:28:02,620 --> 03:28:03,100
I...

4138
03:28:09,280 --> 03:28:11,380
I'm doing my best.

4139
03:28:13,880 --> 03:28:14,300
Okay.

4140
03:28:15,020 --> 03:28:15,780
I figured it out.

4141
03:28:15,900 --> 03:28:17,180
I figured it out.

4142
03:28:17,220 --> 03:28:19,340
Look, look, look, look, look.

4143
03:28:19,480 --> 03:28:19,760
Look.

4144
03:28:25,020 --> 03:28:26,380
We did it.

4145
03:28:26,880 --> 03:28:26,960
Yay.

4146
03:28:30,780 --> 03:28:31,940
Wait, get in the ship.

4147
03:28:32,120 --> 03:28:32,620
Get in the ship.

4148
03:28:32,880 --> 03:28:33,180
Right here.

4149
03:28:33,240 --> 03:28:33,620
Go tiny.

4150
03:28:33,820 --> 03:28:34,900
Let's just get in the space.

4151
03:28:36,800 --> 03:28:37,560
I'm in.

4152
03:28:39,400 --> 03:28:40,940
What do I do?

4153
03:28:42,260 --> 03:28:43,560
Oh, no, man.

4154
03:28:44,360 --> 03:28:46,480
Oh, my God.

4155
03:28:46,660 --> 03:28:47,660
He's removing all limiters.

4156
03:28:49,420 --> 03:28:49,880
Don't worry.

4157
03:28:52,200 --> 03:28:52,960
Don't die.

4158
03:28:53,240 --> 03:28:53,640
Please don't die.

4159
03:28:53,940 --> 03:28:54,180
I thought.

4160
03:28:54,680 --> 03:28:55,160
How did you die?

4161
03:28:55,440 --> 03:28:56,100
How did you die?

4162
03:28:57,600 --> 03:28:59,120
I wasn't patient.

4163
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:00,740
I wasn't patient.

4164
03:29:01,300 --> 03:29:02,980
Is that what you want me to say?

4165
03:29:03,860 --> 03:29:04,280
Doki!

4166
03:29:05,240 --> 03:29:07,100
I have so much I have to die.

4167
03:29:07,800 --> 03:29:08,440
It's okay.

4168
03:29:08,540 --> 03:29:08,980
It's okay.

4169
03:29:09,160 --> 03:29:09,960
I'm not dying.

4170
03:29:12,660 --> 03:29:14,800
It's okay, I'm not dying this time!

4171
03:29:16,780 --> 03:29:17,240
I'm there!

4172
03:29:17,540 --> 03:29:18,820
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here!

4173
03:29:20,140 --> 03:29:20,940
What's this?

4174
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:22,260
I'm here!

4175
03:29:23,100 --> 03:29:24,420
Just keep dodging!

4176
03:29:27,820 --> 03:29:28,600
Look, I'm here!

4177
03:29:29,840 --> 03:29:31,400
I can't look!

4178
03:29:33,720 --> 03:29:34,980
I'm almost there!

4179
03:29:35,340 --> 03:29:36,220
I'm almost there!

4180
03:29:37,020 --> 03:29:37,500
Don't die!

4181
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:38,000
Don't die!

4182
03:29:42,040 --> 03:29:43,720
You're so good at that, though!

4183
03:29:43,820 --> 03:29:44,660
You're so good at that!

4184
03:29:44,680 --> 03:29:46,800
It's the whole pop-up party, did you say?

4185
03:29:48,740 --> 03:29:51,300
I thought you're really good at it.

4186
03:29:51,900 --> 03:29:52,960
I am really good.

4187
03:29:53,080 --> 03:29:54,880
That's why I've been lasting so long.

4188
03:29:55,140 --> 03:29:56,620
I've gone three times.

4189
03:29:57,100 --> 03:29:58,520
I was confused.

4190
03:29:58,800 --> 03:29:59,480
I was confused.

4191
03:29:59,840 --> 03:30:02,060
He makes broken mics on the back, Doki.

4192
03:30:03,460 --> 03:30:05,320
I was so confused.

4193
03:30:07,100 --> 03:30:07,740
Doki!

4194
03:30:08,880 --> 03:30:10,620
I'm running out of space.

4195
03:30:17,400 --> 03:30:19,460
I'm almost there.

4196
03:30:20,400 --> 03:30:21,040
Don't worry.

4197
03:30:21,420 --> 03:30:23,300
Don't worry, I'm almost there.

4198
03:30:26,840 --> 03:30:27,780
Don't worry, Gooby.

4199
03:30:27,920 --> 03:30:29,020
I'm almost there, Gooby.

4200
03:30:29,640 --> 03:30:30,640
I'm almost there.

4201
03:30:32,720 --> 03:30:34,420
You got this, Gooby.

4202
03:30:35,240 --> 03:30:36,080
You got this.

4203
03:30:36,880 --> 03:30:37,220
No!

4204
03:30:37,400 --> 03:30:40,380
Look at the sea on the fucking bucket, you fucking bitch!

4205
03:30:41,120 --> 03:30:41,720
Okay.

4206
03:30:58,380 --> 03:30:58,980
Oh,

4207
03:31:02,160 --> 03:31:03,540
yeah, what about the pinball?

4208
03:31:10,060 --> 03:31:14,140
Trust me, yes, trust me, Kumi, keep trusting me.

4209
03:31:19,540 --> 03:31:21,080
Oh, I'm the shooter.

4210
03:31:21,200 --> 03:31:21,880
I'm the shooter.

4211
03:31:25,780 --> 03:31:26,940
Where is he?

4212
03:31:26,980 --> 03:31:27,600
Where is he?

4213
03:31:28,960 --> 03:31:31,020
You're the one with the fucking GPS, dog?

4214
03:31:31,760 --> 03:31:31,820
Oh,

4215
03:31:39,870 --> 03:31:40,370
left.

4216
03:31:41,010 --> 03:31:41,450
I know.

4217
03:31:41,810 --> 03:31:42,910
I'm screen-peaking now.

4218
03:31:46,290 --> 03:31:48,690
I thought you don't believe in screen-peaking.

4219
03:31:49,190 --> 03:31:51,170
I didn't until this game happened.

4220
03:31:54,370 --> 03:31:55,590
Where is he?

4221
03:31:55,630 --> 03:31:56,250
Oh, there he is.

4222
03:31:56,670 --> 03:31:57,890
Wait, no, you missed.

4223
03:31:58,170 --> 03:31:58,890
No, I didn't.

4224
03:31:59,070 --> 03:31:59,630
Wait, what?

4225
03:32:01,510 --> 03:32:02,550
How did I die?

4226
03:32:02,590 --> 03:32:03,330
How did I miss?

4227
03:32:05,670 --> 03:32:06,150
Okay.

4228
03:32:06,890 --> 03:32:08,250
One last, one last one.

4229
03:32:10,190 --> 03:32:11,490
Oh, he's so close this time.

4230
03:32:17,240 --> 03:32:18,200
We did it.

4231
03:32:18,240 --> 03:32:19,640
We're such a good team.

4232
03:32:21,480 --> 03:32:23,540
We're such a good team.

4233
03:32:24,580 --> 03:32:25,860
How do we get back to Rose?

4234
03:32:26,620 --> 03:32:28,000
I can't let you harm her.

4235
03:32:29,080 --> 03:32:29,760
I'm a best friend.

4236
03:32:29,860 --> 03:32:31,320
Let me twist the blinds.

4237
03:32:33,740 --> 03:32:34,980
You're an asshole!

4238
03:32:35,660 --> 03:32:35,900
Whoa!

4239
03:32:37,800 --> 03:32:39,040
I'm not an asshole.

4240
03:32:39,340 --> 03:32:40,900
I just know what's good for our daughter.

4241
03:32:41,680 --> 03:32:42,540
I'm gonna close my blinds.

4242
03:32:42,620 --> 03:32:43,520
The sun's in my eye.

4243
03:32:43,820 --> 03:32:45,920
I can ask Rose to play with you again.

4244
03:32:46,620 --> 03:32:48,780
But you have to help us get back to her.

4245
03:32:52,620 --> 03:32:53,500
I'm back.

4246
03:32:53,580 --> 03:32:54,520
Is the monkey dead yet?

4247
03:32:56,060 --> 03:32:56,920
No, man.

4248
03:32:57,300 --> 03:32:58,500
You won't make her cry.

4249
03:32:59,420 --> 03:32:59,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4250
03:32:59,860 --> 03:33:00,500
We promise.

4251
03:33:00,660 --> 03:33:02,820
Of course, we will never do that again.

4252
03:33:02,840 --> 03:33:04,520
Dude, you're such a ghastlyer.

4253
03:33:05,240 --> 03:33:06,080
I like how...

4254
03:33:06,080 --> 03:33:08,300
Oh my god, so it's Deadpool Super Chat.

4255
03:33:08,480 --> 03:33:10,220
It's like, it's like Harambe off over again.

4256
03:33:10,360 --> 03:33:10,800
No!

4257
03:33:17,830 --> 03:33:19,030
There she is.

4258
03:33:19,030 --> 03:33:19,510
She's over there.

4259
03:33:20,370 --> 03:33:20,930
Rose!

4260
03:33:21,750 --> 03:33:22,310
Sweetie!

4261
03:33:23,230 --> 03:33:23,790
Darling!

4262
03:33:24,510 --> 03:33:24,830
Look!

4263
03:33:25,070 --> 03:33:26,770
This might look strange, but it's us.

4264
03:33:26,990 --> 03:33:27,970
It's mom and dad.

4265
03:33:28,370 --> 03:33:28,770
Rose!

4266
03:33:29,230 --> 03:33:30,530
We need your help.

4267
03:33:31,510 --> 03:33:32,070
Look.

4268
03:33:32,830 --> 03:33:33,810
Rose is us.

4269
03:33:34,330 --> 03:33:35,630
Oh my god, why is she writing?

4270
03:33:35,710 --> 03:33:36,430
Is she writing her?

4271
03:33:36,590 --> 03:33:37,810
I'm running away letter?

4272
03:33:39,650 --> 03:33:49,330
Oh my god, this is like inside out What the fuck you're
hitting her CPS CPS CPS

4273
03:33:54,370 --> 03:33:56,230
Wait, I can't do a British accent.

4274
03:33:56,310 --> 03:33:58,070
I'll just say by talking a British accent.

4275
03:33:58,590 --> 03:34:06,750
I can't do it Oh, I can move like items Dude, imagine she
fucking thinks she's haunted now.

4276
03:34:07,410 --> 03:34:09,330
Dude, that was shit.

4277
03:34:10,310 --> 03:34:15,670
Oh my god, we're getting closer to math.

4278
03:34:16,170 --> 03:34:19,850
We have the power to affect stuff around her.

4279
03:34:20,270 --> 03:34:22,290
She's gonna believe in ghosts now.

4280
03:34:25,250 --> 03:34:28,730
Let's destroy something Rose loves to make her proud.

4281
03:34:28,730 --> 03:34:29,070
Whoa!

4282
03:34:30,310 --> 03:34:31,070
Goomy!

4283
03:34:31,470 --> 03:34:32,930
Rose loves her elephants.

4284
03:34:33,490 --> 03:34:35,150
It's her best friend.

4285
03:34:35,230 --> 03:34:37,530
You're gonna kill the elephant.

4286
03:34:37,810 --> 03:34:39,370
We make Rose cry.

4287
03:34:39,550 --> 03:34:42,990
Hey, my bad I'll buy her a new one.

4288
03:34:43,110 --> 03:34:47,630
I promise You're a name and they I'm okay.

4289
03:34:47,770 --> 03:34:48,550
I'm an enabler.

4290
03:34:49,270 --> 03:34:58,950
Yeah I would admit I'm an enabler, but you had the idea
Enable but you had the idea first Oh

4291
03:35:07,140 --> 03:35:08,520
My nose is itching.

4292
03:35:09,060 --> 03:35:10,420
Yeah, that's the dust.

4293
03:35:10,880 --> 03:35:13,020
We must remember to clean under her bed.

4294
03:35:13,260 --> 03:35:13,680
Ah-ch-ch-ch-ch!

4295
03:35:15,460 --> 03:35:16,420
Yeah, noted.

4296
03:35:19,480 --> 03:35:20,560
Alright, here we go.

4297
03:35:22,460 --> 03:35:24,940
Oh my god, look at all her socks.

4298
03:35:25,160 --> 03:35:25,520
Yeah, exactly.

4299
03:35:26,260 --> 03:35:27,960
One less would be a good thing.

4300
03:35:28,280 --> 03:35:29,320
Wait, there's a game here!

4301
03:35:30,180 --> 03:35:30,460
Where?

4302
03:35:31,200 --> 03:35:32,740
We have to buy a replacement, right?

4303
03:35:33,020 --> 03:35:33,440
No.

4304
03:35:34,000 --> 03:35:34,960
Wait, look at this.

4305
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:37,120
Yeah, it's time.

4306
03:35:37,140 --> 03:35:40,920
Oh, it's my favorite number.

4307
03:35:41,080 --> 03:35:42,680
Eight, eight, eight, eight.

4308
03:35:43,160 --> 03:35:45,000
Lately, she's gotten attached to it again.

4309
03:35:45,220 --> 03:35:46,380
I don't know why.

4310
03:35:47,020 --> 03:35:47,500
Oh.

4311
03:35:47,900 --> 03:35:50,800
Wait, was there an Easter egg over on the left then?

4312
03:35:51,820 --> 03:35:52,700
No, no, I'll watch.

4313
03:35:53,860 --> 03:35:55,340
All right, give me a little car.

4314
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:56,200
Drive the car.

4315
03:35:56,440 --> 03:35:57,620
Oh, there is.

4316
03:35:58,580 --> 03:36:00,060
There is a little car.

4317
03:36:01,780 --> 03:36:04,820
Oh, I think I have to push you.

4318
03:36:05,200 --> 03:36:07,120
Yeah, but is there like...

4319
03:36:07,140 --> 03:36:08,220
we have to do any of this.

4320
03:36:08,260 --> 03:36:08,940
Whoa, it is!

4321
03:36:09,100 --> 03:36:10,080
There's a rodeo!

4322
03:36:10,300 --> 03:36:10,940
Wait, come back!

4323
03:36:14,520 --> 03:36:15,240
Yeah, just...

4324
03:36:15,240 --> 03:36:16,620
Oh, I have to take you back.

4325
03:36:16,900 --> 03:36:17,200
Hold it!

4326
03:36:17,300 --> 03:36:17,500
Hold it!

4327
03:36:17,500 --> 03:36:17,760
Hold it!

4328
03:36:17,900 --> 03:36:18,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming back.

4329
03:36:18,840 --> 03:36:19,300
I'm coming back.

4330
03:36:19,620 --> 03:36:22,020
Oh, the game was, like, behind us.

4331
03:36:22,900 --> 03:36:24,260
That was the main area.

4332
03:36:24,680 --> 03:36:25,540
Alright, I held eight.

4333
03:36:34,180 --> 03:36:35,260
Oh, my bad.

4334
03:36:35,360 --> 03:36:37,060
Sorry, I sneezed.

4335
03:36:38,920 --> 03:36:39,280
What?

4336
03:36:42,520 --> 03:36:43,020
There you go.

4337
03:36:43,100 --> 03:36:50,600
So you made Did you crash?

4338
03:36:50,840 --> 03:36:51,780
I'm stuck here.

4339
03:36:53,620 --> 03:36:56,000
I did it every time.

4340
03:36:56,360 --> 03:36:59,680
Every time I did it every fucking time.

4341
03:37:03,680 --> 03:37:06,180
Don't worry, I'm getting you in right now.

4342
03:37:06,400 --> 03:37:07,660
I'm getting you in.

4343
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:09,800
You're in.

4344
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:11,940
What?

4345
03:37:12,340 --> 03:37:13,820
I crashed again.

4346
03:37:14,500 --> 03:37:14,860
Huh?

4347
03:37:15,940 --> 03:37:19,800
Oh my god, I crashed again.

4348
03:37:21,120 --> 03:37:23,580
Okay, you're in again.

4349
03:37:24,120 --> 03:37:24,880
You're in again.

4350
03:37:31,250 --> 03:37:31,970
Okay, we're good.

4351
03:37:33,590 --> 03:37:34,690
We're good now.

4352
03:37:37,530 --> 03:37:38,090
I'm in.

4353
03:37:40,910 --> 03:37:41,410
Okay.

4354
03:37:47,040 --> 03:37:48,340
That means we're close.

4355
03:37:48,400 --> 03:37:49,720
Yeah, we're closer to the sea.

4356
03:37:49,940 --> 03:37:50,280
Okay.

4357
03:37:51,360 --> 03:37:53,100
Let's go to the rodeo.

4358
03:37:53,240 --> 03:37:55,200
One less would be a good thing.

4359
03:37:55,720 --> 03:37:57,260
Wait, I'm getting the car first.

4360
03:37:57,700 --> 03:37:59,780
I think the car progressed it, doesn't it?

4361
03:37:59,840 --> 03:37:59,980
Yeah.

4362
03:38:00,680 --> 03:38:02,280
Yeah, we'll just get a replacement.

4363
03:38:02,960 --> 03:38:05,040
Yeah, yeah, it like progressed it.

4364
03:38:05,100 --> 03:38:06,780
I think you should...

4365
03:38:18,130 --> 03:38:20,390
I'm ready for the rodeo.

4366
03:38:22,030 --> 03:38:23,270
I can't get out.

4367
03:38:23,430 --> 03:38:24,210
I can't get out.

4368
03:38:25,410 --> 03:38:27,170
I literally mean it.

4369
03:38:29,590 --> 03:38:32,050
What is wrong with your game?

4370
03:38:32,210 --> 03:38:33,690
What do you mean?

4371
03:38:34,450 --> 03:38:36,090
Why do you keep crashing?

4372
03:38:36,510 --> 03:38:37,890
You couldn't get out.

4373
03:38:38,030 --> 03:38:39,670
You left the session.

4374
03:38:42,250 --> 03:38:44,590
I was able to keep honking it.

4375
03:38:46,030 --> 03:38:48,590
You exploded on my screen.

4376
03:38:48,710 --> 03:38:49,570
What do you mean?

4377
03:38:50,130 --> 03:38:53,630
I literally saw you explode on my screen.

4378
03:38:58,230 --> 03:38:59,770
Oh my god.

4379
03:39:03,830 --> 03:39:04,490
Here you go.

4380
03:39:04,510 --> 03:39:05,810
Let's go do the fucking radio.

4381
03:39:07,590 --> 03:39:09,070
The rodeo.

4382
03:39:10,210 --> 03:39:10,750
Yay.

4383
03:39:16,930 --> 03:39:18,370
Why don't we stop?

4384
03:39:18,470 --> 03:39:20,430
Stay on the bull as long as you can.

4385
03:39:21,870 --> 03:39:22,590
How do you do that?

4386
03:39:23,030 --> 03:39:23,570
I don't know.

4387
03:39:24,250 --> 03:39:25,110
Won't happen.

4388
03:39:25,410 --> 03:39:26,830
I'm glued to this bull.

4389
03:39:28,310 --> 03:39:35,750
Oh, oh, it's just it's it's just a rhythm game So I assume
it gets worse, right?

4390
03:39:37,930 --> 03:39:43,650
Look at me go Oh my gosh, so fucking easy

4391
03:39:46,910 --> 03:39:48,130
Is that not B?

4392
03:39:50,010 --> 03:39:51,610
Why do I keep crashing?

4393
03:39:52,610 --> 03:39:53,010
Why?

4394
03:39:54,070 --> 03:39:55,390
Did you crash again?

4395
03:39:55,410 --> 03:39:57,750
Why does it keep happening?

4396
03:39:58,410 --> 03:40:00,910
It won't let us progress.

4397
03:40:01,270 --> 03:40:03,210
Okay, let's just not do the rodeo.

4398
03:40:03,370 --> 03:40:04,770
Let's not do the rodeo.

4399
03:40:08,750 --> 03:40:12,090
Let's just progress the game.

4400
03:40:12,370 --> 03:40:14,670
Let's just progress the game.

4401
03:40:17,890 --> 03:40:19,450
It's the server.

4402
03:40:20,250 --> 03:40:21,550
Oh my god!

4403
03:40:22,150 --> 03:40:25,390
It won't even let me connect to the server.

4404
03:40:25,410 --> 03:40:32,010
Pretty boy Give me a I think this was a good point to stop.

4405
03:40:36,260 --> 03:40:43,460
I Gooby I think I think this is a good time.

4406
03:40:43,640 --> 03:40:45,700
It's not my PC issue.

4407
03:40:46,060 --> 03:40:57,960
It's connection It's a connection It's not it's not even the
PC issue Yeah It's okay.

4408
03:40:58,260 --> 03:41:01,280
We could finish it another time.

4409
03:41:03,820 --> 03:41:05,760
It's a server issue.

4410
03:41:06,500 --> 03:41:08,320
I have a great time, though, Gumi.

4411
03:41:08,740 --> 03:41:13,240
I think our marriage has been quite solid so far.

4412
03:41:13,440 --> 03:41:14,080
Yeah, no.

4413
03:41:14,200 --> 03:41:15,780
That was pretty cool.

4414
03:41:16,220 --> 03:41:17,760
It's pretty solid.

4415
03:41:19,420 --> 03:41:20,680
Did you had a great time?

4416
03:41:20,980 --> 03:41:22,320
I think I had a great time.

4417
03:41:22,920 --> 03:41:25,200
Yeah, I had an awesome time.

4418
03:41:25,320 --> 03:41:26,920
If you had to rate it out of 10.

4419
03:41:29,780 --> 03:41:39,720
oh yeah definitely an eight an eight why isn't it a nine at

4422
03:42:01,180 --> 03:42:03,520
But anyway, that was good fun!

4423
03:42:03,520 --> 03:42:04,660
What part of the game are we on now?

4424
03:42:05,360 --> 03:42:05,540
What?

4425
03:42:07,060 --> 03:42:09,080

We're at chapter five!

03:42:20,990 --> 03:42:21,590
Out of how many?

4432
03:42:21,650 --> 03:42:22,510
We're 50%.

4433
03:42:22,510 --> 03:42:22,970
Hold on.

4434
03:42:23,190 --> 03:42:24,790
I see that you have a poll up.

4435
03:42:25,350 --> 03:42:26,650
Who's the reason for the divorce?

4436
03:42:26,810 --> 03:42:28,090
71% Doki.

4437
03:42:28,250 --> 03:42:28,510
No, I know.

4438
03:42:29,910 --> 03:42:31,530
No, I don't.

4439
03:42:34,570 --> 03:42:35,850
We're at 50%.

4440
03:42:35,850 --> 03:42:37,770
Alright, next week we're beating it.

4441
03:42:37,950 --> 03:42:39,230
We're beating it next week.

4442
03:42:40,050 --> 03:42:40,790
Give me a day.

4443
03:42:41,190 --> 03:42:41,830
No, next week.

4444
03:42:42,030 --> 03:42:42,730
We'll figure it out.

4445
03:42:43,710 --> 03:42:44,650
Okay, but I will say...

4446
03:42:45,630 --> 03:42:45,890
Yeah.

4447
03:42:45,990 --> 03:42:47,370
I'm not...

4448
03:42:48,710 --> 03:42:49,190
Actually...

4449
03:42:49,190 --> 03:42:50,970
No, I am here next week.

4450
03:42:51,270 --> 03:42:51,790
Alright, yeah.

4451
03:42:51,950 --> 03:42:52,890
Next week we'll finish it.

4452
03:42:53,490 --> 03:42:53,790
Yeah.

4453
03:42:54,070 --> 03:42:54,510
Yeah.

4454
03:42:55,190 --> 03:42:55,850
We can do it.

4455
03:42:55,870 --> 03:42:57,090
We're like speedrunning this.

4456
03:42:57,130 --> 03:42:57,890
It's so easy.

4457
03:43:00,130 --> 03:43:01,290
Yeah, it's so easy.

4458
03:43:01,470 --> 03:43:02,430
Yeah, it's so easy.

4459
03:43:02,590 --> 03:43:08,110
I think if we cut out all the times, we, like, clearly we're
just messing about.

4460
03:43:08,590 --> 03:43:09,030
Yeah.

4461
03:43:09,350 --> 03:43:13,390
We would have been, we might be, like, like, 70.

4462
03:43:13,430 --> 03:43:16,770
We would have been 70% done if we didn't fuck around too
much.

4463
03:43:17,730 --> 03:43:21,110
If we, as a team, together, didn't fuck around that much.

4464
03:43:22,050 --> 03:43:23,990
I think we would have been, like, 70% done.

4465
03:43:24,830 --> 03:43:30,350
Yeah, I think if we both completed the challenge, challenges
as fast as we could.

4466
03:43:30,570 --> 03:43:32,630
But we were just messing with them now.

4467
03:43:33,830 --> 03:43:34,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4468
03:43:35,450 --> 03:43:38,650
We, as a team, were messing around together.

4469
03:43:39,490 --> 03:43:39,970
Together.

4470
03:43:40,730 --> 03:43:40,950
Mm-hmm.
