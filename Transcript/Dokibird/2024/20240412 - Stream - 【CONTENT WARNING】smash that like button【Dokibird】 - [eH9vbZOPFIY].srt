00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,300
We should have...

927
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,960
How much do we have?

928
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:45,440
$70?

929
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,460
Can we afford anything?

930
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,980
Oh, my God.

931
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,240
Yeah?

932
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,540
What is this?

933
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:52,760
Here.

934
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,560
I think we're going to be in the race.

935
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,100
Oh.

936
00:49:59,360 --> 00:49:59,740
Okay.

937
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,340
Wait, wait, wait.

938
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,280
I ordered something that I really want.

939
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,440
That's it.

940
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,220
I already used it.

941
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,740
Wait, we should buy another one.

942
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,300
We should buy another one.

943
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,340
Party party.

944
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,660
I didn't know it was one use.

945
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,820
No one told me it was one use.

946
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,500
There it is.

947
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,400
Okay, okay, okay.

948
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,420
When we...

949
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,900
We survive?

950
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,200
Okay, I know when to use this.

951
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,260
When we survive, I'll use this.

952
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,100
Look, I have a sound boy.

953
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,640
What's this?

954
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,740
It's a sound boy.

955
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,760
Oh, you're like the sound player.

956
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hope the sound player.

957
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:57,680
Wait, what's this?

958
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,400
It's evil.

959
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,120
How to...

960
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,600
What is that?

961
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,000
What is that?

962
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,620
What is this?

963
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,340
What are you doing?

964
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,300
I don't know.

965
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,380
I don't know.

966
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,320
Are you like flying?

967
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,560
You're flying.

968
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,380
Alright, let's go.

969
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,400
Let's film content.

970
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,720
It's content time.

971
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,620
I have Hegel so I can heal you guys.

972
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:28,220
Alright.

973
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,000
Nice.

974
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,980
I love Heels.

975
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,320
Okay.

976
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,220
I have...

977
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:31,740
Hegel.

978
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,060
I'm gonna...

979
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,600
Big Bang Theory.

980
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,980
Okay, don't worry.

981
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,820
That scared me actually.

982
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:46,820
Cool transition.

983
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,820
Oh my god, I don't like the song.

984
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,320
Oh, this is gonna make everything sound good.

985
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:01,380
Y'all be careful!

986
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,400
The dance beads box.

987
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,460
Don't worry, when it's funny, I'll play this.

988
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,820
So everyone will know it's funny.

989
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,580
Everyone will play.

990
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,020
I just feel like that is...

991
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,960
It's face carry.

992
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:20,920
Woo!

993
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,250
Alright, here we go.

994
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,270
Alright.

995
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,610
I should have recorded that.

996
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,610
Oh, that's a lot of lasers.

997
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,690
Wait, wait, wait, I got it, I got an idea.

998
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:39,050
Okay.

00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,590
Let's go.

00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,590
You got this.

1001
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:45,610
Oh,

00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,590

1003
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,210
You did?

1004
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,570
Okay, nice, nice content.

Okay.

1007
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,590
I can do this too.

1008
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,060
Nice, look at us.

1009
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:09,860
We're so good.

1010
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,620
We're already so...

Alright.

1014
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,580
We need to find some monsters for content.

1015
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,660
Oh, there's a head here.

1016
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,310
I haven't seen any monsters yet.

1017
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:31,110
Follow me, follow me.

1018
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,750
I'm so good at finding monsters.

1019
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,890

01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:06,000
If I was still alive, I would have taken them home.

1812
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:15,640

1819
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:30,500
They did not deserve it.

1820
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,180
They did not deserve to live.

1821
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,740
They should have died with me!

1822
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:40,560

Content.

1865
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:35,290

1866
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:36,110
Can I do that?

1867
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:39,990

1868
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:44,410
Okay, I didn't want to buy a flashlight.

1869
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:46,290
We have no money.

1870
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:48,710
No, we can buy a flashlight.

1871
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:49,470

We would get more money.

This is one Akasupa.

2386
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:00,900
If you want to have this, it is one Akasupa.

2387

02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:26,660
I'm gonna find a monster and bring it to them for content,
guys.

2396
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:28,920
It's gonna be... Just think about the views, chat.

2397
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:30,420
Think about the...

2398

02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:40,980

2402
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:46,370
Wait, where is it?

2403
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,320
Where did he go?

2404
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,280
Where did he go?

2405
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:52,800
Did he blow himself up?

2406
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:54,520
Where did he go?

2407
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:59,900
Wait, did the monster...

2408
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:02,820
Did the monster blow himself up?

2409
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:05,400
Hello?

2410
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:08,940

2411
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:09,960
Hello?

2413
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:18,880
Where do they go?

2414
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:19,660
Hello?

2415
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:23,100

02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:29,320
Not, Chad!

2418
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:32,160
They left me!

2419
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:34,680
Why could they leave me like this?

2420
02:04:35,700 --> 02:04:37,120
Oh, no.

2421
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:39,160
I have nothing.

2422
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:41,620
What's that?

2423
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:44,240
I can't believe it.

2424
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:45,640
I would never ditch them.

2425
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,340
That's so fucked up.

2426
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:51,160
There it is.

2427
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:53,040
That's so fucked up.

2428
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:54,460
I would never do such a thing.

2429
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:55,720
Hello?

2430
02:04:57,140 --> 02:04:57,700

Oh, my God.

2447
02:05:58,690 --> 02:06:00,490
They're getting further and further away from the ship.

2448
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:02,850
I have no idea where they are.

2449
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:07,230
Oh, my God.

2450
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:08,250
They're so far away.

2451
02:06:08,410 --> 02:06:09,870
Guys, they're so fucking far away.

2452
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:11,170
How the fuck am I supposed to...

2453
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:13,790
Hello?

2454
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:18,590
You do not hear jacked shit.

2455
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:20,830
What do you mean you can still hear them?

2456
02:06:21,230 --> 02:06:23,650
Look at how far they are away from me.

2457
02:06:24,850 --> 02:06:27,030
How do you have 60% oxygen still?

2458
02:06:28,250 --> 02:06:28,770
Is this here?

2459
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:29,630
No, that's Ditto.

2460
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:31,350
Did you spend your time in the ship?

2461
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:32,610
Okay.

2462
02:06:33,910 --> 02:06:35,810
Wait, do I lose oxygen if I...

2463
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:38,550
Alright.

2464
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:41,070
They're still really far away from me.

2465
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:42,370
All right.

2466
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:44,950
They seem to...

2467
02:06:44,950 --> 02:06:45,270
Yeah, they...

2468
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:46,410
No, I'm pretty sure they're together.

2469
02:06:47,090 --> 02:06:47,610
I'm pretty sure.

2470
02:06:47,690 --> 02:06:49,530
They just don't have a flashlight at all.

2471
02:06:49,870 --> 02:06:50,470
They just...

2472
02:06:51,790 --> 02:06:53,010
They're definitely together.

2473
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:54,970
It's just that they don't have a flashlight.

2474
02:06:56,930 --> 02:06:57,410
All right.

2475
02:06:58,830 --> 02:06:59,270
Okay.

2476
02:06:59,590 --> 02:07:00,270
And they have the camera.

2477
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:01,190
They're making content.

2478
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:03,130

2479
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:05,470

2744
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:19,810
Overwatch 2 is gonna be free soon.

2745
02:24:28,310 --> 02:24:29,790
What an end.

2746
02:24:31,430 --> 02:24:32,510
We should have recorded that.

2747
02:24:32,590 --> 02:24:34,230
That was such a good line to end on.

2748
02:24:36,390 --> 02:24:38,490
Are we gonna stay the video?

2749
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:39,570
We should sack it.

2750
02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:41,290
We have so much, so many views.

2751
02:24:42,210 --> 02:24:42,850
Sack it, sack it.

All right.

2753
02:24:44,150 --> 02:24:45,810

02:24:46,550 --> 02:24:46,750
Okay?

2755
02:24:48,030 --> 02:24:49,790
When we all die.

2756
02:24:50,010 --> 02:24:50,230
When we all die, we end.

2757
02:24:50,450 --> 02:24:54,270
When we lose our channel, we all end collab.

2758
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:55,590
Okay, okay.

2759
02:24:55,810 --> 02:24:59,770

03:06:32,940 --> 03:06:33,600
Film time.

3643
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:35,060
Yeah, yeah.

One million views.

03:06:37,720 --> 03:06:38,440
One million views!

3648
03:06:38,600 --> 03:06:39,120
We got this!

3649
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:39,680
I believe!

3650
03:06:40,420 --> 03:06:41,760
One million views!

3651
03:06:41,940 --> 03:06:42,420
Let's go!

3652
03:06:43,580 --> 03:06:44,880
I believe in us.

3653
03:06:46,060 --> 03:06:47,780
We can do it for content.

3654
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:50,340
We're so good at this game though.

3655
03:06:50,340 --> 03:06:51,220
We're so good!

3656
03:06:51,340 --> 03:06:52,580
We're so good at content!

3657
03:06:52,800 --> 03:06:53,600
Wait, is this new?

3658
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:55,980
Whoa!

3659
03:06:56,880 --> 03:07:00,240
Yeah, this is a weird area.

3660
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:01,660
Whoa!

3661
03:07:02,160 --> 03:07:03,120
Wait, where is this?

3662
03:07:03,660 --> 03:07:04,120
Yeah.

3663
03:07:05,700 --> 03:07:07,520
This looks like a new thing.

3664
03:07:07,600 --> 03:07:08,120
Oh, it's here!

3665
03:07:08,660 --> 03:07:09,640
Oh, it's this area!

3666
03:07:09,860 --> 03:07:10,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3667
03:07:11,260 --> 03:07:11,280
Ah!

3668
03:07:14,120 --> 03:07:15,360
Jump jump time!

3669
03:07:15,820 --> 03:07:16,680
Jump!

3670
03:07:18,260 --> 03:07:18,260
Jump!

3671
03:07:19,660 --> 03:07:20,080
Yeah!

3672
03:07:21,140 --> 03:07:21,580
Jump!

3673
03:07:22,520 --> 03:07:25,700
Oh, there's animal statues!

3674
03:07:26,180 --> 03:07:26,780
Look, look, look!

3675
03:07:28,340 --> 03:07:28,740
Look!

3676
03:07:30,140 --> 03:07:30,900
This is Ditto.

3677
03:07:31,880 --> 03:07:32,200
Oh wait!

3678
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:32,660
Look at

3679
03:07:36,710 --> 03:07:38,410
her!

3680
03:07:48,410 --> 03:07:58,670
What is the funny?

3681
03:07:59,090 --> 03:07:59,310
What is the funny?

3682
03:07:59,310 --> 03:07:59,930
I'm sorry!

3683
03:08:04,630 --> 03:08:06,830
I was like, you know, I was like, I don't know.

3684
03:08:06,850 --> 03:08:07,810
Filming, filming, filming!

3685
03:08:09,650 --> 03:08:11,390
That's the wrong one!

3686
03:08:33,140 --> 03:08:35,740
No, no, who has the defam?

3687
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:37,000
Give me the defam.

3688
03:08:37,300 --> 03:08:37,720
The defam!

3689
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:41,180
I can't drop the defam.

3690
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:48,120
I can't drop the defam!

3691
03:08:48,700 --> 03:08:51,000
I'm trying to defam!

3692
03:08:51,100 --> 03:08:54,120
Are you all right?

3693
03:08:54,380 --> 03:08:54,860
No!

3694
03:08:56,700 --> 03:08:57,180
DOOM!

3695
03:08:57,320 --> 03:08:57,800
DOOM!

3696
03:08:58,000 --> 03:08:59,560
What did I love!?

3697
03:08:59,560 --> 03:09:01,060
What did I love?

3698
03:09:01,400 --> 03:09:01,620
We die.

3699
03:09:02,400 --> 03:09:03,020
We die.

3700
03:09:03,280 --> 03:09:04,380
I'm flying!

3701
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:06,500
Hey, I cut!

3702
03:09:09,300 --> 03:09:11,060
We're all sick.

3703
03:09:12,460 --> 03:09:12,940
DOOM!

3704
03:09:13,320 --> 03:09:14,720
We can get the camera.

3705
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:16,580
It's OK, I think we have the camera.

3706
03:09:16,900 --> 03:09:18,020
We have the camera.

3707
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:20,380
Oh, no.

3708
03:09:22,220 --> 03:09:23,080
I'm gonna go.

3709
03:09:23,600 --> 03:09:24,580
He's at one.

3710
03:09:24,900 --> 03:09:25,500
Wait, wait, wait.

3711
03:09:25,820 --> 03:09:26,020

Oh, this is the other video.

3717
03:09:59,940 --> 03:10:00,460
We have one.

3718
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:01,000
We have one.

3719
03:10:01,660 --> 03:10:02,720
Okay, okay, okay.

3720
03:10:02,960 --> 03:10:05,320
We need money.

Insert it.

3722
03:10:12,360 --> 03:10:13,220
I can insert it.

3723
03:10:13,320 --> 03:10:13,840
Wait, what?

3724
03:10:14,260 --> 03:10:14,900

Oh, no.

3729
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:28,940
Take a video.

3730
03:10:29,200 --> 03:10:29,440
No!

3731
03:10:30,060 --> 03:10:30,780
No, please.

3732
03:10:31,320 --> 03:10:31,800
No.

3733
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:33,280
Okay, maybe next day.

3734
03:10:33,360 --> 03:10:34,200
Maybe next day.

3735
03:10:34,780 --> 03:10:35,280
Okay, maybe.

3736
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:37,240
Next day.

3737
03:10:37,420 --> 03:10:38,020
Next day.

3738
03:10:38,020 --> 03:10:38,520
Next day.

3739
03:10:39,740 --> 03:10:40,440
Okay, put it here.

3740
03:10:40,740 --> 03:10:41,220
Sleepy.

3741
03:10:41,360 --> 03:10:42,080
Who has it?

3742
03:10:42,140 --> 03:10:42,700
Oh, I do.

3743
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:44,560
My hand is stuck.

3744
03:10:44,680 --> 03:10:45,220
Okay, there you go.

3745
03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:47,120
Okay.

3746
03:10:48,320 --> 03:10:50,020
Okay, oh my god, I'm stuck.

3747
03:10:51,740 --> 03:10:52,460
Okay, there you go.

3748
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:53,080
I got it.

3749
03:10:53,660 --> 03:10:54,220
I got it.

3750
03:10:56,020 --> 03:10:56,620
I got it.

3751
03:10:56,620 --> 03:10:59,100
Oh, but that was converted a while ago, right?

3752
03:10:59,220 --> 03:11:00,020
That one was converted.

3753
03:11:00,140 --> 03:11:01,600
No, that was converted yesterday.

3754
03:11:02,140 --> 03:11:03,640
That's because we, it's because you crashed.

3755
03:11:06,160 --> 03:11:10,200
I don't think it was, it saved the floor to crash at Slio's.

3756
03:11:10,200 --> 03:11:10,440
Oh, I know.

3757
03:11:11,040 --> 03:11:13,340
Oh, someone said the crash could erase it.

3758
03:11:13,780 --> 03:11:15,620
No, did it actually?

3759
03:11:17,340 --> 03:11:18,920
Oh, the crash erased.

3760
03:11:19,120 --> 03:11:20,280
Oh, it's offline.

3761
03:11:20,500 --> 03:11:20,980
It's offline.

3762
03:11:21,140 --> 03:11:22,300
I think they can't see it now.

3763
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
Okay, let's get the, let's get the video camera.

3764
03:11:26,020 --> 03:11:28,520
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3765
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:30,020
Oh my god, we have nothing.

3766
03:11:31,340 --> 03:11:33,040
It's okay, we'll check again.

3767
03:11:33,700 --> 03:11:34,940
We'll check again later.

3768
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:36,740
We just need a big monster.

3769
03:11:37,380 --> 03:11:39,020
A big monster and then we'll be famous.

3770
03:11:40,580 --> 03:11:41,480
Can I, can I?

3771
03:11:42,140 --> 03:11:43,120
Yeah, big monster.

3772
03:11:44,980 --> 03:11:45,300
Gotcha.

3773
03:11:47,460 --> 03:11:47,980
Yes.

3774
03:11:49,060 --> 03:11:49,280
Okay.

3775
03:11:50,460 --> 03:11:51,500
Okay, I'll try my best.

3776
03:11:52,100 --> 03:11:53,040
Film a good video.

3777
03:11:53,620 --> 03:11:54,600
Oh, it's here.

3778
03:11:56,820 --> 03:11:57,340
Gambatic!

3779
03:11:58,440 --> 03:11:58,860
What?

3780
03:11:59,060 --> 03:11:59,740
It's right here, right?

3781
03:12:00,100 --> 03:12:00,540
The camera?

3782
03:12:01,120 --> 03:12:01,640
Was it here?

3783
03:12:02,100 --> 03:12:04,040
Oh, we, um, we can't get it back?

3784
03:12:04,380 --> 03:12:04,640
Yay!

3785
03:12:05,460 --> 03:12:08,400
Yesterday he played, um, it didn't spawn.

3786
03:12:10,280 --> 03:12:12,160
I believe in this.

3787
03:12:13,800 --> 03:12:15,300
We can do it.

3788
03:12:15,320 --> 03:12:16,320
He's not too far.

3789
03:12:17,480 --> 03:12:18,440
Where's the voice that song?

3790
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:20,280
Wait, how do you know where the camera is?

3791
03:12:20,560 --> 03:12:20,740
You know?

3792
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:23,360
It's land on here, right?

3793
03:12:23,640 --> 03:12:24,100
Oh!

3794
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:25,400
Oh!

3795
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:32,640
We should have died here, right?

3796
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:37,740
It's land on, I think, I think it's land on.

3797
03:12:39,880 --> 03:12:40,880
It's not here.

3798
03:12:41,520 --> 03:12:42,300
Where did she die?

3799
03:12:42,720 --> 03:12:43,820
I died, like, here.

3800
03:12:44,300 --> 03:12:45,740
But it would light up.

3801
03:12:46,100 --> 03:12:47,420
It would show the camera.

3802
03:12:48,120 --> 03:12:52,120
I think it's the other exit.

3803
03:12:52,380 --> 03:12:53,840
Yeah, maybe it's in the other exit.

3804
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:55,300
Let's just explore.

3805
03:12:56,980 --> 03:12:57,940
Explore time.

3806
03:12:58,660 --> 03:12:59,320
Let's go.

3807
03:12:59,420 --> 03:12:59,760
Let's go.

3808
03:13:00,060 --> 03:13:01,360
We need to find big monsters.

3809
03:13:06,020 --> 03:13:06,980
Natcha's here.

3810
03:13:07,120 --> 03:13:07,940
We need to wait for Hiro.

3811
03:13:08,420 --> 03:13:10,220
I was like, what do you mean?

3812
03:13:10,660 --> 03:13:11,440
She's here.

3813
03:13:13,240 --> 03:13:14,120
Wrong cat.

3814
03:13:14,500 --> 03:13:15,260
Wrong cat.

3815
03:13:15,800 --> 03:13:18,040
I couldn't see the face.

3816
03:13:21,100 --> 03:13:21,760
All right.

3817
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:22,860
There's no monsters.

3818
03:13:25,460 --> 03:13:25,880
Oh.

3819
03:13:26,020 --> 03:13:26,240
Oh!

3820
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:26,780
The tongue!

3821
03:13:27,020 --> 03:13:27,660
Tongue, tongue, tongue!

3822
03:13:28,420 --> 03:13:28,900
Goodbye!

3823
03:13:31,920 --> 03:13:32,160
Goodbye!

3824
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:32,520
Goodbye!

3825
03:13:33,100 --> 03:13:34,480
Give us camera!

3826
03:13:34,620 --> 03:13:35,160
Give us camera!

3827
03:13:35,480 --> 03:13:36,820

But I'm gonna be a hero.

3884
03:16:20,380 --> 03:16:21,820

and nachan um i'm really happy to be able to collab with

4073
03:27:03,180 --> 03:27:11,660
them um it's so fun playing content warning for the first
time i can't believe i can't believe i was the last hope and

4074
03:27:11,660 --> 03:27:20,640
it got fucking sucked up by the fucking tongue but oh my god
it's been three out i didn't realize we've been playing

content warning for three

4076
03:27:24,900 --> 03:27:29,100
But yeah, bro, content warning has to be so hard to audio
balance.

4077
03:27:29,200 --> 03:27:33,220
I didn't realize how hard it was to audio balance content
warning.

4078
03:27:33,400 --> 03:27:37,020
It was such a, it was so, like the echo.

4079
03:27:37,220 --> 03:27:39,280
I wish you could like turn down the echo.

4080
03:27:40,100 --> 03:27:41,280
I can't believe it.

4081
03:27:41,360 --> 03:27:43,540
You can't turn down the echo for that.

4082
03:27:43,700 --> 03:27:44,560
It's crazy.

03:27:45,120 --> 03:27:45,440
