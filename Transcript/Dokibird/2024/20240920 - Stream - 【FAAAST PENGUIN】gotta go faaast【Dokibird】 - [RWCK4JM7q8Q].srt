1
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,710
Whoa!

2
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,870
Everybody!

3
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,570
Did you guys like the beginning of the stream where we all started out with the penguin me?

4
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,730
Yes!

5
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,270
I am... I am a professional.

6
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,710
Wow!

7
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,250
So professional!

8
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,950
Doki!

9
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:14,310
I would like to say a huge shout out to Fast Penguin and Historia for the sponsor for today.

10
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,690
Yes, this is a sponsored stream by the way.

11
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,830
This is a sponsored stream.

12
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,270
So they paid me to check out their game.

13
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,270
And it seems really fun honestly.

14
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,330
I mean it's free to play so... I mean I like that part a lot.

15
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,230
I mean...

16
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,150
Everybody likes free stuff.

17
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,750
So this game is free to play, free to download.

18
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,910
So you can hop on in Dragoons if you want to.

19
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:49,970
You can check out the link and the pinned messages and in the description to download the game.

20
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,810
And it really helps the stream a lot as well.

21
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,070
It really helps the sponsor and it really helps the stream.

22
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,090
So you can join in and play some lobbies with me.

23
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,310
I'm gonna be doing like public matchmaking first.

24
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,230
But they also have custom lobbies.

25
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,870
So later on we're gonna try out the public matchmaking.

26
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,510
And then later on we're gonna try out custom lobbies.

27
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,010
So the Dragoons can like join in with me as well.

28
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,170
Give me a sec.

29
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,130
I'm gonna... Oh there we go.

30
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,010
Apparently people were telling me that the BGM is great.

31
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,070
It really is though.

32
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,750
It really is.

33
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,910
But someone was like, oh my god.

34
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,150
My brain is melting.

35
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,390
It's not happening for any of this.

36
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,070
It gets me excited for Penguins.

37
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:42,850
Alright.

38
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,170
I plugged in my controller.

39
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,350
So I'm gonna play on the Roller.

40
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,510
Because it's basically, for those who don't know, what fast Penguin is.

41
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,870
Oh.

42
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:51,670
Woah.

43
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,170
You can have a fucking pig?

44
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,250
Oh wait.

45
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,570
Give me a sec.

46
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,810
Let me double check if I can swear.

47
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,570
Oh.

48
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,810
Okay, I... okay, yes, okay.

49
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,700
Let me double that.

50
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,540
I was like, oh no, wait, I don't remember if I'm left to curse.

51
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,780
I'm going to try not to.

52
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,660
I'm going to try not to curse today, chat.

53
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,540
Anyway, I'm a very professional.

54
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:37,940
Anyway, so for those who don't know, this is basically like a battle royale racing game, which is a very interesting concept.

55
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:45,220
You know, never heard of a battle royale game for racing in general, but like you're not racing cars, you're racing penguins.

56
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,280
And the game is out on Steam.

57
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,900
I believe it's on Steam, PlayStation 5, and the Epic Game Store.

58
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,400
But they're going to... it's going to come out on the Switch and the Xbox series soon.

59
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,280
So for now, you can only get it on the PlayStation 5.

60
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,080
See, I told you PS5 has games.

61
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,000
The Epic Game Store and Steam, and they're all... and there is cross-platform play.

62
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,920
So it supports cross-platform, and it is, like I said, it's free.

63
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,460
So if you guys want to download the game, like I said, it's pinned in the description.

64
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,300
Sorry, it's in the description.

65
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,740
I'm sorry.

66
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,140
It's 1230.

67
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,380
Dad woke me up several times.

68
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:45,480
It's 8 in the morning, because apparently, there was an inspection today, and I didn't realize there was a goddamn inspection today, so they woke me up at 8 in the morning, because they're like, they're like, hello, we're here to inspect your house, your apartment,

69
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,760
and I'm like, it's 8 in the morning.

70
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,420
This one of mine is a little jumbled up right now.

71
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:06,320
Anyway, as I was saying, the link is in the description, and it's pinned in the chat, so if you guys want to check it out as well, and download the game and play with me.

72
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,600
Each lobby supports, like, 40 players, which is a lot.

73
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,000
That's a lot.

74
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:20,400
And there's, like, solo mode, which supports 40 players, and you can also, like, duo, trio, quadruple, I don't know, four stack.

75
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,820
Duo, trio, four stack in party mode.

76
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,360
And, like I said, there is private lobbies, so I can make a custom lobby later.

77
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,460
And you can also customize your penguin and everything.

78
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,060
Do I have clothes?

79
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,040
Oh, oh, I can give myself a new yellow.

80
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,720
Okay, I can be a naked penguin.

81
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,840
Oh, I got a skateboard?

82
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh my god, I got a whale?

83
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,600
Oh, wait, I can say hi to people.

84
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,620
Oh, okay, nice.

85
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,300
Hi.

86
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,760
Oh, that's so cute!

87
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,300
Wait, that's so cute!

88
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,610
I can be...

89
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,150
I can be naked!

90
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,010
Nice.

91
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,150
Oh, wait, I want to have...

92
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,610
Wait!

93
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,150
I don't want to be naked.

94
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,070
That means I'm poor.

95
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,650
I want to have this outfit!

96
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:07,810
No!

97
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,190
Never mind, guys.

98
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,250
I don't want to be naked anymore, because people will think I'm a poor penguin.

99
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,990
Anyway, so we're going to try out the first game here.

100
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,970
This is a large-scale online multiplayer game.

101
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,130
Complete all four activities and aim for the podium.

102
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,310
The number of people can clear each activity is limited.

103
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,170
Oh, yeah, so there's four different games until the final.

104
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,410
So, like, you get eliminated per activity.

105
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,290
And then you get to the final and then you get the crown.

106
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,570
So, the player with the highest points basically...

107
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,230
Oh, wait, what's else?

108
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,070
X.

109
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,370
Okay.

110
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,390
Oh, that's so cool!

111
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,830
The moment...

112
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,170
It changes the control input on there.

113
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:53,550
Okay.

114
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,130
Kick and jump off enemies.

115
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,010
To quickly pass rivals in one go.

116
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,450
If you fail, you won't be able to attack for a while.

117
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,290
Okay.

118
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,950
Collect 10 cans of sardines to use the ultimate ride.

119
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,630
Get in the lead by kicking others out of the way.

120
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,570
If you're lucky enough to obtain the paraglider ball, it's a game changer.

121
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,010
Glide through the air to first place.

122
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,410
Also, how's the volume?

123
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,590
Is everything okay for the volume?

124
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,750
Yeah, I think it's like...

125
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,550
Yeah, I think...

126
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,930
I think it could be like Fall Guys and Mario Kart.

127
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,610
It seems really fun.

128
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,430
In concept.

129
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,070
That's it from me.

130
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,990
Bon voyage!

131
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,750
Is the music...

132
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,610
You're just a hater.

133
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,690
I like how someone's like, Game background music is a bit soft.

134
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,550
And someone else is like, Music is too loud.

135
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,490
Someone's just a hater.

136
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,490
No!

137
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,990
Turn it down!

138
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,070
No!

139
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,670
Please!

140
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,670
Welcome to my world!

141
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:02,790
Okay.

142
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,710
Alright, I'm gonna be a PG here.

143
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:06,610
Alright.

144
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,050
We're queuing up.

145
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,450
Guys, queue up, guys.

146
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,270
You might be able to be in my lobby, guys.

147
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:12,950
Queue up.

148
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,010
Wait, what's in the shop?

149
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,350
Can I look at the shop while I'm in queue?

150
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,550
I assume I can, right?

151
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,430
Oh, I can!

152
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,450
The weather is nice today.

153
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,370
Don't you think so?

154
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,490
Wait, I can like, Ride on a burger.

155
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,050
Oh my god!

156
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,240
Wait, what's this?

157
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,540
I cannot get on a luggage?

158
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,720
Wait, this is so cute.

159
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,840
I can put stickers on my luggage.

160
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh my god!

161
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,680
I can be a cat!

162
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
I can be...

163
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,000
I can be a cat!

164
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,700
Alright.

165
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,100
Hey, guys.

166
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,140
Hey.

167
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,180
Oh!

168
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,900
Guys!

169
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,920
Please!

170
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,040
Please!

171
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,240
Friendly!

172
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,780
Friendly!

173
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,880
Hello, everybody!

174
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,920
Hello!

175
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:03,900
Yeah!

176
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,580
Wait, how do I...

177
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,900
How do you guys do this?

178
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,720
Oh, nice!

179
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,080
Wait, how come that guy...

180
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,720

You're a gamer!

Okay.

00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,190
Get slapped.

206
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,670
Okay.

207
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,170
Hello, beach.

Oh!

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,650
Hello, everybody.

212
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,650
Friendly?

213
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,010
Oh, so like, basically, you'll miss.

214
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,450
No!

215
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,070
No!

216
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,410
Wait!

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,730
No!

224
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,130
It's not fair!

225
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,310
I didn't realize it's not fair!

226
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,550
I didn't realize it's not fair.

227
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,050
Okay.

228
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,630
That's illegal!

229
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,610
How did they get the paraglider?

230
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,690
Are they cheating?

231
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,950
That's right!

232
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,250

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,850
I ain't afraid to slap you!

238
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,670
That's right!

239
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,170
I ain't afraid to slap you!

240
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,470
Oh, you see that?

241
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,070
No!

242
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,310
No!

243
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:58,930
Cops!

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,410
They slapped me!

246
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,430
That's right!

247
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,290
Oh, you thought you could slap me?

248
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,890
That's goddamn right!

249
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,470
That's right!

250
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,890
Get out of the way!

251
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,270
Cops!

252
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,990
Cops!

253
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,410
No!

254
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,030
Did anyone get the number?

255
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:20,790
No!

256
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,370
I could have slapped you in time!

257
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:23,790
No!

258
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,150

260
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,450
Oh, I thought I died.

261
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,130
I thought I died there.

262
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,070
Did anyone get her number?

263
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,510
Wait, 17?

264
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,730
Wait, I must make it!

265
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,470
I must make it!

266
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:37,730

Oh, I just barely made it!

268
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,250
That's right!

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,250
Yeah, that's right.

270
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,410
I'm a gamer.

271
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,190
It's so goddamn opposite!

272
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,470
That's right!

274
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,710
Where am I?

275
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,470
Oh, this is me!

276
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,590

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,370
Like, it was pretty bad.

We're still in it!

We just gotta wait until somebody gets close to you so you can...STOP!

319

373
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,270
You!

374
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,490
Don't say it!

375
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,090
It's okay!

376
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,830
It's okay!

377
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,370
I didn't say it!

378
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,210
I was...

379
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,490
I was peachy!

380
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,590
I was peachy!

381
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,930
I just tried so hard!

382
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,410
I mean, these penguins!

383
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,510
These penguins!

384
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,450
No!

385
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,330
You penguin!

386
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:01,590
No!

387
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,510
You stupid penguin!

388
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,070
That's not!

389
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,970
That's peachy!

390
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,790
I'm calling him stupid and peachy!

391
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,550
Guys!

392
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,070
I'm in!

393
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,810
You bad penguins!

394
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,490
You bad penguins!

395
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,250
It's okay!

396
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,050
It's okay!

397
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,550
It's okay!

398
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,710
Okay, cat penguin got it instead of, like, goddamn pineapple penguin!

399
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,810
You don't deserve it!

400
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,090
You don't deserve it!

401
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,050
I literally just played the game today!

402
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,730
That's worse!

403
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,330
Okay, final race!

404
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,250
Final race, guys!

405
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,430
This is it!

406
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,430
This is it!

407
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,990
Please!

408
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,390
Please!

409
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,950
I'm just new here!

410
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,990
I'm a new gamer!

411
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,130
I'm just a beginner!

412
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,950
I'm, like...

413
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,970
My Oshie's saying, no, no.

414
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,010
How did I get so far?!

415
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,750
Oh, my god!

416
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,730
They must be cheating!

417
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,670
I refused!

418
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:03,350
No!

419
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,830
You bad penguin!

420
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,170
I'm gonna slap you first!

421
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,310
No, I couldn't slap him first!

422
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,850
I couldn't slap him first!

423
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:14,930
This is not fair!

424
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,050
I'm coming after you!

425
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,950
It's okay, it's okay.

426
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,430
This guy, this is my next target.

427
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,390
I'm getting targeted!

428
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,910
I'm naturally getting targeted!

429
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,150
This is not fair!

430
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,450
That's right.

431
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,750
Yeah, that's right.

432
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,110
You saw me there, didn't you?

433
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,350
Oh my god.

434
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,050
It's the pineapple!

435
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,790
I'm not gonna make it!

436
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,390
The pineapple!

437
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,680
Penguin hates me!

438
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,820
I...

439
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
Okay, it's okay.

440
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,040
I made it.

441
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,620
I made it across.

442
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,340
I made it across.

443
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:02,300
You goddamn penguin.

444
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,060
You goddamn penguin.

445
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,860
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it, guys.

446
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,760
I think I'm...

447
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,620
Why?

448
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,720
Dad, why?

449
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,380
Why did you have to save me?

450
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,980
Why did you have to slap me?

451
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,340
Oh, no.

452
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
No, please.

453
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,700
I'm not the last one.

454
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

455
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:29,960
Yes!

456
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,360
No!

457
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,740
I hate you!

458
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,060
I hate you!

459
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,720
I hate you so much!

460
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,720
I hate you so much!

461
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,020
I hate

462
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,280
you so much!

463
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,780
They took it from me!

464
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,760
They took it from me!

465
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,740
They took it from me!

466
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,680
Oh, no!

467
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,540
Who the heck?

468
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,060
Who the heck was the 8th person?

469
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,980
Who the...

470
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,440
Who the heck is the 8th person?

471
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,400
Right at the end.

472
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,960
This is not fair.

473
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,240
This is...

474
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,040
This is not fair.

475
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,240
I don't understand.

476
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,120
I was doing so well.

477
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,800
Oh, my God.

478
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,260
I didn't know what the penguin...

479
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,360
Oh, my God.

480
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,060
I don't know what it is.

481
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,220
But I get very...

482
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,120
Guys, I don't know if you know this, but I get very competitive.

483
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,720
I get very...

484
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,100
What a tarnation.

485
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,520
This is so...

486
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,220
This is so bull penguin.

487
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,100
This is so bull penguin.

488
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,860
This is so bull penguin.

489
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,380
That they knocked me out on the last second.

490
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,340
This should be legal.

491
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,380
This should be legal.

492
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,820
There should be penguin police that I can call.

493
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,100
This should be absolutely bonkers.

494
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,040
This should be absolutely bonkers.

495
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,640
I should be able to call the penguin cops on these.

496
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,840
Anyone get the license plates on those penguins?

497
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,380
Did anyone get the license plate on those penguins?

498
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,780
Those goddamn penguins!

499
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,520
Oh my god!

500
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,980
Okay, you're fine, Doki.

501
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,420
You're fine.

502
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,040
You're fine.

503
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,680
Unlicensed penguins.

504
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,920
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

505
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,340
Thank you.

506
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,880
Thank you.

507
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,260
Imagine little Timmy playing with his Oshie Doki and being called a penguin for going faster.

508
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,220
Thank you for the super chat.

509
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,740
Thank you.

510
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,220
Thank you.

511
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,320
I am family friendly.

512
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,980
Anyway, as you guys can see, the more you attack people, the faster you get.

513
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,340
I don't understand.

514
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,320
Why can they slap me?

515
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,720
I'm the streamer here.

516
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,140
Why are they slapping me?

517
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,180
But yes, so if you get your slap correctly, you can basically slap again.

518
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,920
So the whole instance is you gotta keep slapping.

519
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,980
So the more slaps you do, the faster you go.

520
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,380
Like, how dare they slap me.

521
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,460
What happened to streamer privileges?

522
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,600
Exactly.

523
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,420
Oh my god.

524
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,520
Oh yeah, let's look at the season pass.

525
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,120
Oh my god, you can have a molten skateboard?

526
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,760
I guess you can grind out...

527
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,280
I guess they were...

528
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,520
They already grinded the penguin points that much?

529
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,720
Oh my god.

530
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,260
Hey guys.

531
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,860
Oh, new map.

532
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,440
Hey guys.

533
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,320
I remember you.

534
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,300
I remember you.

535
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,520
No.

536
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,320
Get away.

537
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,040
Get away.

538
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,780
Get those glasses away.

539
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,240
Stop looking at me.

540
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,880
Get away.

541
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,180
Get away.

542
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,200
I will slap you.

543
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,100
Get away from me.

544
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,580
That's right.

545
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:27,940
Leave.

546
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,160
That's right.

547
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,080
Yeah.

548
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:30,720
Leave.

549
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,100
Oh!

550
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,480
What are you doing?

551
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,220
You're pineapple behind.

552
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,540
That's right.

553
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,200
What are you doing?

554
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,440
Are you even a penguin?

555
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,820
That's right.

556
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:43,700
Slap.

557
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,320
What?

558
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,940
Desktop A3W18L.

559
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:01,220
Bro, this guy This guy just connected his desktop name into into the account.

560
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,160
Hey guys.

561
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,260
How much have you guys been grinding?

562
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,400
The game just came out yesterday.

563
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,480
How do you guys have cosmetics already?

564
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,100
That's not fair.

565
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,080
That's not fair.

566
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,300
Most default user.

567
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,680
He's playing from his work computer.

568
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,420
He's playing from his work computer.

569
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,900
It literally came out at 8pm yesterday.

570
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
How do you guys have all pineapples?

571
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,660
How do you guys have all pineapples?

572
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,080
That's right.

573
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,120
Yeah.

574
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,040
What?

575
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,960
What?

576
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,360
I didn't say it.

577
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,960
You penguin.

578
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,140
You god damn penguin.

579
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,520
You god damn penguin.

580
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,520
Oh.

581
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:50,940
No.

582
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,320
I missed.

583
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,100
No.

584
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,560
He didn't miss.

585
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,800
Never miss on your slaps guys.

586
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,280
Never miss on your slaps guys.

587
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,800
He doesn't know.

588
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,420
He doesn't know about the slap mechanic.

589
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,520
That's right.

590
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:01,980
No.

591
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,360
I missed.

592
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,080
No.

593
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,880
I have to get away.

594
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,340
You don't know about the slap mechanic too.

595
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm going to take advantage of...

596
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,840
That's right.

597
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,200
My slap now.

598
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,360
That's right.

599
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,940
My slap now.

600
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,160
Oh.

601
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I see you dragon.

602
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,540
I see you.

603
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,500
I'm coming for you.

604
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:18,940
Yeah.

605
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,340
Wait.

606
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,980
Where's my...

607
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,320
Oh.

608
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,800
They stole all my sardines.

609
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,160
Where's my sardines?

610
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,620
Oh no.

611
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,380
Oh no.

612
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,320
That's right.

613
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:28,600
Oh.

614
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,280
I'm coming for you.

615
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,940
No.

616
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,540
You...

617
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,140
Use the whale.

618
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
You cheaters.

619
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,560
Don't slap me.

620
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,280
But what if I slap you instead?

621
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,300
Alright.

622
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:39,980
Get over here.

623
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,420
Haha.

624
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,000
That's right.

625
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,740
Use your whale too early.

626
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,060
Now it's my turn.

627
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,820
I'm coming in hot.

628
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,160
Oh.

629
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,380
Wait.

630
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,720
Nice.

631
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,640
Haha.

632
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,280
Fifth place.

633
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,820
Let's go.

634
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,700
That's right.

635
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,420
Fifth place.

636
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,260
Haha.

637
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,960
Look at those penguins.

638
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,100
I couldn't make it.

639
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,100
Look at them.

640
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,660
What losers.

641
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,320
Nice.

642
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,960
Yeah.

643
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,660
Wait.

644
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,180
Wait.

645
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,520
Guys.

646
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,160
Do you guys see me?

647
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,520
Guys.

648
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:09,940
I'm over here.

649
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,220
Guys.

650
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,320
Guys.

651
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,520
Please.

652
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,120
Guys.

653
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,660
Do you guys see me?

654
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,180
I'm over here.

655
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,460
Guys.

656
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,100
Guys.

657
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,680
Do you guys see me?

658
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:13,860
Guys.

659
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,820
Do you guys see me?

660
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,240
Over there?

661
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,260
It's okay.

662
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,360
You'll see me at the end.

663
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,380
Some say fifth place is the real first place.

664
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,740
Yeah.

665
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,220
Guys.

666
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,540
Yeah.

667
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,120
As a person who's been played...

668
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,980
whose game is the second game chat.

669
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,560
This is literally like first place for me.

670
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,280
How did they do that tech?

671
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,180
How did they go so far?

672
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,560
I don't... They must have slapped somebody before.

673
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,280
Oh my god.

674
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,360
That's so smart.

675
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,100
Okay.

676
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,780
Yeah.

677
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,200
Oh.

678
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,600
Yeah.

679
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,420
I did it.

680
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:54,680
Yes.

681
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:54,820
Okay.

682
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,460
Oh.

683
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,640
I did it.

684
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,080
I figured out the tech.

685
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,580
I'm so smart.

686
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,840
I figured out the tech.

687
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,200
I figured it out.

688
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,200
I knew it.

689
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
I knew there was a tech to this.

690
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,800
I was like, there has to be...

691
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,080
The way they did that, there had to be a tech for it.

692
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,220
I knew it.

693
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,380
Some say I'm just a gamer.

694
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,840
Wait.

695
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,280
What?

696
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,860
How did they get that?

697
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,780
What?

698
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,240
What?

699
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,160
Okay.

700
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,120
No, I missed.

701
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,360
Oh, that's okay.

702
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,720
I won't miss the next...

703
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,300
I won't miss the next one though.

704
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,420
Got them.

705
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,020
Got them.

706
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,160
You stupid penguins.

707
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,960
Come on.

708
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,240
Come on.

709
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,140
Come on.

710
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,300
Get closer.

711
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,400
Desktop.

712
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,900
A375.

713
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,460
Yes.

714
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,200
Alright.

715
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:50,880
Nice.

716
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,660
We're good.

717
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,140
Everything is okay.

718
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,800
I lost all my sardines.

719
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,760
This was a hidden... Oh, I stole all his sardines.

720
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,260
Never mind.

721
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,240
JK.

722
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,420
Didn't lose any more sardines.

723
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,820
Get out of the way.

724
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,140
Move, penguin.

725
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,380
Get out the way.

726
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,840
That's alright.

727
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,420
We made it.

728
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,200
We made it.

729
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,860
That's right.

730
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,880
Look at these penguins that couldn't make it.

731
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,200
That's right.

732
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:19,320
Oh.

733
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,540
Sucks to be you.

734
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,360
My sardines.

735
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,200
Thank God.

736
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,320
That's right.

737
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,840
Hey, guys.

738
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,380
Hey.

739
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,120
That's me.

740
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,820
Oh.

741
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,880
That's me.

742
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,340
Hey, guys.

743
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,180
Get out.

744
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,400
I need them to see me.

745
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,300
Get out.

746
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,620
Everybody keeps blocking me.

747
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,880
Everybody.

748
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,780
Everybody keeps blocking me.

749
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,540
That's right.

750
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,980
Stand in front of me, guys.

751
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,560
I know the movement tech.

752
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,020
Where's the countdown?

753
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,260
Set.

754
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,320
Yeah.

755
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,820
That's right.

756
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:55,860
Yeah.

757
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,080
That's right.

758
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,880

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,460
We're okay.

766
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,580
We're okay.

767
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,020
We just can't have people.

768
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,780
What?

769
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,540
Okay.

770
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:08,920
It's fine.

771
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,360
It's fine.

772
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:09,980
It's fine.

773
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,400
Desktop.

774
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,180
The guy that's on their work computer.

775
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,080
That's okay.

776
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,060
The guy that's on their work computer.

777
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,240
It's just a little ahead of me.

778
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,340
But that's okay.

779
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,200
We got this.

780
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,860
Oh, that's a seven.

781
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,040
I keep thinking that's a one.

782
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,240
And I was like, how did I lose all my sardines?

783
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,460
Yes.

784
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,100
Okay.

785
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,840
How did I smack a whale?

786
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,720
No.

787
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,880
No, no, no, no, no.

788
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,100
Okay.

789
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,420
No.

790
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:36,940
No.

791
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,080
You guys keep stealing all of the goddamn sardines.

792
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,680
Okay.

793
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,020
Nice.

794
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,080
That's right.

795
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,720
You guys used a whale at the wrong time.

796
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,460
Because now it's my turn.

797
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,020
Get out.

798
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,340
Get out.

799
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,260
You know it's penguin.

800
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,760
It's my penguin hour.

801
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,040
Alright.

802
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,960
Oh, hey.

803
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,760
Oh, no.

804
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,460
No, no, no.

805
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,020
No.

806
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,380
Into the tunnel I go.

807
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,080
No.

808
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,740
I missed.

809
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,340
I missed.

810
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,680
No.

811
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,640
We didn't miss though.

812
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Oh, come on.

813
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:02,860
Yes.

814
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,060
Oh, no.

815
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,940
No, no, no.

816
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,300
It's okay.

817
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,180
We can still make it.

818
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,400
We can still make it.

819
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,520
We can still make it, guys.

820
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,180
We're fine.

821
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,300
That's right.

822
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,440
Look who couldn't make it.

823
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,020
That's right.

824
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,800
I see you there.

825
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,620
Couldn't make it.

826
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,160
Wait.

827
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,600

830
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,220

That's right.

836
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,730

Form a wall.

So easy.

844
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,670
Oh, no.

845
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,590
Not like that.

846
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,030
Oh, no.

847
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,030
Not like that.

860
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,650
In the air?

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,530
That should be legal.

862
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,330
Oh, no.

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,390
Slap him.

866
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,110

868
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,710

Guys, please.

870
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,890
Guys, please.

871
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,930
Leave some sardines for everybody else.

872
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,430
No.

873
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,670
Oh, I missed a crab.

874
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:35,970
Okay.

Everybody.

877
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,130
I can't touch anybody.

878
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,750
I can't slap anyone.

879
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,510
Nobody is allowing me to slap.

880
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,530
Oh, yes.

881
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,010
Oh, I got the last slap.

882
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,390
The last minute slap for the ages.

883
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,030
Oh, I don't think we're gonna make it, guys.

884
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,590
I don't think we're gonna make it.

885
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,710
Everybody is...

886
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,670
No, I don't even...

887
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,850
No.

888
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,490
Wait, wait, wait.

889
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,910
Eight, nine, ten.

890
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:06,450
No!

891
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,230
I can't!

892
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,870
I can't!

893
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,750
I can't ever make the final race.

894
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,230
I can't.

895
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,040
I can't...

896
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,020
Oh, I can slap the pink guys.

897
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,100
Why can't I never make the finals?

898
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,360
It's not fair.

899
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,260
I can't even join in.

900
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,250
I can't.

901
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,450
I hope Guilty has a very nice day.

902
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:48,330
And that he gets everything he ever wants in life.

903
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:54,010
And that when he goes to sleep, he wakes up the next morning.

904
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,910
Thanks for making me laugh, Guilty.

905
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,710
Of course, MonsterMV, thank you for the super chat.

906
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,390
Thank you, thank you.

907
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,890
I'm happy to brighten your day up.

908
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:13,470
I hope everybody has a wonderful time.

909
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,410
And enjoys their day.

910
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,110
What do you mean that's toxic?

911
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,550
I'm literally wishing him a nice day.

912
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,990
Oh, I can put on...

913
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,430
I can have glasses.

914
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,850
I can have glasses on now.

915
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,330
It's over.

916
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,730
I have glasses now.

917
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,030
Now I can actually see.

918
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,790
I hope he wakes up.

919
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,230
This is a threat.

920
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,830
It's not a threat.

921
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,930
I'm not threatening anybody.

922
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,610
I'm just wishing him to have a great, wonderful time.

923
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,170
God, you can have a guitar.

924
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,590
Wait, that's so cool.

925
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,570
What are the...

926
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,330
Wait, can I claim this?

927
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,190
Oh, this is the next one.

928
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,630
Okay, I have...

929
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,150
Oh, there's a guitar.

930
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:09,890
What's this?

931
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,130
Oh, what?

932
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,830
I can like...

933
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,690
I can like fire bend.

934
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,210
Wait, that's sweet.

935
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,830
I can be gold.

936
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,590
Wait, I want to be gold?

937
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,790
Wait, I...

938
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,590
What is this?

939
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,530
What is this?

940
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:33,210
I like how there's like penguins dancing in the background when you're looking through the...

941
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,530
When you're looking through the season pass.

942
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,450
Alright, I'm gonna go grab some water real quick.

943
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,250
I'll be right back, guys.

944
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,070
How

945
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,910
the heck do you guys have pineapples?

946
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,190
Isn't that expensive?

947
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,590
How long have you been playing, Mehdi?

948
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,050
How long have you been playing the game?

949
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,830
Like, how do you have this?

950
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,530
We farmed a lot.

951
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:39,870
Like, I'm like, the game came out yesterday night!

952
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,490
How do you have a pineapple?

953
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,570
I am a play tester.

954
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,230
These, like, the Japanese penguins are just like, what's going on?

955
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:03,910
The Japanese penguins are just looking at us and like, what's going on?

956
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,410
What's going on in the corner?

957
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,730
Alright, guys.

958
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,490
Dragoons, form a wall!

959
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,190
Oh my god, the Japanese penguin has like, it's like an ice cream!

960
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,910
Alright, Dragoons, form a wall!

961
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,170
You know what time it is!

962
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,030
It's for me to grab Alright.

963
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,090
You guys, guys, you have to wait for me, guys.

964
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,450
You guys failed the one thing.

965
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,050
You guys have to wait for me.

966
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:27,690
There you go.

967
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,330
Yeah!

968
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,130
Okay, come on.

969
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,330
No!

970
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,150
Not yet!

971
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,870
No, I missed.

972
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,950
Oh, no, I missed.

973
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:36,590
That's right.

974
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,050
Oh, I'm coming for you.

975
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,110
I'm coming for you.

976
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,170
That's right.

977
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,330
There we go.

978
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,890
Oh, wait, what?

979
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,790
What did I hit?

980
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,910
Somebody has been defeated?

981
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,590
You can die?

982
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,170
Like, what?

983
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,770
What do you mean they've been defeated?

984
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,410
Like, what?

985
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,070
I didn't realize they can actually lose.

986
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:03,770
Alright.

987
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,670
Who bumped me in the last second?

988
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,010
Alright, don't worry.

989
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,730
We're still okay.

990
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,170
This is like race number one.

991
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,790
Race number one is like the easiest.

992
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:19,930
If you like can't even get through race number one, maybe you're just not meant to be a racer.

993
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,570
You're just not meant to drive a penguin.

994
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,470
Alright, come on, please.

995
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,450
I just need two.

996
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,350
Guys, can you guys get closer?

997
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,330
Guys, please.

998
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,070
That's right.

999
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,630
That's right.

1000
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,830
Whoever bumped me, it's over for you.

1001
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,930
Get out of here.

1002
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,430
Whoever bumped me, it's...

1003
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,170
Oh, thank god we still made it.

1004
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,310
Oh, we still made it.

1005
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:42,870
That was close.

1006
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,230
Thank god I got the well inside.

1007
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,370
I could've said all that and actually got eliminated.

1008
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,970
Oh, thank god.

1009
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:50,830
Okay, we're fine.

1010
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,710
I did not get eliminated.

1011
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,790
I actually could've got eliminated.

1012
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,070
I said all that.

1013
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,190
But I didn't.

1014
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,070
Of course the ice cream penguin gets it.

1015
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,010
Like, you can tell he grinded that cosmetic for so long.

1016
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,390
That would... Yeah, but it didn't happen, guys.

1017
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,050
Guys, form a wall for real this time.

1018
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,990
Guys, form a wall and don't go until I slapped you.

1019
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,830
Okay?

1020
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:27,710
Dragoons.

1021
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,890
Form a... We must defeat the ice cream.

1022
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,090
We must defeat the ice cream penguin.

1023
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,890
That is our only hope.

1024
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,450
Thank you.

1025
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,750
Good dragoons listen to order.

1026
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,190
Yeah, that's right.

1027
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,930
My sardine.

1028
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1029
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,030
Okay, we're gonna grab another sardine.

1030
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,030
I feel like I could never get sardines at all.

1031
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,210
Like, everybody just keeps stealing sardines from me.

1032
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:57,970
Oh, okay.

1033
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,410
I didn't want to get slapped.

1034
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,730
I needed my personal space.

1035
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,070
No!

1036
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:03,930
No!

1037
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,470
Okay, everything's okay.

1038
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,370
No need to panic, Doki.

1039
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,510
We're all friends here.

1040
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,010
That's right.

1041
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:14,790
Get out.

1042
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:15,850
That's right.

1043
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,170
Get out.

1044
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:17,950
It's whale hour.

1045
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,390
That's right.

1046
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,810
It's whale hour.

1047
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:21,570
Oh my gosh.

1048
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,930
I thought I was gonna miss.

1049
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,310
Oh, and then... I defeated somebody.

1050
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,090
Wait!

1051
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,190
Get out of my game!

1052
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:28,690
No!

1053
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1054
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,650
No, no, come on.

1055
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:33,410
Stop!

1056
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,070
Stop!

1057
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:34,970
Please!

1058
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,910
You know what my skin is!

1059
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,450
You know that!

1060
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:39,290
Stop!

1061
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,250
Please!

1062
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,070
Please stop!

1063
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,090
Please!

1064
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,250
Okay.

1065
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,350
We're okay.

1066
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,470
We're okay.

1067
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,750
People are just...

1068
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,310
No, no, no!

1069
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:53,910
We're okay.

1070
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:54,550
We're okay.

1071
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,590
We just made it!

1072
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,430
We just made it!

1073
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,610
That's right!

1074
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,050
Yeah!

1075
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,410
You didn't make it!

1076
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,050
Yeah, that's right!

1077
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,310
You didn't make it!

1078
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,230
Yeah!

1079
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,090
Party!

1080
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,210
Get out of here!

1081
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,330
That's right.

1082
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:17,230
Whoa!

1083
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,610
What skin is that?

1084
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,250
What?

1085
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,050
That's a mecha paint!

1086
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,650
How did you become a mecha penguin?

1087
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,270
How did you become a mecha penguin?

1088
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,010
All right, guys.

1089
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:30,990
Get in front of me!

1090
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:31,190
All right, guys.

1091
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,190
Get in front of me!

1092
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,050
Dragoons!

1093
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,050
We're still in it!

1094
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:33,730
Form a wall!

1095
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,870
We have to defeat the ice cream...

1096
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,390
We have to defeat the ice cream...

1097
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,310
The ice cream!

1098
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:38,950
Form a wall!

1099
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:40,970
All right, there we go.

1100
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,290
Yeah, there we go.

1101
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:44,990
Watch you.

1102
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:45,690
Oh, no!

1103
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,210
Guys, we're working together so that I can win.

1104
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,030
Like...

1105
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:50,530
Guys!

1106
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,250
Guys!

1107
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,210
We're working together so I can win.

1108
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:54,850
Right, guys?

1109
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:56,950
There we go.

1110
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,170
Are you serious?

1111
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,070
That's so bull penguin!

1112
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,430
That's right.

1113
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,070
I'm going to beat you up because I'm angry now.

1114
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,870
I'm going to vent my frustrations onto you as a penguin.

1115
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,210
All right, there we go.

1116
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,250
Oh, I'm coming in for you.

1117
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,250
Okay, that was pretty sick.

1118
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,310
Oh, I can grab sardines as a whale!

1119
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,150
Uh-uh.

1120
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,650
All right, get out.

1121
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:21,650
Get out.

1122
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,150
All right.

1123
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,590
See, guys?

1124
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,770
I told you I'm PG.

1125
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,450
Wait!

1126
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:27,970
Oh!

1127
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,810
Where am I?

1128
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:31,630
That's right!

1129
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,830
Penguins are meant to fly!

1130
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,770
Oh, I don't know... No!

1131
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:41,710
That's right!

1132
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,630
Penguins are so meant to fly!

1133
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:46,370
That's right!

1134
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,470
That's right!

1135
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,050
I'm still correct, though.

1136
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,270
I'm still correct in my statement.

1137
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,130
I...

1138
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,250
No matter what, I'm still correct in what I say.

1139
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,110
No, are you serious?

1140
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:03,850
Okay.

1141
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,550
Oh, no.

1142
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,030
Oh, no.

1143
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:09,610
Nice.

1144
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,090
No!

1145
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,870
How did I get in front of me?

1146
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,830
How did I get in front of me?

1147
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:16,250
No!

1148
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:17,770
No!

1149
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:20,290
Fist!

1150
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:21,590
It's fine.

1151
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:22,610
It's fine.

1152
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,470
It's like the highest we've ever been.

1153
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,290
We were so close!

1154
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:31,610
We were so close, but we made it to the finals!

1155
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,190
We made it to the finals.

1156
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:37,650
Guys, guys, these guys...

1157
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,370
Get off your whale!

1158
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,650
How did you have your whale out?

1159
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,010
Put your whale back in!

1160
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,070
How did you have your whale out?

1161
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,190
How did you have your whale out?

1162
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:50,210
How did you have your whale out?

1163
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:50,490
How did you have your whale out?

1164
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:51,610
All right, guys.

1165
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,190
Dragons!

1166
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,410
I can see you guys are still here!

1167
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,830
Stand in front of me, dragons!

1168
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,110
We must defeat Ice Cream Penguin!

1169
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,270
And by we, I mean I.

1170
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:02,590
Dragons!

1171
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,410
That's right.

1172
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:04,090
There you go.

1173
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,610
Good dragons follow orders.

1174
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,830
Remember that.

1175
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,090
No!

1176
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:12,430
No!

1177
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,050
How did I miss?

1178
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:13,350
No!

1179
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,790
No!

1180
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:16,700
Please!

1181
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,440
What happened, dragons?

1182
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,260
I thought we were in this together!

1183
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,500
I thought we were in this together!

1184
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,480
I thought we were in this together!

1185
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:26,680
Stop!

1186
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,760
Guys, we have to work together!

1187
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,820
What?

1188
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,280
There's bombs!

1189
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,840
Since when were there bombs?

1190
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,420
That's messed up.

1191
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,980
That's so messed up!

1192
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,540
You stupid penguin!

1193
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,200
You dumb, dumb penguin!

1194
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,040
You dumb, dumb penguin!

1195
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,500
I bet...

1196
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,280
I bet other penguins don't like you.

1197
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,320
I bet other penguins don't like you.

1198
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,380
That's the best I can do.

1199
00:47:59,740 --> 00:47:59,960
That's the best I can do.

1200
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,960
To make sure I don't insult anybody.

1201
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,660
To make sure I don't insult anybody.

1202
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,480
I bet other penguins...

1203
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,380
I bet penguin bombs don't even like you.

1204
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,580
That's right.

1205
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,440
I said it.

1206
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,900
I goddamn said it.

1207
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,600
That's right.

1208
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,800
Oh my god, please.

1209
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,700
No!

1210
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,720
Please!

1211
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,340
Get him!

1212
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:18,740
Get him!

1213
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,320
Yes!

1214
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:20,740
Yes!

1215
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:21,940
Nice!

1216
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,840
That's right!

1217
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,920
I made it!

1218
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:25,960
I'm done!

1219
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,380
Damn, too far.

1220
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,520
We did it!

1221
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,880
We got in the finals!

1222
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,560
What the heck?

1223
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,600
What is that cosmetic?

1224
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,420
That's actually so badass.

1225
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,300
Where am I?

1226
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,260
Oh, there I am!

1227
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:49,820
You see me?

1228
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,700
I'm blowing the bubbles!

1229
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,680
Wait, I'm eighth!

1230
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,400
I'm eighth!

1231
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,260
That's right.

1232
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:57,720
Look at me.

1233
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,980
I'm blowing the bubbles.

1234
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,620
That's me.

1235
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,220
Hello.

1236
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,860
Oh my god, I'm gaming.

1237
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,320
We'll do one more public matchmaking and then we'll do custom lobbies.

1238
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,200
Nice.

1239
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,760
Yeah!

1240
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,400
Oh my god, I'm in pineapple!

1241
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,760
Wait, I'm novice now!

1242
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,380
Did I rank up?

1243
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,060
I'm gaming.

1244
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,220
See, in my third race I already made it to the finals.

1245
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,120
Wait, I can be a pineapple.

1246
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,020
Guys, to represent dragoons you all have to be the pineapple.

1247
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,220
Guys.

1248
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,940
Guys, to let me know you're a dragoon you gotta be a pineapple.

1249
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,320
Them's the rules.

1250
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,200
Alright.

1251
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:46,880
Alright.

1252
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,580
Now I can finally look at the...

1253
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,120
Is it in the season pass?

1254
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,420
Like, what is that?

1255
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,600
There's a volcano.

1256
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,560
Oh my god, you can be a god?

1257
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,080
You can be a little god.

1258
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,620
You can be a little god.

1259
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:00,820
Okay.

1260
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,920
I saw someone with this.

1261
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,300
That's a cool penguin.

1262
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,340
Oh, I want this!

1263
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,740
Wait.

1264
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,220
I really want this.

1265
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,160
This one's so cute.

1266
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,180
It's like a little ukulele.

1267
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,000
What about...

1268
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,860
Oh, and then there's like...

1269
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,460
Hula.

1270
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,360
Hula penguin.

1271
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,180
And then there's another goddess penguin.

1272
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,840
That's level 31.

1273
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,120
It can't be that difficult.

1274
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,380
Alright, nice.

1275
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:32,780
Alright.

1276
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,900
Now that I know which one's a dragoon.

1277
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,200
Now that I know everybody.

1278
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,260
Now that I know.

1279
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,300
If none of the pineapples make a wall for me in this race.

1280
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,080
I will know who you are and what your name is.

1281
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,700
If you don't make...

1282
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,920
If you don't make a wall.

1283
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,300
Can I see a pineapple?

1284
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,620
That is not a wall.

1285
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,620
I will know.

1286
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,960
Oh, yeah.

1287
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,200
Wait.

1288
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,860
I forgot to adjust the volume.

1289
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,340
Sorry.

1290
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,160
I got...

1291
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,040
I got too invested in the penguins.

1292
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,720
Oh, no.

1293
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,240
I can't...

1294
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,940
I can't change the... Okay.

1295
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,520
It's too late.

1296
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,100
We'll change the volume in the private.

1297
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,520
Sorry.

1298
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,040
I've been having too much fun.

1299
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,940
I forgot to change the volume.

1300
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:23,660
Wait.

1301
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:23,780
Sorry.

1302
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,820
Oh, they're slapping it.

1303
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,380
There's a lot of slapping to the volume.

1304
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,740
What's wrong with that?

1305
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
This is a slappy slap world here.

1306
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,440
Alright, guys.

1307
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,220
Pineapples.

1308
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,140
Pour me pineapple wall.

1309
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,180
Good dragoons fall over.

1310
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,220
Pour me pineapple wall.

1311
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,100
I know you're a pineapple now.

1312
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,100
Sir, what are you guys doing?

1313
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,800
What are your other pineapples doing?

1314
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,480
Pineapple wall!

1315
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,600
You get no excuse.

1316
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,400
You have no excuse if you don't form a pineapple wall.

1317
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,420
I literally can see you.

1318
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,140
I can see you're not forming a wall.

1319
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,920
That's right.

1320
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,040
Get over here, dragoons.

1321
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:11,800
I need a slap.

1322
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,520
Build that wall.

1323
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,360
I need the slap wall.

1324
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,040
Penguins aren't meant to be able to fly.

1325
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:21,780
Get down here.

1326
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,720
Oh, they're not pineapples.

1327
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,860
You are a pineapple!

1328
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,780
What are you doing?

1329
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,480
I am the main pineapple.

1330
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,560
I am OG pineapple.

1331
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,180
Stop!

1332
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,260
I am the pineapple leader.

1333
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,940
You can't slap the pineapple leader.

1334
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,460
Okay, nice.

1335
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,100
Okay, we just need one more.

1336
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,720
We just literally need one more.

1337
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,900
Get over here, you random guy.

1338
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,440
JK, I don't need you.

1339
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,900
I don't need anybody.

1340
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,940
I got my whale.

1341
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,000
There's like another...

1342
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,980
You can get like a free floaty.

1343
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,040
But like, I think the whale's cuter.

1344
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,900
Not gonna lie.

1345
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,860
I honestly... That's right.

1346
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,860
Good dragoons let me slap.

1347
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,380
That's right.

1348
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:04,820
Get over here.

1349
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,300
No, no, no.

1350
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,320
No, don't get over here.

1351
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,100
That's right.

1352
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,520
Get over here.

1353
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:07,860
Get over here.

1354
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,100
No!

1355
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,040
Are you serious?

1356
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,180
Oh, please.

1357
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,720
Please.

1358
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,540
Oh, we're still in.

1359
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,020
We're still in.

1360
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:15,720
Okay, nice.

1361
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,980
Never failed the first round.

1362
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,720
Alright.

1363
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,100
Pineapples!

1364
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,940
Why didn't all of you form a wall of pineapples?

1365
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,060
What is your excuse?

1366
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,500
Guys, guys, we can't let...

1367
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,080
Guys, we can't let a non-pineapple win.

1368
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,420
Guys.

1369
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,200
Down with this penguin!

1370
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,740
Good dragoons.

1371
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,400
Let me slap.

1372
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:47,580
Alright.

1373
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,400
Pineapples!

1374
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,380
Get in front!

1375
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,720
All the pineapples get in front of me right now!

1376
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,200
Form that wall!

1377
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,380
That is not in...

1378
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,920
Guys, that is not in front of me.

1379
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,220
Guys, guys...

1380
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:00,940
Guys,

1381
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,080
please.

1382
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:05,940
Please.

1383
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,780
It was a very simple instructions.

1384
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,340
I don't understand why we can't form a...

1385
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,960
A horizontal line of pineapples.

1386
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,800
I...

1387
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,160
No!

1388
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:17,740
It's okay.

1389
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,380
I got the glider.

1390
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,900
I'll fly over all of you.

1391
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,360
They're doing a mosh pit.

1392
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,860
It's alright.

1393
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,880
I don't need you guys.

1394
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,180
I'm in first place.

1395
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,440
Whoever...

1396
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:31,620
Whoever...

1397
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,200
Did that thing where they tried to...

1398
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,300
Sabotage me.

1399
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,640
And kick me off.

1400
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,380
That's right.

1401
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,040
I bet you regret that now.

1402
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,580
Don't you?

1403
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,820
I bet you regret that.

1404
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,660
Now I'm...

1405
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,000
I got the paraglider because of it.

1406
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:47,800
Oh no.

1407
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,120
Okay.

1408
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,700
We're in the final stretch.

1409
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:50,600
Please.

1410
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,200
I don't have any sardines.

1411
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,420
Where are the sardines?

1412
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,180
No, no, no.

1413
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:57,720
Come on.

1414
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,480
Pass me the sardines.

1415
00:54:59,560 --> 00:54:59,780
No!

1416
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,240
No!

1417
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,120
Please!

1418
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,820
Why are you taking my sardines?

1419
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,680
I have nothing!

1420
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,940
Oh my god.

1421
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,560
You penguin.

1422
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,220
You god damn penguin.

1423
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,340
You...

1424
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,940
I made it.

1425
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,980
I made it.

1426
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,800
God damn fish.

1427
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,420
You're not even a penguin.

1428
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,440
You're a fish.

1429
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,300
You're beneath me.

1430
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,720
You're a god damn fish.

1431
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,820
Fish get consumed.

1432
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,060
They have the brain cell of a...

1433
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,000
Of a rock.

1434
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,680
Okay.

1435
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,160
That's good.

1436
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:36,520
That's good.

1437
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,100
We have a...

1438
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,040
We have a pineapple to represent us.

1439
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,140
A delicious pineapple.

1440
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,980
You can't say that.

1441
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,500
Alright.

1442
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,400
Pineapples.

1443
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,660
We'll do this.

1444
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,600
We'll try this again.

1445
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,240
Guys.

1446
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,160
Pineapples.

1447
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,800
Wall.

1448
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,000
Pineapple.

1449
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,900
Wall.

1450
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,620
I see you guys are not for me.

1451
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,660
I give up.

1452
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,780
Good dragoons just deserve to get slapped.

1453
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,100
That's right.

1454
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,580
I said it.

1455
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,140
Your duty is just to get slapped, dragoons.

1456
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,820
That's right.

1457
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,260
This is a non-pineapple.

1458
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,280
I'm going to get you.

1459
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,620
I got your license plate.

1460
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,680
I got your license plate, Mr. Yellow.

1461
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,620
That's right.

1462
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,580
I got it.

1463
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,800
You penguin.

1464
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,680
You fish.

1465
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,780
You god damn...

1466
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,200
Father loving fish.

1467
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,040
I tried so hard.

1468
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:41,400
I'm trying so hard to be PG.

1469
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,260
This guy just really likes fish.

1470
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,620
That's really it.

1471
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,500
There's nothing else.

1472
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,120
I'm the good person.

1473
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,900
He just really loves fish.

1474
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:54,660
I don't know.

1475
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,200
Alright.

1476
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,920
That's right.

1477
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,120
You're going to regret this.

1478
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,560
You're going to regret all of this.

1479
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,320
That's...

1480
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:07,980
No.

1481
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,640
That's not fair.

1482
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,340
That's actually not fair.

1483
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,080
What?

1484
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,080
How did I mess that up?

1485
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,760
It's not fair.

1486
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,020
Please.

1487
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,380
Please.

1488
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:22,860
Please.

1489
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,580
Please.

1490
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,400
I just need... I need...

1491
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,400
Hang in there.

1492
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,720
I'm hanging in.

1493
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,120
Oh.

1494
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,600
What do you mean?

1495
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,280
People are already placing.

1496
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,320
No.

1497
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,940
Don't get out.

1498
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,520
Get out.

1499
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,100
Please.

1500
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,640
Oh.

1501
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:40,960
I made it.

1502
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:41,600
Nice.

1503
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,300
That's it.

1504
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:44,800
That's it.

1505
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:45,880
You fishes.

1506
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:46,900
That's right.

1507
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,360
That's right.

1508
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,400
Pineapples.

1509
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,260
We're slowly eliminating the non-pineapples.

1510
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:56,780
Let's go.

1511
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,060
Let's go.

1512
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,320
Get rid of all the pineapples.

1513
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,060
Pineapple supreme.

1514
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,580
Not even close.

1515
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,820
You mother fishes.

1516
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:18,920
Alright.

1517
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:19,440
There you go.

1518
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,140
No.

1519
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,460
I got fishes.

1520
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:22,800
Okay.

1521
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,440
I got...

1522
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,820
I got the slaps in time.

1523
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,660
I got it in time.

1524
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,400
Please don't slap me.

1525
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:27,640
Please.

1526
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:27,840
No.

1527
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,320
Please.

1528
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,460
We have to work together.

1529
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,760
We're pineapple together strong.

1530
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,620
Please pineapple together.

1531
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:33,880
Yeah.

1532
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,140
That's right.

1533
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,820
I can slap though.

1534
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,720
Pineapple together strong guys.

1535
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Remember that.

1536
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,480
We have to work together against the non-pineapples.

1537
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,320
Let's go.

1538
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,040
Guys.

1539
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,120
Remember we are friends.

1540
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,160
We are pineapple friends.

1541
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,600
Pineapple strong.

1542
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:53,940
Pineapple strong.

1543
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,140
Pineapple strong.

1544
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,240
Pineapple strong.

1545
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,100
Pineapple strong.

1546
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,120
Pineapple strong.

1547
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,380
Pineapple strong.

1548
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,540
Pineapple strong.

1549
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,840
Pineapple strong.

1550
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,360
Pineapple strong.

1551
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,000
Pineapple strong.

1552
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,780
Pineapple strong.

1553
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,540
Pineapple strong.

1554
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,680
Pineapple strong.

1555
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,320
Pineapple strong.

1556
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1557
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,740
Got you.

1558
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,960
I got you.

1559
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,260
I see you.

1560
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,960
Come on.

1561
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1562
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,760
3, 4, 5.

1563
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,240
I made it.

1564
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,300
Nice goal.

1565
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,420
We made it to the final race.

1566
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,400
We've always made it to the final race.

1567
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,000
That's right!

1568
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,580
We always...

1569
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,100
We always made it to the race.

1570
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,380
At the very end.

1571
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,900
Because we're gamers.

1572
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:48,240
Gamers.

1573
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,380
I'm in.

1574
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,440
Let's go!

1575
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,160
That's right!

1576
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,600
Pineapple Sweep!

1577
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,280
Let's go!

1578
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,400
Wait, I don't even...

1579
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,680
Wait, I don't think they're even part of the crew.

1580
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:12,960
I think they just...

1581
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,030
I don't know.

1582
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,890
Are they part of the crew?

1583
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:18,810
I can't tell.

1584
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,870
What if they're in their own crew?

1585
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:22,830
Like...

1586
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,230
I'm like...

1587
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,750
Wait, I don't know.

1588
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:28,270
I don't know if this guy is...

1589
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,330
This guy is part of the pineapple crew.

1590
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,310
I knew it.

1591
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,070
Oh my god.

1592
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:47,670
The pineapple reigns supreme.

1593
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,450
Nice.

1594
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:51,390
Yay!

1595
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,430
I ranked up!

1596
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:55,250
Goodbye, peasants.

1597
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:55,730
Hahaha.

1598
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,230
Hahaha.

1599
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,210
Talk to me when you...

1600
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,750
Talk to me when...

1601
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,010
When...

1602
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:05,950
I can be...

1603
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:06,610
Guys, okay.

1604
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,470
To be...

1605
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:10,730
To be a dragon.

1606
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:12,970
To represent the dragons.

1607
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,810
We all have to be...

1608
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,110
Red pineapples.

1609
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,210
That's like...

1610
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,910
Wait, I can change the color?

1611
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,530
Oh, I can!

1612
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:25,770
Wait, that's so cute!

1613
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,150
Wait, I want this color.

1614
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,350
I want this color.

1615
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:31,470
Alright.

1616
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,770
To represent the dragons...

1617
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,050
You gotta be a red...

1618
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:36,530
The red is like...

1619
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,110
The color of winners.

1620
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:40,050
And then a pineapple.

1621
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:42,250
Alright.

1622
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,410
It's like a tomato, exactly.

1623
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,910
It's like a tomato within a...

1624
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,170
Within a pineapple.

1625
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:49,070
So like, that is how...

1626
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,190
That's how we know that you're a dragon.

1627
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,210
Oh my god, I can change it!

1628
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:54,430
I wanna be blue!

1629
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,610
I wanna be blue!

1630
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,510
Alright, wait, I wanna...

1631
01:01:58,510 --> 01:01:59,110
Okay, let's...

1632
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,530
Let's fix the volume.

1633
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,890
I keep forgetting to...

1634
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,390
Sound guy, is there anything I need to fix?

1635
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,890
Or is everything good?

1636
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:10,750
Just kinda bring down...

1637
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,110
And music bring up...

1638
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,430
And bring up overall.

1639
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:16,290
Is there anything I have to fix, sound guy?

1640
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,530
The music...

1641
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,130
I like how...

1642
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:21,910
It's always...

1643
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:24,290
It's always Doug that's like, please...

1644
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,210
Turn down the music.

1645
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:31,010
It's always him...

1646
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,930
That's trying to turn down...

1647
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,110
I'm gonna turn it up now.

1648
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:37,450
I'm gonna turn...

1649
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:40,030
Please...

1650
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,090
Alright...

1651
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,270
Alright...

1652
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,570
Alright, guys, we'll do one more public match.

1653
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,970
Cause I wanna see how many dragoons are in the lobby.

1654
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,450
Alright, guys...

1655
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,410
Alright, guys, remember...

1656
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:03,030
Red penguin with pineapple suit.

1657
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,130
Guys...

1658
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:06,470
Guys, remember...

1659
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,310
Red penguin in a pineapple suit.

1660
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:10,530
Red penguin in a pineapple suit.

1661
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,670
What other skins do they have?

1662
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:13,430
What other skins do they have?

1663
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:15,530
Alright...

1664
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,090
Let's see...

1665
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:17,950
Okay, we got here.

1666
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,390
Wait, how...

1667
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,570
How do they get the...

1668
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,510
The other...

1669
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,290
Okay, money, money, money...

1670
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:27,810
Wait, how do they get the other penguin?

1671
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,150
You saw that other...

1672
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,470
Wait, was it from the shop?

1673
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:32,530
Does the shop rotate?

1674
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,530
Wait, I think...

1675
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:36,250
I really like the burger penguin.

1676
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,870
How do they get the...

1677
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:42,430
Oh, it's an achievement?

1678
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,910
Oh, maybe it's an achievement.

1679
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:46,650
Alright, how many?

1680
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,930
Wait...

1681
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,210
Oh, okay, I was like...

1682
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,130
I was like, wait a minute.

1683
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:53,650
Alright, guys, alright.

1684
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,570
Alright, the red penguin...

1685
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,670
Okay, you guys just haven't locked the red penguin yet.

1686
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:58,990
I see.

1687
01:03:59,150 --> 01:03:59,930
Alright, that's good.

1688
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:00,290
That's fine.

1689
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,930
Alright, we have our dragoon army.

1690
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,810
We will take over this lobby.

1691
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,210
We will...

1692
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,630
Get rid of all these normie penguins out of here.

1693
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,090
This is pineapple land.

1694
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:13,830
This is pineapple land.

1695
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:14,950
This is pineapple land.

1696
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:15,570
That's right.

1697
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:16,230
Whoops, goodbye.

1698
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,230
That's right.

1699
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,330
That's right.

1700
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:24,590
Slap to commemorate our time here.

1701
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:27,390
Remember who you are, dragoons.

1702
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:31,290
Long live the pineapple.

1703
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,550
We

1704
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,180
will reign supreme in pineapple land.

1705
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,220
This is pineapple territory.

1706
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,800
Slap.

1707
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,300
We welcome each other, guys.

1708
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,340
We welcome each other by slapping.

1709
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,480
This is the pineapple way.

1710
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,960
Slap the homies.

1711
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,500
Alright, nice.

1712
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,000
That's right.

1713
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,100
There's way too many non-pineapples.

1714
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,000
We gotta make sure they lose the race.

1715
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,780
We gotta make sure they can't win.

1716
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,860
Only the pineapple shall win.

1717
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,080
That's right.

1718
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,200
Get out of here.

1719
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,880
Sorry, it's for the greater good.

1720
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,980
I need to use you to win.

1721
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,800
Whoa, wait, this is a new map.

1722
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,460
Wait, the cloud's pretty cool.

1723
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,080
It's for the greater good.

1724
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,180
Mother pineapples, I need to slap you so I can be in the lead.

1725
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,290
Alright, thank you.

1726
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:47,090
I don't think that was intentional.

1727
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:50,030
He just landed next to me.

1728
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:50,930
It's alright.

1729
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,390
No, I missed!

1730
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:55,750
No!

1731
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,370
No, I missed.

1732
01:05:58,510 --> 01:05:59,950
I'm not gonna get that now.

1733
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:00,770
Guys, please.

1734
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:02,210
Yes, thank you.

1735
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:09,310
I think I slapped the majority of the penguins I slapped have been the pineapple penguins.

1736
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:13,110
Like, it wasn't even intentional.

1737
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,770
They just, all of them were just in front of me.

1738
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,330
They were all just in front of me.

1739
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:19,770
Oh, Kira.

1740
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,070
You're next, Kira.

1741
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:22,050
You're next.

1742
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:22,990
I'm coming to get ya.

1743
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,850
I'm coming to get ya.

1744
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,010
No!

1745
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:28,350
Guys!

1746
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,530
Slow down!

1747
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,630
Slow down!

1748
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,670
Please.

1749
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:35,730
Please!

1750
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,170
Please!

1751
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:42,390
Okay, guys, I think this might be the first race I don't make it.

1752
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:43,810
Guys, remember me.

1753
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,030
Guys, remember me.

1754
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,710
Remember me.

1755
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:48,970
Haha, JK.

1756
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:50,210
No!

1757
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,870
Wait, I think I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna make it!

1758
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:57,410
I think, guys, guys, please, please, please!

1759
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:59,430
No, there's no way!

1760
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:00,350
No!

1761
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:03,190
Wait, no, I still made it!

1762
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,870
You can't block me!

1763
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,030
No!

1764
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:06,990
No!

1765
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,140
No!

1766
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,280
Remember me!

1767
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,400
No!

1768
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,240
No!

1769
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,440
Get back here!

1770
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,640
I'm leaving.

1771
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,520
I can't...

1772
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,380
I can't believe it.

1773
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,560
I can't teach.

1774
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,600
So messed up.

1775
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,680
I can't show.

1776
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:46,980
Only a non-gamer would win the burn series.

1777
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:51,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1778
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,740
Thank you, thank you.

1779
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,760
Sorry, my monitor was turned off, guys.

1780
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,740
I was going by pure sound alone.

1781
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,180
Hey, guys, I don't know if you noticed, but I was going by pure sound.

1782
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,100
So, like, what happened?

1783
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:06,900
Oh my god.

1784
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:07,960
Is that not me?

1785
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,500
That's unfortunate.

1786
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,020
Oh my god.

1787
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,680
You see, this is why you shouldn't be too overconfident.

1788
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:22,480
Because I was going by pure... I had my monitor turned off, guys.

1789
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,320
So, you know, it's just so unlucky.

1790
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,240
It's just so unlucky that my monitor was off.

1791
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,280
I wonder what achievement you can get for clothes.

1792
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,740
Oh, wait, what?

1793
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,720
Reach season rank ace?

1794
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,040
Oh, I guess these are like the competitive rewards.

1795
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,300
That's pretty cool.

1796
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,060
How did they get that?

1797
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,980
Maybe that was from like beta testers.

1798
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:52,820
Oh, wait, what?

1799
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,640
Achieve first place in a tour?

1800
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,420
Guys, does private lobbies count?

1801
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,640
You can actually still play if you dropped out.

1802
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,760
It's not just spectating.

1803
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:01,580
No, that's fine.

1804
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,780
If I'm dropped out, this lobby does not deserve my prize.

1805
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,080
The lobby just didn't deserve me.

1806
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,520
It's called self-care.

1807
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,960
It's called self-care.

1808
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,460
The lobby didn't deserve me.

1809
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,640
Damn facts.

1810
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,260
Okay.

1811
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,280
Care for yourself.

1812
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,480
Treat yourself.

1813
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:41,900
Know your place.

1814
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,700
Guys, what happened to the...

1815
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,860
Guys, are all my dragoons in the other lobby still?

1816
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,580
Guys, what happened?

1817
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,040
No!

1818
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:51,520
Dragoons!

1819
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,440
Okay, no.

1820
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,640
You're not red.

1821
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:54,980
Why aren't you red?

1822
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,520
You can't just say that.

1823
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:57,900
You can't ask them why they're not red.

1824
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,860
Guys, I told you guys.

1825
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:03,440
You have to be red to be part of...

1826
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,540
to enlist in the dragoon army.

1827
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,420
You gotta be red, guys.

1828
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,720
Alright, sorry.

1829
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,260
We'll do...

1830
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,220
I can't help it.

1831
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,060
I really like...

1832
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,540
The matchmaking has been really fun.

1833
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,640
Custom lobbies after this.

1834
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,340
For real.

1835
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:20,300
For real.

1836
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,100
Custom lobby after this.

1837
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:26,500
Sorry.

1838
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:27,380
After this.

1839
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:27,560
After this.

1840
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,320
Alright.

1841
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,660
Guys, there's not a lot of us.

1842
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,800
Guys, so we have to make do.

1843
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,600
We will still convert this lobby into pineapples.

1844
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,400
Okay.

1845
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:47,380
There's...

1846
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:47,760
Oh, no.

1847
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,140
I just slapped him for fun.

1848
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:49,660
No!

1849
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,320
No, I messed up!

1850
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,360
No, please, please!

1851
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,120
I messed up!

1852
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:56,780
I slapped too early!

1853
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,300
I got too overzealous!

1854
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,100
I got so overzealous!

1855
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,340
I was like, Slap!

1856
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,560
I saw another pineapple and I couldn't help it!

1857
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,920
Not last anymore!

1858
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,260
Who said that?

1859
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,060
Which penguin?

1860
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,900
Which penguin said that?

1861
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,960
Turkey, why did you say penguin like that?

1862
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,280
I'm just saying penguin.

1863
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

1864
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,300
Nice.

1865
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,100
Okay, we got it.

1866
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,780
We obtained a 250.

1867
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:33,780
Nice.

1868
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,640
Guys, what's wrong with DG Gaming?

1869
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,140
Isn't that somebody's monitor?

1870
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:44,920
Okay.

1871
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,180
We're fine.

1872
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:48,800
Things are still looking good.

1873
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,160
Things are still looking good for Doki.

1874
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,620
For Doki.

1875
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,540
Doki bird.

1876
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:54,940
Doki penguin.

1877
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:56,280
Okay.

1878
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,440
Let's get over here.

1879
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,560
That's right.

1880
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,980
You should've got the... should've got the...

1881
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,420
Well, you should've got...

1882
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,140
TG Gamer Pro.

1883
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,060
Oh, I'm second!

1884
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,920
Let's go.

1885
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,320
Let's go.

1886
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,340
It's that penguin.

1887
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,560
Goddamn mother fish loving penguin right there.

1888
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,380
Not like us pineapples.

1889
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:24,620
Yeah!

1890
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:28,760
Wait!

1891
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:29,640
Wait!

1892
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,650
That's me!

1893
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:33,650
Guys!

1894
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,890
That's me!

1895
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,150
That's me up there.

1896
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:43,710
Oh my god.

1897
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:47,630
If you close your eyes, if you look down and don't see the name, it's technically me.

1898
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,830
It's technically me.

1899
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,190
That's me!

1900
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:56,290
Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

1901
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:56,750
Slap time.

1902
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:57,150
Slap time.

1903
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:57,350
No!

1904
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,250
I missed the...

1905
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:58,790
What?

1906
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:01,590
Guys, what happened?

1907
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:05,910
Guys, what happened to standing in front of me so I can also be part of the crew?

1908
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:06,690
Like...

1909
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:09,030
What happened?

1910
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,630
I thought we were a team, guys.

1911
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,670
Guys, guys, there's not a lot of us.

1912
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:17,110
Guys, guys, there's not a lot of other pineapple penguins, guys.

1913
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:18,370
We gotta work together.

1914
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,970
Pineapples together strong, guys.

1915
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:23,730
Remember, pineapple together strong.

1916
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:24,890
We have to...

1917
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:26,310
We don't work together.

1918
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:27,070
What will we have?

1919
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:27,530
Nothing.

1920
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,910
We'll have nothing.

1921
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,530
The non-pineapples will win.

1922
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,110
And you don't want that.

1923
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:34,690
That's right.

1924
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:36,770
Nice.

1925
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:37,630
Nice.

1926
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:37,890
No!

1927
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:39,710
Not nice!

1928
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:41,590
That's right.

1929
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:41,810
Nice.

1930
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,610
Alright, we're good.

1931
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:43,970
We're good.

1932
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,490
And I got the whale, too.

1933
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:48,290
I got the whale at the end.

1934
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:50,010
We're so good right now.

1935
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,230
We're so good.

1936
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:51,790
That's right.

1937
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,090
Oh, we're up there.

1938
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:54,650
We're up there.

1939
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:58,230
It feels like you can, like, catch up.

1940
01:13:58,910 --> 01:13:59,330
What?

1941
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,690
Where did these guys come from?

1942
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,230
Where did those people behind me come from?

1943
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:09,570
It feels like even though you can be last, you can catch up really, like, easily.

1944
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:11,790
We're still here.

1945
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:12,350
That's right.

1946
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,430
Who can't make it?

1947
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:15,430
Look at you.

1948
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,150
Look at you, bros.

1949
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:20,230
That's right.

1950
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:22,910
Should have enlisted to the dragoon army.

1951
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:27,490
That's right.

1952
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,370
Another pineapple!

1953
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:29,490
That's me!

1954
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,350
That's me!

1955
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:31,530
But what if she's red?

1956
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:32,710
That's me, guys!

1957
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,690
That's me!

1958
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,230
Oh my god!

1959
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:36,150
Yeah!

1960
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:45,990
That's also me!

1961
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:47,610
Alright, guys.

1962
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,870
Guys, we weren't able to, like, form a pineapple.

1963
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,390
How many non-pineapples are still in the lobby?

1964
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:53,770
We gotta get rid of them.

1965
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:56,270
We gotta make sure they don't make it to the finals.

1966
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:57,990
We have to make it all pineapple.

1967
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:58,590
No!

1968
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:02,830
Guys!

1969
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:04,010
Guys, wait up!

1970
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,170
Guys!

1971
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:06,690
Guys, wait up!

1972
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:07,410
Guys, please!

1973
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:09,670
Guys, wait up!

1974
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:16,130
We have to make sure all the, all the pineapples make it together, guys!

1975
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:20,510
We gotta make sure that it's all pineapple.

1976
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:26,710
How was I supposed to know that was gonna happen, chat?

1977
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:31,470
Like, that was so full penguin!

1978
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:35,650
That was actually so messed up.

1979
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:38,050
It was so fished up, guys.

1980
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,110
You don't understand.

1981
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:44,210
That was the most fished thing I've ever seen.

1982
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:51,270
That's so messed up.

1983
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,910
I'm missing all the sardine!

1984
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:57,290
It's not even worth it!

1985
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,790
There's so many sardines!

1986
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:00,710
There's so many sardines there!

1987
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:01,530
No!

1988
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,790
I got confused!

1989
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,070
I got confused!

1990
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:13,350
It confused me!

1991
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:15,450
I'm so sad!

1992
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:17,510
Guys, please!

1993
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:18,750
Have mercy!

1994
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,330
I need some sardines!

1995
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:22,330
Please!

1996
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:24,070
Oh, no!

1997
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,990
The final stretch!

1998
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:27,370
No!

1999
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:28,070
Yes!

2000
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:28,670
Okay!

2001
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:30,750
I can slap this one!

2002
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:31,610
Yes!

2003
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:31,910
Okay!

2004
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,730
I can slap another one!

2005
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,230
But I don't need to!

2006
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:36,450
I'll just do this!

2007
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:38,290
Oh, I made it!

2008
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:38,930
I made it!

2009
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:40,050
Pineapples!

2010
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,130
My brethren!

2011
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:42,370
Who's this guy?

2012
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:42,910
Get him out!

2013
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:43,790
Get him out!

2014
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:45,750
Get him out!

2015
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:48,470
Who are these non-pineapples?

2016
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,030
What a combat!

2017
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,170
That's a non-pineapple!

2018
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,490
How did you guys let this happen?

2019
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:00,730
How did you let Draegen take this?

2020
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,510
How did you let Draegen take this?

2021
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,910
Get him out!

2022
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,910
He has a target on his back!

2023
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:06,550
If you see a penguin with green hair, get him out of here!

2024
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:10,530
If you see a penguin with green hair, get him out of here!

2025
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:12,370
What a recovery!

2026
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:12,770
What a recovery!

2027
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:13,090
Alright!

2028
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:17,530
We need to make sure this guy has nothing in his life after this!

2029
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:17,810
We need to make sure this guy has nothing in his life after this!

2030
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,870
But, like, in-game!

2031
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:20,770
In-game, guys!

2032
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:21,370
In-game!

2033
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:23,710
Guys, please!

2034
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,790
Guys, please!

2035
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,030
Guys, please!

2036
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:34,370
Guys, why do they keep doing this to me?

2037
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:35,290
Why?

2038
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:38,330
Why do they keep doing this to me?

2039
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:40,170
This is not fair!

2040
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:41,450
Azzy, please let me slap you!

2041
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,230
I swear to God, please!

2042
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:46,050
Let me not hang in there!

2043
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,050
Bro, that's so...

2044
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:50,530
That's so messed up!

2045
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,890
Hang in there!

2046
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:53,230
Let me...

2047
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:58,630
You got this, turkey!

2048
01:17:58,730 --> 01:17:59,890
Just hang in there!

2049
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:00,410
Just...

2050
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:02,010
No!

2051
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:04,130
Just hang in there!

2052
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,630
That's right.

2053
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,130
Remember who you...

2054
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:09,950
Remember turkey?

2055
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,650
This was her in high school.

2056
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,370
Now look at her.

2057
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,510
As she bumps into everything.

2058
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:17,790
Oh, okay.

2059
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:18,670
Nice.

2060
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:19,310
Okay, I got it.

2061
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:20,610
That's fine.

2062
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:21,210
I got it.

2063
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:22,310
We're okay.

2064
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:23,850
We're okay.

2065
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:25,490
I think it's only Tommy in first.

2066
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,410
No!

2067
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:27,630
Alright, that's fine.

2068
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:27,970
That's fine.

2069
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:30,390
That's first place.

2070
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:31,550
That's all that matters, guys.

2071
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:33,110
That's all that matters.

2072
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,350
Please, please.

2073
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:36,530
No, I missed!

2074
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2075
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:39,630
Yes, guys, guys!

2076
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:40,730
Yes!

2077
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:41,750
Oh my God!

2078
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:42,070
Nice!

2079
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:42,970
I made it!

2080
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:44,170
Wait!

2081
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:45,590
No, that's... No, they're pineapples!

2082
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:46,890
Wait!

2083
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:47,290
No!

2084
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:55,640
No!

2085
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:57,980
I fell...

2086
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,870
It's okay.

2087
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:02,690
It's okay.

2088
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:03,930
We got it, fellow dragon.

2089
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:04,310
It's okay.

2090
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:05,990
We got it.

2091
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:07,850
Two out of three.

2092
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:08,870
That's alright.

2093
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:12,430
Good job on your computer.

2094
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,990
Get this drinkin' out of here.

2095
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,270
Let's get two out of three.

2096
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,230
Two out of three.

2097
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:22,850
I'll take those.

2098
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:23,890
I'll take those.

2099
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:28,990
Alright.

2100
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:30,890
Custom lobby for real now.

2101
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:32,250
I'm sorry.

2102
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,970
I got too invested in the rank system.

2103
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,950
I think this game has been pretty fun.

2104
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:37,650
Not gonna lie.

2105
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:38,890
This game.

2106
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:45,830
For those who don't know, the points builds up into how many points you get in your ranking.

2107
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:51,990
Obviously, you guys saw Novice, Ordinary, Best in the Village, Pro, Top Notch, A-Star.

2108
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,390
That's obviously the rank mode.

2109
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,970
The more points you get, the higher ranking you are.

2110
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:01,130
I'm Ordinary rank right now.

2111
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:02,230
I'm Ordinary rank right now.

2112
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:02,910
Ordinary rank.

2113
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:06,530
So I got two of these medals and that adds up the totals too.

2114
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:10,530
The medals give you more ranking power too.

2115
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:13,770
The more medals you get, the higher rank you get.

2116
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:16,050
Are you grinding?

2117
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,510
I'm just ordinary.

2118
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:20,070
I'm just an ordinary penguin.

2119
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:24,770
Also, they're gonna add more courses in the future.

2120
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:28,410
There's a lot of courses so far too.

2121
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:29,390
Alright.

2122
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:30,750
For real guys.

2123
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:31,550
For real.

2124
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,170
We're gonna...

2125
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,690
We're gonna have private lobbies this time.

2126
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:37,550
Alright.

2127
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:39,010
Create room.

2128
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:40,250
Alright guys.

2129
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:43,070
Guys, you guys all have to put on the pineapple though.

2130
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:45,370
Alright, this is the...

2131
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:47,010
This is the lobby code.

2132
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,370
I'll copy it too.

2133
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:56,190
I think the fact that it's like a battle royale system makes it fun.

2134
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:01,150
How the fuck are you pro?

2135
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,110
I mean how?

2136
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:03,530
Sorry.

2137
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,800
How the fish are you pro?

2138
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:09,840
Sorry.

2139
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,800
That like surprised me.

2140
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,440
I was like...

2141
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,580
Do I have 40?

2142
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,680
I can't tell.

2143
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:25,860
I got started.

2144
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,720
I got started.

2145
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,340
You guys got me.

2146
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:31,220
Are you pro?

2147
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,340
Okay.

2148
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:37,660
How the flip did you get it?

2149
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,260
It got me off guard.

2150
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:44,640
It got me off guard.

2151
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,060
It got me off guard.

2152
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,580
It got me off guard.

2153
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,560
Alright, nice.

2154
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,020
You're happy cat?

2155
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:52,140
Okay.

2156
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,760
Alright, nice.

2157
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,840
Guys, let's all have pineapples later on.

2158
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,000
I wanna have a full pineapple lobby.

2159
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,780
I love it, bud.

2160
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:01,880
Slap.

2161
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:06,920
Give your pen bro a slap for good luck, everybody.

2162
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,880
To commemorate our first private lobby, we all have to slap each other.

2163
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,280
Good job.

2164
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,260
Good job.

2165
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,220
Good job.

2166
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:14,540
Good job.

2167
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,100
Guys, remember this is free to play.

2168
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,980
So you can download the game right now to join the private lobbies, guys.

2169
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,120
The custom lobbies.

2170
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,900
You can literally download the game right now.

2171
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:24,980
It's free to play.

2172
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:28,120
The link is in my description and pinned.

2173
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,340
Pinned in chat.

2174
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,820
Slap, slap, slap.

2175
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,340
Everybody gets free slaps.

2176
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,060
Slap, slap.

2177
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,460
This is how we say hello in penguin country.

2178
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,400
How's the volume anyway?

2179
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,740
I hope it's not too loud.

2180
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,260
I hope the slapping is not too loud.

2181
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,140
I hope it's not too overpowering.

2182
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:07,740
I hope it's not too overpowering.

2183
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:08,820
Alright.

2184
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,880
It slaps louder.

2185
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,980
The slaps need to be louder.

2186
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,420
It definitely needs to be louder.

2187
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,780
I messed up guys!

2188
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:25,020
Please!

2189
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,500
This is my private lobby!

2190
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,020
NYS, get out of here!

2191
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:31,560
torn sound I keep messing it up!

2192
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:33,580
It's okay.

2193
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,960
We can recover.

2194
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,380
We can recover.

2195
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:37,240
I believe.

2196
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,980
Nice that I needed that.

2197
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I got the paraglider.

2198
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,120
I'm out of my groove!

2199
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:52,570
I got the paraglider!はじめ Please.

2200
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,430
Please, I'm just a little guy.

2201
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:55,770
Oh my god!

2202
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:56,990
He was a dragon!

2203
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:00,510
The guy that got second earlier!

2204
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:02,890
In our other lobby, in the public lobby.

2205
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,610
Oh my god, please, guys.

2206
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:08,390
Please, I'm literally the... guys, I'm literally the lobby leader.

2207
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:10,470
You can't let me get knocked down, guys.

2208
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:12,630
You can't knock me out.

2209
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:14,830
I'm the lobby leader.

2210
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,710
I have to be part of the lobby!

2211
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:19,910
Because I don't want to be affecting you guys!

2212
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:26,690
I want to play the game.

2213
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,790
Why are you taking all the 13?

2214
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:30,890
It's fine.

2215
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:32,810
It's fine.

2216
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,370
Get out of the way.

2217
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,250
That's right.

2218
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:37,070
Oh, I made it.

2219
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:37,870
Oh, thank god.

2220
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:39,830
I made it.

2221
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:40,610
That's right.

2222
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,070
That's right.

2223
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,010
I made it.

2224
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:46,150
That's right.

2225
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,430
I'm in it to win it.

2226
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:49,570
Let's go.

2227
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:51,890
Knock her out.

2228
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,030
Alright, nice.

2229
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:55,410
Nice.

2230
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:56,930
Pineapple Supreme.

2231
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:58,530
Pineapple Ruppers.

2232
01:24:58,590 --> 01:24:59,970
I can't even see us.

2233
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,210
Where are we?

2234
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:02,250
Where are...

2235
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:04,010
Where am I?

2236
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:06,190
I can't even see me.

2237
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,300
Guys, guys, guys.

2238
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,200
Stand in front, guys.

2239
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,540
This is my lobby, everybody.

2240
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,780
Guys, guys, I need you.

2241
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,480
Guys, please.

2242
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,720
I'm gonna slap you in...

2243
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,340
Guys, it says ready, set, go.

2244
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,440
Please!

2245
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,800
How did you...

2246
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,340
Why won't you let me slap you in game?

2247
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,620
You let me slap you before ready, set, go.

2248
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,060
This is illegal.

2249
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:39,340
All my dragos won't let me slap them when we're in game.

2250
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,560
This is messed up.

2251
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,740
This is messed up.

2252
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:45,500
Oh, my god.

2253
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:46,240
Are you serious?

2254
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,900
The paraglider comes in right...

2255
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:48,760
Guys, please.

2256
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,220
Please, I'm so behind.

2257
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,400
Guys, please don't make me spectator.

2258
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,060
This is literally my own lobby.

2259
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,160
I'm literally sponsored, guys.

2260
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:57,620
Please.

2261
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,400
Please let me play this game.

2262
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:05,760
Oh, my god.

2263
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:06,540
Please, come on.

2264
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:06,920
Come on.

2265
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:07,600
You're so close.

2266
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,540
You're slapping range.

2267
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,100
You're literally...

2268
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,040
You're literally slapping range.

2269
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,460
I see you slapping range.

2270
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,980
That's... That's right.

2271
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:15,420
That's...

2272
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,460
I don't need to slap you.

2273
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,340
I'll just be a whale.

2274
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:19,540
Get out.

2275
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:20,280
Get out.

2276
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:21,180
That's right.

2277
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,260
Now I'm so close to...

2278
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,420
What?

2279
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,900
How did I not slap?

2280
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,040
That shit means...

2281
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,320
Are you serious?

2282
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,140
I'm so unlucky.

2283
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,040
Am I actually?

2284
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,120
I'm so unlucky.

2285
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:40,620
I'm sad.

2286
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,600
It's fine.

2287
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:42,700
We're gonna still make it.

2288
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,000
We're gonna still make it.

2289
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:44,440
Yes.

2290
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:44,940
Yes.

2291
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,080
I did it.

2292
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:46,860
26 times.

2293
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,200
Who didn't make it?

2294
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,080
Who didn't?

2295
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:50,960
Yeah, I see you.

2296
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:51,940
That's right.

2297
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,640
I see you.

2298
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,540
I still made it.

2299
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,540
I'm still gaming.

2300
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,440
I wish we're Empire.

2301
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,140
I'm still gaming.

2302
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,120
That's right.

2303
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:09,280
We're still in it.

2304
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,980
We're still in it to win it.

2305
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,320
You guys all tried so hard to get me out.

2306
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:17,600
But it's too late.

2307
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,680
I'm still here.

2308
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,560
I'm still here.

2309
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,440
That's right.

2310
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,780
I'm still here.

2311
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,420
You can't get me out of it.

2312
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,340
That's right.

2313
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:30,960
Get slapped.

2314
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,900
Get slapped.

2315
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,680
Oh my God.

2316
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,220
We are...

2317
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,080
Oh no.

2318
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:43,200
I really want that though.

2319
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,700
I really want...

2320
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:47,420
That was like a magic carpet filled with sardines.

2321
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:51,920
That was literally a magic carpet filled with...

2322
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:52,180
No.

2323
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:52,920
Oh my God.

2324
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:53,380
That's okay.

2325
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:53,960
That's good.

2326
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:54,340
That's...

2327
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:54,800
No.

2328
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,380
You penguin.

2329
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,520
Goddamn penguin.

2330
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:02,760
Oh no.

2331
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:03,920
Come on.

2332
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,120
Yes.

2333
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,020
Yeah.

2334
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:07,880
All right.

2335
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:08,540
We're still in it.

2336
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,440
Okay.

2337
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:11,540
80%.

2338
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:12,480
We have ultimate.

2339
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,120
We have ultimate.

2340
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:13,860
We can keep going.

2341
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,200
All right.

2342
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,340
That's all right.

2343
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:17,400
Let's go.

2344
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:17,680
Let's go.

2345
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:19,660
It's fast.

2346
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:20,380
Speed.

2347
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,120
And I can slap him here too.

2348
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,660
The final stretch.

2349
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:24,560
Oh my God.

2350
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,380
They're all so close.

2351
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,760
Are you serious?

2352
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:28,020
Oh.

2353
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:30,560
Okay.

2354
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,000
The final stretch.

2355
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,280
Two.

2356
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,200
Two sardines.

2357
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:35,240
Oh.

2358
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,340
This is a new map.

2359
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,040
This has to be a new map because I don't know this map.

2360
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:41,740
I've never seen this map before in my life.

2361
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:43,620
Come on.

2362
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,880
I don't have it.

2363
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,200
Let

2364
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:50,290
me in.

2365
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:50,950
Let me in.

2366
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:51,310
Let me in.

2367
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:51,690
Please.

2368
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:53,330
Please.

2369
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:55,250
Please let me in, my

2370
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:06,920
man.

2371
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,200
Stop.

2372
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:07,940
Please.

2373
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,180
Let me on the carpet.

2374
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,040
Please.

2375
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:17,980
I'm like just running at the carpet.

2376
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,800
Oh my God.

2377
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,280
I'm a ghost.

2378
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:23,840
No.

2379
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,500
This is unfair.

2380
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,600
Don't ever know.

2381
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,000
That's the point.

2382
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:32,400
Let's go.

2383
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:34,720
I don't want to race.

2384
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:41,100
I'm banished to the spectator realm.

2385
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:43,760
What's the point?

2386
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,800
I'm literally dead.

2387
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:51,320
The god damn sand level.

2388
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,060
All my homies hate sand.

2389
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,980
I think all the maps were pretty fun, not gonna lie.

2390
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:04,900
All the maps are really unique in its own way, so...

2391
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,920
I don't really have a favorite so far.

2392
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,880
I have a non-favorite, the sand one.

2393
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,220
I know which map I hate.

2394
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:22,080
But anyway, all the other maps are great.

2395
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,740
All the other maps are great.

2396
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:28,820
Except for the sand one.

2397
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:35,430
Wait, you can slap as a sand?

2398
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:39,370
Wait, are you saying I can sabotage people?

2399
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,380
Oh my god.

2400
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,260
Wait, you should have said that in the beginning.

2401
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,340
It's always...

2402
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,280
Okay, nice.

2403
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,920
Pineapple sweet, let's go.

2404
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,620
That's all that matters.

2405
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:55,480
Let's go, guys.

2406
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:56,280
Yeah!

2407
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,940
Pineapple sweet!

2408
01:30:59,080 --> 01:30:59,640
Let's go!

2409
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:03,800
That's fine.

2410
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:05,020
That's fine.

2411
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,700
That's fine.

2412
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:08,320
The pineapple sweet, though.

2413
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,400
The pineapple sweet.

2414
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,220
The tomato and the pineapple suit.

2415
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,720
In the end...

2416
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,340
In the end, that's all that matters.

2417
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,920
All right, I'm gonna reset the lobby, guys.

2418
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:22,940
So we can have new people in.

2419
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:26,960
Okay, lobby's gonna be reset soon.

2420
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,440
All right, select play mode.

2421
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:35,070
All right, create room.

2422
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:38,750
Boom, boom, boom.

2423
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:39,970
Boom, boom, boom.

2424
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:41,610
All right.

2425
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:43,050
Copy.

2426
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,270
I'm gonna copy this.

2427
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,210
All right, now.

2428
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:47,490
Join up.

2429
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:49,590
Join up, goons.

2430
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:53,310
It's your time to shine.

2431
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:00,870
Remember, this is a free-to-play game, so anybody can join.

2432
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:03,070
Anybody can play with us.

2433
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:04,130
What?

2434
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:05,750
How are you all max?

2435
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:07,050
How are...

2436
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:08,330
How are your pros?

2437
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:10,630
The game came out yesterday.

2438
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:12,690
Like, what were you...

2439
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,930
Guys, remember to click on my link and download the game.

2440
01:32:17,870 --> 01:32:19,490
All right, we have one more spot.

2441
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:24,570
If I can't race, no one can reset the lobby.

2442
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:26,150
No!

2443
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:28,110
Why didn't you tell them my plan?

2444
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:30,070
No name.

2445
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:32,030
Thank you for the super chat.

2446
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:33,150
Thank you, thank you.

2447
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:33,990
My plan!

2448
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:45,780
Oh, my God.

2449
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,380
I can't believe you guys got...

2450
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:49,600
You guys figured out my plan.

2451
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,760
How did you guys figure it out?

2452
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:55,820
Wait, did the site crash?

2453
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,180
Oh, my God.

2454
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,640
Did we crash the website?

2455
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:00,740
That's good.

2456
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:01,740
You made it like that.

2457
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:06,200
Show them the power of the dragons.

2458
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,380
By the way, you can download it on Steam, by the way, guys.

2459
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,000
You can...

2460
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,060
You downloaded the game on Steam.

2461
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,840
It's literally on Steam for free.

2462
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,160
Yay!

2463
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:31,900
I'm flying.

2464
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,540
Two dragoons together strong.

2465
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,340
Guys, let's try and get all pineapples.

2466
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:44,520
If you have pineapple unlocked, grab that pineapple suit on.

2467
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:52,640
All right, here we go.

2468
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,480
Mangrove jungle.

2469
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,140
I should enjoy this map.

2470
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:56,960
This map's fun.

2471
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,120
All right.

2472
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:59,300
We got this.

2473
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,320
All right, guys.

2474
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,100
Blow bubbles.

2475
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,740
Just show them what we got.

2476
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:06,840
Are you serious?

2477
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:07,260
How...

2478
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:08,880
There were so many of you guys.

2479
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:11,420
How did not a single one of you guys got slapped?

2480
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,940
I don't understand.

2481
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:18,560
There were so many of you guys in front of me.

2482
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:20,940
How did none of you guys got hit?

2483
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,620
How is that...

2484
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:23,000
Oh, nice.

2485
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:23,440
I got it.

2486
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:23,720
Nice.

2487
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:24,420
Complaining works.

2488
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:25,540
Guys.

2489
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,120
Guys.

2490
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:27,440
Yay.

2491
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:29,960
Complaining works.

2492
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,320
Let's go.

2493
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,980
I can go.

2494
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,300
I knew it.

2495
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:38,860
I knew it.

2496
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:42,420
If you complain hard enough, you'll eventually get what you want.

2497
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,720
Oh, my god.

2498
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,560
How am I stuck?

2499
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:45,900
How am I...

2500
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:46,360
Please.

2501
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,860
I haven't got a single hit.

2502
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,420
Oh, there you go.

2503
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:51,640
Deserved.

2504
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:52,740
Deserved.

2505
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,800
I'll remember what you did.

2506
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,360
Matt, can we get over here?

2507
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,100
Matt, can we get over here?

2508
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,740
How do we get over here?

2509
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,220
Please, please don't do this to me.

2510
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:03,020
All right.

2511
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:03,260
Nice.

2512
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:03,680
We're fine.

2513
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:04,040
We're fine.

2514
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,280
Get hit.

2515
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:06,420
All right.

2516
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:07,400
There we go.

2517
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,580
We're okay.

2518
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,040
We're okay.

2519
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,420
I mean like there's no way.

2520
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:15,420
There's no way we're like, we can't make it to top 32 guys.

2521
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,460
Like there has to be like, look, there's no way.

2522
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,160
We don't need to be up ahead guys.

2523
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:22,780
There's no way.

2524
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:23,700
We still have time.

2525
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,940
Guys, we still have time.

2526
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:26,120
Ah!

2527
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:27,240
Shit!

2528
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:28,920
Okay, that's 30 of them.

2529
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:30,400
We made it.

2530
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:31,840
Yeah!

2531
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:36,200
We made it.

2532
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:40,380
Yay!

2533
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,400
I told you guys, there's no way we don't make it.

2534
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,580
I told you.

2535
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,380
I told you there's no way.

2536
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,020
There's no way we wouldn't make it.

2537
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:53,620
I told you guys.

2538
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,580
And I was right.

2539
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,900
I was right.

2540
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:02,620
All right.

2541
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:02,980
Nice.

2542
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:04,600
All right.

2543
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:05,280
Slap.

2544
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:06,560
Slap.

2545
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:07,080
Guys, please.

2546
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:08,720
I need to get like, oh, thank God.

2547
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:09,000
Okay.

2548
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:09,660
I got one hit.

2549
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,200
I think I know the plan.

2550
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,940
I just have to be like in the pile.

2551
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,860
I have to be in the pile.

2552
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:18,520
In the dragoon pile.

2553
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,080
I gotta be in the middle of the mosh pit.

2554
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,540
I have to get a slap.

2555
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,740
It's the mosh pit hour.

2556
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:26,880
Come on.

2557
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,280
Yes!

2558
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:28,220
Got it.

2559
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:30,260
Nice.

2560
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,480
Wait, where did that come from?

2561
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,060
But that's okay.

2562
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,240
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna complain.

2563
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,600
I'm not- HAHA.

2564
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,260
I have to be in the mosh pit.

2565
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,940
Yeah... guys we gotta start moshing.

2566
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:40,500
Okay.

2567
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:42,480
Just gotta start moshing.

2568
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,100
Okay, we're ahead.

2569
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:45,520
We're ahead.

2570
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,460
This is what winners feel like.

2571
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:48,520
Okay.

2572
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,260
This is- this is what third place feels like.

2573
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:56,120
This is what third place feels like.

2574
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:59,840
Okay, this is what fourth place... fifth place feels like, guys.

2575
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,640
Fifth place is still okay.

2576
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:05,220
Fifth place is still pretty alright, guys.

2577
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,960
That's all I'm saying.

2578
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,220
Alright, nice.

2579
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,440
I'm going straight in.

2580
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:12,020
Okay, not like...

2581
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:13,920
Guys, there's... oh, please.

2582
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,640
Alright, that's fine, that's fine.

2583
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,420
That is also fine.

2584
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,900
And then we're gonna grab...

2585
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,560
We're so close to more sardines here.

2586
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:23,740
Come on.

2587
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:24,980
Jump!

2588
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:26,920
That's right, mine!

2589
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,600
No, no, I needed that sardine!

2590
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:31,020
No!

2591
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:31,800
Get over here!

2592
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:32,180
Yes!

2593
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,700
Get over here.

2594
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:37,500
That's right, you don't deserve to live in game.

2595
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,700
You deserve to live in real life.

2596
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:41,480
I hope you wake up to have a great, wonderful day.

2597
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,640
Oh, God, okay.

2598
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:43,660
Nice, alright.

2599
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:44,800
We're so in.

2600
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:46,460
Yeah!

2601
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:47,720
Yeah!

2602
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:50,420
Party!

2603
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:51,680
Yeah!

2604
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:53,040
Yeah!

2605
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:54,980
Who did that?

2606
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:55,780
Who did that?

2607
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,300
Did you do that?

2608
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,480
Get out.

2609
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Can't you see?

2610
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:04,320
Look at the people that didn't make it through the boat.

2611
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:04,980
Goodbye.

2612
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:06,380
Yeah, that's right.

2613
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:07,620
I see you, Neil.

2614
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:08,980
Didn't get your...

2615
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:10,780
You didn't get your boat ticket.

2616
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:11,920
Bought the wrong ticket.

2617
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:14,740
Alright.

2618
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:15,900
Marsh pit.

2619
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,680
I hate this part.

2620
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:18,480
This is the world...

2621
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,380
The one with the...

2622
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:21,220
You can miss the world thing.

2623
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,040
Guys, marsh pit.

2624
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:22,580
We're mashing.

2625
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:23,940
Guys, we're mashing.

2626
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:24,380
Come on.

2627
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:25,760
We gotta mash.

2628
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:27,180
Guys.

2629
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,000
We gotta mash.

2630
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:32,260
Guys!

2631
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:33,160
What?

2632
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,200
Did you not hear what I said?

2633
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,260
I had one simple instruction.

2634
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,140
I don't understand how we could mess that up.

2635
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,260
How did we mess up the mash?

2636
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,280
Oh, thank God.

2637
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:55,500
Okay.

2638
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,160
We both got it.

2639
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,840
They just...

2640
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,280
But Doki, they were mashing.

2641
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,160
You just weren't invited.

2642
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:03,200
What do you mean?

2643
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:04,740
I started the mash.

2644
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:07,700
How could I not be invited if I started it?

2645
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,680
Are you serious?

2646
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,700
Are you serious?

2647
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:11,500
Who was it?

2648
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:15,820
Come up to the front of the class right now.

2649
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:16,940
Who was it?

2650
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:17,120
Who was it?

2651
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,120
Who did that?

2652
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:21,840
Hey, that's fine.

2653
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,000
This is not fine.

2654
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,340
This is not fine anymore.

2655
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:26,760
This is not fine anymore.

2656
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:29,900
I am not feeling fine anymore.

2657
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,080
Get over here.

2658
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:34,660
I'm heading over.

2659
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,400
No!

2660
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,240
I was too fast.

2661
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:39,520
No!

2662
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:40,520
It's too fast.

2663
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,180
No!

2664
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:54,870
LET MY WHEEL IN!

2665
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:55,950
PLEASE!

2666
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:58,870
LET MY WHEEL IN, AT LEAST!

2667
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:03,590
NOOOOO!

2668
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:05,030
I'M SORRY!

2669
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:06,210
PLEASE LET ME IN!

2670
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:09,570
PLEASE, I'M DOING THE CHORES!

2671
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:10,570
PLEASE!

2672
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:11,910
PLEASE!

2673
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:18,330
IT'S NOT FAIR!

2674
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:20,730
Oh, you guys got sand land.

2675
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,030
That's fine, nevermind.

2676
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:23,370
That's fine with me.

2677
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:25,390
I didn't want to do the sand level.

2678
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:27,470
That's fine, I'm gonna slap you.

2679
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:29,690
You think you'll be safe?

2680
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:30,970
You think you'll be safe?

2681
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,590
We're all gonna slap you.

2682
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:34,950
That's right.

2683
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:37,970
I'll make sure you're not gonna have- That's right, I'm gonna target you!

2684
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:39,450
And I'm gonna target you!

2685
01:40:39,730 --> 01:40:40,490
That's right!

2686
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:42,690
The ghosts are in the lead now, how is it?

2687
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:43,890
And I'm gonna steal- Oh!

2688
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:45,110
Okay, nevermind.

2689
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:47,810
That's right.

2690
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:48,930
Where are you?

2691
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:50,830
I see you're a real penguin.

2692
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:51,850
Get over here.

2693
01:40:51,970 --> 01:40:52,730
Get over here!

2694
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:54,750
Oh, you're trying to run away?

2695
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:58,570
Oh, you're trying to run away, you little- You little FISH!

2696
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,770
That's right, get over here!

2697
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:01,150
I'm coming after you!

2698
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:02,170
God damn it!

2699
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:03,330
No.

2700
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:05,270
Okay.

2701
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,890
That's fine.

2702
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:07,510
Oh, Glocks, I'm gonna get you!

2703
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:08,650
I'm gonna get you!

2704
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:09,910
I'm gonna get you!

2705
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:15,890
Oh, we don't even get- We don't even get certain games!

2706
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:17,210
This is not fair!

2707
01:41:18,590 --> 01:41:20,370
Oh, I'll make sure you don't win.

2708
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:27,270
I didn't mean to do that, but I wanted to slap him.

2709
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:31,190
That's fished up.

2710
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:38,390
I had to make sure- I had to make sure that he doesn't get to enjoy the game.

2711
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:41,070
If I am a ghost...

2712
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:42,250
Get over here.

2713
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:42,730
Where are you?

2714
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:43,990
Where are you?

2715
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:46,670
No!

2716
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:48,070
I couldn't hit it!

2717
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:49,850
Oh, no.

2718
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:52,190
Does that push me forward?

2719
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:52,510
Nice.

2720
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:52,790
Okay.

2721
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:53,930
Get over here.

2722
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:54,850
Yeah, that's right!

2723
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:56,490
Oh, that's right!

2724
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:58,250
Yeah!

2725
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:59,510
Oh, you guys didn't make it?

2726
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:00,890
Oh, that's so sad!

2727
01:42:01,970 --> 01:42:04,110
Oh, you didn't make it!

2728
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:05,190
Hahaha!

2729
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:15,650
It's alright.

2730
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:16,230
Two out of three.

2731
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:16,830
I take those.

2732
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:19,170
You can't afford a pineapple!

2733
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:22,090
If you're a red penguin, that means you are a pineapple!

2734
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:23,590
Why aren't you a pineapple?

2735
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:26,650
Look straight!

2736
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:29,850
Why would penguins wear pineapple?

2737
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:31,650
Why aren't you a pineapple?

2738
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:35,810
You clearly- You clearly can't afford it!

2739
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:37,010
Hahaha!

2740
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:37,410
Hahaha!

2741
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:43,050
Don't think I'm stupid!

2742
01:42:43,410 --> 01:42:44,770
I know you have!

2743
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:46,590
I know you have the pineapple!

2744
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:47,630
Hahaha!

2745
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:51,270
I know you have it!

2746
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:52,570
Wait, what did I unlock?

2747
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:54,310
Did I unlock something?

2748
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:57,770
Wait, I unlocked something.

2749
01:42:58,090 --> 01:42:58,830
What was it?

2750
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:00,550
Oh, it's the...

2751
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:02,190
It's the name tag.

2752
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:03,170
Yeah, sardine.

2753
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:04,190
Actually, I like the whale.

2754
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,410
I think the whale is really cute.

2755
01:43:05,410 --> 01:43:06,230
I don't want to be green.

2756
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:08,890
He's adorable!

2757
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:12,310
Alright.

2758
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:14,570
That's not what I want.

2759
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:15,250
Alright.

2760
01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:17,570
Private time.

2761
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:18,990
That's not what I want.

2762
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:19,890
Hahaha!

2763
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:22,650
Okay, private time!

2764
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:24,990
Alright, another lobby.

2765
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:26,790
Coffee.

2766
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:28,450
I'm going to post it in the chat first.

2767
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:31,590
And then reveal it on stream.

2768
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:33,750
Alright, here you go.

2769
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:35,250
Another private lobby.

2770
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:36,490
Like I said, it's free to play.

2771
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:37,490
So just download.

2772
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:38,690
Click on the link.

2773
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:39,970
I don't know if they fixed the link yet.

2774
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:43,110
But click on the link and then you can join the game.

2775
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:44,870
Join this lobby.

2776
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:51,840
Alright.

2777
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,520
Why don't you have a pineapple?

2778
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:58,700
Well, now that I know how easy it is to get the pineapple.

2779
01:43:59,320 --> 01:43:59,720
Hahaha!

2780
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:04,900
Well, I figured out it was so easy to get it.

2781
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:05,860
Hahaha!

2782
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:06,080
Hahaha!

2783
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:09,280
Alright.

2784
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:14,420
Alright, we have one more spot, guys.

2785
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:15,280
We have one more.

2786
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:16,640
There's 39.

2787
01:44:24,190 --> 01:44:24,970
Alright, guys.

2788
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:25,590
39!

2789
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:26,790
We have one more slot!

2790
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:30,710
40!

2791
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:31,030
Alright.

2792
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:31,750
Nice.

2793
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:34,610
Alright, I'm ready.

2794
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:36,750
I hope you guys are all ready.

2795
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:39,270
It'll suck if you guys aren't.

2796
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:40,950
It'll be a little awkward if you guys aren't ready.

2797
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:41,270
Guys.

2798
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:43,850
Nice.

2799
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:44,110
Alright.

2800
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:46,950
Ba-ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum.

2801
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:53,360
Nice.

2802
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,100
Phantom dragon with no pineapple.

2803
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:56,940
Laugh at this guy.

2804
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:59,360
Little bubbles at him for not having a pineapple.

2805
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,960
Look at him.

2806
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,180
How do you not have a pineapple yet?

2807
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:04,620
Hahaha!

2808
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:08,180
Little bubbles at him for not having a pineapple.

2809
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:09,760
That's right.

2810
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,740
No pineapple, penguin.

2811
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:13,020
That's right.

2812
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,120
Hahaha!

2813
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:14,300
Hahaha!

2814
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,140
Let's slap him!

2815
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:17,200
Slap him!

2816
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,920
Turkey, stop pineapple-shaming.

2817
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:24,560
I can't believe you don't have a pineapple, Phantom.

2818
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:26,240
Where did he go?

2819
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,000
Where did he go?

2820
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:28,700
Hahaha!

2821
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:29,860
No pineapple.

2822
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:31,880
That's right.

2823
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,980
Anyway, this is my favorite costume.

2824
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:35,780
Hahaha!

2825
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:37,740
That I can afford.

2826
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:38,960
Hahaha!

2827
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,040
For the...

2828
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,000
For the affordable costumes, this one's my favorite.

2829
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:48,900
But yeah, apparently the more you play, the more costumes you unlock.

2830
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,020
Which makes sense.

2831
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:50,820
Hahaha!

2832
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:57,580
I wonder if that's how they got the... the... the costume where he looks like Darth Vader.

2833
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,760
It's fast, penguin!

2834
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:05,300
That's what it is.

2835
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:05,840
Look at this.

2836
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:07,580
This is a pineapple lobby.

2837
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:08,460
Hahaha!

2838
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:10,820
That's right.

2839
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:13,500
This is a pineapple lobby right here.

2840
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,100
Oh, God.

2841
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,920
God, I missed the mosh pit again!

2842
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,680
They all moshed without me!

2843
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:19,320
Hahaha!

2844
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:21,260
Guys, please!

2845
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,260
I just wanna be included in the mosh pit!

2846
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,780
Stop moshing without me!

2847
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:27,960
It's not fair!

2848
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:28,800
Hahaha!

2849
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:33,160
I just wanna be included, guys!

2850
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:34,480
Hahaha!

2851
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:36,800
That's right.

2852
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:37,360
Get out.

2853
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,880
This is my lobby.

2854
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,120
Alright, here we go.

2855
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:43,480
No, I'm not going.

2856
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:43,660
Oh, no!

2857
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:45,580
No, not the crab!

2858
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,360
Who let this crab in here?

2859
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,120
He doesn't even go here!

2860
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:50,040
Please.

2861
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,060
Please, I don't have any sardines.

2862
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:52,820
I only have two.

2863
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:54,680
I haven't been able to grab anything.

2864
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:56,680
Please, I need to feed my hungry family.

2865
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,620
My family of me.

2866
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,100
No!

2867
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:01,860
There's...

2868
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,380
No!

2869
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:03,100
There's no way!

2870
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:03,780
There's no way!

2871
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:04,960
I think I'm last!

2872
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:06,260
Oh, no.

2873
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:07,900
This has to be the worst I've ever done.

2874
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:09,780
Oh, my God.

2875
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,540
Did I got slapped in the back?

2876
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:12,760
Coyote, please!

2877
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:13,460
Oh, thank God!

2878
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:14,540
Nice, JK.

2879
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:15,540
I'm not last anymore.

2880
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:19,580
Look at these losers who are so slow.

2881
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:21,740
Like, look at you guys.

2882
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:23,080
Oh, my God.

2883
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:24,480
How are you guys so slow?

2884
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:30,440
Everybody has whales already.

2885
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,080
I only have two sardines.

2886
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:36,720
I only have two sardines.

2887
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,060
This is messed up.

2888
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:40,960
I don't have enough.

2889
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,440
I actually don't have enough.

2890
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:44,620
I don't have enough right now.

2891
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,120
Oh, he missed.

2892
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,140
That's good.

2893
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:48,380
Okay, nice.

2894
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:48,940
I got that.

2895
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:50,660
Three sardines.

2896
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,460
That's three is more than two.

2897
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:53,960
Four sardines.

2898
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,380
Five sardines.

2899
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:56,320
Seven sardines.

2900
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,460
How did I get seven?

2901
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:58,660
Oh, I made it.

2902
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:01,660
That's right.

2903
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:03,100
I made it.

2904
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,100
Let's go.

2905
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:05,620
Let's go.

2906
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,560
You guys are just...

2907
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,180
Who are the ones that don't make it?

2908
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:10,200
Look at him.

2909
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:11,460
The non-pineapples.

2910
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:12,260
All right.

2911
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:12,820
Okay.

2912
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,120
Okay.

2913
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:13,440
Okay.

2914
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:15,000
Look at the non-pineapples.

2915
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,760
Oh, they couldn't catch the fly.

2916
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,760
Put it to my left, guys.

2917
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,180
Look at these dragons that couldn't make it.

2918
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:33,160
Look at these non-pineapples that couldn't make it to the play.

2919
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,060
Mosh pit.

2920
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:36,320
Guys, mosh pit.

2921
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:36,940
Get in here.

2922
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:38,600
Put me in the middle of the mosh pit, guys.

2923
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:40,300
Guys, I need to mosh.

2924
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,300
I need...

2925
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:43,220
Guys, mosh that.

2926
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:43,440
Get in here.

2927
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,480
Yes!

2928
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,640
I was in the middle!

2929
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,120
That's all it took.

2930
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,000
That's all it took.

2931
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,300
I did it, guys.

2932
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:51,660
I moshed.

2933
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,520
I moshed.

2934
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:54,880
I finally moshed.

2935
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,340
Okay, nice.

2936
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,280
I'm at 10%.

2937
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,800
And that's how you mosh, chat.

2938
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:05,460
That's how... and she misses the second.

2939
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:06,660
No!

2940
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:08,280
Who was it?

2941
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,520
Who was it?

2942
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:11,600
I need... did anyone grab the license plate?

2943
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,700
Did anyone grab the license plate of that penguin?

2944
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:18,300
Give me their name so I can kick them out of my lobby.

2945
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:21,140
Give me their... Oh, whoa.

2946
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,200
Oh, four?

2947
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:25,860
Okay, that was pretty good.

2948
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,740
That was some pretty good jumping.

2949
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,080
You did it yourself.

2950
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,880
There's no way.

2951
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:34,740
That's right.

2952
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:36,340
Oh, you see me?

2953
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,780
You know I'm fucking coming...

2954
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,340
You know I'm fishing coming over for you.

2955
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,280
You know that.

2956
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:41,020
You know that.

2957
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:41,820
Come on.

2958
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:42,740
You know that, Iggy.

2959
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:43,940
I'm coming for you, Iggy.

2960
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:44,700
That's right.

2961
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:46,160
Get your penguin ass over here.

2962
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:46,720
No!

2963
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:49,960
It's fine.

2964
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:50,460
That's fine.

2965
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:50,860
That's fine.

2966
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:52,420
We're... this is like second round.

2967
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,540
We don't need to be first, guys.

2968
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:55,240
It's literally second round.

2969
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:59,480
We don't need to... We don't need to be first in the second round.

2970
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:00,280
We can be 12.

2971
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:03,500
We can be 12, guys.

2972
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:04,000
It's fine.

2973
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:06,680
Alright, laugh at the... Oh, no!

2974
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:08,120
No, Pineapple's made it!

2975
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:09,780
That's right, Coyote.

2976
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:11,080
That's right.

2977
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:12,800
Alright, guys.

2978
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:14,820
Point at these... Point at these dragons, Coyote.

2979
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:15,720
Make it to the boat, guys.

2980
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,720
Go to the side and point at them and laugh.

2981
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:19,560
Guys, go to the side.

2982
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:21,520
Look at these... God, look at these losers.

2983
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:23,040
Look at them.

2984
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,140
I love how we're all on the side.

2985
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:31,420
We're all on the side and pointing at them.

2986
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:35,360
Coyote and me.

2987
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:36,120
Guys, mosh pit.

2988
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:37,660
Guys, I'm in the center.

2989
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:39,320
Guys, mosh pit right now.

2990
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:40,020
Stop!

2991
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:42,880
Guys, we all know what to do in the mosh pit, guys.

2992
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:45,640
Nice.

2993
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:48,560
How did... Okay, we all blocked each other, but that's okay.

2994
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:50,560
No!

2995
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:51,460
God damn it.

2996
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:52,580
Don't touch me.

2997
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:53,520
Don't touch me.

2998
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,280
Don't you dare touch me.

2999
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:57,620
Personal space.

3000
01:50:58,740 --> 01:50:59,220
Nice.

3001
01:50:59,220 --> 01:50:59,480
Okay.

3002
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,860
How did you get... You have 10?

3003
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:05,760
Oh, you deserve that, actually.

3004
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:08,420
You... You definitely deserve that.

3005
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,240
Okay.

3006
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:12,060
I don't know what I got here.

3007
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,680
Oh, I don't want to grab the bomb, though.

3008
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:14,940
Okay.

3009
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:16,720
That's double.

3010
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:17,440
Nice.

3011
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:19,120
Okay.

3012
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,240
No, I want that.

3013
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:20,680
I want that.

3014
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:20,960
No!

3015
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:21,840
I missed!

3016
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:23,500
No!

3017
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:26,860
I did the crook inside.

3018
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:27,660
That's fine.

3019
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:28,040
That's fine.

3020
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:28,420
That's fine.

3021
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:28,740
That's fine.

3022
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,520
Missing is part of the progress.

3023
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:32,560
It builds character.

3024
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:34,920
Oh, God.

3025
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:35,700
Okay, that's fine.

3026
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:37,200
It builds character, guys.

3027
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:37,740
It builds...

3028
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:39,700
Guys, it builds character.

3029
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,080
Okay.

3030
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:41,600
Guys, we all...

3031
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,140
Nice.

3032
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:43,080
That's right.

3033
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:45,280
This is what character growth does.

3034
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:46,860
That's... Get out.

3035
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:50,880
I've built enough character now.

3036
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:52,120
All right.

3037
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:53,120
Come on.

3038
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:53,680
No!

3039
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:55,500
Nice.

3040
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:56,240
Okay.

3041
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,440
Get over here.

3042
01:51:58,580 --> 01:51:59,440
Yeah, I'm coming for you, Medi.

3043
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,040
That's right.

3044
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:00,900
Medi, get over here.

3045
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:02,020
That's right.

3046
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:02,460
Get over here.

3047
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:02,820
Get over here.

3048
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:03,840
Get over here!

3049
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:04,900
Get over here!

3050
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:06,020
Get o... Okay, I don't need you.

3051
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:09,320
Still made it.

3052
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:10,500
I don't need you.

3053
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,380
I don't need you dead.

3054
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:13,000
Yeah!

3055
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,960
Look at... We... We eliminated more non-penguins!

3056
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:16,980
Non... Non-pineapple!

3057
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:19,700
All right.

3058
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:20,420
Go to the side, guys.

3059
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:23,080
Go to the side and point at these non-pineapples in the lab.

3060
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:23,680
Point at them.

3061
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,080
I couldn't make it.

3062
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,940
I couldn't make it.

3063
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:34,300
Nice.

3064
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,320
Every round, we got rid of more non-pineapples.

3065
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:39,120
Every round, we got rid of more non-pineapples.

3066
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:42,300
Okay.

3067
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:42,780
Okay.

3068
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,040
There's only...

3069
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,060
All right.

3070
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:45,660
We're the majority.

3071
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:46,400
Nice.

3072
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:49,000
We have... We're the majority, guys.

3073
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:49,440
That's good.

3074
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:50,360
That's good.

3075
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,240
We got pineapple territory now.

3076
01:52:57,820 --> 01:52:58,900
That's all we wanted.

3077
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,480
We're in pineapple land.

3078
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:05,400
Nice.

3079
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:05,740
Okay.

3080
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:06,860
Oh.

3081
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:09,000
Oh, what?

3082
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:09,880
How did I miss?

3083
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:10,800
I didn't even hit anything!

3084
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:12,480
Why did it say I missed?

3085
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:14,720
No, we can't let this... No!

3086
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:16,420
No!

3087
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:18,760
This is not fair!

3088
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:21,740
How did I goddamn collapse?

3089
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:23,760
Ragroll, please!

3090
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:25,760
I want some sardines!

3091
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:27,240
I need the feed!

3092
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:28,880
Please!

3093
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:29,620
Please!

3094
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,920
I need to be fed!

3095
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:33,520
Okay, you deserve that, actually.

3096
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:35,040
For stealing all the sardines.

3097
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:36,880
You actually deserve that.

3098
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:38,820
You goddamn... Please!

3099
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,000
Ragroll, get sardines!

3100
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:42,280
That's right.

3101
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:43,560
I'm coming for you, Ragroll.

3102
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:44,540
That's right.

3103
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:45,320
Remember me.

3104
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,040
Remember me.

3105
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:49,960
That's right.

3106
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:52,060
You try to take all my sardines.

3107
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:53,460
I take your life in-game.

3108
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:55,220
Oh.

3109
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:56,620
We're so close to Morph.

3110
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:57,480
Wait.

3111
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,160
Okay.

3112
01:53:58,220 --> 01:53:58,640
We got this.

3113
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:00,260
Yes!

3114
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:00,940
We made it!

3115
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:02,480
There's no way!

3116
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:03,220
We made it!

3117
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:03,940
Twelve!

3118
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:04,880
Yes!

3119
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:07,020
The rag will make it?

3120
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:07,340
No.

3121
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,660
You deserve to be here.

3122
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:18,080
You deserve to be here.

3123
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:19,600
You deserve to be here.

3124
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:21,200
You deserve to be here.

3125
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:24,540
Yeah!

3126
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:25,220
Pineapple!

3127
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:41,700
The pineapple majority reigns on 203.

3128
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,360
203.

3129
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:43,280
That's all that matters.

3130
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:43,980
Two hundred.

3131
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:47,840
All right, we have time for one more game.

3132
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,280
We'll do one public lobby.

3133
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:58,720
We'll have one for one last game and we'll do one public lobby for the last game.

3134
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:01,060
Oh, that's been fun!

3135
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:07,420
Huge shout-out again to the sponsor for sponsoring the stream.

3136
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:09,060
I really appreciate it.

3137
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:12,060
It's been a really fun time, especially playing with my dragons.

3138
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:17,220
And the customization, the maps, the Battle Royale aspect.

3139
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:18,820
I love Battle Royale.

3140
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,840
I just love Battle Royale.

3141
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:22,600
What can I say?

3142
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:28,740
Apparently, they're adding more features later on.

3143
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:33,560
Obviously, they're adding more updates, more costumes, more cosmetics, and everything.

3144
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,760
But the ranking system is really interesting too.

3145
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:39,340
The fact that they have a ranking system and everything.

3146
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,960
Oh my god.

3147
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:43,860
This is awesome.

3148
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:51,120
It took so much.

3149
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:54,960
The penguin anger.

3150
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:05,740
The other non-pineapples.

3151
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:09,520
It took so much out of me.

3152
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:12,180
The gameplay sabotage, man.

3153
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:19,320
The goddamn gameplay sabotage.

3154
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,440
From all those non-pineapples.

3155
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:24,980
The penguin road rage!

3156
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:26,440
Oh my god.

3157
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:27,880
I mean, that's basically it.

3158
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:30,500
I mean, you're not wrong.

3159
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:33,260
It's just penguin road rage.

3160
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:37,340
And this is why I should not drive.

3161
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:44,100
This is exactly why I shouldn't drive.

3162
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:44,500
I should drive.

3163
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:46,840
It's not like road rage.

3164
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:47,840
Flare it up.

3165
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:49,340
You penguin.

3166
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:51,880
Oh my god.

3167
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:53,000
That's such a cool pet.

3168
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:53,240
Wait!

3169
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:54,540
That's so cute!

3170
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,620
That's such a cute penguin.

3171
01:56:57,820 --> 01:56:58,700
Get off my head.

3172
01:56:58,800 --> 01:56:59,800
I swear to god.

3173
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:01,000
Get off my head!

3174
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,680
Get off my head!

3175
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:04,340
There you go.

3176
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:07,680
Wait.

3177
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,940
How can I be on somebody's head?

3178
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,440
I want to be on somebody's head.

3179
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:12,540
I want to be on somebody's head.

3180
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:12,840
No, no.

3181
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,080
You cannot be on my head!

3182
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,780
If I'm on somebody else's head!

3183
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:17,680
No, I'm gonna be on...

3184
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:18,260
There you go.

3185
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:19,940
That's right.

3186
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:22,800
Now it's my turn.

3187
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:23,940
No!

3188
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:27,340
Everybody wants to get on somebody's head!

3189
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:29,960
Everyone's jumping up now.

3190
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:32,780
No, no, no, no.

3191
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,900
If anybody's gonna be on top, it's gonna be me.

3192
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:37,220
Get over here.

3193
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:38,260
I like how the...

3194
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:40,760
Please!

3195
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:43,900
I wanna be on top!

3196
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:44,680
Why

3197
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:50,980
does everybody else...

3198
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:51,500
Oh, there you go.

3199
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:52,280
That's right.

3200
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:54,820
That's goddamn right.

3201
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:57,100
Okay.

3202
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,100
This is it, guys.

3203
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:00,500
Guys, I gotta win.

3204
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:01,040
Please.

3205
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,340
Guys, mosh pit.

3206
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:08,620
Guys, we can't let these non-dragoons win, guys.

3207
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:10,280
We have to have a mosh pit strat.

3208
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:12,160
We gotta work together.

3209
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:13,780
Nice.

3210
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:14,020
Alright.

3211
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:16,300
We did it.

3212
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:18,020
We did it.

3213
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:18,200
Oh!

3214
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:19,720
Nice.

3215
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:19,920
Okay.

3216
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,300
We're doing it.

3217
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:22,880
We figured it out, the tech.

3218
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:25,080
We figured it out.

3219
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:27,400
Oh, we're so good at this.

3220
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:29,800
Oh, no, we're not so good at this.

3221
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:33,800
We're figuring.

3222
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:34,260
Please.

3223
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:34,900
Please!

3224
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:35,420
No!

3225
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:38,200
Everybody was all grouped together.

3226
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:39,300
Paraglider.

3227
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:39,780
Paraglider.

3228
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:40,720
That's right.

3229
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:42,560
That's right.

3230
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,500
Shouldn't have been grouped up together.

3231
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,860
You gotta be outside the box, guys.

3232
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:50,440
Y'all think outside the box.

3233
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:50,860
Y'all think outside the box.

3234
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:53,820
If you all bunch up together, you miss out on the paraglider.

3235
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:55,360
Wait, this map is cool.

3236
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:56,500
Oh, god, no.

3237
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:57,540
That's right.

3238
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:58,240
You try to...

3239
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:00,720
You're gonna be off your whale soon, and I'm gonna get you.

3240
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:03,280
Oh, you know I know you're gonna be off your whale.

3241
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:03,680
That's right.

3242
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:04,740
What?

3243
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:10,000
Shouldn't have activated your whale that early.

3244
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:12,180
Now I'm...

3245
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:14,120
Now I'm here to send a message.

3246
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:15,620
Now I'm here.

3247
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,040
Come on, come on.

3248
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:18,660
No, no, no, no!

3249
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:20,500
You fish!

3250
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:23,360
It's okay.

3251
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:24,920
We're calm.

3252
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:26,400
We made it.

3253
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:27,580
Yeah!

3254
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:28,720
Yeah!

3255
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:30,280
Where is he?

3256
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:31,400
Where is he?

3257
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:32,000
Where is this guy?

3258
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:33,340
Where is this guy?

3259
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:34,840
I remember his name.

3260
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:35,940
Where is he?

3261
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:36,860
This guy.

3262
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:37,260
This guy.

3263
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:37,620
This guy.

3264
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:39,060
The non-pineapple.

3265
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:39,500
This guy.

3266
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:40,480
Blow bubbles at him!

3267
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:43,820
Blow...

3268
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:45,760
All right.

3269
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:48,680
Now we point and laugh at the people that couldn't make it.

3270
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:50,460
Look at you.

3271
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,480
Couldn't afford a ticket.

3272
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:57,880
Couldn't afford a ticket.

3273
01:59:58,140 --> 01:59:59,080
You fish!

3274
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,920
Pineapple versus pineapple.

3275
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:06,480
I'm surprised I made it this far.

3276
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:08,340
I got to round one.

3277
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:14,360
All the practice from you dragoons in the private lobbies really helped.

3278
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:15,520
Now I'm a gamer.

3279
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:21,020
Now I'm a goddamn gamer.

3280
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:22,960
All right, guys.

3281
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:23,340
Mosh pit.

3282
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:24,860
Wait, there's an ice cream guy?

3283
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:26,580
Get him out of this lobby.

3284
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:27,580
He doesn't deserve it.

3285
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:28,000
Get him out.

3286
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:29,500
We all have to target him.

3287
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:32,700
Okay.

3288
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:33,100
Nice.

3289
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:33,440
All right.

3290
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:34,540
Mosh pit.

3291
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:35,240
Nice.

3292
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:36,880
Yes!

3293
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:38,320
Oh, no!

3294
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:39,460
I hit the thing!

3295
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:40,440
It's okay.

3296
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,540
We're still moshing.

3297
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:44,500
The thing's gonna stop me.

3298
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:45,460
We're still moshing.

3299
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:46,800
Oh, yes.

3300
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:47,100
Right.

3301
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:47,800
You're in front.

3302
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:51,220
Thank you for being in front of me.

3303
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:52,760
That's good.

3304
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:56,620
What the heck?

3305
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:57,900
How did I?

3306
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,140
Where did you guys come from?

3307
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:01,160
Where'd all you guys come from?

3308
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:03,660
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3309
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:06,000
No, no!

3310
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:09,910
Oh, come on.

3311
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:10,370
Yes!

3312
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:13,190
Oh, I missed?

3313
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:15,110
But he was in front of me.

3314
02:01:15,110 --> 02:01:16,630
Paraglider, paraglider!

3315
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:17,150
Yes!

3316
02:01:17,910 --> 02:01:19,050
Goodbye losers.

3317
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:19,930
Haha.

3318
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:22,390
Imagine being a ground penguin.

3319
02:01:22,770 --> 02:01:23,770
Couldn't be me.

3320
02:01:26,610 --> 02:01:28,290
Couldn't be me.

3321
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:33,950
Imagine being on the ground as a penguin.

3322
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:38,590
What freaks.

3323
02:01:38,730 --> 02:01:41,450
What goddamn penguin freaks.

3324
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:45,150
Okay, that's okay.

3325
02:01:46,350 --> 02:01:47,110
That's okay.

3326
02:01:47,290 --> 02:01:47,930
We're fine.

3327
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:50,170
Yes!

3328
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:52,050
Get out, get out.

3329
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:54,710
Okay, that's not fair.

3330
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:56,010
I like hit a barrier.

3331
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:58,590
Fourth place, baby.

3332
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:02,070
Me and my whale got fourth place, baby.

3333
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:03,930
Did I scream too loud?

3334
02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:04,530
I think I made it.

3335
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:06,050
Guys, this is our target.

3336
02:02:07,210 --> 02:02:08,190
I'm gonna blow bubbles.

3337
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:08,930
Remember him.

3338
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:09,810
This is our target.

3339
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:10,970
He can't get...

3340
02:02:11,670 --> 02:02:13,170
Guys, we can't let him get anything.

3341
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:21,230
We can't let the ice cream penguins win.

3342
02:02:21,930 --> 02:02:22,950
Guys, we can't.

3343
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:28,630
Fourth.

3344
02:02:31,390 --> 02:02:32,050
Activity three.

3345
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:32,950
Alright, two more rounds.

3346
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:33,550
Two more rounds.

3347
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:39,750
We gotta make sure the ice cream penguins...

3348
02:02:39,750 --> 02:02:47,830
Guys, as the pineapple, as leader of the pineapple penguin group, we have to make sure all the ice cream penguins don't have anything.

3349
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:50,050
Like ingame though.

3350
02:02:50,170 --> 02:02:52,130
Like not toxic...wise though.

3351
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:54,130
Like just...just like...ingame.

3352
02:02:56,350 --> 02:02:59,290
Alright, get out.

3353
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:00,730
Get out.

3354
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:01,090
Oh, no!

3355
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,870
dyal...dyal dodyal...dyal dodyal dodyal..

3356
02:03:03,870 --> 02:03:05,210
cyn...cy mountains of it possibile Okay, I'm going to use you.

3357
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:06,870
Penguin, get over here.

3358
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:08,250
I need to use you.

3359
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:08,910
Penguin, no!

3360
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:10,230
Penguin, no!

3361
02:03:20,370 --> 02:03:23,010
We need to work together and then we win!

3362
02:03:23,590 --> 02:03:24,730
Wait, that's so cute.

3363
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:26,470
She's using a bed to slide.

3364
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:28,850
Hey guys, I finally got some sardines, guys.

3365
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:31,830
I finally did it.

3366
02:03:31,950 --> 02:03:33,810
I got some sardines.

3367
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:35,370
Oh, nice.

3368
02:03:35,470 --> 02:03:35,970
We need that.

3369
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:38,270
Wait, no, that's not fair.

3370
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:39,210
They have paragliders.

3371
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:40,210
Wait, what?

3372
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:45,110
What happened?

3373
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:48,150
What happened to me?

3374
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:51,690
That was so weird.

3375
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:54,530
I got like bumped up everywhere.

3376
02:03:55,110 --> 02:03:57,090
Oh no, we're at 50%.

3377
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:58,030
This is not good.

3378
02:03:58,790 --> 02:04:00,290
This is not good at all.

3379
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:03,230
Oh no.

3380
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:04,570
No.

3381
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:07,050
No, please.

3382
02:04:09,210 --> 02:04:09,850
Oh, we made it.

3383
02:04:10,770 --> 02:04:11,490
We made it.

3384
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:12,950
Did the ice cream guy made it?

3385
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:14,590
Did the ice cream guy made it?

3386
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:16,250
Did the yellow ice cream guy made it?

3387
02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:19,190
Yes!

3388
02:04:19,190 --> 02:04:19,830
That's right!

3389
02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:23,830
That's right!

3390
02:04:24,010 --> 02:04:25,490
The yellow ice cream guy made it!

3391
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:26,250
We did our job!

3392
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:28,470
Oh, wait.

3393
02:04:29,070 --> 02:04:30,190
There's a pink ice cream?

3394
02:04:31,230 --> 02:04:32,790
Where did the pink ice cream come from?

3395
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:36,190
Nice.

3396
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:37,210
It worked.

3397
02:04:38,110 --> 02:04:38,510
Targeted.

3398
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:41,810
Targeted road rage worked.

3399
02:04:43,810 --> 02:04:45,470
Our lobby is safe now.

3400
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:51,030
Guys, it's okay.

3401
02:04:51,070 --> 02:04:52,270
Our lobby is safe now.

3402
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:55,030
With no yellow ice cream, we're safe.

3403
02:04:55,570 --> 02:04:56,630
What did he do?

3404
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:57,390
I don't know.

3405
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:58,150
He's just...

3406
02:04:59,190 --> 02:05:01,850
He could have given us brain freeze, guys.

3407
02:05:01,950 --> 02:05:02,970
I saved the lobby.

3408
02:05:04,010 --> 02:05:05,790
I literally saved the lobby.

3409
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:06,910
He could have... Oops.

3410
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:08,970
I'm sorry, guys.

3411
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:11,610
Okay.

3412
02:05:12,330 --> 02:05:12,730
Nice.

3413
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:14,890
Bounty cleared.

3414
02:05:16,970 --> 02:05:17,370
Alright.

3415
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:18,730
We're okay.

3416
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:21,090
I'm not gonna go... I'm not gonna try the bomb thing again.

3417
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:22,770
The bomb thing was a little too risky.

3418
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:25,810
It was definitely way too risky.

3419
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:28,430
Oh, my God.

3420
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:28,950
That was close.

3421
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:31,490
I almost... I almost thought that was like...

3422
02:05:31,490 --> 02:05:31,750
No!

3423
02:05:31,870 --> 02:05:32,210
Oh!

3424
02:05:32,210 --> 02:05:32,890
Oh, thank God.

3425
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:36,750
He like used me... He used me to make sure I don't hit the bomb.

3426
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:38,390
Thank God.

3427
02:05:39,550 --> 02:05:41,130
He bumped me out of the way.

3428
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:41,930
Nice.

3429
02:05:42,090 --> 02:05:42,570
20%.

3430
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:43,770
No!

3431
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:46,170
Okay.

3432
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:50,350
I'm gonna be like a horse and... and jump over these hoops.

3433
02:05:51,490 --> 02:05:51,970
Alright.

3434
02:05:52,030 --> 02:05:52,370
Nice.

3435
02:05:53,190 --> 02:05:53,970
Grab this.

3436
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:56,610
Oh.

3437
02:05:56,610 --> 02:05:57,310
Grab him.

3438
02:05:58,010 --> 02:05:58,490
Nice.

3439
02:05:58,990 --> 02:05:59,770
Get over here.

3440
02:06:00,030 --> 02:06:01,170
Get over here, penguin.

3441
02:06:01,910 --> 02:06:02,810
No, but slow down.

3442
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:03,290
Slow down.

3443
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:03,630
Slow down.

3444
02:06:03,710 --> 02:06:04,350
I need to use you.

3445
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:05,250
Slow down!

3446
02:06:06,750 --> 02:06:07,090
Slow down!

3447
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:08,330
Please!

3448
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:11,170
Oh, no.

3449
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,690
Thank God.

3450
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:11,910
Okay.

3451
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:12,450
That's fine.

3452
02:06:13,890 --> 02:06:14,290
Wait.

3453
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:15,310
That slows you down.

3454
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:16,790
That actually slows you down.

3455
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:17,570
Wait.

3456
02:06:17,710 --> 02:06:17,970
Wait.

3457
02:06:17,990 --> 02:06:18,490
I can make it.

3458
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:20,330
I can make it.

3459
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,730
Yeah!

3460
02:06:21,130 --> 02:06:21,530
Six!

3461
02:06:23,050 --> 02:06:23,450
Yeah!

3462
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:24,550
None

3463
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:30,120
of the ice creams.

3464
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:30,520
Oh, wait.

3465
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:31,500
One ice cream made it.

3466
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:35,560
We did it, guys.

3467
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:39,060
Top ten.

3468
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:41,140
And we got a pineapple in.

3469
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:44,280
We're top five!

3470
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:50,100
I like how... I like how one of them wailed, guys.

3471
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:52,180
Let's go!

3472
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:54,220
We got one of our own in!

3473
02:06:57,980 --> 02:06:58,660
Yeah!

3474
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:02,480
Pineapple ready!

3475
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:06,920
Our lobby is like 80% pineapple.

3476
02:07:09,860 --> 02:07:14,320
I like how our lobby was like 80% pineapple.

3477
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:15,720
There's no...

3478
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:17,280
There's no other...

3479
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:20,040
There's no other desert players.

3480
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:22,640
We just took over the lobby.

3481
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:23,660
Yay!

3482
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:25,140
Another medal!

3483
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:28,340
Nice.

3484
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,140
Oh, I got summer pine... Oh, wait.

3485
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:32,980
Can I change colors?

3486
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:35,520
Wait.

3487
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:36,360
Can I change color?

3488
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:37,620
Pineapple colors now?

3489
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:39,680
Wait.

3490
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:40,060
I can.

3491
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:44,620
Oh, so that's how they change the colors.

3492
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:45,140
Nice.

3493
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:45,880
I see.

3494
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:46,940
I still like the yellow, though.

3495
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:48,800
I think the yellow is the cutest one.

3496
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:50,680
Um...

3497
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:51,760
Oh, the high five!

3498
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:53,180
That was fun, though.

3499
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,280
I'm gonna call it here.

3500
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,700
Because we do have another stream later today.

3501
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:58,820
But...

3502
02:07:58,820 --> 02:08:03,640
Thank you guys so much for coming to the sponsored stream with Fast Penguin!

3503
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:06,740
Thank you again to Fast Penguin for sponsoring me.

3504
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:08,820
And I hope you guys had a lot of fun playing.

3505
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:12,000
Like I said, if you guys want to support the stream, if you want to support the sponsor...

3506
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,860
Um... the game and everything...

3507
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:14,820
Just use the link.

3508
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:17,060
Um... and click the link and download the game.

3509
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,660
Like I said, it is free to play.

3510
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:19,600
It's free to play.

3511
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:22,060
Uh... so there's no, like... you don't have to pay for anything.

3512
02:08:22,220 --> 02:08:24,700
You just, you know... go right in and play the game.

3513
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:27,220
But anyway...

3514
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:29,760
Uh... hope you guys had a great time.

3515
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:31,280
Um...

3516
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:32,920
As always, everybody...

3517
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:34,060
Stay hydrated.

3518
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:35,140
Posture check.

3519
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,260
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3520
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:40,080
And if it stayed up for me, I'm doing another stream later today.

3521
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,800
Where we're announcing the winners for...

3522
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:42,560
Uh... gamer subs.

3523
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:43,140
Yeah!

3524
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:45,540
Stick by for... stay up for that if you guys want to.

3525
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:46,740
Um...

3526
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:47,800
What else do I want to say?

3527
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:49,060
What else do I want to say?

3528
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:49,800
Um...

3529
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:52,600
It was very difficult to be PG, but I think I did my best.

3530
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:52,940
Like...

3531
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:54,140
I think...

3532
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:54,880
I think...

3533
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:56,540
I think we made it work.

3534
02:08:59,040 --> 02:08:59,800
Anyway, guys.

3535
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:01,100
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3536
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:02,540
Bye, guys!

3537
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:03,560
Bye!
