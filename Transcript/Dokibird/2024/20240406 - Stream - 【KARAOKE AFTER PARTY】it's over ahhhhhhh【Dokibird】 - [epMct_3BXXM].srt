6
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,240
I did get like the copyright stuff, but it was just like,
oh, you can't monetize it.

7
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,260
And I was like, fine, that's fine.

8
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,020
I'm okay with not monetizing it.

9
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,260
I'm okay.

10
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,480
I can keep it up.

11
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,000
It just says like, oh, you just can't monetize it.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,280
I was like, I'm fine with that.

13
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,100

Oh, I was so nervous.

43
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,030
Because like, you know, it was like, first karaoke is always
like the most.

44
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:21,070
nerve-wracking part and I was like I wish I did my practice
I definitely wish I did practice a little bit more on the

45
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,450
singing but like um there are so many things going on and I
was like so busy that I didn't get a chance to practice as

46
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:34,030
much as I would love to so I was like stumbling my words I
was stumbling my words a lot and oh I don't know why I can't

47
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:44,130
breathe now now I can't even breathe I don't why um sorry
for thinking with super chat thank you thank you i'm here on

48
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,590
time this time totally did not oversleep you did great dokey
here here i hope the scuff doesn't get you down and down so

49
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,350
we love you thank you super chat thank you thank you so far
i'm i hope yeah i'm glad you guys enjoyed this scuff i was

50
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:06,710
like no i'm quashing no oh my god i was like the beginning i
was like really and i realized it was because of the program

51
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:13,610
i was using the web browser version of Kara fun instead of
the um I was using a web web version instead of like the

52
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,970
program itself I forgot because like it's been so long since
I did a karaoke that I forgot to use the the the actual

53
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,910
program instead of the web browser because the web browser
version overloads my PC because it's like really fucking the

54
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,890
processing for it's like huge and stuff so I forgot about
that and I was like trying to figure out I was like oh my

55
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,730
gosh what do I do and I was like oh my god maybe if I use
the program and then the moment I use the program it stopped

56
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:52,950
oh my god um and then like but then after that it was okay I
can't believe I had to like redo several signs um but you

57
00:06:52,950 --> 00:07:02,690
guys didn't hear um at 800k subscribers it would be my next
karaoke I will do my next karaoke at 800k subscribers and

58
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,750
then I will tell you guys the production

59
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:15,830
And, um, and everything will be bigger and better, um, than
the one that we have.

60
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,210
Uh, I will, I blame Canada, 100%.

61
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,950
The amount of time I sang Blame Canada five fucking times.

62
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,590
Four, it was like four fucking times.

63
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,390
That's how, how much hate I have.

64
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,330
It's always Canada's fault.

65
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,090
Like, now thank you for the super chat.

66
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,810
Thank you, thank you.

67
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,030
It's not VT, Rishi, and welcome.

68
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,330
technical difficulties it's true thank you for the super
chat thank you yeah but i'm such a perfectionist i made you

69
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:52,070
guys i felt really bad because i made you guys wait 40
minutes too and i was like no you guys waited 40 minutes

70
00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:02,290
youtube Canada and obs all of the above

71
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:18,890
everything it's not just it's never my fault it's everything

72
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:37,650
um um but yeah anyway uh so that was that was fun trying to
fucking navigate that i was like it's okay even though even

73
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:44,210
though i've been streaming for like even though i've been
streaming for like what is it three four year four plus

74
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,130
years now oh actually no like more so like professionally
but like like before that i wasn't like actually

75
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,970
professionally streaming but like even i've been streaming
professionally for like two plus years i i i hope i'm

76
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:15,130
getting better at streaming i i i hope i'm getting better
streamer and like and like uh the scuff is not as bad like i

77
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:23,550
hope the scuff was not didn't turn off and the reason why
i'm always like really worried about like scuffed is that

78
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,390
like um it's like i'm worried that that like you know like
basically turn off fans and stuff being like oh i don't want

79
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,890
like turn off like especially new viewers you're like oh i
don't want to watch it there's too too much scuff going on

80
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:40,550
so i'm always like a perfectionist when it comes to that and
i'm you know like obviously i'm like why can't i fucking

81
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:51,050
control this like i'm like why can't i control this i like
having control over what's going on on my stream

82
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,090
so i'm just like

83
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:10,450
um yeah but like uh yeah but i hope like you guys still had
fun and enjoyed it because like the crashing was a little

84
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:22,530
the crashing i was like uh uh but it was a lot of fun though
um but yes like i said at 800k subscribers it's gonna be a

85
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:33,110
bigger production value um maybe some custom outfits you
know i think but not like custom not like custom vtuber not

86
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,390
like custom like skin suit outfit but you know like you know
if you remember like last time how big the production was

87
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:48,130
last time maybe something similar you know he he he maybe
something similar like that uh honestly it was so so big

88
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:56,410
brain it was really fucking big brain of me to like uh have
like edit it and edit it video and stuff uh to play over it

89
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:04,290
versus like okay in the past i usually had to like manual i
manual stuff where i like press buttons manually on my

90
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:10,270
stream deck to like do like the performance you know like
have like random stuff jumping in and out and stuff like

91
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:19,490
that so i would do that manually on my stream deck i just
still did some today manually uh on my stream deck um but

92
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,370
like i was like you know what bro i could this could be like
even better if i had an editor do this so i was like at my

93
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,430
editors i was like who wants to try it out and then shad um
who's been done who's been like is one of my editors for my

94
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,430
shorts was like was like i can't And then, like, first, we
did, our first video we did was Welcome to the Internet.

95
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,870
And it was so good.

96
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,430
And then, I was like, oh, and then, like, today, I woke.

97
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,450
Okay, I didn't, to be fair, I didn't wake up.

98
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:49,930
It was more like, I, I, after the JP tournament, I messaged
him.

99
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:56,150
And I was like, oh, my God, can you also do, like, blame
Canada and friends like me before the stream?

100
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,990
And he's like, this is cutting it real close.

101
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:58,790
But I'm going to try.

102
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,990
And, like, bro, that guy fucking cried.

103
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,410
Like, he, like, fucking did it.

104
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,650
He got what I wanted in there because I was explaining,
like, my vision.

105
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,350
And then he actually did it before the stream.

106
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,550
To be fair, I did push the stream 40 minutes.

107
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,630
Like, like, we did push the stream 40 minutes.

108
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,950
But, like, it was worth it.

109
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,090
I felt like the weight was worth it, guys.

110
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,430
I felt like the weight was so fucking worth it for, like,
what we had.

111
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,250
Hey, Gio, thank you for the super chat.

uh really liked it and i'm i'm super happy because like you

116
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:55,030
know i was experimenting with this idea you know the the
experimentation of the idea of having a video playing over

117
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:00,490
it during karaoke and then it makes the karaoke much more
fun um because like you know i don't like doing just

118
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:07,130
something simple I like to pizzazz it a bit more like yeah
like I know like I'm not the best singer like I know like I

119
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:15,110
was just like no don't give me love hearing you sing but
come on I know I'm not the best singer okay we don't need a

120
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:28,930
lie to ourselves I might not be the best fucking singer so
like um I try my best to like you know make it my karaoke is

121
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:38,210
just a little bit more special of like what you see so like
it's literally like a performance you know like um um like a

122
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:46,130
performance and uh just like have fun with it and stuff like
that and you know like just have like a fun time like we

123
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:56,890
were watching me it's like a fun time um and I did have a
lot of fun like uh the um super honestly I know I'm like

124
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:03,130
fucking patting myself on the back but super to have like,
like, like, edited videos instead of doing the fucking props

125
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,290
and assets stuff, uh, like, by hand, actually super big
brain.

126
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,670
Super, thank you for the magenta super.

127
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,950
Thank you, thank you.

128
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,650
Thanks for the karaoke stream, dokey.

129
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,090
Everything stays the same sometimes, even the scuff.

130
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,170
It was Candace's fault for the technical difficulties
keeping me thinking over the magenta super.

131
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,570
Thank you, thank you.

132
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:34,750
I think the, the one funny part was the fact that, like, you
know, the, the, the sequel like just ended i was not ready

133
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:43,710
for that i was like wait that's it because i like listened
to the song but i never listened to the all the way to the

134
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:51,750
end i was just like wait it just ended i was like okay
that's that's it but honestly like i felt like that song was

135
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,050
like yeah that's me that's the song we're doing a sequel but
a better

136
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,870
We're gonna do it all over again.

137
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,850
We're doing a sequel.

138
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,870
We're back by popular demand.

139
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,050
Come on everybody, strike up the band.

140
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,630

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:12,740
chorus like i can only i can only do the first chorus that's
it the bgm is no it's too late

185
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,000

because i literally play the song in the background

186
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:42,200
i turned off my reverb um but yes guys 800k subscribers

191
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:22,040
does it's so like do people still do this yeah because uh
because of the fucking youtube algorithm um yeah the call to

192
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,340
action it's the smash that like button and hit the
notification bell it's because it's this is the youtube

193
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:40,000
youtube algorithm people are desperate i'm desperate people
me i'm people um also like by the way guys yeah like karaoke

194
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,680
stuff like i've been like planning it on and off i wish i
did have more time to plan the karaoke i feel like i did

195
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,900
sort of rush into the karaoke a little bit but i really
wanted to have the karaoke like last week because you know i

196
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:01,720
promised you guys a karaoke before the chair like before the
month was over for march um but then obviously like stuff

197
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,360
happened in the schedule so i had to put it but i didn't
want to delay too much because the charity goal was, the

198
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,000
charity goal was like, oh, I will have the karaoke before
March was over.

199
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,540
So then I was like, okay, all right, we're gonna fucking do
this.

200
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:23,520
We're gonna do it because I do wish I did have more time to
plan for it due to how busy I've been behind the scenes.

201
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,240
But I did learn a lot.

202
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,980
I did learn a lot regarding planning the charity stuff.

203
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,900
So, not charity stuff, regarding planning this karaoke.

204
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:43,420
since I'd done karaoke's and done like sang stuff like this
so I still I did that did it because I tried to make sure I

205
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:49,660
was able to do it just because I wanted to you know make up
for the charity like actually follow through on the charity

206
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:59,340
goal stuff and so yeah but the real karaoke the real super
karaoke it was just beta we're beta testing chat that was a

207
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:07,020
beta test to the actual karaoke which would be the 800k
subscriber one like we were beta testing you know like the

208
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:14,980

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,160
I didn't get to leave early.

235
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:29,540
So, um next week um we're gonna have two you know how we're
like oh we have one content warning we're gonna have two

236
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:36,340
content warning streams so i hope you guys won't be too
tired for the content warning stuff because uh next week we

237
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:45,440
have two content warning streams with two different groups
um the first group will be like j uh will be um um and jp

238
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,500
slash like uh uh chinese centric so like uh i'm collabing
with uh the first content warning stream will be with with

239
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:06,960
Ditto Hiro Hiro Hiro from and uh you might recognize her
name actually Hiro and um who was it the another one uh

240
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,920
Na-chan uh so Hiro and Na-chan are from Billy Billy and then
you know Ditto and I are YouTube Twitch so like uh it's

241
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:24,860
gonna be like fun trying to like communicate with everybody
um so that's gonna be the first content warning stream and

242
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:37,200
then the second content warning stream will be with uh it's
gonna be with uh snuffy lime and han han build uh so that's

243
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,060
the that's the second uh content warning stream one is gonna
be on friday and i think one is on thursday and the other

244
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:49,580
one's on the first one will be on thursday the second one
will be on saturday so that is the the double content

245
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:57,320
warning stream that's gonna be the collapse for next week um
That's going to be the collab, two, because, you know, I

246
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,780
usually schedule one to two collabs per week.

247
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,860
And that's going to, I know I actually put two content
warning streams, but I was just like, you know what?

248
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,800
I want to be able to play with all the different people, you
know?

249
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,620
I want to be able to hang out with a bunch of different
people next week.

250
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,640
So I set up two content warning streams.

251
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,100
Okay, shadow of Colossus.

252
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,740
Also, next week, we're going to...

253
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,040
Can I say bring back?

254
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,020
I guess, like, I mean, I guess.

255
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,720
Other than shadow of Colossus, for members, for members, I'm
bringing back the commissions are open.

256
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,700
I'm going to draw your icon horribly.

257
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:51,400
But if you've, like, commissioned me before, the draw your
icon horribly, if you could, like, let me know, like, tell

258
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,880
me what you let me know.

259
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:59,120
Like, I'm going to make a members post and just, just tell
me if you commissioned me before, it still stands.

260
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,580
Because if I haven't drawn your icon yet, it still stands.

261
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,580
Like, obviously, I don't have access to, like, the archive
of it anymore.

262
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:17,700
But, like, if you commissioned me for an icon, um, if
you're, and you're from the, from before, the before four

263
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,000
times, don't worry, in the members post, just fucking, like,
like, find a way.

264
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:31,420
to let me know we're gonna do honor system because i know
you dragoons have honor right like

265
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:47,540
you guys you guys have honor right we're doing a sequel i
just so have we're back by popular demand

266
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:11,240
yeah anyway so i'm bringing that back next week if you
haven't got an icon for me and i'll keep it open for future

267
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:20,640
for new dragoons too so uh for new dragoons as well if you
guys want an icon It will be open for that as well.

268
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,020
Let's see, what else?

269
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,920
What else do I want to update you guys on?

270
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,780
I think that's like majority of my updates.

271
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:35,380
I think like next week is a bit more chill because of the
fact that I'm not doing as much next week.

272
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,180
It's just collabs.

273
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,760
There's not really any events or stuff I'm participating in
or anything.

274
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,760
I still can't believe Twitch asked me to headline a Roblox
Twitch rivals.

275
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,280
I think that's like the funniest shit ever.

276
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:59,770
I thought that was so, I thought that was like, so fucking
funny that, uh, that like, Twitch was like, do you want to,

277
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,630
do you want to, like, be the headline for Roblox?

278
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,910
And I was like, bro, that's so fucking funny, I'm down.

279
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,090
I'm so, I'm so fucking, I'm so fucking down.

280
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,810
Also, um, um, bro, I'm having the worst time with customs.

281
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,330
Like, I told you guys, Like, I know all of you guys are
like, oh my god, PC fun.

282
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,190
Doki, PC fun.

283
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:30,890
Like, I was supposed to have Customs been holding my PC,
man.

284
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,750
I was like, oh my god, yay, PC.

285
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:41,970
I was going to be, like, so hyped because I'll be like,
guys, finally after you complained about my PC, my new PC,

286
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,870
it's been stuck in Customs.

287
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,250
Please, I checked the tracking every fucking day.

288
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:53,470
I check the tracking every fucking day and it's still in the
goddamn warehouse like release my PC

289
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:08,510
every day I check the fucking customs so yes the reason why
my PC is still fucked up is because um it's because you know

290
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:15,170
they they're I'm waiting I'm wait don't worry guys I'm
waiting I'm waiting just like all of you

291
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,650
Fucking Canada, man.

292
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,710
Oh, also, I wanted to talk about this.

293
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,370
But, like, did you guys know you can cheese gotcha now?

294
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,490
I did not realize this at all.

295
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,690
But apparently, like, people have figured it out.

296
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,150
You can cheese, like, blind.

297
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,690
Not, like, digital gotcha.

298
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,570
But, like, blindbox gotcha.

299
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,790
You know, like, those, like, merch, like, figure gotcha.

300
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,290
I want to give you guys a little life hack.

301
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:50,890
And, like, so, like, if you want to get a blindbox, or like
a figure or anything if you look underneath the if you look

302
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:59,250
at the box's serial numbers it's like uh different numbers
and stuff so like the serial numbers underneath or like any

303
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:06,050
numbers that's on a box or like any on the like blind box
and stuff correlates to specific figure or like specific

304
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:14,470
items so like you don't have to it's not random it's
actually not random i think i i learned that on a youtube

305
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:22,510
short I learned that from YouTube shorts guys

306
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:38,950
But like basically If you so you don't get You don't have to
be blind You don't have to It won't be blind It's real It's

307
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,390
actually real If you want to do If you want to like do like
IRL gotcha Or like figure gotcha And stuff like that Like

308
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:52,070
blind boxes all the code there's like just like the codes
correlate to the figure so like if you don't want you're

309
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:57,110
worried they're gonna get like duplicate if you're worried
you're getting duplicate you can like just like look at the

310
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:02,950
boxes underneath and then like just make sure it's just the
different numbers so you don't have to you won't get like a

311
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:12,850
double double blind box um will there be a discord server
for the dragoons to hang out with each other and get doki

312
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,150
scuff updates on the PC customs of the future McDowell.

313
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,570
Thank you for the super chat.

314
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:18,090
Thank you.

315
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:18,750
Thank you.

316
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,330
I mean, there's unofficial Discord.

317
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,530
I just need you guys, regarding Discord, I know a lot of
people are always asking me, like, oh, Doki, when will you

318
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,890
ever have, like, a Discord server?

319
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,430
I'm never going to have an official Discord server.

320
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:38,010
I know this is, like, a really a Twitch thing, but, like, my
substitute for a Discord server is, like, YouTube members.

321
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:47,150
The reason why I don't have a Discord server is because like
i learn um when you have when you have like okay like uh i

322
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,710
know like when i first started when i was like you know four
years ago i did have my own discord server four years ago

323
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:58,610
but i was like really small i was a really small streamer
and i was on twitch i got i was on twitch so um like it's

324
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:07,090
more known for like twitch streamers to have discord servers
but the reason why i don't do that i don't do that now um on

325
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:17,750
youtube uh i use my member stream as like the equivalent of
a do post like updates i do post updates i do post like um

326
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:26,970
um like uh you know like i do like exclusive streams on
members and stuff like that but the reason why is that um i

327
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:35,250
think like a year ago um i joined some i think like a year
and a half ago i joined somebody's like official server like

328
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:44,790
uh for a collab i think like you guys might remember this
this is like old lore um and then messaging me and sending

329
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:59,170
me friend requests uh to that account and like i was like
wait this is not smart for me that's why i don't i don't

330
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:06,150
want to have i don't do official discord service because
like it's just gonna mess up my discord even more i get like

331
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,210
every day i wake up to like

332
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:23,550
wake up to like 16 plus work messages every day from like
different people and i really cannot have that get cleared i

333
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:33,230
hate right i like i really cannot like have more messages
and friend requests it's also the reason why also is because

334
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:43,430
like my friend like um i also like don't really uh uh close
my friend requests and stuff um or like not close i i make

335
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:49,730
sure my my friend request like it's still like private in
some way for friend request but like it's not like super

336
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:56,690
closed because like um when i i do like work business stuff
like behind the scenes work stuff i'd just be like just add

337
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:04,230
me i'll just be like just add me because it's just easier
and i need to be sure that like uh uh just need to be sure

338
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,150
that my communication with like people when it comes to
business things would be okay

339
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,690
Why don't I separate account?

340
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:22,310
Because logging on and off for two I don't like dealing with
I mean, I used to deal with more than one account But like,

341
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:32,930
it's just simpler with Everything in one area for me Because
I already have a lot of stuff going on That's why That's why

342
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:40,030
I don't have an official server An official Discord server
Because a lot of my communication With work stuff and

343
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:46,370
business stuff Is on Discord It's not I don't have a slack
or anything anymore So it's all on it's mostly on discord

344
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:51,350
and email So it's just so much easier just not being on an
official server

345
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:06,670
Um Uh but we do have fan servers We do have fan servers
though Uh so if you guys like Are still want to join like a

346
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:12,970
A dokeybird fan server That's still they do a lot of
projects I know they do a lot of projects They did a Stinger

347
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:21,390
project recently, but on April Fuzz, I just, I was just so
busy that I haven't, I haven't like retweeted it or added my

348
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,030
Stingers, but it's so cute.

349
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,090
Did you guys see it?

350
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,010
They did like a Stinger project.

351
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,370
Oh my god.

352
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,130
Let me see if I can look it up.

353
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,390
I don't try to remember what it was called.

354
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,610
Okay, Stinger, Stinger, Dragoon.

355
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:37,890
Is that it?

356
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,590
Okay, don't keep bird.

357
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,810
Maybe that's it.

358
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,410
I'm pretty sure my fucking mods will find this faster than
me.

359
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,050
I found it!

360
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,730
Guys, it's so cute!

361
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,970
Wait, is this an introduction on how...

362
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,390
This is a guide on how to do it.

363
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,290
Guys, look at this.

364
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,690
Okay, never mind.

365
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,370
My mod did it.

366
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,390
I don't have to do it.

367
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,590
Nice.

368
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,530
My mod did the job for me.

369
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,410
Yay!

370
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,150
Don't worry, next stream.

371
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,350
or not next stream, the stream after the next stream,
because I'm too fucking...

372
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:22,230
The next stream is, like, challenger circuit, so, like, I
really don't think I have the energy to add.

373
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,030
To add...

374
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,190
To add...

375
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,010
Add this thing here by then.

376
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,050
Oh, like, I really don't have the energy.

377
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,430
I'm really excited.

378
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,270
There's so many stuff going on every...

379
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:34,990
Every day.

380
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,210
There's a lot of, like, events...

381
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,550
That are, like, being planned.

382
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,830

business deals and stuff being planned and everything and

384
00:39:50,730 --> 00:40:01,650

start going live i'm i'm super excited i wish i could do

385
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:10,310
more projects for you dragoons too like just just solely for
you dragoons type deal like like in the past um and

386
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:16,750
obviously a lot of those because I need to build like the
infrastructure for everything and like building the

387
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:25,570
infrastructure for everything and building a lot of stuff to
like be able to create new content and create like new

388
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,650
things for dragons.

389
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,010
And it's taking time.

390
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,770
It takes time.

391
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,890
But what are you guys looking forward to?

392
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,530
Like what would you guys like to see or like to have?

393
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:43,490
Like the Minecraft server for members, They said it'll take
a few more weeks.

394
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,470
A few more weeks to do.

395
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:48,690
Um.

396
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:50,450
And.

397
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,010
And.

398
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:53,830

It just takes time.

404
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,330
It takes a lot of time.

405
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,790
To build everything up.

406
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,130
Oh my gosh.

407
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,710
My energy is slowly dying.

00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,070
I think my adrenaline is worrying off.

409
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,710
