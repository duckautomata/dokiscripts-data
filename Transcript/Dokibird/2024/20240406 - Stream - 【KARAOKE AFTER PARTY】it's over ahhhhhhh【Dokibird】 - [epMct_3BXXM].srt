1
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,220
Oh my gosh.

2
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,440
I hope... oh my god I'm so fucking glad it's over.

3
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,380
That was so nervous and that karaoke... it's always the first karaoke.

4
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:10,120
It's always the first karaoke like I'm so nervous about because like you know I don't know how it's gonna go.

5
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:19,140
And I'm like oh scum I can't believe... I can't believe I kept crashing in the beginning and then I had to fix it live.

6
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,180
I was like no!

7
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,980
I'm really happy you guys liked it.

8
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:33,100
I did get like the copyright stuff but it was just like oh you can't monetize it and I was like fine that's fine.

9
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,780
I'm okay with not monetizing it.

10
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,120
I'm okay.

11
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,260
I can keep it up.

12
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,100
It just says like oh you just... you just...

13
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
can't monetize it.

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,100
I was like I'm fine with that.

15
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,920
I'm... it's alright.

16
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,440
That's why we have an after party here.

17
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,600
And like oh my god I was like re-listening to it.

18
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,080
Are you guys sure the instrumental was okay?

19
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
I was worried the instrumental was too loud.

20
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,440
Was it alright?

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
Was the instrumental too loud or was it okay?

22
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,300
I was really... I was really really worried it was too loud.

23
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,460
I was like re-listening to it.

24
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,540
I was like oh my god is this too loud?

25
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,120
Can you guys hear me okay?

26
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,040
It sounded great?

27
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:09,920
Really?

28
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,740
It was fine.

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,680
Okay I trust you guys.

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,720
It was great.

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,560
I trust you guys.

32
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,760
Oh my god.

33
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,960
I was like really... I was really nervous that the instrumental was like too loud for like too loud compared to me.

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,540
So I was like oh thank god.

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,100
Okay you guys felt like it was okay.

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,900
And I realized I actually forgot one song.

37
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,440
I forgot to sing one song that I actually really wanted to like do like as a little bonus because...

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,820
But then I was like you know.

39
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,960
I was like oh man I was so busy.

40
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,580
You know what?

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,100
Maybe this... this video might not be...

42
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,760
This stream might not be monetized too.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,740
I didn't get to use the bathroom.

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,140
Okay guys I need to use the bathroom.

45
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,140
Because I was like just like re-watching everything.

46
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,380
Okay guys I'm sorry I'm scuffed.

47
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,300
I'm... I'm even scuffed now.

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,160
I didn't use the bathroom.

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,360
I didn't get to use the bathroom.

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:57,940
I am

51
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,810
back.

52
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,250
I'm back here.

53
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,990
Oh my god.

54
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,750
I came back and there was... Oh my... Alex thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

55
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,450
Thank you.

56
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,050
Thank you.

57
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,950
I really appreciate it.

58
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,410
I came back and there was like 50 gift... Oh my god.

59
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,290
Thank you Alex.

60
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,370
I really appreciate it.

61
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,710
I was so nervous because like you know it was like... First karaoke is always like the most nerve-wracking part.

62
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,050
And I was like I... I like wish I did more practice.

63
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,190
I definitely wish I did practice a little bit more on the singing.

64
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,390
But like there was so many things going on and I was like so busy that I didn't get a chance to practice as much as I would love to.

65
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,070
So I was like stumbling my words.

66
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,170
I was like... I was stumbling my words a lot.

67
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,350
And... I don't know why I can't breathe now.

68
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,550
Now I can't even breathe.

69
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,350
I don't know why.

70
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,730
Cypher thank you for the super chat.

71
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,030
Thank you.

72
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,510
Thank you.

73
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,670
I'm here on time this time.

74
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,530
Totally did not oversleep.

75
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,490
You did great Doki here.

76
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,430
Here I hope the scuff doesn't get you down and down.

77
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,530
Thank you for the super chat.

78
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:50,870
Thank you.

79
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,690
Thank you Cypher.

80
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,670
I'm... I hope... Yeah I'm glad you guys enjoyed the scuff.

81
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,010
I was like no I'm quashing.

82
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:57,690
No.

83
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,590
Oh my god.

84
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,210
I was like in the beginning I was like really?

85
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,550
And I realized it was because of the program.

86
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:14,170
I was using the web browser version of KaraFun instead of the... I was using a web version instead of like the program itself.

87
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:21,510
I forgot because like it's been so long since I did the karaoke that I forgot to use the actual program instead of the web browser.

88
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:28,410
Because the web browser version overloads my PC because it's like really fucking... the processing for it is like huge and stuff.

89
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,350
So I forgot about that and I was like trying to figure out.

90
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,810
I was like oh my gosh what do I do?

91
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,870
And I was like oh my god maybe if I use the program.

92
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,490
And then the moment I used the program it stopped.

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,230
It stopped.

94
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,710
Oh my god.

95
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,290
And then like... but then after that it was okay.

96
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,030
I can't believe... I had to like redo several songs.

97
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:58,050
But if you guys didn't hear at 800k subscribers it will be my next karaoke.

98
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,910
I will do my next karaoke at 800k subscribers.

99
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,030
I will do my next karaoke at 800k subscribers.

100
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:15,590
And then I will tell you guys the production value for... the production value and everything will be bigger and better than the one that we have.

101
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,830
I will... I blame Canada 100%.

102
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,730
The amount...

103
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,430
I sang blame Canada five fucking times... four... it was four fucking times.

104
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,170
That's how much hate I have.

105
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,010
It's always good.

106
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,030
It's Canada's fault.

107
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,970
Like now thank you for the super chat.

108
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,290
Thank you.

109
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,850
Thank you.

110
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,950
It's not VTB stream without technical difficulties.

111
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,970
It's true.

112
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,030
Thank you for the super chat.

113
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,770
Yeah but I'm such a perfectionist.

114
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,290
I made you guys... I felt really bad.

115
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,890
Because I made you guys wait 40 minutes too.

116
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,310
And I was like nooo.

117
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,630
You guys waited 40 minutes.

118
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,130
YouTube.

119
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,990
Canada and OBS.

120
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,370
Hahaha.

121
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,310
All of the above.

122
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,790
Everything.

123
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,110
It's not just it's never my fault.

124
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,410
It's everything.

125
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,770
But yeah anyway.

126
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,190
So that was... that was fun.

127
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,170
Trying to fucking navigate that.

128
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:32,630
I was like...

129
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,390
It's okay.

130
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,330
Even though... even though I've been streaming for like...

131
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,330
Even though I've been streaming for like... what is it?

132
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,670
Three... four years... four plus years now.

133
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,410
Oh actually no.

134
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,390
Like more so like professionally.

135
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,050
Like before that I wasn't like actually professionally streaming.

136
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,530
But like even though I've been streaming professionally for like two plus years.

137
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,650
I... I...

138
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,130
I hope I'm getting better at streaming.

139
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:57,950
I...

140
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,490
Hahaha.

141
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,370
I... I...

142
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,410
I hope I'm getting better at being a streamer.

143
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,510
And like... and like...

144
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,910
The scuf is not as bad.

145
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:13,450
Hahaha.

146
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,450
Like I hope the scuf was not... didn't turn off.

147
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,730
And the reason why I'm always like really worried about like scufed.

148
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,890
Is that like...

149
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,370
Um...

150
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,770
Is like I'm worried that that's...

151
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,450
Like you know...

152
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,250
Like basically turned off fans and stuff.

153
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:41,130
I'm like, why can't I fucking control this?

154
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,690
I'm like, why can't I control this?

155
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,910
I like having control over what's going on on my stream.

156
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,850
I'm like...

157
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,790
I hope you guys still had fun and enjoyed it.

158
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,410
The crashing was a little...

159
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,830
The crashing was like...

160
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,590
It was a lot of fun though.

161
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,890
Like I said, at 800k subscribers...

162
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,470
It's gonna be a bigger production value.

163
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,950
Maybe some custom outfits, you know?

164
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,690
Not like custom VTuber...

165
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,610
Not like custom like skin suit outfit.

166
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,990
But you know, like...

167
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,710
You remember like last time...

168
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,910
How big the production was last time?

169
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,030
Maybe something similar, you know?

170
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,910
Hehehehe...

171
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,250
Maybe something similar like that.

172
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,850
Honestly, it was so...

173
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,310
So big brain.

174
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,770
It was really fucking big brain of me.

175
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,030
But it's like...

176
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,670
To have like...

177
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,050
To edit...

178
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,690
And edited video and stuff...

179
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,310
To play over it.

180
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:56,970
Versus like...

181
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,910
Okay, in the past, I usually...

182
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,030
Like...

183
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,950
Manual...

184
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,430
I...

185
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,950
Manual stuff where I like press buttons manually on my stream deck...

186
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,110
To like...

187
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,830
To like...

188
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,810
The performance, you know?

189
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,890
Like I have like random stuff.

190
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,370
Jumping in and out and stuff like that.

191
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,990
So I would do that manually on my stream deck.

192
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,650
I still did some today manually...

193
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,350
Ow...

194
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,530
On my stream deck...

195
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,710
But like...

196
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,990
I was like, you know what?

197
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,510
Bro, this could be even better if I had an editor do this.

198
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,690
So I was like, at my editors, I was like, who wants to try it out?

199
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:33,110
And then Shad, who is one of my editors for my shorts, was like, I can't.

200
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,290
And then our first video we did was Welcome to the Internet.

201
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,610
And it was so good.

202
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,290
And then today I woke... okay, to be fair, I didn't wake up.

203
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:49,790
It was more like I... after the JP tournament, I messaged him.

204
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,990
And I was like, oh my god, can you also do like Blame Canada and Friends Like Me before the stream?

205
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,570
And he's like, this is cutting it real close, but I'm gonna try.

206
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,870
And like, bro, that guy fucking cried.

207
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,350
Like, he like fucking did it.

208
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,490
He like, he got what I wanted in there because I was explaining like my vision.

209
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,170
And then he actually did it before the stream.

210
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,390
To be fair, I did push the stream 40 minutes.

211
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,370
Like, we did push the stream 40 minutes.

212
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,930
But like, it was worth it.

213
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,890
I felt like the wait was worth it, guys.

214
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,230
I felt like the wait was so fucking worth it for like what we had.

215
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,150
Hey, Gio, thank you for the super chat.

216
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,030
Thank you, thank you.

217
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,830
A true dragoon stays because their scuff is part of the charm.

218
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,530
And in no way made the experience bad.

219
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,770
I love your karaoke, though.

220
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,770
Can you sing despite what you sing?

221
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,230
It's really good.

222
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,690
Thank you.

223
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,770
Thank you for the super chat, Gio.

224
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,530
Thank you, thank you.

225
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,510
I'm really, really happy.

226
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,870
Uh, uh, that you guys really, uh, really liked it.

227
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,450
And I'm, I'm super happy.

228
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,670
Because like, you know, I was experimenting with this idea.

229
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,550
You know, the, the experimentation of the idea of having a video playing over it during karaoke.

230
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,910
And then it makes the karaoke much more fun.

231
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,290
Um, because like, you know, I don't like doing just something simple.

232
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,490
I like to pizzazz it a bit more.

233
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,170
Like, you know, like, I know, like, I'm not the best singer.

234
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,530
Like, I know, like, I was just like, no, don't give me love hearing you sing.

235
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,710
But come on.

236
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,310
I know I'm not the best singer.

237
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:11,670
Okay.

238
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,770
We don't need a lie to ourselves.

239
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,570
I might not be the best fucking singer.

240
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:30,570
So like, um, I try my best to like, you know, make it, my karaoke is just a little bit more special.

241
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,110
With like, what you see.

242
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,130
So like, it's literally like a performance, you know?

243
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,610
Like, um, um, like a performance.

244
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,950
And, uh, just like have fun with it and stuff like that.

245
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,590
And, you know, like, just have like a fun time.

246
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,430
Like we were watching it's like a fun time.

247
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,550
Um, and I did have a lot of fun.

248
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,190
Like, uh, the, um, soup.

249
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:03,730
Honestly, I know I'm like fucking patting myself on the back, but super big brain of me to have like, like edited videos instead of doing the fucking props and assets stuff.

250
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,030
Uh, like by hand, actually super big brain.

251
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,230
Super.

252
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,370
Thank you for the magenta soup.

253
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,330
Thank you.

254
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:12,870
Thank you.

255
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,510
Thanks for the karaoke stream, Doki.

256
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,870
Everything stays the same.

257
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,010
Sometimes even the scuff.

258
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,970
It was Katniss' fault for the technical difficulties.

259
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,010
Keep being me.

260
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,810
Thank you for the magenta soup.

261
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:32,370
I think the one funny part was the fact that like, you know, the, uh, the, the sequel, like just ended.

262
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,110
I was not ready for that.

263
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,930
I was like, wait, that's it.

264
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,270
Cause I like listened to the song, but I never listened to the, all the way through.

265
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,890
It's the end.

266
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,330
I was just like, wait, it just ended.

267
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,850
I was like, okay, that's, that's it.

268
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,490
But honestly, like I felt like that song was like, yeah, that's me.

269
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,950
We're doing a sequel.

270
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,390
But a better dad.

271
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,410
We're going to do it all over again.

272
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,710
We're doing a sequel.

273
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,350
We're back by popular demand.

274
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,150
Come on, everybody.

275
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:12,950
Strike.

276
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,110
Up the band.

277
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,850
And like everybody knows, sequel's never quite as good.

278
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,570
I definitely had a lot of fun.

279
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,830
Rockstar, thank you for the magenta soup.

280
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,470
Thank you.

281
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:30,950
Thank you.

282
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,590
It was really fun.

283
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:32,990
I'm glad.

284
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,390
I'm glad you guys had a lot of fun.

285
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,530
There was like a song that I did forgot to do.

286
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,110
I mean, I could, okay, guys.

287
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,450
All right.

288
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,830
I'll give you guys my treat.

289
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,870
Give me a sec.

290
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,050
I'm going to disappear a little bit.

291
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,870
My treat guys.

292
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,310
This is the right one.

293
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,290
My treat guys.

294
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,930
I'm gone for a little bit, but don't worry.

295
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,630
I promise you guys.

296
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,750
I was like, okay, I was going to do this as like a bonus.

297
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,790
And then like, I forgot about it, but I know like a lot of people demanded it.

298
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,650
I saw so many people asking for this.

299
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,850
So I was like, whoops.

300
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,030
Okay.

301
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,090
This, this stream might not be monetized as well.

302
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,550
I might get like, striked.

303
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,670
I don't know how to sing this song.

304
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,910
I never practiced it.

305
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,130
It's been like so long, but I saw so many people were like, oh my God, please sing this.

306
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:21,750
Okay.

307
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,690
What is it called again?

308
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,450
Oh, okay.

309
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:24,770
Here.

310
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,310
I think it's this.

311
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,650
Okay.

312
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,270
I'm just gonna have the video play with me too.

313
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,410
Cause I actually, I actually don't remember this, how to sing this song.

314
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,590
I just know how to sing like the beginning part.

315
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,850
I need to tell you guys, I actually don't remember.

316
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,690
I was singing this song.

317
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,750
Here we go.

318
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,670
Okay.

319
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:44,870
Okay.

320
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,170
Yeah.

321
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,410
Wait.

322
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,090
Reverb.

323
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,370
All right.

324
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:48,770
Here we go.

325
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:50,970
All right.

326
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,030
All right.

327
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,210
That's all I remember.

328
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,190
Okay.

329
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,050
Okay.

330
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,890
I don't remember how to sing this part.

331
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,130
Oh my God.

332
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,170
He sings it so fast.

333
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,790
I can't read it out.

334
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,330
I can't read this in time.

335
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:29,770
All right.

336
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,970
They sing it too fast.

337
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:42,970
I can't read it in time.

338
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,650
All right.

339
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,350
I'm not gonna read this one.

340
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,010
Never mind.

341
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,450
Alright.

342
00:17:59,450 --> 00:17:59,910
This is so funny clay.

343
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,090
All right.

344
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,510
Really.

345
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,370
Look at the face.

346
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,430
Look at the face.

347
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:10,950
Yeah.

348
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,850
I can't believe it.

349
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,250
I really can't read this one.

350
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,770
From stumbling.

351
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,220
It never changed.

352
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,480
She is never changed.

353
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,400
And that's like... I can't.

354
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,440
I stumble so much.

355
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,600
That's the only part I can actually sing.

356
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,420
There you go guys.

357
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,120
Here's the meow song.

358
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,560
It's called Learn to Meow.

359
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,460
It's a good song.

360
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,000
That song was stuck in my head for so fucking long when I first heard it.

361
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,420
But even then, I could never do more than that.

362
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,180
I can only do the first chorus.

363
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,100
That's it.

364
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,480
The BGM is... No, it's too late.

365
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,900
I guess this VOD won't be monetized as well.

366
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,840
How about...

367
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,260
That was honestly the only... I only remember how to sing the first.

368
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,040
Because I can't read fast enough.

369
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,260
Even with the pinyum.

370
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,760
With the pinyum, I was trying to read it.

371
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,320
But they sing it so fast that my brain was just like...

372
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,920
I really can't read the pinyum fast enough.

373
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,620
Like the cool kids.

374
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,500
I can't.

375
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,260
I'm so bad at it.

376
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,440
I can barely read English.

377
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,720
Let alone Chinese right now.

378
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,120
I'm too fucking stupid, man.

379
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,660
Zecra and Ivy, thank you for the magenta soup.

380
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,400
Thank you.

381
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:14,960
Thank you.

382
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,380
Bless.

383
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,800
Namo, thank you for the super chat.

384
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,060
Thank you.

385
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,360
Thank you.

386
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,760
Thank you.

387
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:18,920
Meow.

388
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,080
Thank you.

389
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,760
Thank you for the super chat.

390
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,080
Thank you.

391
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,640
Thank you.

392
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,060
But yes, I think this stream is definitely going to get demonetized.

393
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,600
Because I literally played the song in the background.

394
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,840
LOL LOL

395
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,660
I turned off my reverb.

396
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,600
But yes, guys.

397
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,520
800k subscribers.

398
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,560
Remember, like and comment and subscribe.

399
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,160
I feel like an actual YouTuber now.

400
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,860
Like and comment and subscribe.

401
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,620
If you love this video and the karaoke, remember to like, comment and subscribe.

402
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,040
So I don't know... You know like people will be like...

403
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:58,300
Oh, if this video hits 500k likes, I will do blah blah blah.

404
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,420
It's not going to be doing.

405
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:11,000
If my karaoke bot hits 100k likes and we hit 800k subscribers, we're going to do another karaoke.

406
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,920
It still does.

407
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,620
It's so... Like, do people still do this?

408
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,860
Yeah, because of the fucking YouTube algorithm.

409
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,280
Yeah, the call to action.

410
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,580
It's the smash that like button and hit the notification bell.

411
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,320
It's the YouTube algorithm.

412
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,540
People are desperate.

413
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,360
I'm desperate.

414
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,880
People?

415
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,360
Me.

416
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,140
I'm people.

417
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,200
Also like, by the way guys.

418
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,220
Yeah, like karaoke stuff.

419
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,200
Like I've been like planning it on and off.

420
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,160
I wish I did have more time to plan the karaoke.

421
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,800
I feel like I did sort of rush into the karaoke a little bit.

422
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,600
But I really wanted to have the karaoke like last week.

423
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,440
Because you know, I promised you guys a karaoke before the chari...

424
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,140
Like before the month was over.

425
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,580
For March.

426
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,360
But then obviously like stuff happened in the schedule.

427
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,040
So I had to put it.

428
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,960
But I didn't want to delay it too much.

429
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,780
Because the charity goal was...

430
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,860
The charity goal was like...

431
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,800
Oh, I will have the karaoke before March was over.

432
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,100
So then I was like, okay, alright.

433
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,400
We're going to fucking do this.

434
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,680
We're going to do it.

435
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,640
Because I do wish I did have more time to plan for it.

436
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,260
Due to how busy I've been behind the scenes.

437
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,820
But I did learn a lot.

438
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,740
I'm going to... I did learn a lot.

439
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,700
Regarding planning the charity stuff.

440
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,540
So...

441
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,460
Not charity stuff.

442
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,660
Regarding planning this karaoke.

443
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,820
Because it's been a lot of times since I've done karaoke.

444
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,500
And done like sang stuff like this.

445
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,240
So...

446
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,160
I still...

447
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,040
I did that...

448
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,880
Did it because...

449
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,180
I tried to make sure I was able to do it.

450
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,240
Just because I wanted to...

451
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,760
To...

452
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,680
You know...

453
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,780
Make up for the chari...

454
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,980
Like actually follow through on the charity goal stuff.

455
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,180
And...

456
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,040
So yeah.

457
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,240
But the real karaoke.

458
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,240
The real super karaoke.

459
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:55,960
With...

460
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,340
With...

461
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,280
It was just beta.

462
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,360
We're beta testing chat.

463
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,900
That was a beta test.

464
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,680
To the actual karaoke.

465
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,280
Which would be the 800k subscriber one.

466
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:04,860
Like...

467
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,040
We were beta testing.

468
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,400
You know?

469
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,060
Like the...

470
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,620
The...

471
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,980
What is...

472
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,580
What is it called?

473
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,160
The...

474
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,700
What is it called?

475
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,360
Pilot episode.

476
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,420
Karaoke pilot episode.

477
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,000
The karaoke was a pilot episode.

478
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,160
For the real karaoke.

479
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,420
That's why it was so scum.

480
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:28,940
You know?

481
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,060
We're looking for...

482
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,140
We're looking for investors.

483
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,160
To fund the pilot karaoke.

484
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:33,980
You know?

485
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,320
You know how like...

486
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,500
You know?

487
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,040
Gravity Falls.

488
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,880
The pilot episode for Gravity Falls.

489
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,120
And like Bob's Burgers.

490
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,060
Like all of that.

491
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,900
You could tell it was...

492
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,300
It's like not as great.

493
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,640
You know?

494
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,340
It's not that good.

495
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,000
You know?

496
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,020
That was the karaoke.

497
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,480
It was a pilot episode.

498
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,820
We're just looking for investors.

499
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,400
We're looking for somebody to fund our future karaoke's.

500
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,160
Um...

501
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,320
I'm sorry.

502
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,300
Um...

503
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,580
Can we get VeggieTales theme next karaoke stream?

504
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,780
And so you'll think of a super chat.

505
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,580
It might be funny as the main voice is a tomato.

506
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,700
VeggieTales.

507
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,260
VeggieTales.

508
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,440
VeggieTales.

509
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,820
VeggieTales.

510
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,860
Broccoli.

511
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,020
That's a pilot.

512
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,480
There you go.

513
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,560
Here's your pilot episode.

514
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,400

Oh shit...

520
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,820
You only get a little bit before the act...

521
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,340
Before the actual karaoke.

522
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,580
Um...

523
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,000
Also, we're like, not gonna lie.

524
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,280
Tomorrow we don't...

525
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,440
I don't know how long tomorrow is going to be because it's heavily dependent on...

526
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,820
It's going to be heavy...

527
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:52,060
Tomorrow is going to be heavily dependent on like how lucky we are when it comes to like if there's shitty teams...

528
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,780
If there is shitty teams that's going to be participating.

529
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,640
We're celebrating the Apex Legends Challenges circuit and stuff like that.

530
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,920
So like, the thing is we didn't practice.

531
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,360
Wig, Tenpo and I have not had a single practice session together.

532
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,400
I talked about this yesterday on the JP tournament thing.

533
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,140
But like, Wig fucking... apparently like...

534
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,860
He passed out yesterday and never checked his internet.

535
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,240
Like, never checked his socials or like his text messages.

536
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,740
Because we were trying to fucking... we're like, we're izzy.

537
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,300
Because we were supposed to have a practice session yesterday off stream.

538
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,380
And I was gonna be off stream.

539
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:37,560
And then today, this morning, he messaged us and was like, sorry, I was so fucked up, man.

540
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,680
I was like, guys, are we gonna be okay?

541
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,220
I was like, Tenpo was like, there's no way we're gonna be okay.

542
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,660
We're gonna lose the first round.

543
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,800
There's like golden plat players in there.

544
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,540
And I'm like...

545
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,640
And then Wig was like, but it would be so fucking funny though.

546
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,700
And I'll be like, but I get to end this early.

547
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,380
Now you reached last.

548
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,760
We were like, but it would be so fucking funny.

549
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,660
And I'm like, yeah, it was so funny.

550
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
I get to leave early.

551
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,680
So...

552
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,100
Next week...

553
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,120
We're gonna have two...

554
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,640
You know how we're like, oh, we're gonna have one content warning.

555
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,860
We're gonna have two content warning streams.

556
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,480
So I hope you guys won't be too tired for the content warning stuff.

557
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,440
Because next week, we have two content warning streams with two different groups.

558
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,340
The first group will be like...

559
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,040
Will be...

560
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,860
JP slash...

561
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,400
Chinese centric.

562
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,020
So like...

563
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,720
I'm collabing with...

564
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,540
The first content warning stream...

565
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,240
Will be with...

566
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,520
Ditto, Hiro...

567
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,400
H-I-I-R-O.

568
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,900
Hiro from...

569
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,620
And...

570
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,840
You might recognize her name actually, Hiro.

571
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,000
And...

572
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,320
Who was it?

573
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,080
Another one.

574
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,940
Na-chan.

575
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,820
So Hiro and Na-chan are from...

576
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,380
Billy Billy.

577
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,420
And then, you know, Ditto and I are...

578
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,180
YouTube Twitch.

579
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,240
So like...

580
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,680
It's gonna be like...

581
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,140
Fun trying to like...

582
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Communicate with everybody.

583
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,300
So...

584
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,060
That's gonna be the first content warning stream.

585
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,860
And then the second content warning stream will be with...

586
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,200
It's gonna be with...

587
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,300
Snuffy...

588
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,420
Lime...

589
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,200
And Han.

590
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,540
Hanbyul.

591
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,380
So that's the...

592
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,540
That's the second...

593
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,100
Content warning stream.

594
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
One is gonna be on Friday.

595
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,680
And I think one is on Thursday.

596
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,400
And the other one is on...

597
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,540
The first one will be on Thursday.

598
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,240
The second one will be on Saturday.

599
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,320
So...

600
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,440
That is the...

601
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,940
The double content warning stream.

602
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,220
That's gonna be the collabs for...

603
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,080
Next week.

604
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,400
That's gonna be the...

605
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,340
Collab...

606
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,800
Two collabs...

607
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,200
Cause you know...

608
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,040
I usually schedule...

609
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520
One to two collabs...

610
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,040
Per...

611
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,560
Per week.

612
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,840
And that's gonna...

613
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,780
I know I actually...

614
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,180
Put two content warning streams.

615
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,400
But I was just like...

616
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,680
You know what?

617
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,240
I wanna be able to play with all the different people.

618
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,700
You know?

619
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,720
I wanna be able to...

620
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,840
Hang out with...

621
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,540
A bunch of different people next week.

622
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,840
So I set up two...

623
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,320
Two content warning streams.

624
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:19,880
Um...

625
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,580
Um...

626
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,200
I don't know.

627
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,460
I don't know what to say.

628
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,020
What else?

629
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,660
What else?

630
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,060
Okay.

631
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,000
Shout out Colossus.

632
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,240
Also next week...

633
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,900
We're gonna...

634
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,820
I...

635
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,800
Can I say bring back?

636
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,380
I guess...

637
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:28,620
I...

638
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:28,780
I...

639
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,340
I mean...

640
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:29,980
I guess...

641
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,380
Shout out Colossus.

642
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,540
For members...

643
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,400
For members...

644
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,180
I'm bringing back the...

645
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,520
Commissions are open.

646
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,460
I'm gonna draw your icon horribly.

647
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,540
But if you've like commissioned me before...

648
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,320
Um...

649
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,700
The...

650
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,120
The...

651
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,560
Draw your icon horribly.

652
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,120
If you could like...

653
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,920
Let me know.

654
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,780
Like...

655
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,620
Tell me what you... let me know.

656
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,620
Like, I'm gonna make a members post and just...

657
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,820
Just tell me if you commissioned me before it still stands.

658
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,360
Because if I haven't drawn your icon yet, it still stands.

659
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:01,920
Like...

660
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,300
Obviously, I don't have access to like the archive of it anymore.

661
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,160
But like, if you commissioned me for an icon...

662
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,220
And you're from the... from before.

663
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,940
The before four times.

664
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,680
Don't worry, in the members post, just fucking...

665
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,540
Like...

666
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,740
Like, find a way to let me know.

667
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,860
We're gonna do honor system.

668
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,240
Because I know you dragoons have honor, right?

669
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,300
You guys... you guys have honor, right?

670
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,220
We're doing a sequel.

671
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,580
I just so have...

672
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,860
We're back by popular demand.

673
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,340
We're doing a sequel.

674
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,960
Da da da da da da.

675
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,820
Ba ba da ba da ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

676
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

677
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,520
Um...

678
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,200
Yeah, anyway.

679
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,360
So, I'm bringing that back next week.

680
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,540
If you haven't got an icon for me.

681
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,360
And I'll keep it open for future... for new dragoons too.

682
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,700
So, uh... for new dragoons as well.

683
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,120
If you guys want an icon.

684
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,960
Um... it will be open for that as well.

685
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,400
Um...

686
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,500
Let's see.

687
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:23,920
What else?

688
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,820
What else do I want to update you guys on?

689
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,680
I think that's like majority of my updates.

690
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,460
I think like next week is a bit more chill.

691
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,120
Because of the fact that... uh...

692
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,280
Uh... I'm not doing as much next week.

693
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,120
It's just collabs.

694
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,540
There's not really any events or stuff I'm participating in.

695
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,480
Or anything.

696
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,680
I still can't believe Twitch asked me to headline a Roblox Twitch Rivals.

697
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,200
I think that's like the funniest shit ever.

698
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,110
I thought that was so...

699
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,950
I thought that was like...

700
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,830
So fucking funny that...

701
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,190
That like... Twitch was like...

702
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,490
Do you wanna... Do you wanna like... be the headline for Roblox?

703
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,250
And I was like... Bro, that's so fucking funny.

704
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:04,730
I'm down.

705
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,850
I'm so... I'm so fucking... I'm so fucking down.

706
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,870
Also... um...

707
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,590
Bro, I'm having the worst time with customs.

708
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,330
Like I told you guys... Like I know all of you guys are like...

709
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,050
Oh my god, PC fun.

710
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,990
Doki, PC fun.

711
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,130
Like... I'm supposed to have...

712
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,590
Customs been holding my PC, man.

713
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,670
I was like... Oh my god!

714
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,990
Yay!

715
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:34,650
PC!

716
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,070
I was gonna be like so hyped.

717
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:36,970
Cause I'll be like...

718
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,530
Guys!

719
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,430
Finally!

720
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,250
After you complained about my PC!

721
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,650
My new PC!

722
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,550
It's been stuck in customs.

723
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,450
Please!

724
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,850
I... I checked the track.

725
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,010
I checked the tracking every fucking day.

726
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,190
I checked the tracking every fucking day.

727
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,990
And it's still in the goddamn warehouse.

728
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,790
Like release my PC!

729
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,050
Every day I check the fucking customs!

730
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,130
So yes, the reason why my PC is still fucked up...

731
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,670
Is because... um...

732
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,390
Is because, you know...

733
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,150
They... they're... I'm waiting.

734
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,530
I'm wait... Don't worry guys.

735
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,370
I'm waiting.

736
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,950
I'm waiting just like all of you.

737
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,390
Fucking Canada, man.

738
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,290
Oh!

739
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,130
Also...

740
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,470
I wanted to talk about this.

741
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,850
But like...

742
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,190
Did you guys know you can cheese gacha now?

743
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,350
I did not realize this at all.

744
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,270
But apparently like...

745
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,690
People have figured out...

746
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,710
You can cheese like...

747
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,490
Not like digital gacha.

748
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,350
But like linebox gacha.

749
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,610
You know like those like merch...

750
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,590
Like figure gacha.

751
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,350
Um... I wanna give you guys a shout out.

752
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,090
I'm gonna give you guys a little life hack.

753
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,430
And like...

754
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,450
So like if you wanna get a blind box...

755
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,810
Or like a figure or anything...

756
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,390
If you look underneath the...

757
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,690
If you look at the box's serial numbers...

758
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,530
It's like...

759
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,310
Uh... different numbers and stuff.

760
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,370
So like...

761
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,490
The serial numbers underneath...

762
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,630
Or like any numbers that's on a box...

763
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,010
Or like any on the like blind box and stuff...

764
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,830
Correlates to specific figure.

765
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,470
Or like a specific items.

766
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,590
So like...

767
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,350
You don't have to...

768
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,190
It's not random.

769
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,030
It's actually not random.

770
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:11,770
Hahaha!

771
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,870
I think I've...

772
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,750
I learned that on a YouTube short.

773
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,810
I learned that from YouTube shorts guys.

774
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,590
Uh...

775
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,390
Uh...

776
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,230
Uh...

777
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,890
But like basically...

778
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,390
If you...

779
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,190
So you don't get...

780
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,030
You don't have to be blind.

781
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:36,950
You don't have to...

782
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,930
It won't be blind anymore.

783
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,410
It's real!

784
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,510
It's actually real!

785
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,990
If you want to do...

786
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,470
If you...

787
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,610
If you want to like do like IRL gacha...

788
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,170
Or like figure gacha and stuff like that...

789
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,350
Or like blind boxes...

790
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,110
All the stuff...

791
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,810
Like all the code...

792
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,210
There's like...

793
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,370
Just like the codes correlate to the figure.

794
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,870
So like if you don't want...

795
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,690
You're worried you're gonna get like duplicate...

796
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,730
If you're worried you're getting duplicate...

797
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,190
You can like just like look at the boxes underneath...

798
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,870
And then like just make sure it's just the different numbers...

799
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,830
So you don't have to...

800
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,470
You won't get like a double...

801
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,770
Double blind box.

802
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:06,730
Um...

803
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:09,490
Will there be any more questions?

804
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:14,990
Will there be a discord server for the dragoons to hang out with each other and get Doki scuf updates on the PC customs in the future?

805
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,050
McDowell!

806
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,390
Thank you for the super chat!

807
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,010
Thank you!

808
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,630
Thank you!

809
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,610
I mean there's unofficial discord...

810
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:20,830
Uh...

811
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,410
I just need you guys...

812
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:21,810
Uh...

813
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,530
Regarding discords...

814
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,470
I know like a lot of people are always asking me like...

815
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,690
Oh Doki when will you ever have like a discord server?

816
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,610
Um...

817
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,210
I'm never going to have an official discord server.

818
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,890
I know this is like a really a twitch thing...

819
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:37,650
But like my substitute for a discord server is like YouTube members.

820
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,010
Um...

821
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,610
The reason why I don't have a discord server is because like I learned...

822
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:44,950
Um...

823
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:45,490
When you have...

824
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,170
When you have like...

825
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:46,670
Okay like...

826
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:46,990
Uh...

827
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,510
I know like when I first started when I was like you know four years ago I did have my own discord server four years ago.

828
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,770
But I was like really small.

829
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,150
I was a really small streamer and I was on twitch.

830
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:55,970
I got...

831
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,130
I was on twitch so...

832
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:57,990
Um...

833
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,090
Like it's more known for like twitch streamers to have discord servers.

834
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,290
But the reason why I don't do that...

835
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,310
I don't do that now...

836
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,790
Um...

837
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:12,790
I use my member stream as like the equivalent of a discord server with the things I do on members.

838
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,110
So I do post like updates.

839
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,590
I do post updates.

840
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,390
I do post like um...

841
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:18,930
Um...

842
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:19,490
Like...

843
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,050
Uh...

844
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,450
You know like I do like exclusive streams on members and stuff like that.

845
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,650
But the reason why is that um...

846
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,770
I think like a year ago um...

847
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,850
I joined some...

848
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,190
I think like a year and a half ago I joined somebody's like official server.

849
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,770
Like uh...

850
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,490
For a collab.

851
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,450
I think like you guys might remember this.

852
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,590
This is like old lore.

853
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,370
Um...

854
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:46,590
And then I got so many random people messaging me and sending me friend requests uh...

855
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,470
To that account.

856
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,110
And like I was like wait this is not smart for...

857
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,450
That's why I don't...

858
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,690
I don't want to have...

859
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,210
I don't do official discord servers.

860
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,290
Because like it's just gonna mess up my discord even more.

861
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:05,530
I...

862
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,090
I get like...

863
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:11,030
Every day I wake up to like um...

864
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,450
Uh...

865
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:18,490
Every day I wake up to like 16 plus work messages every day from like different people.

866
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,770
And I really cannot have that get cleared.

867
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,970
I hate...

868
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,490
I...

869
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,330
I hate...

870
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,530
Like I really cannot like have more messages and friend requests.

871
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:31,990
It's also...

872
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,270
The reason why also is cause like my friend...

873
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,050
Like um...

874
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,790
I also like don't really uh...

875
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,510
Uh...

876
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,330
Close my friend requests and stuff.

877
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:41,810
Um...

878
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,550
Or like not close.

879
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:42,890
I...

880
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,870
I make sure my...

881
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,970
My friend requests...

882
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,490
Like it's still like private in some way for friend requests.

883
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,970
But like it's not like super close.

884
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,490
Because like um...

885
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:51,870
When I...

886
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,410
I do like work business stuff.

887
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,910
Like behind the scenes work stuff.

888
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,770
I just be like just add me.

889
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,270
I'll just be like just add me.

890
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,330
Because it's just easier.

891
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,070
And I need to be sure that like uh...

892
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,170
Uh...

893
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:08,810
I just need to be sure that my communication with like people when it comes to business things would be okay.

894
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,450
When I separate account cause logging on and off for two.

895
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,070
I...

896
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,410
I don't...

897
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,590
I don't like dealing with...

898
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,470
I mean I used to deal with more than one account.

899
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,990
But like it's just simpler with everything in one area for me.

900
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,870
Because I already have a lot of stuff going on.

901
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,010
That's why...

902
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,270
That's why I don't have an official server.

903
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,050
An official Discord server.

904
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,710
Because a lot of my communication with work stuff and business stuff is on Discord.

905
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,750
I don't have a Slack or anything anymore.

906
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,810
So it's mostly on Discord and email.

907
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,890
So it's just so much easier just not being on an official server.

908
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,790
But we do have fan servers.

909
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,910
We do have fan servers though.

910
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:09,270
So if you guys still want to join a Doki Bird fan server, that's still...

911
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,490
They do a lot of projects.

912
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,650
I know they do a lot of projects.

913
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,690
They did a Stinger project recently.

914
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,470
But on April Fools.

915
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:21,630
I was just so busy that I haven't retweeted it or added my Stingers.

916
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,770
But it's so cute!

917
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,830
Did you guys see it?

918
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,650
They did like a Stinger project.

919
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,050
Oh my god.

920
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,930
Let me see if I can look it up.

921
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,170
I'm trying to remember what it was called.

922
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,770
Okay, Stinger...

923
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,070
Stinger...

924
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:36,850
Dragoon.

925
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,590
Is that it?

926
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,790
Stinger... Dragoon...

927
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,290
Okay, Doki Bird.

928
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,470
Maybe that's it.

929
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,170
I'm pretty sure my fucking mods will find this faster than me.

930
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,730
I found it!

931
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,390
Guys, it's so cute!

932
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,570
Wait, is this an introduction on how...

933
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,310
This is a guide on how to do it.

934
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,090
Guys, look at this.

935
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,590
Okay, never mind.

936
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,330
My mod did it.

937
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,070
I'm going to do it.

938
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,350
Nice.

939
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,330
My mod did the job for me.

940
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:06,910
Yay!

941
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,410
Don't worry.

942
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,250
Next stream...

943
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,410
No, not next stream.

944
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,130
The stream after next stream.

945
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,870
Because I'm too fucking...

946
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,410
The next stream is like Challenger Circuit.

947
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,170
So like, I really don't think I have the energy to add...

948
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,850
To add the Stinger by then.

949
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:27,690
Oh my god.

950
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,790
I really don't have the energy.

951
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,290
I'm really excited.

952
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,250
There's so many stuff going on.

953
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,830
Every... every day.

954
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,090
There's a lot of like...

955
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,450
Events...

956
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,270
That are like... being planned.

957
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,790
There's a lot of...

958
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,950
There's a lot of collaborations.

959
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,810
There's also a lot of like...

960
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,270
Business deals and stuff being planned.

961
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,210
And everything.

962
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,910
And I'm so excited when...

963
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,830
It all...

964
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,770
Finally goes... like...

965
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,570
When things start going live.

966
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,890
I'm super excited.

967
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,090
I wish I could do more projects for you dragoons too.

968
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:03,670
Like just...

969
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,410
Just solely for you dragoons type deal.

970
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,550
Like... like... in the past.

971
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,010
And obviously a lot of those take time.

972
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,750
Because I need to build like the infrastructure for everything.

973
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,930
And like building the infrastructure for everything.

974
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,510
And building a lot of stuff.

975
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,510
For...

976
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,250
To like be able to create new content.

977
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,630
And create like new things for dragoons.

978
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,750
And it's...

979
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,830
It's taking time.

980
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,270
It takes time.

981
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,730
But what are you guys looking forward to?

982
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,390
Like what would you guys like to see?

983
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,330
Or like to have?

984
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,010
Like...

985
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,090
The Minecraft server for members.

986
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,350
They said it'll take a few more weeks.

987
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,270
Few more weeks to do.

988
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:47,970
So...

989
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,670
And...

990
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:52,830
And...

991
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,290
It's just like...

992
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:55,750
We just...

993
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,750
It just takes time.

994
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,970
It just takes time.

995
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,090
It takes a lot of time.

996
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,610
To build everything up.

997
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,010
Oh my gosh.

998
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,450
My energy is slowly dying.

999
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,810
I think my adrenaline is wearing off.

1000
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:11,810
My...

1001
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,010
My...

1002
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,270
My adrenaline...

1003
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,450
Is like...

1004
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,030
Is like slowly fucking wearing off.

1005
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,630
After...

1006
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,630
After everything.

1007
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,610
I'm just super chill now.

1008
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,070
Uh...

1009
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,430
Hahaha.

1010
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,510
Everything's shutting down.

1011
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,550
I think it's because I didn't get a lot of sleep.

1012
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,630
I didn't get a lot of sleep.

1013
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,350
I took a nap before the JP Tournament.

1014
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,110
And then I had to work a little bit.

1015
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,990
And then I took another nap again.

1016
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,650
And then...

1017
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,930
And then after that nap.

1018
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:41,810
I stayed up too.

1019
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,910
I worked for like four hours straight.

1020
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,710
For the karaoke stuff.

1021
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,930
Like the last minute prep for the...

1022
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,850
My pilot...

1023
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,570
My pilot test for the karaoke.

1024
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:51,830
Haha.

1025
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,510
Haha.

1026
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,070
I'm trying...

1027
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,150
But anyway, this is a short after party.

1028
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,730
It's a really short after party, I apologize.

1029
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,870
But I realize I'm crashing right now.

1030
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,590
I'm crashing.

1031
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,930
At this point I'm like, oh no.

1032
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,230
I'm feeling the crash.

1033
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,530
Doki's feeling the crash right now.

1034
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,390
She's sinking.

1035
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,750
But thank you everybody.

1036
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,510
I really enjoyed hanging out with all you guys today.

1037
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:34,190
And I really enjoyed having that fun karaoke session with everybody.

1038
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:39,590
And I hope you guys enjoyed the work everyone put into it.

1039
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,530
And I hope you enjoyed the fucking scuff too.

1040
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,470
The enormous amount of scuff there.

1041
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,830
But you guys all have fun and that's all that matters.

1042
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,550
I'm gonna go pass out.

1043
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,730
I'm gonna eat dinner and pass out.

1044
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,110
So...

1045
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,890
I wanted to have a longer chat up with all of you.

1046
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,290
But I think I'm actually...

1047
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,590
My energy level is like skydiving right now.

1048
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,130
It's actually going through...

1049
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,470
It's actually nose diving.

1050
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,090
But thank you all.

1051
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,310
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

1052
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,110
Posture check.

1053
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,790
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1054
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,110
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

1055
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,550
Because we all deserve it.

1056
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,950
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

1057
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,230
Bye guys.

1058
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,370
Bye.

1059
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,410
Bye.

1060
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:22,730
Bye.

1061
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:23,710
Bye.
