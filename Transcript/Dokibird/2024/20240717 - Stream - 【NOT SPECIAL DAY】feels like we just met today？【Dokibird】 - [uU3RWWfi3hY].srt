1
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,530
I just need you guys to know we were dancing to the opening.

2
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,490
Okay, wait, you don't like it when you see my wings.

3
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,770
It's a little freaky.

4
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,810
Yeah, that's...

5
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:47,310
We were dancing to the opening, so that's why it took us so long, guys.

6
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,970
We were busy dancing to the opening.

7
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,350
Yeah, I'm sorry.

8
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,150
Sorry, we were...

9
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,290
For like 15 minutes.

10
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,310
Yeah, for like 15...

11
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,030
Wait, wait, get closer.

12
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,910
Look how fucking huge she is compared to me.

13
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,370
Okay, but when I came in, you were so...

14
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,290
Okay, that's true, that's true.

15
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,570
I was like...

16
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,090
I was like this.

17
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,890
I was like this.

18
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,070
Holy crap.

19
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,870
Oh my god.

20
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,130
Damn.

21
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,090
That's terrifying.

22
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,850
This is IRL height difference right there.

23
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,830
Actually, you should be a little bit shorter.

24
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,470
You are...

25
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,630
No, okay.

26
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,730
That's a dramatization.

28
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,950
I feel like I'm in danger.

29
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,690
Good.

30
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,470
Don't make me put you in the box.

31
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,030
I'll put you in the box.

32
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,210
I'll put you in the box.

33
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,890
One at a time.

34
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,930
Why does my vision go black when I'm close to the box?

35
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,430
Yeah, it's programmed so you can't see anything if you're in the box.

36
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:45,930
Oh my god!

37
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,530
It's my special box.

38
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,730
I think I'm addicted.

39
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,770
I'm addicted to the special box.

40
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,330
Yeah.

41
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,710
How's the volume, guys?

42
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,130
How's the volume, chat?

43
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,730
So far.

44
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,110
Let me be tiny again.

45
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,290
I feel too big in this form.

46
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,610
Be tiny so I can squish you.

47
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,810
I can kick you in the shins.

48
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,550
I can punch you in the face.

49
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,950
I can kick you in the face.

50
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,210
Oh wait, I'm like perfect.

51
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,950
I'm like perfect.

52
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,250
Why are you doing that?

53
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,310
Why are you poking my belly button?

54
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,790
Your arms are too short.

55
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,310
You can't even raise them up.

56
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,110
I don't need to raise them up.

57
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,990
Raise me up.

58
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,870
I don't need to raise them up.

59
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,630
I don't need to raise them up.

60
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,370
You jump really high.

61
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,210
Hey guys, today is not a special day.

62
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,310
It's just a normal day.

63
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,670
It's a normal day.

64
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,270
It's a normal day, guys.

65
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,430
We do have an announcement together.

66
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,010
But other than that, it's just a normal day.

67
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,270
Huge shout out to Mint.

68
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,710
Because like, literally I asked her yesterday if she could do this.

69
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,210
And she...

70
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,750
And I was just like, okay.

71
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,090
And then she uploaded her video.

72
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,070
And then she posted it on her VRChat model.

73
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,490
Like, what was it?

74
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,310
An hour before?

75
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,130
10 minutes ago.

76
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,990
10 minutes ago!

77
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,810
Yeah, yeah.

78
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,450
She got it.

79
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,610
Got it under 10 minutes.

80
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,970
We had to message VRChat staff and be like, we don't know what to do.

81
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,370
I don't know what to do.

82
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,730
VRChat staff, help us.

83
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,070
You know what?

84
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,630
The worst part is I finally got it.

85
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:29,950
Yeah.

86
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,710
It was like, maybe a minute after, or a minute before they uploaded it for me.

87
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,210
Oh, what?

88
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,110
So I have a backup.

89
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,690
Oh, so that's good.

90
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,190
That's good.

91
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,770
You have a backup.

92
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,230
But they were so helpful.

93
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,630
Thank you, VRChat team.

94
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,910
Thank you, VRChat team.

95
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,510
They gave us free stuff.

96
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,550
We have like, membership now.

97
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,450
What was it called though?

98
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,370
They gave us like, VR Plus.

99
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,050
Yeah, we got VR Plus!

100
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,150
Yay!

101
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,530
We love free stuff.

102
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:58,550
VRChat Plus.

103
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,910
I don't know what we can do with it, but like, it's free, so that's all that matters.

104
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,250
You know?

105
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,590
Free stuff!

106
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,910
Yay!

107
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,810
I'm actually jumping.

108
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,730
No, it doesn't track it!

109
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,750
I need to raise you up a little bit.

110
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,290
Is it voices?

111
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,530
I'm gonna raise you up a little bit higher.

112
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,010
75%.

113
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,190
Oh yeah, we wanna take you to Chickentopia.

114
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,010
We're gonna be exploring VRChat worlds.

115
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:35,370
Chickentopia!

116
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,030
Yeah, we don't have to worry about copyright.

117
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,570
I know you took them to like, the snake place.

118
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,690
Metal Gear Solid places.

119
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,070
Oh yeah, I took them to Metal Gear Solid last time.

120
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,150
Yeah, wait, the snake place.

121
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,110
The snake place.

122
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,070
Yeah, the snake place!

123
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,570
There's like, snakes in the water.

124
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,130
There's like, snakes in the water.

125
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,370
Wait, you had it open, right?

126
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,010
Chickentopia?

127
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,550
Yeah, I can put that up for us.

128
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,990
Yeah, I saw it on my Twitter For You page.

129
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,330
It was like, basically we raise chickens and we put them in a box and then we send them up into the air.

130
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,290
To die, I guess.

131
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,630
Chicken heaven?

132
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,590
Yeah, where they go to chicken heaven!

133
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,150
They're gonna go to chicken heaven!

134
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,890
Like, all dogs go to heaven!

135
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,050
Oh!

136
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,450
That's...

137
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,910
Okay.

138
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,970
What do you mean?

139
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,010
Drop a portal.

140
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,950
There ya'll!

141
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,590
Yay!

142
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,150
See ya there!

143
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,510

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,690
Sorry, I have to like...

145
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,070
Technical difficulties, but here we go!

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,010
Here we go!

147
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,450

148
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,330
Yay!

149
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,610
This is a normal day!

150
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,250
Just a normal streaming day!

151
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,610
Oh, I need to be a bit louder.

152
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,430
Okay.

153
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,190
Let me double check.

154
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,210
Whoa!

155
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,190
That's my face!

156
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,930
Is that my face?

157
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,950
Oh, that is!

158
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,110
Okay, let me put myself a little louder.

159
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,330
Okay.

160
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,770
Have you ever been here before?

161
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,250
Whoa!

162
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,150
No, I haven't.

163
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,790
Looks real- Whoa!

164
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,670
This looks amazing!

165
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,470
It looks crazy!

166
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:16,890
Yeah!

167
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,930
Okay, you guys can't see it.

168
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,130
There's a lot of birds!

169
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,210
Oh my god!

170
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,190
Guys, look!

171
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,150
Oh, the lighting changes everything!

172
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,530
Wait, that's so cool!

173
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,110
Whoa!

174
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,570
Okay, let me get my...

175
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,470
There's birds everywhere!

176
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,390
Where's the camera?

177
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,450
It's right in front of you!

178
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,130
Oh, it is?

179
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,350
I'm literally holding it!

180
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,470
No, no, not that one!

181
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,510
The pin one!

182
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,310
Okay, anchor.

183
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,330
Oh, I forgot!

184
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,270
You have to like...

185
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,070
Put like this thing here.

186
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,750
The local.

187
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,730
You are so close!

188
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,850
I wanna take a screenshot!

189
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,150
Stop!

190
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,770
Stop taking screenshots!

191
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,330
No!

192
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,930
There we are.

193
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,690
Oh my god, look at that!

194
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,770
Look, oh my god!

195
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,210
Look at the shading on this!

196
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:08,590
Oh my god.

197
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:08,590
Yeah.

198
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,210
I know, it's beautiful!

199
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,050
Yeah, it's so crazy!

200
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,650
Okay, let's see.

201
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,390
Behavior.

202
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,510
Don't look at me.

203
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,970
Okay, don't...

204
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,310
Maybe?

205
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,010
I can't...

206
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,410
Mint, I'm not very good at this.

207
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,210
I'm not...

208
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,910
You have done behavior change so many times!

209
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,490
They keep...

210
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,670
They keep updating it!

211
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,590
It's not my fault!

212
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,470
They keep updating it!

213
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,110
Okay, hold on.

214
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,130
I'm opening up stream camera.

215
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,170
What are you looking for?

216
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,770
What's the problem?

217
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,510
I don't know.

218
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,590
What's the perfect, you know, angle?

219
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,370
The perfect camera angle?

220
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,450
I always...

221
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,710
I put it behind me.

222
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,230
I put it behind me and then they get to like watch me.

223
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,870
Oh!

224
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,710
See?

225
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,610
You're so smart.

226
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,110
It's like they're traveling with us.

227
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:56,650
Yeah!

228
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,450
It's like POV.

229
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,610
You know like that one with the girl and then she holds her hands out like this?

230
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,090
And then you're like holding her hand and you're like, Yeah, let's go travel.

231
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,410
Like that.

232
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,490
You remember that YouTube video?

233
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

234
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,110
Yeah!

235
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,870
Are you gonna hold the dragoon's hands?

236
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,010
Yeah, that's where they'll get cooties.

237
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,930
Okay, I think you need to let it...

238
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,850
Okay, so...

239
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,290
You need to like...

240
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,970
There's like...

241
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,710
It's too close.

242
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,870
All I see is your head.

243
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,110
Okay.

244
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,090
Alright.

245
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,290
Hold my hand!

246
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,710
Get the cooties!

247
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,270
And now you can't even see me!

248
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,950
Yay!

249
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,650
We did it!

250
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,970
Oh, there you go.

251
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

252
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,110
And then I put it local after that.

253
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,790
And then... Yeah!

254
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,510
We did it, guys.

255
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,870
We did it.

256
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,510
We're so good at this.

257
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,970
Let's go get some chicken!

258
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,350
Oh my gosh, wait.

259
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,950
Wait.

260
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:55,970
Where's the chicken?

261
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,010
Right here.

262
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,190
Over here!

263
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,170
Oh my god!

264
00:10:59,310 --> 00:10:59,670
Hey!

265
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,050
Wait.

266
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,030
I need to fix the camera.

267
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,830
Where did the camera go?

268
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,210
Oh, there!

269
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,490
Why is the camera over there?

270
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,810
Oh my god!

271
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,150
What?

272
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,580
Fuck!

273
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,700
Okay, let me put the camera like...

274
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh my god!

275
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,220
Oh my god!

276
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,420
There's a flying bitch!

277
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,740
Where is she going?

278
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,340
Where is she going?

279
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,760
Where is she...

280
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,980
Oh my god!

281
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,320
Oh my god!

282
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,680
Oh my god!

283
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:33,720
Okay.

284
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,500
What the fuck?

285
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
Did you see that?

286
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,880
Did you see that?

287
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,800
Oh my god, that was crazy.

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,240
That was crazy.

289
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,060
Okay, I need to figure...

290
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,100
I'm gonna burn it!

291
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,520
Wooo!

292
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,740
Wooo!

293
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,710
It's the simple things.

294
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:54,990
It's the simple things.

295
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,130
I think I'm gonna throw up.

296
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,210
I think I'm gonna throw up.

297
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,510
Where did the camera go?

298
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,530
I lost the camera!

299
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,070
It's right here!

300
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,810
It's right here!

301
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,750
Oh, it is!

302
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,470
It's right here!

303
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,750
Hello guys.

304
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,450
Do you guys have...

305
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,290
You're the one who made this!

306
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,710
You're my transparent!

307
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,770
I think the...

308
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,470
The like fish eye lens on it.

309
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:19,470
I'm a little special.

310
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,250
It's kinda crazy.

311
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,030
There's a fish eye lens on it?

312
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,530
Yeah, I think so.

313
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,750
Oh my god.

314
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,870
I lost it again.

315
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,690
Oh, there it is!

316
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,170
I see it!

317
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,170
It's right...

318
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,870
Oh my god!

319
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,150
It's so hard to see it!

320
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,970
It's right there!

321
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,230
It's so hard!

322
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,150
It's right there!

323
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,650
It's so hot!

324
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,470
Oh, there's old!

325
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,650
Old timey.

326
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,370
We're in the old time west.

327
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,590
Oh my god.

328
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,690
Wait, they have new...

329
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,290
They have like new filters and everything.

330
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,290
They have like new filters and everything.

331
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,250
Oh, I see it in sepia.

332
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:55,690
Wow.

333
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,110
Yeah, yeah, like...

334
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,830
The speed's always been there.

335
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,590
I remember the speed.

336
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,990
But like...

337
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,410
They have the...

338
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,930
I know like the old one was new.

339
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,590
I know like the...

340
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,050
This was new.

341
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:09,370
What?

342
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,850
Do you wanna say that again?

343
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,370
The old one?

344
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,970
It's literally titled old!

345
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,530
OOOHHHH!

346
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,910
Whoa!

347
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,170
There's a...

348
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,410
There's a trippy...

349
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,550
There's a trippy filter.

350
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,810
Have you seen the trippy filter?

351
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,590
There is?

352
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

353
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:30,790
Oh!

354
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,490
Your head!

355
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,160
We're like a little...

356
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,400
We're like kids at the carnival.

357
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,740
With the wall of hair.

358
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,500
We're like...

359
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:48,660
We're already...

360
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,820
We're already...

361
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,260
And then there's...

362
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Oh, there's the sparkle.

363
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,800
I don't like the sparkle as much though.

364
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,620
I think the trippy one was my favorite.

365
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960
Okay guys, I figured it out.

366
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,900
I figured out how to use the camera.

367
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,860
Guys, okay.

368
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,220
She figured it out.

369
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,180
I figured it out.

370
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,780
Wait, why does it follow me?

371
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,880
Like in the back.

372
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,060
It doesn't follow me in the back.

373
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,420
What do you mean?

374
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,000
Like when I move the camera...

375
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
Oh wait, no.

376
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,280
I have to move my...

377
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,900
myself.

378
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,200
And then...

379
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,580
Wait, no?

380
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,880
Is the camera...

381
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,400
Are you okay?

382
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,040
Yeah, okay.

383
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,640
So if I look at this way, do you see my back?

384
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,180
Uh...

385
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,560
Uh, yeah, yeah.

386
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah!

387
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
I figured it out!

388
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,320
I figured it out!

389
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,100
Alright, we did it guys.

390
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,720
Okay.

391
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,180
Now we can check out the chickens.

392
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,940
Yeah, we did it guys.

393
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
We can check out the chickens.

394
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
Alright, here's...

395
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,920
Oh, it's on your front again, but that's okay.

396
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,640
That's okay.

397
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,520
Alright.

398
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,600
Why is the...

399
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,660
Wait, so we take a chicken?

400
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,720
Yeah, we take a chicken.

401
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

402
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,480
We put it in a box?

403
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Oh my god.

404
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,840
And then if...

405
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,380
Oh my god.

406
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,600
What if I'm also in the box?

407
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,920
Wait, send me out!

408
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,840
And then we press the button.

409
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,780
We press the...

410
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,600
We press this.

411
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,620
Okay.

412
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,840
Sell it.

413
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,020
Why are we selling the...

414
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,220

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,980
VINCE!

418
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,840
Holy shit!

419
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,480
Wait, I wanna get a chicken.

420
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,860
Alright, dragons.

421
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,360
I'm gonna grab you.

422
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
This is you.

423
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,520
We're gonna sell you.

424
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,180
We're gonna sell you dragons.

425
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,980
We're off to...

426
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,360
Off to heaven you go!

427
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,560
Off to heaven!

428
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,140
You're getting...

429
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,940
You're getting... getting into heaven!

430
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,860
Oh my god.

431
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,020
I can't get on the box.

432
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,320
I can't...

433
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,660
No!

434
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,720
I have a special chicken buck.

435
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,820
Alright, can you put this in?

436
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,540
There you go.

437
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,460
Down you go.

438
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,060
Goodbye.

439
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,640
Goodbye everybody!

440
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,130
Oh my god.

441
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,570
I'm so far out.

442
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,330
Holy...

443
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,970
I'm so far out.

444
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,470
Holy...

445
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,560
Oh my god.

446
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,200
Yeah, you can...

447
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
You can spend more money to get more chickens.

448
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,400
Get more dragons.

449
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:25,940
Oh!

450
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940
Wait, I have a...

451
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,560
Wait.

452
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,500
Wait, how did you get the money?

453
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,100
I earned it.

454
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,200
I earned it.

455
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Later!

456
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Look at her go.

457
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,320
Look at her go.

458
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,220
There is my camera.

459
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm paying... I'm paying you.

460
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,500
Oh, I got it.

461
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,600
No no no no.

462
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:44,960
Come on.

463
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,240
Oh!

464
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:46,860
Whoa!

465
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,680
Oh my god.

466
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,800
It says don't forget to feed the chickens.

467
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,480
Do we...

468
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,440
Do we need to feed them?

469
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,500
No we don't.

470
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,200
I don't know.

471
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,500
I think we have to.

472
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,180
Did you get it?

473
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,600
Redeem!

474
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,760
Click it.

475
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,060
Hold on I have to push the...

476
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,620
I'm trying!

477
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,000
I think we're too short for this.

478
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,800
You gotta be this height.

479
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,620
You gotta be this height.

480
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:05,840
I got him!

481
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,700
What is this?

482
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,200
Oh that's to feed the chickens!

483
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,360
It's an apple!

484
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,000
Wait but where are the chickens?

485
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,800
Wait don't get...

486
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,300
Wait we got rid of our chickens.

487
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,580
We got rid of all our chickens.

488
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,260
Wait I think...

489
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,140
I think we were supposed to breed the two chickens we have.

490
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,260
I think we were supposed to...

491
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,240
We...

492
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,560
We saw them.

493
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,380
We saw them.

494
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,400
We know what happened.

495
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,820
I thought...

496
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,960
Ellie didn't stand.

497
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,020
I thought we had more chickens.

498
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,400
I thought...

499
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,020
I thought it would give us chickens.

500
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,480
I didn't realize we have to breed them.

501
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,460
We can go find more.

502
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,560
There's probably a ton of chickens out there.

503
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,020
Oh no.

504
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,780
I don't...

505
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,520
Barrel chickens.

506
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,580
I don't see any chickens around.

507
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,720
Here let's go on the bus.

508
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,500
Let's go on the bus.

509
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,260
Okay.

510
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,440
Okay.

511
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,680
Yeah.

512
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,880
The bus.

513
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,600
Wait.

514
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:53,860
What?

515
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,860
There's a chicken!

516
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,200
Oh!

517
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,860
There's a chicken!

518
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,580
It's a purple chicken!

519
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,080
Wait!

520
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,320
It came out of the apple!

521
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:00,980
Yeah!

522
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,120
It came out of the apple!

523
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,720
Wait!

524
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,340
Is that where chickens come from?

525
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,020
Where's our camera so you can...

526
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,660
There it is.

527
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,840
Yeah I'm showing it.

528
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,260
I'm showing it.

529
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,720
Look!

530
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,720
A chicken came out of apples!

531
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,940
Guys every time you eat an apple you eat a chicken.

532
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,560
That's right vegetarians.

533
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,960
You are not a real vegetarian because you eat apples.

534
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,740
He died!

535
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,180
Oh!

536
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,980
Wait okay he's fine.

537
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,080
Oh no does he grow up?

538
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,780
He... if you drop him he smushes.

539
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:26,920
Watch.

540
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,420
Ugh!

541
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,660
Wait.

542
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:30,920
No.

543
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,620
Ugh!

544
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,560
Oh!

545
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,880
It made a sound!

546
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,040
What the fuck!

547
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,560
Like...

548
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,360
He gets really small, huh?

549
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:41,640
Yeah!

550
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,420
Can you like smush it with your hands?

551
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,640
I think I stepped on him earlier.

552
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,260
Oh see!

553
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:47,940
I smushed him.

554
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,840
Yeah you smush him.

555
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,420
Wait can we get another one?

556
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,160
Do we have more money?

557
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,580
Oh!

558
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,740
Yeah we have more money.

559
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,380
It made the sound.

560
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,440
Where'd the money go?

561
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Yeah where's the money go?

562
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,560
Wait where'd the money go?

563
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,320
Where'd the money go?

564
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,640
There was the money.

565
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,340
You...

566
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,640
You...

567
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,660
There was another money.

568
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,480
Where's the money?

569
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,020
Doki what'd you do?

570
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,280
What did I do?

571
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,220
Doki, Doki where's the money?

572
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,920
What do you mean?

573
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,320
All I do is send chickens out of there!

574
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:12,680
Oh!

575
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,500
All I do is send the chickens up in the air!

576
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,140
Doki where's the money?

577
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,420
I don't know!

578
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,040
I can't see you!

579
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,600
I don't know!

580
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,200
Did we fuck up?

581
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,620
Where's my money?

582
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,440
Did we fuck up the world?

583
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,120
Did we mess it up?

584
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,900
Oh I found it!

585
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,400
I found it!

586
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,120
Oh okay.

587
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,540
Alright.

588
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:36,960
Okay.

589
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,880
POV.

590
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,480
And redeem.

591
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,540
You are the machine that she redeems from.

592
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,520
Oh we're gonna get a mushroom monkey!

593
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,260
Oh!

594
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,800
I mean a monkey.

595
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,140
A monkey?

596
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,600
Oh god.

597
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,300
This is chicken-topia not mushroom-topia?

598
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,240
This is...

599
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,020
I thought it was bloons.

600
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,320
How many hours have you spent on bloons, Mint?

601
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,480
How many hours?

602
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,180
Oh god he's huge now!

603
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,860
Oh my god look!

604
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,580
Look he's big!

605
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,040
Oh my god!

606
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,560
He's so big!

607
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,520
Wait so does that mean we don't feed the chicken?

608
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,240
We just...

609
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,160
We just get...

610
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,000
More chickens?

611
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,060
We only get two?

612
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,120
No I think we feed them right?

613
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,940
Yeah we feed the mushroom to the chicken.

614
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,040
Yeah.

615
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,380
Wait where did it go?

616
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,220
Oh my god!

617
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,060
These are very toxic!

618
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,180
Alright guys I don't...

619
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,380
I think this chicken has a few medical issues.

620
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,280
Here chicken!

621
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,580
I think this chicken has medical issues.

622
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,840
Mint.

623
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,180
Eat!

624
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,060
It's on her head Mint.

625
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,880
It's like...

626
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,860
It has tumors.

627
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,040
Oh my god!

628
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,080
Gross!

629
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,560
It's on her changed.

630
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,400
I just want enough for her to eat.

631
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,300
Okay well that's more food for her.

632
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,820
It's okay I still love our son.

633
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,460
The chicken sounds!

634
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,220
Oh wait.

635
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,160
The chicken sounds.

636
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
There's an egg!

637
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,860
They made it for me!

638
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,460
We're compensate!

639
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,480
Gramp!

640
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,400
Their made an egg.

641
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,420
We're Grampons.

642
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,640
I'm gonna feed them lots.

643
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm gonna feed them so much.

644
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,500
Come on.

645
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,180
Come on.

646
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,140
More babies!

647
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,380
Oh my god!

648
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,540
What happened to the egg?

649
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,220
Oh, it's the yellow chicken!

650
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,360
Oh my god, the first thing it did was eat!

651
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,260
Wait, how did you feed it?

652
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,720
Oh my god, they're fighting!

653
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,320
They're fighting!

654
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,520
They're fighting?

655
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,980
Oh my god!

656
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,180
Don't fight!

657
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,620
They're your kind!

658
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,020
Wait, how did you get Caesar?

659
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:37,940
Come on!

660
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,560

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,000
Eat!

666
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,780
Oh shit!

667
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,400
I smushed them!

668
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,500
It's okay, they're still alive.

669
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,880
It's okay, it's okay.

670
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,600
They like it.

671
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:46,920
They like it.

672
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,260
They like it.

673
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,800
Come on!

676
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,200

Seed!

684
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,160
Where are the eggs?

685
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,040
Oh my god, he's getting really big.

686
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,720
Oh my god.

687
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,780
That guy's getting really big.

688
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,360
Wait, he is.

689
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,460
Oh my god, there's four eggs!

690
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,700
We're gonna be rich!

691
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
We're gonna be rich!

692
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,820
We're gonna be rich!

693
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,120
We have so many chickens!

694
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,560
I'm gonna feed them until they pop.

695
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,000
We've got giant chickens.

696
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,240
Get bigger chickens.

697
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,460
Oh my god.

698
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,660
We've got huge chickens.

699
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,840
Oh my god, she's going...

700
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,460
We've got the largest chickens in the world.

701
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,820
We've got the huge and giant chickens.

702
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,940
Guys, I think she's mad with power right now.

703
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,700
She's mad with power.

704
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,340
There's so many chickens.

705
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,020
Oh, there's so many.

706
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,320
There's so many.

707
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,940
Your entire body...

708
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,520
We'll never be able to feed the chickens again.

709
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,020
Your entire body is covered with chickens.

710
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,360
We'll never go hungry again!

711
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,740
We'll never go hungry!

712
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,760
We have all the chickens we can eat!

713
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,100
What are you talking about?

714
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,100
This is my army.

715
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,200
Your army.

716
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,740
I'm gonna feed them all.

717
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,680
And thus, the whiffs evolved into chickens.

718
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,240
They love me.

719
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,240
They love me.

720
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,860
Oh my god.

721
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,580
Wait.

722
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,580
Can anybody see me?

723
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,100
I'm so hungry.

724
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,400
I'm so hungry.

725
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,440
Can anybody see me?

726
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,460
Can anybody see me?

727
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,520
Do you see her?

728
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,660
Do you see...

729
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,300
It's okay!

730
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,440
She's in the pile of chickens!

731
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,240
Okay, I give up.

732
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:21,780
Oh.

733
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,320
Oh my god.

734
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,260
Look at that pink one.

735
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,380
Oh my god.

736
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:27,900
I know.

737
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,820
Alright, who should we sell first?

738
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,100
This guy.

739
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,440
Whoa.

740
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,420
Whoa.

741
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,380
Oh my god.

742
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,880
What did you do?

743
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,480
I think you...

744
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,300
Can anybody see me?

745
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,100
I'm still here.

746
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,120
Wait, did you crash the server?

747
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,000
Did you crash the server?

748
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,680
Oh my god.

749
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,220
Wait.

750
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,380
Can anybody see me?

751
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,220
I'm still here.

752
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,340
Oh my god.

753
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,100
This guy.

754
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,360
Oh, it's repeating!

755
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,060
It's repeating!

756
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,740
Oh my god.

757
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,300
Can anybody see me?

758
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm still here.

759
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,420
Oh my god.

760
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,260
This guy.

761
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,700
Oh, it's repeating, guys!

762
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,560
It's repeating!

763
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,360
Oh my god.

764
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:06,900
Can anybody see me?

765
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,060
It's repeating!

766
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,380
Oh my god.

767
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,560
Oh my god!

768
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,360
Can anybody see me?

769
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm still here!

770
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,120
Oh, look at this guy.

771
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,340
Holy shit!

772
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,640
Holy shit!

773
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,320
I'm in a loop!

774
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm stuck in a loop!

775
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm stuck in a loop!

776
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,040
Oh my god, I was stuck in a loop.

777
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,580
That was the craziest shit!

778
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,700
The crash!

779
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,240
Holy shit, that was a loop!

780
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,000
I think Mint fucking crashed the server!

781
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,340
I'm launching back up.

782
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,160
We were looping.

783
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,240
Oh my god.

784
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,960
We were looping.

785
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,260
We had too many chickens.

786
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,360
There were too many chickens!

787
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,640
Oh my god.

788
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,180
The chickenopolis apocalypse.

789
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,180
That was actually crazy.

790
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,620
I was not expecting the looping.

791
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,040
Oh, I put the volume in already.

792
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,140
Do you guys need it to be lowered even more?

793
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,620
Too many chickens.

794
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,000
I didn't realize there was a limit to how many chickens you can have.

795
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,960
I wonder if I can, like, get an invite.

796
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,260
Like, is she still in Chickentopia?

797
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,880
Is she still there?

798
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,280
Let's see...

799
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,660
Request.

800
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,980
Um...

801
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,900
Request invite.

802
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm requesting invite right now.

803
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,180
She was too powerful.

804
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,400
The chickens were just too many.

805
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,220
There was just too many chickens.

806
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,200
That was actually crazy.

807
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,600
I can't believe there was an actual limit to how many chickens you can have.

808
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,060
Oh my god.

809
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,700
There was a chicken limit.

810
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,980
Okay, don't worry.

811
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,200
We're coming back.

812
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,420
We're coming back right now.

813
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,300
Worlds.

814
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,000
Uh...

815
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,800
We're going back to Chickentopia.

816
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,620
The voice.

817
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,780
What?

818
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,720
Don't worry.

819
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,760
Don't worry.

820
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,600
It's a blackout.

821
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,840
I'm going back to the black screen because, like, I need to get in the world.

822
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,580
And then get the camera out.

823
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,220
I don't have the camera out yet.

824
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,660
Oh my god!

825
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,680
Holy shit!

826
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh my god!

827
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,720
It got worse.

828
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,780
How did it get worse?

829
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,460
There's so many chickens.

830
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,600
Okay.

831
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,560
I'm trying.

832
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,200
There we go.

833
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,160
Alright.

834
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,600
I'm trying.

835
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,180
You don't see me yet.

836
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,540
Because I'm trying to figure out the...

837
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,460
But you're going to see how there's more chickens.

838
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,340
How is there more chickens?

839
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,720
What did you do?

840
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,220
I'm selling the chickens!

841
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm selling the chickens!

842
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,260
I'm selling them right now!

843
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,240
How is there more chickens?

844
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,680
I'm selling the chickens!

845
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,520
I'm selling the chickens!

846
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,020
You crashed my server!

847
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,460
You crashed my server!

848
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,600
I'm selling the chickens!

849
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,660
We're not making any more money!

850
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,060
We're not making any more money!

851
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,980
I think we need to leave!

852
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,980
We're selling them!

853
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,700
We're selling all these chickens!

854
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,720
I think we broke the economy!

855
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,800
We broke the chicken economy!

856
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,700
What?

857
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,220
They can't even pay us!

858
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,220
We have too many chickens!

859
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,100
We don't even spend the rest of our money!

860
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,500
Why are you still selling?

861
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,920
Because we gotta get rid of these chickens!

862
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,580
You're the one that breeded them!

863
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,260
We have too many chickens!

864
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,560
Oh no!

865
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,420
I'm trying to heal you!

866
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,860
The great...

867
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,780
The great chicken crash!

868
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,860
I can't believe it!

869
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,780
You burst the chicken bubble!

870
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,420
How did you burst the chicken bubble?

871
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,080
I don't know.

872
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,620
I can't believe she didn't.

873
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,160
She burst the chicken economy.

874
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,160
They won't even...

875
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,380
I think we have to breed more chickens!

876
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,160
Wait, wait!

877
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,360
To get them to sell chickens!

878
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,600
Wait, just pay...

879
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,740
Oh my god, they're following!

880
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,920
They're just...

881
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,300
They're just...

882
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,220
They're just...

883
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,940
They're following you!

884
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,660
Holy shit!

885
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,180
It's because I'm their master!

886
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,840
I'm gonna squish all of them.

887
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,120
I'm big boys!

888
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,340
I love them!

889
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,640
Wait, wait, wait!

890
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,580
Toki!

891
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,520
Don't you understand?

892
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,740
I'm the big cock!

893
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,200
You're the big cock!

894
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,720
Yeah!

895
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,800
I rule them all!

896
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,740
I don't know.

897
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,200
It doesn't really like...

898
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,640
Um...

899
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,760
It's not very effective when I see you try to jump up and reach it.

900
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,980
We're gonna get a square chicken!

901
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,280
We're gonna get a square chicken!

902
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,520
Oh my god, no!

903
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,460
That's an ice cube!

904
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,460
We're gonna get an ice chicken!

905
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,020
We're gonna get a snow chicken!

906
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,160
Wait, I heard like...

907
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,260
I heard fire chicken is weak ag...

908
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,860
Wait, I heard like ice chicken is weak against fire chicken.

909
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:10,820
I...

910
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,400
We need to get fire chicken.

911
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
We need to get fire chicken!

912
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,960
Oh my god, you're literally like the mom.

913
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,380
It's following you everywhere.

914
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,620
Oh my god!

915
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,220
Wait, we got a strawberry chicken!

916
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,940
Oh no, that's how I die.

917
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,460
Oh my god, the ice chicken!

918
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,460
Look, there's snow coming out of the ice chicken!

919
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,040
You're so cute!

920
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:31,740
Oh my god!

921
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,360
Oh shit!

922
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,980
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for squishing.

923
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,580
I'm so sorry.

924
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,660
Guys, look!

925
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,800
Look!

926
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,680
Look, there's snow coming out!

927
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,560
Look!

928
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,840
This one is mine.

929
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,160
We're good!

930
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,560
Are you good?

931
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,080
Are you sure?

932
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,760
Are you sure?

933
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,440
Wait, what's this one?

934
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,640
Oh, look at the strawberry chicken!

935
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,680
Wait, is that a ghost chicken?

936
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,000
Oh my god!

937
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,940
I think it's a ghost chicken!

938
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:04,940
Wait!

939
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,500
Oh my god!

940
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,720
Guys, look!

941
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,340
We got a strawberry chicken too!

942
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,240
Look at him!

943
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,560
This is how I die.

944
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,700
Did you just eat the strawberry?

945
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,140
Gonna die, everybody.

946
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,860
They say you only live once.

947
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,400
YOLO.

948
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,140
YOLO!

949
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,200
Wait, where's the ghost chicken?

950
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,120
Where is it?

951
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,680
Look!

952
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,660
Wait, that's a wisp!

953
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,460
Look!

954
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,440
It's a wisp!

955
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,520
It's a wisp!

956
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:34,980
Guys!

957
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,480
I'm gonna eat the wisp.

958
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm gonna eat the wisp!

959
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,320
You can't stop me!

960
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,980
It must hurt more!

961
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,760
Look at the wisp!

962
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,800
Guys, look, there's the wisp!

963
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,680
There he is!

964
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,480
Oh, there's you!

965
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,760
Yes!

966
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,020
Oh my god!

967
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,220
My precious son!

968
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,800
There's your son!

969
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,420
My precious son!

970
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,460
There he is!

971
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,640
He's so cute!

972
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,120
He's so cute!

973
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,780
Oh my god, it jumped into your head!

974
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,600
Oh god, he's so cute!

975
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,900
Wait, do we have more?

976
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,280
Where's more?

977
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,240
Oh my god, that's not ours.

978
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,220
That's not ours.

979
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,460
What do you mean that's not ours?

980
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,100
Oh, what the hell is that?

981
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,480
Did you birth that one?

982
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,900
That guy's adopted.

983
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,540
There's no way!

984
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,740
There's no way!

985
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,940
I would never love this son!

986
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,860
I would never love this son!

987
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,100
He was throwing it away!

988
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,060
Wait!

989
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,220
They didn't even stop it!

990
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,240
Oh my god!

991
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,140
Oh my god!

992
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,160
She instantly threw away the chicken!

993
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,000
He's still here!

994
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:50,660
Oh, okay.

995
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,880
Wait, where is he?

996
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,960
Where did he go?

997
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,940
Oh my god, that's not you!

998
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,960
Oh, there's too many!

999
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,320
Guys, this is the son that we don't own.

1000
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,320
Whose son is this?

1001
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,400
I don't know how we get blessed chickens!

1002
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,420
Whose son is this?

1003
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,820
Whose son is this?

1004
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,800
This is not ours!

1005
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,460
Who is this ugly son?

1006
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,020
Is this a wisp?

1007
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,940
Okay, look.

1008
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,000
Look at the guy we just got.

1009
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,640
What is he?

1010
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,080
He's got glasses!

1011
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,380
Show them to them!

1012
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,160
Show them to them!

1013
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,020
He's cool!

1014
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,340
Look, he has glasses!

1015
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,880
Look!

1016
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,560
I think this is yours.

1017
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,720
I think this is yours.

1018
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,620
I think it's mine.

1019
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,180
He thinks after me.

1020
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,860
Wait, this one looks like you!

1021
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,860
Wait, what is this?

1022
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,640
What the fuck?

1023
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,880
How is this me?

1024
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,800
It looks like you!

1025
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,580
How?

1026
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,780
It looks like you!

1027
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,300
How?

1028
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,100
It just has a...

1029
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,980
It's you!

1030
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,120
It's you!

1031
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,020
Oh yeah, the sun's yellow.

1032
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,160
Is that also me?

1033
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,580
This is literally what she thinks looks like me, guys.

1034
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,400
This is here.

1035
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,620
This guy right here.

1036
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,840
Okay, I can't chat.

1037
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,480
You say it looks like her too, right?

1038
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,880
Wait, where did...

1039
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,320
Oh my god!

1040
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,000
The wisp grew up so big!

1041
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,740
Look!

1042
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,460
What did you feed him?

1043
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,000
I can punch it.

1044
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,560
Soothes!

1045
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,640
You know, life force and stuff.

1046
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,220
Ugh!

1047
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,480
That's why I'm so tall.

1048
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,480
I can punt it.

1049
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,480
I think we just got a boob.

1050
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,760
You just got a boob?

1051
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,040
What?

1052
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,340
Wait, this one is broken.

1053
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,440
Wait, what do you mean?

1054
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,880
What's wrong with it?

1055
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,580
Look at it!

1056
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,640
What's wrong with it?

1057
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,480
It's broken on top!

1058
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,860
No, I think it's a flower.

1059
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,380
It's a boob!

1060
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,820
Is this a boob?

1061
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,920
Will I get demonetized?

1062
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,980
YouTube, is this a boob?

1063
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,640
Is this a nipple?

1064
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,040
Is this a nipple?

1065
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,220
Wait, wait, put it up against your chest!

1066
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,380
Put it up against your chest!

1067
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,420
Get over here!

1068
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,140
Wait, get over here, man!

1069
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,760
Put this against your chest and look at the camera.

1070
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,680
Like this?

1071
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,260
Yeah, yeah, and then move more to this.

1072
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,460
Move more here.

1073
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,560
Shhh!

1074
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:18,860
No!

1075
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,290
Wait, he's so cool!

1076
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:44,890
Show it!

1077
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,410
He's so cool!

1078
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:47,730
Guys, this is it.

1079
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:48,590
This is... You got a mohawk and everything!

1080
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,390
Guys, this is it.

1081
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,830
We're just gonna be in Chickatopia forever.

1082
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,650
We're gonna...

1083
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:55,110
We can't stop making more chickens!

1084
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,670
What the hell?

1085
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,930
Okay, this one is an abomination.

1086
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:58,790
Don't get me wrong.

1087
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,050
This one is an abomination!

1088
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,910
What the fuck?

1089
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,310
Did a dog got in?

1090
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,170
I don't know.

1091
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,590
Who let the dogs in?

1092
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,830
Who let the dogs out?

1093
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,210
What's wrong with this one?

1094
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,090
Is this a boob one?

1095
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,230
Why do they look like this?

1096
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,690
That's a boob one!

1097
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,010
It has like a boob on top!

1098
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,190
Guys, all you hear is boop, boop, boop, boop.

1099
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,930
We have so many!

1100
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,150
We have so many!

1101
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,710
All you hear is boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

1102
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,270
I'll lead them!

1103
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,770
I'll lead them into a better future!

1104
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,310
Come, my chickens!

1105
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,970
We will be ready!

1106
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,570
We will be ready!

1107
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,050
Oh my god!

1108
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,830
Oh my god!

1109
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:42,190
Help!

1110
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,070
Help!

1111
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,930
Help!

1112
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,210
Help!

1113
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,930
Oh my god!

1114
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,450
Are you okay?

1115
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,210
Oh my god!

1116
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,010
Where are they going?

1117
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,810
Where are the chickens going?

1118
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,270
I don't know!

1119
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,230
Look at them go!

1120
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,400
Where are they going?

1121
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
There they are!

1122
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,920
There's the chickens!

1123
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,140
The horde of chickens!

1124
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,160
They're following Mint!

1125
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,380
There they go!

1126
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,200
Off to the distant lands!

1127
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,660
Okay, now we can leave them here in a little more quiet.

1128
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,200
Oh, that's true!

1129
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,540
That's true!

1130
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,500
I'll get some more!

1131
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,120
I'll get some more!

1132
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,560
Did you just abandon your chickens?

1133
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,660
My chickens!

1134
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,460
Did you just abandon the children?

1135
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Follow me, my chickens!

1136
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,300
Yeah!

1137
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,280
Follow me, chickens!

1138
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,920
This way, chickens!

1139
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,660
Goodbye, chickens!

1140
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,020
Goodbye!

1141
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,960
Wait, why aren't they coming?

1142
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,240
Wait, are they my chickens?

1143
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,560
Oh, they follow me?

1144
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,720
Okay, chickens, come over here, chickens!

1145
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,840
Come over here!

1146
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,580
Come over here!

1147
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,000
Wait, they stopped following me.

1148
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,480
Your chickens are kind of stupid.

1149
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,340
Yo, my chickens are smart.

1150
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,260
They know what we're gonna do.

1151
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,180
You're gonna get abandoned!

1152
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,000
No!

1153
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,580
Your chickens are stupid!

1154
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,420
Your chickens are stupid!

1155
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,500
They were like, my mama loves me.

1156
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,080
They know.

1157
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,140
Yeah, I do!

1158
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,820
I'm leading them to a greater place!

1159
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,060
You're abandoning them!

1160
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,380
No, they're here!

1161
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,960
They're free!

1162
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,360
That's not abandonment!

1163
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,480
What will they eat?

1164
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,280
Wait, wait, wait!

1165
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,240
They're over there!

1166
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,520
They're over here!

1167
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,080
This one chicken...

1168
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,120
That's following you.

1169
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,620
You have two chickens behind you.

1170
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,240
What the fuck?

1171
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,900
I do.

1172
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
I'm gonna throw them away.

1173
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,280
Ah!

1174
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,860
Get over here!

1175
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,620
Oh my god!

1176
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,740
Why can't you go further?

1177
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,820
Why can't you go further?

1178
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,340
Get over there!

1179
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,400
Get over there!

1180
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,940
Be there with your...

1181
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,960
Hey, it came back!

1182
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,800
Be there with your sons!

1183
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,320
With your friends!

1184
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,920
Alright, there they are.

1185
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,500
Now run!

1186
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,740
Okay, okay.

1187
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,600
Are they following?

1188
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,540
Just run.

1189
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,360
Just run.

1190
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,320
Where's the house?

1191
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:24,840
Where's the house?

1192
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,900
Okay, nice.

1193
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,880
Alright, nice.

1194
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,260
Now we've reduced the chicken population.

1195
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,920
That's good!

1196
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,860
We did it!

1197
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,460
But we still can't sell more.

1198
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,360
We're sold out.

1199
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,640
I think we maxed out the...

1200
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,460
We must have maxed out the like...

1201
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,220
available...

1202
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,840
Chickens.

1203
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,040
Yeah.

1204
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,560
Here, I'll try selling one.

1205
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:46,940
Come here.

1206
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,240
Okay.

1207
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,540
Bye!

1208
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,000
No, he just falls through the bottom.

1209
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,800
Oh!

1210
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,160
They reject their chickens?

1211
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,280
Is it cause they're...

1212
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,140
Is it cause they're white?

1213
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,280
And they need to be the special ones?

1214
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,300
They don't take default chickens anymore?

1215
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:02,700
They don't take default chickens anymore?

1216
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,660
Alright, boob chicken, we don't... Get rid of... Get rid of toast!

1217
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,080
We're gonna get rid of toast!

1218
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,640
Toast, come here!

1219
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,040
Toast, come here!

1220
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,080
Get away!

1221
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,220
We never wanted you!

1222
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,720
Get in there, toast!

1223
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,120
We never wanted you!

1224
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,700
Alright, we'll see.

1225
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,340
Oh!

1226
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,180
We want...

1227
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,340
We wanted toast!

1228
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,960
Yeah, we always wanted toast.

1229
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,420
We lie about that.

1230
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,020
Yeah, we're just testing...

1231
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,160
Yeah.

1232
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,020
We were just testing you!

1233
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,720
We wanna see your commitment!

1234
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:24,320
Yeah!

1235
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,500
I wanna...

1236
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,660
We've always loved toast.

1237
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,600
Yeah, we love toast.

1238
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,140
It's cause it has crust on it.

1239
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,000
That's what makes it uglier.

1240
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,200
There's crust on that toast.

1241
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:35,760
Oh...

1242
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,480
What are you doing?

1243
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,620
What are you doing?

1244
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,720
I'm putting them in jail.

1245
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,560
I'm putting them in jail.

1246
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,260
I'm putting them in jail.

1247
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,420
I don't wanna see that one anymore.

1248
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,180
I don't wanna see that one anymore.

1249
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,900
Oh yeah, by the way, you guys haven't seen him?

1250
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,080
We think the dog, uh, got to the chickens.

1251
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:56,640
We think the dog, uh, got to the chickens.

1252
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,700
Because what the fuck is wrong with him?

1253
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,940
Like... What is wrong with this guy?

1254
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,560
We might...

1255
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,020
We might actually be like...

1256
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,920
You know, scientists.

1257
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,560
We created a new species.

1258
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,800
We created a new species.

1259
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,340
The genetics worked.

1260
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,480
It actually worked, guys.

1261
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,320
Alright, I chose Chickentopia as your turn.

1262
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,240
Alright, I chose Chickentopia as your turn.

1263
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,640
Oh...

1264
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,800
Wait, I didn't know I was supposed to do the world!

1265
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,040
Wait, do you wanna go check out the Fortnite bus?

1266
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,820
Oh yeah, let's check out the Fortnite bus.

1267
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1268
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,040
Fortnite bus!

1269
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,540
Fortnite, we love Fortnite.

1270
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,420
We love Fortnite.

1271
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,580
This is the bus that took us through the whole new world.

1272
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,180
Wait, this is so cute!

1273
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,920
Oh, that's so...

1274
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Oh my gosh, they can't see it.

1275
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,760
Guys, don't worry, camera.

1276
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,460
I'm gonna figure this out.

1277
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,120
Guys, I know you can only see the outside of the camera.

1278
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,420
Come on in!

1279
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,400
Wait, how do I bring it to me?

1280
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,380
I'm shutting the doors!

1281
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,560
Oh no, no, you're not gonna let them in!

1282
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,160
They're not in yet!

1283
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,660
It's too late!

1284
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,240
No!

1285
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,640
Guys, get in here!

1286
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:57,920
Okay, I'll let them in.

1287
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,940
I'll let them in.

1288
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,360
Guys, get in here!

1289
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,060
It's not my fault!

1290
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,240
I don't know how to use the camera!

1291
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,960
Okay, there we go.

1292
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,680
Oh, look at it.

1293
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,320
There's like...

1294
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,060
Oh, maybe these are like supporters.

1295
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,940
And stuff.

1296
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,960
I'm the bus driver.

1297
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,680
Say thank you to your bus driver, guys.

1298
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,140
Whoa.

1299
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,620
Thank you, bus driver.

1300
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,880
Thank you, bus driver.

1301
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,900
You're barely... you're like phasing... just like a ghost, you're phasing through the...

1302
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,120
the...

1303
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,040
That's peak performance.

1304
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,280
That's how you drive.

1305
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:26,900
That's lore.

1306
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,620
Immersion.

1307
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,280
Oh god!

1308
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,260
There's an accident!

1309
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,680
Oh, we're gonna go over!

1310
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,380
Not the chickens!

1311
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,620
Think of the chickens!

1312
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,520
I'm dead now.

1313
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,080
You're already dead.

1314
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,240
Wait, is that how you died?

1315
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,560
Is that your ghost lore?

1316
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,680
You died from the Fortnite bus?

1317
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,220
Died in the Fortnite bus?

1318
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,720
That'd be so sad.

1319
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:57,700
Why?

1320
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,820
Everybody loves the Fortnite.

1321
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,200
Everybody loves the Fortnite bus.

1322
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,160
Everybody loves the Fortnite.

1323
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:04,960
Everybody loves the Fortnite.

1324
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,140
We love Fortnite.

1325
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,940
I'm gonna sit.

1326
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:09,980
I'm gonna sit.

1327
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,360
Everybody knows the backseat is the best seat.

1328
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,620
I know, that's why I'm here.

1329
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah, that's why I'm here too.

1330
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,340
That's what...

1331
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,420
That's your camera looking.

1332
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,460
It is.

1333
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,940
It is.

1334
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,500
It's doing its best.

1335
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,620
It's doing its best.

1336
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,880
It's doing its best.

1337
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,920
I'm doing its best, guys.

1338
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,500
I'm trying.

1339
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,400
That's all that matters.

1340
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,640
You can tell that there's effort going in.

1341
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,340
You can tell that there's effort going in.

1342
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,620
Alright, what world should we go next?

1343
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,140
Alright, what world should we go next?

1344
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,740
Let's see...

1345
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,540
There's so many new things.

1346
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,540
It's so hard to...

1347
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,680
I know.

1348
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,720
There's like...

1349
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,540
Chat, where do you wanna go?

1350
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,060
Chat, give us some suggestions.

1351
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,440
What is the hippest new...

1352
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,840
There's Omegle VR.

1353
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,080
Yeah, no.

1354
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,940
Stop.

1355
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,760
I don't think that probably works.

1356
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,160
Omegle VR.

1357
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,800
Let's see.

1358
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,220
Okay.

1359
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,040

1360
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,880
Let's see.

1361
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,880

1362
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,240
Oh, I only have Chickentopia.

1363
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,740
Chickentopia!

1364
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,100
I mean, it was a pretty good place.

1365
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,140
It was.

1366
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,520
Chickentopia.

1367
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,240

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,800
Oh, here we go.

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,920
Trending world.

1370
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:34,640
Trending.

1371
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,400
Yeah.

1372
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:37,940
Umm...

1373
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,900
We could go to Murder 4.

1374
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,400
Murder 4?

1375
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,800
More murdering?

1376
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,500
Furry Hideout?

1377
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:44,960
Oh my...

1378
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,320
Oh my god, Doki, they're just in your head!

1379
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,180
Like, give them something to see.

1380
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,520
What about Lox ERP Room?

1381
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,380
Lox ERP Room?

1382
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,520
There's a hundred and... There's a hundred and twenty-eight people in there.

1383
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,300
I don't think it's...

1384
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,460
Wait, do you wanna play Uno?

1385
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,520
Oh my god, there's Uno?

1386
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,440
Oh my god.

1387
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,140
There's Hazbin Hotel!

1388
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,720
There's...

1389
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,000
Oh my god, there's... There's Hazbin Hotel, man!

1390
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,060
Oh my god, there's a Game Theory!

1391
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,700
Wait, can we go?

1392
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,160
Can we go?

1393
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,420
Can we go to Luigi's Casino?

1394
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,360
Wait, let's go!

1395
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,060
Okay, Luigi's Casino, and then my next pick is Game Theory GT Live.

1396
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,020
Okay, okay.

1397
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,900
You save that one, and we'll go to it.

1398
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,980
Yeah, I'm gonna save that one.

1399
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,340
I'm adding that to the favorite.

1400
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,360
Okay, favorite world one out of one.

1401
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,920
Okay, I'm adding that to the favorite.

1402
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Okay, favorite world one out of one.

1403
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,700
I'm dropping a portal.

1404
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,780
I'm dropping a portal.

1405
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,140
Wait, the Fortnite bus?

1406
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,320
Yeah, it's out... I think it's gonna be in the front of the...

1407
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,880
Okay, hold on, I need to... Where's the Fortnite bus?

1408
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,640
Where is it?

1409
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,660
Wait, oh, oh, this way.

1410
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,800
It's outside, it's outside!

1411
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,620
Oh, okay.

1412
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,820
Where did you drop the portal?

1413
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,720
Right here.

1414
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,860
Oh, there it is.

1415
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,760
Here I go!

1416
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,680
Oh my god, Luigi's Casino!

1417
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:00,540
Oh my god, Luigi's Casino!

1418
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:01,840
Yay!

1419
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,220
Finally, Luigi's doing something!

1420
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,780
Finally!

1421
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,780
What the fuck?

1422
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,780
What the fuck?

1423
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:14,940
Wait...

1424
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,520
Oh my god, you're in... Whoa, whoa.

1425
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,140
Whoa, whoa.

1426
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,020
Okay.

1427
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,520
Level up the camera.

1428
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,660
Oh no, we have no light gravity here.

1429
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,440
No, wait, there's slots!

1430
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,240
There's slots machine!

1431
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,120
Where's Luigi?

1432
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah, where's Luigi?

1433
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,480
We were lied to!

1434
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,400
I was promised Luigi!

1435
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,180
Yeah!

1436
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,840
I was promised Luigi in my Luigi Casino!

1437
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,180
Okay.

1438
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,080
Behind me.

1439
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,620
Guys, we're gonna...

1440
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,160
We're gonna make it.

1441
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,520
Aw man!

1442
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,380
Let's go!

1443
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,100
Aw dang it!

1444
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,370
Now I remember why I don't do my own cameras anymore.

1445
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,210
Now I remember why.

1446
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,350
I remember why I have camera men now.

1447
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,030
I tried... Whoa!

1448
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,950
I took a photo!

1449
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,130
I accidentally took a photo.

1450
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:17,870
What's happening?

1451
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,350
I'm trying to... Where did it go?

1452
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,410
Where did the camera go?

1453
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,110
It's right... Hold on.

1454
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:25,690
Okay, wait.

1455
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,450
Oh, there it is.

1456
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,010
There it is.

1457
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,070
It's right on your face.

1458
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:28,790
It's right here.

1459
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,370
Okay, I won't put it here.

1460
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:32,850
And then...

1461
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,890
Auto level.

1462
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:36,750
And then...

1463
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:37,610
World.

1464
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:38,150
There we go.

1465
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:38,730
Yay!

1466
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,330
I figured it out!

1467
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:42,210
Oh.

1468
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,730
I didn't figure it out.

1469
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:46,490
I figured it out!

1470
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,430
I figured it out.

1471
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:48,850
This place sucks.

1472
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,250
Wait, they're in the table.

1473
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:50,770
You gotta move.

1474
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:51,370
Oh, there you go.

1475
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:51,770
No, no, no.

1476
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:52,990
There's slots right here!

1477
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,010
What's wrong with it?

1478
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:55,650
This place sucks, Doki.

1479
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,310
Why?

1480
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,310
Just get on the slot machine.

1481
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,810
Let's go gambling!

1482
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,970
Oh, that's it?

1483
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:04,710
Wait, that's it?

1484
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:06,290
That's it?

1485
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,230
Where's Luigi?

1486
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,370
We promised Luigi!

1487
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:09,370
I don't know!

1488
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,170
There's no Luigi!

1489
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,710
We've been bamboozled for real!

1490
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,090
We've been bamboozled!

1491
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,810
Where's Luigi?

1492
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,470
Why were there a hundred... Why is this a trending ad?

1493
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,690
There's nothing here.

1494
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,810
Do people just go, let's go gambling!

1495
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,690
Is that it?

1496
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,650
Is that what made it trending?

1497
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:22,990
I know!

1498
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,210
Let's go gambling!

1499
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,770
Okay, let's go to the GT Live.

1500
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,930
Let's go to the GT Live.

1501
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,370
Let's do some game theory.

1502
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:32,770
Alright, where are those?

1503
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:35,850
Where's my...

1504
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,970
Aw, dang it.

1505
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,050
Who would I lie to?

1506
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:41,370
Okay.

1507
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,350
New instance.

1508
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,690
Friend Plus.

1509
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,690
There we go.

1510
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,250
Oh my god, the portal thing is different too.

1511
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:48,530
What?

1512
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:50,830
Let's go gambling!

1513
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:51,950
Aw, dang it.

1514
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,970
Let's go... Aw, dang it.

1515
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:54,690
Let's go gambling!

1516
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,710
Aw, dang it.

1517
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,750
Aw, dang it.

1518
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,070
Here we go.

1519
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,530
I can't believe it!

1520
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:06,990
I can't believe it!

1521
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:07,910
We got lied to!

1522
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,930
Where did our...

1523
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,490
Where did our fucking Luigi go?

1524
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,090
I was promised Luigi!

1525
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:19,090
I was promised Luigi!

1526
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:19,430
Wait.

1527
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:20,730
Where's this?

1528
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,250
Jacksepticeye?

1529
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,950
In space with Markiplier?

1530
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:26,610
We're on observa...

1531
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,630
There's Observation Duty!

1532
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:29,870
You love that game!

1533
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:32,490
Observation...

1534
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:32,970
Oh yeah!

1535
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,230
Yeah, Observation Duty!

1536
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,390
What is this?

1537
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,810
There's Homestucks here!

1538
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,390
Is this copyrighted?

1539
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,830
Do you hear this?

1540
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:45,550
Is this copyrighted music?

1541
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,210
What is that?

1542
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,050
I don't know.

1543
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,130
It's alright, whatever.

1544
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:49,850
Is it?

1545
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:50,610
Yeah!

1546
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,030
Whatever, what are you gonna do, take my ad money?

1547
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:54,730
Oh!

1548
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:55,690
Oh!

1549
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:57,230
What is this?

1550
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,230
What is this?

1551
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,090
Oh my god, you guys don't see it!

1552
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1553
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,110
Where did it go?

1554
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:06,750
It's the camera!

1555
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,130
I need you guys to see this!

1556
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:08,990
It's right here!

1557
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:09,290
It's right here!

1558
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:09,930
It's right here!

1559
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:10,150
It's right here!

1560
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:10,550
Oh, okay.

1561
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:10,930
All right.

1562
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,250
Oh, okay.

1563
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:15,810
All right.

1564
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,690
What is this?

1565
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,310
Oh, shit, look!

1566
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,390
It's some song!

1567
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,810
Yeah, we don't know what this is.

1568
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,410
It says DokiBirdYoutube.com I think it's you.

1569
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:28,530
Wait, what?

1570
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,150
I think it's you.

1571
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:29,370
Wait, it's me?

1572
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:31,150
Oh my god!

1573
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,730
This is what she watches every day, you guys!

1574
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:33,850
Gosh, guys, why?

1575
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,050
Oh, it's because I have Look At Me on!

1576
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,310
There you go, guys!

1577
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,170
Oh, um...

1578
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,010
You're getting there.

1579
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:42,850
You're almost there.

1580
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,150
Oh, why is it...

1581
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,170
Do auto-level.

1582
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,830
Wait, I didn't know that's a thing!

1583
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:49,070
There you go.

1584
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,270
Yeah.

1585
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,230
This is what we're watching.

1586
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,610
Here, here.

1587
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,530
You're so much better at this than me.

1588
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,130
Holy shit.

1589
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:58,930
There you go.

1590
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,090
Who are...

1591
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:06,190
Who are these people?

1592
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,370
Who are these people?

1593
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,590
Are you actually listening to it?

1594
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:09,890
Yeah.

1595
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,710
Are you allowed to?

1596
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:13,350
Oh, okay.

1597
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,110
How creepers get to explode?

1598
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,140
I'm like the hat in time gif.

1599
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,970
It's just... Who is that?

1600
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:00,810
Who is that guy?

1601
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:00,950
Who is that guy?

1602
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,110
Who is he?

1603
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,890
He's pretty catchy.

1604
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,310
I don't think I'm on full body.

1605
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,670
There we go.

1606
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,150
Dude, a monster!

1607
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,590
A monster?

1608
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:22,370
Woah!

1609
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,230
I smacked...

1610
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,290
I heard that.

1611
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,350
Yeah, I smacked it.

1612
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,090
He's a thriller.

1613
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:32,490
Thriller.

1614
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:33,870
Thriller.

1615
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:34,490
Night.

1616
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,450
I love the...

1617
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,230
How long is this song?

1618
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,830
This is a five minute song!

1619
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:43,610
I don't think it's a movie.

1620
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,690
No, it's a five minute!

1621
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:45,890
Oh, you're right.

1622
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,550
Hey, this is like game suggestions for us.

1623
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,150
I feel so immersed right now.

1624
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:51,490
I know.

1625
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,730
Oh my gosh, guys, look.

1626
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,230
We'll show you guys the rest of...

1627
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,210
The rest of the place.

1628
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:00,610
Yeah.

1629
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:01,650
Yeah.

1630
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,070
Yeah.

1631
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:02,230
Okay.

1632
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,150
Look!

1633
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,530
This is where MatPat does his theories!

1634
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,510
Look at that!

1635
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,630
I'm turning off the music.

1636
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,610
I can't do this anymore.

1637
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:12,410
Guys!

1638
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,570
They have a playlist?

1639
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,930
Oh my god!

1640
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:19,870
Doki Doki Decoded!

1641
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:20,690
MatPat!

1642
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,350
Maoshi!

1643
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,570
Oh my god!

1644
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,770
We're gonna figure out the game theory!

1645
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,070
Oh my god!

1646
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,390
Just Monika!

1647
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:34,730
Oh my god!

1648
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,690
We can watch game theory!

1649
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,470
Like a kid, you know, when it's damn too close.

1650
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,390
A really rich kid with VR chat.

1651
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:43,050
With VR.

1652
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,330
No, I'm just like really close to the screen.

1653
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:47,490
Oh my god!

1654
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,030
Oh my god!

1655
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,650
Oh my god!

1656
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,760
MatPat!

1657
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:56,240
MatPat!

1658
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,820
Where's the intro?

1659
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,480
Give me the game theory!

1660
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,380
There it is!

1661
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,880
Welcome to game theory!

1662
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,540
Welcome to game theory!

1663
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,560
Welcome to game theory!

1664
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:19,220
So in part one of this theory, we start to unearth a horror game hidden underneath the I can't believe he's actually just going off.

1665
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,220
Oh my god.

1666
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,680
What is the theory?

1667
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,740
...experiments and cults.

1668
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,620
All topics that appear in Yuri's book Among Us.

1669
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,280
This show happens to have a mysterious I am the Doki.

1670
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,120
Let me...

1671
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,820
...

1672
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,160
...

1673
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,120
...

1674
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,020
...

1675
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,760
What is this?

1676
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,480
What is this?

1677
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,360
Just a theory.

1678
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,000
It's a sand bird!

1679
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,400
What's a golden freddy?

1680
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,200
What's a golden freddy does?

1681
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,340
It's probably he's here, he's there, he's everywhere.

1682
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,760
Horror, horror, horror.

1683
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,120
Horror, horror, horror.

1684
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,560
Okay, Kim, do it.

1685
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,460
Wait, how do you press it?

1686
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,040
How did you press that?

1687
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,080
I think you have to be holding it.

1688
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,380
Yeah, you have to be holding it first.

1689
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,020
We should visit Freddy's Fazbear!

1690
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,420
Did you take it?

1691
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,880
No, where'd it go?

1692
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,000
Where'd it go?

1693
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,500
I think it went through the wall!

1694
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,700
I think it was based in the wall!

1695
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,160
No, not that!

1696
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,680
How will we know if it's a game, Perry?

1697
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:39,840
How?

1698
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,880
Wait, it's on the floor!

1699
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:43,900
Oh, where'd it go?

1700
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,180
Where?

1701
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,120
Oh, it's over there.

1702
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:45,680
Okay, nice.

1703
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,540
It was through the floor.

1704
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,240
Okay, we should...

1705
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,600
Do you like his house?

1706
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,720
I feel a little uncomfortable.

1707
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,340
No, this is his office.

1708
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,180
Oh, there's bean bags!

1709
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,880
There's a pool table?

1710
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,940
There's a keypad?

1711
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,700
Oh, wow, the cookers!

1712
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,260
Whoa!

1713
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,200
Whoa!

1714
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,760
Doki, put on the mirror.

1715
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,500
We're in the game theory.

1716
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,220
Oh my god!

1717
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,800
Wait, wait, I wanna know.

1718
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,200
Wait, wait, I wanna...

1719
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,040
Put on the mirror.

1720
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,040
Oh my god, we're in the game!

1721
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,480
Doki, put on the mirror!

1722
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:31,840
Doki!

1723
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,980
We're in the game theory.

1724
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,320
This entire time, we were in the...

1725
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,440
I probably look like a crazy person.

1726
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,840
Wait, it doesn't show on the...

1727
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,160
No!

1728
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,500
It doesn't show on the camera!

1729
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,340
No!

1730
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,800
It just looks like we're in the void!

1731
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,140
We're in the game theory!

1732
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:47,940
No, you don't understand!

1733
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,160
We're in the game theory, look!

1734
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,240
We're in the game theory!

1735
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,560
It's the video, right there!

1736
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,700
Which one's the real Doki?

1737
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,060
I don't know.

1738
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,940
Whoa, which one's the real Doki?

1739
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,460
Ooh!

1740
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:01,600
Ooh!

1741
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:02,900
Ooh!

1742
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:04,980
Ooh!

1743
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,760
Ooh!

1744
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,740
Oh no, they're converging!

1745
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,900
They're converging!

1746
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,400
Oh god, why do I look like that?

1747
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,240
Oh my god, this is Mint's true form.

1748
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,540
This is her true form.

1749
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,760
You know like Angel's true form?

1750
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,180
Biblically accurate Mint.

1751
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,780
If I...

1752
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,160
If we touch the finger, will we get sucked in?

1753
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:28,880
Oh, oh.

1754
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,320
Oh, oh.

1755
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:30,940
Oh, oh.

1756
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,440
Oh, oh.

1757
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:32,500
I'm...

1758
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,600
SCP's Mint, right there.

1759
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,260
We should... we should visit FNAF!

1760
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,680
We should visit FNAF!

1761
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,120
We should visit FNAF!

1762
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,440
I wanna...

1763
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,280
You look scared to do it though.

1764
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,820
No I won't, I'm not baby.

1765
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,740
Is this like an official world?

1766
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,620
There's like even...

1767
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,880
Wait, yeah, I think so.

1768
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,080
Wait, are we supposed to break... oh my god, is there an ARG in VRChat?

1769
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,820
I think so.

1770
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,280
Oh my god, there's like codes and stuff.

1771
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,260
This is like a code.

1772
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,300
Guys, can you guys do this for us?

1773
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,980
We're gonna go to FNAF world.

1774
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,600
You figure it out.

1775
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,720
Guys, Dragoons and Wisp work together and figure out how to break... how to solve MatPat's codes.

1776
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,120
Wait, did they see it?

1777
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,720
Hold on, hold on.

1778
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,320
Here, here, here.

1779
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,120
I'll show it to them.

1780
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,680
Oh wait, there's a back, there's a front.

1781
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,400
Here's the front.

1782
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,120
Yeah, yeah.

1783
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:25,980
Here's the front everybody.

1784
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,080
And then there's a back.

1785
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:27,660
That's the front.

1786
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,440
Yeah.

1787
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,660
You got it?

1788
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,060
Yeah.

1789
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:30,500
You got it?

1790
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:30,900
Here's the back.

1791
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,520
There it is.

1792
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,480
Screenshot it?

1793
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,140
Screenshot it.

1794
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:33,440
Yep.

1795
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,280
There that is.

1796
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:34,620
Figure it out.

1797
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,820
And then...

1798
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,120
But hey, that's just a matter.

1799
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,380
But Henry...

1800
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:52,900
Welcome to Game Theory.

1801
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,260
What?

1802
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,540
Wait.

1803
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,780
What?

1804
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,140
There's a...

1805
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,520
Whoa!

1806
00:57:59,660 --> 00:57:59,980
That's a...

1807
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:00,040
That's a...

1808
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,900
There's two fronts.

1809
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,140
Yeah.

1810
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,180
There's big fronts.

1811
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,060
There's foot fronts.

1812
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,860
Oh my god.

1813
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,720
Wait guys.

1814
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:05,300
Wait, wait.

1815
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,160
There's a coat on the ceiling.

1816
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,900
Okay, there's a coat on the ceiling.

1817
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,240
What?

1818
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,440
Where's the camera?

1819
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,980
Oh my god, there is.

1820
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,460
You guys don't see it.

1821
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,080
We're not giving you hints on how to solve this puzzle.

1822
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,100
You gotta go there yourself.

1823
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,200
No hints for you.

1824
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,640
Wait, but we'll show you the feet.

1825
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,100
Wait, where's the mirror?

1826
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:22,980
Wait, can I...

1827
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:23,920
Can we show them the feet again?

1828
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,080
What feet?

1829
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,280
The feet on the ground.

1830
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:27,980
Right here.

1831
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:28,760
Feet.

1832
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,040
Do you guys see it?

1833
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,720
It's like right here.

1834
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,420
Wait, it's on the wall?

1835
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:33,920
Yeah.

1836
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,120
Oh my god, it's on the wall.

1837
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,560
What are they doing?

1838
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,480
You didn't notice the wall?

1839
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,660
What are they doing?

1840
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,480
It goes all the way up and then it goes to the code.

1841
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:41,800
Oh.

1842
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,980
That's some big ass feet.

1843
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,280
Third eye.

1844
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,020
What is this third eye shit?

1845
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,900
Alright, take us to FNAF.

1846
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:53,800
Are we really?

1847
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:54,440
Yeah.

1848
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,300
Wait, oh my god.

1849
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,080
This is just straight up OBS right here.

1850
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,740
Yeah, this is editing software.

1851
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,040
Oh, this is how they do it.

1852
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,760
This is how they do the GT Live.

1853
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,340
Yeah.

1854
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,680
Yeah, it's GT Live.

1855
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,660
Oh, you're on the couch.

1856
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,800
Oh my god, guys.

1857
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,020
She's on the couch.

1858
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,560
Wait, let me bring it to me.

1859
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,360
Oh, here's the decoder.

1860
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,220
Where's my camera?

1861
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,640
Oh, there it is.

1862
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,380
Guys, look.

1863
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,100
In front of your face?

1864
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,340
Yeah.

1865
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:20,760
Guys, look.

1866
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,260
There she is.

1867
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:25,680
Wait.

1868
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,420
Take a nap.

1869
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:27,540
I'm sorry.

1870
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,500
Yeah, real quick.

1871
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:29,960
I'm sorry.

1872
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,020
I'm sorry.

1873
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,900
I'míve got to sit down.òn I'm sitting down.

1874
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:32,960
And set it down.

1875
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,720
There's the camera right there.

1876
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,580
Look and then the couch is like, where is it?

1877
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,520
The couch is right there.

1878
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,520
Its a little casting couch.

1879
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:46,820
Yeah.

1880
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,860
Which GT Live.

1881
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,440
I think the camera is in your head.

1882
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,020
You've got to put it far further away, I think.

1883
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,960
Put it where my hand is.

1884
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,180
Put it where your hand is.

1885
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,000
Yeah, because when you move, for one sec...

1886
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
All four Forward it covers it.

1887
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,020
And then I'll do this.

1888
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,520
And then... but then that's my face.

1889
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,320
Yes.

1890
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,200
No, turn it around.

1891
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,740
Turn it...

1892
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,640
Put it further from your face.

1893
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,100
And then...

1894
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,560
And then I do...

1895
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,500
And then what do I do?

1896
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,020
What do I do after that?

1897
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,100
I don't know.

1898
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,700
Aww, you're tight.

1899
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,520
You're tight.

1900
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,280
You're E.P.?

1901
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,480
You want to end it on FNAF?

1902
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,580
Yeah, I'm kind of...

1903
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,380
Yeah, we can end it on FNAF.

1904
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,040
Yeah, let's end it.

1905
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,200
We'll do our announcement in FNAF.

1906
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,380
Okay.

1907
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:33,860
Five...

1908
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,900
Five nights at Freddy's.

1909
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,280
Nights...

1910
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,320
I gotta find a good one.

1911
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,220
Oh, that's true.

1912
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,680
The most popular five nights at Freddy's.

1913
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:44,960
Yeah.

1914
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,380
Okay.

1915
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:45,880
I'm submitting.

1916
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,540
Sorry, camera's in her head.

1917
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,320
We're still figuring it out.

1918
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,920
Eventually I'll learn how to...

1919
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,940
Wait, there's like... nobody goes to these ones.

1920
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,420
What?

1921
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,280
Is FNAF dead?

1922
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,680
Oh, wait.

1923
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,600
Wait, this one has 13 people.

1924
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,240
Maybe it's popular.

1925
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:01,600
Oh my god.

1926
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,260
That one instance with 13 people.

1927
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,320
Is FNAF dead, guys?

1928
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:07,760
Is FNAF dead, guys?

1929
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,960
We can go to...

1930
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,100
This one.

1931
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:10,860
This one looks legit.

1932
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:11,900
I think.

1933
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,460
Okay, I'm gonna put in an instance.

1934
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:15,940
I'm just gonna sit down.

1935
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,040
Oh my god.

1936
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,600
We sit.

1937
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,360
Alright, I'm dropping the portal.

1938
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,720
Alright, I'm dropping the portal.

1939
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,140
Right here.

1940
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:26,520
Right here.

1941
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,800
Oh, oh god.

1942
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,640
This is a prank.

1943
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,200
Oh, we have 19 seconds to go through that.

1944
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:38,840
Oh, okay.

1945
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,300
Let's go.

1946
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:44,640
Yay!

1947
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,040
We're gonna announce something FNAF!

1948
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:53,460
Woo!

1949
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:53,940
FNAF!

1950
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,540
It's time.

1951
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,920
Yeah, so people don't like run...

1952
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,320
People we don't want can run into the portal.

1953
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,240
Whoa!

1954
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,240
Oh.

1955
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:05,740
Oh.

1956
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,500
Man.

1957
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,580
This is spooky.

1958
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,060
This one's scary.

1959
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,380
This is scary.

1960
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,020
Yeah, man.

1961
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,000
I thought you said it would be funny.

1962
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:16,360
Why is the light?

1963
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,480
Why is it scary?

1964
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,740
Why is it so scary?

1965
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,140
Oh my god.

1966
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,020
We can be friends.

1967
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:23,920
We can be friends.

1968
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,400
What's that?

1969
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,100
Oh, I turned out the light.

1970
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:29,740
Oh.

1971
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:31,540
Oh.

1972
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:36,830
What if the battery runs out?

1973
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:38,190
I don't...

1974
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,430
Where is it?

1975
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:42,690
Is there no lights?

1976
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:45,150
I don't know.

1977
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,530
I don't like this.

1978
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:48,890
Oh.

1979
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:49,470
Oh.

1980
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:50,570
Oh.

1981
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:51,070
Oh.

1982
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:51,410
Oh.

1983
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,970
Oh my god.

1984
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:06,270
You're making me scared.

1985
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,230
What the fuck?

1986
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,430
What the fuck?

1987
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,850
Holy shit.

1988
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,190
What the fuck?

1989
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:19,210
Is this shit?

1990
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:19,730
Oh.

1991
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:20,490
Oh.

1992
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:21,570
Oh.

1993
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:22,250
Oh.

1994
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:26,670
Oh my god.

1995
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:36,330
Oh my god.

1996
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:38,510
I was like, no one's in there before.

1997
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:40,770
Where did that come from?

1998
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,510
Oh my god.

1999
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,190
I scared the shit out of me.

2000
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,870
I'm so scared.

2001
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:49,750
Where did you go?

2002
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:51,290
Man.

2003
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:54,930
Man.

2004
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:55,690
Man.

2005
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,370
Man.

2006
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:58,070
Man.

2007
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,350
Man.

2008
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,050
Man.

2009
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,170
Where did...

2010
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:05,510
Where did she go?

2011
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:06,730
Where?

2012
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:09,950
I'm at FNAF 2?

2013
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,310
How did you get to FNAF...

2014
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,800
How did you get there?

2015
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,320
How did you get there?

2016
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,300
How did you get there?

2017
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:28,340
How did you get there?

2018
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:28,880
Oh my god.

2019
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,680
Where is it?

2020
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,620
How did you get to FNAF 2?

2021
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,440
It's just FNAF.

2022
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,960
She's at...

2023
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,700
Wait.

2024
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,880
She left my instance.

2025
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,500
What?

2026
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,020
What do you mean she left my instance?

2027
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:49,020
What do you mean she left my instance?

2028
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:49,520
Oh my god.

2029
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,700
The camera is so short when I'm fucking crooky.

2030
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,040
Holy shit.

2031
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:53,240
Wait.

2032
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,000
Where did I go?

2033
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:54,840
Oh.

2034
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:55,420
There I am.

2035
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,260
She left my instance.

2036
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,020
She deced.

2037
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:03,400
She deced.

2038
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,420
She must have deced.

2039
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,060
Okay.

2040
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,160
I'm gonna check if she's...

2041
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,700
Let's explore a little bit then.

2042
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,180
Clearly it's not that scary, right?

2043
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:13,440
Oh.

2044
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:13,960
There's legs.

2045
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,460
There I am.

2046
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:17,160
There I am.

2047
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:19,400
Hey.

2048
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,720
That's where people do that.

2049
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:21,040
Hey.

2050
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,260
That's where people do that.

2051
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:21,340
Oh.

2052
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:21,940
There's my camera.

2053
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:32,000
I go see it off FNAF.

2054
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,460
I go see it off FNAF.

2055
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,440
I don't wanna see it off FNAF anymore.

2056
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,980
I don't wanna see it off FNAF anymore.

2057
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:46,520
I don't know if I wanna see the FNAF anymore.

2058
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:47,620
I don't know if I wanna see the FNAF anymore.

2059
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,100
I don't know if I wanna see the FNAF anymore.

2060
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:49,840
Oh.

2061
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:50,700
Is this FNAF 2?

2062
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,760
I'm downloading new stuff.

2063
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,260
What is it?

2064
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,280
Udon tycoon?

2065
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,480
Why are you...

2066
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,420
What did she take me?

2067
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,120
She took me to udon tycoon.

2068
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,140
Are we playing tycoon?

2069
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,100
I'm connecting.

2070
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,140
What the fuck is udon tycoon?

2071
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:13,700
What the fuck is udon tycoon?

2072
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:14,420
What the fuck is udon tycoon?

2073
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:18,810
Oh.

2074
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:19,490
Hey.

2075
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,710
Are you doing hot spring?

2076
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:25,190
Are we doing announcement about the hot spring?

2077
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:27,110
Sure.

2078
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,430
I just picked a random place.

2079
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,990
Because I got sent to FNAF 2 and I was scared.

2080
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:31,450
Because I got sent to FNAF 2 and I was scared.

2081
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:35,530
How did you get to FNAF 2?

2082
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:36,110
Wait.

2083
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:37,010
Let me fix the camera.

2084
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:37,470
I don't know.

2085
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:39,070
I pressed the button and I was looking up to FNAF.

2086
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:41,130
We didn't get to explore FNAF.

2087
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:41,890
Okay.

2088
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:42,590
It's okay.

2089
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:43,610
It was very scary.

2090
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,630
Do you wanna go back?

2091
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:45,830
It was pretty scary.

2092
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,090
I don't know.

2093
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:50,870
We're at like udon world.

2094
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:51,250
Yeah.

2095
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,230
I was like why is she at udon tycoon?

2096
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:54,050
Oh my god.

2097
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:54,610
I'm too short.

2098
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,650
I wish you could let other people control the camera.

2099
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:58,690
Because I'm too short.

2100
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:01,370
No.

2101
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:04,310
What are you doing?

2102
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:04,850
I'm trying to...

2103
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:05,210
Change back.

2104
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,650
I'm trying to...

2105
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:08,550
I'm trying to...

2106
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,290
We'll announce as Freddy and...

2107
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:10,650

2108
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,530

2109
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:16,790

2110
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:16,810

2111
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,170
I fell back.

2112
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:25,170
We'll announce as Kroki and...

2113
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:25,950

2114
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,190

Yeah.

2118
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,110
The crossover of the century.

2119
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:40,530
Yeah.

2120
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:42,530
Alright.

2121
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:44,170
So.

2122
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,510
Because Min has another stream later on.

2123
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,110
So we gotta make this quick.

2124
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,890
How much more do you have time to set up?

2125
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:52,490
Oh.

2126
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,030

Now it's Min.

2132
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:00,790

01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:01,650

You should sing the Freddy Fazbear Tombstone song.

2219
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:03,590
Wait.

2220
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:05,090

01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:08,590
FNAF has a song from The Tombstones.

01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:10,270

I don't remember how it goes but.

2227
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:13,410
The Tombstones.

2228
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,650
But it was super popular.

2229
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:17,710
I'm Freddy Fazbear.

2230
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,950
And I like to hug and share.

2231
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:22,210
I will give you a hug.

2232
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:24,670
And I'll squish you like a bug.

2233
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:30,090
The only tombstone I know is discord.

2234
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:30,530
Discord!

2235
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,110
Discord!

2236
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:38,170
That's from My Little Pony.

2237
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,550
I'm enjoying the hot spring.

2238
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,370
I'm at what?

2239
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:49,670
I'm at what?

2240
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,450
What's the difference?

2241
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:53,510
Well, are you?

2242
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,630
Well, you knew the song!

2243
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,110
You knew the Discord song!

2244
01:10:58,810 --> 01:10:59,830
What does that make you?

2245
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:00,870
Can I get...

2246
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,930
Can I get into the hot springs too?

2247
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:05,110
Yeah, come on in.

2248
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:05,590
How does it look?

2249
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:06,830
What?

2250
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,790
It looks like you're about to fucking die.

2251
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:19,330
Someone's like, sing FNAF at the concert.

2252
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,590
Sing FNAF at the concert!

2253
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:47,330
Like, we'll just be there and be like, Har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har And then you know like, in the video there's like the lyrics on the screen and it's just har har har har har har har har har We could do it.

2254
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,110
I'm doing it while doing backflips.

2255
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:53,430
Oh my god, the best part was they were like, you can pick any song too for the concert.

2256
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:56,810
You don't have to worry about permissions and stuff because we can sing anything.

2257
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:03,690
We could just be like, har har har har har har har har har har har har har That's a classic song!

2258
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:04,270
I know!

2259
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,410
That would be like the...

2260
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:06,710
That's royalty free!

2261
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:10,310
That would be like the most expensive shitpost we've ever done.

2262
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,330
That would be really good.

2263
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:24,630
Two thousand people like waving their pen lights and be like, har har har har har har And the Freddy Fazbear light colors.

2264
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:26,950
And together everybody!

2265
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:35,110
har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har

2266
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,650
Oh my god.

2267
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,390
Yeah we should do it!

2268
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,090
We should do it!

2269
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:51,910
We're gonna leak one song from the setlist.

2270
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:55,870
We will sing a Freddy Faz...

2271
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,190
We're singing a FNAF song.

2272
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,150
No, it has to be that one.

2273
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:01,130
Yeah, yeah.

2274
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:02,730
What?

2275
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,290
I have a mic.

2276
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:05,430
What do you mean?

2277
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:08,210
Oh, you're Freddy Fazbear!

2278
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:11,570
I'm really Freddy Fazbear!

2279
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:12,830
Wait, where'd it go?

2280
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,230
Where'd it go?

2281
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:14,650
I don't know.

2282
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:15,930
Where'd it go?

2283
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,990
Oh, it's like hand gesture, right?

2284
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,750
Yeah, I think so.

2285
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:21,670
Yeah, it seems like a hand gesture thing.

2286
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,650
The crossover of the century.

2287
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,410
Crow and...Croaky and Freddy Fazbear.

2288
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,570
And Freddy Fazbear.

2289
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:30,450
That's me.

2290
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:31,770
I'll be there.

2291
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:34,690
Is this your tickets to meet me, Freddy Fazbear?

2292
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:35,550
Yeah, meet Golden Freddy.

2293
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,290
You can meet...

2294
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:40,610
You can meet Golden Freddy in Canada!

2295
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:43,390
I'm going to Canada!

2296
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:44,170
Oh my god!

2297
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,570
He's going to Canada!

2298
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:47,330
What are you doing?

2299
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:47,770
Hold on.

2300
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:48,890
What are you doing?

2301
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,650
Is that the bite of 87?

2302
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:51,410
One second.

2303
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:56,130
Wait.

2304
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:57,230
Wait.

2305
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:02,070
I'm...I'm...I'm...

2306
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:03,490
I'm Freddy-ing it up right now.

2307
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,530
You're Freddy-ing it up?

2308
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,190
Are you figuring out your hand gestures?

2309
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:07,030
Yeah, I'm Freddy-ing it up.

2310
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,270
Oh my god.

2311
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:09,870
She's going to Freddy it up.

2312
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,910
I'm going to Freddy it up.

2313
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:13,230
She's going to do it.

2314
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:15,830
She's going to do it.

2315
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:17,590
Wait, where did she go?

2316
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:19,450
Oh my god.

2317
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:22,130
Oh my god.

2318
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,030
It's a frog.

2319
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:33,530
What's your name, sir?

2320
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,970
Can you say that again?

2321
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,710
Can you say that again?

2322
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:45,150
Can you say that again?

2323
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:45,990
Can you say that again?

2324
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:51,780
Can you repeat that?

2325
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,240
Please, I'm crazy.

2326
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:53,600
Please, I'm crazy.

2327
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,440
Please tell yourself that you're always wanting to go to Canada.

2328
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,020
Oh my god!

2329
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:03,920
Frogbert!

2330
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:04,560
Hello!

2331
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,760
How do you feel about going to Canada, Frogbert?

2332
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,160
Yeah, I'm going to go there.

2333
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,900
I'm going to really soak it all in.

2334
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:15,820
Oh my god.

2335
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,740
You're going to see the tropical rainforest in Canada?

2336
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,140
Oh yeah.

2337
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,180
I'm excited.

2338
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:27,080
I've got my sparklers ready for all the excitement I'm going to have.

2339
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,820
Oh my god.

2340
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:29,960
Is Frogbert going to sing?

2341
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,060
I'll sing if Akroki will sing.

2342
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,520
You'll have to see it find out.

2343
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,580
You'll have to come to the concert to find out.

2344
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:45,200
If someone is making their first Canadian debut.

2345
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:46,180
Woo!

2346
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,940
You guys hear that?

2347
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,600
You guys got to go to Canada.

2348
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,900
I'm going to see your Oshie Frogbert doing a funky little dance.

2349
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,160
Frogbert, do a little dance for us.

2350
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,100
To show your excitement.

2351
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,370
Oh my god.

2352
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:07,210
He's feeling himself.

2353
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:08,990
He's feeling himself.

2354
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:09,690
Look at him.

2355
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,570
He's touching himself right now.

2356
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:12,510
Oh my god.

2357
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:14,470
Spank that butt.

2358
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,840
He's like guys don't miss out.

2359
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,200
Don't miss out.

2360
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,180
Don't miss out.

2361
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:33,880
Don't miss out.

2362
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:34,120
Yeah!

2363
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,220
Say goodbye to Frogbert.

2364
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,520
Say goodbye to...

2365
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,120
Oh my god.

2366
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,100
We're getting everybody's Oshies today.

2367
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,440
Okay.

2368
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,240
I'm back.

2369
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,100
Welcome back.

2370
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:49,460
Oh my god.

2371
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:49,960
You missed out.

2372
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,380
You missed Frogbert.

2373
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,660
Oh he was here?

2374
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,240
Yeah.

2375
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,800
Good thing I wasn't then.

2376
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:57,900
You missed out.

2377
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:58,320
I know.

2378
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,080
I think I'm good.

2379
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,420
I think I'm good.

2380
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:02,100
I think I'm good.

2381
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,640
I think that guy is a menace.

2382
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,280
Oh my god.

2383
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:04,740
He was like...

2384
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,280
He shook his ass for us.

2385
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,280
He like gave us a little smack too.

2386
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,040
Like poof.

2387
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:09,600
Like that.

2388
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,260
It was crazy.

2389
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,680
Wait but Frogbert's going to be in Canada too.

2390
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,020
Are you guys going to cross paths?

2391
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,280
Oh maybe.

2392
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:22,160
If he does, I'm going to have my shank ready.

2393
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:22,600
Oh.

2394
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,420
That's scary.

2395
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,740
Yeah Frogbert watch out.

2396
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:26,760
She's got her shank.

2397
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:27,880
Watch out.

2398
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,860
Watch out.

2399
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:31,840
Alright.

2400
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:32,680
Thank you.

2401
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,020
I'm on to you Froggy boy.

2402
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,600
Thank you to Mint for coming here.

2403
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,760
For this not so special day.

2404
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,800
It's just a normal day.

2405
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:44,360
Yeah.

2406
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,680
For a little announcement together.

2407
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,080
I had so much fun.

2408
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,040
Come to the convention.

2409
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,280
Come to Canada.

2410
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:53,860
Come to Con... Oh shit.

2411
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:54,860
Come to Canada.

2412
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:00,360
More details will be out soon regarding the concert everybody.

2413
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,220
So look forward to it guys.

2414
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,680
I'm so excited to see you all there.

2415
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,620
Dragoons and Wisp and everybody else.

2416
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,700
Frogbert and Oshie.

2417
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,440
What are Frogbert's fans called?

2418
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:12,600
Tadpoos?

2419
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:13,400
Oh I don't know.

2420
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,480
Tadbird?

2421
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:15,060
Tadpoos.

2422
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,420
The Tadbirds.

2423
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:18,060
Oh Pyromaniac.

2424
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:19,420
The Tadbirds.

2425
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,440
The Tadbirds.

2426
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:22,920
I don't know.

2427
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,240
We'll have to...

2428
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,640
Maybe if Frogbert makes like a Vtuber debut he can come up with something.

2429
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:31,480
True.

2430
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:32,720
It's not your job.

2431
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,540
He's got his own business going on.

2432
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:33,700
Yeah exactly.

2433
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,140
That's not your job.

2434
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,160
He has to do it himself.

2435
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:37,760
I'm too busy you guys.

2436
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,800

01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,060

there's Foxy, there's Chica, that's true Chica.

2457
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,240
You want a Spicy Chica.

Someone's been looking at the wrong Chica file.

2462
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,020
Probably Foxy.

2463
01:19:59,020 --> 01:19:59,780
I like Foxy.

2464
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,960
You got that fox in ya.

2465
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,760
That's a little dangerous.

2466
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,700
He has the little hook hands too.

2467
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:11,960
Yeah.

2468
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,760

2491
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,100

Um, and like hanging out with me.

2495
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,700
I didn't really have anything.

2496
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:01,520
I said it's not a special day or anything.

2497
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,340
So I had like not anything planned.

2498
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,580
I just wanted to hang out.

2499
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,940
But like I had to stream today.

2500
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,400
So I thought it was a... I really appreciate Mint for dropping by.

2501
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,220
I literally was like, hey, um...

2502
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,160
I have no plans.

2503
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:12,920
Do you want to do like...

2504
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,080
VR chat stuff together?

2505
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,840
And then we can use it to announce our concert together.

2506
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,740
So she was like, yeah, we can do it.

2507
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,640
Like, um, after she was like, oh, you want me to...

2508
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,560
I can cancel my stream.

2509
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,460
I was like, no, no, no, no.

2510
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:22,920
Don't cancel.

2511
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:23,360
Don't cancel.

2512
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,980
We can do it like before your stream or after your stream.

2513
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,860
And then, um, we were like, oh, we'll just do a little short thing and just announce it.

2514
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:31,920
And then like you do your stream.

2515
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,320
Your stream is more important because like the WIS want to watch.

2516
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:37,260
Um, you know, it's a solo stream.

2517
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,240
The WIS won't watch you.

2518
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:42,620
Um, but I really appreciate it because like, you know, she was like, oh, no, it's okay.

2519
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:47,440
I can, I can like, I can like drop by for a bit before the stream and everything.

2520
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,680
And it was really sweet.

2521
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,640
I was like, oh, you won big time.

2522
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,660
Because like, you know, she, I like found out last...

2523
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:58,420
I was like, I was like, oh my god, I need to, I need to, uh, I need to do this announcement.

2524
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,440
I was like, I was like, I figured out I had to do something today.

2525
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,560
So I was like, oh my gosh, okay, what do I do on this normal day?

2526
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:14,500
Because I figured like you guys would want me to stream something today.

2527
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:17,780
Um, but I've been enjoying my break and everything.

2528
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,240
Just like, relaxing and chilling in the hot springs.

01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:27,080
Um, I've just been like, mostly just chilling, I guess.

2530
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,840

01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,060
It's actually been really nice.

I've been touching grass.

2535
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,320

2536
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,240

And just like, um, dad met a lot of like, oh it was so funny because uh, when I brought dad over to the dog park, it was like his first time at this particular dog park.

2541
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:05,680
And like, we accident- like, uh, we brought like this giant ass tennis ball that was way too big for his head.

01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:14,340
And like he was just carrying around like, He was just carrying around the tennis ball, just walking around and was like, this is my ball.

2543
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:18,000
And then every dog that comes over trying to like play with him, he's like, NO!

2544
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,340
This is MY ball!

2545
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:21,380

That's why I tweeted.

2588
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,500
I don't really...

2589
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,900
I didn't want to play any video games.

2590
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:17,860
I just wanted to like...

2591
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:20,040
do something non-gaming related.

2592
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:22,920
Um...

2593
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:23,780

But yeah, no thoughts.

Head empty.

2596
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,240
Yeah, just no thoughts.

2597
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:27,660
Head empty.

2598
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:29,200
But thank you everybody for coming!

2599
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:31,600

We have plenty of time.

2603
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,360
Let me see if there's any worlds I want to visit while we're here.

2604
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,180
I need to blow my nose.

2605
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:42,840
Give me a sec.

2606
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:43,740
I need to hydrate.

2607
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,840
I haven't even drank any water.

2608
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,040
Let me drink the hot spring water.

2609
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:49,300
No way!

2610
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,000
That's unhealth hygienic.

2611
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,060
Um... Give me a sec.

2612
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,460
I'm going to mute myself and blow my nose and drink...

2613
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:56,820
drink hydrate because I haven't hydrated at all.

2614
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,100
I think you guys can hear from my voice.

2615
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,860
Give me a sec.

2616
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,340
Oh... Where's the mouse?

2617
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,940
I need to mute myself.

2618
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:38,730
Alright.

2619
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:40,030
I'm back.

2620
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:41,290
Okay.

2621
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,310
I'm back guys.

2622
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:43,330
But yeah!

2623
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:45,110
It's been...

2624
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:51,750
Um... I've been having a nice, just relaxing day and uh...

2625
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:52,930
I'm really excited.

2626
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:57,050
When they told me I'm doing a concert for Anime Revolution.

2627
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:58,850
Anime Revolution.

2628
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:01,930
Um... I was like...

2629
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:02,510
What?

2630
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:08,810
You know it was like... It was one of those moments where I like said yes to everything when it came to conventions.

2631
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:11,450
So I didn't realize what I said yes to.

2632
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:14,110
So like they were like... It's going to be an hour long concert.

2633
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:14,850
Um...

2634
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:17,230
And like it seats like 2000 people.

2635
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:19,250
I was like... What?

2636
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:25,010
I was like...

2637
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,930
Wait... I said yes to this?

2638
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:31,970
I signed the contract for this?

2639
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:32,530
What?

2640
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:33,750
Oh my gosh.

2641
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:34,690
I don't remember.

2642
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:36,650
And then um...

2643
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:39,470
So I was like...

2644
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:40,930
I was not expecting it.

2645
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,150
And I was not...

2646
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:45,550
I was not paying attention at all.

2647
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:47,350
And uh...

2648
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:49,330
And then so then I was just like... Oh no.

2649
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:53,550
I don't know if I want to sing for like an hour by myself.

2650
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:58,350
So I asked like if Mint... Because I know Mint really loves doing concerts and everything.

2651
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:01,730
And that she enjoys like you know singing to everybody.

2652
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:05,510
I was like... Mint do you wanna uh... do you wanna...

2653
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,390
uh... you know...

2654
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:09,050
uh... sing like...

2655
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,130
uh... you wanna sing in this concert?

2656
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:13,310
Um... I can give you like half the...

2657
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:16,250
like... like give you half the program if you want.

2658
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:18,030
Um...

2659
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:19,670
Yeah so...

2660
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:23,910
uh... yeah she's really good at concerts so I invited her as a guest and be like you wanna sing?

2661
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:29,210
Because like you know I have... you know we should concert and you know you're...

2662
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:30,310
you love concerts.

2663
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:35,450
Yeah so...

2664
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:47,790
I'm really excited and for those who can't make it who can't make it to the convention and the concert um... we will have like something special that's gonna be uploaded after the concert for those who can't make it.

2665
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:58,550
I mean it won't be like you know it won't be like the full set list of like you know we won't have like the whole recording of the concert being uploaded or anything but it will be something special um... that we made for people who can't make it.

2666
01:28:59,010 --> 01:28:59,430
Um...

2667
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:04,850
to be able to like you know also have a fun time and also enjoy themselves even though like they're not there.

2668
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:08,930
They could get... because you know traveling and hotels accommodations is very expensive.

2669
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:12,450
So Mint and I we will upload something I think like on my channel.

2670
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:13,530
Um...

2671
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:18,230
Uh... something special Uh... for you guys who won't be there.

2672
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:19,110
Um...

2673
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:20,290
So yeah!

2674
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:26,090
Hor hor hor hor hor hor hor hor hor hor hor I can't wait.

2675
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:28,050
That's the only song that we're leaking for you guys.

2676
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:29,190
That's gonna be in the set list.

2677
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:35,850
Hor hor hor hor hor hor hor hor I don't think Anime Revolution has like streaming tickets set up.

2678
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:36,230
Like...

2679
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:40,770
I think that's like... I don't think they've ever done streaming tickets before.

2680
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:50,430
I know like that's so much to set up in general cause like you have to make a deal with like these streaming set up streaming places like streaming platforms for like tickets and stuff.

2681
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:51,490
That's a lot to set up.

2682
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:52,050
So...

2683
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:53,710
So...

2684
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:57,310
Like... that's like...

2685
01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:01,470
I feel like that's like not in time to to set something up like that.

2686
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:01,850
...

2687
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:02,610
...

2688
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,350
Um...

2689
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:11,230
Also like with the song choices that we have cause like we can pick any songs too.

2690
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:12,090
...

2691
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:14,830
We can pick any songs too.

2692
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:23,690
So like I don't think like rights in general like legal rights for like song picks would work if we stream it.

2693
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:25,890
Cause we could literally pick anything we want to sing.

2694
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:26,710
...

2695
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:30,890
Um...

2696
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:33,790
Yeah, we can pick any song.

2697
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:36,410
They were like, don't worry about what songs you want to sing.

2698
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:38,250
You can pick anything you want.

2699
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:39,230
And I'm like, nice.

2700
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:40,390
Nice.

2701
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:42,990
This was before Mint got invited as a guest.

2702
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:44,230
So I was like, nice.

2703
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:46,730
She'll only be a guest at the concert portion.

2704
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:51,710
So the other stuff like the panels and the meet and greets and stuff like that is just me.

2705
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:54,650
But she'll be there for the concert for those who are wondering.

2706
01:30:54,650 --> 01:31:00,670
Like for any WISPs that are coming over to see if there's like meet and greets for Mint or like panel or anything.

2707
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:04,170
It's just me for the rest.

2708
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:05,550
But she'll be there for the concert.

2709
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:08,890
I want to go to another world.

2710
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:11,250
It's been nice chilling in the hot spring.

2711
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:14,210
I want to go somewhere new.

2712
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:19,190
I want to stream until Mint goes live and they'll raid her.

2713
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:20,950
How many more minutes?

2714
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:21,590
15 minutes.

2715
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:22,710
Alright, let's relax.

2716
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:24,630
Bye bye.

2717
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:27,650
Let's see.

2718
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:28,490
Search words.

2719
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:31,970
I hope the volume was okay.

2720
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:37,130
I saw like my sound guy was like, turn down, turn it down, turn it down.

2721
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:39,170
I don't know if I turned it down enough.

2722
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:40,150
I don't know.

2723
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:43,170
I turned down so many things.

2724
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:44,970
I don't know.

2725
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:46,870
I don't know if I turned it enough.

2726
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:49,410
I hope the volume was fine.

2727
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:54,350
Mint moved her stream.

2728
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:56,190
She goes live in 45...

2729
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:56,410
Okay.

2730
01:31:56,630 --> 01:31:59,050
Well, I'm not staying in VR for 45 minutes.

2731
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:03,650
I'll just... I'll raid into her waiting room.

2732
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:08,830
Sorry guys.

2733
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:13,130
I love Mint but I'm not fucking streaming 45 more minutes of VR.

2734
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:14,370
I need it.

2735
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:15,910
I would take this off.

2736
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:21,550
Alright.

2737
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:23,090
Boop.

2738
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:24,470
Boop.

2739
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,110
Drop order.

2740
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:30,690
I want a cake.

2741
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:36,430
You know what's worse?

2742
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:36,990
Something else.

2743
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:39,090
To celebrate this normal day.

2744
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,470
Happy birthday!

2745
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:44,650
Whose birthday is it?

2746
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:46,030
Is it anybody's birthday?

2747
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:51,050
Is it anybody's birthday?

2748
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:52,050
Okay.

2749
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:52,290
Wait.

2750
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:53,950
Let me make sure it's local.

2751
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:57,110
And then... look at me.

2752
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:58,630
I'm so bad at this.

2753
01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:01,150
Like... I'm so bad at the cam...

2754
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:02,390
I don't know how Mint does this.

2755
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:05,850
I... I'm so bad at the camera.

2756
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:08,430
I'm sorry.

2757
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:11,530
I'm sorry for my poor camera work, everybody.

2758
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,250
I'm trying my best.

2759
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,270
I'm sorry.

2760
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:21,030
Whose birthday is it?

2761
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,510
Is it today?

2762
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,110
Is it anybody's birthday?

2763
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:24,350
Wait.

2764
01:33:24,450 --> 01:33:26,950
I thought this would have a thing where we can...

2765
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:28,070
Oh my gosh.

2766
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:28,390
Wait.

2767
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:29,970
Wait.

2768
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:31,310
Can I not blow the candle though?

2769
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:32,430
Oh I can!

2770
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:33,230
Wait.

2771
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:33,730
How do I blow it?

2772
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:36,310
Okay.

2773
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,490
You guys can't see that.

2774
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:37,970
Okay.

2775
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:39,370
Maybe this is not the best world.

2776
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:40,050
Maybe.

2777
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:40,770
I'm gonna sit down.

2778
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:42,830
I've been standing up a long time.

2779
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:43,510
Woo!

2780
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:44,910

2781
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:45,570

2782
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:46,570

2783
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,730
Happy birthday to you.

2784
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:53,150
Happy birthday to you.

2785
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:56,030
Happy birthday dear dragons.

2786
01:33:56,650 --> 01:33:58,530
Happy birthday to you.

2787
01:33:58,870 --> 01:33:59,330

2788
01:34:01,850 --> 01:34:02,310

2789
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,930
Is there anyone where you can like pick up the cake and be like...

2790
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:08,390
That would be so cool.

2791
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:10,970
I wonder if they actually have that function.

2792
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:13,630
That would be so cute if they did.

2793
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:14,410
Oh my gosh.

2794
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:15,230
Let's go to the bar!

2795
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:18,490
Wait.

2796
01:34:18,530 --> 01:34:18,910
Actually no.

2797
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:19,270
Let's not.

2798
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:21,670
Some of you guys might not be legal enough to go to the bar.

2799
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:22,590
I don't wanna get in trouble.

2800
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:24,690
I don't wanna get in trouble with the police.

2801
01:34:25,890 --> 01:34:26,250
Okay.

2802
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:27,110
Let's go to the air.

2803
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:27,890
Maybe the air?

2804
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:29,210

01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:38,070
Some of you guys are not...

2807
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:41,870
Different countries have different drinking laws.

2808
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,350
I don't wanna get in trouble with the law.

2809
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:44,850
I don't wanna get in trouble with the cops.

2810
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:46,530

I don't know how Mint does this.

2841
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:13,990
I don't know how she does VR chats so often.

2842
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:18,050
Maybe if I do more VR chats I can do this better.

2843
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:19,050
Guys!

2844
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:21,530

2861
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:11,910
I can say that officially by this week I'm currently working on a 3D modeler.

2862
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:13,650

2863
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:17,510

2864
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:19,090
A 3D modeler.

2865
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:20,070

Well almost every day.

2884
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:17,390

01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:18,510
But almost every day!

2886
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:23,130

2893
01:38:35,470 --> 01:38:37,130
So many wild things.

2894
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:39,570
