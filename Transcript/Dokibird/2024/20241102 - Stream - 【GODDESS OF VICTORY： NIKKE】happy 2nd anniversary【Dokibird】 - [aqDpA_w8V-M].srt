1
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,710
Hello, everybody!

2
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,850
Hello, hello!

3
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,330
Oh my god, I can't believe it's been two years.

4
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,650
Oh, Holly!

5
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,330
Oh my god!

6
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:34,750
Our favorite game, Goddess of Victory, Nikkei, has reached its second year anniversary!

7
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,250
And I'll say thank you, huge thank you, to Nikkei for sponsoring me for today's stream.

8
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,550
For those who don't know, I've actually been sponsored sort of yearly by Nikkei in the past.

9
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:57,150
Like, I was there during pre-launch, I was there during the first year anniversary, and now we're here for the second year anniversary.

10
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,910
Is that crazy?

11
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,730
The commander is back!

12
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:17,650
For those who don't know about this game, it's basically, you are a commander, and there's some really pretty ladies here.

13
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,990
But it's okay, they're not real, they're like robots.

14
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,250
So they're like beautiful robot ladies that's trying to save the world, and you are the commander.

15
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,350
And it's all about the gun physics, nothing else.

16
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:44,290
I was just thinking back about the clip that I did that sort of went viral.

17
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,110
For the gun physics, of course, like, oh my gosh, the guns were so accurate.

18
00:03:51,270 --> 00:04:01,350
The recoil, the shooting, the look of the gun itself, how the gun was held, and how it was shaking and everything.

19
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,570
Wow!

20
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,350
It's all about- oh, and the volume of the gun!

21
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,950
Yes, yes.

22
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:26,050
So, like I said, huge shout out to Nikkei for- when my staff told me that Nikkei wanted to sponsor me, I was like, do what you can to make sure that I get this sponsor!

23
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,250
Secure it!

24
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:46,770
Because, like I said, it is a very special sponsor to me, I feel like, because we've been through a lot with Nikkei, so it's really great to be back with the game, you know, being back here, and then a goddess of victory still wants to sponsor me.

25
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,610
At least it's tradition at this point.

26
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,110
Yeah, it is!

27
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,850
It is tradition!

28
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,550
So, I need to remember what to say.

29
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,990
Professional VTuber here.

30
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,030
But yes, this is actually a shooter game.

31
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:13,850
You control the beautiful anime girls, and each of them has different guns and different utils, different skills, and you control them.

32
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:23,430
So, before we begin, we're gonna watch a couple of trailers regarding their second year anniversary and the release of their newest character, Cinderella.

33
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,050
So, yes, I know, it sounds like I'm reading off of something.

34
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,410
I'm sorry!

35
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,090
I don't know, I just sound natural.

36
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,010
I'm so sorry!

37
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,050
But there's a new character coming out named Cinderella, and you can actually pull her right now, I believe.

38
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,810
I think she's out.

39
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,610
She was out yesterday.

40
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,650
And you know what's funny?

41
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,450
I don't have access to my old account anymore, so I had to create a new account.

42
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,890
And thank god, I could use my own link.

43
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,550
I can use my own link.

44
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:09,410
So, please, if you want to support the stream, and if you want to get 200 free pulls, click the link on the description slash pinned on the chat, so you can also get some free pulls from the link itself.

45
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,790
So, you can get 200 free pulls.

46
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,530
So, I don't know, 200 is a lot.

47
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,730
So, like, I used my own link to also create my own account as well.

48
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,370
So, thank god.

49
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,350
Yes, I'm plus one on my own tracking link.

50
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,190
At least, if nobody else uses this, at least I know I used it.

51
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:36,410
But yes, I actually saw, right, that you guys, a lot of you guys actually got into Nikkei because of me.

52
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,250
Because of the gun physics.

53
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:48,950
Because, like, two years ago, a lot of you guys got into the not crippling addiction of Nikkei because of me.

54
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,610
And I'll say, good.

55
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,130
And I hope I can get more dragoons into this game.

56
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,570
How is it my fault?

57
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,270
You should be thanking me at this point.

58
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,150
So, for those who've never played this game, don't worry.

59
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,990
You'll know why.

60
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:13,230
You'll know why some of the dragoons got pulled into um, let's go gambling for this game.

61
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,790
You'll know why after you see the gameplay.

62
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,690
But before we begin, I want to show you guys, I didn't never watch the trailers yet.

63
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,650
So, I want to see, I think one of the first trailer is regarding Cinderella, the newest character.

64
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,970
And then the other one is about their newest animated PV.

65
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,990
So, we're gonna check them out now.

66
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,550
All right, here we go.

67
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,150
Let me know, sound guy, if the volume is too loud or if it's okay.

68
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,450
All right, it should be this.

69
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,930
Whoa.

70
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,310
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

71
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,670
What is the happiest memory?

72
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,490
Oh yeah, because I did.

73
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,550
Okay.

74
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,430
Also, oh my god.

75
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,570
Whoa, they're beautiful.

76
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:02,350
Also, before we keep going, it just reminded me, because I had to create a new account.

77
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:09,350
Um, because I had to create a new account, um, I had to re-experience the trauma of the first chapter.

78
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,750
So, I forgot how sad the first chapter was.

79
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,270
I was like, what the... I was just like, what the fuck?

80
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,990
That's the first chapter.

81
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,090
Anyway, so yeah, spoiler warning, but the first chapter is pretty sad.

82
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,730
Spoiler warning.

83
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,510
Mirror, mirror.

84
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,350
Oh, there she is.

85
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,210
What is the most beautiful Oh my god, that's me!

86
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,750
If I, like, didn't dye my hair!

87
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,070
The goddess that fight for mankind.

88
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:42,530
Mirror, mirror.

89
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,690
Who is the most beautiful person in this world?

90
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,270
You're Cinderella.

91
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,270
You're not, you're not the evil queen.

92
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,830
Oh, oh my god.

93
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,670
Whoa!

94
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,930
I'm looking at her shoes.

95
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,570
I'm looking at... Whoa!

96
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,490
Those are some nice shoes.

97
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,650
Oh, I love it.

98
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,570
I need, like, the... Whoa!

99
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,830
No, it's nice guns.

100
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,030
Nice guns.

101
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,970
Okay, okay, sorry.

102
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,610
Sorry.

103
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,610
With you looking after me, I will stay beautiful for eternity.

104
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,210
Yeah, her weapons are so cool, guys.

105
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,630
Her weapons are so cool.

106
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,670
God, I hope I pull Cinderella.

107
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,670
I don't know how many pulls I get, but, like, I hope I pull Cinderella.

108
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:03,970
All right.

109
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,450
All right, this is the next trailer.

110
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:11,730
That was the Cinderella video, which advertises, you know, makes me really want to pull her now, right, guys?

111
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,250
Because of her sick-ass guns.

112
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,230
I don't know, it really makes me want to pull her.

113
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,890
But knowing my gotcha luck, I don't know.

114
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,830
I have very limited pulls here.

115
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,290
All right, this should be... This should be the other video.

116
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,630
And I think this is the animated PV for the story itself.

117
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,170
Wait, does it work?

118
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,090
Guys, why it no work?

119
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,330
Guys, sorry, I didn't test the second video.

120
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,490
The second video, give me a sec.

121
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,350
Give me a sec.

122
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,510
The second video is, like, a PV for the animation.

123
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,790
Give me a sec.

124
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,270
Oh, I know why it didn't work.

125
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,310
Sorry, I didn't test the second video.

126
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,710
Guys, I'm a professional here.

127
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,850
I didn't finish downloading the video.

128
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,290
I am so sorry.

129
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,190
I am so sorry.

130
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,110
Doing it live.

131
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,710
Wait, what was it called?

132
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,130
What was the video?

133
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,410
Why fast inrev, no download.

134
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,930
It didn't fully download!

135
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,030
I assume it would fully download.

136
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

137
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,630
Oh, you guys didn't hear that.

138
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,530
You guys didn't hear it.

139
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,590
Don't worry, I'm downloading it now.

140
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,590
I have fast internet.

141
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,490
I have very fast internet, so do not worry.

142
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:01,590
Anyway, guys, while we're downloading the second PV, I need you guys to help me for something.

143
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,990
All right, I need you guys to help me.

144
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,390
I want to change the girl on my... I forgot to change the girl on the lobby.

145
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,330
I want to change her.

146
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,790
Oh, nice!

147
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,130
Look at that.

148
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,510
By the way, there's like a ton of bonuses.

149
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,850
Now, oh yeah, by the way, this is like the best time to come back to...

150
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,730
If you haven't played NiKi in a while or if you're a new player, this is the best time.

151
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,610
There's apparently all the stuff you can get from the second year anniversary.

152
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,350
Like, look at it.

153
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,170
I don't even want to read all of this because there's so much.

154
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:45,570
Like, these are all the stuff you can get right now for coming back to NiKi at the moment.

155
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,130
There's a lot.

156
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,030
I don't even know what Rapunzel is.

157
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,610
Yeah, you get Snow White and... Oh, is that... Which one's Snow White and which one's Rapunzel?

158
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,870
Like, oh my gosh.

159
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,050
Yeah, so there's a lot of stuff you can get.

160
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:06,550
Recruit vouchers, advanced recruit vouchers, advanced recruit vouchers, advanced... Like, more advanced recruit vouchers.

161
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,890
It's a lot of rolls.

162
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,810
That's what I'm saying.

163
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,850
That's what I'm saying.

164
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,930
I'll come back today with my link, of course.

165
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,310

Click on the link on my pin chat if you guys want to grab all these free things because they only... Because it only... You can only get it by clicking my link.

167
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,070
Disclaimer, that's not true, but like, just... I'd like to think that.

168
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,670
Oh, again.

169
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,070
I got Pilgrim.

170
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,850
Wait, is this... Oh, I got it!

171
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,350
I got it!

172
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,390
Rapunzel, see?

173
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,270
This is what happens!

174
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,570
Free Rapunzel, right here!

175
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,730
Oh, look at that.

176
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,030
Just as I said, you get free... See?

177
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,630
Just as I said, you get free Rapunzel, right there.

178
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,930
I told you.

179
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,510
You thought I was fucking you guys.

180
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,270
I literally got free Rapunzel.

181
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,490
Look at that.

182
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:56,690
Whoa.

183
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,830
Look at that.

184
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,630
Also, how do I change her?

185
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,490
Like, I...

186
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,010
How do I change her?

187
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,490
I'm sorry, but like, I literally got... I got new girl.

188
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,210
A new girl, so like, I want a new girl.

189
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,030
Top, right?

190
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,090
Which one?

191
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,210
Which one is it?

192
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,750
Guys, top this one?

193
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,310
The end here?

194
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,330
Is that it?

195
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,630
The four box?

196
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,490
Okay, I don't know what happens if I click that.

197
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,070
Alright, I gotta be sure.

198
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,370
Is it lobby or settings?

199
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,470
Is it lobby?

200
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,490
Oh, it is!

201
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,150
Get out.

202
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,110
Oh my gosh.

203
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,630
I'm gonna put Rapunzel in here, and then I'm gonna put... Alright, nice.

204
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,870
Okay, save.

205
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,590
Oh my god!

206
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,770
Oh, thank you, Rapunzel.

207
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,510
Rapunzel, Rapunzel.

208
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,170
Let down your...

209
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,430
Let down your... Let down your golden hair.

210
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,070
Sorry, sorry.

211
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:05,730
Whoa!

212
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,970
Oh, she's freaking out.

213
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,190
Oh, please.

214
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,510
Yes, Rapunzel, can you please pray for me?

215
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,490
Okay, oh, I have so many bonuses.

216
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,630
Oh my god, Aether.

217
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,730
I remember her.

218
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,930
I kept fucking getting...

219
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:38,270
Guys, okay, this is more so of like trauma, but I don't like Aether because I have PTSD from...

220
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,090
Doing pulls and only getting Aether.

221
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,850
And she's back!

222
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,550
No!

223
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,250
No!

224
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,890
She's back!

225
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,750
No, I thought I got rid of you.

226
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,450
How could you come back?

227
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,210
I thought we were rid of you.

228
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,330
Oh, wait, what's arcade?

229
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:04,830
Hey, noob.

230
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,450
I know her.

231
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,530
Hey there, Mr. Commander.

232
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,230
Commander.

233
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,950
It's pretty clear why you're all here.

234
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,710
Wait, why?

235
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,570
It's just like old times, but new faces.

236
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,190
You're as perceptive as ever.

237
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,050
Also, I brought up the game a little bit.

238
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,910
Oh, sound guy.

239
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,510
Why don't you take a look at this?

240
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,950
I don't know what the arcade was.

241
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,570
I had to click...

242
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,170
I know I was supposed to check out the second year anniversary stuff, but like, I've never seen the arcade before.

243
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,790
You think that's just an ordinary handheld?

244
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,450
We're very disappointed in you.

245
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,130
It's far more than that.

246
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,030
Oh, I love her little, like, hair tuft here.

247
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,790
It's so cute.

248
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,850
Does it have some kind of special features?

249
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,150
It sure does.

250
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,330
It compiles all the unofficial games floating through the arc.

251
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,550
Wait, consider the dire state of the indie game you're seeing here.

252
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,970
That thing is a godsend.

253
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,050
I don't know why, but I think she sounds like that.

254
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,870
Uh, Nikkei on the first day of November is wild!

255
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,730
Thank you.

256
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,230
It's the true test.

257
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,950
If you guys can make it through today, you can make it through any other day.

258
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,730
It also has automatic updates.

259
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,530
Um, so you don't have to worry about that.

260
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,430
Super cool.

261
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,350
All right, time to pass the baton to Troni.

262
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,650
She'll tell you more about all the tech that went into this bad boy.

263
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,550
What is this?

264
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,430
What is the arcade?

265
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,410
This is a major achievement.

266
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,970
We would be telling as many people about it as possible.

267
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,630
Um, so first I designed the interior casing and circuitry, uh...

268
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,670
Did all the exterior design and UX.

269
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,230
Isira did all the software.

270
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,990
That's about it.

271
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,550
What's the arcade?

272
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,750
Wow, a game console crafted by none other than the arc's most prominent gaming experts?

273
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:01,930
Amazing!

274
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,670
You really think so?

275
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,110
Nice.

276
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,630
That's what I was wanting to hear.

277
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,730
You bet it's amazing!

278
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,010
Now, what we want you from you is this.

279
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,770
You gotta fire up this console and play games until you can't possibly play anymore.

280
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,210
Wait, I can play video games within the video game?

281
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,150
Perfect!

282
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,970
What is this?

283
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,150
Oh my god!

284
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,870
Wait, that's so cute!

285
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,000
Wait, I wanna play!

286
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh my god, wait, what?

287
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,600
Okay, are you ready?

288
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,460
I love barbecues.

289
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,500
I was born ready.

290
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,640
How about you, master?

291
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,560
I'm its commander here.

292
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,400
Good!

293
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,300
Charcoal.

294
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,360
I love barbecue!

295
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,180
I love the arcade.

296
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,840
Wait, when do I play?

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,920
Like, is this a game?

298
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,740
Is this?

299
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,020
With pleasure.

300
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,520
Focus!

301
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,600
Fire!

302
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:05,820
Guys, I'm sorry.

303
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,400
I know I was supposed to check the second year anniversary.

304
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,260
I got distracted.

305
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,180
I'm so sorry.

306
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:19,920
Guys, please click on the link and help me out so like they can forgive me for not checking out the second year anniversary straight away.

307
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,500
We're the dookies of dookies.

308
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
I really enjoy your streams.

309
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,900
Keep on laughing, dookie.

310
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,720
Thank you for the akasuba.

311
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,380
Thank you, thank you.

312
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,780
Wait, I should auto it.

313
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,500
You're right.

314
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,960
Be quiet, commander.

315
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,720
Can't you see that Neon is concentrating?

316
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,920
Did you bring the skewers and the ingredients?

317
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,560
Our customers are very particular, so we gotta be sure to include the things they like.

318
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,260
It's ignited!

319
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,660
Good deal!

320
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,020
Commander, I'll put you on skewer duty.

321
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,940
Then Neon will do the cooking.

322
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,140
What will you be doing?

323
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,580
I'll receive our customers.

324
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,720
It's not lucky.

325
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,900
We have thons of wait.

326
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,520
Oh, what?

327
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Thons of customers on this island.

328
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,500
I hereby pronounce our barbecue is un- sorry, we were supposed to do polls too.

329
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,100
But like, oh wait, how do I do this?

330
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,380
Barbecue master?

331
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,100
You haven't reached the target score.

332
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,620
Oh, start.

333
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:26,000
Customer visits the store every- oh my god, it's like those like cooking... like those- like those like cooking games.

334
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,260
All right, it can't be that difficult, right?

335
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm literally just putting stuff on.

336
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,780
All right.

337
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,780
Don't worry, I got you, S.

338
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,680
Oh, fuck.

339
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,640
I already fucked it up.

340
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,180
Um, oh, oh god.

341
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,720
It's out of order.

342
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,520
Is that okay?

343
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,660
Do they really care about the order?

344
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,300
Like, I- whoa, okay.

345
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,320
Stop!

346
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,240
Okay, I feel very pressured already.

347
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,660
Um, what?

348
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh my god, what?

349
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,260
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,620
I'm- okay.

351
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,100
Um, I- I- I give up.

352
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:07,940
I-

353
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't give me up!

354
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,640
No!

355
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,400
I don't want to- get me out of here!

356
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,320
Get me out of here!

357
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,260
Get me out of here!

358
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,320
Get me out of here!

359
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,120
Get me out of here!

360
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,720
Okay, okay.

361
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,100
Okay.

362
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,720
All right, let's-

363
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,020
I realized I was not meant to play that game.

364
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,800
I was- Anyway, let's gotcha!

365
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,860
Wait.

366
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,060
Oh, I get to know my- oh wait, I get to do one recruit a day.

367
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,280
All right, what did I get?

368
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,240
Oh, wouldn't it be cool if I got an SSR off the bat?

369
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,380
Costume gacha?

370
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,480
I don't even have enough...

371
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,620
women for costumes!

372
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,860
Like- Like, what do you mean costume g- I don't even have enough ladies!

373
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,160
Oh my god.

374
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,120
They're like mass-produced too, so it's like they're not a spe- I'm sorry, you're not special.

375
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,820
I'm- I'm so sorry.

376
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,620
You're- you're just...

377
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,320
You're just not special.

378
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,600
Like, what can I say?

379
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,260
You're just- okay, we gotta get Cinderella.

380
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,460
And then this is bonus recruit.

381
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,260
Wait, can I do...

382
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,600
once a day?

383
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,820
Wait, do I have enough?

384
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,120
I do!

385
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,660
Okay, wait.

386
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,980
All right, what are the- oh!

387
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,560
100% chance to get at least one.

388
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,560
Oh, wait, she's so cute!

389
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
Wait, I like this.

390
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,860
She's so cute!

391
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,580
And there's like social point.

392
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,240
Oh, is it because you need friends?

393
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,140
Guys, is this the one where you need friends?

394
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,120
I remember this!

395
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,200
You're like, you need friends to get this.

396
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,580
Okay, we're gonna get this one first.

397
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,540
Um, let's see.

398
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,420
How many do I have?

399
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,660
Yeah.

400
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,460
Okay, we're gonna do this first because this one has like...

401
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,380
Uh, wait, what's the probability?

402
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,600
Oh my god.

403
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,040
Okay, we can do this.

404
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:02,900
All right.

405
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,320
Spend free gems or consume- yes, we're gonna do the- we're gonna do the gems one first because it's 150.

406
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,780
What do you mean no?

407
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,660
What do you mean?

408
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,180
It's 150!

409
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,260
No, go for Cinderella.

410
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,200
Okay, fine.

411
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,620
All right.

412
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,980
All right.

413
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,880
What's the probability?

414
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,720
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

415
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,560
It's not that bad!

416
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,320
It's not that bad!

417
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,040
Look, look!

418
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,100
It's not that bad!

419
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,980
It's not that bad, guys.

420
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,200
Look, it says one per- wait, it's guaranteed!

421
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,920
Wait, it's guaranteed!

422
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,080
It's one percent!

423
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,180
Guys, I don't- wait.

424
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,940
Sorry, I forgot.

425
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,140
One percent is not guaranteed.

426
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,260
One percent is one percent!

427
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,480
Oh, oh!

428
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,120
Not that!

429
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Forgot that, like...

430
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,820
It's a gotcha.

431
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,200
Wait!

432
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,820
I got an SSR!

433
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,480
Okay, I got Mika.

434
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,580
Mika?

435
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,040
Uh, oh, she's definitely not.

436
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,500
She's like- she's like default.

437
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,300
Like, nobody cares about her.

438
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,880
Oh my god, no!

439
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,820
Why do I always get Aether?

440
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,720
Why is she always there?

441
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,400
No matter where I go, she's always there!

442
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,680
She carried my head shut up!

443
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,920
I'm Neon and firepower's on point!

444
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,320
Oh, that- she's so cute!

445
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,680
Wait, I like Neon.

446
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,460
I like her outfit.

447
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,080
Soldier EG at your service!

448
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,560
Okay, Aether is- Come on, who is it?

449
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,120
Who is it?

450
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,800
Who is it?

451
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,320
Is it Nirella?

452
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,300
Is it her?

453
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,860
NOOOOOOO!

454
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:42,860
Victory!

455
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,440
I'm beat!

456
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:46,980
I'm beat!

457
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:58,640
I mean, it's an SSR, but I like how people are like, oh, Klee.

458
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,300
Like, where's your gun?

459
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,000
Where does your- where does your gun go?

460
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,720
Where do you- oh my- Where does- where does your gun even go?

461
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,120
Like, I don't even know where you can put that!

462
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,740
All right, recruit again.

463
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,360
We got- maybe- maybe this time we'll get Cinderella.

464
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,660
Come on, I just want Cinderella!

465
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,980
This is literally the second- happy second year anniversary!

466
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,320
That's all I asked for!

467
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,700
What'd I get?

468
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,260
What'd I get?

469
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,560
Come on, pick two.

470
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,260
Leave it to me.

471
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:46,800
Three?

472
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,660
Wait, is that rare?

473
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,200
Is three rare?

474
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,520
Oh my god, look at the little cat ears.

475
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,080
Guys, you- guys, use my link, then you can be as lucky.

476
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,180
Whoa!

477
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,200
That's mean!

478
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,320
But like, not blind!

479
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,220
Guys, all I'm saying is that I used my link to create my account.

480
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,980
That's- I use- I use my link to create my account, guys.

481
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,700
So like, if you use my link to create your account, you might be able to get the same luck as me.

482
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,720
That's all I'm saying.

483
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,660
I got three?

484
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,600
That's- It's like 0.4%!

485
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,080
Pilgrim?

486
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,440
Who's that?

487
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,740
I did it!

488
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,410
Second pull.

489
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,870
It's just that easy, guys.

490
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,990
It's literally...

491
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,070
It's literally...

492
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,110
Second pull.

493
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,330
See, I told you, it's 100%.

494
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,170
I don't even need to do any more pulls.

495
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,110
I already got my girl.

496
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,450
The streamer luck is real.

497
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:14,790
Oh.

498
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,630
Guys, I told you, guys.

499
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,970
Did I get her again?

500
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,250
I got topless on Cinderella.

501
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,650
Oh my god, shit, I can upgrade her!

502
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,930
I can actually upgrade Cinderella too!

503
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,830
Holy shit, that's actually crazy.

504
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,810
I thought it was- Oh my god.

505
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,130
All I'm saying...

506
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,330
This is a new account.

507
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,130
I literally created the account, like, two hours ago, chat.

508
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,230
If you use- All I'm saying, you use the account.

509
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,670
Use the code.

510
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,730
And then, create that account.

511
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,010
Um, four and- Wait, do I need to do more pulls?

512
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,610
I feel like that already got everything I needed.

513
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,990
The salt.

514
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,530
The salt is real.

515
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,230
I mean, I told you, it's 100%.

516
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,150
I did more than 50 and got- Nothing.

517
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,590
I have- Technically, I could do three more pulls.

518
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,330
Get her two more times.

519
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,230
See?

520
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:30,930
Okay.

521
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:31,990
All right.

522
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,930
I mean, you know what?

523
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,570
I'll do- Should I do all of it?

524
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,910
Do I- Do I- Do I do it all?

525
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,810
Wait, how much- Wait, let's see.

526
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,570
Where's home?

527
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,750
Uh, lobby.

528
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,390
Wait, what's the costume gotcha?

529
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,830
Do I have enough?

530
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,010
Oh, it's free!

531
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,510
Wait.

532
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:53,770
Free?

533
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,610
Wait, what's grave?

534
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,370
Wait, it's not free?

535
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,280
Oh, oh, first roll.

536
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,180
Okay, I got the first roll.

537
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,500
What's this?

538
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,230
Oh, nice!

539
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,730
I got beginner maintenance kit.

540
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,190
Nice!

541
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,770
That's free.

542
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,110
Okay, nice.

543
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,530
Okay, now it's not free.

544
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,990
It's not free.

545
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,970
That's fine.

546
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,970
All right.

547
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,910
Wait, who's grave?

548
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,830
Is that another character?

549
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,650
Is that another, uh, Niki that's coming out?

550
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:41,790
Guys?

551
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,690
No, we're not gonna- We're not- Guys, we're not.

552
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,950
We're not gonna spend more- We're not gonna spend more, guys.

553
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,070
Grave comes next week.

554
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,330
Okay, we're gonna do more pulls then.

555
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,790
We're gonna- We're gonna do more pulls then.

556
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,710
Guys, I can't wait next week, guys.

557
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,230
I can't.

558
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,570
Let's go gambling!

559
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,630
Wait, ticket shop?

560
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,530
Which one's ticket shop?

561
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,450
Which one's the ticket shop?

562
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,490
I don't- Do I have it?

563
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,030
I have cat.

564
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,350
I don't think I- I have to clear the campaign, guys.

565
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,310
Is that- Is that the ticket shop?

566
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,010
Oh, it's in the costume gacha?

567
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,990
Wait, is it these?

568
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,570
Okay, just click that.

569
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,030
Butcher used by commanders to recruit specific Nikis.

570
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,030
Wait, is this like I can get top, middle?

571
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,150
Oh!

572
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:38,850
Oh!

573
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,050
Oh, free!

574
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,430
Yeah, I like free stuff.

575
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,730
Let's go.

576
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,210
The cup is filled.

577
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,050
Expense- Exclusive currency for when the event ends.

578
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:50,750
Unusable.

579
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,550
Wait, I love free stuff.

580
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,370
All right, nice.

581
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,170
Now, what do I do?

582
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,430
Oh, can I use this?

583
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,830
I can roll again!

584
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,430
Oh!

585
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,760
I- I assume the- the magenta is the...

586
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,290
Is the, uh...

587
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:08,750
No!

588
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,850
This is a scam!

589
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,990
No, I'm joking.

590
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,810
No, it's not.

591
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,590
No, it's not.

592
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,970
No, it's- Wait, I got another one.

593
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,300
It's okay.

594
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,360
Come on, come on.

595
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,020
Are you serious?

596
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,680
You're controlling the wheel!

597
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,280
You have to be controlling the wheel.

598
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,500
There's no way!

599
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,000
No, there's no way she has to be controlling the wheel.

600
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,600
It's like the house always wins.

601
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,480
It's like...

602
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,680
The house- The house always wins.

603
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,860
I feel like I'm at a casino again.

604
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,200
All right.

605
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,020
Okay, that's fine.

606
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,600
It's just her.

607
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,460
My gacha luck, though, is insane.

608
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,880
All right.

609
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,060
You know what?

610
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,380
Let's use it up.

611
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,900
Let's do it.

612
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,320
All right, at least the gachas...

613
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,040
At least- At least the gachas fair to me.

614
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,560
At least, like...

615
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,920
At least- At least they're kind to me.

616
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,860
Oh, shit!

617
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,700
Another one?

618
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,680
Let's go!

619
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,420
Hey!

620
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,720
Gacha is so easy.

621
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,840
Like, these are my free pulls, too.

622
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:21,380
These are- These are my- These are my free- All I'm saying is that I didn't spend any money.

623
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,120
I got paid.

624
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,380
Oh, I got three in a row?

625
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,400
Three, three.

626
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,600
One percent my ass.

627
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,580
Wait, what did I get?

628
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,300
What?

629
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,340
What did I get?

630
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,600
Who's her?

631
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:42,900
Oh!

632
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,500
Isn't she the one that died?

633
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,240
Wait, she looks just like her.

634
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,020
Diesel, yeah!

635
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,280
That's her!

636
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
I remember Diesel!

637
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,420
Oh my god, I remember her!

638
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,360
Oh, she's different.

639
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,160
Oh my god.

640
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,860
No, fuck off, Aether!

641
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,200
Fuck off!

642
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,300
Get out of here!

643
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,400
I don't want you in my fucking- I don't- I don't want you here.

644
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:21,940
Like, I always- No matter- No matter who I am, you'll always be there, Aether, every single time.

645
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,300
You were there in the first stream, you were there in the second stream, and you're still here today.

646
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,380
She has- I can't- You know what?

647
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,620
Fuck it, let's do it all.

648
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,140
Let's see how far I can get.

649
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,060
Let's use the- Nobody likes her.

650
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,440
Oh, she's not a Maria?

651
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,700
She looks just like her.

652
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,380
I thought it was her.

653
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,680
I was like, wait, I thought you're dead.

654
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:46,680
Oh.

655
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,040
Oh, okay, not- You know what?

656
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,360
All I'm saying, three in a row was pretty good.

657
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,940
Three in a row was like- Oh god, Neon.

658
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,420
Okay, now I'm gonna hate you too.

659
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,800
Oh my- Whoa.

660
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,800
Whoa.

661
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,800
Where- Oh my god, look how bigger guns are.

662
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,280
Oh my god.

663
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,300
That's a- That gun is huge right here.

664
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,920
You see that?

665
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,700
It's like all the way down here.

666
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,360
Like, all the way down here.

667
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,660
I hate being here.

668
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,260
Oh my- Every pull.

669
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,820
Every pull is here.

670
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,940
It's- Every single pull is here.

671
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,100
Every- She's everywhere.

672
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,840
Whoa, okay.

673
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:34,840
All right.

674
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:35,980
All right.

675
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,100
How many do I have left?

676
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,600
Last one.

677
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,720
Last one, guys.

678
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,100
Last one.

679
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,240
What do I get?

680
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,340
I swear, if I get Aether one last time, I'm gonna- I swear to god.

681
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,740
Oh, I swear to god.

682
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,200
If I get Aether one more time, I swear to god.

683
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,740
Oh, another SSR?

684
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,160
Four out of five.

685
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,940
Four out of five.

686
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,080
No, don't.

687
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,380
No, don't.

688
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,560
Who'd I get?

689
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,980
Who is it?

690
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:14,880
Is it new?

691
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,720
New girl?

692
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,100
That's the girl I wanted!

693
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,380
She's so cute!

694
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh my god, I like her.

695
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,400
Oh my god, she has like a cap.

696
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,140
Oh, and she has green eyes like me!

697
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,480
Oh my god!

698
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,860
She's so cute!

699
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,280
Novel.

700
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,760
Oh my god, she has- I love her hairstyle.

701
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,440
She's so cute.

702
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,880
She's my favorite.

703
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,720
She's actually my favorite out of all the designs.

704
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,940
Oh my god, okay, all you guys don't care.

705
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,420
You don't matter at that point.

706
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,940
I already got all the girls I need.

707
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,320
The rest of you, you don't matter in my life anymore.

708
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,360
Oh, Delta.

709
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,920
Wow, that was so easy.

710
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,960
Guys, who gotcha so easy?

711
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:15,560
Like- Oh my god, oh my god, look at my stack team already!

712
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,400
All SSR in just...

713
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,100
five rolls!

714
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,100
Like, all SSR.

715
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,760
All three backtrackers.

716
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,900
Guys, you know what?

717
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,860

720
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,260
No, I need people to know that I got Cinderella.

721
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,700

722
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,480
Oh, I should upgrade them.

Her other costume is so pretty!

735
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,960
Amongst this lambent glass, I too gleam with brilliance.

736
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,600
How do I obtain it?

737
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,600

00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,620

I'll just make you kill everything.

790
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,180

Old Tales.

859
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,650
We were supposed to do Old Tales.

860
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,510
Fuck, okay.

861
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:57,250
All right, I- we do one game because I want to do like what it's like with the normal girls.

How strong they are.

863
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,030
I want to know how strong my girls are.

865
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,750
All right, we go in with Cinderella.

866
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,730
What about the PV?

867
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,250
We'll watch the PV at the end.

868
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,490
Wait, these aren't my girls.

869
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,150
These aren't my girls.

870
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,650
What are they doing here?

871
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,330
Put Cinderella back in here.

872
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,590
Which- what are they doing here?

873
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,830

875
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,650
I know this is a chapter, but still.

876
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,650
Bring back my girls.

877
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,250
Bring them back.

00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:41,950
Sure.

880
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,790
What was that all about?

881
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,950
I just came up with something.

882
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,890
If the current running through the tracks is the problem...

883
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,170
I love that they can read for me.

884
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:55,590
True!

885
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,050
So true.

886
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,770
Oh my god, you're so right.

887
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:05,830
You're so- Oh my god, you're so smart.

888
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,070
Be

889
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,340
burnt to a crisp if they touched it.

890
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,080
How about the auto feature?

891
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,760
Didn't you have more to say?

892
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,930
Commander.

893
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:34,830
Well...

894
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:36,810
Yes.

895
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,070
Yep, let's do it.

896
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,480
All right, let's go.

897
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,980
All right, Cinderella, show me what you can- I like how someone was like, why is like everyone's level one?

898
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:53,940
And then there's Cinderella.

All right, where is she?

900
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,540
Oh, there she is.

901
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,660
They just don't exist.

902
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,880
Whoa, it's so easy.

903
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,440
Where did he go?

904
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,940
Oh my god, I don't know what to say.

905
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,660
Cinderella, I told you.

906
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,800
She's like my girl.

907
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,780
She's literally my girl.

908
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,000
All right, okay, now we do the second year anniversary event.

909
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:38,760
Now, guys, I just want to know how strong she was, but now, now that- Oh, thank you.

910
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:39,500
Whoa.

911
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,740
Wait, I just saw the orange eyes.

912
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,520
She really loves god, guys.

913
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,240
Guys, she's really loves god.

914
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:03,640
That's what- Okay, this is- This should be the- This should be the special event for the second year anniversary, I believe.

915
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,060
All right.

916
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:07,980
Cinderella!

917
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,520
A sea of red eyes enough to blot out the sky.

918
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,080
A collapsing city.

919
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:15,920
People dying.

920
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:26,620
Also, apparently, like- Look, I like joke around about Nikkei stuff, but like apparently the story and the lore of goddess of victory is like actually really sad.

921
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,600
Like- Which is- Yeah.

922
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,360
The death of dignity.

923
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, no, Cinderella.

924
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,520
You okay?

925
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:36,880
It goes hard.

926
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,800
Which is why like this game has been like incredibly popular, uh, throughout the two years.

927
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,170
I love the character designs of this game and like...

928
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,100
the overall gameplay.

929
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,020
No, Cinderella!

930
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,260
Do you need more upgrades?

931
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,080
Would more upgrades make you happier?

932
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,560
Wait, that's me!

933
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,420
I just look so cool.

934
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,460
That's me!

935
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,680
Guys, I'm a really good voice actor.

936
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,420
Yeah, my voice can go that low.

937
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,280
That's not me!

938
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,040
There's more than one!

939
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:49,920
Who is he?

940
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,820
There's more than one commander!

941
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,440
Who is this guy?

942
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,160
Showmanship...

943
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,900
Would you like to sing a song with me, Dorothy?

944
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,020
I don't think that'll be necessary.

945
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,360
I said showmanship.

946
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,160
Oh, this is a hundred years ago?

947
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,000
Heading into battle.

948
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:18,880
Oh, yeah.

949
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,900
No, he's definitely dead.

950
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,120
No, he's definitely dead.

951
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,560
That's cheating!

952
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,940
Yeah, Red Hood, your magazine is loaded backwards.

953
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,560
How dare you reload?

954
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,780
What's the big deal?

955
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,080
Then it'll just eject backwards.

956
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,180
Oh, that's Snow White!

957
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:44,620
Showmanship...

958
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,160
There's no way two minutes is enough to show me.

959
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,060
I like how this is all like, um, fairy tale themed.

960
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,980
Crawling doesn't suit me.

961
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,520
I'd rather jump out of the way.

962
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,580
That works, too.

963
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,380
Snow White, nothing's coming out of the staff.

964
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,460
That's because you're holding it upside down.

965
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,160
Oh, whoops.

966
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,860
Is this how I'm supposed to hold it?

967
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,800
Hey, don't point it at me!

968
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,900
As long as you don't sin, you'll be fine.

969
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,980
That doesn't mean pointing it at me instead.

970
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:16,980
Whoa!

971
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,840
Everyone, we need to get serious about this.

972
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,500
Who's he?

973
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,540
That's not me.

974
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,440
That was a disaster.

975
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,760
It's not fair.

976
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,060
Why does he look like that?

977
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,380
Even though they were far from a well-oiled machine.

978
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,780
Why does he look better than V?

979
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,720
How am I gonna live up to that, guys?

980
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,420
He's so... I'm here, too!

981
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,480
Guys, you can't say that in front of me.

982
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,300
I'm the new commander, guys.

983
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,100
You can't just say that in front of me.

984
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,280
He's not as cool as you, Doki.

985
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,320
He's not as cool as you.

986
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,300
PRS.

987
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,600
We...

988
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,600
We are the goddess of victory.

989
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,540
Humanity's saviors.

990
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,100
That's right.

991
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,680
Me and my beautiful anime girl robots are gonna save the world.

992
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Not him, though.

993
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,640
Get this guy out of here.

994
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,400
There can only be one commander.

995
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:21,600
Come here.

996
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,840
They set the thing.

997
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,140
No, I promise I won't do anything to you.

998
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,400
They don't try.

999
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,700
They all sat down.

1000
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,680
Their exhaustion palpable and visible.

1001
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,640
Their bodies were caked in dust and debris.

1002
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,240
Really?

1003
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:35,900
They're...

1004
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,940
They seem pretty clean right now.

1005
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,140
They were the most beautiful thing in the entire world.

1006
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,420
I love how Dorothy is just getting...

1007
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,260
like...

1008
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,400
You don't even... You don't even see her!

1009
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,900
Did I fall asleep?

1010
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,860
Yeah, you're out like a light.

1011
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,940
I was dreaming about the time when I first met the goddess squad.

1012
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,680
Is there ever a day when you don't dream about that?

1013
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:07,300
I told you to wait until the test results came out, and here you are sawing logs.

1014
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,260
And the results?

1015
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,260
As always, you're all clear.

1016
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,400
Why do you care?

1017
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,240
It's not like we've ever been placed in actual combat before anyway.

1018
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,440
All we do is waste time and money.

1019
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,980
When can we go out?

1020
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:25,700
Beats me.

1021
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,040
All right, get going.

1022
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,940
The others have to be tested as well.

1023
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,400
Wait, what are we being tested for?

1024
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,280
Whoa, who's she?

1025
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,480
Whoa!

1026
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,360
Why are they...

1027
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,380
I don't even... Are they twins?

1028
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,260
So you're being deployed?

1029
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,560
No, not yet.

1030
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,080
They're almost identical twins.

1031
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,140
Yeah.

1032
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,260
They're almost identical twins.

1033
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,800
One got... One clearly got more of the protein in the womb.

1034
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,100
I get it.

1035
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:11,980
You're bored.

1036
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,280
Hang tight.

1037
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,280
Good news is coming our way soon.

1038
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,900
We think you're lying.

1039
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,360
Wait, they're British?

1040
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:28,340
I like how... I like to imagine that because they're like robots, right?

1041
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,860
Because they're not real.

1042
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,180
You're like, they're real to me, but they're not real.

1043
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:38,100
So like one of them, one of the scientists was like, I want a... I want British twins.

1044
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,880
One of the creators was just like, I want them to be British.

1045
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,260
So quit standing around and wasting it.

1046
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,360
Get in here.

1047
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,380
We're coming.

1048
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,560
Wait, they used to be human.

1049
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,920
Going to...

1050
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,340
But they don't feel anything.

1051
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,260
Oh, they're real?

1052
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,860
It's not like I'm champing at the bit to tussle with raptures, but all this endless...

1053
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,540
Oh, so the brains kept the British.

1054
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,600
It's exhausting.

1055
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,900
We just have to wait a little longer.

1056
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,240
The time will come soon...

1057
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,760
When we can prove ourselves.

1058
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,680
Oh, so like the brains just kept the British.

1059
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:23,660
What are you doing?

1060
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,040
HAHAHAHA The British is stored in the brain.

1061
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,740
Either one.

1062
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,900
Oh my god, so fucking...

1063
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,500
You're on high school host club shit.

1064
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,480
No, they actually did the fucking...

1065
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,320
How can you not know?

1066
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,820
How can you not...

1067
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,480
How can you not tell which one's Hansel and which one's...

1068
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,280
They're not even...

1069
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,800
They don't even have the same proportions.

1070
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,540
How can you not tell?

1071
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,040
How can you not tell?

1072
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,260
How can you not tell?

1073
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,500
How does he not know?

1074
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,160
There's a very...

1075
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,680
No, they even dress differently.

1076
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,120
Alright.

1077
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,340
I'm ready to go in.

1078
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,440
Oh, we're in.

1079
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,180
Something is not adding up.

1080
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,820
I'm just like, how can you...

1081
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,560
Oh, there's so many...

1082
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,040
Oh, it's like it's own area.

1083
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,940
The login stamp.

1084
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,820
This is more bonus?

1085
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,180
More bonus?

1086
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,560
Oh, more bonus items!

1087
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,340
See, guys?

1088
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,660
Look at all these bonus items.

1089
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,580
If you use my...

1090
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,740
All I'm saying, if you use my code, you can get more bonus items.

1091
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,460
Thank you again for DK for the sponsor.

1092
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,940
I guess I go to the mirror.

1093
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:23,640
Right?

1094
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,040
Can I not just go to the mirror like that?

1095
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,940
Oh, please.

1096
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,580
You're gonna make me get angry.

1097
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,640
You're gonna make me angry.

1098
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,460
Alright.

1099
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,500
Enter.

1100
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:47,460
Oh!

1101
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,880
Her artwork's so pretty!

1102
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,220
Like, the artwork is actually so pretty, though.

1103
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,010
Can I just auto?

1104
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,270
Nice.

1105
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:08,310
Wait, are these my strongest?

1106
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,140
I assume they are.

1107
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,180
Alright, here we go.

1108
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,420
What do you mean where my mouse pointing at?

1109
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,560
It's always been the same.

1110
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,260
What is it?

1111
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,200
What is it?

1112
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,800
Are we going to be deployed in actual combat?

1113
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,640
That's the whole point.

1114
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,360
That was what the train is for.

1115
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,080
And they're not liable to let that go to waste.

1116
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:38,620
When?

1117
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,380
I don't know.

1118
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,360
Wait.

1119
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,880
At this rate, the war will be over by the time we're given the go-ahead.

1120
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,580
Of course, when I say that, I mean that we'll lose.

1121
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,240
Woah, Hansel!

1122
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,840
Oh my gosh, she's so cocky.

1123
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,460
Are they not here to science us?

1124
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,020
They spent millions of dollars on your bodies!

1125
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,060
Like, if you die instantly, it'll be a waste of the taxpayer's money!

1126
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,420
That's the whole point!

1127
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,960
Are you more of a Hansel or a Cora?

1128
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,720
In what ways?

1129
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,520
You're making me upset again.

1130
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,000
Don't mind her.

1131
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:58,220
Anyway, it's a bit embarrassing for me to be the one saying this.

1132
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,940
But our specs exceed that of the original Grimm's prototypes.

1133
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,160
Woah!

1134
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,800
Yeah, exceeds alright.

1135
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,880
Second generation Grimm's models, to be exact.

1136
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:14,620
The sooner you're deployed, the greater our chances of...

1137
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,980
How many times do I have to tell you?

1138
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,460
We haven't received any orders.

1139
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,940
Yeah, like, where will we even deploy you, Red Shoes?

1140
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,020
Who would be scrapping us?

1141
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:29,480
What?

1142
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,620
If anyone is thinking of scrapping me or Gretel...

1143
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,420
I'd like to see them try.

1144
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,340
You haven't even got into real combat!

1145
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:42,780
Woah!

1146
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,960
Abe!

1147
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,280
Damn, Abe!

1148
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,320
Damn, what a roast.

1149
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,440
Yeah, tell her, Abe.

1150
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,180
Every time I get the same answer.

1151
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,700
They haven't reached a decision yet.

1152
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,420
What hasn't been decided?

1153
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,740
We either go out or we don't.

1154
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,700
What's so complicated about that?

1155
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:27,300
If it were that easy, we wouldn't be waiting for as long as we have.

1156
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:35,160
You all are the culmination of the finest technology the United Forces of Humanity and VTC has to offer.

1157
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,060
Your power is supposed to surpass that of the Goddess Squad themselves.

1158
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,100
We can't possibly surpass them.

1159
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,240
No way.

1160
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,680
I mean, if they put more money into you, I can see that.

1161
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,300
Like, they're only as strong as the technology inside them.

1162
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:57,040
If you were made out of the latest technology, then yeah, of course you're gonna exceed.

1163
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,840
Yeah, I'll put the volume a little bit more...

1164
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:02,780
VTC.

1165
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,560
Updated just now.

1166
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,480
There's a whole convoluted web of who contributed what technology, who footed the bill for what, etc.

1167
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,800
We're not able to saddle up and ride out like a bunch of cowboys.

1168
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:15,620
Yeah!

1169
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,960
Ugh, this is torture!

1170
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,820
Do you think this is fun for me?

1171
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,180
Like, is killing other things entertainment?

1172
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,680
There's other things you can do...

1173
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,760
If you're bored.

1174
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,940
In order to become a Nikkei girl, you have to endure the experience of a 66% mortality rate.

1175
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,680
But let's focus on...

1176
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,740
Daddy, thank you for the super chat!

1177
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,360
Thank you!

1178
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,540
Hey, that's a higher gotcha rate than Cinderella.

1179
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,340
I'll take my chances.

1180
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:51,660
That's...

1181
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,240
That's a very good gotcha rate, not gonna lie.

1182
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,200
Wait, who's her?

1183
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,260
Who's the little mermaid?

1184
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,600
Where did she come from?

1185
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,020
Where did the little mermaid come from?

1186
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,140
I've never seen her before.

1187
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,140
She's just been there.

1188
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,040
I guess Hansel and Gretel were just more important.

1189
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,260
Oh, is that all she says?

1190
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,480
Oh, she's always been there.

1191
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,360
That's like her only line.

1192
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,840
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

1193
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,300
Easiest game of my life.

1194
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,800
So easy.

1195
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,760
Oh my god, she's so strong.

1196
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:14,640
Oh my god, look at the damage on this.

1197
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,660
Everybody else can just die.

1198
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,980
Alright, nice.

1199
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:22,400
Target?

1200
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:23,420
Oh, it's him.

1201
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:24,840
Alright, don't worry!

1202
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,540
I don't know what else to say!

1203
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,180
You do your thing!

1204
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:36,860
Nice.

1205
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:37,520
Easy.

1206
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,440
So easy.

1207
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,340
I don't get bonus?

1208
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:53,020
How else would you respond?

1209
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,620
You would have responded the same way!

1210
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,640
How else could you respond to that?

1211
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:12,390
It shows the goddess squad fighting with raptures.

1212
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:15,730
Woah.

1213
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,110
Those are Oshis!

1214
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,630
Abe just doesn't get it.

1215
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,690
She has no Oshis.

1216
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:40,410
All she does is work.

1217
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,310
She's a workaholic.

1218
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,370
She doesn't know what it's like to work.

1219
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,250
She doesn't know what it's like to have an Oshi.

1220
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:44,490
How sad.

1221
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,090
Woah!

1222
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,030
She doesn't mean that, guys.

1223
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:54,950
You can keep watching me.

1224
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:59,890
She's ignoring me.

1225
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,290
She doesn't understand us.

1226
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,140
Wait, she's a Nikkei?

1227
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:32,430
Hey, I don't like sleeping.

1228
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,550
I'm gonna be a Nikkei.

1229
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,910
Oh, but it's a 66% mortality rate.

1230
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:36,670
No, that's fine.

1231
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:37,210
That's fine.

1232
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:43,190
True.

1233
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,630
Sounds like me.

1234
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:46,030
You know what?

1235
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:46,910
Sleep is for the weak.

1236
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:49,350
Let's go become a Nikkei.

1237
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,970
Either I don't sleep or I sleep forever.

1238
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:26,030
I think it's also because she has no memories, so she has nothing else to hold on to.

1239
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:37,690
Yay!

1240
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,990
We can go get killed now!

1241
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:45,750
Oh my god, she can talk?

1242
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,990
You fucking liars!

1243
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:49,730
Don't talk.

1244
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,250
Wait, what?

1245
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:57,950
Wait, why isn't she allowed to talk?

1246
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:01,790
Wait, was she just acting?

1247
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,810
Oh, they're not allowed to talk?

1248
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,430
Wait, why aren't they allowed to talk?

1249
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:15,430
I was like, wait, you mean she was acting this entire time?

1250
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,350
Oh, talking is her weapon!

1251
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:23,190
Oh, I thought it was just her name.

1252
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:25,890
Oh, it's like she mind controls.

1253
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:26,610
Oh!

1254
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:30,110
Oh, that makes so much more sense.

1255
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:31,650
I thought it was just...

1256
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,970
I thought you guys were just saying that as her nickname, as in her actual name.

1257
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:41,250
I was like, oh, that's a funky name, but okay.

1258
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:44,750
Oh, I see.

1259
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,050
I was like, oh, she was acting this entire time?

1260
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:03,870
Only one?

1261
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,310
Okay.

1262
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,010
I mean, to be fair, she's level 40.

1263
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,650
To be fair, I put everything on her.

1264
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:22,050
Like, it makes... I mean, she literally has everything on her.

1265
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,830
I mean, it makes sense, guys.

1266
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:32,270
I did put all my resources on her.

1267
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:34,470
No fair!

1268
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,710
She's literally the main character.

1269
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,790
Who else would get the thing?

1270
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,990
She's literally the main fucking character.

1271
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:46,850
Of course, she's gonna get everything.

1272
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:50,390
Oh my god.

1273
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:55,590
But yeah, I think I decide... I'm not gonna do the second chapter...

1274
01:07:55,590 --> 01:08:00,790
Because that's what you guys are gonna have to do yourself if you wanna find out more about the story.

1275
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,010
This... Oh, it's actually been...

1276
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:11,430
It's been amazing to be able to be sponsored by Goddess of Victory Nikkei again.

1277
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:16,510
And if I would, I would play... I definitely wanna play this more off stream.

1278
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:20,410
But huge shoutout to Nikkei for sponsoring it.

1279
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:27,090
And if you guys wanna check out the game yourself, I do have the link in the description and pinned in the comment...

1280
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:29,910
Pinned in the chat box.

1281
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:32,170
So if you use it, you get 200 free rolls.

1282
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:36,870
And I mean, like, literally I created this account, because I don't have my old account anymore.

1283
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:42,310
I literally created this account 2 hours before the stream started.

1284
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,850
And I got Cinderella in the second poll.

1285
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,510
I got like 4 out of 5...

1286
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:54,910
I mean, I got 3 golden rolls, like 3 SSRs in one roll.

1287
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,330
That's actually crazy.

1288
01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:03,710
I kept up all my gacha luck for that one roll.

1289
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:11,050
So yeah, if you guys didn't know, here are all the free stuff you're gonna get for the second year anniversary.

1290
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,910
And so, there's a lot.

1291
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,470
I mean, I literally got Rapunzel from the second year anniversary.

1292
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:23,690
But yeah, you can play on the Google Play Store, you can play on your Windows, you can play on the App Store.

1293
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:26,690
So yeah, please check out Nikkei.

1294
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:28,290
Now let me see if the thing downloaded.

1295
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:33,730
Alright, let's see if I can get the video running.

1296
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,170
Let's see, does it work?

1297
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:36,970
Does this video work?

1298
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,130
Alright, give me a sec guys.

1299
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:39,010
Oh, yes!

1300
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:42,930
Alright guys, before we end it, let's watch the video.

1301
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:47,110
I have no idea what this video... what it is.

1302
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,430
Alright.

1303
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:07,650
Oh, it's the red one!

1304
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,750
Oh, the animation is so pretty!

1305
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,130
Oh my god!

1306
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,410
I love the music.

1307
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:49,170
The music is so good.

1308
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,730
Oh, it's Cinderella!

1309
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:52,810
How?

1310
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:54,290
You're level 40!

1311
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:00,970
I put everything into you, Cinderella!

1312
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,440
Yeah, Nikkei has such great music.

1313
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:12,500
I

1314
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,280
only learned how to raise your voice, did you?

1315
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,420
I don't think guns work at this point.

1316
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,520
Like, would guns work against other goddesses?

1317
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,930
Gods can bleed.

1318
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:05,690
True.

1319
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,270
Party's over.

1320
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:27,310
Oh my god.

1321
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:29,790
That was a sick animated PV.

1322
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,370
The animation was so good.

1323
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:36,050
Oh yeah!

1324
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:36,810
Wow!

1325
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:37,670
Thank you again!

1326
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:40,750
Thank you again, Nikkei, for sponsoring me.

1327
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:48,850
It actually was great to be able to go back, you know, come back to Nikkei.

1328
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:50,970
I feel like it's more like a yearly event now.

1329
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:56,530
If I'm back... I hope I get to be back for the third year anniversary, that's for sure.

1330
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:03,750
Unfortunately, we weren't able to... Wait, can you pull volume?

1331
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,490
Is there a chance?

1332
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:07,410
To pull volume?

1333
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,790
Like, serious question here.

1334
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:15,230
Like, if I do this... If I do this...

1335
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,490
Oh, I don't have... Nevermind, I don't.

1336
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:20,570
I don't have enough.

1337
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:25,650
I was gonna say, like... Wait, can I pull volume here?

1338
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:27,110
Technically?

1339
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:28,590
Yeah?

1340
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:29,410
Okay, wait.

1341
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:30,850
How do I... Okay.

1342
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,550
Bonus recruit?

1343
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:34,510
Wait, what does this mean?

1344
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:37,430
Details...

1345
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:39,170
Use a hundred to... Oh!

1346
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,490
I can set up a wishlist?

1347
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:43,870
Where do I set it up?

1348
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,250
Wait, where's the wishlist?

1349
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,430
I don't remember how to do it.

1350
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:51,530
I wanna...

1351
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:53,250
No!

1352
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:58,090
I had to do 40!

1353
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,890
I'll just do this.

1354
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:12,210
I did it.

1355
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:16,910
It's okay, I'll do one free pull.

1356
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:18,370
Maybe I'll be lucky.

1357
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:22,470
Maybe... Maybe... I don't know at all.

1358
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:23,230
It's her.

1359
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,990
No, I just... I just wouldn't.

1360
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:28,770
I wouldn't.

1361
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,190
I wouldn't.

1362
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:31,830
I miss her.

1363
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,750
I miss her so much.

1364
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:39,290
She was what got... She was what started our Nikkei career.

1365
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:45,330
She started our Nikkei career.

1366
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:47,910
No!

1367
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,830
I got Ape!

1368
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:54,190
Wait, I can check her out?

1369
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,150
How?

1370
01:14:59,070 --> 01:14:59,670
Wait.

1371
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:00,790
Oh my god!

1372
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:03,770
Oh my god, where is she?

1373
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,690
Where is she?

1374
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,810
I miss her.

1375
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:12,370
I miss her so much.

1376
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:14,410
Oh wait, she's so cute!

1377
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:15,010
Wait, who's her?

1378
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:17,490
Oh, she's so cute!

1379
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:18,910
Oh my god, I love her outfit.

1380
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,950
Wait, she's me!

1381
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:24,010
Wait!

1382
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,760
That's literally me!

1383
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,120
That's okay.

1384
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,440
Wait a minute.

1385
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,180
Wait, Quincy?

1386
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:40,860
Who's Quincy?

1387
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,440
Oh, no, that's Quarry.

1388
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,180
Quincy.

1389
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,720
I want volume, but volume's my girl.

1390
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,960
I think it's more... Oh, this one.

1391
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:54,900
She's famous.

1392
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,180
She's definitely famous.

1393
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,580
Where is she?

1394
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,640
Oh my god, noise!

1395
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,860
I missed you.

1396
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,400
Oh my god, she's my favorite.

1397
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,260
I don't know if you guys know that.

1398
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,400
I love Nikkei.

1399
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,740
She's my favorite.

1400
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,400
She started my Nikkei career.

1401
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:33,720
She started my Nikkei career, guys.

1402
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,060
I owe it to her.

1403
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,240
I owe everything to her.

1404
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,080
Anyway,

1405
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:58,240
guys.

1406
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:07,400
Thank you all for coming to my Goddess of Victory Nikkei stream.

1407
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:11,640
I really appreciate Nikkei for...

1408
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,880
What do you think you wish?

1409
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,860
This is my SSR.

1410
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,780
This is my SSR.

1411
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:27,080
It was great revisiting back to Nikkei again.

1412
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:30,840
Thank you again to Nikkei for sponsoring me.

1413
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,580
I hope you guys enjoyed.

1414
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,560
It's like evolution, guys.

1415
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,480
I basically just evolved chat.

1416
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,880
Thank you everybody for coming.

1417
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:47,380
Check out Cinderella and Propunza are both available now and Grave will be available next week.

1418
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:53,300
Use the link in my description or pin in the comment if you guys want to do some polls.

1419
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,880
You get 200 free polls if you click on that link and create an account.

1420
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:01,140
You already saw that I was very lucky with those polls because I used the exact same link.

1421
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,340
Anyway, guys.

1422
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,360
As always, everybody.

1423
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,300
Stay hydrated.

1424
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,000
Posture check.

1425
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,560
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1426
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,840
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

1427
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,120
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1428
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,220
Bye, guys.

1429
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:20,540
I think Nikkei in general has a really good story and also music.

1430
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:24,000
The story and music in Nikkei is really good and the character design as well.

1431
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:24,680
