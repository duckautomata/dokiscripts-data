00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,110
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,110
Hello, hello, hello!

3
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,610
Oh gosh, okay.

4
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,410
So, welcome, welcome class.

5
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:10,150
Welcome class to VTubing 101 by Professor Doki.

6
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:18,030
I just need to let you guys know that I need, before I start, a big disclaimer for all of you.

7
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,170
But this is all my own opinion.

8
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,550
So like, obviously, to each person, it is different how this is done.

9
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,270
I am a very unique circumstance in terms of like, what the fuck happened to me.

10
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,730
So...

11
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,590
So, I just need you guys to know...

12
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:46,310
This is like, all my own opinion in terms of like, content creation and like, VTubing and stuff like that.

13
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,010
Like, all the tips and advice is...

14
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,430
From what I feel is how to build an audience and how to nurture a fan community.

15
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,170
I realized, I just remembered, I forgot that slide.

16
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,790
I forgot to make that slide.

17
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,910
Regarding like, how to nurture a fan community.

18
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,470
I forgot to make it.

19
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:05,890
So...

20
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,470
So, I'll talk to you guys about that later.

21
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,990
I was like, I knew I forgot something.

22
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,990
I knew I forgot one thing to talk about regarding like, VTubing 101.

23
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,850
Most important things is like...

24
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,290
How to create a fan community.

25
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,930
Like a community...

26
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,150
A community that is like, you know...

27
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,350
How to nurture it and how to like, grow it in a way.

28
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,950
And making sure they like, you know...

29
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,070
They'll continue to watch you.

30
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,890
So, stuff like that.

31
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,790
I realized, I knew I forgot to make one important slide.

32
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,650
And that was one of them.

33
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,590
So, I will talk about it.

34
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,170
I will sadly...

35
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,210
There won't be a slide about it.

36
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,170
So, I guess like, if you're looking back.

37
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,030
You're just gonna have to remember where I talked about it and stuff like that.

38
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,890
So, like I said.

39
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,670
This is all my own opinion.

40
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,870
In regards to like, all of this.

41
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,890
It will touch on about like, content creation as well.

42
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,510
Not just like, VTubing in general.

43
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,050
Because like, although VTubing is a niche type deal.

44
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,190
It's like, it's own niche within the streaming community.

45
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,890
A lot of these like, things I talk about can also apply to general streaming.

46
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,230
Like, it doesn't have to...

47
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,310
You don't have to be a VTuber.

48
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,190
You could just be like, a Fleshtuber.

49
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,210
Or like, just a PNGTuber.

50
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,090
Or whatever.

51
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,970
It all like, it's just...

52
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,390
Just general advice on like, algorithm and stuff like that.

53
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,290
A lot of this is like, very like...

54
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,650
It's like, very...

55
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,430
What's the word?

56
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,250
It's very...

57
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,230
It might be like, very simple advice.

58
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,150
And it could be like, things like, oh, I knew that already.

59
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,090
Or stuff like that.

60
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,430
But some people might not.

61
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,150
You know, some people might not know this already.

62
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,070
This info.

63
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,390
And stuff like that.

64
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,110
Or like, they might not be aware that like, oh wait, that's the thing.

65
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,050
And stuff like that.

66
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,790
So, there's gonna be some advice that, to others, might seem very simple.

67
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,890
But might help...

68
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,750
It might help others.

69
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,290
And then there might be some advice that you might not know also.

70
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,170
So, I'll try to touch as much as I can.

71
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,330
There will be like...

72
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,170
I will take questions.

73
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,670
But of course, I will pick and choose what questions I would like to answer.

74
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,210
At the end.

75
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,790
And from chat.

76
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,490
And then I will take some questions.

77
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,790
I will also be reading through the Twitter thread that I made regarding like, people on Twitter.

78
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,350
That have asked me like, questions regarding...

79
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,030
Regarding like, what they want to know more about.

80
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,530
Like, what my process is.

81
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,410
And stuff like that.

82
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,090
So, I will be looking at Twitter as well as chat later on.

83
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,370
To answer some of the questions people have.

84
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,250
Because like, there's some where people were asking me, how do you do a project?

85
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,290
How do you start a project?

86
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:43,910
What do you do?

87
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,310
Well, like...

88
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,170
This is like...

89
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,650
I didn't make a slide for stuff like this.

90
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,670
Because like...

91
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:53,390
When doing projects, it's not really that complicated of a process in general.

92
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,450
Unless you get sponsors involved.

93
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,230
Like...

94
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,830
The moment you get sponsors involved.

95
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,510
Or like, you have someone else that's funding it for you.

96
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,470
It doesn't...

97
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,410
It's not that complicated.

98
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,850
It's as complicated as you want to make it to be.

99
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,710
So, I didn't make a slide about that.

100
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,090
Because I felt like...

101
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,070
It really is like, your own work process regarding projects.

102
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,890
And stuff like that.

103
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,770
So like, of course, if you have a sponsor involved.

104
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,870
If you have someone else involved.

105
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,310
Obviously, what they want to do with your project matters a lot.

106
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,950
Because they have a say.

107
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,950
Since they're funding it.

108
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,030
They have a say on how this project is going to go.

109
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:28,570
So...

110
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,950
Or you can fund it yourself.

111
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,390
Which is basically...

112
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,810
If you fund it yourself, you get 100% on where your creativity is going towards.

113
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,230
It's like how a lot of like, passion projects are usually funded by themselves.

114
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,190
Because they don't want like, a higher, upper...

115
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,510
Person to like, dictate what it's going to be like.

116
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,810
And only...

117
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,670
You just want to do what you want to do.

118
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,750
So it's basically like, if you want funding.

119
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,410
Yeah, you don't have to pay for it yourself.

120
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,510
But a lot of the creative control is out of your hands.

121
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,390
So like, it's like very restricted.

122
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,590
But if you fund it yourself.

123
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,690
Obviously, you have the majority of creative control on how things are going.

124
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,470
So that's why I didn't make a slide.

125
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,490
Because it's like, it really heavily depends on like, how you want to do your project.

126
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,770
So I can give you how to organize your project.

127
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,390
Like, in terms of like, how I organize my projects.

128
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,830
Regarding what the Discord servers will look like.

129
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,210
I can give you guys an insight on like, how I separate a Discord server.

130
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,370
And stuff like that.

131
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,210
So there will be like, pictures and everything.

132
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,330
Don't worry.

133
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,130
This stream will be...

134
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,930
It's archived.

135
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,390
So...

136
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,290
So do not worry.

137
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,350
This stream is archived.

138
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,690
So you guys can rewatch it whenever you want.

139
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,250
Regarding stuff like this.

140
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,430
And I said before, I will not be going over anything that will break any aims.

141
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,190
Or anything that is like, very private information.

142
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,030
I will not be going through any of that.

143
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,710
I will mostly be going through like...

144
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,430
I guess, general knowledge that's already been out there.

145
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,310
Regarding when I talk about like, companies versus indies.

146
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,330
Should you join a company?

147
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,530
Or should you be an indie?

148
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,250
I'll be talking about like, pros and cons.

149
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,330
But all this information is...

150
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,530
A general knowledge.

151
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,670
It is out in public.

152
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,530
So like...

153
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,030
And it's not like NDA...

154
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,270
It doesn't break any NDAs.

155
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,090
All of this information is out in public.

156
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,910
But it's more so I give like, a highlighter.

157
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,310
On like, separating what are the benefits between...

158
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,450
Why people want to join a company.

159
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,430
And why people will want to join...

160
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,950
Want to continue being an indie.

161
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,690
There are pros and cons for each.

162
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,570
When you see the pros of like, company and indie.

163
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,810
You'll see why people will go for either.

164
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,690
And...

165
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,330
There are benefits for both.

166
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,170
For each one.

167
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:42,970
So...

168
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,650
The first off, I'm going to...

169
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,050
Also, I realized there's no BGM.

170
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,250
But I was trying to find a good BGM.

171
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,590
But I don't know...

172
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,070
I don't know what to use as a BGM.

173
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,370
I mean, I do have this.

174
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,150
A classic.

175
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,450
I could do that.

176
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,050
You know what?

177
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,470
Fuck it.

178
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,930
I'll have this be my BGM.

179
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,110
Alright.

180
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,290
This is going to be my BGM.

181
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,210
Anyway.

182
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:10,970
So...

183
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,850
We're going to go with the first slide.

184
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,090
We're going to go with a classic.

185
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,710
So...

186
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,210
The first slide.

187
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,630
The biggest factor.

188
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,570
Before I go into any of this.

189
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,530
The biggest factor...

190
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,910
Regarding how to make it.

191
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,030
As a content creator.

192
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,790
And like, as a Vtuber.

193
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,330
Is luck.

194
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,530
And networking.

195
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,290
And like, I'm not going to deny.

196
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,810
That luck pays a huge factor.

197
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,850
If you watch any like video.

198
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,970
Regarding like...

199
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,570
How do I become a content creator?

200
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,850
How do I be a big famous streamer?

201
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,250
How do I become famous?

202
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,350
Everybody will tell you.

203
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,670
That luck is one of the biggest factors.

204
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,930
When it comes to streaming.

205
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,170
To make it as a streamer.

206
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,430
It's your biggest...

207
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,190
Your big break.

208
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,930
Basically.

209
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,350
But...

210
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,690
Even when you have your big break.

211
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,610
You must be able to utilize it.

212
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,950
To keep the momentum.

213
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,930
So like, you can't...

214
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,290
You can't just like...

215
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,270
Have something.

216
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,390
You got your biggest break ever.

217
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,170
But then you don't utilize anything.

218
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,470
Regarding it.

219
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,190
You just coast.

220
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,450
After that.

221
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,890
That kills all your momentum.

222
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,210
Like...

223
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,070
I think that's like...

224
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,350
Really like...

225
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,390
That is like...

226
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,090
Very...

227
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,050
For some people.

228
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,770
That is incredibly obvious.

229
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,910
But there's so many times.

230
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,950
When someone will have their big break.

231
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,270
And then they do nothing with it.

232
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,150
They just coast.

233
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,890
They'll just keep on streaming as if it's normal.

234
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,110
The thing is.

235
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,310
When you get your biggest break ever.

236
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,970
You have to like...

237
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,930
Keep up the momentum.

238
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,090
And...

239
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,730
A lot of eyes are on you at that point.

240
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,370
You gotta grind.

241
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,110
You can't just take a break.

242
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,110
Right after you get your...

243
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,410
Like biggest opportunity.

244
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,150
Because sometimes.

245
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,270
When they get their big break.

246
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,030
They'll be like.

247
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,730
I'm not gonna stream after...

248
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,370
Uh...

249
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,110
I'm not gonna stream after like...

250
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,150
Two to three days.

251
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,190
That...

252
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,470
Your momentum's gone.

253
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,550
You gotta milk it.

254
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,110
I...

255
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,370
I know it's like...

256
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,970
It seems so...

257
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,810
Like...

258
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,670
Simple.

259
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,990
But it's something that a lot of people...

260
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,110
Don't realize.

261
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,350
You can't...

262
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,110
You know you're like...

263
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,130
Oh you have to take a break.

264
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,210
You have to rest.

265
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,370
But when you have a break.

266
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,850
You have the biggest opportunity of your life.

267
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,770
You can't rest until you're stable.

268
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,930
Like...

269
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,610
But the...

270
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,470
The huge thing is that...

271
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,810
Streaming isn't stable.

272
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,250
Content creation isn't stable.

273
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,270
But you have...

274
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,770
But when you have this opportunity.

275
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,950
You have to keep going.

276
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,930
Until you feel like you're safe.

277
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,150
That you won't lose this anymore.

278
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,470
Like...

279
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,390
And like...

280
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,110
That is why I'm like...

281
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,510
I was a huge workaholic when I started out.

282
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,890
And I still am.

283
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,630
Because I do really enjoy streaming.

284
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,910
Um...

285
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,290
It's when...

286
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,650
You feel like...

287
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,250
You're at a safe position.

288
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,370
That's when you can relax.

289
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,870
Um...

290
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,370
Because when you lose this...

291
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,230
The luck...

292
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,210
To your opportunity.

293
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,590
When will you get it again?

294
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,070
Type deal.

295
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,250
You have to go in thinking that you only have one...

296
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,910
Huge opportunity.

297
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,610
And you have to go in...

298
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,410
With...

299
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,090
Milk and...

300
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,610
That huge opportunity.

301
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,370
For as long as you can.

302
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,430
Until you realize...

303
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,550
You're in a safe and stable position.

304
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,810
To relax.

305
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,190
But...

306
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,110
A huge...

307
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,330
Huge...

308
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,590
Uh...

309
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,450
Like...

310
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,790
Negative side to this...

311
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,190
Is that some streamers...

312
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,450
Don't know when...

313
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,470
They are in a safe position.

314
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,330
That is...

315
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,370
Like...

316
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,170
The...

317
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,270
Hardest part.

318
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,070
And that's why a lot of streamers...

319
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,490
And a lot of content creators...

320
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,730
Don't know when to take a break.

321
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,110
Because they don't know when they are stable.

322
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,270
And that's why you see a lot of burnout.

323
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,530
And a lot of like...

324
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,590
Streamers...

325
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,430
Burning out.

326
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,550
Or like...

327
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,290
Just not being able to keep going.

328
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,470
Because they don't know exactly when...

329
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,270
This...

330
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,710
When the right moment is...

331
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:28,950
To relax.

332
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,890
And that is a huge...

333
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,350
Problem.

334
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,490
Because...

335
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,290
Streaming is also very new.

336
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,950
It's not a very long career.

337
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,630
We don't know the effects of...

338
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,950
Streaming as a long career.

339
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,370
Right now...

340
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,110
We are seeing...

341
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,190
Big YouTubers...

342
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,050
Finally...

343
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,670
Like...

344
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,190
Quitting.

345
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,510
After like what?

346
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,890
20 plus years...

347
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,770
On YouTube.

348
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,810
Um...

349
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,370
We are now seeing like...

350
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,270
Big YouTubers...

351
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,610
Finally deciding to retire.

352
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,550
But those are YouTubers.

353
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,930
We have yet to see the outcome...

354
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,070
Of streamers.

355
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,270
At best...

356
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,670
A lot of the big streamers...

357
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,930
A lot of the famous streamers...

358
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,130
Are still going.

359
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,550
So like...

360
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,570
We are seeing...

361
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,090
Big YouTubers...

362
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,310
Finally retiring.

363
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,150
But we haven't seen...

364
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,390
Big streamers...

365
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,290
Finally...

366
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,410
Taking a break.

367
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,030
Or fin...

368
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,770
Not taking a break...

369
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,550
But finally retiring.

370
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,790
So...

371
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,670
At this point...

372
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,510
We don't know what's...

373
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,050
Happened.

374
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,370
We don't know the career...

375
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,830
Of streaming in general.

376
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:25,870
Uh...

377
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,210
Jerma kinda retired...

378
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,750
But Jerma is still sort of...

379
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,730
He's still like...

380
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,390
Sort of...

381
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:33,950
Going...

382
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,730
Ongoing...

383
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,350
Type deal.

384
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:35,910
He's not really...

385
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,930
Like retired retired.

386
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:37,970
He's like...

387
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,730
Semi retired.

388
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,390
But even then...

389
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,010
We are not...

390
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,650
He's like...

391
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,050
One of the biggest...

392
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,170
Out there.

393
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,350
Like he is literally...

394
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,650
Okay...

395
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,750
You can say like...

396
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,090
Making it in streaming...

397
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,810
Is 1%.

398
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,790
Jerma...

399
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,110
Is like the 0.001%.

400
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,670
Because...

401
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,150
He has become a meme.

402
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,850
So because of that...

403
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,790
He has like...

404
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,930
Transcended...

405
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,930
To like...

406
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,650
Meme status.

407
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,470
Which means...

408
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,150
It's forever...

409
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,750
Type deal.

410
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:05,890
So...

411
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,470
It's forever type deal.

412
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,130
And because of that...

413
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,510
Like...

414
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,050
He...

415
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,630
It's a different story...

416
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,490
Regarding like...

417
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,270
Regular streamers.

418
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,990
And so...

419
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,550
There's...

420
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,990
There's lots of things like this...

421
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,570
To worry about.

422
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,130
Like...

423
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,070
You have to know...

424
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,970
When you can relax...

425
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,710
And when you can take a break.

426
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,610
And...

427
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,410
I feel like...

428
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,490
When you have your biggest opportunities...

429
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,110
I personally think like...

430
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,210
You keep going...

431
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,290
Until...

432
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:33,810
Like...

433
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,630
You can start to see...

434
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:35,870
Like...

435
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,830
That...

436
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,690
Uh...

437
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,050
That your growth...

438
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,290
Has stabilized...

439
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,290
Type deal.

440
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:41,910
Like...

441
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,510
It has stabilized to a number...

442
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,990
That you think is gonna be your average...

443
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,870
For a while...

444
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,810
And that even if you take a break...

445
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,650
Like maybe like...

446
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,610
One to two weeks break...

447
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,510
I know like some people are like...

448
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,790
A month break or something...

449
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,930
I personally think...

450
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,610
This is my opinion...

451
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,110
But I personally think...

452
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,550
One to two weeks...

453
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,950
Is like the optimal...

454
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,130
Length...

455
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,350
You can take as a...

456
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,430
For a break...

457
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,850
In Vtubing...

458
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,750
And content creation...

459
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,850
And...

460
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,070
Content creation...

461
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,410
Um...

462
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,870
Well content creation is another hand...

463
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,770
But I think in Vtubing...

464
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,590
One to two weeks...

465
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,050
Is the optimal spot...

466
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,550
Um...

467
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,810
If you're in a company...

468
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,770
You might be able to take a longer break...

469
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,550
But like...

470
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,510
If you're an indie...

471
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,890
One to two weeks...

472
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,670
Has...

473
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,110
Is like the optimal spot...

474
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,870
For a break...

475
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,550
Because you're not gone long enough...

476
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,490
That people...

477
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,330
That it will affect your algorithm...

478
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,310
And you're not gone long enough...

479
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,490
That like...

480
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,230
Uh...

481
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,830
That you're not gonna be able to...

482
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,350
That like...

483
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,370
People have...

484
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:37,910
You know...

485
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,110
Watched other streamers...

486
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,070
And stuff like that...

487
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,590
Um...

488
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,750
One to two weeks is like the safe zone...

489
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,270
Anything more than that...

490
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,410
It's a little bit...

491
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,010
Of like...

492
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,870
A gamble...

493
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,870
It's like how...

494
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,470
It's more so of like...

495
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,950
How much have you like...

496
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,550
Nurtured your fan base...

497
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,090
To be able to...

498
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,830
Uh...

499
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,550
To be able to like...

500
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,030
Take longer breaks...

501
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,930
Um...

502
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,390
This is...

503
00:17:59,390 --> 00:17:59,910
As I said...

504
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,950
This is all my own...

505
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,730
Opinion...

506
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,630
Um...

507
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,850
If you're on Twitch...

508
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,730
You don't have to worry about algorithm that much...

509
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:05,810
Um...

510
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,950
But like...

511
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,870
If you're on YouTube...

512
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,710
Algorithm...

513
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,490
Is like...

514
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,150
Very, very important...

515
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,650
Um...

516
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,890
Because it affects on...

517
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,730
How much is...

518
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,410
Your content...

519
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,050
Is being pushed outside...

520
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,870
Of...

521
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,030
The regular sphere...

522
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,070
Uh...

523
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,010
So...

524
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,390
It really...

525
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,890
Uh...

526
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,910
Why is it not to work...

527
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,470
Be worried on Twitch?

528
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,330
It's because...

529
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,890
There's no...

530
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,410
The YouTube...

531
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,830
The Twitch algorithm...

532
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,190
Is different...

533
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,730
From the YouTube algorithm...

534
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,850
The Twitch algorithm...

535
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,270
Is mostly just...

536
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,710
You know...

537
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,550
The front page...

538
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:34,870
With the...

539
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,550
Like...

540
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,330
The streamers you wanna watch...

541
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:37,730
You might...

542
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,370
Would recommend...

543
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,090
And stuff like that...

544
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,190
But Twitch growth...

545
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,770
Is mostly relied...

546
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,590
On...

547
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,570
Raids...

548
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,190
Uh...

549
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,230
Which I will talk about...

550
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,150
In another slide...

551
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,710
Uh...

552
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,570
Raids and VTuber collabs...

553
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,070
Or collaborations in general...

554
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,990
Really help benefits...

555
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,250
Um...

556
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,610
Twitch growth...

557
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,810
While on YouTube...

558
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,270
Uh...

559
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,250
YouTube growth...

560
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,650
Really benefits on...

561
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,770
The algorithm...

562
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,490
And what you upload...

563
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,110
And...

564
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,570
Uh...

565
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,730
What you're streaming...

566
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,770
And types like that...

567
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,230
Uh...

568
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,730
Raids...

569
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,650
Hard carry...

570
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,030
Twitch...

571
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,450
Uh...

572
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:06,890

573
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,350
Uh...

574
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,310

Because you're like...

576
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,310
Funneling viewers...

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,990
Into like...

578
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,470
Other...

579
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,550
Other people...

580
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,450
It's very easy to funnel viewers...

581
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,490
To other people...

582
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:15,990
YouTube...

583
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,750
Is more so...

584
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,870
Regarding uploads...

585
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,630

586
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,670

590
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,450
And your consistency...

591
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,610
The moment you're...

592
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,070

593
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,710
Coasting on YouTube...

594
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,630
The less YouTube will push you out...

595
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,250
To other new viewers...

596
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,010

597
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,890
I have a slide...

598
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,350
That mostly talks about...

599
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,130
The algorithm...

600
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,290

601
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:36,710

607
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:40,670

609
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,710

610
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,650

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,050
Anyway...

613
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,250
Another thing I want to talk about...

614
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,310
Is networking...

615
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,130
Um...

616
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,290
Your growth...

617
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,470
Heavily relies...

618
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,350
On networking...

619
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:57,650
And...

620
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,190
Who you reach out to...

621
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,810
And...

622
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,970
Who you're working with...

623
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,670
Who you're socializing with...

624
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,430
Um...

625
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,330
How you're growing...

626
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:04,810
Like...

627
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,570
It relies heavily on...

628
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,670
Your social...

629
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,730
Social skills...

630
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,710
And...

631
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,410
Uh...

632
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,010
And...

633
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,470
How...

634
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,190
How you're...

635
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:12,590
How...

636
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,990

637
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,130
To reaching out...

638
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,390
To...

639
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,210
To people...

640
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,170
Type deal...

641
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,570
It doesn't have to be...

642
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,090
Like...

643
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,090
Friendships...

644
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,590
And stuff...

645
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,850
It could be just like...

646
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,190

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,030
Like...

648
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,330
It doesn't have to be friendship...

649
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:25,530
Like...

650
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:25,950
You don't have...

651
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,530
You don't have to be friends with everybody...

652
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,150
Um...

653
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,350
It can be just like...

654
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,890
A casual...

655
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,110
Like...

656
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,330
Relationship between...

657
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:31,770

00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,830
Uh...

660
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,450
Partners...

661
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,230
And stuff like that...

662
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,650
Like...

663
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,690
It doesn't have to be...

664
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,810
It can just be like...

665
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,350
A...

666
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,170
Co-worker...

667
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,050
Or something...

668
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,030
And...

669
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,730
Uh...

670
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,890
It doesn't have to be a friendship...

671
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,810
It can be a colleague...

672
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,170
Yeah...

673
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,350
It could be a colleague...

674
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,230
And...

675
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,090
Uh...

676
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,810
And like...

677
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,450
Just someone like...

678
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,030
Mutual...

679
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,890
Mutual...

680
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,090
Like...

681
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,070
Collab partners...

682
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,910
Uh...

683
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,430
So it...

684
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,030
Doesn't...

685
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,810
You don't have to force yourself to be friends with everybody...

686
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:56,770
Um...

687
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,830
Especially if you're like an introvert like me...

688
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,270
I don't have to force myself to be friends with...

689
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,910
Like...

690
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,470
Everybody I meet...

691
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,210
Um...

692
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,030
Type deal...

693
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,770
Uh...

694
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,290
I don't...

695
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,390
I meet people...

696
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,770
But I don't have to be like...

697
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,230
Force...

698
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,610
Friendships on people...

699
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,170
Because it has to be mutual...

700
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,130
It has to be a mutual friendship...

701
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,390
And like...

702
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,050
There's like mutual...

703
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,270
Um...

704
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,410
Like...

705
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,730
You can...

706
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,910
You feel like you grew with somebody...

707
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,470
Uh...

708
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,990
I don't know...

709
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,450
Also...

710
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:22,710
Like...

711
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,210
There's...

712
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,830
Stream personalities...

713
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,470
Is not the same as off-stream personalities...

714
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,370
How I portray myself on stream...

715
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,790
I'm like super energetic...

716
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,870
I'm like...

717
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,810
I'm like chaotic and stuff like that...

718
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,510
Um...

719
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,290
But...

720
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,870
I'm also an introvert...

721
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,870
So like...

722
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,510
Uh...

723
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,370
On stream...

724
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,750
It's very easy for me to...

725
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,970
Be like that...

726
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,570
Because like...

727
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,170
I very much enjoy streaming...

728
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,090
And...

729
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,070
Um...

730
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,750
And I very much enjoy streaming and I very like I love like making content and stuff like that.

731
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,030
But like off stream, I am very like chill.

732
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:14,370
I'm like super I'm like chill and I'm like low energy because I put all my energy into on to stream type deal.

733
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,510
Like I put a lot of my energies on stream and like, you know, my battery is low off stream.

734
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:28,250
So my off stream is like very different because I most of my energy and most of my battery is on stream.

735
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,410
So like I said, like on stream, maybe you like grew with somebody's on stream personality.

736
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:41,150
Like the on stream chemistry is is like really, really good.

737
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,490
But me off stream, you're just casual acquaintances.

738
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,790
And stuff like that.

739
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,150
So like I said, you don't have to be friends with everybody.

740
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,930
But it's really good to like know people at least like, you know, know some people.

741
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,270
For example, like Twitch Rivals.

742
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,970
When I got invited to my first time invited Twitch Rivals.

743
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:07,970
I talked with I talked with like the head one of the head people who organizes Twitch Rivals.

744
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,790
I had talked with them.

745
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,090
I like gave them like ideas and my opinions on stuff.

746
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,570
And I told them like, oh, I really enjoy Twitch Rivals.

747
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,410
It was really, really fun.

748
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:22,510
If you if possible, can I is it possibly invited in future Twitch Rivals?

749
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:28,950
Because I really enjoy doing them and I was I could have just like done Twitch Rivals and not cared about it after that.

750
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:36,170
But instead, I personally reached out to the head of the Twitch Rivals organizer and told them how much I enjoy doing them.

751
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:42,490
How much like how much my fans enjoying me doing them.

752
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,070
and told them how much I enjoy doing them, how much like how much my fans enjoying me doing them.

753
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,090
And that is how I got my connections with Twitch.

754
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,930
It's because I took the extra step to interact with the pet people who are organizing these events.

755
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:59,190
And then just be like, I really enjoyed it.

756
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,370
And if possible, can I be invited to future Twitch Rivals?

757
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,850
And that's really it.

758
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,550
That's how I basically got invites consistently to these events.

759
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,430
And just, you have to be like... and I have fun on them!

760
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:15,750
I do!

761
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,630
It shows in my streams and it shows when I reached out directly to the pet organizers.

762
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,210
And like, that's also like... it doesn't matter.

763
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,050
This applies to everything.

764
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,290
Like events and like... events and all this other stuff.

765
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:36,290
If you ask directly, the worst they can say is no.

766
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,390
Like, or ghost you.

767
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,650
And you already...

768
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,530
You took your chance.

769
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,950
You took your shot.

770
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,070
Like...

771
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,010
Like, you took your shot and that's all that matters.

772
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,450
And it's all about like, taking your shot.

773
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,190
You have to get onto these opportunities.

774
00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:01,350
And be able to interact with people and like, openly ask about whether or not it's possible to do these things.

775
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,310
Like... and...

776
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,130
I mean, if they ghost you, then you're like, fine.

777
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:07,970
You move on.

778
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,510
You have to be able to accept reality.

779
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,310
And you have to accept rejection and getting ghosted.

780
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,570
Because that is the way of being a streamer and content creator.

781
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,070
It's gonna fucking hurt.

782
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,990
But like, I got ghosted and rejected for things.

783
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,150
Like... and I'm...

784
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,310
Okay, I'm not fine.

785
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,230
But you have to accept it.

786
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:28,890
Like...

787
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,050
That's the thing.

788
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,590
You need to accept rejection.

789
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,290
Also, Phreaw, thank you for the Akasupa.

790
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,510
Thank you, thank you.

791
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,370
Sorry, professor.

792
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,170
I almost forgot to pay for class.

793
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,030
Oh yeah.

794
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:44,990
Oh yeah, sorry.

795
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,970
For those of you who don't know, the tuition.

796
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,370
The class tuition.

797
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,050
Anyway, like I said.

798
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:57,010
That is one of the biggest factors on like, making it as a content creator.

799
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,210
Um...

800
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,290
But yes, like I said.

801
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,250
Luck is why a lot of people want to join a company.

802
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,570
Because...

803
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,790
Making it into a company is the luck part.

804
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,490
And...

805
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,490
It already comes with an established audience.

806
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:13,670
And...

807
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,130
After that...

808
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,230
Even when you make it to the company.

809
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,850
It's your job to keep those eyes on you.

810
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,590
And continue building it.

811
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,410
Because it's not like...

812
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,050
You can coast after that.

813
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,430
It's like...

814
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,990
You have to keep going after that.

815
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,770
Or you're just gonna stagnate.

816
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,150
So, um...

817
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,470
Which is why my next slide will be going over...

818
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,150
Um...

819
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,630
Indie versus company.

820
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,710
So, I'm going over company first.

821
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,490
And a lot of this is...

822
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,570
Sort of like, public knowledge.

823
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,390
So, I'm not gonna be going into any details regarding anything that could break NDA.

824
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,230
And stuff like that.

825
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,510
But a lot of this information is like, public knowledge.

826
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,530
That I'm pretty sure...

827
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,410
Like, it doesn't matter if it's like a small company or a big company.

828
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,270
It generally is like...

829
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,710
It's very like, to the point regarding like...

830
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,290
Situations and stuff like this.

831
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:07,670
So...

832
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,190
Uh...

833
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,310
So like, pros and cons.

834
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,930
So, obviously I'll be going over like...

835
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,070
Why should you join a company?

836
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,230
And also like...

837
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,350
Things to be aware of.

838
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,350
And like I said...

839
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,950
You get an instant audience base.

840
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,810
So, the audience of the company...

841
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,250
And of the Vtubers...

842
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,550
That debuted before you...

843
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,670
Will be there for your debut.

844
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:31,790
Obviously.

845
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:32,970
Because...

846
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,670
You might not be the first person there.

847
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,610
You know...

848
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,330
If it's not a new company...

849
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,270
Um... That you're starting...

850
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,190
Uh...

851
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,610
There is already the branding involved.

852
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,530
So you're going in...

853
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,610
With...

854
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,170
You're going in...

855
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,850
With like...

856
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,310
An established audience.

857
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,850
And because of that...

858
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,550
That's why a lot of people want to join.

859
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,390
If you're nobody...

860
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,590
If you came with zero viewers...

861
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,150
Then of course...

862
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:05,810
Like...

863
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,710
On your debut...

864
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,990
Like... I don't know... 20 plus viewers...

865
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,570
If you come from zero... 20 plus...

866
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,450
100... 200... 1000...

867
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,490
That's a lot from what you were used to.

868
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,810
Um... It draws a lot of attention.

869
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,910
And it's your job to make a good debut.

870
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,970
So you can keep the attention...

871
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,070
Of those people...

872
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,110
Uh...

873
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,790
That watched you.

874
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,450
They don't know anything about you.

875
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,150
But they're all here to be there to watch you.

876
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,050
They know zero things.

877
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,770
Zero things.

878
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,910
Other than what you've given out.

879
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,950
What your skin suit is.

880
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,130
And like...

881
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,190
What your personality is like on Twitter.

882
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,890
And that's it.

883
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,410
That's all the information they have of you.

884
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,870
But even so...

885
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,790
You're going in there with an established audience base.

886
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,670
That are fans of the company.

887
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,810
Or the VTubers that came before you.

888
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,290
And um...

889
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,790
And they're here to watch you.

890
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,450
So you have all this exposure.

891
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,910
Right off the bat.

892
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,550
You could be a hidden gem out there.

893
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,750
As an indie.

894
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,990
Before you sign up for a company.

895
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,050
And it's up to the company.

896
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,250
To reveal...

897
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,850
Why you're a hidden gem.

898
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,610
And uh...

899
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,570
Because there's so many really good indies out there.

900
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,690
That never had their big break.

901
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,010
But it's only because of...

902
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,230
Joining a company.

903
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,090
They received their big break.

904
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,830
And that is why a lot of people take that chance.

905
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,050
Another reason why...

906
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:31,890
Is because...

907
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,050
You get a group of people...

908
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,350
To collaborate with.

909
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,510
Instantly.

910
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,450
And this is one of the things I've learned as an indie.

911
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,630
How it's...

912
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,230
Very difficult.

913
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,470
As an indie.

914
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,210
Is to find a group of people.

915
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,950
Or a collab group that you want to do collabs with.

916
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,030
And um...

917
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,030
And uh...

918
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,550
Be able to like...

919
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,170
You know organize something really easily.

920
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,470
In general.

921
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,310
So in a company.

922
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,790
You can't really just ask anybody.

923
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,550
Like there might be a server or something.

924
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,350
And you can just be like...

925
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,750
Add everyone.

926
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,110
I want to play this game.

927
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,810
And uh...

928
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,870
I need people to play there.

929
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,610
I need three people.

930
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,850
And that is why one reason...

931
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,850
One of the reasons why people want to join.

932
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,790
They want a sense of community.

933
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,830
And they want a group of people to be able to...

934
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,890
To be able to play games with.

935
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,410
Or like to be able to organize stuff with.

936
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,130
And um...

937
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,770
It's why a lot of people...

938
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,730
Would want to join.

939
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,510
And that makes sense.

940
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,990
As an indie you have to socialize and meet people.

941
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,010
And get close enough to invite them to things.

942
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,210
And when you are in a company.

943
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,250
You don't really have to do that.

944
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,910
It could be colleagues or something.

945
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,690
And you can just be like...

946
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,470
Hey you guys want to do this?

947
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,450
I don't really know you.

948
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,710
But you are in the company.

949
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,370
So obviously let's do something together.

950
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,910
So...

951
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,010
So it gives like a security.

952
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,870
Of like having a group of people.

953
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,130
That you can just work with.

954
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,010
And you don't have to contact people outside of your circle.

955
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,230
To fill in spots or work on socializing.

956
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,930
And the next reason is...

957
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,390
If you are a singer or a dancer.

958
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,710
So the reason why I put that.

959
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,210
Is that it's very beneficial for...

960
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,330
Uh...

961
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:22,350
If you are a singer or a dancer.

962
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,270
Is that if you have talents in singing or dancing.

963
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,450
To work for a company.

964
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,330
And because of that.

965
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,810
Because the reason is that...

966
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,950
A lot of the biggest events that Vtuber companies do.

967
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,250
It doesn't matter how big or small.

968
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,290
Are concerts.

969
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,170
And like singing.

970
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,770
And if you are talented at singing.

971
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,330
You will get picked to do concerts.

972
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,490
If you can sing.

973
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,350
You will get those opportunities to perform around the world for fans.

974
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,870
Since you are under a group.

975
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,150
You can do big group concerts with lots of other singers.

976
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,470
And it's much easier to set up.

977
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,010
Versus as an individual.

978
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,150
And all the costs are within.

979
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,190
From the company.

980
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,350
And that's why if you are a singer or a dancer.

981
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,550
It really benefits you.

982
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,430
Because like...

983
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,270
Like I said.

984
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,350
You get to be picked to do these types of events.

985
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:09,750
And...

986
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,130
And these are like one of the...

987
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,670
I won't say the easiest events to organize.

988
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,050
But like the most common events.

989
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,530
To...

990
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,130
To see...

991
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,450
Being hosted by Vtuber companies.

992
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,230
Because it's like...

993
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,350
Some things that fans love.

994
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,850
And some things that is easy...

995
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,410
Not easy.

996
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,270
But like...

997
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,330
They have a lot of experience organizing.

998
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,410
And also like they have access to like...

999
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,210
Music labels maybe.

1000
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,810
It depends on which company you are joining.

1001
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,990
But...

1002
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,790
If you want to be...

1003
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,570
Make it more...

1004
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,810
If you want to be like...

1005
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,130
More well known as a singer.

1006
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,310
It's easier to do that when you are joining a company.

1007
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,730
Versus being an individual.

1008
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,090
Because getting your talents out there.

1009
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,690
Is easier because of that.

1010
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,010
As well as like...

1011
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,330
Not only that.

1012
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,630
But cover songs.

1013
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,430
Group songs.

1014
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:09,550
Karaoke's.

1015
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,890
These are like some of the easiest ways.

1016
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,830
To help boost not only your channel.

1017
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,110
But the company's branding as well.

1018
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,370
So like...

1019
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,130
These are like some of the things to be able to do.

1020
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,690
That you should be aware of.

1021
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,570
Because like I said.

1022
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,750
Hosting concerts and stuff like that worldwide.

1023
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,310
Is like some of the easiest things to do as an entertainer.

1024
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,930
Versus like...

1025
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,670
For me.

1026
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,310
I think it's one of the reasons why.

1027
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,450
I felt like I was...

1028
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,850
I'd be slacking off or like not worth much.

1029
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,010
Because as a person who can't sing.

1030
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,770
Or a beginner.

1031
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,130
You have to think.

1032
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,170
What can I offer to the company.

1033
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,290
That can be used for events and big productions.

1034
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,550
And it's harder.

1035
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,290
Because you have to be more creative.

1036
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,790
And know where your own talents lie.

1037
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,090
For me.

1038
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,510
I would say like gaming.

1039
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,110
But I can't really do that.

1040
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,070
I can't have like...

1041
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,050
Host like a big event.

1042
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,610
Regarding like...

1043
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,450
Fan event regarding gaming.

1044
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,850
Like it's very like...

1045
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,490
Harder.

1046
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,510
I feel like personally.

1047
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,590
It might be harder to do.

1048
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,770
Versus like singing.

1049
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,130
So like...

1050
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,150
What if we're like...

1051
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,810
Oh, but Doki.

1052
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,450
What about like tournaments and stuff like that?

1053
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,330
It's harder because you can't do like...

1054
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,510
LAN stuff.

1055
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,670
If you're a Vtuber.

1056
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,150
You know.

1057
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,190
I mean there's like moments.

1058
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,930
Because you can't go to LAN.

1059
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,670
So like... that's different.

1060
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,050
You can't be like...

1061
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,850
Oh my god.

1062
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,510
Because like...

1063
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,790
I was invited to do like...

1064
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,170
Um...

1065
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,510
I have moments in the past.

1066
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,290
Where I was invited to do things like...

1067
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,110
Uh...

1068
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,410
Like physical meet and greets.

1069
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,670
For like gaming stuff.

1070
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,050
Or like I had to be there.

1071
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,930
Like I won't show up.

1072
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,650
I won't like be there on the stage.

1073
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,570
But I had to be there.

1074
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,130
Like at the event.

1075
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,850
And I had to say no.

1076
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,730
Because as a Vtuber.

1077
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,310
That is very dangerous.

1078
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,930
I said no for these.

1079
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,390
Because like...

1080
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,230
Uh...

1081
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,510
Obviously like risk wise.

1082
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,790
Like being there.

1083
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,310
Physically being there.

1084
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,470
Um...

1085
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,950
As a Vtuber there's a lot of risk to it.

1086
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,290
So I've had to say no.

1087
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,170
To like LAN events in the past.

1088
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,630
Where I had to actually be there.

1089
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,470
To play the game.

1090
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,830
And um...

1091
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,370
I didn't feel very comfortable with that.

1092
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,510
I didn't feel very comfortable.

1093
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:43,790
Uh...

1094
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,850
Because I was worried.

1095
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,770
I was worried because I was like...

1096
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,710
I don't know if I'll be actually...

1097
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,950
If like I'll be safe.

1098
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,790
Type deal.

1099
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,410
So in the past I have said no to these opportunities.

1100
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,010
Um...

1101
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,530
Also another thing is...

1102
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,430
If the main branch is not English speaking.

1103
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,810
But you speak the language.

1104
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,670
One of the reasons why I put this here.

1105
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,470
Is that you want to apply to...

1106
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,110
For a company whose main branch is in English speaking.

1107
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,110
I strongly suggest...

1108
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,490
Learning that language.

1109
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,670
While you're applying.

1110
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,150
Or if you make it in.

1111
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,510
And because... why?

1112
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,920
Because speaking that language...

1113
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,690
Offers so many opportunities.

1114
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,120
Um...

1115
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,040
Including being able to collaborate...

1116
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,290
With talents.

1117
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,590
And participate in main branch events.

1118
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,690
Um...

1119
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,390
If it is only in that language.

1120
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,710
And signups are exclusive.

1121
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,430
To being able to speak that language.

1122
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,590
Um...

1123
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,190
You're obviously like...

1124
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,050
Shutting down a huge...

1125
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,650
Set of network.

1126
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,550
And a huge set of opportunities.

1127
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,890
That you know...

1128
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,410
You wouldn't be able to access.

1129
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,650
If you don't learn that language.

1130
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,450
Um...

1131
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,930
It makes sense.

1132
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,230
Because you have to be able to communicate with everyone.

1133
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,370
And be able to keep the production going.

1134
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,210
Another thing is that the main consumer base.

1135
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:04,850
And experience.

1136
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,050
Will also be in the main branch.

1137
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,390
Most of the sales and consumer products.

1138
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,290
Might be exclusive to one country.

1139
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,910
Because manufacturing and like shipping.

1140
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,650
Is just easier.

1141
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,530
You know it's all there.

1142
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:19,930
So...

1143
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,390
So like...

1144
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,610
It's all there.

1145
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,630
Like overseas shipping is very expensive.

1146
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,630
So maybe they want to make something.

1147
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,790
That is exclusive.

1148
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,690
To like this particular country.

1149
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,490
Because it's just easier.

1150
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,650
Especially if it's like brand deals.

1151
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,450
Or like sponsors.

1152
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,470
It's like only located in one region.

1153
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,850
So it's just easier.

1154
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:43,930
In the long run.

1155
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,590
It's hard to learn a new language.

1156
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,970
But if you're trying to apply for a company.

1157
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,550
Or if you're trying to get into a company.

1158
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,370
Whose main language isn't English.

1159
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,910
It might as well...

1160
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,910
You might as well do it.

1161
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,590
If you want to grow as a content creator.

1162
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,630
In that company.

1163
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:58,830
Um...

1164
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,170
And if you're...

1165
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,770
So it's like it's super understandable.

1166
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,730
Why it would be very beneficial to you.

1167
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:06,890
Uh...

1168
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,430
And like if you speak...

1169
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,390
The language.

1170
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,730
You might have more fans in the main target demographic.

1171
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,490
Thus offering you more opportunities.

1172
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,950
To receive sponsors.

1173
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,610
Dedicated to the main demographic.

1174
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,550
So like stuff like that.

1175
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,850
It seems like super simple.

1176
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,170
But like...

1177
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,150
It's like something you have to be incredibly committed to do.

1178
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,590
Um...

1179
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,930
You don't even have to be like...

1180
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,870
Super fluent.

1181
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,630
You could be like...

1182
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,410
Semi fluent and that is fine.

1183
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,130
It just helps you in the long run.

1184
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:43,530
Um...

1185
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,030
Anyway...

1186
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,170
You have to have...

1187
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,870
Learning language is incredibly difficult.

1188
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,330
And it's more so like...

1189
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,390
You just have to be like...

1190
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,990
Very dedicated to doing so.

1191
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,250
And networking also benefits.

1192
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,810
Because you can reach out to like...

1193
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,130
Different fan bases.

1194
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,330
And stuff like that.

1195
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,590
Like by knowing...

1196
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,910
Because like obviously...

1197
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:08,130
The English fan base might be different from other language speaking fan bases.

1198
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,270
So...

1199
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,670
The more you know.

1200
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,550
The more beneficial it is to you.

1201
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,950
Also but if you are like doing...

1202
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,250
Trying to cater to both fan bases.

1203
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,510
You need to be able to balance this.

1204
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,830
So like...

1205
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,950
You have to be able to...

1206
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,730
The hardest part is being able to balance...

1207
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,610
Speaking languages for different audience bases.

1208
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,870
Because you have to make sure...

1209
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,870
Like one audience doesn't feel left out over the other.

1210
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,090
So you have to be able to balance this...

1211
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,170
Very well as well.

1212
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,630
Because you are gonna like...

1213
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,950
You know some people are gonna feel left out.

1214
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,170
And you can't stop that.

1215
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,810
People are gonna feel left out.

1216
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,910
But you have to be able to make sure...

1217
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,850
That you are not catering to one side more than the other.

1218
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,750
So you have to find like a healthy balance.

1219
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,790
My suggestions on these is...

1220
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,890
Just maybe have like...

1221
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,030
One stream a week.

1222
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,390
Dedicated to...

1223
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,970
Speaking that language.

1224
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,410
Just to keep up with like...

1225
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,930
Nurturing that fan base.

1226
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,490
Or like...

1227
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,610
I feel like...

1228
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,810
Just be able to have like one or two streams a week.

1229
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,990
Just dedicate it to that.

1230
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:10,830
And...

1231
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,370
Another thing is you don't need to worry about like...

1232
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,890
Big picture and legal stuff.

1233
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,850
What I meant by that is that...

1234
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,770
When you are in a company.

1235
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,790
All of this is handled by the management.

1236
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,790
So as an indie.

1237
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,650
What I have noticed is that as an indie.

1238
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,510
When you get more like...

1239
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,450
Merch collaborations.

1240
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,350
Like offers and deals.

1241
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,250
There is like contracts and negotiations that you have to be involved in.

1242
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,290
Um...

1243
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,730
And because of that.

1244
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,550
You also have to obviously read those...

1245
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,390
Those contracts of like...

1246
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,590
The merch negotiations.

1247
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,590
Or like sponsor stuff.

1248
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:44,990
Or like...

1249
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:45,330
You have to read the contracts.

1250
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,590
Um...

1251
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,630
But when you are in a company.

1252
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,490
You don't really have to worry that much about the big picture stuff.

1253
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,770
Because obviously.

1254
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,270
The company will make sure it wouldn't like hurt them.

1255
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,710
Regarding like sponsors and merch stuff.

1256
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,850
So like you put your trust in that.

1257
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,010
But when you are as an indie.

1258
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,670
You have to make sure that like...

1259
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,410
Even if your manager is reading as an indie.

1260
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,330
Even if your manager is reading that.

1261
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,370
You have to read it yourself as well.

1262
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,350
Because what...

1263
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,130
You are doing.

1264
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,170
Doesn't necessarily mean that that is what you want.

1265
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,090
So you have to be able to read your contracts.

1266
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,030
And negotiate for things you want.

1267
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,350
And that is obviously like a lot of work.

1268
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,930
And that is obviously like a lot of work.

1269
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,200
Anyway another one obviously.

1270
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,640
Is like 3D.

1271
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,920
Obviously companies are very well experienced.

1272
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,600
With having...

1273
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,960
Doing 3Ds.

1274
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,240
And having 3D done.

1275
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,760
Like they have all the experience.

1276
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,380
And I would say people in Japan.

1277
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,540
Companies in Japan.

1278
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,980
Have the most experience with doing.

1279
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,100
Vtuber 3D stuff.

1280
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,560
Because you know.

1281
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,460
They have like perfected it.

1282
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,580
They perfected it.

1283
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,480
And I feel like in NA.

1284
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,880
A lot of companies in NA are still playing catch up.

1285
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,620
When it comes to what JP companies have done.

1286
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,080
Or not just JP companies.

1287
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,320
But JP indies too.

1288
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,740
Um...

1289
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,040
Indies in Japan.

1290
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,380
Also have like really good 3Ds.

1291
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,360
Because a lot of studios in Japan.

1292
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,440
Are very well versed.

1293
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,240
In doing anime 3Ds.

1294
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,960
NA are still doing catch up.

1295
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,240
So there is still a lot of time.

1296
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,300
Like there is still a lot of catch up.

1297
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,600
It's also a lot of work.

1298
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,940
3D in general is a lot of work.

1299
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:35,840
So...

1300
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,160
But that is like one thing that can offer.

1301
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,900
As an indie you might not be able to have that opportunity.

1302
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,120
Because as an indie.

1303
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,180
Um...

1304
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,520
Getting a studio that is able to.

1305
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,700
Be able to handle all of that.

1306
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,600
Having the assets made as well.

1307
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,800
The thing about like.

1308
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,340
Like Japanese companies.

1309
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,740
And Japanese like 3D tech.

1310
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,220
Is that a lot of them.

1311
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,640
Have already have assets made.

1312
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,960
From the past.

1313
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,040
That you can use.

1314
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,280
Um...

1315
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,360
So they are always keeping assets.

1316
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,880
That can help benefit them more in the future.

1317
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,060
Um...

1318
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,980
It is a lot of money invested.

1319
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,040
And they have already invested so much money.

1320
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,040
That is why.

1321
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,800
That is why like it is much more difficult.

1322
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,280
As an indie.

1323
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,340
And if you are really looking forward to an indie.

1324
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,360
To doing 3D and stuff.

1325
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,780
There is a reason why you want to join a company.

1326
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,960
And finally sponsors.

1327
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,060
It's easier.

1328
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,700
You don't have to reach out for sponsors.

1329
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,660
Like a lot of times.

1330
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,520
You don't have to make a fucking deck.

1331
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,660
Like...

1332
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,520
You guys don't know.

1333
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
You have to have a pitch deck made.

1334
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,940
As an indie.

1335
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,720
But like for sponsors.

1336
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,040
The company will already provide.

1337
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,340
Like your company will be working on finding these sponsors for you.

1338
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,140
And uh...

1339
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,000
So for those who don't know what pitch deck is.

1340
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,580
Is basically a pitch deck.

1341
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,220
Is basically a...

1342
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,160
Like a thing that you send to companies.

1343
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,100
To like business companies.

1344
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,580
Or sponsors or brand deals.

1345
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,140
To like advertise yourself.

1346
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,720
And it's like as an indie.

1347
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,700
And it's like as a portfolio.

1348
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,720
Because like that is your way of like advertising yourself.

1349
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,220
As like a portfolio.

1350
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,080
To advertise yourself to like other companies.

1351
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,980
But when you are part of a company.

1352
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,660
You don't have to worry about that.

1353
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,080
Your company will be doing all that.

1354
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,760
And they will be picking people who they want to do.

1355
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,440
To represent particular brands and stuff like that.

1356
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,660
Like you don't have to worry about anything.

1357
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,580
You get a sponsor.

1358
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,000
You will just be pleasantly surprised.

1359
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:32,920
Like...

1360
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,960
Now things to be aware of.

1361
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,340
Number one.

1362
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,020
You are like I don't know.

1363
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,760
Things that you need to be aware of.

1364
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,620
Because if these things are not Gucci with you.

1365
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,640
Then you are going to have a rough time.

1366
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,020
Like...

1367
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,120
So...

1368
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,000
So...

1369
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,520
If you are not cool with any of these things.

1370
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:02,900
Then you are going to have a rough time.

1371
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,680
You are going to have a really rough time.

1372
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,700
So one of them is...

1373
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,560
Permissions.

1374
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:17,980
Obviously...

1375
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,360
When you are in a company.

1376
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,960
It doesn't even matter.

1377
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,760
Even if you are in any company.

1378
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,920
Even if you are like in any company.

1379
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,300
This is like one of the things you have to worry about the most.

1380
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,940
Because like...

1381
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,900
Because you are not cool with anything.

1382
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,000
You are not really safe.

1383
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,040
Because they see you as a corporate.

1384
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,380
So you are not really safe in general.

1385
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:44,780
Umm...

1386
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,000
And...

1387
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,360
And there are more...

1388
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,860
Yeah companies are more...

1389
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,620
More like looked at.

1390
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,060
Regarding perms.

1391
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,220
It doesn't matter what country you are in.

1392
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,340
It really...

1393
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,160
If you want to be really smart about it.

1394
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,080
If you are from NA.

1395
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,080
You can play NA games.

1396
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,880
But when you start playing games.

1397
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,480
Or like you try to do stuff outside of NA.

1398
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,620
That's when things get messy.

1399
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,240
You might have fair use laws.

1400
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,640
But you are part of...

1401
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,540
But even then that's not really going to protect you.

1402
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,900
Umm...

1403
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,780
When you are playing things or doing things.

1404
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,700
And the country of origin is not America.

1405
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,560
Or Canada.

1406
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,080
Or just not NA.

1407
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,520
So...

1408
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,700
Like I said.

1409
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,480
You need permission for things.

1410
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,860
Music, games and others.

1411
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,020
What do you mean by others?

1412
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,700
Graphics, pictures, images, videos.

1413
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,920
Everything.

1414
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,200
If you think showing pictures of something.

1415
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,440
If you guys didn't know.

1416
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,200
Umm...

1417
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,560
So there is like a lot of like many things.

1418
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,240
That a lot of companies are like really strict about.

1419
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,620
Like one of the...

1420
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,860
Like I can give so many famous examples.

1421
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,740
But I won't.

1422
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,020
Because I don't want to get in trouble.

1423
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,080
Hahahaha.

1424
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:58,880
Hahahaha.

1425
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,420
Hahahaha.

1426
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,860
I don't...

1427
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,460
But if you look hard enough.

1428
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,360
Like you can find them.

1429
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,940
And obviously like some of the things.

1430
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,140
That obviously you should be like.

1431
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:14,720
Umm...

1432
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,420
You guys didn't know.

1433
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,760
Like you can't make like fan products of Sanrio stuff.

1434
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,180
Because they are very strict.

1435
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,440
Regarding like...

1436
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,400
Umm...

1437
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,120
Of like Sanrio things.

1438
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,940
So like stuff like this.

1439
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:29,860
Umm...

1440
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,640
You can easily get stuff taken down.

1441
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,100
If you put like I don't know.

1442
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,260
Some like Hello Kitty stuff that wasn't made by Sanrio.

1443
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,100
Like you made your own Hello Kitty product.

1444
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,300
They will try to take it down.

1445
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,480
Because like it's not made by them.

1446
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,180
And stuff like that.

1447
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,160
You have to be worried.

1448
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,600
It's not just music and games.

1449
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,140
There are so many other things to worry about.

1450
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,840
And you might not be happy that you can't get the permission that you want.

1451
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,760
For certain things.

1452
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,720
And you are very restricted on the games you can play.

1453
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,860
And like obviously music as well.

1454
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,340
So like...

1455
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:00,680
Umm...

1456
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,180
Maybe like...

1457
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:03,680
Umm...

1458
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,880
Maybe some game companies don't give you explicit permission.

1459
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,300
And stuff like that.

1460
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,800
So there are some things like this to worry about.

1461
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,900
Maybe this is like your favorite game of all time.

1462
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,100
You really want to play it.

1463
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,920
Like you really want to stream it.

1464
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,760
But you can't.

1465
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,360
And you have to be able to accept that.

1466
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,520
Someone says...

1467
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,520
Is this only for Japanese companies?

1468
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,460
No.

1469
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,640
A lot of like smaller companies...

1470
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,500
In NA have to deal with that too.

1471
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,380
Because they don't want to worry about...

1472
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,240
Like...

1473
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:35,760
Umm...

1474
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,380
Because like maybe if it's an NA game...

1475
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,920
That's fine.

1476
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,480
If it's an NA developer and publisher...

1477
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,540
Umm...

1478
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,380
Then like you know...

1479
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,400
That's fine.

1480
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,780
But if you're trying to do something that's outside of NA...

1481
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:50,980
Umm...

1482
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,840
Then it's...

1483
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,160
It's more of a risk.

1484
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,000
And obviously when I say other...

1485
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,100
Like someone said what about mods?

1486
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,720
Stuff like that.

1487
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,120
You have to get the permission from the original creator.

1488
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,660
Usually some of them would say no.

1489
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,520
Hahaha...

1490
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:05,840
Hahaha...

1491
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:09,660
So...

1492
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,640
But you have to have an explicit...

1493
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,860
Explicit permissions for stuff like that.

1494
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,460
So... Umm...

1495
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:16,560
It doesn't matter.

1496
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,840
Like mods, stuff like that.

1497
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,700
Like fan translations.

1498
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,360
Like you have to worry about things like that.

1499
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,180
Obviously like I said certain restrictions to follow.

1500
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,740
Like not only just with games and everything.

1501
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,340
It's how you handle yourself.

1502
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,380
And maybe like...

1503
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,960
You're not allowed to do certain things.

1504
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,260
Or say certain things.

1505
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,580
Because like you represent the company.

1506
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,360
And you have to be aware of what you say and how you act.

1507
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,660
Because what you do doesn't just reflect yourself.

1508
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,640
But the whole company.

1509
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,020
So you have to be aware that your stance...

1510
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,240
Reflects the company's values.

1511
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,720
Your image and beliefs are tied to the company.

1512
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,880
So like you have to be very aware.

1513
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,940
And if you join a company.

1514
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,000
You have to be very neutral in a lot of things.

1515
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,120
You cannot...

1516
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,620
It's...

1517
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,760
Because like you don't want it to hurt yourself in the long run.

1518
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,540
So you have to be incredibly neutral.

1519
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,920
You have to be sure of like when you say things.

1520
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,320
Of like I like this thing.

1521
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,020
That it's safe to say.

1522
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,140
Hahaha...

1523
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:15,860
Like...

1524
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,200
That's what you have...

1525
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,680
Because you're representing...

1526
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,140
No you're not representing yourself.

1527
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,160
It doesn't matter if that's your own opinion.

1528
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,300
You represent the company.

1529
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,640
So it doesn't matter.

1530
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,120
You have to be neutral.

1531
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,060
You're here to entertain.

1532
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,400
You're like...

1533
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,520
You have to be like incredible...

1534
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,520
You have to be safe.

1535
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,700
And everything.

1536
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,980
And even then.

1537
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,380
If you are an indie that's planning to join a company.

1538
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,000
You have to make sure.

1539
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,500
You're like...

1540
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,100
I guess like brand friendly type deal.

1541
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,400
You have to be like brand friendly.

1542
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,580
Because like...

1543
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,140
What you say on the internet is forever.

1544
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,020
It doesn't matter.

1545
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,780
If it's like oh that was before.

1546
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,120
Before then you know.

1547
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,320
What you say on the internet is forever.

1548
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,480
So you have to be sure that like you know.

1549
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,620
You're pretty much like your...

1550
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,380
Your like internet history is like...

1551
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:10,860
Okay.

1552
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,360
Hahaha...

1553
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,660
Yes the internet never forgets.

1554
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,680
Um...

1555
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,960
And then obviously another thing is...

1556
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,040
Juggling your schedule.

1557
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,680
Regarding overlaps.

1558
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,620
You don't want to over...

1559
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,600
If you're in a company.

1560
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,900
You want to be like respectful to other people's schedules.

1561
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,280
So like maybe like oh...

1562
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,860
This person is going to have a sponsor stream at that time.

1563
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,980
I don't want to overlap it.

1564
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,380
I'm going to make sure to...

1565
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,880
Rate into the sponsor stream.

1566
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,060
Because like...

1567
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,960
How well they do in sponsors might mean...

1568
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,540
Like the sponsor would want to do more with us.

1569
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,640
So stuff like that.

1570
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,580
You have to be very smart in how you arrange your schedule.

1571
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,480
And everything.

1572
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,600
So you have to be sure that like...

1573
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:55,520
Um...

1574
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,000
That you're like helping everybody.

1575
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,440
Not just yourself.

1576
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,600
You can't just focus on yourself.

1577
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,900
You have to be sure that you're helping everybody.

1578
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,620
If everybody grows...

1579
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,180
That's a good thing.

1580
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,900
You're a team player.

1581
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,360
So it's very frustrating.

1582
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,380
Especially when you're like...

1583
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,660
Oh I really want to do it at this time slot.

1584
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,940
But you have to be a team player.

1585
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,240
Because you have to make sure that everybody is like...

1586
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:19,900
Going well.

1587
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,200
So that in the long run you will go well.

1588
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,240
You will do well in the long run for everybody.

1589
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:25,900
Um...

1590
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,340
And it's all about like working together type deal.

1591
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:30,800
Um...

1592
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,260
So...

1593
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,100
And obviously like I said like percentage cuts taken.

1594
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
I think that's like very self explanatory.

1595
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,940
When you're working for a company.

1596
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,860
It doesn't necessarily mean you...

1597
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,560
Obviously like they take a percentage.

1598
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,000
So because they're like funding some things.

1599
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,120
They're helping you in some stuff.

1600
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,360
They are arranging things for you.

1601
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,220
Stuff like that.

1602
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,000
So it's obvious.

1603
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,900
So that is why people would want to join a company.

1604
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,340
And those are the pros.

1605
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,140
And like...

1606
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,120
What you have to be aware of.

1607
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,160
Of what you have to do.

1608
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,320
Um...

1609
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,600
So now you're wondering.

1610
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,240
Okay what about an indie?

1611
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,080
So as an indie.

1612
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,800
Basically it's like opposite of obviously...

1613
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,900
A lot of stuff I said regarding company.

1614
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,460
So as an indie.

1615
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,380
Um... Like I said.

1616
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,620
There's more freedom what you can do.

1617
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,680
You're an indie.

1618
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,200
There's so much more freedom.

1619
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,140
I mean...

1620
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,000
There's...

1621
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
A lot more!

1622
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:25,800
Yay!

1623
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,080
You have all the creative control.

1624
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,460
On everything you do.

1625
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,780
And how you want your channel to be.

1626
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,140
And you get to keep 100% what you make.

1627
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,920
Because you're by yourself.

1628
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,980
You're an indie.

1629
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,960
Like I think...

1630
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,620
Sorry I accidentally smacked something.

1631
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,640
So...

1632
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,400
Uh...

1633
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,400
Thank you.

1634
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,640
Take this 100%.

1635
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,340
Also I just realized I never asked you guys how the sound was.

1636
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,360
I hope the sound has been okay.

1637
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,100
So far.

1638
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,380
I hope the BGM has been like okay.

1639
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,360
It's not too loud.

1640
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,280
Um... It's a bit low.

1641
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,020
Okay that's great.

1642
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,400
That's fine.

1643
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,720
You just want to listen to my voice anyway.

1644
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,700
Why do you guys want to listen to that BGM?

1645
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,780
It's all about the information I give you.

1646
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,280
It's all about the information I give you.

1647
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,580
Uh...

1648
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,140
Okay.

1649
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,160
I boosted a little higher.

1650
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:29,960
Alright.

1651
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,460
I'll give it a little higher.

1652
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,440
Alright so...

1653
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,860
Anyway as I was saying.

1654
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,560
Um...

1655
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,600
And your networking connection stays with you.

1656
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,040
So like you don't have to like...

1657
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,560
You know...

1658
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,940
Everything... your connections and all of that directly goes to you.

1659
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,300
It's not directly from the company.

1660
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:48,840
You know?

1661
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,640
You don't have your connections from the company.

1662
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,320
You have the connections from yourself.

1663
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,560
So everything just funnels to you.

1664
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:55,860
Um...

1665
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,300
And then you get to create the merchandise you want to make.

1666
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,260
And guide the production.

1667
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,960
So like I said.

1668
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,940
The thing about being an indie is just everything is up to you.

1669
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,380
How you want to make your career.

1670
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,280
Everything.

1671
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,340
But of course with more freedom comes more risk.

1672
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,420
So...

1673
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,340
Because of that.

1674
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:19,040
You're opening yourself up legally to more like risk.

1675
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,840
That you might not be prepared of.

1676
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,000
So like...

1677
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,200
Obviously...

1678
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,540
Obviously...

1679
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,440
You see like scams.

1680
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,340
Stuff like that.

1681
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,020
And you have to like make sure.

1682
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,360
You have to have a...

1683
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,420
Depending on how big you are.

1684
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,180
As a content creator or a Vtuber.

1685
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,520
Or if you want to try and get to learn these things.

1686
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,520
Um...

1687
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,820
You will eventually have to have a business lawyer.

1688
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,720
That can help you look over contracts.

1689
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,980
Especially regarding like...

1690
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,920
You don't want to be taking advantage when it comes to like sponsors.

1691
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,920
And um...

1692
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,740
And brand deals.

1693
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,800
You don't want to accidentally take a bad sponsor.

1694
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,580
There's like liability and stuff like that.

1695
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,860
So you have to have a business lawyer.

1696
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,620
That's there to read your contracts.

1697
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,520
And um...

1698
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,100
And be able to like...

1699
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,400
Help you with stuff like this.

1700
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:07,540
So...

1701
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,540
You also have to work harder when it comes to networking and branding.

1702
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,000
Because it all comes down to you.

1703
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,880
Obviously you don't have the company brand.

1704
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,760
To like help you with...

1705
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,640
Uh...

1706
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,620
Help you with getting to know people.

1707
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,180
Or uh...

1708
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,560
With networking and branding.

1709
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:24,880
You have to build this yourself.

1710
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,160
You have to build this up all about yourself.

1711
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,920
And then you have to be smarter with this branding.

1712
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,480
In doing what is meta.

1713
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,760
Like you can't...

1714
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,920
Unless you want to be niche.

1715
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,120
But niche is also harder.

1716
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,180
Variety is an easier route.

1717
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,440
Versus niche streaming.

1718
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,740
Because niche streaming.

1719
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,720
When you're doing niche streaming.

1720
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,900
You're restricted to that certain niche.

1721
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,740
You can't really branch out.

1722
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,600
Because the moment you branch out.

1723
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,300
Your viewership.

1724
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,680
Will not follow you.

1725
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,340
It doesn't matter if you're like.

1726
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,680
No they love me.

1727
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,300
Your viewership most likely will just find another streamer.

1728
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,280
That might be streaming that particular niche.

1729
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,860
So you don't want to cater.

1730
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,860
It's better for long term streaming.

1731
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,280
To be a variety streamer.

1732
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,960
Because when that niche dies.

1733
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,940
You are in trouble.

1734
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,800
You have to really like figure out what to do.

1735
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:21,980
Um...

1736
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,540
Or you cater a very far niche.

1737
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,900
To a very fucking dedicated fan base.

1738
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,200
But that in itself.

1739
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,480
Is also very difficult.

1740
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,840
So like someone said.

1741
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,120
If you only stream that one thing.

1742
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,440
Those viewers will only show up.

1743
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,400
For that one thing.

1744
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,820
So you have to.

1745
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,380
Long term wise.

1746
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,460
Variety is better for you long term.

1747
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,300
Even though it's harder to get started.

1748
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,740
Variety is better to have.

1749
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,640
Versus like being a niche streamer.

1750
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,460
Um...

1751
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,760
And...

1752
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,400
When you are in a company.

1753
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,180
You can go niche easier.

1754
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:00,740
Um...

1755
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,040
But because you are under the company brand.

1756
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,480
So like there are viewers that would be like.

1757
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,840
Oh I love just watching people in this company.

1758
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,360
So like it doesn't.

1759
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,540
It's like it doesn't matter for you.

1760
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,100
If you are a niche in a company.

1761
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,580
But when you are a niche as an indie.

1762
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,580
It affects a lot more.

1763
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,180
Um...

1764
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,120
Uh...

1765
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,680
Thank you.

1766
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:21,860
Thank you.

1767
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,520
Thank you.

1768
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,400
As an indie.

1769
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,260
Is this still a good idea?

1770
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,820
Do you get perms for games, covers, etc.

1771
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,380
Or is it unnecessary as an indie?

1772
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,120
If you are doing reaction content.

1773
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,600
I would highly suggest.

1774
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,020
Don't risk it.

1775
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,100
On your channel.

1776
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1777
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1778
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,520
Or put it on Twitch.

1779
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,220
If you want to do reaction content.

1780
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,500
Just do it on Twitch.

1781
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,900
And then like.

1782
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,900
And that way.

1783
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,920
And then like edit it in a way that has.

1784
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,240
That benefits fair use.

1785
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,700
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1786
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,100
Like.

1787
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,380
I would say that.

1788
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,080
If it benefits.

1789
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,320
And if you are going to react to something.

1790
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,260
And you think you can upload it on your channel.

1791
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,380
Make sure the thing you are reacting to.

1792
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,840
Is something within NA.

1793
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,640
And not like outside of NA.

1794
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,940
Because then if it's outside of NA.

1795
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,380
It's harder.

1796
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,920
Because you know.

1797
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,440
Some countries might not have fair use laws.

1798
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,840
Or you pay the creator.

1799
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,720
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1800
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,560
Regarding games.

1801
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,340
Music.

1802
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,600
Covers.

1803
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,080
I would say.

1804
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,520
Cover songs.

1805
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,700
Um.

1806
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,960
Look up.

1807
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,080
Song permissions.

1808
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,260
If you are doing Japanese covers.

1809
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,800
Look up song perms.

1810
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,540
For like Japanese songs.

1811
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,980
Because like.

1812
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,260
They have the right.

1813
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,540
To take down your song.

1814
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,800
If you don't have proper permissions.

1815
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,500
Um.

1816
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,440
And if you are doing like.

1817
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,260
Maybe if.

1818
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,140
And then also like English songs.

1819
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,080
They might get copyright claimed.

1820
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:58,940
But like.

1821
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,460
Or like.

1822
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,020
But it doesn't affect your channel.

1823
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,080
Stuff like that.

1824
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,000
They will just take the revenue.

1825
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,340
If you are okay with your music.

1826
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,060
Having your revenue taken.

1827
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:08,800
Um.

1828
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,280
Then that's fine.

1829
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,480
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1830
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,720
Ha ha ha ha.

1831
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:15,700
That's.

1832
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,460
That's.

1833
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,200
It's okay.

1834
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,520
Because the most common factor.

1835
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
For like English songs.

1836
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,200
Is mostly like.

1837
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:26,000
They just give you like a copyright claim.

1838
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,320
Where they just take your revenue.

1839
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,580
And unless you are just there to like have views.

1840
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,480
That's okay.

1841
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,080
But if you actually want money from doing cover songs.

1842
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,080
Um.

1843
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,020
Then you have to make sure.

1844
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,500
That like that particular song you are covering.

1845
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,520
Um.

1846
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,860
Is okay.

1847
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,220
Perms wise.

1848
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,700
That you won't get claimed.

1849
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,260
Ha ha ha ha.

1850
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:53,820
Um.

1851
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:54,980
What else?

1852
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:55,960
Uh.

1853
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:56,840
But yeah.

1854
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,200
As I said.

1855
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,240
You have to follow it's meta.

1856
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,840
So fear of missing out games.

1857
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,860
So you saw me like a difficult.

1858
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:02,860
What was it?

1859
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,000
Supermarket simulator.

1860
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,180

1863
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,360
Um.

01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,200
Stuff like that.

1865
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,760
You have to be on it.

1866
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,440
The moment you realize.

1867
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,340
It is the streaming.

1868
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,240
Streaming game.

1869
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,720
You have to be on that shit.

1870
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,280

1873
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:23,400
That's it.

1874
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,200
Because people want to watch those games.

1875
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,380
And that's really.

1876
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,780
You have to flavor up that week.

1877
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,080
So you have to make sure you play it.

1878
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,420

01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,980
Ha ha ha ha.

1882
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,780
And how do I figure out.

1883
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,360
What's flavor of the month streams?

1884
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,160
You literally look at the biggest streamers.

1886
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,100

01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,700
And they are on that shit.

1888
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,280
The moment it releases.

1889
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,200
How.

1890
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,600
What's an easier way.

1891
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,060
If you don't know which streamer to watch.

1892
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,160
Go on Twitch.

1893
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,880

01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,440

01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:03,940
Supermarket simulator.

1897
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,660

01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:13,780

1906
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,040
Wow.

If people really enjoy it.

If a lot of people are watching it.

1912
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,380
Clearly it's a very entertaining game.

1913

And there's some games.

1914
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,360
That doesn't matter.

There's some games.

1916
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,420
Like elder wilds.

1917
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,860
I highly recommend streaming games such as.

1918
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,340
Elder wilds.

1919
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,140
Because those games are like.

1920
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,960
Games that have discord servers.

1921
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,240
Dedicated to it.

1922
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,560

Elder wilds is one of those games.

1932
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,740
Where there's a discord server.

1933
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,060
Dedicated to like finding streamers.

1934
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,860
That are streaming elder wilds.

1935
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,500
Because they want to chase the high.

1936
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,120
That elder wilds gave them.

1937
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,960
Ha ha ha ha.

1938
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,980
Because they want to live vicariously.

1939
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,540
Through the streamer.

1940
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,920
Streaming elder wilds.

1941
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,640
So like.

1942
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,660
Souls games and elder wilds.

Are some of these games.

1944
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,180
Or undertale too.

1945
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,460
Souls games, undertale and elder wilds.

1946
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,380
Are one of these games.

1947
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,860
That are really well known streamer games.

1948
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,460
Because there are servers dedicated to finding other streamers.

1949
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,160

01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,740

01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,600
Through that game.

Ha ha ha ha.

1953
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,220
So if you're starting out.

1954
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,180
These are like some of the fucking.

1955
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,900
They're the reason why.

1956
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,220
They're called stream games.

1957
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,000
They're the reason why they're called the streamer meta.

1958
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,080
Or the stream games.

1959
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,820
And every fucking streamer.

1960
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,240
Doesn't matter what streamer you are.

1961
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,900
It doesn't matter if you're a vtuber.

1962
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,480
Or a fleshtuber.

1963
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,720
Or whatever content creator you are.

1964
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,180
They love that shit.

1965
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,800
Ha ha ha ha.

1966
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,500
And also gotcha game.

1967
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,100
But like if you're starting out.

1968
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,060
I don't know.

1969
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,660
I feel like you should invest your money.

1970
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,140
Unless you want to be a gotcha streamer.

1971
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:08,960
But like.

1972
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,520
And you think you're gonna have your investment pay off later.

1973
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,360
Or you're really fucking passionate about gotcha.

1974
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,720
But if you're starting out.

1975
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,580
A lot of your money is gonna be spent on reinvesting in your channel.

1976
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:19,320
Um.

1977
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,320
So like that's why I was like avoiding gotcha.

1978
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,000
Because like.

1979
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:22,640
Um.

1980
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,940
Because you're investing on the gotcha instead of the channel.

1981
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:25,600
So.

1982
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,080
But if you're really passionate about gotcha.

1983
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,180
Then feel free to do gotcha.

1984
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,880
Like I'm not gonna restrict you.

1985
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,340
Ha ha ha ha.

1986
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,020
Ha ha ha ha.

1987
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:36,760
Anyway.

1988
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,080
So by the way.

1989
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,560
I have like 17 slides.

1990
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,620
And I realized we're...

1991
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,480
Some of them are like really fast.

1992
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,740
I think these two were like my longest slides.

1993
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,220
But I hope it's been like informative.

1994
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,320
So far.

1995
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,820
I hope this has been like informative.

1996
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:54,940
For you guys.

1997
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,400
And like good advice.

1998
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,520
Alright.

1999
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,180
Okay.

2000
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:02,660
Auditioning.

2001
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,080
Obviously I won't be giving out audition secrets.

2002
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,140
Um.

2003
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,360
But like I've talked about this before.

2004
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:09,260
Um.

2005
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,520
If you guys look hard enough you guys can find an archive.

2006
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,540
But like.

2007
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,580
When I got to.

2008
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,480
When I passed the first round.

2009
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,840
I researched a lot.

2010
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,220
And I had a 10 page document.

2011
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,320
Um.

2012
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,000
Going into round 2.

2013
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,800
I um.

2014
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:27,900
I went.

2015
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:30,960
I was like submitting a video audition.

2016
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,560
Of like stuff like that.

2017
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,920
And then when I realized my video audition passed.

2018
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,080
I made a 10 page document.

2019
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,120
Detailing like.

2020
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,340
Everything about.

2021
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,760
Preparing myself.

2022
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,840
To the next round.

2023
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,480
And I was very.

2024
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,300
I like worked very hard on that.

2025
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,720
And all in there was like research and stuff like that.

2026
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:52,280
Um.

2027
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,180
Obviously I can't give out my document.

2028
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,680
But I can give you advice on how to look research.

2029
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,620
Similar ways.

2030
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,160
Um.

2031
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,700
There's lots of resources out there.

2032
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,000
From members within companies.

2033
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,580
That reveal very crucial.

2034
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,600
Audition advice.

01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,660
And insight.

2036
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,920
Onto the interviews.

2037
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:14,480
And the audition tapes.

2038
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:15,580
Like.

2039
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,620
If you look hard enough.

2040
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,100
You can actually find members.

2041
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,740
Not just like.

That talk about.

2044
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,680
Specific info.

2045
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,720
Regarding the audition stage.

2046
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,500
I personally looked at.

2047
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,600
Twitter and YouTube.

2048
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,940
In different languages.

2049
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,680
To find audition interview questions.

2050
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,080
So like.

2051
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,080
I highly recommend.

2052
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:42,860
You guys.

2053
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,940
If you want to audition.

2054
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,880
And a lot of times.

2055
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,760
I would believe the audition questions.

2056
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,680
Would be like super similar.

2057
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,360
Like because it's like.

2058
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,260
How many different types of questions.

2059
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,440
Can you ask about Vtubing.

2060
01:06:59,340 --> 01:06:59,900
So.

2061
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,780
It doesn't matter.

2062
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:02,560
So like.

2063
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,080
It's like stuff like that.

2064
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:04,700
And then.

2065
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,080
When you're doing your application.

2066
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,840
You have to find.

2067
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,300
Your niche.

2068
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,840
And main character type.

2069
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,060
That you want to play.

2070
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,400
Because they're trying to find a character for you.

2071
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,320
They're trying to.

2072
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,600
They're trying to figure out like.

2073
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,600
What will you bring.

2074
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:24,100
Will you have.

2075
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,120
Will you be the same personality.

2076
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,960
That they have.

2077
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,100
Like they already have.

2078
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,060
Or will you be a new personality.

2079
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,700
Or will you be a personality that has.

2080
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,360
That is similar to like one of their popular talents.

2081
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,180
And they want to try and.

2082
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:38,900
Like you know.

2083
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,720
Have another talent that is just as popular.

2084
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:42,760
Stuff like that.

2085
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:45,980
So you gotta figure out what you're bringing.

2086
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,220
And like how to market yourself type deal.

2087
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,680
And um.

2088
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,680
You just have to figure out like.

2089
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,360
What you're bringing to the table.

2090
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,320
And we have to know.

2091
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,600
That like there's more competition now.

2092
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,100
Because VTubing is.

2093
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,200
Still is growing.

2094
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,960
And like there's a lot of people that want to be.

2095
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,760
Want this to be their big break.

2096
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,040
A lot of like hidden gems.

2097
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,580
That want this to be like.

2098
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:10,700
Uhhhh.

2099
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:12,500
Uhhhh.

2100
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,760
Just want this to be like.

2101
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,300
The thing that you know.

2102
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,700
That's gonna like.

2103
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,580
Make them famous.

2104
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,340
So there's more competition now.

2105
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:24,560
And like.

2106
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,180
What I submitted.

2107
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,460
Back then as a video audition.

2108
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,200
Might not have fucking worked.

2109
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,240
Later on if I try it.

2110
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,720
Like try it now.

2111
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,180
Like it will not.

2112
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,920
I personally think it will not work.

2113
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,400
So like obviously the quality wise.

2114
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,800
Might be a lot higher.

2115
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,700
Depending on what type of company.

2116
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,820
You want to apply for.

2117
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,800
It's definitely must have changed.

2118
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,220
I would assume it has changed.

2119
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,200
Because the market is bigger now.

2120
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,100
And the competition is a lot higher.

2121
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,620
And if you really really really want to be.

2122
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,420
In a.

2123
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,060
No matter what company.

2124
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,540
You want to be a company Vtuber.

2125
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,300
Don't be afraid.

2126
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,680
Of applying over and over.

2127
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,160
And over and over again.

2128
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,000
Until you make it in.

2129
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,760
Like if you like.

2130
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,180
Getting ghosted.

2131
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,080
Not ghosted.

2132
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,460
But like usually if you are rejected.

2133
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,460
On the first round.

2134
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,580
You wouldn't even get an email.

2135
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,780
So like there is like guidelines being like.

2136
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,060
If we don't reply back.

2137
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,420
Within x amount of months.

2138
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:36,360
Try again.

2139
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,560
Just try again.

2140
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,300
Just keep submitting.

2141
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,200
A lot of people would be like I just kept submitting.

2142
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:40,900
Until it worked.

2143
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,160
And like at that point.

2144
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,680
If you really want to join, just keep submitting.

2145
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:47,600
But also, don't slack off on streaming as an indie.

2146
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,080
Just keep going as an indie.

2147
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,440
Keep going as an indie and keep submitting.

2148
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:53,540
That's really it.

2149
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,080
So you just have to keep taking your shots.

2150
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,900
And that is really auditioning.

2151
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,000
Equipment!

2152
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:01,800
Alright!

2153
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,360
Number one!

2154
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:04,480
Audio!

2155
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,460
Audio is so fucking important!

2156
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,900
I will not watch a stream if I hear shitty audio quality.

2157
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,040
That is like 100% for me.

2158
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:15,960
This is my opinion.

2159
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,460
But like, I will turn off a stream if the audio is this fucking shit.

2160
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,740
That shit is so important.

2161
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:27,420
Audio...

2162
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,760
That fucking shit is so important.

2163
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,980
So remember...

2164
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,020
To have good audio.

2165
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,440
Like, if the first thing you're gonna do...

2166
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,180
Is invest...

2167
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:39,380
Please invest in a microphone.

2168
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,380
A good quality mic.

2169
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,000
And...

2170
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,880
It is...

2171
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:45,720
Very, very...

2172
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:46,000
Okay.

2173
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,840
I started out with a cheap $1 mic.

2174
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,100
Because...

2175
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,180
I didn't care.

2176
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,840
This mic I bought when I used to live in Asia.

2177
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,100
So like...

2178
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,520
I was like...

2179
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,680
I just wanted a mic to communicate with my teammates.

2180
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,920
It wasn't about streaming.

2181
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,900
Which I later used for streaming.

2182
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:05,980
Um...

2183
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:07,700
I was like streaming like Overwatch.

2184
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:08,920
So like...

2185
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,500
It didn't really matter that much.

2186
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,640
Um...

2187
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,120
For me.

2188
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,720
So like later on...

2189
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,520
When I got a little bit more serious...

2190
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,680
I upgraded to a Blue Yeti.

2191
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,340
Because Blue Yeti at that time...

2192
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,220
Was like a...

2193
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:21,900
A...

2194
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:22,760
Budget...

2195
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,260
I guess you can say budget.

2196
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,460
But it's still pretty expensive.

2197
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,020
When you're starting out.

2198
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,140
Like I know it says budget.

2199
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:33,320
But like...

2200
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,560
Um...

2201
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,520
It's still like...

2202
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,420
A pricey microphone.

2203
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,160
Um...

2204
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,400
And...

2205
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:39,660
Uh...

2206
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:40,600
It's...

2207
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,200
Uh...

2208
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,740
It's actually like a good starting out mic.

2209
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:44,840
Uh...

2210
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,980
If you want to...

2211
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,020
Earn the snowball.

2212
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,760
Honestly like Yeti products.

2213
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,580
But I went with Blue Yeti.

2214
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,360
Uh...

2215
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,200
But obviously a cheaper alternative will be the snowball.

2216
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:55,720
Um...

2217
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,500
But yes.

2218
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,680
When I started getting more serious later on.

2219
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,200
But yes.

2220
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,400
If you want to be a VTuber.

2221
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:02,300
It's a huge investment.

2222
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,600
Similar with flesh tubing.

2223
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,580
You have to have like...

2224
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:04,960
You know...

2225
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:05,500
Like the cap.

2226
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,300
Like the camera and stuff like that.

2227
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,260
It's a huge investment.

2228
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,920
And obviously like...

2229
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,500
Uh...

2230
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,640
You have to be willing to...

2231
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,360
Put money onto this.

2232
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,620
Doesn't matter.

2233
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:17,320
Skin suit.

2234
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:17,900
Rigging.

2235
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,680
All that stuff.

2236
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,660
You have to be willing to invest.

2237
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,120
In all of these things.

2238
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:22,820
Not all of these.

2239
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:23,440
But like...

2240
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,120
If you want to like have a career.

2241
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,020
You have to be able to invest in this.

2242
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:28,340
Um...

2243
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:29,740
Anyway.

2244
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:30,780
Anyway.

2245
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:31,660
As I said.

2246
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:32,260
Audio.

2247
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,880
If you're investing in anything.

2248
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,360
If you don't want to invest too much.

2249
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,700
At least invest in better audio.

2250
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:38,760
Um...

2251
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,480
Like I said.

2252
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:40,240
Get a mixer.

2253
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,140
I have an old GoXLR.

2254
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,360
But that is baby mixer.

2255
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,800
Because I'm stupid.

2256
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,580
If you talk to audio people.

2257
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,980
They will be like.

2258
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,860
Oh don't get the GoXLR.

2259
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:00,860
You know about mixing.

2260
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,560
But I am stupid.

2261
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,460
And GoXLR.

2262
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,980
Is like baby's first mixer.

2263
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,480
And it's for like stupid people.

2264
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:09,920
Like me.

2265
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,660
Because it's like very...

2266
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,660
What's the word?

2267
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,300
It's very...

2268
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,140
It's like very intuitive.

2269
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,640
It's very direct.

2270
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,400
If you know how to use audio.

2271
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,720
I would suggest asking.

2272
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,500
Your audio friends.

2273
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,800
Like people who are in music.

2274
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,200
To recommend you.

2275
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,940
Better mixers.

2276
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,420
And what are mixers?

2277
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,880
Mixers make sure you don't fucking peak when you're talking.

2278
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,080
So when you're laughing.

2279
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:39,800
When you're screaming.

2280
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:40,720
Stuff like that.

2281
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:41,740
Mixing...

2282
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,780
Mixers is a way to make sure your audio doesn't peak.

2283
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,620
It's nice.

2284
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:47,560
Um...

2285
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,500
When you're whispering.

2286
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,620
It's not fucking terrible.

2287
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,980
You can mute stuff.

2288
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:53,720
But you have to.

2289
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,580
Like you can mute audio.

2290
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,360
So that people can't hear.

2291
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,240
But you can hear.

2292
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,060
Stuff like that.

2293
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,760
So like that's what you can control.

2294
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:02,120
Your collab partners.

2295
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,120
And stuff.

2296
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,120
You can control your collab partners audio.

2297
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,860
But that's why I go with the GoXLR.

2298
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,700
It's very intuitive.

2299
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,300
And very like...

2300
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,620
Also there's sound effects.

2301
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,280
Stuff like that.

2302
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,880
But that doesn't really matter to me.

2303
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:15,820
All I...

2304
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:18,700
I use the GoXLR to help me with like...

2305
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,220
Making sure for collabs.

2306
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,240
And making sure I don't peak.

2307
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,020
When I...

2308
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:26,560
When I like talk too loud.

2309
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,860
Or if I scream.

2310
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:28,860
Stuff like that.

2311
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,100
It just...

2312
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,000
It helps a lot.

2313
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,700
It normalizes your audio.

2314
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,300
Audio balancing is so fucking important.

2315
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,120
Audio...

2316
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,420
You can use OBS audio filters.

2317
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,800
But it's not as good as a mixer.

2318
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,100
It's not...

2319
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,120
It's not as good.

2320
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:49,940
But like I said.

2321
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,380
GoXLR is baby's first mixer.

2322
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,820
And like all the audio people would fucking judge you for using a GoXLR.

2323
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,280
But you're stupid like me.

2324
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,600
That is all you need.

2325
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,200
Like...

2326
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,160
I do not have the brain capacity.

2327
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,580
To fucking research stuff like this.

2328
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:08,100
Or be able to use an actual real mixer correctly.

2329
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,180
Like...

2330
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,200
If you look at what real mixers look like.

2331
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,160
They look so fucking complicated.

2332
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,740
That I can't be bothered.

2333
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:22,400
So...

2334
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,260
So...

2335
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,120
Obviously other mixers are cheaper.

2336
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,100
Like the actual real ones.

2337
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,140
Uh...

2338
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:29,960
Hahaha...

2339
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,380
Hahaha...

2340
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:32,820
But...

2341
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,960
But GoXLR is so good for babies like me.

2342
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,580
There's just too many buttons.

2343
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,840
I can't.

2344
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,100
I can't handle it.

2345
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,740
There's so many buttons and sliders.

2346
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,160
What the fuck does...

2347
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:48,740
I don't know.

2348
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,380
I don't know.

2349
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:50,500
I'm not an audio person.

2350
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:51,320
I just stream.

2351
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:56,760
Anyway...

2352
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,260
You have to ask around.

2353
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,220
If you don't want to go with GoXLR.

2354
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,720
You have to ask around.

2355
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,120
Um...

2356
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:05,960
Anyway...

2357
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:06,840
So like I was saying.

2358
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:07,820
Uh...

2359
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,880
The reason why audio balancing is so important.

2360
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,060
Is that...

2361
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:12,820
When you are in a collab.

2362
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,660
A lot of times.

2363
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:15,940
Not a lot of times.

2364
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:16,940
But there are some viewers.

2365
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,740
That will only watch the streamer.

2366
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,140
That has the best audio balance.

2367
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:23,620
So...

2368
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,760
You might not be...

2369
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,060
You know...

2370
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:25,820
They're like...

2371
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,100
Oh hey I want to hear everybody.

2372
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:27,960
You know?

2373
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,040
I want to hear everybody.

2374
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,580
I want to know what everybody is saying.

2375
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,080
I want to know what everybody is talking about.

2376
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,720
So they want to have...

2377
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:34,520
Want to go to a stream.

2378
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,020
That has the best audio balancing.

2379
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,940
And they'll look at all the other streams in the collab.

2380
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:38,600
And be like...

2381
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,300
Oh this stream has the best audio balancing.

2382
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,340
I'm going to watch this stream.

2383
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,180
So I can...

2384
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:43,780
Um...

2385
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,300
So I can figure out...

2386
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,160
Um...

2387
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,160
Like...

2388
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,120
I can hear everything.

2389
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:48,860
And stuff.

2390
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,800
So that is why audio balancing is very important.

2391
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,460
And I have an audio guy.

2392
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,360
I have an audio person.

2393
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,540
That...

2394
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:56,160
Um...

2395
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,140
I have a person.

2396
01:16:58,620 --> 01:16:59,020
That...

2397
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,060
That watches my streams.

2398
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,380
To make sure my...

2399
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,860
My audio balancing is good.

2400
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,220
I personally have a person that looks at that.

2401
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,980
And they are also like...

2402
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,200
They are an audio person as well.

2403
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,820
They like work on music and stuff.

2404
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,700
So I personally have a music person.

2405
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,640
To make sure everybody is balanced.

2406
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,680
My sound guy.

2407
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:16,580
Um...

2408
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,520
And that's why I'll be like...

2409
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:17,980
Sound guy!

2410
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,520
I will sometimes look at Discord.

2411
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,960
Because I will have them on Discord.

2412
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:21,760
And they'll be like...

2413
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,560
Is the audio good?

2414
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:23,620
And stuff like that.

2415
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,180
So...

2416
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:24,860
Um...

2417
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:26,100
That's what my sound guy does.

2418
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,240
Because I want to make sure that everything is okay.

2419
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,240
And that is very important.

2420
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:30,960
Like I said.

2421
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,100
There's viewers that will only watch a collab stream.

2422
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,940
With a person that has the best audio balancing.

2423
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,380
Um...

2424
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:41,300
And it's all about maximizing the comfort of the viewer.

2425
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:42,800
So you know.

2426
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,320
You can ask your friend to be like...

2427
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,180
Hey can you check my stream?

2428
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,120
If you don't...

2429
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:46,480
If you don't...

2430
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,700
You don't have like a person really to like...

2431
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,080
Really check on your audio.

2432
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,000
You can ask your friend.

2433
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:51,440
Like...

2434
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,020
Don't ask chat.

2435
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:57,360
Because chat is not a hive mind.

2436
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,280
Hahaha!

2437
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,900
You can be like...

2438
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,640
Hey chat.

2439
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,980
How's the audio?

2440
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,960
Never fully trust chat.

2441
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,680
Because chat is not a hive mind.

2442
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,220
And it really depends on the headphones.

2443
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,000
On whether or not like the audio is good.

2444
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,440
Some people say yes.

2445
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,120
Some people say no.

2446
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,260
And then you don't know who to listen to.

2447
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,940
Find one person you trust.

2448
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:23,820
Very much.

2449
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,340
To not...

2450
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,820
To monitor your audio.

2451
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,000
And then just monitor your audio.

2452
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,980
For the first like one minute.

2453
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,720
To make sure everything is good.

2454
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,180
And then...

2455
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,460
At that point.

2456
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,620
Then you can...

2457
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:37,540
They don't have to be there.

2458
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,080
Hahaha!

2459
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:38,820
They can be...

2460
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,700
If they want to.

2461
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,380
They can be there.

2462
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,220
But like...

2463
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:42,340
If you're asking a friend.

2464
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:43,580
You don't want to force them.

2465
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:46,520
I can literally see my baby go XLR.

2466
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,840
Tell me that I'm not muted.

2467
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,400
This is why you get a mixer too.

2468
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:50,080
So...

2469
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,320
So people can troll you.

2470
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,160
Hahaha!

2471
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:57,460
Also TV.

2472
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,980
Thank you for the five gift of chips.

2473
01:18:59,100 --> 01:18:59,440
Thank you.

2474
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,060
Thank you.

2475
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:00,500
Hahaha!

2476
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,240
So...

2477
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:09,660
So having a sound person dedicated to monitoring your balance is like really helpful.

2478
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,400
Especially long term.

2479
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:12,460
Um...

2480
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,320
Because like I said it really affects it.

2481
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:14,760
Anyway...

2482
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,900
So I gave you guys my timeline of like what the microphones I use.

2483
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,300
So I use a cheap one dollar mic.

2484
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,280
Then I evolved to a blue yeti.

2485
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,960
And then I used an AT2020.

2486
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,000
And then I moved on to the Shure SM7B.

2487
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,000
The Shure SM7B is my current microphone.

2488
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,720
That I use at the moment.

2489
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:35,100
I'm planning on maybe in the future to upgrade my microphone again.

2490
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:40,940
But only more so of like whenever I get my PC upgraded.

2491
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:41,900
Um...

2492
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,760
I will upgrade my microphone as well.

2493
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:47,600
So for now I'm keeping my Shure mic at the moment.

2494
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,940
But this is like my timeline of everything.

2495
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,160
Um...

2496
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,340
If you are a singer.

2497
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,040
If you want to get started into singing.

2498
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,600
These are not singing microphones.

2499
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:58,800
Hahaha!

2500
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,340
I need you guys to know this.

2501
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,780
These are not singing microphones.

2502
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,640
These are podcast microphones.

2503
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,880
So if you want to sing.

2504
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,000
I would suggest asking your fellow friends who are singers.

2505
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,460
Or research singing microphones.

2506
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,220
Because there is like...

2507
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:20,080
Singing microphones are way different.

2508
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:20,980
Hahaha!

2509
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,360
I would highly suggest not singing with these microphones.

2510
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,020
Hahaha!

2511
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:28,480
Hahaha!

2512
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,960
You need a different mic.

2513
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,160
I personally don't remember what mics you need.

2514
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,440
Because when I sing.

2515
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,960
When I record things.

2516
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,680
I just go to a studio.

2517
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,180
Or I just like...

2518
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,560
Or I sing with my Shure microphone.

2519
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,560
Because I don't care.

2520
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:49,840
Hahaha!

2521
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:55,180
It's the studio or my Shure microphone.

2522
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,500
Because I'm not a singer.

2523
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,600
So like...

2524
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,120
I don't care as much.

2525
01:20:59,320 --> 01:20:59,880
Hahaha!

2526
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:00,980
Hahaha!

2527
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,800
But if you're serious.

2528
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,200
Get an actual singing mic.

2529
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,440
And...

2530
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,480
And like research on that.

2531
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,400
I can't give you the research for that.

2532
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,140
Because I don't know.

2533
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,280
Hahaha!

2534
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:14,800
Hahaha!

2535
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,600
That's really...

2536
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,200
Really I can say about like microphones.

2537
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,800
Everything else in my opinion.

2538
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,020
Is just a bonus.

2539
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:23,840
Everything else.

2540
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,860
Like as long as you have good...

2541
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,000
Like when you're starting out.

2542
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:27,580
I don't care.

2543
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,420
I think all the other stuff.

2544
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,160
You can just invest in the future.

2545
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,240
When you have the money.

2546
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,440
But if you want to start your career.

2547
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,260
I would...

2548
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,620
The main thing you focus on investment wise.

2549
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,580
Is the audio.

2550
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,180
Everything else bonus.

2551
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,100
It doesn't matter.

2552
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,540
Until you get like...

2553
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,300
You actually make money.

2554
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,060
Hahaha!

2555
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,260
Hahaha!

2556
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,360
Hahaha!

2557
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:47,640
Anyway.

2558
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:49,840
Um...

2559
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,540
For example.

2560
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,640
Like this is my other equipment.

2561
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,940
I have three monitors.

2562
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,020
It's for efficiency wise.

2563
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,000
So I can reach out on one side.

2564
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,540
I have chat on one of the monitors.

2565
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,300
My right monitor.

2566
01:21:59,400 --> 01:21:59,880
That's vertical.

2567
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:03,320
And then I have OBS and other browsers and stuff.

2568
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,620
On my left.

2569
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,080
I have my main content.

2570
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:06,940
If it's a game.

2571
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,280
In the center monitor.

2572
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,920
So like the game will be in the center.

2573
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,480
And then right now.

2574
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:13,120
My...

2575
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,020
My notes is in the center.

2576
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,020
So I can read it.

2577
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:16,580
And everything.

2578
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,200
So um...

2579
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,100
So that is like why I have three microphones.

2580
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,600
If you want to get an iPhone.

2581
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,020
I would highly suggest an iPhone X.

2582
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:26,500
Or higher.

2583
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:26,980
Or higher.

2584
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,020
Because that is the best for facial tracking.

2585
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:34,180
Due to the inbuilt facial tracking.

2586
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,440
When it comes to VTubing.

2587
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,300
So I would highly suggest.

2588
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,780
If you want really good.

2589
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:40,880
Like really good skin suits.

2590
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,240
An iPhone X or higher.

2591
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:44,660
Um...

2592
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:46,600
Obviously.

2593
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,840
Take a PC or dual PC setup.

2594
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,140
A dual PC setup means you don't have to have incredible parts.

2595
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,080
Like you don't have to have like...

2596
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:54,940
Oh sorry.

2597
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:55,740
I mean three monitors.

2598
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,760
I don't know what I said.

2599
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,320
But I meant three monitors.

2600
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,400
I meant three...

2601
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:00,680
I don't know.

2602
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:01,440
Did I say three PCs?

2603
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,160
I meant three monitors.

2604
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,800
You can either have an incredibly tanky PC.

2605
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,900
Or you have a dual PC setup.

2606
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:15,320
Dual PC setup doesn't require you to have like really insane parts.

2607
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,240
Because it helps like...

2608
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,820
One PC will be used for streaming.

2609
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,580
And then the other PC will be used for games.

2610
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:22,740
Or like other stuff.

2611
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,940
So like...

2612
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:25,480
That's really it.

2613
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,520
The reason why having a good PC helps is that...

2614
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,240
VTubing apps...

2615
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,200
Take up a lot.

2616
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:32,960
Sometimes.

2617
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:34,340
And...

2618
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:35,960
Plus whatever game you're streaming.

2619
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,060
Sometimes you're like...

2620
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,220
Oh why are you lagging?

2621
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,360
Why are you losing frames?

2622
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:40,600
I stream this game.

2623
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,800
I don't have any issues with it.

2624
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,500
But we also have like...

2625
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,060
Us on the screen.

2626
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,700
So that takes up a lot of space too.

2627
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:50,500
So...

2628
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,440
That is why when you're VTubing...

2629
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,820
It requires more resources.

2630
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,380
So I highly suggest...

2631
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,240
If you're going to invest...

2632
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,160
Invest on a better PC.

2633
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,860
Or invest in a dual PC setup.

2634
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,100
And...

2635
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,400
Also a lot of the current games are...

2636
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,980
Fucking terribly optimized.

2637
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,720
Optimization is shit.

2638
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:11,620
So...

2639
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,120
So you have to worry about that too.

2640
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:17,900
So like...

2641
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:18,660
That's why like...

2642
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,740
You just had to have a better...

2643
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,840
You just had to have a better PC now.

2644
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,060
And...

2645
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,780
My headphones is the DT770 Pro.

2646
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,380
I don't know that matters.

2647
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,320
I don't know anything about headphones.

2648
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,120
I asked one sound guy about it.

2649
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,820
And then they like recommended this headphone.

2650
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,960
So then I bought it.

2651
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,820
But like I honestly have like...

2652
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:42,340
I don't know.

2653
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,200
If you can try and copy my headphones too.

2654
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:48,660
I also have fiber internet.

2655
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:50,100
Because...

2656
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:53,160
My niche in a way...

2657
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,580
I'm more variety streamer.

2658
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,580
But like I do have like a subcategory.

2659
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:58,000
Which is competitive FPS.

2660
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:02,580
By the way I'm gonna be in Twitch Rivals for Apex Legends next week.

2661
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:03,820
So...

2662
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:04,440
Great segue.

2663
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,620
But ping really matters to me.

2664
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,540
So that's why I have fiber internet.

2665
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,320
But obviously like...

2666
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,300
Really not every place has fiber internet.

2667
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,600
But yes anyway.

2668
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:21,840
Alright.

2669
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,840
So that is the equipment.

2670
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,460
I hope that is helpful.

2671
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,180
Regarding equipment wise.

2672
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,060
Alright.

2673
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,840
Twitch versus YouTube.

2674
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:34,080
Okay I know like it's like very brief.

2675
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,280
But I also have like more stuff to say about it.

2676
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:36,920
As well.

2677
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,340
So Twitch versus YouTube.

2678
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:40,860
Should you stream on Twitch?

2679
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,000
Should you do YouTube?

2680
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,260
Or should you multi stream?

2681
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:44,500
Um...

2682
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,000
The thing...

2683
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,540
Okay so I am primarily on YouTube.

2684
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,140
It's because I'm used to it.

2685
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:50,840
Um...

2686
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,780
I also...

2687
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,820
I like having set up.

2688
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:54,780
Schedules.

2689
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:55,720
Um...

2690
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,240
I don't like streaming whatever I want.

2691
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,000
Because uh...

2692
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,060
I'm super fucking indecisive.

2693
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,920
I like knowing what I'm doing.

2694
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,880
I used to not.

2695
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,900
But then now I'm like...

2696
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,860
I like knowing what I'm going to do.

2697
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,040
Um...

2698
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,960
So like...

2699
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,460
Because it helps me plan my day and time.

2700
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,040
Uh...

2701
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:17,820
Anyway.

2702
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:18,580
Like I said.

2703
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,260
For Twitch.

2704
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,800
The biggest benefits of Twitch is the rating system.

2705
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,170
Uh...

2706
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,680
Which benefits you.

2707
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:28,680
Because if you're starting out.

2708
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:33,640
Rates help so much with growing your presence and channel.

2709
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,280
So YouTube has raids.

2710
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,700
But like it's not as utilized as Twitch.

2711
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,220
Because it's harder to find people to raid.

2712
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,820
Because like the YouTube rating system is...

2713
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,620
Uh...

2714
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:52,980
Is like not as useful.

2715
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:53,580
Uh...

2716
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,320
Usable, I guess, in a way.

2717
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,760
It's like...

2718
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:01,720
It benefits companies more than it benefits individuals for YouTube.

2719
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,800
But on Twitch, it benefits, you know, everybody.

2720
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,580
Like, individuals.

2721
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:13,220
Like, if you're an indie, Twitch rating benefits more so than YouTube rating.

2722
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:18,080
Because, like, there's not a lot of YouTubers on YouTube as an indie.

2723
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:24,020
And it's harder for discoverability on YouTube versus Twitch.

2724
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:33,700
The thing about Twitch is that there is, like, an option to look for, like, lower viewed streamers on Twitch to find raids.

2725
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,800
Like, there are moments when, like, you know, bigger content creators on Twitch will go to a category.

2726
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:45,040
The thing about YouTube, you can't go to a category and, you know, find people you want to raid.

2727
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,060
And also, like, not everybody...

2728
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,160
Not everybody has the option on.

2729
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:55,020
If you guys don't know, if you're starting out on YouTube, the rating is off automatically.

2730
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:58,300
You have to turn it on yourself for YouTube rating.

2731
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,140
On Twitch, it's on automatically.

2732
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:06,020
So, like, on Twitch, you can, like, go to a category and be like, I want to raid somebody in this category.

2733
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,900
And then you can, you know, browse through and be like, oh, I want to raid somebody in the VTuber category.

2734
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,520
And then you'll be like, oh, this person doesn't have...

2735
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,860
Doesn't have, like, a lot of, like...

2736
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:19,820
Uh... people...

2737
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,080
Uh... you know...

2738
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:24,900
Oh, did I spell it wrong?

2739
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,520
Sorry, I can't be bothered to fix it.

2740
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:34,900
But you can go to the category and be like, oh, hey, this person doesn't have a lot of viewers.

2741
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:35,820
I'm going to raid them.

2742
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,620
There's a lot of success stories like that.

2743
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:42,300
For example, Nicewig blew up because Dizzy...

2744
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,400
And for those who don't know Apex, I'm just going to do Apex terms.

2745
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,200
Um...

2746
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:57,060
The reason why Nicewig blew up was because Dizzy was browsing through Apex Twitch streamers and found Nicewig on Twitch streaming in the Apex category.

2747
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:00,900
Dizzy at the time was the Apex streamer.

2748
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,000
Um...

2749
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,040
Was like the biggest Apex streamer at that time.

2750
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,860
And he raided Nicewig.

2751
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:13,700
And Nicewig took that big luck opportunity and rode it to where he is now.

2752
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,020
And...

2753
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:15,660
Um...

2754
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,000
And it's stuff like that.

2755
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:23,640
Like now, Nicewig is like one of like the biggest known Apex streamer out there.

2756
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:26,640
He is like the official B caster for ALGS.

2757
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,760
Stuff like that.

2758
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:32,120
So like that is why when you're starting out and you want to hit...

2759
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,000
The easiest way to hit your biggest break is on Twitch.

2760
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,600
Maybe later on you can move to YouTube.

2761
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,280
But I think if you're starting out...

2762
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,820
This is NA by the way.

2763
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:43,660
NA.

2764
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:44,960
If you're starting out...

2765
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,160
I don't know for other countries.

2766
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,980
But you're starting out...

2767
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:52,100
I would say Twitch is your biggest bet in terms of making it.

2768
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:56,580
On YouTube it is a lot harder for an Indie.

2769
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,920
Because there's less discoverability as a YouTuber.

2770
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:02,280
Um...

2771
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,600
As an Indie YouTuber.

2772
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,100
Um...

2773
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,780
It's a lot harder.

2774
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,180
And um...

2775
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:13,220
More so streaming is a Twitch thing for NA people.

2776
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,860
For English speaking audience.

2777
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:17,620
If you're a streamer you're on Twitch.

2778
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,280
YouTube is still trying to figure this out for NA.

2779
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:27,600
I was just lucky to be able to do YouTube.

2780
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,460
Because I already have an audience established on YouTube.

2781
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:32,880
Um...

2782
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,540
So it's a lot easier.

2783
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:36,820
Um...

2784
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:38,460
It's a lot easier to get started.

2785
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,040
Um...

2786
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:44,480
It's better to start on Twitch and then move on to YouTube.

2787
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,480
Because I think long term...

2788
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:48,560
Uh...

2789
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,000
YouTube is better.

2790
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,380
Monetary wise.

2791
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,560
Because you have everything in one channel.

2792
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,720
You have the VODs.

2793
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,260
You have videos.

2794
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,500
You have shorts.

2795
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,380
Everything is one channel.

2796
01:30:59,520 --> 01:30:59,880
Twitch.

2797
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:02,160
Usually you just have the live stream.

2798
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,660
And then you upload it.

2799
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:07,140
Edit it versions of your live stream to your YouTube channel if you want to.

2800
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:08,540
Um...

2801
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:10,340
Twitch is just streaming.

2802
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,020
Usually people don't watch VODs on Twitch.

2803
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:17,460
People will watch edited content on YouTube of your Twitch VODs.

2804
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:18,380
So...

2805
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:19,160
Uh...

2806
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,980
So that is why...

2807
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:21,640
Like...

2808
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,620
Long term...

2809
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:25,620
I feel like YouTube is just better long term.

2810
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,440
If you want to do long term wise.

2811
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,840
If you're a Twitch streamer...

2812
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,140
And you want to have a presence on YouTube...

2813
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:34,300
Have your VODs edited into highlights.

2814
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,860
Don't just upload VODs.

2815
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,240
Because like...

2816
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,260
Sometimes people can't fucking watch 2 hours.

2817
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,140
Hahaha.

2818
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:43,280
Uh...

2819
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:43,840
VODs.

2820
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:44,260
Hahaha.

2821
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:46,080
Hahaha.

2822
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,360
We all have short attention spans these days.

2823
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:50,980
Hahaha.

2824
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,260
Have a VOD channel too.

2825
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,440
If you really want to.

2826
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,880
And you want to keep the VODs.

2827
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,120
Have the VOD.

2828
01:31:58,300 --> 01:31:59,420
Just keep it.

2829
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:00,180
I don't know.

2830
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,160
But...

2831
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,220
If you really want to have a presence...

2832
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,540
On YouTube.

2833
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,720
Upload edited versions of the...

2834
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,880
Edited highlights...

2835
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,840
Yes, people would rather watch edit highlights than a fucking 2-3 hour video.

2836
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,760
If you want to upload your VODs, have a separate VOD channel.

2837
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:32,040
The reason why I don't upload my VODs, my Twitch VODs, onto my YouTube channel, my main one, is that that affects my algorithm so much.

2838
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:42,760
Because I know, personally, because I'm like that too, that not a lot of people would want to watch like 3 hour plus of something that's already happened.

2839
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,260
They'd rather watch it live.

2840
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,180
And because of that, I have a separate VOD channel.

2841
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:57,620
Because I know if the VOD performs not as good as my other stuff, it affects my algorithm and YouTube is like, what the fuck?

2842
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:06,200
YouTube would be like, whoa, what happened there?

2843
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:06,600
Don't...

2844
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:12,720
Moki, why is your channel fucking tanking from this one video?

2845
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:18,800
And I had to separate it because I know VOD channels are the meta and you have to have it separate.

2846
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,800
Like, if I'm going to upload a video, it would be highlights.

2847
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,640
And that's the way.

2848
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,180
You have to appease the algorithm.

2849
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,060
It's all about playing the algorithm.

2850
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,800
All right, but what about multi-stream?

2851
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,620
Yes, you can multi-stream.

2852
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:41,840
It's a very popular method right now, especially in NA.

2853
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,360
I don't think like other countries people are doing multi-streams.

2854
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:48,100
It's mostly because like it's mostly an NA thing.

2855
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,620
I personally don't do multi-streams because I don't like splitting the audience.

2856
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,420
I don't like...

2857
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:59,460
Because you can only have one chat up there and like I don't like... I personally don't like this.

2858
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:06,300
This is my own personal preference and that is why I don't multi-stream because I don't like splitting the audiences.

2859
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:14,120
And like I don't like cultivating different cultures of viewerships because...

2860
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:19,360
Because like Twitch culture is different from YouTube culture.

2861
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:23,280
And then if you choose... if you multi-stream, you only have one chat up.

2862
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:32,840
And then obviously if you have one particular chat up over the other, more people will go on to that stream.

2863
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:36,320
Because people would be like, oh you're gonna be paying attention to that chat.

2864
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:41,400
So I rather pay attention to one singular chat from one platform.

2865
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:45,640
And just juggle I make one my main and the other different.

2866
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:51,040
So like that is why I uhh I like I don't do multi-stream.

2867
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:57,640
But I know that others do multi-stream because it's really good for growth on both platforms.

2868
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,900
You don't know which platform is your main platform and you want to grow as a creator.

2869
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,100
You do small...

2870
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:10,160
If you're a small streamer, you can do both because it's very good for growth.

2871
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:18,120
I don't do both because I want to focus on nurturing one community.

2872
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:26,860
And focus on one community versus trying to split myself too much.

2873
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:33,020
Because I do better focusing on one thing rather than two things.

2874
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:34,480
Because I'm stupid as hell.

2875
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,220
That is why.

2876
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:48,200
Obviously, as a newer streamer, multistreaming is good for you.

2877
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:51,060
I would personally say multistreaming would be a good benefit for you.

2878
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,780
But growth-wise, Twitch is the way to go for growth-wise if you're a smaller streamer.

2879
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:02,980
Anyway.

2880
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:08,180
Also, as a Twitch streamer, there is different...

2881
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:08,740
There are different cultures.

2882
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:13,180
Like I said, there are different viewer culture and streaming cultures.

2883
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:17,240
On YouTube, there are a lot of things you have to do on YouTube.

2884
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:20,840
And that was one of the things that was the most stressful for me.

2885
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,700
It was because adjusting to this.

2886
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,800
I need a schedule.

2887
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:31,300
Before going more serious in VTubing, I would just stream whenever the fuck I want.

2888
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,080
I didn't have a schedule.

2889
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,580
I didn't make thumbnails.

2890
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,220
And I didn't plan anything.

2891
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,600
I just streamed.

2892
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:38,560
But...

2893
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:39,740
Um...

2894
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:48,460
When you're getting serious on YouTube, YouTube viewers, YouTube VTuber viewers, they like schedules.

2895
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,040
They like thumbnails.

2896
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,900
And they like it when you plan stuff.

2897
01:36:52,380 --> 01:37:00,520
But also, you have to realize that because you have a schedule, viewers will pick and choose what they want to watch.

2898
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,580
So, like, um...

2899
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,400
You know, sometimes you stream something.

2900
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:06,440
You know they're gonna...

2901
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,780
They know you're gonna stream this.

2902
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:08,540
But it's not gonna be a stream.

2903
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,520
It's not something they want to watch.

2904
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,620
So they don't show up.

2905
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:12,780
You have to...

2906
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:15,620
You have more of an inconsistent, like, concurrent viewers.

2907
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:17,520
Because...

2908
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,460
Um...

2909
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:21,100
Because, like, you know, they don't want to watch it.

2910
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,760
Well, on Twitch, viewers are like, they don't care.

2911
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:30,880
No, they do care.

2912
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:32,260
They do care.

2913
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:36,080
But, like, a lot of times when you're watching...

2914
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,660
You're on Twitch when you're watching.

2915
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:39,600
They don't really have...

2916
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,740
They do play whatever the fuck they...

2917
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:42,540
They just go like, today I want to play this.

2918
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,960
And then I got to swap to that.

2919
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,400
And now I'm gonna do this.

2920
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:46,480
And now I'll do that.

2921
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:50,880
There's no, like, actual, like, you don't know what's gonna happen type deal.

2922
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:52,140
Um...

2923
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:53,800
But you're always there.

2924
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:54,580
You're just there.

2925
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,140
You're there for them type deal.

2926
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,180
You don't care what they're doing.

2927
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,220
You just want to be there.

2928
01:37:58,680 --> 01:37:59,040
Like...

2929
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:04,060
So, like...

2930
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,200
So, like, Twitch viewers...

2931
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,180
They're more so of like, whoa, what's gonna happen?

2932
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,180
It's more...

2933
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:09,800
We're just here.

2934
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,520
We're just here.

2935
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:11,980
It's very unpredictable.

2936
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,240
We're just here.

2937
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,680
But then, like, YouTube, they're like, oh, I don't...

2938
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,720
They're like, oh, they're gonna play this.

2939
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,340
I don't really want to watch that.

2940
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,960
So, I guess I'll just miss it.

2941
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,900
Like, it's more so like, I'm not really into that game.

2942
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:24,880
I'm just...

2943
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:25,480
I'm just gonna...

2944
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,540
I'm just gonna watch something else.

2945
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:28,060
You know?

2946
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:28,740
Like...

2947
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,620
Like, it's stuff like that.

2948
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,060
You're just...

2949
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,700
But, Twitch viewers, you're like, I'm just happy to be here.

2950
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:43,340
So...

2951
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,220
Oh, shit.

2952
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:44,820
Chat disconnected.

2953
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,820
Am I still alive?

2954
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,460
My chat disconnected.

2955
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:48,400
Oh, shit.

2956
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:48,620
Okay.

2957
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,220
I'm back on.

2958
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,420
Did I...

2959
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:51,380
Was I still alive?

2960
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:52,920
I don't know.

2961
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,800
My chat disconnected.

2962
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,700
Oh, I was.

2963
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:57,540
Okay.

2964
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:00,100
For some reason, my chat disconnected.

2965
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,900
So, I was like, whoa, am I still alive?

2966
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:02,520
Okay.

2967
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:03,220
Anyway.

2968
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,040
So, I'm back on.

2969
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,460
Um, that's basically it.

2970
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,400
So, you have to be aware.

2971
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:10,360
Like, even so...

2972
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,500
You're still cultivating a fanbase on Youtube.

2973
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:13,820
But, like...

2974
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:15,720
Twitch viewers...

2975
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,980
Like, YouTube viewers have an excuse.

2976
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:21,660
Twitch viewers don't have the excuse to not watch you.

2977
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,680
Because they're like, what if I miss an important thing that's gonna happen?

2978
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:29,740
Because I wasn't there.

2979
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:30,760
I don't know what's happening.

2980
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,500
And another thing...

2981
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:35,880
So...

2982
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,820
So it's like, you don't know, they don't know.

2983
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,500
They don't know, they have to be there.

2984
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,580
Because they're like, what if...

2985
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:43,920
Oh my god, what if she's just gonna play my favorite game?

2986
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:45,240
And I'm gonna miss out!

2987
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,540
Yeah, the fear of missing out.

2988
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:46,940
Yeah.

2989
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,480
What if I miss a game that...

2990
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,660
Oh my god, she's gonna play a game that I really like.

2991
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:52,480
I don't know that.

2992
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,700
But what if she does?

2993
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,820
Like, you don't know.

2994
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:56,200
So you're there.

2995
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:58,580
You're there no matter what game you're playing.

2996
01:39:58,800 --> 01:39:59,660
And then...

2997
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,120
The fear of missing out.

2998
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,180
But YouTube, you're like, she's gonna play that.

2999
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:04,440
I fucking hate that game.

3000
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:05,320
I'm not gonna show up.

3001
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,600
I personally like structure more.

3002
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,200
I don't like randomly picking games and stuff.

3003
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:17,520
Because like, I just want to focus on one thing.

3004
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:22,900
I just want to focus on one thing and then be good with that.

3005
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:25,200
Like, I don't like...

3006
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,860
I don't... I like more of a structure.

3007
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,640
Because I'm very indecisive.

3008
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:30,840
And I rather just know what I'm doing.

3009
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:39,660
I'm super indecisive in general.

3010
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:42,440
And then there's like memberships and stuff like that.

3011
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:47,320
Like in Twitch, the thing is, a lot of Twitch streamers, they have Discord servers.

3012
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:54,420
But like, Discord servers for like, which is like the substitute of the membership stuff on YouTube.

3013
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:56,460
YouTube offers memberships.

3014
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,120
On Twitch, you don't have to...

3015
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:59,260
There's like subs.

3016
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,160
But you're not required...

3017
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,920
You're not like incentivized.

3018
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,140
To have like, you know...

3019
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:06,700
Sub only streams.

3020
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,800
Stuff like that.

3021
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:09,940
Um...

3022
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,840
And YouTube, you are.

3023
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,480
Because like, it is a benefit to be a YouTube member.

3024
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,960
There's more exclusivity.

3025
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,120
Being a member.

3026
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:17,940
There's more stuff to it.

3027
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,260
There's a different culture.

3028
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:22,560
On Twitch, subs don't have like exclusivity on there.

3029
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,400
There's no exclusive stuff.

3030
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,500
Other than like Discord servers.

3031
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:28,080
I know like a lot of like Twitch VTubers.

3032
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,180
A lot of Twitch content creators.

3033
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,460
They have like a...

3034
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:32,460
Uh...

3035
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:37,420
Discord server dedicated to be like the membership stuff on YouTube.

3036
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:38,580
Um...

3037
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:41,280
So, it's more so of like...

3038
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,260
And then there's the emote stuff.

3039
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,180
You can use the emote everywhere.

3040
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,420
And stuff like that.

3041
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:45,860
Um...

3042
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:46,540
And...

3043
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:48,680
It's more so of like...

3044
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,860
Obviously, when you're a YouTube streamer...

3045
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,420
Cater your...

3046
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:53,880
Not cater.

3047
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,180
Cultivate your membership stuff.

3048
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:56,880
Make it appealing.

3049
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,960
Don't just have like nothing really.

3050
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,440
I do member streams every other week.

3051
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,600
To have something.

3052
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,360
And I have like membership plans.

3053
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,900
Like exclusive membership stuff.

3054
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:07,320
Like exclusive gaming sessions.

3055
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:10,440
And exclusive like Minecraft member server.

3056
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:12,440
Like stuff like that.

3057
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,120
There's like...

3058
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:15,980
Exclusive wallpapers that are being made.

3059
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:17,020
Um...

3060
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,100
So that people wanna want to keep...

3061
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:19,740
Uh...

3062
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:20,980
Wanna keep being a member.

3063
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,000
So, don't just like...

3064
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:25,440
Make sure to have something there.

3065
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:27,120
To make it worth...

3066
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:28,520
Being a member.

3067
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,380
As a Twitch sub...

3068
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,420
You don't really have...

3069
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:32,600
Like...

3070
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,700
Twitch you don't really have...

3071
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:35,080
Like...

3072
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,900
Other than emotes.

3073
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,440
There's no...

3074
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:37,680
Like...

3075
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,720
The Twitch sub appeal is the emotes.

3076
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,380
It's not like the...

3077
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:41,840
Like...

3078
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:42,360
Cause you know...

3079
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,600
YouTube emotes you can't use it.

3080
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:44,680
You can only use it in one channel.

3081
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:47,520
But Twitch emotes you can use it in every channel.

3082
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,560
You can use it everywhere.

3083
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,160
That's the appeal.

3084
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:50,080
Uh...

3085
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:50,900
If you're on a...

3086
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,300
Highly recommend...

3087
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:53,480
If you're gonna be a Twitch streamer...

3088
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,640
To have good emotes.

3089
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,420
Because sometimes...

3090
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,540
People subscribe to you for the emotes.

3091
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:01,640
I've had that happen before.

3092
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,460
There's been multiple cases of people...

3093
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:05,300
Um...

3094
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,980
Just subscribing on Twitch.

3095
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:10,900
Because they just wanna use cool emotes.

3096
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:11,600
Like...

3097
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,440
If you wanna appeal...

3098
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,320
To have good subs...

3099
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,400
To have like more subs on Twitch...

3100
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,240
Have nice quality emotes.

3101
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,720
And make sure they're like memorable.

3102
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:22,680
Or stuff like that.

3103
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,420
Like make sure like people would wanna have it.

3104
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:25,900
Like they don't care about your content.

3105
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:27,060
They just wanna have good memotes.

3106
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:27,900
Like...

3107
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:28,320
Like...

3108
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,160
Like...

3109
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:32,260
Some people actually do it.

3110
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:33,280
It was a huge thing.

3111
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,580
A couple of years ago.

3112
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,060
There would be streamers that were known as like...

3113
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:37,500
Oh my god.

3114
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,080
They're like the bear emotes.

3115
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,020
I only want them for the bear emotes.

3116
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:41,620
Like that's it.

3117
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:43,980
They were known for like their emotes.

3118
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:44,760
That was it.

3119
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,680
And like people actually did that.

3120
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:48,400
People actually just subscribed...

3121
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,960
To have good emotes.

3122
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:50,880
And like...

3123
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,160
If you really wanna like...

3124
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:55,240
If you really wanna like appeal...

3125
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:57,500
To like more people...

3126
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,500
Then do that.

3127
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:59,500
It's fine.

3128
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,440
It's just another way to like...

3129
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,300
Have a more...

3130
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,480
Stable like...

3131
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,180
I guess like stable income.

3132
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,480
Alright anyway I think...

3133
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,700
Is that everything I have?

3134
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:15,380
Everything I have for YouTube.

3135
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:17,760
I think that's everything I have for YouTube versus Twitch.

3136
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:18,600
Alright.

3137
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:19,420
The algorithm.

3138
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:24,000
I love the algorithm.

3139
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:25,420
Yay.

3140
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:27,700
Alright.

3141
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:29,480
Algorithm.

3142
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:36,680
So shorts if you're on YouTube milk the shit out of shorts.

3143
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:43,080
Shorts are being heavily pushed by YouTube for a while now.

3144
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:46,620
I thought they would stop but they're still doing it because they want to take over TikTok.

3145
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:50,480
The reason why is that you know we might not even have TikTok anymore.

3146
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:53,160
So YouTube is like we're gonna be the next TikTok.

3147
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:57,420
So they're heavily pushing shorts at the moment.

3148
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:00,360
Because of that.

3149
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,620
Even streams by the way.

3150
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:04,540
You might be seeing a lot of people streaming shorts like...

3151
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,020
Like live streams in the shorts category.

3152
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,300
Because like when you're browsing through like shorts.

3153
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:09,980
YouTube shorts.

3154
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,540
You can get like...

3155
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:13,540
Like live streams now too.

3156
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,600
From like random people.

3157
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:17,040
So like yeah a lot of vertical streams.

3158
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:20,080
Because like it just shows up on your fucking algorithm.

3159
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,540
It just shows up.

3160
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:24,760
You just scroll through and then some streams show up too.

3161
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:27,400
And it's like...

3162
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,520
It's really good for building the audience.

3163
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,440
Because that's what the algorithm pushing right now.

3164
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,440
The meta is shorts.

3165
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:35,400
Everybody just wants to watch on their phone.

3166
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:41,500
Everyone just wants to watch on their phone now.

3167
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:43,140
Because I don't know dude.

3168
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:47,200
We just have very short attention spans these days.

3169
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:49,740
We're not really helping ourselves.

3170
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,500
Hey but don't put all your eggs in that basket.

3171
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:56,760
Because you can upload your shorts to TikTok and Instagram.

3172
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:00,280
Apparently Instagram reels are also blowing up now too.

3173
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:01,960
But like that's...

3174
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:03,660
If you want to cater to the normies more.

3175
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:04,080
Like...

3176
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,220
I would say...

3177
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:11,520
You can work on like Instagram reels.

3178
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:15,920
If you really want to like cater more to like the normies.

3179
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,260
Because like all the normies are in Instagram right now.

3180
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:21,140
So I mean I think they're still using Instagram.

3181
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:21,700
I don't know.

3182
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,280
I haven't used Instagram so fucking long.

3183
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,820
But like...

3184
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:26,740
It's Instagram reels.

3185
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:29,800
TikTok and YouTube shorts.

3186
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:32,340
There's a lot of channels right now.

3187
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:34,940
That are at like 1 million to 2 million...

3188
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:36,300
Like 1 million plus subscribers.

3189
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:39,820
And all they do is just shorts.

3190
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:44,060
They don't upload any videos or like do any live streams.

3191
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:46,440
It's literally just shorts.

3192
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:49,120
Because that's what YouTube is pushing right now.

3193
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:49,980
There's like...

3194
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:50,640
I've seen...

3195
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:51,540
I was like watching...

3196
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:52,620
Looking at some of the channels.

3197
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,060
That are like...

3198
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:56,040
That are like...

3199
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:56,720
They upload videos.

3200
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:01,080
But the videos would have like 20k views or something.

3201
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:04,440
But then the shorts would be like 30 million and 40 million.

3202
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,420
And they'll have like 1 million plus subscribers.

3203
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,140
It's because they only push shorts.

3204
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:14,140
I would highly suggest and highly recommend...

3205
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:16,760
That you do shorts.

3206
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:18,480
You don't put everything on shorts.

3207
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:19,880
You still stream.

3208
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:25,180
Just remember to stream.

3209
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:27,540
Because you need to keep your audience.

3210
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:28,660
You stream and shorts.

3211
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:29,860
You stream, upload shorts.

3212
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:31,900
What I used to do...

3213
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:34,600
Is that I would upload a short...

3214
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,300
Every time I'm not streaming.

3215
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:38,400
Because like the YouTube algorithm...

3216
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:40,500
Is so fucked up.

3217
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:44,380
That if you don't upload a thing for a day...

3218
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:45,960
They would be like...

3219
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,840
Whoa, that's a bad mark on your algorithm.

3220
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,020
I'd be like...

3221
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:55,900
They'll be like...

3222
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,160
You're not uploading now?

3223
01:47:59,440 --> 01:47:59,920
So...

3224
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:06,960
Back then...

3225
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,020
I would upload a short whenever I'm not streaming.

3226
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,620
Because I would be like...

3227
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,460
Oh no, I can't keep up the algorithm.

3228
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:17,140
Now, I upload a short even if I'm streaming.

3229
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:18,380
Because I want to keep a consistency.

3230
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,280
Because I'm just starting out.

3231
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,080
And right now, I have like a huge boost in my algorithm.

3232
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:24,960
So I have to keep going.

3233
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,600
And because of that, I keep going until like...

3234
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,760
The algorithm boost has stagnated.

3235
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:31,940
So that is why I personally...

3236
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:34,420
Am uploading shorts even when I'm streaming.

3237
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,460
I have three editors.

3238
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,960
Each editor edits at least two shorts per week.

3239
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,220
So I can keep this consistent schedule.

3240
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,420
That is because I am willing to...

3241
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:48,520
I have the money to invest in it.

3242
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,120
Obviously, not everybody has the money.

3243
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,120
I have to like edit it themselves.

3244
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:52,400
And stuff like that.

3245
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:54,400
I have three editors to...

3246
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:54,880
So they can...

3247
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,360
I don't want to overwork one editor.

3248
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,780
So I have three editors.

3249
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:01,140
And I give them a chance to edit two shorts per week.

3250
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:03,580
If they don't want to do it, that is up to them.

3251
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,660
If they want to edit more, that is up to them.

3252
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:07,500
But I...

3253
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,620
I have...

3254
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:11,180
Because I don't want to overwork one editor.

3255
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:12,660
So I separate it into three.

3256
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,880
And I have a whole server set up for them.

3257
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:19,030
So that they won't like overload each...

3258
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:20,980
They won't like overlap each other.

3259
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:24,780
And that is why I can able to keep the consistency.

3260
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,600
Of like having a short almost every day.

3261
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,600
To keep this algorithm boost.

3262
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:33,100
Because I have a fucking insane algorithm boost right now.

3263
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:34,960
Like I'm fucking everywhere apparently.

3264
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:35,740
Like...

3265
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,180
And that's what I mean when I said it's all about luck.

3266
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:41,640
You can't just coast.

3267
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:44,080
You have to know when you have the boost.

3268
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:45,760
When you have the algorithm boost.

3269
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:47,700
You have to be consistent.

3270
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,860
Regarding keeping this algorithm.

3271
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:53,920
And that is why I've been trying to keep this algorithm up.

3272
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:56,620
And...

3273
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,220
And that is why I have three editors.

3274
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:00,340
To keep this up.

3275
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:05,920
But like I said you might see a lot of people streaming short section.

3276
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:09,520
Because like I said the stream will be fed into the short scrollers.

3277
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:12,000
That's why everybody is streaming in a vertical format.

3278
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,060
In a vertical format now.

3279
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:15,920
Also we are doing shorts.

3280
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,040
I remember I saw on Twitter.

3281
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:19,920
How do I pick the moments.

3282
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,040
I let my editors pick the clips.

3283
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,460
Because if they see a good...

3284
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:25,840
How do I find my editors?

3285
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,320
I hire clippers.

3286
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,480
That is why clipping is so good.

3287
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:32,620
If you want to get noticed as an editor.

3288
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,380
As an editor.

3289
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,160
Or like if you want to get jobs as an editor.

3290
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:38,860
Be a clipper.

3291
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:41,960
Clip some of your favorite Vtubers.

3292
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:44,660
Clip some of your favorite content creators.

3293
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:48,300
Because they know what's good content.

3294
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,500
And that is why.

3295
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,260
I hired clippers.

3296
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:53,380
Because.

3297
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,280
I hired some of these clippers.

3298
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,520
Some of their videos.

3299
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,620
I researched their videos.

3300
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,880
And they have like millions.

3301
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,680
They've got like millions of views on their videos.

3302
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,820
Or like they got like 500k views.

3303
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,780
On the videos that they clipped themselves.

3304
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,500
And then I was like.

3305
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:11,580
And they would clip me.

3306
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,740
And I would be like you are a good clipper.

3307
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,240
I'm going to hire you.

3308
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:19,720
And that is how I found my clippers.

3309
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,300
My editors.

3310
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,720
I basically.

3311
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:24,640
If you really want to try and get your name out there.

3312
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:28,500
Just start clipping your favorite content creators.

3313
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,340
Because that's how they research.

3314
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:33,120
I don't normally pick like random editors.

3315
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:37,460
I clip somebody that watches me.

3316
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:39,960
Because they know what's good content.

3317
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,420
That I bring.

3318
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:44,660
But if you can't afford to.

3319
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,220
I highly suggest.

3320
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:47,580
When you try.

3321
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:47,900
You're like.

3322
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:50,180
Oh but what if I'm making my own clips.

3323
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:51,700
Then.

3324
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:52,080
Um.

3325
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:54,480
Uh.

3326
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:55,580
Then.

3327
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,200
Look at your chat.

3328
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:58,960
And see which part.

3329
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,580
Has the biggest fan response.

3330
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:03,400
Like chat response.

3331
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:04,720
Because usually.

3332
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:06,900
Because there's like an analytic thing.

3333
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,640
Where you can see that.

3334
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:09,180
So like when you see an analytic.

3335
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,260
Which one has the most like chat engagement.

3336
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:14,580
That is usually where the best content is to clip.

3337
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,020
Because people would be like.

3338
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:16,300
Oh.

3339
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:17,380
Like.

3340
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:17,700
Oh.

3341
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,500
Like a lot of chatters started.

3342
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:21,460
Talking so much.

3343
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,960
In that one moment.

3344
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,840
That must have been a good part.

3345
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:26,260
And then you watch it back.

3346
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:26,440
And you're like.

3347
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:27,380
Oh that is a good part.

3348
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,420
I'm gonna edit this myself.

3349
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:30,320
Um.

3350
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,300
Obviously.

3351
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:32,460
Learning to edit.

3352
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:33,400
Is like a skill.

3353
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:34,320
I don't know how to edit.

3354
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:35,680
And that's why I pay people to do it.

3355
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:36,600
I'm more of a producer.

3356
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,400
I am a producer.

3357
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:39,620
More so of.

3358
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,140
Of like.

3359
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:41,960
Um.

3360
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:43,120
Being able to do.

01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:43,780
Like editing.

3362
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,500
And stuff like that.

3363
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,380
I have.

3364
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,500
I'm an idea person.

3365
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:47,540
Um.

3366
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:48,120
I.

3367
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:48,840
I admit.

3368
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:49,920
I am an idea person.

3369
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:51,300
And I like to produce things.

3370
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:52,420
Um.

3371
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:53,760

3372
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:55,540
And.

3373
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,720
Editing is really hard.

3374
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,160
I can't really give much advice.

3375
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:59,120
Regarding editing.

3376
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,120
Because.

3377
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:00,680
Uh.

Thank you.

3384
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,800
I can't really do much.

3385
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:06,680
Regarding giving advice.

3386
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:07,320
On editing.

3387
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:08,380
So I really suggest.

3388
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:09,120
Like looking up.

3389
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:09,580
Like tutorials.

3390
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,760
Or like asking around.

3391
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:11,980
Uh.

3392
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:13,380
But.

3393
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:14,660
Anyway.

01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,160
So like.

3395
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:16,320
That is basically how.

3396
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,040
I go about with clipping.

3397
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,120
With like editing.

3398
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:19,500
And stuff.

3399
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:20,580
Um.

3400
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,360
There's another way.

3401
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:23,540
To do like.

3402
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:24,780
There's different types of edits.

3403
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:25,260
You can do.

3404
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,000
Right now.

3405
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:26,940
Since I am an indie.

3406
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:27,940
I am much more free.

3407
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:28,820
To experiment.

3408
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:29,480
With my editing.

3409
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:30,880
Um.

3410
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,120
It's more so.

01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:32,780
Of like.

01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:34,020
So you see like.

3413
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:34,880
Back then.

3414
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:36,120
It was just mostly clips.

3415
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,440
And like animated clips.

3416
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:38,260
Now.

3417
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,320
I'm more so.

3418
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:40,460
Experimenting.

3419
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:40,880
With how.

3420
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,100
My shorts are done.

3421
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:43,860
There's more so.

3422
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:45,280
There's like story time stuff.

3423
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:47,840
Story time is very popular.

3424
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:48,880
I would say.

3425
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:49,840
For Vtubers.

3426
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,120
If you really want to blow up.

3427
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:52,600
With shorts.

3428
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:53,840
Story time.

3429
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:55,580
Is the best way to go.

3430
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:56,420
Story time.

3431
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:58,040
And anything to do with relatability.

3432
01:53:58,620 --> 01:53:59,760
Is the way to go.

3433
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:00,620
If you have a story.

3434
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:01,960
That shit.

3435
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,700
Will do so well.

3436
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:04,840
Um.

3437
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:05,600
It's all about.

3438
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:06,440
Tangents.

3439
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:07,080
Story time.

3440
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:07,920
And relatability.

3441
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:08,680
Between.

3442
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:09,780
With the clips.

3443
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,160
And that is like.

3444
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:11,540
The clips.

3445
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:12,360
That would blow up.

3446
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:12,880
The most.

3447
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:13,580
With grinding shorts.

3448
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:13,840
Um.

3449
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:14,520
To blow up.

3450
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,660
Into like.

3451
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:16,940
The normie sphere.

3452
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:18,380
Like it goes beyond.

3453
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:19,560
Just Vtubing.

3454
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:20,320

01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,380
So people can be like.

01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:23,460
For real.

3458
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:24,020
For real.

3459
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:25,560
If you look at my shorts.

3460
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:27,180
My most popular shorts.

3465
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:33,520
And the waking up stuff.

3466
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:34,180
Like I'll be like.

3467
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:34,560
Oh I.

Oh my gosh.

She's so relatable.

3474
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:41,020
She's the pre.

3475
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:42,760
I'm sorry.

3476
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,740
I saw that.

3477
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:43,820

01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:48,300
So one of my comment was like.

3479
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:49,540
Oh my god.

3480
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,240
She sleeps so much.

3481
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,160
She's so depressed.

3482
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:53,240
It's so relatable.

3483
01:54:57,980 --> 01:54:59,400
I saw that.

3484
01:54:59,540 --> 01:54:59,940

3485
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:00,680

3487
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:03,480
Anyway.

01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:06,440
That was like.

3489
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:07,680
One of the comments.

3490
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:08,320
I saw.

3491
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:09,540
Um.

01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:11,780
But like.

3493
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:12,540
As I was saying.

3494
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:13,800
There's a lot of.

3495
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:14,660
It's all about like.

3496
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:15,700
Or like something.

3497
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:16,440
That's like.

3498
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:17,340

Is a Funko Pop.

3510
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:26,740

Why Funko.

3519
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:34,500
Why not a nendoroid.

3520
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:35,880

Like.

3530
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:48,200
It's like the biggest endorsements you can get.

3531
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,420
In the normies sphere.

3532
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:52,040
And you're supposed to break the normies sphere.

3533
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:58,300
It's so great idea.

3534
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:00,200
It's a great idea.

3535
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,940

01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:08,280
Don't give a fuck.

3541
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:09,320
Don't collect anything.

3542
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:10,540
They like.

3543
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:11,740
Just want to collect Funko.

Their community is all about.

3547
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:15,940
Collecting everything.

01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:16,740
It's like.

01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:18,840
That's why.

3552
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:19,520
I could be like.

3553
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,180
The Vtuber in that fucking collection.

3554
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:22,780
It's just smart.

3555
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:25,720
It's so fucking smart.

3556
01:56:26,060 --> 01:56:26,420

01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:29,520
Nendoroid collectors.

3560
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:30,480
Nendoroid collectors.

3561
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:31,520
They collect parts.

3562
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:34,080
If you don't have a good part.

3563
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:34,920
They don't care.

3564
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:38,740
Cause Nendoroid collectors.

3565
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,360
They are not here.

3566
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,140
They are here to make new.

3567
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:43,900
They just want the parts.

3568
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:44,600
And the faces.

3569
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:45,580
And stuff like that.

3570
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:46,560
Or like.

3571
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:47,580

But like.

3575
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:50,480
Nendoroid collectors.

3576
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:52,360
Like the hardcore collectors.

3577
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:54,400
They are not collecting the figures.

3578
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,900
They are collecting the Nendoroid parts.

3579
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:57,760
Like.

3580
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:00,520
So they can mix and match.

3581
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:02,480
But Funko Pop collectors.

3582
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:04,800
They collect everything.

3583
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:09,860
They might be like.

3584
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:11,600
I don't know what that character is.

3585
01:57:11,860 --> 01:57:13,520
But I want it.

3586
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,820
But I also love a Nendoroid too.

3587
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:22,020
Because that's also a dream.

3588
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,080
Cause they look amazing.

3589
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:24,520
I used to be.

3590
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:25,500
I used to be a Nendoroid collector.

3591
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:27,360
Not a Nendoroid parts collector.

3592
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,420
But like a Nendoroid collector.

3593
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:30,400
Like.

3594
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,580
Like the not hardcore collector.

3595
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:33,720
Of Nendoroids.

3596
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,920
I would buy Nendoroids.

3597
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:36,700
Because I would be the best.

3598
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:36,820
I would be like.

3599
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:37,540
Oh I like.

3600
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,820
I would buy Nendoroids.

3601
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:39,240
Cause I would be like.

3602
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:40,200
Oh I like this.

3603
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:41,200
I like this.

3604
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:42,800
Character.

3605
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:44,300
I don't know what character this.

3606
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:46,800
I was like a Funko Pop version of a Nendoroid collector.

3607
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:48,860
Because I bought like that.

3608
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,760
I bought a Nendoroid.

3609
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:51,400
Where like.

3610
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:54,080
The character was riding on a bird.

3611
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:55,000
Thing.

3612
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:57,140
I don't know what the fuck.

3613
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,840
Who the fuck this character is.

3614
01:57:59,140 --> 01:57:59,920
I was like.

3615
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,540
Look at that beautiful bird mount.

3616
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:04,100
I want it.

3617
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,280
I still don't know what character it is.

3618
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:11,960
I still don't know.

3619
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,860
I just thought it was so cool.

3620
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:14,760
Cause I was like.

3621
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:16,740
I've never seen it before on a Nendoroid.

3622
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:18,060
It was back then when like.

3623
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:19,220
Nendoroids didn't have like.

3624
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:19,860
Those like.

3625
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:21,600
Second mount character things.

3626
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:22,660
And I was like.

3627
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,420
That's so cool.

3628
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:29,200
No it wasn't Final Fantasy.

3629
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,180
I have no idea.

3630
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:30,940
Anyway.

3631
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:31,480
Fuck you.

3632
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:32,040
We're off topic.

3633
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:34,260
We're off topic right now.

3634
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:36,680
I'm just kidding.

3635
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:37,900
Okay.

3636
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:38,700
Anyway.

3637
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:39,960
FOMO games.

3638
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:42,360
The fear of missing out.

3639
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:44,320
Streamer games.

3640
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,820
I already explained about that already.

3641
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:50,680
I already explained about like FOMO games.

3642
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:51,680
But it's.

3643
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:52,040
You know.

3644
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:52,660
Like I said.

3645
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:53,980
There's like.

3646
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,340
You don't want to miss out.

3647
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,320
Lots of viewers don't want to miss out.

3648
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:57,960
So.

3649
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:00,420
You have to play them.

3650
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:02,060
Great examples.

3651
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,620
Chilla Arts games.

3652
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:06,360
So many VTubers.

3653
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:06,660
But I don't know.

3654
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:06,840
I don't want to miss out.

3655
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:07,540
I want to play Chilla Arts games.

3656
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:08,360
Because.

3657
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:10,100
Chilla Arts is like.

3658
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:11,980
The epiphany.

3659
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:13,120
Of FOMO.

3660
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:14,620
They don't want to miss out.

3661
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:15,720
Rage Gaming.

3662
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:16,360
Too.

3663
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,400
I don't want to miss out.

3664
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:20,920
Because it's all reaction baiting.

3665
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:22,980
It's there to bait reactions.

3666
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:25,100
And they love.

3667
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:26,000
Making.

3668
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:28,240
They love seeing the reactions.

3669
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:29,320
Of like.

3670
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:32,200
The VTubers streaming this particular section.

3671
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:33,840
Or this VTuber.

3672
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:36,500
That's why horror games is so popular.

3673
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:36,640
Like.

3674
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:45,240
But you can't always do horror games because if you're always streaming horror games, then like, uh, then like people get tired.

3675
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,800
Unless that's your niche.

3676
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:51,760
But even if that is your niche, you still have to be able to balance it out.

3677
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:55,280
Because people will just get like too much horror, you know?

3678
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:59,380
It's just be like, it's just like, oh, she's just gonna scream at that part.

3679
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:01,080
And then you're like, it's the same thing.

3680
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:02,940
Like, oh, she's just gonna get jump scare.

3681
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:05,420
It's just, you're just gonna get desensitized.

3682
02:00:05,420 --> 02:00:09,200
It's why horror streamers are... horror streamers were a niche.

3683
02:00:09,380 --> 02:00:12,860
It was meta because people love watching streamers scream.

3684
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:14,660
But then the meta died.

3685
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,580
It's all about the stream meta.

3686
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:23,760
You say PewDiePie and Markiplier and Jacksepticeye, they all used to stream horror stuff.

3687
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:25,360
But now they don't.

3688
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:26,420
They don't stream that much.

3689
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:31,600
Like, if you watch their streams, they like don't stream horror that much anymore.

3690
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,300
Because the meta died out.

3691
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,280
They don't... it's not the meta anymore.

3692
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:41,020
PewDiePie is a great example of a content creator that knew when to swap metas.

3693
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:42,380
Like...

3694
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:52,180
He swapped so many times with metas because he knew what was... what was gonna be the next meta.

3695
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:57,000
He was like a reaction... he fucking swapped a reaction content.

3696
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,600
Because he knew that's what people wanted to watch.

3697
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:04,610
And he was like... I would say like PewDiePie was one of the first like starters.

3698
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:05,400
And he was like...

3699
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:05,400
I would say like PewDiePie was one of the first like starters.

3700
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:07,080
Of like reaction content.

3701
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:11,400
Like the one of the biggest people that like knew what like...

3702
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:14,040
Like that like pioneered reaction content.

3703
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:15,920
Because he knew that's what people wanted.

3704
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,060
People like reaction content.

3705
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,360
That's what fucking rides the algorithm.

3706
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:23,940
And then it got... it turned into something... I don't know.

3707
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:26,560
And then he does like vlogging now because he's a dad now.

3708
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:27,260
He's super chill.

3709
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:28,200
He doesn't need to do anything.

3710
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,460
He's super fucking chill.

3711
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:35,740
Like he's a dad now.

3712
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:37,760
He has so much money.

3713
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,580
Like he doesn't have to... he just does it for fun.

3714
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:45,520
He just

3715
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:49,720
does stuff for fun.

3716
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:51,720
He doesn't have to care about the meta anymore.

3717
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:53,520
Like he has the money to not care.

3718
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,780
So like that's like his plus side.

3719
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:58,380
And also comments and likes!

3720
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:01,760
Commenting and liking is so beneficial.

3721
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:04,860
It actually helps boost the algorithm.

3722
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:07,640
So if you like this... that's why people like comments.

3723
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:08,280
And subscribe.

3724
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:10,300
Or comment and like this video.

3725
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:14,120
I don't really say it because like... I don't know.

3726
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:15,900
I don't want... it feels too normie.

3727
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:17,600
I know it just feels too normie.

3728
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:21,600
But it actually helps a lot.

3729
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:23,480
It really does help the engagement.

3730
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:26,040
Like I could end up saying... I'll be like...

3731
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:26,240
Hey!

3732
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:27,760
At the end of the vlog I could be like...

3733
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,500
Make sure to comment, like and subscribe.

3734
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:32,740
But like I don't do it because I'm lazy.

3735
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:33,760
Okay to be fair.

3736
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:36,620
One of the main reasons why I don't do it is because I'm fucking lazy.

3737
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:37,600
But also...

3738
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:42,540
It's a little cheesy and it's like super normie.

3739
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:43,160
So...

3740
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,800
So that's why...

3741
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,560
That's why I don't really do it.

3742
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:48,620
I don't tell people to comment, like and subscribe.

3743
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:51,820
But it helps!

3744
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:54,460
If you wanna help like an indie Vtuber.

3745
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:55,680
Or like an indie.

3746
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:56,860
Or like a small streamer.

3747
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:59,580
Comment and like and subscribe.

3748
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:01,580
Like comment and like their videos.

3749
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:03,700
Like all their fucking vlogs and all everything.

3750
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,380
Because it helps the algorithm a little bit more.

3751
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:08,880
Because YouTube fucking likes that shit.

3752
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:09,360
And I don't know why.

3753
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,140
Anyway...

3754
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:12,020
And also...

3755
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:12,580
Like I said...

3756
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:13,780
Follow the trends!

3757
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:18,380
You guys know what the newest fucking weird ass trend is?

3758
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,420
I'm not doing it because it's like...

3759
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:21,900
It's pretty fucked up.

3760
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:24,080
I don't care that much.

3761
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:27,280
I would follow like some trends if it seems fun.

3762
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:29,780
But if it's like too much...

3763
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:31,860
I just think it's just too much.

3764
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:32,360
I don't.

3765
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:33,940
Um...

3766
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:36,360
But like the newest trend right now...

3767
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:38,480
Is the green screen trend.

3768
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:40,640
And that is like where...

3769
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:42,080
Because it like baits engagement.

3770
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:43,380
It baits like...

3771
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:43,700
Whoa!

3772
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:44,380
Shock factor.

3773
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,400
So like basically what they do is that they...

3774
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:48,160
There's a green screen.

3775
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,700
And like on their body.

3776
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:53,040
And then you have like the gameplay with on their body.

3777
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,720
So like that's the...

3778
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:56,320
That's the engagement bait.

3779
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:56,860
Like...

3780
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:00,300
And yeah.

3781
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,660
That's like the current trend.

3782
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:02,780
It might change later.

3783
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:04,360
But that is the current trend.

3784
02:04:05,380 --> 02:04:06,340
You can say that...

3785
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:08,740
I think the NPC thing was a trend as well.

3786
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:09,520
Uh...

3787
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,800
Did you know 80% of my viewers are not...

3788
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:12,460
Subs...

3789
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:13,480
Did you guys...

3790
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:14,140
Actually...

3791
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:16,100
I think mine is like 20%.

3792
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:19,780
I think 20% or like 10 to 20% of my viewers are not subscribed.

3793
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:21,100
So like...

3794
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:22,320
I think that one was mine.

3795
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:23,540
Um...

3796
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:24,000
But yeah.

3797
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:24,240
Anyway.

3798
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,040
Thank you Super Chat.

3799
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:25,640
Thank you.

3800
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:26,680
Thank you Spirit.

3801
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:28,340
Um...

3802
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:29,640
Um...

3803
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,800
But the NPC stream is also a trend.

3804
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:32,500
It's a trend.

3805
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:33,320
So you follow trends.

3806
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:35,440
Obviously it baits engagement.

3807
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:36,860
And it baits like...

3808
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:37,320
Uh...

3809
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:38,440
Like a shock value.

3810
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:38,880
Or like...

3811
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,000
Oh!

3812
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:39,760
That's something new!

3813
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:40,640
Oh my god!

3814
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:41,740
They're doing something new!

3815
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:43,380
Like they're doing something funny.

3816
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:43,920
Something new.

3817
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:44,640
Oh my god!

3818
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:44,840
Haha!

3819
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:45,860
Like stuff like that.

3820
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:46,580
Just follow trends.

3821
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:47,720
And then songs!

3822
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:49,860
Songs are really, really good!

3823
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:53,460
Like if your cover song hits like a million views...

3824
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:53,860
Whoa!

3825
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:55,560
Good for you!

3826
02:04:57,140 --> 02:04:57,660
Congratulations!

3827
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:01,020
It means you have done really well.

3828
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:01,740
It's really good.

3829
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:02,300
Because people...

3830
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:03,940
Some people will subscribe to you.

3831
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:05,420
Because they really like your songs.

3832
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:05,600
Because they really like your singing.

3833
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:07,500
Like you...

3834
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:09,600
They will then put it on your playlist.

3835
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:10,600
Also Spotify!

3836
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:12,700
You can make so much money on Spotify.

3837
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:14,820
If you just upload your song on Spotify.

3838
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,480
I would heavily suggest if you have a fanbase.

3839
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,100
If you're starting a fanbase as a singer.

3840
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,940
Or an utaite or utaite.

3841
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:25,240
You start uploading things on Spotify.

3842
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:27,140
You can actually make a lot of money.

3843
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,200
From Spotify.

3844
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,040
If you have like...

3845
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:30,460
Um...

3846
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:31,280
Enough songs.

3847
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:31,960
Or like...

3848
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:33,220
If you have like...

3849
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:33,560
Um...

3850
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:34,460
Enough like...

3851
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:34,900
Uh...

3852
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:35,400
Exposures.

3853
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:42,680
I'm not sure because people put it on repeat and like songs on Spotify on repeat does make a decent amount of money.

3854
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:50,380
And it's only... it's only like... I know some people were like, oh, there's like big streamers.

3855
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:56,560
But you have to remember a lot of the bigger streamers have other companies taking the cut of those streams.

3856
02:05:56,700 --> 02:05:59,780
Like the like big singers, like the like the... what was it?

3857
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:02,580
The Billboard singers, you know, like, like I'm trying to think.

3858
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:05,500
Like if we talk about Taylor Swift's old management company.

3859
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:11,660
Taylor Swift, if you guys don't know why Taylor Swift is re-releasing her album.

3860
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:22,280
It is because if she... the reason why Taylor Swift is re-releasing her album is because her old album is owned by her old music label.

3861
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:31,640
And her old music label is... is like... basically owns that song.

3862
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:32,100
Okay.

3863
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:37,240
And because of that, she barely earns money from those old... her old music.

3864
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:42,420
So like that's why you see like, oh, but all the big music stars, they don't earn that much.

3865
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:48,280
But when you're a smaller music singer, you actually earn a pretty decent amount on Spotify.

3866
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:54,640
But you have to remember, it's better if you make original songs versus like cover songs to upload on Spotify.

3867
02:06:54,820 --> 02:07:00,000
Because obviously a lot of artists might not let you upload cover songs on Spotify.

3868
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:02,560
But you gotta have permission from the...

3869
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:04,540
the artist to be able to upload those songs.

3870
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:10,880
So like it's better to... if you have original songs, it actually... you can actually like make back your money type deal on Spotify.

3871
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:17,520
Because like it actually is very beneficial to you as a... grow... to grow as a singer.

3872
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:19,100
Um...

3873
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:22,320
And... uh...

3874
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,340
So like if you're a singer...

3875
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:26,160
Fucking do covers!

3876
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:29,560
Do so... do as many covers as you can!

3877
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:31,140
Original songs!

3878
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:33,300
If you're a really talented singer...

3879
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:35,040
Just do it!

3880
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:36,940
Because it's so good for your growth!

3881
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,280
It is really... it's just a lot of money invested!

3882
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:42,440
But if you want to market yourself as a singer...

3883
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:44,340
This is the way you have to go!

3884
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:46,060
Um...

3885
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,540
This is the way you have to go.

3886
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,360
You have to... you want to market yourself as that.

3887
02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:51,220
Uh... if singer then sing!

3888
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:52,040
Exactly!

3889
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:53,080
Exactly!

3890
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,320
Uh... so like...

3891
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,220
A lot of people that subscribe...

3892
02:07:57,660 --> 02:08:00,500
For like singers, they just want to hear the songs too.

3893
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:02,200
So you have to be aware though...

3894
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:03,480
That a lot of people...

3895
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,660
That subscribe to singers...

3896
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:07,600
Like singer and Vtubers...

3897
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:10,020
They just... they... they listen to the songs.

3898
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:11,260
They just hear and listen to the song.

3899
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:15,160
And they like put it on repeat over and over and over and over again.

3900
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:18,480
Um... but a lot of... but then there's a lot of Vtubers that got big!

3901
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:20,220
From singing cover songs!

3902
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:22,200
And it's good exposure!

3903
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,880
If you have good cover songs!

3904
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,120
There's so many like amazing...

3905
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:27,860
Cover song singers...

3906
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:30,300
That like... um... I love to listen to.

3907
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:32,560
That are... that are like...

3908
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:34,460
Big... big Vtubers now!

3909
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:35,260
Like Amelie!

3910
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:39,580
I have... I used to have... I have so many of her covers on my playlist!

3911
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:41,860
Before like she became a Vtuber!

3912
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:43,540
Before I became a Vtuber!

3913
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:45,440
I would listen to her songs all the time!

3914
02:08:45,660 --> 02:08:46,560
On my playlist!

3915
02:08:46,860 --> 02:08:48,440
Cause I love cover songs in general!

3916
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,400
I had so many like...

3917
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,980
I would primarily just listen to cover singers.

3918
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:56,940
Because I... I personally liked cover singers...

3919
02:08:56,940 --> 02:08:58,140
More than the original!

3920
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:02,140
And... there's like so many of that in my playlist!

3921
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:04,400
Uh... but yeah like I said just...

3922
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:05,420
Make songs!

3923
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:06,540
Alright!

3924
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:07,540
Branding!

3925
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:08,760
Okay this is like...

3926
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:09,780
It's really...

3927
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:12,180
Very like... in... like...

3928
02:09:12,180 --> 02:09:12,300
Ah!

3929
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:13,080
Simple slide!

3930
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:16,960
I feel like...

3931
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,140
This slide in general...

3932
02:09:18,140 --> 02:09:19,420
There's not really like...

3933
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:21,320
Much to say about it...

3934
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:23,040
But like branding wise...

3935
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:23,840
Like...

3936
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:26,860
I would say...

3937
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:29,760
100% this is what I believe in!

3938
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:31,760
This is 100% what I believe in!

3939
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:33,560
If you choose...

3940
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:36,560
If you are an animal Vtuber...

3941
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:39,780
It is the easiest when it comes to branding!

3942
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,540
Because like...

3943
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:43,680
Animal Vtubers...

3944
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,580
Are like...

3945
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:47,040
More recognizable than a human!

3946
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:48,520
I would say that!

3947
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:49,720
Because like...

3948
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:51,180
There's like traits in there...

3949
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:52,560
That are...

3950
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:54,280
Um...

3951
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:54,840
That...

3952
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:55,700
That are there!

3953
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:57,600
That makes you distinct...

3954
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:59,060
From like...

3955
02:09:59,060 --> 02:09:59,500
Uh...

3956
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:00,180
From like...

3957
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:01,220
Other Vtubers!

3958
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:03,640
Like you have like animal characteristics!

3959
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:04,840
All the...

3960
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:05,540
More...

3961
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:06,700
More famous Vtubers...

3962
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:08,100
Have like...

3963
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:09,820
Some animal characteristic...

3964
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:10,720
About them!

3965
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:12,640
Because you can do many things about it!

3966
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:13,960
You can like make them as like...

3967
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:14,180
You know...

3968
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:16,560
Their alternate form is the animal itself!

3969
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,860
Or like...

3970
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:18,580
You can make like...

3971
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:19,600
Merch wise stuff!

3972
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:20,260
Merch...

3973
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:22,280
Merch and everything is like...

3974
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:23,040
So good!

3975
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:23,520
Like...

3976
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,160
Regarding that!

3977
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:25,220
And...

3978
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:27,220
There's so many cat girls out there!

3979
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:28,000
So like...

3980
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:28,760
You have to be like...

3981
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:32,020
What makes you more distinct from all the other cat girls?

3982
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:32,820
You know?

3983
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:34,600
You have to have something...

3984
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:36,900
That makes you more distinct than the other cat girls!

3985
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:38,260
You have to have like...

3986
02:10:38,260 --> 02:10:38,560
A...

3987
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:39,900
A design trait!

3988
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,920
A unique silhouette!

3989
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:43,080
But you can't have too unique of a silhouette!

3990
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:44,260
Because people...

3991
02:10:44,260 --> 02:10:46,720
Don't like it when it's too fucking complicated!

3992
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:48,540
Um...

3993
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:49,900
Um...

3994
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:50,540
And then...

3995
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:53,360
An average viewer needs to be able to pick you out...

3996
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,120
Very easily!

3997
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:54,980
So...

3998
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:56,700
Branding is so very important!

3999
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:57,960
This is why I've been like...

4000
02:10:57,960 --> 02:10:58,600
I think I...

4001
02:10:58,600 --> 02:10:59,060
I don't know...

4002
02:10:59,060 --> 02:10:59,560
I'm fucking...

4003
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:00,880
I don't know what I'm gonna be doing!

4004
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:05,600
For my skin suit...

4005
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,980
I don't know man...

4006
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:11,200
That's how I feel...

4007
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,840
at the moment...

4008
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:13,840
But my...

4009
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,480
My new skin suit...

4010
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,080
I don't know...

4011
02:11:20,260 --> 02:11:22,500
I just hope like...

4012
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:22,980
My...

4013
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:23,720
It works.

4014
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:24,880
I hope it works.

4015
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:28,940
It was so hard figuring out branding.

4016
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:33,740
But like it's so important because like merch and stuff too.

4017
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:36,140
If you want... okay long-term branding.

4018
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:43,940
I would say long-term branding because like I know there's a lot of youtubers that like swap models or change their branding and stuff like that.

4019
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:48,580
But like if you want to... if you like...

4020
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:53,680
If you want to be more safe, you keep the same brand.

4021
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:58,300
I say that as I'm getting a new skin suit, but this like this brand is like really old.

4022
02:11:58,380 --> 02:12:00,900
So like I have an excuse to upgrade.

4023
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:11,620
Technically I sort of have an excuse to upgrade my branding because like...

4024
02:12:11,620 --> 02:12:14,660
This skin suit is very old.

4025
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:17,260
To be fair, my original branding is a tomato.

4026
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:18,100
So like...

4027
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:19,120
It still works.

4028
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:27,260
But like anyway, I would... to make it more simple and to make it like more... I guess like easier for you.

4029
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:38,900
If you already have a noticeable brand, I would suggest highly to keep the same brand.

4030
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:42,660
Because it's such a huge... that's why I'm scared.

4031
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:47,520
This is why I'm personally scared.

4032
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:49,280
I'm scared of my new skin suit.

4033
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:56,040
Because when you change brands, you don't know if people are gonna stay.

4034
02:12:56,240 --> 02:13:03,980
Because maybe your old brand was like very already very recognizable and people hate change.

4035
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,340
People really hate change.

4036
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:09,920
And it also helps for the normies sphere.

4037
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:13,300
Like average viewers outside of your community.

4038
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:17,760
Average like from...

4039
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:18,080
From the beginning.

4040
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:20,280
Outside of your community.

4041
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:22,140
That's like what's worrying.

4042
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:23,340
Because it's like...

4043
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:24,520
Oh you don't...

4044
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:26,060
When you see them, you're like who is that?

4045
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:29,440
You're like oh it's that person but they used to be this other person.

4046
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:30,840
Why do they look different now?

4047
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:31,860
Like stuff like that.

4048
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:33,020
Marketing wise...

4049
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:35,580
Marketing wise and like...

4050
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:36,320
Uh...

4051
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:36,940
Uh...

4052
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:38,480
Branding wise...

4053
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:39,620
Keeping the same one.

4054
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:41,820
I mean if you swap outfits, that's fine.

4055
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:44,020
But I meant like a full revamp.

4056
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:44,840
Is like...

4057
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:47,980
That's why like companies keep the same brand.

4058
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:50,480
Because consistency always is good.

4059
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:51,900
Because if you have some...

4060
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,360
You see that thing and you're like...

4061
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:54,260
Oh I recognize them.

4062
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:54,980
It's this person.

4063
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:56,160
Um...

4064
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:57,240
So...

4065
02:13:58,060 --> 02:13:59,880
So that's why like a lot of...

4066
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:02,220
That's why like in companies people keep the same brand.

4067
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:03,280
Um...

4068
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:06,640
And I would think like if you want to keep the same brand for your future.

4069
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:08,260
You stay the same brand.

4070
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,300
Like I know like maybe you're like...

4071
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:11,380
Oh but I want to be this next.

4072
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:12,020
But like...

4073
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:14,120
If you want to play it very safe.

4074
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:16,700
Um...

4075
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:17,600
If you want to...

4076
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:19,040
Keep it very safe.

4077
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:19,800
Um...

4078
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:20,920
And you don't want to take risk.

4079
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,200
This is like the best way to do it.

4080
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:23,780
Like...

4081
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,000
This is the best way.

4082
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:27,220
Like if you don't want to take any risk.

4083
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:30,260
And like you don't know if the viewership will stay the same.

4084
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:30,900
Like type deal.

4085
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:33,580
Okay.

4086
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:35,740
Management and organization.

4087
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:37,060
Alright.

4088
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:39,600
Don't just hire anybody.

4089
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:41,040
To be a manager.

4090
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:45,340
It's so fucking stressful if you have the bad manager.

4091
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:47,500
If you have like not a great manager.

4092
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:49,720
If you want to hire somebody.

4093
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:51,700
Do not hire close friends.

4094
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:54,860
Never mix business and relationships together.

4095
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:56,280
It's never good.

4096
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:01,640
I would highly...

4097
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:05,160
Highly suggest you do not hire close friends.

4098
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:06,180
Or any friend.

4099
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,360
Like...

4100
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:07,740
Like...

4101
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:09,120
Oh my god.

4102
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:11,300
Do not hire close friends.

4103
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:12,900
Okay guys.

4104
02:15:13,660 --> 02:15:14,840
Don't mix...

4105
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:17,480
It's always a rule to never mix business.

4106
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:18,240
With relations.

4107
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:20,580
It's not great.

4108
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:23,500
If you have the opportunity to hire a manager.

4109
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:25,620
Just don't do that.

4110
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,180
Hire somebody.

4111
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:29,680
Look into someone with actual business experience.

4112
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:31,600
This is when you are getting bigger.

4113
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,860
As an indie.

4114
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:34,240
Obviously when you start out.

4115
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:36,200
You don't have managers.

4116
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:37,300
You do this all yourself.

4117
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:39,040
And so you have to...

4118
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:39,960
If you are starting out.

4119
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:42,340
Be sure to know how to read contracts.

4120
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:45,320
Don't let people walk over you when you are negotiating.

4121
02:15:45,820 --> 02:15:47,460
And don't let people like...

4122
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:48,300
Say...

4123
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:48,660
Like...

4124
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,120
Like...

4125
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:53,540
Don't get scammed into signing a very predatory contract.

4126
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:55,200
When it comes to like...

4127
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:56,840
Sponsors and deals.

4128
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:59,320
Because there is a lot of them out there.

4129
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:01,140
So like...

4130
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:01,380
You know.

4131
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:03,340
You want to do like a brand deal or a sponsor.

4132
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:08,720
You have to be sure you sign something that you really want to do.

4133
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:10,360
And you don't get like...

4134
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:14,880
Sucked into a contract that will fuck you over.

4135
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,440
In terms of like...

4136
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,300
Sponsors or merch and stuff like that.

4137
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:20,360
And that's like...

4138
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:21,100
As an indie.

4139
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:22,420
As an indie.

4140
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:23,400
You...

4141
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:26,020
There is like a lot of those as an indie.

4142
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:26,980
So like...

4143
02:16:26,980 --> 02:16:30,840
You have to be able to read these types of contracts if you don't have a manager.

4144
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:32,160
Because...

4145
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:35,140
But that is why you also get a manager to avoid these things.

4146
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:37,720
A lot of emails that come to me.

4147
02:16:37,980 --> 02:16:38,960
Regarding like...

4148
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:40,540
Opportunities and stuff.

4149
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:43,800
My management reads those emails for me.

4150
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:45,020
To make sure.

4151
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:46,000
That like...

4152
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,260
Before they...

4153
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:48,120
Before they...

4154
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:49,460
The emails get to me.

4155
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,000
It gets like...

4156
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,360
Pre-reg by my management team.

4157
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:54,640
So like...

4158
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:56,880
I don't have to deal with the bad ones.

4159
02:16:57,180 --> 02:17:00,200
So I can just say yes or no on the good ones already.

4160
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:01,100
That I get.

4161
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:01,940
Like...

4162
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:05,280
But yes.

4163
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:06,560
Get a business lawyer.

4164
02:17:06,660 --> 02:17:07,840
If you want to be more serious.

4165
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:09,120
Get a business lawyer.

4166
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:09,940
Yeah.

4167
02:17:09,980 --> 02:17:10,780
They get screened.

4168
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:11,680
The emails get screened.

4169
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:13,160
So I'm sure that like...

4170
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:15,000
I will not be getting the ones that...

4171
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:15,700
That are like...

4172
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:16,340
Predatory.

4173
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:17,500
Um...

4174
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:19,120
But yeah.

4175
02:17:19,220 --> 02:17:19,600
Anyway.

4176
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:20,440
But yes.

4177
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:21,660
Get a business lawyer.

4178
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:23,440
To look through the contract.

4179
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:25,860
To make sure everything is okay.

4180
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:28,060
Um...

4181
02:17:28,060 --> 02:17:29,460
Have a business email.

4182
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:32,520
And put it on your Twitter bio and streamer platform.

4183
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,740
Don't think it's just gonna walk to you.

4184
02:17:34,940 --> 02:17:37,380
Have a business email out there.

4185
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:38,440
Very direct.

4186
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:39,360
It's there.

4187
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:42,020
So you can get the emails instantly.

4188
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:43,600
So like...

4189
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:44,480
And also...

4190
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:45,580
Um...

4191
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:49,020
Make sure the business email is like a little bit professional.

4192
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:54,180
Yeah.

4193
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:57,020
Just a little bit professional.

4194
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:59,100
I mean mine is Doki Kenrin.

4195
02:17:59,400 --> 02:17:59,980
But yes.

4196
02:18:00,020 --> 02:18:00,440
Also...

4197
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:00,580
Yeah.

4198
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:01,540
That stuff.

4199
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:03,020
But also like...

4200
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:03,400
Um...

4201
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:05,300
Have a pitch deck made.

4202
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:07,120
I think it's a very good investment.

4203
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:08,880
If you want to chase sponsors.

4204
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:12,380
If you want to like have sponsors like...

4205
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:12,900
Um...

4206
02:18:12,900 --> 02:18:17,080
If you want to like approach sponsors and brand deals.

4207
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:20,480
Have your own like portfolio and pitch deck made.

4208
02:18:20,780 --> 02:18:22,700
So like when you send it to them.

4209
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:25,080
Like they can just see your analytics and everything.

4210
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:25,900
So like...

4211
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:27,900
Just make sure you have those together.

4212
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:30,720
Also I saw like some people asking me like...

4213
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:33,820
Oh what about like projects when you're organizing your project and stuff like that.

4214
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:35,540
Like I talked about this earlier.

4215
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:36,680
But like...

4216
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:37,380
Um...

4217
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:38,860
There's not really a whole...

4218
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:41,400
Way I really do it.

4219
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:42,440
That's like special.

4220
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:43,900
At best...

4221
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:48,260
I have a lot of multiple projects going on and stuff.

4222
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:49,360
So...

4223
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:50,120
Um...

4224
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:50,540
I...

4225
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:56,320
Because I have the opportunity to host and produce a lot of projects.

4226
02:18:56,900 --> 02:18:57,820
Um...

4227
02:18:58,400 --> 02:18:59,000
I...

4228
02:18:59,000 --> 02:18:59,700
Um...

4229
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:01,320
I am able to...

4230
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:02,200
Uh...

4231
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:04,940
Delegate a project leader.

4232
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:07,240
That runs the project.

4233
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:09,460
Mostly like...

4234
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:10,480
Everyth...

4235
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:13,920
The project leader will talk to me about what's going on.

4236
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:18,440
And then I also look into the server to see like what's going on as well.

4237
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,400
I look into the server and be like...

4238
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:20,660
Okay.

4239
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:22,900
Seems like everything is going well.

4240
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:27,180
But then the project leader will be responsible with making sure everything goes on track.

4241
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:28,480
Everything is on track.

4242
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:30,400
And everything is like...

4243
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:31,020
Um...

4244
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:31,520
Going well.

4245
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:34,300
They obviously get paid more because they're the project leader.

4246
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:36,200
Um...

4247
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:37,140
Also like...

4248
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:38,940
The way is that I give updates.

4249
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:39,860
I give server updates.

4250
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:40,400
And be like...

4251
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:41,200
Oh here's the news.

4252
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:42,360
What's going to happen.

4253
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:42,940
And like...

4254
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:44,020
Here are the new requirements.

4255
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:45,040
Here's what I need.

4256
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:46,120
Like I would give updates.

4257
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:49,240
But the project leader makes sure everything goes well.

4258
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:50,200
And keeps on track.

4259
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:51,940
Also please...

4260
02:19:51,940 --> 02:19:55,220
Don't rely on Twitter DMs or Discord DMs.

4261
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:57,240
Make a Discord server if you're doing a project.

4262
02:19:57,700 --> 02:19:58,720
You have to have...

4263
02:19:58,720 --> 02:19:59,580
Make sure everything...

4264
02:19:59,580 --> 02:20:00,100
Cause like...

4265
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:00,760
Oh my god.

4266
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:04,660
It's so confusing when you have so many DMs everywhere.

4267
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:06,880
Have a Discord server.

4268
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:08,100
Of...

4269
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:09,600
So you can keep track of everything.

4270
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:12,100
I will show you an example of my Discord servers.

4271
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:13,400
Um...

4272
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:13,900
Bam!

4273
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:15,120
Here you go.

4274
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:18,080
This is how my Discord server goes.

4275
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:20,680
On the left is my...

4276
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:22,060
Me and my management team.

4277
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:24,780
On the right is my editing team.

4278
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:26,640
And animators.

4279
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:27,960
I also have animators too.

4280
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:30,740
So this is how I organize my Discord server.

4281
02:20:32,380 --> 02:20:32,860
Um...

4282
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:34,680
This is how the Discord server is done.

4283
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:35,540
So you see like...

4284
02:20:35,540 --> 02:20:37,860
Here are all the important things that I have.

4285
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:40,340
And then on the right you can see like...

4286
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:41,320
Oh hey, for editing.

4287
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:42,200
Here are the rules.

4288
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:43,440
Here's my editing rules.

4289
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:44,640
What I want the clips to have.

4290
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:45,740
Um...

4291
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:47,820
The general stuff where people want to talk in general.

4292
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:49,600
Assets that I give them.

4293
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:51,040
Regarding like PNGs.

4294
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:51,540
Stuff like that.

4295
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:56,380
Timestamp claims so the editors won't fucking like overlap each other with timestamps.

4296
02:20:56,460 --> 02:20:57,440
Like if they're clipping something.

4297
02:20:58,280 --> 02:20:59,400
From clip downloads.

4298
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:00,060
So like...

4299
02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:01,340
When they're finished with a clip.

4300
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:03,280
They just plop the links.

4301
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:04,120
There.

4302
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:05,960
They just plop the links there.

4303
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:07,020
For me to download.

4304
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:09,780
And then if they have any editing thing they need to ask.

4305
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:10,760
They just put it there.

4306
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,180
And then I have private channels with each individual editor.

4307
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,520
So if they want to ask me anything privately.

4308
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:19,220
That's not within like other...

4309
02:21:19,220 --> 02:21:20,120
If other...

4310
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:21,060
If other people...

4311
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:22,240
They don't want other people to see.

4312
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:25,740
They talk to me in the private chat.

4313
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:29,580
Everything is in like...

4314
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:32,940
Is organized in a way so that um...

4315
02:21:33,540 --> 02:21:36,320
Is organized in a way so that like...

4316
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:37,640
Uh...

4317
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:37,960
Uh...

4318
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:38,480
In the...

4319
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:38,820
Like...

4320
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:40,480
It's just automated type deal.

4321
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:41,500
It's just very organized.

4322
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:42,300
And like...

4323
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:43,560
I know where things are.

4324
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:47,820
And...

4325
02:21:47,820 --> 02:21:50,440
And that's how I organize my stuff.

4326
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,280
Cause I just...

4327
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:52,220
We need to be sure.

4328
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:54,460
That everything is in a way.

4329
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:56,160
That I can easily like...

4330
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:57,020
Look at it.

4331
02:21:57,140 --> 02:21:57,900
So like...

4332
02:21:57,900 --> 02:21:59,020
Especially like payment.

4333
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:00,100
I tell them...

4334
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:01,520
To tell me about payment.

4335
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:02,920
In our private chat.

4336
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:14,480
That people watch my videos.

4337
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:15,400
This is so much fun.

4338
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:20,120
That's my home, this is myって This is...

4339
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:20,400
Well, um...

4340
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:23,940
Uh...

4341
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:25,380
Well, yeah...

4342
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:28,920
Everyone was like...

4343
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:29,440
Ah...

4344
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:29,880
Keeping the culture.

4345
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:30,020
Keep the culture.

4346
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:31,400
Keep them classy.

4347
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:39,880
It's just better this way.

4348
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:47,380
Shoutout to my management team for helping with the organization of the server itself.

4349
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:51,160
Because it was not this neat before.

4350
02:22:51,460 --> 02:22:54,920
I gave a general template on how I want the server to be like.

4351
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:56,880
And then they made it more organized.

4352
02:22:56,880 --> 02:23:01,300
So the left side is where me and my management team live.

4353
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:05,720
The right side is the editing team.

4354
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:07,840
Editing and animators.

4355
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:16,840
I combined the Doki Bytes animators into the same Discord server.

4356
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:24,440
So I don't have to worry about more than one.

4357
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:26,720
Also the editors and the animators.

4358
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:28,760
Don't overlap each other in terms of clip moments.

4359
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:30,000
Because I have a rule.

4360
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:33,340
And I said that I told them for the animators and editing team.

4361
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:36,080
I do not want repeats.

4362
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:37,840
I don't want repeats.

4363
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:45,560
So like the animator and the editor teams have to be sure they don't animate or clip the same thing.

4364
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:47,240
And that's why I combined them together.

4365
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:49,500
So yeah.

4366
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,760
So that is how like everything is done.

4367
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:55,520
The reason we're not using Slack is because...

4368
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:58,040
We can't be bothered.

4369
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:04,640
That is why me and my management team are not using Slack.

4370
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:06,260
We can't be bothered.

4371
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:07,600
So we're using Discord.

4372
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:14,420
Alright.

4373
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:18,020
General tips I've tried to follow.

4374
02:24:18,220 --> 02:24:20,120
These are my own way of streaming.

4375
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,560
This is how I go about in terms of my own way of streaming.

4376
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:26,740
First off.

4377
02:24:27,380 --> 02:24:27,900
Next.

4378
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:28,060
Next.

4379
02:24:28,060 --> 02:24:31,340
A lot of people were saying like, oh how do you like deal with...

4380
02:24:31,340 --> 02:24:34,560
How do you deal with like...

4381
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:38,060
Losing topics and stuff.

4382
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:41,060
Like topics and stuff.

4383
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:42,340
Like dead air.

4384
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:45,620
I actually keep a list of topics I want to talk about on stream.

4385
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,820
Every time I think of something I want to talk about, like...

4386
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:52,440
If I have dead air.

4387
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:55,640
If I think I have dead... I'm going to have dead air.

4388
02:24:55,640 --> 02:25:01,480
I have a channel where I type random topics throughout the day.

4389
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:04,800
And then I would just pull that up if I have to.

4390
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:06,820
I don't use it all the time.

4391
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:08,680
I don't use it all the time.

4392
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:12,260
If I think I have dead air, if I don't know what I'm going to talk about.

4393
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:14,700
I would just pull it up and be like, oh yeah!

4394
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:16,700
I'd be like, oh my god guys, I just remembered.

4395
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:17,540
Did you guys know?

4396
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:18,300
Blah blah blah blah blah.

4397
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:20,400
Like, that's really it.

4398
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:22,280
But I don't do that all the time.

4399
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:23,440
I don't do that all the time.

4400
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:24,760
I do it like, maybe like...

4401
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:26,680
Once every two to three weeks.

4402
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:28,100
Because I'm so used to streaming now.

4403
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:30,040
This was like back then.

4404
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:32,060
When I was first starting out.

4405
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:33,960
When I was first starting out.

4406
02:25:34,180 --> 02:25:35,940
And I was not very good at tangents.

4407
02:25:36,020 --> 02:25:39,000
In terms of like, I don't know what to talk about.

4408
02:25:40,380 --> 02:25:40,740
And...

4409
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:42,260
I would make sure I write stuff down.

4410
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:44,340
So I would write bullet points.

4411
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:46,080
So I would write bear hibernation.

4412
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:47,180
Stuff like that.

4413
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:48,380
Just to make sure I remember.

4414
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:50,760
So like, I would just write one bullet point.

4415
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:52,980
And then I'd be like, I remember exactly the topic.

4416
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:53,840
I'd be like, oh yeah!

4417
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:54,740
Blah blah blah blah.

4418
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:55,920
You know, stuff like that.

4419
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,300
But it's basically for people who are just starting out.

4420
02:25:59,380 --> 02:26:00,680
And like, are not very good at talking.

4421
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:03,300
And it's because I'm so used to talking now.

4422
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:05,580
That like, I don't really use it anymore.

4423
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:06,860
But I still put it...

4424
02:26:06,860 --> 02:26:08,120
I write it down out of habit.

4425
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:09,240
Habit.

4426
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:14,840
If you are a variety streamer.

4427
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:16,380
If you are a variety streamer.

4428
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:17,640
This is what I do.

4429
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:19,240
This is my own personal opinion.

4430
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:20,200
This is my own personal opinion.

4431
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:22,680
I tend to keep long playthroughs.

4432
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:23,940
3-4 streams max.

4433
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:25,740
Because the longer the series.

4434
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:27,480
The less viewership it's gonna get.

4435
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:31,660
Which is because our attention is really fucked now.

4436
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:33,680
Which is because our attention is really fucked now.

4437
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:34,740
This is for if you're a YouTuber.

4438
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,540
If you're a Twitch streamer.

4439
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:37,640
It's different.

4440
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,520
If you're a Twitch streamer.

4441
02:26:41,540 --> 02:26:43,160
It's like, really different.

4442
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:44,380
It's like, really different.

4443
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:45,020
Because like...

4444
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:47,820
You know, like I said before.

4445
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:50,740
People don't know when you're gonna stream whatever.

4446
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:52,480
So they always show up.

4447
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:54,060
And they'll be like, oh where are we gonna get today?

4448
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:55,960
But if you're a YouTube streamer.

4449
02:26:56,180 --> 02:26:59,160
I usually keep it 3-4 streams.

4450
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:02,160
Just because like, I know.

4451
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:04,180
By the time it hits the 4th stream.

4452
02:27:05,060 --> 02:27:06,460
Like, the viewership.

4453
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:07,680
Will decline even harder.

4454
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:10,080
It's just gonna go lower and lower and lower.

4455
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:12,600
So like, that is why I try to keep it.

4456
02:27:12,660 --> 02:27:13,460
3-4 streams.

4457
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:15,980
So...

4458
02:27:15,980 --> 02:27:17,680
It's just so...

4459
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:19,700
It's just to keep the attention span.

4460
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:21,740
Like still there.

4461
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:24,020
But this is what I do.

4462
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:24,580
Like I said.

4463
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:26,800
It's all like my personal experience.

4464
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:30,540
If you wanna work with artists that are not English speaking.

4465
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:33,780
Get a translator.

4466
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:35,820
I've had this experience before.

4467
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:39,160
I wanted to work with an artist that didn't speak English.

4468
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:42,260
And I wrote in English.

4469
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:44,240
But I also wrote my...

4470
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:45,400
Translated...

4471
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:47,060
Like my translation as well.

4472
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:48,940
But then they were like, oh sorry.

4473
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:51,820
We only work with people who speak it natively.

4474
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:52,240
Like fluently.

4475
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:54,460
Because they didn't wanna deal with like...

4476
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:55,280
Issues.

4477
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:58,400
If you didn't like the art and they don't understand what you want changed.

4478
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:00,740
There's like translation issues.

4479
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:01,900
And stuff like that.

4480
02:28:03,140 --> 02:28:04,760
DeepL is your friend.

4481
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,360
If you wanna actually use a translator.

4482
02:28:07,640 --> 02:28:08,940
But I would highly suggest...

4483
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:10,980
Talking...

4484
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:12,260
With a translator.

4485
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:14,180
Getting an actual translator.

4486
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:16,540
That's fluent in the language.

4487
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:17,900
Or...

4488
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:19,660
Use DeepL.

4489
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:24,700
But let the artist know that you're using a translation software.

4490
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:26,620
Because you don't wanna like...

4491
02:28:26,620 --> 02:28:28,620
Lie and be like I'm actually fluent.

4492
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,580
Or you're using a translation tool.

4493
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:36,260
But yes.

4494
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:38,960
I would highly suggest getting a translator.

4495
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:39,720
To help you.

4496
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:42,580
It is much better.

4497
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,620
In the long run.

4498
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:46,840
And it's a lot more convenient for you.

4499
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:48,420
Like to get what you want.

4500
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:49,740
But...

4501
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:52,420
Have a consistent time block.

4502
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:54,420
People love consistency.

4503
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:56,000
People love...

4504
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,840
You being consistent.

4505
02:28:58,700 --> 02:29:01,280
That is why I have two set time blocks.

4506
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:03,740
12.30 pm PST.

4507
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:05,560
And 5 pm PST.

4508
02:29:05,700 --> 02:29:06,900
That is my time block.

4509
02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:08,300
And that's what people know.

4510
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:10,860
People know that you stream around those times.

4511
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:12,420
Consistency is key.

4512
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:14,740
Always have a dedicated time block.

4513
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,260
For whatever you stream.

4514
02:29:16,260 --> 02:29:17,940
Don't stream random hours all the time.

4515
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:19,800
Because your audience will not know what to do.

4516
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:21,220
They'll be like what the fuck.

4517
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:23,800
What time do I show up?

4518
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:24,580
I don't know.

4519
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:25,640
They're always different.

4520
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:28,040
Get a consistent time block.

4521
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:29,440
Even on Twitch.

4522
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:33,020
The thing about Twitch is that even if they don't have a set...

4523
02:29:33,020 --> 02:29:34,680
A set plan.

4524
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:36,040
They are consistent.

4525
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:37,660
With what time they stream at.

4526
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:40,160
So like...

4527
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,460
Always be consistent.

4528
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:42,640
It's always the key.

4529
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:45,160
Have mods.

4530
02:29:46,260 --> 02:29:47,280
Don't self moderate.

4531
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:48,620
It's not great.

4532
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:54,700
And have them be like...

4533
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:56,000
Mostly silent.

4534
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:57,120
But like...

4535
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,900
If they want to interject they can.

4536
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:00,740
But like...

4537
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:03,200
We don't want a mod to spam the chat.

4538
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:04,720
Just be like...

4539
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,340
My mods...

4540
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:10,800
I have 3 mods working in this chat.

4541
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:12,600
Um...

4542
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:13,660
And like...

4543
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:15,160
They all have second accounts.

4544
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:18,440
Their mod account is actually...

4545
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:19,540
Their second account.

4546
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:21,460
So like...

4547
02:30:21,460 --> 02:30:24,260
The real mods...

4548
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:26,760
The real accounts...

4549
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:27,920
Is among you.

4550
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:32,860
It could be any of you guys.

4551
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:34,080
It could be any of you guys.

4552
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:36,120
It could be any of you guys.

4553
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:37,300
So they don't have to...

4554
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:39,180
They don't have to worry.

4555
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:41,760
They can actually talk to you guys.

4556
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:42,460
They can actually talk to you guys.

4557
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:43,280
Uh...

4558
02:30:45,880 --> 02:30:47,960
It could be any of you guys.

4559
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:49,660
So they have 2 accounts.

4560
02:30:49,900 --> 02:30:51,340
One for moderating.

4561
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:52,300
And one to chat.

4562
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:53,100
Like...

4563
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:55,320
Be just like a regular dragoon.

4564
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:00,260
I'm the mod smile.

4565
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:02,620
Message received.

4566
02:31:02,820 --> 02:31:04,240
Have all your mods be...

4567
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:05,340
Silently.

4568
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:06,340
Thank you for the super chat.

4569
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:06,760
Thank you.

4570
02:31:08,740 --> 02:31:09,860
But yes.

4571
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:11,980
I have them mostly silent.

4572
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:14,240
Because I don't want to cause any issues.

4573
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:15,480
And that is why...

4574
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:16,680
They are mostly silent.

4575
02:31:17,580 --> 02:31:18,020
Um...

4576
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:19,520
Also...

4577
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:22,940
Please make a business paypal.

4578
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:24,240
And set up a business account.

4579
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:25,600
Long run.

4580
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:27,320
If you want to make this a long term career.

4581
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,020
It would be so good for you.

4582
02:31:29,160 --> 02:31:30,340
Just remember that.

4583
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:33,820
Please remember to set everything up as a business.

4584
02:31:34,460 --> 02:31:35,940
Because this is your career now.

4585
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:37,620
If this is what you want to do as a career.

4586
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:42,100
So...

4587
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:43,620
So...

4588
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:44,180
Uh...

4589
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:45,420
So yeah.

4590
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:49,300
That is basically one of my general tips to follow.

4591
02:31:49,580 --> 02:31:51,220
If you want to...

4592
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:54,320
If you want to see what is going on behind my fucking brain.

4593
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:55,320
Alright.

4594
02:31:55,420 --> 02:31:55,980
Merch.

4595
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:59,140
Very important as an indie.

4596
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:01,320
I would say...

4597
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:02,220
Merch.

4598
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,620
I did not realize how much merch matters.

4599
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:06,620
Until recently.

4600
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:08,540
Like for an indie.

4601
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:09,280
And it is like...

4602
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:12,980
A lot of income can come from merch.

4603
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:15,340
And...

4604
02:32:15,340 --> 02:32:16,320
Um...

4605
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:18,060
And...

4606
02:32:19,220 --> 02:32:19,820
Basically...

4607
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:21,880
I...

4608
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:24,000
If you want to do your own merch.

4609
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:26,840
If you want to handle the whole merch yourself.

4610
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,720
And not want to look at distributors.

4611
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:32,160
Alibaba is your friend.

4612
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:37,420
Alibaba is a great website to look for manufacturers.

4613
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:37,600
Alibaba is a great website to look for manufacturers.

4614
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:40,820
It is a good manufacturer website.

4615
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:42,300
It is a good manufacturer website.

4616
02:32:42,300 --> 02:32:42,540
Um...

4617
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:44,340
The thing is...

4618
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:45,420
When you are looking...

4619
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:47,480
When you are researching manufacturers yourself.

4620
02:32:48,320 --> 02:32:51,560
You have to research the samples.

4621
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:53,280
And...

4622
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:55,860
You have to look at like...

4623
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:56,420
Samples.

4624
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:58,040
And like...

4625
02:32:58,040 --> 02:32:59,000
Uh...

4626
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,400
What else is there?

4627
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:02,880
And...

4628
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,640
Oh fuck.

4629
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:04,120
Okay.

4630
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:04,860
I don't remember.

4631
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:05,140
Okay.

4632
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:05,800
And you have to like...

4633
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:09,420
Um...

4634
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:12,300
There is other manufacturer websites to look at.

4635
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:13,620
There is a lot of them.

4636
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,700
And there is like ones in like...

4637
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:17,300
America and stuff like that.

4638
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:18,500
Ones in like Canada.

4639
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:20,960
Some in Japan and stuff like that.

4640
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:23,460
A lot of them are like...

4641
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:24,100
On websites.

4642
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,920
Similar to like...

4643
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:27,480
Uh...

4644
02:33:28,580 --> 02:33:29,680
Different type.

4645
02:33:29,740 --> 02:33:31,420
There is like lots of websites...

4646
02:33:31,420 --> 02:33:32,520
For this too.

4647
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,280
Um...

4648
02:33:34,900 --> 02:33:36,600
The thing is...

4649
02:33:37,620 --> 02:33:37,820
Um...

4650
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:41,020
It's really hard to find a manufacturer...

4651
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:42,760
That you want to work with.

4652
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:45,020
Because you have to look at sample size.

4653
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:47,660
You have to look at samples...

4654
02:33:47,660 --> 02:33:50,280
And like make sure you are not getting scammed.

4655
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:51,120
Of course.

4656
02:33:51,300 --> 02:33:52,320
Not getting scammed.

4657
02:33:52,580 --> 02:33:54,500
And the quality is what you want.

4658
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:57,860
Obviously the more you pay...

4659
02:33:57,860 --> 02:33:59,920
For a manufacturer...

4660
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:01,640
The more expensive...

4661
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:03,860
The more expensive things are gonna get...

4662
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:04,500
To be made.

4663
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:05,740
And the more expensive...

4664
02:34:05,740 --> 02:34:07,320
Things are gonna get to be sold.

4665
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:10,140
But the quality is a lot better.

4666
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,360
Um...

4667
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:14,160
So...

4668
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:16,620
You have to be able to pick and choose.

4669
02:34:17,940 --> 02:34:18,460
Uh...

4670
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:20,180
You have to be able to like...

4671
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:23,120
Make sure that is what you want to work with.

4672
02:34:24,220 --> 02:34:24,740
Uh...

4673
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:26,200
Anyway...

4674
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,340
Making your own merch.

4675
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:29,680
I was very luckily...

4676
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:31,200
I was an artist ally.

4677
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:33,240
I did artist ally a lot.

4678
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:35,620
And I sold art.

4679
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:37,420
Um... at conventions.

4680
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:40,860
So there is a lot of things you can do to make your own merch.

4681
02:34:41,220 --> 02:34:41,660
Yay!

4682
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:48,420
Like these are things...

4683
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:49,080
You can do yourself.

4684
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:51,020
You don't have to get a manufacturer.

4685
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:54,140
You can just do this yourself as a smaller indie.

4686
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:57,400
You can just do this yourself as a smaller indie.

4687
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:58,900
And still have merch for your fans.

4688
02:35:00,180 --> 02:35:00,860
Button makers.

4689
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:03,660
They are 150 to 300 US dollars.

4690
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:06,460
Including the materials.

4691
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:09,080
So like...

4692
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:10,560
It's just a button press.

4693
02:35:10,700 --> 02:35:10,900
You...

4694
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:14,620
You print out the artwork you want to make into a button.

4695
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:15,940
And then...

4696
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:18,500
You commission an artist to make a button design.

4697
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:20,240
And then you print it out.

4698
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:21,100
That's it.

4699
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:22,640
And then you fucking...

4700
02:35:23,740 --> 02:35:24,240
Done.

4701
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:26,660
And that's how you make a button.

4702
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:30,060
You can sell them for like 2 to 4 dollars.

4703
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:31,800
Depending on how big the button is.

4704
02:35:32,300 --> 02:35:33,160
And then...

4705
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:36,740
You can make the eventsment back.

4706
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:39,180
Printing your own stickers.

4707
02:35:39,620 --> 02:35:40,400
Sticker paper.

4708
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:42,480
That's a thing.

4709
02:35:44,480 --> 02:35:46,140
Sticker papers are a thing.

4710
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:46,840
Or...

4711
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:47,940
You can fucking...

4712
02:35:47,940 --> 02:35:50,460
There's like local printing shops that make stickers.

4713
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,860
That you can just like...

4714
02:35:52,860 --> 02:35:53,620
You know...

4715
02:35:53,620 --> 02:35:56,820
Order online or order like from a shop.

4716
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:58,600
From your local mom and pop shop.

4717
02:35:58,940 --> 02:35:59,860
Or like...

4718
02:35:59,860 --> 02:36:00,460
I don't know...

4719
02:36:00,460 --> 02:36:00,820
Walmart.

4720
02:36:05,100 --> 02:36:09,060
I used to cut my own stickers when I first started out in artist alley.

4721
02:36:09,320 --> 02:36:10,980
And I still made money from that.

4722
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:12,960
And they're good and...

4723
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:14,340
They make money.

4724
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:16,860
And then printing your own...

4725
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:19,700
Post-art cards and prints at a local store.

4726
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:21,800
That works.

4727
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:23,460
You don't have to worry.

4728
02:36:24,820 --> 02:36:25,720
It's like...

4729
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:27,480
You can do that as your own merch.

4730
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:29,100
Anyway...

4731
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:30,500
If you're gonna work with distributors...

4732
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:33,280
Obviously they're gonna take a cut of your money.

4733
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:34,480
Because you're working with them.

4734
02:36:34,500 --> 02:36:36,480
They're gonna be like...

4735
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:38,440
Doing the whole thing for you.

4736
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:40,820
Like the researching manufacturers.

4737
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:42,700
Um...

4738
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:43,700
You know...

4739
02:36:43,700 --> 02:36:45,440
Researching manufacturers and...

4740
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:49,080
Making sure like the quality and stuff like that.

4741
02:36:49,420 --> 02:36:50,100
But...

4742
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:53,040
You gotta research and read the contract very thoroughly.

4743
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:54,500
I would highly suggest...

4744
02:36:54,500 --> 02:36:56,840
Not going with one that's a startup.

4745
02:36:57,360 --> 02:36:58,500
Because like...

4746
02:36:58,500 --> 02:36:59,300
For distributors.

4747
02:36:59,380 --> 02:37:02,880
And ones that have experience distributing stuff.

4748
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:04,480
Because...

4749
02:37:04,500 --> 02:37:06,440
It's out of your hands.

4750
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:07,120
When...

4751
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:09,220
Because you're not part of the process.

4752
02:37:09,860 --> 02:37:10,460
And...

4753
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:14,240
Honestly it's better to...

4754
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:16,320
Work with somebody that has experience...

4755
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:17,220
Distributing stuff.

4756
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:19,160
Because shipping things is a lot of work.

4757
02:37:20,060 --> 02:37:21,460
I've done shipping...

4758
02:37:21,460 --> 02:37:22,440
I ship stuff myself.

4759
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:24,900
And it's a lot of work.

4760
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:27,460
And it's not that easy.

4761
02:37:28,220 --> 02:37:30,300
I run my own...

4762
02:37:30,300 --> 02:37:32,440
I run my own...

4763
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:34,120
Thing all by myself.

4764
02:37:34,500 --> 02:37:36,780
It doesn't mean I'm gonna do that forever though.

4765
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:37,780
It doesn't mean.

4766
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:38,620
And I'm not...

4767
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:41,060
And I'm like very open to like...

4768
02:37:41,060 --> 02:37:43,240
Maybe if I find a distributor I'd like...

4769
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:45,680
I can give them a percentage cut.

4770
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:48,980
I do it myself because I wanna keep majority of the earnings.

4771
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:50,400
Um...

4772
02:37:50,400 --> 02:37:52,020
Because I know how to do it.

4773
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:53,560
And I have experience doing it.

4774
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:55,640
And that is why I handle...

4775
02:37:55,640 --> 02:37:58,740
I handle like everything myself regarding merch.

4776
02:37:59,080 --> 02:38:00,100
I know other...

4777
02:38:00,100 --> 02:38:02,020
Vtubers that do it as well.

4778
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:03,320
Not just me.

4779
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:04,300
Because I've talked to...

4780
02:38:04,300 --> 02:38:07,120
I recently was talking to somebody regarding merch stuff.

4781
02:38:07,240 --> 02:38:09,040
Because we were like exchanging our...

4782
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:10,060
Our manufacturers.

4783
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:12,560
We were exchanging like...

4784
02:38:12,560 --> 02:38:14,940
Info of each other and stuff.

4785
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:16,460
Regarding like...

4786
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:19,880
Manufacturers and like...

4787
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:20,620
Um...

4788
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:21,900
Oh like...

4789
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:23,080
What's the word?

4790
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:25,220
Oh... fuck.

4791
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:29,480
Just being like...

4792
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:29,820
Oh yeah.

4793
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:30,660
You do...

4794
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:32,540
What's this?

4795
02:38:32,680 --> 02:38:34,420
Well I wanna try producing this later too.

4796
02:38:34,660 --> 02:38:37,000
So then we were exchanging information with each other.

4797
02:38:37,140 --> 02:38:39,220
So we can build up our knowledge and stuff.

4798
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:41,200
Uh... so that's like...

4799
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:41,860
That's a good thing.

4800
02:38:41,980 --> 02:38:44,600
If you have like friends with somebody that also makes merch.

4801
02:38:45,220 --> 02:38:47,060
Uh... talk to them about it.

4802
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:49,980
And like... like exchange information with each other.

4803
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:52,540
That's why I don't like gate keeping information.

4804
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:54,180
I like be like...

4805
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:56,100
Oh yeah I'm planning on doing this.

4806
02:38:56,220 --> 02:38:57,800
Like oh what are you gonna be doing?

4807
02:38:57,980 --> 02:38:58,720
And stuff like that.

4808
02:38:58,720 --> 02:38:59,380
And then be like...

4809
02:38:59,380 --> 02:39:03,100
Oh yeah I wanna look for a manufacturer that does this as well.

4810
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:04,720
And stuff like that.

4811
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:06,480
Um...

4812
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:08,580
So that's what...

4813
02:39:08,580 --> 02:39:10,260
That's what I try to do.

4814
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:11,840
I realized...

4815
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:15,320
I realized I forgot a slide.

4816
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:16,020
So...

4817
02:39:16,020 --> 02:39:18,400
Let me download this slide.

4818
02:39:18,520 --> 02:39:19,700
They're all PNGs.

4819
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:23,060
I realized I forgot...

4820
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:25,180
A slide real quick.

4821
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,640
Cause that sort of fits the topic that I wanna talk about.

4822
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:28,560
Let me add this in.

4823
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:30,820
But this one is about networking and collaboration.

4824
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:33,080
Cause like the other stuff will not be as...

4825
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:35,060
The other stuff wouldn't make sense if I go down there.

4826
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:37,600
So let me add that slide real quick.

4827
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:39,840
So let me add that slide real quick.

4828
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:40,140
Boop!

4829
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:41,060
Add files.

4830
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:42,840
Where did I download it?

4831
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:44,440
Okay let's see.

4832
02:39:44,500 --> 02:39:45,700
I think it's...

4833
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:47,800
Is this collab and networking?

4834
02:39:48,500 --> 02:39:49,620
I think this is.

4835
02:39:49,780 --> 02:39:50,020
Alright.

4836
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:52,000
Alright let me...

4837
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,360
Let me push this slide up higher.

4838
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:55,060
Wooo!

4839
02:39:57,200 --> 02:39:57,760
Alright!

4840
02:39:58,720 --> 02:39:59,600
Networking and collabs!

4841
02:39:59,720 --> 02:40:00,400
There we go.

4842
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:03,500
Alright!

4843
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:04,760
Networking and collabs.

4844
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:06,220
Balance your schedule!

4845
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:07,720
I talked about this before.

4846
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:09,160
But please!

4847
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:11,600
Do not make it mostly collabs.

4848
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:12,860
It should be...

4849
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:14,260
Collab streams...

4850
02:40:14,260 --> 02:40:16,140
Should not be more than solo streams.

4851
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:18,720
Because if you spend too many collabs...

4852
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:20,280
Per week...

4853
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:22,260
Especially when you're just starting out...

4854
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:24,160
Then you're not building a fan base.

4855
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:26,020
And community that's...

4856
02:40:26,020 --> 02:40:28,060
And the community that's there for you.

4857
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:29,360
You have...

4858
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:32,120
You want to have viewers that want to watch you.

4859
02:40:32,860 --> 02:40:34,360
So you don't want to like...

4860
02:40:34,360 --> 02:40:35,300
Just...

4861
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:37,880
Have mostly collabs.

4862
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:38,720
Because people would be like...

4863
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:41,920
I just want to watch them interact with this streamer instead.

4864
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:44,360
Instead of actually watching for you.

4865
02:40:44,740 --> 02:40:47,160
So you have to have a healthy balance.

4866
02:40:47,560 --> 02:40:49,680
I do 1-2 collabs per week.

4867
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:50,340
I do 1-2 collabs per week.

4868
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:51,840
Because if I have lots of collabs going on...

4869
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:53,600
I also try to balance it more with solo streams.

4870
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:57,240
Because I know...

4871
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:58,040
My dragoons...

4872
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:00,100
They also want some personal dragoon time.

4873
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:02,340
They want me to interact with the chat.

4874
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:04,340
And that's why...

4875
02:41:04,340 --> 02:41:05,700
They want to have an identity.

4876
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:07,540
You don't want to be the collabber.

4877
02:41:09,100 --> 02:41:11,080
You don't want that to be your identity.

4878
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:12,000
You just collab.

4879
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:13,040
You don't have solo content.

4880
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:15,460
You want to have personal content.

4881
02:41:15,620 --> 02:41:16,880
So people will know your personality.

4882
02:41:21,610 --> 02:41:22,410
So like I said...

4883
02:41:22,410 --> 02:41:24,090
Don't rely too much on collabs.

4884
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:26,170
Like I said...

4885
02:41:26,170 --> 02:41:27,510
If you're relying too much on collabs...

4886
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:29,930
you're basically giving yourself a crutch.

4887
02:41:30,170 --> 02:41:31,510
And you have a harder time...

4888
02:41:31,510 --> 02:41:33,150
develping your personality and presence.

4889
02:41:33,810 --> 02:41:34,930
It also has...

4890
02:41:35,950 --> 02:41:36,250
YouTube...

4891
02:41:36,250 --> 02:41:39,950
It gives more opportunities for dead subs and followers.

4892
02:41:40,210 --> 02:41:42,310
You don't want that people who follow you..

4893
02:41:42,310 --> 02:41:43,690
Because you collab with this one person.

4894
02:41:43,990 --> 02:41:45,470
They want them to follow you because...

4895
02:41:45,470 --> 02:41:47,510
They enjoyed that experience.

4896
02:41:48,770 --> 02:41:49,370
And...

4897
02:41:49,370 --> 02:41:50,910
They want to watch more of you.

4898
02:41:51,390 --> 02:41:54,870
This is why a lot of collab channels die so fast.

4899
02:41:55,190 --> 02:41:55,770
There is a...

4900
02:41:56,170 --> 02:41:58,050
You can look at this example with Fleshtubers.

4901
02:41:58,670 --> 02:42:04,370
A lot of Fleshtubers, they like become big because of the group they are with.

4902
02:42:04,970 --> 02:42:07,250
Because they have like a YouTube group.

4903
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:11,390
But as soon as that YouTube group falls apart, their channel dies.

4904
02:42:11,710 --> 02:42:17,650
Because the viewers, they only want to watch that stream, that channel, for the group they are in.

4905
02:42:17,810 --> 02:42:19,270
Not because of the people they are.

4906
02:42:19,550 --> 02:42:21,950
They're like, oh my friend group experience.

4907
02:42:22,390 --> 02:42:22,670
No!

4908
02:42:23,230 --> 02:42:24,790
Like, that shit sucks.

4909
02:42:24,790 --> 02:42:30,210
Because they're like, no I watched you because I wanted to have that friend group experience.

4910
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:32,910
So I can live vicariously through this friend group.

4911
02:42:33,230 --> 02:42:37,690
And then now that you don't have that friend group, it's not as fun.

4912
02:42:39,590 --> 02:42:41,270
I used to watch the creatures.

4913
02:42:41,670 --> 02:42:44,150
I live vicariously through the creatures.

4914
02:42:49,730 --> 02:42:52,030
And like, that's the thing.

4915
02:42:52,190 --> 02:42:54,530
Especially like when they started going their separate ways.

4916
02:42:54,790 --> 02:42:58,590
They didn't have really an identity beyond that.

4917
02:42:58,710 --> 02:43:00,150
They didn't have the identity.

4918
02:43:00,650 --> 02:43:05,830
Like, it was just like, it was literally like the friend group was gone.

4919
02:43:06,290 --> 02:43:07,690
But you know, there's like so many experiences.

4920
02:43:07,790 --> 02:43:11,490
You can fucking look at Minecraft and like, uh, what is it?

4921
02:43:11,650 --> 02:43:12,590
Quibblequap or whatever.

4922
02:43:18,530 --> 02:43:20,030
Like shit like that.

4923
02:43:20,630 --> 02:43:23,590
Like, you can't be just the friend group.

4924
02:43:23,730 --> 02:43:24,770
You have to be your own.

4925
02:43:24,790 --> 02:43:25,330
You have to be your own individual.

4926
02:43:26,370 --> 02:43:26,830
Um...

4927
02:43:27,610 --> 02:43:28,070
Alright.

4928
02:43:28,330 --> 02:43:29,610
How to be good at collabs.

4929
02:43:29,810 --> 02:43:30,850
This is my...

4930
02:43:30,850 --> 02:43:31,570
My opinion.

4931
02:43:32,270 --> 02:43:33,910
But there's two roles in a collab.

4932
02:43:34,270 --> 02:43:35,190
This is how I see it.

4933
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:37,710
The support and the leader.

4934
02:43:38,250 --> 02:43:41,490
So the support is obviously like, you look at it as a comedy duo.

4935
02:43:41,690 --> 02:43:43,290
But it can be like a group thing too.

4936
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:44,390
So...

4937
02:43:45,030 --> 02:43:47,450
So you can have the straight man and the leader.

4938
02:43:47,570 --> 02:43:48,570
Or like the...

4939
02:43:48,570 --> 02:43:50,430
The dumb one.

4940
02:43:54,870 --> 02:43:56,310
Or the chaotic one.

4941
02:43:56,350 --> 02:43:57,570
Or the one with the comedy.

4942
02:43:58,190 --> 02:44:00,930
You need someone to react and the other one to be there.

4943
02:44:01,470 --> 02:44:04,190
Someone to bring the reaction and stuff.

4944
02:44:05,230 --> 02:44:05,750
Um...

4945
02:44:05,750 --> 02:44:07,390
And so...

4946
02:44:07,390 --> 02:44:08,850
Or you can be both.

4947
02:44:08,990 --> 02:44:14,350
One of the strongest skills you can have is to be both of them.

4948
02:44:15,070 --> 02:44:18,330
And I think I personally, I can be both.

4949
02:44:18,710 --> 02:44:20,110
I can be a reactor.

4950
02:44:20,330 --> 02:44:22,830
If I'm in a group that is way too chaotic.

4951
02:44:23,270 --> 02:44:24,770
I can be the straight man.

4952
02:44:24,790 --> 02:44:25,810
If I need it to be.

4953
02:44:25,930 --> 02:44:27,610
I can be the reactor.

4954
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:30,810
Like the one that tries to be the sane one.

4955
02:44:30,930 --> 02:44:31,790
In the group.

4956
02:44:32,150 --> 02:44:33,430
Like it is possible.

4957
02:44:33,550 --> 02:44:36,350
If you can have the skillset to be both.

4958
02:44:36,930 --> 02:44:40,530
You are, you can be a really good content creator.

4959
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:44,110
Because you're not locked into...

4960
02:44:44,670 --> 02:44:46,730
You're not locked into a group.

4961
02:44:47,270 --> 02:44:48,130
In a way.

4962
02:44:49,190 --> 02:44:54,470
You're not locked into certain people you can collab with.

4963
02:44:56,110 --> 02:44:58,650
And that is what makes a very strong collab.

4964
02:44:59,090 --> 02:45:01,810
So you don't want a whole group filled with supporters.

4965
02:45:02,050 --> 02:45:04,590
Like you know, all the people who can only do you support.

4966
02:45:05,010 --> 02:45:07,010
You don't want a full group of chaotic people.

4967
02:45:07,530 --> 02:45:09,550
Because it will be way too much.

4968
02:45:09,890 --> 02:45:12,150
You need to be able to have a healthy balance.

4969
02:45:12,610 --> 02:45:14,790
This is what I look into when collabs.

4970
02:45:14,870 --> 02:45:19,250
I try to find a healthy balance of people that would balance...

4971
02:45:19,250 --> 02:45:22,850
That would like... that would be good foils to each other.

4972
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:29,330
Sometimes I look at... I try to min-max collab groups in the past.

4973
02:45:29,550 --> 02:45:30,390
I have done that.

4974
02:45:30,510 --> 02:45:31,730
Sometimes they're random.

4975
02:45:31,810 --> 02:45:33,990
It depends on what kind of collab I'm planning.

4976
02:45:34,370 --> 02:45:36,910
I have min-max collabs before in the past.

4977
02:45:37,110 --> 02:45:39,430
And I have like done random people.

4978
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:44,330
It really depends on like how you want this collaboration to be like.

4979
02:45:45,050 --> 02:45:47,390
Because I can... I... the thing is...

4980
02:45:47,390 --> 02:45:51,890
I have the... I have the...

4981
02:45:51,890 --> 02:45:52,830
I guess like...

4982
02:45:52,830 --> 02:45:55,290
I have like the opportunity to be able to do random.

4983
02:45:55,750 --> 02:45:57,390
Because I can do both roles.

4984
02:45:57,750 --> 02:45:59,350
I can be a support and a leader.

4985
02:46:00,450 --> 02:46:03,910
I can be like... I can do both like the...

4986
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:06,990
I can do both like...

4987
02:46:06,990 --> 02:46:07,950
Oh, the chaotic role.

4988
02:46:08,290 --> 02:46:10,870
The... the say random shit role.

4989
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:13,350
Or I can be there to react and stuff.

4990
02:46:13,610 --> 02:46:15,490
And to be able to like...

4991
02:46:16,170 --> 02:46:18,750
To be able to like, you know, make it so like, you know...

4992
02:46:19,290 --> 02:46:21,550
I'm enabling whoever is the leader.

4993
02:46:21,550 --> 02:46:23,950
I'm making sure I'm enabling the leader.

4994
02:46:24,170 --> 02:46:27,950
I'm enabling their content to be bigger than what it was.

4995
02:46:28,090 --> 02:46:30,290
Like they would say something and I will make it...

4996
02:46:30,290 --> 02:46:31,810
Make it like more funny.

4997
02:46:31,950 --> 02:46:33,430
And I'll make it more like...

4998
02:46:33,430 --> 02:46:34,630
Oh chaotic or something.

4999
02:46:34,930 --> 02:46:35,890
Like stuff like that.

5000
02:46:37,610 --> 02:46:38,130
And...

5001
02:46:38,130 --> 02:46:41,090
That is like what makes a good collab.

5002
02:46:41,370 --> 02:46:42,710
And that's how you organize.

5003
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:45,270
When I'm at min-maxing, I make sure I choose like...

5004
02:46:45,270 --> 02:46:49,330
There's some collabs I will purposely pick regarding like collab partners.

5005
02:46:49,570 --> 02:46:51,470
Because I know the collab...

5006
02:46:51,550 --> 02:46:54,770
That comes out of it will be really good content.

5007
02:46:55,130 --> 02:47:01,990
Because I know the people in that group like will reflect really...

5008
02:47:01,990 --> 02:47:04,810
Will like foil each other really well.

5009
02:47:05,070 --> 02:47:07,930
Like they'll like compliment each other really well.

5010
02:47:08,090 --> 02:47:09,030
And I've done that before.

5011
02:47:09,210 --> 02:47:10,890
I've also done random people.

5012
02:47:11,010 --> 02:47:12,250
Like being who's free.

5013
02:47:12,490 --> 02:47:13,750
Like I've done both.

5014
02:47:14,230 --> 02:47:15,990
It really depends on like...

5015
02:47:17,330 --> 02:47:20,310
It really depends on like how you want to see the collab.

5016
02:47:23,270 --> 02:47:23,730
Anyway...

5017
02:47:24,650 --> 02:47:29,430
So that is like my like ideology when it comes to setting up these collabs.

5018
02:47:32,390 --> 02:47:32,850
Socialize!

5019
02:47:33,410 --> 02:47:34,870
I hate it but...

5020
02:47:36,890 --> 02:47:39,510
Always remember the people who were there for you.

5021
02:47:40,350 --> 02:47:40,810
So...

5022
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:44,390
Return favors and offer opportunities back to other people.

5023
02:47:44,590 --> 02:47:47,250
Who were there for you or who have done the same to you.

5024
02:47:48,650 --> 02:47:49,330
If you...

5025
02:47:49,330 --> 02:47:50,390
Like I've done this before.

5026
02:47:50,390 --> 02:47:52,450
If I have an extra invite to something.

5027
02:47:52,910 --> 02:47:56,210
I would give this invite to somebody that I knew was there for me.

5028
02:47:56,270 --> 02:47:57,290
Or like that I knew...

5029
02:47:57,890 --> 02:47:59,870
That I knew would benefit from.

5030
02:48:00,050 --> 02:48:00,930
Like I would be like...

5031
02:48:00,930 --> 02:48:01,230
Oh hey!

5032
02:48:01,330 --> 02:48:02,270
You were there for me.

5033
02:48:02,410 --> 02:48:03,890
I have an invite to this thing.

5034
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:05,370
Do you want to do it?

5035
02:48:05,410 --> 02:48:06,890
Because I know they're there for me.

5036
02:48:06,970 --> 02:48:08,950
I know that if something happens.

5037
02:48:09,030 --> 02:48:09,890
If something comes up.

5038
02:48:10,050 --> 02:48:12,290
You'll have something to return back.

5039
02:48:12,550 --> 02:48:13,030
They'll be like...

5040
02:48:13,030 --> 02:48:13,350
Oh hey!

5041
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:14,350
Like...

5042
02:48:14,890 --> 02:48:16,310
This person was there for me.

5043
02:48:16,450 --> 02:48:17,410
So I'll be there for you.

5044
02:48:17,970 --> 02:48:20,370
Like just make sure you always remember the people.

5045
02:48:20,950 --> 02:48:21,390
Who...

5046
02:48:23,030 --> 02:48:23,910
Who like...

5047
02:48:23,910 --> 02:48:25,990
Returned favors or did you a favor.

5048
02:48:26,530 --> 02:48:27,970
You always remember that.

5049
02:48:29,270 --> 02:48:31,130
And it's like paying it forward.

5050
02:48:31,370 --> 02:48:33,030
So it's always good for you long run.

5051
02:48:34,270 --> 02:48:36,410
To be able to like remember these things.

5052
02:48:37,570 --> 02:48:38,010
And...

5053
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:40,150
The worst people can say is no.

5054
02:48:40,290 --> 02:48:40,910
Like I said.

5055
02:48:41,130 --> 02:48:42,110
Always shoot your shot.

5056
02:48:42,510 --> 02:48:44,450
The worst is they ghost you or they say no.

5057
02:48:44,650 --> 02:48:46,090
You have to get used to rejection.

5058
02:48:46,290 --> 02:48:47,290
It's happened a lot.

5059
02:48:47,570 --> 02:48:49,750
I've ghosted people a lot because I get overwhelmed.

5060
02:48:50,010 --> 02:48:50,350
So I'm like...

5061
02:48:50,350 --> 02:48:52,810
Sometimes people ghost you not because they didn't want...

5062
02:48:52,810 --> 02:48:54,670
They didn't want to work with you.

5063
02:48:54,710 --> 02:48:57,050
It's because they're so fucking busy.

5064
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:59,090
And that has happened to me.

5065
02:48:59,310 --> 02:49:01,870
I've ghosted people because I was so fucking busy.

5066
02:49:02,010 --> 02:49:03,530
And I was so very overwhelmed.

5067
02:49:03,830 --> 02:49:05,730
I've been overwhelmed a lot.

5068
02:49:06,470 --> 02:49:10,090
And so like it's very common for me to be super overwhelmed.

5069
02:49:10,350 --> 02:49:12,270
And not like reply back instantly.

5070
02:49:12,550 --> 02:49:13,870
I've had moments where I'd be like...

5071
02:49:13,870 --> 02:49:16,110
I'm so sorry for taking a month to reply.

5072
02:49:16,310 --> 02:49:17,730
Everything was so overwhelming.

5073
02:49:17,970 --> 02:49:18,730
I'm sorry.

5074
02:49:19,010 --> 02:49:19,910
And then...

5075
02:49:19,910 --> 02:49:20,330
I'm sorry.

5076
02:49:20,350 --> 02:49:20,850
And so...

5077
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:21,650
It's understandable.

5078
02:49:22,050 --> 02:49:22,770
So like...

5079
02:49:22,770 --> 02:49:23,730
Just be aware.

5080
02:49:23,930 --> 02:49:24,930
That these things happen.

5081
02:49:25,170 --> 02:49:28,550
And a lot of content creators like have their own lives.

5082
02:49:28,910 --> 02:49:30,430
And like maybe, they don't want to collab.

5083
02:49:30,650 --> 02:49:32,010
And then they just don't want to say no.

5084
02:49:32,330 --> 02:49:33,470
You gotta live with it.

5085
02:49:33,590 --> 02:49:35,070
If you're in content creation.

5086
02:49:35,350 --> 02:49:36,950
You gotta live with these things.

5087
02:49:37,330 --> 02:49:37,770
Like...

5088
02:49:40,030 --> 02:49:41,370
You gotta like.

5089
02:49:41,590 --> 02:49:43,070
You just gotta deal with it.

5090
02:49:43,130 --> 02:49:44,550
You want this to be your job.

5091
02:49:44,770 --> 02:49:45,310
This is...

5092
02:49:45,310 --> 02:49:45,910
This really it.

5093
02:49:46,330 --> 02:49:48,070
Can I say...

5094
02:49:48,070 --> 02:49:48,910
Okay, what else?

5095
02:49:49,350 --> 02:49:50,030
What else?

5096
02:49:50,130 --> 02:49:51,730
Oh yeah, websites and resources!

5097
02:49:52,770 --> 02:49:57,230
Alright, so here are some really good websites and resources for you to use for streaming.

5098
02:49:57,810 --> 02:49:59,910
There's Booth, there's Nizima.

5099
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:01,710
I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right, I'm so sorry.

5100
02:50:02,390 --> 02:50:05,230
I don't even think I should pronounce it because I know I'm going to butcher it.

5101
02:50:05,370 --> 02:50:10,390
So, the four things I listed, they're really good resource websites.

5102
02:50:10,870 --> 02:50:17,310
Booth, the first two, they're really good for assets and backgrounds and like VTuber models or skin suits.

5103
02:50:18,070 --> 02:50:18,290
All of that.

5104
02:50:18,510 --> 02:50:25,930
The last two are really good for like also for assets and backgrounds and like copyright-free shit.

5105
02:50:26,150 --> 02:50:28,550
Like, they're... those are really good.

5106
02:50:28,670 --> 02:50:37,770
Like, I would highly suggest looking at these websites for like just information you need, like graphics and stuff like that.

5107
02:50:37,870 --> 02:50:38,970
Or like assets.

5108
02:50:39,050 --> 02:50:39,650
You don't want to pay?

5109
02:50:39,810 --> 02:50:41,570
A lot of the things on there are free!

5110
02:50:42,110 --> 02:50:43,330
That's the best part!

5111
02:50:43,790 --> 02:50:45,910
A lot of there is for free!

5112
02:50:46,930 --> 02:50:47,690
Care of fun!

5113
02:50:48,070 --> 02:50:49,870
It's really good for karaoke or singing.

5114
02:50:50,230 --> 02:50:53,530
Like, you're worried about like copyright claims and stuff like that.

5115
02:50:53,690 --> 02:50:55,330
I highly suggest using care of fun!

5116
02:50:55,670 --> 02:50:57,350
Because like, they have like...

5117
02:50:57,350 --> 02:51:00,790
Usually, if you use care of fun stuff, you don't have to worry about copyright things.

5118
02:51:01,870 --> 02:51:03,710
Because like, they're all like...

5119
02:51:03,710 --> 02:51:05,590
It's a... there's a subscription fee.

5120
02:51:05,950 --> 02:51:07,450
It's a subscription fee though.

5121
02:51:07,530 --> 02:51:09,210
It's like $50, I think, a month.

5122
02:51:09,550 --> 02:51:17,470
But if you're like a regular singer or like you like to do karaoke, this is a good investment for the future.

5123
02:51:18,070 --> 02:51:18,790
And then, Shoost?

5124
02:51:18,850 --> 02:51:19,350
Shoost?

5125
02:51:19,590 --> 02:51:20,130
Shoost?

5126
02:51:20,290 --> 02:51:20,790
I don't know.

5127
02:51:20,990 --> 02:51:22,550
They're like really good like...

5128
02:51:22,550 --> 02:51:24,350
You have to do Patreon pledge stuff.

5129
02:51:24,810 --> 02:51:26,950
But they're really good for like...

5130
02:51:27,410 --> 02:51:29,470
Like, you know like those like really...

5131
02:51:30,830 --> 02:51:31,390
Pretty...

5132
02:51:32,490 --> 02:51:33,570
Immersive like...

5133
02:51:34,170 --> 02:51:39,470
Settings and stuff where like the light at the background actually looks like it connects with the...

5134
02:51:39,470 --> 02:51:41,070
With the Vtuber.

5135
02:51:41,390 --> 02:51:42,070
That's it!

5136
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:43,170
That's the thing.

5137
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:46,710
It's just really good atmospheric stuff to use when you're streaming.

5138
02:51:46,710 --> 02:51:48,530
So that's what they use.

5139
02:51:48,710 --> 02:51:51,410
So these are really all really good websites and resources.

5140
02:51:52,790 --> 02:51:56,630
If you really wanna look for free things, you don't wanna spend money...

5141
02:51:56,630 --> 02:51:58,070
I highly...

5142
02:51:58,070 --> 02:51:58,990
This glasses?

5143
02:51:59,290 --> 02:51:59,790
Free!

5144
02:52:02,290 --> 02:52:07,090
I literally look for Vtuber glasses asset.

5145
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:07,950
Free!

5146
02:52:08,510 --> 02:52:11,170
If you really wanna find free stuff...

5147
02:52:11,710 --> 02:52:16,410
These are really good places to like look at if you want free things.

5148
02:52:17,190 --> 02:52:18,950
Okay, mental health care.

5149
02:52:19,810 --> 02:52:24,270
I will admit I am not the person to go to advice for this.

5150
02:52:24,430 --> 02:52:27,470
Because I still battle with it frequently.

5151
02:52:27,850 --> 02:52:32,170
If you want to be a content creator or a Vtuber...

5152
02:52:32,570 --> 02:52:36,190
You have to know you're so fucked when it comes to mental health.

5153
02:52:40,450 --> 02:52:42,250
There's no one that's okay.

5154
02:52:47,990 --> 02:52:57,370
You have to be aware that you're gonna go through some mental health shit.

5155
02:52:57,650 --> 02:53:00,670
It could be like little bit.

5156
02:53:00,730 --> 02:53:01,950
It doesn't have to be like...

5157
02:53:03,440 --> 02:53:05,710
It doesn't have to be like really bad.

5158
02:53:05,910 --> 02:53:08,590
But you will feel it.

5159
02:53:09,950 --> 02:53:16,110
If you wanna be a content creator or like anything to do with making content on the internet.

5160
02:53:16,110 --> 02:53:20,590
You will not have like the most positive mental health experience.

5161
02:53:21,110 --> 02:53:23,550
It's all about mitigating it.

5162
02:53:25,830 --> 02:53:31,710
Just make sure you have a support system that is outside of content creation.

5163
02:53:32,910 --> 02:53:37,530
Because if you live... if you have like a support system that's within content creation.

5164
02:53:37,790 --> 02:53:42,670
You're just in a fucking echo chamber of like some things.

5165
02:53:42,890 --> 02:53:45,330
So you only like an outside perspective.

5166
02:53:45,330 --> 02:53:50,950
You really need very thick skin to be able to like do this as a career.

5167
02:53:51,350 --> 02:53:54,250
Like especially like you're gonna deal with so many things.

5168
02:53:54,430 --> 02:53:56,530
Like you're gonna deal with a lot of stuff.

5169
02:53:56,770 --> 02:53:58,450
So you really need thick skin.

5170
02:53:58,630 --> 02:54:00,110
And even if you have thick skin.

5171
02:54:00,350 --> 02:54:03,110
You're still gonna go through some mental health shit.

5172
02:54:03,410 --> 02:54:04,970
Um... on the internet.

5173
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:07,130
Because your numbers will affect...

5174
02:54:07,130 --> 02:54:11,070
You can say numbers will affect you cause you don't wanna fucking fail.

5175
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:12,370
Like you know...

5176
02:54:12,370 --> 02:54:14,930
Of course you'll be like I'm trying to have better numbers.

5177
02:54:14,930 --> 02:54:16,470
Because I wanna have a successful career.

5178
02:54:16,750 --> 02:54:19,810
Like you don't... you still have to pay attention to it.

5179
02:54:19,970 --> 02:54:21,950
So it's still gonna affect you.

5180
02:54:22,130 --> 02:54:22,970
So... um...

5181
02:54:23,470 --> 02:54:28,670
You just have to be able to have a good support system outside of just content creation.

5182
02:54:29,050 --> 02:54:31,850
And do stuff outside every once in a while.

5183
02:54:32,330 --> 02:54:34,130
Like um...

5184
02:54:34,130 --> 02:54:37,330
So... just be able to like handle that.

5185
02:54:37,470 --> 02:54:40,970
Like you have the risk for being a fucking content creator.

5186
02:54:41,250 --> 02:54:42,310
Is that...

5187
02:54:42,310 --> 02:54:44,910
It's not a very mentally healthy thing.

5188
02:54:44,910 --> 02:54:45,830
Like...

5189
02:54:48,210 --> 02:54:52,270
Being an entertainer is not just like on the internet.

5190
02:54:52,430 --> 02:54:54,810
You can look at like Hollywood actors.

5191
02:54:55,070 --> 02:54:56,990
Those people are not okay.

5192
02:55:00,850 --> 02:55:07,850
Hollywood actors, TV actors, celebrities outside of fucking the internet.

5193
02:55:08,010 --> 02:55:09,970
They are not okay as well.

5194
02:55:10,110 --> 02:55:11,930
If you're in the entertainment business.

5195
02:55:12,190 --> 02:55:14,130
Like you're... you're... you're...

5196
02:55:14,130 --> 02:55:15,990
You're gonna have to go through some shit.

5197
02:55:16,150 --> 02:55:16,470
Like...

5198
02:55:20,270 --> 02:55:22,370
So you have to be aware.

5199
02:55:22,530 --> 02:55:25,270
And that is like the biggest risk you have to take.

5200
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:27,150
You just have to remember that.

5201
02:55:27,530 --> 02:55:28,010
Alright.

5202
02:55:28,630 --> 02:55:29,110
Anyway...

5203
02:55:29,830 --> 02:55:32,730
I'm gonna look at questions on Twitter now.

5204
02:55:32,890 --> 02:55:35,390
To see if there is anything that I can...

5205
02:55:37,090 --> 02:55:40,570
I'm gonna look at any of the questions I have on Twitter.

5206
02:55:40,690 --> 02:55:42,010
If there is anything I wanna answer.

5207
02:55:42,210 --> 02:55:43,790
But that is basically...

5208
02:55:44,970 --> 02:55:50,690
That is basically like all I have written down for myself to talk to you guys about.

5209
02:55:50,890 --> 02:55:53,730
So I hope like all the stuff I have...

5210
02:55:54,570 --> 02:55:56,310
All the stuff I have...

5211
02:55:56,310 --> 02:55:59,130
Also I'll do like... I'll put like questions from chat as well.

5212
02:55:59,470 --> 02:56:01,290
All the stuff I have written down.

5213
02:56:01,390 --> 02:56:05,410
I hope the slides itself has been very informative chat.

5214
02:56:05,690 --> 02:56:07,310
I hope they have been very informative.

5215
02:56:07,390 --> 02:56:12,230
And that it has like helped you guys figure out like...

5216
02:56:12,230 --> 02:56:20,450
Give you advice and tips on how to go through like content creation and VTubing in general.

5217
02:56:20,590 --> 02:56:23,770
I will be taking questions now from...

5218
02:56:23,770 --> 02:56:28,610
I'll be looking at the Twitter thread that I made regarding if anybody had questions before I made this stream.

5219
02:56:28,830 --> 02:56:31,250
As well as taking questions from chat.

5220
02:56:31,770 --> 02:56:37,830
I hope it assists you regarding if you want a VTuber career in content creation.

5221
02:56:37,990 --> 02:56:39,590
And how to game the algorithm.

5222
02:56:42,650 --> 02:56:45,490
Okay, so I have this one question that I saw.

5223
02:56:45,790 --> 02:56:48,110
And one of them was like...

5224
02:56:48,110 --> 02:56:58,370
How do you manage your energy levels and social battery when it comes to networking, creating video content, streaming with your VTuber skin suit, and responding to a bunch of brand deals or collabs?

5225
02:56:58,490 --> 02:57:01,730
How do you keep the momentum going during all that work?

5226
02:57:03,030 --> 02:57:03,550
Well...

5227
02:57:04,190 --> 02:57:07,530
All my energy is mostly on streaming.

5228
02:57:08,410 --> 02:57:11,690
That's why when I say off stream, I'm like really different.

5229
02:57:11,770 --> 02:57:12,210
It's because...

5230
02:57:12,230 --> 02:57:15,730
I've normally put all my energy within streaming.

5231
02:57:16,390 --> 02:57:17,310
And like...

5232
02:57:17,310 --> 02:57:20,990
And then I go to power save mode the moment after.

5233
02:57:23,450 --> 02:57:26,730
Streaming is also like sort of an escape for me.

5234
02:57:27,230 --> 02:57:28,550
It's not very healthy.

5235
02:57:28,710 --> 02:57:30,090
But like for me...

5236
02:57:30,630 --> 02:57:30,950
I...

5237
02:57:31,630 --> 02:57:34,730
I like to stream because it is like...

5238
02:57:34,730 --> 02:57:36,690
I very much enjoy streaming.

5239
02:57:36,910 --> 02:57:39,710
And it is like my way of escaping work.

5240
02:57:39,870 --> 02:57:41,310
Because my work is...

5241
02:57:41,310 --> 02:57:42,450
Off stream.

5242
02:57:49,990 --> 02:57:52,790
My work is off stream at the moment.

5243
02:57:53,090 --> 02:57:53,350
So...

5244
02:57:54,550 --> 02:57:55,110
So...

5245
02:57:55,690 --> 02:57:57,330
That is why I love streaming.

5246
02:57:57,630 --> 02:57:58,870
That's how I keep my energy.

5247
02:57:59,210 --> 02:58:00,730
All my energy is streaming.

5248
02:58:01,050 --> 02:58:04,190
And I do power save after streaming.

5249
02:58:04,570 --> 02:58:07,630
I have a management team that helps me with brand deals.

5250
02:58:07,710 --> 02:58:10,790
At best, like I would look through the details of stuff that got screened.

5251
02:58:10,790 --> 02:58:11,570
And filter out.

5252
02:58:11,830 --> 02:58:12,730
And then...

5253
02:58:13,430 --> 02:58:15,110
And then when it comes to networking.

5254
02:58:15,490 --> 02:58:17,510
I take that really slow at the moment.

5255
02:58:17,650 --> 02:58:20,470
Networking is the thing I'm like really slow on.

5256
02:58:20,650 --> 02:58:24,130
Because right now I am focused on stabilizing myself.

5257
02:58:25,570 --> 02:58:28,990
I am trying to make sure I'm more stabilized in my career.

5258
02:58:29,230 --> 02:58:30,610
Because like I said like...

5259
02:58:30,610 --> 02:58:34,430
My career just started out of a sudden as an indie.

5260
02:58:34,750 --> 02:58:37,610
And I'm still at the point where I'm still trying to stabilize.

5261
02:58:37,710 --> 02:58:40,270
There's a lot of groundwork that we have to make.

5262
02:58:40,270 --> 02:58:42,750
And we're still making that groundwork.

5263
02:58:42,890 --> 02:58:44,890
And there's a lot of things I haven't announced yet.

5264
02:58:44,930 --> 02:58:47,010
There's so many things I haven't announced yet.

5265
02:58:47,290 --> 02:58:48,490
Regarding like...

5266
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:50,570
Like you know future sponsors.

5267
02:58:50,790 --> 02:58:51,950
Future brand deals.

5268
02:58:52,070 --> 02:58:54,410
There's so many things I haven't yet been able to announce.

5269
02:58:55,110 --> 02:58:56,730
Because we're still like...

5270
02:58:56,730 --> 02:58:57,990
Like stabilizing.

5271
02:58:58,010 --> 02:58:59,170
We're still establishing things.

5272
02:59:00,250 --> 02:59:02,170
But we're slowly getting there.

5273
02:59:02,310 --> 02:59:04,030
So that is really how...

5274
02:59:04,030 --> 02:59:06,290
How my life is at right now.

5275
02:59:08,010 --> 02:59:08,570
Um...

5276
02:59:08,570 --> 02:59:08,990
Okay.

5277
02:59:09,810 --> 02:59:10,330
Uh...

5278
02:59:10,330 --> 02:59:10,850
Thank you.

5279
02:59:11,250 --> 02:59:13,610
Do you have a workout routine?

5280
02:59:13,710 --> 02:59:17,070
Or do you sustain through pure mental fortitude and caffeine?

5281
02:59:17,450 --> 02:59:18,290
That's the thing.

5282
02:59:18,610 --> 02:59:19,130
Um...

5283
02:59:19,130 --> 02:59:21,030
Right now...

5284
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:21,830
Um...

5285
02:59:22,390 --> 02:59:22,970
Right now...

5286
02:59:22,970 --> 02:59:26,130
I haven't really had a really decent workout routine at the moment.

5287
02:59:26,650 --> 02:59:27,170
Um...

5288
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:29,330
Because I'm not stabilized at the moment.

5289
02:59:29,510 --> 02:59:31,070
Before in the past, I did.

5290
02:59:31,250 --> 02:59:32,690
I have a treadmill in my room.

5291
02:59:33,030 --> 02:59:34,430
But because like...

5292
02:59:34,430 --> 02:59:35,910
You have to take some cuts.

5293
02:59:36,050 --> 02:59:37,450
In terms of like your routine.

5294
02:59:37,450 --> 02:59:40,570
And that is sadly one of the things I had to take a cut on.

5295
02:59:40,650 --> 02:59:42,470
I don't normally drink caffeine.

5296
02:59:42,650 --> 02:59:43,850
But I have drank caffeine.

5297
02:59:43,930 --> 02:59:47,650
At least like once or twice a week.

5298
02:59:48,610 --> 02:59:49,130
Uh...

5299
02:59:49,130 --> 02:59:50,190
I have taken...

5300
02:59:50,190 --> 02:59:50,510
Drink...

5301
02:59:50,510 --> 02:59:52,550
Drank some caffeine once or twice a week.

5302
02:59:52,890 --> 02:59:54,470
And um...

5303
02:59:54,470 --> 02:59:56,790
And because I really need it.

5304
02:59:57,250 --> 02:59:57,770
Like...

5305
02:59:57,770 --> 02:59:58,330
I...

5306
02:59:58,330 --> 02:59:59,770
There's been a lot of stuff.

5307
03:00:00,430 --> 03:00:00,950
Um...

5308
03:00:00,950 --> 03:00:01,970
That I have to do.

5309
03:00:02,190 --> 03:00:03,010
And I...

5310
03:00:03,010 --> 03:00:05,290
Sometimes I get really tired after a while.

5311
03:00:05,610 --> 03:00:06,990
And um...

5312
03:00:06,990 --> 03:00:07,710
I have...

5313
03:00:07,710 --> 03:00:09,510
Unfortunately that is like one of the things I have to do.

5314
03:00:09,650 --> 03:00:11,130
I have to take caffeine now.

5315
03:00:11,250 --> 03:00:12,770
Because it's been like real...

5316
03:00:12,770 --> 03:00:13,370
A lot of work.

5317
03:00:13,550 --> 03:00:15,190
To stay like...

5318
03:00:15,190 --> 03:00:15,430
Uh...

5319
03:00:15,430 --> 03:00:15,970
Stay up.

5320
03:00:16,070 --> 03:00:18,150
I only drink caffeine...

5321
03:00:18,970 --> 03:00:19,730
Off stream.

5322
03:00:19,870 --> 03:00:21,090
I don't do it on stream.

5323
03:00:21,370 --> 03:00:23,970
I know a lot of people think I'm like super energetic.

5324
03:00:23,970 --> 03:00:24,910
Or like...

5325
03:00:25,850 --> 03:00:26,330
Um...

5326
03:00:26,330 --> 03:00:28,250
I take something when I'm streaming.

5327
03:00:28,570 --> 03:00:31,270
I do not drink any type of caffeine.

5328
03:00:31,810 --> 03:00:32,770
I drink water.

5329
03:00:32,970 --> 03:00:34,630
I just drink water when I'm streaming.

5330
03:00:34,870 --> 03:00:35,630
Off stream.

5331
03:00:35,630 --> 03:00:37,810
I actually drink like tea.

5332
03:00:37,970 --> 03:00:40,330
Like green tea or coffee.

5333
03:00:40,690 --> 03:00:41,930
Just to be like...

5334
03:00:42,370 --> 03:00:42,790
Uh...

5335
03:00:42,790 --> 03:00:44,430
Just to like survive.

5336
03:00:46,890 --> 03:00:50,390
If I have a stream at like really late.

5337
03:00:50,450 --> 03:00:51,350
I would drink coffee.

5338
03:00:51,590 --> 03:00:55,250
I would drink coffee if I have a stream really fucking late.

5339
03:00:55,410 --> 03:00:56,450
Because like...

5340
03:00:56,450 --> 03:00:56,950
You know...

5341
03:00:56,950 --> 03:00:58,290
I'm fucking exhausted.

5342
03:00:58,310 --> 03:00:59,590
It's like 3 in the morning.

5343
03:00:59,790 --> 03:01:01,550
So of course I'm gonna drink coffee.

5344
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:03,010
To just survive.

5345
03:01:03,350 --> 03:01:03,930
Hahaha.

5346
03:01:03,930 --> 03:01:04,330
Hahaha.

5347
03:01:06,490 --> 03:01:06,890
Hahaha.

5348
03:01:08,110 --> 03:01:08,510
Uh...

5349
03:01:08,510 --> 03:01:09,550
Man, thank you for the super chat.

5350
03:01:09,610 --> 03:01:09,890
Thank you.

5351
03:01:09,890 --> 03:01:10,470
Thank you.

5352
03:01:11,370 --> 03:01:11,770
Um...

5353
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:14,990
What should I do with my favorite YouTuber suddenly lasts a lot out of nowhere?

5354
03:01:15,210 --> 03:01:16,190
Is that the side?

5355
03:01:16,430 --> 03:01:16,830
Hahaha.

5356
03:01:20,410 --> 03:01:21,130
No comment.

5357
03:01:21,410 --> 03:01:22,530
Thank you for the super chat.

5358
03:01:22,630 --> 03:01:22,990
Thank you.

5359
03:01:23,010 --> 03:01:23,610
Thank you.

5360
03:01:23,990 --> 03:01:24,390
Malcolm.

5361
03:01:24,670 --> 03:01:25,910
How do you find games?

5362
03:01:26,010 --> 03:01:27,310
What games are popular?

5363
03:01:27,510 --> 03:01:29,290
Are there any tools do you use for this?

5364
03:01:29,430 --> 03:01:30,270
Thank you for the super chat.

5365
03:01:30,350 --> 03:01:30,710
Thank you.

5366
03:01:30,730 --> 03:01:31,330
Thank you.

5367
03:01:31,550 --> 03:01:31,950
Okay.

5368
03:01:33,030 --> 03:01:33,810
Very easy.

5369
03:01:33,870 --> 03:01:34,850
You go on Steam.

5370
03:01:35,490 --> 03:01:36,790
You go to...

5371
03:01:38,010 --> 03:01:39,050
Recently released.

5372
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:41,170
Or upcoming games.

5373
03:01:41,630 --> 03:01:43,330
Recently released on Steam.

5374
03:01:43,590 --> 03:01:44,970
You look at the reviews.

5375
03:01:45,410 --> 03:01:50,950
If a new game gets like more than 700 plus reviews.

5376
03:01:51,390 --> 03:01:54,270
This is how I found pineapple on pizza by the way.

5377
03:01:54,450 --> 03:01:56,770
I was like the first one to stream pineapple on pizza.

5378
03:01:57,170 --> 03:01:59,090
Because I literally looked at the reviews.

5379
03:01:59,410 --> 03:02:01,550
And I was like this game came out yesterday.

5380
03:02:01,810 --> 03:02:03,270
Like I'll be like this game came out yesterday.

5381
03:02:03,550 --> 03:02:04,830
It has a thousand reviews.

5382
03:02:04,830 --> 03:02:06,070
What the fuck?

5383
03:02:06,810 --> 03:02:08,130
And then I streamed it.

5384
03:02:08,590 --> 03:02:10,090
And that's how I found out.

5385
03:02:10,390 --> 03:02:16,770
I was one of the first one to stream it.

5386
03:02:16,830 --> 03:02:20,270
I saw like there were a thousand reviews with a game that just came out yesterday.

5387
03:02:20,830 --> 03:02:24,670
And then I just streamed it because I was like clearly this is going to be a meta game.

5388
03:02:24,950 --> 03:02:27,250
Clearly this game is going to be popular.

5389
03:02:29,470 --> 03:02:34,750
And it was like basically like you just like look at Steam.

5390
03:02:34,830 --> 03:02:35,010
Like if you look at the game reviews.

5391
03:02:35,350 --> 03:02:43,870
If it's like if there's like I said if if a game on Steam recently released has more than like 500 plus reviews.

5392
03:02:44,410 --> 03:02:48,270
Then most likely it is going to be like a meta game.

5393
03:02:48,470 --> 03:02:49,450
It's going to be a meta stream.

5394
03:02:49,630 --> 03:02:53,730
You can also look at upcoming releases and just judge by the upcoming releases.

5395
03:02:54,090 --> 03:03:02,050
Another way is to I said this before but you look at Twitch and see what's the most.

5396
03:03:02,050 --> 03:03:05,530
Like you go at Twitch and see like what's popular.

5397
03:03:05,710 --> 03:03:09,010
You go to browse and then categories and then bam.

5398
03:03:09,250 --> 03:03:15,550
You see like if you see a stream of a game that's like oh I've never seen this before.

5399
03:03:16,070 --> 03:03:17,930
I've never seen this game before.

5400
03:03:18,130 --> 03:03:19,150
What the fuck?

5401
03:03:19,250 --> 03:03:22,430
And then you click on it and you're like oh that's a new stream meta.

5402
03:03:22,550 --> 03:03:26,790
The Twitch front page is basically a story of like what's meta.

5403
03:03:27,490 --> 03:03:30,870
You can also follow some big content creators.

5404
03:03:31,770 --> 03:03:36,610
Like these content creators they always follow meta.

5405
03:03:36,830 --> 03:03:40,390
Which is like Moist Critical.

5406
03:03:41,830 --> 03:03:46,170
Let's see Moist Critical follows Twitch meta.

5407
03:03:46,870 --> 03:03:48,010
Not Twitch meta.

5408
03:03:48,090 --> 03:03:50,930
Follows streamer meta very well.

5409
03:03:51,230 --> 03:03:55,050
He follows streamer meta in terms of games really really well.

5410
03:03:55,370 --> 03:04:00,230
And I would like sometimes like I think I saw I think I saw supermarket simulator.

5411
03:04:02,070 --> 03:04:03,230
No not from him.

5412
03:04:03,290 --> 03:04:04,330
I saw it somewhere else.

5413
03:04:04,690 --> 03:04:08,790
I don't remember who I don't remember who I saw that was streaming supermarket simulator.

5414
03:04:09,450 --> 03:04:17,110
And I I knew that like I knew that someone was streaming it and I knew that was going to be that's the stream meta.

5415
03:04:17,330 --> 03:04:21,690
And that's why I put it on my schedule because I saw it somebody stream it and I was like oh my God.

5416
03:04:21,890 --> 03:04:27,070
I'm going to stream it because I was like wait this is the next stream game.

5417
03:04:29,870 --> 03:04:30,850
And that's why.

5418
03:04:33,070 --> 03:04:34,510
That's why I streamed it.

5419
03:04:34,670 --> 03:04:37,370
I think I'm trying to think what sure for I think so.

5420
03:04:37,470 --> 03:04:39,830
Whenever sure for gets addicted to a new game.

5421
03:04:40,030 --> 03:04:41,490
I knew it's it's a good game.

5422
03:04:44,530 --> 03:04:46,730
Ludwig is also a good stream meta follower.

5423
03:04:47,090 --> 03:04:49,330
Ludwig follows meta really well.

5424
03:04:54,130 --> 03:04:54,770
Let's see.

5425
03:04:56,690 --> 03:04:57,470
What else?

5426
03:05:00,870 --> 03:05:01,790
So thank you for super chat.

5427
03:05:01,830 --> 03:05:02,090
Thank you.

5428
03:05:02,110 --> 03:05:02,530
Thank you.

5429
03:05:02,550 --> 03:05:07,630
You mentioned making merch is very important for income for how much does it cost usually commissioned art for merchandise.

5430
03:05:07,910 --> 03:05:08,770
And it was super chat.

5431
03:05:08,850 --> 03:05:09,090
Thank you.

5432
03:05:09,130 --> 03:05:09,610
Thank you.

5433
03:05:09,650 --> 03:05:15,070
That really depends on what kind of merch you want to you want to make.

5434
03:05:15,930 --> 03:05:17,710
Obviously I gave some cheap options.

5435
03:05:18,490 --> 03:05:26,110
I was think like acrylic stands and acrylic stands pins stickers.

5436
03:05:27,950 --> 03:05:28,430
Prince.

5437
03:05:28,430 --> 03:05:34,530
They are like the most convenient ones and the easiest to make because you can't fuck it up.

5438
03:05:34,590 --> 03:05:35,690
You can't fuck up stickers.

5439
03:05:35,990 --> 03:05:37,110
You can't fuck up acrylic stands.

5440
03:05:37,430 --> 03:05:39,590
You can't fuck up like Prince and stuff like that.

5441
03:05:39,730 --> 03:05:45,170
Those are like the easiest to make and like you don't have to worry about grabbing samples and stuff like that.

5442
03:05:45,330 --> 03:05:48,430
The more complicated the merch the more oh and keychains.

5443
03:05:48,470 --> 03:05:48,730
Yes.

5444
03:05:50,170 --> 03:05:55,010
And keychains the more complicated the merch the harder is to grab like.

5445
03:05:56,070 --> 03:05:58,930
To grab like merch that's not fucked up.

5446
03:05:59,050 --> 03:06:01,790
You know like you know you're like a manufacturer sent you merch.

5447
03:06:02,010 --> 03:06:09,710
It's like you might get more like duds than you do like actual like quality quality that you can send out to people.

5448
03:06:10,090 --> 03:06:12,570
Even enamel pins and enamel pins.

5449
03:06:12,930 --> 03:06:13,790
Oh my God.

5450
03:06:13,890 --> 03:06:20,670
You have to find a really good manufacturer for pins like enamel pins because like you can fuck that up so easily.

5451
03:06:20,810 --> 03:06:24,330
I've had one time where I got a manufacturer that like sent me like.

5452
03:06:24,330 --> 03:06:27,850
The quality control for that is so hard to manage because they would send me like.

5453
03:06:28,790 --> 03:06:30,850
I don't I never worked with that one again.

5454
03:06:31,110 --> 03:06:34,090
But they sent me like a thousand pins or something.

5455
03:06:34,310 --> 03:06:37,770
And like I think like 200 of them were like duds.

5456
03:06:37,870 --> 03:06:41,010
Like there was like markings on it that I had to clean myself.

5457
03:06:41,630 --> 03:06:47,090
And like at the but even then I didn't I couldn't get like the scratch marks and stuff out of it.

5458
03:06:47,210 --> 03:06:52,510
There's like and I had to like sell it as a bargain price and stuff because it's like it's so hard.

5459
03:06:52,670 --> 03:06:53,950
That's why it's like enamel pins are like.

5460
03:06:53,950 --> 03:06:55,850
Some of the riskiest for quality control.

5461
03:06:56,130 --> 03:07:06,150
Anything beyond like keychain stickers pin like buttons like like the buttons and acrylic stands are really hard to get quality control.

5462
03:07:06,330 --> 03:07:06,550
Right?

5463
03:07:09,130 --> 03:07:13,350
So you guys gotta be like really careful for stuff like that.

5464
03:07:13,470 --> 03:07:14,570
And we're writing art.

5465
03:07:14,750 --> 03:07:19,250
Like I said, it depends on who you want to Commission depends on each artist has his own rates.

5466
03:07:19,310 --> 03:07:20,350
So I can't give you an estimate.

5467
03:07:20,630 --> 03:07:22,550
There's some artists that charges a lot.

5468
03:07:22,590 --> 03:07:23,570
There's some artists that don't.

5469
03:07:23,570 --> 03:07:25,430
It really depends on the estimate.

5470
03:07:25,930 --> 03:07:28,090
Some artists will charge a commercial price.

5471
03:07:28,230 --> 03:07:31,810
Some won't just have to it's basically who you want to Commission.

5472
03:07:33,110 --> 03:07:33,990
Oh many.

5473
03:07:34,130 --> 03:07:34,470
Thank you.

5474
03:07:34,490 --> 03:07:34,930
Let's super chat.

5475
03:07:35,010 --> 03:07:35,270
Thank you.

5476
03:07:35,290 --> 03:07:35,710
Thank you.

5477
03:07:35,710 --> 03:07:40,510
What's the best way to announce a big project event so that you can receive the most engagement on stream live?

5478
03:07:41,710 --> 03:07:49,130
That's really the best way if you're a streamer on stream live and now so you don't say anything about what the thing is.

5479
03:07:49,210 --> 03:07:51,090
You say special announcement special event.

5480
03:07:52,270 --> 03:07:53,470
And then you review.

5481
03:07:53,570 --> 03:07:56,790
You reveal it on stream because and you reveal the participants on stream.

5482
03:07:57,010 --> 03:08:00,550
You don't reveal it on Twitter or like social media first.

5483
03:08:00,730 --> 03:08:03,450
You reveal it on stream because people want to know who's participating.

5484
03:08:03,790 --> 03:08:08,870
So you announce it on stream one by one because it gets bring it builds.

5485
03:08:08,990 --> 03:08:12,930
It builds up like anticipation and stuff.

5486
03:08:13,770 --> 03:08:16,770
And you're like, oh and you're like, oh who's going to be next?

5487
03:08:16,910 --> 03:08:17,190
Whoa.

5488
03:08:19,810 --> 03:08:22,890
So announcing any you announce things live.

5489
03:08:23,570 --> 03:08:30,190
Not via social media unless it's like a tournament invite then like you can't really announce that live.

5490
03:08:34,370 --> 03:08:37,350
Yeah, you it's like you see like everybody always does this.

5491
03:08:37,430 --> 03:08:38,330
Oh, I'm doing this thing.

5492
03:08:38,590 --> 03:08:47,050
Wait until the very end you wait like oh if you want to hear what the announcement is you wait until the very end because you make all the viewers wait until the very end.

5493
03:08:47,130 --> 03:08:49,550
They show come to watch you do a regular stream.

5494
03:08:49,710 --> 03:08:52,250
If it's a regular stream with announced tacked on the end.

5495
03:08:52,390 --> 03:08:53,270
It makes it.

5496
03:08:53,570 --> 03:08:57,130
The viewers stay until the very end because they want to know what the announcement is.

5497
03:08:57,330 --> 03:09:01,870
So that's what like that's what people usually do.

5498
03:09:01,950 --> 03:09:08,250
That's the meta that what brings in all the engagements for your stream.

5499
03:09:11,850 --> 03:09:12,710
Let's see.

5500
03:09:17,310 --> 03:09:22,250
Let's see what to do here.

5501
03:09:22,250 --> 03:09:23,070
Okay.

5502
03:09:23,550 --> 03:09:26,370
Uh, direct thing in the super chat thing.

5503
03:09:26,370 --> 03:09:26,750
Thank you.

5504
03:09:26,790 --> 03:09:27,490
So you talk.

5505
03:09:27,550 --> 03:09:31,150
How do you go about learning a language becoming some influence requires years?

5506
03:09:31,210 --> 03:09:31,610
Isn't it?

5507
03:09:31,630 --> 03:09:34,490
You would know since you are you okay.

5508
03:09:34,630 --> 03:09:48,210
You want to learn languages get a tutor get a teacher the best because the best way to learn a language is being able to speak that language with somebody else and the easiest way to do that is having a tutor.

5509
03:09:49,770 --> 03:09:52,090
Having a teacher or a friend.

5510
03:09:52,250 --> 03:10:01,690
To help you with your studies because if you just read and write your you're not learning as fast as like speaking the language with somebody.

5511
03:10:02,430 --> 03:10:05,410
So you have to always be able to commute.

5512
03:10:05,510 --> 03:10:21,050
You have to become able to communicate with somebody to be able to to be able to build up your language learning and like talk speaking the language helps you learn so much like you just have to get a tutor.

5513
03:10:21,050 --> 03:10:27,130
You can grab like so many resources like, you know, I have a like lots of books and everything and like just study the book.

5514
03:10:27,310 --> 03:10:31,730
But if you don't speak that language regularly, then it won't help you.

5515
03:10:32,110 --> 03:10:35,050
Duolingo is not a good enough way to learn language.

5516
03:10:35,430 --> 03:10:37,030
Duolingo is like substitute.

5517
03:10:37,150 --> 03:10:41,410
You can use it as an extra learning but it's not the main thing you use for learning.

5518
03:10:41,530 --> 03:10:44,170
You have to have other ways to learn.

5519
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:46,530
You can't just rely on Duolingo.

5520
03:10:47,110 --> 03:10:47,550
Yeah.

5521
03:10:47,590 --> 03:10:47,870
Thank you.

5522
03:10:47,890 --> 03:10:48,350
The super chat.

5523
03:10:48,390 --> 03:10:48,690
Thank you.

5524
03:10:48,710 --> 03:10:49,210
Thank you.

5525
03:10:53,830 --> 03:10:54,230
Thank you.

5526
03:10:54,670 --> 03:10:55,170
Thank you.

5527
03:10:56,010 --> 03:11:01,170
Hearing everything you have to say made me realize that I'm better off pursuing content creation as a hobby rather than a job.

5528
03:11:01,290 --> 03:11:01,670
Thank you.

5529
03:11:01,710 --> 03:11:02,090
The super chat.

5530
03:11:02,130 --> 03:11:02,370
Thank you.

5531
03:11:02,390 --> 03:11:02,690
Thank you.

5532
03:11:02,710 --> 03:11:07,290
The thing is a lot of content creators start off as a hobby because it's not stable.

5533
03:11:07,430 --> 03:11:09,550
It's not a stable job and it's all about luck.

5534
03:11:10,310 --> 03:11:12,950
But it's all about trying to maximize your luck as well.

5535
03:11:13,570 --> 03:11:16,510
I would say oh yeah, someone says watch streams.

5536
03:11:16,810 --> 03:11:17,210
Yes.

5537
03:11:17,310 --> 03:11:20,810
If you want to get better watch streams in that language.

5538
03:11:20,810 --> 03:11:21,490
Which you're trying to learn.

5539
03:11:21,910 --> 03:11:43,250
I improved a lot in my Cantonese and my Mandarin because I when I lived in Asia, I would only watch the TV was playing and then I would like watch like shows like shows in that language because like, you know, the TV was on I had nothing to do and I was I couldn't play on my PC.

5540
03:11:43,410 --> 03:11:45,750
So I would just sit there and just watch and I got better.

5541
03:11:45,830 --> 03:11:47,990
I got better in my listening skills.

5542
03:11:48,310 --> 03:11:50,790
I've got better my listening skills and my speaking skills.

5543
03:11:50,790 --> 03:11:57,510
So I highly recommend watching streams in that language and you're going to slowly pick up the language as well.

5544
03:11:57,710 --> 03:12:01,130
If you're learning already, if you're learning already, it helps improve your learning.

5545
03:12:03,390 --> 03:12:05,030
It helps improve it a lot.

5546
03:12:06,170 --> 03:12:08,050
But yes, like I said content creation.

5547
03:12:08,170 --> 03:12:09,790
A lot of people start out as a hobby.

5548
03:12:09,910 --> 03:12:20,590
If it's best if you start out with having a as like a as like an extra income and not like, you know, go full in because like, you know, you always...

5549
03:12:20,590 --> 03:12:20,770
You need to have a good income.

5550
03:12:20,770 --> 03:12:21,390
You need a backup plan.

5551
03:12:21,450 --> 03:12:35,630
You always need to have a backup plan, you know, so like a lot of people start off content creation as a hobby and then later on when it gets more successful, you fold like you start investing more into it.

5552
03:12:35,690 --> 03:12:39,390
And then when you make enough money, you can like, you know, fully commit to it.

5553
03:12:39,470 --> 03:12:41,070
And that's like the safest way.

5554
03:12:41,570 --> 03:12:49,150
I think if you want to go safe, I would say like always have a backup plan because you don't don't quit your day job.

5555
03:12:49,250 --> 03:12:50,690
Yeah, always like make sure you have.

5556
03:12:50,770 --> 03:12:52,590
Something in the backup just in case.

5557
03:12:56,050 --> 03:12:56,750
Let's see.

5558
03:12:57,130 --> 03:12:57,670
What else?

5559
03:12:58,770 --> 03:13:00,230
How much do I have?

5560
03:13:06,540 --> 03:13:07,200
Let's see.

5561
03:13:08,500 --> 03:13:10,520
Bolly think of a super chat thing.

5562
03:13:10,520 --> 03:13:11,080
You thank you.

5563
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:18,480
I made a plushy of my VTuber and my subs want to buy it $35 plus 122 for international shipping.

5564
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:22,660
That is way too much.

5565
03:13:22,660 --> 03:13:24,400
How big is the plushy?

5566
03:13:24,840 --> 03:13:27,660
That is way too much for a plushy.

5567
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:31,620
It also, where do you live without doxing yourself?

5568
03:13:35,900 --> 03:13:41,340
Without doxing yourself like that is honestly way too much for shipping.

5569
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:47,500
It really depends on like how much the oh, okay.

5570
03:13:48,540 --> 03:13:52,220
How much the how big the plushy is too.

5571
03:13:52,660 --> 03:13:53,800
Because at that point.

5572
03:13:56,280 --> 03:14:01,960
That is way too expensive, especially like if it's an NA and plushy should not be that expensive for shipping.

5573
03:14:02,100 --> 03:14:04,260
I don't know overseas shipping.

5574
03:14:04,440 --> 03:14:16,320
I don't know like how bad shipping is in other countries, but like I know for NA that's way too expensive for international and at that point.

5575
03:14:16,360 --> 03:14:22,480
It's just so much easier to just find a distributor because distributors help if you're if the.

5576
03:14:22,480 --> 03:14:24,540
Plushy is like manufactured.

5577
03:14:26,730 --> 03:14:27,680
Not by you.

5578
03:14:27,800 --> 03:14:37,180
If you're not the one that made that plushy, then like at that point getting distributor helps with that.

5579
03:14:37,380 --> 03:14:52,260
But I feel like I feel like a hundred and twenty-two dollars in general is way too much for for from what I'm seeing my experience.

5580
03:14:52,260 --> 03:15:02,220
I know like in different countries it really depends on like how much shipping is in different countries.

5581
03:15:02,520 --> 03:15:12,740
And that's why some countries, some companies have distributors in like cheaper places.

5582
03:15:13,060 --> 03:15:15,040
Like not cheaper places, in like in that place.

5583
03:15:15,300 --> 03:15:19,340
Like the distributor would be like you know they want to distribute stuff in America.

5584
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:21,860
But the company is in Japan.

5585
03:15:22,340 --> 03:15:23,760
They will buy a warehouse.

5586
03:15:23,980 --> 03:15:26,380
They would have a warehouse in America for cheaper shipping.

5587
03:15:26,600 --> 03:15:27,460
Stuff like that.

5588
03:15:27,600 --> 03:15:29,280
Just to help with shipping and stuff.

5589
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:33,820
And that's why people find distributors because to help with shipping.

5590
03:15:38,440 --> 03:15:39,480
Let's see...

5591
03:15:41,660 --> 03:15:43,580
I'm trying to see what else to answer.

5592
03:15:50,440 --> 03:15:51,780
Nyanah, thank you for the super chat.

5593
03:15:51,900 --> 03:15:52,120
Thank you.

5594
03:15:52,300 --> 03:15:57,540
Hi Doki, my question is how to smoothly approach other streamers to make genuine connections?

5595
03:15:58,940 --> 03:16:00,520
Twitter and their chat.

5596
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:06,860
A lot of my friends I've made before I you know started being a serious Vtuber.

5597
03:16:07,060 --> 03:16:09,320
Like before the friends I made like two years.

5598
03:16:09,480 --> 03:16:13,620
Like friends I made before I started being serious Vtubing two years ago.

5599
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:17,720
It was from Twitter and Twitch chat.

5600
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:19,320
Like I was a Twitch chat.

5601
03:16:19,340 --> 03:16:20,840
And I would like hang out.

5602
03:16:20,900 --> 03:16:21,660
I would raid them.

5603
03:16:21,820 --> 03:16:25,680
I would raid them and then a lot of them are artists too.

5604
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:29,820
A lot of the friends I made because I was an artist Vtuber.

5605
03:16:30,180 --> 03:16:32,620
So I would draw a lot.

5606
03:16:32,840 --> 03:16:35,420
And like you know I just like do art streams and everything.

5607
03:16:35,820 --> 03:16:42,220
So and because of that I made friends by raiding other Twitch streamers.

5608
03:16:42,440 --> 03:16:47,600
And also like talking to them on Twitter and interacting with them.

5609
03:16:47,720 --> 03:16:49,320
And then they'll like tweet something.

5610
03:16:49,340 --> 03:16:52,220
Like they'll tweet art and I'm like oh my god I love your art.

5611
03:16:52,380 --> 03:16:53,100
And stuff like that.

5612
03:16:53,340 --> 03:16:56,320
And I would like give them like signal boosts them if they want.

5613
03:16:56,520 --> 03:16:57,740
That they have like they tweet something.

5614
03:16:58,020 --> 03:17:01,900
I would like boost their tweets and stuff by retweeting it.

5615
03:17:02,040 --> 03:17:05,560
And like you know talk to them on Discord and talk to them on Twitch.

5616
03:17:05,780 --> 03:17:07,880
And like play games with them on stream.

5617
03:17:08,140 --> 03:17:13,500
Like it's all about just like being consistent and stuff like that.

5618
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:16,660
Obviously I am a lot more busy now.

5619
03:17:16,660 --> 03:17:18,560
I'm not a lot more busy now.

5620
03:17:18,620 --> 03:17:24,300
So I don't have that you know I don't have time to really like do that anymore.

5621
03:17:24,700 --> 03:17:33,920
And now I just like you know I it's a whole harder for me to make more friends.

5622
03:17:33,980 --> 03:17:36,020
Just because I have a lot of stuff going on.

5623
03:17:36,180 --> 03:17:39,980
And I have to make sure I can balance my schedule and stuff like that.

5624
03:17:40,140 --> 03:17:40,980
But back then.

5625
03:17:42,940 --> 03:17:46,060
Back then I would just you know just hang out and talk to them.

5626
03:17:46,140 --> 03:17:46,640
And just raid them.

5627
03:17:46,660 --> 03:17:47,920
And raid their streams.

5628
03:17:48,180 --> 03:17:50,700
And because I wanted to like know them more.

5629
03:17:51,440 --> 03:17:51,880
Uh...

5630
03:17:52,880 --> 03:17:53,500
Let's see.

5631
03:17:55,500 --> 03:17:56,160
Big boy.

5632
03:17:56,380 --> 03:17:57,140
Thank you for the super chat.

5633
03:17:57,200 --> 03:17:57,420
Thank you.

5634
03:17:57,440 --> 03:17:57,780
Thank you.

5635
03:17:57,820 --> 03:17:58,380
Hi Doki.

5636
03:17:58,460 --> 03:17:59,160
Quick question.

5637
03:17:59,320 --> 03:18:02,000
Is it possible for me to start streaming as a hobby despite having...

5638
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:02,240
Yes!

5639
03:18:02,760 --> 03:18:04,780
You can have any time block.

5640
03:18:04,900 --> 03:18:07,200
I used to be a degen streamer.

5641
03:18:07,220 --> 03:18:10,120
I wouldn't start my stream when I was a Twitch streamer.

5642
03:18:10,160 --> 03:18:12,160
I would stream at 9pm.

5643
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:16,440
And I had an audience for 9pm streams.

5644
03:18:16,480 --> 03:18:16,640
And I had an audience for 9pm streams.

5645
03:18:16,660 --> 03:18:18,940
Sometimes I stream at 1am.

5646
03:18:19,440 --> 03:18:22,080
And I had an audience for that time.

5647
03:18:22,240 --> 03:18:24,800
I was known as the degen hour streamer.

5648
03:18:24,840 --> 03:18:28,200
Like if people were up in degen hours time.

5649
03:18:28,360 --> 03:18:30,400
Or people on the other side of the world.

5650
03:18:30,620 --> 03:18:33,460
Wanted an English speaking streamer to watch.

5651
03:18:33,800 --> 03:18:35,400
I was there for them.

5652
03:18:35,820 --> 03:18:36,460
But yes.

5653
03:18:36,640 --> 03:18:37,360
It doesn't matter.

5654
03:18:37,720 --> 03:18:38,640
Any time is possible.

5655
03:18:39,140 --> 03:18:40,080
You don't have to worry.

5656
03:18:41,060 --> 03:18:42,940
Any time is...

5657
03:18:42,940 --> 03:18:43,880
You just stream.

5658
03:18:45,280 --> 03:18:46,640
Like just stream.

5659
03:18:46,640 --> 03:18:47,980
If you have a...

5660
03:18:48,400 --> 03:18:50,880
A really bad...

5661
03:18:50,880 --> 03:18:52,380
Work hours schedule.

5662
03:18:52,840 --> 03:18:55,240
Just make that your consistent stream hours.

5663
03:18:55,680 --> 03:18:58,620
There is an audience base somewhere for it.

5664
03:18:59,460 --> 03:19:00,140
Ummm...

5665
03:19:01,260 --> 03:19:02,160
Let's see.

5666
03:19:03,660 --> 03:19:04,340
Uhh...

5667
03:19:04,340 --> 03:19:07,920
How do you find collabs as a small streamer?

5668
03:19:07,940 --> 03:19:09,580
Literally little friends, connection and networking.

5669
03:19:09,800 --> 03:19:10,420
Thank you for the super chat.

5670
03:19:10,520 --> 03:19:10,800
Thank you.

5671
03:19:11,100 --> 03:19:14,460
I would suggest...

5672
03:19:14,460 --> 03:19:16,260
Find other people...

5673
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:17,440
Around your...

5674
03:19:18,600 --> 03:19:19,720
Viewer level.

5675
03:19:20,080 --> 03:19:21,760
And just interact with them.

5676
03:19:21,920 --> 03:19:23,840
They want connections too.

5677
03:19:24,080 --> 03:19:25,120
As an indie.

5678
03:19:25,300 --> 03:19:26,920
That's the biggest thing as an indie.

5679
03:19:27,200 --> 03:19:28,720
We all want to find a group.

5680
03:19:28,820 --> 03:19:30,460
That's why I'm doing so many collabs.

5681
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:34,080
Because I'm trying to find a consistent group.

5682
03:19:34,280 --> 03:19:35,220
To hang out with.

5683
03:19:35,480 --> 03:19:38,500
To see who I groove with the most.

5684
03:19:38,780 --> 03:19:40,820
So I'm trying to collab with like...

5685
03:19:40,820 --> 03:19:42,760
A bunch of people from different areas.

5686
03:19:43,160 --> 03:19:43,980
To like...

5687
03:19:44,520 --> 03:19:45,420
Meet new people.

5688
03:19:46,640 --> 03:19:47,980
Just want to have a...

5689
03:19:48,440 --> 03:19:50,760
Consistent group of people to just hit up to...

5690
03:19:50,760 --> 03:19:51,980
Do games with.

5691
03:19:52,240 --> 03:19:54,040
And umm...

5692
03:19:54,600 --> 03:19:55,940
Just reach out.

5693
03:19:56,260 --> 03:19:58,640
Like the biggest hurdle...

5694
03:19:58,640 --> 03:20:00,680
Is just reaching out to people.

5695
03:20:00,980 --> 03:20:02,620
And I'm pretty sure...

5696
03:20:02,620 --> 03:20:04,980
Those people who are around your range...

5697
03:20:04,980 --> 03:20:06,500
They want more friends too.

5698
03:20:06,720 --> 03:20:07,780
They want more connections.

5699
03:20:07,940 --> 03:20:10,420
They want to find new vtubers, new friends.

5700
03:20:10,680 --> 03:20:12,180
But never forget...

5701
03:20:12,180 --> 03:20:13,980
Who was there for you.

5702
03:20:13,980 --> 03:20:14,920
Never forget.

5703
03:20:15,240 --> 03:20:17,500
There's a lot of people that I used to know...

5704
03:20:17,500 --> 03:20:19,700
That was like around my view count...

5705
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:20,740
When I was like a lot smaller.

5706
03:20:21,460 --> 03:20:23,020
And then umm...

5707
03:20:23,020 --> 03:20:24,940
They're now really big streamers.

5708
03:20:25,560 --> 03:20:26,460
You don't know.

5709
03:20:26,980 --> 03:20:29,180
Just never forget what they did for you.

5710
03:20:29,240 --> 03:20:30,180
And what you did for them.

5711
03:20:32,140 --> 03:20:33,180
So umm...

5712
03:20:33,180 --> 03:20:35,840
You always just remember that like...

5713
03:20:36,600 --> 03:20:37,120
Umm...

5714
03:20:37,120 --> 03:20:39,000
Just who stuck out for you.

5715
03:20:39,080 --> 03:20:40,120
And who like was there.

5716
03:20:40,120 --> 03:20:42,160
Just remember that.

5717
03:20:42,440 --> 03:20:43,980
And just reach out to people...

5718
03:20:43,980 --> 03:20:45,480
Around your similar range.

5719
03:20:45,740 --> 03:20:47,060
Because I'm pretty sure...

5720
03:20:47,060 --> 03:20:48,800
They're also looking for friends.

5721
03:20:49,060 --> 03:20:50,360
They're also looking for people to play with.

5722
03:20:50,440 --> 03:20:51,700
That's one of the hardest parts in indie.

5723
03:20:52,140 --> 03:20:52,980
People just...

5724
03:20:52,980 --> 03:20:54,260
And why people want to join a community.

5725
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:55,900
They want to have...

5726
03:20:57,400 --> 03:20:58,880
Sorry, why people want to join a company.

5727
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:00,180
They want to have a community.

5728
03:21:00,380 --> 03:21:02,400
That they can just hit up on.

5729
03:21:02,700 --> 03:21:03,420
And bam!

5730
03:21:04,280 --> 03:21:04,720
Easy.

5731
03:21:04,960 --> 03:21:06,020
They just want a community.

5732
03:21:11,740 --> 03:21:12,100
Umm...

5733
03:21:12,880 --> 03:21:13,240
Umm...

5734
03:21:13,240 --> 03:21:13,920
Let's see.

5735
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:15,360
Thanks.

5736
03:21:15,360 --> 03:21:16,040
Thank you for the super chat.

5737
03:21:16,100 --> 03:21:16,340
Thank you.

5738
03:21:16,360 --> 03:21:16,660
Thank you.

5739
03:21:16,680 --> 03:21:19,140
How do you come up with good jokes on the spot and chat entertain?

5740
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:23,060
So is it wise to separate content like music and game on different channels?

5741
03:21:23,240 --> 03:21:24,080
Thank you for the super chat.

5742
03:21:24,180 --> 03:21:24,500
Thank you.

5743
03:21:24,520 --> 03:21:25,060
Thank you.

5744
03:21:26,180 --> 03:21:26,540
Umm...

5745
03:21:28,060 --> 03:21:31,120
How do I come up with good jokes on the spot and chat...

5746
03:21:31,120 --> 03:21:32,580
That's just a talent.

5747
03:21:32,720 --> 03:21:33,020
Like...

5748
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:37,600
I can't...

5749
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:39,440
I can't give advice on that.

5750
03:21:39,500 --> 03:21:40,100
Because I'm not good at it.

5751
03:21:40,120 --> 03:21:42,500
I naturally just had that.

5752
03:21:42,520 --> 03:21:43,560
As a skill.

5753
03:21:43,820 --> 03:21:44,460
For me.

5754
03:21:44,680 --> 03:21:45,680
So like... I'm sorry.

5755
03:21:45,780 --> 03:21:50,460
I unfortunately can't give you advice on how to come up with good jokes on the spot.

5756
03:21:50,980 --> 03:21:53,560
And like chat entertain is just...

5757
03:21:54,200 --> 03:21:55,900
For chat entertainment...

5758
03:21:55,900 --> 03:21:56,420
Don't...

5759
03:21:57,540 --> 03:22:00,880
Don't bash something over and over again.

5760
03:22:00,920 --> 03:22:02,120
Don't beat up a dead horse.

5761
03:22:02,460 --> 03:22:03,440
That's really it.

5762
03:22:03,640 --> 03:22:05,100
Like chat entertainment...

5763
03:22:05,100 --> 03:22:07,120
As long as you don't beat a dead horse.

5764
03:22:07,400 --> 03:22:10,100
And like keep bringing up something over and over and over again.

5765
03:22:10,840 --> 03:22:11,320
Repetitively.

5766
03:22:11,920 --> 03:22:13,980
That's like the best advice I can give you.

5767
03:22:14,260 --> 03:22:14,740
Like...

5768
03:22:14,740 --> 03:22:17,900
There are moments where like some jokes would come up that I would say.

5769
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:19,220
That became like memes.

5770
03:22:19,400 --> 03:22:21,620
And like phrases that were like...

5771
03:22:21,620 --> 03:22:23,620
My chat would consistently bring up.

5772
03:22:23,860 --> 03:22:26,040
But I wouldn't say it that often.

5773
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:27,120
I would say it like...

5774
03:22:27,120 --> 03:22:28,880
Or I would never say it ever again.

5775
03:22:29,080 --> 03:22:31,340
I say this phrase once and then...

5776
03:22:31,980 --> 03:22:32,840
It's forever.

5777
03:22:33,180 --> 03:22:34,240
It's like the...

5778
03:22:34,980 --> 03:22:36,620
The chat loves it so much.

5779
03:22:36,720 --> 03:22:37,820
They always remember it.

5780
03:22:40,100 --> 03:22:41,040
I said it once.

5781
03:22:42,900 --> 03:22:44,540
On one stream.

5782
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:45,700
And then...

5783
03:22:45,700 --> 03:22:47,180
But it was my identity.

5784
03:22:52,980 --> 03:22:54,180
And like...

5785
03:22:54,180 --> 03:22:55,980
The thing is you have to know when...

5786
03:22:55,980 --> 03:22:57,840
To give the joke back.

5787
03:22:58,340 --> 03:23:00,140
Or like...

5788
03:23:00,140 --> 03:23:01,720
Or when to like...

5789
03:23:01,720 --> 03:23:02,680
Stop a joke.

5790
03:23:02,920 --> 03:23:06,620
Because you have to make it so that the chat doesn't get tired of it.

5791
03:23:07,320 --> 03:23:09,200
Because you don't overkill it.

5792
03:23:09,340 --> 03:23:09,900
Like...

5793
03:23:11,480 --> 03:23:14,520
As long as the chat is entertaining themselves.

5794
03:23:15,080 --> 03:23:16,520
That's all that matters.

5795
03:23:16,840 --> 03:23:18,120
And regarding like...

5796
03:23:18,120 --> 03:23:20,400
How do I come up with these jokes on the spot.

5797
03:23:20,720 --> 03:23:21,880
I think you guys should know.

5798
03:23:22,040 --> 03:23:23,520
When I first started streaming.

5799
03:23:24,600 --> 03:23:25,720
I wasn't...

5800
03:23:25,720 --> 03:23:28,120
I got peer pressure to stream.

5801
03:23:28,840 --> 03:23:29,400
I...

5802
03:23:30,100 --> 03:23:30,460
Like...

5803
03:23:31,080 --> 03:23:34,400
I didn't stream because I wanted to be a streamer.

5804
03:23:35,140 --> 03:23:36,540
This is a little lore.

5805
03:23:36,800 --> 03:23:38,500
I don't know if I told this before.

5806
03:23:38,860 --> 03:23:39,860
I'm pretty sure I have.

5807
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:42,360
Basically I got discovered in Overwatch.

5808
03:23:42,780 --> 03:23:43,840
And like...

5809
03:23:43,840 --> 03:23:44,780
Because...

5810
03:23:44,780 --> 03:23:46,760
I was using...

5811
03:23:46,760 --> 03:23:49,460
Voice chat to like...

5812
03:23:49,460 --> 03:23:50,140
Play Overwatch.

5813
03:23:50,520 --> 03:23:52,600
And I had a streamer in my game.

5814
03:23:52,980 --> 03:23:55,840
And then later on I became friends.

5815
03:23:55,880 --> 03:23:57,020
With some streamers.

5816
03:23:57,020 --> 03:23:58,300
Who played Overwatch.

5817
03:23:59,400 --> 03:24:01,520
Like they was all high ranked Overwatch.

5818
03:24:02,480 --> 03:24:03,160
And...

5819
03:24:04,100 --> 03:24:06,200
And then like they told me to start streaming.

5820
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:08,220
And so...

5821
03:24:08,220 --> 03:24:08,820
They were like...

5822
03:24:10,100 --> 03:24:10,640
I'm very entertaining.

5823
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:12,840
Because I would say like random shit.

5824
03:24:13,060 --> 03:24:20,180
Like these are like big Overwatch content creators.

5825
03:24:20,240 --> 03:24:21,040
At that time too.

5826
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:23,340
And like I would say like...

5827
03:24:23,980 --> 03:24:25,500
Something that would be funny.

5828
03:24:25,700 --> 03:24:27,260
And then like they would be like...

5829
03:24:27,260 --> 03:24:28,380
Wait you should like stream.

5830
03:24:28,580 --> 03:24:30,240
You can be a really good...

5831
03:24:30,240 --> 03:24:31,280
You're really entertaining.

5832
03:24:31,820 --> 03:24:33,660
Like you're really entertaining off stream.

5833
03:24:33,780 --> 03:24:34,980
And you're entertaining on stream.

5834
03:24:34,980 --> 03:24:36,140
Because at that time...

5835
03:24:36,140 --> 03:24:38,860
I had more energy off stream to actually be entertaining.

5836
03:24:39,220 --> 03:24:39,720
Like...

5837
03:24:41,660 --> 03:24:43,320
Like just hanging out.

5838
03:24:43,600 --> 03:24:44,100
You know?

5839
03:24:44,620 --> 03:24:45,900
Just hanging out.

5840
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:46,860
I had like...

5841
03:24:46,860 --> 03:24:48,240
I can entertain people.

5842
03:24:48,620 --> 03:24:49,800
Just hanging out.

5843
03:24:49,920 --> 03:24:51,660
Also to be fair.

5844
03:24:51,780 --> 03:24:53,020
Even when I hang out with people.

5845
03:24:53,100 --> 03:24:54,860
I say some fucking shit.

5846
03:24:54,980 --> 03:24:56,420
That would be like...

5847
03:24:56,420 --> 03:24:57,080
What the fuck.

5848
03:24:57,080 --> 03:24:57,260
Like...

5849
03:25:02,660 --> 03:25:03,220
So...

5850
03:25:04,940 --> 03:25:06,240
Because of that.

5851
03:25:06,320 --> 03:25:07,860
They were like you should start streaming.

5852
03:25:08,140 --> 03:25:08,880
And then I did.

5853
03:25:09,080 --> 03:25:12,480
I started streaming because of that.

5854
03:25:13,120 --> 03:25:15,040
And that's why I honestly...

5855
03:25:15,040 --> 03:25:17,040
Can't give advice on like how to do jokes.

5856
03:25:17,160 --> 03:25:18,880
And how to be entertaining.

5857
03:25:19,200 --> 03:25:20,860
Because like I said like...

5858
03:25:20,860 --> 03:25:23,440
The reason why I started streaming was because...

5859
03:25:23,440 --> 03:25:25,200
I literally got peer pressure too.

5860
03:25:25,420 --> 03:25:26,720
By like my friends.

5861
03:25:27,080 --> 03:25:27,600
Because they were like...

5862
03:25:27,600 --> 03:25:28,020
Oh my god.

5863
03:25:28,100 --> 03:25:29,140
You're pretty entertaining.

5864
03:25:29,360 --> 03:25:30,060
You should try streaming.

5865
03:25:30,240 --> 03:25:32,440
But I never committed to it.

5866
03:25:32,520 --> 03:25:33,560
I never like tried.

5867
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:35,780
I just did it for fun.

5868
03:25:36,240 --> 03:25:38,280
Like I never actually tried tried.

5869
03:25:38,620 --> 03:25:40,020
And never kept it consistent.

5870
03:25:40,740 --> 03:25:44,260
I had like moments where I took like...

5871
03:25:44,260 --> 03:25:46,760
4 plus months break without telling anybody.

5872
03:25:47,840 --> 03:25:49,200
Because I never...

5873
03:25:49,200 --> 03:25:50,160
Like I didn't...

5874
03:25:50,160 --> 03:25:51,660
I didn't have much.

5875
03:25:51,700 --> 03:25:53,020
I was barely an affiliate.

5876
03:25:53,360 --> 03:25:55,400
I was just like fucking around.

5877
03:25:57,080 --> 03:25:58,400
And I was like...

5878
03:25:58,400 --> 03:26:00,040
I'm not gonna play streaming.

5879
03:26:01,400 --> 03:26:02,260
I didn't...

5880
03:26:02,260 --> 03:26:03,680
I was just like alright.

5881
03:26:03,980 --> 03:26:05,280
I didn't take it seriously.

5882
03:26:05,620 --> 03:26:07,520
Because I didn't see it as a career.

5883
03:26:07,860 --> 03:26:09,360
I didn't see it as a...

5884
03:26:09,360 --> 03:26:10,740
It would happen multiple times.

5885
03:26:10,960 --> 03:26:11,740
It wasn't like...

5886
03:26:11,740 --> 03:26:14,220
Oh yeah the first time it was 4 months and I came back.

5887
03:26:14,480 --> 03:26:17,000
I would be like 4 months and then I stream for like...

5888
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:18,820
2-3 weeks or something.

5889
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:20,180
Or like an entire month.

5890
03:26:20,360 --> 03:26:22,220
And then I disappear for another 6 months.

5891
03:26:22,220 --> 03:26:24,700
And then I was just like...

5892
03:26:24,700 --> 03:26:25,020
Whatever.

5893
03:26:28,060 --> 03:26:30,120
So I never took it seriously.

5894
03:26:30,320 --> 03:26:32,020
I just did it for fun.

5895
03:26:32,820 --> 03:26:33,420
Um...

5896
03:26:34,140 --> 03:26:34,840
That's really...

5897
03:26:34,840 --> 03:26:37,160
That's why I can't give like actual advice on this.

5898
03:26:37,280 --> 03:26:40,500
Because I feel like I'm not the right person to...

5899
03:26:40,500 --> 03:26:41,680
Uh...

5900
03:26:41,680 --> 03:26:43,900
To give advice on how to be entertaining.

5901
03:26:44,240 --> 03:26:47,500
Because for me it was just naturally within me.

5902
03:26:48,180 --> 03:26:48,480
Um...

5903
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:51,240
Yeah you're lucky I don't do that anymore.

5904
03:26:51,380 --> 03:26:52,200
I actually don't do that anymore.

5905
03:26:52,220 --> 03:26:52,980
I think this is a job now.

5906
03:26:56,300 --> 03:26:59,260
We're so lucky that I actually see this as a job.

5907
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:00,100
We're so lucky that I actually see this as a job.

5908
03:27:01,480 --> 03:27:02,360
We're so lucky that I actually see this as a job.

5909
03:27:02,360 --> 03:27:04,260
Yeah the BarkKnights...

5910
03:27:04,260 --> 03:27:04,540
Yeah the BarkKnights...

5911
03:27:04,540 --> 03:27:06,080
The OG BarkKnights...

5912
03:27:06,080 --> 03:27:07,980
They're the strongest knights out there.

5913
03:27:08,120 --> 03:27:08,700
They...

5914
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:12,280
Okay, the OG Discord...

5915
03:27:12,280 --> 03:27:14,040
Is like still running.

5916
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:16,020
The OG Discord...

5917
03:27:16,020 --> 03:27:18,580
That I started off with...

5918
03:27:18,580 --> 03:27:19,380
That's been...

5919
03:27:19,380 --> 03:27:22,300
These people, those fans, they still exist.

5920
03:27:22,820 --> 03:27:24,260
And they're dragoons now.

5921
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:28,820
But they've been supporting me even through all these hiatuses.

5922
03:27:29,060 --> 03:27:30,940
Like, it's actually crazy.

5923
03:27:34,220 --> 03:27:35,160
Oh my god.

5924
03:27:35,360 --> 03:27:38,460
But it's also like how I...

5925
03:27:39,620 --> 03:27:42,200
I forgot to give you guys this, but like...

5926
03:27:42,200 --> 03:27:43,840
How to nurture a community.

5927
03:27:44,400 --> 03:27:48,800
Because what you give to the community is what they give back to you.

5928
03:27:48,800 --> 03:27:52,860
So like, that's why you have to love and care your community.

5929
03:27:53,160 --> 03:27:55,360
Because they do so much to support you.

5930
03:27:55,580 --> 03:27:59,040
They... like, my Bark Knights, they've been there for me.

5931
03:27:59,520 --> 03:28:01,240
For all my hiatuses.

5932
03:28:01,420 --> 03:28:03,860
But like, I still try to like...

5933
03:28:03,860 --> 03:28:05,940
Like, let them know I care.

5934
03:28:06,140 --> 03:28:07,140
Like, in a way.

5935
03:28:07,340 --> 03:28:08,280
So like...

5936
03:28:09,340 --> 03:28:15,060
You have to be able to nurture a really loving and loyal community.

5937
03:28:15,640 --> 03:28:18,120
And first off, you need to name your community.

5938
03:28:18,120 --> 03:28:19,360
You didn't need a name.

5939
03:28:22,580 --> 03:28:25,080
They need to unite under a name.

5940
03:28:25,340 --> 03:28:26,680
And that is what I did.

5941
03:28:26,760 --> 03:28:27,860
You guys are dragoons.

5942
03:28:27,920 --> 03:28:29,220
We had Bark Knights before.

5943
03:28:29,880 --> 03:28:30,400
Um...

5944
03:28:30,400 --> 03:28:31,560
And stuff like that.

5945
03:28:32,080 --> 03:28:32,600
And...

5946
03:28:32,600 --> 03:28:33,920
You need to be...

5947
03:28:33,920 --> 03:28:34,700
Uh...

5948
03:28:34,700 --> 03:28:36,420
You need to be able to...

5949
03:28:36,420 --> 03:28:37,320
Uh...

5950
03:28:37,320 --> 03:28:38,140
Know...

5951
03:28:38,140 --> 03:28:39,040
Do stuff...

5952
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:41,400
Give back to your community.

5953
03:28:42,220 --> 03:28:45,880
You have to be able to give back to your community every so often.

5954
03:28:46,060 --> 03:28:48,100
When I was a Twitch streamer...

5955
03:28:48,100 --> 03:28:49,460
I would have like...

5956
03:28:49,460 --> 03:28:50,460
Sketch raffles.

5957
03:28:50,740 --> 03:28:52,260
By the way, which reminds me.

5958
03:28:52,300 --> 03:28:54,140
I need to fucking do the sketches and stuff.

5959
03:28:54,440 --> 03:28:55,500
From the donations.

5960
03:28:56,020 --> 03:28:56,500
Uh...

5961
03:28:56,500 --> 03:28:57,540
I'm sorry.

5962
03:28:57,660 --> 03:28:58,520
I've been so busy.

5963
03:28:58,700 --> 03:28:59,340
But that's...

5964
03:28:59,340 --> 03:28:59,980
Um...

5965
03:28:59,980 --> 03:29:01,060
When I was a Twitch streamer...

5966
03:29:01,060 --> 03:29:02,620
I would have sketch raffles.

5967
03:29:02,860 --> 03:29:04,220
And then the top...

5968
03:29:04,740 --> 03:29:05,220
Three...

5969
03:29:05,220 --> 03:29:05,800
And then like...

5970
03:29:05,800 --> 03:29:06,780
I would have like...

5971
03:29:06,780 --> 03:29:08,520
Raffles where like...

5972
03:29:08,520 --> 03:29:09,000
Um...

5973
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:09,880
All my subs...

5974
03:29:09,880 --> 03:29:11,140
I would have like a lottery.

5975
03:29:11,420 --> 03:29:12,220
Where like...

5976
03:29:12,220 --> 03:29:13,040
Uh...

5977
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:16,220
All my subscribers were put in a lottery.

5978
03:29:16,500 --> 03:29:17,280
And then...

5979
03:29:17,280 --> 03:29:17,840
Um...

5980
03:29:18,100 --> 03:29:18,920
If you win the...

5981
03:29:18,920 --> 03:29:20,540
I would pick like five subscribers.

5982
03:29:20,980 --> 03:29:22,560
To win art from me.

5983
03:29:22,720 --> 03:29:23,340
And then...

5984
03:29:23,340 --> 03:29:25,780
My most gifted subscriber...

5985
03:29:25,780 --> 03:29:27,080
I would send them a postcard.

5986
03:29:27,180 --> 03:29:27,720
To be like...

5987
03:29:27,720 --> 03:29:28,400
Thank you for...

5988
03:29:28,400 --> 03:29:29,880
For supporting me this month.

5989
03:29:30,300 --> 03:29:31,240
Like stuff like that.

5990
03:29:31,320 --> 03:29:33,500
I had made like little gift bundles and everything.

5991
03:29:33,840 --> 03:29:35,200
And I didn't even have like...

5992
03:29:35,200 --> 03:29:36,600
A large viewership.

5993
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:37,380
I didn't have like...

5994
03:29:37,380 --> 03:29:38,420
A large viewership.

5995
03:29:38,420 --> 03:29:40,740
But I had like a very dedicated community.

5996
03:29:40,900 --> 03:29:42,540
Because I really appreciated them.

5997
03:29:42,700 --> 03:29:44,460
I really appreciate what they did.

5998
03:29:44,720 --> 03:29:45,420
And like...

5999
03:29:45,420 --> 03:29:47,140
Sort of supporting me for this long.

6000
03:29:47,360 --> 03:29:47,980
And I would like...

6001
03:29:48,100 --> 03:29:50,040
Make like little like gift bundles and stuff.

6002
03:29:50,100 --> 03:29:51,100
For my top supporters.

6003
03:29:51,220 --> 03:29:53,080
And be like a personal postcard.

6004
03:29:53,280 --> 03:29:53,780
And be like...

6005
03:29:53,780 --> 03:29:55,280
Oh thank you for all the gifted subs.

6006
03:29:55,580 --> 03:29:56,460
I had...

6007
03:29:56,460 --> 03:29:56,940
Guys.

6008
03:29:57,080 --> 03:29:57,940
I had...

6009
03:29:57,940 --> 03:29:59,100
At one point...

6010
03:29:59,100 --> 03:29:59,900
I have...

6011
03:29:59,900 --> 03:30:02,420
I had 500 subs...

6012
03:30:02,940 --> 03:30:03,620
On Twitch.

6013
03:30:04,260 --> 03:30:06,200
But my average viewership...

6014
03:30:06,200 --> 03:30:07,900
Was 30 to 40.

6015
03:30:16,550 --> 03:30:17,150
Like...

6016
03:30:17,670 --> 03:30:18,970
Because I was like...

6017
03:30:18,970 --> 03:30:19,410
I was...

6018
03:30:19,410 --> 03:30:20,150
I just like...

6019
03:30:20,150 --> 03:30:21,790
I was just like...

6020
03:30:21,790 --> 03:30:22,430
Uh...

6021
03:30:22,430 --> 03:30:23,750
I was just like...

6022
03:30:23,750 --> 03:30:25,570
I really cared about my community.

6023
03:30:25,930 --> 03:30:27,630
I really cared about them.

6024
03:30:27,750 --> 03:30:27,990
I...

6025
03:30:27,990 --> 03:30:29,390
Because I...

6026
03:30:29,390 --> 03:30:30,990
I really appreciated them.

6027
03:30:31,850 --> 03:30:32,370
And...

6028
03:30:32,370 --> 03:30:32,950
Uh...

6029
03:30:32,950 --> 03:30:34,690
I really appreciated them.

6030
03:30:35,330 --> 03:30:35,850
And...

6031
03:30:35,850 --> 03:30:37,770
I tried very hard to show my appreciation.

6032
03:30:38,670 --> 03:30:39,190
And...

6033
03:30:39,190 --> 03:30:39,510
Uh...

6034
03:30:39,510 --> 03:30:39,690
Here.

6035
03:30:39,750 --> 03:30:41,450
Thank you for the five gifted ships.

6036
03:30:41,590 --> 03:30:41,890
Thank you.

6037
03:30:41,930 --> 03:30:42,490
Thank you.

6038
03:30:43,430 --> 03:30:43,950
Um...

6039
03:30:43,950 --> 03:30:44,930
So...

6040
03:30:44,930 --> 03:30:45,310
So...

6041
03:30:45,310 --> 03:30:45,830
Like...

6042
03:30:45,830 --> 03:30:46,910
It's all about...

6043
03:30:46,910 --> 03:30:47,170
Like...

6044
03:30:47,170 --> 03:30:48,970
Being a really good content curator...

6045
03:30:48,970 --> 03:30:51,030
Is making sure you give back to your community.

6046
03:30:51,290 --> 03:30:52,290
And is making sure...

6047
03:30:52,290 --> 03:30:53,730
You show them that you really care.

6048
03:30:53,890 --> 03:30:54,750
And that you care...

6049
03:30:54,750 --> 03:30:57,190
Because you can't be a content creator without your viewers.

6050
03:30:57,310 --> 03:30:59,430
And you have to show them that you appreciate it.

6051
03:30:59,650 --> 03:31:01,690
And that's why I try really hard...

6052
03:31:01,690 --> 03:31:02,810
With doing all these projects.

6053
03:31:02,970 --> 03:31:04,010
Doing all these like...

6054
03:31:04,010 --> 03:31:04,950
Fun things.

6055
03:31:04,990 --> 03:31:05,670
Like events.

6056
03:31:05,950 --> 03:31:06,430
And like...

6057
03:31:06,430 --> 03:31:07,810
Fun things with you guys.

6058
03:31:07,990 --> 03:31:09,530
And like trying to do lots of like...

6059
03:31:09,530 --> 03:31:11,150
Interactive stuff with you guys.

6060
03:31:11,190 --> 03:31:12,510
Is how I show I care.

6061
03:31:12,690 --> 03:31:14,310
And how I like...

6062
03:31:15,110 --> 03:31:15,550
Um...

6063
03:31:15,550 --> 03:31:16,570
And like...

6064
03:31:16,570 --> 03:31:17,830
All the things I...

6065
03:31:18,390 --> 03:31:18,830
Uh...

6066
03:31:18,830 --> 03:31:19,370
Want...

6067
03:31:19,370 --> 03:31:20,830
Because I couldn't be here without you guys.

6068
03:31:20,890 --> 03:31:22,130
So it has to be known.

6069
03:31:22,990 --> 03:31:23,430
Uh...

6070
03:31:24,150 --> 03:31:24,590
Alright.

6071
03:31:26,550 --> 03:31:27,430
Let's see...

6072
03:31:28,430 --> 03:31:28,870
Uh...

6073
03:31:28,870 --> 03:31:29,530
What else?

6074
03:31:29,650 --> 03:31:30,650
What else can I...

6075
03:31:30,650 --> 03:31:31,070
What else?

6076
03:31:31,390 --> 03:31:31,730
Uh...

6077
03:31:31,730 --> 03:31:32,830
Holy shit!

6078
03:31:32,890 --> 03:31:33,490
I almost...

6079
03:31:33,490 --> 03:31:34,030
Hahaha!

6080
03:31:36,010 --> 03:31:36,450
That's...

6081
03:31:36,450 --> 03:31:37,230
Woah!

6082
03:31:37,570 --> 03:31:39,650
I did not realize how long I've been streaming for.

6083
03:31:39,950 --> 03:31:40,290
Hahaha!

6084
03:31:41,750 --> 03:31:43,090
Hanta, thank you for the super chat.

6085
03:31:43,170 --> 03:31:43,470
Thank you.

6086
03:31:43,490 --> 03:31:44,070
Thank you.

6087
03:31:45,450 --> 03:31:45,890
Uh...

6088
03:31:45,890 --> 03:31:48,210
Yeah, sorry small and care about those around you.

6089
03:31:48,310 --> 03:31:49,590
Glad to hear these tips, Doki.

6090
03:31:49,630 --> 03:31:50,290
I'm doing fine too.

6091
03:31:50,370 --> 03:31:51,170
But I cannot draw nor...

6092
03:31:51,170 --> 03:31:51,950
Draw nor do...

6093
03:31:51,950 --> 03:31:53,410
Anything more than playing games and talk...

6094
03:31:53,410 --> 03:31:54,010
With them.

6095
03:31:54,090 --> 03:31:54,650
What can I do?

6096
03:31:54,710 --> 03:31:55,590
Thank you for the super chat.

6097
03:31:55,710 --> 03:31:55,970
Thank you.

6098
03:31:55,990 --> 03:31:56,430
Thank you.

6099
03:31:56,590 --> 03:31:58,010
That's sometimes what they need.

6100
03:31:58,210 --> 03:32:00,710
The chat just wants your entertainment and your company.

6101
03:32:01,170 --> 03:32:03,730
You don't have to do more than like...

6102
03:32:03,730 --> 03:32:04,150
Uh...

6103
03:32:04,150 --> 03:32:05,710
What they're happy with.

6104
03:32:06,370 --> 03:32:06,810
Like...

6105
03:32:06,810 --> 03:32:07,770
By the time...

6106
03:32:07,770 --> 03:32:08,430
You...

6107
03:32:08,990 --> 03:32:10,070
Have a bigger...

6108
03:32:10,070 --> 03:32:11,130
Viewer base...

6109
03:32:11,130 --> 03:32:13,990
You can start reinvesting more into your channel.

6110
03:32:14,530 --> 03:32:15,950
Like when I first started...

6111
03:32:15,950 --> 03:32:17,850
All I did was just play video games.

6112
03:32:18,250 --> 03:32:19,190
And then I...

6113
03:32:19,190 --> 03:32:20,710
The bigger I got...

6114
03:32:20,710 --> 03:32:21,930
The more I reinvested...

6115
03:32:21,950 --> 03:32:22,770
Sometimes...

6116
03:32:22,770 --> 03:32:23,950
Like as you said...

6117
03:32:23,950 --> 03:32:24,570
You start small.

6118
03:32:24,850 --> 03:32:26,510
And then the bigger you get...

6119
03:32:26,510 --> 03:32:28,490
The more money you have earned...

6120
03:32:28,490 --> 03:32:29,850
Reinvest in your channel.

6121
03:32:30,030 --> 03:32:31,290
Or save money.

6122
03:32:31,910 --> 03:32:32,470
Honestly...

6123
03:32:32,470 --> 03:32:33,890
There's a lot of people who do...

6124
03:32:33,890 --> 03:32:34,770
Vtubing different ways.

6125
03:32:34,930 --> 03:32:35,610
They want to...

6126
03:32:35,610 --> 03:32:37,130
Use Vtubing to...

6127
03:32:37,130 --> 03:32:38,510
Be able to afford...

6128
03:32:38,510 --> 03:32:40,150
A house in the future...

6129
03:32:40,150 --> 03:32:41,110
Or like an apartment.

6130
03:32:42,010 --> 03:32:42,570
Um...

6131
03:32:43,230 --> 03:32:44,590
I put it in...

6132
03:32:44,590 --> 03:32:46,490
I reinvest in my content...

6133
03:32:46,490 --> 03:32:47,730
Because like...

6134
03:32:47,730 --> 03:32:48,650
I enjoy...

6135
03:32:48,650 --> 03:32:49,930
Making content...

6136
03:32:49,930 --> 03:32:51,450
And I enjoy reinvesting...

6137
03:32:51,450 --> 03:32:51,930
For the future.

6138
03:32:51,930 --> 03:32:52,310
And...

6139
03:32:52,730 --> 03:32:53,890
I'm playing...

6140
03:32:53,890 --> 03:32:54,610
More so...

6141
03:32:54,610 --> 03:32:55,570
Of the long game.

6142
03:32:55,850 --> 03:32:56,890
Because I...

6143
03:32:56,890 --> 03:32:59,530
Can save for a house...

6144
03:32:59,530 --> 03:33:00,430
For like...

6145
03:33:00,430 --> 03:33:02,090
An actual place to live...

6146
03:33:02,090 --> 03:33:03,790
Later on down the line.

6147
03:33:04,170 --> 03:33:05,130
For me...

6148
03:33:05,450 --> 03:33:06,150
This is me.

6149
03:33:06,350 --> 03:33:07,610
Don't follow this...

6150
03:33:07,610 --> 03:33:09,170
If you don't have a stable enough...

6151
03:33:09,170 --> 03:33:09,670
Like career.

6152
03:33:09,970 --> 03:33:11,310
But for me...

6153
03:33:11,310 --> 03:33:13,590
Content creation for me...

6154
03:33:14,930 --> 03:33:16,770
Obviously would never be long term.

6155
03:33:17,530 --> 03:33:18,170
Because...

6156
03:33:18,170 --> 03:33:19,550
Content creation...

6157
03:33:19,550 --> 03:33:20,730
Never has...

6158
03:33:20,730 --> 03:33:21,830
A long lifespan.

6159
03:33:21,830 --> 03:33:21,910
Because...

6160
03:33:21,910 --> 03:33:22,170
I don't have a long lifespan...

6161
03:33:22,170 --> 03:33:23,250
Within the internet.

6162
03:33:24,050 --> 03:33:24,570
Unless...

6163
03:33:24,570 --> 03:33:25,910
You're the 0.001%.

6164
03:33:27,130 --> 03:33:28,290
So for me...

6165
03:33:28,290 --> 03:33:30,250
I try to take advantage...

6166
03:33:30,250 --> 03:33:31,590
Of what I can do...

6167
03:33:31,590 --> 03:33:32,510
As a content creator.

6168
03:33:32,850 --> 03:33:34,410
And what I can invest in...

6169
03:33:34,410 --> 03:33:35,250
As a content creator.

6170
03:33:36,270 --> 03:33:36,790
Uh...

6171
03:33:36,790 --> 03:33:38,330
This is not financial advice.

6172
03:33:38,690 --> 03:33:39,790
This is not financial advice.

6173
03:33:40,050 --> 03:33:41,350
But I put my money...

6174
03:33:41,350 --> 03:33:42,590
Investing in my channel.

6175
03:33:42,890 --> 03:33:44,050
Because I know...

6176
03:33:44,050 --> 03:33:44,810
This is not...

6177
03:33:44,810 --> 03:33:45,850
For too long.

6178
03:33:46,330 --> 03:33:47,570
In terms of like...

6179
03:33:47,570 --> 03:33:48,110
My future.

6180
03:33:48,570 --> 03:33:49,310
And like...

6181
03:33:49,310 --> 03:33:50,930
I want to be able to experience this.

6182
03:33:51,370 --> 03:33:51,890
Uh...

6183
03:33:51,890 --> 03:33:52,330
Moment.

6184
03:33:52,930 --> 03:33:54,010
As much as I can.

6185
03:33:55,170 --> 03:33:55,930
Before I...

6186
03:33:55,930 --> 03:33:56,490
You know...

6187
03:33:56,490 --> 03:33:58,010
Can't do the internet stuff anymore.

6188
03:33:58,910 --> 03:33:59,290
So...

6189
03:34:00,230 --> 03:34:00,610
Obviously...

6190
03:34:01,990 --> 03:34:02,370
Um...

6191
03:34:02,370 --> 03:34:03,470
I want to be able to...

6192
03:34:03,470 --> 03:34:04,810
Reinvest all this...

6193
03:34:04,810 --> 03:34:05,950
To experience all the things...

6194
03:34:05,950 --> 03:34:06,590
I never got...

6195
03:34:06,590 --> 03:34:07,950
I would never be able to experience...

6196
03:34:07,950 --> 03:34:08,530
If it was like...

6197
03:34:08,530 --> 03:34:09,470
20 or 30 years...

6198
03:34:09,470 --> 03:34:10,250
In the line...

6199
03:34:10,250 --> 03:34:11,550
I would never be able to experience this.

6200
03:34:11,690 --> 03:34:12,410
So I want to...

6201
03:34:12,410 --> 03:34:13,910
Reinvest this in my channel.

6202
03:34:14,170 --> 03:34:15,450
To be able to do all these things...

6203
03:34:15,450 --> 03:34:16,530
That I've never got to do before.

6204
03:34:17,590 --> 03:34:17,970
Um...

6205
03:34:17,970 --> 03:34:18,610
And...

6206
03:34:18,610 --> 03:34:19,110
Because like...

6207
03:34:19,110 --> 03:34:19,950
I have a friend that keeps...

6208
03:34:19,950 --> 03:34:20,990
Fucking bugging me to...

6209
03:34:20,990 --> 03:34:21,830
Fucking buy a house.

6210
03:34:26,850 --> 03:34:28,430
One of my friends was like...

6211
03:34:28,430 --> 03:34:30,970
Please use that money to buy a house.

6212
03:34:31,490 --> 03:34:32,170
And I'm like...

6213
03:34:32,170 --> 03:34:32,490
No.

6214
03:34:33,570 --> 03:34:34,230
No.

6215
03:34:35,230 --> 03:34:40,170
I'm gonna pay an animator to make another Doki Bites animation.

6216
03:34:44,970 --> 03:34:45,630
So...

6217
03:34:47,430 --> 03:34:48,870
So that's my...

6218
03:34:50,130 --> 03:34:51,850
I know I should...

6219
03:34:54,950 --> 03:34:57,450
I know I should buy something.

6220
03:34:57,630 --> 03:34:58,610
Instead of renting.

6221
03:35:02,490 --> 03:35:02,930
Okay...

6222
03:35:04,570 --> 03:35:05,250
Oh yeah...

6223
03:35:05,250 --> 03:35:05,970
Thank you for the super chat.

6224
03:35:06,050 --> 03:35:06,450
Thank you thank you.

6225
03:35:06,450 --> 03:35:08,070
Which part of content creation do you struggle with?

6226
03:35:08,130 --> 03:35:09,610
How do you get past those roadblocks?

6227
03:35:10,190 --> 03:35:10,630
Interact.

6228
03:35:11,030 --> 03:35:13,530
Socialize with people outside of just streaming.

6229
03:35:13,970 --> 03:35:15,190
I'm so bad at that.

6230
03:35:15,270 --> 03:35:16,470
I'm really bad on like...

6231
03:35:16,470 --> 03:35:17,050
Twitter socialization.

6232
03:35:17,550 --> 03:35:19,090
And just socializing with people.

6233
03:35:19,230 --> 03:35:20,370
I like talking to people.

6234
03:35:20,790 --> 03:35:21,350
I like talking to people like...

6235
03:35:22,010 --> 03:35:22,410
um...

6236
03:35:24,390 --> 03:35:25,090
what do you say?

6237
03:35:25,250 --> 03:35:26,570
I like talking to people like...

6238
03:35:26,570 --> 03:35:27,390
in a call.

6239
03:35:27,850 --> 03:35:30,590
But I hate talking to people on...

6240
03:35:31,630 --> 03:35:32,430
messaging stuff.

6241
03:35:32,730 --> 03:35:33,350
I don't know.

6242
03:35:33,510 --> 03:35:34,790
Like I rather like...

6243
03:35:34,790 --> 03:35:36,670
I think this is why like whenever I get a call...

6244
03:35:36,670 --> 03:35:38,810
with somebody I haven't like messaged in a while...

6245
03:35:38,810 --> 03:35:40,050
we would talk for hours.

6246
03:35:40,210 --> 03:35:42,570
We would talk for like 4 plus hours.

6247
03:35:42,670 --> 03:35:45,270
I remember like I haven't talked to this one person in a while...

6248
03:35:45,270 --> 03:35:47,290
and then like when we got in a call...

6249
03:35:47,290 --> 03:35:49,230
we would just like play a video game...

6250
03:35:49,230 --> 03:35:50,550
and just talk for like...

6251
03:35:50,550 --> 03:35:52,830
4 plus hours and then we're like...

6252
03:35:52,830 --> 03:35:54,990
oh fuck wait we're both busy tomorrow...

6253
03:35:54,990 --> 03:35:55,830
we should go to sleep.

6254
03:35:56,210 --> 03:35:59,030
It would be like 4 or 5 am or something.

6255
03:35:59,190 --> 03:36:00,690
It would be like 5 am and we're like oh shit.

6256
03:36:00,850 --> 03:36:02,970
Oh my god wait oh fuck.

6257
03:36:03,090 --> 03:36:05,250
Okay we should sleep cause...

6258
03:36:05,250 --> 03:36:07,590
we both have a busy work day.

6259
03:36:08,030 --> 03:36:09,190
Like stuff like that.

6260
03:36:09,410 --> 03:36:11,670
Like I don't like just messaging.

6261
03:36:11,790 --> 03:36:13,110
I like to be in a call with somebody.

6262
03:36:13,290 --> 03:36:14,650
Cause that's the majority of how...

6263
03:36:14,650 --> 03:36:16,250
I like to interact with people.

6264
03:36:17,630 --> 03:36:18,110
Um...

6265
03:36:19,230 --> 03:36:20,090
I'm like a person that like...

6266
03:36:20,970 --> 03:36:21,870
socialize via message.

6267
03:36:22,150 --> 03:36:23,670
And that's like one of the hardest part.

6268
03:36:23,870 --> 03:36:24,870
Because that's how you network.

6269
03:36:25,210 --> 03:36:28,910
A lot of networking is done via socializing on messages.

6270
03:36:29,290 --> 03:36:30,370
But I've...

6271
03:36:31,030 --> 03:36:32,770
done more network...

6272
03:36:32,770 --> 03:36:34,990
I personally feel like I've...

6273
03:36:34,990 --> 03:36:36,950
made more progress networking...

6274
03:36:36,950 --> 03:36:39,310
just talking to people on like...

6275
03:36:39,310 --> 03:36:40,150
on the call.

6276
03:36:40,570 --> 03:36:41,090
Like...

6277
03:36:44,230 --> 03:36:44,790
Music!

6278
03:36:45,270 --> 03:36:47,370
And Bob thank you for the super chat.

6279
03:36:47,470 --> 03:36:48,110
Thank you thank you.

6280
03:36:49,230 --> 03:36:49,810
I'm gonna leave the house here.

6281
03:36:50,130 --> 03:36:50,890
House fun!

6282
03:36:51,430 --> 03:36:52,310
Thank you!

6283
03:36:53,790 --> 03:36:55,070
Next one thank you for the super chat.

6284
03:36:55,170 --> 03:36:55,790
Thank you thank you.

6285
03:36:56,110 --> 03:36:58,650
It would make me very happy to see...

6286
03:36:58,650 --> 03:37:01,290
your more financially secure log there.

6287
03:37:01,450 --> 03:37:02,730
Thank you for the super chat.

6288
03:37:02,970 --> 03:37:04,070
Thank you thank you.

6289
03:37:04,710 --> 03:37:06,630
Alright guys I'm gonna answer...

6290
03:37:07,470 --> 03:37:09,990
two more questions and then I'm gonna call it here.

6291
03:37:10,110 --> 03:37:10,370
Chat.

6292
03:37:11,630 --> 03:37:13,930
I'm gonna call it here.

6293
03:37:14,630 --> 03:37:17,350
I'll answer two more questions for you guys.

6294
03:37:17,570 --> 03:37:18,610
If you guys have any.

6295
03:37:19,270 --> 03:37:19,870
Oh.

6296
03:37:21,610 --> 03:37:22,210
Um.

6297
03:37:22,390 --> 03:37:24,310
Questions I haven't answered before.

6298
03:37:24,910 --> 03:37:25,210
Uh.

6299
03:37:26,090 --> 03:37:26,930
Let's see.

6300
03:37:27,330 --> 03:37:29,570
Let me see real quick if there's anything.

6301
03:37:30,930 --> 03:37:31,530
Uh.

6302
03:37:32,750 --> 03:37:34,270
Also if you're a content creator.

6303
03:37:34,870 --> 03:37:36,770
I know like it's...

6304
03:37:36,770 --> 03:37:38,570
a lot of people are like...

6305
03:37:38,570 --> 03:37:38,830
ew.

6306
03:37:39,150 --> 03:37:41,170
But like if you're a content creator...

6307
03:37:41,170 --> 03:37:42,270
get Twitter blue.

6308
03:37:43,370 --> 03:37:45,090
It's... you have to.

6309
03:37:47,630 --> 03:37:49,210
I know it's...

6310
03:37:49,230 --> 03:37:49,650
sucks.

6311
03:37:49,830 --> 03:37:50,750
But like...

6312
03:37:50,750 --> 03:37:52,730
as a content creator...

6313
03:37:52,950 --> 03:37:53,910
you have to.

6314
03:37:56,070 --> 03:37:56,790
It's...

6315
03:37:56,790 --> 03:37:59,210
actually like really good.

6316
03:37:59,690 --> 03:38:00,070
Uh.

6317
03:38:00,490 --> 03:38:01,950
Ha ha ha ha ha.

6318
03:38:03,290 --> 03:38:04,510
Ha ha ha.

6319
03:38:06,490 --> 03:38:07,210
Um.

6320
03:38:08,830 --> 03:38:10,210
Because like...

6321
03:38:10,210 --> 03:38:11,170
first off...

6322
03:38:11,170 --> 03:38:12,030
the... what is it?

6323
03:38:12,130 --> 03:38:14,670
Editing your post and being able to tweet...

6324
03:38:14,670 --> 03:38:16,730
really long tweets is really good.

6325
03:38:16,730 --> 03:38:17,410
It's just...

6326
03:38:17,410 --> 03:38:20,650
it sucks that that is like a bot...

6327
03:38:20,650 --> 03:38:20,990
service.

6328
03:38:21,470 --> 03:38:22,510
But like it's...

6329
03:38:22,510 --> 03:38:24,590
being able to make long tweets...

6330
03:38:24,590 --> 03:38:26,890
and being able to post longer videos...

6331
03:38:26,890 --> 03:38:28,710
as well as editing your tweets is just...

6332
03:38:28,710 --> 03:38:30,290
a really really helpful thing to have.

6333
03:38:30,530 --> 03:38:32,690
And I know it sucks...

6334
03:38:32,690 --> 03:38:35,150
but like it's a good investment in the long run.

6335
03:38:35,370 --> 03:38:36,370
Ha ha ha ha.

6336
03:38:36,410 --> 03:38:37,690
As a content creator.

6337
03:38:39,070 --> 03:38:39,590
Um.

6338
03:38:43,770 --> 03:38:44,290
Grace!

6339
03:38:44,490 --> 03:38:45,330
Thank you for the super chat.

6340
03:38:45,410 --> 03:38:45,630
Thank you.

6341
03:38:46,730 --> 03:38:48,790
This will be my last question that I'll answer.

6342
03:38:49,030 --> 03:38:50,590
Thank you so much for the stream.

6343
03:38:50,710 --> 03:38:51,930
It's been incredibly educational.

6344
03:38:52,430 --> 03:38:54,550
How do you balance doing things out of passion...

6345
03:38:54,550 --> 03:38:56,630
versus because they are what's good...

6346
03:38:56,630 --> 03:38:57,470
for your growth?

6347
03:38:58,370 --> 03:38:58,890
Um.

6348
03:39:03,820 --> 03:39:05,480
You have to sacrifice...

6349
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:07,300
things to grow.

6350
03:39:07,780 --> 03:39:09,580
Like you have to be able...

6351
03:39:09,580 --> 03:39:11,700
to uh... be able to sacrifice.

6352
03:39:12,080 --> 03:39:13,600
Of course you can still...

6353
03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:15,660
sprinkle... there's 7 days in a week.

6354
03:39:15,760 --> 03:39:15,980
Right?

6355
03:39:16,080 --> 03:39:17,600
You can do something you're passionate about...

6356
03:39:17,600 --> 03:39:19,440
in like half the week and it's something...

6357
03:39:19,540 --> 03:39:20,720
you know it's what I do.

6358
03:39:20,880 --> 03:39:23,020
I have a FOMO game.

6359
03:39:24,120 --> 03:39:25,840
Like once a week at least.

6360
03:39:26,040 --> 03:39:27,020
Or at most.

6361
03:39:27,140 --> 03:39:29,440
Once a week there is a FOMO game...

6362
03:39:29,440 --> 03:39:31,520
in the schedule like climbing or something.

6363
03:39:31,840 --> 03:39:33,440
Or like supermarket simulator.

6364
03:39:33,900 --> 03:39:35,880
Cause that is the game of the week!

6365
03:39:36,580 --> 03:39:36,960
Um.

6366
03:39:37,280 --> 03:39:37,940
It's fun.

6367
03:39:38,200 --> 03:39:39,000
It's fun.

6368
03:39:39,340 --> 03:39:41,080
But like obviously...

6369
03:39:41,080 --> 03:39:42,200
like how...

6370
03:39:43,660 --> 03:39:45,440
Some of them is like...

6371
03:39:45,440 --> 03:39:46,840
purposely rage games.

6372
03:39:46,840 --> 03:39:48,580
You know like the fucking...

6373
03:39:48,580 --> 03:39:49,260
climbing game!

6374
03:39:49,700 --> 03:39:51,200
It's fun for the viewers!

6375
03:39:52,500 --> 03:39:55,200
And it's fun to watch the streamers...

6376
03:39:55,200 --> 03:39:55,480
suffer.

6377
03:39:56,020 --> 03:39:57,840
So it's like you know...

6378
03:39:57,840 --> 03:39:59,920
sacrifices have to be made.

6379
03:40:00,960 --> 03:40:02,900
It's more so of like...

6380
03:40:02,900 --> 03:40:04,720
You have 7 days of a week.

6381
03:40:05,060 --> 03:40:07,220
You need to obviously balance...

6382
03:40:07,220 --> 03:40:09,100
the stuff you're passionate about...

6383
03:40:09,100 --> 03:40:10,960
versus the stuff that you want to grow with.

6384
03:40:11,240 --> 03:40:13,000
And you have to be able to...

6385
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:14,980
sacrifice that to grow in whatever...

6386
03:40:15,840 --> 03:40:16,440
um...

6387
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:17,860
way you want.

6388
03:40:18,200 --> 03:40:20,120
And uh...

6389
03:40:20,120 --> 03:40:22,380
And that's like the risk you have to take!

6390
03:40:22,600 --> 03:40:24,960
There's so many risks you have to take in content creation.

6391
03:40:25,660 --> 03:40:26,640
Streaming is a risk.

6392
03:40:26,840 --> 03:40:28,960
And you have to be ready to take these risks.

6393
03:40:29,500 --> 03:40:30,360
Uh but yes!

6394
03:40:30,540 --> 03:40:32,400
That would be my last question of the day!

6395
03:40:32,660 --> 03:40:34,900
I hope this stream...

6396
03:40:34,900 --> 03:40:35,900
was informative.

6397
03:40:36,720 --> 03:40:38,760
Um and that you were able to...

6398
03:40:38,760 --> 03:40:40,140
learn a little bit.

6399
03:40:40,580 --> 03:40:43,120
And that other VTubers...

6400
03:40:43,120 --> 03:40:44,880
are able to you know...

6401
03:40:44,880 --> 03:40:46,600
figure out what they want to do.

6402
03:40:46,840 --> 03:40:48,940
With what they want to stream.

6403
03:40:49,440 --> 03:40:50,600
And stuff like that.

6404
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:51,920
I hope...

6405
03:40:51,920 --> 03:40:54,880
This might be like my only time I actually talk in depth...

6406
03:40:54,880 --> 03:40:55,840
about all of this.

6407
03:40:56,200 --> 03:40:58,300
So I hope it was informative.

6408
03:40:58,700 --> 03:41:00,460
There's obviously a lot of things I could have said.

6409
03:41:00,640 --> 03:41:02,860
There's obviously a lot more things I could have...

6410
03:41:02,860 --> 03:41:03,700
given insight on.

6411
03:41:04,180 --> 03:41:06,700
Um but I hope that...

6412
03:41:06,700 --> 03:41:08,560
what I gave you guys...

6413
03:41:08,560 --> 03:41:09,860
was enough...

6414
03:41:09,860 --> 03:41:13,280
to help you in some way.

6415
03:41:13,840 --> 03:41:14,360
And...

6416
03:41:14,360 --> 03:41:16,600
I hope you guys learned...

6417
03:41:16,840 --> 03:41:18,320
a lot about content creation.

6418
03:41:19,440 --> 03:41:20,000
Um...

6419
03:41:20,800 --> 03:41:22,140
The other thing I want to say...

6420
03:41:22,140 --> 03:41:24,540
is that you always want to keep eyes on you.

6421
03:41:24,840 --> 03:41:26,920
The reason why I was able to grow...

6422
03:41:28,640 --> 03:41:29,200
fast...

6423
03:41:29,200 --> 03:41:31,180
and big...

6424
03:41:31,180 --> 03:41:32,720
Um before you know...

6425
03:41:32,720 --> 03:41:33,460
as Doki...

6426
03:41:33,460 --> 03:41:36,860
was because I did things that I...

6427
03:41:36,860 --> 03:41:38,440
I was super passionate about.

6428
03:41:38,720 --> 03:41:40,220
And I love streaming.

6429
03:41:40,460 --> 03:41:41,200
And I loved...

6430
03:41:41,200 --> 03:41:43,860
I loved being involved in the community.

6431
03:41:43,860 --> 03:41:45,900
And I loved being involved outside of just...

6432
03:41:45,900 --> 03:41:46,280
Vtubing.

6433
03:41:47,400 --> 03:41:49,620
I tried to network...

6434
03:41:49,620 --> 03:41:51,160
outside beyond Vtubing.

6435
03:41:51,420 --> 03:41:52,920
And that's...

6436
03:41:52,920 --> 03:41:54,880
And I tried to do a lot of things.

6437
03:41:55,080 --> 03:41:57,200
I wanted to be involved in as many things as possible.

6438
03:41:57,660 --> 03:41:59,240
And that is like...

6439
03:41:59,240 --> 03:42:01,000
one of the biggest things with growing.

6440
03:42:01,340 --> 03:42:02,640
Is that you want to be...

6441
03:42:03,380 --> 03:42:04,820
You want to be like everywhere.

6442
03:42:05,020 --> 03:42:05,860
Type deal.

6443
03:42:06,440 --> 03:42:09,320
You want to be like everywhere so people will know...

6444
03:42:09,320 --> 03:42:10,160
recognize you.

6445
03:42:10,160 --> 03:42:11,300
And...

6446
03:42:11,920 --> 03:42:14,240
I also organized a lot of...

6447
03:42:14,240 --> 03:42:15,140
events and projects.

6448
03:42:15,520 --> 03:42:18,180
And that kept the momentum going.

6449
03:42:18,540 --> 03:42:19,360
And stuff.

6450
03:42:19,500 --> 03:42:21,960
I was willing to reinvest in my channel.

6451
03:42:22,780 --> 03:42:24,160
If you're willing to...

6452
03:42:24,160 --> 03:42:25,520
reinvest in your channel...

6453
03:42:25,520 --> 03:42:27,600
and know what your strongest suit are...

6454
03:42:28,160 --> 03:42:30,220
That is the best way...

6455
03:42:30,220 --> 03:42:31,560
to grow in my opinion.

6456
03:42:32,540 --> 03:42:33,140
Um...

6457
03:42:34,260 --> 03:42:36,020
And I knew how the algorithm...

6458
03:42:36,020 --> 03:42:36,540
worked.

6459
03:42:37,360 --> 03:42:39,880
I knew what would grow a channel.

6460
03:42:40,160 --> 03:42:41,540
And I knew what...

6461
03:42:41,540 --> 03:42:43,700
would benefit the algorithm.

6462
03:42:44,420 --> 03:42:45,960
And it's all about...

6463
03:42:45,960 --> 03:42:47,900
as long... the moment you realize...

6464
03:42:47,900 --> 03:42:50,280
what makes the algorithm works...

6465
03:42:50,280 --> 03:42:51,740
is when you realize...

6466
03:42:51,740 --> 03:42:53,220
how you can get bigger.

6467
03:42:53,360 --> 03:42:55,620
If you hit that boost...

6468
03:42:55,620 --> 03:42:56,720
initial boost...

6469
03:42:56,720 --> 03:42:59,680
that's when you know what can keep you going.

6470
03:43:00,760 --> 03:43:01,400
Um...

6471
03:43:02,400 --> 03:43:03,500
Um... but yeah.

6472
03:43:03,660 --> 03:43:05,120
Think long term.

6473
03:43:05,380 --> 03:43:07,380
It's not about short term.

6474
03:43:07,800 --> 03:43:09,940
It's all about long term.

6475
03:43:10,160 --> 03:43:12,160
Because like planning some of these things...

6476
03:43:12,160 --> 03:43:13,460
might take...

6477
03:43:13,460 --> 03:43:14,960
a long time.

6478
03:43:16,320 --> 03:43:18,160
But the long term effects...

6479
03:43:18,980 --> 03:43:20,100
is like...

6480
03:43:20,100 --> 03:43:21,060
so beneficial.

6481
03:43:21,740 --> 03:43:24,280
Cause sometimes my projects take a long time to plan.

6482
03:43:24,780 --> 03:43:26,180
But I know...

6483
03:43:26,180 --> 03:43:27,820
the moment...

6484
03:43:27,820 --> 03:43:30,280
I would upload it or the moment I do it...

6485
03:43:30,280 --> 03:43:31,840
I know people are gonna like it.

6486
03:43:32,020 --> 03:43:33,340
Because I put...

6487
03:43:33,340 --> 03:43:36,260
It's like you know when AAA companies...

6488
03:43:36,260 --> 03:43:37,740
rush a game for Christmas...

6489
03:43:37,740 --> 03:43:39,000
and you can tell it's rushed.

6490
03:43:40,660 --> 03:43:41,860
And like...

6491
03:43:41,860 --> 03:43:44,140
Oh you didn't put their real...

6492
03:43:44,140 --> 03:43:45,280
heart and soul into it.

6493
03:43:45,440 --> 03:43:47,940
Versus a game that took years to develop.

6494
03:43:48,320 --> 03:43:50,220
And like they clearly put a lot of...

6495
03:43:50,220 --> 03:43:51,960
investment into it and stuff like that.

6496
03:43:52,180 --> 03:43:54,220
Like that's the best comparison I can make.

6497
03:43:54,380 --> 03:43:55,260
Regarding this.

6498
03:43:56,140 --> 03:43:58,000
Don't be afraid to invest...

6499
03:43:58,000 --> 03:43:59,940
long term versus short term.

6500
03:44:00,320 --> 03:44:02,180
Because um...

6501
03:44:03,300 --> 03:44:04,140
If you...

6502
03:44:04,140 --> 03:44:06,120
believe in something enough...

6503
03:44:06,840 --> 03:44:08,020
Then like...

6504
03:44:08,020 --> 03:44:10,060
And like you know logically that this...

6505
03:44:10,160 --> 03:44:12,100
when you announce it or like when you...

6506
03:44:12,100 --> 03:44:13,440
actually put it out...

6507
03:44:13,960 --> 03:44:15,400
Like you know it's gonna work.

6508
03:44:15,680 --> 03:44:17,800
You know that this is what viewers want.

6509
03:44:18,080 --> 03:44:20,580
So like don't be afraid to reinvest...

6510
03:44:20,580 --> 03:44:22,340
for long term type deal.

6511
03:44:23,180 --> 03:44:23,740
Umm...

6512
03:44:23,740 --> 03:44:25,900
And that's like really how I felt like...

6513
03:44:25,900 --> 03:44:28,340
helped me a lot to grow...

6514
03:44:28,340 --> 03:44:29,640
the way I did...

6515
03:44:29,640 --> 03:44:31,960
before I came back as an indie.

6516
03:44:33,200 --> 03:44:33,760
Umm...

6517
03:44:33,760 --> 03:44:36,320
And uh...

6518
03:44:37,020 --> 03:44:37,580
Don't...

6519
03:44:37,580 --> 03:44:38,480
So being creative.

6520
03:44:38,580 --> 03:44:39,460
I know where I am.

6521
03:44:39,480 --> 03:44:39,920
I'm a producer.

6522
03:44:40,380 --> 03:44:42,980
My role is majority as a producer.

6523
03:44:43,300 --> 03:44:44,420
I have lots of ideas.

6524
03:44:44,740 --> 03:44:47,660
And I help and I provide like these ideas...

6525
03:44:47,660 --> 03:44:48,820
for people to make it into reality.

6526
03:44:49,160 --> 03:44:51,740
There's some people who are gifted in actually like...

6527
03:44:51,740 --> 03:44:52,560
creating it themselves.

6528
03:44:53,080 --> 03:44:54,760
Know where your strong suits are.

6529
03:44:55,060 --> 03:44:57,200
I know I don't have a lot of skills creating...

6530
03:44:57,200 --> 03:44:58,260
stuff in general.

6531
03:44:58,540 --> 03:45:01,400
But I know that I have lots of ideas.

6532
03:45:01,760 --> 03:45:03,660
That I know how to make it a reality.

6533
03:45:04,140 --> 03:45:05,820
Uh know what I want to make...

6534
03:45:05,820 --> 03:45:06,280
in reality.

6535
03:45:07,580 --> 03:45:08,680
And I know how to organize stuff really well.

6536
03:45:08,800 --> 03:45:11,640
I can plan things and organize and bring people together.

6537
03:45:12,680 --> 03:45:13,120
Umm...

6538
03:45:13,920 --> 03:45:14,360
Obviously...

6539
03:45:15,360 --> 03:45:16,760
Know where your strong suits are.

6540
03:45:17,040 --> 03:45:19,080
When you're really creative, creative streams...

6541
03:45:19,080 --> 03:45:20,820
You can make creative streams as a niche.

6542
03:45:21,080 --> 03:45:22,900
There's a lot of very creative streamers.

6543
03:45:23,400 --> 03:45:24,640
And there's a lot of like...

6544
03:45:24,640 --> 03:45:27,400
There's like one stream... one twitter account that I follow.

6545
03:45:28,100 --> 03:45:29,460
I can't bring up the name...

6546
03:45:29,460 --> 03:45:30,480
on the top of my head right now.

6547
03:45:30,780 --> 03:45:33,080
But they also... they always like retweet...

6548
03:45:33,080 --> 03:45:35,300
a lot of like very very creative streamers.

6549
03:45:35,780 --> 03:45:37,460
That do their... make their own...

6550
03:45:37,580 --> 03:45:38,140
like content.

6551
03:45:38,240 --> 03:45:39,640
They make their... create their own things.

6552
03:45:39,700 --> 03:45:40,580
Like create their own...

6553
03:45:41,560 --> 03:45:42,420
What is it called?

6554
03:45:42,500 --> 03:45:43,400
Create their own like...

6555
03:45:43,400 --> 03:45:45,680
Twitch interactions and...

6556
03:45:45,680 --> 03:45:46,820
uh like...

6557
03:45:46,820 --> 03:45:48,200
their own way of streaming.

6558
03:45:48,500 --> 03:45:49,460
