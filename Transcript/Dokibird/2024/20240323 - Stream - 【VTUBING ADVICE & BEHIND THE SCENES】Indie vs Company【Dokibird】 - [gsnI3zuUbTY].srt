00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,530
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,650
Hello, hello, hello.

3
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,870
Oh gosh, okay.

4
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,910
So, welcome, welcome class.

5
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:10,270
Welcome class to VTubing 101 by Professor Doki.

6
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:19,010
I just need to let you guys know that I need, before I
start, um, a big disclaimer for all of you, but this is all

7
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:27,990
my own opinion so like obviously to each person it is
different how this is done i am a very unique circumstance

8
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,830
in terms of like what the fuck happened to me so

9
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:45,410
so i just need you guys to know this is like all my own
opinion in terms of like content creation and like vtubing

10
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:54,870
and stuff like that like all the tips and advice is from
what I feel is how to build an audience and how to nurture a

11
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,730
fan community.

12
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,470
I realized I just remembered I forgot that slide.

13
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,250
I forgot to make that slide regarding like how to nurture a
fan community.

14
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,610
I forgot to make it.

15
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,610
So I'll talk to you guys about that later.

16
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,210
I was like, I knew I forgot something.

17
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,730
I knew I forgot one thing to talk about regarding like a V2.

18
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:28,090
One of the most a fan community like a community um a
community that is like you know um how to nurture it and how

19
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:37,210
to like grow it in a way and making sure they like you know
they'll continue to watch you so so stuff like that i

20
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:46,950
realized i knew i forgot to make one important slide and um
that was one of them so um so i will talk about it i will

21
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,470
sadly there won't be a slide about it so i guess like if
you're looking back you're just gonna have to remember where

22
00:04:51,470 --> 00:05:00,130
i talked about it and stuff like that so like i said this is
all my own opinion um in regards to like all of this um it

23
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:06,710
will touch on about like content creation as well not just
like vtubing in general because like although vtubing is a

24
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:14,690
niche type deal it's like its own niche within the streaming
community um a lot of these like things i talk about can

25
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:21,030
also apply to general streaming like it doesn't have to you
don't have to be a vtuber you could just be like a flesh

26
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:29,330
tuber or like just a png tuber or whatever it all like it's
just just general advice on like algorithm and stuff like

27
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:41,010
that a lot of this is like very like um it's like very
what's the word it's very uh uh it might be like very simple

28
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:47,790
advice and it could be like things like oh i knew that
already or stuff like that but some people might not you

29
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:54,850
know some people might not know this this already this info
and stuff like that or like they might not be aware that

30
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,490
like oh wait that's the thing and stuff like that so there's
going to be some advice that to others might seem very

31
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:07,610
simple but might help it might help others and then there
might be some advice that you might not know also um so i'll

32
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,690
try to touch as much as i can there will be like i will take
questions uh but of course i will pick and choose what

33
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:20,470
questions I would like to answer um at the end and from chat
and then I will take some questions I will also be looking

34
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,710
reading through the Twitter thread that I've made regarding
like people on Twitter that have asked me like questions

35
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:34,030
regarding um regarding like uh like what they want to know
more about like what my process is and stuff like that so I

36
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,910
will be looking at Twitter as well as chat later on to
answer some of the questions people have because like

37
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,070
there's somewhere people were asking me how do you do a
project how do you start a project What do you do?

38
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:51,050
Well, like, this is like, I didn't make a slide for stuff
like this because like when doing projects, it's not really

39
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,810
that complicated of a process in general unless you get
sponsors involved.

40
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,650
Like the moment you get sponsors involved or like you have
something else that's funding it for you, it doesn't, it's

41
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,570
not that complicated.

42
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,990
It's as complicated as you want to make it to be.

43
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,790
So I didn't make a slide about that because I felt like it
really is like your own work process regarding projects.

44
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,290
stuff like that.

45
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:20,230
So like, of course, if you have a sponsor involved, if you
have someone else involved, obviously what they want to do

46
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:26,870
with your project matters a lot, because they have a say,
since they're funding it, they have a say on how this

47
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,190
project is going to go.

48
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,290
So or you can fund it yourself, which is basically if you
fund it yourself, you get 100% on where your creativity is

49
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:35,950
going towards.

50
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:42,650
It's like how a lot of like passion projects are usually
funded by themselves, because they don't want like a higher

51
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,750
upper person to like dictate what it's going to be like.

52
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,830
And only you just want to do what you want to do.

53
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,570
So it's basically like if you want funding, yeah, you don't
have to pay for yourself.

54
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,790
But a lot of the creative control is out of your hands.

55
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,330
So like it's like very restricted, but if you funded
yourself, obviously you have the majority of creative

56
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,910
control on how things are going.

57
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,570
So that's why I didn't make a slide because it's like it
really heavily depends.

58
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:17,270
on like how you want to do your project so um i can give you
how to organize your product like in terms of like how i

59
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:24,490
organize my projects regarding what the discord servers will
look like i can give you guys an insight on like how i

60
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:31,850
separate a discord server and stuff like that so there will
be like pictures and everything don't worry this stream will

61
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:44,870
be uh it's it's archived this so do not worry this stream is
archived so you guys can rewatch it whenever you want

62
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:52,110
regarding stuff like this um and i said before i will not be
going over anything that will break any aims or um anything

63
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,650
that is like very private information i will not be going
through any of that um i will mostly be going through like

64
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:05,450
um i guess general knowledge that's already been out like
companies versus indies.

65
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,650
Should you join a company or should you be an indie?

66
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,450
I'll be talking about like pros and cons.

67
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,690
But all this information is a general knowledge.

68
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,950
It is out in public.

69
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,310
So like, and it's not like NDA, it doesn't break any NDAs.

70
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,430
A lot of this information is out in public, but it's more so
I give like a highlighter on like separating what are the

71
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:30,070
benefits between why people want to join a company and why
people want to join, want to continue being an indie.

72
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,890
There are pros and cons for each.

73
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:43,430
and indie you'll see why people will go for either um and um
there are bit uh there are benefits for each one so the

74
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:52,070
first off i'm going to also i realized there's no bgm but i
just i was trying to find a good bgm but i don't know i

75
00:09:52,070 --> 00:10:05,650
don't know what to use as a bgm like i mean i do have this a
classic i could do that you know what i'll have this be my

76
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:21,770
bgm all right this is gonna be my bgm anyway so um uh we
were gonna go with the first slide uh we're gonna go with a

77
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:34,090
classic so um the first slide the biggest factor before i go
into any of this the biggest factor regarding how to make it

78
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:45,070
as a content creator and like as a vtuber is luck and
networking and like i'm not going to deny that luck pays a

79
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:51,890
huge factor if you watch any like video i've got regarding
like how do i become a content creator how do i be a big

80
00:10:51,890 --> 00:11:01,590
famous streamer how do i become famous everybody will tell
you that luck is one of the biggest when it comes to

81
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:10,930
streaming to make it as a streamer it's your biggest your
big break basically um but even when you have your big break

82
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:20,390
you must be able to utilize it to keep the momentum so like
you can't you can't just like have something you got your

83
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:29,570
biggest break ever but then you don't utilize anything
regarding it you just coast after that that kills all your

84
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:42,030
momentum like I think that's like really like that is like
very for some people that is incredibly obvious but there's

85
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:49,970
so many times when someone will have their big break and
then they do nothing with it they just coast they'll just

86
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:57,690
keep on streaming as if it's normal the thing is when you
get your biggest break ever you have to like keep up the

87
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:06,790
momentum and a lot of eyes are on you at that point you
gotta grind you can't just take a break right after you get

88
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,030
your like biggest opportunity because sometimes when they
get their big break they'll be like i'm not gonna stream

89
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:19,850
after uh i'm not gonna stream after like two to three days
that your momentum's gone you gotta milk it

90
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:34,130
It's like it seems so like simple, but it's something that a
lot of people don't realize you can't you know You're like

91
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,290
oh, you have to take a break.

92
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:46,230
You have to rest But when you have the biggest opportunity
of your life You can't rest until you're stable But the the

93
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:55,150
huge thing is that streaming isn't stable Content creation
isn't stable but you have but when you have this opportunity

94
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:06,890
you have to keep going until you feel like you're safe that
you won't lose this anymore like and like that is why I'm

95
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:16,270
like I was a huge workaholic when I started out and I still
am because I do really enjoy streaming um as when you feel

96
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:25,610
like you're at a safe position that's when you can relax Um,
because when you lose this, the luck to your opportunity,

97
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,190
when will you get it again type deal?

98
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,310
You have to go in thinking that you only have one huge
opportunity.

99
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:43,890
And you have to go in with milking that huge opportunity for
as long as you can until you realize you're in a safe and

100
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,110
stable position to relax.

101
00:13:47,730 --> 00:14:00,070
but a huge huge uh like negative side to this is that some
streamers don't know when they are in a safe position that

102
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:08,530
is like the hardest part and that's why a lot of streamers
and a lot of content creators don't know when to take a

103
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:17,590
break because they don't know when they are stable and
that's why you see a lot of burnout and a lot of like

104
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:26,910
streamers burning out or like just not being able to keep
going because they don't know exactly when this when the

105
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:36,390
right moment is to relax and that is a huge problem because
streaming is also very new it's not a very long career we

106
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:47,450
don't know the effects of streaming as a long career right
now we are seeing youtubers finally like quitting after like

107
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:58,770
what 20 plus years on youtube um we're now seeing like big
youtubers finally deciding to retire but those are youtubers

108
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:06,930
we have yet to see the outcome of streamers at best a lot of
the big streamers a lot of the famous streamers are still

109
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:16,770
going so like we're seeing big youtubers finally retiring
but we haven't seen big streamers finally taking a break or

110
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:23,270
fine not taking a break but finally retiring so at this
point we don't know what's happened we don't know the career

111
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,950
of streaming in general uh

112
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:36,250
germa kind of retired but germa is still sort of he's still
like sort of going ongoing type deal he's not really like

113
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:44,930
retired retired he's like semi retired but even then we're
not he's like one of the biggest out there like he is

114
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:52,410
literally okay you can say like making it and streaming is
one percent germa is like the zero point zero zero one

115
00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:05,950
percent because he has become a meme so because of that he
has like transcended to like meme status forever type deal

116
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:17,450
it's it's forever type deal um and because of that like he
it's a different story regarding like regular shimmers um

117
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:25,050
and so there's there's lots of things like this to worry
about like you have to know when you can relax and when you

118
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:32,190
can take a break and i feel like when you have your biggest
opportunities you i personally think like you keep going

119
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:41,490
until like you can to see that, uh, that your growth has
stabilized type deal.

120
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:48,350
Like, it has stabilized to a number that you think is going
to be your average for a while, and that even you take a

121
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,610
break, like maybe like one to two weeks break.

122
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,750
I know like some people are like a month break or something.

123
00:16:53,090 --> 00:17:01,670
I personally think, this is my opinion, but I personally
think one to two weeks is like the optimal length you can

124
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,610
take as a, for a break in V2.

125
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,210
and content creation.

126
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:16,510
Well, content creation is another hand, but I think in
V-tubing, one to two weeks is the optimal spot.

127
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,710
If you're in a company, you might be able to take a longer
break.

128
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:29,450
But if you're an indie, one to two weeks is the optimal spot
for a break, because you're not going long enough that it

129
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:38,670
will affect your algorithm, and you're not going long enough
that, like, uh that like people have you know watched other

130
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:45,790
streamers and stuff like that um one in two weeks is like
the safe zone anything more than that it's a little bit of

131
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:55,610
like a gamble it's like how it's more so of like how much
have you like nurtured your fan base to be able to uh to be

132
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:04,190
able to like take longer breaks um this is as i said this is
all my own opinion um if you're on twitch you don't

133
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:13,630
algorithm that much uh but like if you're on youtube
algorithm is like very very important um because it affects

134
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:24,070
on how much your content is being pushed outside of the
regular sphere uh so it really uh why is it not to work be

135
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:31,430
worried on twitch is because there's no the you the twitch
algorithm is different from the youtube algorithm the twitch

136
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:39,110
algorithm is mostly just We've got the like, oh, streamers
you want to watch, you might recommend and stuff like that.

137
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:46,190
But Twitch growth is mostly relied on raids, which I will
talk about in another slide.

138
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,550
Raids and VTuber collabs or collaborations in general really
help benefits Twitch growth.

139
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:03,030
While on YouTube, YouTube growth really benefits on the
algorithm and what you upload and what you're streaming and

140
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,950
types like that.

141
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:12,850
hard carry twitch twitch content creators because you're
like funneling viewers into like other other people it's

142
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:22,490
very easy to funnel viewers to other people youtube is more
so of regarding uploads like shorts videos and like um how

143
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:29,270
much you're growing and your consistency the moment you're
you're coasting on youtube the less youtube will push you

144
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:39,890
out to other new viewers and i have algorithm and uh matrix
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i love

145
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:46,050
gambling ah so you're you're a super chat reader gambler
will dokey read my slide

146
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:58,590
anyway another thing i want to talk about is networking um
your growth heavily relies on networking and who you reach

147
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:09,850
out to and who you're working with who you're socializing
with um Like, it relies heavily on your social skills and

148
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:17,150
how open you are to reaching out to people type deal.

149
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,650
It doesn't have to be, like, friendships and stuff.

150
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,290
It could be just like a, like, it doesn't have to be
friendship.

151
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,410
Like, you don't have to be friends with everybody.

152
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:34,210
It can be just like a casual, like, relationship between,
like, business partners and stuff like that.

153
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:42,850
It doesn't have to be, it can just be like a coworker or
something, and it doesn't have to be a friendship.

154
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:50,450
It can be a colleague, yeah, it could be a colleague, and,
like, just someone, like, mutual, mutual, like, collab

155
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,070
partners.

156
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,850
So it doesn't, you don't have to force yourself to be
friends with everybody, especially if you're, like, an

157
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,770
introvert like me.

158
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:07,770
I don't have to force myself to be friends with like
everybody I meet um type deal uh I don't I meet people but I

159
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:14,430
don't have to be like force friendships on people because it
has to be mutual it has to be a mutual friendship and like

160
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:26,350
there's like mutual um like you can you feel like you groove
with somebody also like some their stream personalities is

161
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:36,230
not the same as how I portray myself on stream I'm like
super energetic I'm like I'm like chaotic and stuff like

162
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:46,270
that um but I'm also an introvert so like uh on stream it's
very easy for me to be like that because like I very much

163
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:55,370
enjoy streaming and um and I very much enjoy streaming and I
very like I love like making content and stuff like that but

164
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,270
like off stream I am very like Chill.

165
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:13,650
I'm, I'm like, super, I'm, like, chill, and I'm, like, low
energy, because I put all my energy into, on, onto stream

166
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,550
type deal.

167
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,710
Like, I put a lot of my energies on stream, and, like, you
know, my battery is low off stream.

168
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:28,450
So, my off stream is, like, very different, because I, most
of my energy, and most of my battery is on stream.

169
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:36,750
um so like i said like on stream maybe you like grew with
somebody's on stream personality like the on stream

170
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:45,230
chemistry is uh is like really really good but me off stream
you're just casual acquaintances and stuff like that so like

171
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:52,490
i said you don't have to be friends with everybody but it's
really good to like know people at least like you know know

172
00:22:52,490 --> 00:23:01,510
some people for example like twitch rivals um when i got
invited to when i first got invited twitch rivals i talked

173
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:10,530
with um i talked with like the head one of the head people
who organizes twitch rivals um i had talked with them i like

174
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,130
uh gave them like ideas and my opinions on stuff and i told
them like oh i really enjoyed twitch rivals it was really

175
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:23,350
really fun um if you um if possible um can i uh is it
possibly invited in future twitch rivals because i really

176
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,630
enjoyed doing them and i was acting i could have just like
done twitch rivals and not cared about it after that but

177
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:36,390
instead i personally reached out to the head of the twitch
rivals organizer and told them how much i enjoy doing them

178
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:45,410
how much like um how much uh my my fans enjoying me doing
them and how i would love to participate more in the future

179
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:53,330
and that is how i got my connections with twitch uh is
because i took the extra step to interact with the pet

180
00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:01,230
people who are organizing these events and uh and then just
be like i really enjoyed it and like um if possible can i be

181
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:10,070
invited to uh to future twitch rivals and that's really it
that's how i basically got like invites consistently to like

182
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:19,990
these events uh and just you have fun on them i do it shows
in my streams and it shows when i reached out directly to

183
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:27,310
the p organizers and like uh and that's also like it doesn't
matter it is not this applies to every like everything like

184
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:38,610
events and like events and all this other stuff if you ask
directly uh the worst you can say is no like or ghost you

185
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,030
and you already you took your shot

186
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,230
Like, you took your shot, and that's all that matters.

187
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,670
And it's all about, like, taking your shot.

188
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:59,690
You have to get onto these opportunities and be able to
interact with people and, like, openly ask about, like,

189
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,550
whether or not it's possible to do these things.

190
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:08,110
Like, and, I mean, if they ghost you, then you're, like,
fine, you move on.

191
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:15,350
You have to be able to accept rejection and getting ghosted
because that is the way of being a streamer and content

192
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:23,830
creator it's gonna fucking hurt but like I got ghosted uh
and rejected for things like and I'm okay I'm not fine but

193
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:39,870
but you have to accept it like that's the thing you need to
accept rejection also friend thank you for the akasupa thank

194
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:46,670
you thank you sorry professor almost forgot to pay for class
oh yeah oh yeah sorry for your girls you don't know the

195
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:57,270
tuition the class tuition anyway like i said that is one of
the biggest factors on like making it as a content creator

196
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:08,570
um but yes like i said luck is why a lot of people want to
join a company because it already making it into a company

197
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:18,170
is the luck part and it already comes with an established
and after that even when you make it to the company it's

198
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:27,890
your job to keep those eyes on you and continue building it
because it's not like you can coast after that it's like you

199
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:37,930
have to keep going after that or you're just gonna stagnate
so which is why my next slide will be going over indie

200
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:46,650
versus company so I'll be going over company first and a lot
of this is uh sort of like public knowledge so like i'm not

201
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:52,010
i'm not like going to be going to any details regarding like
anything that could break nta and stuff like that but a lot

202
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:59,450
of this information is like public knowledge that i'm pretty
sure um like it doesn't matter if it's like a small company

203
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:08,990
or a big company it generally is like it's very like to the
point regarding like situations and stuff like this so uh so

204
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:17,950
like So obviously I'll be going over like why should you
join a company and About how and also like things to be

205
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:26,410
aware of and like I said you get an instant audience
audience base So the audience of the company and of the

206
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:35,490
vTubers That debut before you will be there for your debut
Obviously because a lot of you might not be the first person

207
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:44,870
there You know you might you might it might not if it's not
a new company that you're starting uh there is already the

208
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:57,870
branding involved so you're going in with uh you're going in
with like an established audience uh and because of that

209
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:06,910
that's why a lot of people want to join um if you're nobody
if you came with zero viewers then of course like having

210
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:15,530
suddenly on your debut like i don't know 20 plus viewers if
you come from zero 20 plus 100 200 a thousand that's a lot

211
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:23,510
from what you were used to um it draws a lot of attention
and it's your job to make a good debut so you can keep the

212
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:32,570
attention of those people uh that watched you they don't
know anything about you but they're all here to be there to

213
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:43,350
watch you they know zero things zero things your skin suit
is and like what your personality is like on twitter and

214
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:50,630
that's it that's all the information they have of you but
even so you're going in there with an established audience

215
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:59,690
base that are fans of the company or the vtubers that came
before you and um and they're here to watch you so you have

216
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:09,790
all this exposure right off the bat you could be a hidden
gem out there as an indie for a company and it's up to the

217
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:18,990
company to reveal why you're a hidden gem and uh because
there's so many really good indies out there that never had

218
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:28,070
their big break but it's only because of joining a company
they receive their big break and that is why a lot of people

219
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:38,950
take that chance another reason why is because you get a
group of people to collaborate with instantly and And this

220
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:46,830
is one of the things that I've learned as an indie, how it's
very difficult as an indie is to find a group of people or a

221
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:58,630
collab group that you want to do collabs with and be able to
like, you know, organize something really easily in general.

222
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,990
So at a company, you can literally just ask anybody.

223
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,250
Like there might be a server or something and you just be
like, at everyone, I want to play this game.

224
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,950
I want to play this game and I need people to play there.

225
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:12,910
I need three people.

226
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,910
And that is why one reason, one of the reasons why people
want to join.

227
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:26,470
They want a sense of community and they want to send a group
of people to be able to play games with or like to be able

228
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,790
to organize stuff with.

229
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,870
And it's why a lot of people would want to join.

230
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,670
And that makes sense.

231
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,490
You don't, as anything, you have to socialize and meet
people and get close enough to invite.

232
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:42,770
them to things um and when you're in a company you don't
really have to do that you don't it could be colleagues or

233
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:49,010
something and you can just be like hey you guys want to do
this i don't really know you but like you're in the company

234
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,710
um so like obviously let's do something together

235
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:08,710
so so it gives like a security of like having a group of
people that you can just work with and And you don't have to

236
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:15,790
contact people outside your circle to fill in spots or work
on socializing And the number reason is if you're a singer

237
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:25,830
or a dancer So the reason why I put that is that it's very
beneficial for If you have talents in singing or dancing to

238
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:33,150
work for a company And because of that because the reasoning
is that a lot of the biggest events that VTuber companies do

239
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:40,650
It doesn't matter how big or small are concerts and and like
singing and if you're talented at singing you will get

240
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:46,130
picked to do concerts if you can sing you'll get those
opportunities to perform around the world for fans since

241
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:53,730
you're under a group you can do big group concerts with lots
of other singers and it's much easier to set up versus as an

242
00:31:53,730 --> 00:32:02,370
individual and all the costs are within from the company and
that's why if you're a singer or a dancer it really benefits

243
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:12,210
you because like like i said um you get to pick be picked to
do these types of events and um and these are like one of

244
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:22,750
these not the i won't say the easiest events to organize but
like the most common events to uh to see uh being hosted by

245
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:32,070
vtuber companies because it's like one some things that fans
love and some things that is easy not easy but like um they

246
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:40,990
have a lot of experience organizing um and also like they
have access to like uh music labels maybe um it depends on

247
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:50,050
which company you're joining but um um if you want to be
want to make it more if you want to be like more well known

248
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:59,410
as a singer it's easier to do that when you're joining a
company versus being an individual um because getting your

249
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,930
talents out there is easier because of that.

250
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:12,830
As well as like, not only that, but cover songs, group
songs, karaoke's, these are like some of the easiest ways to

251
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,410
help boost not only your channel, but the company's branding
as well.

252
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,910
So like these are like some of the things to be aware of.

253
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,890
Because like I said, hosting concerts and stuff like that
worldwide is like some of the easiest things to do as an

254
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,830
entertainer.

255
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:38,270
For me, I think it's one of the reasons why I felt like I
was I'd be slacking off or like not worth much Because as a

256
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:45,790
person who can't sing or a beginner You have to think what
can I offer to the company that can be used for events and

257
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:52,730
big productions And it's harder because you have to be more
creative and know where your own talents lie For me, I would

258
00:33:52,730 --> 00:34:03,190
say like gaming But I can't really do that I can't have like
host like a big event Regarding like fan event regarding

259
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:15,350
gaming like it has very like harder I feel like personally
it might be harder to do versus like singing so like Also,

260
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,850
like if you know whatever like oh, but Doki what about like
tournaments and stuff like that?

261
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,830
It's harder because you can't do like LAN stuff if you're a
V-tuber

262
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,270
Like, you know, like, I mean, there's, like, moment, like,
because, like, you can't go to land.

263
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,870
So, like, that's different.

264
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,010
You can't be like, oh, my God.

265
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:53,190
Because, like, I've had moments where I was invited to do,
like, I have moments in the past where I was invited to do

266
00:34:53,190 --> 00:35:02,350
things like, like, like, physical meet and greets for, like,
gaming stuff, or, like, I had to be there like I I won't

267
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:11,450
show up I won't like be there on the stage but I had to be
there like at the event and I had to say no because as a

268
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,670
vtuber that is very dangerous

269
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:29,130
I I said no for these because like um uh like obviously like
risk-wise like being there physically being there um is for

270
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:36,930
as a vtuber there's a lot of risks to it so i've i've had to
say no to like LAN events in the past where I had to

271
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:43,790
actually be there to play the game and I didn't feel very
comfortable with that I didn't feel very comfortable uh

272
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:49,710
because I was worried that was like I was worried because I
was like I don't know if I'll be actually if like I'll be

273
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,010
safe type deal.

274
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,830
So in the past, I have said no to these opportunities.

275
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:03,110
Also, another thing is if the main branch is non-English
speaking, but you speak the language, one of the reasons why

276
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:10,150
I put this here is that if you want to apply for a company
whose main branch is in English speaking, I strongly suggest

277
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:15,390
learning that language while you're applying or if you make
it in.

278
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:30,390
offers so many opportunities, including being able to
collaborate with talents and participate in main branch

279
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,930
events.

280
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:40,970
If it is only in that language and signups are exclusive to
being able to speak that language, you're obviously shutting

281
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:50,150
down a huge set of network and a huge set of opportunities
that you wouldn't be able to access.

282
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,910
access if you don't learn that language.

283
00:36:54,010 --> 00:37:00,710
It makes sense because you have to be able to communicate
with everyone and be able to keep the production going.

284
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:07,310
And another thing is that the main consumer base and
experience will also be in the main branch.

285
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:14,370
Most of the sales and consumer products might be exclusive
to one country because manufacturing and shipping is just

286
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:14,770
easier.

287
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,730
You know, it's all there.

288
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,010
Right, right, right, right.

289
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,810
So, like, it's all there.

290
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,170
Like, overseas shipping is very expensive.

291
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:35,910
So, maybe they want to make something that is exclusive to,
like, this particular country, because it's just easier,

292
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,750
especially if it's, like, brand deals or, like, sponsors.

293
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,710
It's, like, only located in one region.

294
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,950
So it's just easier in the long run.

295
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,810
It's hard to learn a new language.

296
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:52,210
But if you're trying to apply for a company, or if you're
trying to get into a company main language is in english it

297
00:37:52,210 --> 00:38:01,730
might as well you might as well do it if you want to grow as
a content creator in that company um and if you're so it's

298
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:10,630
like it's super understandable why it would be very
beneficial to you uh to and like if you speak the language

299
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:18,290
you might have more fans in the main target demographic thus
offering you more opportunities to receive sponsors

300
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:26,670
dedicated to the main so like stuff like that like it it
seems like super simple but like it's like something you

301
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:36,870
have to be incredibly committed to do um you don't even have
to be like super fluent you could be like semi-fluent and

302
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:49,110
that is fine it just helps you in the long run um anyway you
have to have and learning language is incredibly difficult

303
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:56,210
and it's more so of like you just have to be like very
dedicated to doing so and networking also benefits because

304
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:04,570
you can reach out to like different fan bases and stuff like
that like by knowing because like obviously uh the English

305
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:12,770
fan base might be different from other language speaking fan
bases so the more you know the more beneficial it is to you

306
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:21,370
also but if you are like doing trying to cater to both fan
bases you need to be able to balance this so like you have

307
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:27,070
to be able to the hardest part is being able to balance
speaking languages for different audience basis because you

308
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:33,590
have to make sure like one audience doesn't feel left out
over the other so you have to be able to balance this very

309
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:39,930
well as well because you're gonna like you know some people
are gonna feel left out and you can't stop that people are

310
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:45,690
gonna feel left out like but you have to be able to make
sure that you're not catering to one side more than the

311
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:52,910
other so you have to find like a healthy balance my
suggestions on these is just maybe have like one stream a

312
00:39:52,910 --> 00:40:04,950
week dedicated to speaking that language just to keep up
with like nurturing that fan base or like I feel like yeah

313
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:11,630
just to be able to like have like one or two streams a week
just dedicated to that just dedicate to that and another

314
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:17,450
thing is you don't need to worry about like big picture and
legal stuff what I meant by that is that when you're in a

315
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:28,550
company So as an indie, what I've noticed is that as an
indie, when you get more like merch collaborations, like

316
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:33,850
offers and deals, there's like contracts and negotiations
that you have to be involved in.

317
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:43,430
And because of that, you also have to obviously read those
contracts of like the merch negotiations or like sponsor

318
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,750
stuff.

319
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,790
You have to be able to read the contracts.

320
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,850
But when you're in a company, you don't really have to
worry.

321
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:57,250
that much about the big picture stuff because obviously the
company will make sure it wouldn't like hurt them regarding

322
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:05,290
like sponsors and merch stuff so like you put your trust in
that but when you're as an indie you have to make sure that

323
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:12,510
like even if your manager is reading as an indie even your
manager is reading that you have to read it yourself as well

324
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:20,510
because what the manager is doing doesn't necessarily mean
that that is what you want so you have to be able to read

325
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:26,810
your contracts and negotiate for things you want and that's
also obviously like a lot of work

326
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:42,680
anyway another one obviously is like 3d obviously companies
are very well experienced with having doing 3ds and having

327
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:49,900
3d done like they have all the experience and I would say
people in Japan, companies in Japan, have the most

328
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:57,440
experience with doing VTuber 3D stuff because, you know,
they've been doing, they've, like, perfected it type deal.

329
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,700
They perfected it, and I feel like in NA, a lot of companies
in NA are still playing catch-up when it comes to what JP

330
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,700
companies have done, or not just JP companies, but JP
Indies, too.

331
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:23,540
Indies in Japan also have, a lot of studios in japan are
very well versed in doing anime 3ds and they are still doing

332
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,880
catch-up so there's still a lot of time like there's still a
lot of catch-up it's also a lot of work

333
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:40,080
3d in general is a lot of work so uh but that's like one
thing that can offer as an indie you might not be able to

334
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:50,580
have that opportunity because as an indie um getting a
studio that's able to be able to handle all of that having

335
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:58,900
the assets made as well the thing about like come like
Japanese companies and Japanese like 3d tech is that a lot

336
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:08,600
of them have already have assets made from the past that you
can use um so they're always keeping assets that can help

337
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:18,360
benefit them more in the future um it's a lot of money
invested and they've already invested so much money that's

338
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:24,020
why like it is much more difficult as an indie and this if
you're really looking forward to an indie to being doing 3d

339
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:30,340
and stuff there's a reason why you want to join company and
finally sponsors um it's easier you don't have to reach out

340
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:41,500
for sponsors like a lot of times you don't have to make a
fucking deck like okay so you guys don't know you have to

341
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:49,120
have a pitch deck main as an indie but like for sponsors the
company already provide well like your company will be

342
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:57,440
working on finding these sponsors for you and uh so we don't
know what pitch deck is is basically a pitch deck is to

343
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:05,500
basically uh like a thing that you send to companies to like
business companies or sponsors or brand deals to like

344
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:12,800
advertise yourself and it's like as an indie you should have
that one main because like that is your way of like

345
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,760
advertising yourself as like a portfolio to advertise
yourself to like other companies but when you're part of a

346
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,440
company you don't have to worry about that your company will
be doing all that and they'll be picking people who they

347
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,380
want to do to represent particular brands and stuff like
that like you don't have to worry about anything you get

348
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:43,240
sponsored you'll just be pleasantly surprised like now
things to be aware of Number one, you're like, I don't know,

349
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,920
things that you need to be aware of.

350
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,900
Because if these things are not Gucci with you, then you're
going to have a rough time.

351
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:06,120
So, so if you are not cool with any of these things, you're
going to have a really rough time.

352
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:24,180
so one of them is permissions obviously uh when you're in a
company it doesn't even matter even if you're an na company

353
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:31,960
and even if you're like an na company this is like one of
the things you have to worry about the most because like

354
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,300
because you're not really safe

355
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:50,000
because they see you as corpa so you're not really safe in
general um and and they're more yeah companies are more um

356
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:58,560
more like looked at regarding perms it doesn't matter what
country you're in uh it really if you want to be really

357
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,620
smart about it if you're in from na you want to be really
smart on it just play na games but when you start playing

358
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:12,620
games or like try to do stuff outside of na that's when
things messy you might have fair use laws but you're part of

359
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:21,180
but even then that's not really gonna protect you um when
you're playing things or doing things else and the country

360
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:34,080
of origin is not america or canada or just not na so like i
said you need permission for things music games and others

361
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:41,880
what do you mean by others graphics pictures images videos
everything if you think showing pictures of something if you

362
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:50,100
guys didn't know um so there's like a lot of like many
things that a lot of like companies are like really strict

363
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,880
about like one of the i like i can give like so many like
famous examples but i won't because i don't want to get in

364
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:13,520
trouble but if you look hard enough like you can find them
And obviously, like some of the things that obviously you

365
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:20,860
should be like, you guys didn't know, like you can't make
like fan products of Sanrio stuff because they're very

366
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:27,460
strict regarding like fan products of like Sanrio things.

367
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:34,040
So like stuff like this, you can easily get stuff taking
down if you put like, I don't know, some like Hello Kitty

368
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,280
stuff that wasn't made by Sanrio.

369
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,420
Like you made your own Hello Kitty product, they will try
and take it down.

370
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,120
because like it's not made by them and stuff like that you
have to be worried it's not just music and games there's so

371
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,420
many other things to worry about and you might not be happy
that you can't get the permission that you want for stuff

372
00:47:51,420 --> 00:48:01,520
certain things and uh you're very restricted on the games
you can play and like obviously music as well so like um uh

373
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:09,800
maybe like uh uh maybe some game companies don't give you
explicit permission and stuff like that so there's some

374
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:16,340
things like this to worry about you might maybe this is like
your favorite game of all time you really want to play it

375
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:25,600
like you really want to stream it but you can't and you have
to be able to accept that someone says is this only for

376
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:33,660
japanese companies no a lot of like smaller companies in NA
have to deal with that too because they don't want to worry

377
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:45,740
about like because like maybe if it's an NA game that's fine
if it's an NA developer and publisher then like you know

378
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:55,480
that's fine but if you're trying to do something that's
outside of NA then it's more of a risk and obviously when I

379
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:01,400
say other like someone said what about mods stuff like that
you have to get the permission from the original creator

380
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,260
usually some of them would say no

381
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:16,380
so but you have to have an explicit permit explicit
permissions for stuff like that so um so like it doesn't

382
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:23,520
matter like mods stuff like that like fan translations like
you have to worry about things like that obviously like i

383
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:30,540
said certain restrictions are to follow like not only just
with games and everything is how you handle yourself and

384
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:38,560
maybe like you're not allowed to do certain things or uh say
certain things because like you represent the company and

385
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,400
you have to be aware what you say and how you act because
what you do doesn't just reflect yourself but the whole

386
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:50,260
company so you have to be aware that your stance and actions
reflect the company's values your image and beliefs are tied

387
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:58,220
to the company so like you have to be very aware and if you
join a company in a lot of things.

388
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,960
You cannot, it's, it's, because like, you don't want it to
hurt yourself in the long run.

389
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,000
So you have to be incredibly neutral.

390
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:13,320
You have to be sure of, like, when you say things, of, like,
I like this thing that it's safe to say.

391
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:20,540
Like, that's what you have, because you're representing, now
you're not representing yourself.

392
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,500
It doesn't matter if that's your own opinion.

393
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,520
You represent the company.

394
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,880
So it doesn't matter.

395
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,400
You have to be neutral.

396
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,320
You're here to entertain.

397
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,480
You're like, you have to be like incredible.

398
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,080
You have to be safe and everything.

399
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:48,140
Um, and even then, if you are an indie that's planning to
join a company, you have to make sure you're like, I guess

400
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,340
like brand friendly type deal.

401
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,380
You have to be like brand friendly because like what you say
on the internet is forever.

402
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,260
It doesn't matter if it's like, oh, that was before, before
then, you know.

403
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:07,760
What you say on the internet is forever, so you have to be
sure that, like, you know, you're pretty much, like, your,

404
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,080
your, like, internet history is, like, okay.

405
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
Yes, the internet never forgets.

406
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,740
And then, obviously, another thing is juggling your schedule
regarding overlaps.

407
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,920
You don't want to over...

408
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,140
You want to be respectful to other people's schedules.

409
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,980
So, like, maybe, like, oh, this person's going to have a
sponsor stream at that time.

410
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,120
I don't want to overlap it.

411
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,100
I'm going to make sure to rate into the sponsor stream.

412
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:46,700
Because, like, how well they do in sponsors might mean,
like, the sponsor would want to do more with us.

413
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,740
So stuff like that.

414
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,780
You have to be very smart in how you arrange your schedule
and everything.

415
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,880
So you have to be sure that, like, that you're, like,
helping.

416
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,620
everybody not just yourself you can't just focus on yourself
you have to be sure that you're helping everybody if

417
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:12,800
everybody if if everybody grows that's a good thing you're a
team player so so it's very frustrating especially when

418
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,780
you're like oh i really want to do at this time slot but you
have to be a team player because you have to make sure that

419
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:24,620
everybody is is like going well so that in the long run you
will go well you will do well in the long run for everybody

420
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:35,840
um and it's all about like working together type deal uh so
and obviously like i said like percentage cuts taken i think

421
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:42,080
that's like very self-explanatory when you're working for a
company it doesn't necessarily mean you obviously like they

422
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:47,860
take a percentage so because they're like funding some
things they're helping you in some stuff they are arranging

423
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:55,100
things for you and stuff like that so it's obvious so that
is why people would want to join a company and those are the

424
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,760
pros and like what you have to be aware of, of what you have
to do.

425
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,780
So now you're running.

426
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,320
Okay, what about an indie?

427
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:11,180
So as an indie, basically it's like opposite of obviously a
lot of stuff I said regarding company.

428
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,860
So as an indie, like I said, there's more freedom what you
can do.

429
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:16,840
You're an indie.

430
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,500
There's so much more freedom.

431
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,340
There's a lot more.

432
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,060
Yay.

433
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:36,160
you have all the creative control on everything you do and
how you want your channel to be and you get to keep a

434
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:44,460
hundred percent what you make because you're by yourself
you're an indie like i think sorry i accidentally smacked

435
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:57,820
something so uh frank's taking the super chat thank you
thank you take this 100 percent also i Just realized I never

436
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,560
asked you guys how the sound was.

437
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,520
I hope the sound has been okay so far.

438
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,540
Hey, I hope the BGM has been like okay.

439
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,620
It's not too loud.

440
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,440
It's a bit low.

441
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,080
Okay, that's great.

442
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:14,540
That's fine.

443
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,320
You just want to listen to my voice anyway.

444
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,020
Why do you guys want to listen to that BGM?

445
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,340
It's all about the information I give you.

446
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:34,620
okay i'll boost it a little higher all right i'll give you
guys i'll give it a little higher all right so anyway as i

447
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:43,900
was saying um and your networking connection stays with you
so like you don't have to like you know everything your

448
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:49,840
connections and all of that directly goes to you it's not
that correctly from the company you know you don't have your

449
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:57,460
connections from the company you have the connections from
yourself so everything just funnels to you um and And then

450
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,520
you get to create the merchandise you want to make and guide
the production.

451
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:05,120
So, like I said, the thing about being an indie is just
everything is up to you.

452
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,540
How you want to make your career.

453
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,580
But, of course, with more freedom comes more risk.

454
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:21,060
So, because of that, you're opening yourself up legally to
more risk that you might not be prepared of.

455
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:26,560
So, like, obviously, like, scams, stuff like that.

456
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:34,720
And you have to, you have to like make sure, sure you have
to have a, depending on how big you are as a content creator

457
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,300
or a VTuber.

458
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:42,000
Or if you want to try and get to learn these things, you
will eventually have to have a business lawyer that can help

459
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,200
you look over contracts.

460
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:50,800
And especially regarding like, you don't want to be taking
advantage when it comes to like sponsors and brand deals.

461
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,040
You want to accidentally take a bad sponsor.

462
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,800
So there's like, there's like liability and stuff like that.

463
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:06,260
So you have to have a business lawyer that's there to read
your contracts and be able to like help you with stuff like

464
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:06,900
this.

465
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:12,180
So you also have to work harder when it comes to networking
and branding because it all comes down to you.

466
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:23,660
Obviously you don't have the company brand to like help you
with getting no people or with networking and branding.

467
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,100
You have to do all this yourself.

468
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:34,700
yourself and then you have to be smarter with this branding
and doing what is meta like you can't unless you want to be

469
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:45,180
niche but niche is also harder variety is an easier route
versus niche streaming because niche streaming when you're

470
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:51,840
doing niche streaming they you're restricted to that certain
niche you can't really branch out because the moment you

471
00:56:51,840 --> 00:57:00,540
branch out your viewership will not follow you it doesn't
matter if you're like no they love me your viewership most

472
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:06,980
likely will just find another streamer that might be
streaming that particular niche so you don't want to cater

473
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:16,820
it's it's better for long-term streaming to be a variety
streamer because when that niche dies you are you are in

474
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:20,020
trouble you have to really like figure out what to do

475
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:34,640
fucking dedicated fan base but that in itself is also very
difficult so like like someone said if you only stream that

476
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:42,920
one thing those viewers will only show up for that one thing
so you have to it's long term wise variety is better for you

477
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:53,240
long term um even though it's harder to get started variety
is better to to have versus uh versus like beating a niche

478
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,500
And when you're in a company, you can go niche easier.

479
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,320
But because, like, you're under the company brand.

480
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:09,000
So, like, there are viewers that would be like, oh, I love
just watching people in this company.

481
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,180
So, like, it doesn't matter for you if you're a niche in a
company.

482
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,860
But when you're a niche as an indie, it affects a lot more.

483
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,140
Britt, thank you for the super chat.

484
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:22,680
Thank you, thank you.

485
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:32,040
purpose for games cover etc or is it unnecessary as an indie
if you're doing reaction content i would highly suggest

486
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:45,620
don't risk it on your channel or put it on twitch if you
want to do a reaction content just do it on twitch and then

487
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:51,680
like and that way and then like edit in a way that has that
benefits fair use.

488
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:01,360
Like, I would say that, like, if it benefits, and if you're
going to react to something and you think that you can

489
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:08,480
upload it on your channel, make sure the thing you're
reacting to is something within NA and not, like, outside of

490
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:08,880
NA.

491
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:16,740
Because then, if it's outside of NA, it's harder because,
you know, some countries might not have fair use laws.

492
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:37,000
regarding games music covers i would say cover songs um look
up song permissions if you're doing japanese covers look up

493
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:47,560
song terms for like japanese songs because like they have
the right to take down your song if you don't have proper

494
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:58,800
permissions um and if you're doing like maybe if uh and then
also like English songs they might get copyright claimed but

495
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:04,940
like or like but it doesn't affect your channel stuff like
that they'll just take the revenue if you're okay with your

496
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:10,720
music having your revenue taken um then that's fine

497
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:23,280
that's uh that's that it's okay because the most common
factor is like na songs like english songs it's mostly like

498
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:29,740
they just they just give you like a copyright claim where
they just take your revenue and unless you're just there to

499
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:37,880
like have views that's okay but if you actually want money
from doing cover songs um then you have to make sure that

500
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:57,020
like that particular song you're is okay perms-wise that you
won't get claimed like that's it um what else uh but yeah as

501
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:03,740
i said you have to follow as meta so fear of missing out
games so you saw me like a difficult what was it supermarket

502
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:13,500
simulator uh what's it the climbing game um stuff like that
you have to be honest the moment you realize it is the

503
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,560
streaming game.

504
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,120
You have to be on that shit.

505
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,700
It's that's it.

506
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:29,040
Because people want to watch those games and that's really,
you have to flavor up that week.

507
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,720
So you have to make sure you play it because you don't want
to miss out.

508
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,600
It's all about the meta.

509
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,700
And how do I figure out?

510
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:49,040
what's flavor of the month streams you literally look at the
biggest streamers out there that do variety and they're on

511
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:57,300
that shit the moment it releases how what's an easier way if
you don't know which streamer to watch go on twitch and look

512
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:04,940
at most popular game being streamed right now and that's how
you fought that is how i found out supermarket simulator and

513
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:10,600
the climbing game I literally go like I was like on Twitch
and I saw I was like, wait, what's this?

514
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:11,620
Everybody's streaming it.

515
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,220
All the flesh tubers are streaming it.

516
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,040
I was like, wow, this is clearly the streamer game.

517
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,280
So like I decided to play it because I was like, if people
really enjoy it, if a lot of people are watching it, clearly

518
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,740
it's a very entertaining game.

519
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,500
And then there's some games that doesn't matter.

520
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,460
There's some games like Outer Wilds.

521
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:35,920
I highly recommend streaming games such as Outer Wilds
because those games are like...

522
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,680
Games that have discord servers dedicated to it

523
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:56,020
And it's basically like Um, I talked about this before But
there's like games that have like cult fandoms So like outer

524
01:02:56,020 --> 01:03:02,320
wilds is one of those games Where there's a discord server
dedicated to like finding streamers That are streaming outer

525
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:11,120
wilds Because they want to chase the high that outer wilds
gave them because they want to live vicariously through the

526
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:20,000
streamer streaming outer wilds so like yeah souls games and
outer wilds are some of these games or undertale too souls

527
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,140
games undertale and outer wilds are one of these games that
are really well-known streamer games because there are

528
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:32,840
servers dedicated to fighting other streamers that are
streaming that game because they want to live vicariously

529
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:41,400
through that game so if you're starting out these are like
some of the fucking they're they're the reason why they're

530
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:47,500
called stream games they're the reason why they're called
the streamer meta or the stream games and every fucking

531
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:53,720
streamer it doesn't matter what streamer you are it doesn't
matter if you're a vtuber or a flesh tuber or like whatever

532
01:03:53,720 --> 01:04:04,000
content creator you are they love that shit and also gotcha
game but Like, if you're starting out, I would, I don't

533
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,960
know, I feel like you should invest your money unless you
want to be a gotcha streamer, but like, and you think you're

534
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,540
going to have your investment pay off later, and or you're
really fucking passionate about gotcha, but you're starting

535
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,800
out, a lot of your money is going to be spent on reinvesting
in your channel.

536
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,700
So like, that's why I was like avoiding gotcha, because
like, because you're investing on the gotcha instead of the

537
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,160
channel.

538
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:30,300
So, but if you're really passionate about gotcha, then feel
free to do gotcha.

539
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,000
Like, I'm not going to restrict you.

540
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:45,960
Anyway, so by the way, I have like 17 slides and I realized
we're Some of them are like really fast I think I think this

541
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:53,180
these two were like my longest slides But I hope it's been
like informative so far I hope this has been like

542
01:04:53,180 --> 01:05:05,520
informative for you guys And like good advice Alright
auditioning obviously i won't be giving out audition secrets

543
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:13,340
um but like i've talked about this before um if you guys
look hard enough you guys can find an archive but like when

544
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:27,720
i got to when i passed the first round i researched a lot
and i had a 10 page document um going in to round two i um i

545
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:34,040
went obviously like the first stage would be like submitting
a video audition of stuff like that and then when i realized

546
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:45,700
my video audition passed i made a 10 page document detailing
like everything about preparing myself to the next round and

547
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:52,980
i was very i i like worked very hard on that and all in
there was like research and stuff like that um obviously i

548
01:05:52,980 --> 01:06:04,280
can't give out my document but i can give you advice on how
to look research similar ways um There's lots of resources

549
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:13,780
out there from members within companies that reveal very
crucial audition advice and insight onto the interviews and

550
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:14,780
the audition tapes.

551
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:23,080
Like, if you look hard enough, you can actually find
members, not just like, you know, like members from

552
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:30,020
different branches that talk about specific info regarding
the audition stage.

553
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:42,720
looked at twitter and youtube in different languages to find
audition interview questions so like i highly recommend you

554
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:49,860
guys if you want to audition and a lot of times i would
believe the audition questions would be like super similar

555
01:06:49,860 --> 01:07:02,780
like because it's like how many different types of questions
can you ask about vtubing so it doesn't matter So, like,

556
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,300
it's like stuff like that.

557
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:13,940
And then when you're doing your application, you have to
find your niche and main character type that you want to

558
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:16,580
play because they're trying to find a character for you.

559
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:22,840
They're trying to figure out, like, what will you bring?

560
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,460
Will you have, will you be the same personality that they
have five times?

561
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,360
Like, they already have?

562
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,420
Or will you be a new personality?

563
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:38,640
will you be a personality that has that is similar to like
one of their popular talents and they want to try and like

564
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:46,600
you know have another talent that is just as popular stuff
like that so you got to figure out what you're bringing and

565
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:55,800
like how to market yourself type deal and um you just have
to figure out like what you're bringing to the table and we

566
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:03,280
have to know that like there's more competition now because
VTubing is still is growing and like there's a lot of people

567
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:13,600
that want to be want this to be their big break a lot of
like hidden gems that want this to be like uh uh just want

568
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:22,660
this to be like the thing that you know that's gonna like
make them famous so there's more competition now so

569
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:31,440
standards and quality are higher what I submitted back then
as a video audition might not have fucking worked later on

570
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:45,700
if I try it on like try it now like it will not I personally
think it will not work so like obviously the quality wise

571
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:56,200
might be a lot higher depending on what type of company you
want to apply for it um it's definitely must have changed I

572
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:04,900
would assume has changed because the market is bigger now
and the competition is a lot higher and if you really really

573
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:15,200
really want to be in the uh no matter what company you want
to be a company uh vtuber don't be afraid of applying over

574
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:23,160
and over and over and over again until you make it in like
if you like most likely you might get ghosted not ghosted

575
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,780
but like usually if you're rejected on the first round, you
wouldn't even get an email.

576
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:36,660
So, like, and there's guidelines being like, if we don't
reply back within like X amount of months, try again.

577
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,740
Just try again.

578
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:38,460
Just keep submitting.

579
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,020
A lot of people would be like, I just kept submitting until
it worked.

580
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,840
And like, at that point, if you really want to join, just
keep submitting.

581
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,700
But also don't slack off on, like, you know, streaming as an
indie.

582
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,220
Just keep going as an indie.

583
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:52,620
And keep going as an indie and keep submitting.

584
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:53,680
That's really it.

585
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,240
So, you just have to keep taking your shots.

586
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,040
And that is really auditioning.

587
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,080
Um, equipment.

588
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,060
All right.

589
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,660
Number one.

590
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,860
Audio is so fucking important.

591
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,200
I will not watch a stream if I hear shitty audio quality.

592
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,140
That is like 100% for me.

593
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,260
This is my opinion.

594
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:20,800
But like, I will turn off a stream if the audio is this
fucking shit.

595
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:26,920
Like, like, like, That shit is so important.

596
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,880
Audio, that fucking shit is so important.

597
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,300
So remember to have good audio.

598
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:41,680
Like, if the first thing you're going to invest, please
invest in a microphone, a good quality mic.

599
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,780
And it is very, very...

600
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:51,460
Okay, I started out with a cheap $1 mic because I didn't
care.

601
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,020
when I used to live in Asia.

602
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,920
So, like, I was like, I just wanted a mic to communicate
with my teammates.

603
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,160
It wasn't about streaming, which I later used for streaming.

604
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,040
But I was, like, streaming, like, Overwatch.

605
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,360
So, like, it didn't really matter that much for me.

606
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,800
So, like, later on, when I got a little bit more serious, I
upgraded to a Blue Yeti.

607
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:22,720
Because Blue Yeti at that time was, like, a budget.

608
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:36,240
but it's still pretty expensive when you're starting out
like I know it says budget but like it's still like a pricey

609
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:48,960
microphone and it's actually like a good starting out mic if
you want to earn the snowball honestly like Yeti products

610
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:57,100
but I went with Blue Yeti but obviously a cheaper
alternative will be the snowball um but yes when i started

611
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:04,040
getting more serious later on but yes you want to be a
vtuber it's a huge investment similar with flesh tubing you

612
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:12,660
have to have like you know like the camera and stuff like
that it's a huge investment and obviously like uh you have

613
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:21,060
to be willing to put money onto this doesn't matter skin
suit rigging all that stuff you have to be willing to invest

614
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:28,320
in all of least in not all of these but like if you want to
like have a career you have to be able to invest in this um

615
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:37,100
anyway anyway as i said audio if you're investing anything
if you don't want to invest too much at least invest in

616
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:46,140
better audio um like i said get a mixer i have it go go xlr
but that is baby mixer because i'm stupid

617
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:01,120
If you talk to audio people, they will be like, oh, don't
get the GoXLR, you know, about mixing.

618
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,980
But I am stupid.

619
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,220
And GoXLR is like baby's first mixer.

620
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,120
And it's for, like, stupid people like me.

621
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,860
Because it's like very...

622
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,840
What's the word?

623
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:13,500
It's very...

624
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,500
It's like very intuitive.

625
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:31,940
If you know how to use audio, I would suggest asking your
audio friends, like people who are in music, to recommend

626
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,120
you better mixers.

627
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,540
And what are mixers?

628
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,100
Mixers, make sure you don't fucking peek when you're
talking.

629
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:45,960
So when you're laughing, when you're screaming, stuff like
that, mixers is a way to make sure your audio doesn't peek.

630
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:46,820
It's nice.

631
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,920
When you're whispering, it's not fucking terrible.

632
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,820
You can mute stuff, but you have to.

633
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:58,320
Like, you can mute audio so that people can hear, but you
can hear, stuff like that.

634
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,300
So, like, that's what you can control your collab partners
and stuff.

635
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,500
You can control your collab partners' audio.

636
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,000
But that's why I go with the GoXLR.

637
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:14,800
It's very intuitive and very, like, also there's sound
effects, stuff like that, but that doesn't really matter to

638
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,100
me.

639
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:25,320
All I use the GoXLR to help me with, like, making sure for
collabs and making sure I don't peak when I, uh, when I,

640
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:29,020
like, talk too loud, or if I scream, stuff like that.

641
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,120
It just, it helps a lot.

642
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,900
It normalizes your audio.

643
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,660
Um, audio balancing is so fucking important.

644
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,980
Audio, you can use OBS audio filters, but it's not as good
as a mixer.

645
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:54,900
uh it's not as good um but like i said goxlr is baby's first
mixer and like all the audio people would fucking judge you

646
01:14:54,900 --> 01:15:03,580
for using a goxlr but you're stupid like me that is all you
need like i do not have the brain capacity to fucking

647
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:13,040
research stuff like this or be able to use an actual real
mixer correctly like if you look at what real mixers look

648
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,980
like they look so fucking complicated, then I can't be
bothered.

649
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:26,420
So, so, obviously, other mixers are cheaper.

650
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,440
Like, the actual real ones.

651
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:37,280
But, but GoXLR is so good for babies like me.

652
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,960
There's just too many buttons!

653
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:42,940
I can't!

654
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,360
I can't handle it!

655
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:52,040
there's so many buttons and sliders what the does i don't
know i don't know i'm not an audio person i just stream

656
01:15:52,040 --> 01:16:07,120
anyway um you have to ask around if you don't want to go and
go xlr you have to ask around um anyway so like i was saying

657
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:16,040
uh the reason why audio balancing is so important is that
when you are in the collab a lot of times not a lot of times

658
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:25,060
but there are some viewers that will only watch the streamer
that has the best audio balance so you might not be you know

659
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:30,920
they're like oh hey i want to hear everybody you know i want
to hear everybody i want to know what everybody's saying i

660
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,740
want to know what everybody's talking about so they want to
have want to go to a stream that has the best audio

661
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:40,060
balancing and they'll look at all the other streams in the
collab and be like oh this stream has the best audio

662
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:49,400
balancing i'm gonna watch this stream so i can um so i can
figure out um like i can hear everything and stuff so that

663
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:59,060
is why audio balancing is very important and i have an audio
guy i have an odd person that um i have a person that

664
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:09,120
watches my streams to make sure my my audio balancing is
good i personally have a person that looks at that person as

665
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:15,600
well they like work on music and stuff so i personally have
a music person to make sure everybody is balanced my sound

666
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,800
guy um and that's why i'll be like sound guy i will
sometimes look at discord because i would have them on

667
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,940
discord and they'll be like is the audio good and stuff like
that so uh that's what my sound guy does because i want to

668
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:32,940
make sure that everything is okay and that is very important
like i said there's viewers that will only watch a collab

669
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,280
stream with the person that has the best audio balancing.

670
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:41,520
It's all about maximizing the comfort of the viewer.

671
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:45,480
So, you know, you can ask a friend to be like, hey, can you
check my stream?

672
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:51,100
If you don't have like a person really to like really check
on your audio, you can ask a friend.

673
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:57,640
Like, don't ask chat because chat is not a hive mind.

674
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:10,760
You'd be like, hey, chat how's the audio never fully trust
chat because chat is not a hype mind and it really depends

675
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:17,260
on their headphones on whether or not like the audio is good
some people say yes some people say no and then you don't

676
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:29,760
know who to listen to find one person you trust very much to
not to to monitor your audio and just monitor your audio for

677
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:37,720
the first like one minute to And then at that point, then
you can, they don't have to be there.

678
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,540
They can be, if they want to, they can be there.

679
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:43,800
But like, you know, if you're asking a friend, you don't
want to force them.

680
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,640
I can literally see my baby go XLR.

681
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,000
Tell me that I'm not muted.

682
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,620
This is why you get a mixer, too.

683
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,900
So some people can't troll you.

684
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,120
Also, TV, thank you for the five gift and shifts.

685
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,240
Thank you, thank you.

686
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:04,860
So, so having it.

687
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:13,660
sound person dedicated to monitoring your balance is like
really helpful especially long term um because like i said

688
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:18,920
it really affects it anyway so i gave you guys my timeline
of like what the microphones i use so i use a cheap one

689
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:27,900
dollar mic then i evolved to a blue yeti and then i used an
at 2020 and then i moved on to the sure sm7b the sure sm7b

690
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:34,860
is my current microphone that i use at the moment i'm
planning on maybe in the future to upgrade my microphone

691
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:45,380
again but only more so of like whenever i get my pc upgraded
um i will upgrade my microphone as well so for now we're i'm

692
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:55,120
keeping my sure mic at the moment um but this is like my
timeline of everything um if you are a singer if you want to

693
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,080
get started into singing these are not singing microphones

694
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:01,520
this.

695
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,060
These are not singing microphones.

696
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,160
These are podcast microphones.

697
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:14,960
So if you want to sing, I would suggest asking your fellow
friends who are singers or research singing microphones

698
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:20,440
because there is like singing microphones are way different.

699
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,640
I would highly suggest not singing with these microphones.

700
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:41,740
you need a different mic I personally don't remember what
mics you need because um when I sing when I record things I

701
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:52,880
just go to a studio um or I just like and then and then I or
I sing with my sure microphone because I don't care um it's

702
01:20:52,880 --> 01:21:06,400
the studio or my sure microphone because I'm not I don't
care as much but if you're serious get a actual singing mic

703
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:17,400
and like research on that I can't give you the research for
that because I don't know that's really really I can say

704
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:26,120
about like microphones everything else in my opinion is just
a bonus everything else like as long as you have good like

705
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:33,220
when you're starting out think all the other stuff you can
just invest in the future when you have the money but if you

706
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:40,800
want to start your career i would the main thing you focus
on investment wise is the audio everything else bonus it

707
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:52,660
doesn't matter until you get like actually make money anyway
um for example like this is my other equipment i have three

708
01:21:52,660 --> 01:22:00,640
monitors it's for efficiency wise so i can reach out on on
one of the monitors my right monitor that's vertical and

709
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:09,300
then i have obs and other browsers and stuff uh on my left i
have my main content if it's a game in the center monitor so

710
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:18,200
like the game will be in the center and then right now my my
notes is in the center so i can read it and everything so um

711
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:26,740
so that is like why i have three microphones if you want to
get an iphone i would highly suggest an iphone x or higher

712
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:36,760
because that is the best for facial tracking due to the
inbuilt facial tracking when it comes to v-tubing so i would

713
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:48,200
highly suggest if you want really good like really good skin
suits and iphone x or higher um obviously tanky pc or dual

714
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:55,140
pc setup a dual pc setup means you don't have to have
incredible parts like you don't have to have like oh sorry i

715
01:22:55,140 --> 01:23:02,220
mean three monitors i don't know what said but I meant three
monitors I meant three I don't know that say three PCs I

716
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:12,860
meant three monitors you can either have an incredibly tanky
PC or you have a dual PC set up dual PC set up doesn't

717
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:19,400
require you to have like really insane parts because it
helps like one PC will be used for streaming and then the

718
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:32,380
other PC will be used for games or like other stuff so like
that's really helps is that vtubing apps take up a lot

719
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:36,160
sometimes and plus whatever game you're streaming.

720
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,320
Sometimes you're like, oh, why are you lagging?

721
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,600
Why are you losing frames?

722
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,820
I streamed this game.

723
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,940
I don't have any issues with it.

724
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:46,300
But we also have like us on the screen.

725
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,980
So that takes up a lot of space too.

726
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:54,180
So that is why when you're vtubing, it requires more
resources.

727
01:23:54,820 --> 01:24:02,500
So I highly suggest if you invest on a better PC invest in
dual pc setup and also a lot of the current games are

728
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,760
fucking terribly optimized

729
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:20,400
optimization is shit so uh so you have to worry about that
too so like that's why like you just you just had to have a

730
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:31,440
better optim you just had to have a better pc now and my
headphones is the 70 pro I don't know that matters I don't

731
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:38,600
know anything about headphones I asked one sound guy about
it and then they like recommended this headphone so then I

732
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:48,520
bought it uh but like I honestly have like I don't know if
you can try and copy my headphones too I also have fiber

733
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:58,220
internet because my niche in a way I'm more of a variety
streamer but like I do have like a FPS.

734
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,780
By the way, I'm going to be in Twitch Rivals for Apex
Legends next week.

735
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:04,640
So, great segue.

736
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,840
But ping really matters to me.

737
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,860
So, that's why I have fiber internet.

738
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:18,520
But, obviously, like, really, not every place has fiber
internet.

739
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:20,820
But, yes, anyway.

740
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,140
Alright, so that is the equipment.

741
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,420
I hope that is helpful regarding equipment-wise.

742
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:36,420
all right twitch versus youtube okay i know like it's like
very brief but i also have like more stuff to say about it

743
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:45,700
as well so twitch versus youtube should you stream on twitch
should you do youtube or should you multi-stream um the

744
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:56,560
thing okay so i am primarily on youtube is because i'm used
to it um i also i like having set schedules um i don't like

745
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:06,780
streaming whatever I want because uh I'm super fucking
indecisive I like knowing what I'm doing I used to not but

746
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:18,280
then now I'm like I like knowing what I'm going to do um so
like because it helps me plan my day and time uh anyway like

747
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:28,080
I said for Twitch the biggest benefits of Twitch is the
rating system uh which benefits you because if you're

748
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:38,360
starting out raids help so much with growing your presence
and channel so youtube has raids but like it's not as

749
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:51,520
utilized as twitch because it's harder to find people to
raid because like the youtube rating system is uh is like

750
01:26:51,520 --> 01:27:01,900
not as usable i guess in a way it's it's like It benefits
companies more than it benefits individuals for YouTube.

751
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,760
But on Twitch, it benefits, you know, everybody, like
individuals.

752
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:13,620
Like, if you're an indie, Twitch rating benefits more so
than YouTube rating.

753
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:18,260
Because, like, there's not a lot of VTubers on YouTube as an
indie.

754
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:24,200
And it's harder for discoverability on YouTube versus
Twitch.

755
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:33,960
The thing about Twitch is that there is, like, an option to,
look for like lower viewed streamers on twitch to find raids

756
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:39,900
like there are moments when like you know bigger content
creators on twitch will go to a category the thing about

757
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:48,640
youtube you can't go to a category and you know find people
you want to raid and also like um not everybody has the

758
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:58,540
option on um if you guys don't know if you're starting out
on youtube the rating is off automatically YouTube rating.

759
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,480
On Twitch, it's on automatically.

760
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:06,340
So, like, on Twitch, you can, like, go to a category and be
like, I want to rate somebody in this category.

761
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:10,260
And then you can, you know, browse through and be like, oh,
I want to rate somebody in the VTuber category.

762
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:22,000
And then you'll be like, oh, this person doesn't have,
doesn't have, like, a lot of, like, people, you know.

763
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,120
Oh, did I spell it wrong?

764
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,600
Sorry, I can't be bothered to fix it.

765
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:35,020
But you can go to the category and be like, oh, hey, this
person doesn't have a lot of viewers.

766
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,020
I'm going to rate them.

767
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,780
There's a lot of success stories like that.

768
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:45,560
For example, NiceWig blew up because Dizzy, and for those
who don't know Apex, I'm just going to do Apex terms.

769
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:54,640
The reason why NiceWig blew up was because Dizzy was
browsing through Apex Twitch streamers and found NiceWig on

770
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,280
Twitch streaming in the Apex category.

771
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,960
Nizzi at the time was the Apex streamer.

772
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:05,220
Was like the biggest Apex streamer at that time.

773
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,960
And he raided NiceWig.

774
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:10,860
And NiceWig took that big luck opportunity.

775
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:14,060
And rode it to where he is now.

776
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:18,160
And it's stuff like that.

777
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:23,780
Like now NiceWig is like one of like the biggest known Apex
streamer out there.

778
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,900
He's like the official Bcaster for ALGS.

779
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:35,860
that so like that is why when you're starting out and you
want to hit the easiest way to hit your biggest break is on

780
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:44,140
twitch maybe later on you can move to youtube but i think if
you're starting out this is na by the way na if you're

781
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:51,400
starting out i don't know for other countries but you're
starting out i would say twitch is your biggest bet in terms

782
01:29:51,400 --> 01:30:06,340
of making it on youtube it is a lot there's less
discoverability as a YouTuber, as an indie YouTuber, it's a

783
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:07,000
lot harder.

784
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:13,460
And more so, streaming is a Twitch thing for NA people.

785
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,900
For English-speaking audiences, if you're a streamer, you're
on Twitch.

786
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:22,420
YouTube is still trying to figure this out for NA.

787
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:27,620
I was just lucky to be able to do YouTube.

788
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:31,740
because I already have an audience established on YouTube.

789
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,800
So it's a lot easier.

790
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,820
It's a lot easier to get started.

791
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:51,680
It's better to start on Twitch and then move on to YouTube
because I think long-term YouTube is better monetary wise

792
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,740
because you have everything in one channel.

793
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:55,760
You have the VODs.

794
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:56,460
You have videos.

795
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,580
Everything is one channel.

796
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:06,280
Usually, you just have the live stream, and then you upload
it, edited versions of your live stream to your YouTube

797
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,460
channel if you want to.

798
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:10,600
Twitch is just streaming.

799
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,220
Usually people don't watch VODs on Twitch.

800
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,560
People will watch edited content on YouTube of your Twitch
VODs.

801
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:26,320
So, that is why, like, long term, I feel like YouTube is
just better long term in general.

802
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,620
If you want to do long term wise.

803
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:35,800
anyone if you're a twitch streamer anyone having presence on
youtube have your vods edit it into highlights don't just

804
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:43,900
upload vods because like sometimes people can't fucking
watch two hours of vods

805
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:56,860
we all have short attention spans these days have a vod
channel too if you really want to and want to keep the vods

806
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:10,800
the vod just keep it i don't know but if you really want to
have a presence on youtube upload edited versions of the

807
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:17,880
edited highlights of your vod yes people would rather watch
edit highlights than the fucking two to three hour video uh

808
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:26,180
if you upload your vods have a separate vod channel the
reason why i don't upload my vods my twitch vods onto my

809
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:36,280
youtube channel my main one is that that affects my
algorithm so much because I know personally because I'm like

810
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:44,520
that too that not a lot of people would want to watch like
three hour plus of something that's already happened they

811
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:53,160
rather watch it live and because of that I have a separate
VOD channel because I know if the VOD performs not as good

812
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:57,900
as my other stuff it affects my algorithm and Like, what the
fuck?

813
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,940
YouTube would be like, whoa, what happened there, Doki?

814
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:13,080
Why is your channel fucking tanking from this one video?

815
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:19,020
And I had to separate it because I know my channels are the
meta and you have to have it separate.

816
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:22,140
Like, if I'm going to upload a video, it would be
highlights.

817
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:34,960
and that's the way you have to appease the algorithm it's
all about playing the algorithm all right but what about

818
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:42,720
multi-stream yes you can multi-stream it's a very popular
method right now especially in na i don't think like other

819
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:49,820
countries people are doing multi-streams it's mostly uh
because like it's mostly an na thing i personally don't do

820
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:52,800
multi-streams the audience.

821
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:59,860
I don't like, because you can only have one chat up there,
and like, I don't like, I personally don't like, this is my

822
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:06,640
own personal preference, and that is why I don't
multi-stream, because I don't like splitting the audiences,

823
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:18,340
and, like, I don't like cultivating different cultures of
viewerships, because, um, because, like, Twitch culture is

824
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:27,600
different from YouTube culture and then if you choose if you
multi-stream you only have one chat up and um and then

825
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:34,380
obviously if you have one particular chat up over the other
more people will go on to that stream because people would

826
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:41,040
be like oh you're gonna be paying attention to that chat so
i rather pay attention to one singular chat from one

827
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:50,540
platform and just juggle i make one my main and the other
different So, like, that is why I, uh, I, like, I don't do

828
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:57,900
multi-stream, but I know that others do multi-stream because
it's really good for growth on both platforms.

829
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:03,160
You don't know which platform is your main platform and you
want to grow as a creator.

830
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:10,340
You do small, if you're a small streamer, you can do both
because it's very good for growth.

831
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:21,740
I don't do both because, like, I particular, on nurturing
one community and one like focus on like one community

832
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:32,380
versus like trying to trying to split myself too much uh
because i do better uh focusing on one thing rather than

833
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:37,720
like two things because i'm stupid as hell that

834
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:50,340
is why obviously as a newer streamer multi-streaming is good
for you i would personally say multi-streaming would be a

835
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:57,920
good benefit for you but like uh growth wise twitch is a way
to go for growth wise if you're a smaller streamer uh

836
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:11,560
um anyway um also as a twitch streamer there is like
different cultures like i said there's different like viewer

837
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:19,940
culture and streaming cultures on youtube there's a lot of
things you have to was like one of the things that like was

838
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:28,680
the most stressful for me it was because like adjusting to
this i need a schedule before before going like more serious

839
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:35,800
and vtubing i would just stream whatever the fuck i want i
didn't have a schedule i didn't make thumbnails and i didn't

840
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:48,220
plan anything i just streamed but um when you're getting
serious on youtube youtube viewers youtube They like

841
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:48,800
schedules.

842
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,260
They like thumbnails and they like it when you plan stuff.

843
01:36:52,860 --> 01:37:00,300
But also, you have to realize that because you have a
schedule, viewers will pick and choose what they want to

844
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:00,820
watch.

845
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:05,680
So, like, you know, sometimes you stream something.

846
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:10,880
You know they're going to stream this, but it's not
something they want to watch so they don't show up.

847
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:15,960
You have more of an inconsistent, like, concurrent viewers.

848
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:21,560
uh because like you know they don't want to watch it

849
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:35,720
well on twitch viewers are like they don't care no they do
care they do care but like a lot of times when you're

850
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:41,480
watching you're on twitch when you're watching they don't
really have they do play whatever the fuck they just go like

851
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:47,700
i'm today i want to play this and then i gotta swap to that
and now i'm gonna do this and now do that there's no there's

852
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:54,680
no like actual like you don't know what's gonna happen that
type deal um but you're always there you're just there

853
01:37:54,680 --> 01:38:05,160
you're there for them type deal you don't care what they're
doing you just want to be there like so like so like twitch

854
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:11,820
viewers they're more so like whoa what's gonna happen it's
more we're just here we're just here uh it's very

855
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,480
unpredictable We're just here.

856
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,780
But then, like, YouTube, they're like, oh, they're going to
play this.

857
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,540
I don't really want to watch that.

858
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:21,080
So I guess I'll just miss it.

859
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,300
Like, it's more so, like, I'm not really into that game.

860
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,820
I'm just going to watch something else.

861
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:28,680
You know, like.

862
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,920
Like, it's stuff like that.

863
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:37,120
You're just, but Twitter, you're like, I'm just happy to be
here.

864
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:45,140
So, oh shit, chat disconnected.

865
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,140
Am I still alive?

866
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:47,860
My chat disconnected.

867
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,420
Oh, shit, okay, I'm back on.

868
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:51,700
Did I, was I still alive?

869
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,280
I don't know.

870
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,100
My chat disconnected.

871
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,940
Oh, I was.

872
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:00,280
Okay, for some reason, my chat disconnected.

873
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,180
So I was like, whoa, am I still alive?

874
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:06,660
Okay, anyway, that's basically it.

875
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,400
So you have to be aware, like, even so.

876
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:12,720
You're still cultivating a fan base on YouTube.

877
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:18,240
But, like, Twitch viewers, like, YouTube viewers have an
excuse.

878
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:21,940
Twitch viewers don't have an excuse to not watch you.

879
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:28,120
Because they're like, what if I miss an important thing
that's going to happen?

880
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:29,900
Because I wasn't there.

881
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:30,980
I don't know what's happening.

882
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:42,200
it's like you don't know they don't know they don't know
they have to be there because they're like what if oh my god

883
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:49,100
what if she's just gonna play my favorite game and i'm gonna
miss out yeah the fear of missing out yeah what if i miss a

884
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:54,740
game that oh my god she's gonna play a game that i really
like i don't know that but what if she does like you don't

885
01:39:54,740 --> 01:40:01,320
know so you're you're you're there you're there no matter
what game you're playing and then uh the fear of missing out

886
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:05,540
but youtube you're like she's gonna play that i hate that
game i'm not gonna show up

887
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:16,660
I personally like structure more I don't like randomly
picking games and stuff because like I just want to focus on

888
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:26,000
one thing um I just want to focus on one thing and then be
good with that like I I'm I don't I don't like I don't I

889
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,040
like more of a structure because I'm I'm very indecisive and
I just know what I'm doing.

890
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:39,820
I am super indecisive in general.

891
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:42,620
And then there's like memberships and stuff like that.

892
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:50,960
Like in Twitch the thing is a lot of Twitch streamers they
have Discord servers but like Discord servers for like which

893
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,660
is like the substitute of the membership stuff on YouTube.

894
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,700
YouTube offers memberships.

895
01:40:56,900 --> 01:41:04,900
On Twitch you don't have to there's like subs but You're not
required, you're not like incentivized to have like, you

896
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:08,040
know, sub only streams, stuff like that.

897
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,700
In YouTube, you are, because like it is a benefit to be a
YouTube member.

898
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:17,240
There's more exclusivity being a member.

899
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:18,060
There's more stuff to it.

900
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,200
There's a different culture on Twitch.

901
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:22,620
Subs don't have like exclusivity on there.

902
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,740
There's no exclusive stuff other than like Discord servers.

903
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:29,460
I know like a lot of like Twitch VTubers, a lot of Twitch
content creators.

904
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:37,660
They have, like, a Discord server dedicated to be, like, the
memberships stuff on YouTube.

905
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:42,360
So, it's more so of, like, and then there's the emotes
stuff.

906
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:44,760
You can use the emotes everywhere and stuff like that.

907
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:55,940
And it's more so of, like, obviously, when you're a YouTube
streamer, cater your, not cater, cultivate your membership

908
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:56,340
stuff.

909
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,340
Make it appealing.

910
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,200
Don't just have, like, nothing, really.

911
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:06,320
member streams every other week to have something and I have
like membership plans like exclusive membership stuff like

912
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:14,640
exclusive gaming sessions and exclusive like Minecraft
member server like stuff like that there's like exclusive

913
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:22,620
wallpapers that are being made um so that people want to
want to keep uh want to keep being a member so don't just

914
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:32,760
like make sure to have something there to make it worth
being a member as a twitch sub you don't really have like

915
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:40,440
twitch you don't really have like a like other than emotes
there's no like the twitch sub the appeal is the emotes it's

916
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:46,000
not like the like because you know youtube emotes you can't
use it you can only use it in one channel but twitch emotes

917
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,580
you can use it in every channel you can use it everywhere
that's the appeal uh if you're on a highly recommend if

918
01:42:52,580 --> 01:43:01,000
you're going to be a twitch streamer to have good emotes
because sometimes people subscribe to the emotes i've had

919
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:09,920
that happen before there's been multiple cases of people um
just subscribing on twitch because they just want to use

920
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:20,780
cool emotes if you want to appeal to have good subs to have
like more subs on twitch have nice quality emotes and make

921
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:25,060
sure they're like memorable or stuff like that like make
sure like people would want to have it like they don't care

922
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:34,200
about your content They just want to have good memos Like
Some people actually do it It was a huge thing A couple of

923
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:40,180
years ago There would be streamers That were known as like
Oh my god They're like the bear emotes I only want them for

924
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:46,880
the bear emotes Like that's it They were known for like
their emotes That was it And like people actually did that

925
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:55,000
People actually just subscribed To have good emotes And like
If you really want to like If you really want to like appeal

926
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:07,640
to like more people then do that it's fine it's just another
way to like have a more uh stable like uh i guess like

927
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:16,060
stable income um all right anyway i think is that everything
i have uh everything i have for youtube i think that's

928
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:20,000
everything i have for youtube versus twitch All right, the
algorithm.

929
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:21,320
Woo!

930
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,540
I love the algorithm.

931
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:25,720
Yay.

932
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,100
All right.

933
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:29,720
Algorithm.

934
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,380
So, shorts.

935
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:37,080
If you're on YouTube, milk the shit out of shorts.

936
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:43,280
Shorts are being heavily pushed by YouTube for a while now.

937
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,740
I thought they would stop, but they're still doing it
because they want to take over TikTok.

938
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:54,140
that you know take we might not even have tick tock anymore
so youtube is like we're gonna be the next tick tock so

939
01:44:54,140 --> 01:45:02,960
they're heavily pushing shorts at the moment um because of
that even streams by the way you might be seeing a lot of

940
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:09,080
people streaming shorts like like live streams in the shorts
category because like when you're browsing through like

941
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:16,540
short youtube shorts you can get like you like live streams
now too from like random people so like yeah a lot of

942
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:20,460
vertical streams It just shows up on your fucking algorithm.

943
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:21,640
It just shows up.

944
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:24,980
You just scroll through and then some streams show up too.

945
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:31,520
And it's really good for building the audience because
that's what the algorithm is pushing right now.

946
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,760
The meta is shorts.

947
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,800
Everybody just wants to watch on their phone.

948
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:43,020
Everyone just wants to watch on their phone now because I
don't know.

949
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:47,400
We just have very short attention spans these days.

950
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,140
We're not really helping ourselves.

951
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,680
Okay, but don't put all your eggs in that basket.

952
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:57,020
Because you can upload your shorts to TikTok and Instagram.

953
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:00,460
Apparently, Instagram reels are also blowing up now, too.

954
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:03,800
But, like, that's if you want to cater to the normies more.

955
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:11,760
Like, I would say, you can work on, like, Instagram reels.

956
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:16,160
If you really want to, like, cater more to, like, the
normies.

957
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,920
Because, like, all the normies are in Instagram.

958
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:25,400
now so i mean i think they're still using instagram i don't
know i haven't used instagram so fucking long uh but like uh

959
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:34,720
it's instagram reels um tick tock and youtube shorts there's
a lot of channels right now that are like one million to two

960
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:43,280
million like one million plus subscribers and all they do is
just shorts they don't don't upload any videos or like do

961
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:50,780
any live streams it's literally just shorts because that's
what youtube is pushing right now there's like i've seen i

962
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:58,220
was like watching looking at some of the channels that are
like um that are like they will upload videos but the videos

963
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:05,120
would have like 20k views or something but then the shorts
would be like 30 million and 40 million and they'll have

964
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:15,680
like 1 million plus subscribers it's because they only push
shorts I would highly suggest and highly recommend That you

965
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:20,340
do short You don't put everything on shorts You still stream

966
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:30,960
Just remember this stream Because you need to keep your
audience You stream and shorts You stream upload short What

967
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:40,360
I used to do Is that I would upload a short Every time I'm
not streaming Because like the YouTube algorithm so fucked

968
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:54,720
up that if you don't upload any of thing for a day they
would be like whoa that's a bad mark on your algorithm I'd

969
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:58,740
be like they'll be like you're not uploading now

970
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:13,040
so back then I would upload a short whenever I'm not
streaming because I would be like oh no now I can't keep up

971
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:19,780
the algorithm now I upload a short even if I'm streaming
because I want to keep a consistency because I'm just

972
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:26,580
starting out and right now I have like a huge boost in my
algorithm so I have to keep going and because of that I'm

973
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:34,220
keep going until like the algorithm boost has stagnated so
that is why I personally am uploading shorts even when I'm

974
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:36,700
streaming, I have three editors.

975
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:44,540
Each editor edits at least two shorts per week so I can keep
this consistent schedule.

976
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:48,640
That is because I am willing to, I have the money to invest
in it.

977
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,140
Obviously, not everybody has the money.

978
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:52,620
I have to edit it themselves and stuff like that.

979
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:56,580
I have three editors so they can, I don't want to overwork
one editor.

980
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:01,260
So I have three editors and I give them a chance to edit two
shorts per week.

981
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,660
If they don't want to do it, that is up to them.

982
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:11,740
they want to edit more that is up to them um but i i have i
let them because i don't want to overwork one editor so i

983
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:19,960
separate into three and i have a whole server set up for
them so that they they won't like overload each they won't

984
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:29,460
like overlap each other and that is why i can able to keep
the consistency of like having a short almost every day to

985
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:33,260
keep this algorithm boost because i have a fucking insane
algorithm boost right now.

986
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,160
Like I'm fucking everywhere apparently.

987
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:40,360
And that's what I mean when I said it's all about luck.

988
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:41,840
You can't just coast.

989
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:44,280
You have to know when you have the boost.

990
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:50,060
When you have the algorithm boost, you have to be consistent
regarding keeping this algorithm.

991
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:54,320
And that is why I've been trying to keep this algorithm up.

992
01:49:56,360 --> 01:50:00,480
And that is why I have three editors to keep this up.

993
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:07,860
Oh, but like I said, you might see a lot of people streaming
short section because, yeah, like I said, the stream will be

994
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:09,660
fed into the short scrollers.

995
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:12,260
That's why everybody's streaming in a vertical format.

996
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,260
In a vertical format now.

997
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:16,240
Also, we're doing shorts.

998
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:20,080
I remember I saw on Twitter, how do I pick the moments?

999
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:24,700
I let my editors pick the clips because if they see a
good...

1000
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:26,080
How did I find my editors?

1001
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,500
I hire clippers.

1002
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,680
That is why clipping is so good.

1003
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:40,880
get noticed as an editor as an editor or like if you want to
get jobs as an editor be a clipper clip some of your

1004
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:51,600
favorite vtubers clip some of your favorite content creators
because they know what's good content and that is why i

1005
01:50:51,600 --> 01:51:01,380
hired clippers because i hired some of these clippers some
of their videos I researched their videos and they have like

1006
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:08,460
millions they've got like millions of views on their videos
or like they got like 500k views on the videos that they've

1007
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:16,080
clipped themselves and then I was like and they would clip
me and I'd be like you're a good clipper I'm going to hire

1008
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:24,560
you um and that is how I found my clippers my editors I
basically if you really want to try and get your name out

1009
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:32,480
there just start clipping your favorite content creators
because that's how they research I don't normally pick like

1010
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:43,440
random editors I um I clip somebody that watches me because
they know what's a good content that I bring but if you

1011
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:56,800
can't afford to I highly suggest when you try we're like oh
but what if I'm making my own clips then um uh then look at

1012
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:05,920
your chat and see which part has the biggest fan response
like chat response because usually because there's like a

1013
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:11,080
there's like an analytic thing where you can see that so
like when you see an ally which one has the most like chat

1014
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:18,780
engagement that is usually where the best content is to clip
because people would be like oh like oh like a lot of

1015
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:19,800
chatters started

1016
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:29,320
moment that must have been a good part and then you watch it
back like oh that is a good part i'm gonna edit this myself

1017
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:36,260
um obviously learning to edit is like a skill i don't know
how to edit and that's why i pay people to do it i'm more of

1018
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:46,340
a producer i am a producer more so of of like um being able
to do like editing and stuff like that i have i'm an idea

1019
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:52,040
person um i i i am an idea person and I like to produce
things.

1020
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:56,900
editing is really hard.

1021
01:52:57,120 --> 01:53:02,140
I can't really give much advice regarding editing because,
uh, Addy, thank you for the super chat.

1022
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:02,360
Thank you.

1023
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:02,700
Thank you.

1024
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:03,840
Here's my tuition.

1025
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:04,540
Thank you.

1026
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:07,540
I can't really do much regarding giving advice on editing.

1027
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:11,120
So I really suggest, like, looking up, like, tutorials or,
like, asking around.

1028
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:19,700
Uh, but, like, anyway, so, like, that is basically how I go
about with clipping, with, like, editing and stuff.

1029
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:27,820
um there's another way to do like there's different types of
edits you can do right now since i am an indie i'm much more

1030
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:36,880
free to experiment with my editing um it's more so of like
so you see like back then it was just mostly clips and like

1031
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:45,100
animated clips now i'm more so experimenting with how my
shorts are done there's more so there's like story time

1032
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:55,720
stuff uh story time is very popular If you really want to
blow up with shorts, story time is the best way to go.

1033
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:59,860
Story time and anything to do with relatability is the way
to go.

1034
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:03,980
If you have a story, that shit will do so well.

1035
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:10,060
It's all about tangents, story time, and relatability with
the clips.

1036
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:13,780
And that is like the clips that would blow up the most with
grinding shorts.

1037
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:17,160
To blow up into like the normie spear.

1038
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:19,620
Like it goes beyond just V-tubing.

1039
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:29,260
um so people can be like she's just like me for real for
real if you look at my shorts my most popular shorts is the

1040
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:36,840
um it's the one where i bought the sticker and the waking up
stuff like i'll be like oh i sleep i wake up i eat breakfast

1041
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:47,880
i sleep and people be like oh my gosh she's so relatable
she's depressed i'm sorry i saw that so what if my comment

1042
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:51,380
was like oh my god She sleeps so much.

1043
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,420
She's so depressed.

1044
01:54:52,600 --> 01:55:02,100
It's so relatable I saw that I was like what the fuck anyway

1045
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:15,440
That was like one of the comments I thought But like as I
was saying there's a lot it's all about like or like

1046
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:21,820
something that's like so wrong like bait engagement or
something.

1047
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:26,260
Like, cause like, I'd be like, you know, like one was like,
my dream sponsor is a Funko Pop.

1048
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,860
And then I was like, yeah.

1049
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:31,680
And then obviously people in the comments would be like,
what the fuck?

1050
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:32,900
Why Funko?

1051
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:34,720
Why not a Nendoroid?

1052
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:36,000
And stuff like that.

1053
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:39,160
Because like, you know, that gives comments and likes.

1054
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:43,280
Also, it's still my dream sponsor because it's so fucking
funny.

1055
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:44,060
Okay.

1056
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:49,600
It's like the biggest endorsements you can get in the Normie
Spear.

1057
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:52,400
And you're supposed to break the normie's fear.

1058
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,760
It's so great idea.

1059
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:00,680
It's a great idea.

1060
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,780
Because people who don't know what the fuck you are will buy
Funko Pop.

1061
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:07,320
Because Funko Pop collectors will only...

1062
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,400
Don't give a fuck.

1063
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:09,760
They'll collect anything.

1064
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:11,900
They, like, just want to collect Funko.

1065
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,420
They, like, have such a community.

1066
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:16,220
Their community is all about collecting everything.

1067
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,780
It's, like, it's so...

1068
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:18,400
I don't know.

1069
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:27,040
And that's why I could be, like, vtuber in that fucking
collection it's just smart it's so fucking smart like anyway

1070
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:35,420
uh because like nendoid collectors nendoid collectors they
collect parts if you don't have a good part they don't care

1071
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:44,760
because nendoid collectors they're not here they're here to
make new net they just want to want the parts and the faces

1072
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:52,120
and stuff like that or like they're fans of the show like
there's but Nendroid collectors, like the hardcore

1073
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:57,300
collectors, they're not collecting the figures, they're
collecting the Nendroid parts.

1074
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:00,860
So they can mix and match.

1075
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:05,500
But Funko Pop collectors, they collect everything.

1076
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:13,920
They might be like, I don't know what that character is, but
I want it.

1077
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:25,080
But I also love a nendroid too because that's also a dream
because they look amazing i used to be i used to be an

1078
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:33,000
android collector not an android parts collector but like an
android collector like like like the not hardcore collector

1079
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:40,700
of nendroids i would buy nendroids because i'd be like oh i
like i'd buy nendroids because i'd be like oh i like this i

1080
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:48,000
like this um uh character i don't know what character this i
was like a funco pop version of an android collector because

1081
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:56,880
i bought like that i bought an a nendroid where like the
character was riding on a bird thing i don't know what the

1082
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:04,460
fuck who the fuck this character is i was like look at that
beautiful bird mount i want it

1083
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:15,240
i still don't know what character it is i still don't know i
just thought it was so cool because i was like i've never

1084
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:21,940
seen it before on a nendroid it was back then when like
nendroid have like those like second mount character things

1085
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:23,940
and i was like that's so cool

1086
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:34,550
no it wasn't final fantasy i have no idea anyway we're off
topic uh we're off topic right now

1087
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:47,180
okay anyway fomo games the fear of missing out streamer
games i already explained about that already.

1088
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:55,540
I already explained about like FOMO games, but it's, you
know, like I said, there's like, you don't want to miss out.

1089
01:58:55,740 --> 01:59:00,720
Lots of viewers don't want to miss out, so you have to play
them.

1090
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:02,460
Great examples.

1091
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,000
Chilla Arts games.

1092
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:13,300
So many VTubers play Chilla Arts games because Chilla Arts
is like the epiphany of FOMO.

1093
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:14,780
They don't want to miss out.

1094
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:16,480
Rage gaming, too.

1095
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:27,040
don't want to miss out because it's all reaction bating it's
there to bait reactions and they love making they love

1096
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:35,840
seeing the reactions of like the vtuber streaming this
particular section or this vtuber that's why horror games is

1097
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:44,080
so popular but you can't always do horror games Because if
you're always streaming horror games, then like, uh, then

1098
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:45,480
like people get tired.

1099
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:47,060
Unless that's your niche.

1100
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:52,020
But even if that is your niche, you still have to be able to
balance it out.

1101
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,480
Because people will just get, like, too much horror, you
know?

1102
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:59,560
It's just be like, it's just like, oh, she's just gonna
scream at that part.

1103
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,380
And then you're like, it's the same thing.

1104
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,080
Like, oh, she's just gonna get jump scare.

1105
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,540
It's just, you're just gonna get desensitized.

1106
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:08,240
It's why horror streamers are...

1107
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:09,380
Horror streamers were a niche.

1108
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,140
It was meta because people love watching streamers scream.

1109
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:14,980
But then the meta died.

1110
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:16,760
It's all about the stream meta.

1111
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:21,140
He used to say PewDiePie and Markiplier and Jacksepticeye.

1112
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:24,000
They all used to stream horror stuff.

1113
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:25,420
But now they don't.

1114
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:26,620
They don't stream that much.

1115
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:31,780
Like if you watch their streams, they like don't stream
horror that much anymore.

1116
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:33,440
Because the meta died out.

1117
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,040
They don't...

1118
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:35,500
It's not the meta anymore.

1119
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:41,180
PewDiePie is a great example of a content creator that knew
when to swap metas.

1120
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:52,380
Like, he swapped so many times with metas because he knew
what was going to be the next meta.

1121
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:54,720
He was like a reaction.

1122
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:59,860
He fucking swapped a reaction content because he knew that's
what people wanted to watch.

1123
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:05,440
And he was like, I would say like PewDiePie was one of the
first like starters.

1124
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:13,780
of like reaction content like the one of the biggest people
that like knew what like like that like pioneered reaction

1125
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:20,140
content because he knew that's what people wanted people
like reaction content that's what fucking rides the

1126
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:26,440
algorithm and then it got it turned into something i don't
know and he does like vlogging now because he's he's a dad

1127
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:37,900
now he's super chill he doesn't need to do anything he's
super fucking chill like he's a dad now he has so much money

1128
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:45,460
like he doesn't have to he just does it for fun he

1129
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:54,640
just does stuff for fun he doesn't have to care about the
meta anymore like he has the money to not care so like

1130
02:01:54,640 --> 02:02:03,800
that's like his plus side um and also comments and likes
commenting and liking is so beneficial it actually helps

1131
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:10,640
boost the algorithm so if you like this that's why people
like comment and comment and like this video.

1132
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:14,300
Um, I don't really say it because like, I don't know.

1133
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:15,940
I don't want, it feels too normy.

1134
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,760
I know it just feels too normy.

1135
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,820
But it actually helps a lot.

1136
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:23,740
It really does help the engagement.

1137
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:29,340
Like I could end up saying, I'll be like, hey, at the end of
the VOD, I could be like, make sure to comment, like and

1138
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:29,880
subscribe.

1139
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:33,020
But like, I don't do it because I'm lazy.

1140
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:36,860
Okay, to be fair, one of the main reasons why I don't do it
is because I'm fucking lazy.

1141
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:37,700
But also...

1142
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:47,780
it's a little cheesy and it's like super normy so that's why
that's why i don't really do it i don't tell people that

1143
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:56,420
comment like and subscribe but it helps if you want to help
like an indie vtuber or like an indie or like a small

1144
02:02:56,420 --> 02:03:03,480
streamer comment and like and subscribe like comment and
like their videos like all their fucking vods and all

1145
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:15,580
everything because it helps the algorithm a shit i don't
know why anyway so like i said follow the trends you guys

1146
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:23,520
know what the newest fucking weird ass trend is i'm not
doing it because it's like it's pretty fucked up i don't

1147
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:31,360
care that much i would follow like some trends if it seems
fun but i if it's like too much this is i just think it's

1148
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:41,100
just too much i don't um but like the newest trend right now
is the green screen trend And that is like where, because it

1149
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:42,480
like baits engagement.

1150
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:44,680
It baits like, whoa, shock factor.

1151
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:49,920
So like basically what they do is that there's a green
screen on their body.

1152
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:53,240
And then you have like the gameplay with on their body.

1153
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:56,620
So like that's the engagement bait.

1154
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:01,860
And yeah, that's like the current trend.

1155
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:04,580
It might change later, but that is the current trend.

1156
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:08,720
You can say the NPC thing was a trend as well.

1157
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:18,000
did you know 80% of my viewers are not subs did you guys
actually I think mine is like 20% I think 20% or like 10 to

1158
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:25,580
20% my viewers are not subscribed so like I think that one
was mine um but yeah anyway thank you the super chat thank

1159
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:35,220
you thank you spirit um um but the NPC stream is also a
trend it's a trend so you follow trends obviously it baits

1160
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:42,680
engagement and it baits like uh like a shock like oh that's
something new oh my god they're doing something new i like

1161
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:48,980
you're doing something funny something new oh my god ha ha
like stuff like that just follow trends and then songs songs

1162
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:59,880
are really really good like if your cover song hits like a
million views whoa good for you congratulations it means you

1163
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:05,460
have done really well it's really good because people some
people will subscribe to you because they really like your

1164
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:09,860
singing like you they will put it on your playlist.

1165
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:10,900
Also Spotify.

1166
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:13,080
You can make so much money on Spotify.

1167
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:15,080
If you just upload your song on Spotify.

1168
02:05:15,660 --> 02:05:17,620
I would heavily suggest if you have a fan base.

1169
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:22,060
If you're starting a fan base as a singer or an Utaite or
Utaite.

1170
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:25,400
You start uploading things on Spotify.

1171
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:35,800
You can actually make a lot of money from Spotify if you
have enough songs or if you have enough exposure because

1172
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:45,500
people will put it on repeat and like songs on Spotify on
repeat does make a decent amount of money and it's only uh

1173
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:52,280
uh it's only like I know some people were like oh there's
like big streamers but you have to remember a lot of the

1174
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:59,280
bigger streamers have other companies taking the cut of
those streams like the like big singers like the like the

1175
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:04,700
what was it the billboard singers you know like like I'm
trying to think like if we talk about Taylor Swift's old

1176
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:11,980
management company Taylor Swift if you guys don't know why
Taylor Swift is re-releasing her album.

1177
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:20,860
It is because, uh, if she, the reason why, uh, Taylor Swift
is re-releasing her album is because her old album, um, is

1178
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:31,900
owned by her old music label, and her old music label is,
um, is like, uh, uh, basically owns that song.

1179
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:40,240
And because of that, she barely earns money from those old
her old music so like that's why you see like oh but all the

1180
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:47,440
big music stars they don't earn that much but when you're
smaller music singer you actually earn a pretty decent

1181
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:54,480
amount on spotify uh but you have to remember it's better if
you make original songs versus like cover songs to upload on

1182
02:06:54,480 --> 02:07:01,940
spotify because obviously a lot of artists might not let you
upload cover songs on spotify but you gotta have permission

1183
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:09,480
from the artist to be so like it's better to if you have
original songs it actually can actually like make back your

1184
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:21,480
money type deal on spotify because like it actually is very
uh beneficial to you as uh grow to grow as a singer um and

1185
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:32,480
uh so like if you're a singer fucking do covers do so do as
many covers as you can original songs if you're a really

1186
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:39,000
talented singer or if you're just just do it because it's so
good for your growth it is real it's just a lot of money

1187
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:47,640
invested but if you want to market yourself as a singer this
is the way you have to go um this is the way you have to go

1188
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:56,460
you have to you want to market yourself as that uh if singer
then sing exactly exactly uh so like a lot of people that

1189
02:07:56,460 --> 02:08:04,020
subscribe for like singers they just want to hear the songs
too so you have to be aware though that a lot of people that

1190
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:11,160
subscribe to singers like singer vtubers they're just they
they listen to the songs they're just here to listen to the

1191
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:17,560
song and they like put it on repeat over and over and over
and over again um but a lot of but then there's a lot of

1192
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:25,480
vtubers that got big from singing cover songs and it's good
exposure if you have good cover songs there's so many like

1193
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:35,920
amazing cover song singers that like um i love to listen to
that are that are like big big vtubers now like amalie i

1194
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:43,260
have i used to have i have so many of her covers on my
playlist before like she became a vtuber before i became a

1195
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:49,640
vtuber i would listen to her songs all the time on my
playlist because i loved cover songs in general i had so

1196
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:57,860
many like i would primarily just listen to cover singers
because i i personally liked cover singers more than the

1197
02:08:57,860 --> 02:09:08,020
original and there's like so many of that in my playlist uh
but yeah like i said just make songs all right branding okay

1198
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:19,360
this is like that's really very like in like a simple slide
i feel like this slide in general there's not really like

1199
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:21,800
much to say about it but like

1200
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:38,500
100% this is what I believe it this is 100% what I believe
it if you choose if you are an animal VTuber is the easiest

1201
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:49,480
when it comes to branding because like animal VTubers are
like more recognizable than a human I would say that because

1202
02:09:49,480 --> 02:10:00,180
like there's like traits in there that are um that that are
there that makes you distinct from like uh from like

1203
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:08,120
different other vtubers like you have like animal
characteristics all the more more famous vtubers have like

1204
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:14,220
some animal characteristic about them because you can do
many things about it you can like make them as like you know

1205
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:22,100
their alternate form is the animal itself or like you can
make like merch wise stuff merch merch and everything it's

1206
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:29,880
like so good like regarding that and there's so many cat
girls out there so like you have to be like what makes you

1207
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:36,320
more distinct from all the other cat girls you know you have
to have something that makes you more distinct than the

1208
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:42,880
other cat girls you have to have like a a design trait a
unique silhouette but you can't have too unique of a

1209
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:51,860
silhouette because people don't like it when it's too
fucking complicated um um and then an average viewer needs

1210
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:58,920
to be able to pick you out very easily so branding is so
very important this is why i've been like i think i i don't

1211
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:12,740
know i'm fucking i don't know what i'm gonna be doing for my
skin suit i don't know man that's how i feel at the moment

1212
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:16,940
but my my new skin suit i don't know

1213
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:32,220
I just hope like my it works I hope it works it was so hard
figuring out branding but like it's so important because

1214
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:39,960
like merch and stuff too if you want okay long term branding
I would say long term branding because like I know there's a

1215
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:48,160
lot of YouTubers that like swap models or change their
branding and stuff like that um but like if you want if you

1216
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:57,340
like uh if you want to be more safe you keep the same brand
I say that as I'm getting a new skin suit but this like this

1217
02:11:57,340 --> 02:12:10,000
brand is like really old so like I have an excuse to upgrade
I technically I sort of have an excuse to upgrade my

1218
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:18,860
branding because like this this skin suit is very old to be
fair my original branding is a tomato so like um it still

1219
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:29,620
works But like, anyway, I would, to make it more simple and
to make it like more, I guess like easier for you, um, if

1220
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:42,180
you already have a noticeable brand, I would suggest highly
to keep the same brand because it's such a huge, that's why

1221
02:12:42,180 --> 02:12:42,820
I'm scared.

1222
02:12:44,020 --> 02:12:49,400
This is, this is why I'm personally scared with my new skin
suit.

1223
02:12:49,420 --> 02:13:00,420
because um when you when you change brands you don't know if
people are gonna stay because maybe your old brand was like

1224
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:10,140
very already very recognizable and people hate change people
really hate change and it also helps for the normie sphere

1225
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:13,480
like average viewers outside of your community

1226
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:26,000
of your community that's like what's worrying because it's
like oh you don't you when you see them you're like who is

1227
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,660
that you're like oh it's that person but they used to be
this other person why do they look different now like stuff

1228
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:40,640
like that marketing wise marketing wise and like uh uh
branding wise keeping the same one i mean if you swap

1229
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:48,580
outfits that's fine but i meant like a full revamp is like
that's why like companies keep the same brand because

1230
02:13:48,580 --> 02:13:54,740
consistency always is good because if you have some you see
that thing and you're like oh i recognize them is this

1231
02:13:54,740 --> 02:14:04,260
person um so so that's why like a lot of that's why like in
companies people keep the same brand um and i would think

1232
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:10,480
like if you want to keep the same brand for your future you
stay the same brand like i know like maybe you're like oh

1233
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:20,160
but i want to be this next but like to if you want to play
it very safe um if you want to keep it very safe And you

1234
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:21,280
don't want to take risk.

1235
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:23,400
This is like the best way to do it.

1236
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:25,220
Like this is the best way.

1237
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,500
Like if you don't want to take any risk.

1238
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:30,340
And like you don't know if the viewership will stay the
same.

1239
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:31,120
Like type deal.

1240
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:36,120
Management and organization.

1241
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:37,400
All right.

1242
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:41,360
Don't just hire anybody to be a manager.

1243
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:45,580
It's so fucking stressful if you have the bad manager.

1244
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:47,800
If you have like not a great manager.

1245
02:14:49,420 --> 02:15:01,660
somebody do not hire close friends never mix business and
relationships together it's never good I I would highly

1246
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:13,240
highly suggest you do not hire close friends or any friend
like like oh my god do not hire close friends okay guys

1247
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:22,980
don't mix it's always a rule to never mix business with
relations it's not great if you have the opportunity to hire

1248
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:31,340
a manager just don't do that hire somebody look into someone
with actual business experience this is when you're getting

1249
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:39,220
bigger as an indie obviously when you start out you don't
have managers you do this all yourself and so you have to if

1250
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:41,700
you're starting out be sure to know how to

1251
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:52,640
you're negotiating and don't let people like say like like
if you don't get like scammed into like signing a very

1252
02:15:52,640 --> 02:16:01,600
predatory contract when it comes to like sponsors and deals
because there's a lot of them out there so like you know you

1253
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:09,260
want to do like a brand deal or a sponsor you have to be
sure you sign something that you really want to do and you

1254
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:11,960
don't get like sucked into a

1255
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:24,800
in terms of like like sponsors or merch and stuff like that
and that's like as an indie as an indie you there's like a

1256
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:30,620
lot of those as an indie so like you have to be able to be
able to read these types of contracts if you don't have a

1257
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:38,640
manager because but that is why you also get a manager to
avoid these things a lot of emails that come to me regarding

1258
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:41,440
like opportunities and stuff my

1259
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:55,180
sure that like before they before they the emails get to me
it gets like pre-reg by my management team so like i don't

1260
02:16:55,180 --> 02:17:06,000
have to deal with the bad ones so i can just say yes or no
on the good ones already that i get like um but yes get a

1261
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:11,440
business lawyer if you want to be more serious get a
business lawyer yeah they get screened the emails get

1262
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:21,860
screened so i'm sure that like i will not be that are like
predatory um but yeah anyway but yes get a business lawyer

1263
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:31,460
to look through the contract to make sure everything is okay
um have a business email and put it on your twitter bio and

1264
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:39,680
stream streamer platform don't think it's just gonna walk to
you have a business email out there very direct it's there

1265
02:17:39,680 --> 02:17:49,380
so you can get the emails instantly so like and also um make
sure the business email is like a little bit professional

1266
02:17:54,540 --> 02:18:04,100
yeah just a little bit professional i mean mine's doki can
read but it's also yeah that's stuff but also like um have a

1267
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:11,760
pitch deck made i think it's a very good investment if you
want to chase sponsors if you want to like have sponsors

1268
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:21,380
like um if you want to like approach sponsors and brand
deals have your own like portfolio and pitch deck made so

1269
02:18:21,380 --> 02:18:27,440
like when you send it to them like they can just see your
analytics and everything so like just make sure you have

1270
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:33,220
those together also i saw like some people asking me like oh
what about like projects when you're organizing your project

1271
02:18:33,220 --> 02:18:40,200
and stuff like that like i talked about this earlier but
like um there's not really a host way.

1272
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:41,540
I really do it.

1273
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:42,680
That's like special.

1274
02:18:43,580 --> 02:18:48,540
At best, I have a lot of multiple projects going on and
stuff.

1275
02:18:49,320 --> 02:19:04,760
So I, because I have the opportunity to host and produce a
lot of projects, I, um, I am able to, uh, delegate a project

1276
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:07,520
leader that runs the project.

1277
02:19:08,460 --> 02:19:17,320
mostly like the project leader will talk to me about what's
going on and then I also look into the server to see like

1278
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:24,180
what's going on as well I look into the server and be like
okay seems like everything is going well but then the

1279
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:29,240
project leader will be responsible with making sure
everything goes on track everything is on track and

1280
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:38,300
everything is like going well they obviously get paid more
because they're the project leader also like the way is I

1281
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:39,100
give updates.

1282
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:41,360
I give server updates and be like, oh, here's the news.

1283
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:42,520
What's going to happen?

1284
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:44,280
And like, here are the new requirements.

1285
02:19:44,420 --> 02:19:45,180
Here's what I need.

1286
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:46,360
Like, I would give updates.

1287
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:50,480
But the project leader makes sure everything goes well and
keeps on track.

1288
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:55,260
Also, please don't rely on Twitter DMs or Discord DMs.

1289
02:19:55,480 --> 02:19:57,440
Make a Discord server if you're doing a project.

1290
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:04,880
You have to have, make sure everything, because like, oh my
God, it's so confusing when you have so many DMs everywhere.

1291
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:07,240
Have a Discord server.

1292
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:09,880
So you can keep track of everything.

1293
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:12,500
I will show you an example of my Discord servers.

1294
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:14,120
Bam!

1295
02:20:14,620 --> 02:20:15,360
Here you go.

1296
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:18,440
This is how my Discord server goes.

1297
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:22,340
On the left is me and my management team.

1298
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:25,060
On the right is my editing team.

1299
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:26,740
And animators.

1300
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:28,140
I also have animators too.

1301
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:31,020
So this is how I organize my Discord server.

1302
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:34,760
This is how the Discord server is done.

1303
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:37,880
So you see, like, here are all the important things that I
have.

1304
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:44,180
and then on the right you can see like oh hey for editing
here are the rules here's my editing rules what I want the

1305
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:51,280
clips to have um the general stuff for people want to talk
in general assets that I give them regarding like PNGs stuff

1306
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:57,100
like that time stamp claims so the editors won't fucking
like overlap each other with time stamps like if they're

1307
02:20:57,100 --> 02:21:04,800
clipping something for clip downloads so like when they're
finished with a clip they just plop the links there They

1308
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:07,280
just plop the links there for me to download.

1309
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:10,980
And then if they have any editing thing they need to ask,
they just put it there.

1310
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:14,440
And then I have private channels with each individual
editor.

1311
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:21,580
So if they want to ask me anything privately, that's not
within like other, if other people, they don't want other

1312
02:21:21,580 --> 02:21:26,040
people to see, they talk to me in the private chat.

1313
02:21:27,300 --> 02:21:39,540
Everything is in, like, is organized in a way so that, um,
organized in a way so that like uh uh in the like it's just

1314
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:50,720
automated type deal it's just very organized and like i know
where things are and and that's how i organize my stuff

1315
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:58,720
because i just need to be sure that everything is in a way
so i can easily like look at it so like especially like

1316
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:06,560
payment i tell them to tell me about payment in our private
channels instead their discord messages like instead of

1317
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:14,940
discord dms because i can there's so many people i'm
managing or like working with that like i would get so many

1318
02:22:14,940 --> 02:22:20,920
dms like discord dms and i have to talk like socialize with
other people as well in discord dms so because of that i do

1319
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:27,640
everything on servers if it's a project or if it's like um
if something's going on i do everything in the server so i

1320
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:32,360
can i don't have to like discord search bar is so hard like

1321
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:40,140
it is it's just better this way

1322
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:50,380
shout out to like my management team to helping with the
organization of the server itself because like um it was not

1323
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:56,560
this neat before I gave like a general template on how I
want the server to be like and then they made it more

1324
02:22:56,560 --> 02:23:06,820
organized so this is the left side is where me and my
management team live the right side is the editing team um

1325
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:19,240
editing and animators the i combine the doki bites animators
into the same um into the same discord server so like uh so

1326
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:27,100
like i don't have to like worry about uh about like more
than one so like also the editors and the animators don't

1327
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:32,920
overlap each other in terms of clip moments Because I have a
rule, and I said that, I told them, for the animators and

1328
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:36,480
editing team, I do not want repeats.

1329
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:38,180
I don't want repeats.

1330
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:45,760
So, like, the animator and the editor teams have to be sure
they don't animate or clip the same thing.

1331
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:47,560
And that's why I combined them together.

1332
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:49,660
So, yeah.

1333
02:23:49,860 --> 02:23:51,940
So that is how, like, everything is done.

1334
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:58,240
The reason we're not using Slack is because we can't be
bothered.

1335
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:04,900
That is why me and my manager team are not using Slack.

1336
02:24:05,460 --> 02:24:06,400
We can't be bothered.

1337
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:07,840
So we're using Discord.

1338
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:14,680
Alright.

1339
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:18,340
General tips I've tried to follow.

1340
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:20,380
These are my own way of streaming.

1341
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:24,820
This is how I go about in terms of my own way of streaming.

1342
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:31,600
First off, I saw like people were saying like, Oh, how do
you, like, deal with...

1343
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:38,260
How do you deal with, like, losing topics and stuff?

1344
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:42,480
Like, like, topics and stuff, like, dead air.

1345
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:45,860
I actually keep a list of topics I want to talk about on
stream.

1346
02:24:46,460 --> 02:24:52,580
Every time I think of something I want to talk about, like,
if I have dead air?

1347
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:55,840
If I think I have dead, I'm going to have dead air.

1348
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:07,880
type random topics throughout the day and then i would just
pull that up if i have to i don't use it all the time i

1349
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:13,700
don't use it all the time it's if i think i have dead air if
i don't know what i'm going to talk about i would just pull

1350
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:20,040
it up and be like oh yeah i'll be like oh my god guys i just
remembered did you guys know blah blah blah blah like that's

1351
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:26,520
really it but i don't do that all the time i don't do that
all the time i do it like maybe like once every two to three

1352
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:35,520
weeks because i'm like back then when i was first starting
out i when i first starting out and i was not very good at

1353
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:43,580
tangents and like in terms of like i don't know what to talk
about and i would make sure i write stuff down so i would i

1354
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:49,720
would write bullet points so i would write bear hibernation
stuff like that just to make sure i remember so like i would

1355
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:55,800
just write one bullet point and then i'll be like i remember
exactly the topic i'll be like oh yeah you know stuff like

1356
02:25:55,800 --> 02:26:03,740
that um but it's basically and like are not very good at
talking and it's because i'm so used to talking now that

1357
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:14,340
like um i don't really use it anymore but i still put it i
write it down out of habit habit habit if you are a variety

1358
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:24,160
streamer this is what i do this is my own personal opinion i
tend to keep long playthroughs three to four streams max

1359
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:32,220
because the longer the series the less viewership is going
to get which is because our attention is really fucked now

1360
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:42,900
this is where you're a YouTuber if you're a Twitch streamer
it's different if you're a Twitch streamer it's like really

1361
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:51,500
different because like you know like I said before like
people don't know when you're going to stream whatever so

1362
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:57,000
they always show up and they'll be like oh where are we
going to get today but if you're a YouTube streamer I

1363
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:06,580
usually keep it three to four streams Just because like I
know by time it hits the fourth stream Like the viewership

1364
02:27:06,580 --> 02:27:13,220
will decline even harder It's just gonna go lower and lower
and lower So like that is why I try to keep it three to four

1365
02:27:13,220 --> 02:27:23,900
streams Um so it's just so it's just to keep the attention
span like Like still like there regarding it This is what I

1366
02:27:23,900 --> 02:27:34,820
do like I said personal experience you want to work with
artists that are not english-speaking get a translator i've

1367
02:27:34,820 --> 02:27:43,380
had this experience before i wanted to work with an artist
that didn't speak english and i wrote in english but i also

1368
02:27:43,380 --> 02:27:50,300
wrote my translated like my translation as well but then
they were like oh sorry we don't want to we only work with

1369
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:56,660
people who speak it native like fluently because they didn't
want to deal with like issues if you didn't like the art and

1370
02:27:56,660 --> 02:28:01,620
then like they don't understand what you want changed and
stuff and the chat there's like translation issues and stuff

1371
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:10,940
like that deep l is your friend if you want to how you
actually use a translator but i would highly suggest talking

1372
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:22,360
with a translator getting an actual translator that's fluent
in the language or or use deep L but let the artist know

1373
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:29,000
that you're using a translation software because you don't
want to like you know lie and be like I'm actually fluent or

1374
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,340
you're using a translation like tool

1375
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:45,780
but yes I highly suggest getting a translator to help you it
is much better in the long run and it's a lot more

1376
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:49,080
convenient for you to get what you want.

1377
02:28:50,580 --> 02:28:52,780
Have a consistent time block.

1378
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:54,880
People love consistency.

1379
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:58,120
People love you being consistent.

1380
02:28:59,400 --> 02:29:01,560
That is why I have two set time blocks.

1381
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:03,440
1230 p.m.

1382
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:05,280
PST and 5 p.m.

1383
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:05,720
PST.

1384
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:07,100
That is my time block.

1385
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:08,540
And that's what people know.

1386
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:11,140
People know that you stream around those time.

1387
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:12,640
Consistency is key.

1388
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:18,580
always have a dedicated time block for whatever you stream
don't stream random hours all the time because you don't

1389
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:25,400
your audience will not know what to do they'll be like what
the fuck what time do i show up i don't know they're always

1390
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:32,760
different get a consistent time block even on twitch you
still the thing about twitch is that even they don't have a

1391
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:44,080
set a set plan they are consistent with what time they
stream at so like always be consistent it's always the key

1392
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:59,000
have mods don't self moderate it's not great and have them
be like mostly silent but like not too sad like it's like if

1393
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:05,400
they want to interject they can but like the thing is we
don't want a mod to spam the chat just be like The thing is,

1394
02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:11,060
my mods, I have three mods working in this chat.

1395
02:30:13,320 --> 02:30:15,420
And like, they all have second accounts.

1396
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:19,860
Their mod account is actually their second account.

1397
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:28,140
So like, their mod, the real mods, the real, their real
accounts is among you.

1398
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:33,180
It could be any of you guys.

1399
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:39,400
So they don't have to, they don't, like, have to worry.

1400
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:42,400
They don't, they can, like, actually talk to you guys.

1401
02:30:45,820 --> 02:30:48,240
It could be any of you guys.

1402
02:30:48,660 --> 02:30:55,760
So they have two accounts, one for moderating and one to
chat, like, be just like a regular dragoon.

1403
02:30:59,140 --> 02:31:00,600
I'm the mod smile.

1404
02:31:02,100 --> 02:31:02,820
Message receipt.

1405
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:04,420
Have all your mods be...

1406
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:13,320
silently i'm thinking of the super chat thank you thank you
but yes i have them mostly silent because i don't want to

1407
02:31:13,320 --> 02:31:24,100
cause any issues and that is why they're mostly silent um uh
also please make a business paypal and set up a business

1408
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:31,560
account long run if you want to make this a long-term career
it would be so good for you just remember that please

1409
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:38,180
remember to set everything up as a business because this is
your career now if this is what you want to do as a career

1410
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:52,460
so uh so yeah anyway that's like basically one of my general
tips to follow when you want to if you want to like you want

1411
02:31:52,460 --> 02:31:56,140
to see what's going on behind my fucking brain all right
merch

1412
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:11,060
say merch I did not realize how much merch matters until
recently and like for an indie and it's like a lot of income

1413
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:26,660
can come from merch and um and basically I if you want to do
your own merch if you want to handle the whole merch

1414
02:32:26,660 --> 02:32:37,020
yourself and not want to look at distributors Alibaba is
your friend Alibaba is a great website to look for

1415
02:32:37,020 --> 02:32:46,340
manufacturers it is a good manufacturer website the thing is
when you're looking and when you're researching

1416
02:32:46,340 --> 02:33:01,300
manufacturers yourself you have to research the samples and
you have to look at like samples and like uh uh what else is

1417
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:10,160
there and uh fuck okay I don't remember okay and you have to
like get like samples made and all that stuff too um there's

1418
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:17,480
other manufacturer websites to look at there's a lot of them
and there's like ones in like America and stuff like that

1419
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:28,780
ones in like Canada some in Japan and stuff like that a lot
of them are like on websites uh similar to like uh uh

1420
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:40,800
different type there's like lots of websites for this too um
and the thing is um it's really hard to find a manufacturer

1421
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:49,040
that you want to work with because you have to look at
sample size you have to look at samples and like make sure

1422
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:58,900
you're not getting scammed of course not getting scammed and
the quality is what you want obviously the more you pay for

1423
02:33:58,900 --> 02:34:06,400
a manufacturer the more expensive the more expensive things
are going to get to be made and the more expensive things

1424
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:19,360
are going to get to be sold but the quality is a lot better
so you have to be able to pick and choose you have to be

1425
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:31,080
able to make sure that is what you want to work with anyway
making your own merch I was very luckily, I was a artist

1426
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:31,380
alley.

1427
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:33,400
I did artist alley a lot.

1428
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:37,680
And I sold art at conventions.

1429
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:41,120
So there's a lot of things you can do to make your own
merch.

1430
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:41,940
Yay!

1431
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:49,380
Like, these are things you can do yourself.

1432
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:51,340
You don't have to get a manufacturer.

1433
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:54,320
You can just do this yourself as a smaller indie.

1434
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:59,280
You can just do this yourself as a smaller indie and still
have merch for your fans.

1435
02:35:00,740 --> 02:35:06,960
Button makers, they are $150 to $300 US dollars, including
the materials.

1436
02:35:08,660 --> 02:35:10,760
So like, it's just a button press.

1437
02:35:10,940 --> 02:35:12,260
You boom, boom, boom, bam.

1438
02:35:12,540 --> 02:35:18,820
You print out the artwork you want to make into a button,
and then you commission an artist to make a button design,

1439
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:20,440
and then you print it out.

1440
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:21,320
That's it.

1441
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:24,220
And then you fucking boom, boom, boom, bam.

1442
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:24,880
Done.

1443
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:26,860
And that's how you make a button.

1444
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:35,440
You install them for like two to three two to four dollars
depending on how big the button is and then gradually you

1445
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:46,860
can make the investment back printing your own stickers
sticker paper that's a thing sticker papers are a thing or

1446
02:35:46,860 --> 02:35:55,100
you can fucking there's like local printing shops that make
stickers that you can just like you know order online or

1447
02:35:55,100 --> 02:36:01,200
order like from a shop from mom-and-pop shop or like i don't
know walmart

1448
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:12,480
i used to cut my own stickers when i first started out in
artist alley and i still made money from that and they're

1449
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:22,900
good and they're they make money and then printing your own
poster cards and prints at a local store that works you

1450
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:30,920
don't have to worry it's like that you can do that as your
own merch Anyway, if you're going to work with distributors,

1451
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:34,920
obviously they're going to take a cut of your money because
you're working with them.

1452
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:44,180
They're going to be like doing the whole thing for you, like
the researching manufacturers, you know, researching

1453
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:49,360
manufacturers and making sure like the quality and stuff
like that.

1454
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:53,260
But you got to research and read the contract very
thoroughly.

1455
02:36:53,260 --> 02:37:01,840
I would highly suggest not going with one that's a startup
because for distributors and ones that have experience

1456
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:14,280
distributing stuff because it's out of your hands because
you're not part of the process and honestly it's better to

1457
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:21,040
work with somebody that has experience distributing stuff
because shipping things is a lot of work it's like I've done

1458
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:25,160
shipping I ship stuff myself And, like, it's a lot of work.

1459
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:27,800
And, like, it's not that easy.

1460
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:30,260
I run my own.

1461
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:34,420
I run my own thing all by myself.

1462
02:37:35,080 --> 02:37:37,020
It doesn't mean I'm going to do that forever, though.

1463
02:37:37,300 --> 02:37:37,940
It doesn't mean.

1464
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:45,560
And I'm not, and I'm, like, very open to, like, maybe if I
find a distributor, I'd like, I can give them a percentage

1465
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:45,780
cut.

1466
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:49,300
I do it myself because I want to keep majority of the
earnings.

1467
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:52,080
Because I know how to do it.

1468
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:59,740
and I have experience doing it and that is why I handle I
handle like everything myself regarding merch and I know

1469
02:37:59,740 --> 02:38:07,000
other VTubers that do it as well not just me because I've
talked to I recently was talking to somebody regarding merch

1470
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:14,380
stuff because we were like exchanging our company our like
manufacturers we were exchanging like info with each other

1471
02:38:14,380 --> 02:38:23,760
and stuff regarding like manufacturers and like oh like
What's the word?

1472
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:25,380
Oh, fuck.

1473
02:38:28,660 --> 02:38:31,880
Just being like, oh yeah, like you do, you produce that.

1474
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:32,720
I produce this.

1475
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:34,660
Well, I want to try producing this later, too.

1476
02:38:34,980 --> 02:38:39,440
So then we were exchanging information with each other so we
can build up our knowledge and stuff.

1477
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:41,980
So that's like, that's a good thing.

1478
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:48,640
If you have like friends with somebody that also makes
merch, talk to them about it and like, like exchange

1479
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:50,120
information with each other.

1480
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:58,640
information I like be like oh yeah I'm planning on doing
this like oh where are you gonna be doing and stuff like

1481
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:08,700
that and be like oh yeah I'm more look for a manufacturer
that does this as well and stuff like that um so that's what

1482
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:20,040
um that's what I try to do I realize I realize I forgot a
slide so uh let me download this slide they're all PNGs and

1483
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:27,940
so let me I realize I forgot um a slide real quick because
that sort of fits the topic that I want to talk about let me

1484
02:39:27,940 --> 02:39:33,160
add this in but this one is about networking and
collaboration because like the other stuff will not be as a

1485
02:39:33,160 --> 02:39:43,120
knowledge I wouldn't make sense if I go down there so let me
add that slide real quick add files where did I download it

1486
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:51,960
okay let's see I think it's I think it's this is this collab
and networking I think this is all right all right let me

1487
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:54,840
Let me push this lad up higher.

1488
02:39:57,380 --> 02:39:59,700
All right, networking and collabs.

1489
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:00,740
There we go.

1490
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:04,820
All right, networking and collabs.

1491
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:06,380
Balance your schedule.

1492
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:07,940
I talked about this before.

1493
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:11,680
But please, do not make it mostly collabs.

1494
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:16,440
It should be, collab streams should not be more than solo
streams.

1495
02:40:17,140 --> 02:40:23,780
Because if you spend too many collabs per week, especially
when you're just starting out, then you're not building a

1496
02:40:23,780 --> 02:40:33,440
fan base and community that's and the community that's there
for you you want to have viewers that want to watch you so

1497
02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:41,340
you don't want to just have mostly collabs because people
would be like oh I want to watch them interact with this

1498
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:48,980
streamer instead instead of actually like watching for you
so you have to have a healthy balance I do one to two

1499
02:40:48,980 --> 02:40:53,880
collabs per week Because if I have lots of collabs going on,
I also try to balance it more with solo streams.

1500
02:40:56,300 --> 02:41:00,360
Because I know my dragoons, they also want some personal
dragoon time.

1501
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:02,580
They want me to interact with the chat.

1502
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:05,900
And that's why, like, they want to have an identity.

1503
02:41:06,220 --> 02:41:07,880
You don't want to be the collaborer.

1504
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:11,160
Like, you don't want that to be your identity.

1505
02:41:11,440 --> 02:41:12,120
You just collab.

1506
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:13,300
You don't have solo content.

1507
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:17,260
You want to have personal content so people will know your
personality.

1508
02:41:22,650 --> 02:41:24,270
don't rely too much on collabs.

1509
02:41:25,590 --> 02:41:31,030
Like I said, if you're relying too much on collabs, you're
basically like giving yourself a crutch and you have a

1510
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:33,470
harder time developing your personality and presence.

1511
02:41:34,210 --> 02:41:40,690
It also has if you're on YouTube, it like gives more
opportunities for like dead subs and followers and stuff and

1512
02:41:40,690 --> 02:41:41,270
you don't want that.

1513
02:41:41,350 --> 02:41:43,850
You don't want people to just follow you because you collab
with this one person.

1514
02:41:44,270 --> 02:41:51,070
You want them to follow you because they enjoyed that
experience and they want to watch more of you.

1515
02:41:51,810 --> 02:41:57,850
This is why a lot of like collab channels die so fast
there's a okay you can look at this example with flesh

1516
02:41:57,850 --> 02:42:06,970
tubers a lot of flesh tubers they like uh become big because
of the group they are with because they have like a youtube

1517
02:42:06,970 --> 02:42:14,710
group but as soon as that youtube group falls apart their
channel dies because the viewers they only want to watch

1518
02:42:14,710 --> 02:42:19,470
that stream that channel for the group they are in not
because of the people they are.

1519
02:42:20,090 --> 02:42:22,310
They're like, oh, my friend group experience.

1520
02:42:22,570 --> 02:42:25,050
No, like, that shit sucks.

1521
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:31,830
Because they're like, no, I watched you because I wanted to
have the friend group experience so I can live vicariously

1522
02:42:31,830 --> 02:42:33,250
through this friend group.

1523
02:42:33,750 --> 02:42:38,310
And then now that you don't have that friend group, it's not
as fun.

1524
02:42:39,730 --> 02:42:41,450
I used to watch the creatures.

1525
02:42:42,230 --> 02:42:44,450
I live vicariously through the creatures.

1526
02:42:49,350 --> 02:42:57,110
and like that's the thing especially like when they started
going their separate ways they didn't have really an

1527
02:42:57,110 --> 02:43:05,690
identity beyond that they didn't have the identity like it
was just like it was literally like the friend group was

1528
02:43:05,690 --> 02:43:11,970
gone but you know there's like so many experience you can
fucking look at Minecraft and like uh what's the quibble

1529
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:12,730
quap or whatever

1530
02:43:18,490 --> 02:43:28,930
like shit like that like you can't be just the friend group
you have to be your own individual um all right how to be

1531
02:43:28,930 --> 02:43:37,930
good at collapse this is my my opinion but there's two roles
in a collab this is how i see it the support and the leader

1532
02:43:37,930 --> 02:43:45,830
so the support is obviously like you look at it as a comedy
duo but it can be like a group thing too so so you can have

1533
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:59,150
the straight man and the leader or like the the dumb one or
the chaotic one or the one with the comedy you need someone

1534
02:43:59,150 --> 02:44:11,630
to react and the other one to be there someone to bring
their reaction and stuff um and so or you can be skills you

1535
02:44:11,630 --> 02:44:22,290
can have is to be both of them and i think i personally i
can be both i can be a reactor if i'm in a group that's way

1536
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:30,250
too chaotic i can be the straight man if i need it to be i
can be the reactor like the one that tries to be like the

1537
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:39,890
sane one in the group like it is possible if you can have
the skill set to be both you are you can be a really good

1538
02:44:39,890 --> 02:44:52,930
content creator because you're not locked into you're not
locked into a group in a way you're not locked into certain

1539
02:44:52,930 --> 02:45:01,530
people you can collab with and that is what makes a very
strong collab so you don't want a whole group filled with

1540
02:45:01,530 --> 02:45:07,290
supporters like you know all the people who can only do
support you don't want a full group of chaotic people

1541
02:45:07,290 --> 02:45:12,530
because it will be way too much able to have a healthy
balance.

1542
02:45:13,070 --> 02:45:14,930
This is what I look into when collabs.

1543
02:45:15,170 --> 02:45:22,730
I try to find a healthy balance of people that would
balance, that would like that would be good foils to each

1544
02:45:22,730 --> 02:45:23,110
other.

1545
02:45:24,490 --> 02:45:29,570
Sometimes I look at, I try to min-max collab groups in the
past.

1546
02:45:29,710 --> 02:45:30,510
I have done that.

1547
02:45:30,890 --> 02:45:31,850
Sometimes they're random.

1548
02:45:32,130 --> 02:45:34,210
It depends on what kind of collab I'm planning.

1549
02:45:34,830 --> 02:45:39,710
I have min-max collabs before in the past and I have like
done random people.

1550
02:45:40,470 --> 02:45:48,250
It really really depends on like how you want this
collaboration to be like because I can I the thing is I have

1551
02:45:48,250 --> 02:45:59,110
the um I have the I guess like the opportunity to be able to
do random because I can do both roles I can be a support and

1552
02:45:59,110 --> 02:46:10,490
a leader I can be like I can do both like the uh uh why I
can do both like oh the chaotic role the the save random

1553
02:46:10,490 --> 02:46:18,610
shit role or can be there to react and stuff and to be able
to like uh to be able to like you know make it so like you

1554
02:46:18,610 --> 02:46:26,630
know i'm i'm enabling whoever is the leader i'm making sure
i'm enabling the leader and i'm enabling their content to be

1555
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:33,130
bigger than what it was like they would say something and i
would make it make it like more funny and i'll make it more

1556
02:46:33,130 --> 02:46:42,490
like oh chaotic or something like stuff like that and uh
that is like what makes a good collab and that's how you

1557
02:46:42,490 --> 02:46:48,710
organize when i'm at min maxing i make sure i choose like
there's some collabs i would purposely pick regarding like

1558
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:57,390
collab partners because i know the collab group that comes
out of it will be really good content because i know the

1559
02:46:57,390 --> 02:47:08,310
people in that group like will reflect really will like foil
each other really well like they'll other really well and

1560
02:47:08,310 --> 02:47:15,610
i've done that before i've also done random people like
being who's free like i've done both it really depends on

1561
02:47:15,610 --> 02:47:28,130
like um it really depends on like how you want to see the
collab um anyway uh so that is like my my like ideology when

1562
02:47:28,130 --> 02:47:40,130
it comes to setting up these collabs uh socialize i hate it
but Always remember the people who were there for you.

1563
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:47,130
So, return favors and offer opportunities back to other
people who were there for you or who have done the same to

1564
02:47:47,130 --> 02:47:47,410
you.

1565
02:47:49,410 --> 02:47:50,530
Like, I've done this before.

1566
02:47:50,750 --> 02:47:56,310
If I have an extra invite to something, I would give this
invite to somebody that I knew was there for me.

1567
02:47:56,350 --> 02:48:00,030
Or, like, that I knew that I knew would benefit from.

1568
02:48:00,130 --> 02:48:02,470
Like, I would be like, oh, hey, you were there for me.

1569
02:48:02,630 --> 02:48:04,130
I have an invite to this thing.

1570
02:48:04,490 --> 02:48:05,430
Do you want to do it?

1571
02:48:05,490 --> 02:48:06,970
Because I know they're there for me.

1572
02:48:06,990 --> 02:48:12,510
I know that if something happens, if something comes up,
they'll have something to return back.

1573
02:48:12,610 --> 02:48:17,710
They'll be like, oh, hey, like, this person was there for
me, so I'll be there for you.

1574
02:48:18,190 --> 02:48:26,190
Like, just make sure you always remember the people who,
like, returned favors or did you a favor.

1575
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:28,190
You always remember that.

1576
02:48:29,450 --> 02:48:31,290
And it's like paying it forward.

1577
02:48:31,550 --> 02:48:36,710
So it's always good for you long run to be able to, like,
remember these things.

1578
02:48:37,810 --> 02:48:45,250
and uh the worst people can say is no like i said or should
you shot the worst is they ghost you or they say no you have

1579
02:48:45,250 --> 02:48:51,010
to get used to rejection it's happened a lot i've ghosted
people a lot because i get overwhelmed sometimes people

1580
02:48:51,010 --> 02:48:58,170
ghost you not because they didn't want they didn't want to
work with you it's because they're so fucking busy and that

1581
02:48:58,170 --> 02:49:04,470
has happened to me i've ghosted people because i was so
fucking busy and i was so very overwhelmed i've been

1582
02:49:04,470 --> 02:49:12,530
overwhelmed And so, like, it's very common for me to be
super overwhelmed and not, like, reply back instantly.

1583
02:49:12,850 --> 02:49:16,350
I've had moments where I'd be like, I'm so sorry for taking
a month to reply.

1584
02:49:16,710 --> 02:49:17,970
Everything was so overwhelming.

1585
02:49:18,250 --> 02:49:18,890
I'm sorry.

1586
02:49:19,450 --> 02:49:21,930
And then, um, it's understandable.

1587
02:49:22,310 --> 02:49:25,190
So, like, just be aware that these things happen.

1588
02:49:25,350 --> 02:49:28,890
And a lot of content creators, like, have their own lives.

1589
02:49:29,130 --> 02:49:30,630
And, like, maybe they don't want to collab.

1590
02:49:30,750 --> 02:49:32,270
And then they just don't want to say no.

1591
02:49:32,850 --> 02:49:33,610
Gotta live with it.

1592
02:49:33,870 --> 02:49:36,970
If you're in content creation, you gotta live with these
things.

1593
02:49:36,990 --> 02:49:49,930
like you gotta like you just gotta deal with it you want
this to be your job this is really it okay what else what

1594
02:49:49,930 --> 02:49:57,010
else oh yeah websites and resources all right so here are
some really good websites and resources for you to use for

1595
02:49:57,010 --> 02:50:03,710
streaming there's booth there's nizima i don't know if i'm
pronouncing right i'm so sorry uh i don't even think i

1596
02:50:03,710 --> 02:50:10,830
should pronounce it because The four things I listed,
they're really good resource websites.

1597
02:50:11,370 --> 02:50:11,470
Both.

1598
02:50:11,970 --> 02:50:17,610
The first two, they're really good for assets and
backgrounds and like VTuber models or skin suits.

1599
02:50:18,030 --> 02:50:18,490
All of that.

1600
02:50:19,050 --> 02:50:26,150
The last two are really good for like also for assets and
backgrounds and like copyright free shit.

1601
02:50:26,550 --> 02:50:28,690
Like they're, those are really good.

1602
02:50:28,790 --> 02:50:38,610
Like I would highly suggest looking at these websites for
like just information you need, and stuff like that or like

1603
02:50:38,610 --> 02:50:46,510
assets you don't want to pay a lot of the things on there
are free that's the best part a lot of there is for free

1604
02:50:46,510 --> 02:50:53,250
care fun is really good for karaoke's or singing like you
don't you're worried about like copyright claims and stuff

1605
02:50:53,250 --> 02:50:59,610
like that i highly suggest using care fun because like they
have like usually if you use care fun stuff you don't have

1606
02:50:59,610 --> 02:51:07,890
to worry about copyright things um because like they're all
like it's it's a there's a subscription fee though it's like

1607
02:51:07,890 --> 02:51:15,850
50 i think a month but if you're uh if you're like a regular
singer or like you like to do karaoke's this is a good

1608
02:51:15,850 --> 02:51:23,210
investment for the future and then schust schust schust i
don't know they're they're like really good like um you have

1609
02:51:23,210 --> 02:51:32,310
to do a patreon pledge stuff and but they're really good for
like uh like you know like those like really uh pretty uh

1610
02:51:32,310 --> 02:51:40,170
immersive like settings and stuff where like the light at
the background actually looks like it connects with the with

1611
02:51:40,170 --> 02:51:47,970
the vtuber that's it that's the thing it's just really good
atmospheric stuff to use when you're streaming so that's

1612
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:55,250
what they use so these are really all really good websites
and resources um if you really want to look for free things

1613
02:51:55,250 --> 02:52:09,630
you don't want to spend money i highly this glass is free I
literally look for VTuber glasses asset Free If you really

1614
02:52:09,630 --> 02:52:20,410
want to find free stuff These are really good places To like
look at If you want free things Okay mental health care I

1615
02:52:20,410 --> 02:52:29,470
will admit I am not the person to go to advice for this
Because I still battle with it frequently If you want to be

1616
02:52:29,470 --> 02:52:36,110
a content creator creator or a V-Tuber, you have to know,
you're so fucked when it comes to mental.

1617
02:52:40,410 --> 02:52:42,610
There's no one that's okay.

1618
02:52:47,930 --> 02:52:57,690
You have to be aware that you're gonna go through some
mental health shit.

1619
02:52:57,910 --> 02:53:00,050
It could be like...

1620
02:53:00,170 --> 02:53:09,070
little bit doesn't have to be like um it doesn't have to be
like really bad but you will you will feel you will feel it

1621
02:53:09,070 --> 02:53:18,230
if you want to be a content creator or like anything to do
with making content on the internet you will not have like

1622
02:53:18,230 --> 02:53:28,350
the most positive mental health experience it's all about
mitigating it like it's like just make sure you have a

1623
02:53:28,350 --> 02:53:32,170
support system that is outside of content creation.

1624
02:53:33,790 --> 02:53:41,270
Because if you have like a support system that's within
content creation, you're just in a fucking echo chamber of

1625
02:53:41,270 --> 02:53:43,010
like some things.

1626
02:53:43,270 --> 02:53:45,570
So you'll need like an outside perspective.

1627
02:53:45,710 --> 02:53:51,230
You really need very thick skin to be able to like do this
as a career.

1628
02:53:52,090 --> 02:53:54,470
Like especially like you're going to deal with so many
things.

1629
02:53:54,610 --> 02:53:56,790
Like you're going to deal with a lot of stuff.

1630
02:53:57,110 --> 02:53:58,590
So you really need thick skin.

1631
02:53:58,710 --> 02:54:05,190
And even if you have thick skin you're still gonna go
through some mental health shit um and on the internet

1632
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:10,450
because your numbers will affect you you can say numbers
don't affect numbers will affect you because you don't want

1633
02:54:10,450 --> 02:54:15,890
to fail like you know you of course you'll be like i'm
trying to have better numbers because i want to have a

1634
02:54:15,890 --> 02:54:23,850
successful career like you don't you still have to pay
attention to it so it's still gonna affect you so um you

1635
02:54:23,850 --> 02:54:35,150
just have to be able to have a good support system outside
of just content stuff outside every once in a while like so

1636
02:54:35,150 --> 02:54:43,850
just be able to like handle that like you have the risk for
being a fucking content creator is that it's not a very

1637
02:54:43,850 --> 02:54:45,530
mentally healthy thing

1638
02:54:48,870 --> 02:54:57,310
being an entertainer is not just like on the internet you
can look at like Hollywood actors those people are not okay

1639
02:55:01,550 --> 02:55:10,130
Hollywood actors, TV actors, celebrities outside of fucking
the internet, they are not okay as well.

1640
02:55:10,450 --> 02:55:15,670
If you're in the entertainment business, like you're,
you're, you're, you're, you're going to have to go through

1641
02:55:15,670 --> 02:55:16,170
some shit.

1642
02:55:20,470 --> 02:55:25,430
So you have to be aware and that is like the biggest risk
you have to take.

1643
02:55:27,450 --> 02:55:38,690
all right anyway i'm gonna look at questions on twitter now
to see if there's anything that i can i'm gonna look at any

1644
02:55:38,690 --> 02:55:47,110
of the questions i have on twitter there's anything i want
to answer but that is basically uh that is basically like

1645
02:55:47,110 --> 02:55:56,270
all i have written down for myself to talk to you guys about
so i hope like all the stuff i have um all the stuff i have

1646
02:55:56,270 --> 02:56:03,430

informative and that it has like helped you guys figure out

1648
02:56:11,790 --> 02:56:24,230
like give you advice and tips on how to go through like
content creation I will be taking questions now from I'll be

1649
02:56:24,230 --> 02:56:30,010
looking at the Twitter thread that I made regarding if
anybody had questions before I made the stream as well as

1650
02:56:30,010 --> 02:56:38,750
taking questions from chat I hope it assists you regarding
if you want a vtuber career in content creation and how to

1651
02:56:38,750 --> 02:56:49,090
game the algorithm um okay so I have this one question that
I saw and one of them was like how do you manage your

1652
02:56:50,330 --> 02:56:57,090
battery when it comes to networking, creating video content,
streaming with your VTuber skin suit, and responding to a

1653
02:56:57,090 --> 02:56:58,490
bunch of brand deals or collabs.

1654
02:56:58,810 --> 02:57:02,090
How do you keep the momentum going during all that work?

1655
02:57:03,030 --> 02:57:07,770
Well, all my energy is mostly on streaming.

1656
02:57:08,770 --> 02:57:16,050
That's why when I say off stream, I'm like really different
is because I've more or more of my energy within streaming

1657
02:57:16,050 --> 02:57:27,950
and like uh and then i go to power save mode the moment
after streaming is also like sort of an escape for me it's

1658
02:57:27,950 --> 02:57:38,050
not very healthy but like for me i uh i like to stream
because it is like i very much enjoy streaming and it is

1659
02:57:38,050 --> 02:57:42,690
like my way of escaping work because my work is off stream

1660
02:57:48,410 --> 02:57:59,870
it is my my my work is off stream at the moment so so that
is why i love streaming this is how i keep my energy all my

1661
02:57:59,870 --> 02:58:08,010
energy is streaming and um i do power save after streaming i
have a management team that helps me with brand deals at

1662
02:58:08,010 --> 02:58:14,710
best like i would look through the details of stuff that got
screened and filter out and then uh and then when it comes

1663
02:58:14,710 --> 02:58:17,670
to networking i take that really slow at the moment.

1664
02:58:17,990 --> 02:58:24,610
Networking is the thing I'm like really slow on because
right now I am focused on stabilizing myself.

1665
02:58:25,650 --> 02:58:33,230
Um I am trying to make sure I'm more stabilized in my career
because like I said like my career just started out of a

1666
02:58:33,230 --> 02:58:37,770
sudden as an indie and I'm still at the point where I'm
still trying to stabilize.

1667
02:58:37,950 --> 02:58:44,030
There's a lot of groundwork that we have to make and we're
still making that groundwork and there's a lot of things I

1668
02:58:44,030 --> 02:58:52,590
haven't announced i haven't announced yet regarding like uh
like you know future sponsors future brand deals there's so

1669
02:58:52,590 --> 02:58:58,410
many things i haven't yet been able to announce uh because
we're still like it's like stabilizing we're still

1670
02:58:58,410 --> 02:59:09,350
establishing things um but we're slowly getting there so
that is really how how my life is at right now um all right

1671
02:59:09,350 --> 02:59:15,970
uh neil thank you for super chat thank you thank you do you
have workout routine or do you sustain through pure mental

1672
02:59:15,970 --> 02:59:25,030
fortitude and caffeine that's the thing um late right now um
right now i haven't really had a really decent workout

1673
02:59:25,030 --> 02:59:32,490
routine at the moment um because i'm not stabilized at the
moment before in the past i did i have a treadmill in my

1674
02:59:32,490 --> 02:59:40,050
room but because like you have to take some cuts in terms of
like your routine and that is sadly one the things I had to

1675
02:59:40,050 --> 02:59:40,710
take a cut on.

1676
02:59:41,130 --> 02:59:47,890
I don't normally drink caffeine, but I have drank caffeine
at least like once or twice a week.

1677
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:52,770
I have drank some caffeine once or twice a week.

1678
02:59:53,810 --> 02:59:56,930
And, um, and because I really need it.

1679
02:59:57,550 --> 03:00:02,230
Like I, there's been a lot of stuff, um, that I have to do.

1680
03:00:02,590 --> 03:00:05,510
And I, sometimes I get really tired after a while.

1681
03:00:06,430 --> 03:00:12,150
And, um, I have, unfortunately that is like one of the
things i have to do i have to take caffeine now because it's

1682

1684
03:00:30,890 --> 03:00:41,690
caffeine i drink water i just drink water when i'm streaming
off stream i actually drink like tea or uh coffee just to be

03:01:29,610 --> 03:01:30,390
Think of the super chat.

1701
03:01:30,490 --> 03:01:30,790
Thank you.

1702
03:01:31,210 --> 03:01:31,510
Thank you.

1703
03:01:31,890 --> 03:01:32,210
Okay.

1704
03:01:33,130 --> 03:01:33,950
Very easy.

1705
03:01:34,090 --> 03:01:35,130
You go on Steam.

1706
03:01:36,050 --> 03:01:41,450
You go to recently released or upcoming games.

1707
03:01:41,530 --> 03:01:43,530
Recently released on Steam.

1708
03:01:43,950 --> 03:01:45,390
You look at the reviews.

1709
03:01:45,870 --> 03:01:54,430
If a new game gets like more than 700 plus reviews, this is
how I found Pineapple on Pizza, by the way.

1710
03:01:54,750 --> 03:02:00,010
I was like the first one to stream Pineapple on Pizza
because I literally looked at the reviews and I was like,

1711
03:02:00,110 --> 03:02:01,750
this game came out yesterday.

1712
03:02:01,850 --> 03:02:03,450
Like, I'll be like, this game came out yesterday.

1713
03:02:03,850 --> 03:02:05,210
It has a thousand reviews.

1714
03:02:05,430 --> 03:02:06,310
What the fuck?

1715
03:02:07,070 --> 03:02:08,330
And then I streamed it.

1716
03:02:09,090 --> 03:02:10,350
And that's how I found out.

1717
03:02:13,490 --> 03:02:20,070
I was one of the first one to stream it I saw like there
were a thousand reviews with a game that just came out

1718
03:02:20,070 --> 03:02:26,670
yesterday and then I just streamed it because I was like
clearly this is gonna be a meta game clearly this game is

1719
03:02:26,670 --> 03:02:37,870
gonna be popular um and it was like basically like you just
like look at steam reviews if it's like if there's like I

1720
03:02:37,870 --> 03:02:46,910
said if uh if a game on steam recently released has more
than like 500 plus reviews then most likely it is going to

1721
03:02:46,910 --> 03:02:52,970
be like a meta game it's going to be a meta stream you can
also look at upcoming releases and just judge by the

1722
03:02:52,970 --> 03:03:03,210
upcoming releases another way is to i said this before but
you look at twitch and see what's the most like you go at

1723
03:03:03,210 --> 03:03:11,090
twitch and see like what's popular you go to browse and then
categories And then, bam, you can see, like, if you see a

1724
03:03:11,090 --> 03:03:15,790
stream of a game that's like, oh, I've never seen this
before.

1725
03:03:16,490 --> 03:03:18,190
I've never seen this game before.

1726
03:03:18,670 --> 03:03:19,410
What the fuck?

1727
03:03:19,550 --> 03:03:22,610
And then you click on it and you're like, oh, that's a new
stream meta.

1728
03:03:22,890 --> 03:03:26,990
The Twitch front page is basically a story of, like, what's
meta.

1729
03:03:27,970 --> 03:03:31,130
You can also follow some big content creators.

1730
03:03:32,330 --> 03:03:43,330
Like, uh, these content creators, they always follow meta,
which is, like, uh uh moist critical uh let's see moist

1731
03:03:43,330 --> 03:03:53,530
critical and follows twitch meta not twitch meta follows
streamer meta very well he follows streamer meta in terms of

1732
03:03:53,530 --> 03:04:02,930
games really really well and i i would like sometimes like i
think i saw i think i saw a supermarket simulator uh no not

1733
03:04:02,930 --> 03:04:08,630
from him i saw it somewhere else i don't remember who i
don't remember who i saw that was streaming super market

1734
03:04:08,630 --> 03:04:16,750
simulator and i i knew that like uh i knew like someone was
streaming it and i knew that was going to be that's the

1735
03:04:16,750 --> 03:04:22,510
stream meta and that's why i put it on my schedule because i
saw somebody stream it and i was like oh my god i'm going to

1736
03:04:22,510 --> 03:04:34,850
stream it because i was like wait this is the next stream
game um and that's why uh uh that's why i streamed it i

1737
03:04:34,850 --> 03:04:40,050
think i'm trying i think SureFore gets addicted to a new
game.

1738
03:04:40,250 --> 03:04:41,810
I knew it's a good game.

1739
03:04:45,010 --> 03:04:46,910
Ludwig is also a good stream meta follower.

1740
03:04:47,530 --> 03:04:49,730
Ludwig follows meta really well.

1741
03:04:54,150 --> 03:04:54,990
Let's see.

1742
03:04:57,050 --> 03:04:57,690
What else?

1743
03:05:00,790 --> 03:05:01,870
So, thank you for the super chat.

1744
03:05:02,010 --> 03:05:02,170
Thank you.

1745
03:05:02,170 --> 03:05:02,610
Thank you.

1746
03:05:02,650 --> 03:05:05,050
You mentioned making merch is very important for income.

1747
03:05:05,370 --> 03:05:07,810
How much does it cost usually commission art for
merchandise?

1748
03:05:08,270 --> 03:05:08,890
Give me a super chat.

1749
03:05:09,070 --> 03:05:09,150
Thank you.

1750
03:05:09,490 --> 03:05:09,750
Thank you.

1751
03:05:10,070 --> 03:05:15,150
That really depends on what kind of merch you want to make.

1752
03:05:16,370 --> 03:05:18,050
Obviously, I gave some cheap options.

1753
03:05:19,090 --> 03:05:28,810
I would think acrylic stands and acrylic stands, pins,
stickers, prints.

1754
03:05:29,610 --> 03:05:34,670
They are the most convenient ones and the easiest to make
because you can't fuck it up.

1755
03:05:34,730 --> 03:05:35,970
You can't fuck up stickers.

1756
03:05:36,190 --> 03:05:37,390
You can't fuck up acrylic stands.

1757
03:05:38,270 --> 03:05:43,370
up like prints and stuff like that those are like the
easiest to make and like um you don't have to worry about

1758
03:05:43,370 --> 03:05:51,390
grabbing samples and stuff like that the more complicated
the merch the more oh and keychains yes and keychains the

1759
03:05:51,390 --> 03:06:00,370
more complicated the merch the harder is to grab like to
grab like merch that's not fucked up you know like you know

1760
03:06:00,370 --> 03:06:08,430
if a manufacturer sent you merch it's like you might get
more like uh duds than you do like uh actual like quality

1761
03:06:08,430 --> 03:06:15,330
quality that you can send out to people even enamel pins
enamel in animal pins oh my god you have to find a really

1762
03:06:15,330 --> 03:06:22,490
good manufacturer for pins like enamel pins because like you
can fuck that up so easily i've had one time where i got a

1763
03:06:22,490 --> 03:06:28,690
manufacturer that like sent me like the quality control for
that is so hard to manage because they would send me like uh

1764
03:06:28,690 --> 03:06:36,530
i don't i never worked with that one again but they sent
thousand pins or something and like, I think like 200 of

1765
03:06:36,530 --> 03:06:37,810
them were like duds.

1766
03:06:38,330 --> 03:06:44,850
Like there was like markings on it that I had to clean
myself and like at the, but even then I didn't, I couldn't

1767
03:06:44,850 --> 03:06:47,230
get like the scratch marks and stuff out of it.

1768
03:06:47,330 --> 03:06:52,650
There's like, and I had to like sell it as a bargain price
and stuff because it's like, it's so hard.

1769
03:06:52,790 --> 03:06:56,170
That's why it's like, and now pins are like some of the
riskiest for quality control.

1770
03:06:56,630 --> 03:07:07,030
Anything beyond like keychain, stickers, pin, like buttons,
acrylic stands are really hard to get quality control right

1771
03:07:07,030 --> 03:07:16,110
um so you guys gotta be like really careful for stuff like
that and regarding art like i said it depends on who you

1772
03:07:16,110 --> 03:07:21,850
want to commission depends on each artist has his own rate
so i can't give you an estimate there's some artists that

1773
03:07:21,850 --> 03:07:27,510
charges a lot there's some artists that don't it really
depends on the estimate uh some artists will charge a

1774
03:07:27,510 --> 03:07:35,770
commercial price some won't just have to it's basically who
you oh many thank you the super chat thank you thank you

1775
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:42,250
what's the best way to announce a big project event so that
you can receive the most engagement on stream live that's

1776
03:07:42,250 --> 03:07:49,230
really the best way if you're a streamer on stream live
announce it you don't say anything about what the thing is

1777
03:07:49,230 --> 03:07:56,310
you say special announcement special event uh and then you
reveal it on stream because and you reveal the participants

1778
03:07:56,310 --> 03:08:03,710
on stream you don't reveal it on twitter or like social
media first you reveal it want to know who's participating

1779
03:08:03,710 --> 03:08:13,130
so you announce it on stream one by one uh because it gets
bring it builds it builds up like um anticipation and stuff

1780
03:08:13,130 --> 03:08:24,730
um and you're like oh and you're like oh who's gonna be next
whoa um so announcing any you announce things live not via

1781
03:08:24,730 --> 03:08:30,450
um social media unless it's like a tournament invite then
like you can't really announce that live

1782
03:08:34,470 --> 03:08:40,770
yeah you it's like you see like everybody always does this
oh i'm doing this thing wait until the very end you wait

1783
03:08:40,770 --> 03:08:46,010
like oh if you want to hear what the announcement is you
wait until the very end because you make all the viewers

1784
03:08:46,010 --> 03:08:51,490
wait until the very end they show come to watch you do a
regular stream if it's a regular stream with announced

1785
03:08:51,490 --> 03:08:57,450
tacked on the end it make it makes the viewer stay until the
very end because they want to know what the announcement is

1786
03:08:57,450 --> 03:09:18,490
so um that's what like uh that what brings in um all the
engagements for your stream uh let's see uh let me see what

1787
03:09:18,490 --> 03:09:28,530
to uh what to do here okay uh direct thank you for the super
chat thank you thank you so you talk how do you go about

1788
03:09:28,530 --> 03:09:36,050
learning a language becoming some influence requires years
doesn't it you You're, okay, you want to learn languages.

1789
03:09:36,570 --> 03:09:37,110
Get a tutor.

1790
03:09:37,410 --> 03:09:38,150
Get a teacher.

1791
03:09:39,310 --> 03:09:44,910
The best, because the best way to learn a language is being
able to speak that language with somebody else.

1792
03:09:45,350 --> 03:09:48,410
And the easiest way to do that is having a tutor.

1793
03:09:49,950 --> 03:09:53,530
Having a teacher or a friend to help you with your studies.

1794
03:09:54,090 --> 03:10:01,930
Because if you just read and write, you're not learning as
fast as like speaking the language with somebody.

1795
03:10:03,090 --> 03:10:05,550
So you have to always be able to communicate.

1796
03:10:05,570 --> 03:10:15,410
You have to be able to communicate with somebody to be able
to build up your language learning.

1797
03:10:16,190 --> 03:10:19,410
And like, speaking the language helps you learn so much.

1798
03:10:19,830 --> 03:10:21,130
Like, you just have to get a tutor.

1799
03:10:21,530 --> 03:10:23,270
You can grab like so many resources.

1800
03:10:23,510 --> 03:10:25,590
Like, you know, I have like lots of books and everything.

1801
03:10:25,990 --> 03:10:27,330
And like just study the book.

1802
03:10:27,530 --> 03:10:31,790
But if you don't speak that language regularly, then it
won't help you.

1803
03:10:32,610 --> 03:10:35,230
is not a good enough way to learn language.

1804
03:10:35,690 --> 03:10:37,270
Duolingo is like substitute.

1805
03:10:37,430 --> 03:10:41,530
You can use it as an extra learning, but it's not the main
thing you use for learning.

1806
03:10:41,690 --> 03:10:44,370
You have to have other ways to learn.

1807
03:10:44,830 --> 03:10:46,710
You can't just rely on Duolingo.

1808
03:10:47,470 --> 03:10:49,390
Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1809
03:10:53,390 --> 03:10:53,790
Um...

1810
03:10:54,390 --> 03:10:54,790
Uh...

1811
03:10:54,790 --> 03:10:55,730
Singy, think of the super chat.

1812
03:10:55,790 --> 03:10:56,030
Thank you, thank you.

1813
03:10:56,170 --> 03:11:01,050
Hearing everything you have to say made me realize that I'm
better at pursuing content creation as a hobby rather than a

1814
03:11:01,050 --> 03:11:01,270
job.

1815
03:11:01,570 --> 03:11:02,210
Think of the super chat.

1816
03:11:02,250 --> 03:11:02,590
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1817
03:11:02,610 --> 03:11:02,810
Thank you.

1818
03:11:02,990 --> 03:11:07,430
The thing is, a lot of content creators start off as a
hobby, because it's not stable.

1819
03:11:07,690 --> 03:11:09,650
It's not a stable job, and it's all about luck.

1820
03:11:10,910 --> 03:11:13,130
But it's all about trying to maximize your luck as well.

1821
03:11:13,970 --> 03:11:16,810
I would say, oh yeah, someone says watch streams.

1822
03:11:17,130 --> 03:11:21,630
Yes, if you want to get better, watch streams in that
language you're trying to learn.

1823
03:11:22,310 --> 03:11:31,070
I improved a lot in my Cantonese and my Mandarin, because
when I lived in Asia, I would only watch the TV it was

1824
03:11:31,070 --> 03:11:39,670
playing, and then I would like, watch like shows like um
shows in that language uh because like you know the tv was

1825
03:11:39,670 --> 03:11:46,290
on i had nothing to do and i was i couldn't play on my pc so
i would just sit there and just watch and i got better i got

1826
03:11:46,290 --> 03:11:53,730
better in my listening skills i got better in my listening
skills and my speaking skills so i highly recommend watching

1827
03:11:53,730 --> 03:11:59,090
streams in that language and you're gonna slowly pick up the
language as well if you're learning already if you're

1828
03:11:59,090 --> 03:12:08,730
learning already it helps improve your uh it helps improve
it a lot uh but yes like i said content creation a lot of

1829
03:12:08,730 --> 03:12:16,990
people start out as a hobby if it's best if you start off
with having a as like a um as like an extra income and not

1830
03:12:16,990 --> 03:12:23,510
like you know go full in because like you know you always
you need a backup plan you always need to have a backup plan

1831
03:12:23,510 --> 03:12:31,270
you know so like a lot of people start off content creation
as a hobby and then later on when it gets more successful

1832
03:12:33,330 --> 03:12:39,750
you start investing more into it and then when you make
enough money you can like you know fully commit to it and

1833
03:12:39,750 --> 03:12:48,250
that's like the safest way I think if you want to go safe I
would say like always have a backup plan because you don't

1834
03:12:48,250 --> 03:12:52,690
quit your day job always like make sure you have something
in the backup just in case

1835
03:12:56,030 --> 03:13:12,020
let's see what else how much what do i have um let's see uh
volley think of a super chat thank you thank you i made a

1836
03:13:12,020 --> 03:13:23,880
plushie of my vtuber and my subs one to buy it 35 plus 122
for international shipping that is way too how big is the

1837
03:13:23,880 --> 03:13:31,920
plushie that is way too much for a plushie It also, where do
you live without doxing yourself?

1838
03:13:36,480 --> 03:13:41,520
Without doxing yourself, like, that is honestly way too much
for shipping.

1839
03:13:41,720 --> 03:13:52,420
It really depends on, like, how much the, uh, oh, okay, uh,
how much the, how big the plushie is, too.

1840
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:58,060
Because at that point, that is way too expensive.

1841
03:13:58,140 --> 03:14:04,840
especially like if it's an NA and plushie should not be that
expensive for shipping I don't know overseas shipping I

1842
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:13,520
don't know like how bad shipping is in other countries but
like I know for NA that's way too expensive for

1843
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:21,740
international and um at that point it's just so much easier
to just find a distributor because distributors help if

1844
03:14:21,740 --> 03:14:35,820
you're if the plushie is like manufactured um you're not the
one that made that plushie then like at that point getting a

1845
03:14:35,820 --> 03:14:51,940
distributor helps with that but I feel like I feel like $122
in general is way too much for from what I'm seeing in my

1846
03:14:51,940 --> 03:15:01,860
experience I know like in different countries it really
depends on um on like how much shipping is in different

1847
03:15:01,860 --> 03:15:13,040
countries and that's why some countries some companies have
distributors um have distributors in like cheaper places

1848
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:18,500
like not cheaper place in like in that place like the
distributor would be like you know they want to distribute

1849
03:15:18,500 --> 03:15:27,360
stuff in america but uh the company is in japan they will
buy a warehouse they would have a warehouse in stuff like

1850
03:15:27,360 --> 03:15:35,500
that just to help with shipping and stuff and that's why
people find distributors because to help with shipping um

1851
03:15:35,500 --> 03:15:44,760
let's see i'm trying to see what else to answer um

1852
03:15:50,080 --> 03:15:56,640
uh niana thank you for the super chat thank you thank you hi
doki my question is How to smoothly approach other streamers

1853
03:15:56,640 --> 03:15:58,400
to make genuine connections.

1854
03:15:58,900 --> 03:16:01,200
Twitter and their chat.

1855
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:07,040
A lot of my friends I've made before I, you know, started
being a serious VTuber.

1856
03:16:07,360 --> 03:16:09,460
Like before the friends I made like two years.

1857
03:16:09,640 --> 03:16:13,920
Like friends I made before I started being serious VTubering
two years ago.

1858
03:16:14,460 --> 03:16:17,880
It was from Twitter and Twitch chat.

1859
03:16:18,360 --> 03:16:19,820
Like I was a Twitch streamer.

1860
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:20,920
And I would like hang out.

1861
03:16:20,940 --> 03:16:21,840
I would raid them.

1862
03:16:22,200 --> 03:16:23,320
I would raid them.

1863
03:16:24,460 --> 03:16:26,000
A lot of them are artists too.

1864
03:16:26,820 --> 03:16:30,040
A lot of the friends I've made, because I was an artist
YouTuber.

1865
03:16:30,980 --> 03:16:32,840
So I would draw a lot.

1866
03:16:33,340 --> 03:16:35,660
And I just do art streams and everything.

1867
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:42,380
And because of that, I made friends by rating other Twitch
streamers.

1868
03:16:44,400 --> 03:16:47,820
And also talking to them on Twitter and interacting with
them.

1869
03:16:48,160 --> 03:16:49,720
And then they'll tweet something.

1870
03:16:49,860 --> 03:16:50,380
Like they'll tweet art.

1871
03:16:50,380 --> 03:16:51,300
I'm like, oh my God.

1872
03:16:51,460 --> 03:16:53,300
I love your art and stuff like that.

1873
03:16:53,300 --> 03:16:58,460
and I would like give them like signal boost them if they
want that they have that they tweet something I would like

1874
03:16:58,460 --> 03:17:06,000
boost booster tweets and stuff by retweeting it and like you
know talk to them on discord and talk to them on twitch and

1875
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:14,460
like like play games with them on stream like it's all about
um just like being consistent and stuff like that obviously

1876
03:17:14,460 --> 03:17:23,700
I am a lot more busy now I'm not a lot more busy now so I
don't have that you know I don't have time to really like do

1877
03:17:23,700 --> 03:17:34,520
that anymore and uh and now i just like you know i uh uh it
is a whole harder for me to to make more friendships because

1878
03:17:34,520 --> 03:17:42,920
i have a lot of stuff going on and um i have to make sure i
can balance my schedule and stuff like that but back then uh

1879
03:17:42,920 --> 03:17:49,440
back then i would just you know just hang out and talk to
them and just raid raid their streams and because i wanted

1880
03:17:49,440 --> 03:17:50,580
to like know them

1881
03:17:55,000 --> 03:18:00,320
see big boy thank you for the super chat thank you thank you
hi dokey quick question is it possible for me to start

1882
03:18:00,320 --> 03:18:08,560
streaming as a hobby despite having yes you can have any
time block i used to be a dgen streamer i wouldn't start my

1883
03:18:08,560 --> 03:18:18,300
stream when i was a twitch streamer i would stream at 9 p.m
and i had a audience for 9 p.m streams sometimes i stream at

1884
03:18:18,300 --> 03:18:29,500
1 a.m and i had an audience for that a dgen hour streamer
like if people were up in dgen hours time or people on the

1885
03:18:29,500 --> 03:18:37,640
other side of the world wanted a english-speaking streamer
to watch i was there for them but yes it doesn't matter

1886
03:18:37,640 --> 03:18:50,340
anytime is possible you don't have to worry anytime is you
just stream don't like just stream if you have a a a really

1887
03:18:50,340 --> 03:19:00,080
bad work hour schedule um just make that your consistent
stream hours there's an audience base somewhere for it um

1888
03:19:00,080 --> 03:19:08,500
let's see uh so i think of the super chat thank you how do
you find collabs as a small streamer literally little

1889
03:19:08,500 --> 03:19:16,420
friends connection and networking thank you for super chat
thank you thank you there are i would find other people

1890
03:19:16,420 --> 03:19:25,740
around your your viewer viewer level and just interact with
them they want they want connections too as an indie that's

1891
03:19:25,740 --> 03:19:32,280
the biggest thing as an indie we all want to find a group
that's why i'm doing so many collabs because i'm trying to

1892
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:40,820
find a consistent group to hang out with to like see which
who i groove with the most so i'm trying to collab with like

1893
03:19:40,820 --> 03:19:49,820
bunch of people from different areas to like meet new people
and like just want to have a consistent group of people to

1894
03:19:49,820 --> 03:20:01,780
just hit up to do games with and um just reach out like the
the biggest hurdle is just reaching out to people and i'm

1895
03:20:01,780 --> 03:20:08,900
pretty sure those people who are around your range they want
more friends too they want more connections they want to

1896
03:20:08,900 --> 03:20:14,220
find new vtubers new But never forget who was there for you.

1897
03:20:14,480 --> 03:20:15,160
Never forget.

1898
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:20,960
There's a lot of people that I used to know that was like
around my view count when I was like a lot smaller.

1899
03:20:22,040 --> 03:20:25,140
And then they're now really big streamers.

1900
03:20:26,080 --> 03:20:26,700
You don't know.

1901
03:20:27,360 --> 03:20:30,400
Just never forget what they did for you and what you did for
them.

1902
03:20:32,740 --> 03:20:40,340
So you always just remember that like just who stuck out for
you and who like was there.

1903
03:20:41,200 --> 03:20:48,300
just remember that and just reach out to people around your
similar range because I'm pretty sure they're also looking

1904
03:20:48,300 --> 03:20:53,360
for friends they're also looking for people to play with
that's one of the hardest parts in indie people just and why

1905
03:20:53,360 --> 03:21:00,420
people want to join a community they want to have sorry why
people want to join a company they want to have a community

1906
03:21:00,420 --> 03:21:08,100
that they can just hit up on and bam easy they just want a
community like a group of people to just play and stream

1907
03:21:12,940 --> 03:21:18,700
um let's see thanks thank you for the super chat thank you
thank you how do you come up with good jokes on the spot and

1908
03:21:18,700 --> 03:21:23,980
chat entertain so is it why is it separate content like
music and game on different channels thank you for the super

1909
03:21:23,980 --> 03:21:38,240
chat thank you thank you um how do i come up with good jokes
on this spot and chat that's just a talent like i can't i

1910
03:21:38,240 --> 03:21:48,020
can't give advice on that naturally just had that as a skill
for me so like i'm sorry i i i unfortunately i can't give

1911
03:21:48,020 --> 03:21:57,120
you advice on how to come up with good jokes on the spot and
like chat entertain is just for chat entertainment don't

1912
03:21:57,120 --> 03:22:05,620
have don't bash something over and over again don't beat up
a dead horse that's really it like chat entertainment as

1913
03:22:05,620 --> 03:22:08,380
long as you don't beat a dead horse and like keep

1914
03:22:11,480 --> 03:22:17,660
Apparently, that's like the best advice I can give you like
there are moments where like some jokes would come up that I

1915
03:22:17,660 --> 03:22:24,700
would say that became like memes and like like phrases that
were like my chat would consistently bring up but I wouldn't

1916
03:22:24,700 --> 03:22:29,080
say it that often I would say it like I wouldn't or I would
never say it ever again.

1917
03:22:29,420 --> 03:22:33,080
I say this phrase once and then it's forever.

1918
03:22:33,460 --> 03:22:36,700
It's like the the chat loves it so much.

1919
03:22:36,940 --> 03:22:37,940
They always remember it.

1920
03:22:38,200 --> 03:22:40,800
But what they don't know was I said it once.

1921
03:22:40,820 --> 03:22:47,560
once on one stream and then but it was my identity

1922
03:22:52,840 --> 03:23:03,300
and and like the thing is you have to know when to forgive
the joke back or or like or when to like stop a joke because

1923
03:23:03,300 --> 03:23:13,560
you have to make it so that the chat doesn't get tired of it
um because you don't overkill it as long as the chat is

1924
03:23:13,560 --> 03:23:20,660
entertaining themselves that's all that matters and
regarding like how do i come up with these jokes on the spot

1925
03:23:20,660 --> 03:23:32,060
i think you guys should know when i first started streaming
i wasn't i got peer pressure to stream i like i didn't

1926
03:23:32,060 --> 03:23:39,700
stream because i wanted to be a streamer this is a little
lore i don't know if i told this before i'm pretty sure i

1927
03:23:39,700 --> 03:23:50,460
have basically i got discovered in overwatch and like
because um i was using uh voice chat to like play overwatch

1928
03:23:50,460 --> 03:24:00,260
and i had a streamer in my game and then um later on became
friends with some streamers who played overwatch uh like

1929
03:24:00,260 --> 03:24:09,900
they was all high ranked overwatch and um And then like they
told me to start streaming And so they were like Oh we think

1930
03:24:09,900 --> 03:24:13,580
you're very entertaining You should just because I would say
like random shit Like

1931
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:25,720
These are like big overwatch content creators at that time
too And like I would say like something that would be funny

1932
03:24:25,720 --> 03:24:31,100
And then like they would be like wait you should like stream
You can be a really good You can be you're really

1933
03:24:31,100 --> 03:24:38,120
entertaining stream and you're entertaining on stream
because at that time i had more energy off stream to

1934
03:24:38,120 --> 03:24:49,200
actually be entertaining like just hanging out you know just
hanging out i had like like i can entertain people like as

1935
03:24:49,200 --> 03:24:55,020
just hanging out not because like also to be fair like even
then when i hang out with people i say some fucking shit

1936
03:24:55,020 --> 03:24:57,620
that would be like what the fuck

1937
03:25:04,440 --> 03:25:12,340
um um because of that like they were like you should start
streaming and then i did i started streaming uh because of

1938
03:25:12,340 --> 03:25:20,180
that um and that's why i i honestly can't give advice on
like how to do jokes and how to be entertaining because like

1939
03:25:20,180 --> 03:25:27,120
i said like the reason why i started streaming was because i
literally got peer pressure to by like my friends because

1940
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:32,220
they were like oh my god you're pretty entertaining you
should try streaming i was like okay but i never committed

1941
03:25:32,220 --> 03:25:41,620
to it i never I just did it for fun like I never like
actually try tried and never like kept it consistent I had

1942
03:25:41,620 --> 03:25:50,860
like moments where I took like four plus months break
without telling anybody because I never like I didn't I

1943
03:25:50,860 --> 03:25:57,400
didn't have much I was barely an affiliate I was just like
fucking around and I was like I didn't feel like streaming

1944
03:25:57,400 --> 03:25:59,980
so now I'll just be like all right I'm not going to stream.

1945
03:26:01,580 --> 03:26:02,380
I didn't.

1946
03:26:02,440 --> 03:26:04,000
I was just like, all right.

1947
03:26:04,140 --> 03:26:07,700
I didn't take it seriously because I didn't see it as a
career.

1948
03:26:08,340 --> 03:26:09,420
I didn't see it as a...

1949
03:26:09,420 --> 03:26:10,960
And it would happen multiple times.

1950
03:26:11,040 --> 03:26:14,360
It wasn't like, oh, yeah, the first time there was four
months and I came back.

1951
03:26:14,580 --> 03:26:15,560
I would be like four months.

1952
03:26:15,620 --> 03:26:20,380
And then I streamed for like two to three weeks or something
or like an entire month.

1953
03:26:20,460 --> 03:26:22,500
And then I disappeared for another six months.

1954
03:26:23,040 --> 03:26:25,160
And then I was just like, whatever.

1955
03:26:28,920 --> 03:26:37,080
so i never took it seriously i just i just did it for fun um
that's really that's why i can't give like actual advice on

1956
03:26:37,080 --> 03:26:44,200
this because it's like i feel like i'm not like the right
person to uh to give advice on how to be entertaining

1957
03:26:44,200 --> 03:26:52,360
because i for me it was just naturally within me um yeah
you're lucky i'm not i don't do that anymore i actually this

1958
03:26:52,360 --> 03:27:06,500
is a job now we're so lucky that i actually see this as a
job now yeah the bark knights the og bark knights they are

1959
03:27:06,500 --> 03:27:16,720
the strongest knights out there they i there's like okay the
og discord is like still running like the og discord that i

1962
03:27:38,440 --> 03:27:47,900
um i forgot to give you guys this but like how to nurture a
community because what you give to the community is what

1963
03:27:47,900 --> 03:27:55,240

and care your community because they do so much to support

1969
03:28:44,360 --> 03:28:50,640
your community Every so often When I was a Twitch streamer I
would have, like, sketch raffles.

1970
03:28:51,200 --> 03:28:56,120
By the way, which reminds me, I need to fucking do the
sketches and stuff from the donations alert.

1971
03:28:56,960 --> 03:28:58,680
I'm sorry, I've been so busy.

1972
03:28:59,120 --> 03:28:59,740
But that's a...

1973
03:28:59,740 --> 03:29:02,840
When I was a Twitch streamer, I would have sketch raffles.

1974
03:29:03,360 --> 03:29:05,360
And then the top three...

1975
03:29:05,360 --> 03:29:09,900
And then, like, I would have, like, raffles where, like, all
my...

1976
03:29:09,900 --> 03:29:16,420
I would have, like, a lottery where, like, all my
subscribers were put in a lottery.

1977
03:29:18,640 --> 03:29:22,740
I would pick like five subscribers to win art from me.

1978
03:29:23,140 --> 03:29:30,100
And then my most gifted subscriber, I would send them a
postcard to be like, thank you for supporting me this month.

1979
03:29:30,440 --> 03:29:31,380
Like stuff like that.

1980
03:29:31,460 --> 03:29:33,820
I had made like little gift bundles and everything.

1981
03:29:34,120 --> 03:29:36,660
And I didn't even have like a large viewership.

1982
03:29:36,720 --> 03:29:42,700
I didn't have like a large viewership, but I had like a very
dedicated community because I really appreciated them.

1983
03:29:42,940 --> 03:29:47,340
I really appreciated what they did and like sort of
supporting me for this long.

1984
03:29:48,640 --> 03:29:54,280
like gift bundles and stuff where my top support is and
being like a personal post guide and be like oh thank you

1985
03:29:54,280 --> 03:30:07,760
for all the gifted subs i had guys i had at one point i have
i had 500 subs on twitch but my average viewership was 30 to

1986
03:30:07,760 --> 03:30:08,220
40.

1987
03:30:12,850 --> 03:30:25,860
like like because i was like i was i just like i was just
like uh I was just like I really cared about my community.

1988
03:30:26,280 --> 03:30:27,760
I really cared about them.

1989
03:30:28,580 --> 03:30:31,300
Because I really appreciated them.

1990
03:30:32,320 --> 03:30:34,920
And I really appreciated them.

1991
03:30:35,700 --> 03:30:38,120
And I tried very hard to show my appreciation.

1992
03:30:39,260 --> 03:30:41,600
And here, thank you for the five gifted ships.

1993
03:30:41,840 --> 03:30:41,980
Thank you.

1994
03:30:42,320 --> 03:30:42,740
Thank you.

1995
03:30:44,700 --> 03:30:48,900
So like it's all about like being a really good content
curator.

1996
03:30:49,100 --> 03:30:51,260
Is making sure you give back to your community.

1997
03:30:52,340 --> 03:30:57,640
you show them that you really care and that you care because
you can't be a content creator without your viewers and you

1998
03:30:57,640 --> 03:31:03,620
have to show them that you appreciate it and that's why i
try really hard with doing all these projects doing all

1999
03:31:03,620 --> 03:31:10,320
these like fun things like events and like fun things with
you guys and like trying to do lots of like interactive

2000
03:31:10,320 --> 03:31:20,280
stuff with you guys is how i show i care and how i like um
and like all the things i uh because i couldn't be here

2001
03:31:20,280 --> 03:31:33,420
without you guys uh all right let's see uh what else what
else can i what else uh i holy shit i almost

2002
03:31:36,440 --> 03:31:46,560
that's whoa i did not realize how long i've been streaming
for thank you for the super chat thank you thank you uh yeah

2003
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:51,060
start small and care about those around you glad to hear
these tips don't you i'm doing fine too but i cannot draw

2004
03:31:51,060 --> 03:31:54,100
nor draw nor do more than playing games and talking with
them.

2005
03:31:54,240 --> 03:31:54,740
What can I do?

2006
03:31:54,840 --> 03:31:55,680
Thank you for the super chat.

2007
03:31:55,900 --> 03:31:56,140
Thank you.

2008
03:31:56,340 --> 03:31:56,540
Thank you.

2009
03:31:56,840 --> 03:31:58,180
That's sometimes what they need.

2010
03:31:58,360 --> 03:32:00,940
The chat just wants your entertainment and your company.

2011
03:32:01,560 --> 03:32:05,940
You don't have to do more than like, uh, what they're happy
with.

2012
03:32:06,580 --> 03:32:14,180
Like, by the time you have a bigger viewer base, you can
start reinvesting more into your channel.

2013
03:32:14,780 --> 03:32:18,120
Like, when I first started, all I did was just play video
games.

2014
03:32:18,640 --> 03:32:22,100
And then I, the bigger I got, the more I reinvested.

2015
03:32:22,340 --> 03:32:29,620
Sometimes, like I said, you start small and then the bigger
you get, the more money you have earned, reinvest in your

2016
03:32:29,620 --> 03:32:31,560
channel or save money.

2017
03:32:32,420 --> 03:32:34,960
Honestly, there's a lot of people who do YouTubing different
ways.

2018
03:32:35,260 --> 03:32:41,420
They want to use YouTubing to be able to afford a house in
the future or like an apartment.

2019
03:32:43,320 --> 03:32:54,680
I put it in, I reinvest in my content because like I enjoy
making content and I enjoy reinvesting I'm playing more so

2020
03:32:54,680 --> 03:33:05,980
of the long game because I can save for a house for like an
actual place to live later on down the line for me this is

2021
03:33:05,980 --> 03:33:15,960
me don't follow this if you don't have a stable enough like
career but for me content creation for me obviously would

2022
03:33:15,960 --> 03:33:27,900
never be long term because content creation never has a long
lifespan within the internet unless you're the 0.001 so for

2023
03:33:27,900 --> 03:33:36,760
me i try to take advantage of what i can do as a content
creator and what i can invest in as a content creator uh

2024
03:33:36,760 --> 03:33:44,080
this is not financial advice this is not financial advice
but i put my money investing in my channel because i know

2025
03:33:44,080 --> 03:33:55,640
this is not for too long in terms of like my future and like
i want to be able to experience this as much as I can before

2026
03:33:55,640 --> 03:33:58,340
I, you know, can't do the internet stuff anymore.

2027
03:33:59,360 --> 03:34:07,440
So, obviously, I want to be able to reinvest all this to
experience all the things I never got, I would never be able

2028
03:34:07,440 --> 03:34:11,720
to experience if it was like 20 or 30 years in the line I'd
never be able to experience this.

2029
03:34:11,860 --> 03:34:16,740
So I want to reinvest this in my channel to be able to do
all these things that I've never got to do before.

2030
03:34:18,340 --> 03:34:22,060
And, because like, I have a friend that keeps fucking
bugging me to fucking buy a house.

2031
03:34:26,080 --> 03:34:38,340
one of my friends was like please use that money to buy a
house and i'm like no no i'm gonna pay an animator to make

2032
03:34:38,340 --> 03:34:40,520
another toky bites animation

2033
03:34:45,340 --> 03:34:59,120
so um so that's my opinion i i know i should I know I should
buy something instead of renting

2034
03:35:02,320 --> 03:35:08,500
Okay Okay Alian thank you for the super chat Thank you think
Which part of content creation do you struggle with How do

2035
03:35:08,500 --> 03:35:16,060
you get past those roadblocks Interact socialize with people
outside of just streaming I'm so bad at that I'm really bad

2036
03:35:16,060 --> 03:35:21,380
on like Twitter socialization And just socializing with
people I like talking to people Like

2037
03:35:24,520 --> 03:35:33,820
what did I say I like talking to people like in a call but I
hate talking to people on messaging stuff I don't know like

2038
03:35:33,820 --> 03:35:39,600
I rather like I think this is why like whenever I get a call
with somebody having like message in a while we would talk

2039
03:35:39,600 --> 03:35:45,920
for hours we would talk for like four plus hours I remember
like I haven't talked to this one person in a while and then

2040
03:35:45,920 --> 03:35:52,660
like when we got in a call we would just like play a video
game and just talk for like four plus hours and then we're

2041
03:35:52,660 --> 03:35:59,340
like oh fuck wait we broke busy tomorrow we should go to
sleep we it'll be like four or five a.m or something it'll

2042
03:35:59,340 --> 03:36:07,040
be like five a.m and we're like oh shit oh my god wait oh
fuck okay we we should sleep because we both have a busy

2043
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:13,500
workday like stuff like that like i i don't like just
messaging i like to be in a call with somebody because

2044
03:36:13,500 --> 03:36:22,660
that's majority of how i like to interact with people um i'm
just not like a person that like socialize via message and

2045
03:36:22,660 --> 03:36:28,680
that's like one of the hardest part because that's how you
network a lot of networking is done via socializing on

2046
03:36:28,680 --> 03:36:38,820
messages but i've done more network i i personally feel like
i've made more progress networking just talking to people on

2047
03:36:38,820 --> 03:36:41,000
like on the call like

2048
03:36:45,900 --> 03:36:54,700
bob thank you for the super chat thank you thank you please
buy a house here house fun thank you next thing thank you

2049
03:36:54,700 --> 03:37:01,480

very happy to see your more financially secure long term

2050
03:37:01,480 --> 03:37:09,300
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you all right
guys i'm gonna answer uh two more questions and then i'm

2051
03:37:09,300 --> 03:37:17,580
gonna call it here chat i'm gonna i'm gonna call it here uh
i'll answer Two more questions for you guys.

2052
03:37:18,020 --> 03:37:18,960
If you guys have any.

2053
03:37:20,160 --> 03:37:20,180
Cool.

2054
03:37:22,500 --> 03:37:24,560
Questions I haven't answered before.

2055
03:37:26,180 --> 03:37:27,160
Let's see.

2056
03:37:27,880 --> 03:37:29,980
Let me see real quick if there's anything.

2057
03:37:32,820 --> 03:37:39,000
Also, if you're a content creator, I know like it's a lot of
people are like, ew.

2058
03:37:39,500 --> 03:37:42,580
But like if you're a content creator, get Twitter blue.

2059
03:37:43,840 --> 03:37:44,440
It's...

2060
03:37:44,440 --> 03:37:45,260
You have to.

2061
03:37:48,080 --> 03:37:54,200
I know it sucks, but, like, as a content creator, you have
to.

2062
03:37:56,620 --> 03:37:59,600
It's actually, like, really good.

2063
03:38:08,420 --> 03:38:15,880
Uh, because, like, first off, the, what was it, editing your
post and being able to tweet really long tweets?

2064
03:38:15,900 --> 03:38:16,900
is really good.

2065
03:38:17,160 --> 03:38:25,720
It's just, it sucks that that is like a bot service, but
like it's being able to make long tweets and being able to

2066
03:38:25,720 --> 03:38:30,480
post longer videos as well as editing your tweets is just a
really, really helpful thing to have.

2067
03:38:31,320 --> 03:38:40,420
And I know it sucks, but like it's a good investment in the
long run as a content creator, as a content creator.

2068
03:38:41,280 --> 03:38:44,500
Um, great.

2069
03:38:44,520 --> 03:38:45,460
Thank you for the super chat.

2070
03:38:45,900 --> 03:38:51,680
you uh and this will be my last question that i'll answer
thank you so much for the stream it's been incredibly

2071
03:38:51,680 --> 03:39:04,430
educational how do you balance doing things out of passion
versus because they're what's good for your growth um you

2072
03:39:04,430 --> 03:39:14,590
have to sacrifice things to grow like you have to be able to
uh be able to sacrifice of course you still sprinkle there's

2073
03:39:14,590 --> 03:39:19,450
a seven days in a week right you do something you're
passionate about in like half the week and it's something

2074
03:39:19,450 --> 03:39:29,890
you know it's what i do i have a fomo game like once a week
at least or at most once a week there is a fomo game in the

2075
03:39:29,890 --> 03:39:38,210
schedule like climbing or something or like supermarket
simulator because that is the game of the week um it's fun

2076
03:39:38,210 --> 03:39:50,410
it's fun but like obviously like how some of them is like
purposely games you know like the fucking climbing game it's

2077
03:39:50,410 --> 03:40:01,650
fun for the viewers and it's fun to watch this streamer
suffer so it's like you know sacrifices have to be made it's

2078
03:40:01,650 --> 03:40:09,610
more so of like you have seven days of a week you didn't
obviously balance the stuff you're passionate about versus

2079
03:40:09,610 --> 03:40:20,070
the stuff that you want to grow with and you have to be able
to sacrifice that to grow in whatever what you want and uh

2080
03:40:20,070 --> 03:40:26,450
and that's like the risk you have to take there's so many
risks you have to take in content creation streaming is a

2081
03:40:26,450 --> 03:40:34,850
risk and you have to be ready to take these risks uh but yes
that would be my last question of the day I hope this stream

2082
03:40:34,850 --> 03:40:45,890
was informative um and that you were able to learn a little
bit and that other vtubers are able to you know figure out

2083
03:40:45,890 --> 03:40:53,430
what they want with what they want with what they want to
stream and stuff like that i hope this might be like my only

2084
03:40:53,430 --> 03:40:59,730
time i actually was talking death about all of this so uh i
hope it was still important there's obviously a lot of

2085
03:40:59,730 --> 03:41:08,110
things i could have said there's obviously a lot more things
i could give insight on um but i hope that what i gave you

2086
03:41:08,110 --> 03:41:18,650
guys was enough to help you in some way and i a lot about
content creation.

2087
03:41:20,790 --> 03:41:24,770
Anything I want to say is that you always want to keep eyes
on you.

2088
03:41:25,310 --> 03:41:37,930
The reason why I was able to grow fast and big, before you
know, as Doki, was because I did things that I was super

2089
03:41:37,930 --> 03:41:45,590
passionate about and I love streaming and I loved being
involved in the community and I love being involved outside

2090
03:41:45,590 --> 03:41:46,370
of just VTubing.

2091
03:41:47,650 --> 03:41:56,570
I try to network outside beyond V-tubing And that's And I
try to do a lot of things I want to be involved in as many

2092
03:41:56,570 --> 03:42:04,250
things as possible And that is like one of the biggest
things We're growing Is that you want to be You want to be

2093
03:42:04,250 --> 03:42:14,130
like everywhere type deal You want to be like everywhere So
people will know, recognize you And I also organized a lot

2094
03:42:14,130 --> 03:42:19,570
of events and projects That kept the momentum going and
stuff.

2095
03:42:19,890 --> 03:42:22,230
I was willing to reinvest in my channel.

2096
03:42:23,370 --> 03:42:31,350
If you're willing to reinvest in your channel and know what
your strongest suit are, that is the best way to grow, in my

2097
03:42:31,350 --> 03:42:31,810
opinion.

2098
03:42:34,330 --> 03:42:36,670
And I knew how the algorithm worked.

2099
03:42:37,870 --> 03:42:40,090
I knew what would grow a channel.

2100
03:42:40,730 --> 03:42:43,890
And I knew what would benefit the algorithm.

2101
03:42:46,490 --> 03:42:55,130
The moment you realize what makes the algorithm works Is
when you realize how you can get bigger as a If you hit that

2102
03:42:55,130 --> 03:43:06,730
boost, the initial boost That's when you know what can keep
you going Um Um, but yeah Think long term It's not about

2103
03:43:06,730 --> 03:43:17,390
short term It's all about long term Because like planning
some of these things Might take a long time But the

2104
03:43:17,390 --> 03:43:21,410
long-term effects is, like, so beneficial.

2105
03:43:22,370 --> 03:43:24,530
Because sometimes my projects take a long time to plan.

2106
03:43:25,290 --> 03:43:32,010
But I know the moment I would upload it, or the moment I do
it, I know people are going to like it.

2107
03:43:32,470 --> 03:43:33,390
Because I put...

2108
03:43:33,390 --> 03:43:39,150
It's like, it's like, you know, when AAA companies rush a
game for Christmas, and you can tell it's rushed.

2109
03:43:39,690 --> 03:43:45,450
You can tell it's, like, super rushed, and, like, oh, like,
oh, you didn't put their real heart and soul into it.

2110
03:43:46,490 --> 03:43:52,810
that took like years to develop and like they clearly put a
lot of investment into it and stuff like that like that's

2111
03:43:52,810 --> 03:44:00,410
like the best comparison i can make regarding this like
don't be afraid to invest long term versus short term

2112
03:44:00,410 --> 03:44:11,730
because um if you believe in something enough then like and
like you know logically that this when you announce it or

2113
03:44:11,730 --> 03:44:12,970
like when you actually put

2114
03:44:16,490 --> 03:44:24,910
that this is what viewers want so like don't be afraid to
reinvest for long term type deal um and that's like really

2115
03:44:24,910 --> 03:44:39,030
how i felt like helped me a lot to grow the way i did before
i came back as an indie um and uh no being creative i know

2116
03:44:39,030 --> 03:44:47,890
where i'm i'm producer my role is majority as a producer i
have lots of ideas and i help and i provide these ideas for

2117
03:44:47,890 --> 03:44:49,070
people to make it into reality.

2118
03:44:49,490 --> 03:44:52,990
There are some people who are gifted in actually creating it
themselves.

2119
03:44:53,450 --> 03:44:54,950
Know where your strong suits are.

2120
03:44:55,570 --> 03:45:02,510
I know I don't have a lot of skills creating stuff in
general, but I know that I have lots of ideas that I know

2121
03:45:02,510 --> 03:45:03,950
how to make it reality.

2122
03:45:04,690 --> 03:45:06,550
Know what I want to make it in reality.

2123
03:45:06,930 --> 03:45:08,810
