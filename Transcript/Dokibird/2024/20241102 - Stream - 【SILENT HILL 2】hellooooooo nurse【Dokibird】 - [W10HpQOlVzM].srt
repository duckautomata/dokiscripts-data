00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,060
Hello, everybody!

2
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,380
I'm still eating, by the way.

3
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,440
I'm so... Sorry, dad's gonna be barking because he's in baby jail right now.

4
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,300
Because he knows I have lasagna.

5
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,660
By the way, I'm eating my lasagna.

6
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,980
All right, so, story time.

7
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,140
It's a very short story.

8
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,640
Remember how I ordered two lasagnas?

9
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,280
Well, I accidentally ordered three lasagnas.

10
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,180
I didn't want to post a picture because I was like a little embarrassed.

11
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,760
I was like, oh, maybe three is a little too many to show on my public Twitter.

12
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,800
So, I know there's not a lot of people watching Silent Hill because I'm like, oh, my god.

13
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,620
All right, there's a PA testing system.

14
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,200
Oh, my god.

15
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,480
Sorry, I didn't realize.

16
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,520
I don't know if they ended it because I suddenly heard a breathing from the PA.

17
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,760
So, apparently, there's PA testing.

18
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:49,080
I came home from dance lessons and then there's been a PA test system for the last 30 minutes.

19
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
It comes in randomly.

20
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,420
I don't know how long they've been testing this fucking PA system, but they always be like, I don't know what they're going to say.

21
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,920
So, I mute myself because I don't know what they're going to say.

22
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm worried they're like, PA testing and blah blah blah.

23
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,640
I'm like, vlog, I don't need that.

24
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,620
So, every time I hear the ping, I just mute it because I was like, I don't know.

25
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,920
I was like, do I wait until the PA system is over and then do the stream?

26
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,520
But I don't know when it ends.

27
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,500
They've been doing this for like six times already.

28
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,540
Since I got back from dance lessons, I know I'm eating lasagna right after dance lessons.

29
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,500
Like, I'm filling up the carbs I lost from dancing.

30
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,480
Yeah, I'm so healthy.

31
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,040
So, yeah, I accidentally ordered three lasagnas instead of two.

32
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,920
I didn't say anything.

33
00:06:52,180 --> 00:07:02,780
I didn't post a picture because I was a little embarrassed because I was like, okay, two was like, hee hee and then I realized if I show three lasagnas, people are going to be like, she has a problem.

34
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,380
So, that's when you're like, wait, I think that's a problem.

35
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,980
So, I started three because I actually double tapped on one of the lasagna.

36
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,720
I double tapped on one of them.

37
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,320
So, I didn't check the, you know, I was doing it on stream.

38
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,220
So, I wasn't, you know, I wouldn't, I wasn't really paying attention because I was doing it on stream.

39
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,700
So, I didn't realize I accidentally tapped twice on one of the other lasagnas.

40
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,920
So, not only did I had jalapeno, jalapeno poppers and mozzarella sticks, I had three lasagnas.

41
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,640
So, yes, I've been eating.

42
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,700
I've been trying to get rid of all the excess food.

43
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,840
You know, when I said I'm gonna become a joke field, I didn't realize that this extends off stream as well.

44
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,320
I didn't know how committed I was gonna be to the bit, but now I don't even think it's a bit anymore.

45
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,220
I think, I think it has seeped into real life.

46
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,840
It's gotten too, it's gotten too real.

47
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,080
Chat, Mondays, am I right, guys?

48
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,380
Oh, Mondays.

49
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,120
We'll have new emotes.

50
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,060
Um, we actually have five new emotes, but I haven't uploaded the other three yet, because we're gonna be doing the great calling.

51
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,980
We're gonna be eliminating some of our old emotes to fit in the new emotes.

52
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,980
So, we're gonna be doing that at the end of the stream.

53
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:48,060
So, um, this is your chance to vote on which emote we're gonna send off the island to fit in the three new emotes.

54
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:57,980
Um, because we reached the limit, like, it doesn't matter how many gifted memberships or how many new members join in, we've reached the YouTube limit when it comes to emotes.

55
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,600
So, because we reached the limit, we actually have to get rid of some old emotes to fit in, um, to fit in the new ones.

56
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:12,000
Um, and after that, we also have, uh, I think we also have five more emotes coming in as well.

57
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,720
So, we have to call, we have to purge again after.

58
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,660
There's gonna be two purges happening.

59
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,160
Not the second one, the second set won't be here soon.

60
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:39,160
Um, so, uh, we're gonna be purging the first set of emotes and then the second set, you have time to, you have time to love, you have time to spend your time with your loved one, with your loved emotes, uh, before it's their turn to get purged.

61
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,460
Um, it's not a Hunger Games scenario where, like, one of them's gonna survive.

62
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,540
Uh, they're all, they're gonna get purged.

63
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,600
So, uh, five, six, seven, eight emotes will be purged.

64
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,520
So, this is your time to spend time with the ones you love the most.

65
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,360
Uh, Fiction, thank you for the super chat.

66
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,420
Thank you, thank you.

67
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,540
Um, I just got paid so I can continue our conversation for you to play Spec Ops The Line and the alternate way to play is a physical copy?

68
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,480
Wait, on, like, what console?

69
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,600
What console though?

70
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,680
Thank you for the super chat.

71
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
Thank you, thank you.

72
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:22,260
You know, the one game I will actually buy a physical copy for is Minecraft, um, the Minecraft Telltale series.

73
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:32,520
I will buy a physical copy for that, like, because it can't be PC because, uh, I don't have a CD, I don't have a CD-ROM thing on my PC.

74
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,020
Um, I can't finish this lasagna.

75
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,060
Someone wanted me to give a lasagna review.

76
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,900
Which one was better?

77
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,200
The one with meatballs was surprisingly better.

78
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,840
Um, I actually liked the one with meatballs the most.

79
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,920
Um, it just had, I don't know, it was just better.

80
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,980
They both looked really different and the one with meatballs was the one with 2,000 reviews versus the 50 reviews one.

81
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,940
Um, I don't know.

82
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,340
I'm eating the one with the, I think also right now, I didn't try both.

83
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:10,520
I didn't try both because I was like, which one do I want to eat for, like, the day after, you know, which one do I want to eat post Doki field?

84
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,760
And then I tried both of them and I like the meatball version better.

85
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:21,200
Um, I didn't eat a little bit of the other one, the one with 50 reviews, and I was like, it's not, it's all right.

86
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,400
And then now I'm eating the one with 50 reviews right now.

87
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,840
And I don't know if it's because I, oh my god.

88
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:40,280
Still, they're testing the, oh my god, like, they're testing the fire alarm, but I'm like, I'll just die in the fire.

89
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,480
I'm like, why is it still going?

90
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,260
Doki, no!

91
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,540
I'm done, Doki.

92
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm just like, please.

93
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,480
Why does it, it's been going on for like an hour now.

94
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,560
I'll go down with this shit.

95
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,120
Um, Arthas, thank you for the super chat.

96
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,340
Thank you, thank you.

97
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,840
Um, I think you're taking this Garfield roleplay too far.

98
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,860
Thank you for the super chat.

99
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,060
Thank you, thank you.

100
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,520
Okay, we just got back from dance classes.

101
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,320
Um, it's a very intense dance I'm learning, um, for one of the songs.

102
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:37,180
And like, um, um, they were like, uh, they were like, oh, uh, the teacher was like, uh, this is a different teacher, by the way.

103
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:44,560
Because I have two different teachers for different songs, because like, I don't want to get like, my head like, explode and stuff.

104
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,380
So for this teacher, I didn't dox myself this time, so she doesn't know who I am.

105
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,140
This time, I didn't dox myself for this one.

106
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,460
Um, anyway, I was like, oh yeah, I have to do a concert.

107
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:07,080
And, um, she was like, oh yeah, um, like, um, because I told her like, I don't know how to dance.

108
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,900
Like, I was, she was like, okay, we're gonna, she went to my set teaching like, a total beginner.

109
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,220
And she was like, and then while we were learning to dance, she was like, are you sure you don't dance?

110
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,640
And I was like, no, I was like, because she's like, you're doing really, you're learning really fast.

111
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,840
Are you sure you don't, are you, you've never danced before, or you don't dance?

112
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:33,480
I was like, well, last year, I did dance lessons for a concert.

113
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,820
And it's so, so she was like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

114
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,800
Or maybe, but I still don't dance.

115
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,680
I was like, but I still don't dance though.

116
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,700
And so she was like, oh, oh, it's because you're like, you do like singing, right?

117
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,100
You, you're musically inclined.

118
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,060
So like, you understand the rhythm.

119
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:03,140
And I was like, well, I'm not a singer either.

120
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,600
Oh, my fucking God.

121
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,020
That one was a fast one.

122
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,660
Okay, so.

123
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,340
She was like, oh, okay.

124
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,620
Like, I was, I was like, no, I'm not singing either.

125
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,820
Like, my, the one I'm, I'm doing the concert with, like, she's the singer, dancer.

126
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm just there.

127
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,000
And she's like, oh, okay.

128
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,600
Well, you're such a fast learner.

129
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,200
Like, oh, my gosh, you learn really fast for someone who doesn't dance.

130
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
And I was like, oh, thank you.

131
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,360
I really appreciate that.

132
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,980
But yeah, I indoxed myself to this teacher.

133
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,020
So like, we're safe.

134
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,580
She's not judging me with my lasagna.

135
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,240
She doesn't know about my lasagna.

136
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,960
Damn.

137
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,160
I've had my ego filled for a little bit.

138
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,600
Oh, I want to eat the cheese off of this.

139
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,180
All right, guys, I am stalling.

140
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,480
But I actually have a good excuse to stall though.

141
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,120
Like, I am, I am allowed to stall.

142
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,100
I didn't eat my food yet.

143
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,440
I am allowed to stall this time.

144
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,340
Okay, anyway, so we're gonna be playing.

145
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,740
Oh, wait, did they post this today?

146
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,220
Oh, shit.

147
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,660
Okay, give me.

148
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,100
Okay, apparently.

149
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,360
Okay, I am gonna post it today.

150
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,840
Okay, there's gonna be an announcement today about something.

151
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,060
But I'm waiting until they post it.

152
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,420
Um, I just received a discord message.

153
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,320
So like, maybe they'll post it while I'm streaming.

154
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,040
That'll be cool.

155
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,560
Anyway, Arthur, thank you for the super chat.

156
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,140
Thank you, thank you.

157
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,260
Every time I hear that thing, I keep thinking your lasagna is done.

158
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,060
Thank you for the super chat.

159
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,800
Thank you, thank you.

160
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,100
Well, I hope it gets posted today because I just freaking talked about it a little bit.

161
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,760
I'll be like, there's something coming up today.

162
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,060
Well, I'm not posting it.

163
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,320
Somebody else is posting it.

164
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,980
So I don't know if it's gonna.

165
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,340
I don't know.

166
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,160
They're like, maybe.

167
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,880
Okay, I'm done with my lasagna.

168
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,700
Well, I'm not done.

169
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,340
But it's a lot.

170
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,440
It's a lot of lasagna.

171
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,120
Anyway, so enough procrastinating, enough stalling.

172
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,120
We're about to play part 534 of Silent Hill 2.

173
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,120
I have no idea how many, how long we're gonna be on the silent.

174
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,620
I'm so sorry, God of War.

175
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,100
I didn't know it was gonna take that long.

176
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,260
I was looking at the original Silent Hill game and the original Silent Hill game was like, you know, 10 hours.

177
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,960
So I was like, oh, that's fine.

178
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,240
10 hours, that's fine.

179
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:11,280
And I looked at it, I looked at the remastered, and the remastered one is like, way longer, apparently.

180
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,940
It's way long.

181
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,300
It's like, you know, nobody, no, it's like longer.

182
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,780
So I was like, oh, fuck.

183
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,740
Okay, that, that's awkward.

184
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,640
Because the only reason why I decided not to go back to God of War was that, oh, maybe the Silent Hill one will be super quick.

185
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,660
And then we'll go back to God of War because I didn't want to do God of War.

186
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,140
And Wukong backed it back because it felt very similar.

187
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,080
So I was just like, oh, it's fine.

188
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,840
But it wasn't fine.

189
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,080
It's, it wasn't fine.

190
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,600
I'm pretty sure everybody else has finished Silent Hill 2 already.

191
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,420
And I'm still doing my, I'm still, I'm still there.

192
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,520
I'm...

193
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,380
We're still in it.

194
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,820
We're still there playing Silent Hill 2.

195
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,420
Also, I'm playing in the morning now because, like, we're getting to the nurses.

196
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,300
And I heard it gets a lot scarier when we're at the nurses part.

197
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,460
So I was like, yeah.

198
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
It's morning hours now.

199
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,160
We're doing the morning, we're doing the morning shift now.

200
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,280
All right.

201
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,540
Hello, nurse!

202
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
We're Silent Hill 2.

203
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
All right, there you go.

204
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,880
Let me boot up Silent Hill 2 now.

205
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,280
I didn't even boot up the game, guys.

206
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,900
I was not, I'm mentally not there anymore.

207
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,000
Oh my god, where the fuck did I put... All right, Silent Hill 2.

208
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,000
I have, like, the sound configured for it and everything, too.

209
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,980
All right.

210
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,060
Oh my god.

211
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,680
Okay.

212
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,620
Sorry, I just need to...

213
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,020
I'm just mentally getting ready.

214
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,640
D-Dragon, thank you for the superchat.

215
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,700
Thank you, thank you.

216
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,520
Been replaying the OG because of your streams.

217
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,380
Did you know, Doki, that you wasted bullets against PyramidHead?

218
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,820
As you could have just waited the fight out and he would just walk out without a fight.

219
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,380
Oh, no, I know I did.

220
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,420
I was, like, the second try.

221
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,980
The first try, I was shooting him.

222
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,860
The second, the first try, I was shooting him and then you guys were yelling at me.

223
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,360
I was like, why?

224
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,660
And then after that, I was like, oh, the second try, I didn't shoot him.

225
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,420
I only shot him for, like, funsies because I felt like it.

226
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,140
I sort of forgot the controls, too.

227
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,680
It's been a while.

228
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,060
It has been quite a while.

229
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,320
So, I definitely forgot the controls.

230
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Okay, and then...

231
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,820
Oh, yeah, you're still here.

232
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,340
Oh, fuck, I almost forgot Lady.

233
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,360
Hello, Lady.

234
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,400
Oh, my gosh, I actually forgot where I am.

235
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,120
Like, actually.

236
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,700
Okay, um, I'm gonna remember how to get anywhere.

237
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,760
Okay, all right, and then this is the dodge.

238
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,720
Okay, there we go.

239
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,580
All right, time to shoot some nurses.

240
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,860
Oh, fuck.

241
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,860
Okay, I remember now why I hated this game.

242
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,000
Okay, what did I unlock again?

243
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,120
I don't remember.

244
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,540
I don't remember.

245
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,700
I don't remember what I unlocked.

246
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,660
Oh, fuck.

247
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,180
Okay.

248
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,820
Okay, not this, obviously.

249
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,100
All right, I'm okay.

250
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,440
Oh, my god.

251
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,280
Okay, I don't remember where to go.

252
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,780
Oh, the bathroom time.

253
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,640
Maybe it's bathroom time.

254
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,500
Surely, there's nothing bad in the bathroom.

255
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,540
There's never anything bad.

256
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,060
Guys, how do I heal again before I move on?

257
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,680
How do I- Oh, she doesn't come with me to the boy- men's bathroom?

258
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,560
So polite.

259
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,600
I think she thought that I was gonna use the bathroom.

260
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,020
All right, guys, how do I heal again before I go in and just cry?

261
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,240
Before I- I- oh, my god.

262
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,860
I hate you so much.

263
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,600
Before I- I'm feeling addicted with the 10 gifted ships that you take.

264
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,500
Okay, here we go.

265
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,180
No, okay.

266
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,180
Well, it's not this one.

267
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,620
It's clearly not this door.

268
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,600
I don't know which where to go.

269
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

270
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,320
Oh, why is everything so dark?

271
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,420
Where do I go?

272
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,140
Do I go here?

273
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,500
Where do I go?

274
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,660
It's been a while.

275
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,640
Okay, um.

276
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,300
Oh, why is it circled?

277
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,680
Oh,

278
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,840
do I go there?

279
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,840
Is it here?

280
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,800
Guys, is it- oh, please.

281
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,840
Is it here?

282
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,160
Why did nobody play the electric build?

283
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,080
Oh, I just- Guys, where do I go?

284
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,460
Do I go here?

285
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,760
Where do I go here?

286
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,740
Where is it?

287
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,800
Guys!

288
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,700
Okay, do I have keys?

289
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,600
Guys, please, please, please, please.

290
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,640
I'll- I'll cry.

291
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,580
You don't want me to cry.

292
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,820
The elevator.

293
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,160
Okay.

294
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,120
Okay.

295
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,520
Two.

296
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,220
Two.

297
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,680
Oh, and- oh, she's here.

298
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,200
Okay.

299
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,360
Okay, guys.

300
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:50,680
I know everybody has- I know everybody has finished this game and I'm still here, guys.

301
00:24:51,320 --> 00:25:01,880
But, like, you're- you- even if I have one viewer left watching part 532 of Silent Hill 2, I'll still stream for that one viewer.

302
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,500
I'm doing for you, one viewer.

303
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,720
Even if we're still in the hospital at part 255, we're still gonna be here together.

304
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,380
We're still gonna be here in the hospital.

305
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,220
Oh, is this the nurse?

306
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,060
What's wrong?

307
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:46,070
It's gonna be 50 years and Doki will still be playing Silent Hill 2 and still be in that fucking hospital.

308
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,430
Is she okay?

309
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,510
Yeah, are you okay, ma'am?

310
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:04,870
From what?

311
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,610
We were- when did you drink?

312
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,210
Oh, earlier.

313
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,910
You had one- one cup.

314
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,090
Oh, I don't think you should tell her to sleep on that.

315
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,070
Bro.

316
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,270
Come- bro, I don't even- I think there's, like, bugs in that mattress.

317
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,910
There's bed bugs for sure.

318
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:39,850
No,

319
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,930
don't look at her.

320
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,910
She's- I know.

321
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,630
Don't look at her.

322
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,010
I know she's so sexy, but don't look at her.

323
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,430
Remember, James, you are a man of God.

324
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,090
Do not fall into temptation.

325
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,050
Don't look at this.

326
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,410
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

327
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,470
I know.

328
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,610
Don't look at her legs.

329
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,250
You guys can't see it, but don't look at her legs, James.

330
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,630
Stay strong, James.

331
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,610
Fort Mary.

332
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,410
Back off, wench.

333
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,750
The fuck?

334
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,630
Where was- where was the elevator?

335
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,030
Oh, right here.

336
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:36,910
Oh, God.

337
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:43,050
Guys, would you blame me if I don't- I just never finish the game.

338
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,350
It's just- we have part 15 and then never again.

339
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,530
We never came back.

340
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,450
We- Oh, yeah, it's November, James!

341
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,930
November, James, don't do it!

342
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:04,270
Don't- he's trying to make James- don't fall into those temptations.

343
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,530
You'll be stronger without her.

344
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,430
Wouldn't that be funny?

345
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,710
If just suddenly- if I just- if like- Actually, no.

346
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,570
If I just like come back to the game every like couple of weeks, it'll be like, all right, guys.

347
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,770
It's been two months.

348
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,190
Uh, welcome back to Solid Hill 2.

349
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:37,190
We're like- We're like every how- every October, we just- We stop the playthrough and then- And then on October, we come back.

350
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,290
We'll be like, all right, guys, we're back.

351
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,090
It's October.

352
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,630
You know what that means.

353
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,210
It's Solid Hill 2 again.

354
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,690
So annoying.

355
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,730
But I'll never do that to you guys.

356
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,870
I would never chat.

357
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:04,190
Now you're gonna think next week, will Doki come back to Solid Hill 2 next week?

358
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,750
Come and find out.

359
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,290
All right, nice.

360
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,410
We need our meds.

361
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,950
We need our meds.

362
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,850
All right, guys, I'm gonna take- get cough drop real quick.

363
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,570
I'll be right back.

364
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,770
I need to get some cough drops because I'm coughing again.

365
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,630
Oh, fuck.

366
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,050
Okay.

367
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,570
All right.

368
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:52,730
Okay.

369
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,350
Here we go.

370
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,970
At least cough drops let me stall a little bit more.

371
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,450
Here we go.

372
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,350
Okay.

373
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,250
I guess- oh, I guess I have to go that way.

374
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,410
I guess we go the other way, I guess.

375
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,830
Oh my god.

376
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,750
All right, here we go.

377
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,970
For real this time.

378
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,890
For real.

379
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,950
Oh, hey, what's this?

380
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,210
Leave the rest to us.

381
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,290
Oh, this is nurses.

382
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,290
I like how they scratched up her face.

383
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,050
Because they're like the fucked up nurses.

384
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,650
They're still hot because, you know, James is a fucking degenerate, but...

385
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,450
Oh, here we go.

386
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,370
Do we headshot the nurses or shoot them in the knees?

387
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,370
Guys, what is it?

388
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,830
Oh my god, I see a nurse and I'm ending a playthrough.

389
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,710
I'm joking, I won't end the playthrough.

390
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,190
I just- I won't feel good about it.

391
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,130
Oh, there she is.

392
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,670
Thank god she's so slow.

393
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,610
He did that!

394
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,630
Oh, shit!

395
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,510
Just to be sure.

396
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,290
Did he come back alive?

397
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,670
Guys, did he?

398
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,150
Hello, nurse.

399
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,190
She's into that.

400
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,870
Wait, guys, did he- did he come back alive?

401
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,530
You have to say- I didn't think they would start running!

402
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,530
I was like, oh, of course.

403
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:35,730
Oh.

404
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,810
Does she come back alive?

405
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,790
Oh my god.

406
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,350
Oh, there's too many...

407
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,070
Too many areas.

408
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,170
Hello?

409
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,690
Hello?

410
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:59,090
I don't want to waste bullets, please.

411
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,050
My bullets!

412
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,870
I don't want to waste my bullets!

413
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,860
I hear them!

414
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,140
I hear them!

415
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,330
That's the worst part!

416
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,110
Stop!

417
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:26,970
Stop!

418
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,830
Wait, how do I crawl?

419
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,050
I don't remember how to crawl.

420
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,150
Oh, hello.

421
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,990
I never crawl.

422
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,530
Oh, there they are.

423
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,960
I'm just gonna get rid of him first.

424
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Wow, fuck!

425
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh!

426
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,440
Okay, that's bullshit.

427
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,560
Like, there's three.

428
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,880
There's three!

429
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,480
I- Okay, that's fine.

430
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,820
That's fucked up.

431
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,580
There was three of them.

432
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,300
Like, what do I do?

433
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,500
There were three.

434
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,160
All right, at least there's no nurse.

435
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,840
I don't know if I can stagger the nurses.

436
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,640
If I could stagger the nurses, it'd be better.

437
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,340
Can you stagger nurses?

438
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,140
Because I don't want to waste my bullets.

439
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,900
I don't have a lot.

440
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,800
Can you?

441
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,500
With the- with the knee shots?

442
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,980
But with regular pistol.

443
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,280
Hello?

444
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,680
What is the other nurses?

445
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,420
Oh...

446
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,840
Eat her drawings.

447
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,580
The fuck?

448
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,220
That's just a fucking- those are bullet holes.

449
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,900
Okay, okay, so if I can stagger them with pistols, that's good.

450
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,260
That's good.

451
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,800
Okay, so I don't have to waste, uh, I don't know- because I don't know if I can stagger nurses.

452
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,360
So like, that's good to know.

453
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,020
God, get the fuck off.

454
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,060
Look at that.

455
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,340
Three against- three against one?

456
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,140
That's illegal.

457
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,280
Whoa.

458
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,730
Whoa.

459
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,310
Okay, let's see.

460
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,650
Oh, the nurse's station.

461
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,570
All right, maybe there's stuff in here.

462
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,170
Oh, yeah, no, my heart is not doing- all right, guys.

463
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:51,310
I wonder what the password could be.

464
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,600
Hmm.

465
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,980
The code has been reset to what we agreed on during yesterday's meeting in the doctor's lounge.

466
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,240
Uh...

467
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,620
Like I said, I don't want anyone writing it down on little pieces of paper for me to find.

468
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,240
Be responsible, people.

469
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,200
Oh, wait a minute.

470
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,080
Oh, god damn it.

471
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,800
Surely one of you guys are- God, you guys are typing random- you guys are typing random numbers!

472
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,460
You guys are typing random numbers that make it look so believable.

473
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,880
It looks so believable.

474
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,600
It looks so believable, too.

475
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,140
Wait.

476
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,480
God damn it, one of you will crack.

477
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,660
I know it.

478
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,180
Guys, if you guys give me the correct code...

479
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,200
I will shout out your name.

480
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,520
You get- you get the exposure.

481
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,780
Oh, imagine- whoa, tab!

482
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,500
Exposure!

483
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,340
One of you will crack.

484
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,660
I- I know it.

485
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,740
I know one of you is gonna crack right now.

486
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,120
There's no way.

487
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,300
You're-

488
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,520
One of you- it only takes one.

489
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,080
It literally only takes one dragoon to fuck it all up for everybody.

490
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,200
It literally only takes one dragoon!

491
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,240
One dragoon!

492
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,580
God fucking damn it.

493
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,580
You'll crack.

494
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,880
You'll crack.

495
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,160
I- I can feel- I can- One of you is gonna crack.

496
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,540
It's gonna happen.

497
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,840
I know it.

498
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,200
It's gonna happen.

499
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,140
You think you're so strong, but I know it only takes one dragoon to fuck it up for everybody.

500
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:10,820
All I need is one.

501
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,960
All I need is one weak little guy.

502
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,360
To be like, oh my god, I want Doki to give me a shout out.

503
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:21,960
Oh my god.

504
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,200
I will acknowledge you.

505
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:30,560
I will acknowledge you as a person if you give me the correct code right now, you will get acknowledgement.

506
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,080
Right now.

507
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Right here.

508
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,640
Right now.

509
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,960
Oh.

510
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,360
Oh.

511
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,760
It only takes one.

512
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,880
It only takes one.

513
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,360
One back- backseaters, come on!

514
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,660
Oh, I- Backseaters, I know you really want to give me the code, backseater.

515
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,980
Are you really gonna go against your training to not backseat me?

516
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,260
I'm just a- A dumb VTuber who needs to be guided.

517
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,600
Also, woe is me.

518
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,020
I don't know what the numbers are.

519
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,540
I'm just so stupid.

520
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,680
Oh, I'm so stupid.

521
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,720
Skill issue.

522
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,320
That's a fine bias.

523
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,920
All right, we saved.

524
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,700
I'm pretty sure I'm making this a longer playthrough by- by just standing there waiting to get the code.

525
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,000
Wait, what?

526
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,640
Oh, I have to exchange something.

527
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,420
Oh, I have to give him watches?

528
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
You can't tell time, you're ahead.

529
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,320
Uh, what?

530
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,540
What?

531
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,560
Sudden outburst of aggression, visceral, and I- what did I miss?

532
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,120
Water has common, it used to.

533
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,400
Initial- what?

534
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,600
What do I do with this?

535
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,340
What do I do with this information?

536
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,380
All right, what's this?

537
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,440
Delusions persist.

538
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,980
Um, sensory delusions, insomnia, refuses food and water, force feeding, and hydration.

539
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,940
Bathing required, sleep medication, constant surveillance.

540
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,360
Oh, that sucks, bro.

541
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,040
Okay, and then this one.

542
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,540
Um, move to lower floor.

543
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,540
Intense and unrelenting anxiety, symptoms have intensified into full-blown paranoia.

544
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,380
Increase in medication, can't be left alone.

545
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,640
Jesus Christ.

546
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,080
Okay.

547
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,460
All right.

548
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,580
Well, can't be left alone.

549
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,620
What do I do with him?

550
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,260
Wait, what do you mean by going far?

551
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,240
What does he mean by that?

552
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,180
What's he gonna do?

553
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,060
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

554
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,980
He's gonna do something.

555
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,860
Oh, what is he gonna do?

556
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,860
What do you mean by that?

557
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,760
Okay, it's this way.

558
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,500
I don't believe you guys anymore.

559
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,820
You have lost your backseating privileges now!

560
00:40:52,820 --> 00:41:01,340
Um, because of what you- because you guys are so stubborn, now I'll never let you backseat me again!

561
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,680
Unless...

562
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,940
you could, you know.

563
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,260
All I'm saying...

564
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,780
All I'm saying, you don't have to let that happen.

565
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,160
There's one way to fix that.

566
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,640
You know that hurts you more than it hurts me.

567
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,360
You know that, guys.

568
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,000
Okay.

569
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,220
Let's see.

570
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,700
There is...

571
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,560
I guess we go this way first, right?

572
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,060
Yeah.

573
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,180
Okay.

574
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,180
No, it- no, it doesn't.

575
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,200
Don't say that.

576
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,500
Alright, any crazy people in here?

577
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,160
Hello?

578
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,580
What's this?

579
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,640
Oh.

580
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,020
Fucking hell, a riddle?

581
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,900
Okay.

582
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,300
The following interview was conducted with blank in response to incident 071.

583
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,180
I remember lying in the water...

584
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,200
Empty, and then I felt him.

585
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,460
Felt him stare.

586
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,700
He was close.

587
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,080
Very close.

588
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,300
I had to get out.

589
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,620
Had to get away.

590
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,900
But he followed.

591
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,340
He kept staring.

592
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,880
So I made him stop.

593
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,440
Now I'm empty again.

594
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,120
Can we go back to the pool?

595
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, wait, did he kill somebody?

596
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,140
He must have killed somebody.

597
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,680
All right, I don't know what to do with that information, but okay.

598
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,280
I don't know what to do with that, but okay.

599
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,100
All right.

600
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,060
Count the words?

601
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:49,840
Is this a haiku?

602
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:49,980
Haiku?

603
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,160
Oh.

604
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,200
Hello?

605
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,700
Hello?

606
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,500
Oh, there has to be somebody here.

607
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,460
No way.

608
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,200
You're so predictable.

609
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,240
You're so fucking predictable.

610
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,920
You thought I was gonna go right side, but I saw this item first, which had nothing in it.

611
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,720
Which...

612
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,680
There was nothing in here, but I did see that item.

613
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,040
I did see it.

614
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,900
That's all that matters.

615
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,020
So fucking predictable.

616
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,080
You're just crying in the shower, don't you?

617
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,070
What?

618
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,270
You get that hit?

619
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:54,170
I got the shot off first!

620
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:55,650
Oh, well.

621
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,830
Good thing there's this medication I was looking at.

622
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,690
That's so bullshit.

623
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:07,670
I literally got... that should have given me one free hit right there.

624
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,690
What the fuck?

625
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,330
I mean, he's just gonna be down here.

626
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:12,670
Like, what?

627
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,810
Is he gonna bite my ankle?

628
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,670
Bro, get up the fucking floor, you idiot!

629
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,750
You're biting my fucking ankles?

630
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,410
Like, what are you gonna do down there?

631
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,570
Okay, these guys are so pathetic, not gonna lie.

632
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,710
Like, these guys specifically.

633
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,270
I shot first exactly!

634
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,510
I literally shot first!

635
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,710
Okay, we got a shortcut here.

636
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,810
All right, love tap.

637
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,490
All right, guys, we're back here!

638
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,930
One last chance, dragons!

639
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,090
One last chance!

640
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,730
Hey, how you guys make these so believable?

641
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,070
I'm struggling!

642
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,230
I knew it!

643
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,970
I knew you'd crack!

644
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:16,830
I fucking... I knew I'm gonna show you to the world!

645
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,250
I knew you guys!

646
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,230
I knew you'd crack!

647
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,690
You fucking idiots, I knew it!

648
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,110
I fucking knew it!

649
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,050
It takes one dragon to fuck it up for the rest of you guys!

650
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,470
It only takes one!

651
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,170
It only takes one!

652
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,290
Anyway, let's actually explore the other areas.

653
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:39,570
Shame!

654
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,070
Shame!

655
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,330
I'm fine, I'm a traitor.

656
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,130
It only takes one dragon to fuck it up for everybody else.

657
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,290
Whoa.

658
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,200
That scared the shit out of me!

659
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,040
I was like, where did that come from?

660
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,000
I thought that was in my game!

661
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,220
I was like, what was that?

662
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,140
You set it up for him to get turned off by the others, did you?

663
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,940
Thank you for the super chat!

664
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,120
Oh my god, that thing actually fucking freaked me out.

665
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,520
I thought it was like part of the game and I was like, what did I do?

666
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,500
But what did I do?

667
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,580
Did I fuck up?

668
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,880
What was that?

669
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,460
That shit actually scared me, holy fuck.

670
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,920
I was not expecting that.

671
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,380
Oh.

672
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,720
I told you guys.

673
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,880
One person.

674
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,680
I knew you guys were weak.

675
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,740
I knew dragoons can't be strong together.

676
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:18,000
I knew you guys won't be strong.

677
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,960
It only takes one.

678
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,820
Are you fucking-

679
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,480
We're doubting!

680
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,040
How many times do you need to test the fucking fire alarm?!

681
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,340
How many?

682
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,280
How many times?

683
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:03,680
How?

684
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:04,900
How?

685
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,480
Oh my god!

686
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,750
You just tested it!

687
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,490
What do you mean you had to test again?

688
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,290
What the fuck?

689
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,610
Jesus Christ.

690
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:40,890
Oh my god, she swings so fucking...

691
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,790
Oh, okay.

692
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,490
Maybe I should just do headshots.

693
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:52,230
I feel like- I feel like she- Yeah, I'm just gonna do headshots.

694
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,890
She takes way too much for melee.

695
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,370
Like three headshots is just better.

696
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,310
Three headshots.

697
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,650
I'm living in my own silent hill.

698
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,670
I'm actually- In my silent hill, they do fire alarms.

699
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:09,590
They do fire alarm testing.

700
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,590
24 times a day.

701
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,690
That's my personal hell.

702
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:20,730
How did they know?

703
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,530
How the fuck did they know?

704
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,270
The alarm means the other world is coming.

705
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:27,870
Run!

706
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,190
Thank you for the super shout out, a good user.

707
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:30,690
Thank you.

708
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,530
Thank you.

709
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,170
All right.

710
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,290
Oh nice, more ammo.

711
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,510
Thank fucking god.

712
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,010
I'm just gonna headshot the nurses.

713
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,830
Like it's just not worth it in general.

714
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,090
To like shoot them in the knees because headshot they die faster.

715
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,190
Okay.

716
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:55,070
We'll never figure out how to get when the puzzle for how we actually end up getting the code.

717
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,070
Oh my god.

718
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,150
Okay.

719
00:49:59,430 --> 00:49:59,990
Uh...

720
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,610
We go to the front first.

721
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,990
Anything over there?

722
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:05,010
No?

723
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,590
Okay.

724
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,850
Okay.

725
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:09,530
It's here.

726
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,670
Okay, there's loot here.

727
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,910
Oh, more shotgun for a gun I don't have.

728
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:18,490
That's cool.

729
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:20,170
What's this?

730
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,990
Oh, this has to be like from the previous games, right?

731
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:24,950
It has to be it.

732
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,130
Oh my god, I swear to god if the alarm- if the fucking alarm goes off one more time, I swear to fucking god.

733
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,270
I'm back to Silent Hill.

734
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,690
I feel so immersed right now being trapped here.

735
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,450
Okay.

736
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,070
Truly is so immersive.

737
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,130
Oh, hello?

738
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:49,670
Hello?

739
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:51,610
Hello?

740
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:51,770
Hello?

741
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,640
Okay, there's a teddy bear.

742
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,520
Whose teddy is this?

743
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,800
Whose bear is this?

744
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,120
Oh?

745
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,440
Somebody stashed something in you?

746
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,940
What do you have inside you, Mr. Bear?

747
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,020
What is it?

748
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,460
A fucking needle?

749
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,680
I could literally make this myself.

750
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:18,720
Like...

751
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,980
I'm pretty sure there's like needles everywhere around the floor.

752
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,980
Do I- do I really need this needle from a fucking bear?

753
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,600
Like I could just look at the- what the- oh I thought- Oh, there it is!

754
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,060
Nice.

755
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,940
Never using that gun.

756
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,860
Only using that gun in a boss fight and never again.

757
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,880
Okay, press two.

758
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:43,860
Whatever.

759
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,060
I don't need- I don't need to use the shotgun.

760
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,360
Guys.

761
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:48,920
Shotgun.

762
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:49,680
Oh my god.

763
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,320
I only have that much ammo.

764
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,200
All right, never fucking using that for sure.

765
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,220
That's a waste of- that's a waste of ammo.

766
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,440
Okay.

767
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,860
Off we go.

768
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,650
How did you get back here?

769
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:10,570
Go to my left?

770
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,150
Okay, no.

771
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:13,890
Whoa!

772
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:19,430
There we go.

773
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,790
I was like, what the fuck?

774
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:23,910
How did you run so fa- oh wait, I'm lost.

775
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,390
She- she disoriented me.

776
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:28,430
Okay.

777
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,550
Oh, nurse's lounge.

778
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,570
Which way should I go?

779
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,490
Uh, maybe I should go this way first.

780
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,890
I think she planted John, so we turned on each other.

781
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,390
He wasn't even ready.

782
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,870
Thank you for the super chat.

783
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:43,370
Thank you.

784
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:44,190
Thank you.

785
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,250
Okay, is there anybody here?

786
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:49,650
Fucking hell.

787
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:54,030
I'm like so- My anxiety is so high right now.

788
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,050
Oh.

789
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,190
Oh.

790
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,750
Oh my god.

791
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:08,230
John.

792
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:10,590
John!

793
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:15,530
If I yell out John's name, he'll get less scared.

794
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,070
John!

795
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,210
I'm fucking- I hate- I hate it here.

796
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:52,230
I hate- I hate- I- It's so- Stop!

797
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,870
Like, I don't understand!

798
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,890
What are they testing?

799
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:59,670
What are they even testing at this point?

800
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:01,750
Like, it works!

801
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,490
It has work in the past hour!

802
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,150
It's worked the past hour!

803
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,930
What is there not to work?

804
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,490
This is abuse.

805
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,930
I'll talk to the fire department after this.

806
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,170
What the fuck?

807
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,110
I hear something.

808
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,450
Oh shit, that's not- Okay.

809
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,670
I just wanted her to get a bit closer.

810
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:47,110
I- the true horror is to get stopped by your PA system.

811
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,030
Thank you for the super- Oh!

812
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,660
Like, oh my god!

813
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,000
They added something new this time!

814
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,780
Now it goes BRING instead!

815
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,520
They added something new to the mix!

816
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,900
Oh my god, they mixed it up!

817
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,820
What a mix-up!

818
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,240
What a- what a fucking mix-up!

819
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,780
Now it goes BRING!

820
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,680
Oh my fucking shit.

821
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,140
Like...

822
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,340
Oh my fucking god.

823
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,580
Get me out of my personal silent hill.

824
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,700
That mix-up is insane.

825
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,160
I was- that actually freaked me out.

826
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:15,400
The worst part is like, they stopped and then they went back to it?

827
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,960
Like...

828
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,940
I don't understand.

829
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:25,140
They just- they stopped the- the testing and then suddenly they just were like, oh fuck you, I guess.

830
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,380
Oh my god.

831
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,400
Okay, L1.

832
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,600
Where's L1?

833
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,480
Which is the L1 key?

834
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,740
There's L3 and L2.

835
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,920
Oh, there's L1.

836
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,960
Okay, we gotta go L1, I guess.

837
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,760
Okay, it's this way.

838
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:45,820
Okay.

839
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,020
All right.

840
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,640
The fucking mix-up was real.

841
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,340
That actually freaked me out because I didn't expect the fucking RING!

842
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,590
There's a nurse here, I can feel it.

843
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,770
There's no way they give this room to me for free.

844
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:07,570
There's no way.

845
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:08,810
That's impossible.

846
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,930
Not that this game isn't- oh, they did?

847
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,850
That's crazy.

848
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,570
They gave me this room for free?

849
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,770
There's no way.

850
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,590
They actually fell for me here?

851
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,350
My god, that's insane.

852
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:26,590
No, I don't have to fight my way to here?

853
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:30,290
Oh my god, guys.

854
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:31,990
There is hope.

855
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:40,630
Hello?

856
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:43,750
Hello?

857
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,120
What?

858
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,980
I don't- what?

859
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,080
Okay.

860
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:00,740
What?

861
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,120
What do I do with this?

862
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,020
I'm so scared.

863
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,820
Oh, I'm actually so scared right now.

864
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,620
Um, I'm gonna freak out.

865
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,180
I'm gonna actually freak out.

866
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,940
What do I do?

867
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,140
What do I do with this fucking cart?

868
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,840
Is there a thing I have to push it to?

869
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,580
Oh, it's here!

870
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,000
Okay.

871
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,260
Okay.

872
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:37,660
Oh my god, I swear to god, I swear it's like- Testing, whoa, testing, fire alarm, fire alarm.

873
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,320
I swear to god.

874
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,960
Oh, I fucking- I swear to god, I'm gonna- oh my god, I'm gonna go downstairs and I'm gonna be like, shut the fuck up.

875
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,280
Oh, I'm gonna cure it.

876
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,340
All right.

877
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,940
I'm here now.

878
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,780
Oh, nice.

879
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,940
What am I supposed to do with that information?

880
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,660
Let me just reload my gun just in case.

881
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,320
Just in case.

882
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,480
Just in case I don't feel safe.

883
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,360
Oh, the nurse has to be here.

884
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,580
That's where I heard the radio.

885
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:39,790
Here?

886
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,170
Oh, I don't like this.

887
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,290
It's so quiet.

888
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,200
Are you here?

889
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:52,240
Are you here?

890
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,640
Okay, that's fine.

891
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,060
That's fine.

892
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,840
That's fine.

893
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,400
That's fine.

894
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,140
I'm, I'm okay.

895
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,140
I'm okay, guys.

896
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

897
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,580
I'm okay.

898
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,100
Okay, I'm still okay.

899
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,760
I'm still okay.

900
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,720
I guess I'm still okay.

901
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,520
I guess.

902
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:40,600
Down I go.

903
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,520
Whee.

904
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,300
Whee.

905
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,290
All right, John.

906
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,810
Hello, crawling down deep holes.

907
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,230
Yeah, and possibly it's suffocating in there.

908
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,390
Seems so safe.

909
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,090
James only has good ideas.

910
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:07,710
That's right.

911
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,710
And that's why he stopped taking his meds.

912
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,870
Because his good ideas start running out.

913
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,710
If you take, if you stop taking your meds, then you'll...

914
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,550
Then you'll have, always have good ideas, guys.

915
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,310
Guys, disclaimer, please don't stop taking your meds.

916
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,730
You don't want to become just like James.

917
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:40,190
Guys, you don't, you don't want to be like him, guys.

918
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,680
Where am I?

919
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,880
Where is this place?

920
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,920
I am in... oh, I'm back here?

921
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,100
The fuck did I get here?

922
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,240
Oh, wait, how do I get back?

923
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,240
There's so many questions.

924
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,800
Why won't they help me?

925
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,840
Why do they keep me in here with him?

926
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,580
Wait, is that the little girl?

927
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,280
Are those notes from her?

928
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,120
Oh, oh, it's the typewriter!

929
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,340
Hey, that's Resident Evil.

930
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,200
Wait a minute, that's Resident Evil thing!

931
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,560
Unless Silent Hill has it too.

932
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,020
This is my first Silent Hill game.

933
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:33,550
What's this?

934
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:38,750
Where's this?

935
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,710
It's a marked bracelet.

936
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:44,750
Oh, it's a collectible.

937
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,410
Whoa, whoa.

938
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:52,950
Are the rats part of my Silent Hill 2?

939
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,170
Can you imagine?

940
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:58,250
The rats are part of my Silent Hill.

941
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,190
They're not even real rats.

942
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:01,750
They're not even...

943
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:07,290
Oh my God.

944
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:14,050
Oh my God, that's definitely not a rat.

945
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,790
That's definitely not a rat.

946
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,640
Well, at least we know.

947
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,820
Oh, it's one of the marked bracelets.

948
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,340
Oh, yeah, it's one of the bracelets!

949
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,300
Oh, fucking hell.

950
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,820
Okay, I'm okay.

951
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,720
Guys, no, this is not a good surprise.

952
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,300
Guys, I like happy surprises.

953
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,820
That was just like trauma.

954
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:45,640
That's just... it's just trauma, guys.

955
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,220
It's not... that's not a happy little surprise.

956
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,340
Do I just go... why?

957
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,140
Unlocked?

958
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,680
I guess I could just go...

959
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,500
Doctor's Lounge.

960
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,900
Can I go to the doctor?

961
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,960
I don't think I can.

962
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,400
Let's go back to the second floor.

963
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,440
Let's unlock that area.

964
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,500
It's a happy little accident, I guess.

965
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,860
God, I hate this game.

966
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,720
It's a good game, but God, it's... oh my God, this game freaks me out.

967
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,120
It's just too good.

968
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,780
It's just too good, guys.

969
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,400
It's just too good.

970
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,700
Is that pressing?

971
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,000
The elevator coming down, why is it still taking 50 years?

972
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,080
I don't understand.

973
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:58,680
Okay, we got one of the bracelets.

974
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:02,100
We got one of the bracelets.

975
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,440
Hm.

976
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,200
Okay, you guys want to know which one I prefer?

977
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,040
I definitely prefer Resident Evil more because...

978
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,920
because I... I have a gun and the guns actually do something.

979
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,920
Are you fucking serious?

980
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,280
You got back up?

981
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:24,720
Bro.

982
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,660
I think she likes it when I shoot her in the head.

983
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,160
It's just understandable, like it's her head.

984
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,820
There you go.

985
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,460
I mean, like I get it.

986
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,360
It's your head, like you need it to do things, but like you're blocking the way.

987
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,500
It's literally self-defense at that point.

988
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,460
It's literally self-defense.

989
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,060
I'm just trying to defend myself.

990
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Okay, we got one of them.

991
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,300
Oh, fuck, okay.

992
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,970
Let me go this way.

993
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:10,110
Oh my god, go here.

994
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,810
Wait, what?

995
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:17,850
There's nothing in here.

996
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,590
Wait, what?

997
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,110
Wait, what?

998
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:25,030
Wait, what?

999
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:25,990
Wait, what?

1000
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:26,610
Open the door.

1001
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:30,150
Wait, she's back up?

1002
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,110
How?

1003
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:34,930
How?

1004
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:35,630
How?

1005
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,500
You got shot in the- wait, no, this is a different nurse.

1006
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,860
Where did you come from?

1007
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,080
All right, I don't know how we got this code, but like we're here.

1008
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,620
All right.

1009
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:02,020
Oh, they feed me garbage and rot in me.

1010
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,320
Crawling with maggots, thick with sinew.

1011
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,620
They make me bite down.

1012
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,300
The juice is red and yellow.

1013
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,080
Hit the back of my throat.

1014
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,540
I choke and I gag.

1015
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,880
And I vomit.

1016
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,400
Until my throat is sore.

1017
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,720
An aching, throbbing tube of flesh.

1018
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,500
I push it all out, but I can still taste it.

1019
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,460
Oh my god, that's fucking gross.

1020
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,800
Oh my god.

1021
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,160
That's a problem.

1022
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,580
I don't think this is health code.

1023
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,480
Guys, I think there's a health code violation here.

1024
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,180
Oh no.

1025
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,720
Well, I wish I could see what that is.

1026
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,260
I wish I could see that.

1027
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,160
This can't be right.

1028
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,560
This has to be a health code violation.

1029
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,090
Hello?

1030
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,840
I go downstairs.

1031
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,180
Or maybe upstairs?

1032
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,740
Oh, there's the painting.

1033
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,860
Wait, where do I go now?

1034
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,440
Like I'm stuck.

1035
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,420
Is this where I was before?

1036
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,720
Oh, this is not where I was before.

1037
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,360
Opens map unexplored.

1038
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,500
I'm like, whoa, I definitely have never been here.

1039
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:32,960
Whoops.

1040
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:38,980
Hello?

1041
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,400
Oh, there you are.

1042
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,240
Back here.

1043
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:47,620
What's your Silent Hill?

1044
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,000
What does your Silent Hill look like, little lady?

1045
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,480
Must be better than what the fuck I'm doing.

1046
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,580
Can I go to your Silent Hill?

1047
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,000
Your Silent Hill might be a lot better than what I'm going through right now.

1048
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:04,880
Can I visit?

1049
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:12,700
Hello?

1050
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,540
Oh, there you are.

1051
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:18,440
I see her.

1052
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,400
Can she open the door?

1053
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,140
But we'll find out.

1054
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:21,820
Yep, she can.

1055
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,880
There we go.

1056
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,280
I'm just gonna use bullets.

1057
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:30,340
It's just easier.

1058
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,140
Really, it's just easier against them.

1059
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,440
I feel like...

1060
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:43,840
I've tried to like hit them with my pipe, but like you shouldn't hit women with your pipe and like...

1061
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,920
And like it just takes too long.

1062
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,740
If I'm gonna hit... if I'm gonna put her out of her misery...

1063
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,480
It's easier to just use the pistol.

1064
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:58,690
Shoot her ass.

1065
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,990
It's easier also because it's headshots, too.

1066
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:13,910
There we go.

1067
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:16,650
It does not help that they flinch.

1068
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:17,530
They really won't.

1069
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:22,170
It does not help at all.

1070
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:22,870
Oh my god.

1071
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:24,410
It's actually pretty...

1072
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,490
It's harder to hit, but it saves a lot of time.

1073
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,630
Patient transferred for observation.

1074
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:33,270
Malnourished.

1075
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:34,150
Shallow breathing.

1076
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:35,050
Avoids eye contact.

1077
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:35,810
Oh, wait, that's me!

1078
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,030
Wait, that's not...

1079
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,070
Baby, that's not good.

1080
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,310
Patient two refuses solid food.

1081
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,130
Uh, forced feed.

1082
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:46,010
Okay, that's not me.

1083
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:46,490
Never mind.

1084
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:47,790
I don't want to be this person.

1085
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:49,930
Something is very wrong.

1086
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:51,130
What's wrong with this guy?

1087
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:53,410
Guys, I... not me anymore.

1088
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:53,870
Not me.

1089
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:54,330
Not me.

1090
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,170
Not me.

1091
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:03,970
Maybe I should start hitting them with my pipe to save ammo, but like, it just takes so long!

1092
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:07,930
Usually, it's like three shots.

1093
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,430
I feel like three shots is just faster.

1094
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:12,310
I don't know.

1095
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,370
Oh, come on.

1096
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,050
Are you...

1097
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:16,650
Come on!

1098
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,410
Where are all these puzzles?

1099
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,910
Okay.

1100
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:23,810
I don't know where that would go.

1101
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:29,690
I don't think... I don't think you guys are gonna give me another one.

1102
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,160
These are not even good puzzles.

1103
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,120
Don't lie.

1104
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,620
These aren't even good puzzles.

1105
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,540
It's...

1106
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:47,540
A combination lock is not a good puzzle.

1107
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,380
I said it.

1108
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:49,640
I fucking said it.

1109
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:58,880
Wait, where do I go?

1110
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,440
This way?

1111
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,000
If I could, I fucking would break the window.

1112
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:06,820
If I...

1113
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:12,340
If I could, I would fucking... I'll break that window right there.

1114
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:13,720
Right there and now.

1115
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,800
I'll do it.

1116
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,600
I'll fucking...

1117
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,300
Okay, I need to use the bathroom.

1118
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,300
I'll be right back, guys.

1119
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:47,270
Back.

1120
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,450
I'm back in my own personal Silent Hill.

1121
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,250
All right.

1122
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,130
Like, where do I go?

1123
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:58,210
Oh my god, where do I even go at this point?

1124
01:15:58,210 --> 01:15:59,190
Where am I?

1125
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:00,130
All right.

1126
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:03,070
Taking my time.

1127
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:04,570
Fucking course I'm taking my time, guys.

1128
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,290
I'm in Silent Hill.

1129
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,170
Like, what do you want from me?

1130
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:09,610
Like, what do you want from me?

1131
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:11,450
I'm trapped in this fucking hellhole.

1132
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:18,410
I don't... I don't even know the combination.

1133
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:20,710
Oh my god.

1134
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:21,470
What is it?

1135
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:23,390
Do I have the item that tells me?

1136
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:28,190
Okay, no, that's just... that's just my...

1137
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,670
That's just my... those are just my happy pills.

1138
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:33,350
My happy pills and my...

1139
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:37,950
My happy syringe that's not shared.

1140
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:42,470
These needles definitely look like it was never shared at all.

1141
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,510
Oh my god.

1142
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:49,350
Like, what do I do?

1143
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,170
Oh my god.

1144
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,150
Where am I?

1145
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,330
It looks so clean, guys.

1146
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:08,530
I like... like, I have to go somewhere else, but I don't even know where to go anymore.

1147
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:12,230
I feel like I'm trapped here.

1148
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,250
Been here?

1149
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,060
Yeah, I have.

1150
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,030
Look at the wall.

1151
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:33,910
Which wall?

1152
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:37,790
Which wall?

1153
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:38,730
Do I have to go back?

1154
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:40,770
Double tap.

1155
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:42,790
Triple tap.

1156
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,610
There's a wall?

1157
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,740
We'll never know.

1158
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,440
Oh, hey.

1159
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,640
Oh, shit.

1160
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,780
That's what you meant.

1161
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,320
Break the window, Doki!

1162
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,180
I was like, bro, if I could, I would.

1163
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:04,380
Oh, there's the window.

1164
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:05,260
There's...

1165
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,960
There's the window, okay.

1166
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,880
We have the inner working.

1167
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,240
Oh, so that's what you meant.

1168
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,140
That's what you meant by break the window.

1169
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,700
It's like, of course, I'm trying.

1170
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,380
I don't know what you guys want from me.

1171
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,960
If there was a window, I would break it.

1172
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,500
I see as I stood next to a window, I...

1173
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,180
Guys, don't you guys know birds can't see windows?

1174
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,680
Can you really blame me?

1175
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,020
Birds can't see windows.

1176
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,600
I mean, I have one of it.

1177
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,440
Is that not it?

1178
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,020
Is there another thing?

1179
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,080
Dr. Andrews, we delivered the radiographs you requested.

1180
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:59,260
However, it looks like the file was incomplete as one of the pictures was nowhere to be found.

1181
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,480
We will send something as soon as we locate it.

1182
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:02,420
Oh, wait, I have it.

1183
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,320
I literally have the picture right here.

1184
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,300
And I wish I could see it.

1185
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,040
Okay.

1186
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:16,770
There we go.

1187
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:17,850
That's one of them.

1188
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:21,230
And what are... moldy radiation?

1189
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:22,370
How do I clean it?

1190
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:25,110
I have to clean this fucker?

1191
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,610
Turn on the sink, right?

1192
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,270
Oh, what happened to the faucet?

1193
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,330
I don't even turn it on.

1194
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:33,130
I don't even have a faucet.

1195
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,970
Oh my gosh, my life's a mess.

1196
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,370
Oh my... where the plumbing at?

1197
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:42,870
What happened to the plumbing?

1198
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:48,050
Okay, we gotta go to the first...

1199
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:49,530
What is it?

1200
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,370
We have the...

1201
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,870
God, how do you clean mold?

1202
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:55,090
Like at that point just fucking throw it away.

1203
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:59,130
I have the one first floor inner ward key.

1204
01:19:59,290 --> 01:19:59,510
Okay.

1205
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:01,730
Off we go.

1206
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:03,410
Back to hell, I guess.

1207
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,930
Why can't I just take her pipe?

1208
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:15,650
I should be legally allowed to take that pipe away from her hands.

1209
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:21,090
Like, why am I letting them hold the pipe?

1210
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,950
I should be legally allowed to take it away from her.

1211
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:26,330
She's a danger to society.

1212
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,170
Why do you need two pipes?

1213
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:34,250
Like, I don't know, dual wield that shit.

1214
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,290
Like...

1215
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,510
I'm fucking dual wield.

1216
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,660
All right, here we go.

1217
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,860
Back at it again.

1218
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,920
God, this game...

1219
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,680
Apparently, this isn't even the long part.

1220
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,380
I think that's like the worst part.

1221
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:58,260
This is like not even the...

1222
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,840
Not even the longest level.

1223
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:08,020
I feel like 80 years have passed since I've been in Silent Hill.

1224
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,820
Oh, there's one more nurse here.

1225
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,280
Where is she?

1226
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,700
Oh, there she is.

1227
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,680
Slowly walking over.

1228
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,940
Is that it?

1229
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,920
There we go.

1230
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,000
All right.

1231
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,420
Back at it.

1232
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,120
Where did that nurse come from?

1233
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,380
I actually don't know where that nurse came from.

1234
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:38,640
All right, down I go to the first floor.

1235
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,860
Oh, fuck, okay.

1236
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,140
Fuck.

1237
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:45,900
No, but why?

1238
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:46,520
Okay, it's fine.

1239
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:47,360
It wasn't filled up.

1240
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,240
Oh my god.

1241
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,020
Oh, she came from the supply closet?

1242
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,140
God damn it.

1243
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:55,760
I fucking...

1244
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,020
Oh.

1245
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,480
All right, I didn't realize she opened the supply closet.

1246
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,120
It's self-defense.

1247
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,700
She came at me with a pipe.

1248
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,240
What do I do?

1249
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,180
Just grab her?

1250
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:11,940
She literally... she started it.

1251
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,720
She started it.

1252
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,840
She piped first.

1253
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,020
Oh, it was open.

1254
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,880
Oh, she came from that area.

1255
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:25,560
Like this area?

1256
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,440
Oh, nice.

1257
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:31,100
Fucking thank god the ammo I wasted on this bitch.

1258
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,000
I can say it.

1259
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:33,980
She was.

1260
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:34,740
She was.

1261
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,500
I can say it because I'm a bitch too.

1262
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,500
Bitches recognize bitches.

1263
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,660
I have recognized a fellow bitch when I see one.

1264
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,080
So true.

1265
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,460
So, so fucking true.

1266
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,300
I have the pass.

1267
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:58,740
I have.

1268
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,840
All right.

1269
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,640
Let's see.

1270
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,020
Inner ward.

1271
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,840
Back at it again.

1272
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,280
Back at it again.

1273
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:12,860
Wait.

1274
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,040
Wait a minute.

1275
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,320
This was never open before.

1276
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,800
I've been here for so long.

1277
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,140
I was like, wait a minute.

1278
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,820
I don't remember this door being open.

1279
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:29,120
So I like took a second glance.

1280
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,020
I was like, what?

1281
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,580
Why was this open?

1282
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,660
What the fuck?

1283
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,360
You fucking...

1284
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,240
Oh my god, Q.

1285
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,460
I thought, I thought she opened it.

1286
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,380
That's why I didn't care.

1287
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:44,600
That's fine.

1288
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,360
At least she was there.

1289
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,140
That's nothing.

1290
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,740
What do you mean 18?

1291
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,000
Okay, like what do you mean?

1292
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,020
That's nothing.

1293
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:53,660
What do you mean?

1294
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,920
There's nothing there, Chase.

1295
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,440
I don't know what you mean.

1296
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:06,180
Oh my god, I'm running out of ammo because of the nurses.

1297
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,360
I hope I'll find more.

1298
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,080
Maybe I shouldn't keep shooting them.

1299
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,620
I can't help it.

1300
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,840
There's another one?

1301
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,180
Oh shit, I was not... oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1302
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:25,800
You okay there?

1303
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1304
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,300
You know what?

1305
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:29,720
I don't...

1306
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,200
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1307
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:34,120
Oh, she got the second wind.

1308
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:34,960
I don't know.

1309
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:36,860
I felt like she was having a good time.

1310
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,120
Like, I don't know.

1311
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:41,480
Like, look at her go.

1312
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:44,100
I thought she was grooving.

1313
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,360
I didn't want to bother her.

1314
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,440
I felt bad.

1315
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:54,760
Like, I thought she was just, you know, punking it out.

1316
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,500
I just felt bad.

1317
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,480
She was just vibing, you know?

1318
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:07,520
It looked like she was vibing.

1319
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,900
She was having a good time.

1320
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So I was like, well, I shouldn't...

1321
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,160
I feel like I shouldn't bother her.

1322
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,220
All right, I'm gonna shoot less this time because like...

1323
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,600
I'm just gonna pipe the nurses at this point.

1324
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,040
Like, I'm wasting a lot.

1325
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:23,380
Which one do I fight first?

1326
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,560
I guess this one.

1327
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:37,490
Okay, that was... I wasted bullets there, but that was awkward.

1328
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:42,310
All right, I'll do one headshot and then we're gonna pipe.

1329
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:51,730
Okay, nice.

1330
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:53,490
How long does it take though?

1331
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:55,230
Like, how long?

1332
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,830
Pipe.

1333
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:57,150
Oh, wait!

1334
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,210
Wait a minute!

1335
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,350
I should have... wait!

1336
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:02,370
Oh my god, I wasted so much ammo.

1337
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:07,670
That's awkward, I...

1338
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:10,170
I should have done that first.

1339
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:18,250
Pipe!

1340
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:25,750
What?

1341
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:28,530
She can just grab me like that?

1342
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:34,590
Oh my god, this lady is much more scarier than all the other ladies.

1343
01:26:36,370 --> 01:26:37,690
What the fuck?

1344
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:41,310
She can resist the pipe?

1345
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:48,390
Okay, I... I was not ready for the grab.

1346
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:49,330
I...

1347
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:52,930
I was not ready for her to fight back.

1348
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:55,130
This nurse is not like the other nurses.

1349
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,730
She's not like the other girls.

1350
01:26:57,090 --> 01:27:00,390
She actually grabbed my pipe.

1351
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:01,150
Oh my god.

1352
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:04,870
Oh my god, take me out on a date first if you want to grab my pipe.

1353
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:10,070
Whoa, that's so forward of her.

1354
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:15,450
I was not expecting that.

1355
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:18,970
Oh, do I clean it with this?

1356
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:19,750
No.

1357
01:27:20,650 --> 01:27:22,330
I need to find something here.

1358
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:29,430
Yo, she was moving a bit too fast, lady.

1359
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:34,770
He got out of the pool and made a break for the garden, cutting himself wide open in the process.

1360
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:36,270
Thank god I was still here.

1361
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:41,170
He was completely manic, screaming, had the orderlies hold him down.

1362
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:43,190
Barely managed to stitch him up.

1363
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:44,890
He's back into his room now.

1364
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:45,970
Sedated.

1365
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:47,950
What the fuck is going on?

1366
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:52,050
What the fuck is going on here?

1367
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:54,190
I opened this door.

1368
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:56,970
I could just leave right now.

1369
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:58,290
Oh.

1370
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:02,550
There's a guy out there.

1371
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:06,010
Wait, I could just leave right now.

1372
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:08,070
I didn't think that would work.

1373
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:11,550
So, oh my god.

1374
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:13,970
I just left.

1375
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:16,890
I saw a guy over there and I got scared.

1376
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:21,270
Oh my god, guys, I could.

1377
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:22,870
I can't believe it.

1378
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:24,170
I actually could just leave.

1379
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,650
Do I have to be closer if I'm going to do this?

1380
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:34,470
He's just too far.

1381
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,360
Thank you.

1382
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,220
Oh my god.

1383
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,340
He's...

1384
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,300
And he's dead.

1385
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,540
Alright, nice.

1386
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,840
I wasn't ready to, like, actually leave.

1387
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,440
I thought it was a joke.

1388
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,540
You know how, like, you're like, I want to leave already!

1389
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,060
I want to leave!

1390
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:01,680
I want to leave!

1391
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,980
And then they open the door and you're just like, wait.

1392
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,080
Get over here.

1393
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,380
Get your ass over here.

1394
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,120
What the fuck?

1395
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:12,720
You're so fast.

1396
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,420
Get your ass over here.

1397
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,900
Get your ass over here.

1398
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:18,760
That's right, you're not getting up.

1399
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,460
Getting up privileges, we're gone.

1400
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,060
There we go.

1401
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,240
I'm so like a cat.

1402
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,300
It was like, James was like, wait, I actually want to see.

1403
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,240
I did not expect him to just let me leave.

1404
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,300
Like, I said that as a joke.

1405
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:42,060
Bro, like, the crawlers, like, do nothing.

1406
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,180
They...

1407
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,260
Okay.

1408
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:47,420
Okay!

1409
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:55,160
Alright, I appreciate their letting me, like, look at her for a bit.

1410
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,280
Thanks for letting me look at you.

1411
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:02,300
Blackfire, thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

1412
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:02,920
Thank you.

1413
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,220
Thanks for letting me look at you.

1414
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,020
Oh my god.

1415
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:08,960
That freaked me out.

1416
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,140
Oh my god, thank you.

1417
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:16,480
I really appreciate the wind-up.

1418
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:21,110
Is there anything in here?

1419
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:22,790
Nice, more ammo.

1420
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,930
I need ammo so badly.

1421
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,290
Something there.

1422
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:28,990
Oh yeah, it told me to go to the pool.

1423
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,810
They can bite my ankles?

1424
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,790
They haven't done jack shit.

1425
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:36,030
They're weak as fuck.

1426
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:37,390
Fuck!

1427
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:41,890
Okay.

1428
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:44,170
Oh my god, I thought I killed all of you.

1429
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:45,570
I thought you were all gone.

1430
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:47,530
I thought you were all fucking dead.

1431
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:49,190
I didn't even need to be here.

1432
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:50,290
I didn't even need to be here.

1433
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:52,610
I just wanted to be here just for the sake of it.

1434
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:55,650
Like, I didn't even need to be over here in the corner.

1435
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,190
You can stay there forever.

1436
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:00,050
What?

1437
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:00,970
They're back up?

1438
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:03,270
You stay there.

1439
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:04,470
I don't want to waste my ammo on you.

1440
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:05,090
You don't matter.

1441
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:13,230
You're just a waste of ammo at this point.

1442
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:17,430
Can I touch the water?

1443
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:19,470
What if I should?

1444
01:31:21,490 --> 01:31:25,110
I feel like there's brain-eating bacteria living down there.

1445
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:26,570
Like, at this point.

1446
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,960
Yeah, I've done nothing.

1447
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:33,580
God damn it.

1448
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,390
Yeah, I feel like...

1449
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,280
I don't know.

1450
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:39,220
I just feel like there's...

1451
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:40,600
Yeah, I can't.

1452
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:41,100
Oh, thank god.

1453
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:41,580
I can't.

1454
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:42,920
Good.

1455
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,120
I don't need one to anyway.

1456
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:49,600
I don't want to touch that.

1457
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:52,400
This feels way too fucking gross.

1458
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:58,900
Okay.

1459
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,520
Alright, thank god.

1460
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,920
He was like, MY FRIEND!

1461
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,600
MY FRIEND WAS MY BEST FRIEND!

1462
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,600
That's fucking right and I'll do it again.

1463
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,940
Now you can join your best friend in hell.

1464
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,120
Alright, nice.

1465
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:16,660
More ammo.

1466
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,940
We've been best friends for 20 years.

1467
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,360
Another guy here?

1468
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:34,810
Is he hidden like here?

1469
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:35,470
Like, what?

1470
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,830
What am I listening to?

1471
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:40,590
Oh shit, USB cord.

1472
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:41,490
Oh, I made a...

1473
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:44,890
Oh shit, thank god.

1474
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,230
I got my USB cord.

1475
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,370
I got it.

1476
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:51,290
Let's see.

1477
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,830
Finally, I can charge my phone, guys.

1478
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,400
Alright, nice.

1479
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,660
Alright, I got double tap in.

1480
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:14,180
I swear, that other nurse was fucking insane.

1481
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:18,700
That other nurse was actually crazy.

1482
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,580
I don't know how she could do that.

1483
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,260
Did I come here already?

1484
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:28,940
I don't remember.

1485
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,420
My god, I've lost track of all the places I've been.

1486
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:34,860
Y'all look the same to me.

1487
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:37,040
Y'all look the same.

1488
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,260
I don't know.

1489
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:50,720
This case bears a disturbing similarity to a simulation situation that took place in a facility a few years back.

1490
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:54,560
The patient was admitted on a court order, but with the consent of the...

1491
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,720
Oh wait, I've never read this before.

1492
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,200
His condition appeared to be improving for the first few weeks.

1493
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:09,180
The administered medications paired with individual sessions of a psychologist and art therapy elevated his evolution and social withdrawal.

1494
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,540
There was no reason for concern.

1495
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:14,980
He didn't even know anything was wrong until the night guard reported when his key was missing.

1496
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,400
When they found him, it was already too late.

1497
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,620
Too late for what?

1498
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:20,680
You think he's okay?

1499
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,420
You think he's okay?

1500
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:27,300
Oh hey, that's the password.

1501
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,940
Hey guys, we found it.

1502
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,660
Guys, I told you eventually we found it.

1503
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:34,860
I didn't cheat.

1504
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,860
We just got there faster.

1505
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,520
See, we found the password, guys.

1506
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,620
Not cheating if we eventually get there.

1507
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,700
We just got there faster.

1508
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:54,310
Alright, another door unlocked.

1509
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:57,390
Oh my god, okay.

1510
01:34:57,470 --> 01:34:58,870
Where does this door go to?

1511
01:34:59,150 --> 01:34:59,890
Where am I?

1512
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:03,550
Where the fuck am I?

1513
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,380
Okay, back here.

1514
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:13,680
Alright.

1515
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,040
Day room.

1516
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,140
That's where I killed that other nurse and that guy.

1517
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,440
Alright, and that nurse too.

1518
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,560
Oh, those are some nice shoes, man.

1519
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:25,640
Oh my god, I did so many kills.

1520
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:29,760
Alright.

1521
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:31,240
Over here.

1522
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:33,440
Guys, how much of the hospital do I have left?

1523
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,260
Wait, is this not the med- Oh, I got combined!

1524
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,040
Okay, alright.

1525
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,900
My brain is going overtime right now.

1526
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:47,420
This...

1527
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:48,320
Uh...

1528
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,240
Fuck, okay.

1529
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:51,900
Uh...

1530
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:52,660
Key items.

1531
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:55,560
E with this.

1532
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,860
I'm learning.

1533
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,920
I don't need no back seating.

1534
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:00,360
Uh...

1535
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:01,940
Thank you, thank you.

1536
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:05,600
What a sad life.

1537
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,140
And they deserve it.

1538
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:10,560
No one can be hotter than James.

1539
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,780
If they're hotter than me...

1540
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:20,440
They're gonna die by the pipe.

1541
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:27,330
Alright.

1542
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:30,110
And then I can use it to charge my iPhone later.

1543
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:31,050
Maintenance key?

1544
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:32,310
Oh, it's a pool!

1545
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:34,350
It's a pool key.

1546
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:38,990
Are they all back?

1547
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:41,970
No way.

1548
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:42,750
Are you serious?

1549
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:46,550
No, it's just him.

1550
01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:48,450
Wait, where did he go?

1551
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:51,650
Yeah, it's just him.

1552
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:53,030
He just had a second life in him.

1553
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:55,170
For some fucking reason.

1554
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:59,170
Okay, yeah.

1555
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:00,710
Get back.

1556
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:01,630
Get out of here.

1557
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:03,530
Alright.

1558
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:06,810
How the fuck did he came back alive?

1559
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,750
All the others stayed dead.

1560
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:10,750
What makes you not special?

1561
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:12,790
You thought you were the main protagonist.

1562
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:15,220
But you were made just to die by my hands.

1563
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:18,070
Alright.

1564
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:19,750
Purpose fulfilled.

1565
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:23,530
Alright.

1566
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,590
Time to drain the water.

1567
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:27,090
What's in here?

1568
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:29,970
Can I just jump?

1569
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,490
Jump, James.

1570
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:34,110
We're gonna get fall damage?

1571
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,870
Oh my god, I don't trust you.

1572
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:39,210
I don't trust you.

1573
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:41,890
Oh my god.

1574
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:43,810
I don't know.

1575
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:45,450
Why are they just in the pool?

1576
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,270
Why are they just there?

1577
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:47,350
Why are they just there?

1578
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:51,890
They get back up, aren't they?

1579
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:52,630
They just get up.

1580
01:37:57,290 --> 01:37:58,170
Fucking knew it.

1581
01:37:58,550 --> 01:37:59,130
I knew it.

1582
01:37:59,310 --> 01:38:00,970
There's no way you stay dead.

1583
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:03,510
Oh, I knew it.

1584
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:04,370
Where are you?

1585
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:05,810
Get back here.

1586
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:07,890
That's right.

1587
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:09,230
Oh, you thought you could get away?

1588
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:11,150
Your life is meaningless.

1589
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:11,890
Get out.

1590
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:13,350
Get out of my head.

1591
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:16,410
There we go.

1592
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:19,090
I knew one of them was pretending.

1593
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:21,690
Alright.

1594
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:23,030
Now where am I?

1595
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:26,330
Okay, I'm in the shower room.

1596
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:27,290
Have I been here?

1597
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:28,290
I have.

1598
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:31,390
This is where I killed his best friend.

1599
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,110
Okay, I have one of them now.

1600
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:38,570
What do I do?

1601
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:38,590
What do I do?

1602
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:40,490
I can't.

1603
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:43,530
I'm gonna go crazy.

1604
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:46,750
Oh, okay.

1605
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:49,350
I haven't gone this way, the other way yet.

1606
01:38:49,450 --> 01:38:51,070
Okay, I'm gonna put the...

1607
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:53,230
Actually, I'm gonna go this way.

1608
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:58,910
Then...

1609
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:01,650
It's the other way.

1610
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:04,250
Yeah, I didn't go the first wing.

1611
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:04,870
This way.

1612
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:04,950
Okay.

1613
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:07,470
I didn't go this way yet.

1614
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:10,510
Okay, here we go.

1615
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:12,830
Okay.

1616
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:18,260
Hello?

1617
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,420
Oh, this is the... Oh, wait.

1618
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,340
This is the drain.

1619
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:23,740
Hello?

1620
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,960
Thank fucking god.

1621
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,300
Alright, ma'am.

1622
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:38,040
I feel like you're gonna put me in a scenario where...

1623
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:45,120
Where there's gonna be, like, three of these women about to get me.

1624
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,240
I can feel it.

1625
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,440
I can feel it.

1626
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:51,220
I can feel it.

1627
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,460
I feel that there's gonna be 300 of these.

1628
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,280
I...

1629
01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:01,360
I put three women and I don't know what to do with three women.

1630
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,100
That's too, too many women.

1631
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,420
I have two hands.

1632
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,480
I...

1633
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,100
It's three too many.

1634
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,680
Please don't make...

1635
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,080
Don't put... Give me three.

1636
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,280
I don't know what to do.

1637
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,800
Like, I don't even know what to do with one.

1638
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,000
Like...

1639
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,020
God, give me two hands.

1640
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:32,340
Oh...

1641
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:33,680
What am I gonna do here?

1642
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:34,640
Is there...

1643
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,480
There's a woman.

1644
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,620
I know there is.

1645
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,720
I know you're here.

1646
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:47,640
Oh, nice.

1647
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:48,360
Mold remover.

1648
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,260
Oh, there you are.

1649
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,400
Okay.

1650
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:59,540
I can get two stabs in in another way when she's running.

1651
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:00,620
Yeah.

1652
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:05,730
I'm so sorry.

1653
01:41:06,170 --> 01:41:07,190
Oh, fuck.

1654
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:08,550
God, she's different.

1655
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:10,430
She's so different.

1656
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:12,790
Holy shit, she's different.

1657
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:14,230
I'm just gonna shoot her in the head.

1658
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:16,610
No, she took out...

1659
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:17,590
Okay, that's fine.

1660
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,210
She's so different.

1661
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:24,370
It's in the walls deep inside the mold remover.

1662
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:27,590
It gets rid of it for a while, but then the thing reappears in the exact same spot.

1663
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:29,910
We need to get in there, break it all down.

1664
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:32,010
We have to and root it out.

1665
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:32,850
That's an elite.

1666
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:35,090
That's a fucking elite nurse right there.

1667
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:36,290
Oh, she's so different.

1668
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:39,670
She's not like the other nurses.

1669
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:42,630
She grabbed my pipe.

1670
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:43,610
Oh, my God.

1671
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:44,890
Whoa, Mom.

1672
01:41:48,810 --> 01:41:49,370
Mommy.

1673
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:56,910
Oh, my God.

1674
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:04,390
Oh, my God.

1675
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:04,650
Oh, my God.

1676
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:05,290
She's scary.

1677
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:06,790
Those are scary nurses.

1678
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:10,170
Those are scary nurses.

1679
01:42:11,970 --> 01:42:15,970
Whoa, she hit back.

1680
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:19,670
I think she'll grab it.

1681
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:23,230
Oh, my God.

1682
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:28,420
Whoa.

1683
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:30,340
Don't grab it.

1684
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,260
Don't grab it, please.

1685
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:32,560
No, I'm so sorry.

1686
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,380
I'm so sorry.

1687
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,160
Oh, my God.

1688
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:37,060
Okay, we're fine.

1689
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,280
No, she's not her.

1690
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,500
She's not her.

1691
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,580
Oh, she is her.

1692
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,880
Oh, she is.

1693
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:45,640
I'm sorry.

1694
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:48,240
Oh, my God.

1695
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:48,860
I'm so sorry.

1696
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:49,420
I'm so sorry.

1697
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:49,880
I'm so sorry.

1698
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:50,600
I'm shooting her.

1699
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:52,980
She's elite.

1700
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:56,780
I'm sorry.

1701
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,160
I'm so sorry.

1702
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,840
She's also like her.

1703
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:03,620
She's just like her, too.

1704
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:11,260
Bro, when they hit back, like, what do I do?

1705
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,440
I'm so used to them.

1706
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:15,780
Like, I had, like, a system.

1707
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:17,480
You don't understand, chat.

1708
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,220
I had an entire system for them.

1709
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:23,180
And then they just came in and, like, ruined it all.

1710
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:30,480
Like, she ruined the system.

1711
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,820
It made, like, whoa.

1712
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,340
It, like, freaked me out.

1713
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:37,060
Wasn't used to it.

1714
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,360
I wasn't used to them just...

1715
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:43,640
working back.

1716
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:47,860
They adapted.

1717
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:49,920
Okay, I got the cafeteria.

1718
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,660
I got the mold remover.

1719
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,220
So we have to go back to the x-ray room.

1720
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:57,980
Where the fuck that was?

1721
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,140
I'm losing track.

1722
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:02,640
Where I've been.

1723
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:08,520
No, I have a shotgun.

1724
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:09,660
See?

1725
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,220
I just refuse to use it.

1726
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,380
Okay.

1727
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:15,740
Yeah, I got it.

1728
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:17,040
Guys, you don't understand.

1729
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,740
The shotgun is for boss fights only.

1730
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,640
It's for Silent Hill 2.5.

1731
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:25,220
It's for...

1732
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,980
It's for Silent Hill 2.5.

1733
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:27,900
You won't understand.

1734
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:30,640
You won't...

1735
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:34,140
Alright.

1736
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,540
Oh, yeah, it's this way.

1737
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:43,300
Cause I unlocked the gate, right?

1738
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:44,900
From here.

1739
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,640
It should be faster.

1740
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:53,590
Where the fuck is...

1741
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:54,190
Oh, there it is.

1742
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:57,410
I was like, where the fuck is that goddamn gate I unlocked?

1743
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:00,970
It should be here.

1744
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:04,510
Okay.

1745
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:08,010
And the x-ray room is here.

1746
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:09,070
Yeah.

1747
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:11,990
Guys, I don't know if you know this, but ammo transfer is over.

1748
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:18,210
I'll have enough ammo for Silent Hill 3 remaster, guys.

1749
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:19,710
You won't understand.

1750
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:21,510
You won't understand.

1751
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:26,670
And when they transfer the ammo in Silent Hill 3, who's gonna be laughing then?

1752
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:32,810
Heather's gonna get all my ammo.

1753
01:45:36,290 --> 01:45:37,650
Alright, here we go.

1754
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,000
Wait, I never placed these guys here.

1755
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,720
How the fuck did that get here?

1756
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:47,620
Alright, let's see.

1757
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:47,920
Yeah.

1758
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:50,940
And then mold remover.

1759
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,660
Oh nice, now it's back.

1760
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:59,770
Put it over there before things get weird.

1761
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:02,670
Okay, skull trauma.

1762
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:04,450
Alright, we know where that is.

1763
01:46:04,530 --> 01:46:06,610
That's skull trauma right here.

1764
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:09,510
And then this is...

1765
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:10,630
Old fracture?

1766
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:13,750
Guys, I don't know how to read this.

1767
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,160
Okay.

1768
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:19,360
Okay.

1769
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,860
How the fuck do I put these then?

1770
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:22,560
Oh!

1771
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,000
Oh god, I'm so stupid.

1772
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:28,340
Wait, no, don't answer that.

1773
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,720
Wait, I, fucking, oh my god.

1774
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,200
Okay, there's lines.

1775
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:33,100
There's...

1776
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:35,020
Oh my god, there's rotation!

1777
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,480
I can ro...

1778
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,980
Guys, whoa.

1779
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,440
Guys, did you know you can rotate this?

1780
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:42,940
Did you?

1781
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:45,600
Oh my god, I was gonna be like, why doesn't it fit?

1782
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,480
Oh my god.

1783
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:49,860
Guys, you can rotate pictures.

1784
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,280
This changes everything.

1785
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:56,940
This actually changes everything.

1786
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:00,880
This makes so much more sense now.

1787
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:07,990
Yeah, that goes here.

1788
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:12,860
Okay, this should be here.

1789
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:13,660
There we go.

1790
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,320
437?

1791
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:16,780
437?

1792
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:18,140
Is that 37?

1793
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,880
The fuck is an F?

1794
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:24,920
Is that 37?

1795
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:26,460
I can't tell.

1796
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,560
Can't read doctor's handwriting.

1797
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:31,580
Is that fancy F?

1798
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,240
Okay, I was gonna say, like, 87.

1799
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,400
Sorry, 43712.

1800
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:36,560
Okay, we got it.

1801
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,400
437...

1802
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,620
I forgot you write 7s like that.

1803
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,580
That's so weird.

1804
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,580
Stop being so pretentious.

1805
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:46,740
Write it the right way.

1806
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,400
Okay, 43712.

1807
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:51,930
4...

1808
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:55,860
37...

1809
01:47:57,900 --> 01:47:59,160
12.

1810
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:00,280
Nice.

1811
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,920
The fancy F.

1812
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:05,240
I was so confused.

1813
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,620
I was like, why so fancy?

1814
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,080
Last wristwatch must be here.

1815
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,240
I don't like that there's a cutscene.

1816
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,080
And the little girl's gonna be like, BOOM!

1817
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:24,640
Like, what else would it be?

1818
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:25,480
Okay,

1819
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,030
nice, we got it.

1820
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:34,050
We got the last...

1821
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,930
Sorry, I just realized they're not watches.

1822
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:37,110
I just...

1823
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:40,770
I just realized they're patient bands.

1824
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:45,470
I was like, whoa, there's so many wristwatches here.

1825
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:46,250
They're...

1826
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:51,250
I just realized they weren't supposed to be watches.

1827
01:48:53,930 --> 01:48:55,510
They're like, patient...

1828
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:57,790
Mental patient bands.

1829
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:01,350
Like watches, I don't know.

1830
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:04,830
How do I get downstairs faster?

1831
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:05,450
Oh, this way.

1832
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:09,270
Double tap.

1833
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:14,900
Oh my god, okay.

1834
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:15,720
Okay, save.

1835
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:17,800
Okay.

1836
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,000
Alright, here we go.

1837
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,420
Here we go.

1838
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:28,740
Down we go.

1839
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,820
And then down we go again.

1840
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,780
And then...

1841
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:35,500
Down we're going.

1842
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,060
And then where?

1843
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,500
Now where?

1844
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:42,240
Cause now I'm lost again.

1845
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:43,260
Oh, here.

1846
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:44,640
Okay.

1847
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:44,700
Okay.

1848
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:47,080
Here we go.

1849
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,580
I realized I went the wrong way, but that's okay.

1850
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:52,240
I don't care anymore.

1851
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:54,700
I just want to save in the other area.

1852
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:55,820
Here we go.

1853
01:49:57,620 --> 01:50:00,400
I'm going the longest way possible.

1854
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:02,240
But that's okay.

1855
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,180
I just wanted to be here.

1856
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,440
I went too down.

1857
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:09,820
Guys, trust the process.

1858
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:11,560
It was all intentional.

1859
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:13,360
I just wanted to be over here.

1860
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,480
Give me a second.

1861
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,960
The worst thing about...

1862
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,200
I need to check my volume sometimes.

1863
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:26,000
When I blow my nose, or when I cough too hard, I mute myself.

1864
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:30,380
But when I mute myself, the GoXLR sometimes doesn't go all the way back up.

1865
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,900
So it lowers my...

1866
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,720
It lowers the volume sometimes.

1867
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:37,880
So I have to make sure I don't accidentally lower it all the way down.

1868
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:46,330
So yeah.

1869
01:50:46,410 --> 01:50:47,810
It's very annoying sometimes.

1870
01:50:47,930 --> 01:50:50,510
Because I have it at default 90.

1871
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:54,170
But sometimes when I mute it too much, it goes to 86.

1872
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:56,350
And I'm like, that's not right.

1873
01:50:57,870 --> 01:50:59,250
That's not right.

1874
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:01,890
Okay, the director's office.

1875
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:03,970
Why can't I open the door from here?

1876
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:07,650
Wait, did I not unlock it?

1877
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,200
I'm so dumb.

1878
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:12,750
I didn't unlock it.

1879
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:13,810
I...

1880
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:16,430
No, it actually matters!

1881
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:18,790
It actually lowers you so much!

1882
01:51:19,830 --> 01:51:21,070
It's true!

1883
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:25,050
Okay, back here.

1884
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:28,670
Okay, now I should unlock this.

1885
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:30,130
Can you not?

1886
01:51:30,370 --> 01:51:33,450
Oh my god, I can't believe I forgot to unlock this part.

1887
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:38,890
Actually, I can't believe it.

1888
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:41,030
Oh, I can actually.

1889
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:43,550
Alright.

1890
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:45,890
We got the three hands now.

1891
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:48,770
Alright, there you go.

1892
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:52,750
Am I supposed to...

1893
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:56,230
Oh my god, are you serious?

1894
01:51:58,790 --> 01:52:00,470
Are you fucking...

1895
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:01,290
Are you...

1896
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:02,910
Do I have to move you correctly?

1897
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:03,490
Are you...

1898
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:10,420
Oh, I don't know!

1899
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:13,000
There's a puzzle to this?

1900
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,260
Oh my god, okay, let me...

1901
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:16,840
Let me read.

1902
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,080
Alright.

1903
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:24,220
Okay.

1904
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:27,500
The numbers?

1905
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,700
They like, draw on top of the numbers.

1906
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:38,400
437!

1907
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:41,460
S1!

1908
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:43,400
Thank you for the superchat!

1909
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:45,680
Thank you for 10 gift ships!

1910
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:46,960
Thank you, thank you!

1911
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:54,310
I assume, like, it has something to do with these.

1912
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:00,850
The numbers, what do they mean?

1913
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:03,230
What do the numbers mean?

1914
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,750
Oh, there you go.

1915
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:09,350
98.

1916
01:53:09,710 --> 01:53:10,750
We did it!

1917
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:12,490
Oh my god, we're so smart.

1918
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:15,570
We did it.

1919
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:17,070
Oh my god.

1920
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:18,770
I fucking knew it.

1921
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:20,670
Oh my god, I'm so smart.

1922
01:53:21,010 --> 01:53:23,290
I knew that was the answer all along.

1923
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:26,710
Oh shit.

1924
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:27,690
Fuck it, whatever.

1925
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:31,130
I have like, 300 gigabytes left.

1926
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:32,370
Not even gigabytes, what is it?

1927
01:53:32,370 --> 01:53:34,090
I have 900 gigabytes left of memory.

1928
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:35,110
It's alright.

1929
01:53:37,030 --> 01:53:38,470
What's one more to go?

1930
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:43,050
Alright, the safe button.

1931
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:46,110
Oh?

1932
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:49,250
Oh?

1933
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:50,470
Okay.

1934
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:52,530
Oh wait, this is easy.

1935
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:54,830
Oh, okay.

1936
01:53:54,910 --> 01:53:56,430
It's just pictures.

1937
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:58,490
Okay, I can't fuck that up.

1938
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:01,310
I literally can't fuck this up.

1939
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:04,530
Okay, I can.

1940
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:05,730
I actually...

1941
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:06,590
Okay, alright.

1942
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:08,190
That's a little embarrassing.

1943
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:09,970
I actually can fuck this up.

1944
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:10,590
I...

1945
01:54:14,010 --> 01:54:15,950
Okay, wait.

1946
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:18,010
Yeah, no.

1947
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:18,810
This is correct.

1948
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:21,230
I actually could.

1949
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:22,090
Who would've thought?

1950
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:24,870
There we go.

1951
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:27,150
I did it!

1952
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:28,510
Okay.

1953
01:54:29,050 --> 01:54:29,650
Fuck!

1954
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:31,030
Okay, I'm gonna screenshot this.

1955
01:54:32,910 --> 01:54:33,510
Okay.

1956
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:36,730
Oh my god, can I not screenshot this?

1957
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:37,090
What is it?

1958
01:54:37,090 --> 01:54:38,430
No, it's a black screen!

1959
01:54:38,590 --> 01:54:40,730
You're not allowed to illegally screenshot this game!

1960
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:43,070
I'm not gonna remember this!

1961
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:44,370
Okay.

1962
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:48,690
I can't illegally screenshot this game.

1963
01:54:48,730 --> 01:54:50,490
It gives me a black screen like in Netflix.

1964
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:53,590
Oh, it's on my map?

1965
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:55,410
Oh, thank god.

1966
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:57,330
Oh my god, thank fucking god.

1967
01:54:58,150 --> 01:55:00,130
Thank god it's on my map.

1968
01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:01,450
Use my phone!

1969
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:02,350
No, I can't!

1970
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:04,390
I need my phone for VTubing!

1971
01:55:07,930 --> 01:55:08,530
Okay.

1972
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:13,210
Wait, what?

1973
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:20,940
Did he ever tell me the numbers?

1974
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:24,660
Did he ever tell me what the...

1975
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,860
Okay, let me...

1976
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:30,060
Is there any numbers here?

1977
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:31,540
Did he ever...

1978
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,400
Oh, there it is.

1979
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,200
Okay, no, that's not it.

1980
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:38,800
Oh my god, did he...

1981
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:41,200
This is the wrist.

1982
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:42,860
Must be the wrist, right?

1983
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:44,640
Okay.

1984
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,180

1985
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,720
9245 Oh my god, where's my map?

1986
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:57,900
Where's my fucking map?

1987
01:55:59,200 --> 01:55:59,920

01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,700

01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,660
Oh shit.

1991
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:07,860
We gotta reset this.

1992
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:09,020
Okay.

01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,920
That's literally it!

2003
01:56:54,600 --> 01:57:01,180
92451 92468 Oh my god, it's not moon, it's a triangle!

2004
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:02,000

2005
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:04,060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2006
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,480
Oh my god, sorry.

2007
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:10,560
That fucking... what was it called?

2008
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:12,920
The triangle...

2009
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:13,820
Uh...

2010
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:14,440
Okay.

2011
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:17,420
Okay.

2012
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:19,800
Illuminati H.

2013
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,060
Illuminati H.

2014
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,880
Mel Boob.

2015
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:25,140
Illuminati H.

01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:31,240
Mel Boob Evil woman, smash bros.

2017
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:31,920
There we go.

2018
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:34,660
It works!

2019
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:37,320
I actually memorized it by then.

2020
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,340
Okay, rooftop.

2021
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:40,660
Alright, there we go.

2022
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:41,420
We did it.

2023
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:43,020
We fucking figured it out.

2024
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:44,880
It's how...

2025
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:47,700
It's how our principles...

2026
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:49,420
Our code...

2027
01:57:49,420 --> 01:57:50,440
Of a lifetime.

2028
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,320
It's the women's side with Horns on it!

2029
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:57,700
So it's like evil!

2030
01:57:58,020 --> 01:58:00,340
Cause there's horns on the women's side.

2031
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:04,860
Alright, where the fuck is rooftop?

2032
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,020
If it works, it works, you know?

2033
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,820
How do I get to the fucking rooftop?

2034
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:15,340
That's the basement.

2035
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:18,080
That's the third floor.

2036
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,100
Laura?

2037
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:28,260
Like...

2038
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:28,900
Huh?

2039
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,220
I'm looking at all these maps.

2040
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:36,260
Is that where the...

2041
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:36,840
Laura is?

2042
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:44,130
Is it where Laura is?

2043
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:48,920
Can't tell.

2044
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:49,800
There's so many.

2045
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,040
Can't tell anymore.

2046
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:53,160
I'm gonna cry.

2047
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:58,760
I have so many staircases.

2048
01:58:58,980 --> 01:58:59,860
Which one?

2049
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,880
Which one?

2050
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:04,080
The top left or the bottom right?

2051
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,440
There's so many staircases.

2052
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:13,820
There's like fucking arrows everywhere!

2053
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,620
Top left or bottom right?

2054
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:19,260
There's two staircases.

2055
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:20,580
Which one do I go?

2056
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,000
Top left?

2057
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:24,520
Is it top left staircase?

2058
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,120
I can't go up cause there's two areas.

2059
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:32,160
Top?

2060
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:33,320
Okay, top left, okay.

2061
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:35,420
Top left.

2062
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:40,990
Oh my god, here we go.

2063
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:42,350
Backtracking yet again.

2064
01:59:45,570 --> 01:59:46,510
Top left.

2065
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:48,590
Right.

2066
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:52,750
Okay, here we go.

2067
01:59:54,510 --> 01:59:56,370
There's just too many staircases, guys.

2068
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:57,310
There's too many.

2069
01:59:57,750 --> 01:59:58,930
Too many.

2070
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:02,650
There's just way too many staircases.

2071
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:04,330
Hello?

2072
02:00:04,930 --> 02:00:06,870
Wait, that doesn't unlock this door.

2073
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:09,590
I still go up?

2074
02:00:10,290 --> 02:00:12,010
Guys, you fucking liars.

2075
02:00:17,670 --> 02:00:18,330
There's an...

2076
02:00:18,330 --> 02:00:19,630
What do you mean up again?

2077
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:23,760
I'm...

2078
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:31,080
What do you mean up again?

2079
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:33,300
Oh, there's another one right here.

2080
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:35,000
There's another...

2081
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I forgot about this staircase.

2082
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:39,960
Oh my god, I forgot this one existed.

2083
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:42,180
There's so many stairs.

2084
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:45,060
I am losing myself in the staircase.

2085
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,220
I've lost myself.

2086
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:49,440
Oh my god, now it's raining?

2087
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:51,440
How much more depressed can you be?

2088
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:56,180
James, this is why you need to take your meds, James.

2089
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:59,020
Oh my god, when it rains, it means you're extra depressed.

2090
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:03,660
Wait, can I...

2091
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:04,520
Okay, I can't go over there.

2092
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:05,220
I have to go here.

2093
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:11,410
This is all in your head, James.

2094
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:13,430
This is all in your head.

2095
02:01:13,490 --> 02:01:14,550
You caused this.

2096
02:01:20,670 --> 02:01:21,110
Okay.

2097
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:23,830
Can't go there yet though.

2098
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:24,930
I'm pretty sure.

2099
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:27,490
What's the plan?

2100
02:01:28,010 --> 02:01:28,450
Survive.

2101
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:30,810
There's no plan.

2102
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:33,990
I'm just trying to make it in this big world.

2103
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,160
How do I grab the ammo that's over there?

2104
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:43,740
Oh.

2105
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,240
Oh, that's how.

2106
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,880
I didn't see the staircase.

2107
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:49,480
Okay, nice.

2108
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:51,680
More shotgun ammo I can hoard.

2109
02:01:57,090 --> 02:01:57,730
Okay.

2110
02:01:59,430 --> 02:02:00,030
Rain.

2111
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:01,830
Stared out the window all day.

2112
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:04,010
Peaceful here, nothing to do.

2113
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:06,010
Still not allowed to go outside.

2114
02:02:06,570 --> 02:02:07,390
Still raining.

2115
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:08,910
Talked to the doctor a little.

2116
02:02:09,910 --> 02:02:12,530
Would they have seen me if I didn't have a family to feed?

2117
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:14,710
I know I'm pathetic and weak.

2118
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:16,390
Not everyone can be strong.

2119
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:17,910
Rain again.

2120
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:20,070
The meds made me feel sick today.

2121
02:02:20,370 --> 02:02:23,230
If I'm only better when I'm drunk, then who am I anyway?

2122
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:24,350
Oh, that's sad.

2123
02:02:26,890 --> 02:02:28,710
I'm not a fucking crazy murderer.

2124
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:31,930
I don't know what you were like before the meds kicked in.

2125
02:02:33,670 --> 02:02:34,130
Like...

2126
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:37,470
Okay, this way.

2127
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:40,430
This way I go.

2128
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:43,410
I go here.

2129
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:45,270
Alright.

2130
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:48,370
Okay.

2131
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:51,370
Alright, I was just told it's gonna be posted tomorrow, not today.

2132
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:53,350
Remember when I was like, oh, something might be posted today?

2133
02:02:53,710 --> 02:02:54,530
JK, it's tomorrow.

2134
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:57,250
JK.

2135
02:02:57,990 --> 02:02:58,890
Wait, that's it?

2136
02:03:06,370 --> 02:03:07,820
That wasn't just it.

2137
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:08,700
JK.

2138
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:13,980
It wasn't it.

2139
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:15,440
That wasn't just it.

2140
02:03:18,310 --> 02:03:19,820
Oh my god.

2141
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:21,820
Alright.

2142
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:23,880
That's not it.

2143
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:36,720
I'm sorry.

2144
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:37,060
I'm sorry.

2145
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:37,420
I'm sorry.

2146
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:37,920
I'm sorry.

2147
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:37,960
I'm sorry.

2148
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:38,180
I'm sorry.

2149
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:40,680
I'm sorry.

2150
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:43,840
Don't get mad at me.

2151
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:01,330
Where am I?

2152
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:04,550
Oh, I'm on the side Laura was at.

2153
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:07,870
I'm on Laura's side.

2154
02:04:09,410 --> 02:04:10,530
Laura's here.

2155
02:04:17,710 --> 02:04:18,250
Nice.

2156
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:23,570
More... more... very, very clean and safe syringes right here.

2157
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:26,130
Feels so clean and safe.

2158
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:31,530
I'm sorry.

2159
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:33,270
I'm so sorry, Pyramid Head.

2160
02:04:33,570 --> 02:04:34,970
You'll get it tomorrow.

2161
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:37,010
Pyramid Head, I'm sorry.

2162
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:39,070
The announcement will be tomorrow instead.

2163
02:04:39,530 --> 02:04:40,550
I'm so sorry.

2164
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:41,790
I didn't mean it.

2165
02:04:43,650 --> 02:04:44,630
Oh, fuck.

2166
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:45,010
Okay.

2167
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:46,950
Ooh, whoa.

2168
02:04:47,530 --> 02:04:51,770
Lucky Noji, he hits you with his big knife and you lost a chunk of your health.

2169
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:54,010
Whoa, that's not me.

2170
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:55,690
What's this?

2171
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:58,470
Oh.

2172
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:02,410
Lore!

2173
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:06,590
Hello?

2174
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:09,610
Is Laura here?

2175
02:05:11,970 --> 02:05:12,730
Laura?

2176
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:22,220
Hey, Laura.

2177
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:27,750
Hey.

2178
02:05:28,690 --> 02:05:29,930
So, I'm gonna go... where are you?

2179
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:32,650
Yeah, how do I know her?

2180
02:05:32,790 --> 02:05:33,210
Oh, Eddie.

2181
02:05:33,330 --> 02:05:35,290
Okay, I forgot Eddie told me.

2182
02:05:37,290 --> 02:05:39,390
Whoa, that's rude.

2183
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:42,090
He's human too, I think.

2184
02:05:52,730 --> 02:05:53,950
Whoa, whoa.

2185
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:54,910
I'm not like that.

2186
02:05:54,910 --> 02:05:56,470
I'm on medication.

2187
02:05:57,130 --> 02:06:00,050
Well, like I was, but like...

2188
02:06:00,050 --> 02:06:01,730
Like, I'm better now, I swear.

2189
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:09,990
Oh shit, and you lived?

2190
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:12,110
How did my wife die and you live?

2191
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:17,710
Laura, no!

2192
02:06:25,490 --> 02:06:29,350
Wait, if she is alive, that means my wife is alive too?

2193
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:30,330
I knew it!

2194
02:06:30,370 --> 02:06:32,810
I knew that funeral was not real.

2195
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:36,170
I knew she faked it.

2196
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:38,970
If she's alive, that means my wife's alive too.

2197
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:40,770
She explains everything.

2198
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:44,930
What?

2199
02:06:49,430 --> 02:06:50,490
You hid it?

2200
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:59,880
Wait, that seems like a dangerous door, Laura.

2201
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:02,020
Why did you hide in here?

2202
02:07:11,550 --> 02:07:12,890
I don't know, Laura.

2203
02:07:13,290 --> 02:07:14,770
Are you fucking with me?

2204
02:07:14,830 --> 02:07:16,510
Are you gaslighting me, Laura?

2205
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:20,410
Whoa.

2206
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:24,870
It feels like she's gaslighting me right now.

2207
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:27,450
Oh my God, just like my wife.

2208
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:28,790
Did she teach you that?

2209
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:33,310
I'm a liar, right?

2210
02:07:33,790 --> 02:07:34,550
Can you open it?

2211
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:35,150
Huh?

2212
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:35,870
Do ya?

2213
02:07:36,330 --> 02:07:38,690
Laura, open this door right now.

2214
02:07:39,930 --> 02:07:41,030
What's the magic word?

2215
02:07:41,330 --> 02:07:41,450
Laura.

2216
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:43,490
Nope, that's not it.

2217
02:07:43,730 --> 02:07:45,210
I guess I won't open it.

2218
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:48,990
Laura, open the fucking door, you fucking...

2219
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:50,950
Oh, you're a child, I can't see it.

2220
02:07:52,970 --> 02:07:56,230
She's gonna grow up to be a bitch too, I recognize it.

2221
02:07:56,230 --> 02:08:06,610
I can see it.

2222
02:08:06,690 --> 02:08:07,970
That was little me.

2223
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:10,070
I can see it.

2224
02:08:10,170 --> 02:08:11,310
I know I'm a bitch.

2225
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:12,170
I can recognize.

2226
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:13,510
Real recognize, real.

2227
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:14,950
I recognize.

2228
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:17,150
Whoa.

2229
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:20,030
Oh, is this a boss fight?

2230
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:23,190
Guys, I knew my shotgun...

2231
02:08:23,190 --> 02:08:23,470
Whoa!

2232
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:26,850
Whoa!

2233
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:29,490
My God.

2234
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:30,730
Okay.

2235
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:32,570
Okay.

2236
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:39,810
Alright, I assume I shoot this, right?

2237
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:44,530
Like, I don't know where else to shoot.

2238
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:47,530
I mean, fucking, did you see the mouth?

2239
02:08:49,310 --> 02:08:50,910
Oh, shit!

2240
02:08:52,710 --> 02:08:54,070
Don't... Fuck, okay.

2241
02:08:54,690 --> 02:08:55,650
He hit back, guys.

2242
02:08:56,670 --> 02:08:57,830
That's not fair.

2243
02:08:58,090 --> 02:08:59,350
He hits back.

2244
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:05,450
You're not supposed to shoot back.

2245
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:08,390
Where?

2246
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:16,880
Where?

2247
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:19,700
I'm supposed to reload my gun, but...

2248
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:20,460
Fuck, okay.

2249
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:23,580
Bro.

2250
02:09:25,380 --> 02:09:27,160
Oh my God, now he has two legs.

2251
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:33,180
Oh my God, now he has two arms.

2252
02:09:33,180 --> 02:09:34,380
Oh my God.

2253
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:38,160
Okay.

2254
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:39,520
That's right.

2255
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:42,940
This is what I would save the bullets for!

2256
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,460
Oh, four arms!

2257
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:46,880
You know what they say about four arms.

2258
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:48,840
You know what they say.

2259
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:52,910
Okay.

2260
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:07,640
Oh, shit!

2261
02:10:13,650 --> 02:10:14,170
Is he dead?

2262
02:10:14,770 --> 02:10:15,610
He's not dead.

2263
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:17,430
He was dead!

2264
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:21,650
Little does she know, he was definitely not dead.

2265
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:32,430
She doesn't even...

2266
02:10:32,430 --> 02:10:33,670
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

2267
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:35,610
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

2268
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:41,190
Oh my God.

2269
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:43,090
I'm doing so much healing.

2270
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:49,760
Are you dead?

2271
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:56,340
Oh my God, that's so much...

2272
02:10:57,200 --> 02:11:02,020
That was all my fucking heals.

2273
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:04,460
And my shotgun bullet.

2274
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:07,240
Wait, that was so easy.

2275
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:08,180
What the fuck?

2276
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:12,260
It's purpose has been fulfilled.

2277
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:14,480
Oh, shit!

2278
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,160
I'm sorry!

2279
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:17,260
I didn't mean to call her easy!

2280
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:18,440
I didn't...

2281
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:19,580
I didn't...

2282
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:21,040
I didn't mean it!

2283
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:23,420
She was...

2284
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:24,140
She was...

2285
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:26,120
She was the best thing in my life.

2286
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:28,240
I'm so sorry.

2287
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:37,800
Oh no, I don't have shotgun ammo for him.

2288
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,680
Are you a pyramid head?

2289
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:42,420
I thought he was the only boss I had to fight.

2290
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:48,910
Mary?

2291
02:11:58,680 --> 02:11:59,240
Mary?

2292
02:11:59,240 --> 02:11:59,280
Mary?

2293
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:05,160
I knew the hospital people lied.

2294
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:06,400
I knew you survived.

2295
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:07,760
I don't know why.

2296
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:09,400
I knew they buried the wrong body.

2297
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:10,420
I should've...

2298
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:12,800
I knew I should've checked the coffin before they buried you.

2299
02:12:14,180 --> 02:12:18,460
It was weird that they closed the coffin so that I couldn't see you during the funeral.

2300
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:20,700
I fucking knew it.

2301
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:26,060
Not taking those meds are finally paying off.

2302
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:29,440
Oh no, am I in the other world?

2303
02:12:31,620 --> 02:12:32,480
Where am I?

2304
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:37,440
Oh, that's a wheelchair in the middle.

2305
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:38,840
Did a miracle happen?

2306
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:41,860
Did a miracle happen?

2307
02:12:41,980 --> 02:12:43,580
Why is there a wheelchair in the middle?

2308
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:49,980
Did somebody learn how to walk?

2309
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:55,320
Maybe somebody learned how to walk, guys.

2310
02:12:55,540 --> 02:12:56,260
You don't...

2311
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,480
You don't know that.

2312
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:02,140
Hello?

2313
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,500
There's save points?

2314
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:05,500
Oh, thank God.

2315
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:08,460
Oh, thank God there's a save point.

2316
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:14,360
There's a scarier version of the fucking hospital!

2317
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:16,020
How?!

2318
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:18,240
Is this not scary enough?!

2319
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:21,260
How do you make a scarier version?!

2320
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:27,720
I think saving those shotgun bullets was a good idea.

2321
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:32,260
Is it usually that... Was it supposed to be that easy or did I just luck out?

2322
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:35,180
Or was just... No, it's not luck and skill.

2323
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:36,840
Or was I just that good?

2324
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,720
Wait, do I go...

2325
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:57,980
Oh, was there a note in the... Was there a note there?

2326
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:05,650
Oh, there was?

2327
02:14:05,730 --> 02:14:06,470
Okay, I'll go back.

2328
02:14:07,810 --> 02:14:09,390
Sorry, we'll go to this.

2329
02:14:09,950 --> 02:14:11,490
We'll come back later.

2330
02:14:13,090 --> 02:14:14,870
Oh, he's like a bullet sponge?

2331
02:14:15,030 --> 02:14:15,530
Oh, nice.

2332
02:14:15,610 --> 02:14:16,330
I'm just a gamer.

2333
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:18,270
I told you guys!

2334
02:14:18,410 --> 02:14:19,270
Hoarding is good!

2335
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:22,530
Guys, don't listen to the other people.

2336
02:14:25,510 --> 02:14:26,730
Hoarding is good.

2337
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:31,130
I didn't realize there was a note.

2338
02:14:31,190 --> 02:14:32,210
I thought it was just a miracle.

2339
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:35,010
Initial symptoms.

2340
02:14:35,150 --> 02:14:35,770
Hyper focus.

2341
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:36,990
They can be fixed.

2342
02:14:37,370 --> 02:14:38,410
Stop at nothing.

2343
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:40,210
I told you.

2344
02:14:40,370 --> 02:14:40,990
I'm fixable.

2345
02:14:42,690 --> 02:14:43,810
Told you guys.

2346
02:14:44,890 --> 02:14:46,310
You can fix me.

2347
02:14:48,970 --> 02:14:50,270
I can fix him.

2348
02:14:51,150 --> 02:14:51,810
I knew it.

2349
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:52,970
I knew it.

2350
02:14:56,650 --> 02:14:58,170
Alright, here we go.

2351
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:04,300
Which way is it?

2352
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:06,020
Which way?

2353
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:07,340
Oh, this is the way.

2354
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:11,080
Oh my god, bro.

2355
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:14,300
Oh, this is the cafeteria area.

2356
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,440
Without the cafeteria.

2357
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:19,920
Oh my god.

2358
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:23,180
Okay.

2359
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:27,220
Okay.

2360
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:30,160
What's this?

2361
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:38,300
Hey guys, we could skip all of this right now.

2362
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:40,760
Imagine.

2363
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:47,020
Imagine if I was like, alright guys, let's just make this quick, guys.

2364
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:51,700
Let's just make this quick, everybody.

2365
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:58,600
Alright, back to my hoarding.

2366
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:01,480
Back to my hoarding.

2367
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:04,740
Are the nurses stronger in this area too?

2368
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:05,660
In the other world?

2369
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:11,280
Oh,

2370
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:24,460
they look stronger.

2371
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:28,020
Wait, do they have less clothes?

2372
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:33,000
Wait, they have knives?!

2373
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:33,760
That's cheating!

2374
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,760
Oh, they are stronger!

2375
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:37,940
Fuck!

2376
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:41,440
Okay.

2377
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:41,880
Okay.

2378
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:46,560
What happened to my light?

2379
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:48,340
Wait, my light's gone.

2380
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:52,980
Wait, she broke my light!

2381
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:58,440
She shaked the knife- the light out of my...

2382
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:02,600
She shaked the- my flashlight!

2383
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:05,660
Where's my flashlight?

2384
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:07,380
Where's my flashlight?

2385
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:09,980
Oh, I turned it off.

2386
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:10,440
JK.

2387
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:13,180
Sorry, I turned it off out of fear.

2388
02:17:13,620 --> 02:17:17,860
She shanked me so hard, I actually turned my flashlight off.

2389
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:20,740
I think it's understandable.

2390
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:23,140
It's understandable.

2391
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:31,780
Okay, I forgot about those fuckers.

2392
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:39,700
Alright, okay.

2393
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:46,220
I don't know, man.

2394
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:47,720
I don't...

2395
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:51,060
My god, I knew it.

2396
02:17:51,320 --> 02:17:52,080
I baited her.

2397
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:53,860
I baited her.

2398
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:55,880
Oh, did you see that bait, though?

2399
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:57,960
I knew it.

2400
02:17:58,220 --> 02:18:00,480
I knew she wanted to grab this pipe.

2401
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:02,240
No, no, no.

2402
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:04,380
Not taking me out on a date first.

2403
02:18:09,970 --> 02:18:10,950
Crawl time.

2404
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:11,730
Crawl time.

2405
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,400
Alright, meds.

2406
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:23,560
And then...

2407
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:24,980
Nice, more shotgun.

2408
02:18:25,140 --> 02:18:25,760
Thank god.

2409
02:18:26,220 --> 02:18:27,320
Thank god.

2410
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:28,780
More hoarding.

2411
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:33,460
Oh, I need this for Pyramid Head when he fucking gets me.

2412
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:36,960
When he comes down there and fucking gets me.

2413
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:40,240
Oh my god, okay.

2414
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:46,840
Alright, I can't go this way.

2415
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:51,680
This way is god too.

2416
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:55,760
I don't know.

2417
02:18:56,060 --> 02:18:57,580
There's too many choices.

2418
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:00,340
Oh, where's Laura?

2419
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:03,500
Laura, where are you, you fucking child?

2420
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:05,780
Who did this?

2421
02:19:06,220 --> 02:19:07,520
Who did this, Laura?

2422
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:11,700
This is your fault.

2423
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:11,960
Oh.

2424
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:15,740
Okay.

2425
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:21,860
Wow, we danced, arms flailing, our bodies in perfect synchrony.

2426
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:26,440
And the music played, but in any dance, there comes a time.

2427
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:30,360
One must take the lead, and the music got louder and louder.

2428
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:33,180
Pounding, piercing, and then silence.

2429
02:19:33,880 --> 02:19:36,120
The fuck kind of wrote this?

2430
02:19:38,260 --> 02:19:39,860
Oh, they're all chained up.

2431
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:42,340
Is he okay?

2432
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:43,900
Oh.

2433
02:19:49,930 --> 02:19:50,890
What's this?

2434
02:19:53,030 --> 02:19:55,090
Is that an instrument of force?

2435
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:01,860
Oh, okay, I got another one.

2436
02:20:02,940 --> 02:20:03,540
Nice.

2437
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:04,820
Is that it?

2438
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:08,040
Oh, and then I add an eye.

2439
02:20:08,220 --> 02:20:09,300
I have to give him an eye.

2440
02:20:14,830 --> 02:20:15,430
Hello.

2441
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:23,210
Okay.

2442
02:20:24,210 --> 02:20:24,950
Oh.

2443
02:20:25,470 --> 02:20:27,570
I hear you.

2444
02:20:29,330 --> 02:20:31,270
I hear you.

2445
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:33,070
Hello?

2446
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:36,210
Hello?

2447
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:38,730
I know you're there.

2448
02:20:40,150 --> 02:20:40,650
Hello?

2449
02:20:41,390 --> 02:20:42,490
Oh, there she is.

2450
02:20:43,390 --> 02:20:44,810
Give this nurse a knife.

2451
02:20:47,310 --> 02:20:49,270
Maybe I'll do one more headshot.

2452
02:20:52,510 --> 02:20:53,930
Yeah, that's right!

2453
02:20:54,370 --> 02:20:55,930
Fucking projectile bitch!

2454
02:20:56,530 --> 02:20:57,510
Oh, shit!

2455
02:20:58,250 --> 02:20:59,550
What the fuck?

2456
02:21:00,510 --> 02:21:02,870
Oh, it's this guy!

2457
02:21:03,210 --> 02:21:05,210
Where did he come from?

2458
02:21:05,810 --> 02:21:08,310
I didn't realize it was the spiky guy.

2459
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:13,410
It's just like, I forgot we're in this world.

2460
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:16,850
Spiky guys exist in this world.

2461
02:21:17,070 --> 02:21:18,050
They get extra kinky.

2462
02:21:22,290 --> 02:21:23,250
Okay.

2463
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:25,510
Get down.

2464
02:21:26,970 --> 02:21:27,450
Alright.

2465
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:29,010
Oh, thank God.

2466
02:21:29,650 --> 02:21:31,710
He predicted your prediction!

2467
02:21:32,250 --> 02:21:34,050
I forgot they existed!

2468
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:38,590
What the fuck?

2469
02:21:39,330 --> 02:21:45,110
Like, why are you- Stop!

2470
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:46,570
Stop running!

2471
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:49,830
I see you!

2472
02:21:50,990 --> 02:21:52,970
She's like, I don't think she saw me.

2473
02:21:54,030 --> 02:21:55,410
I saw him to book it.

2474
02:21:55,970 --> 02:21:59,330
Like, she just walked away.

2475
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:06,320
It was like, do you think- Oh, I think that was a fluke.

2476
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:08,000
I don't think she saw me.

2477
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:12,940
I don't- Maybe she thought it was the wind.

2478
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:15,740
Okay.

2479
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:17,080
Down.

2480
02:22:19,420 --> 02:22:19,900
Down.

2481
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:22,420
Okay, I guess we go downstairs.

2482
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:23,780
There's nothing back here.

2483
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:24,860
Oh wait, no.

2484
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:28,020
Ha!

2485
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:31,140
You thought I didn't see the cracked wall, did you?

2486
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:34,860
That's right, I'm gaming now.

2487
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:38,660
I'm actually gaming.

2488
02:22:38,740 --> 02:22:39,640
I see everything.

2489
02:22:44,930 --> 02:22:45,470
Alright.

2490
02:22:46,370 --> 02:22:47,930
Down the creepy hole we go.

2491
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:50,370
When there's a hole, there's a gold.

2492
02:22:54,370 --> 02:22:55,710
Here I go.

2493
02:22:57,210 --> 02:22:58,510
Here I go.

2494
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:03,690
Oh, why is this so far?

2495
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:08,190
It's like right here.

2496
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:10,930
Like, I don't know what you expected.

2497
02:23:15,330 --> 02:23:15,670
Alright.

2498
02:23:17,990 --> 02:23:19,670
These guys aren't as scary.

2499
02:23:19,870 --> 02:23:20,890
They're just there.

2500
02:23:21,190 --> 02:23:24,610
They just- They're just standing there.

2501
02:23:24,610 --> 02:23:27,610
It's when they pop out, but like...

2502
02:23:28,390 --> 02:23:31,010
It doesn't help that they just stand there.

2503
02:23:32,830 --> 02:23:35,230
They just- They're just there.

2504
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:37,870
What?

2505
02:23:38,190 --> 02:23:39,850
Where did I go?

2506
02:23:40,850 --> 02:23:42,290
Like, where am I now?

2507
02:23:43,070 --> 02:23:43,810
My god.

2508
02:23:44,190 --> 02:23:45,370
Where am I?

2509
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:52,340
Oh, there's the other nurse.

2510
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,720
Oh, it's the easy one.

2511
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:02,740
Oh shit, the double tap!

2512
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:05,000
It's still pretty easy though.

2513
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:06,200
Ah, fuck off!

2514
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:06,640
No!

2515
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:07,900
Triple tap?!

2516
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:13,100
I'm sorry, you're not- I'm- What?!

2517
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:15,480
I gave up.

2518
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:19,120
I gave up.

2519
02:24:19,820 --> 02:24:23,360
I don't want to dodge anymore.

2520
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:24,520
It's too much work.

2521
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:27,320
It is just too much work.

2522
02:24:38,180 --> 02:24:38,780
Okay.

2523
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:47,130
Oh, the triple!

2524
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:48,690
Okay, they do triples now.

2525
02:24:48,990 --> 02:24:49,570
Okay.

2526
02:24:49,970 --> 02:24:51,150
That's good to know.

2527
02:24:53,990 --> 02:24:54,290
That's...

2528
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:55,210
Good...

2529
02:24:55,210 --> 02:24:55,870
TO KNOW!

2530
02:24:59,410 --> 02:25:00,310
OH SHIT!

2531
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:01,250
What?

2532
02:25:02,630 --> 02:25:05,050
Where did you come from?

2533
02:25:05,130 --> 02:25:06,670
What the- No, not you!

2534
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:08,170
I'm not- I FUCKED UP!

2535
02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:11,250
I HIT THE THIRD GUY!

2536
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:15,310
My fucking pipe just auto-aced into that.

2537
02:25:16,530 --> 02:25:19,650
My pipe literally just auto-aced that.

2538
02:25:19,850 --> 02:25:22,470
Like, I didn't even know where this guy came from.

2539
02:25:23,330 --> 02:25:25,330
That's actually a party.

2540
02:25:25,950 --> 02:25:27,090
Oh my god.

2541
02:25:27,890 --> 02:25:28,890
That was funny.

2542
02:25:29,270 --> 02:25:33,930
That was actually- It actually came out of a fucking noob.

2543
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:38,490
He's just like, Hey, I don't wanna- Hey, what's going on guys?

2544
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:40,430
Why wasn't I invited?

2545
02:25:44,330 --> 02:25:48,850
My pipe actually just aim-assisted that whole- Holy fuck.

2546
02:25:52,130 --> 02:25:54,590
I did not see him, that's for sure.

2547
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:57,650
I definitely did not see that guy.

2548
02:26:01,850 --> 02:26:02,450
Okay...

2549
02:26:02,450 --> 02:26:03,970
This way...

2550
02:26:06,070 --> 02:26:07,330
Where's this go?

2551
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:10,910
Oh, time to stick my hand into the creepy hole!

2552
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:16,010
Okay...

2553
02:26:22,130 --> 02:26:23,010
Hello?

2554
02:26:23,910 --> 02:26:25,570
Did I go everywhere?

2555
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:27,470
Wait...

2556
02:26:27,470 --> 02:26:28,550
Heard something.

2557
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:33,370
Definitely heard something.

2558
02:26:34,730 --> 02:26:37,110
That's not supposed to be here.

2559
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:43,230
Okay...

2560
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:47,570
I feel like there's something here that shouldn't be here.

2561
02:26:48,670 --> 02:26:49,270
Hello?

2562
02:26:50,690 --> 02:26:52,150
Oh, there you are.

2563
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:53,890
Hello there.

2564
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:57,010
Okay...

2565
02:26:57,670 --> 02:26:59,330
Let me go check this out.

2566
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:00,930
Go up before you come back.

2567
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:05,790
Alright, nice.

2568
02:27:09,410 --> 02:27:11,850
She needed her privacy, clearly.

2569
02:27:13,830 --> 02:27:14,710
She have anything?

2570
02:27:14,930 --> 02:27:15,530
Oh, nice shotgun.

2571
02:27:16,350 --> 02:27:16,750
Nice.

2572
02:27:17,770 --> 02:27:19,950
Oh, I need to make sure I have enough ammo later.

2573
02:27:20,770 --> 02:27:22,270
I'm running out of ammo.

2574
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:23,570
She wasn't- Guys!

2575
02:27:23,950 --> 02:27:26,670
Guys, she wasn't done with the fucking bathroom!

2576
02:27:26,850 --> 02:27:28,210
I didn't want to be rude!

2577
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:34,960
Okay...

2578
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:38,580
I think I- Did I go to the- Yeah, I did.

2579
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,500
I go to the medical area already.

2580
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:44,340
It was like a little cubby hole here.

2581
02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:45,620
Right?

2582
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:46,920
No, there wasn't.

2583
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:50,640
I'm so- I'm so fucking confused now.

2584
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:54,240
I thought there was like a little area for you to go under.

2585
02:27:56,220 --> 02:27:57,300
Did I explore everything?

2586
02:27:57,560 --> 02:27:58,480
I can't tell.

2587
02:28:02,260 --> 02:28:04,220
Everything blends in for me.

2588
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:10,780
The underworld is so same-y that I can't tell anymore.

2589
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:13,820
Everything looks the same.

2590
02:28:15,980 --> 02:28:19,520
It's just all fucking mold and brown.

2591
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:22,500
It's just mold everywhere.

2592
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:29,860
Is it here?

2593
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:37,730
I go to the surgical chair, right?

2594
02:28:40,170 --> 02:28:40,650
Okay.

2595
02:28:43,570 --> 02:28:44,990
Okay, it's this way.

2596
02:28:48,090 --> 02:28:49,610
I just went backwards.

2597
02:28:50,110 --> 02:28:51,110
Okay, whoops.

2598
02:28:52,250 --> 02:28:54,630
Everything just- I'm just so confused now.

2599
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:57,110
I'm way too confused.

2600
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:03,010
Alright, poke.

2601
02:29:03,310 --> 02:29:04,690
Poke, give me your eye.

2602
02:29:05,970 --> 02:29:07,190
Nice, I got the key.

2603
02:29:07,830 --> 02:29:08,930
Alright, now we can cheat.

2604
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,770
No, I'm joking.

2605
02:29:09,970 --> 02:29:12,750
I'll do- Guys, I would never.

2606
02:29:14,690 --> 02:29:16,210
Guys, I would never.

2607
02:29:23,050 --> 02:29:24,970
I would never, guys.

2608
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:27,650
I would never cheat.

2609
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:32,910
But all I'm saying, I got the key though.

2610
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:35,050
I do have the key.

2611
02:29:35,050 --> 02:29:35,270
I do have the key.

2612
02:29:35,470 --> 02:29:40,910
I do have it.

2613
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:50,160
Alright, I'm gonna call it here.

2614
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:53,120
I'm gonna- I'm sorry.

2615
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:55,720
I also have another stream.

2616
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:57,120
I have a member stream tonight.

2617
02:29:57,620 --> 02:30:00,260
And I have the convention.

2618
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:03,000
And I have a panel tonight at Vietnam.

2619
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:08,980
So I don't wanna- I don't wanna fuck up my voice, guys.

2620
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:10,740
I would actually play longer.

2621
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:14,360
But like, I overbooked myself hella hard today.

2622
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:20,520
I actually- I like overbooked myself.

2623
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:23,060
I have dance lesson in the morning.

2624
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:25,120
I have today's stream.

2625
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:26,820
I have a member stream later.

2626
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:30,280
And then I have a convention at 12 midnight.

2627
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:32,580
And then I have my meet and greet.

2628
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:36,100
I have a panel and a meet and greet.

2629
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:40,640
And then, tomorrow, I have Payday 3 sponsor.

2630
02:30:41,640 --> 02:30:44,720
I have Payday 3 sponsor tomorrow.

2631
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:48,480
And also dance lessons again.

2632
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:49,420
So that's why.

2633
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:51,460
I would actually play longer today.

2634
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:55,760
But if I didn't overbook myself so hard today and tomorrow...

2635
02:30:57,840 --> 02:31:00,120
I fucked up a little bit.

2636
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:07,000
Anyway, I'm gonna swap- I'm gonna swap over.

2637
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:10,020
I did a little bit of super chat reading.

2638
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:13,540
Because there's not a lot of super chats today to get through.

2639
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:15,120
So I think I can do it.

2640
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:16,760
I think it's possible.

2641
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:18,240
Let me- Where are you guys?

2642
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:19,160
Where's my chat?

2643
02:31:19,240 --> 02:31:19,700
There we go.

2644
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:22,140
There we go.

2645
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:22,940
Yeah, I fucked up.

2646
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,540
I overscheduled myself hard.

2647
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:29,560
I overscheduled myself.

2648
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:30,440
I'm sorry.

2649
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,340
I couldn't help it.

2650
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:35,060
It was like, do you want to do it with a sponsor?

2651
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:36,060
And I'm like, sure.

2652
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:38,580
And then we got the other sponsor at the same time.

2653
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:39,600
And it was like, do you guys want to do it?

2654
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:40,140
Sure.

2655
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:42,800
And I was like, oh shit, my schedule's already decided.

2656
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:43,780
Oh, well.

2657
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,220
What's the worst that could happen?

2658
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:48,020
By the way, Doki, you also have a convention today.

2659
02:31:48,140 --> 02:31:49,800
And I was like, oh, that's all right.

2660
02:31:51,860 --> 02:31:53,500
That should be fine.

2661
02:31:54,820 --> 02:31:56,460
Standard, welcome to the Domino Farm.

2662
02:31:56,560 --> 02:31:57,420
Welcome, welcome.

2663
02:31:59,060 --> 02:31:59,760
Don't worry.

2664
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:03,360
We'll eventually beat Silent Hill 2 one day.

2665
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:05,660
Maybe.

2666
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:07,040
We'll never...

2667
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:08,280
That'd be so fucked.

2668
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:14,000
We'd never start another series because we're still stuck in Silent Hill 2 purgatory.

2669
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:18,860
We're still stuck in this purgatory.

2670
02:32:20,020 --> 02:32:22,540
But I'm getting more used to it.

2671
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:27,300
I am getting more used to Silent Hill 2.

2672
02:32:27,300 --> 02:32:32,260
To the point where it's not as scary as it was when I first started.

2673
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:38,580
When I first started, I was freaking the fuck out.

2674
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:40,820
But now, I'm a lot better.

2675
02:32:41,260 --> 02:32:46,600
Now, I'm not as good, but I'm a bit better than what I was before.

2676
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:56,480
It didn't help when I was stuck.

2677
02:32:56,480 --> 02:32:59,140
I felt like I was stuck in my own Silent Hill.

2678
02:32:59,320 --> 02:33:02,660
Where every fucking 5-10 minutes, it would be like...

2679
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:07,800
And I'm like, please, I'm playing a horror game.

2680
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:08,760
Stop.

2681
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:12,000
I'm fucking playing a horror game.

2682
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:14,380
Why do you do this to me?

2683
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:17,880
PA system.

2684
02:33:21,860 --> 02:33:22,180
Alright.

2685
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:26,820
Alright, what was that?

2686
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:27,120
Okay.

2687
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:28,860
Wait, oh my gosh.

2688
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:30,600
I forgot to put super chat.

2689
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:30,940
Oh, wait.

2690
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:31,300
No, wait.

2691
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:32,100
That's story time.

2692
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:32,880
Where the fuck is my...

2693
02:33:34,700 --> 02:33:35,460
Guys, no, no.

2694
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:36,660
It's not story time.

2695
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:37,900
It's...

2696
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:38,360
Oh my god.

2697
02:33:38,420 --> 02:33:39,060
Did I...

2698
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:39,680
Oh my god.

2699
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:40,560
Did I...

2700
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:41,800
Accidentally overwrite...

2701
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:42,620
No, it's this one.

2702
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:43,640
There we go.

2703
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:45,360
Donation reading time.

2704
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:46,120
Alright.

2705
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:50,500
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

2706
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:51,260
Where was I?

2707
02:33:57,340 --> 02:33:59,280
Micah, LostCore, MediCat, thank you for the super chat.

2708
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:00,020
Thank you, thank you.

2709
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:01,260
Paladin Knight, thank you for the super chat.

2710
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:01,880
Thank you, thank you.

2711
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:03,580
You could move the members stream the next week.

2712
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:04,840
The dragons would not mind.

2713
02:34:04,900 --> 02:34:06,160
It prevents you from destroying your voice.

2714
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:06,580
That's Paladin Knight.

2715
02:34:06,580 --> 02:34:07,240
Thank you for the super chat.

2716
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:07,900
Thank you, thank you.

2717
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:08,920
Now I feel bad.

2718
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:10,980
Because you guys were waiting.

2719
02:34:11,060 --> 02:34:14,120
Because I'm trying to keep the routine of every other week...

2720
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:15,880
For members.

2721
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:18,820
Especially because you guys pay a lot to be in the members.

2722
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:19,520
Like every month.

2723
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:20,380
And it's alright.

2724
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:22,860
I might not do a very long stream though for tonight.

2725
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:23,760
For members.

2726
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:27,400
So I might not do a very long stream though.

2727
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,060
But I still want to do a member stream.

2728
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:32,740
I'll try to make it up for another member stream next week.

2729
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:33,480
To make it longer.

2730
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:34,640
But it'll be like the same thing.

2731
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:36,560
It'll be like the profile pictures.

2732
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:38,060
But I'll still do a member stream.

2733
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:39,580
It's just I won't be doing a very long one.

2734
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:40,360
But I'll still do it.

2735
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:45,380
I'll do another one to make up for the small member stream.

2736
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:47,540
For next week and stuff.

2737
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:50,080
Because you guys paid a lot to be in the member stream.

2738
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:51,560
And I want to make it up for you guys.

2739
02:34:52,380 --> 02:34:53,340
But yeah, thank you for the super chat.

2740
02:34:53,440 --> 02:34:54,180
Thank you, thank you.

2741
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,160
Artheus, thank you for the super chat.

2742
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:58,160
Thank you, thank you.

2743
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:03,320
Ddragon, yeah that's what you get for skipping that door code puzzle.

2744
02:35:03,460 --> 02:35:04,580
Thank you for the super chat.

2745
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:05,120
Thank you, thank you.

2746
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:06,940
Why did you blame me?

2747
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:09,660
You guys were the weak ones.

2748
02:35:11,420 --> 02:35:13,480
One of you guys cracked.

2749
02:35:13,660 --> 02:35:15,000
It's not my fault.

2750
02:35:15,440 --> 02:35:17,740
It's not my fault.

2751
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:19,820
One of you guys cracked.

2752
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:26,760
All it takes is one dragon to betray the others.

2753
02:35:26,960 --> 02:35:28,600
That's all it took.

2754
02:35:31,300 --> 02:35:33,300
Pixel, thank you for the very first super chat.

2755
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:34,260
Thank you, thank you.

2756
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:36,480
Hello Doki, I really enjoy watching your streams.

2757
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:39,140
Thank you for making me smile and laugh with all your streams.

2758
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:40,400
You're such a joy to watch.

2759
02:35:40,520 --> 02:35:41,740
Also, it's my birthday.

2760
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:43,580
Thank you for the very first super chat, Pixel.

2761
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:44,520
Thank you, thank you.

2762
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:46,120
Happy birthday to you.

2763
02:35:46,380 --> 02:35:47,780
Happy birthday to you.

2764
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:50,160
Happy birthday, dear Neo.

2765
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:51,700
Happy birthday to you.

2766
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:52,180
Yeah!

2767
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:54,800
Also, is like John still here?

2768
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:55,740
Have you...

2769
02:35:55,740 --> 02:35:58,060
John, what do you have to say for yourself?

2770
02:35:58,540 --> 02:35:58,980
John...

2771
02:35:58,980 --> 02:35:59,920
Oh, you are here.

2772
02:36:00,300 --> 02:36:05,380
John, what do you have to say for yourself for betraying the dragon kind?

2773
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:13,980
What do you have to say, John?

2774
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:16,680
Get him.

2775
02:36:16,980 --> 02:36:19,640
I like how everyone was like, weak!

2776
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:20,420
Shame!

2777
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:27,280
John was like, I said the correct combination as a joke.

2778
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:30,500
John was just like, I didn't think she would pick me.

2779
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:32,420
There are so many numbers in chat.

2780
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:36,040
How was I supposed to know she would pick the right one?

2781
02:36:37,260 --> 02:36:38,300
Shame, John.

2782
02:36:39,020 --> 02:36:39,500
Shame!

2783
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:44,060
Alright.

2784
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:46,320
So...

2785
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:48,300
We have...

2786
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:52,660
Okay, the thing is, we have two versions of this one.

2787
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:54,300
So, we have...

2788
02:36:55,440 --> 02:36:57,360
This one, which is...

2789
02:36:57,360 --> 02:37:00,400
Basically, it's gonna replace our other one that looks just like this.

2790
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:03,440
But we have two versions of it because I didn't know which one to pick.

2791
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:05,300
We have this one versus...

2792
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:09,220
Alright, we have...

2793
02:37:09,220 --> 02:37:09,800
Oh my god.

2794
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:12,800
Okay, this one versus...

2795
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,020
This one.

2796
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:17,120
Alright, guys.

2797
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:18,340
Don't mind the eye...

2798
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:18,660
Oh, wait.

2799
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:19,960
Actually, I should fix the...

2800
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:22,500
I should fix the eye color, too.

2801
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:25,060
Whoops.

2802
02:37:25,300 --> 02:37:25,960
Give me a sec.

2803
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:28,060
So...

2804
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:30,360
I don't know which eye color to use, guys.

2805
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:31,460
I need you guys to help me.

2806
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:32,540
Alright.

2807
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:34,620
Which one...

2808
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:35,000
Oh, wait.

2809
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:35,680
That's the same one.

2810
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:36,040
I'm sorry.

2811
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:37,800
That's the same.

2812
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:40,200
Okay, just give me... Give us both the same...

2813
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:40,760
No, no, guys.

2814
02:37:40,820 --> 02:37:41,640
No, they're different.

2815
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:42,800
They're different.

2816
02:37:42,980 --> 02:37:43,560
Trust me.

2817
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:44,160
There we go.

2818
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:44,980
Now.

2819
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:46,480
Okay, there we go.

2820
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:46,880
Alright.

2821
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:48,140
So...

2822
02:37:48,140 --> 02:37:49,120
We have a problem.

2823
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:54,960
You see, I don't know if we want the black eyes or the green eyes.

2824
02:37:55,160 --> 02:37:56,220
They're not the same.

2825
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:57,960
Okay, like, which one, guys?

2826
02:37:58,540 --> 02:37:59,860
Left or right?

2827
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:02,640
It's not the same!

2828
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:03,960
It's not.

2829
02:38:04,980 --> 02:38:05,740
Green eyes?

2830
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:07,080
Okay, green eyes.

2831
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:08,360
Alright, now...

2832
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:10,220
Okay, we also have...

2833
02:38:10,780 --> 02:38:12,040
Oh my gosh, which one was it?

2834
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:14,000
I know, like, they gave me both options.

2835
02:38:14,060 --> 02:38:16,160
But, like, I was very sure about both of them.

2836
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:16,840
Except for...

2837
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:18,680
Alright, and then, here's the other one.

2838
02:38:19,780 --> 02:38:22,500
This one, we're gonna be calling some emotes for this.

2839
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:23,640
We're gonna be...

2840
02:38:23,640 --> 02:38:24,940
Letting you guys know right now.

2841
02:38:25,580 --> 02:38:27,560
Like, we're gonna be calling some...

2842
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:30,640
This will be replacing another emote.

2843
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:32,040
Alright.

2844
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:35,060
Left or right?

2845
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:39,280
Alright.

2846
02:38:39,700 --> 02:38:40,720
The right side?

2847
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:45,280
Alright, I see more right.

2848
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:45,720
Okay.

2849
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:46,520
Alright.

2850
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:48,600
Alright, and then, finally...

2851
02:38:49,500 --> 02:38:50,060
Okay, yeah.

2852
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:51,060
Actually, no, that's it.

2853
02:38:51,180 --> 02:38:51,580
That's it.

2854
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:52,320
Those were your picks.

2855
02:38:52,460 --> 02:38:53,520
Everything else is just...

2856
02:38:54,400 --> 02:38:55,380
Black eyes.

2857
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:57,240
Alright!

2858
02:38:57,800 --> 02:38:58,300
So!

2859
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,340
The great calling!

2860
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:01,640
The purge!

2861
02:39:02,320 --> 02:39:04,640
Pick an emote you wish to purge.

2862
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:06,380
Pick an emote.

2863
02:39:06,500 --> 02:39:08,220
I'm uploading emotes now.

2864
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:12,000
Pick an emote you wish to banish and replace.

2865
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:17,040
For a newer, shinier, prettier, and sexier version.

2866
02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:23,640
The emote you use...

2867
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:28,140
You put in shall be purged.

2868
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:31,520
Alright.

2869
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:33,880
Let's see.

2870
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:34,140
Yeah.

2871
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:37,440
Alright, let me double check if everything is okay.

2872
02:39:37,780 --> 02:39:40,460
Alright, did I choose the right one for this emote?

2873
02:39:40,540 --> 02:39:45,280
Alright, guys, I'm like slowly fucking trying to figure out my emote situation right now, so...

2874
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:49,640
I don't know if I even uploaded the right one for these.

2875
02:39:49,740 --> 02:39:50,600
Let me double check.

2876
02:39:53,480 --> 02:39:53,920
Camcorder.

2877
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:57,280
Yeah, is this the right one?

2878
02:39:58,020 --> 02:39:58,960
I can't tell.

2879
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:00,070
I can't tell.

2880
02:40:02,420 --> 02:40:06,220
I need to make sure I uploaded the right emote.

2881
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:09,120
Alright.

2882
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:11,660
Okay, I see some good options.

2883
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:12,580
Okay, alright.

2884
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:13,600
Alright.

2885
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:15,540
Let me upload these now.

2886
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:17,620
We're doing it live, so you guys can use them too.

2887
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:20,720
You guys can use them while we're doing it live.

2888
02:40:21,940 --> 02:40:22,860
Let me make sure.

2889
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:24,600
I need to make sure I actually upload the right version.

2890
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:26,800
I feel like I think I uploaded the wrong version.

2891
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:28,480
Did I?

2892
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:30,260
I can't tell.

2893
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:31,180
Is this 112?

2894
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:35,580
I can't tell anymore.

2895
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:38,640
Okay, sorry.

2896
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:39,620
I'm a professional.

2897
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:43,700
I'm just trying to make sure they're the right emotes.

2898
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:44,080
Okay.

2899
02:40:44,620 --> 02:40:45,000
Alright.

2900
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:46,860
I saw the one we're purging.

2901
02:40:47,500 --> 02:40:47,920
Alright.

2902
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:48,660
We're gonna...

2903
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:51,640
We're gonna get rid of Grrr.

2904
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:52,800
It has...

2905
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:56,780
It has been spoken by the...

2906
02:40:56,780 --> 02:40:58,980
By the council of the dragons.

2907
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:02,240
Say goodbye to Grrr.

2908
02:41:02,660 --> 02:41:05,640
Grrr shall leave us now.

2909
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:08,800
Goodbye, Grrr.

2910
02:41:09,340 --> 02:41:09,940
Goodbye.

2911
02:41:15,830 --> 02:41:18,170
Your final Grrrs.

2912
02:41:18,230 --> 02:41:21,220
Get those final Grrrs in before it's gone forever.

2913
02:41:21,220 --> 02:41:22,100
Shit.

2914
02:41:24,260 --> 02:41:24,900
Alright.

2915
02:41:25,220 --> 02:41:26,600
Save and publish.

2916
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:29,540
Goodbye, Grrr.

2917
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:31,600
He's gone.

2918
02:41:32,660 --> 02:41:34,660
He's gone for now.

2919
02:41:34,820 --> 02:41:37,180
He'll just be known as the square.

2920
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:40,260
He's gone forever.

2921
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:41,040
Alright.

2922
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:42,160
Alright.

2923
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:43,540
Now that he's gone.

2924
02:41:43,820 --> 02:41:44,720
Say goodbye.

2925
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:47,300
Wait, did we want a green eyes?

2926
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:48,340
We want a green eyes, right?

2927
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:52,180
We want a green eyes, right?

2928
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:54,560
Say goodbye to the other version of this.

2929
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:55,880
Say goodbye.

2930
02:42:00,360 --> 02:42:03,180
Say goodbye to this version.

2931
02:42:03,740 --> 02:42:05,080
To the old version.

2932
02:42:05,500 --> 02:42:07,320
Give your last final thoughts.

2933
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:12,800
Monsters!

2934
02:42:13,420 --> 02:42:15,840
Say goodbye to him.

2935
02:42:16,700 --> 02:42:17,080
Alright.

2936
02:42:17,080 --> 02:42:19,140
Before we purge them.

2937
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:19,880
Alright.

2938
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:22,660
In 3...

2939
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:24,280
2...

2940
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:25,180
1...

2941
02:42:25,180 --> 02:42:25,660
Goodbye!

2942
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:28,280
See you later!

2943
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:30,780
Where are my other emotes?

2944
02:42:31,640 --> 02:42:32,160
Alright.

2945
02:42:33,500 --> 02:42:34,020
Alright.

2946
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:36,900
And then the other ones, I'm not even going to give you a choice.

2947
02:42:37,220 --> 02:42:38,580
I'm just going to...

2948
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:41,940
It's going to be a surprise when you find out which one gets purged next.

2949
02:42:42,260 --> 02:42:44,780
Because I still have one more to purge.

2950
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:47,780
And this one is going to be a surprise.

2951
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:54,100
So it's just going to disappear.

2952
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:56,020
You won't even know who disappeared.

2953
02:42:56,780 --> 02:42:57,820
It's just...

2954
02:42:57,820 --> 02:42:58,900
It's just gone.

2955
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:03,940
Alright.

2956
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:09,080
Also because I realized last minute that we had doubles of it.

2957
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:10,520
I was like, oh yeah!

2958
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:12,040
This is a...

2959
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:13,340
I forgot I had...

2960
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:16,160
I forgot I had a double of this emote.

2961
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:18,000
So...

2962
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:20,480
So because of it...

2963
02:43:20,480 --> 02:43:21,220
Alright, where's...

2964
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:22,300
Okay, where is it?

2965
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:22,800
Okay.

2966
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:23,600
Here we go.

2967
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:25,140
It was black eyes.

2968
02:43:25,340 --> 02:43:25,600
Yeah.

2969
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:26,420
Alright, here we go.

2970
02:43:28,060 --> 02:43:29,580
Oh my gosh, where did I...

2971
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:29,800
Okay.

2972
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:31,020
No, that's not it.

2973
02:43:31,220 --> 02:43:32,240
Wait, which one did I replace?

2974
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:33,640
Oh, there we go.

2975
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:35,140
Alright.

2976
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:40,880
Let's see.

2977
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:43,000
Which one was the double again?

2978
02:43:44,280 --> 02:43:45,600
Alright, here we go.

2979
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:46,400
I'm ready.

2980
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:48,800
I'm ready to purge the last one.

2981
02:43:49,480 --> 02:43:50,800
Because I realized we had doubles.

2982
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:52,180
So I was like, oh shit.

2983
02:43:52,320 --> 02:43:53,020
Like, I'm gonna...

2984
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:54,200
I gotta get rid of that.

2985
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:54,880
I gotta...

2986
02:43:57,740 --> 02:43:58,200
Alright.

2987
02:43:58,900 --> 02:43:59,360
Goodbye.

2988
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:01,340
Goodbye.

2989
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:04,460
Oh, who did we lose?

2990
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:07,040
It's time to find out who we lost.

2991
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:10,500
The things I'm doing are my own shit.

2992
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:12,560
Who did we lose?

2993
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:13,820
I wonder.

2994
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:17,920
It's time to figure it.

2995
02:44:18,060 --> 02:44:18,920
It's there now.

2996
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:20,280
It's there.

2997
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:24,620
Yeah, we lost one of the sprays.

2998
02:44:24,660 --> 02:44:27,040
I realized we had two sprays.

2999
02:44:28,140 --> 02:44:30,800
Only one spray left.

3000
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:36,100
There's only one spray left.

3001
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:39,720
And now we have sweat.

3002
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:43,600
Yeah, but that's not a double.

3003
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:45,420
One is dad and the other one is me.

3004
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:46,820
That's technically not a double.

3005
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:51,000
How am I gonna spray RetroDoki now?

3006
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:51,740
It's over.

3007
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:53,340
It's gone.

3008
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:00,820
Alright.

3009
02:45:02,480 --> 02:45:02,980
Alright.

3010
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:06,420
Alright, that was a great mighty purge.

3011
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:07,080
Alright.

3012
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:09,120
Welcome to your new emotes.

3013
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:10,220
Now you have new emotes, guys.

3014
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:11,300
Congratulations now.

3015
02:45:11,400 --> 02:45:13,480
You have five new emotes, chat.

3016
02:45:14,660 --> 02:45:17,460
And now we're gonna have another great purge next...

3017
02:45:17,460 --> 02:45:18,000
Not next week.

3018
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:24,660
Whenever the next batch of emotes are done, we're gonna have another great purge of old emotes or double emotes.

3019
02:45:24,860 --> 02:45:27,880
And we'll finally have a little bit more variety.

3020
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:32,340
I realized my emotes don't have a lot of variety.

3021
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:35,620
But soon, soon we'll have more variety.

3022
02:45:39,930 --> 02:45:40,830
It'll be...

3023
02:45:43,510 --> 02:45:45,250
It'll be more variety soon.

3024
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:46,130
Anyway, guys.

3025
02:45:46,310 --> 02:45:47,950
I am gonna call it here.

3026
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:50,610
I know I said I was gonna read superchats and then I just read two.

3027
02:45:50,730 --> 02:45:51,110
I'm sorry.

3028
02:45:51,690 --> 02:45:52,530
I'm sorry.

3029
02:45:53,110 --> 02:45:54,650
I'm so sorry.

3030
02:45:56,990 --> 02:45:57,910
Anyway, guys.

3031
02:45:58,510 --> 02:46:00,590
The great purge sort of got in the way.

3032
02:46:02,570 --> 02:46:03,410
Anyway, guys.

3033
02:46:03,530 --> 02:46:04,550
As always, everybody.

3034
02:46:04,950 --> 02:46:05,550
Say hi.

3035
02:46:05,550 --> 02:46:08,430
Give him a round to get that blood flowing.

3036
02:46:08,730 --> 02:46:10,890
And if you did that for me, head to bed.

3037
02:46:11,030 --> 02:46:12,350
Cause you deserve it.

3038
02:46:12,470 --> 02:46:13,770
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3039
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:15,390
Bye, guys.

3040
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:16,750
Bye.
