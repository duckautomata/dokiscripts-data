1
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,770
JK No loop Sorry, I was a mistake.

2
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,750
I I was actually listening to the Playback video.

3
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:13,050
I had tab open of it and I was listening to that instead of the Instead of like my actual OBS so I was like wait, that's not right.

4
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,230
Oh shit.

5
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,730
Let me it Chad's broken too.

6
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,050
Oh my god I'm so happy.

7
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,590
This is over.

8
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,890
I can stop crying about this

9
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:33,950
My god, I'm just happy it's over like I the last week of this Okay story time.

10
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,170
Okay.

11
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:50,130
It's not really story time but like We'll have chat here because I don't care But like basically like The last week for this event was absolute hell because everything that could go wrong Basically went wrong.

12
00:02:50,490 --> 00:03:07,310
We had so many we had to use a lot of back last-minute backups and stuff like that and everything and I'm just half like I like obviously there was a lot there was like, you know Things we could improve on and stuff like that.

13
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:20,410
Like it was a huge learning experience There's a lot of stuff I could improve on for next time if I ever want to do something like semi-competitive You know, I try to push the casual it was still Competitive in a way that you know, there were pros in it.

14
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:30,270
I know like I okay So, um, let me talk about the behind the scenes for this because I know some people are wondering I actually got emails about this too because they're like, why did you invite pros?

15
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,750
It's supposed to be an all v2 raven.

16
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,270
I think I talked about before but if I didn't get the pros involved We wouldn't have had the event in the first place.

17
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,790
We did not have enough player

18
00:03:47,150 --> 00:04:20,670
Because um, because there was an issue regarding like a lot of teams, especially in especially in like More well-known teams and Really wanted to join this custom because of the fact that we had the op they had the opportunity to play with the The like play with one of their like professional player like the play with professional players that they've never had a chance to play With before or like this is like their first time or like for JP teams.

19
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:32,050
This is their first time being able to fight alongside NA pros or like EU pros or being able to play with professional players on the other side of the world.

20
00:04:32,510 --> 00:05:21,690
So Because of that that really helped a lot in terms of like gathering Players, especially the ones that have like have like a reputation amongst like the community regarding like Like like I guess like wow factor like this was like the uniqueness of this custom and the uniqueness of the custom to be able to like Have a chance to play with these types of more players and also it put more eyes on the event itself In regards to like maybe people who don't normally watch vtubers this is like their introduction to vtubers because a lot of you guys might not realize this but The Apex community within the NA side is not very well known.

21
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:37,870
It is not very popular, I would say, for like people in NA side or like English-speaking side to watch Vtubers.

22
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,530
And especially those who watch Apex in general too.

23
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:50,310
So it was more so the way to bring more eyes, especially to the JP side and the NA Vtuber side and everything.

24
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:58,570
So that was why, like, it was like, because originally I know some people were like, oh, I thought you were gonna make an all Vtuber custom.

25
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:17,330
But if I try to make an all Vtuber custom, like, it wouldn't have been able to get off the ground in general, because like, we couldn't get enough like players in terms of like balancing out the JP Apex side and the NA side.

26
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:24,050
And also being able to have like the amount of like, I guess, like, what's the word?

27
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:33,670
Like have enough star power in there that we would have interest from sponsors and have interest from outside communities as well to watch this event.

28
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,450
Because this is my, like, this is like the first one too.

29
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:44,350
So we also have to remember that this is like the first time I did these types of events and stuff.

30
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,930
So like, it was, I wanted to have a splash in it too.

31
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:57,610
So like, there will be eyes on this event in regards to having it so that people would be like, oh, this is, this is a curious thing.

32
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,610
And of course, this is my first time organizing it.

33
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,130
So it was incredibly rough.

34
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,570
It was incredibly rough getting 60 people to agree with each other.

35
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:22,210
So yeah, so it was incredibly rough getting 60 people there.

36
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,110
We had some last minute,

37
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,230
like I cried almost every day because I had to fix a fire that was going on.

38
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,610
Like, it was a huge struggle making this work.

39
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,650
And, and I'm really happy that in the end it's over.

40
00:07:46,910 --> 00:08:00,150
And, and that even as a first event, I would say that it was, it was like, I want to say pretty successful because we did have like issues regarding balancing issues.

41
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:07,270
But like, we did the best we could as the first event from three people trying to make it work.

42
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,270
And like, obviously there's a lot to improve on.

43
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,970
There's a lot I can improve on for next time.

44
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:33,110
Because I said a first event is, every event I plan is a new hurdle I have to learn and a new hurdle that I have to learn to do because like WrestleTuber has improved from his previous iteration because I learned from it.

45
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,650
Like every iteration I get better at like hosting specific types of events.

46
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:50,230
So I hope if I ever do another competitive event, I can learn from this one on how to balance it more properly and how to like figure out the schematics for it.

47
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:57,170
I wouldn't have been able to do this without, um, without Tempo's help and Dash's help.

48
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,450
Dash for like translating everything on, like translating everything, um, and like helping me with communicating with uh the JP side.

49
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,390
He got paid for it.

50
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,310
I mean, he's gonna get paid.

51
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,970
I haven't paid him yet.

52
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,430
I pay, I'm gonna be paying him.

53
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,770
I'll pay him with the money I won from, you know, like I won the last game.

54
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,090
Um, so I'll pay him from the money I got to keep from the last game.

55
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:31,090
And Tempo for, he literally did the paperwork for the sponsor within a day, um, to get it all running and everything.

56
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,350
So like a huge shout out to Tempo.

57
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,650
Um, it wasn't even originally gonna be sponsored.

58
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,430
Um, this event wasn't even originally gonna be sponsored.

59
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:48,230
We managed to secure, well, I was very persistent because I was like, hey, yay, ha ha ha, like this is gonna be a pre.

60
00:09:48,390 --> 00:10:01,270
This is also why, um, I try to make it like have some, I try to balance it out with like having some star power in there and also like, um, giving chance to other indies or other smaller companies and stuff.

61
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,890
Um, a chance to, uh, um, to be part of it as well.

62
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,530
Um, but it does help regarding getting sponsors.

63
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:22,210
So we didn't have sponsors at first, but when we finally got the team list of everybody, um, um, like we managed to secure a sponsor with like EA, um, within like last minute.

64
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,330
And that's why like we didn't announce it when we first announced it because it was all negotiating and everything.

65
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,430
So, um, I was like being like, hey EA, ha ha.

66
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,690
I'll be like, I'll be like, knock knock EA.

67
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,530
Hey, like I'm doing this.

68
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,230
Are you sure you don't wanna, you know, and then like no reply.

69
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,130
And I'll be like, hey EA, I'm doing this.

70
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,830
I'm still doing this.

71
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,330
Um, and like, you know, here's like stuff I organized and here's like all the information.

72
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,610
And then like, no, I don't really hear anything.

73
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,070
And I'll be like, knock, knock.

74
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:49,650
Ha ha.

75
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,070
Hey, I know I just messaged you yesterday about this, but I'm going to message you again.

76
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,810
And then EA's like, you know what?

77
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,690
Yeah, let's do it.

78
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,010
And I'm like, thank you.

79
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,570
I'm like, thank you so much.

80
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,110
Oh my God.

81
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,290
I really, I really appreciate it.

82
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:19,550
I'm so sorry for being, I'm so sorry for the spam, but I really appreciate it.

83
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,090
Um, oh my God.

84
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:33,370
Um, but yeah, I really appreciated like, uh, um, EA for sponsoring the prize pool and everything and like potentially working with them in the future.

85
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:40,970
Cause they, we talked about it, like MeTempo and you were talking about it and how, um, they were like wondering, would I like to do more events in the future with them?

86
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,750
Um, for next year, for 2025, obviously like from this, this is like my pilot episode.

87
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,490
Um, there's definitely a lot more I can improve on.

88
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:59,250
Um, I definitely are gonna look, the reason why there was no rank limit is because some, some VTubers don't have like people they know that can fit the rank requirement.

89
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,790
So that's why I was just like, well, on JP's side is very easy.

90
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,890
It's incredibly easy for them to find another master players or another Pred player.

91
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:14,470
Um, but in NA side, it was very difficult for teams to be able to find players that are like masters and Preds as well.

92
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,050
So, um, so it was very difficult.

93
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:27,270
So that's why I had to go with no rank limit because if I give them a rank limit, um, they won't be able to like, able to fit this requirement.

94
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:38,270
So like at that point I was just like, okay, we'll just, we'll have to go with no rank limit because, um, that's why we, it was very difficult for like both sides to be able to like adjust to it.

95
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,050
And with that, I went with the mindset where like, I'll just nerf the really good teams as we go along.

96
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,570
Um, yeah.

97
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:52,970
And, uh, I'll just be like, I'll just, we'll just like, uh, we'll just nerf the teams, uh, as we go along.

98
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,270
Uh, so like that we could like balance it out as the games go on.

99
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,550
And that's why I was like pushing Greek and Wig to be like, Hey, let's do some nerfs.

100
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,570
And we're like, let's buff some teams and stuff like that.

101
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:19,330
Um, and we, we had, we wanted to push the more casual aspect, but of course it is harder to push the casual aspect when we have like, um, you know, when it's like, uh, uh, lots of different skill levels are involved.

102
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:26,910
And I'm, I'm happy that, um, I, I did send personal apologies to the teams that had it rough the most.

103
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,630
Um, because I did feel really bad.

104
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,050
I was like, I wanted everyone to have like a good experience.

105
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,630
So I did feel bad for the teams that did have, cause like, you know, there's 20 teams.

106
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,870
There has to be teams that are like 20th place or 19th place or 18th place.

107
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:44,070
Like it's a, it's a, it's a custom, but it still has competitive factors in there.

108
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,070
So like, I just send some personal apologies to teams that were like placed at the bottom.

109
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,410
Um, because of course, like I wanted them to have fun, um, and everything.

110
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:02,770
So, um, I just send like personal apologies and stuff to them and hope that I was like in my next big event, I hope you, that you guys are, um, willing to join my next event.

111
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,930
And like, it's more the next event I'm planning on is less skill-based.

112
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,330
I'm not like planning it at the moment.

113
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,270
Like, I mean, it is sort of semi-planned.

114
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,950
I have a team running for it.

115
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,630
Like the team on standby work, that's going to be working on it when they've done with their next pro last project.

116
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,230
Well, cause they're this like team that I have, they do like other stuff for other people.

117
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,510
So, um, like, like the, regarding the, what event I'm doing, they've, they have, they've done it before for others.

118
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,110
So, um, they have a, they have a, you know, schedule.

119
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,210
So like they're taking mine in like 2025.

120
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:39,170
So like, uh, I will be, it's going to be less competitive base.

121
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,470
It's going to be all VTubers, um, for this next one.

122
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,570
And, uh, so, uh, this is like the next, that's my next.

123
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,990
And I still told, I apologize to the team.

124
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,110
I was like, I would love to have you guys like back again, um, for this next event that I'm doing.

125
00:14:52,490 --> 00:15:01,010
Um, but it's more so like, it's not like this, the one in the apex one is more so of like, it's more, um, like it's definitely we're pushing the casual up more.

126
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,550
Um, we're definitely, uh, pushing the casual aspect more for the next one because this one was more competitive.

127
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:14,530
This one was like semi-competitive, but the next one will be, we're going to try to push the casual aspect for it next time.

128
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,930
Um, um, but always tempo in chat.

129
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,730
Where is he?

130
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,710
I don't see him cause I know he's not subscribed.

131
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,650
So I'm trying to look for a, a gray name.

132
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,370
Wait, not subscribe.

133
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,310
No, he's not a member.

134
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,070
Uh, only seven teams per game storm point only apex car.

135
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,670
These can only shoot.

136
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,450
Oh my God.

137
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,890
Oh, that's crazy.

138
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,790
The thing is we can only have seven teams.

139
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,890
The entire tournament would just be seven teams.

140
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,690
What are we going to do with the other seven?

141
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,310
I mean,

142
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:14,390
we could have it, so that we have three lobbies going on three lobbies going on like, like BLGS, we have like several lobbies going on and then like, Oh my God, that'd be crazy.

143
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:24,570
Um, but yeah, um, he has asked, has asked us if we're open to, uh, like looking into like doing more customs, um, in the future for apex.

144
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,470
So that's something for like tempo and I to look into in the future in 2025.

145
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,810
Um, no, no, no.

146
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,490
Thank you for the 10 gift.

147
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,070
Thank you.

148
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,490
Thank you.

149
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,650
I really appreciate it.

150
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,330
Um, um, but I hope EA likes it tempo.

151
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,970
I hope EA liked the event.

152
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,350
I hope they like watch the event too.

153
00:16:47,970 --> 00:17:02,490
Um, um, so, um, yeah, it'll be, uh, really, uh, it's like, you know, I learned a lot for this and I, I really appreciate everybody for participating.

154
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:09,370
Um, everyone for participating, all the teams I invited, all the people that applied to be invited, um, a huge shout out.

155
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:17,850
And, um, you know, I tried to make sure everybody's wish came true because like I said, I heard, uh, QP was a huge fan of nice wig.

156
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:26,250
And, um, you know, I know I said like only winners who get to have a chance to talk to wig, but I know that, Oh wait, check discord DM.

157
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's funny.

158
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,580
Oh, wow.

159
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,840
That's pretty.

160
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,380
Um, yeah.

161
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Um, um, but yeah, that's the, yeah.

162
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,860
Do I say it?

163
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,240
Tempo am I allowed to say it?

164
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,060
Is that fucked if I say it?

165
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,540
Will it, will it hurt?

166
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,640
Will it hurt us if I say it?

167
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,040
Tempo, I need to know.

168
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,400
Will it hurt us if I say it?

169
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,640
Tempo, please.

170
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,880
You're not typing back.

171
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,460
Tempo, you're not typing back.

172
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,660
See what?

173
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,400
Well, I don't know.

174
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,720
This is Tempo's decision.

175
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,560
If I say it or not, maybe not say it.

176
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:28,780
Okay.

177
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,700
I can't say it.

178
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,300
He's like, don't know.

179
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,120
Maybe don't.

180
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,740
Okay.

181
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,080
We'll never know.

182
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,320
We'll never know.

183
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,020
Just, um, but yes, I'm glad people really enjoyed it.

184
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,740
Um, I always want people to have fun.

185
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,340
I'm glad viewers, I'm glad viewers and players had a great time and everything.

186
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,300
Like I said, for, like I said, um, I knew QP was a huge fan of Wig.

187
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:07,520
So like, even though, like they didn't win, I know they were, our PR was trying really hard to help QP win, help QP and Suna win so that they have a chance to interact with Wig.

188
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,720
So that's why like, you know, I gave up my interview slot because I talked to Wig anyway.

189
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,080
So like all the time.

190
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,720
So it's like, like me and Jen, like we've talked to Wig a lot.

191
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,440
So like for us, we're like, okay, I don't know.

192
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,280
I don't know if Altair even cares to be fair.

193
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,560
I don't think Altair cares about the interview.

194
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,220
So I was just like, I know I should have asked Altair.

195
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:38,600
So I was like, I don't mind giving up our slot to like, you know, have a chance for like our PRs, QP and Suna to talk to Wig.

196
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,740
Cause this is like, you know, the first time they were able to actually interact with him, like directly.

197
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:53,160
So that's why I like, just try to make sure that everybody had a great time or had like enjoyed their experience.

198
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,340
Cause this is the first time, you know, ShibuyaHal has been organizing VSychio for like what, six years now?

199
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,200
Is it six years?

200
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,960
No, not six years.

201
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,180
It's Apex, it's not even six years.

202
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,440
Is it?

203
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,620
It's season six, right?

204
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,100
Like he's had like season six of VSychio and he has like an entire fucking team and everything.

205
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,380
Is Apex six years old?

206
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,080
I can't remember.

207
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,940
I know like this is, he's like four years.

208
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,360
Wait, four to five.

209
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,400
Like I know he's like season six, right?

210
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,140
Of VSychio.

211
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,820
Um, but like four years, four years of VSychio.

212
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,700
Oh my God.

213
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,060
Really?

214
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,420
Four years of VSychio?

215
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,620
How many seasons has VSychio had though?

216
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,200
I thought it was more, but he, you know, he has an entire team and he has like some, I have to start somewhere.

217
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,880
Oh yeah.

218
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,580
Six, yeah.

219
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,000
It was like six VSychio seasons.

220
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,240
So like, you know, his first VSychio, you know, it was the first time and he keeps building it up more and more.

221
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,940
Um, this is basically me first time.

222
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,300
I hope to build it up more and more regarding events in the future.

223
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,880
Um, and learn from my mistakes and try to get better at it as I go along.

224
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,160
And, um, yeah, he has like, he has 30 people.

225
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,180
It was me, Tempo, and Dash.

226
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,960
It's not a competition.

227
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,620
We definitely, we definitely needed more people.

228
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,860
Um, we will definitely, we learn.

229
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,300
Oh my God.

230
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,760
Um, but yes, like definitely want to improve more so of hosting events.

231
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,980
Like Tempo has a lot of experience with hosting events.

232
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,180
And then I have some experience doing like Apex, not Apex, VTuber events.

233
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,240
So we like combined our, um, combined like what we know together and everything.

234
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,820
I, I like yelled and raged at Tempo so much the last week, not at him.

235
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,680
I was raging and he gets to see like the ugly side of me.

236
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,180
Tempo's like, you got to stop stressing out.

237
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,980
And then I was like, no, I'm going to fucking, I'm gonna cry.

238
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,560
I'm gonna cry.

239
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,120
I'm gonna have a breakdown.

240
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,520
I'm gonna break down Tempo.

241
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,700
I fucking hate this.

242
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,220
I'm going to have a fucking breakdown.

243
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,520
And then Tempo was super fucking chill.

244
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,380
Um, you know, I went so Manhera.

245
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,320
No, you guys don't understand.

246
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,120
I was super Manhera throughout all of this.

247
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,100
Like I begged not, okay.

248
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,780
I not, okay.

249
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,480
I don't know why I say beg is the right word.

250
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:29,260
I was like, in fact, I really, um, I really need like, uh, I need your help because, um, when reps, uh, couldn't make it, um, they, they really want, we like had to give them a list of people.

251
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,160
And I was like, they really want to play with Hocus.

252
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,080
And I was like, in fact, like, please, can you please get Hocus in?

253
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,300
We, we really, really need Hocus in like, please.

254
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:50,140
And then in fact, like I stayed up till like 4am because like, um, 4 or 5am.

255
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,340
And then I, uh, I was just really happy that like, if I got back to me and he was like, I've got him.

256
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,360
And I was like, Oh, thank.

257
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,620
And then, but in fact was like, actually said yes a lot earlier, but I just forgot to tell you.

258
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,030
It's okay.

259
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,610
It's fine.

260
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,130
I just, I'm just happy.

261
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,610
I'm so sorry.

262
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,290
I just forgot to tell you.

263
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:42,350
So like, I was so happy that like, we, we actually got, um, we actually managed to get like, uh, like a backup in time, um, for, uh, Tsukumo's team.

264
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:42,890
I don't know.

265
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,050
I hope they had fun.

266
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:50,670
Um, did anyone who watched their POV, Hocus's, uh, team's POV, did they have fun?

267
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:58,670
I heard they were the passion English team because they really wanted to play with like NA slash EU pro.

268
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,490
Well, at first we were like NA only.

269
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:07,670
And then, um, and then like, we're like, okay, um, we, we can't be picky anymore.

270
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:18,770
So we'll just, so I hope that, um, Hocus's team, um, had fun with passion English with each other.

271
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:29,550
Um, so yeah, like, and for Hocus for literally being an emergency sub with less than 10 hours left.

272
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,610
So like when the tournament, when the custom started, it was, it was 3am for him.

273
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:47,210
So like, um, so, uh, I really, uh, I'm really happy that, uh, Hocus actually stayed, like, you know, played the custom at three in the morning on his end.

274
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,130
Also like, I'm sorry for this.

275
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,450
I don't know Tempo, what happened?

276
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,670
Why were servers being weird?

277
00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:04,910
Like, and also like, I said an apology to Kuro because like, I was just like, I'm so sorry you had to play with 300 ping.

278
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,870
I'm really sorry.

279
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:18,450
Cause I didn't realize that, like, I don't know why we, Tempo was saying that like, um, it was supposed to be Oregon, but for some reason it was just not.

280
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,970
And Kuro was like, no, it's funny.

281
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:28,430
That's, it was like, no, it was really funny.

282
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:28,970
It's okay.

283
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:45,930
So, so, um, um, so like, uh, I had no idea why, why it was like, okay, but like, Ditto won.

284
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,090
So she won like 5, 1.5k.

285
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,310
And Kuro's like, no, no, it's fine.

286
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,730
Like it's actually, it was actually really funny.

287
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:13,310
Like, so, um, um, um, so like, I really appreciate it, even though like, like, I don't know why we specifically try to push for Oregon into the servers, but they kept swapping about the code.

288
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,650
Thank you for the five gift of ships.

289
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,090
Thank you.

290
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,850
Thank you.

291
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:33,050
Um, but yeah, um, honestly, like, um, it's such a, it was such a learning experience and I'm happy that in the end, like, um, everyone like had fun, um, and like had even the, you know, have a little bit fun too.

292
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,790
It was a great, a great thing as well.

293
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:59,490
Um, but yeah, I like, I think like if we could find a way to stabilize, I think like, I think honestly, just be easier to, if we want to invite JP and APAC people over again, I would say maybe it would be easier to put it at JP servers.

294
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:14,410
Um, but like, it depends on, but then like, that's the thing, like, I don't know, like, um, because like I said, like, we're screwing over one region over the other, because like APAC was the one that had to go with like the 200 to 300 ping and NA was fine,

295
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,770
um, because, you know, we were in NA.

296
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:30,310
Um, so it was honestly, like, you know, it's, it's, it's really hard to figure, because like, you know, if it was NA, then like, if we get to have it specifically in Oregon, then we fine.

297
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,790
Or we can like go back and forth.

298
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,730
I guess like in the future, if we do another APAC thing, we could swap servers back and forth.

299
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,730
So like one game will be in Oregon, the other one will be in JP, and then stuff like that.

300
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:51,210
So like, it might have tried to pull people, because we can test out a few servers days of, uh, a few servers days of before the games.

301
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,650
That's true, because we did sneak in EU players in.

302
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,830
It might have been like, well, but it was like three people.

303
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:07,390
We like, we sneaked three EU players in tempo, but I don't know how the fuck they changed the whole thing.

304
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,030
They, they changed the whole system.

305
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:17,910
Like, oh, three people fucked up the entire server.

306
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,570
Burrito, thank you for the akasupa.

307
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,970
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,370
Um, um, hi Doki.

309
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:37,750
Uh, I just want to know that the incredible effort and care you put into everything you do is very noticeable in seriously elevated the word dragoon from a simple fanbase to the title of January pile.

310
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,430
Thank you, I'm really happy.

311
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,710
Um, PSU tween that you've been slacking was wild.

312
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,690
Thank you, the akasupa, thank you, thank you.

313
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:56,350
What I meant by, like, slacking, as in like, I felt like I haven't been giving you guys enough, like, appreciation and gifts and stuff, because I know in the past I give you guys a lot of gifts and everything, and I felt like, oh my gosh, and like, you know,

314
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:00,370
I, the merch stuff is still, like, oh yeah, merch update.

315
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,510
We have everything.

316
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:20,010
We're shipping them but I'm sorry, you guys didn't know, Canada post is, um, Canada post is so shut down, so we can't ship products to Canada or international or outside of the, we can ship things only to the United States right now.

317
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,810
So, like, I don't know, things just keep going weird for me.

318
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:37,550
So, we have post office, post office has been shut down for, like, two plus months now and, like, we can only send things to the United States.

319
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:45,370
So, I'm sorry, we have everything now for the merch to start to, like, fix, ship the merch that we're so old.

320
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:56,150
Um, so, so, um, we just gotta wait until the post office strike is over and then it will be fine.

321
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,230
It'll be fine.

322
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,810
But yeah, like, I always want to show my appreciation for you guys.

323
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:19,730
I always want to show you guys that it really means a lot how much you guys care for me and, uh, uh, care for me and, like, support me through everything and, like, I know I have, like, so much stuff that's, like, been on the back burner and everything and I'm really sorry.

324
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,170
I'm really sorry.

325
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:34,250
That's why, like, there's, like, some stuff I haven't even shipped yet from the auction, from the charity auction, because of the post office strike when I finally got everything, like, postcards and everything signed and ready to send over.

326
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,270
The Canada post went on strike.

327
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,090
I'm so sorry.

328
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,210
I'm so sorry.

329
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,850
Oh my god.

330
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:53,490
Um, but yeah, I just, things just sometimes just doesn't work out in the end, but I hope it fixes itself and I hope it fixes itself soon.

331
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,220
Um, Nisuga, thank you for the super chat.

332
00:30:59,300 --> 00:30:59,460
Thank you.

333
00:30:59,500 --> 00:30:59,820
Thank you.

334
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,380
He gave us already of us, uh, uh, enough already.

335
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,320
Thank you for the super chat.

336
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:04,640
Thank you.

337
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,180
Thank you.

338
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,080
That really means a lot, guys.

339
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,980
Also, Hatch, welcome to the tomato farm.

340
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,300
Welcome.

341
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:09,820
Welcome.

342
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,020
Um, um, but yeah, like, thank you guys.

343
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,560
Um, I'm glad that the event, the custom, was a success.

344
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:24,540
Like, I, it's very serious talk, but like, it's more so of like, um, I guess, like, what's the word?

345
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,520
Um, just, uh, talking about, ah, what's the word?

346
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,000
Like, just going through what we, what we did and everything for the custom.

347
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,560
Um, what's that word?

348
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,600
Ah, it starts with an R, right?

349
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:46,320
Uh, just analyzing, like, a debrief, analyzing every, recap, sorry.

350
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,720
Yeah, the, this is a recap.

351
00:31:48,060 --> 00:32:07,220
Just going through the recap of everything and, uh, retrospect, I guess, reflecting, yeah, reflecting, reflecting and reviewing, um, everything that, uh, uh, uh, that's been, uh, that we went through to get this to work.

352
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:13,520
And, um, yeah, like, I learned so much from Tempo on how he fucking does it.

353
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:23,540
Like, I straight up, when I was having my 57th breakdown over this custom, um, I was just like, how do you keep doing this every day?

354
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,160
Like, how do you, how do you do this to yourself?

355
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,260
Like, and he's like, you just gotta stop stressing out about it.

356
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,960
And I'm like, I can't, I care too much.

357
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,160
His blacklist is insane.

358
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,700
He has multiple blacklists.

359
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,500
Yes, yes, no, not one blacklist, multiple blacklists.

360
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,160
Um, um, but yeah, like, I, I do care.

361
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,280
I care too much.

362
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,980
Uh, that's why I care way too.

363
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,100
I care so much.

364
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:14,260
Um, I will be taking a little break before going into working on my next event because I have like a million things to catch up on.

365
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:21,520
Like, I have so much stuff that I'm behind on just because of this custom.

366
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:28,220
Like, instead of working on things I have to work on, I was working on this custom and I felt so bad.

367
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,980
I felt so bad.

368
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,660
I'm sorry.

369
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,440
I'm sorry to my staff.

370
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,700
They're just like, you're supposed to work on this.

371
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,600
And I'm like, well, I was supposed to.

372
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,540
You're right.

373
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,640
I am supposed to work on this.

374
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,820
Um, Cas, thank you for the magenta soup.

375
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,500
Thank you.

376
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,060
Thank you.

377
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,580
Hey Doki, I know you'll do even better next event.

378
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,900
Thanks for organizing such a fun event on my birthday.

379
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,900
Very proud of all the things you do.

380
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,720
I look forward to your content in the rest of this month.

381
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,240
Huge love.

382
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,240
Thank you for the magenta soup.

383
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,480
Thank you.

384
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,020
Thank you.

385
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,820
And happy birthday to you, Cas.

386
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,060
Happy birthday to you.

387
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,940
Happy birthday to you.

388
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,960
Happy birthday, dear Cas.

389
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,100
Happy birthday to you.

390
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,740
Yeah.

391
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,820
Happy birthday.

392
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,020
Oh my God.

393
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:20,760
Oh yeah.

394
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,860
By the way, for those who don't follow me on Twitter, I posted a birthday artwork.

395
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
This artwork I had finished for months now.

396
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,980
I was going to make it into merchandise, but I wanted to fix my issue.

397
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:52,800
I don't want to milk you guys for merch and stuff because I want to fix my issues before I release merch because I want to make sure I have no backlog anymore for personal merch that I produce from my own personal store.

398
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,220
That's why I just decided to release it because I already have a new birthday art.

399
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,720
I don't want to reuse it for next year.

400
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,760
And I was like, just release it for today.

401
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,740
Today is just a normal day.

402
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,540
And I thought it was the perfect day to release the birthday art for free to everyone.

403
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,980
Just don't profit off of it.

404
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,860
You can make it into merch.

405
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,960
You can make it into an acrylic stand.

406
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,080
You can make it into a poster, a print, or anything.

407
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,400
Just don't sell it.

408
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,860
Don't monetize it or anything.

409
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,980
That's all that matters.

410
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,720
I think one of my mods can link it if they're online.

411
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:35,300
Link the birthday art that I released so you guys can make merchandise off of it in any way you want.

412
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,020
Like not merch, sorry.

413
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,220
You can make... I mean, yes, merch.

414
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,200
You can make your own personal merch off of it yourself.

415
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,940
Because I didn't want to, you know, I want to fix my... I want to make sure we had no more backlog.

416
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,900
I would have no more backlog regarding merchandising and stuff.

417
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,740
I mean, I have other stuff, but that's like from other companies.

418
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,760
That was from like other companies and stuff that's distributing it for us.

419
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,040
So like, I don't have to worry about it.

420
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,500
Like GamerStuffs and stuff like that.

421
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,500
Also, like I said, there's four more days left for GamerStuffs stuff.

422
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:28,360
So like, it really means a lot if you guys would be able to support via GamerStuffs because they do a lot regarding supporting me and supporting... and just, you know, they literally made the merch, like made the pins and the medals for free.

423
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,580
So yeah, like I said, huge shout out to GamerStuffs for the support on that.

424
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,640
I would love to have a Doki bird flavor.

425
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,440
I don't know what I would get, honestly.

426
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,860
I hope I made enough sales for it.

427
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,400
That's really it.

428
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,860
Also, you guys didn't see, I got nominated for a couple of stuff at the VTuber Awards.

429
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:54,100
So it really means a lot if you guys could vote for me for WrestleTuber, FPS, VTuber of the Year.

430
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,400
I don't fucking know if I'll actually get it because the competition is incredibly tough.

431
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,320
I haven't even tweeted out about it.

432
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,940
Wait, when does the voting close?

433
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,800
And also you guys got nominated too for Dragoon.

434
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,180
Okay, wait, when does it close, guys?

435
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,340
When does the voting close?

436
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,820
Because it's gonna be awkward if, like, I tweet about it and it closes.

437
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:12,820
Okay.

438
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,280
It doesn't even say!

439
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,320
Okay, let's just hope when I tweet it out tomorrow that it's still open.

440
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,160
Um, wait, they don't even say it!

441
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,620
Oh, fuck!

442
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,620
What?

443
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,840
They don't even say it!

444
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,820
Um, we can vote again.

445
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,540
I don't know.

446
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,840
Making a Google account is...

447
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,840
No, I'm joking.

448
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,020
I'm joking.

449
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:55,320
But yeah, anyway, also huge shout out to, uh, Wig and, uh, Greek for casting for free.

450
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:01,440
Uh, um, because, like, like I said, um, I really appreciate it.

451
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,160
They were like, you're- he was like, bro, bro, you're a homie.

452
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:10,460
Of course I'll do it for free because, uh, I was really worried about, like, um, if they would be able to do it or anything.

453
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,200
And, like, I was willing to pay them too.

454
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,080
I was like, no, it's okay.

455
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,720
I can pay you guys.

456
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,520
But they're like, no, no, you're a homie.

457
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:30,540
Like, and the fact that voter fraud in the stream- guys, guys, I'm not saying that you guys should commit voter fraud, but, like, I'm saying that, like, I bet other people do it, but I would not encourage it.

458
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,300
But, like, obviously you all have free will.

459
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,600
So, like, I can't stop you guys, but, like, it is frowned upon.

460
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,300
Oh,

461
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:59,880
man, it would be a shame if I planted an idea, like, in people's heads and, like, welcome to student council!

462
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,500
It's a fucking popularity contest.

463
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,220
Um,

464
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
um, what was I gonna say?

465
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:42,240
Uh, but, yeah, uh, I'm, like, I'm just, like, um, you know, like, post-event, uh, post-event emotions.

466
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,540
I'm just happy that, you know, things went okay.

467
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,440
Um, people had fun.

468
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,280
A lot of players were saying how much fun they had overall.

469
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,160
That's what I want.

470
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,100
I want people to have fun.

471
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,040
I want people to make memories.

472
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,100
Um, JP really liked it.

473
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:12,360
So, that's a bonus for me because I know that JP, either they know who I am and, like, they know who I am, but not, like, they know who I or they don't know who I am.

474
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,120
And, like, I'm happy that they enjoyed it.

475
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,260
And that, that means a lot.

476
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,040
I'm just, I'm just really, I'm just happy that they enjoyed the custom.

477
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:43,800
And that, um, um, um, and that Wig and Greek had a lot of fun, too.

478
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,580
I think they had fun nerfing people.

479
00:40:45,780 --> 00:41:03,440
I think, I think, um, I think they, I'm glad that Wig and Greek had a lot of fun nerfing players and stuff and, like, terrorizing the NA pros in the scene.

480
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,300
Yeah.

481
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,020
Yeah, especially Greek.

482
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,360
Greek was coming up with all these fucking wild ass nerfs and stuff.

483
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,970
And me, I literally said, what do you guys want?

484
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,110
And then they're like, oh, we get to decide.

485
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,810
Oh, they were the ones that was, like, coming up with the fucking shit, the nerfs and everything.

486
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:35,890
What's fucked up was Tempo doxing my location to the hiders when I found my first victim.

487
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,250
That, that was fucked.

488
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,850
If anything was fucked up, that was the fucked up part.

489
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:50,930
Literally, literally, I finally found one guy and then Tempo was like, by the way, Doki's over here.

490
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,370
And I was like, what the?

491
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:58,490
And then that one guy I found fucking disappeared.

492
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,610
So, uh, so yeah, anyway.

493
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:21,370
So, um, that's why I, that was the thing I got mad about.

494
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:33,270
Okay, okay, I think, but then also it was really funny when I tricked several people into thinking I was a hider.

495
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,770
Like, I was like, why do you think a fucking hider would be a ballistic?

496
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:50,230
And then the fact that, like, people, several hiders thought I was, I was part of their team.

497
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,870
I was like, yes, yes.

498
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,550
You know where I got that idea from?

499
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,910
The very first hide and seek tournament with, and Timmy did that.

500
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,410
I think Timmy did, he didn't do that to me.

501
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,830
I think he did that to someone else.

502
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,090
And I remember that happening because I was watching it as a hider.

503
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:12,210
So thanks Timmy for teaching me the true strat.

504
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,410
Like, no, he did that.

505
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,910
He literally did that to, like, hiders.

506
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,550
And I, I literally stole his idea because I was like, oh, that's so evil.

507
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,090
I want to do that.

508
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,410
Like, that's, that's so fucking evil.

509
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:42,010
Um, so I'm glad I was able to pull that off.

510
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:46,110
Pull that off one time.

511
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,080
No, Chibidoki was felt so betrayed.

512
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,800
She was so excited to see.

513
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,560
I didn't know if that was just like, like, you know, I was just teabagging so they think I'm friendly.

514
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,060
Cause that's what I saw from, that's what I saw.

515
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,480
What, that's what I saw Timmy do.

516
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,300
That's what I saw Timmy do.

517
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,560
And I was like, oh my God, that's so evil.

518
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,840
Um, but I want to do.

519
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,540
I want to do it too.

520
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Yeah, it's Timmy's fault.

521
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,000
It was, um, it was all Timmy's fault.

522
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,000
Um, that's right.

523
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,380
Um, I mean, he fucking won by being a princess.

524
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,280
Literally, we all saw him not shoot his fucking gun and then he won.

525
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:55,520
Like, all he did was he took a shield in a box, stood there, and then people around him fucking died.

526
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,320
Like, I was like, what the fuck?

527
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,620
Like, I was like, they just, they just fucking, the other guy just had a heart attack.

528
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,780
Like what happened?

529
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,720
What happened to the other guy?

530
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,760
Like, did he have a heart attack?

531
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,020
Like, next scene.

532
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,000
Thank you for the super chat.

533
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,400
Thank you.

534
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:13,980
Thank you.

535
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,920
That's my evil Oshie.

536
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,000
Thank you for the super chat.

537
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,560
Thank you.

538
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,160
Thank you.

539
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,940
He literally just existed.

540
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:27,020
Like, um, yeah.

541
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah, that was crazy to watch, but it was crazy to watch other players do like what they were doing and stuff.

542
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,800
It was insane.

543
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,620
Like, um, it was very crazy to watch it all happen.

544
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:45,360
Um, um, but yeah, I'm glad people had so much fun and I'm glad you guys enjoyed watching.

545
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Um, I want to, my next event is definitely going to be an all VTuber event.

546
00:45:51,320 --> 00:46:06,020
The next Apex event, I will be doing still, it's still going to be like, because you, it's, you can, it, not you can't, but it's even harder to get an all VTuber, um, custom, especially within NA.

547
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:21,200
Like, um, to be able to like, have, uh, especially to, it's very difficult to, to be able to get one of those, because like I said, in NA, it's a lot, uh, it's a lot different for Apex as well.

548
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,500
For FPS games, I think it's just more so FPS games in general.

549
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:43,440
Um, FPS games in general, um, it's hard to organize for an all VTuber FPS, uh, event in NA versus like one in like JP or like JP because there's more VTubers in JP side that's like more known, um, for FPS and everything.

550
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,880
Um, but like if I, like, um, because EA wants us to do it, do this again in the future.

551
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,460
Um, 60 people too.

552
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,320
Yeah, 60 people as well.

553
00:46:52,640 --> 00:47:19,220
Um, but we will still go with the mixed format, um, until we have, there's more VTubers within FGC, um, IMO, I feel like there's more VTubers that's like willing, especially like the more like star power and stuff within FGC than there is for like specific FPS games.

554
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,120
So like, that's why it's just, it's very difficult.

555
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,680
Yeah, it's very difficult.

556
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:36,400
So like for definitely for future Apex events, it'll still be like a mixture of like Fleshies and VTubers, um, just because like to fill up the lobby and stuff.

557
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,280
And then like, um, especially when we want to be able to have sponsors and everything too.

558
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:53,180
Um, um, but we still try to invite like people from different backgrounds, different like backgrounds, different like view counts and everything like smaller indies, smaller companies and stuff like that.

559
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,280
And then bigger companies, bigger indies, we want to balance everything out.

560
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:03,460
Um, but yeah, like, um, FGC is definitely something I want to try out next time.

561
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:10,160
Um, because I know it's really popular in the VTubing community and I have messaged Sejam about it and stuff.

562
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:24,500
Obviously it's like, so at like, like we're just like, we just talked, like we just had exchanged like two or three messages, but then like I, it, I couldn't continue the messaging because I was busy with this fucking custom.

563
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,080
It's just ideas now and everything.

564
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,460
Um, but, um, um, yeah.

565
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,980
And, uh, definitely want to like look into like non-competitive stuff too.

566
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,740
My next event, it won't be super competitive and it'll be a full VTuber event.

567
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:49,300
Um, it'll be in 2025, obviously like nothing in December because like I'm already super packed in December.

568
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:58,540
Um, but 2025, where are in my next event that I want to try out would be something that's not super competitive and it will be an all VTuber event.

569
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,160
Um, I just hope people would still want to join.

570
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,940
I just hope people would still want to be part of it.

571
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,880
Um, no, web phishing is scary.

572
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,780
There's like a hacker going around in web phishing.

573
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:27,500
I don't know you guys, um, you guys like, uh, uh, know about the update, uh, regarding, uh, that, uh, web phishing.

574
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:33,020
There's like a hacker going around that's just like hacking into people's lobbies and banning them from people's lobbies.

575
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,580
And then there was, I don't know if it's like fixed though.

576
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,680
Is it over already?

577
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,540
Yeah.

578
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:39,660
Yeah.

579
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,300
There's like a bunch of people just...

580
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,300
Because it happened to Ruben.

581
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,440
He told me about it.

582
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:55,600
He was telling me that, uh, uh, some guy like went joined his lobby and then like doxxed his airport and stuff and like his viewers airports.

583
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:01,100
So like, I, I don't know if it's resolved or not, but like, I feel like, um, yeah.

584
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:08,320
And then he said he got like, he like, they like banned him from web, like they managed to like get him kicked out of webs phishing lobbies.

585
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:08,480
Yeah.

586
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,360
That's so scary.

587
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,760
Right?

588
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,160
That's so scary.

589
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,100
I was like, what the fuck?

590
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,720
And he's like, yeah, this random guy.

591
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,320
And that was like last week.

592
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:34,500
So I don't know if it's like fixed already, but I, even then I wouldn't like test it out until like a couple, like maybe a month or two because like it might be patched, but like if they're really persistent, I feel like they would, um, I feel like they would try to keep,

593
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,380
they would keep trying it.

594
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,760
Um, yeah, they're still, yeah.

595
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,600
So like, that's why I'm like, I don't want to touch web phishing for now because, um, because of the, I thought I was insane.

596
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,820
I was like, what?

597
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:51,380
Like, I'm glad we managed to play web phishing when it first came out.

598
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,480
So people won't ruin the fun.

599
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:02,000
Like, like I'm just happy we were able to, um, we were able to play it like when it first came out.

600
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,020
So like, we didn't have to worry about that shit.

601
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:12,140
Cause like when we started playing it, like it was so new and like nothing, there was just like, you know, there wasn't anything like bad going on.

602
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,420
Cause people were just like phishing.

603
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,060
Yay!

604
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,580
We're all just like, yippee!

605
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,400
Phishing!

606
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:36,220
Little did we know, little did we know it was gonna talk about, it was gonna get worse.

607
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:41,040
We were so innocent back then.

608
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,840
We were like, yippee!

609
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,560
Phishing!

610
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:58,220
But yeah, yeah, I'm just, I had a great time in general guys.

611
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:07,100
Um, I always have a great time with my Dragoons and like, I just want to say thank you guys for always supporting me and supporting another successful event.

612
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,500
Um, every event I learn more and more.

613
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,760
Um, I feel like every event I get better at organizing.

614
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,780
Um, because each time I take what I learned from a previous event and improve it.

615
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:25,340
And I always try to, I know like my events are a little bit special because I push very hard for prizes and physical memorabilia.

616
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:33,540
Because like, I know like streaming wise, um, you know, um, we're creating memories from stream.

617
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:41,020
I always thought that like having something physical that you get from it, um, means so much to people.

618
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:47,520
Especially like, even with the little thing, like the little pins I'm giving people, because you know, we are not going to be content creators forever.

619
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,340
Um, I know you guys are like, I'm going to watch you when you're fucking 80.

620
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,200
But like, silly you guys, I live forever.

621
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,360
I'll never be 80.

622
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:04,200
But like, um, I don't know, girls are ageless.

623
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:21,240
Uh, anyway, um, so like I try to push for physical prizes because, you know, when you, you know, maybe like 20 years down the line and you see like something you want in this silly little like apex event or the wrestling event and you like think back to and be like,

624
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:33,180
Oh my God, yeah, I was part of this event that like this person organized and like, like, like, like seeing a memorabilia, I always think like seeing a memorabilia is like, like something physical that you can get from it.

625
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:40,360
And then you just like brings back memories and stuff like, you know, I used to, you know, I did sports a lot and I would have like prizes and trophies and stuff like that.

626
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:46,540
And then, you know, you know, I want, you know, I got like MVP, but had the physical medal of me getting MVP.

627
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,540
And it was always was really close to my heart because I was like, I did that.

628
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,000
I had had that experience.

629
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,700
So like, it's always like I want people like especially VTubers to be like, I was pushed for it.

630
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,600
And I would be like, you know, you've managed to get this physical item.

631
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:06,300
And you can look back to it and be like, Oh my God, like, um, this was something I participated like 20 years ago.

632
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:24,480
And like, these are the memories I get looking at this and stuff versus like, you know, watching a VOD back because like, you know, I'd rather be able to have like something physical that you could look at it like physical trinkets and stuff like reminders of like what you've done in your streaming career and things like that.

633
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,380
And it's like a little collection too.

634
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:41,380
So like, you know, everybody who participates gets a little enamel pin as like a little collection, you know, every time maybe like you're you joined various events I've hosted and you have like a little collection of like these pins that you've you've like collected from me and stuff like that,

635
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,600
like a Pokemon trainer, like a gym leader.

636
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,440
So I, I try to push that a lot.

637
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:55,260
And I hope that every event I do will have some form of like physical prize or like physical trophy medals or like pins and stuff that I can give out to people.

638
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,560
Um, but yeah, anyway, thank you guys so much for coming.

639
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:08,280
Um, I really appreciate everybody for supporting me for this long.

640
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,440
And it's almost the end of the year.

641
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,600
It's almost the end of 2025 2024.

642
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,740
Sorry, fucking math numbers.

643
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,900
I'm not dinner yet, guys.

644
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,860
I don't know if that's noticeable.

645
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,840
But um, it's almost the end of 2024.

646
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:33,280
I feel like we've accomplished so much within like how many months has it been since I came back 12345678910.

647
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:41,760
In 10 months, we've done in 10 months, we have organized two big events, WrestleTuber and the Apex Custom.

648
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,540
We have our concert that's in two weeks.

649
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:54,920
No, in less than two weeks, we have a Nendoroid preorders that are coming out very, very soon.

650
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:09,880
We have done so many dream sponsors, we're going to be in we were in video, we got in game cosmetics, like being in Rust, having our very own personal Rust skin, we won multiple tournaments.

651
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:24,360
Under Doki Bird, we got nominated for vtuber of the year in two separate award nominations, we got nominated for two different vtubers of the year, even though I would have preferred gamer of the year and the other.

652
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:34,140
If I was given two, because like, you know, the other one was like, wow, Doki, it's so entitled.

653
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:41,400
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, because I, you know, the limit was two.

654
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:53,360
If I get to choose the limit, like choose between because I know I definitely could have been nominated for gamer of the year, but there's a two, there's a, there's a two limit.

655
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,900
I'm just saying.

656
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,200
If I win FPS, I should be gamer too.

657
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:06,730
Anyway.

658
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,450
We got that, we got, what else did we do?

659
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,790
We did, we did so many amazing collabs.

660
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:23,970
We've interacted with so many amazing people within 10 months.

661
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:32,730
And like we did, like, I think I did like eight plus conventions within 10 months, which is really crazy.

662
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:43,490
I'm gonna post photos of the other conventions too, because I know I stopped posting photos because I was so over, there was just so many things going on that I keep forgetting to post like recasts of conventions and everything.

663
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:50,510
We raised $256,000 for charity, which I have to still send out some of the stuff from the charity stuff.

664
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,350
So I'm really sorry if you're still waiting for those.

665
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:59,510
We got our own PC case and PC cast with Hyatt.

666
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,050
There's so many things we've accomplished within 10 months.

667
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:09,670
And it's actually really crazy that we were able to do all of this together.

668
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:19,330
And I really appreciate all of you guys for supporting me and like taking me this far and everything.

669
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,150
Hey guys, enough mushy stuff.

670
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,170
It's time to call it because I'm tired.

671
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:31,790
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

672
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,990
And if you stand for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

673
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,970
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

674
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:44,470
