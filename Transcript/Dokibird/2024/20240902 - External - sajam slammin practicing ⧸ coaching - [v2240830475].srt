326
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,480
hello.

327
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:15,920
Hello.

328
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,780
Hello.

329
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,620
Hello.

330
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,440
What's up, doggy?

331
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:20,640
I need help.

332
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:21,820
Okay.

333
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,360
I need help.

334
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,120
Help is on the way.

335
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,760
Help is on the way.

336
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:26,920
Help is on the way.

337
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,900
I'm in the middle of a match.

338
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,620
I'll try to wrap this up.

339
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,000
And then I got you.

340
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,300
Okay.

341
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:32,640
Alright, no problem.

342
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,360
So what's been going on?

343
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,880
You've been playing a little bit?

344
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,100
I am...

345
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,960
Okay, I just got to Silver.

346
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,240
But I was like hard stuck Bronze 5 for like 5 hours.

347
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,460
Okay.

348
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,020
And so I'm like... I can't...

349
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,600
Clearly, I'm doing something wrong.

350
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,080
And I was stuck in Bronze 5 for 5 hours.

351
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,480
No, you're making progress.

352
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,780
There's nothing wrong.

353
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,800
That's good.

354
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,600
I don't know what I'm doing.

355
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,320
I'm just...

356
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,520
I'm not doing any combos.

357
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,760
I'm just abusing the same moves over and over again.

358
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,000
No, that's fine.

359
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,500
That's fine.

360
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,080
You don't need combos.

361
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,380
You're playing Geef.

362
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:16,840
Oh, God.

363
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,680
You're playing Geef.

364
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,800
Oh, I hit Rematch.

365
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,100
My bad.

366
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,720
I was trying to...

367
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,520
Okay.

368
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,980
Just give me a few more minutes.

369
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,440
All right.

370
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:24,720
Sure.

371
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,460
Okay.

372
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,300
But you don't need combos as long as you have your strats.

373
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,060
Was there anything in particular?

374
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,600
I think I need better strats because I'm getting my ass beat.

375
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:37,660
Okay.

376
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,060
I definitely need better strats then.

377
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,660
Maybe this time I can watch you play some games and just see how it's going.

378
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,980
All right.

379
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,220
Because I kind of see it in the natural environment.

380
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,600
Meanwhile, I'm getting Geefed over here too.

381
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,540
We can watch my replays of my last couple of matches and just see what I'm...

382
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:18,800
Yeah, we can do that.

383
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,500
Yeah.

384
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,200
Give me some advice.

385
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,740
We can identify what we can patch up and exploit.

386
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:38,750
Is he dead?

387
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,170
No.

388
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:14,630
No.

389
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:15,330
No.

390
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:15,590
No.

391
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:15,790
No.

392
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:02,690
Okay.

393
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:04,290
Okay.

394
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,410
I'm ready.

395
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,210
So...

396
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:06,910
Yay.

397
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,710
What's your CFN again?

398
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,070
Okay.

399
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,690
It is this.

400
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,070
It is...

401
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,630
Oh my God.

402
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,370
I posted it onto the screen.

403
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,530
Okay.

404
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,670
Okay.

405
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,770
Let's see.

406
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,990
Not do Honda.

407
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,490
Not do Honda.

408
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:39,950
Honda.

409
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:51,350
So is there any particular replay that you think would be good to look at?

410
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:52,630
Like where you're super struggling or something?

411
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:52,910
I don't know.

412
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,750
Everything is now...

413
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,510
I did so many ranked matches.

414
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:56,870
Okay.

415
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,070
It's all a blur right now.

416
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,790
I don't even know.

417
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:01,550
Okay.

418
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,890
Let's look at a little...

419
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:03,290
Everything's a blur.

420
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,710
A loss and a win.

421
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:09,770
So I'm going to pull up one of your ranked matches right now.

422
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,250
Let's see.

423
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,890
I was stuck at 4,700 to 4,800 for like three of those hours.

424
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,750
I just kept going back and forth.

425
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,130
Okay.

426
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,490
I'm going to look at a Ryu match.

427
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:21,350
I don't know.

428
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:21,930
You won that one.

429
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,150
You kind of bodied them.

430
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,350
Good job.

431
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,190
Let's look at one where you lost.

432
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,010
You went back and forth with this person, actually.

433
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,510
Let's look at when they beat you and see what happened.

434
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,550
Add replay.

435
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:36,450
Let's add that.

436
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:37,930
Let's see how you beat them.

437
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,560
You're beating up on Kens, it looks like.

438
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:45,980
That's good.

439
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,440
A lot of these matches, you're going back and forth against these players.

440
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:54,600
I don't know.

441
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:57,960
They're not going to have as many players.

442
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,400
This is good.

443
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,000
You're adapting.

444
00:51:59,480 --> 00:51:59,800
Okay.

445
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:01,920
Let's see.

446
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:11,420
Okay.

447
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,760
I'm streaming on Twitch right now.

448
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,520
I don't know if you want me to screen share, or if you can watch it on Twitch.

449
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,100
I can watch it on...

450
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,300
I'll watch it on Twitch.

451
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:17,600
Yeah.

452
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:17,860
Okay.

453
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,040
Yeah.

454
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,980
Because I'm pulling up your, the first match here.

455
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,320
So this person, you ended up beating them in the first of two, which is good.

456
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,560
You know, one game is just one game.

457
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,800
But winning this set is what's important.

458
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,220
Did you mean to do that drive reversal?

459
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,080
That wake up move?

460
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,760
Is that a new thing you've been doing?

461
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,140
I didn't really talk to you about that.

462
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,100
I don't know.

463
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,980
I don't even know anymore.

464
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,320
That's not a bad idea.

465
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,160
Let me turn on...

466
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,000
Let's turn on your...

467
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,100
Oh, my inputs are mad.

468
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,560
We're going to show the inputs.

469
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,140
We're going to see the dark secrets behind what you're pressing.

470
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,600
I know for sure my inputs are fucking mad.

471
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,060
Okay, so...

472
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,200
Let's see.

473
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,240
It's okay.

474
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,080
Don't gotta be ashamed about mashing.

475
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:10,880
Okay, you're mashing.

476
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,420
See, you're mashing wake up DI there.

477
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,120
Hold on, I gotta get used to this control.

478
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,380
See how you mash wake up DI right here?

479
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,420
Yeah.

480
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,040
Maybe you're thinking like, oh, DI, like a panic move to like get them off you, like armor through.

481
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:31,420
But if you do this on wake up, just holding DI up, and forward, you do this move here, which pushes people off you.

482
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,380
And that's called the drive reversal.

483
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,020
And that's not a bad move, actually.

484
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,560
You can hold that.

485
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,400
Rather than mashing it, you just hold DI and forward on wake up.

486
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,100
Like, so you're on the ground, just hold those two buttons together.

487
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,380
And then when you wake up, you'll do this get off me move.

488
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,940
And it's a defensive option.

489
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,540
That's not a bad thing to do.

490
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,300
So if you want to do wake up DI, though, don't hold forward, just mash it without a direction.

491
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,560
If you want to do the wake up drive reversal, hold forward and mash it.

492
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,940
But that's a pretty good option.

493
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,360
To get them off you.

494
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,060
I didn't mention that before.

495
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:01,980
It's actually pretty good.

496
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,780
Okay, yeah, I was wondering why sometimes I do that and sometimes I'm not.

497
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,280
Yeah, if you want to just always get DI.

498
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:11,700
Gotcha.

499
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,360
Yeah, just do it without a direction if you want to get DI.

500
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,260
Okay, you're mashing... something.

501
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,800
What is...

502
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,600
Ah man, modern is so confusing.

503
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,240
Because I don't even know what you're mashing.

504
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,280
The game is just telling me...

505
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,820
Oh my god, hold on.

506
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,520
Stuff happens.

507
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,760
It's showing a fist icon.

508
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:31,560
I don't...

509
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,120
God, modern controls is so weird.

510
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:33,700
Sorry.

511
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,760
For 10 years we never had this and suddenly we have it.

512
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,100
I don't know what this... grab?

513
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:37,940
Is that what that is?

514
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,340
Okay, you're mashing grab.

515
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:39,940
Okay.

516
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,120
I didn't see a fucking fist icon.

517
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,200
Going crazy over there.

518
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,560
Yeah.

519
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,840
So that's not the move you want to mash.

520
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,000
So the one thing...

521
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,060
I can block.

522
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,420
Yeah, you can try block.

523
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:54,140
I know.

524
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,240
But the one thing I want you to mash is...

525
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,320
If we're going to mash, let's just try to make it square.

526
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,580
Crouching and then square.

527
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,980
That's the move you want to mash.

528
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,840
If you're going to mash.

529
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,420
It's going to happen.

530
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,980
You're going to panic and you're going to start mashing.

531
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,900
But let's try to make it square.

532
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,300
That's the one thing we can try in those situations.

533
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,480
Nice.

534
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,730
Yeah, I think you're getting knocked down and then he's just kind of smacking you around.

535
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:23,870
Yeah, when he...

536
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:26,790
When they smack me too much, I just...

537
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,750
I don't know what to do.

538
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:28,410
I'm just...

539
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,070
Blocking is good for that.

540
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,250
I just want them to get off of me.

541
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,670
Yeah, blocking is good for that.

542
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,270
It does...

543
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,970
It legitimately does work.

544
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,110
See how you block there and then you got to counterattack?

545
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:41,350
You block for a second and that let you do that DI.

546
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:42,810
Okay.

547
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:48,870
Nice jump.

548
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:49,970
That was godlike.

549
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,090
That was really good.

550
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,210
Oh, sorry.

551
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:52,630
Hold on.

552
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:53,810
Fucking controls.

553
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,390
I hate the replay controls.

554
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,490
Yeah, that jump in was really good.

555
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,730
And I like how you paused and then did the grab.

556
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:04,150
That's a perfect jump.

557
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:11,630
See, if you had done that again, so this time you did jump medium, which is jump X, right?

558
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,870
Yeah.

559
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:13,550
And that was a perfect jump.

560
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:18,510
And then you jumped again, which was a good jump also, but you didn't press anything there.

561
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,470
You didn't press the X.

562
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,690
If you did the exact same thing again, that would have beat him.

563
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,690
He wouldn't have been ready.

564
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,050
Oh.

565
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:24,850
Okay.

566
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,730
So, you have the idea of the jump.

567
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,090
Just always do that jump X at that range.

568
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:29,770
Okay.

569
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,990
And then, yeah, he just mashed.

570
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,910
Like, yeah.

571
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,570
I mean, he just committed.

572
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,550
Like, that's just a guess.

573
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,490
That's his big invincible super.

574
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:46,170
So, I mean, sometimes they guess with that.

575
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,450
If you try to do offense and you get hit by that, that's not a big deal.

576
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:53,890
The only thing I can say is, yeah, on wake up, just try to block a little bit more.

577
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,650
Or if mashing, we're mashing square.

578
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,070
And then those jumps, your jumps are actually really good.

579
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,730
Just press X.

580
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,810
Make sure to use it with jump X more often.

581
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:02,190
Okay.

582
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:03,550
You did it sometimes, but not other times.

583
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:08,170
And those times when you didn't do it, if you did press X, you would have bodied them for it.

584
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:09,170
Okay.

585
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,850
But is that the common theme?

586
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:15,310
Like, you feel like you're getting knocked down and then being mauled?

587
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:15,890
I just don't block.

588
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:16,770
I just...

589
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:18,030
Yeah.

590
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:25,730
Like, I would block at the next round when I realize, oh, they're fucking pummeling me.

591
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:26,290
Right.

592
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,650
Maybe I should start blocking.

593
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,750
But at that point, it's already too much.

594
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,030
It's too late.

595
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,230
Well, that wake up...

596
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,710
I just go, like, super aggressive first, and then...

597
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:34,170
Right.

598
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:34,910
And then...

599
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:42,770
But then there's some of them that are more used to, like, super aggressive plays, and then they aggro me back, and I was like, wait, you're not supposed to do that.

600
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:47,470
And then it takes my brain a bit to register, like, I should be blocking now.

601
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:47,870
Right.

602
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:48,170
Right.

603
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:48,350
Like...

604
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:51,750
Yeah.

605
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,250
Yeah, you're mashing every knockdown.

606
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,190
I like that run grab, though.

607
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,050
Okay.

608
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,410
Okay.

609
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,750
That wake up DI, I think, would be good to use.

610
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,690
I didn't teach you about that, but yeah, let's try doing that.

611
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:09,810
So just hold forward and DI and wake up, and you'll push them off you.

612
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:13,830
If they're mauling too hard, that's a guaranteed get off me move.

613
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,910
And so you don't have to block.

614
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,130
You can just hold forward and DI.

615
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:21,410
It costs a bar, though, so you can't do it forever, but I think that'll help you in a lot of these situations.

616
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:26,590
Yeah, that's tricky.

617
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,330
When they're in the air, you can't do the grab.

618
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:28,830
Yeah.

619
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:29,970
You can do the lariat.

620
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,210
It's like, what happened?

621
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:31,830
Yeah.

622
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,150
It's hard to recognize in the heat of the moment.

623
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,750
But if you can, instead of pressing triangle, do Dauntless Triangle there.

624
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:42,150
Nice.

625
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:51,310
Nice.

626
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,080
And I see you keep doing Crouch Fierce.

627
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,540
Oh, nice auto combo.

628
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,120
Okay.

629
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:02,720
Very nice.

630
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:03,840
Yeah.

631
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,960
When you're doing Crouch Fierce, are you trying to do one of the...

632
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,220
Oh, sorry.

633
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,860
By Crouch Fierce, I mean Crouch Circle.

634
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,180
Yeah.

635
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:10,620
Sorry.

636
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,720
I'm using...

637
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,800
That's not even Street Fighter terms.

638
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,480
That's like boomer Street Fighter terms.

639
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:14,660
Like the long kick?

640
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,980
Or the one where I spin?

641
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,840
There's one where he lunges with his arm upwards.

642
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,900
Oh, the forward down?

643
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:22,920
Oh, yeah.

644
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,940
The down circle is really bad.

645
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,360
The move you're not supposed to do.

646
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,800
I see you doing that a lot, actually.

647
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,880
I'm guessing you might be trying to do something else.

648
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,240
No.

649
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,220
Like the one where he does the little spinny kick when he lands on the floor.

650
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,300
That's for...

651
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:38,440
Okay.

652
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:38,720
Yeah.

653
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,940
So that's forward and circle.

654
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,060
There's that one.

655
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:41,480
Wait.

656
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,020
There's another?

657
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,500
There's like...

658
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,440
That circle has like five different moves based on every direction.

659
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:46,800
Okay.

660
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,100
So I think...

661
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,280
Because you keep doing the one with the punch where he like spins and punches up, and that move sucks.

662
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,580
Oh, that one.

663
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,520
Yeah.

664
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,580
So I'm trying to figure out what you're trying to do there.

665
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,180
But I'm guessing maybe you're trying to do like forward circle where he does the big cartwheel kick.

666
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,520
Yeah.

667
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,240
I'm trying to do that.

668
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:03,860
Okay.

669
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,520
Yeah.

670
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,000
I guess you just got to try to be a little bit more careful about your button presses there.

671
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,720
Like just hold forward when doing it.

672
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:14,080
Because the other one that you're not doing as much is just the circle without any direction.

673
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,400
And that one is really good.

674
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,520
We just like don't press any direction, then press circle or hold it.

675
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,060
And he does the big charge punch.

676
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:23,600
Like...

677
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,040
Okay.

678
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,080
That one I think you can do a little bit more.

679
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,060
Yeah.

680
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,280
That one I've been doing.

681
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,980
That one I've been doing after the cartwheel kick.

682
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,160
Okay.

683
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,360
Because then sometimes it hits.

684
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:35,840
That makes a lot of sense.

685
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:36,560
Yeah.

686
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,020
That's a really good move to do like after another attack.

687
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:40,420
Right?

688
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,480
Because then they're going to try to counter attack you and then you hold that.

689
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,580
That's a really smart idea.

690
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:50,980
So I would just say like all those times you're getting that down heavy punch, like sorry, down circle.

691
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:56,020
Just try to like be like, okay, let me like get my left hand out of the way here and just press circle.

692
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,560
And you'll get a much better move.

693
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,060
Yeah.

694
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,140
Yeah.

695
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:02,180
So that's a really good move.

696
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,080
I think you got fucking bodied on this one.

697
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:04,920
Akuma is tough.

698
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:05,680
Yeah.

699
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:06,940
Akuma is really hard.

700
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,220
Especially if they know how to actually throw fireballs.

701
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:14,700
Good start.

702
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:19,420
Nice.

703
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:19,900
Yeah.

704
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:20,980
Hell yeah.

705
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:31,930
Oh yeah.

706
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,090
He just starts grabbing me.

707
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,250
I'm like, what do I do?

708
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,270
I'm supposed to be the grabber.

709
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:38,390
Yeah.

710
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,670
He's grabbing you.

711
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:40,510
You got to grab him.

712
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:40,990
Grab back.

713
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,250
That's like the guess.

714
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:42,810
Yeah.

715
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,110
Like ideally on wake up.

716
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:44,590
Throw a loop.

717
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:45,410
Right.

718
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:50,550
So the idea should be like, is he going to hit me or throw me?

719
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,610
And that's why usually on wake up you block or tech throw.

720
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,990
And there's times where you definitely press buttons, like it gets more subtle.

721
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:03,050
But if you play someone who actually can hit you properly, you're going to be forced to block and wake up.

722
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:08,830
But the driver reversal, the forward and DI on wake up, that beats both hits and throws.

723
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:16,070
So that move, we should practice that because I think that'll help get all these players off you.

724
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,630
Like they're all kind of rushing you down.

725
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:18,370
Yeah.

726
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,910
That move will...

727
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,350
Nice.

728
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,810
Hell yeah.

729
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:24,310
I like that you recognize the level three and you start mashing it.

730
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:24,670
That's good.

731
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:27,310
Yeah.

732
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,390
It's my emergency.

733
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,830
No.

734
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:30,730
Perfect.

735
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,930
If I'm going to lose, I might as well use it.

736
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:35,950
Yeah.

737
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:39,410
If they're pressuring you, that's why that super is so valuable.

738
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,910
That never goes away, even at the highest level.

739
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,730
You're scared of that move.

740
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,890
So that's why people will back off.

741
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,150
These defense is kind of bad before that super.

742
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:52,270
So like getting mauled as Geif, it happens to all Geif players.

743
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:57,290
You did it again.

744
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:01,670
See, you just did wake up, driver reversal on accident, but it knocked him off you.

745
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,310
So if you can harness that...

746
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:04,410
Yeah.

747
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:04,730
Nice block.

748
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:06,570
Nice punish.

749
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,130
Oh, this guy's mashing.

750
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:09,390
Yeah.

751
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:11,170
Okay.

752
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,390
He got lucky.

753
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:16,490
He got lucky.

754
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,090
Yeah.

755
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:26,270
I think the only thing I can say is if you're far away from them and you're mashing on wake up, like there's no reason to match there because you're not even going to reach them.

756
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:32,890
You do need to like just try to let yourself stand up and maybe walk back and like try to get back in the game.

757
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:33,370
Yeah.

758
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,310
Yeah.

759
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:35,210
Yeah.

760
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:35,750
It's just...

761
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:37,390
Yeah.

762
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:38,050
I know.

763
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:38,070
I know.

764
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:39,990
My biggest weakness is zero defense.

765
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:41,350
Right.

766
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:42,010
Yeah.

767
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,430
I mean, that just takes time, right?

768
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:46,990
When you're in the heat of the match, all this coaching shit goes out the window.

769
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:48,070
So that's very normal.

770
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,290
But that's the only thing.

771
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,130
It's like if you're...

772
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:51,490
Yeah.

773
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,490
Do some panic mashing up close, but if you're at a distance that should be your time.

774
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:55,930
Like, okay.

775
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,070
They're far from me, like try to take a breather there.

776
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:59,870
And that's a break in the action.

777
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:03,570
Cause a lot of these characters are going to have fireballs and things like that, where they can...

778
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:03,810
Oh, yeah.

779
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,810
They can throw that out to lock you down, to keep you from mashing at that moment.

780
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:08,030
Yeah.

781
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,430
And you don't even have a move that can hit them from that far, really.

782
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,910
So there's not even...

783
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:15,650
Even if you mash and the move comes out, like, you're just gonna miss.

784
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:16,570
Right?

785
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,610
So that's kind of what you should be thinking.

786
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:23,270
Like, if you're in range to hit them with a move, then sometimes mashing, like, your square is good.

787
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,010
But if you're too far away, like, just be like, okay...

788
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,430
It's like a cat and mouse game with Gief.

789
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,870
Your whole thing, you're trying to get back in.

790
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:34,430
So if they knock you away, just accept that.

791
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:37,710
And then just try to wake up and, like, not mash.

792
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,370
And then try to work your way back in.

793
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:41,210
That's kind of the main idea.

794
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:50,030
Yeah, like, Chun-Li also has, like, a really good keep out game.

795
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:53,030
So she can throw fireballs from far away.

796
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,530
Oh, yeah.

797
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,810
Oh, yeah, this one.

798
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,630
No, I definitely got fucked here.

799
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:58,990
Silver too?

800
01:04:59,270 --> 01:04:59,650
Yeah.

801
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:00,630
Oh, they know.

802
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:00,970
They know.

803
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,230
What are you doing here?

804
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,490
You're literally so far above me.

805
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:07,070
And then I blocked you.

806
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:08,310
Wow.

807
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,850
We'll worry about that later.

808
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,010
I was like, I was not having a good time.

809
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:17,710
I was like, I don't want to fight her again.

810
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:18,990
Like...

811
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:20,410
Uh-oh.

812
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,530
Okay.

813
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,330
She clearly knows what she's doing.

814
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:32,830
Yeah, the Lariat, like, all those times you're pressing Lariat, I think just try to press Stand Fierce and...

815
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:33,930
Sorry, Circle.

816
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:35,430
Press Circle instead.

817
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,570
Instead of Triangle in those moments, Circle.

818
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,690
Like that, that spin move...

819
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:40,290
Yeah.

820
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:45,310
It's only good if they're already jumping or something, especially against opponents that start slowing down.

821
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,790
But you can just keep pressing Circle or, like, hold the Circle.

822
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:54,410
I was just like, oh, man, I think she's going to jump at me because she keeps jumping.

823
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,390
I don't know what to do when I get Perfect Parry.

824
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:59,590
Like, she just jumps behind me, like...

825
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:03,950
If you land a Perfect Parry and they're on the ground, just mash Triangle.

826
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:05,350
You get a free Command Grab.

827
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,870
So, yeah, if you are in a situation, you did it again.

828
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:11,330
See how good Wake Up Drive Reversal is?

829
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,690
You keep doing it on accident, that move is really good.

830
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,390
So, we'll go to Training Mode and practice that.

831
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,730
Yeah, this guy, they have combos.

832
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:21,770
They know what they're doing.

833
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:22,810
They have combos.

834
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:23,790
Yeah, they baited.

835
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:25,210
See, they knew about your Wake Up Level 3.

836
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:26,350
Yeah, they know what they're doing.

837
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:27,450
No!

838
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:29,410
Yeah.

839
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:31,290
That's understandable.

840
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,830
They were ready for the cheese.

841
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,530
They actually belong in that Elo.

842
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:41,830
But wait, you played them again.

843
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:42,850
So, you beat them?

844
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:43,650
Oh, it's a different one.

845
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:44,150
No, I played it different.

846
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:46,310
No, I blocked them and then I played it differently.

847
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:49,610
Frustration out on this Chun instead.

848
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,800
This person might be more your speed right now.

849
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,180
Yeah, they're not ready.

850
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,620
That's good to start with.

851
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,020
Yeah, I would start with that.

852
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,300
Because I'm like, if they don't block the first hit, most likely...

853
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,640
There's a chance they won't block the second one.

854
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:20,100
So then I was like, I'll just keep doing that until I realize that they know the matchup.

855
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:20,760
That's smart.

856
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,120
Yeah, if they don't jump it...

857
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:27,600
And the thing is, so in the tournament, they're gonna have coaches who will probably tell them, like, oh, jump that, and they might start adapting.

858
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:32,020
But it's definitely good to throw out in the beginning and just see what they know.

859
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,060
And, you know, just slow down if they start jumping it.

860
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,260
Nice DI.

861
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,400
Okay.

862
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,060
Not bad.

863
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:45,500
Not bad.

864
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:53,040
The only thing is, like, your jumps again is jump X.

865
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,940
You did a few jumps without the X.

866
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,460
Yeah.

867
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,740
Oh, that was sick, though.

868
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,560
That was sick.

869
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,100
Like, there you could have done jump X, right?

870
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,560
All the spaced out jump ins.

871
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,460
Just throw an X on your jump and it'll be even stronger.

872
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,000
Yeah, see that Lariat?

873
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,520
It's not doing anything for you.

874
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:22,140
All your other attack choices, I think, are really good.

875
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,240
I just feel like the down plus triangle, it's not really helping you out.

876
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,720
Yeah, it was just, like, bad prediction from my part.

877
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,520
Because I was like, maybe she'll jump.

878
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:38,520
Well, what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to, like, wait and react to the jump.

879
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:42,880
And it seems like you're getting kind of at that level you might be able to do that.

880
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,300
Nice punish.

881
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,260
Nice punish.

882
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,280
You could have done level three there.

883
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,040
That's the only thing.

884
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,720
Oh, okay.

885
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,700
I spoke into existence.

886
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,520
Yeah, wait for you to get up.

887
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,040
Oh, and then I missed.

888
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,920
No, that was that was a smart DI from them.

889
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:01,860
You had no option there.

890
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:02,500
Okay.

891
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,240
Wicked medium.

892
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,220
Yeah.

893
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:14,400
The only thing I would say is if you want to try to, like, do it the proper way, you can theoretically wait on the ground, see them in the air, and then press a down plus triangle.

894
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,920
That's an anti-air, right?

895
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:23,120
The whole theory with the jump ins is that you can react to it if you're not already busy thinking about other things.

896
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,480
So you don't need to press the lariat preemptively ever.

897
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,040
Okay.

898
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,400
I would say it's not even worth it to press preemptively.

899
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:37,520
I'd almost rather you let them jump and just stop thinking about lariat because I just don't think the lariat is helping you.

900
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,760
I think it just makes you kind of spin and then they punish you.

901
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:49,350
Then you're done.

902
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,370
You're beating up on Kens.

903
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:51,210
That's a good sign.

904
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:52,510
Ken is like...

905
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:56,230
I wish there was a Ken player on the beginner's side position.

906
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:56,830
Oh yeah?

907
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:57,830
You're confident it's Ken?

908
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:02,030
I think it's because Ken carries them all to platinum.

909
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:02,670
That's the problem.

910
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:03,970
There's so many Kens.

911
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:05,550
Yeah.

912
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:09,650
Ken is like the new player god character.

913
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:11,550
Yeah.

914
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,270
See, you're doing lariat preemptively.

915
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:13,850
Yeah.

916
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:14,570
Ooh.

917
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:15,090
Wow.

918
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:21,610
Yeah.

919
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:22,570
And you did driver reversal again.

920
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:24,810
And you didn't mean to do it, but that was a good driver reversal.

921
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:27,370
So we'll practice that to harness that power.

922
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:40,960
Nice.

923
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:41,440
Okay.

924
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:42,800
He knows how to counter DI.

925
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,860
So it seems like on a wake up you like to do DI a lot.

926
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,160
Yeah.

927
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,260
Which is good sometimes.

928
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,020
We'll try to swap that out with driver reversal instead.

929
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:53,820
Nice.

930
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,200
This guy's a nut.

931
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:04,760
Nice.

932
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,160
Nice.

933
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:05,260
Nice.

934
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,200
Nice.

935
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,100
Ooh.

936
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,040
That was sick.

937
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:09,560
Yeah.

938
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,420
That's perfect.

939
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:10,940
Yeah.

940
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,340
If you're jumping and they jump at you, triangle, that's perfect.

941
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:15,440
Yeah.

942
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,360
I do that more as a reactionary.

943
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:18,060
Yeah.

944
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:18,360
Yeah.

945
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,680
That's called an air to air.

946
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,740
You have the air to airs down.

947
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,200
Nice.

948
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:29,300
When they're in burnout, that's when you can really go hard with the DI.

949
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,320
So he has no meter.

950
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,720
To counter DI, you have to use your own DI, right?

951
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:35,060
Yeah.

952
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,180
So when you're in burnout, you can't use your own DI.

953
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:36,460
You can't do that.

954
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:42,160
So you should be even more confident just pressing DI when they're... if they go into burnout.

955
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:49,770
Nice.

956
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:56,370
Level three.

957
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,390
Okay.

958
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:59,070
See, level three would have killed right there.

959
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,770
That would have been a really good time to mash your level three.

960
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:08,430
So if you don't have level three, doing what you do right there is the best thing you can do.

961
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:12,810
If it's like the last round and you have level three, you mash the... what is it?

962
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:14,150
Like down triangle circle.

963
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:15,090
Mhm.

964
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:15,950
Yeah.

965
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:18,270
That's like just a bit of optimization, right?

966
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,670
You would have already killed them, but that's... that's... you have the game plan.

967
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:22,490
Okay.

968
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:27,590
So I think we want to practice wake up drive reversal and there's one more thing on defense you can try.

969
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,770
I don't think you ever back roll on wake up.

970
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,210
There's a back roll?

971
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,930
Yeah.

972
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:42,730
If you mash kicks when you get knocked down, you'll roll backwards instead, which will make more space away from the opponent and it can help you wake up block a bit more.

973
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,130
I don't think it makes sense.

974
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,530
I've never seen a back roll.

975
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:46,190
Yeah.

976
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:47,910
It just started to click.

977
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:48,710
I was like, wait a minute.

978
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,870
She's never back rolling.

979
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,390
And that's also why they're getting such good pressure on you.

980
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:53,790
Yeah.

981
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:54,330
Okay.

982
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:58,170
What's a... you available to hop in a lobby and just try that out?

983
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:58,410
Yeah.

984
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:58,810
Let's do it.

985
01:12:58,810 --> 01:12:59,370
How do I do it?

986
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,750
Let me send you an invite.

987
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:01,770
Okay.

988
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:14,370
Okay.

989
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:15,250
I sent you an invite.

990
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:16,530
Oh.

991
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,170
Do you know how to accept it?

992
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,110
I assume it's...

993
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,230
You got to go to the...

994
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:23,290
You got to go to the...

995
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:23,350
You got to go to the...

996
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:23,850
CFN?

997
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:24,690
No.

998
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:25,710
It's a little weird.

999
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:30,650
You got to go in the fighting ground, go to the far right menu, which I think is like custom room.

1000
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:31,690
Yeah.

1001
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,890
And then there's like a custom room option.

1002
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:34,430
Invitation.

1003
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,310
And then view invitations.

1004
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:36,070
Yeah.

1005
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:44,780
Whoa.

1006
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,320
Hey.

1007
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:46,800
Okay.

1008
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:47,340
Okay.

1009
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:47,860
You're in the training.

1010
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:48,640
All right.

1011
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,420
Join you there.

1012
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,520
All right.

1013
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:02,880
Nice.

1014
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:03,580
Okay.

1015
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,240
So, I think the first thing we should try...

1016
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:06,600
Yeah.

1017
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,240
...is just doing your wake up drive reversal.

1018
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,200
So, I'm going to knock you down with this move here.

1019
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,160
Oh.

1020
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,300
And then...

1021
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,980
You almost had it here.

1022
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,540
Let me turn your inputs on so I can see what you're doing.

1023
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,220
Okay.

1024
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:26,140
So, when you wake up, after you get knocked down, just hold forward and your DI button.

1025
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,440
You don't press it.

1026
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,240
Just hold both buttons.

1027
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:29,740
Yeah.

1028
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,020
Yeah.

1029
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:30,080
Yeah.

1030
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,680
So, on wake up, you just hold it.

1031
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,520
So, just hold forward.

1032
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:33,480
Perfect.

1033
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:34,760
So, you see how...

1034
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:34,980
Yeah.

1035
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:36,580
...it just sends it to you.

1036
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:37,260
Yeah.

1037
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,660
It just sends you...

1038
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,400
Yeah.

1039
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,400
So, that beats throws.

1040
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:42,760
That beats strikes.

1041
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,600
That beats whatever.

1042
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:44,520
Right?

1043
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,120
So, you can just hold that.

1044
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:46,600
Yeah.

1045
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,600
Now, the only thing is, technically, it's unsafe.

1046
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,120
So, if they walk up and block, they can punish you.

1047
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,620
But your opponents at this level are not doing that.

1048
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,660
They're just like...

1049
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:55,800
Okay.

1050
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:56,720
...pressing random buttons.

1051
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:57,440
Oh.

1052
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:58,480
Yeah.

1053
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,340
So, you got DI there, which does work sometimes.

1054
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,540
If you want to do DI, just press it without the...

1055
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,240
Just mash it with no pressure.

1056
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:06,600
Yeah.

1057
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:07,360
Yeah.

1058
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:14,520
But I would say most of these times when you're waking up like that, you should be doing... just hold forward and DI.

1059
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,060
It'll work more often.

1060
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:16,580
Okay.

1061
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,000
Yeah.

1062
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,700
The other thing is the back roll.

1063
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,120
So, some things you can't back roll.

1064
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,540
So, Gief, like all his command grabs, you can't back roll.

1065
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:28,320
That's kind of like what makes him... it makes him able to approach after.

1066
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:32,000
Like, you kind of have to just get up again and hold the pressure.

1067
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:32,280
Okay.

1068
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,160
But other attacks...

1069
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,220
What can you back roll?

1070
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,520
Gief might be a bad example.

1071
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:38,580
Lariat.

1072
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,100
Lariat you can back roll.

1073
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:43,660
So, if I knock you down with Lariat, just mash two kick buttons.

1074
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,260
Mash two kick buttons?

1075
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:45,820
Uh-oh.

1076
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:46,840
Or...

1077
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,700
What is it for...

1078
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,020
Which one?

1079
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,500
Actually, what is it for Modern?

1080
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,220
God, Modern...

1081
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:51,340
Here.

1082
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,180
Do Lariat to me.

1083
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:56,280
Okay.

1084
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:57,380
Do it again.

1085
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,540
Oh, that's the first time I've ever seen that.

1086
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:00,460
Okay.

1087
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,700
I think it's your circle.

1088
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:03,660
No?

1089
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:04,040
Okay.

1090
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:04,640
Do it again.

1091
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:06,300
Okay.

1092
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,880
I do X and circle.

1093
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,300
Let me try...

1094
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,180
Do it one more time.

1095
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:12,860
Okay.

1096
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:15,900
Square plus X or X plus circle.

1097
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:20,680
It seems like just any combination of those two attack points with X, it'll...

1098
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,120
There you go.

1099
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:21,540
Oh, my God.

1100
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:24,660
Oh, my God.

1101
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,600
That's the first time.

1102
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:25,840
Perfect.

1103
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,040
And you see how much more space that builds?

1104
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:27,740
Yeah.

1105
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:28,520
Yeah.

1106
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:32,160
So, most of the time, when you get knocked down, you're gonna be wanting to mash that.

1107
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:32,920
All right.

1108
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,160
And then, on top of that, you can combine both.

1109
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:41,620
So, you can mash X plus circle and then start holding after you get the back roll, then start holding forward plus DI.

1110
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,220
Okay.

1111
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,640
And that way, you get the back roll plus wake up drive reversal, right?

1112
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:46,820
Yeah.

1113
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,060
There you go.

1114
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,600
You're combining the defensive options.

1115
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:55,020
That's, like, your ultimate way, like, build some space and then get them off you.

1116
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,220
Mm-hmm.

1117
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:58,940
And then look at that.

1118
01:16:59,080 --> 01:16:59,680
Oh, I see.

1119
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:04,300
You can walk up and press heavy or walk up and press X or, you know, drive rush in.

1120
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,000
Uh, chat's asking, when do we not back roll?

1121
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,460
Yeah, sometimes, I think at your level, you should always back roll.

1122
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:18,560
Sometimes, you don't want to back roll because it's better to quick rise to let them not push you to the corner as much.

1123
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,460
But I think for you, I think back roll every time is a good standard for now.

1124
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:27,260
Usually, it's, like, you back roll 90% of the time, then there's the exception when you don't back roll.

1125
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:33,660
So, yeah, any knockdown, back roll, and then you can try, uh...

1126
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,080
that.

1127
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:38,260
Nice.

1128
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,880
So, that knockdown, you can't back roll just fine.

1129
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,220
Oh, yeah, I can.

1130
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,060
Yeah.

1131
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:49,460
The other thing, um, you don't use this move that much.

1132
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,980
Down, forward, heavy.

1133
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,520
This move is super good.

1134
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:53,300
Yeah.

1135
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,580
I usually, yeah, I default to this move instead.

1136
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,640
Yeah, this move has more range, actually.

1137
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,560
So, from further away, you can do that.

1138
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,640
But if you're close to them, I mean, you can just...

1139
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,220
do this.

1140
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,460
Because if people are mashing, like, they're just gonna get knocked down over and over.

1141
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,040
This is your, like, hey, please stop mashing and block move.

1142
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,040
Okay.

1143
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,320
See, I wasn't good enough, but...

1144
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,120
I see.

1145
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,600
Theoretically, you shouldn't be able to do that.

1146
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:20,780
Okay.

1147
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:21,860
Okay.

1148
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:23,800
Yeah.

1149
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,860
So, until they show you something else, you can also just throw this out a bunch.

1150
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,000
It's really good.

1151
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,320
All right.

1152
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,280
Yeah.

1153
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,260
So, if you try it...

1154
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,360
Yeah.

1155
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,040
Yeah.

1156
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,200
And if I try to, like...

1157
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:38,540
Yeah.

1158
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,640
And the other thing is, if they get hit by this, they can't back roll.

1159
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,160
So, you can use that...

1160
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,500
Oh, I see.

1161
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,560
...to approach as well.

1162
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,440
Like, it says hard knockdown there on the screen.

1163
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,860
I have to get this one way, so you can gain ground.

1164
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,600
So, you know, if you're confident, that's when your drive rush SPD comes in.

1165
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:00,780
Okay.

1166
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,100
Like, you can drive rush in, then SPD.

1167
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,000
Yeah, you gotta learn the timing a little bit.

1168
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,940
You have to delay it.

1169
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:09,640
Yeah.

1170
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:10,640
But that's the idea.

1171
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,780
So, in the corner, you don't have to drive rush, but, like, mid-screen, that's what lets you...

1172
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,680
Perfect, right?

1173
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:18,740
So, if you land that mid-screen, because they're far away...

1174
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,320
Yeah.

1175
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,740
...and then you're, like, struggling to get in, you're in.

1176
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,000
Yeah.

1177
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:23,420
Perfect.

1178
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:24,480
Okay.

1179
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,760
So, that's why it's such a good move, because the reward is so good, right?

1180
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,120
If you land that, suddenly you're in their grill and they're terrified.

1181
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:35,040
Or, like, you know, the other moves.

1182
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,560
Oh, no!

1183
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:39,360
Nice.

1184
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,100
There you go.

1185
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,380
And then, you know...

1186
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:41,780
Yay!

1187
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:47,780
The other thing is, you didn't use any drive rush SPD after landing your command grab online.

1188
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:48,760
Did you...

1189
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,580
Are you dissuaded from doing that?

1190
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,700
Because when you play the CPU...

1191
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,300
Wait, drive rush SPD?

1192
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,260
Like this?

1193
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:54,480
Yeah.

1194
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:54,880
And then...

1195
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,820
And then drive rush again.

1196
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,560
Oh, no.

1197
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:01,340
I did it earlier in the other match... in pre... earlier matches.

1198
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,220
And then I kept getting... they kept jumping, so then I just stopped doing it.

1199
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:05,840
Okay.

1200
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:06,480
Yeah.

1201
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:06,860
Yeah.

1202
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,120
I mean...

1203
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,940
It's smart that they jumped it.

1204
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:14,040
The idea there is that you're then supposed to mix up different options out of the drive rush.

1205
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,280
So...

1206
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:15,580
Yeah.

1207
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:23,080
I don't want to overload you with options, but the basic thing that's super scary is your forward and medium out of drive rush.

1208
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:29,160
So, this thing gets you in, and then they have to guess right away, even if they block it.

1209
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:29,940
So, you can do that.

1210
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,320
Okay.

1211
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,020
Drive rush forward and then medium.

1212
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:33,960
Or, sorry.

1213
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:34,860
I keep saying the wrong buttons.

1214
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:35,380
Forward X.

1215
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:42,300
And then when I block that, or if I get hit, then you can do triangle right after.

1216
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:43,800
Oh.

1217
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,380
Well, no.

1218
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:46,960
And then do triangle.

1219
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:47,560
Yep.

1220
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:48,240
Oh, okay.

1221
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,700
This move is super good because it covers a lot of ground.

1222
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,760
And then...

1223
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:53,060
And then you can block it.

1224
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:53,720
And then you can press right after.

1225
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,780
And then if you don't want to do the triangle...

1226
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:57,900
Yeah.

1227
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:58,420
This is amazing.

1228
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,120
Yeah.

1229
01:20:59,180 --> 01:20:59,460
So...

1230
01:20:59,460 --> 01:20:59,720
Okay.

1231
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:05,240
So, like, try landing the triangle and then drive rush forward X and then triangle again.

1232
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,120
And try looping that.

1233
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,120
Okay.

1234
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,740
Just to get a feel for it.

1235
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:13,540
Okay.

1236
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:17,840
Okay.

1237
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,100
So, I see something wrong with the way you're inputting it.

1238
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:20,740
What...

1239
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,560
You need to...

1240
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,480
You're not getting the drive rush version of the knee.

1241
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,500
You're doing drive rush stop knee.

1242
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:29,820
Oh, okay.

1243
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:34,840
So, the thing about drive rush is you're supposed to let it rip without pressing any buttons.

1244
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,000
So, even if you're holding forward, it cancels the drive rush.

1245
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,820
So, I'm holding forward here and it canceled the drive rush early.

1246
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,780
If I let it go without pressing any directions, then he goes for further.

1247
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:47,620
So, you don't want to hold forward and then do knee.

1248
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,480
You want to drive rush and then tap forward X.

1249
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,240
When you're ready to do it.

1250
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:53,740
That's the only thing.

1251
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:54,800
Okay.

1252
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:56,600
Okay.

1253
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:57,640
Okay.

1254
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,240
Ah, oops.

1255
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:00,820
What the?

1256
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:01,700
Why can't it...

1257
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:05,120
You're pressing the X a little bit too early compared to your forward.

1258
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:05,480
Oh.

1259
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,640
So, you're getting, like, stand X.

1260
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:07,720
Oh.

1261
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,120
Okay.

1262
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:11,340
There you go.

1263
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:11,640
You got it.

1264
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:11,880
Oh, there you go.

1265
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,300
All right.

1266
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:12,480
Yeah.

1267
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,780
You should be glowing green during the knee itself.

1268
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:15,980
There you go.

1269
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:16,660
Yeah.

1270
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:17,620
So, now do it here.

1271
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:18,820
All right.

1272
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,240
Oh no!

1273
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,980
Yeah, it takes a while to synchronize.

1274
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,340
There you go.

1275
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,820
And then try to do it again.

1276
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:33,480
Okay.

1277
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,000
Now try to immediately do it here.

1278
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,740
Like after you land the command grab.

1279
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:37,360
Okay.

1280
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,240
Try to just immediately go in and do it.

1281
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:41,380
No!

1282
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:42,820
I pressed circle.

1283
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:48,800
Okay.

1284
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:57,960
You can do the knee a little earlier, so that's what we're trying to figure out, is like the timing of... the earliest time you can do the knee, because that'll stop me from pressing buttons on wake up.

1285
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,100
So yeah, that knee was a little late.

1286
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,120
Let's try to do a little sooner.

1287
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,460
A little sooner.

1288
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:09,500
No!

1289
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,120
I can't do it anymore!

1290
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,720
Yeah, you're doing it.

1291
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,320
You're doing it.

1292
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,980
Let's try to do it much sooner.

1293
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,780
Oh my god, please.

1294
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,100
Oh god.

1295
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,240
Please, please.

1296
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:26,860
There you go.

1297
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:26,860
Okay.

1298
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:29,000
Now try to do a really early knee on this one.

1299
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,220
That was pretty good.

1300
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,040
You can do it even earlier.

1301
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,840
Like as soon as the dry brush comes out almost.

1302
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,460
You can just hold the forward medium during the dry brush.

1303
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:52,480
Well, if you do that, then the dry brush gets cancelled early, but maybe that'll be easier.

1304
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,160
Here, let me try something.

1305
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,920
I'm gonna try doing it to you, just to make sure we do the easiest version of this.

1306
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,060
Let's see.

1307
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:01,500
Oh, no.

1308
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:01,500
Oh no.

1309
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:01,780
Oh my god, I hope for.

1310
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,640
Cause that'll cancel the dry brush early, but maybe you'll get enough time.

1311
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:10,420
Okay.

1312
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,380
I guess you can theoretically just hold forward for this one.

1313
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:15,580
If that makes it easier.

1314
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,000
Yeah, okay.

1315
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:23,420
Let's just hold forward because it does cancel the dry brush early, but you should do the knee so early that it'll still come out enhanced.

1316
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:25,880
Oh, fuck off.

1317
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,280
Alright.

1318
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,180
Okay, I'm out of my groove.

1319
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:31,620
There you go.

1320
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,580
Now do the knee even earlier.

1321
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,900
Yeah, let's hold four the whole time and do the knee even earlier.

1322
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:41,980
Oh, come on.

1323
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,040
Just, just early, just early.

1324
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:45,860
Even earlier.

1325
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,200
As early as possible.

1326
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,120
My fingers!

1327
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,460
Okay, give me a sec.

1328
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:54,460
All right.

1329
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:00,740
There you go.

1330
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,120
Pretty good.

1331
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,640
But do the knee even earlier.

1332
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,300
As soon as you start dashing.

1333
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:05,040
There you go.

1334
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,920
Okay, finally you did it slightly too early.

1335
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:08,660
That's good.

1336
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:09,560
That's good.

1337
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:10,920
You changed your timing.

1338
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,780
Now we have to do it slightly later.

1339
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:13,640
Perfect.

1340
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:14,280
Perfect.

1341
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:15,640
There it is.

1342
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,180
You got it.

1343
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:16,660
You're getting it.

1344
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:18,520
There it is.

1345
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,220
There it is.

1346
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,260
How did I not grab you?

1347
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:24,400
You did it so good that you are too plus to grab me.

1348
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:26,680
There you go.

1349
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,040
Yes, this is it.

1350
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:28,640
This is it.

1351
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:33,040
I'm telling you, you could, you could spin to win like this.

1352
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:33,860
Like this is...

1353
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:39,920
Yeah, maybe just slightly delay the triangle after the knee, but you got it.

1354
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:41,020
Yes.

1355
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,200
Okay.

1356
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,500
You're becoming too powerful now that you have to slow down your offense.

1357
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,380
Yes.

1358
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:50,680
All right.

1359
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,000
Okay.

1360
01:25:58,740 --> 01:25:59,980
See, that can happen too.

1361
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:00,560
That's the idea.

1362
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:03,760
I'm going to try mashing on wake up a little bit now after this.

1363
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,940
So the knee should beat my buttons.

1364
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,640
Oh, whoops.

1365
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,160
There you go.

1366
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:22,760
Now the problem is... Not mash triangle.

1367
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:27,320
If you hit me, you need to, you need to press a different attack.

1368
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:33,160
This is where it starts to get complicated because, uh, you can't grab me if the knee actually hits.

1369
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:34,680
Oh okay.

1370
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:42,700
So if that happens, you could... I don't know how complex you want to make this.

1371
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:43,400
You want to keep it simple.

1372
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,760
Um, you can just press square.

1373
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:47,220
Okay.

1374
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,660
Like just mash square, like we talked about before.

1375
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,400
But if I block it, you should command grab.

1376
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:53,340
Okay.

1377
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,900
So now you got to, this is called hit confirming.

1378
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,680
You're kind of recognizing if it hit or not.

1379
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,140
Maybe crouch square.

1380
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,580
Oh my god.

1381
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:19,990
I mean, that's honestly not a bad option.

1382
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,870
Oh my god, I keep fucking grabbing.

1383
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:31,550
It's out of instinct.

1384
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:36,790
Yeah, the knee... I think you're doing the knee too late now.

1385
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:38,930
Yeah, you're just doing the knee too late.

1386
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:39,130
No!

1387
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:42,150
It's always faster than you realize.

1388
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,090
There you go.

1389
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:43,730
There you go.

1390
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:44,990
Yeah, that was a good knee.

1391
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:48,330
Oh, whoops.

1392
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:54,390
Perfect.

1393
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:57,350
God damn it, I keep doing that too early.

1394
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:01,050
Yeah.

1395
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:02,870
Yeah, if it hits, you really have to delay.

1396
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:08,790
I mean, the idea being, if you could have gone for a combo, the game doesn't let you grab.

1397
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:13,550
You have to wait for me to recover from the hit, and then grab me after.

1398
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:20,170
So that's why, at higher levels, the geese will then see if the knee hits, and then they'll do a combo on hit.

1399
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:28,030
And if they block it, then they can do either buttons to bait people from jumping away from the grab, or do the grab if they think they're gonna block.

1400
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:28,270
Okay.

1401
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:31,330
So basically, we just want to...

1402
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:34,730
The goal is you don't want this to not connect, right?

1403
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,230
That's all we're trying to avoid.

1404
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:38,710
That's because that's the worst case scenario.

1405
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:43,330
So if you do this, you can just do this.

1406
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:45,030
The crouching square.

1407
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:50,150
And then when that finishes, you're gonna be at the range to press circle.

1408
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:51,570
Okay.

1409
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:54,290
So we can try a little bit of this.

1410
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:57,550
Just the dry brush knee, and then just mash crouch square.

1411
01:28:58,970 --> 01:28:59,410
Okay.

1412
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:00,570
It's gonna be a basic...

1413
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:03,190
And then here, you can start doing circle.

1414
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:05,730
And then do it... you can even do it again after, right?

1415
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:10,830
Circle, dry brush knee, and then, you know, mix it up from there.

1416
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,770
Okay.

1417
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:15,250
But let's try dry brush knee, and then mash crouch square.

1418
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:16,130
Okay.

1419
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:18,090
Oh my god, wait.

1420
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:19,970
I don't...

1421
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,330
You're doing crouching square now.

1422
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:22,530
Yeah.

1423
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:26,090
Oh, you're blending them together, I see.

1424
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:29,730
You're doing crouching axe instead of crouching square, yeah.

1425
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:31,590
No, okay.

1426
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:34,570
God damn it.

1427
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,390
Yeah, you're crossing the wires right now.

1428
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:37,910
I'm gonna use this now.

1429
01:29:38,350 --> 01:29:39,890
Yeah, my wires are crossed.

1430
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:42,070
There you go.

1431
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:42,770
Okay.

1432
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:47,060
Nice.

1433
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,560
See, I try to mash after, and you see how you're counter hitting me?

1434
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,280
That's why this is so good.

1435
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:55,840
Yeah.

1436
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,840
Like, people can't mash here.

1437
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:00,720
If you time it all correctly, it's really powerful because of that.

1438
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:01,320
Yeah.

1439
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,140
Oops.

1440
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,240
Nice.

1441
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:11,600
And then after three squares, the last one's gonna not connect.

1442
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:13,260
So that's when you're...

1443
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,560
Yeah, so now you're at that range.

1444
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,320
Try like a circle or something.

1445
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

1446
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:18,340
Okay.

1447
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,260
Nice.

1448
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,720
That was a really clean sequence.

1449
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:24,700
Really clean.

1450
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:30,030
Yay.

1451
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:30,890
Yeah.

1452
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:32,030
That's a great sequence.

1453
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:34,690
Oops.

1454
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:35,050
Oops.

1455
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:50,700
So the idea being anytime you're kinda like out of range of people and things are going your way, and they're far away, you can just try that.

1456
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:56,060
Just dry-rush knee into square or dry-rush knee into circle.

1457
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,160
Okay.

1458
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,780
That's something to do from far away because I think at those distances, I see you doing a lot of like just this.

1459
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:02,600
Yeah.

1460
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,220
Let's just remove this from the strategy.

1461
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:05,540
Okay.

1462
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,060
This move is just not good enough.

1463
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:11,740
So if you're that close, it's gonna be circle, a lot of circle.

1464
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,760
I think you can just do this way more than you realize.

1465
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:15,580
It's really good.

1466
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:21,280
And then if they're far away like that, like after this connects, dry rush knee.

1467
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:22,480
Okay.

1468
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And then you can even try to, you know, do instead of square, do the triangle here and there.

1469
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:34,060
Like this pins people down so hard.

1470
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:37,640
Whoa.

1471
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,840
Okay, I don't know.

1472
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,120
I don't know how to use this character.

1473
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,480
That's the idea.

1474
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,340
Let's see.

1475
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,100
So same idea if you land this move.

1476
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:59,380
So if you land the, yeah, dry brush knee after that as well.

1477
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:11,630
Nice.

1478
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:12,070
Yep.

1479
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:13,330
Very, very good.

1480
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:14,030
Yay!

1481
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:15,290
Very good.

1482
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:16,150
Yay!

1483
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:18,030
Yeah.

1484
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:22,370
And also instead of lariat, just any of your heavies besides the down heavy.

1485
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:26,930
So instead of this out here, I'd rather you just mash this, the down forward heavy.

1486
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:27,450
Okay.

1487
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:29,370
Or sorry, circle.

1488
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:29,950
Let me use circle.

1489
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:31,090
Yay!

1490
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:32,730
My boomer brain keeps taking over.

1491
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:36,470
Down forward circle or stance circle.

1492
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:37,070
Yeah.

1493
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:37,710
Yeah.

1494
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:38,110
All right.

1495
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:38,410
Yeah.

1496
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,710
Because this move is just, I don't think it's worth it.

1497
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:43,770
And then if these ever land.

1498
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:49,350
And then you just keep doing that.

1499
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:56,550
That is a counter.

1500
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:57,070
Yeah.

1501
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,950
I guess you got to be always careful about that out of nowhere.

1502
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:03,550
And then the other thing you can do is wake up drive reversal, right?

1503
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:05,230
Like the hold forward and DI.

1504
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:06,650
Yeah.

1505
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:06,970
Cool.

1506
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:08,950
I'm on this side now.

1507
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:21,510
Do you remember the wake up drive reversal input?

1508
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:22,750
Yeah.

1509
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:23,010
Yeah.

1510
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:24,030
Yeah.

1511
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:30,560
No.

1512
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:31,740
Not quite.

1513
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:32,620
I mean, it worked there.

1514
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:32,820
Not that.

1515
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:35,800
There you go.

1516
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:36,340
Yeah.

1517
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,320
All right.

1518
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:39,180
Nice.

1519
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:39,560
Nice.

1520
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,500
Now we're playing back to neutral.

1521
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,100
So we've got these ranges.

1522
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,360
See.

1523
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,440
It's just so good to get through.

1524
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:55,520
Yeah.

1525
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:55,920
Yeah.

1526
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:10,390
I was trying to do that thing you taught me yesterday, like the... that.

1527
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:11,130
Yeah.

1528
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:13,050
Like it doesn't work in my elo.

1529
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:14,230
I don't...

1530
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:17,030
Did you ever get enraged to do it though?

1531
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,830
Yeah.

1532
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:19,850
It wasn't working?

1533
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:21,310
It wasn't working.

1534
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:24,410
I kept my shit beat up and then they put me in the corner.

1535
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:29,310
It might be a little too hard to execute cleanly.

1536
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:30,370
Yeah.

1537
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:30,690
Yeah.

1538
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:33,830
There might be... you kind of have to mix up the variables a little bit maybe.

1539
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:38,610
And I think also you're just having trouble getting clean pressure from that range.

1540
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:43,750
Like it's so... this range is so chaotic that it might not happen too often.

1541
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:45,370
So if it's not working, let's abandon that.

1542
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:46,210
Yeah.

1543
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:50,110
You'd have to get into this range and control a little bit too much.

1544
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:53,690
So then let's just focus on... you can definitely use that jump.

1545
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:55,310
That close.

1546
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,270
The down heavy.

1547
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:59,970
But just make sure also at this distance, anytime you jump...

1548
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:00,150
Yeah.

1549
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:00,770
That's that.

1550
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:05,210
And then when you land, you can either do crouching squares or triangle.

1551
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:06,270
Okay.

1552
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:07,770
And that's gonna be your idea basically.

1553
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:08,430
Like just...

1554
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:10,890
And you can even do it again.

1555
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:11,290
Yeah.

1556
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:11,370
Right?

1557
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:11,950
Like...

1558
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:13,410
Okay.

1559
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:15,850
I understand.

1560
01:35:16,570 --> 01:35:17,750
And then you can do it again.

1561
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:20,610
Oh.

1562
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:23,410
Oh, please.

1563
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:24,230
Yeah.

1564
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:25,110
See how good this could be?

1565
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:27,130
Is that Percy?

1566
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:29,030
Yeah.

1567
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:30,330
Is this how your matches go?

1568
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:33,270
I'm getting PTSD.

1569
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:34,330
Yeah.

1570
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:36,210
But you see the vision, right?

1571
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:36,790
Like I'm trying to...

1572
01:35:36,790 --> 01:35:38,490
Well, I want you to exploit this too.

1573
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,950
Yeah.

1574
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:44,110
Because you do the jabs, the crouching squares, and that pushes you out.

1575
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:47,530
But that also pushes you to the perfect range to then hold up forward and press square.

1576
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:49,130
Okay.

1577
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:51,530
And then jump forward square.

1578
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:53,370
Or...

1579
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:53,670
Sorry.

1580
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:54,410
Oh, sorry.

1581
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:56,630
Match square and then jump forward X.

1582
01:35:56,670 --> 01:35:58,670
These controls are like hieroglyphics to me.

1583
01:35:58,710 --> 01:35:58,990
I'm sorry.

1584
01:35:59,230 --> 01:35:59,630
Okay.

1585
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,330
Okay.

1586
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,250
Nice.

1587
01:36:05,850 --> 01:36:06,610
And then...

1588
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:06,910
Yeah.

1589
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:10,230
So you only get three of those crouching squares at max.

1590
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,790
So you can always do one, two, three, jump forward X.

1591
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:14,790
One, two, three, jump forward X.

1592
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:17,730
Two, three, then jump forward X.

1593
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:18,290
Or that.

1594
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:19,250
You know, mix it up.

1595
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:20,050
But that's...

1596
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:25,610
Yeah.

1597
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:26,570
Then jump forward X.

1598
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:32,530
Oh.

1599
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:33,170
Oh.

1600
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:34,990
Oh, no.

1601
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:36,690
Oh, no.

1602
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:38,430
Oops.

1603
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:44,870
Yeah, jump X, square, square, square, jump forward, X, jump... yeah, there you go.

1604
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:48,170
Yep.

1605
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,250
I mean, really, you can just spam this.

1606
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:59,010
And then eventually, if they're blocking after a jump in, you can do that.

1607
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:00,050
Okay.

1608
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:02,570
Oh, crap, nice.

1609
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:15,040
So, to stop what I'm doing, that's when you would do Lariat.

1610
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1611
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,500
After I leave the ground.

1612
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:23,660
So theoretically, you could sit around doing nothing, and if they jump, you press down triangle.

1613
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:30,320
But that's a little... it's not that hard, but then you're kind of waiting for them to jump.

1614
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,980
Sometimes it's better to just let people jump at you over and over and do very little.

1615
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:35,000
Yeah.

1616
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,080
Because then you can just do this every time they jump.

1617
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:44,120
So I don't know if that's... that might be too much for you to handle at the moment.

1618
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,020
It might be better to just try to take the fight to them first.

1619
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,000
But that's the idea, when you would use that move.

1620
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:59,800
Like, if they're doing this on you over and over, you'd wait for the jump part, and then you do down triangle.

1621
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:01,480
Perfect.

1622
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:03,780
Perfect.

1623
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:12,020
Yeah, and then after the Lariat, you can try to, like, walk up and do your own pressure, right?

1624
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,080
Yeah, yeah.

1625
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,840
So now you can try to... yep, yep, yep, exactly.

1626
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:20,040
Get your own turn after.

1627
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:26,480
Yep, now you can try to do something.

1628
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:29,020
Nice.

1629
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:33,820
Yeah, that's a problem.

1630
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,240
You gotta do it early enough.

1631
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:35,700
Yeah, that's a problem.

1632
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:35,700
You gotta do it early enough.

1633
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:38,000
Oh.

1634
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:46,250
Okay, you know.

1635
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:47,830
Yay!

1636
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:49,910
Oh, nice.

1637
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:55,800
Nice.

1638
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,120
Nice.

1639
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:14,310
Oh.

1640
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,820
Oh.

1641
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,760
Nice.

1642
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:26,240
Oh.

1643
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,780
Oh.

1644
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1645
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1646
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1647
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1648
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1649
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1650
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1651
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1652
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Oh.

1653
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:33,670
Oh.

1654
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:36,170
Nice Jabs.

1655
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,170
Definitely try mixing in like your command grab, right?

1656
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:38,970
Yeah.

1657
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:48,630
Like I mean, doing the Jabs is gonna be really good for really mashy opponents, because it's easier to just kind of check them like with that.

1658
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:52,330
So if they're like constantly being hit, keep doing that.

1659
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:57,270
If they ever start to finally block or sit still for a little bit, then you can start mashing the triangle.

1660
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:58,050
Okay.

1661
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:02,290
I understand.

1662
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:12,210
Okay, I think I got it.

1663
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:16,190
What do you do on wake up here?

1664
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:20,510
I knock you down and I try to do it.

1665
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:26,030
There you go.

1666
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,850
There we go.

1667
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:27,470
I did it.

1668
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:32,410
You can try to jump in or walk up and do this or drive rush knee, right?

1669
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:33,550
You have options now.

1670
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:35,610
You're learning multiple techniques.

1671
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:39,450
But now I'm on top of you.

1672
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:40,450
I'm pressuring you.

1673
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:42,250
So how do you get out of it?

1674
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,550
Oh god, please.

1675
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:52,730
Nice.

1676
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:53,390
Okay.

1677
01:40:58,110 --> 01:40:59,050
Oh, very nice.

1678
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:00,110
That was actually really good.

1679
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:01,190
Yeah.

1680
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,850
Oh, you got me.

1681
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:09,950
Yay.

1682
01:41:09,950 --> 01:41:10,310
Nice.

1683
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:12,570
Whoa.

1684
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:15,850
So how do you get me off you?

1685
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:20,570
That works sometimes.

1686
01:41:20,730 --> 01:41:21,410
I mean, that works too.

1687
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:23,870
But sometimes it won't work.

1688
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:24,470
Yeah.

1689
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:27,330
The only thing is, it's okay to do any move.

1690
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:30,910
The goal is to just do the moves that you intended to do, right?

1691
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:31,330
Yeah.

1692
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:32,070
Yeah.

1693
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:34,250
So if you want to do wake up DI, let's do wake up DI.

1694
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:37,790
But if you intend to do wake up drive reversal, let's try to get wake up drive reversal.

1695
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:38,270
That's all.

1696
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:38,610
Okay.

1697
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:44,550
And so, so the secret again is you don't have to press the button more than once on wake up drive reversal.

1698
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:47,150
You just hold forward and DI the whole time.

1699
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:51,230
So if I knock you down like that, you just hold the buttons together without mashing.

1700
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:51,490
Okay.

1701
01:41:53,970 --> 01:41:54,330
Perfect.

1702
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:55,210
There you go.

1703
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:58,270
If you want to do this though, the random DI, then mash it.

1704
01:41:58,290 --> 01:41:59,070
Then just start mashing.

1705
01:41:59,570 --> 01:41:59,930
Yeah.

1706
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:00,850
Yeah.

1707
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:01,870
Perfect.

1708
01:42:05,810 --> 01:42:07,050
That's hella damage.

1709
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:09,490
I'm jumping over and over.

1710
01:42:12,230 --> 01:42:12,990
There you go.

1711
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:22,970
Whoa.

1712
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:24,330
Then I'm rushing you down.

1713
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:27,070
And what do you do?

1714
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:32,590
Okay.

1715
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:33,590
Sometimes do that.

1716
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:37,490
I would say let's try to default to wake up drive reversal though.

1717
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:39,130
Okay.

1718
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:39,570
Yeah.

1719
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:39,890
Perfect.

1720
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:40,270
Perfect.

1721
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:48,000
Nice.

1722
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:48,940
Now you can get in.

1723
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:49,340
Yep.

1724
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:49,960
There you go.

1725
01:42:58,790 --> 01:42:59,190
Okay.

1726
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:00,230
I'm blocking a bunch.

1727
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:01,170
So you know what time that means?

1728
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:01,710
Yep.

1729
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:02,130
Exactly.

1730
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:03,990
It's throw time.

1731
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:05,210
Yes.

1732
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:08,670
Now some opponents will never, ever, ever be conditioned.

1733
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:10,630
So if something's working, keep doing it.

1734
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,610
On the off chance they start blocking.

1735
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:13,430
That's the idea.

1736
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:13,790
That's me.

1737
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:14,610
Yeah.

1738
01:43:14,690 --> 01:43:16,890
I think our tournament players, they'll be coached.

1739
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:18,470
So they might actually block eventually.

1740
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:18,950
Yeah.

1741
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:22,550
Against you, I would never command grab because you're not blocking.

1742
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:24,970
Yeah.

1743
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:28,510
So if you're fighting yourself, you got to understand the mind game, right?

1744
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,130
Like, oh, this dude's a mashing scrub.

1745
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:32,390
I'm going to keep doing the buttons, right?

1746
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,350
That's kind of the idea.

1747
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:35,850
Oh, they're trying to play smart and block.

1748
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:37,570
I got something for that too.

1749
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:38,670
All right.

1750
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:40,290
And that's Zangief.

1751
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:41,030
That's it.

1752
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:46,850
And then the one last other thing to refresh, back roll.

1753
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:50,710
So if you get, Zangief doesn't have many moves, you can back roll, but that one.

1754
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:51,070
Yep.

1755
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:57,310
Every time you get put to the ground, just, um, just mash like, uh, whichever one you prefer.

1756
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:58,870
I'm doing X in circle.

1757
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:00,650
Okay.

1758
01:44:01,130 --> 01:44:04,190
So whichever two, or you can do a square and X.

1759
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:06,090
Okay.

1760
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:09,490
So, so you didn't get it there, but if you mash.

1761
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:13,910
Knock me down.

1762
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:14,650
I'm trying.

1763
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:14,990
I'm trying.

1764
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:15,510
There you go.

1765
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:15,850
Okay.

1766
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:19,090
There you go.

1767
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:19,230
Yay.

1768
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:23,390
And then the last thing you do is combine that with wake up drive reversal.

1769
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:26,470
So we'll back roll and then I'm going to drive rush at you.

1770
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:33,330
And you want to, after you do the knockdown, the quick rise, sorry.

1771
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:35,510
After you do the back roll, you want to hold forward and DI.

1772
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:35,910
Yeah.

1773
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:38,490
Oh.

1774
01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:41,910
You mashed it again.

1775
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:42,830
You got to just hold it.

1776
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:43,050
Okay.

1777
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:45,430
Perfect.

1778
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:45,890
All right.

1779
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:46,510
That.

1780
01:44:46,610 --> 01:44:47,010
Yay!

1781
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:50,250
Your defense is so much more leveled up if you combine those two.

1782
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:51,530
Oops.

1783
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:52,430
Yeah.

1784
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:54,290
Just remember to try to not mash.

1785
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:56,570
Mash the first part, then the second part just hold.

1786
01:44:57,790 --> 01:44:58,230
Okay.

1787
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:02,330
There you go.

1788
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:04,890
You're going to have so much better defense after that.

1789
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:09,530
Oh, but it worked.

1790
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:11,850
It will work sometimes.

1791
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:13,190
Yeah.

1792
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:16,510
If you're feeling a DI, I want you to DI.

1793
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:17,450
For sure.

1794
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:17,990
Yeah.

1795
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:21,910
But I think you're still mashing the input from what I see on the input side.

1796
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:25,830
When you're doing drive reversal, you literally don't have to, yeah, don't match it.

1797
01:45:25,990 --> 01:45:26,390
Oh.

1798
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:35,610
You see on my input on the counter, the ticker on the right side that shows all your inputs, when I'm doing break of drive reversal, you see how the number's going up?

1799
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:36,270
Yeah.

1800
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:38,570
I'm literally just holding the two buttons together.

1801
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:39,050
Oh, okay.

1802
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:40,990
Don't lift your fingers at all.

1803
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:45,270
Just hold the two buttons together when you wake up, and that's how you'll get that every single time.

1804
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:46,730
Okay.

1805
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:46,990
See?

1806
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:48,550
So I still think you're tapping.

1807
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:49,610
You're tapping forward.

1808
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:51,290
Hold forward and DI.

1809
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,770
Don't...

1810
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:54,310
The number should be going up on your input.

1811
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:55,950
You should just be holding it.

1812
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:56,330
There you go.

1813
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:56,650
Perfect.

1814
01:45:56,730 --> 01:45:56,930
Woah!

1815
01:45:57,970 --> 01:45:58,930
So just hold it.

1816
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:00,330
There you go.

1817
01:46:00,370 --> 01:46:01,830
You'll get it every single time if you just hold it.

1818
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:04,330
Oh my god, this is the first time I see it above 50.

1819
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:05,790
Yeah.

1820
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,170
Oh, sorry.

1821
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:08,730
I did a wrong move.

1822
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:11,090
That's the wake-up input.

1823
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:14,310
Perfect.

1824
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:17,390
Yeah, you both back-rolled and you held...

1825
01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:17,810
There you go.

1826
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:20,210
That's how you'll never accidentally get DI.

1827
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:22,430
Okay.

1828
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:22,810
Perfect.

1829
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:24,930
Now, if you want DI, that's when you start mashing.

1830
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:27,230
If you don't want it and you want drive reversal, just hold it.

1831
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:28,390
Okay.

1832
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:39,860
There you go.

1833
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,660
Very nice.

1834
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:41,020
Yay!

1835
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:44,560
Yeah, that'll slow down so much of the mauling you're going through.

1836
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:45,000
Yeah.

1837
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:46,000
Oh, thank god.

1838
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:46,320
Okay.

1839
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,500
Alright, my defense has finally leveled up.

1840
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:50,740
Yes, yes.

1841
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:51,900
And after that...

1842
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,580
You have to figure out how to get back in with things like your jump.

1843
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:58,400
You know, jump X, the jabs, some of these...

1844
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:01,480
Yeah.

1845
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:05,880
Yep, see?

1846
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:06,500
And then...

1847
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:11,700
If you land that and you can remember to drive rush in knee, like, that's godlike.

1848
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:14,320
Okay.

1849
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:16,420
Oh, shit.

1850
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,220
I can't do it on this side.

1851
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,620
Get on the other side.

1852
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,120
You're not going to be able to control what side you're on in a mash.

1853
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,620
So you prefer player one side?

1854
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:30,560
Yeah.

1855
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:32,080
Okay.

1856
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:36,580
I would advise practicing player two side, but I can try to...

1857
01:47:36,580 --> 01:47:37,120
No!

1858
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:39,580
We can try to jockey for player one side or something.

1859
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:40,480
We'll see.

1860
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:45,320
I'll rig the coin flip when we pick the sides or something.

1861
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:45,740
I don't know.

1862
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:46,700
Oh, thank god.

1863
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:47,200
Okay.

1864
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,180
Okay, cool.

1865
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:52,100
Don't worry, I'll tell them I know both sides.

1866
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:52,980
Right.

1867
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:57,600
And I'll be like, guys, I want the player two side, guys, please.

1868
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:01,120
Please, can I please have player two side, guys?

1869
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:06,080
And they'll be like, alright, we'll put her on player one because clearly she's bad at player one side.

1870
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:06,840
Exactly.

1871
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:08,840
Sounds like a plan.

1872
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,340
Okay, I kind of want to watch you play a few ranked games.

1873
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:13,000
Is that possible?

1874
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:14,880
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1875
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:15,960
I can screen share.

1876
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,300
But I've turned the quality down, so...

1877
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:21,220
The frame rate last time was crazy.

1878
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:21,740
That was...

1879
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:21,980
Yeah.

1880
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,020
That was nuts.

1881
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:24,700
Yeah.

1882
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:30,840
If you can do that, then I can coach you through a couple of ranked matches just to remind you of, like, the techniques.

1883
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:32,560
And then that way you can do it in a real match.

1884
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:32,820
Oh, yeah.

1885
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:34,140
And I think it'll sink in that way.

1886
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:35,400
All right.

1887
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:36,960
I'm going to use the bathroom real quick then.

1888
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:37,600
All right.

1889
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:38,040
Sounds good.

1890
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:45,420
Okay.

1891
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,000
I'm muted on the call.

1892
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:47,480
What's up, everybody?

1893
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,000

There's a lot of subs.

1929
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,040
Holy shit, what is going on?

1930
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,460
I think I just got 100 subs.

1931
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:54,300
I don't know what's happening.

1932

1934

I got a sandwich here.

1935
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:03,500
Have you tried spamming DP?

1936
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,760
She punishes DPs.

1937
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,060
We can try that, but she does punish DPs.

1938
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:19,690
Yeah, I noticed the new camicolor plus September.

1939
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:22,570
I just think it's crazy that you guys care about the camicolor that much.

1940
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:30,530
My guess is thank you Capcom.

1941
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:37,230
What's the camicolor?

1942
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:38,170
It's a camicolor.

1943
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:38,590
I don't know.

1944
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:39,730
I don't think it's that special.

1945
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:48,290
Does she have a DI combo for wall splat?

1946
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:49,810
I don't know.

1947
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:52,590
I mean, it would normally be like Hellstab Lariat.

1948
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:54,630
I think we'll just do Lariat.

1949
01:50:57,870 --> 01:50:59,710
I'm not sure if she knows that or not.

1950
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:08,010
Shakarni, thanks for the five months.

1951
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:09,630
I am back.

1952
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:11,230
Not comfortable being a sub.

1953
01:51:11,570 --> 01:51:12,930
More into being the Dom.

1954
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:14,210
Trick Troll.

1955
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:14,610
Hey.

1956
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:15,370
Okay.

1957
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:15,970
All right.

1958
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:20,330
I'm just putting it on ranked matches.

1959
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:21,430
Sounds good.

1960
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:26,310
Then I'll put it on 33 frames maybe?

1961
01:51:26,450 --> 01:51:27,510
1080 for 30?

1962
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:29,970
Like, maybe that would be better?

1963
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:33,570
Just not whatever you put it on last time.

1964
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:34,070
Oh, yeah.

1965
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:35,730
At 1440 last time.

1966
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:37,010
That was absurd.

1967
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:37,910
Yeah.

1968
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:39,130
Is it better now?

1969
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:41,230
No.

1970
01:51:41,230 --> 01:51:41,610
No.

1971
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:43,470
Oh, okay.

1972
01:51:43,550 --> 01:51:44,490
Then I don't know.

1973
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:49,550
We got to lower the quality to like 480p or something.

1974
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:50,250
Oh, God.

1975
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:50,590
Yeah.

1976
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:51,030
Yeah.

1977
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:54,570
So after this game, maybe the frame rate is atrocious.

1978
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:55,630
I'm distracted.

1979
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:56,450
Okay.

1980
01:51:56,570 --> 01:51:56,930
Focus.

1981
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:57,170
Focus.

1982
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:57,730
I'll just watch.

1983
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:57,990
Focus.

1984
01:51:58,090 --> 01:51:58,350
Oh, no.

1985
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:01,170
Now I'm thinking about the frame rate.

1986
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:01,950
Don't worry about it.

1987
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:02,630
Don't worry about it.

1988
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:03,230
Okay.

1989
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:03,830
Don't worry about it.

1990
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:05,730
Let's just play the game.

1991
01:52:05,730 --> 01:52:05,790
It's okay.

1992
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:05,930
Okay.

1993
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:07,390
I can't get lower than 5k.

1994
01:52:19,610 --> 01:52:20,410
Oh, bro.

1995
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:21,210
What the fuck?

1996
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:22,010
Okay.

1997
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:22,310
Nice.

1998
01:52:29,390 --> 01:52:29,790
Okay.

1999
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:30,490
Wake up drive reversal.

2000
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:31,190
Let's try that.

2001
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,750
On the next time you get knocked down.

2002
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:35,630
Bro, please stop.

2003
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:36,830
Okay.

2004
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:41,030
You missed it there, but it's okay.

2005
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:43,730
I was off my groove.

2006
01:52:43,870 --> 01:52:44,270
Okay.

2007
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:49,030
I'm not thinking about my disc rate.

2008
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:50,930
We're going to have to...

2009
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:51,170
Let me see.

2010
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:55,450
I'll excuse you now, but when we run into these tough opponents, we're going to have to rematch.

2011
01:52:56,130 --> 01:52:56,530
Okay.

2012
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:57,190
It's 720.

2013
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:00,570
As low as you can go quality wise.

2014
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:03,530
480.

2015
01:53:05,390 --> 01:53:05,790
Okay.

2016
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:07,190
It already looks better.

2017
01:53:07,290 --> 01:53:07,530
Is that better?

2018
01:53:07,570 --> 01:53:08,210
Much better.

2019
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:09,430
Okay.

2020
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:10,030
Okay.

2021
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:11,150
So it has to be 480.

2022
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:12,310
There we go.

2023
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:12,630
I can see.

2024
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:13,170
Okay.

2025
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:14,630
I don't know.

2026
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:21,630
What the fuck?

2027
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:23,670
What the fuck is she doing?

2028
01:53:23,850 --> 01:53:24,170
Yeah.

2029
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:25,390
If she does that, I just block it.

2030
01:53:29,230 --> 01:53:30,010
Oh god.

2031
01:53:42,970 --> 01:53:44,770
Okay but what if she doesn't jump?

2032
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:45,410
Okay, she does.

2033
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:49,710
That was good though, for a second.

2034
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:51,450
You were walking her to the corner.

2035
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:54,350
That moment of calm was very good.

2036
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:55,470
Okay.

2037
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:04,940
It's over.

2038
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:07,280
I don't think I belong, it's over.

2039
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,660
You just gotta... oh.

2040
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:15,840
Wake up drive reversal?

2041
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:16,520
Can we do it?

2042
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,100
Not quite.

2043
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:20,080
Okay.

2044
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:23,840
So the problem right now is we're still mashing on wake up.

2045
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:26,160
So we just gotta reign that part in.

2046
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:27,460
So just play your normal game.

2047
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:28,960
Yeah.

2048
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:32,260
And just try to hold forward in DI when you get knocked down.

2049
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:33,660
That's the only thing we want to try this...

2050
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:35,280
this match that's new.

2051
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:35,760
Okay.

2052
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:42,640
Okay, hold forward in DI.

2053
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:50,360
So don't mash it, just hold it.

2054
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:52,480
Alright.

2055
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:53,760
Anytime.

2056
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:56,020
Okay, you got it.

2057
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:56,820
That's still a win.

2058
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:58,480
It didn't connect, that's still a win though.

2059
01:54:59,040 --> 01:54:59,440
Okay.

2060
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,040
Nice.

2061
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,180
You won't jump right?

2062
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:08,280
No she... oh my god.

2063
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:13,540
Yeah, at silver 2 they're gonna know to jump.

2064
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:18,000
Okay, same idea.

2065
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,020
If you get knocked down, hold forward in DI.

2066
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:25,660
Okay, it didn't work because they jumped over it, but you got it on command.

2067
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:26,700
That's still a big win.

2068
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:30,360
Okay.

2069
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,060
I think she knows how to jump.

2070
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:40,780
See, that didn't hit.

2071
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,520
That wasn't a combo.

2072
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:43,560
You could have blocked that.

2073
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:50,580
So whenever you see like a big super flash, like the screen freeze and they're doing a super, just hold down back.

2074
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:54,760
Because if they mess up the combo, it's not gonna punish you.

2075
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:55,460
You're gonna block it.

2076
01:55:55,600 --> 01:56:01,520
So that's one thing about blocking is like, the reason they do those big super screen freezes is so that you can think about defense.

2077
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:02,720
So...

2078
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:03,020
Yeah.

2079
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:08,800
She messed up her combo, you could have blocked that and then you could have mashed triangle after the super finish to punish it.

2080
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:12,600
So, those are like telegraph moments like, hey, block.

2081
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:15,300
If you're already getting combo, there's nothing you can do about it.

2082
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:17,480
There's no harm in holding down back, right?

2083
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:18,780
You're already getting bodied.

2084
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:22,920
But if they mess up, you will block it and then you'll get a chance to counter attack.

2085
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:31,920
So, I think that's a big thing is you got to be a little bit more comfortable blocking because these players actually have like real offense.

2086
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,260
And they're just gonna steal all of you if you don't block.

2087
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:36,400
Yeah.

2088
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:37,340
Yeah.

2089
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,320
That's sweet.

2090
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:52,960
Yeah, let's just try blocking on this next wave coming up.

2091
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:54,800
Nice.

2092
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:55,320
You can punish.

2093
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:56,060
Exactly.

2094
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:57,040
See, you were...

2095
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,580
The first time you blocked, you were rewarded perfectly.

2096
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:01,320
There you go.

2097
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:01,960
We're in the game.

2098
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:13,980
No.

2099
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:18,100
That's fine.

2100
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:20,020
You got mixed up.

2101
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:20,700
You got mixed up a little but that's fine.

2102
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:31,530
You got him?

2103
01:57:32,690 --> 01:57:33,370
Very good.

2104
01:57:36,810 --> 01:57:37,210
Oh.

2105
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:38,310
I like the idea.

2106
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:38,910
I like the idea.

2107
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:46,760
Nice.

2108
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:48,380
Oh.

2109
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:51,820
Okay.

2110
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:53,520
Okay.

2111
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:54,720
Good control.

2112
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:56,860
I like your pressure after the command grab.

2113
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:02,740
Oh.

2114
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:06,400
Oh.

2115
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:06,720
What?

2116
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:07,760
You did it a little bit.

2117
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,560
That was a little too early, but you had the right idea.

2118
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,520
Okay, let's try Wake Up Drive Reversal.

2119
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:14,720
Perfect!

2120
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,200
There you go, you're back in the game.

2121
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:30,380
Okay, good blocks.

2122
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:33,100
Okay, just block a little.

2123
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,420
Did you get it?

2124
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:40,260
Yay!

2125
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:42,500
I got it!

2126
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:44,040
Okay, you need one more hit.

2127
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:46,340
This is evening up the game.

2128
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:49,660
Ahhh!

2129
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:52,020
Nice!

2130
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:52,740
One more!

2131
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,020
Okay, okay!

2132
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:59,520
I would say, like, when you're super low in health, that worked out.

2133
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:01,060
You can also just try Square.

2134
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:03,240
Remember, Square is your safe poke.

2135
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:07,580
Like, if you just need to tap it in, get that last little touch, Square is really good in those moments.

2136
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:16,640
Okay, that's fine.

2137
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:17,320
That's totally fine.

2138
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:17,860
That's a throw.

2139
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:18,340
That's fine.

2140
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:19,220
Good defense.

2141
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:22,040
That's fine.

2142
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:23,400
Wake Up Drive Reversal.

2143
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:26,340
I need to be out of here.

2144
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:27,220
Nice!

2145
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:27,880
There you go.

2146
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:30,060
Aww.

2147
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:37,560
Nice.

2148
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:42,570
Good block.

2149
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:45,050
Nice punish.

2150
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:47,030
Oh, I thought she was gonna jump.

2151
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:51,070
Oh my god!

2152
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:51,830
You're cooking!

2153
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:52,470
Let's go!

2154
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:54,250
I'm doing it!

2155
01:59:54,490 --> 01:59:54,970
Finally!

2156
01:59:55,790 --> 01:59:56,350
Let's go!

2157
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:56,670
Okay.

2158
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:01,490
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm doing it!

2159
02:00:03,210 --> 02:00:04,230
Big things are happening.

2160
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:04,830
Okay, let's block.

2161
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:05,210
Let's block.

2162
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,630
Or not.

2163
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:11,190
Blocking?

2164
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:13,350
Nice!

2165
02:00:14,450 --> 02:00:15,730
Nice auto-combo usage.

2166
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:16,770
That was really good, actually.

2167
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:19,930
You found, like, the opening in the neutral right there.

2168
02:00:20,030 --> 02:00:20,590
That was really good.

2169
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:24,410
Oh.

2170
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:25,210
No, no, no, no.

2171
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:25,710
Please, I'm sorry.

2172
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:26,150
You're good.

2173
02:00:26,210 --> 02:00:26,550
Play defense.

2174
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:27,430
Play defense for a little.

2175
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:28,950
Oh.

2176
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:30,090
You're still fine.

2177
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:30,450
Don't worry.

2178
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:32,290
I don't feel fine.

2179
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:32,710
I don't...

2180
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:34,810
Okay, you're gonna be in burnout now.

2181
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:37,210
So, you might be screwed.

2182
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:39,670
I don't feel fine.

2183
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:41,670
If they know what they're doing, you're actually screwed.

2184
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:42,910
But you're just down back, maybe?

2185
02:00:43,010 --> 02:00:43,370
Yeah, yeah.

2186
02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:44,610
Okay.

2187
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:46,170
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

2188
02:00:46,590 --> 02:00:48,370
Just wake up drive reversal on this one.

2189
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:50,790
Hold forward and V-I.

2190
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:51,350
Forward and V-I.

2191
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:54,570
It's okay, it's okay.

2192
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:58,450
You're playing the defense better, though.

2193
02:00:58,530 --> 02:00:59,210
It's like...

2194
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:00,450
It's still guessing.

2195
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:01,390
You're gonna get beat up sometimes.

2196
02:01:01,610 --> 02:01:02,930
But you're making good bets.

2197
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:03,630
What the fuck?

2198
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:04,670
She's listening to music.

2199
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:09,530
Yeah, her level 3 activates her music.

2200
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:13,870
It's illegal.

2201
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:20,600
Yeah, there you go.

2202
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:21,120
I like that.

2203
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:21,880
The jump square.

2204
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:23,460
Or jump axe.

2205
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:27,260
Oh no.

2206
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,120
Get your music out of here.

2207
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:31,560
Yeah, her music sucks.

2208
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:34,060
Music allowed.

2209
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:35,960
Nice.

2210
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:39,780
We can try jump axe.

2211
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:45,840
Don't worry.

2212
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,080
This doesn't do much damage.

2213
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:49,780
Okay.

2214
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:51,840
Nice defense.

2215
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:52,820
Punish!

2216
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:54,040
Oh, too early.

2217
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:54,600
No!

2218
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,760
Deep jump!

2219
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,600
You're so alive.

2220
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:57,240
Keep it cool.

2221
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:57,680
You're good.

2222
02:01:58,620 --> 02:01:59,140
Okay.

2223
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:00,900
I don't feel good.

2224
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:02,480
When you're ready...

2225
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:04,480
I'm not ready.

2226
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:06,000
You can do like a jump axe or something.

2227
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:09,340
But...

2228
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:12,760
Okay, it didn't work out, but you had the right idea there.

2229
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:15,620
You blocked and they did something unsafe and you tried to punish.

2230
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:16,800
You just did it a little too early.

2231
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:18,240
But you have the right idea.

2232
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:19,860
And you see why blocking is good.

2233
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:21,780
People will just mess up and you can punish them.

2234
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:26,570
Nice blocks.

2235
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:30,130
Yep, see?

2236
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:31,350
You're blocking and they don't know what to do.

2237
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:32,730
Oh my god, I'm killing it.

2238
02:02:32,730 --> 02:02:33,170
They're killing themselves.

2239
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:35,210
I'm doing it.

2240
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:36,010
Nice.

2241
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:43,210
Oh my god.

2242
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:44,650
That was fucking sick.

2243
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:45,990
That was amazing.

2244
02:02:46,490 --> 02:02:47,450
Hell yes.

2245
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:49,870
Let's go.

2246
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,580
Nice.

2247
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,160
Good blocks.

2248
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:58,540
Good blocks.

2249
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:03,940
Okay, let's try wake up drive reversal.

2250
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:04,400
Yeah.

2251
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,840
Oh, it's too late.

2252
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:07,240
Okay, it's fine.

2253
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:07,560
You survived.

2254
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:09,920
Nice.

2255
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,780
Oh, I couldn't get the grab.

2256
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:13,140
Yeah, because it hit.

2257
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:14,700
That's when square is handy, right?

2258
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:17,220
We get close, we try mashing some crouching square.

2259
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:19,480
Oh my god.

2260
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:20,280
Leave me alone.

2261
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:21,300
There you go.

2262
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:21,740
There you go.

2263
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:22,020
You got it.

2264
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:23,540
Oh, I'm fucking tired though.

2265
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:24,920
Yeah, you're in a bad spot.

2266
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:26,100
Goodbye.

2267
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:26,920
You're gonna die.

2268
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:28,320
Goodbye.

2269
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:30,760
Wait a minute.

2270
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:31,980
Okay.

2271
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:33,760
Don't worry.

2272
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:35,120
You got full meter this round.

2273
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:38,380
You got your level three in case she starts mauling.

2274
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:38,980
You're in a good spot.

2275
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,480
What the fuck?

2276
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:42,660
Okay.

2277
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:43,700
Wake up drive reversal.

2278
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:45,120
Oh, punish.

2279
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:46,640
Oh, no.

2280
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:50,020
She's doing everything.

2281
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:51,380
There you go.

2282
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:52,380
You got the drive reversal.

2283
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:53,840
So you're ready to play.

2284
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:57,840
No.

2285
02:03:58,700 --> 02:03:59,980
Let's just press the move.

2286
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:05,320
That was crazy.

2287
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:06,960
I'm getting nauseous from the frame rate.

2288
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:07,640
That was really good.

2289
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:08,920
Okay.

2290
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:15,200
Okay, block it out.

2291
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:16,180
No.

2292
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:21,020
Okay, just block it out.

2293
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:22,480
Yeah, block it out.

2294
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:23,480
Ah, they threw you.

2295
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:23,960
That was smart.

2296
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:24,580
She's grabbing me.

2297
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,960
Yeah, I think you're getting closer.

2298
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:30,080
There's still...

2299
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:34,280
You're losing a lot of life from still mashing and missing drive reversal.

2300
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,960
But the moments are there.

2301
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:38,640
You see what I'm saying?

2302
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:40,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2303
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:46,320
They end up just doing something unsafe and then you get a free triangle grab and then they lose a huge chunk of life.

2304
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:53,800
So if you just keep working on that, just keeping it cool on your defense, you're gonna get so many more opportunities to punish them.

2305
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:54,880
Okay.

2306
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:59,060
And yeah, I gotta fix something with this video.

2307
02:04:59,120 --> 02:04:59,860
This is getting nuts.

2308
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:00,420
I don't know.

2309
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,660
I put it on the lowest, too.

2310
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,860
I have nitro, so...

2311
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:07,200
Maybe it's me?

2312
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,040
I don't know.

2313
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:08,900
Do you have nitro?

2314
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:09,480
No.

2315
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:11,120
Okay, maybe?

2316
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:12,240
I'm old.

2317
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:19,240
Stream attenuation strength?

2318
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:22,960
What the hell is this?

2319
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,260
I'm checking mine.

2320
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,000
Recent video...

2321
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,260
Do I need to check something?

2322
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:33,880
Should I have hardware acceleration on?

2323
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:40,000
Tell Doki to check stream quality parameter when choosing resolution.

2324
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:41,660
That's what they said.

2325
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:44,080
What the fuck does that mean?

2326
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:44,760
I don't know.

2327
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:46,440
We can worry about it another time.

2328
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:47,460
I can check that later.

2329
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:48,900
Yeah, right now.

2330
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,140
I don't think we can check it right now.

2331
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:53,480
I'm fighting a buff lady.

2332
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:54,100
Okay.

2333
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:00,280
Wake up drive reversal.

2334
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:02,500
Yes.

2335
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:03,160
Hell yes.

2336
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:03,700
There you go.

2337
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:06,160
Come on.

2338
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:07,300
Come on, lady.

2339
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:08,880
Yep, nice.

2340
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:09,800
Very good.

2341
02:06:09,940 --> 02:06:10,640
Come on.

2342
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:13,540
Bye, lady.

2343
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:13,720
See?

2344
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:16,580
You got that one wake up drive reversal then you dominated the rest of the game.

2345
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:18,560
Ties it together.

2346
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:23,680
Lucky.

2347
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,740
Leave me alone.

2348
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:27,200
You got the health.

2349
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:27,640
It don't matter.

2350
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:30,200
Perfect.

2351
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:33,340
She's on a 7 win streak?

2352
02:06:33,580 --> 02:06:34,520
What the fuck are you doing?

2353
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,480
You're about to end that.

2354
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:35,900
Don't worry.

2355
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:37,500
I hope so.

2356
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,460
Alright, let's be careful with the meter.

2357
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:40,480
Let's just use heavies.

2358
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:41,940
Stand heavy.

2359
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:44,960
Get out.

2360
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:46,560
Oh, shit.

2361
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:47,200
Never mind.

2362
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:47,880
I'll get out.

2363
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:48,660
Alright, lady.

2364
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,760
You can have this area.

2365
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:52,860
Sorry, lady.

2366
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:53,320
Nice.

2367
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:54,300
Easy triangle.

2368
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:55,500
Very good.

2369
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:56,460
Yay!

2370
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,060
Go win streak for you!

2371
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:01,260
Yay!

2372
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,200
And I'm leaving.

2373
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:02,880
No!

2374
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:03,180
What?

2375
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:05,880
Doki, no.

2376
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:09,140
Doki, these are the demons we have to fight.

2377
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:14,260
It's not the external demons of your opponents.

2378
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:17,060
It's your internal demons we have to fight here.

2379
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:18,500
We gotta run it back.

2380
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:22,320
Listen, I don't know.

2381
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:25,820
You're like a menace in these green streets.

2382
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:27,660
Send a message.

2383
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:30,600
They'll remember that.

2384
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,120
Don't worry.

2385
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:32,320
They'll remember.

2386
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:35,460
Good.

2387
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:38,100
I want one person to remember.

2388
02:07:38,580 --> 02:07:39,040
Okay.

2389
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:41,560
That's the same thing we want to send.

2390
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:44,540
Oh my god, please.

2391
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,720
Stop doing your leg stuff.

2392
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,920
Yeah, that heavy is gonna be good.

2393
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:55,440
I keep saying heavy.

2394
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:55,680
Sorry.

2395
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:56,240
Stand circle.

2396
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:58,500
The big punch.

2397
02:07:58,740 --> 02:07:59,080
Yeah.

2398
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:01,400
Perfect.

2399
02:08:01,980 --> 02:08:02,220
See?

2400
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:04,780
Yeah, she's doing that at those ranges where that move is really good.

2401
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:10,280
I guide her range.

2402
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:11,740
Nice.

2403
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:14,040
Get out.

2404
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:16,080
Get outta here.

2405
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:20,320
Very good, very good.

2406
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:20,800
That's right.

2407
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:21,360
Oh, shit.

2408
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:23,380
She's gonna do a lot of DI's.

2409
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:25,400
I'll do that again.

2410
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:26,740
Come closer.

2411
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:28,760
I'm sorry.

2412
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:29,340
There you go.

2413
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:29,840
She has no meter.

2414
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:30,480
You can do DI.

2415
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:31,280
You can do whatever you want.

2416
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:34,460
No, she jumped!

2417
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:35,880
You're alive?

2418
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:37,220
Nice drive reversal.

2419
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:38,180
No.

2420
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:39,180
Oh.

2421
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:43,240
Yeah, that was unlucky.

2422
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:51,440
Nice.

2423
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:53,520
Oh.

2424
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:58,180
Yeah, against this kind of player, you're gonna have to wait for them to DI.

2425
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,820
They're doing a lot of random DI's.

2426
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:05,040
So, if they're on the ground, I would just wait for them to do the DI.

2427
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:06,940
And then do yours in response.

2428
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:08,620
Okay.

2429
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:10,340
Oh, no.

2430
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:11,780
Don't touch me.

2431
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:15,020
Yeah.

2432
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:17,080
Let them kill themselves, this kind of player.

2433
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:18,220
They're gonna do something random.

2434
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:24,400
They're gonna go into the air with that DB, the pinwheel, and grab them when they land.

2435
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:26,740
And if they do random DI, just do your DI back.

2436
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:30,780
This kind of player doing less is better, because they just do unsafe stuff all the time.

2437
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:33,520
Oh, shit.

2438
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:33,840
Okay.

2439
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:34,000
Yeah.

2440
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:34,840
See what I'm saying?

2441
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:35,640
They're just kind of mashing them.

2442
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:37,880
So, when you approach, it's kind of let them wake up.

2443
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:39,340
So, you could have DI'd that in return.

2444
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:39,760
There you go.

2445
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:40,240
That's a punish.

2446
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:41,940
Did she go first?

2447
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:42,420
No!

2448
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:43,040
Yeah!

2449
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:46,300
I was first!

2450
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,220
Or second!

2451
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:51,700
So, you can just walk her down, and wait for something unsafe.

2452
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:53,200
That's good.

2453
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:54,300
So, just wait here.

2454
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:54,780
Yep.

2455
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:55,420
There you go.

2456
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:56,120
Just wait.

2457
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:58,680
Oh, I thought her thing was gone.

2458
02:09:58,780 --> 02:09:59,000
Okay.

2459
02:09:59,360 --> 02:09:59,940
Now I know.

2460
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:01,580
Level 3?

2461
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:02,200
That's right.

2462
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:03,360
Get over here!

2463
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:05,160
Yee-haw!

2464
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:06,660
Yeah.

2465
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:10,680
These kind of players, you don't even need to do any offense when they're knocked down.

2466
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:14,960
Just kind of let them stand up, and be at a threatening range, and then wait for them to do something.

2467
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:16,360
Oh, they ran this time.

2468
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:16,620
See?

2469
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:17,960
Oh, nice.

2470
02:10:18,140 --> 02:10:18,400
Okay.

2471
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:19,620
I didn't want to fight them anyway.

2472
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:20,900
Oh, they're scared.

2473
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:22,300
Wait.

2474
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:23,740
Oh, my gosh.

2475
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:24,280
Why can't I?

2476
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:25,360
Oh, my gosh.

2477
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:25,680
Please.

2478
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:29,020
You can change this to...

2479
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:31,420
Change this to confirm, opponent.

2480
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:32,320
That setting.

2481
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:35,140
It doesn't have to auto-accept.

2482
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:36,760
You can change it to confirm.

2483
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:41,960
Yeah, I had that on because, like, I was just... no life grinding.

2484
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:43,080
Okay.

2485
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:45,480
What did your chat say to fix the video?

2486
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,580
What did they say?

2487
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:48,940
Chat, how do we fix video?

2488
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:52,220
There might be someone who knows what's going on here.

2489
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:53,100
Hardware acceleration?

2490
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:55,240
Okay, I put hardware acceleration on.

2491
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:57,900
Is it better?

2492
02:10:58,420 --> 02:10:58,920
Oh, wait.

2493
02:10:58,960 --> 02:10:59,840
We can't tell until...

2494
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:03,240
The frame rate only drops when you're in the game, really.

2495
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:04,380
Yeah, when I'm in the game.

2496
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:05,780
But the resolution already looks better.

2497
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:08,740
Well, I changed the resolution just now.

2498
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:09,720
Okay.

2499
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:10,580
Yeah.

2500
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:17,440
Okay.

2501
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:19,040
I don't know.

2502
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:19,700
I think it's better.

2503
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:20,100
We'll see.

2504
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:20,880
Oh, God.

2505
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,260
See?

2506
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:22,380
That's why we turn it on.

2507
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:24,560
That orange bar?

2508
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:25,400
Don't accept that.

2509
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:26,300
Oh.

2510
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:28,020
I've been accepting that all night.

2511
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,000
Yeah.

2512
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:30,700
So, let's see what they give you here.

2513
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:31,360
See?

2514
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:32,140
Yeah.

2515
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:34,620
Okay, but it could be funny.

2516
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:35,760
I mean...

2517
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,040
You're not wrong about that part, but...

2518
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:39,860
It could be fun.

2519
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:41,920
It depends on what kind of fun you're trying to have.

2520
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,160
I've played against so many people in Asia.

2521
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:47,680
You've been having a really interesting...

2522
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:48,940
Yeah, I saw your matchmaking.

2523
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:50,160
I was like, why is this match...

2524
02:11:50,590 --> 02:11:51,660
It's a Chinese player.

2525
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:56,820
Normally, you gotta reign in the connections.

2526
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:58,040
Ooh, Wi-Fi.

2527
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:59,140
But I do it.

2528
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:01,660
Oh, why did I do it?

2529
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:04,820
I'd rather you have taken the wired red than the Wi-Fi orange.

2530
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:07,200
Why did I do it?

2531
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:08,020
This is gonna be ugly.

2532
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,760
I don't like playing against this character.

2533
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:14,580
Just do your circle.

2534
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:16,180
I thought it'd be funny.

2535
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:17,820
Do your circle.

2536
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:19,320
It charges and it'll...

2537
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:20,180
Yeah, do that.

2538
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:21,160
That'll beat his fireballs.

2539
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:21,620
Okay.

2540
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:25,280
I originally thought it'd be funny.

2541
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:28,220
Aww.

2542
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:32,780
What the fuck?

2543
02:12:34,620 --> 02:12:35,720
Oh my god, I can't.

2544
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:37,040
You got it.

2545
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:37,680
You got the idea.

2546
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:39,640
There you go.

2547
02:12:39,660 --> 02:12:39,920
You're in.

2548
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:40,260
Fuck you.

2549
02:12:42,020 --> 02:12:43,100
Fuck you, bro.

2550
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:45,560
Nobody loves you.

2551
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:52,460
You just gotta walk him down.

2552
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:52,920
There you go.

2553
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:54,660
Okay.

2554
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:56,900
Time to walk him down.

2555
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:57,480
Patience.

2556
02:12:59,020 --> 02:12:59,660
You can jump.

2557
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:02,160
Oh.

2558
02:13:02,980 --> 02:13:03,460
Okay.

2559
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:04,600
Okay.

2560
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:05,040
One more.

2561
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:05,360
One more.

2562
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:06,140
Nice.

2563
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:06,840
Exactly.

2564
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:07,160
See?

2565
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:08,940
Your mom doesn't love you.

2566
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:09,380
Wow.

2567
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,060
Man.

2568
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:12,400
We're just trying to have fun too, you know?

2569
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:13,980
Wow.

2570
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:22,000
Oh no.

2571
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:24,300
He doesn't know what he's doing.

2572
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:24,660
Don't worry.

2573
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:31,340
Oh my god.

2574
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:31,920
Please.

2575
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:33,860
Please.

2576
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:35,820
Leave me alone.

2577
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:39,780
You're winning.

2578
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:40,340
You're winning.

2579
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:41,060
Yeah, I'm gonna stress it.

2580
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:42,340
Yeah.

2581
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:42,780
See?

2582
02:13:43,180 --> 02:13:43,620
Okay.

2583
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:50,380
I swear to god, if you fucking do your perfect shit, I swear to fucking god.

2584
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:54,200
So, when he's walking backwards, he doesn't have the big kick.

2585
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:55,420
He can't kick you.

2586
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:58,100
So when he's walking backwards like that, you can jump at him.

2587
02:13:59,780 --> 02:14:00,220
Yeah.

2588
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:02,140
Oh.

2589
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:04,900
If I had a little bit more HP.

2590
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:08,280
No, that loses after three hits.

2591
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:08,840
Really?

2592
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:09,160
Yeah.

2593
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:12,520
That's why it's not good to DI too often.

2594
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,380
Because people can just hit you out of it if they're ready.

2595
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:16,360
Okay.

2596
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:18,640
Okay.

2597
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:22,500
Bye.

2598
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:22,720
Don't worry.

2599
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:24,000
He's gonna throw more fireballs.

2600
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:25,640
So just wait for a little bit.

2601
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:27,660
Nice parries.

2602
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:30,800
Come on, bro.

2603
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:33,340
You can walk at him and then jump X.

2604
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:36,980
Okay.

2605
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:37,620
Now don't jump.

2606
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:38,020
Don't jump.

2607
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,200
See how he's crouching?

2608
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:40,160
There you go.

2609
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:41,320
Now you could have grabbed that.

2610
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:43,120
When he's crouching, he's gonna do the big kick.

2611
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:44,540
Okay.

2612
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:46,580
But if he's not crouching, you can jump.

2613
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:49,140
Oh, please.

2614
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:50,960
You're good.

2615
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,680
Fuck this.

2616
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:52,560
Nice.

2617
02:14:58,200 --> 02:14:58,560
Perfect.

2618
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:01,140
It's not so bad.

2619
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:04,100
You need some patience a little bit.

2620
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:06,820
But it's not so bad.

2621
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:07,940
You hit harder than he does.

2622
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:09,240
Nice.

2623
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,660
So you're gonna run it back, right?

2624
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:13,440
No.

2625
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:14,740
Wow.

2626
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:17,800
Nobody's playing that in my division.

2627
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:19,620
Wow.

2628
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:20,780
I don't have to worry.

2629
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:24,700
Okay, I'll do 3 to 5.

2630
02:15:24,700 --> 02:15:25,700
Yeah, 3 to 5 is good.

2631
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:27,060
And you don't have to do worldwide.

2632
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:29,880
I mean, I guess if you do 3 to 5, it's better.

2633
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,860
What if this person has really good internet?

2634
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:37,200
From across the ocean.

2635
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:42,280
I think the laws of physics kinda make that not relevant.

2636
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:43,880
Done.

2637
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:53,260
Okay, but what if he doesn't jump?

2638
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:54,340
Okay, he does.

2639
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:55,280
So he knows.

2640
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:58,820
This guy's jumping at you.

2641
02:15:58,940 --> 02:16:01,000
So you gotta look to anti-air him.

2642
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:02,140
Okay.

2643
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:03,740
Or just down triangle if he jumps.

2644
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:07,520
Oh shit.

2645
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:09,660
Oh no.

2646
02:16:11,180 --> 02:16:11,960
Oh no!

2647
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:15,220
Nice.

2648
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:16,660
Oh sick!

2649
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:17,740
Get out!

2650
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:18,660
Get out of here!

2651
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:20,400
Get out!

2652
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:22,680
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2653
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:26,540
Okay, maybe I'll get out.

2654
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:26,940
It's fine.

2655
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:28,180
I'm fine with that.

2656
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:30,380
Oh no.

2657
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:32,680
That was a bad reaction.

2658
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:33,380
Yeah.

2659
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:34,400
Nice.

2660
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:36,520
Really good down-forth circle.

2661
02:16:36,660 --> 02:16:37,240
That was really good.

2662
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:39,220
Nice.

2663
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:39,560
Okay.

2664
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:40,160
Good pressure.

2665
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:41,940
That was fucking brilliant.

2666
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:43,060
Yay!

2667
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:45,480
Like, that was legit a high-level technique.

2668
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:46,880
Like, that was amazing.

2669
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:50,960
The mediums, or the X, and then stop and command grab?

2670
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:51,600
Really good.

2671
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:54,720
Stop.

2672
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,320
Oh my god!

2673
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:05,880
Can you stop doing that?

2674
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:07,260
Please, sir.

2675
02:17:09,580 --> 02:17:10,900
This is a no-fly zone.

2676
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:19,300
You can do more of the circle when you're standing around there.

2677
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:20,800
Yeah.

2678
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:21,140
Yeah.

2679
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:21,700
There you go.

2680
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:28,140
Oh no!

2681
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:29,100
It's okay.

2682
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:30,380
Wake-up drive reversal.

2683
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:31,100
Okay.

2684
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:32,320
You're gonna live, I think.

2685
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:32,340
Okay.

2686
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:33,240
I live?

2687
02:17:33,860 --> 02:17:35,720
I think you... You have a lot of health.

2688
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:36,140
You're evil.

2689
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:36,800
I don't think so!

2690
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:37,360
I...

2691
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:40,340
You live.

2692
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:41,020
Wake-up drive reversal.

2693
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:41,440
Oh, shit!

2694
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:42,380
Okay.

2695
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:43,260
Nevermind.

2696
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:43,600
It's too late.

2697
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:43,980
Oh!

2698
02:17:44,220 --> 02:17:44,940
You got him!

2699
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:45,500
Goodbye.

2700
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,500
I don't think he dies, though.

2701
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:51,100
I think he's dead.

2702
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:52,360
That's CA.

2703
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:54,080
Oh, shit!

2704
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:54,520
Yeah, he's dead.

2705
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:56,120
I broke his sixth win streak!

2706
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:58,160
You cooked him.

2707
02:17:58,260 --> 02:17:58,480
Nice.

2708
02:17:58,800 --> 02:17:59,160
Okay.

2709
02:17:59,200 --> 02:17:59,480
Run back.

2710
02:17:59,580 --> 02:17:59,780
Run back.

2711
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:00,340
That's a good match.

2712
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:01,980
Yeah.

2713
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:02,580
Run back.

2714
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:03,100
Run back.

2715
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:03,460
Run back.

2716
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:03,800
Run back.

2717
02:18:03,860 --> 02:18:03,920
Yeah.

2718
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:04,960
I wanna give a statement.

2719
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:06,780
No, but he's... He's...

2720
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:06,860
You're learning.

2721
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:07,800
You're doing good.

2722
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:08,360
You're learning.

2723
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:11,780
But... I like giving a statement.

2724
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,940
The statement will be when we win the tournament.

2725
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:15,780
That's... That's the time to make the statement.

2726
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:16,700
He doesn't know that!

2727
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:18,300
Listen.

2728
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:19,500
It's not about... He doesn't know!

2729
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:21,380
This guy is just part of the training montage.

2730
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:24,700
He's just a... He's a supporting character for, like, 12 seconds.

2731
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:25,460
Don't worry about it.

2732
02:18:26,180 --> 02:18:30,640
Yeah, but I want him to, like... I want him to live rent-free in his head.

2733
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:32,160
Listen.

2734
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,720
I respect it, but at the same time...

2735
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:36,920
We gotta do it when it counts.

2736
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:40,600
Tournament, you can't run away after one.

2737
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:47,000
Oh, shit.

2738
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,080
That was the... That's not what I wanted to do.

2739
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:51,480
Yeah, the heavies at that range are pretty good.

2740
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:53,800
No!

2741
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:54,720
Ah, yeah.

2742
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:55,740
Super middle there.

2743
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:02,700
Nice.

2744
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:09,600
That was a good idea.

2745
02:19:09,640 --> 02:19:10,360
He just happened to jump.

2746
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:13,000
Oh, no.

2747
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:15,480
Oh, no!

2748
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:16,720
He did that!

2749
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:24,560
Okay, let's wait, and then when he jumps, down plus triangle.

2750
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:27,200
Because he keeps just jumping at you.

2751
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:34,700
Oh, my God!

2752
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:35,920
He figured me out!

2753
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:36,580
That was a good idea.

2754
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:37,840
But this is when you counter-adapt.

2755
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:38,960
This is what really tests you.

2756
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:41,720
So now you're playing a real set, so...

2757
02:19:45,030 --> 02:19:45,390
Yep!

2758
02:19:45,510 --> 02:19:47,090
Jump X is gonna be really good against him.

2759
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:49,170
Oh, fuck.

2760
02:19:50,030 --> 02:19:50,630
Okay, let's block.

2761
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:52,390
Yeah, just block a little.

2762
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:53,550
Nice.

2763
02:19:53,690 --> 02:19:53,970
Okay.

2764
02:19:55,730 --> 02:19:56,350
Jump X?

2765
02:19:56,410 --> 02:19:56,710
Perfect.

2766
02:19:56,890 --> 02:19:57,170
Square?

2767
02:19:57,250 --> 02:19:57,450
Yep!

2768
02:19:57,570 --> 02:19:58,290
Jump X and square.

2769
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:06,520
Okay, but what if he doesn't jump?

2770
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:07,820
He jumps every time.

2771
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,440
Sometimes he doesn't!

2772
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:12,560
He's jumping way too much, actually.

2773
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:13,200
That's his problem.

2774
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:15,240
Okay.

2775
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:17,340
He's gonna jump every time.

2776
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:17,940
That was an accident.

2777
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:18,900
That was an accident.

2778
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:19,120
Okay.

2779
02:20:21,060 --> 02:20:21,460
Misinput.

2780
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:25,880
Oh, God.

2781
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:33,030
Just block, block.

2782
02:20:33,090 --> 02:20:33,370
Yeah.

2783
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:33,930
Okay.

2784
02:20:34,050 --> 02:20:35,370
He can move first after that.

2785
02:20:35,430 --> 02:20:37,710
If he does that full charge punch, you just gotta block after.

2786
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:44,680
Just block.

2787
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:45,540
Block.

2788
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:46,240
Yeah, there you go.

2789
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:47,580
Now you can play.

2790
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:52,040
Nice.

2791
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:52,660
Don't... Okay.

2792
02:20:53,940 --> 02:20:55,600
Don't mash that one too much.

2793
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:56,120
That's the only thing.

2794
02:20:56,320 --> 02:20:56,620
Okay.

2795
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:00,800
Nice.

2796
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,080
That was a really good time to use that.

2797
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:08,030
Okay.

2798
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:09,770
Just need one more good sequence.

2799
02:21:12,050 --> 02:21:12,710
Nice defense.

2800
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:16,170
Nice defense.

2801
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:18,950
No, he countered it.

2802
02:21:19,110 --> 02:21:19,390
Don't worry.

2803
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:19,790
Oh, goodbye.

2804
02:21:20,310 --> 02:21:20,710
No, no, no.

2805
02:21:20,710 --> 02:21:21,790
You have plenty of health.

2806
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:22,670
You have plenty of health.

2807
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:22,990
Okay.

2808
02:21:22,990 --> 02:21:23,830
Oh, wait.

2809
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:24,730
I'm on the right side.

2810
02:21:27,430 --> 02:21:28,510
Oh, what do I do here?

2811
02:21:28,630 --> 02:21:29,370
Just block, block, block.

2812
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:33,850
No, no, like try like a jump X or something when you get closer.

2813
02:21:34,050 --> 02:21:34,690
There you go.

2814
02:21:35,990 --> 02:21:36,910
Oh, fuck it!

2815
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:38,450
You had the right idea.

2816
02:21:38,590 --> 02:21:39,670
You just missed timed it.

2817
02:21:39,790 --> 02:21:40,750
That was smart though.

2818
02:21:40,970 --> 02:21:41,330
Yeah.

2819
02:21:42,390 --> 02:21:43,490
Okay, that was a good set though.

2820
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:45,010
That was good.

2821
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:48,710
The only thing I would say is that was a very jumpy player.

2822
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:49,590
Yeah.

2823
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:52,870
If we can get better at the anti-airs, like just keeping it cool.

2824
02:21:52,910 --> 02:21:52,970
Yeah.

2825
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:57,570
And then seeing him jump and then doing the lariat, you could have controlled a little bit more.

2826
02:21:57,850 --> 02:22:01,850
But you started doing better when you were blocking on wake up a bit more too, right?

2827
02:22:02,130 --> 02:22:02,710
Uh-huh.

2828
02:22:02,970 --> 02:22:07,730
Because especially Ed, like a lot of characters, like I said, they'll try to hit you from a distance when you wake up.

2829
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:10,610
And every time you mash into that, you're just giving them free damage.

2830
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:14,310
So if they're not even close to you, they can't throw you at all.

2831
02:22:14,370 --> 02:22:15,690
There's no reason to not block.

2832
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:24,440
What the fuck?

2833
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:25,900
I parried that.

2834
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:28,240
Is it because of your Wi-Fi?

2835
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:28,900
Is this it?

2836
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:31,000
You might feel it.

2837
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:31,820
Yeah, maybe.

2838
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:33,980
I paid.

2839
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:36,240
Oh, God.

2840
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:37,680
Okay, we got to block it out.

2841
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:38,280
We got to block it out.

2842
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:38,820
We got to block it out.

2843
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:39,180
Okay.

2844
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:41,820
Okay, that was a bit too much blocking.

2845
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,600
He whiffed.

2846
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:45,080
He did whiff like five throws.

2847
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:48,040
Maybe at that point, we mashed some squares.

2848
02:22:53,360 --> 02:22:53,720
Nice.

2849
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:54,200
My turn.

2850
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:55,080
Good walk under.

2851
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:56,160
My turn.

2852
02:22:57,940 --> 02:22:58,380
Oh, whoa.

2853
02:22:58,380 --> 02:22:59,820
Yeah, that's not going to work against him.

2854
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:00,940
Let's abandon that.

2855
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:03,440
Let's try to do some crouching squares.

2856
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:04,560
So let's block.

2857
02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:05,660
Nice.

2858
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:06,340
Now, crouch square.

2859
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:06,920
Perfect.

2860
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:09,680
Oh, my God.

2861
02:23:09,740 --> 02:23:10,800
Please get me out of this corner.

2862
02:23:11,820 --> 02:23:12,360
Thank you.

2863
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:15,240
Okay.

2864
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:19,480
Oh, my God.

2865
02:23:21,460 --> 02:23:22,500
Jump X would have worked there.

2866
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:24,400
Okay.

2867
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:25,400
Let's run it back.

2868
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:26,360
Hopefully, it doesn't run.

2869
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:26,740
So...

2870
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:30,640
When you're jumping over the fireballs, that jump X is really good.

2871
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:35,080
And then if you also focus on wake up drive reversal, this guy is pressuring you super hard.

2872
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:37,740
Hold forward in DI and wake up if you get knocked down.

2873
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:39,080
And you'll get it.

2874
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:41,600
Yeah, you did the jump X a little too early, but that's the right idea.

2875
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:42,520
Okay.

2876
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:45,620
Perfect.

2877
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:47,440
And then you can just walk away.

2878
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:48,940
He's going to do a random uppercut after.

2879
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:52,500
So after you land a jump in, just block because he's going to whip a giant uppercut.

2880
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:54,140
And then when he lands, you press triangle.

2881
02:23:55,880 --> 02:23:56,200
See?

2882
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:56,760
He did it again.

2883
02:23:56,820 --> 02:23:58,600
If you would just block there, he would have landed.

2884
02:23:58,600 --> 02:23:59,200
You press triangle.

2885
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:05,260
Now you can do DI.

2886
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:08,380
I tried.

2887
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:09,140
That's okay.

2888
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:09,920
He jumps.

2889
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:11,100
Yeah.

2890
02:24:11,740 --> 02:24:12,720
He's aware of that.

2891
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:18,340
Yeah.

2892
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:19,180
We had a block there.

2893
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:26,720
See?

2894
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:27,240
You got to block.

2895
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:27,440
See?

2896
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:29,640
Every time you get in, he's just going to do that uppercut.

2897
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:30,120
Just block.

2898
02:24:30,220 --> 02:24:30,360
Yeah.

2899
02:24:30,380 --> 02:24:31,580
Now when he lands, triangle.

2900
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:32,240
No.

2901
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:32,980
Just wait for him to land.

2902
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:33,140
Oh, okay.

2903
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:33,700
Yeah.

2904
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:34,000
Oh.

2905
02:24:36,980 --> 02:24:37,820
Oh my god.

2906
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:38,700
Get out.

2907
02:24:44,060 --> 02:24:44,480
Okay.

2908
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:44,960
Just block.

2909
02:24:45,020 --> 02:24:45,160
Block.

2910
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:45,320
Block.

2911
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:45,620
Oh.

2912
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:46,700
Oh.

2913
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:47,780
Don't try to do...

2914
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:50,180
Against this kind of player, don't do anything.

2915
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:51,960
Just do one move and then block.

2916
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:52,560
Okay.

2917
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:53,920
They are going to do something unsafe.

2918
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:56,460
Oh.

2919
02:24:57,380 --> 02:24:57,800
Nice.

2920
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,600
Good awareness.

2921
02:24:59,040 --> 02:24:59,460
Okay.

2922
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:00,760
He's going to do it again.

2923
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:02,900
So get one jump in and then we're going to block.

2924
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:03,360
He's going to do it again.

2925
02:25:05,140 --> 02:25:05,860
Oh no.

2926
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:07,020
Block.

2927
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:07,340
Block.

2928
02:25:07,380 --> 02:25:07,500
Block.

2929
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:08,240
He tried.

2930
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:08,600
He tried.

2931
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:09,680
He messed it up.

2932
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:10,460
He's going to do it again though.

2933
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:11,240
So just get one...

2934
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:13,160
Block.

2935
02:25:13,380 --> 02:25:13,580
Block.

2936
02:25:13,660 --> 02:25:13,820
Block.

2937
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:13,960
Block.

2938
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:14,660
Do it.

2939
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:14,840
Do it.

2940
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:15,020
Do it.

2941
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:15,320
Yes.

2942
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:16,200
Yes.

2943
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:17,960
Exactly.

2944
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:18,500
I can learn.

2945
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:19,760
Exactly.

2946
02:25:20,620 --> 02:25:22,920
I can learn.

2947
02:25:23,180 --> 02:25:25,220
This kind of player, you let them kill themselves.

2948
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:27,640
They are just going to do something unsafe every time.

2949
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:29,180
Yeah.

2950
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:31,160
Nice.

2951
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:33,340
Don't do that.

2952
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:34,040
Don't do that again, bro.

2953
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:34,500
Okay.

2954
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:34,660
Block.

2955
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:35,220
Yep.

2956
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:36,260
Now when he lands...

2957
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:36,860
Oh no.

2958
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:37,780
Too early.

2959
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:38,880
Yeah.

2960
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:40,380
It takes a while for him to land from that one.

2961
02:25:44,340 --> 02:25:45,680
That was just crazy.

2962
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:47,680
Stop.

2963
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:48,460
Okay.

2964
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:49,060
Wake up drive reversal.

2965
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:49,920
Wake up drive reversal.

2966
02:25:50,020 --> 02:25:50,860
Hold forward and DI.

2967
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:51,440
Oh.

2968
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:52,060
He jumped.

2969
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:54,200
Damn.

2970
02:25:54,380 --> 02:25:54,960
He read you.

2971
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:57,540
Oh my gosh.

2972
02:25:58,240 --> 02:26:00,700
He hazard like a little bit.

2973
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:01,300
Yeah.

2974
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:02,680
Yeah.

2975
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:03,320
You're just not feeling it.

2976
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:04,700
He ain't familiar with the timing of his DP.

2977
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:10,260
He does two hits like the one, two, and then he slowly floats down.

2978
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:12,020
You just got to wait for him to hit the ground.

2979
02:26:13,180 --> 02:26:13,520
Okay.

2980
02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:15,440
So you got the strategy.

2981
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:16,580
You just got to work on the execution.

2982
02:26:24,350 --> 02:26:24,950
That was good.

2983
02:26:25,050 --> 02:26:25,370
You're adapting.

2984
02:26:25,630 --> 02:26:26,410
Oh man, Rasheed.

2985
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:27,910
Rasheed can be tough.

2986
02:26:30,530 --> 02:26:31,150
All right.

2987
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:31,870
Let's go.

2988
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:42,360
Okay.

2989
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:43,560
Okay.

2990
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:44,980
But what if he doesn't jump?

2991
02:26:48,060 --> 02:26:50,060
We're not in bronze anymore, I'm sorry.

2992
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:53,960
But what if...

2993
02:26:57,320 --> 02:26:59,560
It'll work on one silver player.

2994
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:01,200
I believe.

2995
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:06,100
I think so too, but if it doesn't work one time, it's probably not going to work the second time.

2996
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:07,600
That's all we got to remember.

2997
02:27:12,180 --> 02:27:13,060
Okay, we got to block.

2998
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:15,000
It's time to block.

2999
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:16,500
Or that.

3000
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:17,140
We can do that too.

3001
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:19,280
Yeah, your low end drive meter is the only thing.

3002
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:20,840
Okay, don't worry, you're not going to die.

3003
02:27:20,980 --> 02:27:23,520
You can do drive reversal again after this is done.

3004
02:27:25,660 --> 02:27:27,420
Don't worry, now you're out.

3005
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:29,800
You knew.

3006
02:27:34,570 --> 02:27:36,070
Nice, just need one more.

3007
02:27:36,430 --> 02:27:37,250
Oh no!

3008
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:40,250
Nice drive reversal.

3009
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:41,490
No!

3010
02:27:42,010 --> 02:27:43,390
So close, so close.

3011
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:45,430
Oh my god, he's already won!

3012
02:27:51,850 --> 02:27:52,730
Very good.

3013
02:27:52,850 --> 02:27:54,630
Perfect jump in to command grab.

3014
02:27:56,190 --> 02:27:56,670
Oh.

3015
02:27:57,790 --> 02:27:58,570
Oh my god.

3016
02:28:02,410 --> 02:28:02,890
Nice.

3017
02:28:03,890 --> 02:28:04,370
Perfect.

3018
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:09,140
Woah.

3019
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:14,920
Good defense.

3020
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:16,360
Yeah, that was good defense.

3021
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,280
Blocking it out, now you're back to playing the game.

3022
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:21,460
Okay.

3023
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,080
Oh no.

3024
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:25,400
Bro, stop.

3025
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:27,060
You're not cool.

3026
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:31,180
You don't look cool.

3027
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:35,280
Oh, I thought she was going to jump.

3028
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:36,800
That was a misread.

3029
02:28:40,820 --> 02:28:41,440
Get out.

3030
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:43,860
This person is also kind of like the Ken player.

3031
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:47,600
Not as often, but they like to do the uppercut, the invincible uppercut.

3032
02:28:47,820 --> 02:28:47,840
Yeah.

3033
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:51,560
So, it's also good to just get near them and let them wake up.

3034
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:53,220
And they'll do the spinning move into the air.

3035
02:28:53,380 --> 02:28:54,600
And when they land, you can command grab.

3036
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:57,260
Yeah, see if you were blocking there, you could have command grabbed that.

3037
02:28:57,880 --> 02:28:58,240
So...

3038
02:28:58,240 --> 02:28:58,900
Yeah.

3039
02:28:59,100 --> 02:28:59,500
Yeah, perfect.

3040
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:00,680
They don't know what they're doing.

3041
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:02,160
They're just going into unsafe stuff.

3042
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:04,200
So, if you block out, they'll give you opportunities to punish.

3043
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:08,720
Good defense.

3044
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:11,140
Oh no, he knows.

3045
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:12,240
Perfect.

3046
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:14,220
You can level three or... yeah.

3047
02:29:15,140 --> 02:29:15,540
Okay.

3048
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:16,520
Next time you can level three.

3049
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:17,540
Don't worry, I'll base them.

3050
02:29:18,900 --> 02:29:19,300
Oh.

3051
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:20,400
Okay, don't worry.

3052
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:20,720
Just block.

3053
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:21,220
Just block.

3054
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:25,740
Now you have to block.

3055
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:26,980
So, you're in a bad spot.

3056
02:29:26,980 --> 02:29:27,700
I'm not going to lie.

3057
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:28,080
Yeah.

3058
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:30,700
Um...

3059
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:32,360
Oh, that was good.

3060
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:33,060
You lost a bit of meter.

3061
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:33,400
Perfect.

3062
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:34,440
Now you got to get out of the corner.

3063
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:36,480
Oh my god.

3064
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:38,020
I baited them.

3065
02:29:38,460 --> 02:29:39,440
That was amazing.

3066
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:41,080
Your reactions are godlike.

3067
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:42,080
Is he alive?

3068
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:42,600
No.

3069
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:43,180
Let's go.

3070
02:29:45,940 --> 02:29:46,340
Yeah.

3071
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:50,080
If you see DI and you have level three, you can do that like every time.

3072
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:51,120
If you're...

3073
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:51,340
Oh yeah.

3074
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:53,280
Maybe I'm doubting you too much.

3075
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:53,640
That's...

3076
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:54,360
That's like legit.

3077
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:55,260
Yeah.

3078
02:29:55,260 --> 02:29:55,420
Yeah.

3079
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:56,960
Yeah.

3080
02:29:58,440 --> 02:30:01,120
Because, you know, everyone at this level wants to do DI all the time.

3081
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:05,560
You have like a fucking bomb that you can just throw at them every time they do that.

3082
02:30:09,220 --> 02:30:09,940
Good defense.

3083
02:30:10,300 --> 02:30:10,600
Yes.

3084
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:12,720
They'll give you opportunities to punish when you block it.

3085
02:30:14,020 --> 02:30:14,500
I know.

3086
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:22,240
Oh.

3087
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:23,060
Nice.

3088
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:23,900
That was really good.

3089
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:25,840
Good usage of the down forward circle.

3090
02:30:25,900 --> 02:30:26,520
That's fucking right.

3091
02:30:26,980 --> 02:30:27,340
Yes.

3092
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:27,780
Yeah.

3093
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:28,900
Oh shit.

3094
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:29,140
Sorry.

3095
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:31,200
I mean, you're partying.

3096
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:31,480
I'll shoot you.

3097
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:31,900
I'm just feeling it.

3098
02:30:32,740 --> 02:30:33,500
I felt it.

3099
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:34,300
Now you just play a little defense.

3100
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:35,460
Play a little defense and you're good.

3101
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:36,020
Okay.

3102
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:36,620
Nice block.

3103
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,040
Now you're back in it.

3104
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:39,540
You're back in it.

3105
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:40,520
Oh god.

3106
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:41,220
Keeps doing that thing.

3107
02:30:41,220 --> 02:30:41,580
Drive reversal.

3108
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:43,560
Very good.

3109
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:44,620
Nice.

3110
02:30:44,860 --> 02:30:45,400
One more.

3111
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:46,000
Oh.

3112
02:30:46,480 --> 02:30:46,920
Oh no.

3113
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:47,260
Don't worry.

3114
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:47,620
Don't worry.

3115
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:48,180
Just chill.

3116
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:49,160
And you're good.

3117
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:51,380
Yeah.

3118
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:52,060
Just work your way in.

3119
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:54,920
Nice.

3120
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:54,960
Yay.

3121
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:58,040
Nice.

3122
02:30:58,680 --> 02:30:59,040
Yeah.

3123
02:30:59,120 --> 02:30:59,600
He does that.

3124
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:01,460
Your pacing is so much better now.

3125
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:03,920
Just because you're willing to block every once in a while.

3126
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:06,800
And then you work your way in and then they just die.

3127
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:08,660
I can't believe it.

3128
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:09,840
I learned how to block.

3129
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:11,360
Oh.

3130
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:12,440
Not now though.

3131
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,040
Not.

3132
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:15,460
There you go.

3133
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:15,880
Defense.

3134
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:16,420
Perfect.

3135
02:31:17,580 --> 02:31:18,300
That's fucking right.

3136
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:18,920
Oh shit.

3137
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:19,480
Yeah.

3138
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:19,900
Who says that?

3139
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:20,280
Shit.

3140
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:21,200
He'll do that every once in a while.

3141
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:21,460
So annoying.

3142
02:31:25,460 --> 02:31:25,880
Well.

3143
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:26,660
Empty.

3144
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:28,380
That's fucking right.

3145
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:29,240
You know what that means.

3146
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:31,000
Oh.

3147
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:31,560
Oh.

3148
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:32,240
Yeah.

3149
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:34,420
He's asking for it.

3150
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:35,260
Yeah.

3151
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:35,700
There you go.

3152
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:36,460
That's fucking right.

3153
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:37,420
Oh.

3154
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:38,460
Now I don't have it.

3155
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:39,320
That was my bad.

3156
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:39,800
Yeah.

3157
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:41,600
Maybe regular triangle would have been better there.

3158
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:42,740
Yeah.

3159
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:44,320
But you have your level three.

3160
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:44,900
So.

3161
02:31:46,340 --> 02:31:46,740
Yeah.

3162
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:48,420
When it's time you can bust that out.

3163
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:48,740
Oh.

3164
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:49,000
Okay.

3165
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:49,200
Block.

3166
02:31:49,300 --> 02:31:49,440
Block.

3167
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:49,640
Block.

3168
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:49,840
Block.

3169
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:50,020
Block.

3170
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:51,280
Just block.

3171
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:51,880
Okay.

3172
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:52,740
Now you can level three.

3173
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:53,520
Yes.

3174
02:31:53,740 --> 02:31:54,100
Yay.

3175
02:31:54,160 --> 02:31:55,040
But he's alive.

3176
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:57,320
Was that CA or...

3177
02:31:58,040 --> 02:31:59,160
I always forget his animation.

3178
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,000
He might be dead.

3179
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:01,360
Oh.

3180
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:01,380
Okay.

3181
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:01,640
No.

3182
02:32:01,700 --> 02:32:02,700
I knew he was not dead.

3183
02:32:03,220 --> 02:32:03,580
Okay.

3184
02:32:03,620 --> 02:32:04,160
Do you think he'll...

3185
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:04,860
Yes.

3186
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:05,180
Okay.

3187
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:06,060
Nice.

3188
02:32:08,660 --> 02:32:09,360
Hell yeah.

3189
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:09,820
Yay.

3190
02:32:10,340 --> 02:32:10,700
Yeah.

3191
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:14,260
When you got level three, blocking a move and then mashing level three is too good.

3192
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:18,980
Like you just need a tiny hint of blocking and then mash.

3193
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:19,480
Right?

3194
02:32:19,660 --> 02:32:19,840
Yeah.

3195
02:32:25,250 --> 02:32:26,470
Are you on a win streak right now?

3196
02:32:26,490 --> 02:32:26,990
You're kind of cooking.

3197
02:32:26,990 --> 02:32:27,390
No.

3198
02:32:30,190 --> 02:32:31,790
If I won and done maybe.

3199
02:32:33,350 --> 02:32:33,670
No.

3200
02:32:33,770 --> 02:32:36,630
You got to get the win streak the legit way.

3201
02:32:39,170 --> 02:32:40,190
I thought you got to get it done.

3202
02:32:42,130 --> 02:32:42,450
Okay.

3203
02:32:42,570 --> 02:32:43,810
This guy, he's in bronze.

3204
02:32:44,070 --> 02:32:44,670
He's playing Akuma.

3205
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:45,550
He might be a nut.

3206
02:32:45,810 --> 02:32:46,410
So when...

3207
02:32:47,090 --> 02:32:47,410
Okay.

3208
02:32:47,630 --> 02:32:48,470
They're very aggressive.

3209
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:49,490
So this is going to work.

3210
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:49,990
Oh shit.

3211
02:32:50,090 --> 02:32:50,390
Nevermind.

3212
02:32:50,750 --> 02:32:51,670
That might actually...

3213
02:32:51,670 --> 02:32:51,930
Okay.

3214
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:52,670
It didn't work.

3215
02:32:52,810 --> 02:32:53,290
You get one.

3216
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:54,430
You get one at the start of the game.

3217
02:32:54,670 --> 02:32:55,330
Punish when he lands.

3218
02:32:55,390 --> 02:32:55,710
Yeah.

3219
02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:55,830
I get one.

3220
02:32:55,870 --> 02:32:56,490
I get one.

3221
02:32:56,650 --> 02:32:56,970
This is going to work.

3222
02:32:56,970 --> 02:32:58,850
This guy, block and punish is going to be really good.

3223
02:33:01,330 --> 02:33:02,210
You can mix...

3224
02:33:02,210 --> 02:33:02,390
Yeah.

3225
02:33:04,610 --> 02:33:05,010
Okay.

3226
02:33:05,010 --> 02:33:05,130
Oh, sure.

3227
02:33:06,190 --> 02:33:06,990
Very good.

3228
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:07,690
Picking your spots.

3229
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:11,750
Maybe like a stand heavy.

3230
02:33:11,930 --> 02:33:12,330
Yeah.

3231
02:33:12,430 --> 02:33:14,410
I think stand heavy against this guy will work good too.

3232
02:33:15,330 --> 02:33:15,730
Okay.

3233
02:33:16,870 --> 02:33:17,270
Sorry.

3234
02:33:17,350 --> 02:33:17,790
Stand circle.

3235
02:33:20,330 --> 02:33:21,050
Oh God.

3236
02:33:21,210 --> 02:33:21,690
Oh God.

3237
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:22,890
What's blocked.

3238
02:33:23,430 --> 02:33:24,070
That's fine.

3239
02:33:25,350 --> 02:33:25,750
Okay.

3240
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:26,750
Now you're just going to work your way in.

3241
02:33:26,830 --> 02:33:26,950
Okay.

3242
02:33:26,970 --> 02:33:28,610
And then maybe like a jump X.

3243
02:33:31,530 --> 02:33:32,230
There you go.

3244
02:33:32,250 --> 02:33:32,570
Now block.

3245
02:33:32,650 --> 02:33:32,810
Block.

3246
02:33:32,810 --> 02:33:32,930
Block.

3247
02:33:32,930 --> 02:33:33,130
No.

3248
02:33:33,230 --> 02:33:33,370
No.

3249
02:33:33,410 --> 02:33:33,490
No.

3250
02:33:33,850 --> 02:33:35,670
I pressed the wrong button.

3251
02:33:36,090 --> 02:33:36,490
Yeah.

3252
02:33:38,810 --> 02:33:44,690
It's hard to know to go for command grab after you hit them out of the air like that because it varies.

3253
02:33:44,890 --> 02:33:46,550
Sometimes they get juggled in the air.

3254
02:33:46,610 --> 02:33:47,810
Sometimes they fall down right away.

3255
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:48,550
Yeah.

3256
02:33:48,550 --> 02:33:50,690
You got to kind of wait and see what's happening.

3257
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:53,590
Nice.

3258
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:55,510
No.

3259
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:55,710
Okay.

3260
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:56,950
This guy knows how to do...

3261
02:33:56,970 --> 02:33:57,890
I'm going to drive rush throw.

3262
02:33:58,430 --> 02:33:59,730
So he's smurfing.

3263
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:04,410
Oh shit.

3264
02:34:04,530 --> 02:34:04,790
Okay.

3265
02:34:05,870 --> 02:34:07,970
Oh, I didn't realize my thing was gone.

3266
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:08,650
Oh no.

3267
02:34:08,710 --> 02:34:09,330
He knows now.

3268
02:34:11,870 --> 02:34:12,230
Nice.

3269
02:34:12,610 --> 02:34:12,970
Okay.

3270
02:34:14,390 --> 02:34:14,750
Goodbye.

3271
02:34:14,910 --> 02:34:15,430
Level three.

3272
02:34:15,710 --> 02:34:16,070
No.

3273
02:34:16,170 --> 02:34:16,490
Block.

3274
02:34:16,650 --> 02:34:17,130
Oh, you're dead.

3275
02:34:17,210 --> 02:34:17,370
Yeah.

3276
02:34:17,430 --> 02:34:17,890
Oh, I quit.

3277
02:34:17,930 --> 02:34:18,830
That's kind of what he's doing.

3278
02:34:20,130 --> 02:34:21,170
Let's run it back though.

3279
02:34:21,210 --> 02:34:21,450
Let's see.

3280
02:34:21,470 --> 02:34:21,950
He might run.

3281
02:34:22,070 --> 02:34:22,590
I feel like.

3282
02:34:23,090 --> 02:34:23,450
No.

3283
02:34:23,570 --> 02:34:23,790
Okay.

3284
02:34:23,870 --> 02:34:24,170
Oh no.

3285
02:34:24,170 --> 02:34:24,270
No.

3286
02:34:24,270 --> 02:34:25,310
He wants to fire me.

3287
02:34:25,310 --> 02:34:26,790
Just pick your spots with the jump X.

3288
02:34:26,930 --> 02:34:28,190
And then we got to square him.

3289
02:34:28,290 --> 02:34:28,990
We got to square him.

3290
02:34:30,110 --> 02:34:30,510
Yeah.

3291
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:30,730
Yeah.

3292
02:34:30,770 --> 02:34:31,730
The jump X.

3293
02:34:35,370 --> 02:34:35,770
Oh.

3294
02:34:37,070 --> 02:34:38,010
That's a good idea though.

3295
02:34:39,170 --> 02:34:40,410
The circle is good.

3296
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:42,490
Nice tag.

3297
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:44,430
Down triangle.

3298
02:34:44,510 --> 02:34:44,950
Down triangle.

3299
02:34:45,870 --> 02:34:46,610
Oh no.

3300
02:34:46,730 --> 02:34:48,190
I thought he was going to...

3301
02:34:50,550 --> 02:34:50,950
Nice.

3302
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:51,890
And then squares.

3303
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:54,150
Oh no.

3304
02:34:56,450 --> 02:34:57,170
I'm sorry.

3305
02:34:57,790 --> 02:34:58,810
I'm so sorry.

3306
02:34:59,970 --> 02:35:00,410
Okay.

3307
02:35:00,510 --> 02:35:01,330
You got a chance though.

3308
02:35:06,190 --> 02:35:06,630
Oh.

3309
02:35:09,470 --> 02:35:11,730
He gave you a big chance.

3310
02:35:17,910 --> 02:35:18,350
Snap.

3311
02:35:18,430 --> 02:35:18,870
Snap.

3312
02:35:19,350 --> 02:35:19,790
Nice.

3313
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:21,110
Snap.

3314
02:35:21,110 --> 02:35:21,270
Okay.

3315
02:35:21,270 --> 02:35:21,710
There you go.

3316
02:35:22,210 --> 02:35:22,850
Very good.

3317
02:35:22,910 --> 02:35:23,250
Very good.

3318
02:35:23,770 --> 02:35:24,210
Snap.

3319
02:35:24,370 --> 02:35:25,030
Oh shit.

3320
02:35:25,050 --> 02:35:25,610
No more snap.

3321
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,630
Snap.

3322
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:29,010
Okay.

3323
02:35:29,130 --> 02:35:29,650
Let's block it out.

3324
02:35:29,730 --> 02:35:30,170
Let's block it out.

3325
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:31,850
What if I do this?

3326
02:35:32,330 --> 02:35:32,690
Oh.

3327
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:34,010
I almost got the grab.

3328
02:35:34,410 --> 02:35:35,030
You got to block.

3329
02:35:35,130 --> 02:35:35,490
You got to block.

3330
02:35:36,910 --> 02:35:37,550
There you go.

3331
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:38,210
Very good.

3332
02:35:42,610 --> 02:35:42,970
Oh.

3333
02:35:44,730 --> 02:35:45,090
Nice.

3334
02:35:45,690 --> 02:35:47,250
That was so good.

3335
02:35:47,390 --> 02:35:48,350
That was so good.

3336
02:35:51,070 --> 02:35:51,430
Whoa.

3337
02:35:53,370 --> 02:35:53,730
No.

3338
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:54,610
Oh.

3339
02:35:55,170 --> 02:35:55,890
I had...

3340
02:35:55,890 --> 02:35:56,170
Block.

3341
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:56,330
Block.

3342
02:35:56,330 --> 02:35:56,750
Just block.

3343
02:35:56,890 --> 02:35:57,230
Yes.

3344
02:35:57,390 --> 02:35:57,710
Yes.

3345
02:35:57,730 --> 02:35:58,590
Now punish him with a lance.

3346
02:35:58,970 --> 02:35:59,330
No.

3347
02:35:59,370 --> 02:35:59,550
No.

3348
02:35:59,570 --> 02:36:00,090
You're alive.

3349
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:00,570
Oh no.

3350
02:36:00,650 --> 02:36:00,930
You're dead.

3351
02:36:01,310 --> 02:36:01,630
Okay.

3352
02:36:01,970 --> 02:36:03,010
But you had the right idea.

3353
02:36:03,730 --> 02:36:04,550
That was good.

3354
02:36:04,630 --> 02:36:04,890
That was good.

3355
02:36:06,110 --> 02:36:07,310
But you see what happened, right?

3356
02:36:07,390 --> 02:36:09,630
He was going for the combo and he should have killed you.

3357
02:36:09,770 --> 02:36:11,490
But people fuck up all the time.

3358
02:36:11,710 --> 02:36:14,710
So if you're blocking and they fuck up, you can then kill them.

3359
02:36:15,230 --> 02:36:17,750
So if you got the triangle there, he would have been dead.

3360
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:21,910
So when people start hitting you, don't like give up.

3361
02:36:21,970 --> 02:36:22,730
Don't give up hope.

3362
02:36:22,850 --> 02:36:22,990
Yeah.

3363
02:36:23,430 --> 02:36:24,730
Everyone's fucking up all the time.

3364
02:36:24,810 --> 02:36:29,210
So just hold down back and then they might just give you a chance to kill them and you can win.

3365
02:36:29,210 --> 02:36:31,010
When you should have lost all the time.

3366
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:33,330
It happens at every level, all the time.

3367
02:36:34,210 --> 02:36:34,950
I'm learning.

3368
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:37,990
Yeah.

3369
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:39,070
Like you almost won that game.

3370
02:36:39,370 --> 02:36:40,550
That was actually really close.

3371
02:36:40,650 --> 02:36:41,330
That guy was good though.

3372
02:36:41,410 --> 02:36:42,330
I think he's better than bronze.

3373
02:36:44,430 --> 02:36:45,850
Get out of this elo.

3374
02:36:48,970 --> 02:36:50,350
Smurfing in a video game?

3375
02:36:50,530 --> 02:36:51,210
That's illegal.

3376
02:36:53,110 --> 02:36:53,930
It exists.

3377
02:36:54,270 --> 02:36:54,950
It exists.

3378
02:36:56,730 --> 02:36:57,750
We'll report them.

3379
02:36:57,810 --> 02:36:58,750
That's against TOS.

3380
02:36:58,810 --> 02:36:59,190
Yeah.

3381
02:37:00,510 --> 02:37:01,770
It might actually be.

3382
02:37:02,150 --> 02:37:03,270
I'm pretty sure.

3383
02:37:03,410 --> 02:37:07,470
It's like technically against TOS for every game.

3384
02:37:10,230 --> 02:37:13,270
No one's brave enough to report them, but I will.

3385
02:37:15,350 --> 02:37:17,730
I mean, the problem is you might just be getting your ass beat.

3386
02:37:19,650 --> 02:37:21,810
They're like, wow, this player's a scrub.

3387
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:22,770
They get all your reports.

3388
02:37:22,770 --> 02:37:24,390
Every time I lose, it's a smurf.

3389
02:37:24,470 --> 02:37:25,070
I'm like, damn.

3390
02:37:25,690 --> 02:37:27,050
This person is salty.

3391
02:37:27,130 --> 02:37:27,610
What the hell?

3392
02:37:28,330 --> 02:37:29,190
I don't know.

3393
02:37:32,850 --> 02:37:34,470
Oh, they rejected me?

3394
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:35,490
How dare they?

3395
02:37:35,730 --> 02:37:36,770
I reject you.

3396
02:37:38,270 --> 02:37:39,210
I'd be like that.

3397
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:43,160
Yeah.

3398
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:47,500
The only thing I think you're not doing as much that you could is just using the crouching square.

3399
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:50,560
That's the only thing I think you can mix in at the closer ranges.

3400
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:53,800
Cause, uh, like that's going to be your better.

3401
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:57,240
And when you're doing it, try holding down and back when you do it.

3402
02:37:58,100 --> 02:38:00,760
So down back should be like your home position.

3403
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:02,100
If you're not doing it, you're not going to be able to do it.

3404
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:04,580
If you're not doing anything else, down back is the best way to block.

3405
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:08,560
So you can be holding down back without mashing square, just to block.

3406
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:14,020
And then when they, when they try to walk up to you while holding down back the whole time, then just tap square.

3407
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:20,400
So like you should get used to that then it's like, just tap it to poke them as they approach you.

3408
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:22,920
And so that's a really good defensive option.

3409
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:29,200
And even offense, if you're unsure, like what to pressure them with up close, just do some crouching squares.

3410
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:30,440
Like just tap, tap.

3411
02:38:30,540 --> 02:38:31,540
You don't have to mash it the whole time.

3412
02:38:31,580 --> 02:38:32,080
You can also just tap.

3413
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:32,900
You can just kind of stagger it.

3414
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:35,680
It's a good way to more safely poke them.

3415
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:40,220
And then when you're further away, then go back to your other game plan of the X, the circles.

3416
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:42,400
Yes!

3417
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:43,920
My one worked!

3418
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:44,420
Okay.

3419
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:47,020
I told you!

3420
02:38:47,400 --> 02:38:49,060
You can do it until it doesn't work.

3421
02:38:49,180 --> 02:38:51,520
As soon as one, see two works.

3422
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,440
Do it until it doesn't work.

3423
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:54,420
If it stops working.

3424
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:54,720
Okay.

3425
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:55,280
All right.

3426
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:55,640
It's gone.

3427
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:56,300
It's over.

3428
02:38:57,040 --> 02:38:57,700
It's over.

3429
02:38:58,040 --> 02:38:58,440
Yeehaw.

3430
02:38:58,540 --> 02:38:59,840
Well actually, maybe do one more.

3431
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:00,900
Really?

3432
02:39:02,420 --> 02:39:02,780
Yeah.

3433
02:39:02,860 --> 02:39:03,020
Yeah.

3434
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:03,400
Okay.

3435
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:04,200
Against this player.

3436
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:04,580
Yeah.

3437
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:05,140
You got it.

3438
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:05,580
You got it.

3439
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:05,860
Go ahead.

3440
02:39:06,020 --> 02:39:06,620
Have fun.

3441
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:08,900
I knew it.

3442
02:39:09,140 --> 02:39:10,280
I knew I could do one.

3443
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:10,980
And then good squares.

3444
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:13,820
Those squares were really good.

3445
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:14,980
Knowledge check!

3446
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:19,180
Oh, okay.

3447
02:39:19,260 --> 02:39:19,680
No more.

3448
02:39:20,140 --> 02:39:20,860
She got...

3449
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:22,560
Her knowledge was better now.

3450
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:24,420
I actually don't believe it.

3451
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:25,140
I think you might...

3452
02:39:25,560 --> 02:39:26,640
I could do another one?

3453
02:39:26,780 --> 02:39:27,800
I think it might still work.

3454
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:28,900
I'm not convinced actually.

3455
02:39:29,140 --> 02:39:29,160
Oh my God.

3456
02:39:29,500 --> 02:39:29,860
Okay.

3457
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:30,540
Now I'm convinced.

3458
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:31,020
Now I'm convinced.

3459
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:31,400
Okay.

3460
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:31,680
No.

3461
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:32,220
They got it.

3462
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:33,040
We got to play the game.

3463
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:33,940
Yeah.

3464
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:35,200
I'm lucky.

3465
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:36,900
Sad.

3466
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:40,260
I'm sad.

3467
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:41,980
Oh, what the fuck?

3468
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:42,700
Oh no.

3469
02:39:42,760 --> 02:39:42,800
Yeah.

3470
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:43,940
You were kind of using your meter.

3471
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:45,660
Okay.

3472
02:39:45,660 --> 02:39:46,340
We're going to block it out.

3473
02:39:48,460 --> 02:39:48,820
Okay.

3474
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:51,800
Some squares when they get closer.

3475
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:55,120
Do you know you want to get closer?

3476
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:56,680
That's where I get baited.

3477
02:39:58,440 --> 02:40:00,200
I don't think I'm going to win this match.

3478
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:01,240
I think I might have wasted it.

3479
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:01,440
No, no, no.

3480
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:01,660
No.

3481
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:05,900
I mean, I understand the hesitation to use the meter, but I think you can win this.

3482
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:12,720
Yeah.

3483
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:14,600
It's jump X, then squares.

3484
02:40:15,580 --> 02:40:16,200
Oh no.

3485
02:40:16,580 --> 02:40:17,080
Hold on.

3486
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:17,440
Block it out.

3487
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:17,760
Block it out.

3488
02:40:17,820 --> 02:40:18,000
Block.

3489
02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:18,220
Block.

3490
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:18,360
Block.

3491
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:19,300
Nice.

3492
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:19,920
No.

3493
02:40:23,780 --> 02:40:24,580
My meter.

3494
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:29,040
After you block big moves also, square is the best button to press.

3495
02:40:29,140 --> 02:40:29,380
Right?

3496
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:30,980
Like to take your turn back.

3497
02:40:31,180 --> 02:40:31,540
Yeah.

3498
02:40:31,540 --> 02:40:33,680
So she did like a big bicycle kick thing.

3499
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:35,500
You could have pressed square to take your turn back.

3500
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,040
Holy shit.

3501
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:37,780
She's so slow.

3502
02:40:37,940 --> 02:40:39,980
You're the slowest Cammy I've ever fought.

3503
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:42,140
She's kind of...

3504
02:40:42,140 --> 02:40:42,540
I don't know.

3505
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:43,680
She's kind of beating around the corner.

3506
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:45,740
I don't know.

3507
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:46,600
She might not need speed.

3508
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:49,280
Okay.

3509
02:40:50,060 --> 02:40:50,460
Nice.

3510
02:40:52,940 --> 02:40:53,340
Square.

3511
02:40:53,440 --> 02:40:53,580
Yeah.

3512
02:40:53,620 --> 02:40:53,980
Square there.

3513
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:55,120
Get out of here.

3514
02:40:57,180 --> 02:41:00,400
That was actually a good time to use it because you distracted her so much.

3515
02:41:00,680 --> 02:41:01,820
Oh my God.

3516
02:41:01,880 --> 02:41:02,140
Perfect.

3517
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:02,620
Oh my God.

3518
02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:03,120
Leave.

3519
02:41:04,660 --> 02:41:05,060
Oh.

3520
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:05,660
Fuck.

3521
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:06,720
I guess I'll leave.

3522
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:07,800
Kind of cooked right there.

3523
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:12,560
But you're good.

3524
02:41:12,980 --> 02:41:13,840
You got the health.

3525
02:41:16,280 --> 02:41:16,720
Square.

3526
02:41:16,940 --> 02:41:17,280
Yeah.

3527
02:41:17,320 --> 02:41:17,600
Okay.

3528
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:18,040
Oh wait.

3529
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:19,100
Drive reversal.

3530
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:21,840
Okay.

3531
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:22,920
Oh.

3532
02:41:24,260 --> 02:41:24,700
Oh.

3533
02:41:25,220 --> 02:41:25,660
Okay.

3534
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:26,140
Get out.

3535
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:27,880
Somehow that worked.

3536
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:31,560
That was a good match though.

3537
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:32,340
Please leave.

3538
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:33,340
No.

3539
02:41:34,060 --> 02:41:35,480
You're going to have to learn to beat them all.

3540
02:41:35,480 --> 02:41:36,020
Consistently.

3541
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:39,920
She's such a slow cammy.

3542
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:42,000
Nice.

3543
02:41:48,300 --> 02:41:49,260
There you go.

3544
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:52,380
Okay.

3545
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:53,140
But what if like...

3546
02:41:53,140 --> 02:41:53,360
Okay.

3547
02:41:57,020 --> 02:42:00,140
It would be funny if she still didn't learn.

3548
02:42:00,260 --> 02:42:00,500
Yeah.

3549
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:04,140
Nice.

3550
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:04,720
Nice.

3551
02:42:06,380 --> 02:42:06,980
Nice.

3552
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:09,040
Nice.

3553
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:09,580
Oh my God.

3554
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:10,980
Your circle's at that range.

3555
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:11,320
Nice.

3556
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:11,540
Okay.

3557
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:12,180
Yeah.

3558
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:14,880
But your stand circle will armor through all that.

3559
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:15,080
Okay.

3560
02:42:15,100 --> 02:42:15,320
Block.

3561
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:15,540
Block.

3562
02:42:15,580 --> 02:42:15,740
Block.

3563
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:16,080
No.

3564
02:42:16,100 --> 02:42:16,440
Triangle.

3565
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:17,340
Yes.

3566
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:18,460
Perfect.

3567
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:21,260
See those random supers like that where the screen freezes?

3568
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:22,000
Just block it.

3569
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:22,320
Yeah.

3570
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:23,140
And land triangle.

3571
02:42:31,420 --> 02:42:32,140
Oh my gosh.

3572
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:33,920
You finally did the fucking cannon shit.

3573
02:42:35,820 --> 02:42:36,580
Nice defense.

3574
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:42,640
Nice.

3575
02:42:46,370 --> 02:42:46,850
Cool.

3576
02:42:48,210 --> 02:42:48,690
Nice.

3577
02:42:48,690 --> 02:42:49,170
Nice.

3578
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:52,860
Oh no.

3579
02:42:54,920 --> 02:42:55,340
Okay.

3580
02:42:58,200 --> 02:42:58,940
There you go.

3581
02:42:59,020 --> 02:42:59,840
And then now stand heavy.

3582
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:00,300
Yes.

3583
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:06,340
Nice.

3584
02:43:06,400 --> 02:43:07,000
Level three?

3585
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:07,960
Or that?

3586
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:08,480
Yeah.

3587
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:09,260
Yeehaw.

3588
02:43:09,700 --> 02:43:10,120
Yeah.

3589
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:14,840
One thing to keep in mind, like if you think it's going to kill and you have level three, just spend it.

3590
02:43:14,940 --> 02:43:18,880
Like that way you can close out more games, especially on the final round like that.

3591
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:25,080
Just being a little bit aware of that when you get the DI like that can really help you close out rounds easy.

3592
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:30,680
So, anytime it's going to kill, just do level three like that.

3593
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:31,740
Okay.

3594
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:34,100
Oh, whoa.

3595
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:36,780
Yeah.

3596
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:37,360
That was good.

3597
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:38,340
Yeah.

3598
02:43:43,020 --> 02:43:43,900
They are all running from you now.

3599
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:45,240
Why are you all rejecting me?

3600
02:43:45,380 --> 02:43:46,300
They are running from you now.

3601
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:48,080
Please.

3602
02:43:52,040 --> 02:43:53,520
I have fiber into me.

3603
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:54,640
It's not that bad.

3604
02:43:55,420 --> 02:43:57,800
They know a modern gief waits on the other side.

3605
02:43:58,900 --> 02:43:59,740
They're scared.

3606
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:02,540
Oh no, not another Akuma.

3607
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:08,810
Damn, he's about to be silver three.

3608
02:44:09,030 --> 02:44:10,070
Alright, time to...

3609
02:44:10,730 --> 02:44:12,170
time to prevent the promotion.

3610
02:44:12,430 --> 02:44:13,130
Okay, let's see.

3611
02:44:14,230 --> 02:44:14,970
No way.

3612
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:15,870
Yeah, yeah.

3613
02:44:15,970 --> 02:44:16,910
They're gonna throw fireballs.

3614
02:44:17,390 --> 02:44:18,790
Oh my god, you almost got him.

3615
02:44:21,110 --> 02:44:22,470
There is a way.

3616
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:25,130
You know what, you deserve silver three.

3617
02:44:28,750 --> 02:44:29,150
Nice.

3618
02:44:29,970 --> 02:44:30,890
I knew you were gonna grab.

3619
02:44:30,890 --> 02:44:31,630
Triangle when he lands.

3620
02:44:31,790 --> 02:44:32,610
Okay, that's good enough.

3621
02:44:32,610 --> 02:44:32,830
Oh, okay.

3622
02:44:33,050 --> 02:44:33,710
That's good, that's good.

3623
02:44:36,150 --> 02:44:36,950
Oh, stop.

3624
02:44:40,030 --> 02:44:40,430
Nice.

3625
02:44:41,930 --> 02:44:43,030
Let's get some squares in there.

3626
02:44:47,390 --> 02:44:48,070
Oh god.

3627
02:44:48,830 --> 02:44:52,690
Oh, that was nuts.

3628
02:44:53,630 --> 02:44:54,470
Square, square, square.

3629
02:44:54,570 --> 02:44:54,970
Okay, your turn.

3630
02:44:54,990 --> 02:44:55,250
You're good now.

3631
02:44:55,290 --> 02:44:56,050
Just play the game.

3632
02:44:56,130 --> 02:44:56,690
Oh, no.

3633
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:57,050
Don't worry.

3634
02:44:57,210 --> 02:44:57,750
You're alive.

3635
02:44:57,970 --> 02:44:58,710
He doesn't have these.

3636
02:44:58,790 --> 02:44:59,030
See?

3637
02:45:00,790 --> 02:45:01,470
Good defense.

3638
02:45:02,730 --> 02:45:03,530
Triangle or...

3639
02:45:03,530 --> 02:45:04,130
Oh, yeah.

3640
02:45:04,310 --> 02:45:04,910
Oh, no.

3641
02:45:05,370 --> 02:45:05,810
Okay.

3642
02:45:05,930 --> 02:45:06,770
Don't worry, don't worry.

3643
02:45:06,910 --> 02:45:08,330
This guy, he's scared.

3644
02:45:17,510 --> 02:45:17,950
Nice.

3645
02:45:21,850 --> 02:45:22,290
Stop!

3646
02:45:26,250 --> 02:45:29,290
Okay, you need to use a down forward circle on him.

3647
02:45:29,370 --> 02:45:29,950
The sweep.

3648
02:45:30,890 --> 02:45:31,330
Yeah.

3649
02:45:32,050 --> 02:45:32,710
That one.

3650
02:45:32,750 --> 02:45:34,310
Yeah, he's walking too much.

3651
02:45:34,430 --> 02:45:36,710
If they're walking around too much, just kick their feet.

3652
02:45:39,090 --> 02:45:40,250
Oh, come on.

3653
02:45:42,710 --> 02:45:43,430
I knew it.

3654
02:45:43,570 --> 02:45:45,190
I knew you were gonna fucking grab me.

3655
02:45:45,210 --> 02:45:45,370
Stop!

3656
02:45:47,010 --> 02:45:47,450
Okay.

3657
02:45:48,250 --> 02:45:49,610
He's waiting for you to jump now.

3658
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:51,430
Oh, my god.

3659
02:45:51,430 --> 02:45:51,810
Okay.

3660
02:45:53,370 --> 02:45:54,850
We just gotta sweep him.

3661
02:45:57,030 --> 02:45:57,610
Yeah, yeah.

3662
02:45:57,610 --> 02:45:58,750
That's still the right idea.

3663
02:45:59,590 --> 02:46:00,230
Oh, god.

3664
02:46:00,770 --> 02:46:01,310
Oh, my god.

3665
02:46:01,310 --> 02:46:02,330
Oh, he knows.

3666
02:46:03,250 --> 02:46:04,550
How dare you adapt?

3667
02:46:05,450 --> 02:46:06,010
Yes!

3668
02:46:06,510 --> 02:46:08,030
How dare you adapt to me?

3669
02:46:08,730 --> 02:46:10,870
That was an amazing time to mash.

3670
02:46:12,750 --> 02:46:14,710
That was an amazing time to mash.

3671
02:46:15,930 --> 02:46:16,490
All

3672
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:24,720
right.

3673
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:25,500
You live.

3674
02:46:28,540 --> 02:46:29,100
No.

3675
02:46:29,720 --> 02:46:30,460
Yeah, you...

3676
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:30,840
Oh, my god.

3677
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:32,200
You're just throwing a bunch.

3678
02:46:36,570 --> 02:46:37,130
Okay.

3679
02:46:38,350 --> 02:46:38,910
Triangle?

3680
02:46:39,090 --> 02:46:39,370
Okay.

3681
02:46:39,790 --> 02:46:39,910
Triangle?

3682
02:46:41,050 --> 02:46:41,610
Triangle?

3683
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:42,070
No.

3684
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:42,670
I thought he was...

3685
02:46:42,670 --> 02:46:43,410
That was a bad...

3686
02:46:43,410 --> 02:46:43,690
Nice.

3687
02:46:44,150 --> 02:46:45,130
...read on me.

3688
02:46:45,210 --> 02:46:46,110
I think some circle.

3689
02:46:46,270 --> 02:46:48,430
Like, just some heavies at those ranges would be pretty good.

3690
02:46:48,990 --> 02:46:49,410
Okay.

3691
02:46:51,530 --> 02:46:52,550
There you go.

3692
02:46:53,650 --> 02:46:54,270
Yee-haw.

3693
02:46:56,410 --> 02:46:56,830
Shit.

3694
02:46:56,910 --> 02:46:57,550
He has his crit.

3695
02:46:58,030 --> 02:46:59,210
I'm a bit scared there.

3696
02:47:00,490 --> 02:47:01,110
Oh, no.

3697
02:47:01,250 --> 02:47:02,030
Oh, good idea.

3698
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:08,600
Nice.

3699
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:09,080
Nice.

3700
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:11,160
That was so good.

3701
02:47:11,560 --> 02:47:11,760
Yay!

3702
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:12,480
See?

3703
02:47:12,660 --> 02:47:13,920
The panic button being the square.

3704
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:14,680
That was it.

3705
02:47:14,780 --> 02:47:17,920
Like, if you're getting pressured and you're nervous, the square.

3706
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:18,840
That was so good.

3707
02:47:18,940 --> 02:47:19,080
Okay.

3708
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:26,100
We got to get a punish on that.

3709
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:30,020
He is giving you...

3710
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:32,140
He's handing you his life when he does that.

3711
02:47:32,360 --> 02:47:33,220
What do I do?

3712
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:35,720
I guess triangle, but you're kind of far away.

3713
02:47:35,900 --> 02:47:37,020
But at least X.

3714
02:47:37,100 --> 02:47:37,700
Like, the chop.

3715
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:38,500
At least X.

3716
02:47:41,900 --> 02:47:42,340
Nice.

3717
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:42,680
Nice.

3718
02:47:44,620 --> 02:47:45,360
Oh, shit.

3719
02:47:45,700 --> 02:47:46,140
Oh, my god.

3720
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:46,340
That's fine.

3721
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:47,040
Oh, shit.

3722
02:47:47,060 --> 02:47:47,280
Okay.

3723
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:47,880
You can have it.

3724
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:48,440
Okay.

3725
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:49,460
Let's block it out.

3726
02:47:54,470 --> 02:47:54,830
No.

3727
02:47:55,470 --> 02:47:57,650
I wanted to do something pointy.

3728
02:47:57,950 --> 02:47:58,310
Triangle.

3729
02:47:58,470 --> 02:47:58,830
Snap.

3730
02:47:58,830 --> 02:47:59,130
Snap.

3731
02:47:59,170 --> 02:47:59,230
Snap.

3732
02:47:59,230 --> 02:47:59,570
At least...

3733
02:47:59,570 --> 02:48:00,050
Yeah.

3734
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:00,350
Perfect.

3735
02:48:00,530 --> 02:48:01,290
At least there's something.

3736
02:48:01,870 --> 02:48:02,230
Okay.

3737
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:12,720
No.

3738
02:48:13,220 --> 02:48:13,580
Stop.

3739
02:48:13,580 --> 02:48:14,180
That was good.

3740
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:14,600
That was good.

3741
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:25,320
Fuck you.

3742
02:48:25,320 --> 02:48:25,600
Okay.

3743
02:48:25,620 --> 02:48:26,040
Block it out.

3744
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:26,440
Block it out.

3745
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:26,880
And then...

3746
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:27,400
Yeah.

3747
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:27,600
Yeah.

3748
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:28,060
Block it out.

3749
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:29,000
Walk back.

3750
02:48:29,060 --> 02:48:30,900
And then reset when he starts spamming that.

3751
02:48:31,380 --> 02:48:31,740
Okay.

3752
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:34,940
I was trying to grab him, but he grabbed me back.

3753
02:48:35,980 --> 02:48:36,380
Loser.

3754
02:48:38,780 --> 02:48:39,180
Nice.

3755
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:39,780
Such a loser.

3756
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:43,080
Fair...

3757
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:44,280
He got lucky.

3758
02:48:44,320 --> 02:48:44,720
He got lucky.

3759
02:48:44,820 --> 02:48:45,380
That was bullshit.

3760
02:48:45,900 --> 02:48:46,300
Okay.

3761
02:48:49,220 --> 02:48:49,620
Okay.

3762
02:48:49,620 --> 02:48:49,920
Yeah.

3763
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:52,300
That forward heavy kick, what's a ban in that?

3764
02:48:52,360 --> 02:48:53,360
He's dealing with that really well.

3765
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:54,680
Oh, my god.

3766
02:48:54,700 --> 02:48:54,960
Nice.

3767
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:56,000
Yeah.

3768
02:48:56,020 --> 02:48:58,060
So instead of the forward heavy kick, we can just do...

3769
02:48:58,060 --> 02:48:58,280
Sorry.

3770
02:48:58,340 --> 02:49:01,460
Instead of forward circle, we can do stand circle or down forward circle.

3771
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:01,720
Oh, my god.

3772
02:49:01,720 --> 02:49:03,320
The big punch or the big sweep.

3773
02:49:03,460 --> 02:49:04,540
Let's not do the bicycle kick.

3774
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:08,380
He knows.

3775
02:49:09,940 --> 02:49:10,380
Nice.

3776
02:49:12,420 --> 02:49:14,340
Let's get some squares when he gets closer.

3777
02:49:15,220 --> 02:49:15,660
Okay.

3778
02:49:15,860 --> 02:49:16,620
It's okay.

3779
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:18,760
I don't know why that worked, but it worked.

3780
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:19,640
I don't know either.

3781
02:49:21,580 --> 02:49:22,860
That shouldn't have worked.

3782
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:23,220
Okay.

3783
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:24,520
But he was not going to jump now.

3784
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:25,460
Oh, fuck.

3785
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:28,980
That will work up closer.

3786
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:31,700
Like, if you get close to him, he's going to jump.

3787
02:49:31,700 --> 02:49:34,300
If you get close to him and do a couple of squares and then do it, it will work better.

3788
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:36,120
But from far away, he's ready.

3789
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:37,260
There you go.

3790
02:49:37,300 --> 02:49:38,220
You can get close to him and do it.

3791
02:49:39,040 --> 02:49:39,360
Okay.

3792
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:40,580
Yeah.

3793
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:41,060
Let's block it out.

3794
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:43,080
Nice.

3795
02:49:43,160 --> 02:49:43,400
Nice.

3796
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:43,680
Nice.

3797
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:44,080
Exactly.

3798
02:49:44,380 --> 02:49:44,920
Nice defense.

3799
02:49:47,180 --> 02:49:47,500
Oh.

3800
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:47,760
Oh.

3801
02:49:48,020 --> 02:49:48,940
I love the idea.

3802
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:49,920
I love the idea, though.

3803
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:54,020
Perfect.

3804
02:49:54,600 --> 02:49:54,920
Okay.

3805
02:49:54,920 --> 02:49:55,140
Oh.

3806
02:49:55,660 --> 02:49:56,680
We got to have a combo there.

3807
02:49:56,780 --> 02:49:57,380
We got to work on that.

3808
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:57,600
Yeah.

3809
02:49:58,600 --> 02:49:58,920
Okay.

3810
02:49:59,040 --> 02:49:59,700
Block it out.

3811
02:49:59,720 --> 02:50:00,160
Block it out.

3812
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:01,240
Okay.

3813
02:50:02,740 --> 02:50:03,060
Oh.

3814
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:03,480
Oh, no.

3815
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:05,560
He sure won't get to see me.

3816
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:09,420
What the hell?

3817
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:10,140
I hate you.

3818
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:10,880
No, no.

3819
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:11,200
You're playing good.

3820
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:12,280
Oh, my God.

3821
02:50:12,380 --> 02:50:13,460
That was footsies.

3822
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:16,300
That was footsies.

3823
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:19,640
You found the perfect spacing and you whip punish him.

3824
02:50:21,440 --> 02:50:22,520
That was actually amazing.

3825
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:23,660
That was actually amazing.

3826
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:24,740
Yay.

3827
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:25,300
Yeah.

3828
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:27,080
You saw the perfect range to use that.

3829
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:27,320
Okay.

3830
02:50:27,360 --> 02:50:28,140
Let's practice something.

3831
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:29,380
Let's go to the corner.

3832
02:50:30,560 --> 02:50:31,300
All right.

3833
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:31,880
Okay.

3834
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:32,720
Yeah.

3835
02:50:33,160 --> 02:50:33,960
So, you can hold...

3836
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:35,620
You know the reset button, right?

3837
02:50:35,920 --> 02:50:37,640
To reset the training mode?

3838
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:40,060
To reset the training mode?

3839
02:50:40,400 --> 02:50:40,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3840
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:43,260
So, hold to the right and press that.

3841
02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:45,360
Oh, what?

3842
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:46,980
Just hold right and then press that reset button.

3843
02:50:48,140 --> 02:50:48,880
Oh, shit.

3844
02:50:49,060 --> 02:50:49,160
What the fuck?

3845
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:50,120
Hold right instead.

3846
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:51,300
Oh, right.

3847
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:51,640
Sorry.

3848
02:50:51,720 --> 02:50:52,360
I don't know my directions.

3849
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:53,260
There you go.

3850
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:57,080
I was giving you a second chance there, but yeah.

3851
02:50:57,140 --> 02:50:57,280
Okay.

3852
02:50:58,020 --> 02:50:59,840
Now, let's pause the training mode.

3853
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:00,420
I felt the 50-50.

3854
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:02,280
That's true.

3855
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:02,620
That's true.

3856
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:03,140
That's true.

3857
02:51:03,140 --> 02:51:04,940
Now, let's go to dummy settings.

3858
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:05,960
Okay.

3859
02:51:07,060 --> 02:51:09,040
And see how it says always punish counter?

3860
02:51:10,060 --> 02:51:10,580
Oh, yeah.

3861
02:51:10,880 --> 02:51:12,000
Let's change that to normal.

3862
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:13,280
Normal.

3863
02:51:13,620 --> 02:51:14,060
Or standard.

3864
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:14,400
Standard?

3865
02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:14,960
Yeah, yeah.

3866
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:15,180
Okay.

3867
02:51:15,400 --> 02:51:16,520
And now, let's do DI.

3868
02:51:19,180 --> 02:51:21,120
So, you see here when it hits the wall like that?

3869
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:21,420
Yeah.

3870
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:21,920
When you're doing the corner.

3871
02:51:22,040 --> 02:51:26,840
So, if you don't get the big slowdown and it hits the wall like that, you can't do your command grab.

3872
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:27,700
Yeah.

3873
02:51:27,740 --> 02:51:28,500
The triangle.

3874
02:51:28,580 --> 02:51:31,920
And I saw you hesitating when that happened against the Kumisu.

3875
02:51:31,960 --> 02:51:33,120
You recognize that you can't do command grab.

3876
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:33,700
You can't do command grab there.

3877
02:51:33,800 --> 02:51:34,220
Yeah.

3878
02:51:34,220 --> 02:51:39,700
What you can do instead to keep it as easy as possible is just down triangle, the Lariat.

3879
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:42,000
Like, that's the...

3880
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:42,420
Oops.

3881
02:51:42,460 --> 02:51:42,940
Sorry.

3882
02:51:43,020 --> 02:51:43,480
That's weird.

3883
02:51:44,860 --> 02:51:45,340
Yeah.

3884
02:51:45,340 --> 02:51:45,720
That's the...

3885
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:45,800
Look down.

3886
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:45,960
Okay.

3887
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:47,440
That's the easiest thing you can do.

3888
02:51:48,200 --> 02:51:54,440
The slightly better version, if you're comfortable doing it, would be down forward and X.

3889
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:56,540
Forward, X.

3890
02:51:56,540 --> 02:51:56,620
Okay.

3891
02:51:56,620 --> 02:51:57,440
Like, hold down forward.

3892
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:00,760
And then do tap X.

3893
02:52:00,880 --> 02:52:02,580
And then while also holding down forward.

3894
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:03,540
Forward, then tap triangle.

3895
02:52:03,900 --> 02:52:07,340
So you're going to get that medium and it's going to cancel into the Lariat.

3896
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:08,680
Oh, okay.

3897
02:52:10,940 --> 02:52:11,600
Oh, shit.

3898
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:18,940
So you got to do one X and then one triangle.

3899
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:21,060
And then it's going to be the rhythm.

3900
02:52:21,140 --> 02:52:22,000
It's going to be like bum bum.

3901
02:52:22,140 --> 02:52:23,120
Like X triangle.

3902
02:52:23,660 --> 02:52:24,940
All while holding down forward.

3903
02:52:25,480 --> 02:52:25,920
Perfect.

3904
02:52:25,980 --> 02:52:26,160
Okay.

3905
02:52:26,320 --> 02:52:28,100
You just did a special cancel.

3906
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:29,900
You canceled your normal.

3907
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:31,540
That medium punch.

3908
02:52:32,780 --> 02:52:33,500
Into Lariat.

3909
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:34,680
And there you go.

3910
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:34,880
Okay.

3911
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:35,380
You got a combo.

3912
02:52:37,740 --> 02:52:41,940
So if you're walking, like say you're walking left and right and then do a random DI.

3913
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:42,960
Yeah.

3914
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:48,780
Try to move around a little bit just to get a feel for it and then get into that position and then try to do that combo.

3915
02:52:50,660 --> 02:52:51,260
There you go.

3916
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:52,640
That's what you do.

3917
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:52,900
Yay!

3918
02:52:53,580 --> 02:52:54,540
That's what you do at the wall.

3919
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:55,860
Oh my God.

3920
02:52:55,860 --> 02:52:57,760
If you get the slow down, you do command grab.

3921
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:58,240
I'm learning.

3922
02:52:58,240 --> 02:53:00,700
If it doesn't do the slow down, they bounce into the wall.

3923
02:53:01,160 --> 02:53:01,520
That's what you do.

3924
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:01,700
Yeah.

3925
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:01,940
Just do that.

3926
02:53:04,820 --> 02:53:05,220
Beautiful.

3927
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:06,040
You got it.

3928
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:06,480
Yay!

3929
02:53:07,320 --> 02:53:07,800
All right.

3930
02:53:07,800 --> 02:53:07,860
Yeah.

3931
02:53:07,880 --> 02:53:08,340
That's a combo.

3932
02:53:08,500 --> 02:53:08,820
I'm ready.

3933
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:09,340
Oh yeah.

3934
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:10,020
Yeah.

3935
02:53:10,140 --> 02:53:11,620
Because you could have killed that Akuma off.

3936
02:53:11,700 --> 02:53:11,720
My first combo.

3937
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:13,160
A few times with that.

3938
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:13,600
Perfect.

3939
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:16,060
All right.

3940
02:53:16,140 --> 02:53:16,240
Let's go.

3941
02:53:16,380 --> 02:53:18,500
I'll do one more rank game and then we'll call it.

3942
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:19,560
Sounds good.

3943
02:53:19,660 --> 02:53:20,200
Take a break.

3944
02:53:20,540 --> 02:53:20,940
No.

3945
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:22,540
This has been awesome.

3946
02:53:22,760 --> 02:53:23,960
You've made a lot of progress.

3947
02:53:25,380 --> 02:53:26,160
Oh my God.

3948
02:53:26,200 --> 02:53:27,000
I'm doing it.

3949
02:53:28,460 --> 02:53:29,220
I'm learning.

3950
02:53:29,900 --> 02:53:30,300
I'm learning.

3951
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:30,460
I'm learning.

3952
02:53:31,100 --> 02:53:31,500
I'm learning.

3953
02:53:32,580 --> 02:53:33,200
It's okay.

3954
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:36,680
If I fuck up round robin one, I still have round robin two.

3955
02:53:37,240 --> 02:53:37,680
Yeah.

3956
02:53:38,480 --> 02:53:41,360
I think the thing is the first one is just not as important.

3957
02:53:41,780 --> 02:53:42,220
Yeah.

3958
02:53:42,300 --> 02:53:42,580
Yeah.

3959
02:53:42,660 --> 02:53:42,860
Yeah.

3960
02:53:42,860 --> 02:53:43,740
We all get a chance to feel it out.

3961
02:53:43,740 --> 02:53:45,040
So I can sandbag technically.

3962
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:48,960
So if I sandbag, they'll not train for me.

3963
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:52,140
We can just claim it's sandbagging.

3964
02:53:52,140 --> 02:53:58,880
See, let's keep that secret, keep that inside and then just say, yeah, I was totally sandbagging.

3965
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:00,680
That's why they beat me so badly.

3966
02:54:00,920 --> 02:54:01,000
Yeah.

3967
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:02,440
Exactly.

3968
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:02,840
Yeah.

3969
02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:03,220
Yeah.

3970
02:54:03,220 --> 02:54:03,960
Like I did.

3971
02:54:05,020 --> 02:54:05,460
Yeah.

3972
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:06,400
For sure.

3973
02:54:06,500 --> 02:54:07,620
My coach told me to.

3974
02:54:08,060 --> 02:54:09,620
We don't have to say that far.

3975
02:54:09,740 --> 02:54:14,660
We can just say you had a surprise strategy that you told nobody about and lied to your coach about.

3976
02:54:15,140 --> 02:54:15,580
Yeah.

3977
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:17,700
Exactly.

3978
02:54:17,980 --> 02:54:18,820
Oh, shit.

3979
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:19,120
Whoops.

3980
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:21,020
I'm not paying attention.

3981
02:54:22,320 --> 02:54:22,700
Nice.

3982
02:54:24,240 --> 02:54:25,120
That's not what I wanted.

3983
02:54:25,740 --> 02:54:26,600
Oh, perfect.

3984
02:54:26,620 --> 02:54:27,760
This is what I wanted to do.

3985
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:28,440
Yeah.

3986
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:29,940
There you go.

3987
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:30,200
Easy.

3988
02:54:30,940 --> 02:54:31,480
It's because I'm a pro.

3989
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:32,220
Coming second nature.

3990
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:37,960
Oh, my God.

3991
02:54:38,060 --> 02:54:38,360
Free.

3992
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:40,760
Let's get predicted, bitch.

3993
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:45,920
Oh, my God.

3994
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:47,740
No, bitch.

3995
02:54:47,740 --> 02:54:48,800
You fuck it.

3996
02:54:49,180 --> 02:54:50,620
You don't deserve that.

3997
02:54:52,020 --> 02:54:52,960
They kind of do.

3998
02:54:53,960 --> 02:54:56,080
They kind of reacted really well.

3999
02:54:57,940 --> 02:54:58,380
They did not deserve it.

4000
02:54:58,380 --> 02:54:58,960
I'm going to slap you.

4001
02:54:59,040 --> 02:54:59,820
Get over here.

4002
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:00,680
I'm going to fucking slap you.

4003
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:02,380
The slap is great.

4004
02:55:02,480 --> 02:55:02,620
Yeah.

4005
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:03,240
The slap is a really good slap.

4006
02:55:03,240 --> 02:55:04,080
Really good move at that range.

4007
02:55:05,080 --> 02:55:06,120
Get out of here.

4008
02:55:07,220 --> 02:55:08,160
That's fucking right.

4009
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:08,700
Oh, shit.

4010
02:55:08,740 --> 02:55:08,960
What?

4011
02:55:09,320 --> 02:55:09,920
Two plus.

4012
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:10,420
But block.

4013
02:55:10,620 --> 02:55:10,940
Triangle.

4014
02:55:10,980 --> 02:55:11,200
Triangle.

4015
02:55:11,300 --> 02:55:11,560
Oh.

4016
02:55:12,140 --> 02:55:12,460
Yeah.

4017
02:55:12,520 --> 02:55:12,900
That's the idea.

4018
02:55:13,020 --> 02:55:14,680
When you block a super, just get the triangle.

4019
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:16,160
Oh.

4020
02:55:16,300 --> 02:55:16,520
No.

4021
02:55:16,580 --> 02:55:16,900
Almost.

4022
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:17,360
Almost.

4023
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:17,660
No.

4024
02:55:18,540 --> 02:55:18,860
No.

4025
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:19,960
It's okay.

4026
02:55:20,040 --> 02:55:20,920
You tried it, though.

4027
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:22,380
It's okay.

4028
02:55:22,520 --> 02:55:22,880
That was good.

4029
02:55:25,220 --> 02:55:25,540
Okay.

4030
02:55:25,660 --> 02:55:26,640
Just got to work your way in.

4031
02:55:29,320 --> 02:55:29,640
No.

4032
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:30,080
No.

4033
02:55:30,740 --> 02:55:31,160
He saw weakness.

4034
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:32,580
Let's just do some slaps.

4035
02:55:32,580 --> 02:55:34,420
Let's do some smaller buttons in this scenario.

4036
02:55:35,140 --> 02:55:35,500
No.

4037
02:55:36,100 --> 02:55:36,460
That's okay.

4038
02:55:37,140 --> 02:55:38,260
He got me.

4039
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:42,320
He understood the homework.

4040
02:55:44,740 --> 02:55:45,100
Nice.

4041
02:55:45,140 --> 02:55:46,280
That was tricky.

4042
02:55:46,420 --> 02:55:47,500
That was a good time to use that.

4043
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:48,440
Up close like that.

4044
02:55:53,670 --> 02:55:54,290
Oh, shit.

4045
02:55:55,030 --> 02:55:55,610
It's all right.

4046
02:55:55,610 --> 02:55:56,790
You deserve it more clearly.

4047
02:55:57,090 --> 02:55:57,150
That's cool.

4048
02:55:57,470 --> 02:55:57,830
Triangle.

4049
02:55:57,850 --> 02:55:58,210
No.

4050
02:55:58,490 --> 02:55:58,850
Okay.

4051
02:55:59,490 --> 02:56:00,270
Let's block it out.

4052
02:56:00,270 --> 02:56:00,890
Let's block it out a little.

4053
02:56:00,990 --> 02:56:01,830
Let's block it out a little.

4054
02:56:01,990 --> 02:56:02,610
That's okay.

4055
02:56:02,770 --> 02:56:03,130
Lariat.

4056
02:56:05,570 --> 02:56:06,570
He knows now.

4057
02:56:06,730 --> 02:56:06,870
Okay.

4058
02:56:06,870 --> 02:56:07,010
Block.

4059
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:07,250
Block.

4060
02:56:07,290 --> 02:56:07,410
Block.

4061
02:56:07,590 --> 02:56:07,970
Triangle.

4062
02:56:08,210 --> 02:56:09,130
Oh, you're too far.

4063
02:56:09,310 --> 02:56:09,690
Yeah.

4064
02:56:09,790 --> 02:56:10,950
I think I'm too far.

4065
02:56:13,170 --> 02:56:13,930
Oh, okay.

4066
02:56:14,030 --> 02:56:14,290
He grabbed you.

4067
02:56:14,330 --> 02:56:14,890
You deserve it.

4068
02:56:15,010 --> 02:56:15,750
You deserve it.

4069
02:56:16,430 --> 02:56:16,810
No.

4070
02:56:16,930 --> 02:56:17,430
Hold on.

4071
02:56:17,470 --> 02:56:19,250
You still have level three.

4072
02:56:21,530 --> 02:56:21,910
What?

4073
02:56:24,890 --> 02:56:25,270
Okay.

4074
02:56:25,350 --> 02:56:26,870
I guess he deserves that.

4075
02:56:26,870 --> 02:56:31,030
There was just a moment when he was going super ham and you were getting counter hit.

4076
02:56:31,170 --> 02:56:31,470
Yeah.

4077
02:56:31,490 --> 02:56:31,550
Yeah.

4078
02:56:31,550 --> 02:56:33,270
You threw away too much health there.

4079
02:56:33,750 --> 02:56:34,990
But you're playing good otherwise.

4080
02:56:39,950 --> 02:56:40,490
Oh, no.

4081
02:56:40,710 --> 02:56:41,010
Yeah.

4082
02:56:41,050 --> 02:56:43,010
When you hit them out of the air, just let them land.

4083
02:56:43,190 --> 02:56:44,990
Every time you try to do something there, it doesn't work.

4084
02:56:45,050 --> 02:56:45,190
Yeah.

4085
02:56:45,250 --> 02:56:45,610
Perfect.

4086
02:56:46,050 --> 02:56:46,410
Oh.

4087
02:56:47,690 --> 02:56:48,750
He grabbed me.

4088
02:56:48,810 --> 02:56:49,490
That's fucking right.

4089
02:56:49,550 --> 02:56:50,070
I saw that.

4090
02:56:50,530 --> 02:56:51,350
I saw that.

4091
02:56:51,770 --> 02:56:52,650
That's fucking right.

4092
02:56:52,790 --> 02:56:53,170
I saw that.

4093
02:56:53,170 --> 02:56:53,610
There we go.

4094
02:56:56,150 --> 02:56:56,770
Oh, no.

4095
02:56:58,030 --> 02:56:58,390
Nice.

4096
02:56:58,490 --> 02:56:58,970
Use your...

4097
02:56:59,670 --> 02:57:00,030
Nice.

4098
02:57:00,030 --> 02:57:00,510
Use your...

4099
02:57:01,550 --> 02:57:01,910
Oh.

4100
02:57:02,330 --> 02:57:02,630
Oops.

4101
02:57:03,090 --> 02:57:03,610
It's cool.

4102
02:57:03,710 --> 02:57:03,910
It's cool.

4103
02:57:03,930 --> 02:57:04,490
Just block it out.

4104
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:05,390
Oh, no.

4105
02:57:06,690 --> 02:57:07,150
Nice.

4106
02:57:08,810 --> 02:57:09,270
Sweet.

4107
02:57:09,390 --> 02:57:09,710
There you go.

4108
02:57:16,950 --> 02:57:17,410
Oh.

4109
02:57:17,670 --> 02:57:19,030
I was trying to press R1.

4110
02:57:21,270 --> 02:57:22,710
Bro, please leave me alone.

4111
02:57:24,750 --> 02:57:25,210
What?

4112
02:57:25,750 --> 02:57:26,930
That's his command grab.

4113
02:57:27,170 --> 02:57:27,330
Yeah.

4114
02:57:27,390 --> 02:57:28,230
You have to jump that.

4115
02:57:28,410 --> 02:57:29,310
It's tricky.

4116
02:57:29,510 --> 02:57:29,730
Oh, my god.

4117
02:57:30,050 --> 02:57:30,930
He teleports at you.

4118
02:57:33,850 --> 02:57:34,310
Nice.

4119
02:57:35,050 --> 02:57:35,790
Very good.

4120
02:57:37,430 --> 02:57:37,890
Nice.

4121
02:57:39,390 --> 02:57:41,310
Oh, no.

4122
02:57:43,890 --> 02:57:44,250
Wait.

4123
02:57:48,320 --> 02:57:49,120
Did I get that?

4124
02:57:49,280 --> 02:57:49,620
Yeah.

4125
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:50,140
No.

4126
02:57:50,140 --> 02:57:50,600
Oh, no.

4127
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:51,660
Just hold down back here.

4128
02:57:51,720 --> 02:57:52,100
Just block.

4129
02:57:52,160 --> 02:57:52,760
He might mess up.

4130
02:57:53,180 --> 02:57:53,760
Or not.

4131
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:54,140
Okay.

4132
02:57:54,620 --> 02:57:54,980
Okay.

4133
02:57:54,980 --> 02:57:55,660
He messed up.

4134
02:58:06,790 --> 02:58:07,150
Nice.

4135
02:58:07,530 --> 02:58:08,030
Nice defense.

4136
02:58:08,210 --> 02:58:08,510
No.

4137
02:58:08,990 --> 02:58:09,450
It's cool.

4138
02:58:09,530 --> 02:58:09,710
It's cool.

4139
02:58:10,390 --> 02:58:10,750
See...

4140
02:58:10,750 --> 02:58:11,030
No.

4141
02:58:11,570 --> 02:58:13,830
He did the heavy kick and you were mashing again.

4142
02:58:13,890 --> 02:58:14,810
So, you got hit after.

4143
02:58:14,930 --> 02:58:15,810
But if you had blocked...

4144
02:58:15,810 --> 02:58:16,130
Really?

4145
02:58:16,430 --> 02:58:17,570
Oh, I didn't realize I was mashing.

4146
02:58:17,570 --> 02:58:17,630
Yeah.

4147
02:58:18,290 --> 02:58:18,690
Nice.

4148
02:58:20,150 --> 02:58:22,790
We just gotta fight that impulse a little bit here and there.

4149
02:58:23,610 --> 02:58:24,650
I can't help it.

4150
02:58:25,250 --> 02:58:25,650
Yes.

4151
02:58:25,650 --> 02:58:26,190
It's not easy.

4152
02:58:26,330 --> 02:58:26,610
I understand.

4153
02:58:27,030 --> 02:58:27,430
See?

4154
02:58:27,490 --> 02:58:28,090
Same thing again.

4155
02:58:28,210 --> 02:58:28,450
Yeah.

4156
02:58:32,190 --> 02:58:32,590
Nice.

4157
02:58:32,930 --> 02:58:33,630
Really good.

4158
02:58:33,830 --> 02:58:35,270
And now you have the life lead, right?

4159
02:58:35,370 --> 02:58:35,690
Bro, why are you so...

4160
02:58:35,690 --> 02:58:36,950
Why are you so defensive?

4161
02:58:37,310 --> 02:58:37,670
Yeah.

4162
02:58:38,970 --> 02:58:40,210
When he does that, you want to jump.

4163
02:58:42,750 --> 02:58:43,150
Okay.

4164
02:58:47,970 --> 02:58:48,370
Oh.

4165
02:58:48,770 --> 02:58:49,170
No.

4166
02:58:49,750 --> 02:58:50,150
No.

4167
02:58:50,170 --> 02:58:50,630
Okay.

4168
02:58:51,730 --> 02:58:52,130
Nice.

4169
02:58:52,210 --> 02:58:52,490
Yeehaw.

4170
02:58:53,610 --> 02:58:56,150
Next time, if you get a DI, we're gonna level three.

4171
02:58:58,770 --> 02:59:01,130
Just... but you don't have to worry about it.

4172
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:01,790
Just play the game normal.

4173
02:59:03,570 --> 02:59:04,210
Did you see?

4174
02:59:04,750 --> 02:59:05,310
Oh my god!

4175
02:59:05,310 --> 02:59:05,670
Did you hear that?

4176
02:59:06,170 --> 02:59:06,290
No.

4177
02:59:06,470 --> 02:59:06,550
No.

4178
02:59:06,550 --> 02:59:06,890
It's okay.

4179
02:59:07,190 --> 02:59:08,030
Yes, you did.

4180
02:59:08,570 --> 02:59:08,910
I was like...

4181
02:59:08,910 --> 02:59:10,050
I was like, he's crouched.

4182
02:59:12,110 --> 02:59:12,510
Listen.

4183
02:59:12,830 --> 02:59:12,950
Yeah.

4184
02:59:12,990 --> 02:59:13,550
If you can...

4185
02:59:13,550 --> 02:59:17,570
If you are ready, you can react to anything in the game with that level three.

4186
02:59:17,670 --> 02:59:18,610
Like, that is...

4187
02:59:19,410 --> 02:59:20,250
Really scary.

4188
02:59:20,950 --> 02:59:21,530
All right.

4189
02:59:21,630 --> 02:59:22,110
Oh my god.

4190
02:59:22,110 --> 02:59:22,850
I broke his win streak.

4191
02:59:22,910 --> 02:59:23,310
I'm happy.

4192
02:59:23,430 --> 02:59:23,910
What the hell?

4193
02:59:24,050 --> 02:59:27,790
I'm happy to break somebody's win streak and end it with that.

4194
02:59:27,950 --> 02:59:27,990
Thank you.

4195
02:59:28,010 --> 02:59:28,510
We gotta...

4196
02:59:30,030 --> 02:59:31,150
We gotta work on this.

4197
02:59:31,150 --> 02:59:32,510
I don't even want it done!

4198
02:59:32,930 --> 02:59:33,730
I gave him too many!

4199
02:59:33,730 --> 02:59:34,590
That's exactly...

4200
02:59:34,590 --> 02:59:36,230
That is the textbook one and done.

4201
02:59:36,350 --> 02:59:42,410
You lose the first one, you hit him with the raw level three to steal the second one, and then you run away.

4202
02:59:42,530 --> 02:59:44,650
That is worse than losing after the first win.

4203
02:59:45,950 --> 02:59:46,950
That guy's gonna...

4204
02:59:46,950 --> 02:59:48,470
He's gonna train up.

4205
02:59:48,470 --> 02:59:49,470
He's gonna find you.

4206
02:59:49,550 --> 02:59:49,950
He's gonna remember me.

4207
02:59:51,350 --> 02:59:52,430
That's all I wanted.

4208
02:59:52,430 --> 02:59:54,310
He's gonna find you and demand the set.

4209
02:59:55,610 --> 02:59:57,290
He's gonna remember me.

4210
02:59:57,510 --> 02:59:57,910
Yes.

4211
02:59:59,490 --> 02:59:59,890
Absolutely.

4212
03:00:00,630 --> 03:00:01,090
Oh, yes.

4213
03:00:01,450 --> 03:00:01,730
All right.

4214
03:00:02,510 --> 03:00:02,910
GG's.

4215
03:00:02,910 --> 03:00:04,710
Thank you for the coaching session.

4216
03:00:04,750 --> 03:00:04,850
GG's.

4217
03:00:04,850 --> 03:00:05,470
No, that was awesome.

4218
03:00:05,590 --> 03:00:05,810
Yeah.

4219
03:00:05,930 --> 03:00:06,410
That was...

4220
03:00:06,410 --> 03:00:08,150
I finally learned how to block.

4221
03:00:08,170 --> 03:00:09,970
I fucking did it.

4222
03:00:10,110 --> 03:00:10,470
Right.

4223
03:00:11,090 --> 03:00:12,690
And you see the value of it, right?

4224
03:00:12,790 --> 03:00:14,830
It wasn't just me telling you to block and you getting mauled.

4225
03:00:14,910 --> 03:00:17,270
You saw how you blocked and it gave you wins, right?

4226
03:00:17,270 --> 03:00:17,910
There's a direct...

4227
03:00:17,910 --> 03:00:18,510
Yay!

4228
03:00:18,570 --> 03:00:19,230
...correlation there.

4229
03:00:19,310 --> 03:00:20,230
So that's awesome to see.

4230
03:00:20,910 --> 03:00:21,350
So...

4231
03:00:21,970 --> 03:00:22,670
Sounds good.

4232
03:00:22,730 --> 03:00:22,870
Yeah.

4233
03:00:22,870 --> 03:00:23,470
Take a good break.

4234
03:00:23,550 --> 03:00:24,070
You earned it.

4235
03:00:24,150 --> 03:00:25,450
Let me know if you got any more questions.

4236
03:00:26,010 --> 03:00:26,450
And...

4237
03:00:27,290 --> 03:00:28,090
Good practice.

4238
03:00:28,210 --> 03:00:28,710
Good session.

4239
03:00:29,410 --> 03:00:29,850
Yay!

4240
03:00:30,910 --> 03:00:31,530
All right.

4241
03:00:32,070 --> 03:00:32,510
GG's.

4242
03:00:32,510 --> 03:00:32,730
GG's.

4243
03:00:32,730 --> 03:00:32,790
All right.

4244
03:00:32,790 --> 03:00:33,330
Later, Dokie.

4245
03:00:34,150 --> 03:00:34,590
Bye.

4246
03:00:34,590 --> 03:00:35,230
Bye-bye.

4247
03:00:35,450 --> 03:00:35,890
Later.

4248
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:39,500
Okay.

4249
03:00:41,660 --> 03:00:42,380
Good session.

4250
03:00:44,780 --> 03:00:45,220
Okay.

4251
03:00:45,300 --> 03:00:46,060
Alert's back on.

4252
03:00:46,240 --> 03:00:46,980
What's up, everybody?

4253
03:00:47,760 --> 03:00:48,200
What's up?

4254
03:00:48,200 --> 03:00:48,360
What's up?

4255
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:52,060
She learned a lot that session, I feel like.

4256
03:00:56,100 --> 03:00:59,120
And she really surprised me with her reactions.

4257
03:00:59,260 --> 03:01:02,540
Just the fact that she started blocking a few times and then punishing.

4258
03:01:02,660 --> 03:01:03,880
And then I liked her neutral.

4259
03:01:04,180 --> 03:01:05,380
Her neutral was good.

4260
03:01:08,980 --> 03:01:10,160
Got to see how much is retained.

4261
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:12,940
The thing is, I'm confident it's okay because not...

4262
03:01:12,940 --> 03:01:14,260
There wasn't much tech.

4263
03:01:14,460 --> 03:01:14,720
I didn't...

4264
03:01:14,720 --> 03:01:17,580
Like, we went through some tech in training mode, which that's going to come and go.

4265
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:22,560
It was just the natural rhythm of her play, which was way better.

4266
03:01:23,320 --> 03:01:24,200
She blocked.

4267
03:01:25,160 --> 03:01:26,720
And then it went back to neutral.

4268
03:01:26,900 --> 03:01:28,620
And when she goes back to neutral, she plays better.

4269
03:01:30,520 --> 03:01:35,620
So that was, on a fundamental level, just a better rhythm of approaching.

4270
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:40,490
That was awesome.
