00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,760
I was like where was it?

5
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,340

36
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,500
season i almost leaked out the solo modes

37
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:52,000
because you know i was told about the solos mode and the um
the solos mode and and uh the new legend and all that stuff

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,780
and um and i was like no it wasn't the besties it was the jp
apex legends and i almost because we were talking about like

39
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:06,800
solo stuff and i almost leaked out i was like oh you can do
it next season because there's solos gonna it's solos mode

40
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:20,160
and i almost said that that would have been such a huge
oopsie because mode is like a huge thing and i almost i

41
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:29,840
almost said it out loud i was invited to the place whoa i
was actually um you guys didn't okay i don't know if i told

42
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:42,280
you guys the story um but um i was actually uh i uh i was
told what the next update was gonna be so there was like you

43
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,080
legend which is basically like the better version of rate
and i saw like gameplay of the new legend because i've also

44
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:58,660
had like uh you know i i have like um uh a relationship with
the with the apex devs so like you know we they would like

45
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:07,300
tell me about what's going to be happening for next season
and everything like that and then so uh so like they

46
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:16,760
actually uh one of the devs actually wanted to invite me to
land uh because there was going to be an event at land or

47
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,820
something i think they wanted me to do the solo you know
there's like the solo showcase and everything so like one of

48
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,340
those actually wanted to invite me to land with like plane
ticket and like the plane ticket sort like paying for my

49
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:40,440
plane ticket and also like the hotels and everything and
then like also like getting to try out the the um getting to

50
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,940
try out the new next season for atlant but like i had to
refuse because i also had like a lot of stuff i couldn't

51
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:57,640
really travel anywhere at the moment because i had a lot of
stuff going on and also i was like to be fair i was also

52
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,780
really paranoid Because I was like, oh, I don't want any
photos taken.

53
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:11,520
Because I was like, I was like, um, I was like, wait, who,
how, who, is there going to be like other content creators?

54
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,700
And they're like, oh yeah, yeah, like we're inviting a
select few of content creators as well.

55
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,740
I was like, oh, okay.

56
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,700
And I was like, I'll think about it.

57
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,460
And I was like, okay, at that, at this moment, I was like, I
don't really, I'm a bit paranoid.

58
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,920
I was like oh I am a bit paranoid I feel like I was also had
like a lot of things going on in the background as well uh

59
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:54,060
so so I had to say no and I was like I would love next time
maybe next time I feel like a bit more safe like I think

60
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,840
it's also because like of everything going around about me
and then stuff like that I was also concerned about my

61
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:15,080
safety so I was just like well maybe next time when things
like die down a bit more so so I was just like if things die

62
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:27,000
down a bit more I'll maybe I'll try the next line I'll try
the next one brother thank you for the Akasu bye thank you

Oh my, you know what she reminds me of?

75
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,160
She reminds me of that Mutant in X-Men.

76
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,140
Fuck, what's his name?

77
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,220

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,020
what was that guy's name?

79
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,980
That's what she reminds...

80
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,040
Nightcrawler, yeah!

81
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,760
Nightcrawler.

82
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,260
Like, her toes even has, like, Nightcrawler.

83
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,040
Look, see... Okay, her toes.

84
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,360
Sorry.

85
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,700
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

86
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,140
Look at her feeties.

87
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,720
Look at it.

88
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah, she looks just like Nightcrawler, I feel like.

89
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:39,860
But yeah, she's apparently like the better version of Race
and like more fun from what I'm told.

90
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,200
From like my friends that have like playtested her.

91
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,000
She just looks like a...

92
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,140
What are her finishers though?

93
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,560
Dynamic exit.

94
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,180
Oh!

95
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,800
God, that's like...

96
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,480
Oh, it's like, that ability reminds me of another character.

97
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,220
I can't fucking figure it out right now.

98
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,400
Oh, that's actually pretty sick, though.

99
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,220
Bro, she's fucking crazy.

100
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,790
Bro, even the finishers are fucked up.

101
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,370
And then they...

102
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,110
Six days left.

103
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,490
Oh, Broken Moon.

104
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,210
Wait, what?

105
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,790
Why is there six days of fucking rank?

106
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,330
That does not make sense.

107
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,770
Hey, guys, I'm bronze now.

108
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,070
Anyway.

109
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,070
De-motion, oh, because everybody starts at zero!

110
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,710
Okay, we're gonna try her out.

111
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,030
Wait, actually, we're gonna try her out in firing range.

112
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,250
I forgot about that.

113
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,070
We'll try her out in firing range.

114
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,490
Let me see my volume.

115
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,230

Alright, alright, let's see.

119
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,790
So, how the fuck do I use her abilities?

120
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,810
Oh my god, is this the range?

121
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,270
Oh, no, that's out of range.

122
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:56,910
Okay.

123
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,610
That's like, holy shit, the range.

124
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,830
Oh, wait, that's out of range.

125
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:02,810
Never mind.

126
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,050
Never.

127
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,330
That was not the range.

128
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,910

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,350
passage through a surface.

144
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,250

So they lock the door.

154
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,230

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,080
Do it again.

336
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,060
Don't worry, I got you.

337
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,820
Wait, where are they?

338
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,160
Oh, they're above me.

339
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,320
They were that near me?

340
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,140
Did they see me?

341
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,840
I don't think they saw me, guys.

342
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,840
I'm going on the roof.

343
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,060

00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,080
Yeah, she said, wait, wait.

357
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,080

I am hitting those.

360
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,960
I almost pressed Q for Conduit.

361
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,320
Q?

362
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
I've been playing Conduit for so long.

363
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,060
I'm going to go with that backpack from you.

364
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,480
Okay, maybe if I need him, he's going to have to push up.

365
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:27,940
Yep.

366
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,920
Wait, where is he?

367
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,480
Is that...

368
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,600
Is that mine?

369
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,220
That's mine.

370
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,260
Okay, wait, why are you running?

371
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,360
Oh my god, he's tap strafing too!

372
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,560
Okay, maybe I should- wait, what?

373
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,260
Oh, shit, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
don't worry, don't worry, bro.

374
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:49,980
Don't worry.

375
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,820
Is he rising him?

376
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,340
No?

377
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,860
Okay, let's clear him then.

378
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,980
Just in case.

379
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,350
Where?

380
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,830
Where?

381
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,390
Where?

382
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,510
I'm so confused.

383
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,990
Holy shit.

384
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,290
Okay, guys.

385
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,610
Does it look like I haven't played Apex often for a very
long time?

386
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,130
I did play Apex two days ago, just to be like, oh, shit, new
season.

387
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,070
But it doesn't look like I'm that rusty, right?

388
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,270
Right?

389
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,010
No, right?

390
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,250
I'm naturally talented, so I should look okay, right?

391
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,210
It's because, okay, I'll say it's because...

392
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,130
Let me aim at.

393
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,850
Oh, holy shit, he's so far.

394
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,390
Look, I have a perfectly good excuse for this.

395
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,250
Okay, guys, because I'm playing Wingman.

396
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,550
Okay, I'm playing Wingman, so that's my excuse.

397
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,690
Oh, and he's also playing Wingman.

398
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,050
Look, see, he's not hitting his shots.

399
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,110
It's just a Wingman debuff.

400
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:01,890
Whoops.

401
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,210
Oh, shit.

402
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,750
Okay, I was not expecting him to just be there.

403
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,510
Look, I hit one.

404
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,410
Look, one is one.

405
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,350
Wait, what?

406
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,070
Oh, wait, that's the mirage.

407
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,930
Where the fuck are they?

408
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,750
This team is making me so, like, confused.

409
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,510
Where?

410
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,190
Where the fuck did he go?

411
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,130
Okay, let me loot this guy.

412
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:50,390
first um boosted loader do i need wingman ammo i can't
believe i actually need wingman ammo all right look it says

413
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,930
i got two kills so like i'm not totally worthless

414
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:07,570
all right here we go where the where the is the other team
all right if i stand still i won't get hit I'm going to blow

415
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,270
my nose.

416
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,890
Just give me a sec.

417
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,090
Surely I wouldn't get shot at.

418
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:25,150
All I'm saying is that the shots you don't see me hit are
the shots that...

419
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,630
Wait, if I use this, does it expire for everybody?

420
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,690
Oh, they're near me.

421
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,770
Does it expire or does it still stay up?

422
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,050
She don't know how this works

423
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:51,610
No, no, everyone gets one use Oh, oh, I see Okay, but yeah
You think I don't hit those shots But because you're

424
00:29:51,610 --> 00:30:00,790
blinking You're blinking to the frames of me hitting shots
You can hear it But then if you don't see the visual The

425
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:10,670
visual effect of the shot hitting It's because you blinked
that's it's so fast yeah you just couldn't register it like

426
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:17,430
all of you guys too i can't believe it's like i can't
believe all of you had that experience too that's actually

427
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:25,890
what are the chances what were the odds of that happening
it's like one to a million and you were there it's like a

428
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:38,530
natural phenomenon pertnaid oh shit is this horizon queue a
new visual oh my god okay this team is actually goaded what

429
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:55,770
the fuck I did it all right oh there's a bow I feel like I
hit more shots with a bow than the fucking wingman at this

430
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:05,690
point wait behind us wait who do I go to I'm gonna go to the
cat.

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,430

433
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:14,830
Hello?

434
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,480
What does he want to do?

435
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,500
They're close to me.

436
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,820
But I won't let them know that.

437
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Gotta keep them on their toes.

438
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,240

439
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,100

Okay, here you are.

449
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,320
Look, it's been so long.

450
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,600
Wait, that is him.

451
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,700

Let's just leave.

465
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,920
Let's just...

466
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,360
Wait, as a party leader, you can re-queue the party if you
exit at any time.

467
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Wait, what?

468
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,760
Well, I also have to return to...

469
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,340
Oh, wait, that's...

470
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,580
What?

471
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,420
No, fucking...

472
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,820
Oh, oh, I wasn't the worst!

473
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,620
Guys, I wasn't the worst one!

474
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,480
Wait, I thought I did so little damage!

475
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,840
But I actually did just enough!

476
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,240
I didn't...

477
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,760
It wasn't me!

478
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,520
Guys, I realized I was actually good.

479
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,180
Oh my god.

480
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,500
I was just enough.

481
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:30,700
I was the middle of the pack chat I was the middle of the
pack I blinked it did oh now you blink now I was in the

482
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:45,500

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:59,440

484
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,780

486
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,090
her name?

487
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,770
No matter how much they change this map, this map will
always be ass.

488
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,090
I can't change my mind.

489
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,650
Sorry, I was blinking too much.

490
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,830
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

491
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,190
Thank you.

492
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:33,850
Thank you.

493
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,350
Is it altering?

494
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,050
Yeah, okay.

495
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,070
Because it doesn't change the map.

496
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,590
It doesn't change the size of this map.

497
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,450
Which is what was the huge problem.

498
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,110
Because the map was too fucking big.

499
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,310
I mean, like...

500
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,350
Yeah, I just think the map is just too big.

501
00:35:53,450 --> 00:36:02,130
I forgot broken moon existed we all want to forget broken
moon existed this is like a nice cool design place but still

502
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:09,110
pretty fucking a terrible map I don't think anybody likes
broken moon in general I don't think many want to actually

503
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:17,810
like this goddamn map hello can I steal your stuff Oh, I
want to do triple.

504
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:24,110
Oh, actually, I really want to play triple take for like one
fight because triple take is still an ass gun.

505

00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,910
It's revenge time.

549
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,190
You're diamond.

552
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,070
He's diamond.

553
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,550
He's already disappointed me.

554
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,110
Oh, am I kidding?

555
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:56,950
Alright.

556
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,630
Let's see.

557
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,350
We're gonna grab the G7 Scout.

558
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,970
We're gonna get rid of the G7 Scout because I'm fucking
terrible at it.

559
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,030
Oh, I hear people fighting in there.

560
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,750
In there?

561
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,110
In here.

562
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,050
There's so many.

563
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,550
Oh, there's people.

564
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,470
I hear people next to me.

565
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,390
Or am I fucking going skitsa?

566
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,710
No, there are people next to me.

567
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,090
I see them.

568
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,310
They went through the portal.

569
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,890
He doesn't see me, though.

570
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,070
Alright.

571
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:39,970
Watch this.

572
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,570
Peekaboo!

573
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:44,990
Oh!

574
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,640
Okay.

575
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,920
That was a little ambitious there.

576
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,140
He peekabooed back.

577
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,060
I didn't expect him to look back at me.

578
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,100
He knew.

579
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,380
He stared back into the void and shot me.

580
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,680
That's crazy.

581
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,600
I can't believe he shot back.

582
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,260
That's the craziest thing you can do.

583
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,680
Wait, there's like two different teams here.

584
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,720
Oh shit, no, come on!

585
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,240
I did so much damage!

586
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,300
Hey guys, nice.

587
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,060

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,080
Thank you, thank you.

Thank you.

591
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,420
Okay, oh no.

592
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,580
I need to grab the armor.

593
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,520
How do I, like, grab stuff from other people's inventories?

594
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,960
Because that should be, like, my special, right?

595
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,100
I should be able to grab stuff from other people's
inventories.

596
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,460
people's inventory.

597
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,140
Extend highlights to help bars after it reduces cool down.

598
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,840
I feel like extends highlights to help bars after exiting.

599
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,900
Really, that's good.

600
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,940

I got my banner picked up.

636
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,540
That's important enough.

637
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:58,940
No streaming.

638
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,660

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,600
I know like I said that we were, you know, that this week
was going to be a rest week.

643
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,960
This week is not going to be the rest week, by the way.

644
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,740
You guys didn't know.

645
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,040
Oh, it's not.

646
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,940
Too many things came up last minute.

647
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:34,820
but I'm also like super looking forward to um I'm looking
forward to Hades too uh I was like um that like oh my gosh

648
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:41,620
the sudden drop the Hades 2 drop out of nowhere that's
actually crazy the fact that we have Hades 2 before anything

649
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:52,700
about silk song like all the silk song I love silk song
waiters out there

650
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,120
Hades 2, let's go.

651
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,580
The Silkson Copeum.

652
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,760
Guys, no, it's gonna come out soon.

653
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,580
You guys don't know that.

654
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,280
It's just...

655
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,980
It's just because, like, Hades 2.

656
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,560
Hades 2 is an early axis.

657
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,260
But when Silkson comes out, it's gonna be full of axis.

658
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,440
You guys don't understand.

659
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,640
You gotta do me like that.

660
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,400
Damn.

661
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:19,880
Anyway.

662
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:20,780
Anyway.

663
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,980
I was, like, looking up, like...

664
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,920
I was like, okay, because it's early axis.

665
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:33,780
like okay so like how much content is actually in there and
apparently like majority of like the story content is like

666
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:43,900
actually almost done it's mostly just like the the little
things in the game so okay reduce tactical boy next next is

667
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:53,620
no longer times out wait that's that's so cool wait where's
my teammates oh they are far i'm gonna go to my teammates

668
00:45:53,620 --> 00:46:01,160
again yeah it's just end right yeah most of the gameplay
seems to be there though like it's just the little things

669
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:08,520
it's just apparently the ending is not so like you it's all
it's technically like hours of gameplay which is crazy to

670
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:22,220
think about that that is early access and it's already like
hours of gameplay oh goodbye sir okay those shots were

671
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,940
fucking nasty you have to admit that

672
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,540
Wait, what the fuck?

673
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,780
Oh my god.

674
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,500
They actually thirsted him.

675
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,800
Holy shit.

That poor guy actually got thirsted.

678
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:57,200
Okay, you have to admit, that was a sick-ass shot I did on
whoever this guy was.

679
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,500
Tom Lee.

680
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,240
I didn't even need to use my ability.

681
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:14,580

demolished his teammate like I'd be fucking concerned okay I

I hearing things again I might be hearing things again I'm

683
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,100

684
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,980
Oh, I wasn't hearing things.

685
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:33,880

686
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:34,660

Not gonna lie.

693
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,060
I actually thought it was my teammate, but I forgot that was
my ability.

694
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,380
I was like, wait a minute, health bar.

695
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,360

701
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,030
I feel like there's another team here.

702
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:51,670

703
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:52,790

Where is he shooting at?

713
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,490
I was like, what?

714
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,670
Okay, that poor man.

715
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:16,130
Also, I realized I did not loot any shield cells.

716
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,140
Let me steal that shield cell real fast.

717
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,430
No!

718
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,190
I stole fucking health!

719
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:30,530
Okay, okay, that'll just loot it the old-fashioned way.

720
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,090
Like, it was just reflex.

721
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,990
It was actually just reflex.

722
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,010
Maybe the loot the first thing I see.

723
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,150
I was like, ooh, gold helmet.

724
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,310
That's a nice loot there.

725
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:45,570
Whoops.

726
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,570

What a team player.

728
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,650
That's a weird looking shield, self.

729
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,630
All right, what else can I steal from there?

730
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,610
Wait, this is so convenient.

731
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,810
I can just casually steal things.

732
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,710
All right, let's see.

733
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,350

That's not fair.

823
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:26,850
You should respect this 1v1.

824
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,770
Oh, God.

825
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:28,330

That's right.

828
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:36,030
That's what you get for not respecting the 1v1.

829
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:37,650
Oh, that's right.

830
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,470

like this type of move done before i'm trying to remember oh

861
00:58:55,930 --> 00:59:07,330
perfect cell that's what it reminds me of it reminds me of a
fucking dragon ball z yeah i was like wondering like why the

862
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:16,230
fuck does that kill like it's so similar it reminds me of
like more like cell one yeah i think It was, like, cell one.

Uh...

864
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,010
Imperfect...

865
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,450
Imperfect cell.

It looks like the...

870
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,530
Like, a cell finisher.

871
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,530

Doesn't it...

874
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,390
Like, it just reminds me of the animation for Cell.

875
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,730
Oh, yeah.

876
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,010

I didn't die.

936
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:28,830
You see, the great thing about blind people is that you can
lie to them.

937
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,110
Because they can't see.

938
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:37,910
But I didn't lie to you, friend.

939
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,670
Uh, of course.

940
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,670
I would never lie to you.

941
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,510
That was not a lie.

942
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:47,630
Just, Just so you know, that was not a lie.

943
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,090
Okay, I got...

944
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:53,570
Who has a better trade-off?

945
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,630
The PK and the alternator?

946
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,570

That's messed up.

950
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,000
Don't worry, not just blind people.

951
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,620
It works for deaf people, too.

952
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,300
That's funny, guys.

953
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:31,520

I'm going out of this portal.

969
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,040
I'm going out of here.

970
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,420
You guys fight each other.

971
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:21,640

972
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:22,900

You there's literally people right here.

975
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,100
I can't believe it.

976
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:33,940
You chased me all the way here Where's the other guy?

977
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:47,900
There's there's literally one other guy here and he
disappeared Is he also blind?

978
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:48,640
Gator.

979
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,060
Thank you.

980
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,340
Thank you.

981
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,040
Thank you.

982
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,620
How are you gonna say that about blind people?

983
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:07,200
I told my friend what you said and he typed it was personal
I got the only reason why dude okay I'm gonna say this

984
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,900
character sucks for so long

985
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:22,020
Lance thank you for the magenta soup but thank you thank you
did I blinked okay I blinked and you were running away what

986
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:34,920
happened thank you with magenta soup but thank you thank you
I'm saying is that I picked the wrong legend for this I

987
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:44,680
picked the wrong legend for solo's mode this is definitely
not a solo's character at least I had fucking conduit shield

988
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:51,940
it's like extra shield what do you mean I don't know
actually I'm trying to think like what would be a good solo

989
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,220
character I guess like Bangalore.

990
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:59,920
Bangalore or, uh, maybe Bangalore Wraith Pathliner is for
the mobility.

991
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,060
I feel like Alter is definitely a team character.

992
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:06,200
Okay.

993
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:06,920
There we go.

994
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:07,700
We got it.

995
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,880
We got Wingy and the Prouler.

996
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,480
That is an improvement from a charged fucking rifle.

997
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,980
Definitely a huge improvement.

998
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,020
Oh my gosh, I hear so many shooting.

999
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:20,620
Ooh.

1000
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,460
Okay, wait.

1001
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,700
What is this for now?

1002
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,300
Actually, no.

1003
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:26,940
We'll go with this.

1004
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,220
I don't want to run double.

1005
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,160
I don't want to run double heavy.

1006
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:30,800
All right, let's go.

1007
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,220

It's...

1018
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,080
Okay, am I getting shot by two people?

1019
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,100
Why am I getting shot by two?

1020
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:02,800
Please!

1021
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,520

1022
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,680
Oh my god, bro, I dropped so much money everywhere.

1023
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,900
It's like literally everywhere.

1024
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,800

1025
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,580
Bro, okay, I swear if it's this guy, I'm fucking gonna try.

1026
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,780
That's fucking right.

1027
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:35,400

1028
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,940
Run, you bitch!

1029
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,060
You seem like a guy that fucking shoots people in the backs.

1030
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:50,390
There you go.

1031
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,090
Oh, fucking hell, I'm so mad.

1032
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:56,470
Finally.

1033
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,270
I got our actual 1v1.

1034
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:02,890
Let's see.

1035
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:06,870
I finally got my own 1v1 and I won it.

1036
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,110
I told you it wasn't me!

1037
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:10,950
I kept getting shot in my back!

1038
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:12,430
It's you.

1039
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,510
That's right, it doesn't- it's not fun, right?

1040
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:18,570
It's not fun getting shot in the back, right?

1041
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:26,990
Wait, do I not have shields?

1042
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,880
There he is.

1043
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,860
No, no, no!

1044
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,340
That's not fair!

1045
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,980

1046
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:50,160
Hey, I found a random here says it's blonde so yellow but

01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,700
Not a solo character.

Is this yours, ma'am?

1069
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,940

It will not change anything.

People will still fuck me over.

1142
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:03,470
Always expect a third party.

1143
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,990
Bro, it's like non-stop.

1144
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,610

01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,060
You need to be able to come back.

1147
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,260
The dead should stay dead.

1148
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,100
The dead should stay fucking dead.

1149
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,880

01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:28,060
They keep coming back and shooting me in the fucking back.

1151
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,220
I'll be back.

1152
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,700
Okay, there's three people here.

1153
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,360
Surely those two will fucking shoot each other, right?

1154
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,920
Oh my god.

1155
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,920
Let me land in the middle of these guys.

1156
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,300
Surely I fucked up a little.

1157
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,380
Okay, I'll be in here now.

1158
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,820
I'm gonna live underneath you.

1159
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,600
Wait, I could go here.

1160
01:16:59,400 --> 01:16:59,580
Bye.

1161
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,300
Wait, he's gone.

1162
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:04,420
Okay.

1163
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,620
It's not that bad right now.

1164
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,600
Okay, they're shooting each other.

1165
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,040
They're shooting each other.

1166
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:12,600
That's good.

1167
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:14,320
That's so good.

1168
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,480
Wait, okay, wait, I got a plan.

1169
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,320
I got a plan.

1170
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,760
Wait, this is a good plan.

1171
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,480
But this plan is brilliant.

1172
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,980
You can't third-party me if I shoot from the distance.

1173
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:34,780
Alright.

1174
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,520
Okay, here we go.

1175
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:37,820
Alright, this is it.

1176
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:38,780
I'll just stop.

1177
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,100
I'll just stop.

1178
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:45,660
Shit!

1179
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,080
I'll just stop pushing people.

1180
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:48,960
I'll just stay here.

1181
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,700
I'll just fucking stay here.

1182
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,540
Listen, we discovered the play.

1183
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,300
This is how we gotta play this.

1184
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,280
It's if I just stay here.

1185
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,400
Don't push up.

1186
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:06,960
Don't push up.

1187
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:07,840
I have a sniper.

1188
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:11,740
Don't push up.

1189
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,320
Oh, God.

1190
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:16,160
Oh, God.

1191
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,280
He came back for revenge.

1192
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,320
Don't push up.

1193
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:21,960
I have a sniper.

1194
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:24,280
Where are they coming from?

1195
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,560
There's no way he pushed up, right?

1196
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:30,980
There's no way.

1197
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,080
Why are they all coming to me?

1198
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:40,760
Guys, guys, look, I'm...

1199
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,840
There you go.

1200
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,500
Oh my god, he had the same plan!

1201
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,140
That's illegal!

1202
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,900
That was my plan!

1203
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,700
How can he have the same plan as me?

1204
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,200
I don't...

1205
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,200
How did he have...

1206
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:00,600
What?

1207
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,660
He also has the same plan!

1208
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,320
Why are they all sniping?

1209
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,460
Bro!

1210
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,580
They're all stealing my ideas!

1211
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,300
This is so fucked up.

1212
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,940
They all stole my idea.

1213
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,860
Like, I had this idea first.

1214
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,280
Now everyone is sniping.

1215
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:24,700
I had this idea first.

1216
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,420
Why are they all stealing from me?

1217
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:28,660
Oh, wait.

1218
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,340
Wrong one.

1219
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:31,160
It's okay.

1220
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:31,660
I'm better.

1221
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:33,000
No!

1222
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:34,740
No!

1223
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,480
He's so low.

1224
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,160
He was so low.

1225
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,840
I gotta crack one of them.

1226
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:47,840
No!

1227
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:48,160
What?

1228
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,280
Fuck off!

1229
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:51,690
Fuck off!

1230
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:53,150
I'm trying to snipe.

1231
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:58,790
This is so messed up.

1232
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,890
I can't believe my ideas got stolen.

1233
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:02,830
Is this how...

1234
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:04,810
Is this how my hero felt like?

1235
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:09,170
Thomas Edison.

1236
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:15,350
This is how my hero felt.

1237
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,210
Where is he?

1238
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:22,090
Oh, he DC'd.

1239
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:22,550
Nice.

1240
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:23,690
Thank God.

1241
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:26,030
Trip at him.

1242
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:32,630

1243
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:46,290

1244
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:58,990
stealing my fucking ideas that's that has to be a tesla set
seeing stealing ideas that rightfully mine that's what dude

1245
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:14,350

little bitch but okay let's see he's still sniping I

1246
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:28,640
literally saw him fucking sniping from 20 miles away look at
him he's still doing it this is 180 oh he's like running

1247
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,520
away from me too.

1248
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,540
That's the funny part.

1249
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,200
I can't believe this is solo mode.

1250
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:37,640
This is the longest I've ever lived just because I'm playing
sniper.

1251
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:44,600
This is actually the longest I've ever lived.

1252
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,640
It's so sad.

1253
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,440
It's so sad.

1254
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,380
Where am I just shot from?

1255
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,120
I want to know where the Mirage guy is.

1256
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,720
Rajgat has so many shields.

1257
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:02,340
That's like the craziest part for me.

1258
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,260
How does he still have the shields for this?

1259
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,280
No.

1260
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,060
Oh, no.

1261
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:10,820
No.

1262
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:13,900
No.

1263
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,240
You don't get to fuck me over here like this.

1264
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,800
That's fucking right.

1265
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,620
I'm a better sniper.

1266
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,840
That's fucking right.

1267
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,820
I'm a better sniper.

1268
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,420
Bro, everybody here is just sniping.

1269
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,260
Bro!

1270
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,220
What?

1271
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:45,340
Why?

1272
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,240
Why?

1273
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:48,680
This is my area.

1274
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:49,560
Leave!

1275
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:59,220
Literally, everybody here is sniping.

1276
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,520
Actually, leave me.

1277
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:02,000
No!

1278
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,100
I don't have shields anymore!

1279
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,840
Oh my god!

1280
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:13,460
Like, leave me alone!

1281
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,400
You started this, Joki!

1282
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,040
I didn't think everyone was gonna snipe!

1283
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,480
I literally have zero shields.

1284
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,580
How

1285
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,460

1286
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,220
for this.

1287
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,000

Okay, I'm gonna grab this.

1309
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:59,670
Maybe I can snipe with this.

1310
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:05,970
Look, I lived for so long.

1311
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,130
Don't fucking see.

01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:08,050
With.

1313
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:08,770
Wait, wait.

1314
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:13,430
This is the longest I've lived in this game.

1315
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,290
Oh my god.

1316
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,210
This is hell.

1317
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:22,710
I feel like solo modes is literally just sniping.

1318
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,310
This is not fun.

1319
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:28,530
I mean, I guess you can practice sniping, but still.

1320
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,190
This shit is bullshit.

1321
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,280
This is actually bullshit.

1322
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,920
This is the game mode now.

1323
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,460
This is solo mode.

1324
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,380
Are you fucking...

1325
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:46,280
Bro, please.

1326
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,460
You and I both have to go to zone.

1327
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:59,250
You have to come down, sir.

1328
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:02,130
You're not in zone.

1329
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:05,610
That's fucking right.

1330
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:07,910
He's so confused.

1331
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,610
Oh, fucking hell, this is not fair.

1332
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,490
This is not fair!

1333
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:21,910
Are you serious?

1334
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:22,910
No!

1335
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:24,710
Fuck off!

1336
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:26,790
No!

1337
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:33,790
Bro, where did the Bangalore go?

1338
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:36,510
Where the fuck is the Bangalore?

1339
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:38,690
How did he say that?

1340
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:43,490
A sniper took you, but I really give it...

1341
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,630
No, fuck this game.

1342
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:46,510
This game fucking sucks.

1343
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:53,090
This game fucking sucks.

1344
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:54,550
Fuck this game.

1345
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:57,710
It's either...

1346
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:58,050
It's either...

1347
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:14,190
a third priority or sniping that's it it really is open this
season good job on the sniper battle i swear not gonna lie i

1348
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:23,610
liked it until until until you get sniped by 20 people randy
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you then we'll

1349
01:28:23,610 --> 01:28:32,700

1350
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:56,960

bullshit it's not fair it's not fair at all as an introvert

1351
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:03,140
apex player i like this game mode as a m you like this game
mode

1352
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:12,120
bro i still can't believe that one area landed on and
everybody was just sniping each other from each building

1353
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,180
each building just had its own sniper

1354
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,550
It's not fair because they always come back.

1355
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:33,390
Because when you kill them, they're going to come back and
shoot you in the back.

1356
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:39,690
And they always arrive when I'm in a fight.

1357
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:42,110
They always arrive when I'm in a fight.

1358
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:43,210
That's the worst part.

1359
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:45,690
That actually is the worst part.

1360
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:49,550
They don't wait until, you know, to do a respectable 1v1.

1361
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,970
They're like, no, I'm going to fuck this person so hard.

1362
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:55,650
Get her out of that lobby.

1363
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:58,110
hate that bitch.

1364
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:01,410
A lot of people are using Mozam.

1365
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:02,310
Is it good now?

1366
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:05,270
Is there anybody here?

1367
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:08,890
I don't think anybody's here.

1368
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:13,550
I mean, I don't think anybody land here.

1369
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:15,890
Are so many people running Mozam?

1370
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:16,910
Is it good or not?

1371
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:17,590
I can't tell.

1372
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:21,290
Boink.

1373
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:22,070
By now.

1374
01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:25,330
I don't think so.

1375
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:26,650
Because none of this is... Oh!

1376

I'm so Resme.

1382
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:02,390
This is what you get.

1383
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:03,570
He was literally 1 HP.

1384
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:04,650
This is what you fucking get.

1385
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:05,510
Fucking please.

1386
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:06,230
Where's our third?

1387
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:07,370
Oh my god.

1388
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:08,310
Where are you?

1389
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:09,410
Save this man.

1390
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:10,650
He's literally right here.

1391
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:12,210
He's on my door.

1392
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:14,110
He wants to mess me up.

1393
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:15,850
He's right here.

1394
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:16,490

1395
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:17,650
Oh no, he doesn't.

1396
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:18,430
He's just running.

1397
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:22,270
I think he's gonna lose.

1398
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:22,830
That's...

1399
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:24,370
He's definitely gonna lose this one.

1400
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:24,950
1v1.

1401
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,950
There's no way he wouldn't.

1402
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:30,270
this there's no way there's no way he wins okay

1403
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:40,290
i fucking knew it there's actually no way he wants us

1404
01:31:44,710 --> 01:31:59,330
all i'm saying is that if he is that man was there with us i
got my one i got my one we won know all about you but i got

1405
01:31:59,330 --> 01:32:06,750

that dokey every time you die it's never your fault

1406
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:16,650
are you gonna be the new coach for tsm okay first off we got
they gotta have a team first like

1407
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:27,910
because it doesn't seem like there's going to be a tsm team
The moment.

1408
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,330
It's actually crazy, though.

1409
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:37,630
That's actually crazy.

1410
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:42,910
Like, because, like, TSM has been, like, a team together for
so long.

1411
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:45,410
Too soon.

1412
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:47,910
Damn.

1413
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:53,530
Please, let me play Alter.

1414
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:57,070
I just want to play Alter.

1415
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:58,990
Oh, sorry.

1416
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:01,330
I upped the game volume a little bit, I don't know.

1417
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,830
I let me tell my sound guy.

1418
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:10,310
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1419
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:15,450
I don't know if it's, like, too loud or, like, if it's
better now.

1420
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:19,730
TSM made this ban only.

1421
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:21,630
Yeah, there's rumors that TSM...

1422
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,310
Oh, my God, that's such a cute banner!

1423
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:24,790
Wait, that's such a cute banner.

1424
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:27,570
There's rumors that TSM made this ban.

1425
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:29,170
And I feel like...

1426
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:30,410
I feel like...

1427
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:32,370
I feel like it might actually happen.

1428
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:36,530
Because those tweets, those tweets from Reps and Verhals is
so sus.

1429
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,760
Like, why would they tweet that?

1430
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,120
Only in Apex.

1431
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,420
Yeah, it's just Apex.

1432
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,520
Apex rumors.

1433
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,100
Did they land it on me?

1434
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:54,880
No, they haven't.

1435
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:55,760
I'm okay.

1436
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:57,540
Okay.

1437
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:58,620
Alright, 9.

1438
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,460
Havoc.

1439
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,060
And then, got my guns.

1440
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,420
Got what I need.

1441
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:06,180
Let's fight!

1442
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:08,600
I won't get fuck over here, right?

1443
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:09,100
Nope.

1444
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,360
I knew I'll be okay.

1445
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:13,860
Alright.

1446
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:14,640
Evic.

1447
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:16,720

1448
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:17,320
Where?

1449
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:29,910
Whoa!

1450
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:31,910
I'm gonna stand here.

1451
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:33,810
I don't think they know I'm here now.

1452
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:37,770
If they know I'm here, they're stream sniping.

1453
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:40,430
What the fuck was that?

1454
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,270
Wait, how do I get back, though?

1455
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:44,390
Oh, that's how.

1456
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:47,170

Okay.

1463
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:28,210

It was so calculated.

1466
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:32,810
Of course it was.

1467
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:34,930
Of course it was calculated.

1468
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:36,070
I'm a gamer.

1469
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:39,950
Oh, wait.

1470
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:40,590

01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:41,570
Oh, wait.

1472
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:41,730
No.

1473
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:43,110
They already used the disruptor.

1474
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:46,630
Alright.

1475
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:47,210

That's why I got the...

1480
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:26,390
That's why I got the vault.

1481
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:28,750
Alright.

1482
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,110
Back to the old days.

1483
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:32,950
Bring me back.

1484
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:35,050
Give me my nostalgia bait.

1485
01:36:36,150 --> 01:36:38,130
Please, I don't have anything else.

1486
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:39,890
Let's see.

1487
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:42,390
Care package over there.

1488
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:43,870
Let's just go somewhere, guys.

1489
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:44,890
Let's leave.

1490
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:47,170
There's clearly no other teams here.

1491
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:49,750
Yay!

1492
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:53,390
I'm just gonna go straight.

1493
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,690
I'm just gonna go straight here.

1494
01:36:57,490 --> 01:36:58,630
And also grab the armor.

1495
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:02,650
There's no way I get shot in the air, right?

1496
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,390
There's no way I land in the three teams.

1497
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:06,870
Like, my bad luck is not that bad.

1498
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:11,530
Give me season.

1499
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:14,570
Okay, we're not going that further back, bro.

1500
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,810
We're going back, but that's way...

1501
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:21,990
You went too far.

1502
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:26,450
That's a bit too far, bro.

1503
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:30,370
I heard, like, shots here.

1504
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:35,660
Let's see.

1505
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:36,900
For me?

1506
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,300
What the fuck is it?

1507
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:41,040
Are they, like, rapping?

1508
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,080
Like, what is that?

1509
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:44,760
Oh, fuck!

1510
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,840
Okay, there is a chance that my bad luck is that bad.

1511
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:53,340
Maybe.

1512
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:58,820
I'm putting off all the defenses right now.

1513
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:01,720
Are you serious?

1514
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,380
They were in fact serious.

1515
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:08,460
Oh, wait.

1516
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:09,500
I helped.

1517
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:10,780
Oh, God.

1518
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,360
I did it!

1519
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,080
Oh, my God.

1520
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,020
You're welcome.

1521
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:19,320
You're absolutely welcome.

1522
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,160
I feel like I deserve all that loot.

1523
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:22,560
for everything I did.

1524
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:27,200
Okay, I heard, like, shots from here.

1525
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:28,180
There they are.

1526
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:33,590

01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:39,130

01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,700
Guys, I need to break 1k.

1558
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,960
Guys, I fucked up with...

1559
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,280
Whoa!

1560
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,540
Why am I so fast?

1561
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,000
That arrow made me so fast.

1562
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,520
My momentum was crazy there.

1563
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:33,490
See, we need that.

1564
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,150
Uh...

1565
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:37,990
Anything for me?

1566
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:39,670
Yoink.

1567
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:42,590
Where is the...

1568
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:43,770
Okay, we have to go back.

1569
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:45,450
This is not even in the...

1570
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:49,130
No, it wasn't my...

1571
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:50,530
It wasn't my passive, though.

1572
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:51,350
That's the thing.

1573
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:53,830
Because everybody was close by.

1574
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:57,730
Everyone was so close to me.

1575
01:41:57,930 --> 01:41:59,530
I can't be my passive.

1576
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:01,630
I think it's the momentum of the stairs.

1577
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:02,170
Yeah.

1578
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:04,630
Wait, what?

1579
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:08,670
The momentum of the stairs made me so fast.

1580
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:16,450
Yeah, it's the stairs.

1581
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:18,570
The stairs actually made me go zoom.

1582
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:19,770
Whoa!

1583
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:21,010
Don't worry!

1584
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:22,990
You're okay!

1585
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:24,990
Wait, where are they?

1586
01:42:29,430 --> 01:42:30,530
Where the fuck are they?

1587
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:36,060
They have to come here, right?

1588
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:37,240
There's no way that hits me.

1589
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:41,820
I told you, there's no way that hits me.

1590
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:43,860
No way this hits me, too.

1591
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,600
I have the high ground.

1592
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:49,120
Push in!

1593
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:49,720
Push in!

1594
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:50,540
Come on, push in!

1595
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:55,040
Alright, we should be able to push in now with this.

1596
01:42:59,310 --> 01:42:59,930
Oh god.

1597
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:00,970
Oh god.

1598
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:01,590
Alright.

1599
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:03,970
Okay, goodbye!

1600
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:08,730
Okay, goodbye.

1601
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:26,610
Not the dead slide!

1602
01:43:27,470 --> 01:43:28,670
Oh no!

1603
01:43:30,990 --> 01:43:33,650
The fucking dead slide!

1604
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:34,990
No!

1605
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:38,050
Oh my god.

1606
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:41,050
I can't believe I got dead slides so hard.

1607
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:42,590
I got my one.

1608
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:45,950
All I'm saying, I got my one.

1609
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:47,410
Where the fuck were there one?

1610
01:43:48,210 --> 01:43:49,690
Not the slide.

1611
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,720
Oh no!

1612
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:58,480
My dead slides!

1613
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:00,700
It fucked everything up!

1614
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:07,480
It fucked everything what that could... Oh my god, this guy
is a fucking top 17 friend.

1615
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:10,020
Bro, what are you doing?

1616
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,220
Don't you want Fred again?

1617
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:12,500
Bro, don't you want...

1618
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,760
The death slide!

1619
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:17,640
No!

1620
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,420
I told you it's not me!

1621
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:22,640
It's the game!

1622
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,500
The game's sabotaging me!

1623
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,080
It's the game!

1624
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,660
It's sabotaged me!

1625
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,960
Oh my god, he talks.

1626
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:36,840
I guess any gun.

1627
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:39,520
They're talking to each other.

1628
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,600
They're letting each other know what guns they want.

1629
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:43,420
What's a dead slide?

1630
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:48,240
It's like when you try to slide for momentum, but you don't
get the momentum.

1631
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,560
That's what it is.

1632
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:52,700
That's a dead slide.

1633
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:56,120
He speaks.

1634
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:57,800
He has a mouth.

1635
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,300
Isn't that crazy?

1636
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:01,260
A fucking mouth.

1637
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:07,060
Holy shit.

1638
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:12,380
That's insane.

1639
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,140
Alright.

1640
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:17,120
Please!

1641
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,520
I just want to play ULTAR!

1642
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:22,440
Give me ULTAR!

1643
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:23,600
That's right.

1644
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:24,600
You don't even get Conduit.

1645
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:27,500
If I can't get ULTAR, you can't get Conduit.

1646
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:28,840
Number three.

1647
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,900
Okay, it's the slide, but you don't get the actual slide
part.

1648
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,220
It's pretty sad.

1649
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:54,900
shouldn't have communicated look you can tell i i get worse
every season because what wait this is a three what this is

1650
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,740

1651
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:06,280
you can see i like my like every season i get worse because
my badges get lower

1652
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:14,640
All right, here we go.

1653
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,680
Where's my Pred players?

1654
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,520
Where are they?

1655
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,800
Where are my Pred players?

1656
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,440
Jin-Jay, thank you for the super chat.

1657
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:23,240
Thank you, thank you.

1658
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:29,340
This is what happens when you get older.

1659
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,140
That is not true.

1660
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:32,040
That's a fucking lie.

1661
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,380
VTubers don't age.

1662
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:38,220
We're digital.

1663
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,340
We can't age.

1664
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,380
How dare you?

1665
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,020
You're fucking kidding here, bro.

1666
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:44,520
All right.

1667
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:47,120
Oh, I should go to my teammate.

1668
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,340
Oh, shit.

1669
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:53,720
There's no way he sees me, right?

1670
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:56,900
Told you, he doesn't see me.

1671
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:58,640
Oh, bloody ass teammates!

1672
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:01,340

1673
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:14,260
Oh, my!

1674
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:15,680
Wait, there's night!

1675
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:16,820
Okay, guys.

1676
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,780
Okay, I fucked up.

1677
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,740
There's another team.

1678
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:20,280
Guys, don't come over here.

1679
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,220
Everywhere I go, people die.

1680
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:24,600

Oh my god, I actually have nothing.

01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,520
I have nothing right now.

1690
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:42,120
All I have is my fucking repeater.

1691
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:46,360
Okay, I thirsted one guy.

1692

Nice.

1697
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,220
I'm okay.

1698
01:48:57,380 --> 01:48:58,080
I helped.

1699
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:00,740
I'm a team player.

1700
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:02,180
Never forget.

1701
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:04,020
Never back down.

01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:06,440
I'm gonna fucking...

1703
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,660
There's a full team right here on my feet.

I'm gonna grab this.

1705
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:11,280
I don't have the ammo for this.

1706
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,120
No, you're not.

1707
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:14,740
No, you're not!

1708
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:17,560
Whoa.

01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,160

Oh, this is where I die.

1722
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:36,900
What is that?

1723
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:40,760
Shit!

1724
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,020
What the fuck was that war?

01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:50,840
Is this eye on that fucking boy?

1726
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,840
Oh my god!

1727
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:59,160
That's why I can't possibly know why I'm here right after I
shot them.

1728
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:03,440
It was valiant but deadly.

I wasn't the first to die.

1747
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:10,670
Death's doctor was.

1748
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:12,450
No mercy.

1749
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:14,670

01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:49,510
It didn't mean anything to this person.

1755
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:51,870
What the fuck?

1756
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:56,150
I'm gonna leave this team.

1757
01:53:56,690 --> 01:54:00,410
I'm gonna leave this team.

1758
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:05,830

1759
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:10,670
Oh my god.

1760
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:12,790
I was destined to die there.

1761
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:15,850
I truly was destined to die there.

1762
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:27,200

01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:28,040
think of it that way Peace was not an intro.

1769
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:31,200
They're not making content.

1770
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:32,540

1771
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:38,820

Alright.

1777
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,040

Okay.

1783
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:32,000
Alright, this is awkward.

1784
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,860
That was a little awkward.

1785
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:48,380
Okay, I get that armor swap.

1786
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:52,240
Oh, God.

1787
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:56,710
Okay, we're fine.

1788
01:56:59,170 --> 01:56:59,610
No!

1789
01:57:00,010 --> 01:57:01,690
He used it against me!

1790
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:16,990
okay okay i fucked up because i pressed q into two people

1791
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:32,970

still learning i'm still learning your abilities Her

1792
01:57:32,970 --> 01:57:34,890
abilities are hard to master.

1793
01:57:37,690 --> 01:57:38,810
Her abilities.

1794
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:39,290
Oh, wait.

1795
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:40,810
Her teammates left her, too.

1796
01:57:43,190 --> 01:57:43,550
It's okay.

1797
01:57:43,670 --> 01:57:46,630
We have Clifford, the big red dog, and Sonic, the blue
hedgehog.

1798
01:57:47,130 --> 01:57:48,470
Surely nothing can go wrong.

1799
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:52,330
Oh, my God.

1800
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:55,550
The crossover of a fucking century.

1801
01:57:56,710 --> 01:57:58,650
Sounds like a skill issue.

1802
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:01,910
Okay.

1803
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:03,130
This is it.

1804
01:58:03,970 --> 01:58:05,690
This is the crossover we needed.

1805
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:08,650
This is the crossover that will give us the win.

1806
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:10,630
The strong duo.

1807
01:58:11,030 --> 01:58:11,170
Yes.

1808
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:15,770
Like, with those names, with those names, this duo is
unstoppable.

1809
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:19,190
I knew it.

1810
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:22,490
I knew Clifford would be a 4K 20 bomb.

1811
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:26,170
At his size, he could just...

1812
01:58:26,170 --> 01:58:27,470
He just squished him.

1813
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:28,790
Oh my god.

1814
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:32,210
He could just squished him with his sheer size.

1815
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:44,570
a bird a dog and a hedgehog what could go wrong god that's
one hell of a powerful team bro he could kill 20 people with

1816
01:58:44,570 --> 01:58:57,790
just one step clifford the big red guy this has to be
winnable okay actually i actually i should not have peaced

1817
01:58:57,790 --> 01:59:06,610
out because like everybody lands here so i'm I'm a little
fucking scared.

1818
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:08,150
Alright.

1819
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:13,310
Okay, into the hole I go.

1820
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:14,950
The hole is the goal.

1821
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:19,250
Three people sharing this one hole.

1822
01:59:20,170 --> 01:59:21,370
Seems ideal.

1823
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:26,410
Surely nothing can go wrong when he does that.

1824
01:59:28,590 --> 01:59:29,010
See?

1825
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:32,410
There we go.

1826
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:33,690
Nothing went wrong.

1827
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:38,010
Oh, I can go back up.

1828
01:59:38,270 --> 01:59:38,970
Wait, what?

1829
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:43,350
I can, but I just chose not to.

1830
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:46,070
Guys, I just chose not to go up.

1831
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:47,690
Wait, where are you?

1832
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:48,490
Oh, wait, on me.

1833
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:51,790
It's on me.

1834
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:54,890
Whoa.

1835
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:57,010
Okay, that was a cool hit fire.

1836
01:59:57,170 --> 01:59:57,850
You got him in.

1837
01:59:59,930 --> 02:00:00,370
Nice.

1838
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:02,090
Wait, where's your teammate?

1839
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:04,590

1840
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:17,130

1843

Let's go.

1845
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:37,450
Let's flag.

1846
02:00:40,130 --> 02:00:40,910
Here we go.

1847
02:00:41,430 --> 02:00:42,090
Come on, Sonic.

1848

You got this.

1849
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:45,090
You got to go fast.

1850
02:00:46,230 --> 02:00:47,110
Is he going to do the thing?

1851
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:47,630
What is he?

1852
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:52,590
He's trying to go inside.

1853
02:00:53,430 --> 02:00:54,830
He's like, fine.

1854
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:56,470
I'll use the door.

1855
02:00:59,170 --> 02:01:00,210
Oh, shit.

1856
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:04,590
I like how he's like, I guess I'll use the door.

1857
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:08,110
This is another team.

1858
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:15,830
Yeah, this is...

1859
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:21,110
Oh, God.

Okay, nice.

1867
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,220

02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:45,860
It can be applied in any situation.

1876
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,200
That's the girl code.

1877
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:53,740
Or that way.

1878
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:54,040
Okay.

1879
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:55,580
Is that how it works?

1880
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:05,420
Let's show it to our loud under some rules.

1881
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:07,220
That man is not a bro.

1882
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,180
Who said that?

1883
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:10,800
I always go, that's fucked up.

1884
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:14,000
You're not a bro, bro.

1885
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:14,280
Bro.

1886
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,340
Wow, grows are complicated.

1887
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:19,860
I did it.

1888
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:24,160
Look, I did it.

1889
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:26,730
You saw that Zoink saw killed him.

1890
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:28,360
Damn.

1891
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:32,000
You're never safe from a nutshot.

1892
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:36,120
Alright, let's see.

1893
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:38,360
I'm gonna grab this.

1894
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:40,660
And then...

1895
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:41,540
I'm helping.

1896
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:43,840
I need, like, a fucking prowler.

1897
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:46,960
I just, oh, no.

1898
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:47,800
Oh, I can cancel.

1899
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:48,300
Okay.

1900
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:49,540
That was an accident.

1901
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:51,440
Wait, what?

1902
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,180
Where?

1903
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:53,720
Oh, there.

1904
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:55,660
There.

1905
02:03:57,940 --> 02:03:58,360
No, where?

1906
02:03:58,380 --> 02:03:59,220
I can go in too.

1907

It's when a bro holds it tenderly.

Wait, what?

2076
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:30,790
Where are they shooting at?

2077
02:17:31,550 --> 02:17:32,370
Where do we go?

2078
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:37,190
That's my first day, exactly.

2079
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:40,090
This hero literally, this legend literally just got
released, guys.

2080
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:41,090
What do you want from me?

2081
02:17:43,730 --> 02:17:46,250
I'm learning it live with all of you.

2082
02:17:48,310 --> 02:17:49,270
Let's see.

2083
02:17:49,490 --> 02:17:50,730
I mean, we could just...

2084
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:54,490
Can we not put this out here?

2085
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:55,830
We cannot?

2086
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:57,110
That's bullshit.

2087
02:17:58,150 --> 02:17:59,330
Wait, we can't.

2088
02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:00,670
That's actually bullshit.

2089
02:18:01,230 --> 02:18:02,210
I'm gonna put this here.

2090
02:18:02,730 --> 02:18:04,310
And then take this.

2091
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:06,710
I leave.

2092
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:08,050
I leave.

2093
02:18:08,470 --> 02:18:08,770
Wow!

2094
02:18:10,010 --> 02:18:10,950
I leave.

2095
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:12,530
I leave now.

2096
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:17,780
Wait, what?

2097
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:25,360
Bro, we crossed paths!

2098
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,820
We crossed streams!

2099
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:29,640
What the fuck?

2100
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:32,000
What the fuck was that?

2101
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:35,120
We actually crossed streams.

2102
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:41,770
Bro!

2103
02:18:43,550 --> 02:18:46,030
Bro, you like fucked them up.

2104
02:18:46,550 --> 02:18:49,170

2107
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:18,230

Well, he's over there Whoa, yeah, I'm fucking going back

2110
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:57,940
The entire army fucking came over to me What the fuck?

02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:00,560
Yeah, what's going on?

2112
02:20:05,450 --> 02:20:06,710
What the hell?

2113
02:20:07,990 --> 02:20:08,710
Is he behind?

2114
02:20:11,130 --> 02:20:14,170
Okay, that was very...

2115
02:20:15,650 --> 02:20:19,810
That was a very ballsy of them.

2116
02:20:21,490 --> 02:20:22,390
Alright, nice.

2117
02:20:23,990 --> 02:20:26,180
That was actually so confident that...

2118
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:28,330
Holy shit.

2119
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:32,570
I still have one more charge.

2120
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:33,110
I do.

2121
02:20:33,490 --> 02:20:34,430
Wait, no, I don't.

2122
02:20:35,630 --> 02:20:36,630
Okay, let's see.

2123
02:20:36,770 --> 02:20:37,950
I'm going to grab that.

2124
02:20:38,790 --> 02:20:39,050
Yeah!

2125
02:20:39,790 --> 02:20:40,530
Very ambitious.

2126
02:20:40,810 --> 02:20:40,990
Yeah.

2127
02:20:41,390 --> 02:20:42,570
Very fucking ambitious.

2128
02:20:43,950 --> 02:20:44,710
Those free kills.

2129
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:54,090
See, if I had nickel every time Doki said, watch this, and I
immediately jump scared, I could possibly play for a super

2130
02:20:54,090 --> 02:20:54,590
chat.

2131
02:20:55,150 --> 02:20:56,730
I agree with a super chat.

2132
02:20:56,790 --> 02:20:56,950
Thank you.

2133
02:20:57,070 --> 02:20:57,670
Thank you.

2134
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:04,730
All right, where's another team?

2135
02:21:05,350 --> 02:21:07,010
We gotta go this way, guys.

2136
02:21:08,410 --> 02:21:10,150
Guys, I just realized he's live.

2137
02:21:10,490 --> 02:21:11,270
Oh my god.

2138
02:21:11,810 --> 02:21:13,170
I feel he's finesse.

2139
02:21:14,310 --> 02:21:14,850
Let's go.

2140
02:21:16,210 --> 02:21:17,110
Where do we go?

2141
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:18,350
Oh, this is new.

2142
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:20,110
I've went through this before.

2143
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:25,230
To be fair, this map has been, like, blurring together for
me.

2144
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:30,450
All right, let's see.

2145
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:33,710
Down, not go.

2146
02:21:35,270 --> 02:21:36,410
Down, not go.

2147
02:21:36,570 --> 02:21:37,590
Wait, I can just drop down.

2148
02:21:37,830 --> 02:21:40,590
Oh, it's like, this is like the storm point thing.

2149
02:21:41,750 --> 02:21:43,230
It's a trespass ball again.

2150
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:46,310
Okay, watch.

2151
02:21:49,850 --> 02:21:50,370
Nobody.

2152
02:21:51,090 --> 02:21:52,430
Okay, thank God.

2153
02:21:56,590 --> 02:22:00,490
Every time I go through those portals, I just hope there's
nobody there.

2154
02:22:02,190 --> 02:22:08,390
over here there's people here though on me

2155
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:18,080

2156
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:38,210
oh that was not supposed to happen but i take those wait
what right there Where are they?

2157
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:40,550
I hear them.

2158
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:43,850
Hey.

2159
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:47,550
Back I go.

2160
02:22:51,070 --> 02:22:52,690
Yeah, they were up top.

2161
02:22:53,970 --> 02:22:55,270
No one there heard them.

2162
02:22:57,310 --> 02:22:58,710
Is he still up there?

2163
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:00,090
There's no way.

2164
02:23:03,270 --> 02:23:04,070
Wait, what the fuck?

2165
02:23:04,250 --> 02:23:04,910
There's a crypto dude.

2166
02:23:07,650 --> 02:23:08,370
Don't worry.

2167
02:23:09,310 --> 02:23:10,990
Surely he's not down here again.

2168
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:12,130
Oh, he isn't.

2169
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:13,590
Don't worry, bro!

2170
02:23:14,530 --> 02:23:15,430
Got you!

2171
02:23:17,030 --> 02:23:18,870
Bro, I got you, bro!

2172
02:23:20,930 --> 02:23:21,210
Okay.

2173
02:23:22,150 --> 02:23:22,510
Nice.

2174
02:23:22,910 --> 02:23:24,330
I told you I got this, man.

2175
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:28,190
I gotta go this way.

2176
02:23:28,430 --> 02:23:28,690
Okay.

2177
02:23:29,530 --> 02:23:30,150
Let's see.

2178
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:33,110
The last three squads are shooting at each other, I think.

2179
02:23:34,130 --> 02:23:34,730
Yeah, they are.

2180
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:50,420
there's no way I could get fucked over here there you go
there's no way there's no way they're just gonna shoot back

2181
02:23:50,420 --> 02:24:03,280
at me you're too stupid for that and the other team is like
they were looking at another team on my right side whoa okay

2182
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:17,220
I just realized I don't have a lot of ammo but it's okay

2183
02:24:17,220 --> 02:24:29,500

2185
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:46,300

02:24:48,260 --> 02:24:48,500
Whoa!

2187
02:24:58,280 --> 02:25:02,140
Guys, yeah, I'm not doing that again.

2188
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:08,840
Who would have thought it'd be pretty bad?

2189
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:11,700
Who would have thought?

2190
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:14,540
It'd be pretty fucking bad.

2191
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:19,760
Oh my god, they- wait, they have red armor.

2192
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:20,580
Wait a minute.

2193
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:22,460
How long have they been here?

2194
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:25,400
Guys, guys, I'm gonna come with you.

2195
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:27,980
Do it again.

2196
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:28,840
It'll be so funny.

2197
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:30,380
Okay, but like, what if I do this?

2198
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:30,920
Watch this.

2199
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:32,280
Watch this.

2200
02:25:33,380 --> 02:25:39,700
What if I- Okay, death 30, 30.

2201
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:44,420
Oh no, what if I- It would be so fun, you know.

2202
02:25:51,860 --> 02:25:54,760
Okay, let me actually contribute to this fight.

2203
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:05,200
Okay, let me actually contribute.

2204
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:16,060
We actually have to be part of this game now.

2205
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:17,120
I think it's like...

2206
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:17,760
one guy.

2207
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:19,300
Not gonna lie, I'm pretty sure.

2208
02:26:19,580 --> 02:26:21,100
Wait, he just walked behind.

2209
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:23,320
There's no way.

2210
02:26:25,980 --> 02:26:28,300
He literally just walked in the back.

2211
02:26:33,540 --> 02:26:35,500
But where is this other team?

2212
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:37,720
Oh, shit.

2213
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:38,780
Come back.

2214
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:39,200
Look, look, look.

2215
02:26:39,380 --> 02:26:39,600
I'm helping.

2216
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:40,060
I'm helping.

2217
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:41,200
I'm covering.

2218
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:45,840
I'm covering.

2219
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:50,860
Jesus Christ.

2220
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:52,160
Guys, cheer!

2221
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:56,840
Fucking chea!

2222
02:26:59,040 --> 02:26:59,760
Wait, what?

2223
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:05,180
I heard people.

2224
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:06,440
Right behind us.

2225
02:27:07,140 --> 02:27:07,660
Oh, God.

2226
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:09,340
Give me a shot at while I do this.

2227
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:11,120
They're, like, right here.

2228
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:17,490
What is he trying to do?

2229
02:27:17,610 --> 02:27:18,430
Waste our ammo?

2230
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:21,110
Like, what is he trying to do?

2231
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:28,030
Oh, my God.

2232
02:27:28,070 --> 02:27:29,090
These guys are so annoying.

2233
02:27:29,150 --> 02:27:30,010
No, they are so fucking annoying.

2234
02:27:30,030 --> 02:27:34,070
annoying So annoying.

2235
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:43,030
Holy shit Guys fucking chill Don't have a lot of shields.

2236
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:45,630
Okay, I have zero shield cells left.

2237
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:45,950
Okay

2238
02:27:50,630 --> 02:27:52,850
Bro, how do you still have ammo?

2239
02:27:57,490 --> 02:28:07,590
Oh my god, bro fuck off The fucking jiggle peek from the
crypto Are you serious?

2240
02:28:08,250 --> 02:28:11,070
The crypto has a goddamn jiggle peak.

2241
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:13,450
That's actually so funny.

2242
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:16,670
Okay, we'll put it here.

2243
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:21,790
Alright, here we go.

2244
02:28:23,770 --> 02:28:23,810
There.

2245
02:28:24,090 --> 02:28:25,330
What a waste of a crypto.

2246
02:28:28,530 --> 02:28:29,710
Wait, what?

2247
02:28:30,030 --> 02:28:32,050
Okay, I'm gonna cover the left side just in case.

2248
02:28:32,590 --> 02:28:33,490
What was that?

2249
02:28:38,930 --> 02:28:39,970
Are you serious?

2250
02:28:39,990 --> 02:28:44,990
What a fucking move.

2251
02:28:49,090 --> 02:28:51,570
I'm gonna I'm gonna do this just in case.

2252
02:28:53,910 --> 02:28:54,630
Wait, are they dead?

There he goes.

2308
02:32:22,490 --> 02:32:23,850
Surely they'll be fine, right?

2309
02:32:24,590 --> 02:32:26,150
I should, like... Wow!

2310
02:32:27,150 --> 02:32:27,850

Alright.

2315
02:32:33,870 --> 02:32:35,450
Finally, I can leave as well.

2316
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:39,610
This is a different game.

2317
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:42,830
Nice.

2318
02:32:43,050 --> 02:32:43,470
Oh, my god.

2319
02:32:43,530 --> 02:32:45,830
I can feel the fucking R&D I'm getting there.

2320
02:32:48,310 --> 02:32:49,330
Do peek me right here.

2321
02:32:58,870 --> 02:32:59,210
Okay.

2322
02:33:00,790 --> 02:33:00,950
Yeah.

2323
02:33:01,370 --> 02:33:02,910
That's what he did.

2324
02:33:03,490 --> 02:33:04,330
I did.

2325
02:33:05,870 --> 02:33:07,150
He did.

2326
02:33:07,150 --> 02:33:07,190
He did.

2327
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:08,630
He did.

2328
02:33:08,830 --> 02:33:09,470
He did.

2329
02:33:09,470 --> 02:33:09,490
He did.

2330
02:33:09,490 --> 02:33:12,410
How is I supposed to know that he knew I was there?

2331
02:33:13,790 --> 02:33:17,230
Now my pro and dozer is not trust or is he?

2332
02:33:18,310 --> 02:33:18,810
How is that?

2333
02:33:18,910 --> 02:33:19,650
Oh, and they're running?

2334
02:33:19,870 --> 02:33:20,870
These cowards.

2335
02:33:21,250 --> 02:33:22,250
I wish they...

2336
02:33:22,250 --> 02:33:24,050
These fucking cowards.

2337
02:33:25,490 --> 02:33:27,650
Not even two seconds.

2338
02:33:28,270 --> 02:33:29,810
Do you think he saw me, guys?

2339
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:31,910
I can't believe it.

2340
02:33:32,130 --> 02:33:33,370
They're fucking running?

2341
02:33:33,850 --> 02:33:34,670
In a pub?

2342
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:36,470
What are you?

2343
02:33:39,970 --> 02:33:41,570
Can't believe it.

2344
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,040
If I don't get ultra, I leave.

2345
02:33:46,380 --> 02:33:46,520
Oh.

2346
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:47,580

Nice.

2350
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:06,920
I'm glad Ducky is keeping to the script today.

2351
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:12,480
Alter or leave.

2352
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:15,080
Alter or leave.

2353
02:34:20,090 --> 02:34:21,490

2361
02:34:36,010 --> 02:34:36,350
No.

2362
02:34:37,850 --> 02:34:38,450

Alright.

2364
02:34:41,010 --> 02:34:42,450
Ultra or troll exactly.

2365
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:45,050
Not nicely possessive.

2366
02:34:45,870 --> 02:34:46,390
What do you mean?

2367
02:34:46,550 --> 02:34:47,910

I got shot by three different people.

2376
02:35:39,570 --> 02:35:40,110
Look at that.

2377
02:35:40,590 --> 02:35:43,090
They have to be squatted up.

2378
02:35:43,490 --> 02:35:45,010
Bro, there's no way.

2379
02:35:45,150 --> 02:35:49,650
There's no way that team is like not in a voice call right
now.

2380
02:35:49,710 --> 02:35:51,650
That was so coordinated.

2381
02:35:52,230 --> 02:35:57,570
Okay, but guys, that shit was incredibly coordinated.

2382
02:35:57,730 --> 02:35:59,850

02:36:35,230 --> 02:36:38,810
Like, we wish your teammates are like this.

2388
02:36:39,770 --> 02:36:40,810
They prepped this for a week.

2389
02:36:40,910 --> 02:36:42,870
Dude, I feel like they had a plan, too.

2390

That is sick.

2394
02:36:53,370 --> 02:36:55,910
Did they say something like, wait, this is a streamer?

2395
02:36:56,050 --> 02:36:56,830
And I left.

2396
02:36:58,390 --> 02:36:59,930
It's like a Wild West site.

02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:09,230
Yeah Yeah, it's like a it's like a wild west sighting there

So it's not my fault if we're listening in.

02:40:33,590 --> 02:40:34,550
You're worried.

02:40:37,970 --> 02:40:40,550
4K people watching Bros Day.

2428
02:40:41,050 --> 02:40:42,170
Look, we're judging them.

2429
02:40:42,930 --> 02:40:44,450
Guys, I just don't want to hear it.

2430
02:40:44,510 --> 02:40:47,250
Don't want to be in an awkward third wheel again.

2431
02:40:47,810 --> 02:40:52,690
Like, okay, if there was like a little like intermission
between it, that's fine.

2432
02:40:52,790 --> 02:40:53,410

She's literally mean!

2442
02:41:43,410 --> 02:41:45,530
I bet this man doesn't even speak Cantonese.

2443
02:41:46,210 --> 02:41:47,030
I'm going to take us to death.

2444
02:41:48,230 --> 02:41:49,990
Okay, what is death number two?

02:42:08,830 --> 02:42:10,090
Death number two.

02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:12,390
No altar.

2454
02:42:12,910 --> 02:42:13,690
Then death.

2455
02:42:14,330 --> 02:42:15,270
We must go.

2456
02:42:15,990 --> 02:42:17,590
We got a lot of wins though today.

2457
02:42:20,290 --> 02:42:20,730
Okay.

Right in my mouth, you go.

2463
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:09,080

2464
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:11,260
Alright, nice.

2465
02:43:12,860 --> 02:43:14,060

02:43:14,060 --> 02:43:15,040
Oh, she has a podcast?

2467
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:20,380
Where are they?

2468
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:23,380
I'm gonna scare that I don't know where they are.

2469
02:43:24,260 --> 02:43:25,640
I'll give you an amp first.

2470
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:27,160
Wait, they're not...

2471
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:27,600
Who did I...

2472
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:28,880
Did I give nobody amp?

2473
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:29,800
Whoops.

2474
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:32,840
That's awkward.

2475
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:34,320
Oh, great.

2476
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:35,400
I wasted it.

2477
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:37,260
Oh, what?

2478
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:38,140
Where are they?

2479
02:43:42,080 --> 02:43:43,280
Where the fuck are they?

2480
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:45,800
I know there's another team here.

2481
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:48,900
I know there is.

2482
02:43:49,020 --> 02:43:50,260
I'm too scared to go down.

2483
02:43:52,320 --> 02:43:52,880
Oh, my God.

2484
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:55,100
I knew I heard them.

2485
02:43:55,160 --> 02:43:56,120
They're right below us.

2486
02:43:58,020 --> 02:43:58,880
They're right below us.

2487
02:43:59,020 --> 02:44:00,160
Mr. Rat, go in there, Mr. Rat.

2488
02:44:00,840 --> 02:44:01,280
fucking right.

2489
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:03,660
But they didn't expect a second person.

2490
02:44:09,700 --> 02:44:10,780
That's fucking right.

2491
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:11,980
Or the third.

2492
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:15,460
Oh, yeah?

2493
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:17,320
I can go up there, too.

2494
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:21,220
That's fucking right.

2495
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:23,340
That's fucking right.

2496
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,780
Give me your money.

2497
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:26,440
Give me your lunch money.

2498
02:44:31,970 --> 02:44:32,970
Bro, I'm trusting my bro.

2499
02:44:34,650 --> 02:44:36,390
Just giving my daily trust.

2500
02:44:38,310 --> 02:44:39,190
All right, let's see.

2501
02:44:39,290 --> 02:44:40,310
Let's try the wingbang again.

2502
02:44:43,410 --> 02:44:43,850
Nice.

2503
02:44:47,270 --> 02:44:48,730
I'm locked in.

2504
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:50,830
$5 for Doki.

2505
02:44:50,930 --> 02:44:52,290
JT, thank you for the super chat.

2506
02:44:52,410 --> 02:44:53,030
Thank you.

2507
02:44:53,030 --> 02:44:53,150
Thank you.

2508
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:54,250
I appreciate it, man.

2509
02:44:54,330 --> 02:44:55,190
Thank you so much.

2510
02:44:56,310 --> 02:44:57,710
All right, let's get rid of these.

2511
02:44:59,130 --> 02:44:59,470
Surely.

2512
02:44:59,750 --> 02:45:00,650
Yeah, it's Trustnut.

2513
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:02,270
I told you.

2514
02:45:02,530 --> 02:45:03,670
It's not toxic.

2515
02:45:03,870 --> 02:45:04,990
I'm trusting him.

2516
02:45:07,950 --> 02:45:23,130
all right let's see what's the oh oh wait i hear people
they're like right here i hear the res the tea and tea bag

2517
02:45:23,130 --> 02:45:34,610

somebody gets it now oh shit there's a fight oh my god

2518
02:45:34,610 --> 02:45:36,130
pillow princess you go girl

2519
02:45:39,450 --> 02:45:40,410
Watch this.

2520
02:45:41,870 --> 02:45:42,750
I'm gonna take it?

2521
02:45:52,530 --> 02:45:54,810
This is not the chestnut.

2522
02:45:58,530 --> 02:46:00,590
You see, you wait until they're done.

2523
02:46:00,750 --> 02:46:01,850
You wait until they res.

2524
02:46:02,350 --> 02:46:03,950
So, like...

2525
02:46:03,950 --> 02:46:05,730
So you don't have to do anything at all.

2526
02:46:06,150 --> 02:46:07,190
That's my favorite part.

2527
02:46:07,790 --> 02:46:09,390
When you just wait for them to res.

2528
02:46:10,050 --> 02:46:11,770
So you don't actually have to do real work.

2529
02:46:11,950 --> 02:46:16,710
When it comes to fighting, I feel like right here I see
them.

2530
02:46:17,310 --> 02:46:17,890
Where's my portal?

2531
02:46:18,570 --> 02:46:19,410
Where's my alt?

2532
02:46:22,410 --> 02:46:23,610
What the fuck?

2533
02:46:23,810 --> 02:46:24,930
Who is this guy?

2534
02:46:31,010 --> 02:46:32,810
What the fuck is this random guy?

2535
02:46:35,790 --> 02:46:37,830
Okay, I think I might accidentally need myself.

2536
02:46:39,430 --> 02:46:43,250
I have to make sure I don't accidentally need myself.

2537
02:46:43,970 --> 02:46:44,570
Where are they?

2538
02:46:45,470 --> 02:46:47,430
Wait, where did he res?

2539
02:46:52,930 --> 02:46:53,470
What the matter?

2540
02:46:53,730 --> 02:46:55,150
Okay, I was gonna say it.

2541
02:46:55,150 --> 02:46:58,730
I thought the guy that fucking jumped in was my own team.

2542
02:46:59,570 --> 02:47:02,410
Like, I was like, what the fuck?

2543
02:47:03,490 --> 02:47:05,290
Bro, I'm on your team, bro.

2544
02:47:09,490 --> 02:47:14,750
I was like, I can't believe my team didn't fucking jump in
with me.

2545
02:47:15,150 --> 02:47:16,450
That's fucked up, bro.

2546
02:47:17,710 --> 02:47:18,270
Sacrifice.

2547
02:47:18,330 --> 02:47:19,150
I'm a conduit.

2548
02:47:19,770 --> 02:47:21,190
be sacrificing my life.

2549
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:25,130
I could have played Backline, but I didn't.

2550
02:47:25,890 --> 02:47:27,270
Because I trusted my team.

2551
02:47:29,270 --> 02:47:30,410
I'm so messed up.

2552
02:47:32,690 --> 02:47:33,950
Did I hear anything?

2553
02:47:34,050 --> 02:47:34,890
No, that wasn't it.

2554
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:36,530
I heard something.

2555
02:47:37,690 --> 02:47:39,070
Oh, it's so messed up.

2556
02:47:39,910 --> 02:47:42,130
They're like, they went in there with them.

2557
02:47:42,350 --> 02:47:44,650
Like, I went in there and they didn't follow me up.

2558
02:47:46,590 --> 02:47:47,990
I have too many mid-kits.

2559
02:47:50,130 --> 02:47:51,450
Alright, let's go to zone.

2560
02:47:52,650 --> 02:47:53,290
Wait, I could grab...

2561
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:55,050
I'm gonna grab this armor, and then I'll go to zone.

2562
02:47:57,030 --> 02:47:57,370
Yeah.

2563
02:47:58,170 --> 02:47:58,950
It wasn't...

2564
02:47:58,950 --> 02:48:00,870
It didn't, like, reciprocate.

2565
02:48:02,290 --> 02:48:02,690
That...

2566
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:04,850
You have to make sure you both reciprocate.

2567
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:08,590
There, like, a railing here?

2568
02:48:08,830 --> 02:48:09,430
Nice, there is.

2569
02:48:09,610 --> 02:48:09,850
Nice.

2570
02:48:10,070 --> 02:48:10,350
Okay.

2571
02:48:11,030 --> 02:48:12,410
Notice this isn't on the map anymore.

2572
02:48:12,490 --> 02:48:13,170
The railings?

2573
02:48:15,250 --> 02:48:17,050
Usually they're on the map, but they're not.

2574
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:19,530
Or, like, this one wasn't.

2575
02:48:20,450 --> 02:48:21,250
Oh!

2576
02:48:21,450 --> 02:48:22,650
Who hit me?

2577
02:48:23,610 --> 02:48:25,510
Oh, he has red armor.

2578
02:48:29,350 --> 02:48:32,090
Oh, shit.

2579
02:48:38,580 --> 02:48:40,780
That's when you know they've been gaming.

2580
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:43,740
Where are they?

2581
02:48:47,260 --> 02:48:48,720
It's right there.

2582
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:49,460
Let's see.

2583
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:53,440
No!

2584
02:48:54,420 --> 02:49:06,460
get closer not that close I didn't mean you I didn't mean
you I meant the under lifeline I didn't mean this pathfinder

2585
02:49:06,460 --> 02:49:27,700

different guy oh god oh god please I can't

2586
02:49:33,390 --> 02:49:34,030

2587
02:49:34,610 --> 02:49:35,150
Oh my god!

2588
02:49:35,470 --> 02:49:36,150
Thank you.

2589
02:49:38,230 --> 02:49:39,150
What the fuck?

2590
02:49:39,410 --> 02:49:40,290
I made it.

2591
02:49:41,210 --> 02:49:42,270
Oh my god.

2592
02:49:42,790 --> 02:49:44,530
I fucking made it.

2593
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:44,830
Run.

2594
02:49:45,350 --> 02:49:45,630
Run.

2595
02:49:47,690 --> 02:49:49,250
That was close.

2596
02:49:50,130 --> 02:49:50,890
That was actually...

2597
02:49:50,890 --> 02:49:51,510
That was clutch.

2598
02:49:52,390 --> 02:49:53,130
That was a good ult.

2599
02:49:54,190 --> 02:49:54,690
What a...

2600
02:49:54,690 --> 02:49:55,450
My hero.

2601
02:49:56,070 --> 02:49:57,530
That was actually an incredible ult.

2602
02:49:59,870 --> 02:50:01,010
She saved my life.

2603
02:50:02,950 --> 02:50:06,250
Do we follow him on the seats of her cheeks?

2604
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:09,030
I did not expect her to actually help me.

2605
02:50:09,870 --> 02:50:10,490
That's insane.

2606
02:50:11,690 --> 02:50:12,250
Alright, let's go.

2607
02:50:14,510 --> 02:50:17,010
Surely we're not gonna let everybody know we're here, right?

2608
02:50:19,510 --> 02:50:20,630
Oh, wee!

2609
02:50:22,190 --> 02:50:23,170
The trust.

2610
02:50:24,170 --> 02:50:25,750
Told you in the trust bag.

2611
02:50:27,310 --> 02:50:28,410
I knew it existed.

2612
02:50:29,490 --> 02:50:30,570
I'm gonna grab this too.

2613
02:50:31,490 --> 02:50:49,370
red armor all right we're in zone i need to craft some bat a
bat for wasting my bats there earlier yeah all right got my

2614
02:50:49,370 --> 02:51:00,540
bat that's actually crazy though the fucking uh the fucking
all actually saved my life because i'm sure those are two

2615
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:02,800
teams that had to be two teams.

2616
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:03,680
There's no way.

2617
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:07,180
There's no fucking way it was not two teams.

2618
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:10,460
Where could they be?

2619
02:51:13,580 --> 02:51:13,860
Oh.

2620
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:14,520
Care package.

2621
02:51:15,660 --> 02:51:16,540
What's in it?

2622
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:18,480
What's in the care package?

2623
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:19,340
Sir, look up.

2624
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:20,680
Look up, sir.

2625
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:24,360
Look up and tell me what's in the package.

2626
02:51:26,720 --> 02:51:27,200
Please!

2627
02:51:27,720 --> 02:51:29,480
All you have to do is look up!

2628
02:51:29,500 --> 02:51:33,040
I'm gonna please rat mr.

2629
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:46,960
rat That's all you have to do just look up That's all I want
Oh, okay, there we go.

2630
02:51:47,020 --> 02:51:47,920
He looked up guys.

2631
02:51:48,260 --> 02:51:55,960
It only took him 20 years But he finally did it He
accomplished something that no man has ever done before

2632
02:51:55,960 --> 02:51:57,320
looking up.

2633
02:51:57,720 --> 02:51:59,480
Okay, that was a sick shot from how far?

2634
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:00,760
I was looking at.

2635
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:03,060
I should be at all.

2636
02:52:03,180 --> 02:52:07,480
I thought that would be like a armor upgrade.

2637
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:11,680
Where is he?

2638
02:52:14,120 --> 02:52:15,440
Get shit on.

2639
02:52:16,940 --> 02:52:17,800
Get shit on.

2640
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:20,000
Alright.

2641
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:22,060
Gamers don't look up.

2642
02:52:22,140 --> 02:52:23,960
He accomplished something new today.

2643
02:52:26,020 --> 02:52:26,760
Is that an angle here?

2644
02:52:26,900 --> 02:52:27,340
I do.

2645
02:52:28,320 --> 02:52:33,260
Oh, that would have been so cool if I hit that like over
there.

2646
02:52:34,220 --> 02:52:35,000
Let's see.

2647
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:37,000
Wait, what?

2648
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:38,540
Oh, shit, Mr. Rat!

2649
02:52:38,900 --> 02:52:40,080
The world got you!

2650
02:52:44,140 --> 02:52:47,160
They're so, like, they can't crawl up.

2651
02:52:48,300 --> 02:52:48,660
Nice.

2652
02:52:49,400 --> 02:52:50,900
I just didn't want them to crawl up.

2653
02:52:51,020 --> 02:52:52,380
Oh, wait, there's another fight here, too.

2654
02:52:55,400 --> 02:52:57,800
Wait, I want to fight this guy as well.

2655
02:53:00,060 --> 02:53:03,380
They're, like, from each other.

2656
02:53:06,900 --> 02:53:08,380
And there's the Lifeline as well.

2657
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:11,280
Hey, the Lifeline team won?

2658
02:53:11,440 --> 02:53:14,340
Oh my god, it's the goddamn triple- Bro, fuck off!

2659
02:53:14,840 --> 02:53:17,500
It's the goddamn triple-take Lifeline!

2660
02:53:21,080 --> 02:53:24,560
I'm trying to figure out where, like...

2661
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:25,780
There we go.

2662
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:27,240
Yeah, fuck you.

2663
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:28,640
Thanks for the red armor loser.

2664
02:53:29,580 --> 02:53:30,520
Oh, shit!

2665
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:33,620
Wow!

2666
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:36,040
Let me in.

2667
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:38,240
Let me in.

2668
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:43,980
Wait, let me in.

2669
02:53:43,980 --> 02:53:45,080
Wait, is he only shot at now?

2670
02:53:47,140 --> 02:53:49,640
Okay, that was a little fucking scary.

2671
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:54,940
Are we just gonna go to zone?

2672
02:53:55,460 --> 02:53:55,760
Alright.

2673
02:53:56,400 --> 02:53:57,520
I can deal with that.

2674
02:53:58,920 --> 02:54:00,480
I just have better...

2675
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:02,640
I just have high ground, you know?

2676
02:54:03,080 --> 02:54:04,240
We love high ground here.

2677
02:54:06,080 --> 02:54:06,460
Wait, are we fighting?

2678
02:54:06,480 --> 02:54:06,800
fighting?

2679
02:54:07,380 --> 02:54:07,920
Where are we doing?

2680
02:54:08,340 --> 02:54:09,720
What's the decision, Mr. Rat?

2681
02:54:11,380 --> 02:54:12,320
Let me in.

2682
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:15,940
I feel like this person actually knows how to play Alter
more than me.

2683
02:54:16,660 --> 02:54:17,120
Not sure.

2684
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:19,540
My portals are just Hell Marys.

2685
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:22,080
It's just like, will this work?

2686
02:54:24,300 --> 02:54:27,280
Those are those are my... Whoa!

2687
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:27,880
Shit!

2688
02:54:28,740 --> 02:54:29,340
Oh.

2689
02:54:30,320 --> 02:54:31,480
Guess I...

2690
02:54:31,480 --> 02:54:33,060
Guess I leave.

2691
02:54:34,580 --> 02:54:35,640
Guess I leave.

2692
02:54:37,140 --> 02:54:38,500
Yes, I leave.

2693
02:54:39,080 --> 02:54:39,480
Bye.

2694
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:43,680
Alright, here you go.

2695
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:48,000
Yeah, her portos are for some reason 100% better than mine.

2696
02:54:48,300 --> 02:54:50,320
I don't know how she does it.

2697
02:54:52,140 --> 02:54:55,600
For some very odd reason, they really know how to port them.

2698
02:55:00,730 --> 02:55:02,790
I want them to push into the other team.

2699
02:55:04,870 --> 02:55:06,450
Bro, stop!

2700
02:55:07,750 --> 02:55:08,350
Stop!

2701
02:55:09,710 --> 02:55:10,150
Stop!

2702
02:55:11,930 --> 02:55:13,530
They're running at each other, they're running each other!

2703
02:55:15,750 --> 02:55:17,350
Wait, we should run at each other!

2704
02:55:18,830 --> 02:55:20,030
They're running, they're running!

2705
02:55:20,230 --> 02:55:21,190
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

2706
02:55:22,690 --> 02:55:24,190
They're not running at each other anymore.

2707
02:55:30,900 --> 02:55:32,460
Okay, I'll take this.

2708
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:34,240
What the fuck, he's so fast!

2709
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:36,540
He's so fast!

2710
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:41,940
Did you see that?

2711
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:46,440
He's so fast.

2712
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:49,440
Bro, he's zoomed.

2713
02:55:53,140 --> 02:55:54,340
I cracked him.

2714
02:55:55,420 --> 02:55:57,320
He was so fucking fast, man.

2715
02:56:04,810 --> 02:56:05,850
I got him.

2716
02:56:08,210 --> 02:56:09,630
I don't want him to get raised.

2717
02:56:12,510 --> 02:56:12,770
Okay.

2718
02:56:14,550 --> 02:56:14,790
What?

2719
02:56:15,690 --> 02:56:16,790
Oh my god, he helped.

2720
02:56:17,450 --> 02:56:18,370
Guys, please.

2721
02:56:18,550 --> 02:56:20,710
Please don't lose this.

2722
02:56:20,810 --> 02:56:22,090
Please don't lose.

2723
02:56:22,210 --> 02:56:23,510
No, they're gonna rest.

2724
02:56:23,870 --> 02:56:24,670
Where's my team?

2725
02:56:25,510 --> 02:56:25,530
No!

2726
02:56:28,570 --> 02:56:28,590
Rest.

2727
02:56:29,890 --> 02:56:31,490
No, guys, no!

2728
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:34,960
No, that's their route.

2729
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:36,260
Where's my team?

2730
02:56:37,080 --> 02:56:37,740
No!

2731
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:42,080
Bro, if we rushed them, we win!

2732
02:56:42,980 --> 02:56:44,440
I really gotta knock.

2733
02:56:44,800 --> 02:56:46,700
I gotta knock for us.

2734
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:47,860
No!

2735
02:56:48,300 --> 02:56:48,840
Oh my god.

2736
02:56:50,710 --> 02:56:51,370
Thanks.

2737
02:56:51,790 --> 02:56:53,550
I can't believe it.

2738
02:56:54,310 --> 02:56:56,010
Bro, it's over.

2739
02:56:56,250 --> 02:56:58,750
This is why if I don't get ulterior hits over.

2740
02:56:59,110 --> 02:57:00,970
I gotta knock at everything.

2741
02:57:01,470 --> 02:57:02,690
I did so much damage.

2742
02:57:03,050 --> 02:57:05,010
I did so much damage.

2743
02:57:08,010 --> 02:57:09,970
I did so much damage.

2744
02:57:11,650 --> 02:57:13,190
Where was my team?

2745
02:57:13,490 --> 02:57:17,030
Look, all I'm saying was I did my part.

2746
02:57:17,390 --> 02:57:23,470
I did my part of this game.

2747
02:57:24,190 --> 02:57:25,050
We'll do one more.

2748
02:57:25,090 --> 02:57:26,990
We'll do one more trios and then one more solo.

2749
02:57:28,250 --> 02:57:29,430
It was so winnable.

2750
02:57:30,110 --> 02:57:31,370
It was so fucking winnable.

2751
02:57:35,910 --> 02:57:36,830
I fucking...

2752
02:57:36,830 --> 02:57:37,490
She didn't trust.

2753
02:57:37,570 --> 02:57:38,750
Yeah, I held my hand out.

2754
02:57:42,290 --> 02:57:43,290
I held...

2755
02:57:45,850 --> 02:57:47,230
I don't stand.

2756
02:57:47,530 --> 02:57:48,910
I don't even trust.

2757
02:57:53,890 --> 02:57:55,190
Oh my god.

2758
02:57:57,370 --> 02:58:02,230
Okay, my fucking bow check aim was fucking crazy.

2759
02:58:02,390 --> 02:58:06,730
I was actually going nuclear there with my bow check.

2760
02:58:07,250 --> 02:58:08,820
I can't believe it.

2761
02:58:12,810 --> 02:58:16,630
How could they do this to me?

2762
02:58:23,500 --> 02:58:24,910
All right.

2763
02:58:26,310 --> 02:58:26,990
This is it.

2764
02:58:28,850 --> 02:58:29,210
waste.

2765
02:58:29,410 --> 02:58:29,790
I know!

2766
02:58:30,170 --> 02:58:31,250
They wasted my effort!

2767
02:58:32,130 --> 02:58:35,190
Okay, my favorite part was the fucking guy that was zooming
though.

2768
02:58:35,730 --> 02:58:42,690
That, the fucking ulti that just fucking zoom as they crawl
to their fucking death.

2769
02:58:44,490 --> 02:58:46,750
I know, how could it not trust me?

2770
02:58:47,550 --> 02:58:52,210
Like, this is the face of somebody that's trustworthy and
wouldn't let you die.

2771
02:58:56,880 --> 02:58:58,220
have flatline.

2772
02:58:58,320 --> 02:59:00,220
Oh my gosh, I haven't used flatline so long.

2773
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:04,460
Let's see.

2774
02:59:06,400 --> 02:59:06,720
Okay.

2775
02:59:06,980 --> 02:59:07,240
Nice.

2776
02:59:07,400 --> 02:59:09,080
I needed the hollow on the flattie.

2777
02:59:11,700 --> 02:59:13,840
I don't like it on this.

2778
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:15,320
Alright.

2779
02:59:15,580 --> 02:59:16,080
Here we go.

2780
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:16,760
Oh, shit.

2781
02:59:17,380 --> 02:59:17,880
Creepy Slay.

2782
02:59:17,980 --> 02:59:18,540
Don't worry.

2783
02:59:19,060 --> 02:59:19,680
I got you.

2784
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:21,580
Trust.

2785
02:59:24,520 --> 02:59:24,880
See?

2786
02:59:25,060 --> 02:59:26,720
I hit one shot out of four.

2787
02:59:31,410 --> 02:59:32,330
Oh my god.

2788
02:59:32,410 --> 02:59:32,570
Wait.

2789
02:59:32,830 --> 02:59:33,550
He needs help.

2790
02:59:36,290 --> 02:59:36,430
Okay.

2791
02:59:38,770 --> 02:59:39,750
I'm coming over.

2792
02:59:40,350 --> 02:59:41,890
I don't know where this is gonna go.

2793
02:59:46,940 --> 02:59:47,320
There.

2794
02:59:47,620 --> 02:59:48,580
I told you!

2795
02:59:49,280 --> 02:59:49,800
Trust!

2796
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:52,840
Nice.

2797
02:59:53,160 --> 02:59:53,800
We did it.

2798
02:59:55,400 --> 02:59:55,920
Easy.

2799
02:59:57,160 --> 02:59:58,000
Fucking easy.

2800
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:01,020
It's all about the trust, baby.

2801
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:03,120
Okay, extend highlights, reduce, alter.

2802
03:00:03,140 --> 03:00:04,400
I don't think I need the alt.

2803
03:00:04,500 --> 03:00:05,440
I like the...

2804
03:00:05,740 --> 03:00:12,720

2806
03:00:30,940 --> 03:00:36,860

myself as well.

2807
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:40,660
Alright.

2808
03:00:40,880 --> 03:00:42,080
Wait, they're all taking the rail.

2809
03:00:44,280 --> 03:00:45,680
Let me, let me on.

2810
03:00:45,820 --> 03:00:46,740
Let me on the rail.

2811
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:48,720
I want to get on the ride.

2812
03:00:49,620 --> 03:00:51,420
I want to get on the crazy ride.

2813
03:00:52,980 --> 03:00:54,900
That's all about coping.

2814
03:00:55,280 --> 03:00:56,740
I'll hit, might hit, okay, look.

2815
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:58,500
I hit at least one shot.

2816
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:02,500
And that's more, more than more than

2817
03:01:05,740 --> 03:01:06,940
It's more than chat.

2818
03:01:10,200 --> 03:01:11,480
All I'm saying.

2819
03:01:14,440 --> 03:01:14,780
All right.

2820
03:01:15,400 --> 03:01:15,740
Let's see.

2821
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:17,220
Woo!

2822
03:01:20,860 --> 03:01:21,340
Whoa!

2823
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:24,940
All I'm saying, I don't know.

2824
03:01:25,120 --> 03:01:26,280
That's all I'm saying.

2825
03:01:26,420 --> 03:01:26,880
I don't know.

2826
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:28,680
Wait, people died here.

2827
03:01:28,820 --> 03:01:29,800
So I can steal this loot.

2828
03:01:31,880 --> 03:01:32,180
Yoink.

2829
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:35,580
Oh my god, look at all this free loot.

2830
03:01:35,740 --> 03:01:36,980
Wait, this is amazing.

2831
03:01:40,860 --> 03:01:41,140
Noink.

2832
03:01:42,300 --> 03:01:42,860
Where?

2833
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:50,000
Where?

2834
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:51,860
Oh, there!

2835
03:01:53,700 --> 03:01:55,440
Okay, let me bring up the other gun.

2836
03:01:57,520 --> 03:01:59,280
Let me bring...

2837
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:01,200
Let me bring up the gun that I...

2838
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:03,560
That I can actually hit.

2839
03:02:08,820 --> 03:02:10,220
Okay, there we go.

2840
03:02:13,900 --> 03:02:14,500
Yay.

2841
03:02:15,300 --> 03:02:16,820
Look, I still hit those.

2842
03:02:17,560 --> 03:02:19,060
I still hit it, guys.

2843
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:24,260
Shit, I actually tabbed out.

2844
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:28,060
We've all been there before.

2845
03:02:31,100 --> 03:02:31,820
Okay, nice.

2846
03:02:32,420 --> 03:02:33,540
Watch your craft the bat.

2847
03:02:36,340 --> 03:02:36,860
Yay.

2848
03:02:37,540 --> 03:02:40,100
Anything else I haven't looted yet?

2849
03:02:41,260 --> 03:02:42,320
Oh, What the fuck?

2850
03:02:42,520 --> 03:02:42,940
I should...

2851
03:02:42,940 --> 03:02:43,300
Whoa!

2852
03:02:43,740 --> 03:02:44,400
Wait, I don't like that.

2853
03:02:44,620 --> 03:02:44,960
That's funny.

2854
03:02:45,480 --> 03:02:48,380
They, like, fucking spat out a battery in front of me.

2855
03:02:49,420 --> 03:02:49,860
Let's see.

2856
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:50,600
That's enough.

2857
03:02:51,360 --> 03:02:52,560
You guys think I have too many bats?

2858
03:02:52,900 --> 03:02:53,400
No, right?

2859
03:02:54,420 --> 03:02:54,820
Nah.

2860
03:02:55,500 --> 03:02:57,080
I should grab a sniper, too.

2861
03:02:58,560 --> 03:02:59,280
Alright, here we go.

2862
03:03:00,780 --> 03:03:01,060
Oh, shit.

2863
03:03:01,140 --> 03:03:01,380
Don't worry.

2864
03:03:01,420 --> 03:03:01,700
I'm here.

2865
03:03:02,780 --> 03:03:04,540
I'm gonna put this here.

2866
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:07,900
It's alright.

2867
03:03:08,240 --> 03:03:09,940
We can fall back if we need to.

2868
03:03:10,640 --> 03:03:11,440
I believe.

2869
03:03:12,960 --> 03:03:15,320
I feel like we don't need that many.

2870
03:03:15,640 --> 03:03:17,560
Okay, I definitely need more shield cells, though.

2871
03:03:18,480 --> 03:03:18,500
Where?

2872
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:20,340
There?

2873
03:03:32,260 --> 03:03:34,580
Even Octane was like, what

2874
03:03:39,220 --> 03:03:40,540
the...

2875
03:03:41,540 --> 03:03:43,760
Even Octane was like, hmm.

2876
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:47,500
Oh my god.

2877
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:48,460
Oh,

2878
03:03:51,850 --> 03:03:52,510
he's so low.

2879
03:03:57,360 --> 03:03:59,280
Oh my god, he's so low too.

2880
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:02,360
Oh god, the last guy's on me.

2881
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:08,500
Oh god, he's not gonna look at me, right?

2882
03:04:09,400 --> 03:04:11,660
Bro, I'm so confused.

2883
03:04:15,900 --> 03:04:18,320
He's like, where the fuck did this go?

2884
03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:25,680
And he was like, what the fuck?

2885
03:04:27,800 --> 03:04:29,100
Did I hear him?

2886
03:04:32,830 --> 03:04:34,730
I hear... What?!

2887
03:04:37,320 --> 03:04:39,400
Oh, he was on me this entire time.

2888
03:04:39,980 --> 03:04:41,340
Wait, this is a different guy!

2889
03:04:42,260 --> 03:04:43,880
He wasn't on me this entire time!

2890
03:04:43,980 --> 03:04:45,240
He was a new guy!

2891
03:04:51,770 --> 03:04:52,170
There,

2892
03:05:03,640 --> 03:05:04,080
he's dead.

2893
03:05:04,840 --> 03:05:05,360
There you go.

2894
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:07,260
I have to think for a little bit.

2895
03:05:09,840 --> 03:05:10,740
There you go, we're fine.

2896
03:05:11,300 --> 03:05:13,320
I gotta think, but it's okay.

2897
03:05:16,120 --> 03:05:16,800
Let's see.

2898
03:05:17,060 --> 03:05:17,860
We did it.

2899
03:05:18,820 --> 03:05:20,360
We fucking did it, guys.

2900
03:05:20,480 --> 03:05:21,540
We're our team.

2901
03:05:22,700 --> 03:05:23,040
Yay!

2902
03:05:23,880 --> 03:05:25,780
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of...

2903
03:05:25,780 --> 03:05:27,500
It's not that I don't believe in myself.

2904
03:05:28,160 --> 03:05:28,820
It's that like...

2905
03:05:30,620 --> 03:05:34,400
Guys, it's not about a lack of belief at the moment.

2906
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:38,760
It's just that I think it'd be better if I use this gun
instead.

2907
03:05:40,820 --> 03:05:42,240
Just a little better.

2908
03:05:43,280 --> 03:05:45,380
I totally believe in myself.

2909
03:05:48,800 --> 03:05:49,780
Okay, let's see.

2910
03:05:50,060 --> 03:05:51,160
Is there like a 3x?

2911
03:05:51,260 --> 03:05:51,980
Ooh, there is.

2912
03:05:53,140 --> 03:05:54,160
Oh, whoops.

2913
03:05:54,360 --> 03:05:55,620
I got rid of my 2x.

2914
03:05:56,900 --> 03:05:57,540
Whoops.

2915
03:05:59,440 --> 03:05:59,700
Okay.

2916
03:06:00,600 --> 03:06:01,240
No!

2917
03:06:01,980 --> 03:06:04,180
I got rid of my 2x!

2918
03:06:04,460 --> 03:06:06,440
I forgot to fuck up!

2919
03:06:07,100 --> 03:06:08,820
It's so far away!

2920
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:17,920
It's so far away!

2921
03:06:20,380 --> 03:06:22,400
Jokey's cool down on wingman.

2922
03:06:22,980 --> 03:06:25,880
Yeah, I like used up my wingman cool down, guys.

2923
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:27,620
It's so unfortunate.

2924
03:06:30,220 --> 03:06:32,740
It's so unfortunate, guys.

2925
03:06:35,020 --> 03:06:36,460
Let's see.

2926
03:06:37,480 --> 03:06:38,920
Oh, this way.

2927
03:06:39,320 --> 03:06:39,880
Wee!

2928
03:06:41,320 --> 03:06:42,280
Back.

2929
03:06:45,020 --> 03:06:45,520
Yay!

2930
03:06:46,980 --> 03:06:48,220
This game is so easy.

2931
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:49,900
Do I need a crafter bat?

2932
03:06:49,940 --> 03:06:50,880
No, I have six bats.

2933
03:06:51,100 --> 03:06:51,400
We're five.

2934
03:06:51,900 --> 03:06:53,160
I need 2x, though.

2935
03:06:54,580 --> 03:06:56,340
I need a 2x for this.

2936
03:06:57,880 --> 03:06:58,380
Or...

2937
03:06:58,380 --> 03:07:01,540
I like flatline and 2x because I feel like it's just better.

2938
03:07:03,480 --> 03:07:05,320
Just a better scope.

2939
03:07:07,660 --> 03:07:07,860
Oh.

2940
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:08,760
Where are they?

2941
03:07:09,120 --> 03:07:10,240
They're right here?

2942
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:11,980
Oh my god!

2943
03:07:12,140 --> 03:07:13,080
They're just chilling.

2944
03:07:14,060 --> 03:07:24,740
Oh, it's two guys but it's two guys whoa i'm so fast it's
literally two instead of one guy we get two guys

2945
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:44,980
no shield is gonna protect you all right this is it oh they
saw us too they'll do and they know they know it's a 3v2 now

2946
03:07:44,980 --> 03:07:48,810
they're fucking Oh, is he looking at me?

2947
03:07:52,940 --> 03:07:54,100
Wait, does this guy have a 2x?

2948
03:07:54,260 --> 03:07:54,480
No.

2949
03:07:56,620 --> 03:07:57,540
No 2x.

2950
03:07:59,540 --> 03:08:00,170
Wait, I hear him.

2951
03:08:04,840 --> 03:08:05,640
You're over there.

2952
03:08:13,190 --> 03:08:13,930
Oh, shit!

2953
03:08:14,670 --> 03:08:15,370
Oh, my god.

2954
03:08:15,590 --> 03:08:16,610
Oh, fuck, okay.

2955
03:08:16,890 --> 03:08:17,150
Okay.

2956
03:08:18,110 --> 03:08:19,330
Don't look at me!

2957
03:08:21,430 --> 03:08:22,910
It's okay, we did it.

2958
03:08:23,250 --> 03:08:24,510
Oh, my god, that was scary.

2959
03:08:25,030 --> 03:08:26,190
There's no way he dies.

2960
03:08:26,210 --> 03:08:26,590
right?

2961
03:08:27,830 --> 03:08:29,890
Oh my god, they looked at me.

2962
03:08:30,190 --> 03:08:30,610
Yay!

2963
03:08:32,670 --> 03:08:34,330
We did it!

2964
03:08:34,530 --> 03:08:34,950
Yeah!

2965
03:08:37,630 --> 03:08:38,830
So easy.

2966
03:08:39,830 --> 03:08:41,950
The donking distractions.

2967
03:08:42,350 --> 03:08:43,470
They looked at me.

2968
03:08:43,470 --> 03:08:44,230
I was so scared.

2969
03:08:49,090 --> 03:08:51,550
No, Doric, it stopped me.

2970
03:08:52,490 --> 03:08:55,610
They thought I would take, oh my god, none of us broke 1k.

2971
03:08:56,210 --> 03:08:57,490
That is so sad.

2972
03:08:59,330 --> 03:09:00,770
None of us.

2973
03:09:00,770 --> 03:09:02,090
We have like a bread player.

2974
03:09:02,530 --> 03:09:04,210
None of us broke one game.

2975
03:09:10,960 --> 03:09:13,700
I like how I could have used the door.

2976
03:09:14,220 --> 03:09:14,840
But I didn't.

2977
03:09:15,020 --> 03:09:16,100
I was just like.

2978
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:19,360
They'll never expect it.

2979
03:09:20,240 --> 03:09:22,000
They never expected guys.

2980
03:09:23,140 --> 03:09:24,740
They are all looking at the door.

2981
03:09:24,880 --> 03:09:26,400
Thinking I'd pop up.

2982
03:09:27,020 --> 03:09:28,840
But I wasn't using that door.

2983
03:09:32,020 --> 03:09:41,540
all right we'll do one uh we'll do uh we'll do one more solo
and then we'll call it here because we have another stream

2984
03:09:41,540 --> 03:09:49,200
in an hour another hour and 20 minutes all right here we go
Here we go.

2985
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:55,640
Alright, solo mode.

2986
03:09:55,800 --> 03:09:56,980
We're all dreams die.

2987
03:09:57,480 --> 03:09:59,100
Yeah, doors are for port-y.

2988
03:10:03,520 --> 03:10:05,100
I bought the DLC.

2989
03:10:05,580 --> 03:10:07,120
I don't need to use doors anymore.

2990
03:10:11,300 --> 03:10:12,480
Alright, here we go.

2991
03:10:13,400 --> 03:10:14,040
Last game.

2992
03:10:14,900 --> 03:10:15,440
Last game.

2993
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:16,940
This might be a really fast game.

2994
03:10:17,800 --> 03:10:20,600
Honestly, this could be a very fast game.

2995
03:10:23,080 --> 03:10:24,920
Nobody to fight for Altair.

2996
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:29,060
Alright, here we go.

2997
03:10:32,100 --> 03:10:33,320
Alright, this is it.

2998
03:10:38,720 --> 03:10:39,080
Yeah!

2999
03:10:40,300 --> 03:10:41,420
What's it mean?

3000
03:10:41,940 --> 03:10:44,640
Loba's cheeks, 69.420.

3001
03:10:45,460 --> 03:10:46,180
That seems right.

3002
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:48,540
That seems right.

3003
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:52,300
Alright, we go to our favorite place.

3004
03:10:53,440 --> 03:11:10,140
where's the sniper perch if I'm going to snipe I might as
well go here it's sniping time alright this is my only safe

3005
03:11:10,140 --> 03:11:19,900
place this place made me live the longest so like I feel the
safest honestly this is like the only place that I feel safe

3006
03:11:19,900 --> 03:11:21,060
at the moment

3007
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:39,800
enemies nearby not anymore we don't think anyone lands here
that's good thank god thank fucking god for now this place

3008
03:11:39,800 --> 03:11:48,300

the only area that i lived the longest so i literally you

3009
03:11:48,300 --> 03:11:49,720
don't trust anywhere else

3010
03:11:53,640 --> 03:11:56,100
You need an actual sniper, though.

3011
03:11:57,120 --> 03:12:00,760
Like, I found, like, a repeater with the PK.

3012
03:12:02,940 --> 03:12:03,960
There's nobody here.

3013
03:12:04,240 --> 03:12:04,780
Thank God.

3014
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:06,760
Oh.

3015
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:08,060
Oh.

3016
03:12:10,180 --> 03:12:11,540
Either works, you know.

3017
03:12:12,720 --> 03:12:15,060
Okay, where the fuck are the snipers?

3018
03:12:16,540 --> 03:12:20,160
How am I supposed to snipe if I don't have the one thing I
need?

3019
03:12:22,160 --> 03:12:22,720
Okay.

3020
03:12:22,740 --> 03:12:23,620
Are you serious?

3021
03:12:26,840 --> 03:12:28,380
Where the fuck are the snipers?

3022
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:32,280
Wait, you hear that?

3023
03:12:34,560 --> 03:12:35,820
Wait, wait a minute.

3024
03:12:36,980 --> 03:12:38,140
I didn't loot that.

3025
03:12:39,340 --> 03:12:40,520
I didn't loot that.

3026
03:12:42,380 --> 03:12:44,620
Wait a minute, what are you doing here?

3027
03:12:45,860 --> 03:12:46,580
What are you doing?

3028
03:12:46,600 --> 03:12:47,580
This is my strat!

3029
03:12:48,740 --> 03:12:49,840
What are you doing here?

3030
03:12:52,740 --> 03:12:54,120
This is my strat!

3031
03:12:56,560 --> 03:12:57,100
Oh no.

3032
03:13:12,180 --> 03:13:13,480
That's fucking right, bitch.

3033
03:13:18,210 --> 03:13:20,370
Yeah, you think that's gonna stop me?

3034
03:13:22,870 --> 03:13:23,370
Oh.

3035
03:13:25,450 --> 03:13:27,610
Oh, guys, I broke-

3036
03:13:33,970 --> 03:13:36,390
Guys, it might have stopped me.

3037
03:13:38,730 --> 03:13:40,990
Oh my gosh!

3038
03:13:41,530 --> 03:13:42,970
He's shooting my feet!

3039
03:13:43,290 --> 03:13:45,230
He's shooting my feet!

3040
03:13:45,910 --> 03:13:47,030
AHHHHH!

3041
03:13:49,770 --> 03:13:50,890
AHHHHH!

3042
03:13:51,210 --> 03:13:52,330
AHHHHH!

3043
03:13:52,330 --> 03:13:52,890
AHHHHH!

3044
03:13:55,650 --> 03:13:56,770
AHHHHH!

3045
03:13:57,050 --> 03:13:58,170
AHHHHH!

3046
03:13:58,170 --> 03:13:59,650
Oh my god!

3047
03:14:00,030 --> 03:14:01,910
Wait, what the fuck?

3048
03:14:04,150 --> 03:14:05,870
Oh no way!

3049
03:14:06,690 --> 03:14:08,650
No fucking way!

3050
03:14:09,590 --> 03:14:12,050
That's a It's actually not fair.

3051
03:14:13,440 --> 03:14:14,020
My god.

3052
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:17,200
I would have fought that with you.

3053
03:14:17,460 --> 03:14:19,580
Bro, this game fucking...

3054
03:14:21,540 --> 03:14:24,120
There's no fucking way.

3055
03:14:24,940 --> 03:14:27,340
That's actually bullshit.

3056
03:14:28,660 --> 03:14:29,020
Bro!

3057
03:14:30,140 --> 03:14:31,120
Bro!

3058
03:14:31,780 --> 03:14:32,920
Bro, stop!

3059
03:14:33,700 --> 03:14:35,960
I went through so much, bro.

3060
03:14:37,280 --> 03:14:38,840
Not fair.

3061
03:14:44,770 --> 03:14:47,190
That's not fair!

3062
03:14:47,790 --> 03:14:50,230
I went through so much, man!

3063
03:14:50,810 --> 03:14:53,130
I didn't...

3064
03:14:53,130 --> 03:14:54,490
Putting a pound!

3065
03:14:55,210 --> 03:14:58,690
I can't believe it actually stopped me!

3066
03:14:59,450 --> 03:15:01,410
What is this?

3067
03:15:02,410 --> 03:15:04,970
Bro, it actually stopped me!

3068
03:15:05,990 --> 03:15:06,350
Wait, what?

3069
03:15:06,370 --> 03:15:06,970
Oh, it's here.

3070
03:15:09,670 --> 03:15:12,210
Yeah, you thought Tap Street's gonna fucking save you?

3071
03:15:15,710 --> 03:15:16,310
Okay.

3072
03:15:17,430 --> 03:15:18,170
Might need arms.

3073
03:15:18,490 --> 03:15:19,970
Might need shoes, though.

3074
03:15:23,070 --> 03:15:24,250
Oh, that's smart.

3075
03:15:26,430 --> 03:15:26,910
