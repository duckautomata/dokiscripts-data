00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,530
What do I do with this?

177
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,250
Oh!

178
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,650
Can I make it bigger?

179
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,910
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

180
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,190
That freaking...

181
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,620
Yo, I'm gonna speed...

182
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,040
Yo, oh my god, this speedruns this game.

183
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,040
Oh, I'm dead.

184
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,040
Crunchy, thank you so much for getting this up.

185
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,420
Yeah, I think I'm dead.

186
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,280
Then guys, Adrian, thank you for the fall.

187
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,900
How did I break the game?

188
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,670
I don't, what?

189
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,770
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

190
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,770
Maybe I can make a speed run.

191
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,110
Speed run strat.

192
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:34,350
All right.

193
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,570
All right, wait, wait, wait.

194
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,710
Let me see if I can do it.

195
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,190
Let me see.

196
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:37,870
Let me see if I can.

197
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,110
Yeah, see.

198
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,650
I don't break it anymore.

199
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:42,750
Look.

200
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:43,610
It's okay.

201
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,070
Oh my god, that's a big ass cheese.

202
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,630
That's a big ass cheese.

203
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,300
During eyelids, you will lose the ability to awaken suddenly
due to realizing that this is a dream.

204
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,220
Breaking cheese keeps you...

205
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,060
I have already informed you that this is a dream.

206
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,800
You did not wake up.

207
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,080
Please complete the remaining orientation activities.

208
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,480
It won't let me break it.

209
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,240
It won't let me break the game anymore.

210
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

211
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,300

Rotate time.

00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,200
Oh, am I rotate?

Rotate.

Alright.

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,000

Priority tetrahedron a variable degree of force can and will

235
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,260
Okay, fuck it.

236
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,180
I can't be fucking bothered

237
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,340
Unless...

238
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,440
What can I do here?

239
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,710
Oh, I thought I could break this.

240
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,490
Oh shit!

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Okay, no, that was a word.

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,760
Drink a soda.

243
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,760
How did I drink a soda?

244
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh shit!

245
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,500
Oh,

246
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,270
can we go bigger?

247
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,950
Can we go bigger?

248
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,770
Oh, bigger.

249
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,650
Bigger.

250
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,870
How big can this soda get?

251
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,390
Did that do anything?

252
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,230
Oh, shit.

253
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,750
How big can you get soda?

254
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,910
Oh, my God.

255
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,270
This is a big ass soda.

256
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,610
I wonder what do I do with you.

257
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,230
What do I do with you?

258
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,330
I don't know what to do with this.

259
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,250
Okay.

260
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,480
Okay, I see.

261
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,140
Okay.

262
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,440
So now, instead of some diabetes, we're in extreme thirst.

263
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,660
Oh, what the f- Oh shit.

264
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,120
Okay, how do I get through here?

265
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,260
Oh.

266
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,640
Oh, I need tiny soda.

267
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,940
Wait, unless...

268
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,680
That actually worked.

269
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,550
Bring my soda with me.

270
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,650
Tiny plaque.

271
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,350
Oh.

272
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,530
My soda.

273
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,530
Oh, that's stupid.

274
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,290
I can't bring soda.

275
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,370
Is this a horror game?

276
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,770
What the fuck?

277
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,120
Let me make it small again.

278
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,820
Oh, wait.

279
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,920
I have Arizona.

280
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,280
Okay, I'm making this small.

281
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,300
Okay, wait.

282
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,280
As soon you will see.

283
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,340
Please don't tell me this is the horror game.

284
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,980
I was not.

285
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,260
I'm not prepared for that.

286
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,080
Maybe?

287
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,600
Maybe.

288
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,300
Oh.

289
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,720
Oh, you're so tiny now.

290
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
Can I crouch?

291
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,160
Oh, no.

292
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:47,420

I'm I'm putting it all up Okay, is there another hole here?

294
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,200
Okay, not here.

295
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,080
Maybe.

296
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,750
Okay, maybe.

297
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,670
Okay, maybe.

298
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:21,930
Oh.

299
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,510
Wait, wait, let me put the button earlier.

300
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,990
Dude, I'm just like, honestly, I'm just brute forcing it.

301
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,450
I'm brute forcing everything until it works.

302
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,850
This game is like Layers of Fear.

303
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,150
I want you to accept that I play it and I check it out in
episode 3 of Nightmares for a week.

304
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,150
All environments perceived during eyelids should reflect a
typical mental state.

305
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:52,050
If you believe your mental state was compromised by
Somnaskult, please provide a comprehensive rational

306
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,430
explanation in your post-procedural survey.

307
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,250
It's precisely a size relative to the object.

308
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,810
It's put a gift card.

309
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,790
You're using words I don't.

310
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,310
You're using too many, too many big words for me right now.

311
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,430
How do I get this in here?

312
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,210
Dude, I'm an artist, too.

313
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,450
And I don't know shit about perspective.

314
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,290
What the fuck?

315
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,850
Let me in.

316
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,550
Let me in.

317
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,450
Let me in.

318
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,780
Where this is open?

319
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
Where this...

320
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,700
What?

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,600
Hello?

322
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,920
What?

323
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:36,820
Hello?

324
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,010
Oh my god, dude, my god.

325
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,370
Please, please, come over.

326
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,550
I'm so fucking confused.

327
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,010
Please, give me the block.

328
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:11,930
Hey, rocket.

329
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,250
Okay, maybe if I bring it here.

330
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,630
Okay, no.

331
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,670
Okay, wait, unless, wait.

332
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,970
Oh, oh.

333
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,810
Wait!

334
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:29,630
Okay.

335
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:30,770
Alright.

336
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:31,870
Ugh.

337
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,510
God, I'm so fucking sorry.

338
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,490
This is the only game we back see.

339
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,410
I was reading chat.

340
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,310
I just didn't understand what the fuck you're talking about.

341
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,470
I just- I didn't know- I was like over the- over you stupid.

342
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,390
There's a window.

343
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,070
How am I gonna put it over?

344
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,550
There's a fucking window.

345
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,730
I was thinking, damn, my chat's so fucking stupid.

346
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,050
Can't believe they don't know that there's a window here.

347
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,170
Objects can't go through windows.

348
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,030
Guy.

349
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,730
Oh my gosh, I think I'm lost now.

350
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:18,870
Where am I?

351
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,510
Wait, what is there?

352
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,010
Wait.

353
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,070
Oh, wait a minute.

354
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,690
Wait a minute.

355
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,110
Oh wait, I'm back here.

356
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,910
I'm so close to murder right now.

357
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,850
It hurts.

358

What are you guys talking about?

359
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,250
Am I stuck?

360
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:38,710

361
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,230

I don't know how I got here.

366
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,050

367
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,900

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,080
Oh!

372
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,260
How big can I make this?

373
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,980
Do you think I can break the game again?

374
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,720
Okay, I need to get it so it's on both sides.

375
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,620

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,440
No matter how stupid we are.

381

I am so fucking tired.

392
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,680
I don't know what's going on.

393
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,820

Cheese.

403
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,920
Wait, where the fuck did cheese come from?

404
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,040
Where did you come from?

405
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,520
So you're in joylessly while putting together a moniker by
Anchor of Crimpa.

406
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,540

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,500
You're angry.

408
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,620
What the fuck do you mean?

409
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,420
Okay.

Oh!

411
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,600

412
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,900
Oh.

413
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,080

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,830
Oh.

423
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Why do you laugh so much though?

424
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,500
What do you mean?

425
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,060
But why would I need to rotate it?

426
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,390
Like...

427
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,740

Okay, I mean, that works.

435
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Okay.

436
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,320
Just get angry and it'll work, I guess.

437
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,100
Brewports once again.

438
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,960
I don't know what I did.

439
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,120
I just, it's okay.

440
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,680
I never, I don't know what I'm doing.

441
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,960
If you don't know, just be angry, I guess.

442
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,420
No, where the fuck do I go?

443
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,540
She just makes it bigger.

444
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,920
She just makes...

445
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,360

447
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,910
Just one more...

448
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,850
Does something happen?

449
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:23,490
Exactly.

450
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,490
I don't need to figure out shit out.

451
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,110
I don't need to use my brain.

452
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,330
All I have to do is just...

453
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,430
We won!

454
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,170

457
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,390

466
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,830
How long do you think the stream will actually- What do you
mean?

467
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,150
It's a 10-minute stream.

468
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,990
This game is two hours long, so it's practically 10 minutes.

469
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:09,750
Oh, no.

470
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:10,890

Oh.

985
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:35,350
Please note that a reluctance to volunteer for the risks
associated with explosive mental overload implies a

986
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:41,510
misunderstanding of all other solutions, all of which are
far more traumatic and Likelier to result in catastrophe.

987
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,990
I am not capable of suboptimal suggestions.

988
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,790

1229
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:41,920
Where are you?

1230
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,800
There's no place to bring...

1231
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:47,700
There's no place to bring a baby door.

1232
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:48,820
There's...

1233
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:49,540
What is that?

1234
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:53,800
Okay.

1235
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:57,840
If I keep clicking on everything, something will let me pick
it up.

1236
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,660
It'll let me pick it up.

1237
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,720
If I just keep clicking...

1238
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:03,600
Oh.

1239
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:04,000
Oops.

1240
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,700
Oh, no, I made it small again.

1241
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:08,680
Okay.

1242
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:11,980
There we go.

1243
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,200
Okay, I made it small again.

1244
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,380
Wait, I keep making it small.

1245
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,960
Okay, there we go.

1246
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,120
Okay, I made it small again.

1247
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,800
There we go.

1248
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:35,920
There we go.

1249
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,320
Now, I stopped making it small.

1250
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,480
I've stopped making it small.

1251
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:45,560
Okay.

1252
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:47,220
Alright.

1253
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:51,380
If I keep clicking, it will let me pick it up.

1254
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,600
Okay, maybe...

1255
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,280
Maybe that ain't it.

1256
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,040
Maybe that ain't it.

1257
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,980
Maybe if I go here instead.

1258
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,220
No, no.

1259
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,320
Oh, maybe if I'm breaking the game.

1260
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:05,620
Okay.

1261
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:28,200

hey oh nice that unintentional multi-dream layering occurs
in less than one percent of patients this correlates

1284
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:34,740
strongly with the 99 of patients who are able to follow
simple instructions from the standard orientation protocol

1285
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:43,880
you hope the stories reach things that are higher you can
also have them all move all their most used objects on on a

01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:47,080
high shelf oh no what oh where did you go

Gotta go sleep tight.

1307
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:10,620
Sleep tight.

1308
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,320
I'm able to cover my paint.

1309
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,940
All right, fuck it.

1310
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:17,180
Thank you so much for coming to the stream.

01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,100

1314
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,720
I hope you have a good night's rest.

1315
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,760
Oh, it was paint.

1316
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:31,860
It was fucking paint.

1317
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,690
The fucking is a scheme.

1318
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:39,950
The game's fucking with me.

1319
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,810
Cloud insert projections.

1320
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:53,720
I guess it was paint all I guess it was paint all along.

1321
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:55,860
I can see Stupid.

1322
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,100
I can't believe you guys were so scared of paint.

1323
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:04,580
Damn, I can't believe y'all were so scared of paint, chat.

1324
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:06,020
Wow.

1325
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,420
You will be quizzed, take notes.

1326
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,120
Oh, that's a lot of alarms.

1327
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,800
That's a lot of alarms.

1328
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,120
Okay, I need to shut all these alarms down.

1329
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,820
And we can smell them if it's different.

1330
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,720
Wait, the door's scared.

1331
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:30,880
What do you mean?

1332
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:32,400
Wait, what?

1333
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

1334
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,640
I don't know any of what you're talking about, chat.

1335
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,240
Don't fucking...

1336
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,520
Don't lie in my stream, guys.

1337
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:42,660
Hey, Fez.

1338
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:44,620
Soda.

1339
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:46,060
Oh.

1340
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,260
Okay.

1341
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,480
Oh, baby door!

1342
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:51,500
Wait, let me make it a baby door.

1343
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,140
Boop, boop.

1344
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:53,920
Baby door.

1345
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,180
You guys hear me?

1346
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,320
How will I record?

1347
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,520
I guess she's still a boomer.

1348
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:03,460
Wait, how does that make me a boomer?

1349
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:03,820
What?

1350
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:06,860
How does that even make me a boomer?

1351
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:14,250
Maybe door returns.

1352
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:23,410
Oh.

1353
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:26,190
I'm having a good time.

1354
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,280
I keep making doors.

1355
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:32,740
Oh my god.

1356
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,680
How many doors can I make?

1357
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,040
Before I break the game.

1358
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,840
I'm having a good time.

1359
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,100
I don't know about you guys.

1360
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:46,600
I'm having a good time.

1361
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,420
Look at this pile of doors.

1362
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,020
Holy shit.

1363
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:59,040
What are you doing?

1364
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:02,180
I actually...

1365
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:02,660
Damn.

1366
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:04,580
Wow.

1367
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:05,480
Those are all...

1368
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,420
This is the most doors I can make, apparently.

1369
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,760
Even the game told me to fuck off.

1370
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,360
The game told me to fuck off.

1371
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:26,830
Dude, I can't believe the game told me that, that, dude,
that, you had to know.

1372
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,470
A Minecraft flashback.

1373
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:35,930
Is this a puzzle game?

1374
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:37,210
Yeah, it is.

1375
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:37,690
It is.

1376
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:39,190
It is a puzzle game.

1377
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:41,530
It's like an optical illusion.

1378
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:42,030
Attention.

1379
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:46,410
Dr. Pierce requires you to note the following risks of dream
over exposure.

1380
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:55,590
memory loss both quantitative and qualitative hallucinations
of dreaded or annoying objects unrealistic beliefs about the

1381
01:35:55,590 --> 01:36:11,090
lengths of hallways oh i don't like this please which have

1383
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:26,590
My brother lives me out.

1384
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:27,950
Oh, no, that's really bad.

1385
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:31,050
You gotta get yourself tested or quarantine yourself.

1386
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:32,470
Okay, maybe.

1387
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:36,370
I just need to keep making...

1388
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:43,490
That's the last thing I see after watching the horror movie
Oculus.

1389
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:44,890
What was Oculus?

1390
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:46,150
What was it about?

1391
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:47,530
Oh, please.

1392
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:49,490
Please, my pile of clocks!

1393
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,530
Please pile of clocks!

1394
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:57,910
My pile of clocks!

1395
01:36:58,490 --> 01:36:58,810
Please!

1396
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:01,170
I think I made too many!

1397
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,720
Okay, I think I made too many clocks.

1398
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,840
Okay, if I keep...

1399
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:12,680
Okay, here we go.

1400
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:13,940
Here we go.

1401
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:14,440
Look at that.

1402
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,860
My pile of clocks worked.

1403
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,160
I didn't need to make a big clock.

1404
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,480
I'll just make many clocks.

1405
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:38,410
apple right click to return i don't think i should be right
clicking apple it

Okay.

1423
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,180
Did I fuck up?

01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:52,500
Oh, I think I fuck.

1425
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,480

1431
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:09,240
Don't worry.

1432
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,060

01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:12,760
Oh, that's a big apple.

1434
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,100

What the fuck?

1439
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:28,230
I'm accidentally breaking.

1440
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:33,110
Hey, I told you, if I made enough apples, they would break
the game.

1441
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:38,550
I think I actually accidentally broke the puzzle.

1442
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:40,770
I made too many apples.

1443
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:45,990
I can't even tell what's potential came to sight.

1444
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:49,220
Everyone still keep breaking things now.

1445
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:55,770

I can't believe I actually like, I actually like broke.

1450
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:13,070
I feel like I'm watching Art in Motion.

1451
01:40:14,810 --> 01:40:16,030
What do I do with all these apples?

1452
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:18,050
Oh.

1453
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:27,340

Thank you so much.

1463
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:43,420
Look at all these apples I can make.

1464
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:48,410
Oh, my God.

1465
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:51,310
Look at the thing at the apple.

1466
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:02,980
Why is there first secret as many apples?

1467
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:03,880
No,

1468
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:13,940
I almost got pushed off by the apples.

1469
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:27,730
Oh, did I get it here?

1470
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:29,050
How did I get here?

1471
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:35,970
Oh, my god, you're stopping world hunger.

1472
01:41:37,090 --> 01:41:38,450
Oh, I get it.

1473
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:39,330
I get it.

1474
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:40,270
I got it.

1475
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:41,870
Keep making apples, right?

1476
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:45,350
Wait, that apple just disappeared.

1477
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:54,620
Yellow?

1478
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:57,500
Why do I have orange?

1479
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,680
You're just now?

1480
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:01,760
Is the cave in suffering?

1481
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:02,860
I don't know.

1482
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,180
What do you want me to do?

1483
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,720
I'm just making apples.

1484
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:15,380
Okay.

1485
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,820
If I keep making apples, it'll work.

1486
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:19,020
Right?

1487
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,640
All I have to do is keep...

1488
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:24,660
Yo!

1489
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:25,820
Wait.

1490
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,140
Why are the apples changing colors?

1491
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:41,480
Why do you mean just go upstairs?

1492
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,560
Neon apples for the wind.

1493
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,240
What do you want me to do?

1494
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:52,620
What do you want me to do?

1495
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,780
I can't even go through this door!

1496
01:42:55,780 --> 01:43:05,760
I gotta keep making apples Don't come to me Look at all

1497
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:12,420

look at oh my god, dude.

1498
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,120
What the fuck?

1499
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:19,160
It's like slamming into It's like slamming into the wall
now.

1500
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:39,540
All right.

1501
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,600
I'll figure this out.

1502
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:41,920
I'll figure this out.

1503
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:45,880
I just need this apple to come closer.

1504
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:47,280
All right, apple.

1505
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:48,860
It's okay.

1506
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,660
Just keep going.

1507
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,920
Just keep going, apple.

1508
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:54,620
Oh, I can't.

1509
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,040
Oh, I maxed out.

1510
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,480
I made too many apples.

1511
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:03,780
I actually made too many apples that I can't make anymore.

1512
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,220
How is that possible?

1513
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:10,220
I actually made too many.

1514
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:14,880
What are you saying?

1515
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:16,920
What do you want me to do with this?

1516
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,140
Maybe I can just beg you for mercy.

1517
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,080
Yo, I can't make this.

1518
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:33,770

Oh, no, these guys stop, too.

1525
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,520
Maybe I made too many apples.

1526
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:26,880
Wait, wait, wait.

1527
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,480
If I do this, maybe one of the apples can...

1528
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,000
Maybe if I jump.

1529
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,560
Maybe if I jump in.

1530
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:35,840
Oh, no, that's not it.

1531
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:38,900
Maybe if I...

1532
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:39,300
Maybe...

1533
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:40,940
Okay, I'm so freaking curious.

1534
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:48,150
Did I make too many?

1535
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:49,150

1536
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:49,250
Okay.

1537
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:51,770

01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:16,030
Yo, I know what to do.

The key was to make more apples.

1557
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,520

01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:39,060
Oh, babies.

1586
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:40,840
Yes, baby.

1587
01:48:45,410 --> 01:48:47,110
Look at my tiny apples.

1588
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:49,410
I don't think this is it.

1589
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:54,150
I don't think these baby apples are it, guys.

1590
01:48:55,410 --> 01:49:10,710
spawned they're so tiny they're so tiny that they need spawn
I don't think that was it guys I what if you will make it

1591
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:13,510
one of my children will make it through

1592
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:26,260
okay maybe one of you will make it through I believe in you
children you That genuinely gets me every time.

1593
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:30,800
You'll make it, I swear.

1594
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,660
I just gotta keep making more apples.

1595
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:37,060
One of my children will make it through.

1596
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,580
I believe in you.

1597
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:43,020
I believe in you.

1598
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:47,080
Yo, this is actual insanity right here.

1599
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:50,600
You guys saw the fucking jumping into the pit was insanity.

1600
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:53,840
I'm out here making heaven fucking...

1601
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:56,260
making apples for 20 minutes.

1602
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:03,780
Okay.

1603
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1604
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:06,620
Look at here.

1605
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:08,500
My children make it a few.

1606
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:14,690
I don't.

1607
01:50:14,990 --> 01:50:16,350
God, children, please.

1608
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:18,690
I think I broke it again.

1609
01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:20,930
I can't make any more apples again.

1610
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:23,450
Oh my God, please.

1611
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:25,810
How many more apples do I make?

1612
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:30,270
If one children doesn't make it, you make a thousand.

1613
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:34,070
I mean, that's what they did in the plague.

1614
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:39,010
They kept making children because they kept dying from the
plague.

1615
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:40,550
That's what I learned.

1616
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:42,910
Okay, I think I need a restart.

1617
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:44,510
I figured out why.

1618
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:46,490
I figured out why.

1619
01:50:46,690 --> 01:50:48,690
How to dispose all the apples.

1620
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:50,150
And it's right click.

1621
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:52,870
Alright, here we go again.

1622
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:57,470
How do I make a big apple?

1623
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:01,550
I figured it out.

1624
01:51:01,710 --> 01:51:04,170
I was like, Alright, biggie boy.

1625
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:06,030
One of you will make it again.

1626
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:09,090
How do I make it?

1627
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:11,090
How do I make you big, mister?

1628
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:16,830
Oh, come on, man.

1629
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:18,730
Come on, man.

1630
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:21,690
One of you will make it.

1631
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:23,670
One of my children will make it.

1632
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:27,630
Shit, here we go again.

1633
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:31,890
Keep spamming apples!

1634
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:36,490
Doesn't get bigger to more distance, does it?

1635
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,830
I don't think it's making it smaller.

1636
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:40,610
No, it goes smaller.

1637
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:42,770
Wait, this apple.

1638
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:43,730
Wait, this apple.

1639
01:51:43,970 --> 01:51:44,850
This is the apple.

1640
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:46,590
This is the apple that's gonna live!

1641
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,990
Apple!

1642
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:51,910
Yeah, let's just hold- Apple, you're gonna live.

1643
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:53,370
You're gonna live!

1644
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:55,130
You're gonna live, apple!

1645
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:57,010
You're gonna make it!

1646
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:59,250
You're gonna- One of you will make it!

1647
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:00,950
What of you?

1648
01:52:01,230 --> 01:52:02,210
Yo, this is so hard.

1649
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:03,770
This is so hard.

1650
01:52:07,530 --> 01:52:11,970
What of them, yeah, we'll make, one of them will make it
eventually.

1651
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:14,070
I believe in all my apple children.

1652
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:18,170
Let's stop after watching this.

1653
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:24,350
Oh my gosh, how many apples can I make?

1654
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:25,790
Okay.

1655
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:29,750
Oh, maybe I'll make it behind.

1656
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:31,190
Oh, I got it, I got it.

1657
01:52:31,290 --> 01:52:32,870
We'll just, I got it.

1658
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:34,530
I got it.

1659
01:52:35,110 --> 01:52:35,630
Oh!

1660
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:37,950
Oh no, I'm a baby!

1661
01:52:38,490 --> 01:52:40,010
No, no, no, no, no!

1662
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:42,130
You were the chosen one!

1663
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:45,050
You were the chosen one!

1664
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,680
What happens to your brain cells?

1665
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:53,540
Are you watching?

1666
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:55,260
Are you watching?

1667
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:00,180
You're supposed to clean the bed.

1668
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,180
Not join the...

1669
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,240
I'm so sad that was our closest one.

1670
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:07,020
That was our closest one.

1671
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:07,880
Closest one.

1672
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:12,960
That apple was our closest one.

1673
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:15,760
Oh, oh my God, I have flinged over.

1674
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:18,440
Okay.

1675
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,920
Okay, maybe if I...

1676
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:21,300
Maybe...

1677
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:21,480
No!

1678
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:21,960
No!

1679
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:28,040
I spent so many times...

1680
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:31,780
You're just not advising the apples after watching the
stream.

1681
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,560
I think it's time to reset again, guys.

1682
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:35,740
I think maybe.

1683
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:37,020
Okay, maybe.

1684
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:39,940
Maybe, oh, maybe if I do this.

1685
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:50,240
Apples, come on here!

1686
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:51,600
Yeah!

1687
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,100
Come on!

1688
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,080
One of you won't make it!

1689
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:04,010
You can't all fucking fly into the pit!

1690
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:10,090
Physics will fucking stop you one day!

1691
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:15,430
I'll just need physics to stop working and then we'll be
flying, chat.

1692
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:17,990
As long as...

1693
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:21,630
I need the physics engines to stop working and we'll be...
we'll win.

1694
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:26,090
This is a nice backseat.

1695
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:30,070
Wait, okay, okay, alright, alright.

1696
01:54:30,090 --> 01:54:31,970
Alright, I'm restarting, okay, okay.

1697
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:34,770
What do you mean?

1698
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:35,490
Oh!

1699
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:37,610
I'm so fucking smart!

1700
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:39,590
Alright, alright, get in here!

1701
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:40,650
Get in here!

1702
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:42,530
Get- Oh, baby apples.

1703
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:43,570
Get in here.

1704
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:44,430
Get in here!

1705
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:45,530
Oh, I fucked up.

1706
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:59,810
Okay, one of you will make it one of my children will make
it I don't think they're making it guys Yo, my children, I

1707
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:06,930
don't think they made it guys Wait, okay, yo, yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo, come over here.

1708
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:13,590
Come over here One of you guys will become wait, will this
work?

1709
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:16,110
Oh my god, you guys are work.

1710
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:19,950
Will you tiny apples?

1711
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:35,720
The tiny apples work.

1712
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,600
Oh, I did too.

1713
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:47,180
Oh, my God.

1714
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:49,110
The tiny apples made it.

1715
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:54,540
It was...

1716
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,160
There you go, tiny apples.

1717
01:55:58,780 --> 01:55:59,500
Warning.

1718
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:03,080
Double Pierce is frantically submitting numerous Oh, my God.

1719
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,220
The tiny apples.

1720
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:08,200
Standard orientation protocol in a desperate attempt to
counsel you.

1721
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:14,520
I have no certainty to correct these errors, but I cannot
compromise the integrity of the standard orientation

1722
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:15,240
protocol.

1723
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:17,600
You will not receive these messages.

1724
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:19,740
They would not make sense regardless.

1725
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:23,200
Oh my god.

1726
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:25,840
Size doesn't matter.

1727
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,080
Oh my god.

1728
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,580
Oh my god, tiny apple.

1729
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,520
Oh, oh my god, tiny apple.

1730
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:44,860
I think I fucked off.

1731
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:52,080
Oh, and we're like, I wait 10 minutes more.

1732
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:55,080
Attention.

1733
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:56,240
Oh, shit.

1734
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:58,540
It continues to input significant errors.

1735
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:00,900
I will interpret his basic ideas.

1736
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:01,660
Hello.

1737
01:57:02,140 --> 01:57:03,680
My introductions are redundant.

1738
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:05,600
Grandpa, I hope...

1739
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,160
Uh...

1740
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:11,400
Grandpa, I hope you have a good apple pie after all the
apples.

1741
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:13,360
After all...

1742
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:15,460
After all the apples.

1743
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:16,600
Hello.

1744
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:18,980

I'm trying to do puzzles, but I take...

1749
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:31,440
That's what's happening.

1750
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:33,580
A tomorrow can bright.

1751
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:50,610
Oh Man I was bored What is now I'm in Apple I'm just trying

What's this What's this Oh, that looks nice.

1754
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:13,130
That looks nice after the tiny apple incident.

1755
01:58:14,810 --> 01:58:15,710
That looks really nice.

1756
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:21,780
Thank you for the laughs.

1757
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:23,800
I watched a butter finger for this.

1758
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:26,200
Thank you, Soul, for the 10 minutes.

1759
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:27,820
Thank you.

1760
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:30,260
I'm going to have nightmares about the apples now.

1761

Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and I'd like to read you
my favorite inspirational quote by me.

1859
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:57,720
The worst thing you can do is focus on negativity.

1860
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:05,500
It won't spare you from the cage of death, the pain of
disease, the cruelty of time, the cold shell of human

1861
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:05,940
nature.

1862
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:06,740
Why are you tiny?

1863
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:09,660
The eventual loss of everything you've ever held dear.

1864
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:10,360
Okay, okay.

1865
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:13,120
Whatever you do, don't focus on that.

1866
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:13,900

We've learned something today.

1976
02:12:58,330 --> 02:13:10,990
We learned that you can actually be apparently there is a
way to be too small in the game there is a way and I found

1977
02:13:10,990 --> 02:13:29,420
that way okay I fucked up again size doesn't matter there's
a thing called being too small apparently isn't that crazy

1978
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:36,420
who would have thought there's a thing called being too
small in the video game Who would have thought, guys?

1979
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:37,960

02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:44,000

1985
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:54,260

Apparently so.

1998
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:55,160
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and I'd like to thank you for
triggering every single one of our 823 emergency protocols.

1999
02:14:56,100 --> 02:15:00,200
This will assist us greatly in improving the system for
future patients.

2000
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:08,880
Anyway, you're now headed in the right direction, and we
should be able to initiate the emergency exit protocol

2001
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:09,420
shortly.

2002
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:14,800

2159
02:25:55,350 --> 02:25:56,270

02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,680
Thank you for completing the Song the Sculpt Standard
Orientation Protocol.

2180
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:26,180
Before we begin the first phase of therapy, I'd like to
briefly describe the finite and fragile nature of the

2181
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:26,660
DreamScape.

2182
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:32,580
Well, you didn't finish explaining the DreamScape.

2183
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:34,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2184
02:27:40,350 --> 02:27:42,530
Yo, I don't know how to...

2185
02:27:42,530 --> 02:27:44,770
I can barely walk properly.

2186
02:27:46,530 --> 02:27:48,570
games, but I alone this.

2187
02:27:49,230 --> 02:27:50,650
It is so fucky.

2188
02:27:51,330 --> 02:27:52,350
How do I get out of here?

2189
02:27:55,050 --> 02:27:55,910
Yeah, this hurts me.

2190
02:27:55,970 --> 02:27:57,690
I dream like that, count on trying to wake up.

2191
02:27:57,890 --> 02:27:58,810
Then I got dragged.

2192
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:02,550
All of a sudden, again, after two more times, I finally woke
up.

2193
02:28:02,850 --> 02:28:03,950
Yeah, this is so fucky.

2194
02:28:04,070 --> 02:28:04,410
This is...

2195
02:28:09,150 --> 02:28:10,250
What do you want me to do?

2196
02:28:11,850 --> 02:28:12,250
Oh.

2197
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:20,090
Okay.

2198
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:20,970
Up.

2199
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:25,720
Hey there, guys.

2200
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,080
Hey, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

2201
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:31,020
How do I...

2202
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:33,240
How do I get out of here?

2203
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:34,040
Stupa!

2204
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:35,900
Thank you so much for the raid!

2205
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:37,640
Thank you!

2206
02:28:37,940 --> 02:28:40,020
I hope you had a good stream, Stupa!

2207
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:41,720
Oh, you were playing Valorant!

2208
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:42,680
Valorant!

2209
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:43,640
How you did what?

2210
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:44,320
I hope you were...

2211
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:45,020
Are you playing raid?

2212
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:46,340
Thank you so much for the raider!

2213
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:47,200
Hi, everyone!

2214
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:48,220
Hi!

2215
02:28:48,480 --> 02:28:50,720
I am very fucking confused, but...

2216
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:51,380
Oh, door!

2217
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:52,160
Baby door!

2218
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:53,580
Baby door!

2219
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:56,720
Okay, but how do I...

2220
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:57,720
Oh my gosh.

2221
02:28:58,400 --> 02:28:58,800
Oh, hey.

2222
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:00,920
Okay.

2223
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:03,120
Baby door saved my life.

2224
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:05,620
Now where do I go?

2225
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:08,200
Oh, no.

2226
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:09,220
We stream froze.

2227
02:29:09,460 --> 02:29:09,900
I refresh.

2228
02:29:10,300 --> 02:29:11,000
Here we go.

2229
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:11,880
Look at that.

2230
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:12,780
I'm so smart.

2231
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:14,300
I had a good one.

2232
02:29:14,300 --> 02:29:15,100
How do you stream at?

2233
02:29:15,140 --> 02:29:15,520
Oh, no.

2234
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:17,920
So I'll be sure to read more.

2235
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:20,520
Yeah, I stream at, like, degenerate times.

2236
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:23,000
Very, very degenerate times, Dupa.

2237
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:24,640
Very degenerate.

2238
02:29:24,820 --> 02:29:25,120
All right.

2239
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:29,180
Of course, nothing is more challenging than the difficulty
of changing perspective.

2240
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:32,400
I tend to stream at, like, after midnight, because that's
when my brain turns on.

2241
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:35,500
And then, but then I only had, like, four hours of sleep.

2242
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:38,660
So I don't know if it's technically on or not.

2243
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:44,180
No spooks here.

2244
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:45,180
Oh, really?

2245
02:29:46,140 --> 02:29:47,620
Oh, really, Cranbow.

2246
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:48,600
Really?

2247
02:29:48,820 --> 02:29:49,960
Thank you for the $5.

2248
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:53,420
I don't know why I don't believe you.

2249
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:54,540
Oh.

2250
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:56,760
Hey, listen!

2251
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:03,160
Oh, hey!

2252
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:04,740
I'm listening!

2253
02:30:06,140 --> 02:30:07,040
How do I do this?

2254
02:30:08,020 --> 02:30:08,520
Bow.

2255
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:10,260
Bow?

2256
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:12,320
Bow?

2257
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:16,360
Where am I?

2258
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:17,480
Stairs.

2259
02:30:22,470 --> 02:30:22,850
Oh!

2260
02:30:25,310 --> 02:30:25,610
Oh!

2261
02:30:26,490 --> 02:30:26,970
Let me!

2262
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,670
Let me!

2263
02:30:27,910 --> 02:30:28,050
Oh!

2264
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:42,360
I don't want to go through!

2265
02:30:49,300 --> 02:30:49,820
Wait,

2266
02:30:56,330 --> 02:30:57,930
what was that sound?

2267
02:30:58,450 --> 02:30:59,970
Wait, wait, what?

2268
02:31:00,330 --> 02:31:00,990
What do you mean?

2269
02:31:03,450 --> 02:31:03,870
No, keep.

2270
02:31:04,150 --> 02:31:04,990
It's not touching things.

2271
02:31:05,070 --> 02:31:06,130
You don't become too small.

2272
02:31:06,270 --> 02:31:07,010
You got stuck on the wall.

2273
02:31:07,150 --> 02:31:08,290
Now you broke the elevator.

2274
02:31:08,650 --> 02:31:09,170
Are you proud?

2275
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:10,490
What do you mean?

2276
02:31:11,170 --> 02:31:11,430
Whoa.

2277
02:31:13,130 --> 02:31:14,190
Does somebody have to...

2278
02:31:14,210 --> 02:31:24,990
Oh hey, I did it Yeah, I did it Whoa, how am I fucking up?

2279
02:31:25,130 --> 02:31:39,830

Oh, what are they gonna do?

2292
02:33:22,130 --> 02:33:28,280
Oh, I went backwards and it worked.

2293
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:30,120
Oh, I guess that was the thing.

2294
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:31,260
Just go backwards.

2295
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:33,360
Wait, is it?

2296
02:33:33,560 --> 02:33:34,360
Wait a minute.

Wait a minute.

2298
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:37,940
Is it actually?

2299
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:39,560
Do I just go backwards?

2300
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:44,740
Wait a minute.

2301
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:45,640
What?

2302
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:47,780
I swear.

2303
02:33:49,540 --> 02:33:50,940
No, okay, it wasn't the backwards.

2304
02:33:51,140 --> 02:33:51,960
It wasn't backwards.

2305
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:59,260
chat it was not backwards i don't know i don't know the
pattern here i don't know the pattern

2306
02:34:02,740 --> 02:34:09,540
okay okay but this is more has been more successful this has
been more successful going backwards has been more

2309
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:30,480
Okay.

2310
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:35,880
Okay.

2311

Alright.

2312
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:40,640
Exit.

2313
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:43,480
Perception is not reality.

2314
02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:45,300
Okay, cool.

2315
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:46,980
Okay, cool.

2316
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:48,000
What the fuck?

2317
02:34:51,210 --> 02:34:51,610
Okay.

2318
02:34:53,130 --> 02:34:53,550
What?

2319
02:34:53,750 --> 02:34:54,490
How am I wrong?

2320
02:34:54,870 --> 02:34:55,830
How am I wrong?

2321
02:34:57,870 --> 02:34:59,430
How am I wrong, all?

2322
02:35:00,430 --> 02:35:00,810
Okay.

2323
02:35:02,130 --> 02:35:02,610
Okay.

2324
02:35:03,130 --> 02:35:03,950
Well, then.

2325
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:09,720
Apparently I've been doing better.

2326
02:35:10,060 --> 02:35:11,500
I've been doing better walking backwards.

2327
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:13,840
I've been doing better walking backwards.

2328
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:20,900
Yo, what the fuck?

2329
02:35:21,100 --> 02:35:23,180
How am I doing backwards better, working backwards?

2330
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:24,360
I don't even know the pattern.

2331
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:27,220
I don't know the pattern of this.

2332
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:32,060
I don't even know the pattern

2333
02:35:45,870 --> 02:35:57,290
I don't know the pattern guys But it went ding ding ding Oh
my god Dude fuck you I got hall 5 I made it to hall number 5

2334
02:35:57,290 --> 02:35:59,150
And I still don't know the pattern

2335
02:36:05,650 --> 02:36:07,650
I made it to hall 5

2336
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:24,460
I will never know how to do this as long as I just don't
apparently I just need to not look at the signs dude oh shit

2337
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:37,000
where do I go now whoa deep oh well okay okay okay this is
actual insanity right here this is this is like we're

2338
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:46,620
getting this is actual insanity right now guys we're
actually going We're actually going crazy.

2339
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:50,520
Oh my god, please.

2340
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:52,040
Okay.

2341
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:54,300
Okay, okay, left.

2342
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:59,060
That has to go totally...

2343
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:02,960
Yo, I'm fucking...

2344
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:04,700
Yo, dude, I hate this.

2345
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:18,590
How am I getting it wrong?

2346
02:37:19,410 --> 02:37:22,030
Okay, y'all, it's just every third time you don't get it,
right?

2347
02:37:22,110 --> 02:37:24,230
On the third time, it'll be the opposite of the...

2348
02:37:24,450 --> 02:37:40,550
others what what okay maybe if I do this and I go boom and
then boom and then okay yeah yeah yeah boom boom all right

2349
02:37:40,550 --> 02:37:48,050
all right all right I got this boom boom all right what how
how

2350
02:37:51,340 --> 02:37:55,880
I I give up I give up

2351
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:01,140
I don't understand the pattern.

2352
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:03,140
What's the pattern?

2353
02:38:05,940 --> 02:38:07,420
What is the pattern?

2354
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:10,780
Why am I wrong now?

2355
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:15,650
Okay.

2356
02:38:16,810 --> 02:38:18,230
How are you wrong?

2357
02:38:19,330 --> 02:38:20,210
Okay, okay.

2358
02:38:22,430 --> 02:38:22,950
All right.

2359
02:38:28,660 --> 02:38:29,100
Okay.

2360
02:38:30,540 --> 02:38:30,980
All right.

2361
02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:43,040
What is, when you get there, you'll need to look at the
exit.

2362
02:38:43,140 --> 02:38:44,700
Look at which way the sign is pointing.

2363
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:49,460
and face the opposite way while walking out the exit.

2364
02:38:49,780 --> 02:38:50,280
What?

2365
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:55,000
Oh, so I do this?

2366
02:38:55,740 --> 02:38:57,100
Is that what you want me to do?

2367
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:01,000
Oh, no, now I'm just...

2368
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,120
Right, right, then left.

2369
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:03,280
Don't look the right, right.

2370
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:04,900
The last time, or...

2371
02:39:04,900 --> 02:39:07,980
Right, right, that, right...

2372
02:39:07,980 --> 02:39:08,920
Oh.

2373
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:11,680
Right, right, left.

2374
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:12,600
Left.

2375
02:39:14,900 --> 02:39:18,440
Oh, you're all confusing me.

2376
02:39:26,290 --> 02:39:27,690
Okay, now which way?

2377
02:39:27,950 --> 02:39:28,890
Which way do I go, chat?

2378
02:39:29,490 --> 02:39:29,990
Which way?

2379
02:39:30,530 --> 02:39:31,450
Alright, lead me.

2380
02:39:31,510 --> 02:39:32,630
Guys, lead me.

2381
02:39:34,770 --> 02:39:35,830
Am I fuck up here?

2382
02:39:36,850 --> 02:39:40,130
Okay, basically look the opposite of the exit sign.

2383
02:39:40,390 --> 02:39:43,310
Okay, and then go the opposite way.

2384
02:39:43,450 --> 02:39:44,750
Alright, I'm doing it.

2385
02:39:45,110 --> 02:39:46,530
Oh, oh, alright.

2386
02:39:46,990 --> 02:39:48,390
And then, opposite.

2387
02:39:49,170 --> 02:39:50,590
Oh, oh, I'm doing it.

2388
02:39:52,030 --> 02:39:59,970
Oh, and then look the opposite and then Oh, we did it!

2389
02:40:00,370 --> 02:40:01,650
Oh, we did it!

2390
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:03,030
Yeah, Baxi Gaming!

2391
02:40:03,570 --> 02:40:06,690
Baxi Gaming has solved the game Baxi Gaming!

2392
02:40:09,250 --> 02:40:11,790
Baxi Gaming has won yet again.

2393
02:40:12,550 --> 02:40:13,250
Oh my god.

2394
02:40:15,230 --> 02:40:15,610
Who?

2395
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:19,250
Yeah, I don't know why backwards work.

2396
02:40:19,790 --> 02:40:20,590
Apparently walking backwards.

2397
02:40:20,610 --> 02:40:24,010
was way, way helpful for some fucking reason.

2398
02:40:25,510 --> 02:40:30,270
For some reason, walking backwards made me more progress.

2399
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:38,140
Oh my god.

2400
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:41,800
Apparently, I broke the game yet again by walking backwards,
apparently.

2401
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:47,000
Oh shit, wait, what the fuck?

2402
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:51,280
Wait, did I fuck up?

2403
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:52,460
Wait a minute.

2404
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:54,180
Wait a minute.

2405
02:40:56,380 --> 02:40:58,960
It was half, so you have to make the wrong path.

2406
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,500
The first turn you look at is the dead end.

2407
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:01,880
You see it?

2408
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:02,960
Look at the black end.

2409
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:04,920
What the fuck did I do?

2410
02:41:09,850 --> 02:41:10,290
Beatman.

2411
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:14,120
Oh, oh, guys.

2412
02:41:14,740 --> 02:41:17,100
I'm not sure how to break the video game.

2413
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:21,880
You must understand that it is possible to completely
exhaust your supply of dreams.

2414
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:28,900
Thereby, entering a state in which you will not be able to
wake up, even with the help of triggering mechanisms.

2415
02:41:29,420 --> 02:41:55,320
oh yo hey where am I all right whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I
don't like it oh I don't whoa whoa where's the light where

2416
02:41:55,320 --> 02:42:00,500
are my you

2417
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:14,400
going crazy now I don't know what I'm doing.

2418
02:42:17,140 --> 02:42:17,560
Oh.

2419
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:19,380
I can't grab anything.

2420
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:21,680
What do I do if I can't?

2421
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:22,120
No.

2422
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:27,060
I can't do anything if I can't grab anything.

2423
02:42:31,130 --> 02:42:31,150
Oh.

2424
02:42:31,570 --> 02:42:31,790
Oh.

2425
02:42:32,290 --> 02:42:32,630
Oh.

2426
02:42:33,130 --> 02:42:33,350
Whoa.

2427
02:42:34,030 --> 02:42:34,470
Whoa.

2428
02:42:35,190 --> 02:42:37,150
I'm crash batting it.

2429
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:40,660
Arrow?

2430
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:41,600
Arrow.

2431
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:42,880
Arrow.

2432
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:48,420
Where the fuck is arrow?

2433
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:52,600
Aero?

2434
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:05,220
Did I fuck up?

2435
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:06,520
Guys, I think I fucked up.

2436
02:43:07,060 --> 02:43:08,340
I think I fucked up, guys!

2437
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:10,440
Oh!

02:43:10,660 --> 02:43:11,220
No, I didn't!

2439
02:43:11,380 --> 02:43:12,280
I'm so smart!

2440
02:43:12,620 --> 02:43:19,180
Listen carefully to the sound of an alarm clock, which will
automatically play if you are approaching a destabilizing

2441
02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:20,800
Oh, I don't like that.

2442
02:43:23,980 --> 02:43:25,800

Wait a minute.

2461
02:45:47,620 --> 02:45:49,400
Oh, it wasn't supposed to be big.

2462
02:45:50,360 --> 02:45:50,960
What?

2463
02:45:51,460 --> 02:45:54,000
It wasn't supposed to be big.

2464
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:55,860
Wait a minute.

2465
02:45:57,520 --> 02:45:59,520
If I put it here.

2466
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:02,920
Maybe?

2467
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:04,980
Wait a minute.

2468
02:46:05,740 --> 02:46:06,060
Okay.

2522
02:53:02,390 --> 02:53:03,930
Oh, no, why are you small now?

2523
02:53:04,650 --> 02:53:06,550
I don't remember how I make you big.

2524
02:53:07,330 --> 02:53:08,570
Oh, why are you so small?

2525
02:53:11,870 --> 02:53:13,330
No, you're too small.

2526
02:53:14,450 --> 02:53:16,590
Oh, there we go.

2527
02:53:16,850 --> 02:53:17,450
There we go.

2528
02:53:17,650 --> 02:53:17,950
There we go.

2529
02:53:18,190 --> 02:53:19,650
Wait, why are you not getting big?

2530
02:53:19,930 --> 02:53:20,790
I don't understand.

2531
02:53:21,430 --> 02:53:22,830
How am I fucking up?

2532
02:53:25,210 --> 02:53:27,470
How are you not getting big?

2533
02:53:30,590 --> 02:53:31,130
Okay.

2534
02:53:31,990 --> 02:53:32,290
All right.

2535
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:33,430
Hey, key bag.

2536
02:53:33,890 --> 02:53:34,170
Hello.

2537
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:37,310
Okay.

2538
02:53:39,650 --> 02:53:40,410
All right.

2539
02:53:44,490 --> 02:53:45,930
But it keeps getting small.

2540
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:51,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2541
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:54,040
Okay.

2542
02:53:55,360 --> 02:53:56,360
Are you big now?

2543
02:53:57,860 --> 02:53:59,100
Are you big?

2544
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:00,320
Oh, you're big.

2545
02:54:02,880 --> 02:54:03,640
Okay, there we go.

2546
02:54:03,740 --> 02:54:04,500
I did it!

2547
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:05,960
I'm tall now.

2548
02:54:06,700 --> 02:54:08,400
But in white space, I also...

2549
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:10,740
This is the greatest challenge I could imagine.

2550
02:54:11,940 --> 02:54:20,560
Because with a lifetime of life itself behind me, and all of
the weight that it carried, that seeing things the way I

2551
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:33,650
wanted to was not as easy as it used to be all right we're
going here now we're going here now

2552
02:54:40,970 --> 02:54:48,750
oh that's a big light switch oh okay I

2553
02:55:02,190 --> 02:55:05,030
Oh, because what you just heard, okay, okay.

2554
02:55:09,550 --> 02:55:09,830
Whoa.

2555
02:55:10,990 --> 02:55:11,530
That's it.

2556
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:16,160
Okay.

2557
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:18,800
I mean, you lost your mind.

2558
02:55:20,460 --> 02:55:21,000
I'm pretty good.

2559
02:55:21,340 --> 02:55:22,300
I don't know about you guys.

2560
02:55:22,480 --> 02:55:24,100
How much longer I'm going to stream for.

2561
02:55:24,500 --> 02:55:26,220
I'm no idea, Carl Slay.

2562
02:55:27,940 --> 02:55:30,720
Um, until this- Until I finish this game.

2563
02:55:30,940 --> 02:55:31,620
Apparently.

2564
02:55:34,140 --> 02:55:35,860
Oh yeah, do I go up?

2565
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:36,660
Oh.

2566
02:55:39,160 --> 02:55:41,100
Do I need to position itself again?

2567
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:44,800
Welcome back, sneaking.

2568
02:55:47,280 --> 02:55:48,400
20 afterwards?

2569
02:55:48,680 --> 02:55:49,740
I'm not sure yet.

2570
02:55:50,460 --> 02:55:51,200
I'm not sure.

2571
02:55:52,160 --> 02:55:53,180
I'm not sure yet.

2572
02:55:53,260 --> 02:55:54,220
I'm just...

2573
02:55:54,220 --> 02:55:55,560
Oh, blow you a kiss.

2574
02:55:56,300 --> 02:55:56,560
Mwah.

2575
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:57,000
Cool.

2576
02:55:57,820 --> 02:55:58,820
That's for autumn.

2577
02:56:02,690 --> 02:56:04,690
Oh, what do I do?

2578
02:56:05,690 --> 02:56:06,350
All right, one more.

2579
02:56:06,510 --> 02:56:08,090
I guess this is the hour.

2580
02:56:08,930 --> 02:56:09,750
This is the hour.

2581
02:56:10,950 --> 02:56:13,050
This is, oh, God, how do I get out of here?

2582
02:56:18,470 --> 02:56:20,510
How do I get out of here?

2583
02:56:20,770 --> 02:56:21,450
Oh, no.

2584
02:56:23,930 --> 02:56:24,810
What is...

2585
02:56:24,810 --> 02:56:25,050
Oh.

2586
02:56:37,320 --> 02:56:38,520
I'm looking up.

2587
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:40,740
Going up.

2588
02:56:40,940 --> 02:56:41,620
Do, do, do.

2589
02:56:42,700 --> 02:56:43,200
Oh!

2590
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:44,580
What the fuck?

2591
02:56:48,780 --> 02:56:49,540
I...

2592
02:56:49,540 --> 02:56:51,480
Yo, these instructions are not...

2593
02:56:51,480 --> 02:56:54,180
These instructions are not helpful at all.

2594
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:54,800
Oh,

2595
02:56:57,990 --> 02:56:59,550
I guess I go down now.

2596
02:57:06,210 --> 02:57:06,950
Hey.

2597
02:57:07,870 --> 02:57:08,830
Wasn't I just here?

2598
02:57:10,190 --> 02:57:10,510
Hello?

2599
02:57:12,030 --> 02:57:13,410
Wasn't I just here?

2600
02:57:15,710 --> 02:57:16,970
Hey guys.

2601
02:57:17,650 --> 02:57:18,730
I'm back again.

2602
02:57:21,960 --> 02:57:24,480
Maybe if I keep doing it...

2603
02:57:24,700 --> 02:57:36,920
If I keep doing it, and maybe if I keep doing it, maybe if I
just keep going through, I'll find the answer.

2604
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:43,660
That's, that's how this, oh no, I just go through the white,
I just, I just go through this.

2605
02:57:47,220 --> 02:57:48,320
It's all I have to do.

2606
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:49,060
All right.

2607
02:57:51,700 --> 02:57:53,600
You're well beyond dreaming now.

2608
02:57:54,700 --> 02:57:56,860
than anyone has ever come back from.

2609
02:57:56,900 --> 02:57:57,460
Oh, shit.

2610
02:57:57,720 --> 02:57:59,640
But we hope that you won't get disguised.

2611
02:57:59,660 --> 02:58:01,040
This watcher makes me feel giddy.

2612
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:02,060
Makes me laugh.

2613
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:03,500
Oh, that's really sweet.

2614
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:05,380
That's really sweet.

2615
02:58:05,920 --> 02:58:07,160
I'm glad you're having a good time.

2616
02:58:07,380 --> 02:58:09,680
Where a different point of view could make anything
possible.

2617
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:12,700
Isn't that why you came here?

2618
02:58:12,880 --> 02:58:13,520
Um, no.

2619
02:58:15,940 --> 02:58:19,080
You see, I needed the game for Variety Friday.

2620
02:58:19,660 --> 02:58:20,980
And so here we are.

2621
02:58:26,220 --> 02:58:26,740

Hello.

2780
03:09:46,850 --> 03:09:48,690
My name is Dr. Goyan Pierce.

2781
03:09:49,430 --> 03:09:50,750
And by now, you may...

2782
03:09:50,770 --> 03:09:57,710
have realized that all of this has happened exactly the way
it was supposed to oh hey there you see everyone who comes

2783
03:09:57,710 --> 03:10:03,650
to the institute does so because they feel that they are no
longer in control of something important to

2784
03:10:07,710 --> 03:10:12,310
them oh my god i actually haven't hydrated for three hours
chat what the Fuck.

2785
03:10:12,590 --> 03:10:16,170
I'm like, but more often than not, the problem is...

2786
03:10:16,170 --> 03:10:17,430
Yeah, I'm going to lose me some water right now.

2787
03:10:17,490 --> 03:10:18,590
Oh my gosh, my arm freaked out.

2788
03:10:18,690 --> 03:10:19,870
I'm going to lose some water right now.

2789
03:10:20,710 --> 03:10:21,470
Thanks for the reminder.

2790
03:10:21,570 --> 03:10:25,170
I'm so afraid of failure that we refuse to see our problem.

2791
03:10:27,610 --> 03:10:32,390
And so, we do the same things again and again and again.

2792
03:10:33,290 --> 03:10:37,470
And therein, of course, we find exactly the failure we were
looking for.

2793
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:47,480
Oh, I really retraced.

2794
03:10:47,620 --> 03:10:48,320
Oh, hey.

2795
03:10:49,640 --> 03:10:51,360
Oh, look, there's my bouncy castle.

03:10:52,100 --> 03:10:53,600

2801
03:11:07,210 --> 03:11:08,710
I wonder who could that be.

2802
03:11:14,130 --> 03:11:16,090
Your life will always be a struggle.

2803
03:11:16,850 --> 03:11:18,390
And you will always have to.

2804
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:22,850
But today, you have the chance to see things differently.

2805
03:11:24,010 --> 03:11:31,970
Even though it meant facing obstacles that seemed impossible
at first, You thought outside the box and you overcame them

2806
03:11:31,970 --> 03:11:34,450
because you saw things from every angle.

2807
03:11:34,570 --> 03:11:38,050
You understood them for what they really are.

2808
03:11:38,290 --> 03:11:39,510
I don't think so, dude.

2809
03:11:42,650 --> 03:11:46,210
Dude, I've been forced my entire way through.

2810
03:11:49,770 --> 03:11:52,770
I still don't know how to properly play this game.

2811
03:12:04,450 --> 03:12:05,490
What is this, Brandon?

2812
03:12:05,950 --> 03:12:08,450
Super little, but we're almost done with it, though.

2813
03:12:09,510 --> 03:12:11,450
You meant Bruce and yes, absolutely.

2814
03:12:13,510 --> 03:12:14,030
Hey.

2815
03:12:15,210 --> 03:12:16,990
Oh, I can't press the soda machine anymore.

2816
03:12:17,270 --> 03:12:19,210
In a few minutes, you'll be back in the real world.

2817
03:12:19,890 --> 03:12:23,090
And some part of you will say that none of this was real.

2818
03:12:23,730 --> 03:12:26,150
So how could it have really meant anything?

2819
03:12:27,570 --> 03:12:34,690
But just like the power of perspective itself, it would have
been as real as you believed it to be.

2820
03:12:35,950 --> 03:12:50,330
all you've got to do is wait here we are oh we did it i did
it

2821
03:12:54,990 --> 03:12:58,010
i did it

2822
03:13:02,710 --> 03:13:11,750
world record pace seven minutes damn Holy shit.

2823
03:13:12,470 --> 03:13:13,830
Can we beat the world record?

2824
03:13:13,910 --> 03:13:14,690
I think so.

2825
03:13:15,170 --> 03:13:17,110
It's like seven minutes, right?

2826
03:13:22,330 --> 03:13:23,890
Gratz, I'm thank you, everyone.

2827
03:13:24,630 --> 03:13:25,570
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2828
03:13:25,590 --> 03:13:28,070
I gotta submit it to the ADGDQDs.

2829
03:13:28,750 --> 03:13:29,730
I gotta submit it.

2830
03:13:29,890 --> 03:13:31,870
Now tell me, how do you make things bigger?

2831
03:13:36,950 --> 03:13:37,970
I still don't know.

2832
03:13:38,170 --> 03:13:38,810
I still don't know.

2833
03:13:40,510 --> 03:13:42,850
I still don't know how to play this game.

2834
03:13:43,230 --> 03:13:48,350
Honestly, I keep fucking up making things bigger and smaller
for some reason.

2835
03:13:50,650 --> 03:13:52,510
We're just trying to notice that...

2836
03:13:54,830 --> 03:13:56,390
Thank you so much for the follow, Brandon.

2837
03:13:56,550 --> 03:13:57,290
Thank you, thank you.

2838
03:13:57,290 --> 03:13:58,650
I really do appreciate it.

2839
03:13:58,950 --> 03:14:00,210
Have a play heart.

2840
03:14:00,390 --> 03:14:00,830
Thank you.

2841
03:14:02,150 --> 03:14:03,230
Holy shit.

2842
03:14:03,750 --> 03:14:05,030
I am so tired.

2843
03:14:05,290 --> 03:14:08,450
My brain was not supposed to think about...

2844
03:14:08,450 --> 03:14:11,730
Like, I think it broke the game, like, three or four times,
chat.

2845
03:14:12,350 --> 03:14:13,550
Like, I don't even think...

2846
03:14:13,550 --> 03:14:14,150
I think I...

2847
03:14:14,150 --> 03:14:15,090
The Apple...

2848
03:14:15,090 --> 03:14:16,210
The Apple Sage?

2849
03:14:16,770 --> 03:14:19,310
I think I brute-forced the Apple Sage.

2850
03:14:22,190 --> 03:14:27,650
I think I solved the Apple puzzle only by sheer luck.

2851
03:14:28,990 --> 03:14:32,710
By sheer luck and breaking the physics of the game.

2852
03:14:34,090 --> 03:14:35,430
The tiny apples.

2853
03:14:35,690 --> 03:14:38,430
I don't think the tiny apples are supposed to work that.

2854
03:14:38,450 --> 03:14:59,250
way chat I can't believe the little apples actually work oh
