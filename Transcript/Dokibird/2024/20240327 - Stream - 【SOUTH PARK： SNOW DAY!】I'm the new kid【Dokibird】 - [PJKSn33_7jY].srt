00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,980
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,620
Hello, hello!

3
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,500
Um, welcome to the launch of Snow...South Park...Snow...sorry.

4
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,320
South Park Snow Day!

5
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,520
I swear the more I stream, I guess like, my English is deteriorating.

6
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,540
I don't know if Sound Guy is alive today.

7
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,480
I hear Sound Guy will be...

8
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,980
Uh...oh he is!

9
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,800
He is alive!

10
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,460
Type in the YouTube chat!

11
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,440
I see...oh fuck!

12
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,100
Okay, what?

13
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,600
No!

14
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,520
I didn't mean to start!

15
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, alright, we're starting.

16
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,620
I had like an intro and everything planned, but like, I guess we're starting.

17
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,320
Isn't South Park always snowing?

18
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,300
Isn't that the whole thing?

19
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,220
Isn't it always snowing?

20
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,400
What?

21
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,420
When was there any other weather in South Park?

22
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,020
Yay!

23
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,180
People are dead!

24
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,020
That means school is cancelled!

25
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,320
Yay!

26
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,600
Storm is not going any further than stopping!

27
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,320
And with the snow piling up and roads icing...

28
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,940
Oh god, they're gonna cancel ski!

29
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,430
You see...

30
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,790
Did they cancel school yet?

31
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,650
Did they cancel ski?

32
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,510
Eric!

33
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,670
Yeah, but now...now it's different.

34
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,050
Now, instead...I think...I think I've heard about this.

35
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,290
Because now that like, we're so used to like, online learning from COVID...

36
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,290
Even if it's a snow day now, apparently some schools will just transition to like, online learning.

37
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,110
So they'll be like, school is cancelled!

38
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,990
That's okay!

39
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,410
We have online learning classes for you to go to instead!

40
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,010
So this doesn't matter anymore.

41
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,190
This was something we used to have.

42
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:09,990
Hahaha!

43
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,010
Hahaha!

44
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,650
Hahaha!

45
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,670
Back in my day, little Timmy, we had school days where we actually don't have to do schoolwork.

46
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,930
We didn't have good enough technology for online learning classes.

47
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,720
Did they cancel ski?

48
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,000
Did they cancel ski?

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Did they cancel ski?

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
Remember what they took from you?

51
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,940
City officials are warning that even first responders will be staying home today.

52
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,820
The roads are completely blocked.

53
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,920
There is no toilet paper anywhere!

54
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,220
What a bad ski!

55
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,080
This truly feels like the end of days.

56
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,660
Everyone, please, take care of yourselves!

57
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,460
It's okay.

58
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,880
Those people don't matter.

59
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,880
They're not main characters.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,400
Yay!

61
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,040
There's no ski!

62
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,860
No school!

63
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,260
That's a toilet paper!

64
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,860
There's no ski!

65
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,760
No, no, no ski!

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,740
There's no ski!

67
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,830
See you later, Mom!

68
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,890
I'll be back in a couple hours!

69
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,830
Have some brunch ready for me!

70
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:22,810
Nerd!

71
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,030
I'm going outside to play with my friends!

72
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,270
I don't think that's safe, sweetie!

73
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,890
Mom, it's a snow day.

74
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,690
I feel like this is just a React channel now.

75
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,250
I'm watching South Park.

76
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,190
Which I don't mind!

77
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,230
Today we're just going to be watching South Park episodes on the Doki Bird channel.

78
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:48,830
Snow

79
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,960
key!

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,440
Oh my god!

81
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,600
You're in 3D!

82
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,680
Oh my god!

83
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,660
No school, everybody!

84
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,240
Snow key!

85
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,660
No school!

86
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,520
Snow key!

87
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,220
Come on, brothers!

88
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,080
Let's go, Stan!

89
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,460
Snow day, everyone!

90
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,560
People are dying in the snow!

91
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,820
New kid, I'm talking to you!

92
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,800
That's me!

93
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:17,860
There you are!

94
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Come on, new kid!

95
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,420
New kid!

96
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,380
That's me!

97
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay, before I accidentally started the game...

98
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,780
Before I...

99
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,100
I wanted to talk about...

100
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,700
Usually I would have 10-15 minutes of Zazadan before I actually start the game.

101
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,380
But then I accidentally started the game.

102
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,280
So we had...

103
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,900
Anyway!

104
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,720
As I was saying...

105
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,900
The riskiest part about...

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,240
Um...

107
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:59,120
The riskiest part about playing a game on launch and then like not knowing if a game is good or not...

108
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,240
I was worried because...

109
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,960
Okay, like...

110
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,140
I love South Park.

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,580
I actually really like South Park.

112
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,460
I've been like keeping up to date with all the new South Park episodes.

113
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,660
And like I watched almost every episode of South Park.

114
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,380
I grew up watching South Park as well.

115
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,300
I shouldn't have.

116
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,620
But because like...

117
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,360
My parents didn't really know what I was watching when I was like home alone.

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,880
So then like, you know...

119
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,100
When my parents used to like own a restaurant...

120
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,420
They would leave me at home.

121
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,380
And then South Park would be playing.

122
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,120
And then I'd be watching it.

123
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,820
Like on TV on Comedy Central.

124
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,460
And I'd be like, yay!

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,900
South Park!

126
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,820
And I'd be like really young.

127
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,320
I shouldn't have been watching it.

128
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,960
Like I absolutely should not have been watching South Park.

129
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,720
Also...

130
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,620
Also...

131
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,320
I used to have like this...

132
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,720
One of my parents is like ex-friends.

133
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,200
They're not friends anymore.

134
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,820
But they had kids too.

135
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,420
So then like the older sister would like take...

136
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,240
Trick my parents into taking me to watch the South Park movie.

137
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,540
I was definitely way too young for that.

138
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,540
I had zero understanding of what the fuck I was watching.

139
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,800
And then I apparently...

140
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,700
My parents got really fucking mad.

141
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,680
When...

142
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,960
Because then the older sister was like...

143
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,720
Like my parents ex-friends like daughter was like...

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,980
No, it's an animation.

145
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,580
Like she can watch it.

146
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,220
And then...

147
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,480
So then she tricked my parents to like...

148
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,100
Because like she wanted to watch it.

149
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,040
So then like by doing so they're like...

150
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,940
Oh yeah, I'm gonna let Doki watch it with me.

151
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,560
So that like she's allowed to watch this movie.

152
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,160
Then they're like, oh, it's a kid's animated movie.

153
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,700
Yeah, you can totally bring little Doki over to like watch with you at the theater.

154
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,680
So...

155
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,120
So...

156
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,220
Like here's the money.

157
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,400
Here's some money.

158
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,140
So you can like treat yourself and watch that movie with little Doki.

159
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,320
And then, you know, I got taken to watch the South Park movie.

160
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,820
I like remember bits of it in my head.

161
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,700
I haven't rewatched...

162
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,980
I never rewatched this movie by the way.

163
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,720
But I still remember it because...

164
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,900
Because...

165
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,480
Because, you know, it was like I guess like PTSD because I was way too young.

166
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,640
And I was way too young.

167
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,460
And I should not have been...

168
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,960
I watched like music videos of the songs from that movie recently.

169
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,020
But yes, I was way too fucking young to be watching the South Park movie.

170
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,500
But that's why I'm like this.

171
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,100
That's why...

172
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,920
That's...

173
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,280
That's why I'm sort of like this.

174
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,000
Also, also, thank you Mr. Rich.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,460
Thank you.

176
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,820
Thank you.

177
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,580
Blame Canada.

178
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,040
Blame Canada.

179
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,900
Anyway.

180
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,300
Anyway.

181
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,560
And then...

182
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,900
So, I love South Park.

183
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,020
I 100% completed Stick of Truth.

184
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:23,180
I haven't touched the fractured but whole South Park game yet because that was like a game I really wanted to play on stream.

185
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,580
But I also was really worried because like I played Stick of Truth and I was like, I know that the Stick of Truth was incredibly...

186
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,260
I don't know if I ever want to stream Stick of Truth on stream because of how bad it is in terms of...

187
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,600
It's really bad.

188
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,200
It's so...

189
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,540
Like...

190
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:53,460
But I haven't spoiled anything for fractured but whole because like I don't want it because like this is like one of the rare moments where I don't want to be spoiled because like you have to be surprised.

191
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:53,580
I can't even try.

192
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,580
You have to go in completely blind for that game.

193
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,420
For the South Park games.

194
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:06,880
But the thing is, the only thing I know about the Fractured But Whole game, is the Diabetes Kid.

195
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,940
One of the cutscenes popped up in my recommended and I watched it.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,420
It was so fucking stupid.

197
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,260
It was so good.

198
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,560
But it was so... that was the only thing I remember.

199
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,220
Super Diabetes, yes.

200
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,940
That was the only thing I was able to spoil myself on.

201
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,780
But I have not... I don't know anything that's going on in that game.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,160
I know it's a sequel to the Stake of Truth.

203
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,160
But I didn't want to spoil it.

204
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,340
But I don't know if it's appropriate.

205
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,820
I don't know if it's appropriate to stream.

206
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,740
So...

207
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,380
So...

208
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,140
That's why I haven't streamed it yet.

209
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,660
Maybe one day.

210
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,380
One day.

211
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,700
Because I know Stake of Truth is so fucked up.

212
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,620
Anyway, I love South Park and I keep up to date with South Park.

213
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,100
But the thing about how risky it is to stream games on launch...

214
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,980
The thing is...

215
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,920
Is that...

216
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,920
So apparently we have to turn... Let me turn down a little bit first.

217
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,800
Is that... The thing about it is that...

218
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,340
I don't know how good the game is.

219
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,020
And then I checked the reviews for this game and I was so sad.

220
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
Because it's mixed reviews.

221
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,680
I was so sad.

222
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,120
I was like...

223
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,580
No!

224
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,300
The reviews!

225
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,680
It's mixed!

226
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,020
Because they've hit home runs on all their... on their last two games.

227
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,680
I was like... No!

228
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,520
And then... Okay, I don't... Look.

229
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,020
Okay.

230
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,800
IGN gave it a 3.

231
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,920
But like... It's IGN.

232
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,940
So I'm like... I don't know how much I can trust IGN.

233
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,800
I was like... IGN has said some really weird shit about video games.

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,860
So I never really cared much about IGN reviews.

235
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,420
But they gave it a 3.

236
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
And I was like... No!

237
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,620
Why is it mixed?

238
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm just like... Why?

239
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,480
Apparently, the issue is that this game is very expensive.

240
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,240
Like that is like one of the biggest issues for this game.

241
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,890
It's like... It's like way too expensive for how long...

242
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,000
It's apparently a 5 hour game max.

243
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,660
Or like minimum.

244
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,600
Oh sorry, minimum.

245
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,600
It's a minimum 5 hour game.

246
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,080
And it's like basically it's supposed to be like...

247
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,920
Like a hack and slash.

248
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,100
It's like a hack and slash.

249
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,620
And people were complaining.

250
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,600
About how...

251
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,860
5 hours for like a campaign and stuff.

252
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,720
But then they also said they're gonna add more to it.

253
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,080
They're gonna add...

254
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,760
They're gonna add more to the game later on.

255
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,400
But then people were like...

256
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,660
Whoa!

257
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,320
Why is it only 5 hours?

258
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,200
Because it's multiplayer.

259
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,980
There's multiplayer elements to it.

260
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,340
So we're gonna see ourselves.

261
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,900
We're gonna see ourselves.

262
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,560
Why this game is mixed.

263
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,020
We're gonna see.

264
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,140
By the way.

265
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,540
I bought the deluxe version.

266
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,600
So it was not just $30.

267
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,160
You can tell I have cred.

268
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,640
You can tell I paid a win.

269
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,600
I need people to know I paid a win.

270
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,860
Because I have cred right now.

271
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
Wait is cred the DLC?

272
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,440
I don't actually know.

273
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,100
I assume cred is the DLC.

274
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,000
So I spent...

275
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,380
I need...

276
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,360
I need people to know that I have cred.

277
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,380
I'm flashing that cred right here.

278
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,200
Alright.

279
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,160
Okay I should have...

280
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,280
Okay I...

281
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,620
Oh my god I can be a gnome.

282
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,120
Wait!

283
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,580
I can be a gnome?

284
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,020
Oh my god.

285
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,840
Get gnomed.

286
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,420
Every time you look at me you're gonna get gnomed.

287
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:07,980
Oh.

288
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,820
Okay.

289
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,780
Oh wait.

290
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,280
Let's have...

291
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,660
Okay.

292
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,920
Alright.

293
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,760
Yellow.

294
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,340
Yellow hair.

295
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,820
And then...

296
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,380
Do they have...

297
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,740
No they don't.

298
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,660
Okay.

299
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,340
Let's see.

300
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,820
They can't...

301
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,480
I can't be bug?

302
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,060
I can't be bugged?

303
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,540
That's fucked up!

304
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,700
I can't believe I can't be bugged.

305
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,840
Oh I can be!

306
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,160
Oh nice.

307
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,920
Guys.

308
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,860
I can be.

309
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,960
I can be balding.

310
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,380
That's good enough.

311
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,880
That's good enough for me.

312
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,600
That's...

313
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,920
Balding is good enough you know.

314
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,640
It's almost like bald.

315
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,380
I got cred.

316
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,620
I need people to know I paid $50.

317
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,580
I...

318
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,020
I...

319
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:06,900
I need people to know that I didn't wait for the reviews and I pre-ordered $50.

320
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,200
I pre-ordered for $50.

321
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,360
I pre-ordered for $50.

322
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,340
I need people to know that I am that shameless.

323
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,440
I did not read the reviews.

324
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,540
Okay.

325
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,160
Alright.

326
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,240
Let's see.

327
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,740
Oh I can be ginger.

328
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,620
Oh wait.

329
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,360
I could be ginger balding.

330
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,380
Wait!

331
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,440
It's not offensive because they are not real people.

332
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,400
I should be careful.

333
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,160
I should be careful what I say.

334
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,020
I...

335
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,460
I...

336
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:40,840
I...

337
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,340
I...

338
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,620
Okay.

339
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:42,980
Okay.

340
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm going to be, I'm going to be a ginger.

341
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,000
They have no soul.

342
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,520
It's true.

343
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,180
If South Park says it's true, then, then it has to be.

344
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,480
Right?

345
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:02,740
I take my facts from, I learn about my news from South Park because they are always up to date.

346
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,380
Yeah, I'm going to...

347
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,460
Oh you're ever going to do the soullister.

348
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,460
Oh my God!

349
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,840
There is emotes?

350
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:09,940
Nice.

351
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,160
Nice.

352
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,940
That's what I like to see.

353
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,940
Alright.

354
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
Do they actually have like... Oh my god!

355
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,760
They have the Snoopy dance!

356
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,660
This is it.

357
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,060
This is the real gameplay.

358
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,940
The dancing is the real gameplay.

359
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,900
Alright.

360
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,700
I'm done.

361
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,720
Finished.

362
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:28,960
That good?

363
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,760
What is this?

364
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,980
I don't know.

365
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,800
Clapping.

366
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,840
Alright.

367
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,220
Here we go.

368
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,120
I'm good.

369
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,920
I can be Ginger.

370
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,680
It's 10 out of 10.

371
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,860
Don't worry, mom.

372
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,940
Who's... Who got OP?

373
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,360
That can't be me.

374
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,880
Find the keeper of the rules.

375
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,340
Apparently, there's like online multiplayer too.

376
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,920
So, WASD to walk.

377
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,220
Okay.

378
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm using my control...

379
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,000
Let me... Let me use my controller!

380
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,500
No!

381
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,200
Alright, guys.

382
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,980
Apparently, I'm gonna be using my controller.

383
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,600
So... Apparently...

384
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,220
Alright.

385
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm gonna be using mouse and keyboard like a true PC bro.

386
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm gonna be... Okay.

387
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,520
Alright.

388
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,020
So, apparently, I need to turn down the music a little bit.

389
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,740
Alright.

390
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,640
Alright.

391
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,740
Sound guy.

392
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,800
Don't worry.

393
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,080
I'm turning down my music.

394
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,840
Let me know if everything is okay.

395
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,980
If I should make it louder.

396
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,740
Okay.

397
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,760
I need to remap.

398
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,880
Alright.

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,320
Let me turn down everything.

400
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,300
Alright.

401
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,060
It's alright.

402
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,520
I've always... I just wanted to play on mouse and keyboard anyway.

403
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,220
Jesus Christ.

404
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,580
Why is the sensitivity so fucking high?

405
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,060
Okay.

406
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,460
I better?

407
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,160
I love being so fucking stickler for this.

408
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,440
There you go.

409
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,040
That's a lot better.

410
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,460
Hey, you two.

411
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,260
Come meet me on the roof.

412
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,540
We gotta get you up to speed.

413
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,380
Alright.

414
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,840
Don't worry.

415
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,440
I got you.

416
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,680
I'm coming over, butters.

417
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,780
Is there actually no subtitles?

418
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,220
Okay.

419
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,000
Wait.

420
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,920
There actually is no...

421
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,960
Oh, there we go.

422
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,520
I was like...

423
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,620
I forgot accessibility.

424
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,340
Okay.

425
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,780
There we go.

426
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,980
I was gonna be like, where the fuck is the subtitles?

427
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,800
I'm like, okay.

428
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,480
I know you don't care so far.

429
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,220
But damn.

430
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,840
You don't care about reading.

431
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,220
You actually don't care.

432
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,060
Nice.

433
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,460
Okay.

434
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:39,660
Nice.

435
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,240
We have... We can read now.

436
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
We can read.

437
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,640
That's so nice.

438
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,540
Are we on Discord?

439
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,880
Oh my God!

440
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,300
We're on Discord!

441
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,920
Okay.

442
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,040
How do I get on top of the school?

443
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,460
There's South Park Elementary.

444
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,540
They understand that don't keep at...

445
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,620
Alright.

446
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,740
Here we go.

447
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,420
You can hide in deep snow to protect you from any projectiles.

448
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,080
And put you all you've been set on fire.

449
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,680
Stay in deep snow too long, however, will chill you with slows and deal damage.

450
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,640
How do I... Oh!

451
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,800
That's where I could hide.

452
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,800
Okay.

453
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,760
Discord is over.

454
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,920
The wizard says toilet paper is more precious than gold right now.

455
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,100
Pick some up, new kid!

456
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,640
Oh my God!

457
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,460
That's mine.

458
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,940
Use that toilet paper like real money.

459
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,980
Use it to buy a weapon.

460
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,600
It's okay.

461
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,180
He doesn't know.

462
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,780
Oh my God!

463
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,960
Toilet paper is money?

464
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,700
No!

465
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,240
I thought it was over!

466
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,480
Apparently, COVID is coming back.

467
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,400
Did you guys hear that?

468
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,820
It's never over.

469
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,140
Bro, this is...

470
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,100
So fucked up.

471
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,020
Alright.

472
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,920
Ooh, weapons!

473
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,340
Oh, Tolkien.

474
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,700
Not again!

475
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,620
It kind of never left.

476
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,620
We thought it left, but that was just us lying to ourselves.

477
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,360
Okay.

478
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,280
And then hold to release for maximum attack.

479
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:03,940
Oh, nice.

480
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,220
Alright.

481
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,380
Alright.

482
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,480
Bro, wake up!

483
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,900
It's 2020 again.

484
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,340
Ooh, upgrades!

485
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,720
Where is I?

486
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,860
No.

487
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,900
I...

488
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,700
I thought...

489
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,540
What?

490
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Self-park!

491
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,920
Powers and special skills.

492
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,680
I forgot.

493
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm the chosen one.

494
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,480
I'm the chosen one.

495
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,800
Powers and special skills you can use apart from your weapons.

496
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,260
You have gained your first power now.

497
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,260
But later, you can equip up to two powers at once.

498
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,320
Unlock new powers by completing milestones and exploring a self-park.

499
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,400
Alright.

500
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,380
Alright.

501
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,380
Is there like...

502
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,200
Oh my god, I can float.

503
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,700
No!

504
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,260
Please!

505
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,460
No!

506
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,100
No!

507
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:05,820
Alright.

508
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,980
Oh my god.

509
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,780
Bro, what the fuck happened to the school?

510
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,360
Holy shit!

511
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,300
I love how like the school looks amazing by the way.

512
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,960
And then there's me.

513
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,040
Like this looks actually really...

514
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,120
But like the background looks actually really good.

516
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,080
I just look so...

517
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,740
I don't look like I blend well with the background.

518
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,200
This is not fit at all.

519
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,180
It is.

520
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,440
Now look kids, I know school is closed.

521
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,540
But you should be at home doing remote learning.

522
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,200
No!

523
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,920
Get back home and see how it is.

524
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,600
Not remote learning!

525
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,280
I can't believe it.

526
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,760
Kids today will never know the joy of a snow day.

527
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,300
No!

528
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,680
You see those elf kids up there?

529
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,540
Go get them.

530
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,340
Remember, humans hate elves.

531
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,520
No, not the...

532
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,240
But what if I want to be an elf?

533
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,600
Hello new kid, hit it.

534
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,500
What if I want to be an elf?

535
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,440
Hold on fellas.

536
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,360
Oh my god.

537
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,760
No kid doesn't know how to dodge yet.

538
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,340
What do you mean?

539
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,620
Oh yeah, I actually don't.

540
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,240
I never dodge.

541
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay.

542
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,680
We gotta dodge by shift.

543
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,980
Okay, that seems easy.

544
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,000
That's alright.

545
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
They're younger than me.

546
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,940
Yeah, get those elves.

547
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
They're younger than me.

548
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,740
It's called survival of the fittest.

549
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,580
If you live through my slashes, you get to go to first grade.

550
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,300
Oh, we got you there.

551
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,220
Oh shit.

552
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,460
Oh wait, do I...

553
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,940
Oh, Butter's a healer!

554
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,580
He's like a medic!

555
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,560
That was great.

556
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,120
You totally got that one right in the face.

557
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,800
That was good.

558
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,880
What is this?

559
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,840
Soul Slayer?

560
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
Oh my god.

561
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,640
Finally a Soul Slayer game I like.

562
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,100
It's not actually Soul Slayer.

563
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,480
It's like a hack-and-slash, apparently.

564
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,840
Oop.

565
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
How did I miss?

566
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,220
I have to let go!

567
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,060
Okay.

568
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,220
Finally, the FPS portion of the game.

569
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,960
Okay, I definitely need to lower my sensitivity then.

570
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,780
Oh my god.

571
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,380
Look at me go.

572
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,400
Please.

573
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,640
Please stop running.

574
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,880
Oh, I can stop.

575
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,700
Okay, thank you.

576
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,200
I was gonna say.

577
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,920
I don't think I'm level up.

578
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:30,520
Wait, what is this elf doing here?

579
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,300
I thought we hate elves!

580
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,600
It's not racism.

581
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,960
Because they deserve-

582
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,740
I'm sorry.

583
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,540
I'm sorry.

584
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,360
Soap Park makes me a different person.

585
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,380
Get back here, elf!

586
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,740
Get back over here.

587
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,300
You're not real- You don't have rights.

588
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,560
You're an elf.

589
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,780
Oh shit!

590
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,580
It was a trap?

591
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,660
They're not human!

592
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,180
They don't have human rights!

593
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,220
And elf rights do not exist yet.

594
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,340
Yeah, we can tell Doki.

595
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,180
Alright, nice.

596
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,580
Plant a totem that heals you and your allies for sure.

597
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:23,740
Oh!

598
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,840
That's good!

599
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,860
Also sound- Has the sound been good so far?

600
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,020
Alright.

601
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,540
Plant a totem.

602
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,880
Oh, I get to heal.

603
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,160
Okay, E is healing.

604
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,380
Okay.

605
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,240
Yay!

606
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,300
Yay!

607
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,440
Alright.

608
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,060
Kids can only use powers once you're pissed off!

609
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,260
Your pissed off meters increases by taking or dealing damage.

610
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,120
Using powers will decrease leadiness.

611
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,000
If you can't use powers, fight with your weapons until you're pissed off again.

612
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,040
Nice.

613
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,040
Is that a fucking food?

614
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,160
Am I just eating snacks?

615
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,180
Oh shit, where are the elves?

616
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,380
Oh shit!

617
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,880
Where did it come from?

618
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,200
How did I forget?

619
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,560
Okay, I need to remember guys.

620
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,660
Oh my god, how do I weapon swap?

621
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,020
How do I weapon swap?

622
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,480
I forgot how to weapon swap!

623
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,520
I already forgot!

624
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,940
Oh my god!

625
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,040
I don't want to use my bow!

626
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,320
Buddies!

627
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,680
I'll be!

628
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,520
Where's A?

629
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,300
No, that's not A!

630
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,940
He's moving!

631
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,800
Oh!

632
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,980
It's just left click!

633
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,060
Oh my god, it's just left click!

634
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,160
I don't have to do anything.

635
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,300
It was just left click.

636
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,100
Right click was bow and then left click was sword.

637
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,840
Guys, I'm learning.

638
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,960
I should be a game tester.

639
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,560
Alright, there we go.

640
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,280
We're good, we're good.

641
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,560
We can do this.

642
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,840
We are so good at this game.

643
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,000
It's okay, I can't die.

644
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,440
Butter is just gonna heal me forever.

645
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,500
Great, thank you for the Akka soup!

646
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,080
Thank you!

647
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,720
The soup is for Elves Rice.

648
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,600
Justice for Elves!

649
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,380
Thank you for the Akka soup!

650
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,220
If a ginger said elves have no rights, that's when you know it's serious.

651
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,200
Alright, nice.

652
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,840
I should be a game journalist, honestly.

653
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,520
Okay, flying daggers.

654
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,240
Dagger dive does 4 more damage after 0.3 seconds.

655
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,480
Creates a gas cloud that lingers.

656
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:35,040
Your arrow stuns distant enemies for 6 seconds and do 100% more damage?

657
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,760
Oh my god!

658
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,860
I already have a Oh, it's a legendary upgrade!

659
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,680
Nice.

660
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,880
I'm gaming.

661
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,320
Thank you, Jimmy.

662
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,160
I really appreciate it.

663
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,680
Now where do I go?

664
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,500
Wait, there's more?

665
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,600
Oh god.

666
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,000
Okay, give me a sec.

667
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,100
I wanna use my cool-off-ass ability.

668
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:51,840
I'm dead.

669
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
I can't believe they got actual kids to do this.

670
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,200
You know like for the kids voice acting?

671
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,520
Uh...

672
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,760
Like Trey gets his child to do the voice acting?

673
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,500
I think they get like actual staff kids.

674
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,560
They actually get like the staff's children to do the voice acting for the kids.

675
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,780
Which is like, you know...

676
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,120
I guess you don't have to pay them?

677
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,320
You just pay yourself?

678
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,940
At that point?

679
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,800
Yeah, they're actual real kids.

680
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,340
Yeah!

681
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,160
Yeah, his daughter does like some of the children voice acting.

682
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,160
Alright, let's get the audio in.

683
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,160
We gotta boost up the sound effect by 5.

684
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,480
And then we gotta go to the next level.

685
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,520
And then...

686
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,840
Bring down the music by 5.

687
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,660
Okay.

688
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,240
Let me know if it's okay now, Soundgath.

689
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,820
Okay, uncommon.

690
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,300
Thank god they put... I always forget the colors.

691
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,720
I always forget the colors for like the rarity.

692
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,600
So I'm so...

693
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,620
glad that they actually tell me.

694
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,480
Cause I always forget.

695
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,300
Alright.

696
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,280
Far escape deals 30% more damage and pulls enemies inwards.

697
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,280
Nice.

698
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,200
Wait, can I not buy it?

699
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:05,700
Can I pour?

700
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,460
Choose an upgrade?

701
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,200
I want this.

702
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,620
Oh!

703
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,100
Upgrade!

704
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,360
To get... Oh!

705
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,620
They're forcing me to upgrade!

706
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,660
What if it's good?

707
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,900
Nevermind, this is not good.

708
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,360
Thank you.

709
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,740
Oh my gosh, they know.

710
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,260
Children don't fucking read.

711
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,760
All upgrade cards have a level each of which offers...

712
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:30,880
Yeah!

713
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,580
Okay.

714
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,620
Can upgrade rarity for a bribe!

715
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:33,900
Oh!

716
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,140
It's a bribe!

717
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,760
Nice.

718
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,940
Teacher says corruption.

719
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,600
Okay, double tapping a target with blow creates 10 damage.

720
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,940
6 meter blast.

721
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,360
Wait, that's so good.

722
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,740
However, to promote...

723
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,360
Can I promote it even more?

724
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,540
Ultra legendary!

725
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,280
Nice.

726
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,440
Doki plans to be an IGN game trip.

727
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,660
My only issue...

728
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,020
Is that I don't read.

729
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,880
Other than that...

730
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,520
Oh My God, he's a bigger ELF!

731
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,740
Why are they feeding these ELF children?

732
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Oh my god.

733
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,180
I knew it.

734
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,700
I knew...

735
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,780
We shouldn't trust these ELFs.

736
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,520
Get off.

737
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,260
Get away from me.

738
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,260
My only issue is that I don't read.

739
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,800
The moment I figured out the mechanics.

740
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,300
I'm out of game journalism territory.

741
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,560
Like...

742
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,760
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

743
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,440
There's so many of them.

744
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,280
Okay, don't worry.

745
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,240
See, we got this.

746
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,380
But it's so smart though to getting your kids to like...

747
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,560
get your kids to do the voice acting because then you're technically paying yourself, you know?

748
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,260
You're technically just paying yourself so you don't lose money.

749
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,760
Whoa!

750
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,020
Nice, I got free labor.

751
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,300
Look at that.

752
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,460
They get bigger and louder.

753
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,700
So true.

754
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,640
Yay, TP!

755
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,680
Wait, how do I open up multiplayer so you guys can join us?

756
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,420
Wait, what's the point?

757
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,720
Bullshit!

758
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,740
What's bullshit?

759
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,600
Enemy leaders can play bullshit cards during combat to gain an unfair advantage.

760
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,600
Bullshit powers are limited to only a few uses, but they're really powerful.

761
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,360
Just now, Kyle just upgraded one of his elven swarmers to a vampire.

762
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,540
What the f-?

763
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,860
There's va- There's vampires in my fucking fantasy, mythical shit?

764
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,180
What is this?

765
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,980
Increased health and new attacks.

766
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,820
What?

767
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,000
Vampires?

768
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,660
I thought we're Lord of the Rings!

769
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,540
There's no vampires in my Lord of the Rings ripoff!

770
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,880
Okay, get him.

771
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,800
Get him.

772
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,600
Team Edward.

773
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,800
Vampires are fantasy.

774
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,640
Vampires are fantasy.

775
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,660
Vampires are fantasy.

776
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,940
Yeah, but it's medieval fantasy.

777
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,720
We're being like, stickier here.

778
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,700
That's why it's bullshit.

779
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,780
It's Castlevania now.

780
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:50,140
So, as you can see, we've had to make some changes to the game because some asshole who we won't name decided to become all powerful and ruin the stick of truth.

781
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,180
Not me.

782
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,400
That's different, you kid.

783
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,040
So then we played superheroes and guess what happened?

784
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,960
That same someone got all OP again and fucking ruined that game too.

785
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,140
And now because of that someone- Not my fault you're bad at the game, Cartman.

786
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,820
And then once there were rules, everyone started arguing over the rules.

787
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,240
And then we all went to war again.

788
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,300
Remember, with this new card-based system, you're only as powerful as the cards in your hand.

789
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,900
And you only get two to start with.

790
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,780
Yeah, because aliens are real!

791
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,420
I'm sure you'll manage.

792
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,600
Don't worry.

793
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,840
I don't need to ruin this game if the game ruined it himself.

794
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,660
Because this is America.

795
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,000
So, you are now the king of two cards.

796
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,300
Congratulations.

797
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,420
That's me!

798
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,040
Now, Libby.

799
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,260
Clyde has information that the elves-

800
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:49,780
Yeah, you heard that?

801
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,740
I'm the real one.

802
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,340
Yeah, me.

803
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,740
I have Cray.

804
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,620
What?

805
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,180
The best new kid to me.

806
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,360
You're the important one.

807
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,740
But I have Cray!

808
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,640
Good luck!

809
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,720
How can I not be number one?

810
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,980
I paid like $20 more than the other regular children!

811
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,240
That's actual bullshit!

812
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,040
What's the point of paying more money if I'm not number one?

813
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
Three plus one.

814
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,500
Why am I always wife number four?

815
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,600
Come here and I'll show you how to wage war on my behalf.

816
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,760
And bring your friends.

817
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,820
If they're not pussies.

818
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:30,980
Okay.

819
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,520
Yeah.

820
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,680
This is my war table.

821
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,200
You can choose your mission on the map.

822
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,960
And tell me when you're ready to head to the front lines.

823
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,700
If you want to join someone else's game, you can totally just be a follower.

824
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:39,880
Okay.

825
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,300
Select matchmaking button.

826
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,660
Oh, okay.

827
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:42,900
Wait.

828
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,380
I want to talk to the other kids.

829
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,120
Here, take a look.

830
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,560
Oh, these are like the upgrades that you can get.

831
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:48,860
Meet your typical baby.

832
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,060
Select the psycho radians to see how they scale.

833
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,560
Pretty neat, huh?

834
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,380
Okay.

835
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,400
And then change levels.

836
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,480
Select the option train with brothers again by selecting tutorial buttons.

837
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,060
What do you mean?

838
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,020
I'm talking about the books of laws.

839
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,540
Thank God.

840
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:02,900
Okay.

841
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,200
I was like, I actually don't want to do the tutorial.

842
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Alright, let's see.

843
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,500
What else is there?

844
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,380
Is this like the lobby?

845
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Oh, hey, Tweek!

846
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,600
Hey, Tweek.

847
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,740
What is this?

848
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,380
Come back with at least 50pp.

849
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,540
Is that toilet paper?

850
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,140
Tweek and I run the shop together.

851
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,560
He handles the finances.

852
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,680
Oh my gosh, so romantic.

853
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,840
I love... I don't know if you guys ever watched the episode where they like hooked them up.

854
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,220
But they actually use like real fan art.

855
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,080
Like real like shipping fan art for their episode.

856
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,120
Like they didn't draw that.

857
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:41,820
They were like, hey guys, if you're like a Tweek live shipper, send us some fan art so we can...

858
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,320
Oh my God.

859
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,240
You're a new kid, aren't you?

860
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,520
It's me, Mr. Hankey.

861
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,420
I thought you got fucking phased out.

862
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,820
I brought some Christmas magic with me.

863
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
You want some?

864
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,160
I would never thought I'd see 3D Mr. Hankey.

865
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,740
I can give you a taste if you want.

866
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,140
I don't know how comfortable.

867
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,200
I don't know how comfortable.

868
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,420
I am about this.

869
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,240
What is it, Dark Matter perks?

870
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,500
What the fuck is this?

871
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,460
either way you can head back to the war table whenever you're prepared.

872
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,580
And if you bring it here, you can use it to expand yourself past your limits.

873
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,360
Give it a try.

874
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,360
I want to be stronger.

875
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,940
Yeah, I want to be stronger with bows.

876
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,060
We bought this game?

877
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,180
Keep taking in that damage!

878
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,340
And you don't know about Mr. Hankey?

879
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
He's the Christmas spirit!

880
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,540
Because we all have a little Mr. Hankey inside of us.

881
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,920
No matter what.

882
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,300
He's the Christmas spirit!

883
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,720
Alright, let's see.

884
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,080
Armor!

885
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,720
Oh, this is like gear and stuff.

886
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,340
Alright, what's this?

887
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,500
Oh, look at that!

888
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,500
A toolkit!

889
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,380
Hahaha!

890
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,660
Hahaha!

891
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,040
Oh?

892
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,080
Not prepared.

893
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:02,840
Wizard staff?

894
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,860
Oh!

895
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,860
A lot of fireballs that burn many targets at once.

896
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,820
Charge up for it.

897
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,900
Oh, I want to try magic!

898
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,000
Ah, yes.

899
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,500
Tolkien.

900
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,420
It's always been Tolkien.

901
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,360
Do you know like, ever since the Tolkien episode, they like, they...

902
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
They like, changed the...

903
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,200
They changed every official, like, Wikipedia episode guide.

904
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Like, every official online information about Tolkien to Tolkien.

905
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,620
The moment that episode...

906
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,940
This is like, actual gaslighting.

907
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,300
Hahaha!

908
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,040
Yeah, they switched the subtitles.

909
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,860
It's actually crazy that they went through all that.

910
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,340
Leave the matchmaking...

911
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,100
Okay, hold.

912
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:51,600
I won.

913
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,760
Woo!

914
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,580
Okay, and then...

915
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,340
Hold and release.

916
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,420
Oh, I can like, do like a strong fire blast too.

917
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,640
How do I leave the matchmaking?

918
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,220
Do I just like...

919
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,540
Oh, I just have to queue up and then release it again.

920
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,960
Banana, thank you for the super chat!

921
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,660
Thank you, thank you!

922
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,120
Mr. Hanky is just talking about probiotics.

923
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,580
Thank you for the super chat.

924
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,160
Thank you, thank you.

925
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,340
You can join someone else's game if you want.

926
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,180
Not everyone is cut out for the glory of leadership.

927

00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,150
I'm like at least in, what, fourth grade or fifth grade?

1148
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,430
I can't tell.

1149
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,270
I'm like eternally stuck in like elementary school.

1150
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,530
So I'm like third... I'm like fourth or fifth grade.

1151
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,050
But I know these children are kindergartners.

1152
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:43,470
That's right.

1153
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:44,930
That's right.

1154
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,890

1156
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,170
They don't have names, guys, because they're not the main character.

1157
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,410
See, I told you!

1158
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,030
Guys, I told you!

1159
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,510
They were stuck in traffic!

1160
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:00,010
They don't have names because it's a bug, chat.

1161
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,630
They don't have names.

1162
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,410
It's a bug.

1163
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,410
It's a bug!

1164
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,750
That's why you don't see any names.

1165
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,250
Wait, where did they go?

1166
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,430
Sorry, they had to go back home.

1167
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,550
Sorry, guys.

1168
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,490
They had to like go home because...

1169
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,970
There was like issues with the internet.

1170
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,670
So they had to get the internet fixed.

1171
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,530
Don't worry.

1172
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:30,930
Don't worry.

1173
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,370

00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,110
I don't know if there's like fall damage.

1180
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,610

1181
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:46,930

00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,490

1184
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:55,410

1186
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,270

Oh, I need to grab some toilet paper.

1192
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,890
Why do all these children have toilet paper?

1193
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,010
I'm like confused about that.

1194
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,130

1195
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,050

1208
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:38,750

1209
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,070

1210
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,190
I knew Broku was in my...

1211
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,530

1217
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:54,990

1219
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:57,850

00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,970

1223
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,330

1226
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,030
So nice of the dragoons to help you on your quest.

1227
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:17,890
I know, right?

1228
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,610
You guys didn't see them in the lobby because they were busy like connecting to the internet.

1229
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,150
The dragoons that got into my lobby, they have really shitty internet.

1230
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,010
So they cut in and out.

1231
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,250
The young ones are always the most vicious.

1232
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,910
Oh my god, there's so many of the fucking kids.

1233
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,810
Oh my god, why are they all Ls?

1234
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,970
Why don't they all want to join the cool human squad?

1235
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,390
Goddamn Kylo.

1236
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:44,590
Propaganda.

1237
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:45,450
It got to them.

1238
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,990
There's always like this like question of like who would win.

1239
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,790
You versus like a hundred elementary kids.

1240
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,610
Not the bow.

1241
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:57,810
All right, here you go.

1242
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:58,830
It's not even a bow.

1243
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,230
It's a fucking...

1244
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,770
No, who put bullshit?

1245
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,350
What do they do?

1246
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:07,370
Reanimate?

1247
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:11,490
I literally killed one guy.

1248
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:20,450
I like how they put the bullshit thing out and it was literally one guy.

1249
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:21,910
That's fine.

1250
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,330
That's fine with me.

1251
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:24,230
It was one guy.

1252
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,610
I'm fine with that.

1253
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:26,550
I'm fine with that.

1254
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,030
Kyle, you fucking idiot.

1255
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,630
I only killed one person.

1256
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,490
Okay.

1257
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,490
Let's just head him over here.

1258
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,830
I feel like bows would be better.

1259
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:38,710
I don't know.

1260
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,950
The...

1261
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:42,410
Oh, I can have my dragoons kill all of them.

1262
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,850
My very real dragoons.

1263
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,110
Go my very real dragoons.

1264
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:53,090
Wait, are they eternal?

1265
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:53,810
No, they're not.

1266
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:56,290
Do they also get stunned by the mud?

1267
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:56,810
They do.

1268
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,150
Okay, we're fine.

1269
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,450
It's fine.

1270
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:00,450
I have totem pole.

1271
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,210
I don't have...

1272
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:02,970
I have totem pole.

1273
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,310
Snack break!

1274
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,870
They're so real.

1275
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:07,850
They are.

1276
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,810
It's just bugging out that the name isn't on there.

1277
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,870
Guys, this game literally just came out, chat.

1278
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,330
This game literally just came out.

1279
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,710
There's like, you know, there's like features there that's not like properly implemented.

1280
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,170
So like, day one, day one...

1281
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,450
No!

1282
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,170
I can't use my fucking heals!

1283
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:26,270
No!

1284
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,570
I can't use my heals again!

1285
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,590
We just gotta accept that day one is not perfect.

1286
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,230
They just undamaged.

1287
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:33,630
Yeah.

1288
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,750
Yeah, there's stream sniper mode on.

1289
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,130
I had stream sniper mode on.

1290
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:37,830
So...

1291
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:38,930
Oh, the goth kids?

1292
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,290
Why are the goth kids here?

1293
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,830
Do you seek the powers of those beyond our plane?

1294
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,170
Hello, Henrietta.

1295
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:46,990
Hey, Doki, you're so cool.

1296
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,670
Can I borrow $30?

1297
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,510
For asking you to the super chat?

1298
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:52,090
Thank you.

1299
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:52,630
Thank you.

1300
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:53,690
All right.

1301
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,750
What do you want, goth kid?

1302
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:56,250
Hey, Jimmy asked for my money.

1303
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,150
I want my help with your like game or whatever.

1304
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,990
These are dark ritual cards.

1305
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,850
They can manifest power beyond the mundane.

1306
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,450
But some of them come at a price.

1307
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,290
It's up to you what you're willing to sacrifice for wealth and power.

1308
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:14,310
Anyway, go ahead and like pick one.

1309
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,210
What is this?

1310
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,330
Bottomless?

1311
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,210
Replenish all zero expended bullshit uses.

1312
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,570
Join powers of deception.

1313
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,570
Raise the level of all upgrade cards by one.

1314
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,130
Sacrifice extended dark aura for 60 dark matter.

1315
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:29,350
Wait, what?

1316
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,590
Dark aura for 60 dark matter.

1317
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,010
Do I want dark matter?

1318
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:36,590
I feel like...

1319
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,930
Raise the level of all your upgrade cards.

1320
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,370
I feel like I don't really need that.

1321
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,790
My dragoons will be fine.

1322
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,530
Sacrifice to the darkness.

1323
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:46,450
Nice.

1324
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,290
There's not much to do around here.

1325
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:48,930
That's fine.

1326
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,710
My very real dragoons don't need extra healing.

1327
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:55,550
Okay, I'm at Stark's Pop.

1328
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,530
My very real dragoons will be fine.

1329
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,070
Hard difficulty is for babies.

1330
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,130
Fucking calling me journalist mode.

1331
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:06,490
What is this?

1332
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:10,010
Wait, where do I go?

1333
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:11,890
Why is there...

1334
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,050
Do I go to the ice?

1335
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,730
They're real!

1336
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,470
Why does no one believe me?

1337
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,910
My dragoons go to another school in Canada.

1338
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:23,990
Sorry, in America.

1339
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:25,290
I'm sorry.

1340
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:25,530
I'm sorry.

1341
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,890
My very real dragoons in America.

1342
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,550
Oh, thank God.

1343
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:34,790
You gotta help me.

1344
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,250
Randy?

1345
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,230
Lord?

1346
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,710
I got stuck in the ice.

1347
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,190
But I hit the jackpot.

1348
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:41,510
Look at all this toilet paper.

1349
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,070
You gotta find a way to break the ice and get me out of here.

1350
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:46,590
Hurry, my balls are bleeding.

1351
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:47,470
Wait, he has a nose?

1352
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:48,570
Elven treasure.

1353
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,890
This looks like a trap.

1354
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,290
I bet Kyle's behind this.

1355
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,610
Oh, yeah, Kyle.

1356
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,730
Yeah, I can help you get Kyle.

1357
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,510
Just get him out of here.

1358
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,470
I'll give you some treasure, too.

1359
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,110
Oh, no, he's stuck.

1360
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,370
This is Tegrity Farms, Randy?

1361
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,770
Or Pre-Tegrity Farms?

1362
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:05,930
I'm gonna say it.

1363
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,330
I don't like Tegrity Farms, Randy.

1364
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,810
I miss old Randy.

1365
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,290
Find gas and keys.

1366
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,910
Where is the fuck is...

1367
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,270
Why can't I just burn him out?

1368
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,130
I have fire.

1369
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,650
Actually, I miss old Randy.

1370
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,510
I think Tegrity Farms, Randy is like...

1371
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,070
They...

1372
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:25,310
They...

1373
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,490
They...

1374
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,390
They pushed too hard on the character.

1375
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,110
No DLC in this standard.

1376
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,130
Wait, what's that?

1377
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:32,770
There's like stuff here.

1378
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,170
There's like stuff over there.

1379
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:36,790
What is that?

1380
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:37,550
Is that bowling ball?

1381
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:39,430
What the fuck is that?

1382
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,070
Wait, that is a bowling ball.

1383
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,330
Elves must have run off somewhere.

1384
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,810
Can I not free this?

1385
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,070
This is literally fireball magic.

1386
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:49,830
It's real fireball magic.

1387
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,890
Yeah, I miss old Randy.

1388
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,490
I think like that's like...

1389
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,050
One of the changes I didn't like with the new South Park.

1390
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:03,450
I'm like okay with the new South Park, but like Tegrity Farms, Randy was just too much.

1391
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,030
I think they did like...

1392
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:09,050
I think it ruined the Randy character for me.

1393
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,830
Because they tried to make him like...

1394
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:12,350
They tried...

1395
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,670
Because now they just...

1396
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,130
It's just too much Randy.

1397
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,950
It's too much Randy.

1398
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,510
But it's not like good Randy too.

1399
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:22,870
What are you doing?

1400
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,610
You barbecuing?

1401
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,330
Wait, how do I do this?

1402
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:32,910
Entering campsite.

1403
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,630
What the fuck was the bowling ball for?

1404
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,330
I don't know what the bowling ball for.

1405
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:45,490
Yeah, my...

1406
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,930
Me and my real dragoons are going to kick your ass.

1407
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,170
They have shields now!?

1408
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,730
What the fuck?

1409
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:52,590
Dragons!

1410
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:54,150
My very real dragolins!

1411
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,170
My very real dragolins!

1412
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:55,890
Where are you?

1413
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:57,690
What?

1414
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,230
How are they doing that?

1415
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:07,510
Guys!

1416
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,450
There you are!

1417
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,730
I know you guys were here!

1418
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:11,650
I knew you guys came!

1419
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:16,630
I told you!

1420
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,690
I told you they're real!

1421
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,610
The internet got out.

1422
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,970
Look, it was an internet issue but they're here now!

1423
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,030
They're here now, chat!

1424
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:27,410
Look!

1425
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:28,690
Look, there they are!

1426
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:30,430
There they are!

1427
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,590
The dial-up!

1428
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,230
It worked!

1429
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,690
I'm sorry, a lot of them are on dial-up right now.

1430
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,070
Mom had to use the phone.

1431
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:44,890
Mom had to use the phone but they're here now.

1432
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,390
Remember when Annie was on the wheel of the fort?

1433
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:47,750
No!

1434
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,670
Not the real Annie!

1435
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:49,170
The wheel of the fort!

1436
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:50,250
No!

1437
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,690
We're just playing.

1438
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:51,990
Okay.

1439
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:54,490
Alright, get over here.

1440
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,350
Get over here.

1441
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,350
I'm trying my best to kill the healer dragoons!

1442
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:02,210
What are you trying to say?

1443
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,390
Australian internet.

1444
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:05,210
Yeah, yeah.

1445
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,350
One of them is on Australian internet.

1446
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,030
The other is on dial-up.

1447
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:15,930
And then the other two, they're using data right now to play in America.

1448
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,670
So that's why they're cutting in and out.

1449
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:20,590
I have to wait for them.

1450
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:21,910
My very real dragoons.

1451
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,610
AOL dragoons.

1452
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,070
Yay!

1453
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,250
We gotta find the key.

1454
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,090
Oh wait, there's like toilet paper here.

1455
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,250
Toilet paper.

1456
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:32,990
Toilet paper.

1457
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:34,690
Nice.

1458
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,930
Alright, toilet paper.

1459
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,910
They're in the tunnel.

1460
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:43,230
Yeah, every time they disappear, they're going through a tunnel.

1461
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,030
Chat.

1462
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:45,770
It makes perfectly sense.

1463
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:49,470
See?

1464
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:51,930
Oh no, they drove through a tunnel again.

1465
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,030
Ziplining is stupid.

1466
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:54,830
Elves are stupid.

1467
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:55,630
It all makes sense.

1468
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,310
Don't get distracted by the ziplines.

1469
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,810
They look way more fun than they are.

1470
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:01,970
The elves probably hid the keys in the back near the office.

1471
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,910
Why are they hiding Randy's keys?

1472
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:08,410
Alright, let's see.

1473
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,030
Oh my god.

1474
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:11,710
DRAGOONS!

1475
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:12,890
GET OUT OF THE TUNNEL!

1476
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:16,930
DRAGOONS THE TUNNEL!

1477
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:19,150
OH MY GOD!

1478
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,030
ONE OF THEM IS OUT OF THE TUNNEL NOW!

1479
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:21,870
Nice.

1480
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,530
Look at them.

1481
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:27,650
They came out of the fucking... you can tell they were in the tunnel because they just suddenly lagged in.

1482
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:28,590
You can tell.

1483
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,230
Look at that.

1484
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,390
They're back.

1485
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,290
What the fuck was that?

1486
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,090
Oh, it's the magic.

1487
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:42,810
It's the magic elves.

1488
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:44,570
Okay, don't worry.

1489
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:45,270
I have fire.

1490
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:47,830
Don't worry.

1491
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:52,810
Where the fuck are the other... wait, where the... why do I only have two friends?

1492
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:58,730
Wait, why do I only have two friends?

1493
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,070
Do I only have two viewers?

1494
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,450
Me and my two viewers.

1495
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:03,070
That's fine.

1496
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,990
That's fine.

1497
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:08,910
Even if Doki has one fan, I'm one of them.

1498
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,150
If Doki has zero fans, it's because I'm dead.

1499
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,690
Only the real homies are here.

1500
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:19,730
Alright, let's see.

1501
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,650
We gotta get over there.

1502
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:22,970
How the fuck do I get over there?

1503
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,490
Oh wait, there's the gopkin!

1504
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,810
How the fuck do I get over there?

1505
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:31,810
I don't know.

1506
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,170
That's a real... a real goon right there.

1507
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,330
Oh my god, fucking hiding in the snowman?

1508
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,750
Those are elf tactics.

1509
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,130
Fight me like a real human!

1510
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,870
That's fucking right.

1511
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:51,810
So real.

1512
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:52,450
Okay.

1513
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,490
Wait, how the fuck did this dragon get up there?

1514
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,950
How did you guys get up there?

1515
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,210
Alright, let me grab some loot real fast.

1516
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:04,770
Alright.

1517
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:06,830
Let me grab this.

1518
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,790
And then... talk to the goth kid.

1519
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:11,290
Hello.

1520
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,910
I would like some upgrades, please.

1521
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,310
Prince of Ravens grants 20 dark matter.

1522
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,390
Replenish all zero.

1523
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,750
Grants 100 toilet paper?

1524
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,270
Okay, 100 toilet paper.

1525
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:23,810
Well, it makes sense.

1526
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,730
Remember, the real power comes from inside.

1527
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,090
Wait, number two has a name!

1528
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:31,190
Oh my god!

1529
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:34,010
I mean, they were... I mean...

1530
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:39,370
I told you it was a bug!

1531
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:42,650
I knew they were real all along!

1532
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,210
Can't believe you came in.

1533
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,230
But maybe you can find another way up and over the tree.

1534
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,450
What do you mean he's actually real?

1535
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:48,770
They've always been real.

1536
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,390
They've always been real, chat.

1537
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:52,950
What the fuck do you mean?

1538
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:56,490
Oh my god, they hot fixed it!

1539
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,530
Chat, they hot fixed the game!

1540
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,410
Now you can actually see the names!

1541
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,210
Is that fucking crazy?

1542
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,150
Where the fuck am I going?

1543
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:07,830
They're real.

1544
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:08,970
I told you.

1545
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,510
No one believed my dragoons that go to school in America.

1546
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,910
No one believed.

1547
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,150
Well, sucks to be them.

1548
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,450
Wait, who the fuck is this guy?

1549
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,190
There's an invisible elf.

1550
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,470
There's an invisible elf right here.

1551
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:24,870
We will be fine.

1552
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,230
We collected the keys.

1553
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:27,290
We can leave now.

1554
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:28,350
Let's go!

1555
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,010
Wait, it's snowed in.

1556
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:30,670
We can't leave.

1557
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:31,570
Never mind.

1558
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,670
Apparently we actually have to kill all of you guys.

1559
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,230
Alright, give me a sec.

1560
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,510
We have to apparently kill all of them.

1561
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:40,110
I knew it.

1562
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,750
I fucking... everyone called me crazy.

1563
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:50,870
Everyone fucking called me crazy about my dragoons that go to school in America.

1564
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:53,410
Alright, nice.

1565
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,450
Is that all of them?

1566
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:56,990
No, we have to kill all these elves!

1567
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,470
Who the fuck wants to be an elf?

1568
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,110
Oh my gosh, how do I get over there?

1569
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,390
How do I get over there?

1570
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:09,170
Oh my god, how the fuck do I get over there?

1571
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:12,310
Okay.

1572
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:13,410
Okay.

1573
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:13,790
I did it!

1574
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:14,750
This is it!

1575
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,250
We got this!

1576
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,610
We got this, my real dragoon!

1577
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,850
We're gonna do this together!

1578
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:28,710
No, the shield.

1579
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,330
The shield, people.

1580
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:33,030
What do you mean?

1581
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,050
I can deal with this!

1582
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:37,210
Okay.

1583
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:38,350
Nice, we got this.

1584
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:39,210
Okay.

1585
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:39,930
You know what?

1586
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,090
I think I might have to use...

1587
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:42,550
I think I have to use this.

1588
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,810
It's bullshit time!

1589
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,650
It's bullshit time!

1590
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:47,970
Oh, victory.

1591
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,930
We did it.

1592
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:49,790
Alright.

1593
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,110
Alright, now...

1594
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,610
It's okay.

1595
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,710
They're moral support.

1596
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,350
It's okay.

1597
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:57,770
We have the moral support.

1598
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,530
My moral support crew.

1599
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,990
Where the fuck is the exit?

1600
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,690
I'm lost already.

1601
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,010
I'm already lost.

1602
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,270
Do I have time to go home and pee?

1603
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:15,530
What the fuck?

1604
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:16,410
No!

1605
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,210
You're not paid to pee!

1606
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,330
Number two!

1607
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,530
Number two!

1608
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,090
Where do I...

1609
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:25,410
It's like Codename Kid's next door.

1610
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,490
Where do we go, number two?

1611
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,710
Where do we go?

1612
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,250
Not... Is it really... There's no way it's this way.

1613
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:35,330
Come on, my very real dragoon.

1614
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,890
Where the fuck do we go?

1615
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:41,470
Weeeeee!

1616
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:43,730
We... Oh shit, there's like...

1617
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:46,550
Oh shit, wait, there's crosshairs that tell us where to go.

1618
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,590
You're so smart.

1619
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:50,410
Alright, what can we upgrade?

1620
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,190
Let us upgrade.

1621
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,510
Fully charged costs five health?

1622
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:58,610
Yeah, no.

1623
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:03,630
Damaging and bleeding enemies makes you 38% more pissed off.

1624
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,210
The staff now fires.

1625
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:06,150
Three orbs.

1626
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:06,330
Ooooooh!

1627
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,870
This is really more of an action game than a thinking game.

1628
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:08,970
Okay, we actually know.

1629
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,670
It's like reduce 66% damage.

1630
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:14,110
I'd rather just get this and upgrade.

1631
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,090
I'm gonna upgrade this.

1632
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,410
You got it, Bob.

1633
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:16,730
Alright.

1634
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:20,510
Damaging and bleeding enemies makes you 50% more pissed off.

1635
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:21,350
Let's go.

1636
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:24,750
I wanna be more angry.

1637
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,090
What did we get?

1638
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:30,930
Pool expanded?

1639
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:32,030
Nice!

1640
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,170
We got more of the pool!

1641
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,930
We gotta get the gas!

1642
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:36,570
There's a cannon.

1643
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:38,650
Now you can break that block of ice with a cannonball.

1644
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:40,450
Oh, wait!

1645
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,990
Oh, that's how you break the fucking ice block!

1646
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:44,430
Oh!

1647
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,050
Okay.

1648
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,710
Wait, where's the bowling ball?

1649
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:52,750
Let me grab some toilet paper real fast.

1650
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:59,610
I can't believe these people will throw away good toilet paper in the fucking trash can!

1651
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,330
They're the new currency!

1652
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:02,570
That's a pretty sweet card.

1653
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:03,090
Don't fuck it up.

1654
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:04,790
Gnome gaming.

1655
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,570
You always get gnomed.

1656
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,170
Alright, we have to throw this here?

1657
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,510
Search how I throw the bowling ball.

1658
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,210
Like, do I throw the bowling ball like...

1659
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:19,310
No!

1660
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,570
My very real trap!

1661
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:22,230
No, it's...

1662
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,530
He's like in the tunnel!

1663
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,910
He's in a tunnel, chat!

1664
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,470
Guys, he didn't leave!

1665
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:32,130
It's the internet!

1666
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,150
Grab my...

1667
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,730
They didn't leave, it was just the internet!

1668
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:38,130
Chat...

1669
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,350
It was just the internet.

1670
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,770
It's the internet!

1671
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,350
Where the fuck do I drop the bowling ball?

1672
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,910
There's a cannon?

1673
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,250
Where is the cannon?

1674
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,470
There's a cannon?!

1675
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:01,190
There was a cannon here all along?!

1676
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,170
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

1677
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,090
Thank you, thank you.

1678
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,470
God damn it.

1679
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:08,910
It's okay.

1680
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:12,570
I know your internet caused you to disconnect.

1681
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:13,910
It's okay.

1682
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,210
You have plenty of time to rejoin me.

1683
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,110
My very real dragoon.

1684
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:21,130
Alright.

1685
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:21,550
Oh!

1686
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:23,370
That's the cannonball!

1687
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:26,470
Alright, let's pick it up and put it in.

1688
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:27,730
Oh yeah.

1689
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,650
Oh god, I actually have to walk up the stairs.

1690
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:32,970
I can't believe it.

1691
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:33,730
It's like I'm a child.

1692
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,170
It's like I'm a child.

1693
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:41,670
I can't believe I actually have to walk up and can't even jump.

1694
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,110
Alright, load.

1695
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:44,850
What the fuck do I shoot?

1696
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:45,230
This?

1697
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:48,070
Oh!

1698
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,250
That's what I shoot!

1699
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:50,990
Okay.

1700
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:51,990
And then...

1701
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:53,950
Grab some more.

1702
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,630
Oh, we can have another cannonball.

1703
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,090
There was a cannonball right there.

1704
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:57,710
I did not have to kill it.

1705
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:58,370
I didn't have to walk this far.

1706
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:00,770
Yay!

1707
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,610
For me?

1708
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:03,810
It's my birthday.

1709
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:04,850
Do you guys know that?

1710
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:06,790
Because every day is my birthday.

1711
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:08,110
Yay!

1712
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:11,250
Nice!

1713
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,450
The one I've always wanted!

1714
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,170
Toilet paper!

1715
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,390
Alex, thank you for the super chat.

1716
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:17,970
Thank you.

1717
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,030
What is this?

1718
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:23,590
Overlook point.

1719
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,140
What the fuck is that over there?

1720
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,560
What is that over there?

1721
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,240
Alright.

1722
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,580
Here we go.

1723
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,400
Oh, I got more dark matter.

1724
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:42,080
Is this lady okay?

1725
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:45,400
I posted my broken leg on social media and it got so many likes!

1726
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,040
Bro, what the fuck?

1727
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,320
Oh no, she's an influencer.

1728
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,600
We don't go near those people.

1729
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,060
Jimmy, look away.

1730
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,300
That's an influencer.

1731
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,520
Don't go near them.

1732
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,700
Alright, she's fine.

1733
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,580
She's just influencing.

1734
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,680
Grab the gas can, you kid.

1735
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,220
It's right there.

1736
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,340
Alright, I'm gonna grab it.

1737
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:06,980
Well, you're fucked.

1738
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,600
Oh, no!

1739
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:08,100
No!

1740
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:08,980
It was a trap!

1741
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,420
Who would have thought?

1742
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,800
It was a trap all along!

1743
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,480
I can't believe it.

1744
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,880
How could we have known that?

1745
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,900
How could we have known that it was a trap?

1746
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:28,780
It was a trap!

1747
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:28,780
Okay.

1748
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,440
Nice.

1749
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,500
We're okay.

1750
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,300
No, no!

1751
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,980
Please not be reanimated.

1752
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:35,320
No!

1753
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:38,980
No!

1754
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,920
Times 11!

1755
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,440
Oh, it's okay.

1756
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,700
My very real dragoons, go and do your thing!

1757
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,420
You'll be fine!

1758
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,340
You'll be okay!

1759
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,320
I'll go deal with the archers!

1760
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:58,100
Alright.

1761
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,240
I think matchmaking is only the location lock.

1762
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,260
Wait, is it really?

1763
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,700
Oh my god.

1764
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,180
That's funny.

1765
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:14,440
You gotta be Canadian to play with me, I guess.

1766
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,340
Except for my very real American dragoons.

1767
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,260
I got an exception.

1768
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,120
I got an exception.

1769
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,500
Those are...

1770
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,120
Except for the very real American dragoons.

1771
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,740
Those are actual Americans.

1772
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,260
Those are... those are actual!

1773
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,680
You know I got knocked out.

1774
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,240
Get up close to him to help him escape.

1775
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:37,480
It's okay.

1776
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,880
We gotta...

1777
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,280
Good job, keep each other safe out there.

1778
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,380
Don't worry, we're fine.

1779
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,040
We're so fine.

1780
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,720
Teammate down?

1781
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,460
That's okay!

1782
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,700
My other dragoons can save him!

1783
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:49,640
Oh god.

1784
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,400
I need a healer!

1785
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:50,640
Oh, yeah!

1786
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,140
Woah!

1787
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:51,880
Oh!

1788
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,820
Save me!

1789
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:55,680
Save me!

1790
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,400
Okay.

1791
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:58,640
It's fine.

1792
01:08:59,360 --> 01:08:59,960
It's fine.

1793
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,340
We're fine.

1794
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:00,680
We're fine.

1795
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,760
I told you hard difficulty is nothing.

1796
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,700
It's fine.

1797
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,320
Revive them!

1798
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:06,360
Oh, wait.

1799
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,280
I'm already getting healed.

1800
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:07,780
That's fine.

1801
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:11,240
It's okay.

1802
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,960
Then you guys can play with all the other dragoons.

1803
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:14,960
Alright.

1804
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,900
Where's my teammates?

1805
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,160
Oh, he's over there.

1806
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:17,440
Ow!

1807
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:18,300
No!

1808
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,240
You got me!

1809
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,260
Alright.

1810
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:20,820
There you go.

1811
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,240
We're fine.

1812
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,500
I couldn't block it!

1813
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:23,880
Yay!

1814
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,760
Look at all this beautiful toilet paper!

1815
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:28,880
Yay!

1816
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,360
Woah!

1817
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,180
They're in the tunnel again.

1818
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,860
I just love how every time...

1819
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:42,900
Every time the fight is over...

1820
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,900
What a coincidence!

1821
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,920
They're in the tunnel again.

1822
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:47,580
Guys.

1823
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,700
What a fucking coincidence.

1824
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:52,580
Woah!

1825
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,820
Oh my god!

1826
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:58,600
How the fuck do you already so...

1827
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,340
What the fuck?

1828
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,320
You have a shield?

1829
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,420
This man played a game before I played a game.

1830
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,600
Okay.

1831
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,260
What do I have?

1832
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:10,780
Uncommon.

1833
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,440
It shoots to...

1834
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,560
You know I'm a reshuffle.

1835
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,760
I don't like these cards.

1836
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:18,660
Uncommon.

1837
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:19,860
Enemies drop... Oh!

1838
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:20,380
Money!

1839
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:21,220
Yes!

1840
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,520
Can I promote it?

1841
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,600
Yeah, I'm gonna promote it.

1842
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:24,940
I'm gonna bribe him.

1843
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,120
Now 90% more toilet paper?

1844
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,380
That's so much more toilet paper.

1845
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,960
Uh, do I still... Thank you for the super chat.

1846
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:33,300
Thank you.

1847
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:33,840
Thank you!

1848
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:34,980
Um...

1849
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,280
I need about 350.

1850
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:38,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1851
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:39,300
Thank you.

1852
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:39,980
Thank you.

1853
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,220
Alright.

1854
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:41,640
I'm ready.

1855
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,020
I'm ready to travel.

1856
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,500
Where are we?

1857
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,460
Oh, we're back!

1858
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,640
You won't leave me like the other Dragoon, right?

1859
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:55,660
Wait, wait.

1860
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,340
Before we do that, we have to...

1861
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,520
Wait, there's a chest!

1862
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,700
I bowling balled the chest!

1863
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,540
Give me a sec.

1864
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,700
Here we go.

1865
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,460
Oh my god!

1866
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,840
Look at all this toilet paper!

1867
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:09,860
Alright.

1868
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,440
I got everything we need.

1869
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,960
We need to...

1870
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,660
Put the gas in the can.

1871
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,020
Wait, did you already do it?

1872
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,860
Did you already do it, Dragoon?

1873
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,160
Oh no.

1874
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,140
I have to deliver it.

1875
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,900
Where do I start it?

1876
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,280
Oh, I start the truck.

1877
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:26,860
It's okay.

1878
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:27,340
I have a license.

1879
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,540
I got it when I was 7.

1880
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:31,500
Nice.

1881
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,520
What the fuck?

1882
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,900
I thought he was like in the water.

1883
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,480
Where's Randy?

1884
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,700
Are you okay, Randy?

1885
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,660
I used to meet you.

1886
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:44,120
I did it.

1887
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,080
Under my guidance and sage-like wisdom.

1888
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,160
Oh, thank god.

1889
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:47,920
You did it.

1890
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:48,800
You saved me.

1891
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,320
I've been trapped in here all day.

1892
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,120
I would have gotten out, but there's a level 3 elven lock on that door over there.

1893
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:54,740
What?

1894
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,620
I'm so happy.

1895
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,680
I found this chest full of toilet paper.

1896
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,940
Everyone in town is hoarding this stuff.

1897
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,820
Especially that damn Stotch.

1898
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,340
It's worth more than money.

1899
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:04,980
I'm rich.

1900
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,300
I'm richer than Stotch.

1901
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,320
You can't.

1902
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,460
Let's find out where Kyle's hiding.

1903
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,520
Uh, yeah.

1904
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,080
Kyle.

1905
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:10,500
Yeah.

1906
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,160
I can show you where he is.

1907
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,100
But, uh...

1908
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:13,520
Oh, man.

1909
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,580
I've been stuck here so long.

1910
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:15,820
I really gotta go take a shit.

1911
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:20,220
Just, uh, look within yourself and you'll find all the answers you need.

1912
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:20,520
You know?

1913
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,220
Believe in yourself and all that stuff.

1914
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:22,860
It'll be revealed.

1915
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,860
I'm gonna go take a shit and rub this toilet paper in that fucking Stotch's face.

1916
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:28,500
What?

1917
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,220
This is the end for you.

1918
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,800
They fucking locked us in!

1919
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:32,800
Downstage an ambush.

1920
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,060
Make them regret it, new kid.

1921
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,860
They're taking the high ground, dumbass.

1922
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,200
Just jump over it!

1923
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,420
I can fucking find my way out of it!

1924
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,420
I don't understand!

1925
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,580
What's the point of having the fucking chosen power?

1926
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,320
Like, holy shit.

1927
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,260
It's like the...

1928
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,520
The end's arrived.

1929
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,940
It's like... It's like Mr. Adult Man right there.

1930
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,060
Fucking heading to the movie theater.

1931
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,040
Holy shit.

1932
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,360
What the fuck?

1933
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,260
Not the... Not the end!

1934
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:04,960
No!

1935
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:07,720
Okay.

1936
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:08,580
Yeah.

1937
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,540
Here we go.

1938
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:15,680
We don't need health.

1939
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,300
We're gonna live forever.

1940
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,940
It was at this moment.

1941
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,840
Don't you rea- What the fuck?!

1942
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,120
Holy shit!

1943
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,260
I almost got fucked up there!

1944
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,740
Bros, you- don't mess with trees.

1945
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,240
They give us tree powers.

1946
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,260
They give us toilet paper.

1947
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,280
Don't mess with the trees.

1948
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:36,560
Okay.

1949
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,640
We have healers though.

1950
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,100
We're good.

1951
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:39,880
Oh my god!

1952
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,360
You got magic w- Bro!

1953
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,040
He's actually dead!

1954
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,080
Wait!

1955
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,120
Oh no.

1956
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,220
That's just his makeup.

1957
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:47,660
Okay.

1958
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,780
I thought you burned him into a skull or some shit.

1959
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,000
I was like, oh my god.

1960
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,820
That was gonna be hardcore.

1961
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,300
Hi!

1962
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,040
They so- No!

1963
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1964
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:58,880
They're so strong!

1965
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,860
They're so strong!

1966
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:00,660
Oh no!

1967
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,380
Heal me!

1968
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,580
The chosen one!

1969
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:03,600
Number one!

1970
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,220
It's okay.

1971
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:07,920
I'm getting healed.

1972
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,240
You guys do all the work.

1973
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,740
I'm gonna get healed right now.

1974
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:15,240
I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm gonna stay there.

1975
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:17,420
Alright.

1976
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,140
It's fine.

1977
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,380
Yeah, I don't care about this UFO cause it's canon!

1978
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:22,800
Ow!

1979
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,220
Alright.

1980
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,740
We gotta get rid of the fucking arrows.

1981
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:28,940
Oh fudge!

1982
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:30,700
Alright.

1983
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,460
Here we go.

1984
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,780
This is it.

1985
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,580
That's fucking right.

1986
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,140
You can't fucking fuck me up this time.

1987
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,760
I can dodge!

1988
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:40,580
Another wave from the UFO!

1989
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,140
What's the supersize?

1990
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:46,600
What's the supersize?

1991
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:46,720
Oh!

1992
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,180
He big!

1993
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:49,960
Okay.

01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,100
I'm just gonna- Yeah, I'm just gonna start using my- Oh!

1995
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,760
What the fuck?!

1996
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:58,660
Why is this paladin so fucking strong?!

1997
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,780
The power of the elf gods!

1998
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:02,700
Bro!

1999
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,560
I'm like so fucking- Did he like one-shots me?

2000
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,240
Oh no.

2001
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:13,360
I need to- I need to stay with the- I need to stay within this range.

2002
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:14,000
It's okay.

2003
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:17,060
My dragoons is gonna do stuff.

2004
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,020
I'll just go fucking right click.

2005
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,940
I'll just don't get involved.

2006
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,960
I don't- I won't get involved anymore.

2007
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,420
Oh no.

2008
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,000
The trees.

2009
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,380
The trees are coming.

2010
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:30,680
It's alright.

2011
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,440
I have fire- fire power.

2012
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:34,560
I have my flower power right here.

2013
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,820
Man, that level 3 elven lock really locks you in.

2014
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,480
Glad to be thinking with a super chat.

2015
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:40,900
Thank you.

2016
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,460
Thank you.

2017
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:42,600
Alright.

2018
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:45,780
I just need to figure out my aim here though.

2019
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:46,980
Oh my god.

2020
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,680
What is the drop off- No!

2021
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,600
Not the trees!

2022
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,260
Get me away from the trees!

2023
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,840
Get me away from the trees!

2024
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,860
Not the trees!

2025
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,540
Oh wait!

2026
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,120
He's still alive!

2027
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:02,580
Look!

2028
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,900
Him and the cow is still alive!

2029
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:06,800
Wait.

2030
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:07,300
Where is he?

2031
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,960
Oh my god.

2032
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,060
Oh my god.

2033
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:10,680
They got him.

2034
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,160
They got one of him.

2035
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,960
Mr. Adult Man.

2036
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:16,480
It's okay.

2037
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,580
We can solo him.

2038
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:19,880
Pew!

2039
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:22,360
We can solo him.

2040
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,320
Trust me.

2041
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,880
As long as he doesn't touch me, we're fine.

2042
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,240
Pew!

2043
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:27,920
Pew!

2044
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:28,700
Pew!

2045
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,480
Pew!

2046
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,260
Wait!

2047
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:30,960
You de- Oh!

2048
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:31,320
I'm dead!

2049
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:31,800
Warlord!

2050
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,000
Wait!

2051
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,120
You're dead!

2052
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:34,900
Oh no!

2053
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,400
I'm floating!

2054
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,320
I'm floating!

2055
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:37,280
Don't float!

2056
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:37,860
Stop!

2057
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,200
I'm so- No!

2058
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,280
Are you following me?

2059
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,040
Just get fucked up.

2060
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:42,860
No!

2061
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,940
Where's our NPCs?

2062
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:48,340
It's okay.

2063
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:49,820
It's okay.

2064
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,580
I'm hiding down here.

2065
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,020
We're fine.

2066
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,680
We'll be fine.

2067
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,220
Just revive us in here.

2068
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,020
They don't know!

2069
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:57,920
No!

2070
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,520
NPC!

2071
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,020
NPC!

2072
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:03,420
Yes!

2073
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,720
Revive us in here!

2074
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,400
I mean!

2075
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,340
I mean!

2076
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,600
Real person!

2077
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,180
Real person!

2078
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,400
Real goon!

2079
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,760
I'm back.

2080
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,300
I knew I was back.

2081
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,540
I mean the real goon, guys.

2082
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,600
I meant the real- Oh my fucking god!

2083
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,700
Why is everybody so strong?

2084
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,600
It's okay.

2085
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:31,760
It's okay.

2086
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,860
It's cause he was playing so bad that I called him an NPC chat.

2087
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,420
That's why I called him NPC!

2088
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,540
Cause he was playing so fucking shit.

2089
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,500
Like you don't understand.

2090
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,400
I can't believe it.

2091
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,800
Hard was actually hard.

2092
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:00,240
Who would have thought- Who would have thought hard was really hard, guys?

2093
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,260
Jesus Christ.

2094
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,020
I need to- I'm gonna call for bullshit.

2095
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,580
It's bullshit time.

2096
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,260
It's bullshit time!

2097
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,320
Oh god, I need to heal myself.

2098
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,460
I need to heal myself.

2099
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,660
Jesus Christ.

2100
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,900
Get over here.

2101
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,680
Get over here.

2102
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,580
Where the fuck are you?

2103
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,760
We did it!

2104
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,100
Oh my god, we did it.

2105
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,660
Who would have thought?

2106
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,560
We survived.

2107
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,240
Don't worry, I can unscathed.

2108
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,560
I should pick this level 3 pick.

2109
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,580
Jimmy, what are you doing?

2110
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,680
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

2111
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:45,560
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

2112
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,360
You could have unlocked this door this whole time.

2113
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,780
The staff orb bounces twice.

2114
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,240
Impact doing...

2115
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,620
Oh wait, I like that.

2116
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,500
It does a double bounce.

2117
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,060
Bye.

2118
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,360
No, no, no, no, no.

2119
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,360
I need to grab this.

2120
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,720
Toilet paper.

2121
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,720
And then we just drop...

2122
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,220
A hideout!

2123
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,320
100% more toilet paper?

2124
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,280
I'll be here all week.

2125
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,560
Or at least until school reopens.

2126
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,800
That's like 100% more money!

2127
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:17,580
That's like 100% more money!

2128
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,540
You don't get it.

2129
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:19,260
They are a rule.

2130
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,000
The elves do unspeakable things to trees to gain their dark powers.

2131
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:22,640
The elves do unspeakable things to trees to gain their dark powers.

2132
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,220
Holy shit, these trees.

2133
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,080
These trees, man.

2134
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,480
Oh my god, it's the elf king.

2135
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,140
It's Kyle.

2136
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,720
That fucking elf.

2137
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:38,520
You see...

2138
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,140
You're not a real king.

2139
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:44,680
A real king will stand behind the lines and then make everybody else do all the work for him.

2140
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:45,720
Just like Cartman.

2141
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:46,900
That's why he's a real king.

2142
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:52,700
Oh shit, okay.

2143
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:53,560
That was on me.

2144
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,080
Holy fuck.

2145
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,580
How do I get to you?

2146
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,060
Guys, it took me 20 years, but I got to him finally.

2147
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:09,760
It took me a while.

2148
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:17,800
A real king will stand behind enemy lines and make other people do the dirty work for us.

2149
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,040
That's why Cartman is my real king.

2150
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,660
Right here.

2151
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,500
Jesus Christ, this is...

2152
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,960
Why is this boss fight so hard?

2153
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,840
Holy shit.

2154
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,040
I'm so sorry.

2155
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,920
Why is it so...

2156
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,600
I can barely get to this fucker.

2157
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,040
I can barely get to this fucker.

2158
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,560
Oh my god.

2159
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,640
I can't believe it.

2160
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,560
Hard mode is actually hard mode.

2161
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:53,820
The moment I get to him, he's already like traveled 20 meters away from me.

2162
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:54,360
The moment I get to him, he's already like traveled 20 meters away from me.

2163
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:54,880
Where did he go?

2164
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,240
Where did he go?

2165
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,480
Where the fuck did he go?

2166
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:03,980
I'm just gonna predict.

2167
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,340
I'm gonna do some fucking prediction shit.

2168
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:08,200
Okay, he's gonna...

2169
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,100
Oh, he's not moving.

2170
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,580
Okay, where is he gonna move?

2171
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:12,900
Oh, he's over there.

2172
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,140
I fucking knew it.

2173
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,020
I knew you were gonna be over there.

2174
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,460
Are you serious?

2175
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,640
Where did you go?

2176
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:23,740
It's okay.

2177
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,440
No, it's not.

2178
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,680
Why am I here?

2179
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,460
It's okay.

2180
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,220
He has to go here.

2181
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,080
No, he's not.

2182
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:31,880
He's over there.

2183
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,720
He's over here.

2184
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,680
Oh my god.

2185
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:38,100
I'm fucking activating bullshit.

2186
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,880
I don't have bullshit.

2187
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:40,880
No!

2188
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:41,980
Where did he go?

2189
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,800
Where did he go?

2190
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:45,940
Kyle, please!

2191
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:49,420
Let me at least fucking hit you one time.

2192
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,840
I don't care.

2193
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,500
Alright, here we go.

2194
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,180
Oh no.

2195
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:57,340
Okay.

2196
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,380
I need heal.

2197
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,640
I need heal.

2198
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,120
Please.

2199
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:04,940
That's illegal!

2200
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,860
This is illegal!

2201
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,260
My fucking snack time!

2202
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,860
You don't hit a person when it's snack time!

2203
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,240
Those are kindergarten rules.

2204
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,920
You never hit somebody during snack hours.

2205
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,400
Where did he go?

2206
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:21,960
Where the fuck?

2207
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:22,780
Okay, there he is.

2208
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,160
Yoooooo!

2209
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:26,380
Alright.

2210
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,020
No!

2211
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,940
Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

2212
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:33,560
Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

2213
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,640
It's so dishonorable!

2214
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:36,860
Okay.

2215
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:37,860
Oh no.

2216
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:38,860
Oh no.

2217
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:39,360
Here we go.

2218
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,280
We're okay.

2219
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,580
We're okay.

2220
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,260
It's still snack time hours.

2221
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:44,980
Okay.

2222
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:47,820
Nice.

2223
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,120
We got him.

2224
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,120
He's running!

2225
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,460
He's a coward!

2226
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:53,860
He's so scared!

2227
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:54,980
Oh, I'm so scared.

2228
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,020
Snack time!

2229
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:57,680
Snack time!

2230
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,040
He can't teleport anymore!

2231
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:00,920
He's scared!

2232
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,240
He can't teleport!

2233
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,380
He can't teleport!

2234
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,120
We can do this!

2235
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,960
He lost all his powers!

2236
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,900
Go after him!

2237
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,820
Oh, he teleported, chat.

2238
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,060
Who would've thought he teleported?

2239
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:16,660
Who would've thought?

2240
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:18,140
Oh my god, he's one bar.

2241
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:18,620
He's one bar.

2242
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,120
This is it.

2243
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:21,800
This is it.

2244
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:22,980
Woooo!

2245
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,560
Oh my god, please.

2246
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,400
Please get closer.

2247
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:29,760
Please!

2248
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,900
Please, he's one hit!

2249
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:34,500
He's so close to dying!

2250
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:36,900
Oh, why did I dive into that?

2251
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,460
I'm just gonna use my staff.

2252
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,660
Where did he go?

2253
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:43,060
Where did he go?

2254
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:44,520
No!

2255
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:46,840
He's got this.

2256
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,420
I got this!

2257
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,000
I've got him!

2258
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:49,420
Yes!

2259
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:52,100
Easy.

2260
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,840
So fucking easy.

2261
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:56,960
Yes!

2262
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:57,720
Yes, I did it!

2263
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,720
You know what, Kyle?

2264
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,640
I learned something today.

2265
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:03,920
You're a little bitch.

2266
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:05,220
Fuck you, Carmel.

2267
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,060
Yay!

2268
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,300
We did it!

2269
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:12,380
We killed Kyle!

2270
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:14,060
Yay!

2271
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:15,620
When are we gonna meet Kenny?

2272
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,480
When are we gonna meet Princess Kenny?

2273
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:18,940
There's a chest!

2274
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:19,360
There's a chest!

2275
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,020
Okay.

2276
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:21,600
Snack break.

2277
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,300
I'm gonna open this chest first.

2278
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:25,700
Snack break.

2279
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,640
We have a little snack break!

2280
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:32,420
Snack break!

2281
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:32,800
Alright.

2282
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,800
Is there like any more loot that we're missing?

2283
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,180
Is there any more loot?

2284
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,240
I think we're fine.

2285
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,140
Alright, I'm coming over!

2286
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,120
No!

2287
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,200
No!

2288
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,060
Yay!

2289
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,660
We did it.

2290
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,260
I knew we were gamers.

2291
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,340
I knew we were gamers.

2292
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:58,980
Look at that.

2293
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:02,300
Look at all these fucking achievements we made.

2294
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:02,840
Together.

2295
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:04,680
Dragons.

2296
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:06,660
Proceed.

2297
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,460
What the fuck does...

2298
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,660
Oh, dark matter.

2299
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,320
I got the most damage done.

2300
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:15,800
Look at that.

2301
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,280
I had the most DPS.

2302
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:23,690
Is it lore time?

2303
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,220
Those are the rules, right, your honor?

2304
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,680
Those are the rules, yes.

2305
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,440
You didn't beat me, fat ass.

2306
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,320
The new kid did.

2307
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,480
And who are those other three kids they were playing with?

2308
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,500
Oh, those were the other new kids.

2309
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:48,840
Yeah.

2310
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,840
They all think they're the actual new kid, but...

2311
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,760
Yeah, I'm the one that matters.

2312
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:52,380
I'm number one.

2313
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,580
That's why I'm always the host.

2314
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,120
Honestly, those other new kids are all throwing corners at me.

2315
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,360
You're all just minor copies of me.

2316
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,680
Why did you attack my fucking base?

2317
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,220
Attack your base?

2318
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:02,640
Ha!

2319
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:03,480
Ha!

2320
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:07,360
Are you denying that you were gearing up your entire army to attack our fucking base?

2321
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:07,860
Yeah!

2322
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:09,720
Says who?

2323
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,960
Says Clyde!

2324
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:11,320
Yeah!

2325
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,880
And do you always trust what Clyde says?

2326
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,400
Yeah, because he's not an elf!

2327
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:16,240
Yeah!

2328
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:17,840
God damn it, you guys!

2329
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,680
We are gearing up to attack someone else!

2330
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:22,360
Someone who I think is a real, actual threat to our town!

2331
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,180
What?

2332
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,600
Worse than elves?

2333
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,900
And gingers?

2334
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,640
A snowstorm this big?

2335
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:28,700
In one weekend?

2336
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,440
Have you ever seen anything like it?

2337
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,020
What are you suggesting, elf?

2338
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,520
It isn't natural.

2339
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,100
I think that someone has cast a level 10 endless winter spell.

2340
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,480
That kind of magic has been outlawed ever since I was a kid.

2341
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,920
Since the new kid ruined the last game by farting backwards in time!

2342
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,100
Yeah, well it's been done.

2343
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:43,620
I know it.

2344
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,320
What?

2345
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,920
Who would do such a thing?

2346
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,460
The same person who's been acting strange for the past week.

2347
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:50,260
Stan.

2348
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,800
Stan has been acting strange ever since he thought his version of the rules were best.

2349
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,880
Where is Stan?

2350
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,080
Must be ManBearPig.

2351
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,300
But then the new kid came and got in the way.

2352
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,140
Wow, nice going, new kid.

2353
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:03,700
What?

2354
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,760
What the fuck did I do?

2355
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,300
It's been no fun and games for you guys, but this storm isn't going to end.

2356
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,840
And our town is in serious trouble.

2357
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:10,960
Oh, jeez.

2358
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:12,300
Then we have no choice.

2359
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,000
New kid, we must get to the marsh walker, Stan.

2360
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,920
And find out what he's been hiding.

2361
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,480
Stan's gonna be evil?

2362
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,300
You're loaded with dark matter.

2363
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,060
Oh my god.

2364
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,040
Integrity Farms fucked him up, man.

2365
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:28,420
Alright, it's time to go to the lobby.

2366
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,940
Oh my god, now he's part of my team.

2367
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,780
Looks like your mystical powers have grown.

2368
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:33,440
About time.

2369
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:34,100
Go to Tolkien.

2370
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,020
Let him guide you.

2371
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,400
Oh, I got new powers.

2372
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,800
Where are my new powers?

2373
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,620
Now that your powers have grown, let's take a closer look.

2374
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,160
Alright.

2375
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,660
Select the powers tab.

2376
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,980
Oh, I can have like new powers now.

2377
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,620
I don't have to heal you guys anymore.

2378
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:50,720
I don't have to heal you guys anymore.

2379
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,600
Uh...

2380
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,080
Fast yourself...

2381
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:53,760
Okay.

2382
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:56,920
I'm gonna...

2383
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,080
Actually...

2384
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:02,000
I feel like I'm gonna have to shield.

2385
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:03,620
What the fuck is the cat?

2386
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:05,520
Okay.

2387
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:06,600
Okay.

2388
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:09,720
Alright.

2389
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,560
Alright, what kind of...

2390
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:11,860
Ooh.

2391
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:14,700
Wild areas and flames.

2392
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:15,360
Oh my god!

2393
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,000
This is the one that you have!

2394
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,380
My real dragoon!

2395
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,260
It's like a flamethrower!

2396
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:25,360
Actually, I don't know.

2397
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:27,060
I'm gonna try this.

2398
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,640
I'm gonna try a flamethrower.

2399
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,840
That seems really cool.

2400
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,740
Create a shield.

2401
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,220
Alright.

2402
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:33,700
Nice.

2403
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,560
I have a shield now.

2404
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:35,840
Alright.

2405
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:36,480

2406
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:40,840

2407
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,220
Guys, I know you guys so wanna play.

2408
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,020
Dragoons, one at a time!

2409
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:46,840
Dragoons!

2410
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,500
One at a time in this very public lobby!

2411
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,220
One at a time in this very public lobby!

2412
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,000
Whoa!

2416
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:00,240
Okay.

2417
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,560
I have 60 PP.

2418
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:03,880
Okay.

2419
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:04,680
But like...

2420
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,640
I don't know, but like...

2421
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,560
I need people to know I paid the extra $20.

2422
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:12,540
I need people to know I paid the extra $20.

2423
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:12,700
Like...

2424
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,380
I need people to know that.

2425
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,100
I need people to know that.

2426
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,000
Ooh, I could be like...

2427
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:22,920
I can have a tiny crown.

2428
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,620
No, but I want people to get gnomed.

2429
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,080
Alright, let's see.

2430
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,360
I could... wait, what is this?

2431
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,240
Is that the capes and stuff?

2432
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,960
Oh, the emotes!

2433
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,800
Wait, how do I even use emotes?

2434
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,200
Just buy what speaks to you.

2435
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,060
Wait, what is this?

2436
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,000
How do I see...

2437
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,100
Okay, let's see.

2438
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:41,780
Oh, Swifting!

2439
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,320
What the fuck is Swifting?

2440
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:53,200
Purchase Gola, Tantrum, Twinkle Toes, Spin, Peanut Butters, Tap Dance...

2441
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,820
Uh... I'm gonna buy...

2442
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,620
I'm gonna buy Swif... I'm gonna buy Swifting.

2443
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,840
I wanna know what Swifting is.

2444
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:02,440
Alright.

2445
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,400
How do I use my emotes, guys?

2446
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,900
How do I...

2447
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,300
How do I use...

2448
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,440
You guys know how to use the emotes in this game?

2449
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:15,880
You guys know how to use the emotes in this game?

2450
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,940
Is it T?

2451
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:19,220
Is that Fortnite?

2452
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,040
B?

2453
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,680
How the fuck do I use the emotes?

2454
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,020
Okay, we're gonna have to...

2455
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:28,680
Remap controls.

2456
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:29,420
Okay.

2457
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:30,720
Use bullshit.

2458
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:32,420
What the fuck is... who... who...

2459
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,140
Oh, Emo Wheel Z!

2460
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,000
Okay.

2461
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:37,300
What the fuck is Toot... oh.

2462
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,700
Okay, I found the Toot button.

2463
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:40,980
Yeah!

2464
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,140
Got $20!

2465
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,360
Guys.

2466
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:47,300
I figured...

2467
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,520
I figured... guys.

2468
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,200
I figured out what Toot was.

2469
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,100
Woo!

2470
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,020
Okay, wait.

2471
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:54,360
What's this?

2472
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,600
Oh, I can be Snoopy.

2473
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,880
And then...

2474
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,100
Look at me go.

2475
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,000
I'm so fucking happy.

2476
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,160
Toot toot toot to live.

2477
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:06,880
Alright, let's see.

2478
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:07,620
What do we upgrade?

2479
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,160
I feel like we need more HP.

2480
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,700
And then... you can get 20% more pissed off.

2481
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:13,480
Nice!

2482
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,080
Nice!

2483
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:15,800
I have issues!

2484
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,220
Let's go!

2485
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,300
Let's go!

2486
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:22,820
Never seek help.

2487
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,640
Let's continue having problems.

2488
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:25,840
Alright.

2489
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:26,940
Hey guys!

2490
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,120
Like I said.

2491
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,540
One at a time!

2492
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:32,620
Matchmaking is open everybody!

2493
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,260
Matchmaking is open everybody!

2494
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:36,760
Alright.

2495
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,160
Alright.

2496
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,400
Oh, this is like all the cards that I currently have.

2497
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:41,620
Like I said everybody!

2498
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,920
One at a time!

2499
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,860
One at a time!

2500
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:51,460
I know there's so many people that wanna join us!

2501
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:52,900
I know there's so many people that wanna join us!

2502
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,020
Slow down dragons!

2503
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,780
Slow down!

2504
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:55,840
Slow down!

2505
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:56,040
Slow down!

2506
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:00,940
Alright, here we go.

2507
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,100
I'm ready.

2508
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,200
Get over here, Death Warlock!

2509
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,220
Get over here!

2510
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,740
Get over here!

2511
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:13,860
Fine!

2512
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:15,820
We'll have it on hard!

2513
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,600
Time to set a battle plan.

2514
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:19,060
Alright, start the run.

2515
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,840
Alright, I'm ready.

2516
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:22,980
Get over here.

2517
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,480
Death Warlock!

2518
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,420
Get over here!

2519
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:28,140
Get over here!

2520
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,620
I can't start the mission!

2521
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:37,580
So you're stuck waiting because of one inconsiderate asshole.

2522
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,280
Yeah!

2523
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,140
Guys!

2524
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,240
One at a time guys!

2525
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:45,680
One at a time guys!

2526
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:50,820
What the fuck?

2527
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,080
Oh my god.

2528
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,540
Where the fuck is this guy?

2529
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,260
Where the fuck happened?

2530
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,260
He's creeping you!

2531
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,040
Bro!

2532
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,000
Where the fuck are you?

2533
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:03,780
Bro!

2534
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:04,300
Move!

2535
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,540
Get out of the tunnel!

2536
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,760
Get out of the tunnel!

2537
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,120
Get out of the tunnel!

2538
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:15,380
Okay.

2539
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,940
Guys, Death Warlock is in the tunnel right now.

2540
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,600
Oh my god.

2541
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:21,920
Guys.

2542
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,520
Okay.

2543
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,060
I hate to die.

2544
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:24,380
I hate to do this.

2545
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,980
I hate to do this to you.

2546
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,440
I have to start my lobby.

2547
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,480
I need to start the lobby.

2548
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,980
You have to put him down.

2549
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,180
Don't look!

2550
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,740
I took him behind the barn.

2551
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,940
I had to take him outside.

2552
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,620
I had to take him behind the barn.

2553
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:58,000
Don't worry.

2554
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:58,960
He's gonna come back.

2555
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:00,580
I took him to the farm downstate.

2556
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:02,340
Alright.

2557
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,500
He's at the farm downstate right now.

2558
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,110
Alright, here we go.

2559
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:22,670
One at a time, Dragus.

2560
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,970
I know you're all stuck in that traffic jam.

2561
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:28,050
I know you're all in that tunnel chat.

2562
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:32,750
I know you're all in that fucking tunnel right now.

2563
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:36,510
But please, don't overload the servers chat.

2564
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:41,810
Don't overload the servers.

2565
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:44,050
I know it's so hard in demand.

2566
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:58,490
Where the fuck is it?

2567
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:01,170
Listen.

2568
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:04,450
Sen.

2569
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:12,710
We know you're not gonna win this because your fucking army are not even relevant characters in South Park.

2570
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,810
So go ahead and lay out your cards.

2571
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:33,930
Okay, I don't really have a lot of cards.

2572
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:35,530
Your bullshit rules aren't gonna save you, Cartman.

2573
01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:36,690
Soon we'll be playing by my rules.

2574
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,690
The wand casts chain lightning for...

2575
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:38,690
Oh!

2576
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:40,230
I got chain lightning!

2577
01:35:40,830 --> 01:35:42,050
I got chain lightning.

2578
01:35:42,430 --> 01:35:43,290
That's pretty OP.

2579
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:49,430
You become invisible and healed up while cloaked.

2580
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:57,750
Your entire team emits noxious fumes to grow so you can jump higher, run forever, and move faster.

2581
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:58,470
You become invisible and healed up while cloaked.

2582
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:58,470
Your entire team emits noxious fumes to grow so you can jump higher, run forever, and move faster.

2583
01:35:58,490 --> 01:35:59,610
Okay, that's a lie.

2584
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:00,690
Okay, that's a lie.

2585
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:01,910
Like... it runs out.

2586
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:03,770
Like... it runs out.

2587
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:03,830
Like... it runs out.

2588
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:09,990
If I can use it five times, it means I can't run forever.

2589
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:13,770
Like... what the fuck?

2590
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:16,630
It should be one use if I can run forever.

2591
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:23,070
Alright, let's see.

2592
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:24,130
I am...

2593
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:26,790
I think I'm gonna go with the... I'm gonna go with this one.

2594
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:28,470
I think I'm gonna go with the...

2595
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:28,470
I'm gonna go with this one.

2596
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:30,710
That should like... that should like hurt... all of us can hurt them.

2597
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:36,670
You can run forever five times.

2598
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:41,790
Cursed...

2599
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:45,870
Your melee weapons become useless?

2600
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:47,430
What the fuck?

2601
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:54,690
Three... four cards... five cards?!

2602
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:55,930
A plus ten axe?

2603
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:56,710
You can't do that!

2604
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:58,950
I can do it.

2605
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,490
I forged it by completing a quest.

2606
01:37:00,670 --> 01:37:01,610
It's totally legal.

2607
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:02,330
Ask Butters.

2608
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:04,590
Bro, he went to Home Depot!

2609
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:06,830
Damage grab?

2610
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:08,710
Is a plus ten axe legal?

2611
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:09,390
What?

2612
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:11,430
Kenny?

2613
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:15,370
Okay, who the fuck is... oh, no.

2614
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:17,390
That's like... that's not Kenny.

2615
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:21,270
So, we're still gonna beat the shit out of you.

2616
01:37:21,390 --> 01:37:23,550
Ask Kyle how my plus ten wizard balls taste.

2617
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:24,430
Because you're next.

2618
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:25,650
This is bullshit.

2619
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:25,890
Whatever.

2620
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:26,970
Still on the front line, Cartman.

2621
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:29,430
Fucking five cards.

2622
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:30,950
I'm on the front line, son of a bitch.

2623
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:32,550
Yes, five cards!

2624
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:36,350
Okay, so obviously I can't be on the front line, but I'll be in the back casting spells and doing wizard shit to keep you all safe.

2625
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,840
Where's my fifty million power?

2626
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:45,840
Alright.

2627
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:47,680
Where do I go?

2628
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,260
It's okay, guys.

2629
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,840
Don't worry.

2630
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:54,600
The Drago I kicked is definitely coming back.

2631
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,320
He still has one more hour left.

2632
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:58,840
I'm the leader of the game.

2633
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,720
Oh, I have like...

2634
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:05,120
It's hot.

2635
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,760
It's not like fire anymore.

2636
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:07,980
It's like electricity.

2637
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,000
Oh, I see.

2638
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:12,900
Wait, this is so OP.

2639
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:13,740
Look at this.

2640
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,960
This is actually so OP if I hit the shot.

2641
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:21,520
If I hit the shot, it's so OP, chat.

2642
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:22,060
I swear.

2643
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,280
If I hit it.

2644
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:24,820
There I go.

2645
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,040
I just electricity forever.

2646
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:29,480
I like...

2647
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:30,760
Okay, yeah.

2648
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,060
I just need to wait for the charge.

2649
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:33,940
I just do this.

2650
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:37,080
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2651
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:42,340
It's so OP.

2652
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:45,900
Even if I miss, it's still OP, okay?

2653
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,760
It still works.

2654
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,920
Pew, pew, pew.

2655
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:50,940
God damn it.

2656
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,740
Pew, pew, pew.

2657
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:53,800
Pew.

2658
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,280
Alright.

2659
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,780
What the fuck is that pew, pew?

2660
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:57,020
Pew, pew, pew.

2661
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:58,220
Who made that sound?

2662
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,140
Where did that sound come from?

2663
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:01,920
Did you guys hear that?

2664
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,520
There was no bicycles next to me.

2665
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:08,060
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2666
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,160
God, I'm so good.

2667
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:12,640
Nice.

2668
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:16,120
Hard mode is nothing to me.

2669
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,220
Nice.

2670
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:19,720
She's like...

2671
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,080
Chat, what do you mean?

2672
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,160
I am perfectly okay.

2673
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:25,700
Alright.

2674
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,280
I went to therapy yesterday.

2675
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:29,780
Alright, nice.

2676
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:31,740
Alright, dragoons, get over here.

2677
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,020
Dragoons.

2678
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,100
I need you over here right now.

2679
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,380
Okay, I need heal too.

2680
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,680
I need a snacky break time.

2681
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:41,220
Oh shit!

2682
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:42,800
Is that dynamite?

2683
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:43,980
Bro!

2684
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:46,950
Is that fucking...

2685
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:49,000
Who gave you dynamite?

2686
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:49,900
What is that?

2687
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:53,720
Oh my god.

2688
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:54,480
Hey!

2689
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,700
They have fucking dynamite.

2690
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,560
That's a waste of good toilet paper.

2691
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,340
Oh!

2692
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,360
Oh my god!

2693
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:05,740
Those are...

2694
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:08,200
Those are dynamitrous little students.

2695
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,180
Sad!

2696
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:18,160
Bro, DLs are working for them too?

2697
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,060
Oh, they're fireworks.

2698
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:24,220
Oh my god.

2699
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,620
I can't believe it.

2700
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,140
I can't believe it.

2701
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,540
Sand got the illegal...

2702
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:29,220
You can't keep running into air.

2703
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,580
Illegal kindergarteners.

2704
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,000
Let me go.

2705
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,300
Let me go!

2706
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,820
He got the sixth graders.

2707
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,560
Where am I?

2708
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,080
Am I stuck?

2709
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,040
Holy shit.

2710
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:45,880
I need to get out of here.

2711
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,300
Oh my god.

2712
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,060
I need to get out of here.

2713
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,780
Who told me to do hard mode?

2714
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,740
I don't know.

2715
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,000
I don't know.

2716
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,040
I don't know.

2717
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,100
Holy fuck.

2718
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:55,080
Oh my god.

2719
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:58,060
How did this game get like...

2720
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:01,060
How did the difficulty spike become like this?

2721
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:03,900
Okay, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2722
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,120
Okay, we're good.

2723
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:06,860
We're like four enemies at once.

2724
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:08,400
So we got extra bonus achievements.

2725
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:09,380
Oh god.

2726
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,720
Oh god, the sixth graders.

2727
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:11,980
Oh my god.

2728
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,920
The sixth graders are here.

2729
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:16,620
Nice.

2730
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:17,720
You can't be invisible.

2731
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,320
When I have my magic wand.

2732
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:21,320
They're going for their needs.

2733
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,860
Oh, the hockey players.

2734
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,500
The sixth graders are coming.

2735
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:26,160
Did you just hit me?

2736
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,980
The consequences of my actions.

2737
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:30,620
Oh no.

2738
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:32,380
That was a bad...

2739
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:33,380
Okay, we're good.

2740
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:35,580
We're good.

2741
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:36,940
It's like my...

2742
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:40,300
It's like my fucking dainty wand does nothing.

2743
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,500
We have to kill him together.

2744
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,720
Smash your knees.

2745
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:46,820
As a team.

2746
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:47,960
Don't wait for that.

2747
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,540
He hasn't hit puberty yet.

2748
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:50,840
He's waiting.

2749
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:50,960
He's waiting.

2750
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,060
He's waiting.

2751
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:51,200
He's waiting.

2752
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:52,740
We can take him down.

2753
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:53,500
Oh, nice.

2754
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:53,940
Dark matter.

2755
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:55,020
Wait.

2756
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:56,060
What's over there?

2757
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,160
Is there a secret?

2758
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:58,400
Oh, there's a secret elf.

2759
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,220
There's a secret elf.

2760
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:00,880
No honor.

2761
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,500
No honor.

2762
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:05,560
Oh god.

2763
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,100
Wait, he like life steals too.

2764
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,400
Okay.

2765
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,400
I'm just gonna do this and then zap him from right here.

2766
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,600
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2767
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:15,920
Pew, pew, pew.

2768
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:18,440
Jesus Christ.

2769
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,580
He's so tanky.

2770
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:21,300
He's actually so tanky.

2771
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:25,320
Here we go.

2772
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:29,980
We have to make sure he doesn't life steal because he's been like living forever because of that.

2773
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:31,560
Hey, it's toilet paper.

2774
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:34,240
Did we kill the sixth grader yet?

2775
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,440
Oh no.

2776
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:37,440
Oh no, he's still alive.

2777
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:41,560
Pew, pew, pew.

2778
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:42,940
Wait, what?

2779
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,000
Wait, did he...

2780
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,880
Wait.

2781
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:51,300
I'm so sorry.

2782
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,560
Oh shit.

2783
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,400
Who taught you that word?

2784
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:01,720
Whoa.

2785
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:06,160
He cussed in my Christian... very Christian friendly game by the way.

2786
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:09,760
He cussed in my very Christian friendly game.

2787
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:13,040
I can't believe... he said a no-no word.

2788
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,000
Come and get it.

2789
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:16,620
Girls?

2790
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,200
Oh no.

2791
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:19,740
Oh no.

2792
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:23,920
Guys, I'm very nervous.

2793
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:31,900
I didn't know girls would be playing... would be playing Dungeons and Dragons.

2794
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,140
I'm so nervous.

2795
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:38,320
Bullshit.

2796
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:41,460
What's the bullshit?

2797
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:42,840
Oh, it's fine.

2798
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:43,940
I've been using my...

2799
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:43,980
Your weapons are cursed.

2800
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,660
From sticks to kind of floppy snakes.

2801
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:46,920
That's okay.

2802
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,000
I've never been...

2803
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,580
I haven't been using anything else anyway.

2804
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:51,300
I hate you.

2805
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:51,700
Oh shit.

2806
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,420
No, not the children.

2807
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,000
All right.

2808
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,040
Pew, pew, pew.

2809
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:57,660
What were my bullshit?

2810
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:58,680
Okay, then gas.

2811
01:43:58,740 --> 01:43:59,940
Okay, I don't need to use it yet.

2812
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,800
I'm gonna use... use one of them for Stan.

2813
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,580
The marsh walker.

2814
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,100
Okay, we need to get over here.

2815
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,820
No, I almost used the melee.

2816
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,780
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

2817
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,300
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

2818
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,240
All right.

2819
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,000
We gotta get rid of the fireworks.

2820
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:21,280
The fireworks are so...

2821
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:23,120
People are actually really annoying.

2822
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:23,480
No!

2823
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,880
Hey!

2824
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:30,280
I can't fly up there!

2825
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,410
Hey, free food.

2826
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:38,090
Oh my god.

2827
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:39,250
I can't believe it.

2828
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:42,370
I have to walk all the way up here.

2829
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:44,970
Like a fucking peasant.

2830
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:47,390
Pew, pew, pew.

2831
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:53,690
I can't believe I had to walk like a fucking child.

2832
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:56,490
I am the chosen one.

2833
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:56,970
I am the chosen one.

2834
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:59,230
How could you do this to me?

2835
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:00,450
I'll just stay up here.

2836
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:01,610
Oh, what?

2837
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:02,970
What the fuck?

2838
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:05,010
Oh my god.

2839
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:06,970
They're in the fucking snow.

2840
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:07,850
They can climb up?

2841
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:10,030
Who taught you kids how to climb?

2842
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:12,730
Okay, we got...

2843
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:13,390
Oh my...

2844
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:14,150
Okay, Noodle's gone.

2845
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:15,230
Noodle's gone.

2846
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:16,830
Guys, don't worry.

2847
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:18,030
They're not burning to death.

2848
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:18,630
Guys.

2849
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:21,290
It's just all make believe.

2850
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:26,330
It's all make believe.

2851
01:45:26,410 --> 01:45:26,970
They're not actually burning to death.

2852
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:28,250
They're actually burning to death.

2853
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:29,050
They'll be fine.

2854
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:31,570
They'll be fine.

2855
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:33,210
The kids don't actually die.

2856
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:35,210
The final wave is coming.

2857
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:36,550
Where the fuck is the final wave?

2858
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:39,390
It's just pretend, chat.

2859
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:41,130
It's just pretend.

2860
01:45:44,190 --> 01:45:44,490
Alright.

2861
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:47,090
How can we find... I don't even know.

2862
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:50,890
I don't even know how people are gonna find my session.

2863
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:53,870
But that's... this is why I'm the host.

2864
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:56,410
I'll always be number one.

2865
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,130
Jimmy!

2866
01:45:57,790 --> 01:45:58,730
Any upgrades?

2867
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:01,210
They're still co- Who's still alive?

2868
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:05,550
I killed everybody.

2869
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:08,490
I mean like... I pretend killed everybody.

2870
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:11,090
Oh, they're up there.

2871
01:46:13,690 --> 01:46:14,350
Alright.

2872
01:46:14,470 --> 01:46:17,390
I think it would be a lot easier if I joined somebody's party.

2873
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:18,990
But like...

2874
01:46:18,990 --> 01:46:23,670
Oh my god, you were in the fucking snow this entire time.

2875
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:25,770
Can't believe it.

2876
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:27,310
I can't believe it.

2877
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:28,410
I can't even see him.

2878
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:31,830
My magic wand won't let me see.

2879
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:36,890
I need to get him out of the invisibility and then use...

2880
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:38,530
He fucking full healed?

2881
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:40,130
God.

2882
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:41,930
These guys are the worst.

2883
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:44,990
These guys are actually the worst.

2884
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:47,690
They can full heal if they hit us.

2885
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:49,730
No, no.

2886
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,230
Don't let him...

2887
01:46:50,230 --> 01:46:51,190
Don't let him life steal!

2888
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,330
Don't let him life steal!

2889
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:53,290
He's 1 HP!

2890
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:54,590
Nice.

2891
01:46:56,530 --> 01:46:57,290
Okay.

2892
01:46:58,090 --> 01:46:58,850
No.

2893
01:46:59,050 --> 01:46:59,810
No, I messed it up.

2894
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:00,910
Wee!

2895
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:02,710
How do I mess that up twice?

2896
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:03,690
Alright.

2897
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:04,270
Yay!

2898
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:08,150
We did it!

2899
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:10,270
Jimmy!

2900
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:11,250
I did it!

2901
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:11,630
Jimmy!

2902
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:22,550
Wand flames leave fire patches that last 4 seconds and deals 3 damage.

2903
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:24,650
Uhhhh...

2904
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:25,250
Uhhhh...

2905
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,390
Uhhhh...

2906
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:27,530
Wait, I feel like the molotov...

2907
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:29,530
Okay, I feel like we should get napalm.

2908
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:31,510
I think that would be really good.

2909
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:32,850
I don't want to waste my money yet.

2910
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:34,370
Alright, let's go.

2911
01:47:34,770 --> 01:47:35,730
Let's go, dragoons.

2912
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:40,410
Entering Main Street.

2913
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:42,690
Oh, hey guys!

2914
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:45,870
Find Stan and smash his army.

2915
01:47:46,090 --> 01:47:47,630
And then kick him in the bowels if you can.

2916
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:52,760
Here!

2917
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,340
Your army won't help you, Cartman!

2918
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,540
You're gonna die today!

2919
01:47:57,290 --> 01:47:59,310
I said, you're gonna die today!

2920
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:00,650
Yeah, yeah!

2921
01:48:00,650 --> 01:48:01,050
You're gonna die today!

2922
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,360
What the fuck?

2923
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:20,710
Bro, what?

2924
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:22,650
That's okay, it's just a scratch.

2925
01:48:22,910 --> 01:48:24,470
The new kid's dead!

2926
01:48:27,450 --> 01:48:28,970
Um, no they're not!

2927
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:31,050
They're only... mostly dead!

2928
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:33,470
Yeah, just a little concussion!

2929
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:38,090
Oh yeah, your axe gave them, um, dysentery.

2930
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:40,650
Dysentery only does 99%...

2931
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:43,290
That's not fair!

2932
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:45,050
Hey, I don't make the rules!

2933
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:46,870
Actually, I kinda do.

2934
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:48,130
Yeah!

2935
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:50,650
Yeah!

2936
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:51,330
What the hell?

2937
01:48:51,490 --> 01:48:52,190
It's okay!

2938
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:54,950
I'm just bleeding a little bit out of my head!

2939
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:55,450
It's okay!

2940
01:48:55,450 --> 01:48:58,250
You have the potential strength to collect vials of a mysterious gooey step.

2941
01:48:58,530 --> 01:49:00,510
And then use the goo to forge an axe.

2942
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:04,460
This isn't fair, Butters!

2943
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,380
You have to figure something out so I can beat Stan!

2944
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:11,800
Well, there is an official anything you can do, I can do too clause in the rulebook, so technically...

2945
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,360
Who wrote the Book of Laws?

2946
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,240
...and get his secret power?

2947
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:15,020
Oh, good!

2948
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:16,160
Do that, new kid!

2949
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:17,320
Finish the quest!

2950
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:18,200
Get powered up!

2951
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,400
And stop embarrassing me!

2952
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:19,880
Eeeeee!

2953
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,900
I cast a spell, your health is back to 100!

2954
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:23,540
Get the fuck up!

2955
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:25,020
God, I have to do everything around here!

2956
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:25,780
I did it!

2957
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,740
My HP is just 100 again!

2958
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:29,420
Good luck!

2959
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:29,920
You're gonna need it!

2960
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:30,120
Yay!

2961
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:32,340
Dun dun dun!

2962
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:33,700
Well, don't scare the new fellas!

2963
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,440
Be nice to them!

2964
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:36,240
Stay off the streets?

2965
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,700
Oh, I guess like I have to go here.

2966
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,240
I'm gonna go this way.

2967
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:43,600
What the fuck?

2968
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,180
Remember that Stan has that bullshit axe now!

2969
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:47,000
Touch the ground and you die like lava!

2970
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:47,800
Oh!

2971
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:51,340
Oh, he can use his axe to like kill me!

2972
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,320
Really?

2973
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:53,680
What happens if I...

2974
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:54,820
Oh, yeah!

2975
01:49:55,740 --> 01:49:57,400
Do I get dysentery again?

2976
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:01,820
It's just a scratch.

2977
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:06,040
It's okay, he only did 99% damage!

2978
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:09,060
Okay, we need to get these guys.

2979
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,720
Pew pew pew pew pew!

2980
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:12,740
Ow!

2981
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,840
With my stuff?

2982
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:16,980
Yeah!

2983
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:18,660
Am I stuck here?

2984
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:19,400
Okay, there we go.

2985
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,280
It's alright.

2986
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:21,880
I can just stay down here.

2987
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:23,760
Oh, I got some stuff here too.

2988
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:25,520
Stay off the streets.

2989
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:27,020
Can I just bone rush this?

2990
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:28,440
I don't level up or anything.

2991
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:30,160
The best I get is like...

2992
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,820
I think the best I get is like...

2993
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:34,960
Toilet paper.

2994
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:37,460
Okay, I need to fucking...

2995
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:39,240
I need to fucking heal myself though.

2996
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:41,020
It's alright!

2997
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:41,820
There's fire!

2998
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:42,600
I drop...

2999
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,560
Oh, it's not okay!

3000
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,160
It's not okay!

3001
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:46,280
Shut up!

3002
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,920
It was not okay.

3003
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:48,800
JK.

3004
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:50,520
Okay, I got the snacks right here.

3005
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,280
I'll heal right underneath you.

3006
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,540
You can't do anything about it.

3007
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,760
Oh, player one!

3008
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:55,900
You okay now?

3009
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:56,820
Yeah, I'm okay.

3010
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:00,300
Yeah, I'm okay.

3011
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:03,480
Can't do anything to me.

3012
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:05,400
I thought it would feel different.

3013
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:06,160
Alright, nice.

3014
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,480
I guess I'm done playing.

3015
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,300
Grabbing some toilet paper.

3016
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:10,180
Oh my god!

3017
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:12,160
She's pretend dead, don't worry.

3018
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,020
They're all pretend dead, chat!

3019
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,640
Shit, the next roof is too high!

3020
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:17,320
And that catapult has a lock on it!

3021
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:18,880
We'll have to fight to move forward!

3022
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,500
Alright, we need to grab some more toilet paper.

3023
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:23,860
I'm crossing it!

3024
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,180
Stay off the street.

3025
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:26,600
I think we just have to move forward.

3026
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,460
So we'll be fine.

3027
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:27,640
Oh!

3028
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:28,740
Oh!

3029
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:30,080
Okay, that's my fire.

3030
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,660
They have to get into my fire.

3031
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,020
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

3032
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:35,960
Can I unlock it yet?

3033
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:36,520
No!

3034
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:37,340
No!

3035
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:38,300
No!

3036
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:40,360
Not the dysentery!

3037
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:41,780
Where am I?

3038
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:42,740
Okay, we're fine.

3039
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:43,800
We're fine.

3040
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:43,880
We're fine.

3041
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:44,940
We're fine.

3042
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:46,600
Please!

3043
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,700
Please, not the dysentery!

3044
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:52,120
Alright, toilet paper is the currency!

3045
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:55,340
Okay, can I pick this lock?

3046
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:56,140
Weeeee!

3047
01:51:57,260 --> 01:51:58,940
Keep moving across the rooftops!

3048
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,800
Alright, we gotta get across.

3049
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:03,780
And kill Stan the Marsh Walker.

3050
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,720
Alright, let's see.

3051
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:10,160
I just beat that shit up?

3052
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:12,060
Oh no, there's a platform right here!

3053
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:12,800
Friends!

3054
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:14,060
Where did my friends go?

3055
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:16,960
How many tunnels are in this driveway?

3056
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,680
Where did all my dragoons go?

3057
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,200
Friends!

3058
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:26,880
Guys, I swear I have friends.

3059
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:28,220
Guys, I swear.

3060
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,520
I swear to God.

3061
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,180
They'll show up soon.

3062
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,580
They'll show up!

3063
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:39,620
God, the servers have been so unstable, chat!

3064
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:40,720
Wait.

3065
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:42,360
Oh, I need toilet paper here.

3066
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:44,360
Toilet paper.

3067
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:48,300
Alright, here we go.

3068
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:49,300
Well shit, they broke the catapult.

3069
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,200
How do we get across now?

3070
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,820
Well actually, Erk, I think that there was a trebuchet.

3071
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,380
Actually, I think you should shut the fuck up, butters.

3072
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:57,980
We need something stretchy and rubbery to make a new sling.

3073
01:52:58,100 --> 01:52:58,980
Get looking, new kid!

3074
01:52:59,260 --> 01:52:59,960
What the look?

3075
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:01,640
Where the fuck did I get...

3076
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:02,460
Oh, rubber bands!

3077
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:05,160
Okay, we gotta grab some rubber bands.

3078
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:07,920
Is there like rubber bands behind...

3079
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,160
Okay, rubber bands over there.

3080
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:13,140
I'm gonna go back fully first before I...

3081
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:14,560
Oh, I should have upgraded stamina.

3082
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:19,900
I did not realize how much stamina matters until now.

3083
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:22,640
Oh shit, there's actual people down there.

3084
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:23,500
Alright.

3085
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,240
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

3086
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,420
Pew, pew.

3087
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:31,600
That's right.

3088
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:32,140
Burn!

3089
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:34,680
Holy shit!

3090
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:37,420
This fucking napalm shit is so OP.

3091
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:38,800
Yes, new kid.

3092
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:39,200
That's perfect.

3093
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,660
It's actually so strong.

3094
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:45,520
Like, what the fuck?

3095
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:47,880
It does so much damage.

3096
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:49,860
No wonder it's legendary.

3097
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:53,220
Oh, I wish I could like buy the palace forever.

3098
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,120
Alice, thank you for the super chat.

3099
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:58,020
Thank you, thank you.

3100
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:02,440
Okay, I'm gonna fucking speed run over to the next rubber band.

3101
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:03,700
Oh, I can't!

3102
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:05,420
Deliver the... what?

3103
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:07,080
No, they're rubber bands!

3104
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:08,440
What?

3105
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:12,400
I can't!

3106
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,800
Wait a minute.

3107
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,860
Wait a minute.

3108
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:20,080
I thought it were rubber bands!

3109
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,120
What do you mean?

3110
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:23,920
Okay.

3111
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:25,560
Oh.

3112
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:29,140
I'm gonna put the rubber band in.

3113
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:31,040
The very real rubber band!

3114
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:32,880
Nice.

3115
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:34,020
Ah!

3116
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,360
No!

3117
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:36,780
Come down and fight Bear!

3118
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:38,580
No!

3119
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:39,180
No!

3120
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:43,450
Oh, holy shit.

3121
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:45,090
Okay, I'm gonna use the bubble.

3122
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:46,610
So I can...

3123
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:47,630
I'm tossing it!

3124
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:48,530
No, please.

3125
01:54:49,110 --> 01:54:49,550
Someone.

3126
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:50,990
Someone, please.

3127
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:52,550
Mimi, please!

3128
01:54:52,610 --> 01:54:53,410
Where are you?

3129
01:54:53,910 --> 01:54:54,350
Mimi!

3130
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:56,950
Mimi!

3131
01:54:59,130 --> 01:54:59,570
Ria!

3132
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:00,970
Incoming!

3133
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:02,590
Okay, we need to get rid of this firework.

3134
01:55:02,710 --> 01:55:03,470
Yes, I'm slaying!

3135
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:03,610
Okay.

3136
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:04,530
Bringing the pain!

3137
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:06,090
Okay, we got rid of one of them.

3138
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:08,530
Oh, we have...

3139
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:10,830
It's more than one rubber band?

3140
01:55:11,390 --> 01:55:11,970
Yes, I'm slaying!

3141
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:14,750
Okay, I'm gonna head over.

3142
01:55:15,150 --> 01:55:17,330
I'm heading over to the other rubber band right now.

3143
01:55:19,730 --> 01:55:20,830
Wait, is she okay?

3144
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:21,970
She's okay.

3145
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:22,710
She'll be fine.

3146
01:55:23,570 --> 01:55:24,870
She'll be so fine.

3147
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:26,290
Oh, God.

3148
01:55:27,930 --> 01:55:29,150
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

3149
01:55:29,630 --> 01:55:30,070
Nice.

3150
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:31,250
More toilet paper.

3151
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:34,610
I'm gonna grab a chest.

3152
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:35,610
Open!

3153
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:38,790
Grabbing the dark matter.

3154
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:39,930
Taking this.

3155
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,710
God.

3156
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:41,970
I'm gonna grab this.

3157
01:55:41,970 --> 01:55:44,590
Guys, it's just to protect the catapult, okay?

3158
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:46,310
How is that?

3159
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:47,290
Like a clown condom?

3160
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:49,710
It's a...

3161
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:52,470
It's to make balloon animals.

3162
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:55,150
Chat, it's a balloon animal.

3163
01:55:56,110 --> 01:55:59,490
It's what clowns use to make balloon animals.

3164
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:01,290
That's what it is.

3165
01:56:02,290 --> 01:56:03,510
Truly, right?

3166
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:09,610
That's why it's so stretchy and long.

3167
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:10,890
Whoa.

3168
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:13,530
Look how long it...

3169
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:20,050
It makes really big balloon animals.

3170
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:20,970
They can make a dog.

3171
01:56:24,370 --> 01:56:24,970
Alright.

3172
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:26,390
We're gonna grab...

3173
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:27,170
Get rid of...

3174
01:56:27,170 --> 01:56:29,090
I'm just gonna fucking bone rush it.

3175
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:30,170
It's okay.

3176
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:32,290
I have my dragoons here to distract them.

3177
01:56:33,490 --> 01:56:34,270
It's alright.

3178
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:37,090
I don't need to save them.

3179
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:37,950
They're independent.

3180
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:39,710
They're strong, independent goons.

3181
01:56:40,270 --> 01:56:40,870
I'm gonna go get them.

3182
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:42,390
Here you go.

3183
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:44,530
Where the fuck is the last rubber band?

3184
01:56:45,010 --> 01:56:46,390
The last balloon animal.

3185
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:47,930
There it is.

3186
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:50,270
Oh, no.

3187
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:54,930
It's just noodle arms.

3188
01:56:54,970 --> 01:56:55,430
That's fine.

3189
01:56:58,890 --> 01:56:59,530
It's okay.

3190
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:00,350
I can just run.

3191
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:04,430
I'm just gonna run.

3192
01:57:05,490 --> 01:57:06,250
It's alright.

3193
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:07,110
We're fine!

3194
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:08,950
Ignore everybody!

3195
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:10,850
We have so many animals.

3196
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:13,270
So much toilet paper, we don't need the money!

3197
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:20,070
Oh god, the hockey player is still here.

3198
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:22,950
Get off me!

3199
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:25,410
Ref!

3200
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:29,610
I did it!

3201
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:31,770
Goodbye, dragoons!

3202
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:33,370
I'll always remember you!

3203
01:57:37,710 --> 01:57:38,550
Don't worry!

3204
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:42,550
I'll remember everything you've done for me, dragoons!

3205
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:44,830
I did not leave you!

3206
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:52,350
I'll always remember your heart...

3207
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:54,230
Dragoons!

3208
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:55,210
Come back!

3209
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:56,330
Remember me!

3210
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:58,730
Dragoons, take the catapult!

3211
01:57:59,390 --> 01:58:00,190
Take the catapult!

3212
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:04,950
Dragoons, take the catapult!

3213
01:58:08,690 --> 01:58:09,370
Dragoons!

3214
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:12,350
I told you I remember you!

3215
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:13,410
Just take the catapult!

3216
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:20,310
Where are they?

3217
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,190
Please!

3218
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:23,350
I'm on my knees begging!

3219
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:26,790
Just take the catapult, Mimi!

3220
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:28,710
Not the dysentery!

3221
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:31,970
There's a catapult right there!

3222
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:37,570
Oh my god!

3223
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:39,170
Ref!

3224
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:41,070
You have Crandon too!

3225
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:41,870
Shit!

3226
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:44,930
But you're not Ginger, so like you're not as good as me.

3227
01:58:45,470 --> 01:58:46,450
Oh my god!

3228
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:48,010
There you go.

3229
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:48,810
See?

3230
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:49,410
Look at that.

3231
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:50,910
Was that the best you can do?

3232
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:51,750
Look at that, guys.

3233
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:52,150
See?

3234
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:54,290
I always remember my goons.

3235
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:55,250
Chat.

3236
01:58:55,470 --> 01:58:56,230
That was a bad choice for me.

3237
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:57,890
I always remember them.

3238
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,730
Never forget.

3239
01:58:58,890 --> 01:59:00,450
Never forget what they did.

3240
01:59:01,230 --> 01:59:01,790
Where did you get this?

3241
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:04,870
Guys, I...

3242
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:06,150
Guys, I told you.

3243
01:59:06,190 --> 01:59:07,430
Never leave a goon behind.

3244
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:10,130
Never leave a goon behind.

3245
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:10,730
Chat.

3246
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:12,850
Oh my god.

3247
01:59:12,890 --> 01:59:14,810
Am I burning people or are they burning people?

3248
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:17,370
I would never.

3249
01:59:17,790 --> 01:59:19,830
I would never do something that fucked up.

3250
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:22,750
Okay, we're gonna have to get rid of these guys.

3251
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:24,090
Alright.

3252
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:24,890
Nice.

3253
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:26,630
I used the shield just in time.

3254
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:28,510
Come on.

3255
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:29,930
Die!

3256
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:32,870
Why are you guys so fucking tanky?

3257
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:36,830
My shield should go... You're literally standing on napalm!

3258
01:59:37,390 --> 01:59:38,010
Here we go.

3259
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:38,310
We're good.

3260
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:39,910
We're good.

3261
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:40,950
I defeat...

3262
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:41,690
Oh god.

3263
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:42,590
Not the hockey players.

3264
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:43,330
It's okay.

3265
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:44,870
They can't take high ground.

3266
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:46,190
There we go.

3267
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:47,670
They don't know how to climb.

3268
01:59:47,770 --> 01:59:48,630
He knows how to climb.

3269
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:49,730
He knows how to climb.

3270
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:53,070
But what if he doesn't know how to climb this platform though?

3271
01:59:56,930 --> 01:59:57,630
It's okay.

3272
01:59:57,950 --> 02:00:00,470
He doesn't know how to climb this one.

3273
02:00:01,190 --> 02:00:02,970
That was a bad choice for me.

3274
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:03,410
Here we go.

3275
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:04,930
That's right.

3276
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:05,150
See?

3277
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:05,890
I told you.

3278
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:06,670
New kid.

3279
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:07,650
Jump down and find Jimmy.

3280
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:08,390
Jimmy?

3281
02:00:08,570 --> 02:00:09,790
Where the fuck is Jimmy?

3282
02:00:10,230 --> 02:00:11,110
Jimmy's over here.

3283
02:00:12,270 --> 02:00:12,750
Jimmy!

3284
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:14,510
That's not Jimmy.

3285
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:16,010
Oh, Jimmy's over here.

3286
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:17,910
There's also chests.

3287
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:20,250
Nice.

3288
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:21,170
More dark matter.

3289
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:22,410
Is that another chest over there?

3290
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:24,130
No, that's just a dead guy.

3291
02:00:24,810 --> 02:00:25,490
Pretend dead.

3292
02:00:26,990 --> 02:00:28,590
That's just a guy being pretended.

3293
02:00:29,810 --> 02:00:30,290
Alright.

3294
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:31,110
We move on.

3295
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:32,050
Woo!

3296
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:36,440
Hello Jimmy.

3297
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,440
Hello Jimmy.

3298
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:38,520
Alright.

3299
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:39,280
Let's see.

3300
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:40,540
They're all coming.

3301
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,540
From behind with your dagger.

3302
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:43,500
Okay.

3303
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:44,340
We're gonna reshuffle.

3304
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,240
These cards suck.

3305
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:47,140
Oh!

3306
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,740
When using pissed off heal 40...

3307
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:52,860
I feel like I haven't really used the pissed off abilities.

3308
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:54,780
So...

3309
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:57,120
Alright.

3310
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,360
I actually forgot which one was pissed off.

3311
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,120
Higher one.

3312
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:02,320
Use bullshit...

3313
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:02,560
Wait.

3314
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:04,040
How do I use pissed off?

3315
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:06,240
Do I automatically use my pissed off button?

3316
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:07,220
Enjoy these upgrades new kid.

3317
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:07,780
You've earned them.

3318
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:09,340
Okay.

3319
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:10,160
Missed chests.

3320
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:11,320
That's alright.

3321
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:13,720
We're just gonna move on.

3322
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:16,480
Mimi!

3323
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:17,200
Get over here!

3324
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,320
Wait for everyone to upgrade?

3325
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:23,120
Oh yeah.

3326
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:23,900
Mimi has to upgrade.

3327
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:25,100
Oh!

3328
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,360
The Q and E!

3329
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:26,920
Oh!

3330
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:31,920
That's the pissed off stuff.

3331
02:01:35,790 --> 02:01:37,910
Looks like you've stumbled right into a marsh walker ambush.

3332
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:38,650
Go get it!

3333
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:39,390
That's just mana.

3334
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:39,970
Oh!

3335
02:01:41,530 --> 02:01:44,230
That makes so much more sense now.

3336
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:50,730
I have been using them.

3337
02:01:52,350 --> 02:01:53,170
I knew.

3338
02:01:53,230 --> 02:01:54,550
I was just testing you guys.

3339
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:55,990
I knew all along.

3340
02:01:56,730 --> 02:01:59,290
I just wanted... I was just testing all of you.

3341
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:00,630
Alright.

3342
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:01,030
Nice.

3343
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:02,650
Okay.

3344
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:03,170
Shield.

3345
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:04,270
Alright.

3346
02:02:04,350 --> 02:02:04,890
I just gotta...

3347
02:02:04,890 --> 02:02:06,690
Just gotta keep my beam up.

3348
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:07,390
God.

3349
02:02:07,470 --> 02:02:08,650
This attack is so strong.

3350
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:11,070
I think I'm gonna fucking be a wand user.

3351
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:13,950
I'm gonna be a filthy magic user.

3352
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:14,890
Pew!

3353
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:15,250
Pew!

3354
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:15,710
Pew!

3355
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:16,090
Pew!

3356
02:02:16,090 --> 02:02:16,290
Pew!

3357
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:17,610
Alright.

3358
02:02:17,770 --> 02:02:18,970
Now seven more enemies.

3359
02:02:19,510 --> 02:02:20,870
Kick all their asses.

3360
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:21,710
Get over here child!

3361
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:23,570
Get over here!

3362
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:25,210
You're not going to first grade!

3363
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,890
You're gonna be held back in kindergarten.

3364
02:02:28,290 --> 02:02:28,630
Jimmy!

3365
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:30,470
Oh Jimmy.

3366
02:02:30,670 --> 02:02:31,230
Get over here.

3367
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:32,790
Oh I cannot use during combat?

3368
02:02:32,890 --> 02:02:33,430
God damn it.

3369
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:34,970
Guys we need to kill five more!

3370
02:02:37,810 --> 02:02:38,350
Here we go.

3371
02:02:38,830 --> 02:02:39,230
Yay!

3372
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:43,270
Alright.

3373
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:44,630
They're all in my fire.

3374
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:45,270
So that's good.

3375
02:02:45,610 --> 02:02:46,870
We're taking all the damage.

3376
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:49,650
Shield!

3377
02:02:50,370 --> 02:02:50,970
Last guy.

3378
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:52,370
Don't get one guy.

3379
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:53,210
Wait.

3380
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:54,290
Where's the last guy?

3381
02:02:55,570 --> 02:02:56,210
Wait a minute.

3382
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:57,810
He's all the way over here?

3383
02:02:58,150 --> 02:02:59,370
How did he get over here?

3384
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:00,290
Is he stuck?

3385
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:02,470
What is he doing?

3386
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:03,970
Kid!

3387
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:06,450
You can't hide from me.

3388
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:07,810
You can't hide from me.

3389
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:09,290
You die here.

3390
02:03:09,690 --> 02:03:10,310
Alright.

3391
02:03:10,350 --> 02:03:10,590
Nice.

3392
02:03:10,630 --> 02:03:10,930
Upgrade!

3393
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:15,230
The bubble burns enemies inside it.

3394
02:03:15,250 --> 02:03:16,210
Oh my god!

3395
02:03:16,650 --> 02:03:18,150
Oh I cannot upgrade it.

3396
02:03:18,230 --> 02:03:18,990
I'm too weak.

3397
02:03:21,430 --> 02:03:22,050
Nice.

3398
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:22,910
Alright.

3399
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:23,130
Let's go.

3400
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:25,730
No child left behind.

3401
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:26,450
Exactly.

3402
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:31,390
Alright.

3403
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:35,250
I'm done with this.

3404
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:37,110
You're taking all the damage!

3405
02:03:37,110 --> 02:03:37,890
We did not read that truck.

3406
02:03:38,230 --> 02:03:38,490
Haha.

3407
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:41,810
What's a boomerang?

3408
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:47,830
by Zegon He's so relatable!

3409
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:50,850
He's so relatable.

3410
02:03:51,210 --> 02:03:51,650
Haha.

3411
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:54,610
True.

3412
02:03:55,350 --> 02:03:56,050
Just like me.

3413
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:56,550
For real.

3414
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:56,970
For real.

3415
02:03:57,250 --> 02:03:57,990
I just wanna get out of here.

3416
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:00,590
So fucking true.

3417
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:02,710
Run!

3418
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:04,750
Just run!

3419
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:07,910
Who cares?

3420
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:10,410
Oh, just keep running!

3421
02:04:14,770 --> 02:04:20,090
Okay, guys, we have to actually attack, guys.

3422
02:04:20,490 --> 02:04:23,010
Apparently, we actually have to fight.

3423
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:24,950
We can't just run.

3424
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:28,110
God damn it.

3425
02:04:28,610 --> 02:04:30,790
We can't just run, chat.

3426
02:04:32,890 --> 02:04:35,710
We actually have to kill everybody.

3427
02:04:38,410 --> 02:04:39,410
Alright, here we go.

3428
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:41,710
Wait, what's this?

3429
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:44,110
Oh no, we need a cannonball?

3430
02:04:46,250 --> 02:04:49,470
Does Cartman actually fight or he's just there being a fat ass?

3431
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:50,390
Oh, fuck.

3432
02:04:52,990 --> 02:04:53,990
Can't believe it.

3433
02:04:54,030 --> 02:04:54,750
Not my king.

3434
02:04:54,970 --> 02:04:55,950
A king does not fight.

3435
02:04:56,170 --> 02:04:58,090
A king makes other fight and die for you.

3436
02:04:58,810 --> 02:04:59,950
Right, dragoons?

3437
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:03,350
Alright, you guys will fight for me.

3438
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:05,790
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

3439
02:05:05,850 --> 02:05:07,530
Don't worry, we're gonna beat up the sixth grader.

3440
02:05:08,830 --> 02:05:09,510
It's alright.

3441
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:12,830
You're not gonna see any, girl.

3442
02:05:13,670 --> 02:05:16,870
Puberty is gonna be a fucking miserable time for you.

3443
02:05:17,450 --> 02:05:18,230
Alright, yay!

3444
02:05:19,190 --> 02:05:20,470
Did we kill everybody?

3445
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:21,930
Where?

3446
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:27,510
That one kid over there?

3447
02:05:27,570 --> 02:05:28,070
That's just...

3448
02:05:28,110 --> 02:05:29,010
He's just standing there?

3449
02:05:29,310 --> 02:05:29,830
Bro!

3450
02:05:30,490 --> 02:05:32,270
He's not even... Oh, he's...

3451
02:05:32,930 --> 02:05:34,190
Wait, what?

3452
02:05:36,630 --> 02:05:39,390
I looked at him and then he pretend died.

3453
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:42,750
Get in the catapult.

3454
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:43,810
We need to get over this wall.

3455
02:05:43,810 --> 02:05:45,750
He actually pretend died.

3456
02:05:45,810 --> 02:05:47,390
He's like, oh no, it's Doki.

3457
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:48,550
Oh no.

3458
02:05:50,090 --> 02:05:51,150
We got him.

3459
02:05:51,230 --> 02:05:52,050
We got him.

3460
02:05:52,350 --> 02:05:53,650
We gotta tap out.

3461
02:05:54,330 --> 02:05:55,210
Okay, I'm running.

3462
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:56,150
No!

3463
02:05:56,770 --> 02:05:58,110
Get me outta here.

3464
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:00,150
Where do we have to go?

3465
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:01,870
Jimmy!

3466
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:03,270
Is he here?

3467
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:04,350
Is he at the theater?

3468
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:06,610
Where the fuck is he?

3469
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:08,090
Find him near City Halla.

3470
02:06:08,650 --> 02:06:09,850
Is this City Halla?

3471
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:14,670
Where the fuck are they?

3472
02:06:16,810 --> 02:06:18,310
Oh, there's like chests though.

3473
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:22,190
I should actually grab some toilet paper.

3474
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:24,390
I do not have a lot of money.

3475
02:06:25,890 --> 02:06:27,610
Wait, is that... The golf kids!

3476
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:31,550
Okay, replenish all zero.

3477
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:35,810
Sacrifice chain lightning to max the level of all your other upgrades.

3478
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:36,810
No way.

3479
02:06:37,190 --> 02:06:39,370
I'll take the dark matter.

3480
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:44,230
Yeah, there's no way I'm getting rid of the chain lightning.

3481
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:46,870
That chain lightning is actually so fucking good.

3482
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:51,110
It's been like... It's been like clutching it for me.

3483
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:52,670
Cause I can be like extra lazy.

3484
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:57,790
And I love being extra lazy.

3485
02:06:58,310 --> 02:07:00,350
Where the fuck do we go?

3486
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:02,530
Get outta here.

3487
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:04,490
Using a filthy bow.

3488
02:07:06,290 --> 02:07:07,170
Pew!

3489
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:08,450
Damn stuff.

3490
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:10,730
Unlimited power.

3491
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:11,390
No!

3492
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:13,890
During bullshit?

3493
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:15,450
Oh yeah.

3494
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:19,670
Guys!

3495
02:07:21,190 --> 02:07:21,810
Guys!

3496
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:25,130
It's me, the real new kid.

3497
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:25,510
Mimi!

3498
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:26,650
Mimi!

3499
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:28,490
Get over here!

3500
02:07:29,310 --> 02:07:30,870
I'm... It's okay, I don't need you.

3501
02:07:30,930 --> 02:07:32,730
I have real Dragoon number three.

3502
02:07:35,210 --> 02:07:36,670
Real Dragoon number three.

3503
02:07:36,690 --> 02:07:38,390
How long does it take to res me?

3504
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:43,310
Alright, I need to use shield.

3505
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:46,170
Alright, nice.

3506
02:07:46,650 --> 02:07:49,430
Just gonna... You know I'm gonna put a totem pole right inside here.

3507
02:07:49,770 --> 02:07:50,850
It should be fine.

3508
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:52,130
Woo!

3509
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:55,030
They burn inside my bubble anyway.

3510
02:07:56,150 --> 02:08:00,250
They burn... So I get my pissed off rage at the same time.

3511
02:08:01,010 --> 02:08:04,090
So I never lose my piss off cause they're always in my bubble.

3512
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:05,050
We need more forces!

3513
02:08:05,190 --> 02:08:05,910
Come on Mark Blackheart!

3514
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:08,010
Where the fuck... Oh no!

3515
02:08:08,330 --> 02:08:09,070
Sixth graders!

3516
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:10,730
Did you just hit me?

3517
02:08:11,270 --> 02:08:12,090
Get out!

3518
02:08:12,230 --> 02:08:13,090
Sixth graders please!

3519
02:08:13,190 --> 02:08:13,870
I'm so sorry!

3520
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:15,670
You're okay, you're fine.

3521
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:16,210
Please!

3522
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:17,990
I'm so sorry!

3523
02:08:18,070 --> 02:08:18,670
I'm so scared!

3524
02:08:21,210 --> 02:08:21,750
Alright.

3525
02:08:22,370 --> 02:08:26,230
They have a lot of unresolved issues cause they get bullied by the seventh graders!

3526
02:08:26,810 --> 02:08:27,730
Here I come!

3527
02:08:28,070 --> 02:08:28,770
Alright, nice.

3528
02:08:29,390 --> 02:08:30,990
Alright, I'm gonna go inside.

3529
02:08:31,330 --> 02:08:31,530
Oh!

3530
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:33,150
Holy fuck!

3531
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:34,450
God that hurt.

3532
02:08:35,790 --> 02:08:38,150
I'm always... That's the secret.

3533
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:39,610
I'm always pissed off.

3534
02:08:40,230 --> 02:08:40,770
Alright.

3535
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:43,550
They're still like the...

3536
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:45,910
Alright, oh no.

3537
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:46,370
The girls.

3538
02:08:46,490 --> 02:08:46,970
It's the girls.

3539
02:08:47,230 --> 02:08:48,170
I'm so scared.

3540
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:49,710
You think they'll like me later?

3541
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:53,410
Alright, nice.

3542
02:08:53,470 --> 02:08:54,490
That should be all of them.

3543
02:08:54,590 --> 02:08:54,950
Right?

3544
02:08:55,410 --> 02:08:56,450
Did I kill everybody?

3545
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:00,770
Alright, upgrade time.

3546
02:09:01,230 --> 02:09:03,950
Bubble shield is 40% bigger?

3547
02:09:04,410 --> 02:09:05,450
Alright, we're getting that.

3548
02:09:08,370 --> 02:09:10,630
It's 50% bigger now.

3549
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:11,690
Nice.

3550
02:09:12,410 --> 02:09:13,630
Alright, I'm ready for the battle!

3551
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:16,830
Mimi, get over here!

3552
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:19,130
Wait, Mimi, where are you?

3553
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:23,010
Oh, it's... They went to the goth kids.

3554
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:25,870
Alright.

3555
02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:28,330
You gotta upgrade for this and then we're gonna kill Stan Marsh.

3556
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:30,630
We're making up some bullshit rules.

3557
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:37,670
Oh my god, we got cred.

3558
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:38,290
Wait!

3559
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:39,750
You paid $50 too!

3560
02:09:40,990 --> 02:09:43,230
Oh my god, we're both stupid!

3561
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:48,710
We pre-ordered before reading the reviews!

3562
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:50,590
That's us!

3563
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:56,230
We're also in the cred gang.

3564
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:57,830
You're no match for my Marsh Walker powers.

3565
02:09:58,270 --> 02:10:00,130
So I'm just gonna have my friend Kenny kick your ass.

3566
02:10:00,830 --> 02:10:01,230
Kenny?

3567
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:02,950
Alright, you kid, take out Princess Kenny.

3568
02:10:03,150 --> 02:10:05,410
Don't let her kiss you or you're totally gonna be pussy whipped.

3569
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:07,230
Butu's cat.

3570
02:10:10,530 --> 02:10:11,730
What the fuck?

3571
02:10:12,090 --> 02:10:13,050
Oh shit.

3572
02:10:13,530 --> 02:10:15,130
Princess Kenny is working with Stan.

3573
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:15,670
No!

3574
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:18,690
That charming son of a bitch is gonna try and stop us with her big ass ass.

3575
02:10:19,770 --> 02:10:22,210
She's using her anime powers!

3576
02:10:23,910 --> 02:10:25,290
Oh my god!

3577
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:27,250
Somebody stop her!

3578
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:29,170
She's too kawaii!

3579
02:10:31,230 --> 02:10:32,350
Oh my god!

3580
02:10:32,570 --> 02:10:35,270
Dragon number three, you're in love with Kenny?

3581
02:10:35,430 --> 02:10:36,890
I mean, who is it though?

3582
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:37,490
Look at her.

3583
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,910
Your anime magic up.

3584
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:43,470
Holy fuck!

3585
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:46,150
I bought him!

3586
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:50,180
Got a fucking simp, man.

3587
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:53,420
Where is it?

3588
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:53,800
No!

3589
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:54,640
They fell down!

3590
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:55,200
Mimi, no!

3591
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:57,940
Oh my god!

3592
02:10:58,040 --> 02:10:59,640
What is this?

3593
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:01,720
Holy shit.

3594
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:03,220
Alright.

3595
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:05,060
She can fly?

3596
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:07,860
How the fuck does Stan get Kenny?

3597
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:13,000
That's my Oshii.

3598
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:17,580
Alright, we gotta heal.

3599
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:19,780
It's okay.

3600
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:21,740
I have bubble powers.

3601
02:11:23,020 --> 02:11:25,140
He's in the bubble so he's gonna take damage.

3602
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:29,420
This is so much easier than the fucking Kyle fight.

3603
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:31,620
Alright.

3604
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:33,340
I'm good.

3605
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:33,780
I'm good.

3606
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:34,960
I'm heals.

3607
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:36,340
Oh my god, not the bomb.

3608
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:36,960
Not the bomb.

3609
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:38,680
Not the bomb.

3610
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:42,440
Player two, are you tired or did you just get fucked up?

3611
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:43,340
Alright, here we go.

3612
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:43,700
We're good.

3613
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:44,000
We're good.

3614
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:44,240
We're good.

3615
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:45,460
He's one hit!

3616
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:47,500
Princess Kenny's one hit!

3617
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:48,720
Shoot him!

3618
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:51,120
Don't revive Mimi!

3619
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:52,620
Just kill him!

3620
02:11:57,230 --> 02:11:58,270
Mimi down.

3621
02:11:59,250 --> 02:12:01,770
Kenny, you made my Kamiya Oshii.

3622
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:05,270
That's fucking right, Kenny.

3623
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:07,710
It didn't have to be like this.

3624
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:08,310
Damn it.

3625
02:12:09,030 --> 02:12:09,930
We did it.

3626
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,010
See?

3627
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:11,930
Look, you're okay.

3628
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:14,410
You're okay, Mimi.

3629
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:17,990
My... Oh my god, you killed my Oshii.

3630
02:12:18,210 --> 02:12:19,350
That chest over there?

3631
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,090
That is...

3632
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:21,150
Grab that chest.

3633
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:26,230
I'm gonna double check if we're missing anything.

3634
02:12:26,850 --> 02:12:27,950
Alright, we should be good.

3635
02:12:29,290 --> 02:12:30,270
Lead through the gate.

3636
02:12:34,890 --> 02:12:35,910
We're gonna go through.

3637
02:12:35,970 --> 02:12:36,850
We're gonna kill you, Stan.

3638
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:39,550
For giving me dysentery.

3639
02:12:42,210 --> 02:12:43,430
Where the fuck do I go?

3640
02:12:43,770 --> 02:12:44,510
Oh, it's here?

3641
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:45,250
Oh, it's over here.

3642
02:12:46,130 --> 02:12:46,570
Alright.

3643
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:48,150
Yeah!

3644
02:12:48,150 --> 02:12:48,890
We did it!

3645
02:12:51,030 --> 02:12:51,830
Look at that.

3646
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:54,510
Most damage given.

3647
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:02,120
We got defeat 10 shield barriers.

3648
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:04,680
Oh my god, we got the Tesla coin.

3649
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:09,800
Where do I go?

3650
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:12,160
Tesla's always there.

3651
02:13:19,790 --> 02:13:22,430
We defeated the princess, but Stan still needs an ass kicking.

3652
02:13:22,670 --> 02:13:23,510
Good job, new kid.

3653
02:13:23,610 --> 02:13:24,430
Princess kitty toy.

3654
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:25,790
Wait, it's not... Oh, okay.

3655
02:13:25,890 --> 02:13:26,450
I was gonna say.

3656
02:13:26,690 --> 02:13:27,130
Totally cool.

3657
02:13:27,130 --> 02:13:28,970
Now load out and get back out there.

3658
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:30,130
Alright.

3659
02:13:30,850 --> 02:13:34,850
School is closed and I am so fucking bored.

3660
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:38,850
I can sense a growing darkness deep within your soul.

3661
02:13:39,070 --> 02:13:42,330
Join me and we can pierce the veil between the worlds.

3662
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:43,210
Don't be strange and you can't...

3663
02:13:43,210 --> 02:13:45,810
Come find me in the fat kid's backyard.

3664
02:13:46,670 --> 02:13:47,930
What the fuck?

3665
02:13:48,030 --> 02:13:48,950
What is that?

3666
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:49,950
What?

3667
02:13:50,030 --> 02:13:50,910
What is that?

3668
02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:53,010
Stan's been kind of an asshole lately.

3669
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:54,130
That's a struggle.

3670
02:13:55,050 --> 02:13:56,670
What the fu- Where is she?

3671
02:13:57,010 --> 02:13:57,890
Where's the god kid?

3672
02:14:01,210 --> 02:14:02,730
We need to pierce the veil.

3673
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:05,730
Can I unlock anything?

3674
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:07,330
No, I haven't.

3675
02:14:07,930 --> 02:14:09,410
Oh, I got the whoopee cushion.

3676
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:17,370
Release a drifting void that sucks enemies in and...

3677
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:22,750
I feel like the heals and the fucking bubble is just way too good.

3678
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:25,750
Where is he?

3679
02:14:26,910 --> 02:14:28,410
Where the fuck is the god kid?

3680
02:14:28,530 --> 02:14:29,330
Oh, there she is!

3681
02:14:29,590 --> 02:14:29,830
Okay.

3682
02:14:30,290 --> 02:14:31,910
I'm gonna talk to Mr. Hankey first.

3683
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:33,230
Uh...

3684
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:35,690
I am going to...

3685
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:37,410
do...

3686
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:39,350
sprinting...

3687
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:40,550
this.

3688
02:14:40,770 --> 02:14:41,210
Okay.

3689
02:14:41,390 --> 02:14:42,090
That should be it.

3690
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:45,350
Keep taking in that dark matter and you'll get more powerful than you can imagine.

3691
02:14:45,590 --> 02:14:45,750
Wait.

3692
02:14:45,890 --> 02:14:47,430
Don't I have missing- What?

3693
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:51,570
There's DLC- I pre-ordered!

3694
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:53,770
What do you mean?

3695
02:14:55,150 --> 02:14:55,790
Wait!

3696
02:14:55,930 --> 02:14:56,050
Wait!

3697
02:14:56,050 --> 02:14:56,730
There's more?

3698
02:14:57,030 --> 02:14:58,150
Okay, I need a...

3699
02:14:58,150 --> 02:14:58,790
Okay.

3700
02:14:58,870 --> 02:14:59,710
Excuse me?

3701
02:15:00,130 --> 02:15:01,210
That's DLC!

3702
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:05,850
What do you mean that's DLC?

3703
02:15:05,870 --> 02:15:08,730
I literally have the deluxe version!

3704
02:15:13,450 --> 02:15:16,470
I have the deluxe version!

3705
02:15:17,870 --> 02:15:18,510
Wait.

3706
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:19,150
Okay.

3707
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:20,990
Oh, it's free!

3708
02:15:21,150 --> 02:15:23,470
Guys, it's a free DLC chat.

3709
02:15:23,470 --> 02:15:25,150
It's a free DLC.

3710
02:15:25,970 --> 02:15:26,510
Okay.

3711
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:27,450
Alright.

3712
02:15:27,570 --> 02:15:29,050
At least that's free.

3713
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:30,570
Thank god.

3714
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:32,750
I was like, there's no way!

3715
02:15:32,850 --> 02:15:34,690
I literally bought the deluxe version!

3716
02:15:35,050 --> 02:15:36,210
What the fuck do you mean?

3717
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:36,750
Like...

3718
02:15:36,750 --> 02:15:38,910
I need to have more DLC.

3719
02:15:39,190 --> 02:15:41,570
How do I have- need more DLC?

3720
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:45,890
Uh, Zombie, thank you for the super chat.

3721
02:15:45,950 --> 02:15:46,190
Thank you.

3722
02:15:46,270 --> 02:15:46,730
Thank you.

3723
02:15:46,850 --> 02:15:47,370
Behold.

3724
02:15:47,450 --> 02:15:48,650
The land of Zaron.

3725
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:49,930
Wait.

3726
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:51,490
There's only three chapters?

3727
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:52,710
Oh!

3728
02:15:54,010 --> 02:15:54,730
You know what?

3729
02:15:54,790 --> 02:15:55,030
Fuck it.

3730
02:15:55,070 --> 02:15:56,070
Let's just play all of it.

3731
02:15:56,170 --> 02:15:57,490
It's just three more chapters.

3732
02:15:57,710 --> 02:16:00,350
I mean, we're clear- we're so good at this game.

3733
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:01,770
Now I understand!

3734
02:16:02,770 --> 02:16:03,290
Now!

3735
02:16:03,290 --> 02:16:03,810
Now!

3736
02:16:03,890 --> 02:16:09,010
Now I understand why- why people were like, I can't believe it's-

3737
02:16:12,150 --> 02:16:15,550
We can bypass three chapters- more chapters.

3738
02:16:16,090 --> 02:16:16,990
Alright, guys.

3739
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:18,390
It's still open.

3740
02:16:19,330 --> 02:16:21,950
The session is still open, guys!

3741
02:16:24,190 --> 02:16:25,570
Time to set a battle plan.

3742
02:16:26,530 --> 02:16:27,330
You know what?

3743
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:28,470
Okay, kick off.

3744
02:16:28,670 --> 02:16:29,610
Okay, you know what?

3745
02:16:29,710 --> 02:16:32,710
I'm gonna- I don't need to be number one.

3746
02:16:32,990 --> 02:16:35,710
I don't need to be number one, chat.

3747
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:40,890
I am- I know I'm number one in my heart.

3748
02:16:40,950 --> 02:16:42,310
I- I know.

3749
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:43,890
I know.

3750
02:16:47,010 --> 02:16:47,450
Okay.

3751
02:16:49,570 --> 02:16:50,230
Let's see.

3752
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:51,470
Chapter three.

3753
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:54,910
I- I know I'm number one in my heart.

3754
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:55,590
Okay.

3755
02:16:57,590 --> 02:16:58,610
That's fine.

3756
02:16:59,050 --> 02:17:01,270
What is the avoid spoilers off?

3757
02:17:01,410 --> 02:17:01,750
Okay.

3758
02:17:01,850 --> 02:17:02,510
Join.

3759
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:05,670
There has to be one game out there.

3760
02:17:06,370 --> 02:17:08,330
That's on chapter three.

3761
02:17:08,470 --> 02:17:11,570
There has to be one game out there.

3762
02:17:13,790 --> 02:17:17,050
Where- where are we?

3763
02:17:17,210 --> 02:17:17,490
Okay.

3764
02:17:17,690 --> 02:17:18,310
Okay.

3765
02:17:21,630 --> 02:17:23,170
Where are we?

3766
02:17:23,330 --> 02:17:24,730
What is this stage?

3767
02:17:25,370 --> 02:17:25,990
Okay.

3768
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:26,610
Never mind.

3769
02:17:26,690 --> 02:17:27,110
I'm leaving.

3770
02:17:27,570 --> 02:17:28,190
Sorry.

3771
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:29,670
I- I don't understand.

3772
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:30,390
Okay.

3773
02:17:32,530 --> 02:17:34,290
Somewhere in chapter three.

3774
02:17:34,790 --> 02:17:38,310
I thought I joined in the middle of- Alright.

3775
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:38,890
Never mind.

3776
02:17:39,930 --> 02:17:40,830
Never mind.

3777
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:41,750
I'll be number one.

3778
02:17:43,110 --> 02:17:44,090
Never mind.

3779
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:46,090
I guess I'll be number one.

3780
02:17:46,130 --> 02:17:46,830
Let's go.

3781
02:17:46,830 --> 02:17:47,650
Alright.

3782
02:17:47,810 --> 02:17:48,910
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

3783
02:17:48,970 --> 02:17:49,830
I'll be right back, everybody.

3784
02:17:50,130 --> 02:17:51,590
We're gonna finish all the chapters.

3785
02:17:51,970 --> 02:17:52,850
I'll be right back.

3786
02:19:01,630 --> 02:19:02,070
Alright.

3787
02:19:02,090 --> 02:19:02,390
I'm back.

3788
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:03,610
Alright, guys.

3789
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:06,330
Guys, now I understand how this works.

3790
02:19:06,470 --> 02:19:09,130
Now I- Now I figured it out.

3791
02:19:10,250 --> 02:19:10,690
Evan!

3792
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:11,330
God!

3793
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:11,890
Mike!

3794
02:19:12,070 --> 02:19:13,090
Thank you for the super chat!

3795
02:19:13,150 --> 02:19:13,350
Thank you!

3796
02:19:13,490 --> 02:19:13,890
Thank you!

3797
02:19:14,090 --> 02:19:14,210
...

3798
02:19:14,210 --> 02:19:14,830
...

3799
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:24,010
Wait.

3800
02:19:24,650 --> 02:19:25,090
What?

3801
02:19:26,610 --> 02:19:27,330
Oh, okay.

3802
02:19:27,430 --> 02:19:28,070
I have to...

3803
02:19:28,730 --> 02:19:29,230
Oh, okay.

3804
02:19:29,350 --> 02:19:31,550
I have to pass- Well, I thought I already passed the test of strength.

3805
02:19:31,730 --> 02:19:32,270
What do you mean?

3806
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:34,230
I have to do it again?

3807
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:36,510
We already know I'm fucking strong!

3808
02:19:36,970 --> 02:19:40,230
Remember, these are designated OP moves that you can only use for a limited time.

3809
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:41,070
Choose carefully.

3810
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:44,370
I missed my- You're gonna actually face us this time, Marswalker?

3811
02:19:45,150 --> 02:19:47,210
There's no way you'll be able to get through the test of strength.

3812
02:19:48,050 --> 02:19:48,750
Oh, shit!

3813
02:19:48,890 --> 02:19:49,670
The napalm!

3814
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:50,990
Nice.

3815
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:52,410
We still have the napalm.

3816
02:19:52,750 --> 02:19:54,030
The napalm's so strong.

3817
02:19:54,790 --> 02:19:55,150
Alright.

3818
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:58,050
Moon jump- Oh, I just realized I never used my fucking boulder.

3819
02:19:58,050 --> 02:19:58,150
Oh, shit.

3820
02:19:58,950 --> 02:19:59,430
Um...

3821
02:19:59,970 --> 02:20:03,430
Become huge and body slam fools or do area damage.

3822
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:04,130
Oh, wait.

3823
02:20:04,170 --> 02:20:04,750
That's so good.

3824
02:20:06,550 --> 02:20:08,770
I forgot to use my bullshit cards.

3825
02:20:09,390 --> 02:20:09,870
Gigantism!

3826
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:10,250
Awesome!

3827
02:20:11,550 --> 02:20:13,230
And some cards to upgrade our magic.

3828
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:15,190
You think you can stop us with that?

3829
02:20:15,230 --> 02:20:15,710
Not a chance.

3830
02:20:16,590 --> 02:20:17,870
You aren't ready for this.

3831
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:19,610
March giants!

3832
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:21,070
Launched halflings!

3833
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:22,610
Launch?

3834
02:20:22,870 --> 02:20:25,130
Why do they still have so many cards?

3835
02:20:25,330 --> 02:20:27,250
It's not even hard mode anymore!

3836
02:20:27,250 --> 02:20:28,690
Hope you guys are happy with this.

3837
02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:30,210
They still have four cards!

3838
02:20:31,470 --> 02:20:31,950
Carmen!

3839
02:20:31,950 --> 02:20:34,990
Why aren't you making new rules to put us in their practice?

3840
02:20:35,390 --> 02:20:37,270
I can only stand in some tests or something to get that act.

3841
02:20:37,450 --> 02:20:38,410
This is still four cards!

3842
02:20:38,850 --> 02:20:39,890
That means you'll be at his power level.

3843
02:20:40,030 --> 02:20:41,610
Or at least immune to dysentery.

3844
02:20:41,610 --> 02:20:41,870
Alright.

3845
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:44,150
I need- Hey guys.

3846
02:20:44,390 --> 02:20:45,950
I need new kids to move over.

3847
02:20:49,030 --> 02:20:49,510
Wow!

3848
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:54,070
I guess everyone's here looking for supplies, huh?

3849
02:20:56,210 --> 02:21:00,930
I just want to- I didn't know everybody had the same amount of cards if I put normal mode.

3850
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:01,910
Now I know!

3851
02:21:02,110 --> 02:21:03,250
It doesn't matter!

3852
02:21:03,650 --> 02:21:05,250
It doesn't matter!

3853
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:08,870
It doesn't matter what fucking mode I'm on!

3854
02:21:09,010 --> 02:21:11,170
They'll always have more cards than me!

3855
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:12,230
This is the state that needed his test of strength.

3856
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:13,790
Go talk to his Uncle Jimbo.

3857
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:14,810
He can tell you what to do.

3858
02:21:14,830 --> 02:21:15,690
Okay, Uncle Jimbo.

3859
02:21:16,690 --> 02:21:21,130
Alright, I'm just gonna grab these fucking- Oh no.

3860
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:22,550
I'm gonna miss this app though.

3861
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:23,170
What's next?

3862
02:21:23,430 --> 02:21:25,050
No more ground flaxseed?

3863
02:21:25,190 --> 02:21:26,450
I gotta mill it myself?

3864
02:21:27,230 --> 02:21:29,170
What the fuck is ground flaxseeds?

3865
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:30,850
What the fuck is that?

3866
02:21:32,210 --> 02:21:32,850
Hey guys.

3867
02:21:50,910 --> 02:21:54,050
It's so weird seeing them have noses!

3868
02:21:54,450 --> 02:21:55,690
It's so weird!

3869
02:21:57,230 --> 02:21:57,830
Alright, your turn.

3870
02:22:03,490 --> 02:22:05,030
It's the gun store.

3871
02:22:05,370 --> 02:22:07,130
What do you mean with guns?

3872
02:22:07,930 --> 02:22:08,490
America.

3873
02:22:18,190 --> 02:22:20,870
It's so weird that they have fucking noses!

3874
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:25,470
Like, I understand it's 3D, but it's still- It's just- It's not right.

3875
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,870
It's not right!

3876
02:22:27,310 --> 02:22:27,790
It's not right!

3877
02:22:28,610 --> 02:22:29,150
That's me!

3878
02:22:32,950 --> 02:22:34,510
I have the funny hat!

3879
02:22:35,150 --> 02:22:37,410
Okay, I need to fucking get pissed off right now.

3880
02:22:37,610 --> 02:22:38,910
Alright, get over here.

3881
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:40,470
I'm gonna burn you.

3882
02:22:42,610 --> 02:22:43,670
It's not the same.

3883
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,690
It's not the same.

3884
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:47,890
It's not like the electricity.

3885
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:49,930
But it's okay.

3886
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:52,250
I gotta work with what I have.

3887
02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:53,790
Which is napalm.

3888
02:22:57,430 --> 02:22:58,950
I have more shield.

3889
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:00,890
That's right, unlimited shield!

3890
02:23:02,750 --> 02:23:04,930
Unlimited shield if I'm always angry!

3891
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:07,270
Wait, I can just literally skip all these people.

3892
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:07,590
Goodbye.

3893
02:23:10,550 --> 02:23:11,110
Goodbye.

3894
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:13,150
It's speedrun time!

3895
02:23:13,810 --> 02:23:16,830
Oh my god, I'm blinded by what?

3896
02:23:19,910 --> 02:23:20,510
Oh!

3897
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:22,590
Guys, I realized why.

3898
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:28,150
Now I realize why I need... I can't just...

3899
02:23:28,150 --> 02:23:31,070
Now I realize why I can't just carry everything.

3900
02:23:31,410 --> 02:23:32,830
Oh my god, what the fuck is hitting me?

3901
02:23:33,530 --> 02:23:34,130
Okay.

3902
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:35,310
There you go.

3903
02:23:35,650 --> 02:23:36,450
There you go.

3904
02:23:37,070 --> 02:23:38,090
Don't worry guys!

3905
02:23:38,290 --> 02:23:39,590
Protect the leader!

3906
02:23:39,690 --> 02:23:40,630
Protect number one!

3907
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:43,030
The real new kid!

3908
02:23:43,870 --> 02:23:44,770
Protect me!

3909
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:45,950
Oh!

3910
02:23:46,090 --> 02:23:46,690
Oh!

3911
02:23:48,430 --> 02:23:49,110
Oh!

3912
02:23:52,310 --> 02:23:52,990
Please!

3913
02:23:52,990 --> 02:23:53,670
Okay.

3914
02:23:53,990 --> 02:23:54,670
Alright.

3915
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:55,730
Let's be fine.

3916
02:23:55,810 --> 02:23:56,030
We're fine.

3917
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:56,390
We're fine.

3918
02:23:57,230 --> 02:23:58,450
Oh shit!

3919
02:23:58,510 --> 02:23:59,430
Who keeps hitting me?

3920
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:01,890
They're children!

3921
02:24:02,270 --> 02:24:03,990
It should be like a fucking...

3922
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:04,570
Hulk!

3923
02:24:07,750 --> 02:24:09,250
Protect the ghoul!

3924
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:12,590
Protect the ghoul!

3925
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:16,390
It's okay!

3926
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:19,190
It's just a flesh wound!

3927
02:24:19,770 --> 02:24:22,030
Oh, those are not my teammates!

3928
02:24:22,790 --> 02:24:24,030
It's okay, body blocked.

3929
02:24:25,030 --> 02:24:26,070
I got it.

3930
02:24:26,170 --> 02:24:26,810
It's alright.

3931
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:29,030
It doesn't hurt me!

3932
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:32,810
That's creamy as hell.

3933
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:33,230
Get out.

3934
02:24:33,370 --> 02:24:34,330
Nice work, kid.

3935
02:24:34,510 --> 02:24:38,030
Yeah, here's the next thing I need to... Yes, but he's a tinier child!

3936
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:41,010
My power level should be bigger!

3937
02:24:43,510 --> 02:24:46,050
I should have a higher power level!

3938
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:46,810
They're actual...

3939
02:24:46,810 --> 02:24:47,270
Actual kids!

3940
02:24:50,730 --> 02:24:52,050
Alright, here we go.

3941
02:24:52,730 --> 02:24:55,570
We're gonna fucking heal up before we go in.

3942
02:24:55,710 --> 02:24:57,570
Grab barrel of NFTs?

3943
02:24:58,030 --> 02:24:58,050
What?

3944
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:00,850
Bro...

3945
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:03,490
Not the NFTs.

3946
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:06,310
Is that still fucking relevant?

3947
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:10,010
I thought NFTs are dead!

3948
02:25:10,690 --> 02:25:11,410
What was it?

3949
02:25:11,410 --> 02:25:12,170
The fucking...

3950
02:25:12,890 --> 02:25:13,490
Um...

3951
02:25:13,490 --> 02:25:14,650
Bored ape shit?

3952
02:25:14,650 --> 02:25:16,350
Did you guys hear, like...

3953
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:17,310
Who was it?

3954
02:25:17,330 --> 02:25:24,010
There was a celebrity that recently sold their bored ape and lost, like, $200,000 or some shit.

3955
02:25:24,110 --> 02:25:25,450
Oh my god!

3956
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:26,730
I need people.

3957
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:28,890
I need people here right now.

3958
02:25:33,070 --> 02:25:34,970
There's, like... Oh, was it Kevin Hart?

3959
02:25:35,090 --> 02:25:35,270
Yeah!

3960
02:25:35,910 --> 02:25:39,350
Apparently, Kevin Hart lost, like, 200k.

3961
02:25:40,050 --> 02:25:41,650
He, like, sold... Oh, not 200k!

3962
02:25:41,710 --> 02:25:43,550
Like, $140,000?

3963
02:25:43,550 --> 02:25:47,390
Because he bought an NFT for, uh...

3964
02:25:47,390 --> 02:25:54,070
He bought an NFT for, like, uh... 200k and then sold it for, like, 60k or something.

3965
02:25:55,350 --> 02:25:57,790
Like, sold his bored ape for 60k.

3966
02:25:58,010 --> 02:26:01,150
Cause, like, nobody cares about NFTs anymore.

3967
02:26:01,470 --> 02:26:02,070
Like...

3968
02:26:02,070 --> 02:26:07,510
Or, like, nobody in NA cares about NFTs anymore cause the fucking thing crashed.

3969
02:26:09,330 --> 02:26:12,290
Poor, like... Poor, like... Seth Green.

3970
02:26:12,290 --> 02:26:13,690
If he...

3971
02:26:15,690 --> 02:26:21,950
Seth Green and the fucking cartoon that he wanted to make but he couldn't because a hacker stole his NFT.

3972
02:26:22,470 --> 02:26:23,350
Oh god.

3973
02:26:23,550 --> 02:26:24,370
Oh god.

3974
02:26:24,530 --> 02:26:25,730
Oh, I'm so angry.

3975
02:26:25,890 --> 02:26:26,970
I'm so angry!

3976
02:26:27,130 --> 02:26:27,330
No!

3977
02:26:30,930 --> 02:26:31,530
No!

3978
02:26:31,530 --> 02:26:32,450
Number two!

3979
02:26:33,570 --> 02:26:35,950
My real dragon, Resmi!

3980
02:26:38,010 --> 02:26:39,570
My very real dragon!

3981
02:26:44,070 --> 02:26:44,570
I'm gonna get rezzed.

3982
02:26:44,570 --> 02:26:44,770
It's okay.

3983
02:26:45,190 --> 02:26:46,530
I'm gonna get rezzed.

3984
02:26:46,570 --> 02:26:47,370
I know you can.

3985
02:26:47,470 --> 02:26:49,270
I know you're programmed to rezz.

3986
02:26:49,450 --> 02:26:49,790
Nice.

3987
02:26:49,830 --> 02:26:50,030
Okay.

3988
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:51,050
We're good.

3989
02:26:51,530 --> 02:26:52,150
We're good.

3990
02:26:53,450 --> 02:26:55,330
We got the heals too.

3991
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:57,170
We got the heals too.

3992
02:26:58,410 --> 02:26:58,910
Okay.

3993
02:26:59,890 --> 02:27:00,710
Oh god.

3994
02:27:01,590 --> 02:27:02,090
Oh...

3995
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:05,030
I'm trying my best to speedrun!

3996
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:06,870
It's okay!

3997
02:27:08,730 --> 02:27:09,530
We're okay!

3998
02:27:09,630 --> 02:27:11,030
We can outrun this!

3999
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:13,570
But yeah.

4000
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:16,830
The reason why, like... Jesus Christ.

4001
02:27:16,950 --> 02:27:17,730
Oh no.

4002
02:27:18,050 --> 02:27:18,690
No.

4003
02:27:18,770 --> 02:27:20,770
I can't outrun this!

4004
02:27:21,130 --> 02:27:21,670
Oh!

4005
02:27:22,430 --> 02:27:24,670
The tiny kid is too strong!

4006
02:27:27,650 --> 02:27:28,290
Alright.

4007
02:27:28,470 --> 02:27:29,150
We're good.

4008
02:27:29,210 --> 02:27:29,610
We're okay.

4009
02:27:29,850 --> 02:27:31,630
Where the fuck is the fireworks guy?

4010
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:34,630
Who the fuck?

4011
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:37,910
How did he fucking, like, slomp me?

4012
02:27:38,470 --> 02:27:39,310
Oh god.

4013
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:40,790
That is like a fucking...

4014
02:27:44,090 --> 02:27:46,330
That's like a word from the past.

4015
02:27:48,690 --> 02:27:49,250
Okay.

4016
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:49,550
Here.

4017
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:50,030
We're good.

4018
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,890
We're good.

4019
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:52,690
We don't have to...

4020
02:27:52,690 --> 02:27:54,730
We don't have to worry about the...

4021
02:27:54,730 --> 02:27:55,430
But yeah!

4022
02:27:55,790 --> 02:27:57,590
For those who don't know...

4023
02:27:57,590 --> 02:27:59,810
Seth Green bought...

4024
02:27:59,810 --> 02:28:00,530
Oh god.

4025
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:01,690
Not these guys.

4026
02:28:01,970 --> 02:28:05,730
Seth Green fucking tried to make an NFT animated.

4027
02:28:06,530 --> 02:28:08,950
Half animated, half like...

4028
02:28:08,950 --> 02:28:10,250
Oh come on.

4029
02:28:10,270 --> 02:28:11,010
Get the fuck away.

4030
02:28:11,010 --> 02:28:11,690
Get away from me.

4031
02:28:11,990 --> 02:28:12,490
Okay.

4032
02:28:12,590 --> 02:28:12,890
Oh no!

4033
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:17,170
Half animated, half live action show about NFTs.

4034
02:28:17,550 --> 02:28:20,710
And then the main character is one of his NFTs.

4035
02:28:20,910 --> 02:28:23,210
And then his NFT account got hacked.

4036
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:27,250
And then they blackmailed him.

4037
02:28:27,330 --> 02:28:28,670
Because they knew he was making a show.

4038
02:28:29,010 --> 02:28:31,270
And so he couldn't get his NFT back.

4039
02:28:31,890 --> 02:28:32,390
Wait.

4040
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:32,630
No.

4041
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:34,730
He paid like triple... double the price.

4042
02:28:34,890 --> 02:28:35,390
Again.

4043
02:28:36,190 --> 02:28:38,310
To have his board 8 back.

4044
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:39,810
So he could have his show.

4045
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:41,890
I have a little thing I need you to find.

4046
02:28:42,210 --> 02:28:43,990
You know what a chin Pokemon is?

4047
02:28:44,170 --> 02:28:44,890
Me neither.

4048
02:28:45,070 --> 02:28:46,930
But people will pay good toilet paper for it.

4049
02:28:46,950 --> 02:28:46,970
Come get me one.

4050
02:28:46,970 --> 02:28:46,970
Oh.

4051
02:28:47,050 --> 02:28:47,910
I got chin Pokemon.

4052
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:51,490
No.

4053
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:53,030
I saw the trailer for that show.

4054
02:28:53,130 --> 02:28:54,110
And it's fucking terrible.

4055
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:55,070
It's so bad.

4056
02:28:56,590 --> 02:28:59,270
It's actually so fucking bad.

4057
02:29:00,490 --> 02:29:01,050
Don't worry.

4058
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:02,070
It's okay.

4059
02:29:02,470 --> 02:29:03,650
They don't know I'm here.

4060
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:06,290
They don't know I'm a child.

4061
02:29:06,750 --> 02:29:07,190
Alright.

4062
02:29:07,210 --> 02:29:07,530
Here we go.

4063
02:29:08,750 --> 02:29:09,330
I mean.

4064
02:29:09,370 --> 02:29:09,550
Yeah.

4065
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:18,270
Oh, man, the Bored Ape fucking- OH GUYS, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE FUCKING BORED APE CONVENTION THAT ENDED UP MAKING PEOPLE FUCKING HALF- LIKE BLIND?

4066
02:29:18,830 --> 02:29:20,590
The Bored Ape event?

4067
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:23,010
That shit was crazy!

4068
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:29,930
That shit was actually fucking insane, cause they used like, some like, light or whatever?

4069
02:29:32,170 --> 02:29:38,730
Okay, so Bored Ape had like a fucking event, and they used like, some blacklight or whatever?

4070
02:29:39,190 --> 02:29:40,650
To like, make it cool?

4071
02:29:40,930 --> 02:29:49,970
But then they ended up- they bought like the most expensive blacklight that was used to kill pe- like, what was it that was like, radiated- radiation or whatever?

4072
02:29:50,130 --> 02:29:51,110
They used UV lights, sorry.

4073
02:29:51,230 --> 02:29:52,510
UV lights and stuff.

4074
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:59,670
No, wasn't it like, expensive UV lights that ended up being like, uh- oh, they're cheap?

4075
02:30:05,950 --> 02:30:15,850
They bought like, industrial UV lights that ended up like, fucking, um, causing blindness.

4076
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:17,790
That was actually so fucked up.

4077
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:18,910
Oh no, the sixth graders.

4078
02:30:19,110 --> 02:30:21,170
Oh no, not the sixth graders.

4079
02:30:22,610 --> 02:30:28,630
It was supposed to be used to disinfect things, but they ended up using it for like, a fucking party.

4080
02:30:28,870 --> 02:30:29,910
Like an actual party.

4081
02:30:29,930 --> 02:30:33,770
Like an actual dance event, which was like, absolutely insane.

4082
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:37,170
That that was a thing.

4083
02:30:38,710 --> 02:30:39,390
No!

4084
02:30:41,550 --> 02:30:44,190
Yeah, it was used for a fucking concert.

4085
02:30:45,430 --> 02:30:49,070
It literally like, caused blindness the next day.

4086
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:52,290
That's actually insane.

4087
02:30:55,810 --> 02:30:56,850
Alright, here we go.

4088
02:30:57,590 --> 02:30:59,370
Real Dragoon, res me!

4089
02:31:00,630 --> 02:31:01,970
Very real Dragoon.

4090
02:31:02,050 --> 02:31:02,870
Where's number four?

4091
02:31:03,190 --> 02:31:04,910
What the f- is number four stuck?

4092
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:06,210
Okay, there we go.

4093
02:31:09,570 --> 02:31:10,550
Alright, it's okay.

4094
02:31:10,730 --> 02:31:12,510
My very real Dragoons are helping me.

4095
02:31:12,730 --> 02:31:13,790
Did you just hit me?

4096
02:31:14,530 --> 02:31:16,230
My very real Dragoons.

4097
02:31:16,250 --> 02:31:16,650
Res me!

4098
02:31:18,270 --> 02:31:19,730
Don't worry, Naina.

4099
02:31:20,030 --> 02:31:21,730
It's actually crazy.

4100
02:31:22,910 --> 02:31:26,210
Wait, I know like, the market in NA has actually crashed.

4101
02:31:26,690 --> 02:31:27,810
You'll pay for that!

4102
02:31:27,810 --> 02:31:29,170
But I don't know if like...

4103
02:31:29,890 --> 02:31:32,850
If like, other areas, if it's still like, survive.

4104
02:31:33,230 --> 02:31:34,610
If it's still surviving.

4105
02:31:35,830 --> 02:31:37,530
Oh yeah, and skin burns too.

4106
02:31:37,610 --> 02:31:38,810
That is actually insane.

4107
02:31:39,590 --> 02:31:41,830
It's actually insane that that...

4108
02:31:41,830 --> 02:31:42,870
That that's real.

4109
02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:44,690
That that actually happened.

4110
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:45,990
Oh no.

4111
02:31:46,310 --> 02:31:47,170
Oh no.

4112
02:31:47,370 --> 02:31:48,350
Not my chin Pokemon.

4113
02:31:50,950 --> 02:31:51,970
Chin Pokemon!

4114
02:31:53,890 --> 02:31:56,530
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

4115
02:31:56,530 --> 02:31:56,970
Yeah.

4116
02:32:01,070 --> 02:32:03,390
What the f- am I gonna use the Porta Potty for?

4117
02:32:03,630 --> 02:32:04,810
Oh, Mr. Hanky?

4118
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:06,430
Alright.

4119
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:13,740
Mr. Hanky?

4120
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:22,910
I feel...

4121
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:25,310
I feel violated there.

4122
02:32:25,610 --> 02:32:26,490
What the f-?

4123
02:32:27,390 --> 02:32:28,370
What the f-?

4124
02:32:28,730 --> 02:32:30,030
What the f- happened?

4125
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:32,010
Oh my god.

4126
02:32:33,690 --> 02:32:36,090
Holy shit, what the f- happened?

4127
02:32:36,390 --> 02:32:37,270
There got Venom?

4128
02:32:39,230 --> 02:32:40,450
Oh my god.

4129
02:32:41,130 --> 02:32:42,750
I think I got Venom there.

4130
02:32:44,970 --> 02:32:47,270
I guess I'm immune to dysentery now?

4131
02:32:50,250 --> 02:32:50,770
Uh...

4132
02:32:50,770 --> 02:32:52,950
Dagger dive does more.

4133
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:54,070
Okay.

4134
02:32:54,410 --> 02:32:56,770
The wand drops a Molotov that deals...

4135
02:32:56,770 --> 02:32:58,870
Okay, I feel like I just used my wand.

4136
02:32:58,950 --> 02:33:00,170
I'm just gonna get the Molotov.

4137
02:33:01,450 --> 02:33:02,250
Good luck out there.

4138
02:33:02,390 --> 02:33:04,390
Good luck out there.

4139
02:33:04,390 --> 02:33:04,670
Nice.

4140
02:33:05,810 --> 02:33:05,850
Nice.

4141
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:07,310
Nice.

4142
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:08,090
Uh...

4143
02:33:08,750 --> 02:33:09,190
Uh...

4144
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:09,690
Rapto!

4145
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:10,690
Thank you for the super chat!

4146
02:33:10,750 --> 02:33:10,990
Thank you!

4147
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:11,450
Thank you!

4148
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:17,430
Are you wanting to replay the other South Park RPGs?

4149
02:33:17,430 --> 02:33:20,090
I will play Fractured but whole one day.

4150
02:33:20,470 --> 02:33:21,690
But I'm not sure when.

4151
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:23,350
I'm just trying to figure out like...

4152
02:33:23,350 --> 02:33:25,770
If I should stream that on YouTube.

4153
02:33:31,910 --> 02:33:37,010
I played 100% stick of truth and I know the shit that's in there.

4154
02:33:37,130 --> 02:33:38,370
So I'm just like, I don't know.

4155
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:49,270
Yeah, if it works it works.

4156
02:33:49,710 --> 02:33:51,950
Just a little flat fire, you know.

4157
02:33:57,610 --> 02:33:59,190
I'm heading over!

4158
02:34:00,930 --> 02:34:01,750
Don't worry!

4159
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:02,750
Oh!

4160
02:34:03,710 --> 02:34:04,270
No!

4161
02:34:05,030 --> 02:34:05,410
No!

4162
02:34:06,970 --> 02:34:08,210
They can't get me!

4163
02:34:08,370 --> 02:34:10,050
I have the shield!

4164
02:34:12,910 --> 02:34:14,630
My real dragons!

4165
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:15,670
Protect!

4166
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:16,250
No!

4167
02:34:16,430 --> 02:34:18,990
I lost the fire because I went into the snow.

4168
02:34:19,210 --> 02:34:19,770
Who would have thought?

4169
02:34:20,250 --> 02:34:21,390
Who would have thought?

4170
02:34:22,130 --> 02:34:25,750
If you go into the snow, you lose.

4171
02:34:25,770 --> 02:34:27,030
You just stop burning.

4172
02:34:27,870 --> 02:34:30,150
Who would have thought that could happen?

4173
02:34:30,290 --> 02:34:31,370
Did I freeze to death?

4174
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:35,450
You can't keep running into arrows and stay alive.

4175
02:34:35,490 --> 02:34:36,270
I'm trying!

4176
02:34:39,530 --> 02:34:44,210
Guys, you don't just run into like 20 people and expect to live.

4177
02:34:44,430 --> 02:34:44,990
Guys.

4178
02:34:46,110 --> 02:34:48,210
A little pro tip for everybody.

4179
02:34:48,670 --> 02:34:49,630
A little pro tip.

4180
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:53,490
Don't just run into everything expecting you to live.

4181
02:34:53,950 --> 02:34:54,650
Alright, nice.

4182
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:55,650
Oh, god.

4183
02:34:55,770 --> 02:34:56,170
Please.

4184
02:34:56,850 --> 02:34:59,230
I really need heals right now.

4185
02:34:59,390 --> 02:35:00,110
No!

4186
02:35:02,690 --> 02:35:05,430
These guys fucking suck!

4187
02:35:06,410 --> 02:35:08,330
Fucking... what is the power skill?

4188
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:10,090
Nerf him!

4189
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:11,310
Nerf him!

4190
02:35:14,290 --> 02:35:15,730
Nerf this man!

4191
02:35:17,010 --> 02:35:17,910
Oh, god.

4192
02:35:17,950 --> 02:35:18,970
I'm not angry enough.

4193
02:35:19,550 --> 02:35:21,090
I need to be angrier.

4194
02:35:21,950 --> 02:35:22,670
Okay.

4195
02:35:22,910 --> 02:35:24,150
I need to be angrier.

4196
02:35:25,030 --> 02:35:25,750
Oh, god.

4197
02:35:25,770 --> 02:35:26,470
Oh, my god.

4198
02:35:26,510 --> 02:35:27,370
I need a shield too.

4199
02:35:28,010 --> 02:35:29,090
Oh, please!

4200
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:30,210
Be angry!

4201
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:33,050
Be angry, new kid!

4202
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:36,230
Alright.

4203
02:35:36,710 --> 02:35:38,610
I think we're angry enough now.

4204
02:35:38,750 --> 02:35:40,030
We have to be angry.

4205
02:35:40,130 --> 02:35:41,590
What the fuck is freezing me?

4206
02:35:41,730 --> 02:35:43,070
Oh, it's the snow!

4207
02:35:44,230 --> 02:35:46,670
It's the snow that's still making me angry.

4208
02:35:47,150 --> 02:35:49,330
I'm calling for balance changes.

4209
02:35:50,610 --> 02:35:51,170
Devs!

4210
02:35:53,050 --> 02:35:53,610
Devs!

4211
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:55,090
I need to balance this game!

4212
02:35:57,010 --> 02:35:57,970
Oh, god.

4213
02:35:58,130 --> 02:35:59,370
Okay, I need to get rid of...

4214
02:36:00,390 --> 02:36:04,250
I need to get rid of the fucking fireworks if I want to head anywhere.

4215
02:36:04,970 --> 02:36:06,130
Alright, we should be good.

4216
02:36:06,830 --> 02:36:08,130
We should be good now.

4217
02:36:10,050 --> 02:36:11,010
Where do we go?

4218
02:36:13,030 --> 02:36:13,510
Okay.

4219
02:36:13,630 --> 02:36:15,390
I'm gonna burn myself here.

4220
02:36:15,990 --> 02:36:18,570
But like, how do I get up top?

4221
02:36:18,830 --> 02:36:19,590
That's what I do...

4222
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:19,830
No!

4223
02:36:21,210 --> 02:36:21,690
Fuck!

4224
02:36:21,770 --> 02:36:22,870
I cooled myself down!

4225
02:36:24,130 --> 02:36:24,810
Okay.

4226
02:36:24,950 --> 02:36:26,050
No stamina again.

4227
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:28,690
Which way do I go?

4228
02:36:28,870 --> 02:36:30,070
I'm so confused.

4229
02:36:31,150 --> 02:36:32,170
Up top.

4230
02:36:32,450 --> 02:36:33,350
Here we go.

4231
02:36:34,030 --> 02:36:34,710
Climb.

4232
02:36:34,910 --> 02:36:35,590
Climb.

4233
02:36:36,590 --> 02:36:37,270
No!

4234
02:36:38,030 --> 02:36:39,710
Come on, come on!

4235
02:36:40,090 --> 02:36:41,190
Where's the thing?

4236
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:43,830
Why did me push it down?

4237
02:36:46,390 --> 02:36:47,070
Supersize.

4238
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:48,930
Oh, no.

4239
02:36:50,130 --> 02:36:50,810
Alright.

4240
02:36:51,590 --> 02:36:52,270
Okay.

4241
02:36:52,910 --> 02:36:54,310
Apparently there was a ledge.

4242
02:36:55,770 --> 02:36:56,910
Apparently... Where am I?

4243
02:36:57,410 --> 02:36:59,130
Oh, hey, there's Jimmy right here.

4244
02:37:01,450 --> 02:37:02,850
Jimmy right here.

4245
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:04,330
Alright, let's just heal.

4246
02:37:04,390 --> 02:37:07,030
I'm gonna stay over here and heal a little bit.

4247
02:37:07,530 --> 02:37:08,370
Let's just...

4248
02:37:08,370 --> 02:37:10,070
Let's just chill down.

4249
02:37:10,290 --> 02:37:11,430
Chill a little bit here.

4250
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:12,270
Alright.

4251
02:37:13,490 --> 02:37:14,790
We're gonna figure this out.

4252
02:37:15,290 --> 02:37:16,430
I'm not that stupid.

4253
02:37:17,890 --> 02:37:18,810
There's a ledge.

4254
02:37:19,550 --> 02:37:20,050
Okay.

4255
02:37:21,130 --> 02:37:22,510
There's a ledge right here.

4256
02:37:23,170 --> 02:37:24,730
We can climb this ledge.

4257
02:37:24,970 --> 02:37:26,770
Maybe you'll learn something from the more experienced new kids.

4258
02:37:27,990 --> 02:37:28,510
Where...

4259
02:37:28,510 --> 02:37:30,270
What is that supposed to mean?

4260
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:31,290
Cartman.

4261
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:33,970
What is that supposed to mean?

4262
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:36,110
I'm not on fire again?

4263
02:37:38,050 --> 02:37:39,290
Where do I climb?

4264
02:37:39,790 --> 02:37:40,610
Mr. Man!

4265
02:37:45,170 --> 02:37:46,830
What do I do?

4266
02:37:50,390 --> 02:37:52,210
What do I do?

4267
02:37:53,270 --> 02:37:54,170
What do I do?

4268
02:37:54,170 --> 02:37:55,930
I'm still burning.

4269
02:38:00,230 --> 02:38:00,850
Oh!

4270
02:38:01,150 --> 02:38:02,030
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4271
02:38:02,450 --> 02:38:03,690
Wait, wait, wait, I burned.

4272
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:05,730
Wait, this counts!

4273
02:38:07,330 --> 02:38:08,130
Oh god.

4274
02:38:09,310 --> 02:38:09,930
Yes!

4275
02:38:10,150 --> 02:38:11,510
Oh, I hit... No!

4276
02:38:12,930 --> 02:38:13,550
What?!

4277
02:38:14,590 --> 02:38:16,550
It still doesn't count?

4278
02:38:17,130 --> 02:38:17,750
Okay.

4279
02:38:19,530 --> 02:38:20,950
My shield could blow up.

4280
02:38:21,370 --> 02:38:24,390
What do you mean it climbed on top of it?

4281
02:38:24,930 --> 02:38:25,450
Alright.

4282
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:28,590
Okay, we gotta figure this out, guys.

4283
02:38:28,750 --> 02:38:29,410
That must hurt.

4284
02:38:29,450 --> 02:38:31,190
We gotta figure this out.

4285
02:38:33,150 --> 02:38:34,190
My speedrun!

4286
02:38:35,730 --> 02:38:36,250
Guys!

4287
02:38:36,550 --> 02:38:38,670
What about my speedrun?

4288
02:38:39,170 --> 02:38:39,350
I...

4289
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:41,310
Okay.

4290
02:38:41,910 --> 02:38:42,730
This is it.

4291
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:44,670
I can climb up.

4292
02:38:45,410 --> 02:38:46,310
Where do I go?

4293
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:47,670
Alright.

4294
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:49,750
We got another one.

4295
02:38:49,970 --> 02:38:51,290
We got another barrel.

4296
02:38:52,750 --> 02:38:53,970
I'm almost there!

4297
02:38:56,230 --> 02:38:56,790
Please!

4298
02:38:56,830 --> 02:38:57,310
No!

4299
02:38:58,970 --> 02:39:01,470
Oh my god, I'm getting bullshit so hard.

4300
02:39:02,090 --> 02:39:02,630
This is it!

4301
02:39:04,070 --> 02:39:05,650
I'm ready to bullshit!

4302
02:39:07,070 --> 02:39:07,330
Oh!

4303
02:39:10,810 --> 02:39:11,830
Doki slam!

4304
02:39:13,210 --> 02:39:14,130
Alright, nice.

4305
02:39:14,670 --> 02:39:15,030
We got it.

4306
02:39:17,450 --> 02:39:19,270
Doki is ready to slam!

4307
02:39:19,870 --> 02:39:22,510
Okay, we need to like get more of the fire though.

4308
02:39:23,670 --> 02:39:24,190
Alright.

4309
02:39:24,350 --> 02:39:24,850
Nice.

4310
02:39:24,930 --> 02:39:25,150
Alright.

4311
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:26,270
Get away.

4312
02:39:26,450 --> 02:39:26,890
Get away.

4313
02:39:27,510 --> 02:39:28,710
Doki is slamming.

4314
02:39:29,730 --> 02:39:31,210
Doki is slamming!

4315
02:39:31,810 --> 02:39:33,610
I just need to get there faster!

4316
02:39:34,710 --> 02:39:35,230
Okay.

4317
02:39:35,230 --> 02:39:36,090
Another one.

4318
02:39:37,290 --> 02:39:37,810
Alright.

4319
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:40,510
No!

4320
02:39:41,490 --> 02:39:41,990
No!

4321
02:39:41,990 --> 02:39:43,690
It's literally right there!

4322
02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:45,170
Don't let me die!

4323
02:39:45,490 --> 02:39:46,050
Yes!

4324
02:39:47,290 --> 02:39:49,310
Okay, we're gonna heal right here though.

4325
02:39:50,350 --> 02:39:50,910
Alright.

4326
02:39:50,910 --> 02:39:51,470
Nice.

4327
02:39:52,050 --> 02:39:52,830
It's okay.

4328
02:39:53,310 --> 02:39:55,650
My entire team can kill everybody else.

4329
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:59,670
We have two more!

4330
02:40:00,110 --> 02:40:00,670
We have two more!

4331
02:40:02,050 --> 02:40:02,610
Alright.

4332
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:03,890
We gotta go this way.

4333
02:40:04,570 --> 02:40:05,270
Don't worry.

4334
02:40:05,310 --> 02:40:06,310
The speedrun is still there!

4335
02:40:07,410 --> 02:40:09,530
The speedrun is still possible!

4336
02:40:09,950 --> 02:40:11,850
The speedrun is still possible!

4337
02:40:12,690 --> 02:40:13,210
Woo!

4338
02:40:14,110 --> 02:40:15,890
Okay, we gotta get rid of this guy though.

4339
02:40:16,050 --> 02:40:18,490
The fucking ice shit is actually pissing me off.

4340
02:40:19,330 --> 02:40:20,230
Doki angry.

4341
02:40:21,850 --> 02:40:23,270
Doki angry now!

4342
02:40:24,890 --> 02:40:25,410
Doki angry now!

4343
02:40:25,410 --> 02:40:25,710
Get out!

4344
02:40:26,530 --> 02:40:27,930
Get out, women!

4345
02:40:28,590 --> 02:40:29,370
Shielded women!

4346
02:40:29,710 --> 02:40:30,250
Get out!

4347
02:40:30,550 --> 02:40:34,010
This is a boys only treehouse!

4348
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:35,630
Okay.

4349
02:40:35,790 --> 02:40:36,070
Nice.

4350
02:40:37,770 --> 02:40:38,290
Okay.

4351
02:40:38,390 --> 02:40:39,410
Where the fuck do I go?

4352
02:40:39,490 --> 02:40:39,830
Oh god.

4353
02:40:40,670 --> 02:40:41,190
No!

4354
02:40:41,310 --> 02:40:41,770
My fire!

4355
02:40:41,850 --> 02:40:42,410
Ouch!

4356
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:44,150
Alright.

4357
02:40:44,770 --> 02:40:45,330
Nice.

4358
02:40:45,670 --> 02:40:47,050
Gotta get rid of these two.

4359
02:40:49,230 --> 02:40:49,790
Nice.

4360
02:40:50,130 --> 02:40:51,490
Let's get her getting cooties!

4361
02:40:53,030 --> 02:40:54,010
And then...

4362
02:40:54,010 --> 02:40:55,330
We're gonna press this.

4363
02:40:56,530 --> 02:40:57,590
And then...

4364
02:40:58,230 --> 02:40:59,570
Catapult us above.

4365
02:41:00,690 --> 02:41:01,810
And then...

4366
02:41:01,810 --> 02:41:02,910
Thank Christ!

4367
02:41:02,970 --> 02:41:03,350
One more to the next!

4368
02:41:03,350 --> 02:41:03,350
Oh god!

4369
02:41:03,450 --> 02:41:03,990
Thank god!

4370
02:41:04,390 --> 02:41:04,950
Alright.

4371
02:41:07,370 --> 02:41:07,930
Burn.

4372
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:09,030
Burn children.

4373
02:41:09,250 --> 02:41:09,510
Burn.

4374
02:41:09,650 --> 02:41:10,510
But pretend burn.

4375
02:41:10,690 --> 02:41:11,150
Oh no!

4376
02:41:11,850 --> 02:41:12,770
There's six graders!

4377
02:41:13,670 --> 02:41:14,290
Oh!

4378
02:41:15,850 --> 02:41:16,950
Oh my god!

4379
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:23,130
The reason why all these cartoon shows they never like get...

4380
02:41:23,130 --> 02:41:24,990
They never get...

4381
02:41:24,990 --> 02:41:33,870
They never age up or go to the next grade is because they want to always have continuity so that people can...

4382
02:41:33,870 --> 02:41:34,470
What's the word?

4383
02:41:36,170 --> 02:41:36,790
Syndication?

4384
02:41:37,050 --> 02:41:37,450
Oh yeah!

4385
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:39,750
So they can always run reruns all the time.

4386
02:41:40,190 --> 02:41:42,890
That's the only reason why people never grow up.

4387
02:41:42,970 --> 02:41:43,810
It's actually...

4388
02:41:43,810 --> 02:41:44,910
I confirm the test has been completed.

4389
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:45,950
You've done well.

4390
02:41:46,130 --> 02:41:47,310
Head to the chamber of...

4391
02:41:47,310 --> 02:41:48,590
It's actually fucked up.

4392
02:41:48,810 --> 02:41:50,050
He made support party new kid.

4393
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:50,910
Great job, Essie!

4394
02:41:52,910 --> 02:41:56,370
The network just wants to be able to run reruns all the time.

4395
02:41:56,450 --> 02:42:04,490
It's also why like a lot of characters don't go through character development because if they go through character development, running reruns don't make sense.

4396
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:06,270
Oh!

4397
02:42:06,270 --> 02:42:06,710
Whoa!

4398
02:42:08,070 --> 02:42:08,510
Whoa!

4399
02:42:08,510 --> 02:42:11,130
And I watched it!

4400
02:42:14,710 --> 02:42:16,670
And I watched it happen.

4401
02:42:17,250 --> 02:42:17,730
And I watched it happen.

4402
02:42:17,730 --> 02:42:17,830
And I watched it happen.

4403
02:42:19,430 --> 02:42:19,970
And I watched it happen.

4404
02:42:19,970 --> 02:42:20,730
Alright, let's see.

4405
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:22,850
Common, uncommon.

4406
02:42:23,110 --> 02:42:23,790
I'm gonna reshuffle.

4407
02:42:25,890 --> 02:42:27,170
I'm gonna reshuffle.

4408
02:42:27,310 --> 02:42:28,990
I need something that has to do with the wand.

4409
02:42:29,630 --> 02:42:30,610
I don't like the dagger.

4410
02:42:31,130 --> 02:42:32,050
Or the bubble.

4411
02:42:32,230 --> 02:42:33,450
Oh, the bubble is so good!

4412
02:42:33,810 --> 02:42:36,550
Yeah, this one's really good.

4413
02:42:36,930 --> 02:42:37,570
See ya!

4414
02:42:38,510 --> 02:42:40,250
Did you know dragons don't eat paladins?

4415
02:42:40,430 --> 02:42:41,610
Apparently they taste awful.

4416
02:42:42,890 --> 02:42:44,590
Okay, that one was good, Jimmy.

4417
02:42:47,770 --> 02:42:49,690
Will I ever have more than one friend?

4418
02:42:50,870 --> 02:42:51,750
You did it!

4419
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:52,910
Dougie did it, you would.

4420
02:42:53,030 --> 02:42:53,910
I believed in you.

4421
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:56,690
Alright, now go find Stan and kick his ass!

4422
02:42:56,870 --> 02:42:57,810
Okay, we gotta go downstairs.

4423
02:42:58,190 --> 02:42:59,090
Sorry he ever challenged me.

4424
02:43:00,870 --> 02:43:02,690
Become an honorary marsh?

4425
02:43:04,150 --> 02:43:06,010
Wait, I became an honorary marshwalker?

4426
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:07,970
Target sighted!

4427
02:43:08,090 --> 02:43:08,490
Oh, it's this one.

4428
02:43:08,510 --> 02:43:08,610
This way.

4429
02:43:10,370 --> 02:43:10,990
Oh yeah.

4430
02:43:12,030 --> 02:43:14,730
Alright, just run!

4431
02:43:15,350 --> 02:43:16,230
Just run!

4432
02:43:16,690 --> 02:43:17,170
Oh, I'm stuck.

4433
02:43:18,130 --> 02:43:18,970
Just run!

4434
02:43:21,070 --> 02:43:21,510
Speedrun!

4435
02:43:24,190 --> 02:43:25,570
We don't need toilet paper!

4436
02:43:26,030 --> 02:43:26,650
Just go!

4437
02:43:26,850 --> 02:43:27,470
Go go go!

4438
02:43:30,650 --> 02:43:31,310
Just run.

4439
02:43:31,970 --> 02:43:33,150
Okay, we need to heal though.

4440
02:43:33,290 --> 02:43:35,010
We can stay here and heal a little bit.

4441
02:43:35,150 --> 02:43:35,630
That's okay.

4442
02:43:36,710 --> 02:43:38,690
Wait, if you just run, Mr. Man!

4443
02:43:39,810 --> 02:43:41,650
Just one of us has to get there!

4444
02:43:42,510 --> 02:43:43,810
Oh god, okay, never mind.

4445
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:45,450
I have to get pissed off.

4446
02:43:45,610 --> 02:43:46,370
I have to be angry.

4447
02:43:47,230 --> 02:43:47,670
Alright.

4448
02:43:48,270 --> 02:43:49,250
No, the key!

4449
02:43:50,430 --> 02:43:52,250
Not the level 3 elf's lock!

4450
02:43:53,710 --> 02:43:54,150
Okay.

4451
02:43:54,630 --> 02:43:55,730
Let's get rid of...

4452
02:43:55,730 --> 02:43:57,730
Let's get rid of the fireworks, people.

4453
02:43:58,230 --> 02:44:00,290
This is how words are won.

4454
02:44:01,370 --> 02:44:01,810
Alright.

4455
02:44:02,390 --> 02:44:02,830
Nice.

4456
02:44:03,530 --> 02:44:04,150
That's right.

4457
02:44:04,190 --> 02:44:05,490
Get into my bubba!

4458
02:44:06,330 --> 02:44:07,030
Oh yeah?

4459
02:44:08,850 --> 02:44:10,050
Who got super size?

4460
02:44:10,230 --> 02:44:10,830
Kid Cannon?

4461
02:44:16,250 --> 02:44:18,410
It's legal if it's all the kids.

4462
02:44:18,530 --> 02:44:21,010
Okay, it's legal if only the kids are doing it.

4463
02:44:21,070 --> 02:44:21,290
Okay?

4464
02:44:22,790 --> 02:44:24,010
That's why it's legal.

4465
02:44:27,050 --> 02:44:29,770
Oh god, I need to get the bubble and then heals too.

4466
02:44:30,690 --> 02:44:32,690
The bubbles and heals are so good.

4467
02:44:33,390 --> 02:44:34,550
They're so strong.

4468
02:44:36,050 --> 02:44:36,570
Alright.

4469
02:44:37,010 --> 02:44:38,050
Get over here!

4470
02:44:38,930 --> 02:44:41,410
I didn't do the level 3 elf and lock!

4471
02:44:42,350 --> 02:44:43,650
Oh, where am I?

4472
02:44:44,350 --> 02:44:45,450
Okay, bubble time.

4473
02:44:46,470 --> 02:44:48,790
Alright, there's still like two more kids left.

4474
02:44:49,110 --> 02:44:50,230
I thought it would feel different.

4475
02:44:50,610 --> 02:44:51,130
Alright.

4476
02:44:51,270 --> 02:44:52,050
Oh my god!

4477
02:44:52,090 --> 02:44:53,490
He has unlimited kids!

4478
02:44:55,970 --> 02:44:58,550
When you get rid of fireworks, they have too many kids.

4479
02:44:59,250 --> 02:45:00,370
Oh, fun.

4480
02:45:00,790 --> 02:45:01,670
Alright, nice.

4481
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:03,110
Child.

4482
02:45:04,830 --> 02:45:06,790
Cannon fodder, let's go!

4483
02:45:07,730 --> 02:45:08,210
Alright.

4484
02:45:11,710 --> 02:45:12,330
That...

4485
02:45:12,330 --> 02:45:13,490
No, that's not toilet paper.

4486
02:45:13,930 --> 02:45:14,530
Whee!

4487
02:45:15,150 --> 02:45:17,090
What the fuck is this?

4488
02:45:18,350 --> 02:45:19,590
What trailer is this?

4489
02:45:19,670 --> 02:45:20,470
Is this an easter egg?

4490
02:45:22,690 --> 02:45:25,150
Oh my god!

4491
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:30,580
I'm watching it backwards.

4492
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:33,360
This is...

4493
02:45:33,360 --> 02:45:34,440
A catapult!

4494
02:45:34,760 --> 02:45:35,480
Will...

4495
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:37,220
You...

4496
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:38,920
Away...

4497
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:40,320
And...

4498
02:45:41,740 --> 02:45:43,720
Fly... the... to...

4499
02:45:43,720 --> 02:45:44,440
Fast!

4500
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:49,260
Oh, I could have watched it in the back!

4501
02:45:50,500 --> 02:45:51,780
I didn't realize!

4502
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:52,680
No!

4503
02:45:53,540 --> 02:45:55,600
I could have watched it here!

4504
02:45:58,240 --> 02:45:58,840
No!

4505
02:45:58,980 --> 02:45:59,680
My movie!

4506
02:46:02,380 --> 02:46:03,720
I didn't understand!

4507
02:46:04,520 --> 02:46:05,560
I didn't understand!

4508
02:46:06,380 --> 02:46:07,260
Oh, how?

4509
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:10,090
Oh my god!

4510
02:46:10,110 --> 02:46:11,810
You're ruining my movie experience!

4511
02:46:12,750 --> 02:46:13,030
Ow!

4512
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:15,510
It's okay.

4513
02:46:17,910 --> 02:46:20,010
It moved way too fast.

4514
02:46:20,170 --> 02:46:20,470
It moved way too fast.

4515
02:46:21,310 --> 02:46:22,290
Alright, nice.

4516
02:46:22,610 --> 02:46:25,730
I barely... I barely can see who's in front of me.

4517
02:46:25,790 --> 02:46:26,310
What?

4518
02:46:26,970 --> 02:46:29,110
How many people are dying?

4519
02:46:31,870 --> 02:46:32,530
Ah!

4520
02:46:32,690 --> 02:46:34,450
There's a fire!

4521
02:46:34,910 --> 02:46:35,410
Two!

4522
02:46:36,250 --> 02:46:37,430
I knew it.

4523
02:46:37,550 --> 02:46:39,370
I knew that was what's coming out.

4524
02:46:42,550 --> 02:46:44,350
We all know Canada's not real.

4525
02:46:46,730 --> 02:46:48,430
Because I'm not real.

4526
02:46:48,470 --> 02:46:49,390
I'm just an anime girl.

4527
02:46:50,310 --> 02:46:53,690
People invented Canada for VTubers.

4528
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:55,870
That's why all...

4529
02:46:56,970 --> 02:46:58,230
That's why all VTubers are...

4530
02:46:59,590 --> 02:47:00,330
That's why...

4531
02:47:00,330 --> 02:47:02,970
That's why a lot of English speaking VTubers are from Canada.

4532
02:47:03,250 --> 02:47:04,170
It's not real.

4533
02:47:04,350 --> 02:47:06,970
We just say Canada as like a made up country.

4534
02:47:10,570 --> 02:47:12,210
It makes sense, doesn't it?

4535
02:47:12,970 --> 02:47:14,990
It all makes sense now.

4536
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:18,270
We say Canada because we were like, Oh, where are you from?

4537
02:47:18,430 --> 02:47:19,070
We're like Canada.

4538
02:47:22,290 --> 02:47:23,550
Bro, what the fuck?

4539
02:47:23,550 --> 02:47:23,650
What?

4540
02:47:23,650 --> 02:47:24,070
Child!

4541
02:47:24,770 --> 02:47:27,950
Child is a bad word not in my Christian South Park stream.

4542
02:47:29,830 --> 02:47:31,030
It's all a simulation.

4543
02:47:32,210 --> 02:47:33,390
We're still alive.

4544
02:47:35,230 --> 02:47:36,230
Bye bye.

4545
02:47:36,550 --> 02:47:37,670
We're still alive.

4546
02:47:38,630 --> 02:47:39,430
What child?

4547
02:47:41,690 --> 02:47:42,790
Oh, they're over here.

4548
02:47:44,530 --> 02:47:45,490
They're over here.

4549
02:47:46,210 --> 02:47:47,450
Beat up these children.

4550
02:47:47,890 --> 02:47:48,010
Nope.

4551
02:47:48,330 --> 02:47:49,130
Oh no!

4552
02:47:50,170 --> 02:47:50,930
Oh no!

4553
02:47:51,170 --> 02:47:51,490
That's fine.

4554
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:52,890
I just don't have to move.

4555
02:47:53,010 --> 02:47:53,670
I just right click.

4556
02:47:56,750 --> 02:47:58,590
Easiest game of my life.

4557
02:48:00,870 --> 02:48:02,030
Right click to win.

4558
02:48:02,770 --> 02:48:04,690
Fight your way to the rest of downtown.

4559
02:48:05,650 --> 02:48:06,950
Alright, we just gotta run.

4560
02:48:07,470 --> 02:48:08,430
Don't look back.

4561
02:48:08,810 --> 02:48:09,970
Don't look back.

4562
02:48:10,110 --> 02:48:11,070
Fake new kid.

4563
02:48:11,390 --> 02:48:12,490
Just keep running.

4564
02:48:12,490 --> 02:48:13,490
We're gonna need to pass through the ice to get to Stan.

4565
02:48:13,690 --> 02:48:14,430
Find a cannon bob.

4566
02:48:14,790 --> 02:48:15,550
Careful, fellas.

4567
02:48:15,910 --> 02:48:17,190
Stan's got cannons too.

4568
02:48:17,570 --> 02:48:19,110
We need to find a cannon bob.

4569
02:48:19,130 --> 02:48:20,750
Wait, where is the cannon bob?

4570
02:48:21,830 --> 02:48:23,390
Dude, your weapons can't break this.

4571
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:24,470
Use the cannons.

4572
02:48:24,550 --> 02:48:27,490
Where the fuck is the cannon bob?

4573
02:48:28,050 --> 02:48:28,990
Oh, it's over here.

4574
02:48:29,030 --> 02:48:29,570
I found one.

4575
02:48:30,230 --> 02:48:30,990
I got one.

4576
02:48:32,130 --> 02:48:32,690
Break it.

4577
02:48:33,970 --> 02:48:34,970
Whoa, nice shot.

4578
02:48:35,110 --> 02:48:36,390
Just a few more and you're in.

4579
02:48:37,110 --> 02:48:38,970
One more hit and that barrier is going down.

4580
02:48:39,090 --> 02:48:39,970
Okay, we need one more.

4581
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:42,130
Fake new kid.

4582
02:48:42,370 --> 02:48:43,870
Not the main character new kid.

4583
02:48:43,930 --> 02:48:44,950
Where's the other cannon bob?

4584
02:48:46,730 --> 02:48:48,290
Wait, where is the other cannon bob?

4585
02:48:48,490 --> 02:48:49,110
Oh, it's on the other side.

4586
02:48:49,130 --> 02:48:49,190
Oh, it's on me.

4587
02:48:49,710 --> 02:48:50,430
See, I got it.

4588
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:52,950
I got it but I can't jump because it's realism.

4589
02:48:53,950 --> 02:48:57,190
Because when you're a child, you can't jump and you have a cannon bob because it's not safe.

4590
02:48:57,330 --> 02:48:58,090
March walkers to me.

4591
02:48:58,450 --> 02:48:58,770
Yes.

4592
02:48:58,990 --> 02:48:59,530
Barrier down.

4593
02:48:59,690 --> 02:49:00,050
Oh, wait.

4594
02:49:00,090 --> 02:49:00,870
Here, he got the other one.

4595
02:49:01,390 --> 02:49:02,170
Onward to the playground.

4596
02:49:02,830 --> 02:49:03,150
Jimmy!

4597
02:49:04,150 --> 02:49:05,170
Stan, ready for your challenge.

4598
02:49:05,310 --> 02:49:06,070
Let's get you an upgrade.

4599
02:49:07,890 --> 02:49:08,210
Okay.

4600
02:49:09,010 --> 02:49:09,330
Uncommon.

4601
02:49:09,910 --> 02:49:10,350
Oh, look.

4602
02:49:10,390 --> 02:49:11,210
It's 20%.

4603
02:49:11,650 --> 02:49:11,970
Yes.

4604
02:49:12,210 --> 02:49:13,230
Do I have enough to upgrade?

4605
02:49:13,410 --> 02:49:13,770
I do.

4606
02:49:14,110 --> 02:49:14,430
Okay.

4607
02:49:14,810 --> 02:49:16,050
This is the OP one.

4608
02:49:16,050 --> 02:49:17,030
Ah, yes.

4609
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:17,790
A fine upgrade.

4610
02:49:19,430 --> 02:49:19,950
Alright.

4611
02:49:19,970 --> 02:49:20,370
Nice.

4612
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:22,750
Welcome to the tomato farm.

4613
02:49:22,810 --> 02:49:23,110
Welcome.

4614
02:49:23,190 --> 02:49:23,450
Welcome.

4615
02:49:24,230 --> 02:49:24,750
Alright.

4616
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:25,050
Let's go.

4617
02:49:26,290 --> 02:49:26,810
New

4618
02:49:41,330 --> 02:49:41,490
kid.

4619
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:42,670
You're dead.

4620
02:49:43,110 --> 02:49:43,370
Ha!

4621
02:49:45,650 --> 02:49:46,530
Oh, no.

4622
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:47,610
16 damage.

4623
02:49:47,950 --> 02:49:48,910
16 damage?

4624
02:49:49,470 --> 02:49:49,910
Yeah.

4625
02:49:50,150 --> 02:49:54,250
Since I passed the test of strength, your 10 plus act is largely ineffective now.

4626
02:49:54,410 --> 02:49:55,090
Wait a minute.

4627
02:49:55,130 --> 02:49:56,550
The new kid has the secret power too?

4628
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:58,490
So then I'm not super OP anymore?

4629
02:49:58,950 --> 02:50:00,470
Does that mean Cartman wins?

4630
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:01,630
Not exactly.

4631
02:50:01,810 --> 02:50:04,490
Why don't you just use the class 10 combat base that you built?

4632
02:50:04,690 --> 02:50:06,990
You have a dragon for Christ's sake.

4633
02:50:07,210 --> 02:50:08,150
Oh, he has a dragon?

4634
02:50:09,150 --> 02:50:10,010
Okay, new kids.

4635
02:50:10,090 --> 02:50:10,710
Prepare to die.

4636
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:16,150
How the fuck are we gonna hit Stan all the way up there?

4637
02:50:16,310 --> 02:50:16,490
Yeah.

4638
02:50:17,630 --> 02:50:19,150
How the fuck does he get a dragon?

4639
02:50:20,110 --> 02:50:20,750
There's a cannon.

4640
02:50:21,330 --> 02:50:22,330
Put me in, boss.

4641
02:50:22,970 --> 02:50:23,370
Wait.

4642
02:50:23,410 --> 02:50:23,770
I'm boss.

4643
02:50:25,630 --> 02:50:26,690
Children, put me in.

4644
02:50:26,810 --> 02:50:27,310
I'm boss.

4645
02:50:28,610 --> 02:50:30,170
Wait, where the fuck is the other cannon?

4646
02:50:31,530 --> 02:50:32,610
Oh my god, there's more.

4647
02:50:33,630 --> 02:50:34,350
We're gonna do it.

4648
02:50:34,790 --> 02:50:36,190
I got the other cannon.

4649
02:50:38,390 --> 02:50:38,990
It's okay.

4650
02:50:39,250 --> 02:50:41,230
But how do I get the cannonball up top?

4651
02:50:42,530 --> 02:50:43,310
Oh, there it is.

4652
02:50:43,310 --> 02:50:43,730
There's a rap.

4653
02:50:44,030 --> 02:50:46,030
The only way to get back to defenses is with the cannon.

4654
02:50:46,170 --> 02:50:47,230
Look around for some cannonballs.

4655
02:50:47,510 --> 02:50:49,070
But how do I put it in?

4656
02:50:49,630 --> 02:50:50,790
Yeah, let him fucking have it.

4657
02:50:50,890 --> 02:50:52,470
How did you get up there?

4658
02:50:52,650 --> 02:50:53,990
How did you get up there?

4659
02:50:57,330 --> 02:50:58,470
How does Mr. King do that?

4660
02:50:58,490 --> 02:50:59,450
How do men do it?

4661
02:51:01,110 --> 02:51:02,010
Number two!

4662
02:51:02,670 --> 02:51:05,050
I have a cannonball right here!

4663
02:51:05,530 --> 02:51:06,770
What do I do?

4664
02:51:09,110 --> 02:51:10,330
How did you get up?

4665
02:51:10,330 --> 02:51:11,070
I'm gonna watch you.

4666
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:12,490
How did you get up?

4667
02:51:12,910 --> 02:51:14,270
How did you do it?

4668
02:51:15,350 --> 02:51:17,970
Oh, there's a rap.

4669
02:51:19,210 --> 02:51:20,210
There's a rap.

4670
02:51:21,650 --> 02:51:23,270
I figured it out, guys.

4671
02:51:23,470 --> 02:51:24,470
There was a rap.

4672
02:51:24,490 --> 02:51:25,150
Look at this place.

4673
02:51:28,270 --> 02:51:29,510
Guys, we did it.

4674
02:51:29,510 --> 02:51:29,590
Guys, we did it.

4675
02:51:29,850 --> 02:51:30,070
Guys, we did it.

4676
02:51:30,390 --> 02:51:31,770
God, we're so smart.

4677
02:51:32,590 --> 02:51:34,130
We're so fucking smart.

4678
02:51:34,590 --> 02:51:37,370
Who would have thought there was a rap all along?

4679
02:51:38,110 --> 02:51:39,970
It was right here.

4680
02:51:40,870 --> 02:51:41,730
It was right here.

4681
02:51:41,730 --> 02:51:42,510
You won't win, new kid.

4682
02:51:43,770 --> 02:51:46,810
I was a little bit directionally challenged.

4683
02:51:47,670 --> 02:51:49,170
I was a little bit directionally challenged.

4684
02:51:49,170 --> 02:51:50,870
Get over here, Stan.

4685
02:51:51,350 --> 02:51:52,670
I completed the quest.

4686
02:51:52,850 --> 02:51:54,290
I used the dark matter.

4687
02:51:55,150 --> 02:51:55,430
I'm not new.

4688
02:51:56,770 --> 02:51:58,230
Maybe I wasn't using enough.

4689
02:51:58,890 --> 02:52:00,270
Oh, God, no.

4690
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:04,210
Oh, no.

4691
02:52:04,350 --> 02:52:06,350
Please get that thing away from me.

4692
02:52:08,150 --> 02:52:09,310
Okay, that kinda hurt.

4693
02:52:09,550 --> 02:52:10,990
Get that thing away.

4694
02:52:11,090 --> 02:52:11,570
No!

4695
02:52:11,590 --> 02:52:12,710
Get away from me!

4696
02:52:12,970 --> 02:52:14,250
You can't hide from my action.

4697
02:52:14,430 --> 02:52:15,030
Oh, God.

4698
02:52:15,090 --> 02:52:15,650
It's okay.

4699
02:52:17,210 --> 02:52:19,650
There's so much fire going on.

4700
02:52:19,950 --> 02:52:20,190
I told you, man.

4701
02:52:20,190 --> 02:52:21,390
Oh, God.

4702
02:52:21,470 --> 02:52:21,950
Be angry.

4703
02:52:22,250 --> 02:52:23,730
I have to be angry.

4704
02:52:23,850 --> 02:52:24,790
Get in my bubble.

4705
02:52:26,690 --> 02:52:28,250
Get in the flames!

4706
02:52:30,270 --> 02:52:31,690
Oh, my God.

4707
02:52:33,110 --> 02:52:34,070
Oh, my God.

4708
02:52:34,070 --> 02:52:34,670
Where are you?

4709
02:52:34,710 --> 02:52:36,270
He's just whacking me.

4710
02:52:36,670 --> 02:52:37,430
Where is he?

4711
02:52:37,690 --> 02:52:38,370
Oh, God.

4712
02:52:38,370 --> 02:52:39,590
I need to get the bubble in.

4713
02:52:40,090 --> 02:52:40,810
Take that.

4714
02:52:42,030 --> 02:52:42,690
That's right.

4715
02:52:43,270 --> 02:52:46,410
The closer you get to me, the more damage you're gonna get.

4716
02:52:46,950 --> 02:52:47,990
You won't beat me.

4717
02:52:48,110 --> 02:52:48,290
I won't.

4718
02:52:48,390 --> 02:52:48,870
Stan!

4719
02:52:50,070 --> 02:52:50,550
Stan!

4720
02:52:51,890 --> 02:52:54,310
Everyone's going crazy fighting each other for toilet paper.

4721
02:52:54,310 --> 02:52:58,050
But I've been finding these treasure chests filled with it all over the place.

4722
02:52:58,270 --> 02:53:01,410
People are just leaving them in hidden but easily findable locations.

4723
02:53:01,650 --> 02:53:02,250
Can you believe that?

4724
02:53:02,590 --> 02:53:05,350
I also beat up Stach and took his toilet paper, too.

4725
02:53:06,030 --> 02:53:07,090
We're gonna be rich, Stan!

4726
02:53:08,190 --> 02:53:08,970
Dad, not now.

4727
02:53:09,050 --> 02:53:09,990
I have to defeat my enemies.

4728
02:53:10,570 --> 02:53:10,970
Enemies?

4729
02:53:11,170 --> 02:53:11,730
Well, wait.

4730
02:53:11,750 --> 02:53:14,210
So if you lose, do they get to take our toilet paper?

4731
02:53:14,570 --> 02:53:15,190
I guess.

4732
02:53:15,690 --> 02:53:16,930
Yeah, those are the rules.

4733
02:53:17,150 --> 02:53:17,790
Oh, shit.

4734
02:53:17,950 --> 02:53:19,530
No, they can't have our toilet paper.

4735
02:53:19,750 --> 02:53:21,010
Wait, but he's an adult!

4736
02:53:21,010 --> 02:53:24,110
You're gonna join in the middle of a Class 10 base siege?

4737
02:53:24,310 --> 02:53:25,910
Well, uh, you know what?

4738
02:53:25,950 --> 02:53:26,190
Sure.

4739
02:53:26,330 --> 02:53:26,810
What?

4740
02:53:27,030 --> 02:53:27,510
What?

4741
02:53:28,990 --> 02:53:29,470
Run!

4742
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:30,470
I'm cutting you down!

4743
02:53:30,490 --> 02:53:30,930
Oh my god!

4744
02:53:31,050 --> 02:53:31,870
Oh my god!

4745
02:53:32,730 --> 02:53:34,830
He fucked up my- Oh my god!

4746
02:53:35,070 --> 02:53:36,390
I just- Oh!

4747
02:53:37,050 --> 02:53:37,950
Where am I?

4748
02:53:39,330 --> 02:53:42,610
I turned into a PNG because of Randy!

4749
02:53:43,370 --> 02:53:44,690
I turned into a PNG because of Randy!

4750
02:53:44,690 --> 02:53:46,290
I'll tell tales of your bravery!

4751
02:53:46,530 --> 02:53:50,990
I turned into a PNG because of Randy!

4752
02:53:51,010 --> 02:53:52,790
Like, what the fu-

4753
02:53:57,530 --> 02:53:59,230
That's fucked up, man!

4754
02:53:59,910 --> 02:54:01,730
Randy, that's fucked up!

4755
02:54:07,130 --> 02:54:07,650
Okay.

4756
02:54:08,470 --> 02:54:09,650
How did he die?

4757
02:54:18,600 --> 02:54:20,100
Oh my god!

4758
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:21,400
Bro!

4759
02:54:21,740 --> 02:54:24,300
Where the fuck- Okay, he's one hit!

4760
02:54:24,500 --> 02:54:25,520
Guys, let me kill Steel!

4761
02:54:25,900 --> 02:54:27,740
Let me kill- Yeah, I killed Steel.

4762
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:28,720
He's a warrior!

4763
02:54:29,380 --> 02:54:29,900
Dad!

4764
02:54:32,060 --> 02:54:33,780
Please, do whatever you want, but Stan!

4765
02:54:34,140 --> 02:54:35,360
Don't hurt the toilet paper!

4766
02:54:35,620 --> 02:54:36,940
I was gonna be rich!

4767
02:54:39,180 --> 02:54:39,700
Stoooch!

4768
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:43,400
I can't believe I can't pause an online game.

4769
02:54:43,640 --> 02:54:46,040
Thank you guys for not letting me die.

4770
02:54:48,360 --> 02:54:50,440
Guys, I can't believe it!

4771
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:55,720
I can't- I still managed to pause an online game.

4772
02:54:55,880 --> 02:54:56,340
Let's go!

4773
02:54:58,740 --> 02:55:00,140
That's a ton of dark matter!

4774
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:01,220
A real impressive load!

4775
02:55:01,260 --> 02:55:02,000
Look at us go!

4776
02:55:03,240 --> 02:55:04,420
We're so good!

4777
02:55:05,100 --> 02:55:06,040
No problem.

4778
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:13,280
I play game in Honorary's Marsh Walker!

4779
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:15,120
Let's go.

4780
02:55:19,480 --> 02:55:20,800
Pause the internet!

4781
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:21,800
Pause!

4782
02:55:31,230 --> 02:55:33,610
Why can't you just play by the same rules as everyone else?

4783
02:55:33,610 --> 02:55:35,810
Because my version of the rules actually work!

4784
02:55:36,030 --> 02:55:38,250
The way you guys do it, it doesn't even make any sense!

4785
02:55:38,530 --> 02:55:40,310
You don't even know what power-ups go with what abilities!

4786
02:55:40,710 --> 02:55:42,830
And that's why you turned into a total dick?

4787
02:55:43,030 --> 02:55:45,470
Oh, I'm a dick because I stood up for what I believe in.

4788
02:55:45,750 --> 02:55:47,450
Upgrades shouldn't be awarded every level!

4789
02:55:47,510 --> 02:55:48,010
It's confusing!

4790
02:55:48,330 --> 02:55:49,370
Well, we beat you, Stan!

4791
02:55:49,390 --> 02:55:49,530
Wait, what?

4792
02:55:49,790 --> 02:55:51,010
But that makes sense!

4793
02:55:52,170 --> 02:55:55,550
Yeah, so can you please stop this winter spell before more people get hurt?

4794
02:55:55,830 --> 02:55:56,770
Yeah, what are you talking about?

4795
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:57,630
Yeah, what are you talking about?

4796
02:55:57,810 --> 02:55:57,850
Come on, Stan!

4797
02:55:58,070 --> 02:55:59,710
We know this snowstorm isn't natural!

4798
02:55:59,890 --> 02:56:00,630
Somebody use magic!

4799
02:56:00,630 --> 02:56:04,870
Do you really think I would purposely start a storm that's killing people and shutting down the whole town?

4800
02:56:05,050 --> 02:56:06,150
The way you've been acting lately?

4801
02:56:06,330 --> 02:56:06,510
Yes!

4802
02:56:06,850 --> 02:56:09,030
Why did you turn against everybody and get all aggro?

4803
02:56:09,170 --> 02:56:10,230
I don't know, okay?

4804
02:56:11,170 --> 02:56:12,470
He's going through things.

4805
02:56:13,050 --> 02:56:13,750
I guess...

4806
02:56:14,190 --> 02:56:16,210
Ever since I got that dark matter stuff from Mr. Hanky...

4807
02:56:16,210 --> 02:56:17,550
It's Mr. Hanky!

4808
02:56:18,170 --> 02:56:18,910
What did you say?

4809
02:56:21,590 --> 02:56:22,390
Mr. Hanky!

4810
02:56:22,790 --> 02:56:24,010
...from Mr. Hanky?

4811
02:56:24,150 --> 02:56:25,130
The Christmas Pooh?

4812
02:56:25,590 --> 02:56:26,850
He's the secret villain!

4813
02:56:27,770 --> 02:56:28,590
That could be it.

4814
02:56:28,750 --> 02:56:29,530
What could it be?

4815
02:56:30,630 --> 02:56:30,710
Remember?

4816
02:56:30,990 --> 02:56:32,750
Mr. Hanky was kicked out of town!

4817
02:56:32,910 --> 02:56:34,050
By the entire town!

4818
02:56:34,070 --> 02:56:36,090
Yeah, that's why I was surprised Mr. Hanky's back.

4819
02:56:36,150 --> 02:56:37,070
He got phased out.

4820
02:56:37,470 --> 02:56:38,690
Mr. Hanky kept getting wasted and tweeting things.

4821
02:56:39,150 --> 02:56:40,290
Oh, come on!

4822
02:56:40,290 --> 02:56:40,550
No!

4823
02:56:41,870 --> 02:56:42,270
No!

4824
02:56:44,850 --> 02:56:46,470
Oh no, not that episode!

4825
02:56:47,270 --> 02:56:48,770
If anyone would want to hurt this town...

4826
02:56:48,770 --> 02:56:49,090
Whoa!

4827
02:56:50,290 --> 02:56:53,550
How could you accept dark gifts from Mr. Hanky and not tell anyone, Stan?

4828
02:56:53,590 --> 02:56:56,130
And this is why I'm scared of playing the second game on YouTube.

4829
02:56:56,350 --> 02:56:57,350
Who does that?

4830
02:56:59,110 --> 02:57:00,530
I remember that episode.

4831
02:57:01,030 --> 02:57:02,810
I guess we have to find Mr. Hanky and put a stop to him.

4832
02:57:02,950 --> 02:57:05,530
By Zaron's balls, we'll find him and destroy his dark powers.

4833
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:07,550
And then we can stop this horrible winter storm!

4834
02:57:07,850 --> 02:57:09,710
And then all the stores can finally open again.

4835
02:57:10,030 --> 02:57:10,430
Yeah.

4836
02:57:10,710 --> 02:57:13,310
And people stop fighting over toilet paper and get back to work!

4837
02:57:13,530 --> 02:57:13,930
Right!

4838
02:57:14,330 --> 02:57:14,730
Yeah!

4839
02:57:14,870 --> 02:57:16,790
And we can all get back to going to school!

4840
02:57:17,070 --> 02:57:17,310
What?

4841
02:57:17,670 --> 02:57:18,070
No!

4842
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:20,430
No!

4843
02:57:22,230 --> 02:57:24,930
Karma's gonna be the other secret villain.

4844
02:57:25,830 --> 02:57:27,230
Chapter 4 is gonna be...

4845
02:57:27,230 --> 02:57:27,590
Whoa!

4846
02:57:28,090 --> 02:57:28,390
Whoa!

4847
02:57:30,610 --> 02:57:32,830
I don't think this is gonna end well, Ned.

4848
02:57:33,310 --> 02:57:34,030
No shit.

4849
02:57:34,470 --> 02:57:35,850
What do you want guns for?

4850
02:57:36,150 --> 02:57:36,270
Excuse me!

4851
02:57:36,790 --> 02:57:37,890
Hot cocoa anyone?

4852
02:57:38,270 --> 02:57:39,510
Free delicious hot cocoa!

4853
02:57:39,770 --> 02:57:41,150
Everyone's favorite winter tan treat!

4854
02:57:41,550 --> 02:57:43,410
I know you're all tired and hungry and cold.

4855
02:57:43,550 --> 02:57:44,910
How about something to get you through the night?

4856
02:57:45,490 --> 02:57:47,210
Father Maxie, would you like some hot cocoa?

4857
02:57:48,050 --> 02:57:48,710
Uh, sure!

4858
02:57:48,890 --> 02:57:51,770
I guess I can have a little hot cocoa before the world ends.

4859
02:57:52,030 --> 02:57:52,910
It's pretty cold.

4860
02:57:52,990 --> 02:57:54,370
I'll take some hot cocoa.

4861
02:57:54,930 --> 02:57:56,090
Does it have dark matter?

4862
02:57:56,850 --> 02:57:58,510
Oh, it has dark matter!

4863
02:57:59,010 --> 02:58:00,430
We're gonna fight adults?

4864
02:58:01,110 --> 02:58:02,950
It's not for children anymore.

4865
02:58:03,030 --> 02:58:03,150
I'm never going back to school.

4866
02:58:03,810 --> 02:58:06,150
And you'll never have to, Eric.

4867
02:58:06,870 --> 02:58:07,510
Sweet.

4868
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:10,090
No!

4869
02:58:10,130 --> 02:58:12,110
I sense great dark matter within you.

4870
02:58:12,350 --> 02:58:14,030
That's not dark matter.

4871
02:58:15,470 --> 02:58:16,950
Oh my god.

4872
02:58:18,230 --> 02:58:18,870
Guys!

4873
02:58:21,710 --> 02:58:24,710
Guys, I think this is a medical concern now.

4874
02:58:24,730 --> 02:58:24,750
I think this is a medical concern now.

4875
02:58:24,830 --> 02:58:24,890
I think this is a medical concern now.

4876
02:58:27,910 --> 02:58:28,430
I think this is a medical concern now.

4877
02:58:28,530 --> 02:58:29,670
There's not even a school to go back to?

4878
02:58:29,770 --> 02:58:31,670
It's probably buried in like 50 feet of snow.

4879
02:58:33,310 --> 02:58:33,830
Guys.

4880
02:58:34,550 --> 02:58:35,070
Guys.

4881
02:58:35,690 --> 02:58:37,930
I think this is a medical concern now.

4882
02:58:38,890 --> 02:58:40,150
I don't think...

4883
02:58:40,150 --> 02:58:41,850
I don't think...

4884
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:42,950
Oh no.

4885
02:58:43,830 --> 02:58:47,410
Constructed mechanical monstrosity that fires snowballs for you.

4886
02:58:47,410 --> 02:58:49,510
I still feel the shield is really good.

4887
02:58:49,750 --> 02:58:51,090
I still feel the shield is really good.

4888
02:58:51,090 --> 02:58:53,890
I feel like I'm still gonna run shield and heals.

4889
02:58:54,190 --> 02:58:54,210
I feel like I'm still gonna run shield and heals.

4890
02:58:54,930 --> 02:58:56,250
Oh, that's it!

4891
02:58:57,250 --> 02:59:00,530
Okay, that's the level 10.

4892
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:04,170
That's the level 10 battle axe.

4893
02:59:06,650 --> 02:59:07,010
Okay.

4894
02:59:07,150 --> 02:59:08,230
And then...

4895
02:59:10,650 --> 02:59:12,430
And then... alright.

4896
02:59:12,510 --> 02:59:14,470
And then press while jumping... woah!

4897
02:59:15,730 --> 02:59:16,710
That's fucking crazy!

4898
02:59:17,770 --> 02:59:19,130
Alright, Dark Matter time.

4899
02:59:20,710 --> 02:59:21,190
Let's see.

4900
02:59:21,310 --> 02:59:22,910
You deal 20% damage?

4901
02:59:22,990 --> 02:59:23,590
Fuck yeah!

4902
02:59:25,190 --> 02:59:27,750
Oh, I do not have a lot.

4903
02:59:28,030 --> 02:59:29,130
Ice Skater?

4904
02:59:29,570 --> 02:59:30,130
Oh!

4905
02:59:30,670 --> 02:59:31,230
Alright.

4906
02:59:32,410 --> 02:59:35,950
I don't know about that.

4907
02:59:36,090 --> 02:59:36,450
I don't know.

4908
02:59:36,530 --> 02:59:38,430
I'm worried about this Dark Matter thing now.

4909
02:59:38,790 --> 02:59:40,490
Not this Dark Matter!

4910
02:59:44,050 --> 02:59:45,230
Alright, let's see.

4911
02:59:45,350 --> 02:59:45,750
Anton.

4912
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:48,170
Alright.

4913
02:59:48,170 --> 02:59:49,030
Here we go.

4914
02:59:50,050 --> 02:59:51,070
Are you ready?

4915
02:59:51,810 --> 02:59:52,370
Wait!

4916
02:59:52,690 --> 02:59:54,050
Where's... wait!

4917
02:59:55,710 --> 02:59:56,210
No!

4918
02:59:56,210 --> 02:59:57,750
Who's gonna carry me?

4919
02:59:59,330 --> 03:00:03,050
Why are they always gone when I need them the most?

4920
03:00:20,720 --> 03:00:22,360
Sammy, thank you for the super chat!

4921
03:00:22,480 --> 03:00:22,700
Thank you!

4922
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:27,780
TLDR, if you're pooping Dark Matter, please see a doctor.

4923
03:00:27,780 --> 03:00:34,720
If your poop starts talking back to you, there might be something wrong with your brain.

4924
03:00:39,540 --> 03:00:40,140
Wait,

4925
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:45,320
does that mean Mr. Hankey doesn't get bullshit?

4926
03:00:45,840 --> 03:00:46,740
Oh, God!

4927
03:00:46,980 --> 03:00:48,760
Fucking flashbang out of nowhere.

4928
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:52,940
Alright.

4929
03:00:52,940 --> 03:00:53,040
Alright.

4930
03:00:54,380 --> 03:00:57,460
The wand is, but will set you on fire over time.

4931
03:00:57,880 --> 03:00:58,480
You know what?

4932
03:00:58,500 --> 03:00:59,680
That's a risk I'm gonna take.

4933
03:01:03,320 --> 03:01:06,900
Bein' on fire for a little bit wouldn't be that bad, right?

4934
03:01:07,220 --> 03:01:08,820
I'm gonna go with the...

4935
03:01:08,820 --> 03:01:10,780
This time I'll actually use this bullshit.

4936
03:01:13,760 --> 03:01:15,400
He is the bullshit.

4937
03:01:15,960 --> 03:01:19,140
And then this snow day will finally be over and we can all go back to Scoot.

4938
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:22,000
Haha!

4939
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:22,480
Surprise!

4940
03:01:23,300 --> 03:01:24,560
The plot twist!

4941
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:28,380
God damn it, Carmen, what are you doing?

4942
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:31,200
I'm finally gonna live the life I've always dreamt of, Cam!

4943
03:01:31,540 --> 03:01:33,500
A life with no skin!

4944
03:01:34,020 --> 03:01:35,900
Mr. Hankey is ruining South Park.

4945
03:01:35,980 --> 03:01:37,120
We can't keep living like this.

4946
03:01:37,320 --> 03:01:39,560
Don't worry, you won't be living much longer anyways.

4947
03:01:39,980 --> 03:01:42,600
Mr. Hankey has given me the power of Dark Magic.

4948
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:44,820
And I'm gonna use it to destroy you guys!

4949
03:01:45,240 --> 03:01:47,380
Wait, but then that means he gets like...

4950
03:01:48,540 --> 03:01:49,500
15 cards!

4951
03:01:51,280 --> 03:01:53,500
He can do the spells... he can do the...

4952
03:01:53,500 --> 03:01:54,440
Fan spells!

4953
03:01:56,540 --> 03:01:57,240
What a twist.

4954
03:02:01,300 --> 03:02:01,740
Wait...

4955
03:02:03,660 --> 03:02:05,780
Wait, but like who the fuck is in his army?

4956
03:02:07,820 --> 03:02:08,700
These DOLTS!

4957
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:14,800
Oh my god.

4958
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:15,780
That's not fair!

4959
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:18,320
You got adults to play pretend with?

4960
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:19,380
This is not pretending.

4961
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:19,740
This is not a game anymore.

4962
03:02:19,940 --> 03:02:21,500
He got adults involved.

4963
03:02:21,800 --> 03:02:23,260
The adults are gonna beat up children!

4964
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:25,080
That's a lawsuit!

4965
03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:29,780
Make your way through the backyards.

4966
03:02:29,820 --> 03:02:30,380
Oh no.

4967
03:02:31,020 --> 03:02:33,340
Oh no, the Venom army.

4968
03:02:35,100 --> 03:02:35,620
Bro!

4969
03:02:35,620 --> 03:02:37,860
What fucking slap from an adult?

4970
03:02:38,160 --> 03:02:38,680
What?

4971
03:02:41,960 --> 03:02:43,000
Oh god.

4972
03:02:43,100 --> 03:02:44,280
Thank god it's just a kid.

4973
03:02:45,540 --> 03:02:46,480
Guys, it's okay.

4974
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:47,260
It's just a child.

4975
03:02:50,720 --> 03:02:51,740
It's okay, guys.

4976
03:02:52,260 --> 03:02:54,600
Oh no, there's no napalm.

4977
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:58,260
This is so much more difficult without napalm now.

4978
03:03:00,320 --> 03:03:01,920
It's actually more difficult.

4979
03:03:03,900 --> 03:03:04,980
Alright, we're fine.

4980
03:03:05,060 --> 03:03:05,340
We're fine.

4981
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:06,580
Okay.

4982
03:03:06,900 --> 03:03:07,640
We got it.

4983
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:09,040
Oh no!

4984
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:10,180
We got it here!

4985
03:03:11,320 --> 03:03:13,500
Is it because I'm also on fire?

4986
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:15,800
That I'm taking... no, it can't be.

4987
03:03:16,760 --> 03:03:18,380
No, that can't be it.

4988
03:03:19,500 --> 03:03:21,480
Okay, we gotta get rid of the children.

4989
03:03:23,380 --> 03:03:26,520
I got the fucking barrier.

4990
03:03:27,240 --> 03:03:28,980
They're so tanky!

4991
03:03:30,380 --> 03:03:31,300
We're... oh!

4992
03:03:31,640 --> 03:03:34,040
They're so fucking... what the hell?

4993
03:03:34,440 --> 03:03:36,720
Why are they so strong?

4994
03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:38,520
What?

4995
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:42,380
Holy shit!

4996
03:03:43,020 --> 03:03:45,840
They're actually so fucking strong.

4997
03:03:45,920 --> 03:03:46,760
It's actually crazy.

4998
03:03:48,040 --> 03:03:48,800
Okay.

4999
03:03:49,500 --> 03:03:52,080
Even if I do like 50% more damage.

5000
03:03:53,760 --> 03:03:55,200
They do so much.

5001
03:03:57,260 --> 03:03:57,820
Okay.

5002
03:03:58,200 --> 03:03:58,760
Fine.

5003
03:03:58,840 --> 03:04:00,180
We're gonna stay here for now.

5004
03:04:00,800 --> 03:04:01,960
We're gonna heal forever.

5005
03:04:02,780 --> 03:04:04,220
We're gonna heal forever.

5006
03:04:04,220 --> 03:04:05,620
The difficulty spike.

5007
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:09,940
Yeah, I'm healing myself.

5008
03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:11,800
I don't care about the teammates here.

5009
03:04:12,780 --> 03:04:13,640
Oh no.

5010
03:04:14,160 --> 03:04:14,720
Alright.

5011
03:04:14,920 --> 03:04:15,480
Heals.

5012
03:04:17,100 --> 03:04:19,080
I'm only using the heals for myself.

5013
03:04:19,820 --> 03:04:20,380
Oh, come on.

5014
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:22,620
Alright.

5015
03:04:22,780 --> 03:04:23,340
We're good.

5016
03:04:23,800 --> 03:04:24,940
We just have to...

5017
03:04:25,740 --> 03:04:26,580
Have to head up.

5018
03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:27,400
Get up here!

5019
03:04:27,820 --> 03:04:28,860
Get over here, children!

5020
03:04:29,920 --> 03:04:32,560
Don't start here yet so I can have an excuse to beat you up!

5021
03:04:34,980 --> 03:04:37,020
Alright, I hope Jimmy has the napalm.

5022
03:04:38,400 --> 03:04:40,120
That's like my only hope right now.

5023
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:41,900
Where do I go?

5024
03:04:42,160 --> 03:04:43,280
Did I kill everybody yet?

5025
03:04:43,660 --> 03:04:44,500
No, they're over there.

5026
03:04:46,640 --> 03:04:47,040
Alright.

5027
03:04:47,720 --> 03:04:48,120
Alright.

5028
03:04:49,440 --> 03:04:50,120
Heal us.

5029
03:04:50,660 --> 03:04:51,800
This is the trick.

5030
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:55,360
If I start healing next to it, I don't take fire.

5031
03:04:55,580 --> 03:04:59,080
Technically, my heals negate the fire damage that I took.

5032
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:02,220
Like, look at this damage I'm doing!

5033
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:03,300
It's so sad!

5034
03:05:03,740 --> 03:05:06,080
It's actually so sad!

5035
03:05:08,120 --> 03:05:08,780
Children!

5036
03:05:09,280 --> 03:05:09,940
Please!

5037
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:13,460
Please!

5038
03:05:13,460 --> 03:05:15,380
This dark matter is not healthy!

5039
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:17,840
Alright, nice.

5040
03:05:18,100 --> 03:05:18,840
Did we defeat everybody?

5041
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:21,220
Is that everybody?

5042
03:05:22,340 --> 03:05:25,380
Oh my god, he's all the way over there?!

5043
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:28,980
Guys, my very real dragoons.

5044
03:05:29,900 --> 03:05:30,820
Okay, that's it.

5045
03:05:30,980 --> 03:05:31,840
This is it.

5046
03:05:32,600 --> 03:05:34,100
I'm gonna use my melee.

5047
03:05:34,180 --> 03:05:35,420
My level 10 axe.

5048
03:05:35,720 --> 03:05:36,240
Wait.

5049
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:40,100
Guys, I have a feeling... Oh my god.

5050
03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:44,560
Guys, I just... There's a possibility...

5051
03:05:44,980 --> 03:05:45,360
There's a possibility...

5052
03:05:45,380 --> 03:05:48,720
That my level 10 axe is really fucking strong.

5053
03:05:53,340 --> 03:05:54,680
I don't know.

5054
03:05:54,760 --> 03:05:55,560
I don't know.

5055
03:05:55,940 --> 03:05:57,080
It's just a theory.

5056
03:05:59,400 --> 03:06:04,060
It's just a theory that my axe could be really fucking strong.

5057
03:06:04,300 --> 03:06:05,140
But I'm not sure yet.

5058
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,220
It's just a game theory though.

5059
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:14,980
It's just a game theory.

5060
03:06:15,240 --> 03:06:16,500
Oh shit!

5061
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:19,420
Oh my god, this fucking tree though.

5062
03:06:22,420 --> 03:06:22,740
Okay.

5063
03:06:23,180 --> 03:06:23,820
Oh!

5064
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:25,180
Kids!

5065
03:06:27,400 --> 03:06:27,720
Kids!

5066
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:29,640
Dragoons!

5067
03:06:29,900 --> 03:06:31,260
Protect the queen!

5068
03:06:33,440 --> 03:06:34,880
Protect the queen!

5069
03:06:36,500 --> 03:06:37,140
Okay.

5070
03:06:37,380 --> 03:06:39,380
We just gotta kill this... the tree.

5071
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:40,900
Oh no!

5072
03:06:41,580 --> 03:06:42,460
Oh no!

5073
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:43,780
Okay, nice.

5074
03:06:44,660 --> 03:06:47,500
Too bad the barrier does not fucking work.

5075
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:48,280
It's gonna work against the melee.

5076
03:06:50,040 --> 03:06:51,480
I'm just gonna burn it for now.

5077
03:06:52,640 --> 03:06:53,520
Oh shit.

5078
03:06:55,760 --> 03:06:56,200
Alright.

5079
03:06:56,420 --> 03:06:57,980
Gotta get rid of the baby tree.

5080
03:06:59,280 --> 03:07:00,500
Baby tree, goodbye.

5081
03:07:01,640 --> 03:07:03,220
Okay, and then... SLAM!

5082
03:07:04,840 --> 03:07:05,400
There we go.

5083
03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:06,120
Nice.

5084
03:07:06,380 --> 03:07:07,560
That should be everybody, right?

5085
03:07:08,840 --> 03:07:09,280
No!

5086
03:07:09,280 --> 03:07:09,940
One more!

5087
03:07:10,740 --> 03:07:11,180
SLAM!

5088
03:07:14,300 --> 03:07:14,740
Okay.

5089
03:07:14,740 --> 03:07:15,380
There we go.

5090
03:07:15,380 --> 03:07:15,860
We're good.

5091
03:07:16,840 --> 03:07:18,340
Level 10 axe, baby.

5092
03:07:20,520 --> 03:07:21,540
Axe is strong.

5093
03:07:21,700 --> 03:07:23,500
Goes back to fire.

5094
03:07:23,980 --> 03:07:25,380
Cause it's like gun!

5095
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:28,220
It's almost like gun!

5096
03:07:28,280 --> 03:07:29,420
I can't stop myself!

5097
03:07:32,080 --> 03:07:32,900
Gough kid!

5098
03:07:35,120 --> 03:07:35,680
Uhhhh...

5099
03:07:35,680 --> 03:07:38,180
Raise the rarity of the fire elemental card.

5100
03:07:38,520 --> 03:07:40,340
70% additional damage.

5101
03:07:41,020 --> 03:07:41,580
Fuck.

5102
03:07:41,580 --> 03:07:42,100
Okay, 70%.

5103
03:07:42,740 --> 03:07:44,120
I need more strength.

5104
03:07:44,260 --> 03:07:45,500
I'm like... I feel so weak.

5105
03:07:45,500 --> 03:07:48,720
I feel so fucking weak right now.

5106
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:49,360
We need this.

5107
03:07:50,400 --> 03:07:51,100
Where do I go?

5108
03:07:51,180 --> 03:07:51,460
This way?

5109
03:07:51,660 --> 03:07:52,160
Careful, new kid.

5110
03:07:52,240 --> 03:07:54,500
God matter makes these enemies stronger than anything you've fought before.

5111
03:07:54,580 --> 03:07:57,180
Oh, that's why they're so fucking strong.

5112
03:07:57,400 --> 03:07:58,600
Okay, that makes sense now.

5113
03:07:59,260 --> 03:07:59,980
Oh no.

5114
03:08:00,080 --> 03:08:00,740
Oh no.

5115
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:01,700
It's okay.

5116
03:08:03,420 --> 03:08:05,300
I was like, no wonder they hit so hard.

5117
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:06,620
I was like, what the fuck?

5118
03:08:08,480 --> 03:08:08,840
Okay.

5119
03:08:08,860 --> 03:08:09,360
We're good.

5120
03:08:10,740 --> 03:08:11,420
We're good now.

5121
03:08:11,980 --> 03:08:13,600
I do 70% more damage.

5122
03:08:13,940 --> 03:08:14,660
Golly, player one.

5123
03:08:15,140 --> 03:08:15,900
That's it, new kid.

5124
03:08:15,980 --> 03:08:17,640
Just jump into the snow if you have any skills.

5125
03:08:18,600 --> 03:08:19,260
That's alright.

5126
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:21,760
I have heals right next to me.

5127
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:23,080
They can't aim.

5128
03:08:25,360 --> 03:08:26,240
Oh shit!

5129
03:08:26,640 --> 03:08:27,240
It's okay.

5130
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:29,740
I can heal again.

5131
03:08:30,480 --> 03:08:31,100
That's right.

5132
03:08:32,540 --> 03:08:33,420
Oh, okay.

5133
03:08:33,620 --> 03:08:34,060
Barrier.

5134
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:35,380
Alright, there we go.

5135
03:08:35,700 --> 03:08:36,800
I can heal again!

5136
03:08:37,440 --> 03:08:38,220
That's right!

5137
03:08:38,840 --> 03:08:40,920
I'll just stand here and take everything!

5138
03:08:41,660 --> 03:08:43,320
Player one, you okay now?

5139
03:08:43,820 --> 03:08:44,900
Yeah, I'm pretty alright.

5140
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:46,500
Wait, did I defeat everybody?

5141
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:47,980
Then they're all dead.

5142
03:08:48,200 --> 03:08:48,740
Yeah, they are.

5143
03:08:48,920 --> 03:08:49,800
Alright, let me just heal.

5144
03:08:51,440 --> 03:08:52,140
More fire.

5145
03:08:53,820 --> 03:08:56,980
Okay, I need to heal myself so I can keep burning people.

5146
03:08:58,040 --> 03:08:58,460
Treasure!

5147
03:09:00,460 --> 03:09:01,340
Is that upgraded?

5148
03:09:02,080 --> 03:09:02,920
80%!

5149
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:05,900
Alright, now I'm definitely stronger than May.

5150
03:09:05,940 --> 03:09:07,760
Oh fuck, where did you come from?

5151
03:09:08,060 --> 03:09:08,980
Where are my friends?

5152
03:09:10,140 --> 03:09:10,900
Oh, there you go.

5153
03:09:10,940 --> 03:09:11,580
My real friends.

5154
03:09:12,780 --> 03:09:14,380
Okay, we gotta burn him.

5155
03:09:15,340 --> 03:09:16,140
Alright, that's right.

5156
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:18,440
Never have to use melee ever again.

5157
03:09:19,600 --> 03:09:20,040
Yeah!

5158
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:25,600
That's really lucky though that I got like the...

5159
03:09:26,940 --> 03:09:29,460
That I got the fucking 80%.

5160
03:09:29,460 --> 03:09:30,160
Yeah!

5161
03:09:30,560 --> 03:09:32,040
I can just stand in front of you.

5162
03:09:32,120 --> 03:09:32,520
Dodge?

5163
03:09:32,680 --> 03:09:32,960
What's that?

5164
03:09:34,480 --> 03:09:35,520
No need to dodge.

5165
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:41,040
Real gamer hours.

5166
03:09:43,920 --> 03:09:45,800
Real gamer hours right here.

5167
03:09:47,920 --> 03:09:49,080
There you go, we did it.

5168
03:09:49,380 --> 03:09:49,900
Yay!

5169
03:09:51,200 --> 03:09:52,140
Can I unlock it?

5170
03:09:54,140 --> 03:09:54,660
Where?

5171
03:09:56,340 --> 03:09:56,860
Where?

5172
03:09:56,920 --> 03:09:57,580
They're all dead.

5173
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:01,200
Where are the enemies?

5174
03:10:01,560 --> 03:10:03,280
Avelion, thank you for 10 gift ships!

5175
03:10:03,560 --> 03:10:04,380
Thank you, thank you!

5176
03:10:05,520 --> 03:10:06,840
Where the fuck are they?

5177
03:10:06,920 --> 03:10:07,200
Jimmy?

5178
03:10:07,340 --> 03:10:07,920
Is Jimmy here?

5179
03:10:09,420 --> 03:10:10,340
Is it Jimmy?

5180
03:10:12,100 --> 03:10:13,700
Where the fuck are the enemies?

5181
03:10:14,660 --> 03:10:17,020
Bro, this song is hardcore though, not gonna lie.

5182
03:10:18,640 --> 03:10:22,820
This song is like so fucking hardcore for the situation I'm in.

5183
03:10:23,220 --> 03:10:24,220
Are you... what?

5184
03:10:24,520 --> 03:10:26,340
Guys, mixed reviews.

5185
03:10:30,940 --> 03:10:34,100
But I wanna know how the story ends!

5186
03:10:34,880 --> 03:10:37,340
The things I do for self-park.

5187
03:10:39,060 --> 03:10:39,600
Alright.

5188
03:10:40,020 --> 03:10:42,780
I mean, it's like five chapters, you know?

5189
03:10:43,060 --> 03:10:44,460
I might as well.

5190
03:10:44,460 --> 03:10:45,980
It's five chapters.

5191
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:48,340
We're already past the two hours mark.

5192
03:10:50,580 --> 03:10:55,640
We're already past the two hours mark, so we might as well try to see how the story ends.

5193
03:10:56,200 --> 03:10:58,040
How do I get out of here?

5194
03:10:58,480 --> 03:10:59,340
Oh, this way.

5195
03:11:03,160 --> 03:11:03,580
Alright.

5196
03:11:03,580 --> 03:11:04,000
Nice.

5197
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:05,980
Here we go.

5198
03:11:06,380 --> 03:11:08,180
You think you're hot shit for getting through some of my forces?

5199
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:09,040
Guess what?

5200
03:11:09,140 --> 03:11:10,880
I got plenty more where that came from, you kids!

5201
03:11:12,560 --> 03:11:14,960
Oh my god, now I actually have to dodge!

5202
03:11:15,520 --> 03:11:15,940
No!

5203
03:11:17,460 --> 03:11:19,000
There's too many children!

5204
03:11:20,620 --> 03:11:22,260
Oh, what's the bullshit this time?

5205
03:11:23,620 --> 03:11:24,460
Projectile Hellstorm.

5206
03:11:24,700 --> 03:11:25,020
This is as far as you go!

5207
03:11:25,760 --> 03:11:26,680
Bullshit card in play!

5208
03:11:26,860 --> 03:11:28,180
All projectiles are multiplied!

5209
03:11:28,180 --> 03:11:28,580
Woah!

5210
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:30,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5211
03:11:30,600 --> 03:11:31,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5212
03:11:31,740 --> 03:11:32,220
It's okay.

5213
03:11:32,340 --> 03:11:34,020
We gotta kill all the bow and arrow kids.

5214
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:35,600
It's alright.

5215
03:11:36,220 --> 03:11:37,300
I see you.

5216
03:11:38,460 --> 03:11:38,980
It's okay.

5217
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:39,540
Dodge.

5218
03:11:40,400 --> 03:11:40,820
Dodge.

5219
03:11:40,960 --> 03:11:41,920
Oh, wait.

5220
03:11:42,060 --> 03:11:42,460
Shield!

5221
03:11:42,680 --> 03:11:43,100
Shield!

5222
03:11:44,120 --> 03:11:44,540
Shield!

5223
03:11:44,600 --> 03:11:44,780
Oh!

5224
03:11:45,360 --> 03:11:47,140
Wait, you're not in bow and arrow!

5225
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:50,220
Alright.

5226
03:11:50,220 --> 03:11:50,860
That's okay.

5227
03:11:51,420 --> 03:11:52,060
That's okay.

5228
03:11:52,120 --> 03:11:55,380
My very real dragoons fell down so they can't res me.

5229
03:11:58,180 --> 03:11:58,640
Oh, I'm back!

5230
03:11:58,940 --> 03:11:59,760
I'm back!

5231
03:12:01,060 --> 03:12:02,340
Oh my god!

5232
03:12:02,620 --> 03:12:03,540
Alright, there you go.

5233
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:04,840
I'm just gonna stay here.

5234
03:12:05,740 --> 03:12:06,500
It's fine.

5235
03:12:07,160 --> 03:12:08,340
I'm gonna stay here.

5236
03:12:09,260 --> 03:12:10,540
Use my heals.

5237
03:12:10,920 --> 03:12:12,500
Get a little angie.

5238
03:12:12,920 --> 03:12:13,800
There you go.

5239
03:12:14,920 --> 03:12:16,560
Jesus Christ, these children.

5240
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:19,360
These children need a fucking...

5241
03:12:20,840 --> 03:12:24,160
These children need to get checked to see if they're on any steroids.

5242
03:12:24,360 --> 03:12:25,020
Holy fuck.

5243
03:12:25,980 --> 03:12:28,160
What is this dark matter that makes this...

5244
03:12:28,160 --> 03:12:28,800
What's making them so strong?

5245
03:12:29,080 --> 03:12:30,820
I don't understand.

5246
03:12:34,120 --> 03:12:36,160
Like, what's making them so strong?

5247
03:12:37,100 --> 03:12:38,560
Dark matter should not...

5248
03:12:38,560 --> 03:12:41,180
You should be like in the bathroom right now.

5249
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:43,440
Alright.

5250
03:12:44,820 --> 03:12:45,300
Nice.

5251
03:12:45,320 --> 03:12:45,540
Okay.

5252
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:46,440
Oh, god.

5253
03:12:46,500 --> 03:12:46,780
Please.

5254
03:12:46,880 --> 03:12:47,800
Get her away from me.

5255
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:48,960
Get her off me.

5256
03:12:49,680 --> 03:12:50,820
Get her off me!

5257
03:12:53,740 --> 03:12:54,220
Nice.

5258
03:12:55,220 --> 03:12:55,700
Nice.

5259
03:12:55,880 --> 03:12:56,440
We did it.

5260
03:12:56,960 --> 03:12:58,140
We got the dark matter.

5261
03:12:58,140 --> 03:12:58,420
Matter.

5262
03:12:58,840 --> 03:12:59,840
Jimmy, please.

5263
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:03,020
Jimmy, where are you?

5264
03:13:03,020 --> 03:13:03,440
Jimmy?

5265
03:13:04,180 --> 03:13:06,220
Jimmy, do you have napalm?

5266
03:13:10,220 --> 03:13:10,740
No!

5267
03:13:10,740 --> 03:13:12,380
Okay, we need napalm.

5268
03:13:12,400 --> 03:13:12,920
Reshuffle.

5269
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:17,940
Beefcake?

5270
03:13:17,940 --> 03:13:19,880
Increases your max- Okay, no, not that.

5271
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:23,800
The bubble shield heals 2% health to all inside of it.

5272
03:13:23,880 --> 03:13:24,480
What about me?

5273
03:13:25,700 --> 03:13:27,120
I want you to heal me!

5274
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:31,140
What about me though?

5275
03:13:31,640 --> 03:13:36,720
We'll do Beefcake.

5276
03:13:37,730 --> 03:13:41,820
Oh my god, he doesn't have napalm!

5277
03:13:42,690 --> 03:13:44,220
But what about me?

5278
03:13:46,490 --> 03:13:48,320
I don't care about my allies!

5279
03:13:54,020 --> 03:13:57,000
It just says plus 2 for my allies!

5280
03:13:58,170 --> 03:13:59,680
It doesn't even say plus 2.

5281
03:13:59,700 --> 03:14:00,140
That's me!

5282
03:14:02,380 --> 03:14:04,400
Alright, we'll grab some toilet paper.

5283
03:14:05,860 --> 03:14:07,260
That's okay, I got Beefcake.

5284
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:11,180
You're in the team.

5285
03:14:11,280 --> 03:14:13,280
There is no- But it said allies!

5286
03:14:15,020 --> 03:14:16,820
I don't know, I don't trust it.

5287
03:14:17,560 --> 03:14:19,280
Wait, there's necromancers?

5288
03:14:21,260 --> 03:14:21,780
Oh!

5289
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:24,100
That's a forbidden spell!

5290
03:14:24,100 --> 03:14:28,560
Oh, you gotta kill those necromancers dude, or they'll just keep reviving the guys that you knocked out!

5291
03:14:28,820 --> 03:14:28,980
Which one?

5292
03:14:29,100 --> 03:14:29,280
Oh!

5293
03:14:30,840 --> 03:14:31,280
Friends!

5294
03:14:33,800 --> 03:14:35,000
Real dragoons help!

5295
03:14:35,920 --> 03:14:37,040
Real dragoons help!

5296
03:14:37,920 --> 03:14:39,800
Player 1, they almost had you dude!

5297
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:41,260
It's okay, we're okay, we're okay.

5298
03:14:41,700 --> 03:14:42,360
We're okay.

5299
03:14:43,660 --> 03:14:45,820
Alright, we gotta kill them.

5300
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:48,280
Why do I only have 2 real dragoons?

5301
03:14:48,680 --> 03:14:49,760
It shouldn't matter!

5302
03:14:52,040 --> 03:14:52,480
What?

5303
03:14:52,640 --> 03:14:53,000
What?

5304
03:14:54,100 --> 03:14:54,720
Oh god.

5305
03:14:54,820 --> 03:14:55,480
Okay, here we go.

5306
03:14:56,140 --> 03:14:56,900
We got him.

5307
03:14:57,620 --> 03:14:59,040
Oh my god, get over here.

5308
03:14:59,780 --> 03:15:00,860
Get over here.

5309
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:04,640
Get over here, mage necromancer.

5310
03:15:06,320 --> 03:15:07,640
You're breaking the rules!

5311
03:15:08,160 --> 03:15:12,100
The fairy- Oh, the good part of fair- All parents never teach you anything!

5312
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:15,480
Alright, we got rid of one of them.

5313
03:15:16,400 --> 03:15:17,460
Defeat all enemies.

5314
03:15:19,120 --> 03:15:20,660
Always listen to the rules!

5315
03:15:22,620 --> 03:15:23,640
Alright, nice.

5316
03:15:24,500 --> 03:15:26,700
Wait, is that also a necromancer?

5317
03:15:26,800 --> 03:15:27,440
Yeah, he is.

5318
03:15:27,880 --> 03:15:29,340
Don't worry, spin to win.

5319
03:15:30,360 --> 03:15:33,960
Holy shit, I should have been fucking spinning since the beginning.

5320
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:35,780
Alright.

5321
03:15:36,700 --> 03:15:37,620
Up we go.

5322
03:15:38,060 --> 03:15:38,540
E.

5323
03:15:39,760 --> 03:15:40,580
We got E.

5324
03:15:42,680 --> 03:15:47,040
There has to be like- We have to like fight the adults soon, I feel like.

5325
03:15:48,920 --> 03:15:49,400
Okay.

5326
03:15:49,460 --> 03:15:50,640
Alright, see necromancer.

5327
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:51,820
Don't worry.

5328
03:15:52,100 --> 03:15:53,080
I'm spinning!

5329
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:54,600
Spin!

5330
03:15:58,320 --> 03:15:59,680
I'm gonna keep spinning!

5331
03:16:00,620 --> 03:16:01,220
Spin!

5332
03:16:01,260 --> 03:16:01,820
No!

5333
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:02,680
My spin!

5334
03:16:04,100 --> 03:16:05,400
Oh, not you.

5335
03:16:05,820 --> 03:16:06,740
Not you!

5336
03:16:09,400 --> 03:16:10,160
Fuck this.

5337
03:16:10,480 --> 03:16:11,700
Fuck this.

5338
03:16:12,180 --> 03:16:13,160
I'm gonna do it.

5339
03:16:14,860 --> 03:16:15,940
I've had enough.

5340
03:16:17,280 --> 03:16:18,400
I've had enough.

5341
03:16:19,140 --> 03:16:20,340
Get over here.

5342
03:16:22,860 --> 03:16:25,320
I can't fucking see but get over here!

5343
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:28,180
Wait, is that the necromancer?

5344
03:16:28,260 --> 03:16:29,360
No, the necromancer is dead.

5345
03:16:29,640 --> 03:16:30,660
Alright, I'm gonna head over.

5346
03:16:30,960 --> 03:16:31,900
Get over here.

5347
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:34,180
Get your ass over here, archers.

5348
03:16:34,860 --> 03:16:35,920
That's fucking right.

5349
03:16:36,780 --> 03:16:37,640
Spin to win.

5350
03:16:38,960 --> 03:16:39,720
Spin to win.

5351
03:16:40,360 --> 03:16:42,340
You can't fucking run away from me.

5352
03:16:42,380 --> 03:16:44,520
You're- You're projectile.

5353
03:16:46,540 --> 03:16:50,540
Alright, as long as the necromancer is dead, so I don't have to worry about them reviving him.

5354
03:16:51,820 --> 03:16:52,240
Alright.

5355
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:54,900
Man, I should've been spinning this entire time.

5356
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:57,420
Whoo!

5357
03:16:59,640 --> 03:17:00,560
Alright, heals.

5358
03:17:02,240 --> 03:17:03,700
Alright, if you get close, I'm gonna spin!

5359
03:17:04,200 --> 03:17:05,720
If you get close to me, I'm gonna spin!

5360
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:08,780
Oh, shit!

5361
03:17:09,080 --> 03:17:09,500
Alright.

5362
03:17:10,140 --> 03:17:10,900
I'm gonna spin!

5363
03:17:11,820 --> 03:17:12,480
Don't you dare!

5364
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:13,060
Oh!

5365
03:17:13,260 --> 03:17:13,680
Oh!

5366
03:17:18,400 --> 03:17:18,820
Woah!

5367
03:17:20,180 --> 03:17:22,120
I'm sure someone will pick you up any time now!

5368
03:17:22,120 --> 03:17:22,860
Oh, no!

5369
03:17:22,980 --> 03:17:24,460
NPC number four!

5370
03:17:26,500 --> 03:17:28,800
I can't... no!

5371
03:17:29,100 --> 03:17:31,220
I have to do that all over!

5372
03:17:31,560 --> 03:17:33,440
Are you kidding me?

5373
03:17:34,740 --> 03:17:36,280
Oh no!

5374
03:17:40,560 --> 03:17:42,220
No way!

5375
03:17:43,660 --> 03:17:45,540
No fucking way!

5376
03:17:47,560 --> 03:17:51,160
Number four dragoon, how could you?

5377
03:17:51,160 --> 03:17:54,460
How could you, number four dragoon?

5378
03:17:56,260 --> 03:17:58,580
I can't believe it!

5379
03:17:59,880 --> 03:18:02,540
Number four goooood!

5380
03:18:02,940 --> 03:18:05,840
There has to be somebody on chapter four!

5381
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:07,540
There has to be!

5382
03:18:08,840 --> 03:18:09,520
Okay.

5383
03:18:10,260 --> 03:18:11,260
Okay, wait.

5384
03:18:11,440 --> 03:18:12,380
There has to be.

5385
03:18:12,520 --> 03:18:13,440
There has...

5386
03:18:14,980 --> 03:18:17,820
There has to be somebody in chapter four!

5387
03:18:18,720 --> 03:18:21,140
Someone out there must still be...

5388
03:18:21,160 --> 03:18:21,740
... still be playing!

5389
03:18:27,960 --> 03:18:29,500
Somewhere out there!

5390
03:18:30,500 --> 03:18:31,320
Wait, no!

5391
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:32,920
Fuck no, not this chapter!

5392
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:34,700
Fuck I clicked any!

5393
03:18:35,300 --> 03:18:36,440
I clicked any!

5394
03:18:36,580 --> 03:18:36,720
No!

5395
03:18:37,680 --> 03:18:38,640
Where am I?

5396
03:18:39,820 --> 03:18:42,680
Wait, what the fuck?

5397
03:18:42,940 --> 03:18:43,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

5398
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:44,640
I'm leaving you.

5399
03:18:46,300 --> 03:18:48,160
I clicked the wrong one.

5400
03:18:49,440 --> 03:18:51,240
I chose any chapter.

5401
03:18:51,780 --> 03:18:55,000
There has to be somebody in chapter four.

5402
03:18:55,280 --> 03:18:56,860
There has to be!

5403
03:18:57,380 --> 03:18:58,020
Alright.

5404
03:18:58,520 --> 03:18:59,320
Let's see.

5405
03:18:59,540 --> 03:19:00,540
Desire chapter.

5406
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:02,000
Chapter four.

5407
03:19:02,240 --> 03:19:04,680
You must be somewhere out there!

5408
03:19:07,580 --> 03:19:08,840
Bye, Lakeisha.

5409
03:19:10,960 --> 03:19:12,540
I know you're out there.

5410
03:19:12,740 --> 03:19:15,540
I can't be the only one on chapter four.

5411
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:17,060
Where am I?

5412
03:19:18,380 --> 03:19:19,000
Hello!

5413
03:19:20,560 --> 03:19:21,920
Where is this?

5414
03:19:22,900 --> 03:19:23,520
What?

5415
03:19:24,300 --> 03:19:25,620
Where is this?

5416
03:19:29,380 --> 03:19:31,060
Where... Where is this?

5417
03:19:34,960 --> 03:19:36,020
Wait a minute.

5418
03:19:37,100 --> 03:19:38,100
Wait a minute.

5419
03:19:38,120 --> 03:19:38,700
I did it!

5420
03:19:39,420 --> 03:19:40,480
I did it!

5421
03:19:40,580 --> 03:19:40,860
Yay!

5422
03:19:42,920 --> 03:19:43,540
You make me kick the cunt!

5423
03:19:43,540 --> 03:19:43,540
Alright.

5424
03:19:44,860 --> 03:19:45,700
I'm leaving.

5425
03:19:45,860 --> 03:19:46,300
I'm sorry.

5426
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:47,220
I don't understand.

5427
03:19:47,220 --> 03:19:48,600
I know I'm so good.

5428
03:19:49,380 --> 03:19:51,340
I got someone who was like, Colorado?

5429
03:19:55,340 --> 03:19:55,960
Alright.

5430
03:19:55,960 --> 03:19:57,920
We're going to do spoilers off.

5431
03:19:58,460 --> 03:19:59,080
Alright.

5432
03:19:59,300 --> 03:20:00,300
Join game.

5433
03:20:01,040 --> 03:20:02,900
Avoid spoilers off.

5434
03:20:03,160 --> 03:20:03,400
Okay.

5435
03:20:03,440 --> 03:20:03,980
Chapter.

5436
03:20:04,100 --> 03:20:05,920
Because then I don't get any cutscenes.

5437
03:20:06,220 --> 03:20:10,300
I think by clicking that, I don't get any cutscenes.

5438
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:10,700
Okay.

5439
03:20:10,840 --> 03:20:11,680
I'm back.

5440
03:20:11,920 --> 03:20:15,400
I want to see the cutscenes for real this time.

5441
03:20:20,660 --> 03:20:21,500
What?

5442
03:20:23,700 --> 03:20:24,120
No!

5443
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:27,960
You're the only one on chapter four.

5444
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:30,740
You cannot be the only one.

5445
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:31,740
You can't...

5446
03:20:33,360 --> 03:20:34,800
There's no way.

5447
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:38,660
How are you the only guy in chapter four?

5448
03:20:39,740 --> 03:20:41,900
He's the same person.

5449
03:20:43,080 --> 03:20:44,620
There's no way.

5450
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:48,860
There's no way he's the only person in chapter four.

5451
03:20:48,860 --> 03:20:49,380
Chapter 4!

5452
03:20:49,520 --> 03:20:52,020
The only person on there.

5453
03:20:52,120 --> 03:20:52,320
Okay.

5454
03:20:52,480 --> 03:20:53,080
Alright.

5455
03:20:53,480 --> 03:20:54,560
Chapter 4.

5456
03:20:55,320 --> 03:20:57,760
Has to be a different guy at that point.

5457
03:21:00,340 --> 03:21:02,020
The only other Canadian.

5458
03:21:05,220 --> 03:21:07,280
They have to be so confused.

5459
03:21:08,040 --> 03:21:09,040
Oh my god!

5460
03:21:10,640 --> 03:21:11,660
Oh my god!

5461
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:12,320
We did it!

5462
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:13,500
Guys!

5463
03:21:13,840 --> 03:21:14,340
Friends!

5464
03:21:14,640 --> 03:21:15,240
Hello.

5465
03:21:15,880 --> 03:21:17,880
I am here to invade your session.

5466
03:21:17,880 --> 03:21:18,840
Let's go!

5467
03:21:19,860 --> 03:21:21,000
Oh my god!

5468
03:21:21,060 --> 03:21:21,820
I knew it!

5469
03:21:21,960 --> 03:21:24,320
I knew I'll find real people.

5470
03:21:25,280 --> 03:21:26,860
We did it guys!

5471
03:21:28,360 --> 03:21:29,080
Let's go!

5472
03:21:35,460 --> 03:21:36,900
Look at that.

5473
03:21:37,280 --> 03:21:38,320
Real people.

5474
03:21:39,200 --> 03:21:40,280
I knew it.

5475
03:21:40,840 --> 03:21:42,100
I found friends.

5476
03:21:42,280 --> 03:21:42,800
Guys.

5477
03:21:42,940 --> 03:21:43,880
I did it.

5478
03:21:46,200 --> 03:21:48,980
There's no way these guys can fuck it up.

5479
03:21:49,200 --> 03:21:50,580
There's no way.

5480
03:21:51,160 --> 03:21:51,740
Let's go.

5481
03:21:52,160 --> 03:21:52,620
Guys!

5482
03:21:52,780 --> 03:21:54,300
I know where to go guys.

5483
03:21:54,400 --> 03:21:55,360
It's this way.

5484
03:21:56,780 --> 03:21:57,860
It's this way guys.

5485
03:22:00,100 --> 03:22:01,080
Don't worry guys.

5486
03:22:03,720 --> 03:22:04,400
Come on!

5487
03:22:04,440 --> 03:22:05,140
Get over here!

5488
03:22:07,880 --> 03:22:08,340
Guys!

5489
03:22:08,380 --> 03:22:09,160
Get over here guys!

5490
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:12,620
Don't worry.

5491
03:22:12,720 --> 03:22:13,220
I'm playing.

5492
03:22:13,500 --> 03:22:13,960
Guys.

5493
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:15,300
I know it says the number 3.

5494
03:22:15,300 --> 03:22:17,520
But it's because I decided to be generous today.

5495
03:22:18,040 --> 03:22:18,760
Look at that.

5496
03:22:19,840 --> 03:22:21,060
Defeat all the enemies.

5497
03:22:21,200 --> 03:22:21,820
Don't worry guys.

5498
03:22:22,900 --> 03:22:23,700
Oh my god!

5499
03:22:23,740 --> 03:22:24,440
We're actually...

5500
03:22:24,440 --> 03:22:27,180
We're actually in an area that I can figure out.

5501
03:22:27,340 --> 03:22:27,580
Oh!

5502
03:22:27,620 --> 03:22:28,500
I have the lightning!

5503
03:22:29,140 --> 03:22:29,580
Wait!

5504
03:22:30,160 --> 03:22:31,060
They like pick...

5505
03:22:31,060 --> 03:22:32,760
I have the chain lightning shit!

5506
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:33,900
Oh shit!

5507
03:22:33,940 --> 03:22:34,500
That's so good!

5508
03:22:34,980 --> 03:22:36,120
I love the chain lightning.

5509
03:22:36,840 --> 03:22:38,760
If we just need the napalm then we're fine.

5510
03:22:39,880 --> 03:22:40,460
Oh no!

5511
03:22:40,500 --> 03:22:41,720
We actually have the rez.

5512
03:22:41,960 --> 03:22:42,640
It's okay.

5513
03:22:42,640 --> 03:22:44,320
The other players can rez.

5514
03:22:44,620 --> 03:22:45,620
I'm the DPS.

5515
03:22:46,460 --> 03:22:47,400
Unlimited power.

5516
03:22:49,660 --> 03:22:50,460
Oh no!

5517
03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:51,120
I'm almost dead.

5518
03:22:51,600 --> 03:22:53,080
Almost unlimited power.

5519
03:22:53,820 --> 03:22:54,340
Ew.

5520
03:22:54,580 --> 03:22:55,880
We found the area though.

5521
03:22:56,180 --> 03:22:56,800
It's alright.

5522
03:22:56,900 --> 03:22:58,120
Somebody would rez him, right?

5523
03:22:58,640 --> 03:23:01,460
Like somebody would eventually rez that man, right?

5524
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:05,740
We're good.

5525
03:23:07,320 --> 03:23:08,000
We're good.

5526
03:23:08,200 --> 03:23:08,640
What the fuck?

5527
03:23:08,740 --> 03:23:09,280
Who did that?

5528
03:23:09,560 --> 03:23:11,340
Who the fuck is doing that?

5529
03:23:12,640 --> 03:23:14,480
Who is doing that?

5530
03:23:15,320 --> 03:23:17,540
I can't believe we found people.

5531
03:23:18,480 --> 03:23:19,440
Real people.

5532
03:23:20,200 --> 03:23:20,560
Oh!

5533
03:23:20,600 --> 03:23:22,360
I got better chain lightning.

5534
03:23:22,840 --> 03:23:23,440
Alright.

5535
03:23:23,500 --> 03:23:25,160
I guess we should revive him.

5536
03:23:26,960 --> 03:23:27,880
Who did that?

5537
03:23:28,340 --> 03:23:29,840
Who's doing that?

5538
03:23:32,280 --> 03:23:32,880
Okay.

5539
03:23:32,960 --> 03:23:34,280
We gotta get rid of these guys.

5540
03:23:35,480 --> 03:23:36,260
Oh look!

5541
03:23:36,320 --> 03:23:37,020
He's back to normal.

5542
03:23:40,540 --> 03:23:41,520
Oh my god.

5543
03:23:41,540 --> 03:23:42,280
I'm so paranoid.

5544
03:23:43,160 --> 03:23:44,180
Who's doing that?

5545
03:23:44,500 --> 03:23:45,480
Who's doing that?

5546
03:23:46,020 --> 03:23:47,860
I'm so fucking paranoid right now.

5547
03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:48,600
Wait.

5548
03:23:48,680 --> 03:23:49,100
What?

5549
03:23:50,580 --> 03:23:51,340
Why are the...

5550
03:23:51,340 --> 03:23:53,660
Why are the dead...

5551
03:23:54,660 --> 03:23:55,100
Wait.

5552
03:23:55,820 --> 03:23:57,300
The dead can do that?

5553
03:23:59,820 --> 03:24:00,260
What?

5554
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:04,520
Wait.

5555
03:24:04,660 --> 03:24:04,980
What?

5556
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:08,000
How come they didn't do that when I was playing?

5557
03:24:08,340 --> 03:24:08,780
Okay.

5558
03:24:08,840 --> 03:24:09,840
I know that one was you.

5559
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:11,860
I know that one was you number four.

5560
03:24:13,460 --> 03:24:13,980
Yeah.

5561
03:24:14,080 --> 03:24:16,960
But why didn't they do that when I was playing the game?

5562
03:24:17,980 --> 03:24:18,940
Oh god.

5563
03:24:19,160 --> 03:24:19,560
Please.

5564
03:24:19,800 --> 03:24:20,320
Please.

5565
03:24:20,600 --> 03:24:21,120
Please.

5566
03:24:21,240 --> 03:24:23,260
How do you turn it off?

5567
03:24:24,960 --> 03:24:27,000
Don't even bother resisting me you guys.

5568
03:24:27,100 --> 03:24:28,500
You're playing by my rules now.

5569
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:31,560
Oh it's one of the cards?

5570
03:24:31,880 --> 03:24:32,080
Oh.

5571
03:24:32,900 --> 03:24:33,900
That's a card?

5572
03:24:34,260 --> 03:24:35,180
But why?

5573
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:38,340
What does that even do as a card?

5574
03:24:41,700 --> 03:24:42,620
I can't believe it.

5575
03:24:42,620 --> 03:24:46,340
I can't believe somebody played far enough to know that that's a card.

5576
03:24:47,360 --> 03:24:49,780
Like somebody has like...

5577
03:24:49,780 --> 03:24:52,860
Has enough knowledge of the Snowballs...

5578
03:24:52,860 --> 03:24:56,920
The Snow Day game to know that's a fucking card.

5579
03:24:57,280 --> 03:24:59,340
How much did you guys play to know that?

5580
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:00,840
That's a good question.

5581
03:25:01,780 --> 03:25:03,540
Makes you go faster.

5582
03:25:09,220 --> 03:25:09,740
Alright.

5583
03:25:09,800 --> 03:25:11,000
We gotta get the chain here.

5584
03:25:12,620 --> 03:25:14,560
Bro this host keeps dying.

5585
03:25:15,540 --> 03:25:17,020
I'm the new captain now.

5586
03:25:17,160 --> 03:25:18,060
Don't rez him!

5587
03:25:18,480 --> 03:25:19,520
Don't rez him!

5588
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:20,680
Let him learn!

5589
03:25:22,400 --> 03:25:23,840
Let him learn!

5590
03:25:24,180 --> 03:25:25,060
Don't rez him!

5591
03:25:25,140 --> 03:25:26,360
Let me be the new player one!

5592
03:25:28,420 --> 03:25:30,120
Alright we have to feed all of these guys.

5593
03:25:31,500 --> 03:25:33,560
How many someone's willing to play that far?

5594
03:25:33,860 --> 03:25:35,000
That's why I'm here.

5595
03:25:35,300 --> 03:25:37,900
I'm playing it this far so you guys don't have to.

5596
03:25:37,920 --> 03:25:38,340
Hahaha.

5597
03:25:38,840 --> 03:25:39,280
Hahaha.

5598
03:25:41,700 --> 03:25:42,180
Alright.

5599
03:25:42,180 --> 03:25:42,340
Alright.

5600
03:25:42,360 --> 03:25:42,640
Nice.

5601
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:43,400
We killed everybody.

5602
03:25:44,160 --> 03:25:44,700
Nice.

5603
03:25:45,440 --> 03:25:46,380
We gotta go.

5604
03:25:47,780 --> 03:25:48,440
This way.

5605
03:25:48,900 --> 03:25:49,440
Jimmy!

5606
03:25:51,880 --> 03:25:53,320
Uhhhhhh... Molotov cocktail.

5607
03:25:53,840 --> 03:25:55,060
Drops a Molotov.

5608
03:25:55,140 --> 03:25:56,040
Is it worth it?

5609
03:25:57,120 --> 03:25:58,480
Drops a Molotov.

5610
03:25:59,780 --> 03:26:00,320
Uhhhhhh...

5611
03:26:00,320 --> 03:26:01,360
That's 68.

5612
03:26:01,940 --> 03:26:02,480
Wait!

5613
03:26:02,740 --> 03:26:02,920
No!

5614
03:26:03,020 --> 03:26:03,480
The spin!

5615
03:26:03,860 --> 03:26:04,840
The legendary spin!

5616
03:26:07,020 --> 03:26:08,020
Alright we got it.

5617
03:26:08,100 --> 03:26:08,660
Let's go.

5618
03:26:08,780 --> 03:26:09,060
I'm ready.

5619
03:26:09,660 --> 03:26:10,240
I'm ready.

5620
03:26:15,620 --> 03:26:16,100
Wheeeeeee!

5621
03:26:16,460 --> 03:26:17,240
I'm gonna spin.

5622
03:26:17,600 --> 03:26:18,560
Spin to win.

5623
03:26:19,900 --> 03:26:20,380
Okay.

5624
03:26:20,400 --> 03:26:21,360
Entering Main Street.

5625
03:26:23,960 --> 03:26:24,440
Alright.

5626
03:26:24,500 --> 03:26:25,960
This is the part where I died.

5627
03:26:26,200 --> 03:26:26,540
Hahaha.

5628
03:26:26,960 --> 03:26:28,020
I just got...

5629
03:26:28,020 --> 03:26:28,300
Yeah!

5630
03:26:28,340 --> 03:26:29,240
Thank you for the super chat!

5631
03:26:29,360 --> 03:26:29,640
Thank you!

5632
03:26:29,680 --> 03:26:30,060
Thank you!

5633
03:26:30,120 --> 03:26:32,960
Well this game has mixed reviews and I sort of know why...

5634
03:26:32,960 --> 03:26:34,020
I can...

5635
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:37,320
I sort of know why this game has mixed reviews.

5636
03:26:38,360 --> 03:26:38,840
Like...

5637
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:40,560
It's...

5638
03:26:40,560 --> 03:26:43,080
It's very obvious why.

5639
03:26:43,580 --> 03:26:44,180
Wait.

5640
03:26:44,180 --> 03:26:44,900
What the fuck?

5641
03:26:45,580 --> 03:26:46,820
Why didn't I...

5642
03:26:46,820 --> 03:26:48,980
Why didn't I do any damage to him?

5643
03:26:49,140 --> 03:26:49,720
Oh there we go.

5644
03:26:50,200 --> 03:26:51,340
That was so weird.

5645
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:54,260
I didn't do any damage just then.

5646
03:26:56,100 --> 03:26:56,700
Okay.

5647
03:26:56,820 --> 03:26:58,060
I'm gonna heal a little bit.

5648
03:26:58,760 --> 03:26:59,360
Okay.

5649
03:26:59,460 --> 03:27:01,260
The reviews were not wrong.

5650
03:27:01,340 --> 03:27:02,200
That's for sure.

5651
03:27:03,260 --> 03:27:03,860
Like...

5652
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:05,820
I know why it's mixed reviews.

5653
03:27:07,200 --> 03:27:07,800
Phew.

5654
03:27:07,880 --> 03:27:08,360
Oh shit.

5655
03:27:08,860 --> 03:27:09,460
Okay.

5656
03:27:11,320 --> 03:27:11,900
Don't worry.

5657
03:27:11,980 --> 03:27:12,360
I'm spinning.

5658
03:27:13,100 --> 03:27:15,940
At least I can hold the charge up when I'm moving.

5659
03:27:16,100 --> 03:27:17,320
Just screw those guys and go home!

5660
03:27:17,960 --> 03:27:18,380
Alright.

5661
03:27:18,460 --> 03:27:18,820
We're going!

5662
03:27:19,340 --> 03:27:19,960
Push up!

5663
03:27:20,280 --> 03:27:20,960
Push forward!

5664
03:27:21,500 --> 03:27:23,360
I need to go to the place where I die!

5665
03:27:25,320 --> 03:27:26,100
Keep pushing!

5666
03:27:26,840 --> 03:27:27,460
Oh god.

5667
03:27:27,520 --> 03:27:28,240
There's the...

5668
03:27:28,240 --> 03:27:29,300
There's the...

5669
03:27:30,180 --> 03:27:30,760
Necromancer here.

5670
03:27:31,020 --> 03:27:32,420
Oh it's cause of the shield!

5671
03:27:33,880 --> 03:27:34,300
Oh!

5672
03:27:34,300 --> 03:27:35,140
I understand!

5673
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:36,900
I get it now.

5674
03:27:37,080 --> 03:27:37,960
There was a shield.

5675
03:27:38,420 --> 03:27:38,840
Oh!

5676
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:39,440
I'm gonna die!

5677
03:27:39,440 --> 03:27:41,400
It must be a card or something.

5678
03:27:42,460 --> 03:27:43,300
Oh no.

5679
03:27:43,420 --> 03:27:44,220
Oh no.

5680
03:27:44,620 --> 03:27:45,100
No!

5681
03:27:45,600 --> 03:27:46,080
Woo!

5682
03:27:46,220 --> 03:27:46,520
Woo!

5683
03:27:47,080 --> 03:27:47,640
It's okay.

5684
03:27:47,720 --> 03:27:48,040
I'm okay.

5685
03:27:48,100 --> 03:27:48,440
I'm okay.

5686
03:27:48,920 --> 03:27:49,640
I'm okay.

5687
03:27:50,260 --> 03:27:51,040
I'm spinning.

5688
03:27:51,660 --> 03:27:52,620
I'm okay guys.

5689
03:27:53,280 --> 03:27:55,300
I need to press an E here though.

5690
03:27:55,840 --> 03:27:56,320
Guys!

5691
03:27:56,500 --> 03:27:57,120
Someone E!

5692
03:27:57,580 --> 03:27:58,340
Someone E!

5693
03:27:58,520 --> 03:27:59,380
You're down again?

5694
03:28:02,540 --> 03:28:03,020
Spin!

5695
03:28:05,020 --> 03:28:05,500
Okay.

5696
03:28:06,100 --> 03:28:06,580
E.

5697
03:28:06,820 --> 03:28:08,100
We need all the E's!

5698
03:28:08,240 --> 03:28:09,300
Put all the heals!

5699
03:28:09,300 --> 03:28:10,320
Right here in the center!

5700
03:28:10,720 --> 03:28:11,520
Double the heals!

5701
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:12,120
Wait what?

5702
03:28:12,320 --> 03:28:13,200
All data down?

5703
03:28:13,360 --> 03:28:14,680
We need double the heals!

5704
03:28:17,020 --> 03:28:17,460
Speedrun!

5705
03:28:17,840 --> 03:28:18,720
Wait what the fuck?

5706
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:20,280
Okay.

5707
03:28:21,660 --> 03:28:22,340
We're okay.

5708
03:28:22,740 --> 03:28:23,760
Oh this is good.

5709
03:28:23,820 --> 03:28:24,440
This is like...

5710
03:28:24,440 --> 03:28:24,920
No.

5711
03:28:25,120 --> 03:28:25,940
Not the bullshit.

5712
03:28:28,740 --> 03:28:29,500
Wait what's that?

5713
03:28:29,740 --> 03:28:30,840
How dare you oppose the Grand Wizard?

5714
03:28:31,120 --> 03:28:31,560
What's that?

5715
03:28:31,700 --> 03:28:32,140
What does that do?

5716
03:28:34,940 --> 03:28:35,380
What...

5717
03:28:35,380 --> 03:28:36,240
What does that do?

5718
03:28:36,420 --> 03:28:37,180
What do I have?

5719
03:28:37,420 --> 03:28:38,160
I don't know!

5720
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:39,060
This is not my session!

5721
03:28:40,580 --> 03:28:43,820
Oh I'm taking damage but I don't know what I'm doing!

5722
03:28:46,880 --> 03:28:48,420
What is it?

5723
03:28:51,620 --> 03:28:55,480
I wanna know what my bullshit does.

5724
03:28:56,120 --> 03:28:57,800
Oh I can run forever!

5725
03:28:59,260 --> 03:29:00,820
I can run forever!

5726
03:29:01,320 --> 03:29:02,680
Woah woah woah woah woah!

5727
03:29:02,860 --> 03:29:03,420
Heal time!

5728
03:29:03,800 --> 03:29:04,120
Woo!

5729
03:29:04,920 --> 03:29:05,540
Woo!

5730
03:29:06,100 --> 03:29:06,280
No!

5731
03:29:08,160 --> 03:29:09,540
My first death!

5732
03:29:10,280 --> 03:29:12,300
It's just like last game!

5733
03:29:13,620 --> 03:29:14,440
Oh oh!

5734
03:29:14,600 --> 03:29:15,140
Number two!

5735
03:29:15,200 --> 03:29:16,180
Number two I'm so important!

5736
03:29:16,400 --> 03:29:17,000
Number four!

5737
03:29:17,140 --> 03:29:18,140
I'm so important!

5738
03:29:18,740 --> 03:29:19,700
You know it!

5739
03:29:20,460 --> 03:29:21,180
It's alright.

5740
03:29:21,940 --> 03:29:22,540
Spin!

5741
03:29:25,440 --> 03:29:27,040
Just don't res number one!

5742
03:29:28,300 --> 03:29:30,260
We gotta establish a hierarchy here.

5743
03:29:31,820 --> 03:29:32,420
Okay.

5744
03:29:32,800 --> 03:29:33,400
Woo!

5745
03:29:34,100 --> 03:29:35,120
Nice I got a heal.

5746
03:29:36,440 --> 03:29:37,600
It's alright we're good.

5747
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:38,140
We're good.

5748
03:29:38,660 --> 03:29:39,920
And then last guy!

5749
03:29:40,260 --> 03:29:40,700
Woo!

5750
03:29:42,740 --> 03:29:43,600
What the fuck?

5751
03:29:43,640 --> 03:29:44,500
Oh it's the stealth guy!

5752
03:29:44,940 --> 03:29:45,380
Jimmy!

5753
03:29:47,760 --> 03:29:49,140
Guys can you kill the last guy?

5754
03:29:49,620 --> 03:29:51,060
Guys I need to talk to Jimmy!

5755
03:29:51,720 --> 03:29:52,640
There's one more guy!

5756
03:29:55,500 --> 03:29:56,580
Come on there's just one more!

5757
03:29:56,800 --> 03:29:57,640
You guys got this!

5758
03:30:00,200 --> 03:30:01,380
I'm number one now!

5759
03:30:01,760 --> 03:30:02,320
Oh nice!

5760
03:30:05,020 --> 03:30:06,440
Oh but what last?

5761
03:30:06,860 --> 03:30:07,840
Two percent!

5762
03:30:07,920 --> 03:30:08,120
Oh!

5763
03:30:08,120 --> 03:30:12,740
You need two seconds more when you deal... and you deal very pers... oh wait that's so good!

5764
03:30:14,020 --> 03:30:14,440
Nice!

5765
03:30:14,480 --> 03:30:15,060
I'll take that.

5766
03:30:16,040 --> 03:30:16,460
Yay!

5767
03:30:18,540 --> 03:30:19,700
Number one get over here!

5768
03:30:20,420 --> 03:30:24,700
God this is... guys... guys this is why we have to kill number one.

5769
03:30:24,900 --> 03:30:26,800
Like they're holding us back.

5770
03:30:27,280 --> 03:30:29,000
He's holding us back and you can see it.

5771
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:29,360
Look at him.

5772
03:30:30,320 --> 03:30:31,720
He doesn't even have cred.

5773
03:30:32,260 --> 03:30:32,860
Come on.

5774
03:30:33,180 --> 03:30:33,900
Look at me.

5775
03:30:33,980 --> 03:30:34,460
Look at you!

5776
03:30:34,620 --> 03:30:35,400
You have cred!

5777
03:30:35,560 --> 03:30:36,260
I have cred!

5778
03:30:36,940 --> 03:30:37,360
Hahaha!

5779
03:30:38,980 --> 03:30:41,320
They're holding us back and you know it.

5780
03:30:41,780 --> 03:30:42,880
You know it.

5781
03:30:44,120 --> 03:30:45,820
They are the host.

5782
03:30:48,080 --> 03:30:50,320
Yeah but that's only their job.

5783
03:30:52,860 --> 03:30:55,480
Being the host doesn't make you special.

5784
03:30:55,880 --> 03:30:57,980
It's... you have to earn number one.

5785
03:30:59,240 --> 03:31:00,300
Wait where do we go?

5786
03:31:00,380 --> 03:31:01,680
Survive all the waves.

5787
03:31:01,880 --> 03:31:02,600
Where are the waves?

5788
03:31:02,980 --> 03:31:04,120
Oh there they are.

5789
03:31:05,080 --> 03:31:06,220
There are the waves.

5790
03:31:07,120 --> 03:31:08,100
Don't worry I'm heading back.

5791
03:31:08,100 --> 03:31:08,260
I'm heading over.

5792
03:31:08,460 --> 03:31:09,100
Spin!

5793
03:31:11,060 --> 03:31:11,860
Don't worry.

5794
03:31:11,980 --> 03:31:13,400
The moment I keep spinning...

5795
03:31:13,400 --> 03:31:13,720
Spin!

5796
03:31:14,140 --> 03:31:14,780
Oh no!

5797
03:31:15,480 --> 03:31:16,280
Oh no!

5798
03:31:16,460 --> 03:31:16,680
Oh no!

5799
03:31:16,680 --> 03:31:16,740
Oh no!

5800
03:31:17,500 --> 03:31:18,140
Spin!

5801
03:31:19,460 --> 03:31:21,180
Oh my god!

5802
03:31:21,980 --> 03:31:24,140
This is such an OP attack.

5803
03:31:24,760 --> 03:31:26,440
This is actually so OP.

5804
03:31:27,160 --> 03:31:27,880
Holy shit.

5805
03:31:28,220 --> 03:31:31,380
I put shields and then I spin.

5806
03:31:32,060 --> 03:31:32,700
Spin!

5807
03:31:34,600 --> 03:31:35,240
Eh.

5808
03:31:36,300 --> 03:31:37,040
Don't worry.

5809
03:31:37,140 --> 03:31:38,080
I'm going to get you.

5810
03:31:39,840 --> 03:31:40,400
Spin!

5811
03:31:40,580 --> 03:31:41,000
Spin!

5812
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:41,240
Oh shit.

5813
03:31:41,840 --> 03:31:42,400
Spin!

5814
03:31:42,960 --> 03:31:43,520
Spin!

5815
03:31:45,840 --> 03:31:47,540
Oh my god that's a lot of people.

5816
03:31:48,020 --> 03:31:48,540
Woo!

5817
03:31:50,380 --> 03:31:51,400
You're getting carried.

5818
03:31:51,700 --> 03:31:52,900
You're all getting carried.

5819
03:31:53,680 --> 03:31:55,400
You're getting carried by a real gamer.

5820
03:31:55,480 --> 03:31:56,420
I played on hard difficulty.

5821
03:31:56,960 --> 03:31:57,820
This is baby.

5822
03:31:58,380 --> 03:31:59,680
This is baby level.

5823
03:32:02,760 --> 03:32:04,600
Okay gotta get the bubble though.

5824
03:32:06,420 --> 03:32:06,980
Okay.

5825
03:32:07,020 --> 03:32:07,320
Okay.

5826
03:32:07,520 --> 03:32:08,080
Okay.

5827
03:32:08,100 --> 03:32:08,920
Spin!

5828
03:32:10,240 --> 03:32:11,100
Let it rip.

5829
03:32:11,820 --> 03:32:13,420
It's like Beyblade all over again.

5830
03:32:14,800 --> 03:32:15,760
Oh god please!

5831
03:32:17,020 --> 03:32:17,640
Last guy!

5832
03:32:18,140 --> 03:32:18,920
Last one!

5833
03:32:19,500 --> 03:32:20,080
Wait no.

5834
03:32:20,620 --> 03:32:21,440
Wait is that really?

5835
03:32:22,360 --> 03:32:23,220
Is there more?

5836
03:32:24,740 --> 03:32:26,460
Where's the la- oh over there.

5837
03:32:26,680 --> 03:32:27,460
Guys on me!

5838
03:32:28,100 --> 03:32:28,740
On me!

5839
03:32:28,820 --> 03:32:30,060
You can't hear me but on me!

5840
03:32:32,100 --> 03:32:32,580
Beyblade.

5841
03:32:33,040 --> 03:32:34,300
It's time to Beyblade.

5842
03:32:35,380 --> 03:32:36,200
We have what?

5843
03:32:36,280 --> 03:32:37,420
Please get me out of here.

5844
03:32:37,600 --> 03:32:38,080
I'm going to get you.

5845
03:32:38,640 --> 03:32:42,800
We just have- we have two more chapters left.

5846
03:32:42,840 --> 03:32:43,500
We're so close.

5847
03:32:44,560 --> 03:32:47,140
We're so close to finishing this game.

5848
03:32:47,760 --> 03:32:48,320
Spin.

5849
03:32:50,300 --> 03:32:53,220
Alright now I'll actually zap because I actually don't know where they are.

5850
03:32:53,420 --> 03:32:54,780
I lost track of people.

5851
03:32:57,560 --> 03:32:59,000
They're going way too fast.

5852
03:32:59,780 --> 03:33:02,160
I can't be bothered to chase after them.

5853
03:33:05,080 --> 03:33:08,060
I can't be bothered to chase after this fucker.

5854
03:33:10,060 --> 03:33:10,800
Alright.

5855
03:33:11,020 --> 03:33:13,180
It's all the fucking stealth elves.

5856
03:33:13,640 --> 03:33:15,380
Bro you're not cool!

5857
03:33:16,770 --> 03:33:17,140
Alright.

5858
03:33:17,770 --> 03:33:18,560
We gotta help.

5859
03:33:18,880 --> 03:33:20,120
We gotta help these two.

5860
03:33:20,790 --> 03:33:21,160
Alright.

5861
03:33:21,360 --> 03:33:22,320
It's time!

5862
03:33:22,700 --> 03:33:24,280
For my secret weapon!

5863
03:33:25,940 --> 03:33:26,310
Woooooo!

5864
03:33:29,580 --> 03:33:30,320
Woooooo!

5865
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:40,580
This is like babies of urban times.

5866
03:33:40,580 --> 03:33:41,320
I think.

5867
03:33:41,520 --> 03:33:42,280
I think.

5868
03:33:43,540 --> 03:33:44,240
I think I'm gonna die.

5869
03:33:44,400 --> 03:33:45,560
All I'm gonna say.

5870
03:33:46,520 --> 03:33:48,280
Never go out of the formula.

5871
03:33:49,480 --> 03:33:50,700
Let it rip.

5872
03:33:51,980 --> 03:33:52,980
Oh god no.

5873
03:33:53,040 --> 03:33:53,920
Not the sixth graders.

5874
03:33:54,180 --> 03:33:54,680
It's okay.

5875
03:33:54,760 --> 03:33:56,400
They can't jump up here so I'm fine.

5876
03:33:56,900 --> 03:33:57,200
See?

5877
03:33:57,560 --> 03:33:58,400
They- oh!

5878
03:33:58,640 --> 03:33:59,180
What?

5879
03:33:59,660 --> 03:34:01,660
You're not even the sixth grader!

5880
03:34:01,860 --> 03:34:03,240
I'm stunned forever!

5881
03:34:04,660 --> 03:34:05,940
I'm- oh god.

5882
03:34:06,580 --> 03:34:07,140
Oh!

5883
03:34:07,280 --> 03:34:07,660
Oh!

5884
03:34:07,820 --> 03:34:09,180
I- I got poisoned.

5885
03:34:09,840 --> 03:34:11,340
I definitely got poisoned.

5886
03:34:11,620 --> 03:34:11,960
I'm so sorry.

5887
03:34:12,060 --> 03:34:12,280
I'm so sorry.

5888
03:34:14,260 --> 03:34:14,780
Alright.

5889
03:34:14,880 --> 03:34:15,400
Nice.

5890
03:34:15,800 --> 03:34:16,340
It's fine.

5891
03:34:16,440 --> 03:34:17,180
We got double heals.

5892
03:34:18,220 --> 03:34:18,740
Okay.

5893
03:34:19,160 --> 03:34:21,660
We gotta get rid of the sixth graders here.

5894
03:34:22,000 --> 03:34:22,380
Ow!

5895
03:34:22,700 --> 03:34:23,220
Wait!

5896
03:34:23,280 --> 03:34:25,020
He's like shooting his own people!

5897
03:34:27,620 --> 03:34:29,040
I don't need heals.

5898
03:34:31,020 --> 03:34:32,220
Okay maybe I do.

5899
03:34:33,420 --> 03:34:36,660
Maybe- maybe I do need heals.

5900
03:34:39,780 --> 03:34:41,780
Where the fuck is the last guy?

5901
03:34:41,960 --> 03:34:42,260
Oh!

5902
03:34:42,260 --> 03:34:43,500
Did we survive it?

5903
03:34:43,940 --> 03:34:44,860
Oh my god.

5904
03:34:44,880 --> 03:34:45,800
We fucking did it.

5905
03:34:45,940 --> 03:34:47,480
We fucking did it.

5906
03:34:48,060 --> 03:34:48,580
Oh!

5907
03:34:49,340 --> 03:34:50,260
We survived!

5908
03:34:50,760 --> 03:34:51,800
We made it!

5909
03:34:53,400 --> 03:34:53,920
Alright.

5910
03:34:54,080 --> 03:34:54,580
Let's see.

5911
03:34:54,980 --> 03:34:55,860
Rubber bubble.

5912
03:34:56,460 --> 03:34:58,980
It deals 8 damage to the attacker.

5913
03:35:00,020 --> 03:35:01,040
Do I risk it?

5914
03:35:01,160 --> 03:35:01,820
I'm gonna risk it.

5915
03:35:02,260 --> 03:35:03,760
I might have napalm.

5916
03:35:07,950 --> 03:35:09,210
God damn it.

5917
03:35:09,290 --> 03:35:09,470
Wait.

5918
03:35:09,550 --> 03:35:10,670
I can- I can risk it again.

5919
03:35:11,810 --> 03:35:12,330
Come on.

5920
03:35:12,670 --> 03:35:13,190
I can do this.

5921
03:35:13,190 --> 03:35:13,230
I can do this.

5922
03:35:13,730 --> 03:35:14,190
Come on Jimmy.

5923
03:35:14,950 --> 03:35:16,410
Don't fuck with me Jimmy.

5924
03:35:21,650 --> 03:35:23,710
I guess I'll think of the team.

5925
03:35:24,670 --> 03:35:28,090
I guess- I guess I'll think of the team.

5926
03:35:32,750 --> 03:35:33,790
There's Eric.

5927
03:35:41,110 --> 03:35:42,510
I lost the gotcha.

5928
03:35:42,770 --> 03:35:43,530
I did.

5929
03:35:44,990 --> 03:35:45,770
Alright Eric.

5930
03:35:46,650 --> 03:35:47,950
We're gonna catch you.

5931
03:35:48,010 --> 03:35:48,850
You're ruining the game.

5932
03:35:48,930 --> 03:35:49,110
You're ruining the game.

5933
03:35:49,130 --> 03:35:50,450
You're the one ruining the game.

5934
03:35:50,530 --> 03:35:51,710
What the fuck do you mean?

5935
03:35:52,930 --> 03:35:55,010
You're the one that's fucking up the game.

5936
03:35:56,430 --> 03:35:57,770
There's rules to this.

5937
03:35:57,890 --> 03:35:58,970
I'm skipping everybody.

5938
03:35:59,650 --> 03:36:00,330
Player one.

5939
03:36:00,510 --> 03:36:01,430
You okay now?

5940
03:36:01,510 --> 03:36:02,330
I'm gonna head over.

5941
03:36:03,210 --> 03:36:04,510
I went the wrong way.

5942
03:36:04,550 --> 03:36:05,830
Why did you guys follow me?

5943
03:36:07,870 --> 03:36:10,010
It was actually this way.

5944
03:36:10,770 --> 03:36:11,490
It's okay.

5945
03:36:12,450 --> 03:36:13,430
Find the traitor.

5946
03:36:14,090 --> 03:36:15,010
That's Carmen.

5947
03:36:15,030 --> 03:36:17,010
We already know who the traitor is.

5948
03:36:17,930 --> 03:36:18,650
It's okay.

5949
03:36:18,730 --> 03:36:19,110
It's okay.

5950
03:36:19,130 --> 03:36:19,510
There you go.

5951
03:36:19,590 --> 03:36:22,470
And I- three knows what's up.

5952
03:36:24,650 --> 03:36:26,830
I still don't know what this does.

5953
03:36:28,650 --> 03:36:30,690
What is this doing to me?

5954
03:36:32,490 --> 03:36:34,710
What the fuck does this do to me?

5955
03:36:36,070 --> 03:36:37,890
Oh come on!

5956
03:36:38,770 --> 03:36:41,150
We had to defeat them anyway?

5957
03:36:43,250 --> 03:36:45,230
This is fucked up.

5958
03:36:45,470 --> 03:36:47,530
We had- It didn't matter.

5959
03:36:47,530 --> 03:36:47,890
It didn't matter.

5960
03:36:48,030 --> 03:36:50,090
It didn't fucking matter.

5961
03:36:52,410 --> 03:36:54,770
We had to kill them anyway.

5962
03:36:56,630 --> 03:36:57,070
Okay.

5963
03:36:57,070 --> 03:36:57,550
See ya.

5964
03:36:57,650 --> 03:36:58,590
Oh I do heal!

5965
03:36:58,690 --> 03:36:59,510
I am an ally!

5966
03:37:00,630 --> 03:37:01,290
I'm ally!

5967
03:37:02,530 --> 03:37:03,190
Okay, don't worry.

5968
03:37:03,290 --> 03:37:03,570
I have spin.

5969
03:37:05,210 --> 03:37:05,650
Speeeeeeeen.

5970
03:37:06,190 --> 03:37:08,510
I can kill like three at the same time, which is great.

5971
03:37:09,110 --> 03:37:11,410
This is so... this is so good for me.

5972
03:37:13,010 --> 03:37:13,690
Okay, Q.

5973
03:37:15,290 --> 03:37:15,730
Q!

5974
03:37:21,570 --> 03:37:22,790
Oh god, please stop.

5975
03:37:22,890 --> 03:37:23,490
Please stop!

5976
03:37:27,480 --> 03:37:27,880
Alright.

5977
03:37:29,920 --> 03:37:30,680
Can we do it?

5978
03:37:30,800 --> 03:37:31,900
No, there's one guy left.

5979
03:37:32,720 --> 03:37:33,120
Stop!

5980
03:37:33,920 --> 03:37:34,320
Stop!

5981
03:37:34,400 --> 03:37:35,800
I know it's one of you guys!

5982
03:37:36,160 --> 03:37:37,580
I know it's one of you.

5983
03:37:37,680 --> 03:37:38,080
Stop!

5984
03:37:38,180 --> 03:37:39,640
I swear to god, please!

5985
03:37:43,500 --> 03:37:44,980
Now you're gonna get it, new kid.

5986
03:37:46,380 --> 03:37:46,780
Stop!

5987
03:37:51,640 --> 03:37:53,140
Alright, we gotta get Karmic now.

5988
03:37:54,700 --> 03:37:56,360
I'm a new kid trying to ruin my snow day time!

5989
03:37:57,060 --> 03:37:58,520
One minute, poopsiekins.

5990
03:37:58,680 --> 03:38:01,680
I just need to dab on a little more Christmas magic.

5991
03:38:01,820 --> 03:38:02,340
Oh no.

5992
03:38:03,320 --> 03:38:04,520
Oh no.

5993
03:38:05,020 --> 03:38:06,900
Not the Christmas magic.

5994
03:38:06,940 --> 03:38:07,940
Not the adults!

5995
03:38:08,280 --> 03:38:10,160
Not the adults!

5996
03:38:11,440 --> 03:38:12,040
Oh!

5997
03:38:12,300 --> 03:38:13,780
Holy shit!

5998
03:38:14,320 --> 03:38:14,920
Bro!

5999
03:38:15,760 --> 03:38:17,420
This is serious.

6000
03:38:18,860 --> 03:38:20,520
This is actually serious.

6001
03:38:21,520 --> 03:38:22,660
It's okay, I can spin.

6002
03:38:23,300 --> 03:38:25,320
This is why you get the Doki Carry.

6003
03:38:27,920 --> 03:38:28,520
Bam!

6004
03:38:28,520 --> 03:38:29,120
Instant.

6005
03:38:29,640 --> 03:38:30,760
Wait, we did it!

6006
03:38:31,340 --> 03:38:32,500
Wait, we killed him!

6007
03:38:32,740 --> 03:38:34,200
So fucking easy.

6008
03:38:35,480 --> 03:38:38,320
I hate... I... I don't understand!

6009
03:38:38,580 --> 03:38:44,340
I don't understand why, like, this host has this fucking lobby.

6010
03:38:48,040 --> 03:38:50,320
Bro, the adults can actually kill you!

6011
03:38:52,400 --> 03:38:53,640
Alright, where do we go?

6012
03:38:54,140 --> 03:38:56,600
Oh, we have to go... actually...

6013
03:38:56,600 --> 03:38:58,100
Oh my gosh, there's more adults?

6014
03:38:59,340 --> 03:39:00,360
There's more adults?

6015
03:39:00,940 --> 03:39:01,000
Oh!

6016
03:39:02,680 --> 03:39:04,380
That doll's gonna break my back!

6017
03:39:05,240 --> 03:39:06,240
Alright, here we go.

6018
03:39:07,320 --> 03:39:08,880
They're gonna start grounding me!

6019
03:39:10,580 --> 03:39:11,100
Woop!

6020
03:39:11,240 --> 03:39:11,980
Where are you?

6021
03:39:12,660 --> 03:39:13,400
Where are you?

6022
03:39:14,860 --> 03:39:15,580
Oh god.

6023
03:39:15,820 --> 03:39:16,960
Bro, she's like one!

6024
03:39:17,480 --> 03:39:18,720
Fucking kill stealer!

6025
03:39:19,420 --> 03:39:20,760
Okay, I'm gonna grab the arrows.

6026
03:39:22,000 --> 03:39:23,040
Alright, fuck this.

6027
03:39:23,160 --> 03:39:23,940
I'm using it.

6028
03:39:24,060 --> 03:39:25,340
I'm gonna fucking fly.

6029
03:39:26,860 --> 03:39:27,980
Oh, what?

6030
03:39:28,120 --> 03:39:28,660
Come on!

6031
03:39:29,720 --> 03:39:31,080
I'm trying to fucking...

6032
03:39:31,680 --> 03:39:32,780
I'm trying to fucking spin!

6033
03:39:33,440 --> 03:39:34,220
There we go.

6034
03:39:36,080 --> 03:39:36,640
Nice.

6035
03:39:37,520 --> 03:39:38,420
Is that everybody?

6036
03:39:38,840 --> 03:39:39,860
Who else is left?

6037
03:39:41,520 --> 03:39:43,380
I can fly forever now.

6038
03:39:45,220 --> 03:39:47,060
I almost got paid.

6039
03:39:47,060 --> 03:39:48,080
Bro!

6040
03:39:48,500 --> 03:39:49,780
Bro, it's no joke!

6041
03:39:49,920 --> 03:39:51,300
She can actually bait me!

6042
03:39:52,320 --> 03:39:53,380
Bro, I'm a child!

6043
03:39:53,780 --> 03:39:54,920
You fucking...

6044
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:57,040
Press my head!

6045
03:39:57,260 --> 03:39:59,860
You pressed the wrong spot in my head, I fucking die!

6046
03:40:00,900 --> 03:40:02,180
That shit is serious!

6047
03:40:03,820 --> 03:40:05,100
Oh, there's a Carven!

6048
03:40:05,180 --> 03:40:05,580
There's Carven!

6049
03:40:05,980 --> 03:40:07,360
There's Carven right over here!

6050
03:40:08,460 --> 03:40:10,260
Holy shit, he has venom powers!

6051
03:40:10,840 --> 03:40:11,220
Shit.

6052
03:40:12,260 --> 03:40:12,480
Oh!

6053
03:40:15,480 --> 03:40:16,300
Where is he?

6054
03:40:16,380 --> 03:40:17,040
Where's the fucking Carven?

6055
03:40:17,060 --> 03:40:17,340
Where the fuck is Carven?

6056
03:40:17,380 --> 03:40:17,600
No!

6057
03:40:17,840 --> 03:40:18,280
No!

6058
03:40:18,480 --> 03:40:19,340
It's this again!

6059
03:40:20,120 --> 03:40:21,980
Alright, get out of your fucking force field.

6060
03:40:24,260 --> 03:40:25,940
Get out of your fucking force field!

6061
03:40:26,420 --> 03:40:27,300
Get over here!

6062
03:40:28,920 --> 03:40:29,920
Get over here!

6063
03:40:31,100 --> 03:40:32,820
Get over here, you fucking archer!

6064
03:40:35,420 --> 03:40:35,860
Nice.

6065
03:40:36,680 --> 03:40:38,620
Oh my god, I need you guys to group up more.

6066
03:40:38,680 --> 03:40:40,220
I'm wasting my attack on one person.

6067
03:40:40,580 --> 03:40:42,580
I really need you guys to group up more.

6068
03:40:43,680 --> 03:40:44,120
Shit.

6069
03:40:44,480 --> 03:40:45,320
Oh, thank god.

6070
03:40:45,320 --> 03:40:45,900
There you go.

6071
03:40:46,340 --> 03:40:47,440
That's what I like.

6072
03:40:47,580 --> 03:40:48,660
Three for one special.

6073
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:53,320
Three for one special.

6074
03:40:55,320 --> 03:40:56,060
See, guys?

6075
03:40:56,400 --> 03:40:57,060
I'm helpful.

6076
03:40:58,220 --> 03:41:00,320
I don't know how I always get tricked into...

6077
03:41:02,120 --> 03:41:06,820
I always know that like, every time Carven runs, it means he has to...

6078
03:41:07,320 --> 03:41:11,220
It means like I have to defeat all the enemies, but every time it gets me...

6079
03:41:11,220 --> 03:41:15,300
Every time I forgot about that and I just run into like five different enemies.

6080
03:41:15,320 --> 03:41:15,500
Five different people.

6081
03:41:18,120 --> 03:41:18,600
Alright.

6082
03:41:19,560 --> 03:41:20,520
Wait, there he is!

6083
03:41:20,980 --> 03:41:22,780
Oh, he was a fucking clone!

6084
03:41:27,060 --> 03:41:28,640
I'm so OP right now.

6085
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:31,160
Okay, we need to go over here.

6086
03:41:32,380 --> 03:41:33,060
Are you good?

6087
03:41:33,420 --> 03:41:34,300
It's Carven time.

6088
03:41:35,100 --> 03:41:35,580
Finally!

6089
03:41:36,160 --> 03:41:37,420
Carven, get over here!

6090
03:41:37,660 --> 03:41:39,400
Take me to the next area!

6091
03:41:40,080 --> 03:41:41,120
What the fuck?

6092
03:41:41,940 --> 03:41:43,240
Bro, it's not fair.

6093
03:41:43,600 --> 03:41:45,080
I'm so stupid.

6094
03:41:45,080 --> 03:41:45,280
I didn't know that it was a clone.

6095
03:41:45,280 --> 03:41:46,140
Okay.

6096
03:41:46,720 --> 03:41:47,460
It's fine.

6097
03:41:47,900 --> 03:41:48,820
One and two!

6098
03:41:49,380 --> 03:41:51,160
One and two can handle these guys!

6099
03:41:55,160 --> 03:41:58,620
We run so one and two can handle the rest of the people.

6100
03:42:01,660 --> 03:42:02,180
Alright.

6101
03:42:02,180 --> 03:42:03,080
Get over here.

6102
03:42:03,400 --> 03:42:04,620
We have to defeat the sniper.

6103
03:42:06,400 --> 03:42:06,920
Alright.

6104
03:42:06,980 --> 03:42:07,660
Up we go!

6105
03:42:09,760 --> 03:42:10,280
Jimmy!

6106
03:42:10,280 --> 03:42:10,800
No!

6107
03:42:11,200 --> 03:42:12,300
Who's still alive?

6108
03:42:13,120 --> 03:42:13,560
Four!

6109
03:42:13,780 --> 03:42:14,780
Go and get them!

6110
03:42:14,960 --> 03:42:16,480
I'm gonna wait at Jimmy's place.

6111
03:42:17,080 --> 03:42:18,260
I believe in you four!

6112
03:42:19,260 --> 03:42:20,320
Go do your thing!

6113
03:42:21,160 --> 03:42:22,100
I'll be right here!

6114
03:42:28,200 --> 03:42:29,200
Bro, what the fuck?

6115
03:42:29,860 --> 03:42:30,380
Come on!

6116
03:42:30,400 --> 03:42:31,180
It's one guy!

6117
03:42:32,120 --> 03:42:34,160
I only got two and I was just like, whatever.

6118
03:42:37,080 --> 03:42:39,520
Look, I already did my job.

6119
03:42:39,640 --> 03:42:39,940
Okay?

6120
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:41,960
Did you not see me kill the three adults?

6121
03:42:42,700 --> 03:42:43,340
Come on!

6122
03:42:43,940 --> 03:42:45,300
There's still two more?

6123
03:42:46,460 --> 03:42:47,200
It's okay.

6124
03:42:47,420 --> 03:42:48,200
They'll be fine.

6125
03:42:51,440 --> 03:42:52,500
They'll be fine.

6126
03:42:52,740 --> 03:42:53,260
Look!

6127
03:42:53,380 --> 03:42:55,000
I can't keep doing everything!

6128
03:42:55,280 --> 03:42:55,680
Chat!

6129
03:42:55,820 --> 03:42:57,280
I'm not gonna do everything!

6130
03:42:57,780 --> 03:42:59,280
Let's just...

6131
03:43:01,300 --> 03:43:01,900
Yeah.

6132
03:43:01,900 --> 03:43:02,780
Let's go two.

6133
03:43:03,180 --> 03:43:04,600
You know what I mean, two.

6134
03:43:04,940 --> 03:43:05,660
Let's go!

6135
03:43:06,280 --> 03:43:08,380
What the fuck is one doing?

6136
03:43:08,860 --> 03:43:10,760
Bro, can one aim?

6137
03:43:11,720 --> 03:43:12,320
No!

6138
03:43:15,240 --> 03:43:18,040
I think one is like, not doing so well.

6139
03:43:21,520 --> 03:43:22,060
Yeah!

6140
03:43:23,020 --> 03:43:24,840
Oh, I got the zombie shuffle dance.

6141
03:43:25,020 --> 03:43:25,360
What is this?

6142
03:43:26,660 --> 03:43:30,700
The moving... I like how this is called the moving grooving when it's the Snoopy dance.

6143
03:43:32,220 --> 03:43:33,180
They'll be fine.

6144
03:43:36,140 --> 03:43:37,420
I'm not gonna get kicked!

6145
03:43:37,520 --> 03:43:41,580
They know... They know that I am the carry.

6146
03:43:43,580 --> 03:43:45,600
They won't kick me out because I'm the carry.

6147
03:43:47,660 --> 03:43:49,740
Ah, deploy a Molotov.

6148
03:43:50,220 --> 03:43:52,860
I want to see if I can get legendary.

6149
03:43:54,100 --> 03:43:55,180
God damn it!

6150
03:43:55,320 --> 03:43:57,300
Oh, okay.

6151
03:43:57,540 --> 03:43:58,620
Point percent bigger.

6152
03:43:59,300 --> 03:44:00,160
That's always good.

6153
03:44:01,460 --> 03:44:02,820
Alright, I'm ready.

6154
03:44:04,300 --> 03:44:04,900
Let's go.

6155
03:44:05,860 --> 03:44:06,680
Let's go two.

6156
03:44:07,480 --> 03:44:08,100
Come on.

6157
03:44:12,120 --> 03:44:12,620
Nice.

6158
03:44:14,480 --> 03:44:16,120
I got big, Bubba.

6159
03:44:16,900 --> 03:44:17,400
Big.

6160
03:44:21,670 --> 03:44:23,350
Hey, the Car... There is more?

6161
03:44:23,850 --> 03:44:24,830
Carmen, please!

6162
03:44:26,350 --> 03:44:27,250
I know!

6163
03:44:27,570 --> 03:44:30,590
This is when you know this is not realistic because Carmen would never run this far.

6164
03:44:35,490 --> 03:44:37,130
This is not realistic.

6165
03:44:38,330 --> 03:44:40,430
Carmen would never be up that mountain.

6166
03:44:41,450 --> 03:44:45,430
He'd be like... It would have been done after like the first two areas.

6167
03:44:45,830 --> 03:44:46,690
Oh, shit!

6168
03:44:51,020 --> 03:44:53,060
How dare you oppose the Grand Wizard?

6169
03:44:53,420 --> 03:44:55,060
The enemy played a bullshit card.

6170
03:44:55,060 --> 03:44:57,960
It's just because he really doesn't want to go.

6171
03:44:58,460 --> 03:45:01,340
He really doesn't want to go to school.

6172
03:45:02,780 --> 03:45:03,380
Unrealistic.

6173
03:45:03,460 --> 03:45:05,300
Carmen would never walk so far.

6174
03:45:06,080 --> 03:45:07,400
What is this?

6175
03:45:10,100 --> 03:45:10,940
Oh, God.

6176
03:45:11,060 --> 03:45:11,740
What the fuck?

6177
03:45:11,740 --> 03:45:12,860
Get over here.

6178
03:45:12,940 --> 03:45:13,840
You're nearly one.

6179
03:45:15,120 --> 03:45:17,380
My axe is not long enough.

6180
03:45:18,060 --> 03:45:21,120
He fucking went up the fucking roof.

6181
03:45:21,280 --> 03:45:22,780
All that for the roof?

6182
03:45:24,000 --> 03:45:24,640
Alright.

6183
03:45:27,020 --> 03:45:28,460
Where the fuck... Okay.

6184
03:45:28,660 --> 03:45:29,480
Get out.

6185
03:45:30,180 --> 03:45:31,120
Oh, my God.

6186
03:45:33,180 --> 03:45:34,840
I'm so blocked.

6187
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:35,320
What?

6188
03:45:37,260 --> 03:45:37,780
Bro!

6189
03:45:38,700 --> 03:45:39,220
Help!

6190
03:45:39,660 --> 03:45:41,100
I'm so blocked!

6191
03:45:43,800 --> 03:45:44,320
Bro!

6192
03:45:44,320 --> 03:45:45,560
This is not fair!

6193
03:45:45,640 --> 03:45:46,160
Oh, my God!

6194
03:45:46,200 --> 03:45:46,660
Oh, my God!

6195
03:45:46,700 --> 03:45:47,100
Oh, my God!

6196
03:45:47,140 --> 03:45:47,480
I'm okay!

6197
03:45:47,660 --> 03:45:48,420
I'm okay!

6198
03:45:48,540 --> 03:45:49,380
I'm okay!

6199
03:45:49,480 --> 03:45:50,160
Oh, he's gone!

6200
03:45:50,300 --> 03:45:51,140
He's gone!

6201
03:45:51,160 --> 03:45:51,580
He's gone!

6202
03:45:51,580 --> 03:45:52,240
He's gone!

6203
03:45:52,260 --> 03:45:52,540
He's gone!

6204
03:45:52,540 --> 03:45:52,840
He's gone!

6205
03:45:52,840 --> 03:45:53,960
He can't hurt me no more.

6206
03:45:54,120 --> 03:45:56,680
He can't... He can't hurt me anymore.

6207
03:45:57,740 --> 03:45:58,780
Holy shit!

6208
03:45:59,180 --> 03:46:02,260
I got fucking soft blocked so hard.

6209
03:46:02,260 --> 03:46:04,840
You went down that road.

6210
03:46:05,580 --> 03:46:06,460
Regretting it, aren't you?

6211
03:46:06,680 --> 03:46:07,480
They always do.

6212
03:46:08,280 --> 03:46:08,760
Alright.

6213
03:46:08,820 --> 03:46:09,480
Hey, Goff.

6214
03:46:09,820 --> 03:46:10,720
Hey, Goff kid.

6215
03:46:11,440 --> 03:46:13,140
Raise the level of all your upgrade cards.

6216
03:46:13,220 --> 03:46:15,020
Raise the rarity of the Chain Lightning card.

6217
03:46:15,520 --> 03:46:16,780
I'm gonna raise the level.

6218
03:46:16,960 --> 03:46:17,660
That's powerful.

6219
03:46:18,140 --> 03:46:19,700
So I can have bigger spins.

6220
03:46:19,900 --> 03:46:21,560
Thank your science for this moment of rest, new kid.

6221
03:46:21,980 --> 03:46:22,460
Alright.

6222
03:46:22,740 --> 03:46:23,500
It's time.

6223
03:46:24,260 --> 03:46:25,260
It's time, guys.

6224
03:46:27,680 --> 03:46:28,440
What is this?

6225
03:46:29,060 --> 03:46:32,670
Oh, this is it.

6226
03:46:32,910 --> 03:46:33,610
This is it.

6227
03:46:37,350 --> 03:46:38,870
It's time to kill Cartman.

6228
03:46:39,970 --> 03:46:40,730
Come on.

6229
03:46:40,850 --> 03:46:42,350
You must have known you were disposable.

6230
03:46:42,810 --> 03:46:46,010
And lucky for me, Mr. Hankey gave me some of his power.

6231
03:46:46,030 --> 03:46:46,850
Oh, no, Cartman.

6232
03:46:47,470 --> 03:46:49,030
No, Cartman.

6233
03:46:49,070 --> 03:46:50,210
That's not good for you.

6234
03:46:53,870 --> 03:46:54,650
Oh, no.

6235
03:46:54,930 --> 03:46:59,030
You don't want Mr. Hankey to attack the real Cartman.

6236
03:46:59,490 --> 03:47:00,350
Get him, giant meat!

6237
03:47:01,250 --> 03:47:02,510
Scream, you cat!

6238
03:47:03,770 --> 03:47:04,470
Oh, God.

6239
03:47:05,610 --> 03:47:06,370
Force Field!

6240
03:47:07,470 --> 03:47:09,870
I'm trying to head towards him!

6241
03:47:10,070 --> 03:47:12,550
Wait, he gets to have his Force Field too?

6242
03:47:14,950 --> 03:47:15,910
What the fuck?

6243
03:47:16,170 --> 03:47:16,610
Oh, no.

6244
03:47:16,670 --> 03:47:17,670
He doesn't get his Force Field.

6245
03:47:18,030 --> 03:47:19,970
That's like... that's just his...

6246
03:47:19,970 --> 03:47:22,130
Aww, that's just his projectile thing.

6247
03:47:22,550 --> 03:47:23,290
Oh, God.

6248
03:47:23,650 --> 03:47:25,210
How is he so strong?

6249
03:47:26,650 --> 03:47:29,390
Who let him have the illegal spells?

6250
03:47:30,230 --> 03:47:31,030
Where did he go?

6251
03:47:31,590 --> 03:47:32,250
Oh, my God.

6252
03:47:32,250 --> 03:47:32,690
He's over there.

6253
03:47:33,590 --> 03:47:34,450
He's over there.

6254
03:47:35,710 --> 03:47:36,190
Okay.

6255
03:47:36,730 --> 03:47:37,330
Don't worry.

6256
03:47:37,390 --> 03:47:37,690
I'm spinning.

6257
03:47:38,330 --> 03:47:39,110
I'm spinning.

6258
03:47:39,570 --> 03:47:42,530
He doesn't get sucked up into my fucking spells.

6259
03:47:43,090 --> 03:47:43,710
Oh, no.

6260
03:47:43,770 --> 03:47:44,530
Someone revive him!

6261
03:47:45,250 --> 03:47:45,730
Okay.

6262
03:47:45,850 --> 03:47:46,250
Nice.

6263
03:47:46,290 --> 03:47:46,770
Oh.

6264
03:47:48,190 --> 03:47:49,170
I got the Q.

6265
03:47:49,250 --> 03:47:49,690
I got the Q.

6266
03:47:50,870 --> 03:47:51,650
Where is he?

6267
03:47:52,070 --> 03:47:52,890
Where is he?

6268
03:47:54,150 --> 03:47:54,630
Please.

6269
03:47:56,530 --> 03:47:59,850
Where's the real wizard he saves as he's using the Force Fields?

6270
03:48:01,070 --> 03:48:02,110
Where is he?

6271
03:48:02,110 --> 03:48:03,750
I'm fucking using those.

6272
03:48:04,110 --> 03:48:06,610
Bro, he doesn't get sucked up into my Force Field.

6273
03:48:06,790 --> 03:48:07,770
So that's not fair.

6274
03:48:08,390 --> 03:48:08,870
Oh!

6275
03:48:10,310 --> 03:48:12,730
New kids, you have disobeyed the Grand Wizard.

6276
03:48:12,730 --> 03:48:13,350
Where is he?

6277
03:48:13,630 --> 03:48:14,430
And by the laws of Zaron.

6278
03:48:14,610 --> 03:48:15,030
Oh!

6279
03:48:15,170 --> 03:48:17,070
He was right behind me this entire time!

6280
03:48:17,910 --> 03:48:19,090
Bro, this is so hard.

6281
03:48:20,290 --> 03:48:23,690
So, if he's that difficult, how difficult is Mr. Hankey?

6282
03:48:26,490 --> 03:48:26,970
Okay.

6283
03:48:28,650 --> 03:48:29,510
Alright, there you go.

6284
03:48:29,810 --> 03:48:31,510
I'm just gonna use chain lightning.

6285
03:48:31,510 --> 03:48:32,710
This is not good.

6286
03:48:34,310 --> 03:48:35,430
Where are you?

6287
03:48:35,710 --> 03:48:36,210
What?

6288
03:48:36,450 --> 03:48:36,950
Again?

6289
03:48:38,650 --> 03:48:39,930
Where did he go?

6290
03:48:44,370 --> 03:48:45,690
Which one is he?

6291
03:48:46,570 --> 03:48:47,570
Which one is he?

6292
03:48:49,310 --> 03:48:50,710
Which one's the real Cartman?

6293
03:48:50,870 --> 03:48:52,050
That's not the real Cartman.

6294
03:48:52,930 --> 03:48:53,650
Oh, no.

6295
03:48:54,930 --> 03:48:56,310
He's the one that's running!

6296
03:48:56,730 --> 03:48:57,890
He's the fat ass!

6297
03:48:58,630 --> 03:49:00,270
Get over here, fat ass!

6298
03:49:01,510 --> 03:49:02,830
No, he's not the one running.

6299
03:49:05,450 --> 03:49:07,390
Oh my god, I can't figure it out!

6300
03:49:07,650 --> 03:49:07,910
Where are you, kid?

6301
03:49:10,210 --> 03:49:11,870
We killed so many of them!

6302
03:49:15,950 --> 03:49:16,770
Where are they?

6303
03:49:19,350 --> 03:49:20,310
That's the last one!

6304
03:49:20,610 --> 03:49:21,570
It has to be him!

6305
03:49:21,630 --> 03:49:21,910
It's him!

6306
03:49:21,990 --> 03:49:22,210
It's him!

6307
03:49:22,290 --> 03:49:22,490
It's him!

6308
03:49:22,670 --> 03:49:22,910
It's him!

6309
03:49:25,170 --> 03:49:25,710
Meteor star!

6310
03:49:25,770 --> 03:49:25,950
Okay.

6311
03:49:26,350 --> 03:49:27,530
I have a barrier, too.

6312
03:49:28,430 --> 03:49:29,410
That's fucking right.

6313
03:49:29,530 --> 03:49:30,010
Oh, no.

6314
03:49:30,070 --> 03:49:31,030
It's the noodle arms.

6315
03:49:31,630 --> 03:49:32,590
Oh, no.

6316
03:49:32,790 --> 03:49:33,670
Oh, no.

6317
03:49:34,390 --> 03:49:34,990
Oh!

6318
03:49:43,270 --> 03:49:43,870
Barrier!

6319
03:49:45,510 --> 03:49:46,110
Okay.

6320
03:49:46,750 --> 03:49:47,850
God damn it.

6321
03:49:48,010 --> 03:49:49,850
He keeps using barrier!

6322
03:49:51,910 --> 03:49:53,990
How can he be so angry?

6323
03:49:55,550 --> 03:49:56,310
He's won!

6324
03:49:56,390 --> 03:49:56,670
He's won!

6325
03:49:56,690 --> 03:49:57,010
He's won!

6326
03:49:58,510 --> 03:49:59,110
Nice.

6327
03:50:00,690 --> 03:50:01,870
Oh, thank god.

6328
03:50:03,190 --> 03:50:04,790
Thank fucking god.

6329
03:50:08,790 --> 03:50:10,430
Thank fucking god.

6330
03:50:11,030 --> 03:50:12,190
Thank fucking god.

6331
03:50:12,190 --> 03:50:13,170
We did it, guys.

6332
03:50:13,490 --> 03:50:15,250
We defeated Cartman.

6333
03:50:16,010 --> 03:50:18,050
We fucking did it.

6334
03:50:18,290 --> 03:50:20,710
One more chapter left.

6335
03:50:21,150 --> 03:50:21,490
One more chapter left.

6336
03:50:21,670 --> 03:50:22,870
You picked up a bunch of darkness.

6337
03:50:23,110 --> 03:50:23,710
High five, lady.

6338
03:50:23,850 --> 03:50:24,990
Look at me go.

6339
03:50:27,470 --> 03:50:29,290
Oh my god.

6340
03:50:30,570 --> 03:50:31,670
Look at that butcher!

6341
03:50:32,630 --> 03:50:34,310
Most enemies eliminated.

6342
03:50:38,390 --> 03:50:39,770
I knew I was gaming.

6343
03:50:40,110 --> 03:50:41,930
I fucking knew I was gaming.

6344
03:50:42,130 --> 03:50:43,950
I knew I was carrying chat.

6345
03:50:44,470 --> 03:50:46,130
Guys, we're at the final stretch.

6346
03:50:46,390 --> 03:50:47,570
We're almost there.

6347
03:50:48,010 --> 03:50:49,470
Stage strong, everybody.

6348
03:50:50,650 --> 03:50:51,130
Okay.

6349
03:50:51,850 --> 03:50:52,930
Everyone have a nice dinner?

6350
03:50:53,070 --> 03:50:53,990
Man, I am stuffed.

6351
03:50:54,150 --> 03:50:54,730
I think I ate too much.

6352
03:50:54,950 --> 03:50:55,030
Haha.

6353
03:50:57,950 --> 03:50:58,730
So, Coop.

6354
03:50:58,770 --> 03:50:59,610
Back to the game, I guess.

6355
03:50:59,610 --> 03:51:02,170
I believe we are about to join forces and battle Mr. Hankey, right?

6356
03:51:02,770 --> 03:51:03,470
Fuck you, Cartman.

6357
03:51:03,510 --> 03:51:04,310
We're not playing with you anymore.

6358
03:51:04,530 --> 03:51:05,850
Yeah, you tried to kill us with dark matter.

6359
03:51:05,910 --> 03:51:06,390
You're out of the game.

6360
03:51:06,610 --> 03:51:09,110
Well, except you can't kick me out of the game because I'm the Grand Wizard.

6361
03:51:09,710 --> 03:51:10,030
So?

6362
03:51:10,230 --> 03:51:11,850
Why can't we have a new Grand Wizard?

6363
03:51:12,130 --> 03:51:14,030
We know you're not gonna help because you still don't wanna go back to school.

6364
03:51:14,490 --> 03:51:14,950
He's right.

6365
03:51:14,990 --> 03:51:16,870
You were pretty adamant about not wanting to go back to school.

6366
03:51:17,250 --> 03:51:18,390
Well, I've changed my mind.

6367
03:51:18,870 --> 03:51:20,650
The truth is none of this is my fault.

6368
03:51:20,910 --> 03:51:22,930
I think we all know whose fault it is.

6369
03:51:24,350 --> 03:51:25,230
Whose fault is it?

6370
03:51:25,550 --> 03:51:25,870
Me?

6371
03:51:26,310 --> 03:51:29,590
It's been just a shit show of rules breaking and I got caught up in it just like you.

6372
03:51:29,590 --> 03:51:29,970
Like Stan did.

6373
03:51:30,150 --> 03:51:32,090
And just like the new kid does all the time.

6374
03:51:32,250 --> 03:51:34,170
But we have to find Mr. Hankey and stop this storm.

6375
03:51:34,350 --> 03:51:36,410
It's not my fault you guys are all bad at the game.

6376
03:51:36,830 --> 03:51:37,470
We should let him play.

6377
03:51:38,090 --> 03:51:40,390
He just wants to join us so he can betray us again.

6378
03:51:40,610 --> 03:51:42,230
I want to join you because that's the rules.

6379
03:51:42,450 --> 03:51:45,110
The losing clan has to join forces with whoever defeated them, right?

6380
03:51:45,330 --> 03:51:46,190
That's your rule, Kyle.

6381
03:51:46,370 --> 03:51:51,890
And I understand how important rules are because if we don't have rules, then the new kid's just gonna ruin the game like always.

6382
03:51:52,370 --> 03:51:53,410
He's got a point there.

6383
03:51:53,550 --> 03:51:54,330
What did I do?

6384
03:51:54,730 --> 03:51:56,530
We have to take Mr. Hankey down before more people die.

6385
03:51:56,590 --> 03:51:57,290
It's not my fault.

6386
03:51:57,490 --> 03:51:59,230
I'm just a better gamer than all of you.

6387
03:51:59,590 --> 03:52:01,770
I'm gamer of the year.

6388
03:52:04,810 --> 03:52:06,490
How is that my fault?

6389
03:52:10,230 --> 03:52:10,890
Alright,

6390
03:52:16,390 --> 03:52:17,770
let's see if we have...

6391
03:52:17,770 --> 03:52:19,110
Oh, we have everything unlocked now.

6392
03:52:19,690 --> 03:52:23,610
That seeks enemy and explodes after a short delay?

6393
03:52:24,150 --> 03:52:26,490
Wait, that sounds so cool.

6394
03:52:27,450 --> 03:52:29,530
That seeks enemies and explodes...

6395
03:52:29,590 --> 03:52:30,910
Okay, we don't need heals.

6396
03:52:31,190 --> 03:52:32,830
My team will heal for me.

6397
03:52:33,550 --> 03:52:34,030
Alright.

6398
03:52:34,810 --> 03:52:35,430
That's alright.

6399
03:52:35,850 --> 03:52:37,470
My team will heal for me.

6400
03:52:37,510 --> 03:52:38,050
Look at that.

6401
03:52:38,110 --> 03:52:38,710
Now I have drones.

6402
03:52:40,270 --> 03:52:41,950
Alright, we need the dark matter too.

6403
03:52:42,830 --> 03:52:44,150
Alright, dark matter time.

6404
03:52:44,330 --> 03:52:44,570
No!

6405
03:52:44,710 --> 03:52:45,450
They kicked me out!

6406
03:52:48,670 --> 03:52:49,150
No!

6407
03:52:51,630 --> 03:52:52,110
No!

6408
03:52:52,210 --> 03:52:53,610
I have one more please!

6409
03:52:54,170 --> 03:52:56,090
I replaced my heals!

6410
03:52:57,430 --> 03:52:59,110
They kicked me out!

6411
03:52:59,110 --> 03:53:00,690
I don't understand!

6412
03:53:03,930 --> 03:53:04,350
What?

6413
03:53:04,530 --> 03:53:06,130
They kicked me out!

6414
03:53:06,890 --> 03:53:08,570
I was carrying!

6415
03:53:10,890 --> 03:53:12,130
I was carrying!

6416
03:53:13,470 --> 03:53:14,590
Time to set a battle plan.

6417
03:53:15,370 --> 03:53:17,290
There has to be somebody.

6418
03:53:17,570 --> 03:53:23,170
There has to be somebody on the final game!

6419
03:53:24,150 --> 03:53:28,230
There has to be somebody playing the final chapter!

6420
03:53:28,230 --> 03:53:32,170
There has to be someone out there!

6421
03:53:36,980 --> 03:53:39,080
You're in the cutscene?

6422
03:53:40,340 --> 03:53:42,600
Why can't I watch?

6423
03:53:42,700 --> 03:53:44,240
What is this?

6424
03:53:44,760 --> 03:53:45,540
Why?

6425
03:53:47,780 --> 03:53:48,740
Leaving.

6426
03:53:49,200 --> 03:53:52,200
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

6427
03:53:52,440 --> 03:53:53,460
I'll be right back.

6428
03:53:53,980 --> 03:53:54,940
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

6429
03:53:58,420 --> 03:54:00,440
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

6430
03:54:00,440 --> 03:54:00,860
I'll be right back.

6431
03:55:06,520 --> 03:55:07,600
Alright, I'm back.

6432
03:55:08,020 --> 03:55:08,600
Alright.

6433
03:55:09,140 --> 03:55:10,680
I can't believe...

6434
03:55:10,680 --> 03:55:12,660
I can't believe nobody is...

6435
03:55:12,660 --> 03:55:13,480
Okay, we're just gonna...

6436
03:55:13,480 --> 03:55:14,720
Okay, here's the plan.

6437
03:55:14,940 --> 03:55:15,280
Chat.

6438
03:55:15,580 --> 03:55:16,860
You guys wanna try playing elves sometime?

6439
03:55:17,140 --> 03:55:18,380
We're gonna watch the...

6440
03:55:18,380 --> 03:55:21,400
We're gonna watch the cutscene from the beginning.

6441
03:55:21,900 --> 03:55:23,060
And then...

6442
03:55:23,060 --> 03:55:24,120
How come...

6443
03:55:24,120 --> 03:55:25,780
How come that fucker...

6444
03:55:25,780 --> 03:55:26,760
I'm so mad.

6445
03:55:27,040 --> 03:55:30,220
How come that person gets to have...

6446
03:55:30,220 --> 03:55:31,760
gets to have four players.

6447
03:55:31,760 --> 03:55:34,880
And then I get one real player.

6448
03:55:35,540 --> 03:55:35,920
Like...

6449
03:55:36,300 --> 03:55:37,800
That's so not fair.

6450
03:55:38,180 --> 03:55:41,520
How did they get four people to join them?

6451
03:55:41,780 --> 03:55:43,520
And I get one?

6452
03:55:44,660 --> 03:55:45,240
Like...

6453
03:55:47,520 --> 03:55:49,160
They weren't even good.

6454
03:55:49,620 --> 03:55:51,180
This is bullshit.

6455
03:55:51,340 --> 03:55:52,800
This is actual bullshit.

6456
03:55:53,140 --> 03:55:55,800
This is actual bullshit.

6457
03:55:58,620 --> 03:56:01,740
This person got four people to join three people.

6458
03:56:01,760 --> 03:56:02,860
Four people to join them.

6459
03:56:03,160 --> 03:56:06,920
The grand wizard now returned from his temporary but totally understandable madness.

6460
03:56:07,140 --> 03:56:08,560
The assault on Mr. Henry Stork is beginning.

6461
03:56:08,560 --> 03:56:09,380
They have friends.

6462
03:56:09,460 --> 03:56:11,280
I was part of that group!

6463
03:56:12,040 --> 03:56:13,100
The war is raging in the human balance of Elk Path.

6464
03:56:16,620 --> 03:56:18,100
He's the chosen one.

6465
03:56:18,120 --> 03:56:19,600
You're numbered for it.

6466
03:56:19,920 --> 03:56:20,720
Hey guys.

6467
03:56:20,840 --> 03:56:21,940
One at a time.

6468
03:56:21,940 --> 03:56:22,440
Guys.

6469
03:56:22,800 --> 03:56:25,060
Hiro, thank you for the five gift ships.

6470
03:56:25,400 --> 03:56:26,060
Thank you.

6471
03:56:26,060 --> 03:56:26,600
Thank you.

6472
03:56:26,660 --> 03:56:27,380
Hey guys.

6473
03:56:28,020 --> 03:56:29,220
Don't wait up.

6474
03:56:29,380 --> 03:56:31,080
There's still 33 seconds.

6475
03:56:31,180 --> 03:56:31,740
The choice is yours.

6476
03:56:31,760 --> 03:56:32,260
Guys, join me.

6477
03:56:33,000 --> 03:56:35,260
Don't wake up everybody.

6478
03:56:40,080 --> 03:56:41,760
We're almost there.

6479
03:56:42,980 --> 03:56:43,500
Whoa.

6480
03:56:47,280 --> 03:56:48,300
Ok, we're all here.

6481
03:56:48,380 --> 03:56:48,640
Let's go.

6482
03:56:48,780 --> 03:56:49,780
Wait, no we're not.

6483
03:56:50,040 --> 03:56:50,460
Guys.

6484
03:56:50,700 --> 03:56:51,120
Come on.

6485
03:56:51,780 --> 03:56:54,000
You don't want to miss the cutscene.

6486
03:56:54,340 --> 03:56:54,740
Guys.

6487
03:56:55,120 --> 03:56:55,640
Dragoons.

6488
03:56:55,960 --> 03:56:58,000
You don't want to miss the cutscene.

6489
03:56:58,220 --> 03:56:59,540
You're still playing this game.

6490
03:56:59,700 --> 03:57:00,120
Look.

6491
03:57:00,120 --> 03:57:06,440
Look, I'm playing this game to completion so that you guys can see the ending of this game and you don't have to buy it.

6492
03:57:06,680 --> 03:57:08,280
I'll say it now, I'm indie.

6493
03:57:08,540 --> 03:57:11,960
This game, it's mixed reviews for a reason.

6494
03:57:15,140 --> 03:57:19,180
It's only for my love of South Park that I'm willing to play to the end.

6495
03:57:22,060 --> 03:57:23,820
I don't buy this game.

6496
03:57:31,120 --> 03:57:32,840
Yeah, but he got cancelled.

6497
03:58:00,120 --> 03:58:02,280
It's endless winter or we're gonna have to end it ourselves.

6498
03:58:02,620 --> 03:58:03,560
You're too late.

6499
03:58:03,780 --> 03:58:05,320
This town and Amber...

6500
03:58:05,320 --> 03:58:06,200
It's shaky, yeah.

6501
03:58:07,960 --> 03:58:09,480
I'm in control now.

6502
03:58:10,140 --> 03:58:14,840
All I needed was one of you to use my dark magic and build up its power.

6503
03:58:15,160 --> 03:58:18,300
I'd put my money on Stan, but he fucked it up.

6504
03:58:18,440 --> 03:58:20,780
And I had to settle for that lame new kid.

6505
03:58:21,300 --> 03:58:24,800
Look at the way this little turd dresses and his stupid face.

6506
03:58:24,820 --> 03:58:25,060
What?

6507
03:58:26,220 --> 03:58:28,820
But I paid 20 extra dollars.

6508
03:58:30,120 --> 03:58:32,040
I have the season pass.

6509
03:58:32,040 --> 03:58:38,260
I have the season pass though.

6510
03:58:38,880 --> 03:58:40,680
Of this amazing game.

6511
03:58:43,620 --> 03:58:45,780
He's mocking my cred.

6512
03:58:50,020 --> 03:58:51,400
Oh no.

6513
03:58:52,700 --> 03:58:54,620
They have the priest.

6514
03:58:55,680 --> 03:58:58,160
I have the pre-order privilege.

6515
03:59:02,160 --> 03:59:02,760
All right.

6516
03:59:03,000 --> 03:59:04,000
Don't you children read the Bible?

6517
03:59:04,620 --> 03:59:05,420
Last wave.

6518
03:59:06,040 --> 03:59:07,140
Once the hour has come.

6519
03:59:07,660 --> 03:59:08,660
Leviticus number two.

6520
03:59:09,320 --> 03:59:10,380
That's not a real thing.

6521
03:59:10,560 --> 03:59:10,580
Uhhh.

6522
03:59:10,700 --> 03:59:11,840
It's in the underbridge tradition.

6523
03:59:12,140 --> 03:59:15,200
Are you saying Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo came out of Jesus' butthole?

6524
03:59:15,260 --> 03:59:15,780
Wait, what?

6525
03:59:16,500 --> 03:59:17,300
The holiest.

6526
03:59:17,500 --> 03:59:19,200
That is the power you're dealing with.

6527
03:59:19,420 --> 03:59:20,820
So beware his wrath.

6528
03:59:22,000 --> 03:59:23,560
Okay, I wanna be able to summon people.

6529
03:59:23,860 --> 03:59:24,760
So, what have we got here, Phelous?

6530
03:59:25,400 --> 03:59:26,180
Check this out.

6531
03:59:26,880 --> 03:59:27,540
What do you have?

6532
03:59:27,660 --> 03:59:27,680
That's that.

6533
03:59:28,560 --> 03:59:30,100
And some cards to upgrade our memory.

6534
03:59:30,120 --> 03:59:31,300
What does Mr. Hankey have?

6535
03:59:37,740 --> 03:59:39,440
Are you serious?

6536
03:59:40,020 --> 03:59:40,700
What?

6537
03:59:45,700 --> 03:59:47,060
They get...

6538
03:59:47,760 --> 03:59:50,680
They get so many fire arrows and ice arrows?

6539
03:59:54,200 --> 03:59:54,880
Really?

6540
04:00:00,200 --> 04:00:01,260
We're friends?

6541
04:00:01,560 --> 04:00:03,400
You're not leeching off of me?

6542
04:00:06,160 --> 04:00:07,840
We're actually friends?

6543
04:00:12,900 --> 04:00:14,000
Thank you, Lord.

6544
04:00:14,980 --> 04:00:16,600
Hell's past hospital.

6545
04:00:18,020 --> 04:00:19,200
Guys, see?

6546
04:00:19,380 --> 04:00:20,200
I have friends!

6547
04:00:20,380 --> 04:00:21,480
I told you guys!

6548
04:00:22,420 --> 04:00:24,440
I have real friends, guys!

6549
04:00:25,740 --> 04:00:26,720
Guys, look!

6550
04:00:27,320 --> 04:00:28,560
I knew they were real!

6551
04:00:29,420 --> 04:00:31,280
I knew they were real people!

6552
04:00:34,860 --> 04:00:36,220
I knew it!

6553
04:00:39,680 --> 04:00:41,440
Chad, I told you.

6554
04:00:41,520 --> 04:00:43,100
I told you they're real.

6555
04:00:44,940 --> 04:00:46,580
Alright, down we go.

6556
04:00:46,940 --> 04:00:47,300
Wee!

6557
04:00:47,860 --> 04:00:49,020
Are you friend?

6558
04:00:49,300 --> 04:00:49,920
Friend?

6559
04:00:52,920 --> 04:00:54,340
There we go.

6560
04:00:54,760 --> 04:00:55,440
What the fuck?

6561
04:00:55,900 --> 04:00:57,900
He just ran from me!

6562
04:00:58,560 --> 04:01:01,220
Guys, what happened to my real people?

6563
04:01:01,900 --> 04:01:03,240
My real friends.

6564
04:01:03,820 --> 04:01:05,800
Oh my god, there you guys are!

6565
04:01:06,360 --> 04:01:07,740
Real friends!

6566
04:01:08,880 --> 04:01:10,980
We've been waiting for you, you kids!

6567
04:01:11,040 --> 04:01:12,420
There you are, guys!

6568
04:01:13,240 --> 04:01:14,760
I knew you were real!

6569
04:01:15,580 --> 04:01:17,600
How did... from four...

6570
04:01:17,600 --> 04:01:18,620
How did they leave?

6571
04:01:19,200 --> 04:01:21,740
How did my real friends left me?

6572
04:01:24,380 --> 04:01:25,860
I liked how...

6573
04:01:25,860 --> 04:01:28,220
I liked how, like, three of...

6574
04:01:28,220 --> 04:01:29,420
Like, two of them left.

6575
04:01:29,780 --> 04:01:31,780
Like, my very real friends.

6576
04:01:31,860 --> 04:01:34,260
Like, how you're not even actually real!

6577
04:01:35,340 --> 04:01:36,320
Oh, fuck this.

6578
04:01:36,360 --> 04:01:37,400
I'm sending in the drones.

6579
04:01:39,340 --> 04:01:40,260
Alright, guys.

6580
04:01:40,460 --> 04:01:41,780
I have an idea.

6581
04:01:42,460 --> 04:01:45,520
Guys, we're gonna return to the Koopa Keep.

6582
04:01:48,780 --> 04:01:54,860
Now that we saw the cutscene, we're gonna do an epic gamer move.

6583
04:01:55,540 --> 04:01:56,580
Watch this.

6584
04:02:02,040 --> 04:02:05,680
Now that we know what the cutscene is...

6585
04:02:05,680 --> 04:02:07,120
It's time!

6586
04:02:08,900 --> 04:02:12,000
It's time for the real gamer move!

6587
04:02:14,180 --> 04:02:15,260
Right here!

6588
04:02:18,340 --> 04:02:19,920
The pro gamer strap.

6589
04:02:20,020 --> 04:02:21,580
Please don't be in any cutscene.

6590
04:02:21,920 --> 04:02:23,960
Please don't be in any cutscene.

6591
04:02:24,260 --> 04:02:25,200
Hey, guys!

6592
04:02:25,480 --> 04:02:26,520
Oh, shit!

6593
04:02:26,640 --> 04:02:28,200
Are you just starting the new season?

6594
04:02:28,200 --> 04:02:28,900
You're gonna do chapter two?

6595
04:02:29,480 --> 04:02:30,500
Me too!

6596
04:02:31,800 --> 04:02:32,540
Let's go!

6597
04:02:37,920 --> 04:02:38,820
Hey, guys!

6598
04:02:38,980 --> 04:02:40,580
Wait, did you just finish it?

6599
04:02:40,740 --> 04:02:41,660
Wait, no!

6600
04:02:41,740 --> 04:02:43,520
They just finished the game!

6601
04:02:43,780 --> 04:02:46,380
I think they just finished it!

6602
04:02:49,940 --> 04:02:51,060
It's the one...

6603
04:02:51,060 --> 04:02:52,080
No, there's no way!

6604
04:02:53,000 --> 04:02:53,900
Okay, wait.

6605
04:02:53,960 --> 04:02:55,900
I think they actually just finished it.

6606
04:02:56,000 --> 04:02:56,980
There's no way!

6607
04:02:56,980 --> 04:02:58,540
There's no way!

6608
04:02:58,680 --> 04:03:00,300
Because, like, why is it daytime?

6609
04:03:01,800 --> 04:03:03,180
Why is it daytime?

6610
04:03:03,540 --> 04:03:04,340
I don't understand!

6611
04:03:07,100 --> 04:03:07,680
Okay.

6612
04:03:08,620 --> 04:03:09,540
This is it.

6613
04:03:10,200 --> 04:03:11,020
This is it.

6614
04:03:11,020 --> 04:03:13,180
There has to be somebody on chapter four.

6615
04:03:13,770 --> 04:03:14,840
There has to be...

6616
04:03:14,840 --> 04:03:15,520
Or, chapter five.

6617
04:03:16,080 --> 04:03:17,500
You're out there!

6618
04:03:17,720 --> 04:03:18,960
You're out there!

6619
04:03:25,700 --> 04:03:27,540
It's you again?!

6620
04:03:32,480 --> 04:03:33,080
Bro!

6621
04:03:35,660 --> 04:03:38,580
Why is there no one in your lobby?!

6622
04:03:38,580 --> 04:03:39,460
There's no one!

6623
04:03:39,540 --> 04:03:41,020
You're in the same chapter as me!

6624
04:03:41,120 --> 04:03:42,240
There's nobody here!

6625
04:03:43,040 --> 04:03:44,040
There's no...

6626
04:03:44,980 --> 04:03:46,880
The only player!

6627
04:03:47,200 --> 04:03:48,040
I'm sure you did another step!

6628
04:03:49,200 --> 04:03:50,280
There's no way!

6629
04:03:50,460 --> 04:03:52,120
You have to exist!

6630
04:03:53,020 --> 04:03:54,660
You have to exist!

6631
04:03:55,140 --> 04:03:56,100
Mr. Hayden, you white southwark off the map!

6632
04:03:56,580 --> 04:03:58,600
Well, no town, no seas!

6633
04:03:59,020 --> 04:03:59,620
Okay.

6634
04:03:59,860 --> 04:04:01,540
Maybe if I put normal.

6635
04:04:01,600 --> 04:04:01,900
Okay.

6636
04:04:01,900 --> 04:04:03,740
Maybe if I put...

6637
04:04:03,740 --> 04:04:05,080
You can't be on normal!

6638
04:04:06,660 --> 04:04:09,680
It's you again?!

6639
04:04:10,620 --> 04:04:12,440
Do you need a pep talk?

6640
04:04:12,620 --> 04:04:14,180
You can do it!

6641
04:04:14,380 --> 04:04:15,140
Alright.

6642
04:04:15,360 --> 04:04:16,460
Okay, guys.

6643
04:04:16,480 --> 04:04:18,180
Guys, we're just testing a theory.

6644
04:04:18,440 --> 04:04:21,100
We're just testing a theory.

6645
04:04:21,240 --> 04:04:22,000
Chat.

6646
04:04:22,080 --> 04:04:22,840
Alright.

6647
04:04:23,320 --> 04:04:24,760
There's no way!

6648
04:04:24,960 --> 04:04:28,780
If I'm on easy and it's him again, there's no...

6649
04:04:28,780 --> 04:04:30,900
No game was found!

6650
04:04:31,280 --> 04:04:31,880
I'm so sorry!

6651
04:04:38,780 --> 04:04:39,700
He's like...

6652
04:04:39,700 --> 04:04:42,360
He's actually the only one!

6653
04:04:45,580 --> 04:04:46,640
Oh my god.

6654
04:04:46,700 --> 04:04:47,480
Oh my god.

6655
04:04:47,540 --> 04:04:49,020
It can't be the same person.

6656
04:04:49,140 --> 04:04:50,540
Oh my god!

6657
04:04:51,180 --> 04:04:52,800
I knew it!

6658
04:04:53,160 --> 04:04:53,720
Don't worry!

6659
04:04:55,100 --> 04:04:56,220
I got cred!

6660
04:04:57,820 --> 04:04:59,300
It's okay, guys!

6661
04:05:00,080 --> 04:05:01,160
It's okay!

6662
04:05:01,280 --> 04:05:01,860
I got cred!

6663
04:05:01,860 --> 04:05:03,500
Oh my god!

6664
04:05:03,500 --> 04:05:04,660
Your new friend!

6665
04:05:06,500 --> 04:05:08,460
I broke the loop!

6666
04:05:08,660 --> 04:05:10,440
I broke the loop chat!

6667
04:05:10,580 --> 04:05:11,340
We did it!

6668
04:05:11,760 --> 04:05:13,820
We fucking broke the loop!

6669
04:05:15,640 --> 04:05:17,620
I can't believe it!

6670
04:05:18,260 --> 04:05:18,940
Guys!

6671
04:05:19,020 --> 04:05:20,840
We fucking did it!

6672
04:05:22,120 --> 04:05:23,800
Oh my god!

6673
04:05:23,920 --> 04:05:25,980
We broke the fucking loop!

6674
04:05:31,860 --> 04:05:32,980
Oh my god!

6675
04:05:33,020 --> 04:05:34,660
It's just where I left off to.

6676
04:05:34,820 --> 04:05:35,440
It's like...

6677
04:05:35,440 --> 04:05:39,180
I would have liked it if they were a little bit ahead.

6678
04:05:39,660 --> 04:05:42,780
But like, why would you play on hard and do this to yourself?

6679
04:05:43,140 --> 04:05:44,900
You played the other four chapters.

6680
04:05:47,180 --> 04:05:59,500
I think what I'm most surprised is the fact that these guys are willing to play hard on the last chapter after going through hard on the other chapters.

6681
04:06:00,200 --> 04:06:01,840
That's what I'm most impressed with.

6682
04:06:01,860 --> 04:06:02,060
Bye.

6683
04:06:07,350 --> 04:06:08,250
Kid Cannon?

6684
04:06:08,410 --> 04:06:09,610
Oh no, not the kids.

6685
04:06:11,270 --> 04:06:13,450
So Joki, thoughts on this game?

6686
04:06:13,590 --> 04:06:16,530
I know why this game is...

6687
04:06:17,530 --> 04:06:19,730
There's a reason why this game has mixed reviews.

6688
04:06:20,590 --> 04:06:21,190
And...

6689
04:06:21,810 --> 04:06:24,170
And it's very reasonable.

6690
04:06:24,590 --> 04:06:27,670
It's actually so fucking reasonable.

6691
04:06:28,390 --> 04:06:33,590
It is such a reasonable game.

6692
04:06:33,610 --> 04:06:34,010
It's such a reasonable choice.

6693
04:06:35,070 --> 04:06:36,210
Oh my god.

6694
04:06:38,070 --> 04:06:41,410
I'm playing this game right now to the end.

6695
04:06:42,010 --> 04:06:45,570
So you guys will not play to the end.

6696
04:06:45,650 --> 04:06:47,090
So you guys will know what it's like.

6697
04:06:50,990 --> 04:06:52,190
Oh my god.

6698
04:06:53,110 --> 04:06:53,990
Where do we go?

6699
04:06:55,670 --> 04:06:57,390
Guys, do you guys know where to go?

6700
04:06:57,730 --> 04:06:58,450
Do we... oh wait!

6701
04:06:58,510 --> 04:06:59,550
Fight your way to the top?

6702
04:06:59,630 --> 04:07:00,650
But how do we get to the top?

6703
04:07:02,670 --> 04:07:03,530
There goes through...

6704
04:07:03,530 --> 04:07:04,630
Oh, we have to go through the hospital.

6705
04:07:05,230 --> 04:07:06,390
There's way more shit up there.

6706
04:07:06,490 --> 04:07:07,110
You'll want an upgrade.

6707
04:07:07,530 --> 04:07:07,930
Okay.

6708
04:07:08,110 --> 04:07:08,510
What?

6709
04:07:08,710 --> 04:07:09,750
Why do we not defeat?

6710
04:07:10,310 --> 04:07:11,590
Alright, you guys go do your thing.

6711
04:07:12,570 --> 04:07:13,650
I'm just here to leech.

6712
04:07:15,310 --> 04:07:16,110
I wanna...

6713
04:07:16,110 --> 04:07:18,690
I wanna know what the fucking ending is.

6714
04:07:21,130 --> 04:07:22,130
You guys got this.

6715
04:07:24,270 --> 04:07:26,690
I am fighting the real fight right now.

6716
04:07:27,770 --> 04:07:28,570
Alright, let's see.

6717
04:07:28,610 --> 04:07:30,630
The drone no longer moves but deals 30 damage.

6718
04:07:30,630 --> 04:07:31,530
20% more damage?

6719
04:07:32,290 --> 04:07:33,870
Wait, how is that better?

6720
04:07:34,790 --> 04:07:37,590
Willow Shield is 20% bigger and does 12...

6721
04:07:37,590 --> 04:07:39,070
Okay, I feel like that's better.

6722
04:07:39,850 --> 04:07:40,330
Alright.

6723
04:07:42,390 --> 04:07:43,470
Please don't kick me.

6724
04:07:46,410 --> 04:07:47,750
Please don't kick me.

6725
04:07:47,770 --> 04:07:49,550
I struggled so hard to get here.

6726
04:07:53,090 --> 04:07:54,790
Alright, we need some toilet paper.

6727
04:07:56,370 --> 04:07:57,510
Don't kick me, guys.

6728
04:07:57,610 --> 04:07:59,110
I worked so hard...

6729
04:07:59,110 --> 04:08:00,290
to be here.

6730
04:08:00,890 --> 04:08:01,710
Where do we go?

6731
04:08:03,610 --> 04:08:04,570
What the wait for...

6732
04:08:04,570 --> 04:08:05,410
Did everybody upgrade it?

6733
04:08:05,410 --> 04:08:05,910
Enjoy these upgrades, new kid.

6734
04:08:06,030 --> 04:08:06,490
You've earned them.

6735
04:08:06,710 --> 04:08:07,450
Yeah, that's me.

6736
04:08:07,510 --> 04:08:08,090
I'm the new kid.

6737
04:08:09,090 --> 04:08:09,850
Where do we go?

6738
04:08:11,610 --> 04:08:12,810
Who still hasn't upgraded?

6739
04:08:13,370 --> 04:08:13,770
Three!

6740
04:08:14,070 --> 04:08:15,050
Hurry the fuck up!

6741
04:08:16,950 --> 04:08:17,770
I'm number two!

6742
04:08:18,250 --> 04:08:19,690
That means I'm next in succession!

6743
04:08:20,230 --> 04:08:21,890
Hey, where's the global warming when we need it, huh?

6744
04:08:21,990 --> 04:08:22,870
Wow, what a great audience.

6745
04:08:23,250 --> 04:08:24,730
What the fuck, Jimmy?

6746
04:08:26,830 --> 04:08:27,750
Oh, there it is.

6747
04:08:28,490 --> 04:08:29,170
There's a chest.

6748
04:08:30,870 --> 04:08:31,430
What's this?

6749
04:08:31,750 --> 04:08:33,290
Oh, bubble shield is bigger.

6750
04:08:34,730 --> 04:08:35,170
Okay.

6751
04:08:37,470 --> 04:08:38,350
Oh, shit!

6752
04:08:39,550 --> 04:08:40,250
I'm stunned.

6753
04:08:40,790 --> 04:08:42,050
I'm stunned and I'm bleeding.

6754
04:08:43,150 --> 04:08:43,710
Don't worry.

6755
04:08:43,990 --> 04:08:45,270
I'm sending out the drones.

6756
04:08:47,650 --> 04:08:49,210
The drones are gonna do stuff.

6757
04:08:51,030 --> 04:08:51,770
I go down?

6758
04:08:52,390 --> 04:08:54,210
I know this is fight your way to the top.

6759
04:08:54,350 --> 04:08:55,370
But I'm gonna head down.

6760
04:08:59,250 --> 04:09:00,130
Oh, nice.

6761
04:09:00,410 --> 04:09:04,190
I got when hit the bubble gains two seconds and make you more pissed off.

6762
04:09:04,290 --> 04:09:04,590
Nice.

6763
04:09:06,350 --> 04:09:07,290
That's my favorite.

6764
04:09:07,450 --> 04:09:08,770
Oh, wait, they're already dead.

6765
04:09:09,370 --> 04:09:10,190
Wait, what?

6766
04:09:10,950 --> 04:09:11,670
Did I...

6767
04:09:12,850 --> 04:09:14,130
Did I go the wrong way?

6768
04:09:14,270 --> 04:09:15,070
I did.

6769
04:09:15,810 --> 04:09:16,510
Oh, no.

6770
04:09:16,970 --> 04:09:18,090
Guys, don't kick me!

6771
04:09:18,170 --> 04:09:19,270
I just went the wrong way!

6772
04:09:20,250 --> 04:09:22,170
I'm heading to the right way now!

6773
04:09:23,090 --> 04:09:24,090
All right, here we go.

6774
04:09:25,190 --> 04:09:25,630
Guys!

6775
04:09:26,370 --> 04:09:27,530
Do not worry!

6776
04:09:27,710 --> 04:09:27,730
I'm gonna go to the right way now!

6777
04:09:28,890 --> 04:09:30,170
I'm going to contribute!

6778
04:09:35,210 --> 04:09:38,430
I'm here to contribute to the team!

6779
04:09:39,630 --> 04:09:41,470
Wait, these guys are actually pretty good.

6780
04:09:44,570 --> 04:09:45,250
Oh, my God.

6781
04:09:45,290 --> 04:09:46,470
They already killed so many people.

6782
04:09:47,050 --> 04:09:47,770
Wait a minute.

6783
04:09:48,410 --> 04:09:49,390
This is a team.

6784
04:09:50,510 --> 04:09:51,910
This is a team right there.

6785
04:09:54,510 --> 04:09:55,430
Where else do we go?

6786
04:09:55,990 --> 04:09:56,870
Oh, hey, more chests.

6787
04:09:58,550 --> 04:09:59,050
Nice.

6788
04:09:59,450 --> 04:10:00,470
We got the chests.

6789
04:10:00,950 --> 04:10:01,910
Come on, guys!

6790
04:10:02,050 --> 04:10:02,750
Right here!

6791
04:10:03,590 --> 04:10:04,330
Follow me!

6792
04:10:07,970 --> 04:10:08,730
Follow me!

6793
04:10:09,290 --> 04:10:10,810
Dude, I just realized something.

6794
04:10:11,170 --> 04:10:12,690
Dark magic is shit.

6795
04:10:12,870 --> 04:10:14,650
This whole time, we've been smearing shit on ourselves.

6796
04:10:14,650 --> 04:10:15,030
Oh, yeah.

6797
04:10:15,110 --> 04:10:15,490
Sad.

6798
04:10:15,670 --> 04:10:16,610
Now you know.

6799
04:10:17,010 --> 04:10:17,450
I just tried not to think about it.

6800
04:10:17,510 --> 04:10:18,570
Because I was so gross.

6801
04:10:19,150 --> 04:10:20,630
Now this rush is going back to skew.

6802
04:10:21,010 --> 04:10:21,510
Sad.

6803
04:10:22,030 --> 04:10:23,510
Now you realize...

6804
04:10:23,510 --> 04:10:24,090
Guys!

6805
04:10:24,910 --> 04:10:26,230
It's Mr. Hanky!

6806
04:10:26,310 --> 04:10:26,850
Oh, my God.

6807
04:10:26,850 --> 04:10:27,730
What else would it be?

6808
04:10:28,030 --> 04:10:29,830
It's literally Mr. Hanky!

6809
04:10:31,910 --> 04:10:32,690
Oh, God.

6810
04:10:33,030 --> 04:10:33,950
Oh, God.

6811
04:10:34,030 --> 04:10:34,310
Okay.

6812
04:10:35,330 --> 04:10:37,450
I nearly realized that this is a team game.

6813
04:10:40,590 --> 04:10:41,570
Let me go.

6814
04:10:41,750 --> 04:10:42,770
Let me go.

6815
04:10:43,190 --> 04:10:43,710
Oh!

6816
04:10:45,470 --> 04:10:45,990
Okay.

6817
04:10:46,130 --> 04:10:46,830
Drone time.

6818
04:10:47,370 --> 04:10:47,890
Drone.

6819
04:10:48,230 --> 04:10:48,750
Drone.

6820
04:10:49,250 --> 04:10:49,770
Drone.

6821
04:10:50,170 --> 04:10:50,690
Drone.

6822
04:10:51,230 --> 04:10:51,750
Drone.

6823
04:10:52,290 --> 04:10:52,810
Drone.

6824
04:10:52,850 --> 04:10:53,290
Drone.

6825
04:10:53,290 --> 04:10:53,530
Drone.

6826
04:10:53,530 --> 04:10:53,730
Drone.

6827
04:10:54,290 --> 04:10:54,790
Drone.

6828
04:10:54,790 --> 04:10:55,030
Drone.

6829
04:10:55,790 --> 04:10:56,310
Drone.

6830
04:10:56,310 --> 04:10:56,830
Drone.

6831
04:10:57,830 --> 04:10:58,790
Drone to win!

6832
04:10:59,110 --> 04:11:00,030
Drone to win!

6833
04:11:00,530 --> 04:11:01,330
There we go.

6834
04:11:02,930 --> 04:11:05,150
I hope my drone is doing something.

6835
04:11:05,250 --> 04:11:06,050
I have no idea.

6836
04:11:06,250 --> 04:11:08,890
I really hope my drone is actually working.

6837
04:11:11,190 --> 04:11:13,450
I almost, like, blamed somebody else.

6838
04:11:13,970 --> 04:11:14,610
Okay.

6839
04:11:15,110 --> 04:11:16,010
Bubble time.

6840
04:11:16,930 --> 04:11:17,570
Okay.

6841
04:11:17,610 --> 04:11:18,370
We gotta go.

6842
04:11:19,130 --> 04:11:19,770
Drone!

6843
04:11:20,090 --> 04:11:20,730
Drone!

6844
04:11:21,190 --> 04:11:21,910
All right.

6845
04:11:23,710 --> 04:11:24,350
Nice.

6846
04:11:25,830 --> 04:11:26,830
Got some...

6847
04:11:26,850 --> 04:11:27,090
Got some more.

6848
04:11:27,950 --> 04:11:29,290
We gotta kill this guy.

6849
04:11:29,810 --> 04:11:30,310
Boop!

6850
04:11:31,730 --> 04:11:32,610
Get over here.

6851
04:11:32,770 --> 04:11:33,910
Get over here, sniper!

6852
04:11:35,370 --> 04:11:36,770
We're almost to the top!

6853
04:11:39,430 --> 04:11:40,670
One more sixth graders!

6854
04:11:42,510 --> 04:11:44,570
We just gotta kill the last sixth...

6855
04:11:44,570 --> 04:11:45,130
I got you!

6856
04:11:45,430 --> 04:11:46,510
I got the sniper!

6857
04:11:47,990 --> 04:11:49,130
Get over here, sniper.

6858
04:11:49,750 --> 04:11:50,730
Oh, my God.

6859
04:11:50,830 --> 04:11:52,930
I was so fucking spoiled by the legendary.

6860
04:11:54,430 --> 04:11:54,930
Nice.

6861
04:11:56,150 --> 04:11:56,830
I was so fucking spoiled by the legendary.

6862
04:11:56,850 --> 04:11:58,590
I was really spoiled by the legendary spin.

6863
04:11:59,630 --> 04:12:01,390
Please, please, please.

6864
04:12:02,170 --> 04:12:05,950
Why is it every time I join somebody else's session...

6865
04:12:05,950 --> 04:12:07,730
Everyone in South Park will do whatever they tell them.

6866
04:12:07,790 --> 04:12:10,270
Just for a hint of my sweet Christmas magic.

6867
04:12:11,250 --> 04:12:11,710
Jimmy!

6868
04:12:11,950 --> 04:12:13,490
Now, this is what I call a climax.

6869
04:12:14,030 --> 04:12:15,230
Ready for your last upgrade?

6870
04:12:15,750 --> 04:12:16,810
Oh, my God.

6871
04:12:17,350 --> 04:12:18,010
Oh, my God.

6872
04:12:18,050 --> 04:12:18,630
The last upgrade.

6873
04:12:19,550 --> 04:12:20,310
Oh, my God.

6874
04:12:21,770 --> 04:12:22,750
I'm so ready.

6875
04:12:24,090 --> 04:12:25,230
I'm so ready.

6876
04:12:25,270 --> 04:12:26,090
The last upgrade.

6877
04:12:26,090 --> 04:12:27,070
Please.

6878
04:12:27,510 --> 04:12:28,230
All right.

6879
04:12:28,350 --> 04:12:31,210
Your health total is said about 10% less stamina.

6880
04:12:31,610 --> 04:12:32,170
Okay.

6881
04:12:32,310 --> 04:12:34,230
We need more bubbles.

6882
04:12:34,970 --> 04:12:35,530
That's pretty good.

6883
04:12:35,530 --> 04:12:36,110
The last one.

6884
04:12:36,370 --> 04:12:37,310
Try not to die.

6885
04:12:37,410 --> 04:12:37,990
That would be embarrassing.

6886
04:12:39,510 --> 04:12:41,650
Guys, we're gonna make it.

6887
04:12:41,690 --> 04:12:42,710
Crazy weather we had.

6888
04:12:42,750 --> 04:12:43,810
We fucking survived.

6889
04:12:46,810 --> 04:12:48,230
The last one.

6890
04:12:49,470 --> 04:12:51,110
We're gonna make it.

6891
04:12:53,290 --> 04:12:54,330
Oh, my God.

6892
04:12:54,350 --> 04:12:55,090
The last upgrade.

6893
04:12:55,510 --> 04:12:56,070
Oh, my God.

6894
04:12:56,630 --> 04:12:58,090
We're gonna make it, everybody.

6895
04:12:58,950 --> 04:13:00,770
We're so close to the finish line.

6896
04:13:01,130 --> 04:13:01,570
Drone.

6897
04:13:01,910 --> 04:13:02,350
Drone.

6898
04:13:02,770 --> 04:13:03,210
Drone.

6899
04:13:03,650 --> 04:13:04,090
Drone.

6900
04:13:04,550 --> 04:13:04,990
Drone.

6901
04:13:05,310 --> 04:13:05,750
Drone.

6902
04:13:06,410 --> 04:13:07,290
Please explode.

6903
04:13:09,570 --> 04:13:10,390
Okay, guys.

6904
04:13:10,410 --> 04:13:12,950
I think I have a feeling that the drone is not that strong.

6905
04:13:13,490 --> 04:13:18,990
I realized that possibly the drone was not as strong as I thought it was.

6906
04:13:21,450 --> 04:13:23,630
It's making me a little sad that I got the drone.

6907
04:13:27,270 --> 04:13:28,890
The drone is a little weak.

6908
04:13:30,770 --> 04:13:31,290
Yeah.

6909
04:13:31,570 --> 04:13:33,650
The drone kind of sucks, guys.

6910
04:13:34,670 --> 04:13:37,190
Why did nobody stop me from getting a drone?

6911
04:13:37,510 --> 04:13:38,810
Oh, my God.

6912
04:13:39,810 --> 04:13:40,970
What the fuck?

6913
04:13:42,850 --> 04:13:44,070
Why did nobody...

6914
04:13:44,070 --> 04:13:46,110
That's all the damage it does?

6915
04:13:48,670 --> 04:13:51,570
That's actually all the damage it does on the drone.

6916
04:13:51,910 --> 04:13:53,610
That's why the one I chose to put the drone on was the one that was the strongest.

6917
04:13:53,630 --> 04:13:53,650
I thought you had more damage.

6918
04:13:53,650 --> 04:13:53,670
If it was the drone, I would've put the drone on.

6919
04:13:53,670 --> 04:13:55,290
I wish my dark matter inside of was you.

6920
04:13:55,550 --> 04:13:56,190
All right.

6921
04:13:56,470 --> 04:13:57,190
Let's go.

6922
04:13:59,470 --> 04:14:00,210
Let's go.

6923
04:14:00,290 --> 04:14:01,090
We're almost there.

6924
04:14:02,690 --> 04:14:05,070
Team, we're almost at the finish line.

6925
04:14:05,370 --> 04:14:08,230
We can't get a refund, because we've committed...

6926
04:14:09,530 --> 04:14:11,830
We're committed to seeing the end.

6927
04:14:12,950 --> 04:14:14,530
Team, this is it.

6928
04:14:15,190 --> 04:14:16,930
The end is so near.

6929
04:14:17,750 --> 04:14:20,870
We've invested four hours of the rest of our lives.

6930
04:14:22,070 --> 04:14:23,610
Please, where the fuck is the drone?

6931
04:14:23,630 --> 04:14:23,930
Where is the other guy?

6932
04:14:24,270 --> 04:14:25,410
Where is he?

6933
04:14:25,510 --> 04:14:26,330
Did he fall down?

6934
04:14:47,610 --> 04:14:49,790
Wait, that's pretty smart Cartman.

6935
04:14:53,930 --> 04:14:54,770
Wait, no.

6936
04:14:54,830 --> 04:14:56,050
What are you spitting facts?

6937
04:14:57,250 --> 04:15:00,050
I already put so much dark matter inside me.

6938
04:15:01,170 --> 04:15:02,130
Who's gonna do that?

6939
04:15:03,250 --> 04:15:03,810
Guys,

6940
04:15:07,070 --> 04:15:08,750
he absorbed four dark matters.

6941
04:15:23,630 --> 04:15:24,550
You guys should have listened to me.

6942
04:15:24,650 --> 04:15:24,910
What?

6943
04:15:25,150 --> 04:15:26,250
You know it's time for all of you to stop.

6944
04:15:26,250 --> 04:15:27,690
I wasn't the one that fucked you guys.

6945
04:15:27,810 --> 04:15:29,210
It was the other new kids.

6946
04:15:29,930 --> 04:15:31,210
I wasn't that strong.

6947
04:15:34,090 --> 04:15:35,290
Use your bullshit.

6948
04:15:37,790 --> 04:15:38,830
Can't believe it.

6949
04:15:38,830 --> 04:15:40,090
Cartman was finally right.

6950
04:15:40,330 --> 04:15:42,090
He's right one of ten times.

6951
04:15:42,250 --> 04:15:43,690
This is how we leave their offerings for the Great One.

6952
04:15:43,970 --> 04:15:45,790
Dark Christmas is upon us.

6953
04:15:46,070 --> 04:15:49,030
And he has taken his final form.

6954
04:15:49,310 --> 04:15:51,050
The fuck are you talking about final form?

6955
04:15:51,090 --> 04:15:52,170
Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about?

6956
04:15:52,550 --> 04:15:53,890
Shiza Halu.

6957
04:15:54,310 --> 04:15:54,750
What?

6958
04:15:55,510 --> 04:15:56,730
What the fuck is that?

6959
04:15:57,310 --> 04:16:02,230
Oh, is that the final form that I spoiled myself with because I was trying to like cheese this?

6960
04:16:04,790 --> 04:16:06,270
Oh, there it is.

6961
04:16:06,530 --> 04:16:06,710
Oh.

6962
04:16:08,790 --> 04:16:09,230
Oh.

6963
04:16:11,670 --> 04:16:14,230
The part where they're like in the cutscene.

6964
04:16:14,310 --> 04:16:16,230
You can't fucking watch it with them.

6965
04:16:16,270 --> 04:16:17,350
There's only one way to deal with a bunch of shit.

6966
04:16:17,850 --> 04:16:18,450
Toilet paper.

6967
04:16:18,690 --> 04:16:19,510
Yeah, toilet paper.

6968
04:16:19,730 --> 04:16:20,550
There's a ton of it here.

6969
04:16:20,750 --> 04:16:21,190
Great.

6970
04:16:21,310 --> 04:16:22,530
We can use those cannons to shoot.

6971
04:16:22,530 --> 04:16:23,730
Come on, let's go.

6972
04:16:27,360 --> 04:16:28,420
Yankee's true form.

6973
04:16:29,120 --> 04:16:29,740
It's okay.

6974
04:16:31,460 --> 04:16:32,940
We have to use the toilet paper?

6975
04:16:33,420 --> 04:16:35,180
Oh my god, they're babies.

6976
04:16:36,200 --> 04:16:37,140
Oh shit.

6977
04:16:39,880 --> 04:16:41,600
The cannons won't fire without TP.

6978
04:16:41,800 --> 04:16:43,100
Find a pack and bring it there.

6979
04:16:43,180 --> 04:16:43,760
I'm trying.

6980
04:16:45,540 --> 04:16:46,920
Oh, where the fuck?

6981
04:16:48,000 --> 04:16:49,120
I got him.

6982
04:16:49,180 --> 04:16:49,580
I got him.

6983
04:16:50,040 --> 04:16:51,180
Oh, there's too many.

6984
04:16:51,780 --> 04:16:52,820
I got it.

6985
04:16:53,800 --> 04:16:54,440
All right.

6986
04:16:55,460 --> 04:16:55,900
Okay.

6987
04:16:56,780 --> 04:16:59,200
I'm gonna submit an army.

6988
04:16:59,800 --> 04:17:00,680
That's lasers.

6989
04:17:01,400 --> 04:17:02,640
That wasn't an army.

6990
04:17:02,740 --> 04:17:03,240
That was lasers.

6991
04:17:03,460 --> 04:17:04,200
Okay, I'm helping.

6992
04:17:04,700 --> 04:17:05,660
Guys, drone.

6993
04:17:06,080 --> 04:17:09,620
All right, I'm gonna grab you guys the toilet paper.

6994
04:17:09,780 --> 04:17:10,900
You guys do all the other work.

6995
04:17:12,340 --> 04:17:12,880
Don't worry.

6996
04:17:13,680 --> 04:17:15,640
I'll help you guys get the toilet paper.

6997
04:17:17,740 --> 04:17:18,600
Oh, please.

6998
04:17:18,760 --> 04:17:19,580
I'm like bait.

6999
04:17:19,820 --> 04:17:20,640
I'm the bait.

7000
04:17:23,560 --> 04:17:24,200
Don't worry.

7001
04:17:24,300 --> 04:17:24,880
I'm the bait.

7002
04:17:25,520 --> 04:17:26,380
There you go.

7003
04:17:26,400 --> 04:17:26,920
Grab it.

7004
04:17:27,120 --> 04:17:28,200
Oh, god.

7005
04:17:30,420 --> 04:17:31,980
Guys, I think I need heals.

7006
04:17:33,340 --> 04:17:33,820
Guys.

7007
04:17:34,280 --> 04:17:35,980
I think I need heals, guys.

7008
04:17:36,260 --> 04:17:37,840
I might have messed up.

7009
04:17:38,340 --> 04:17:41,220
I might have messed up and thought I did not need heals.

7010
04:17:44,160 --> 04:17:45,100
Oh, fuck.

7011
04:17:45,160 --> 04:17:45,460
Okay.

7012
04:17:46,760 --> 04:17:47,720
Oh, no.

7013
04:17:48,220 --> 04:17:49,480
I need red soon.

7014
04:17:52,420 --> 04:17:53,720
Guys, I'm not okay.

7015
04:17:54,360 --> 04:17:55,920
I'm not okay.

7016
04:17:56,340 --> 04:17:56,980
I'm not okay.

7017
04:17:56,980 --> 04:17:58,160
Oh, thank god.

7018
04:17:58,600 --> 04:17:59,120
Okay.

7019
04:17:59,700 --> 04:18:01,260
I believe in you guys.

7020
04:18:01,400 --> 04:18:03,180
I'm gonna stay here next to the heals.

7021
04:18:03,620 --> 04:18:05,680
Oh, no.

7022
04:18:06,280 --> 04:18:07,140
Oh, no.

7023
04:18:07,200 --> 04:18:08,520
He's gonna fucking hidey-ho me.

7024
04:18:09,200 --> 04:18:09,720
Okay.

7025
04:18:11,420 --> 04:18:12,400
Get over here.

7026
04:18:13,240 --> 04:18:14,340
Get over here.

7027
04:18:17,180 --> 04:18:17,960
I got him.

7028
04:18:18,060 --> 04:18:18,260
I got him.

7029
04:18:20,640 --> 04:18:20,860
Toilet paper.

7030
04:18:21,200 --> 04:18:23,120
I can jump with the toilet paper, too.

7031
04:18:23,880 --> 04:18:24,660
Oh, shit.

7032
04:18:24,780 --> 04:18:24,980
Okay.

7033
04:18:25,060 --> 04:18:25,580
Here I go.

7034
04:18:27,260 --> 04:18:30,120
I'm gonna be helpful for once in my life.

7035
04:18:30,580 --> 04:18:31,980
I'm not gonna leech off.

7036
04:18:32,140 --> 04:18:33,140
I'm gonna be helpful.

7037
04:18:34,280 --> 04:18:35,100
Here I go.

7038
04:18:37,500 --> 04:18:37,940
Alright.

7039
04:18:41,220 --> 04:18:41,920
We did it.

7040
04:18:42,380 --> 04:18:43,600
Someone help the wizard.

7041
04:18:43,700 --> 04:18:44,380
The red wizard.

7042
04:18:46,400 --> 04:18:47,440
Someone help him.

7043
04:18:48,460 --> 04:18:49,260
Oh, no.

7044
04:18:49,360 --> 04:18:50,060
Oh, no.

7045
04:18:50,120 --> 04:18:50,700
I got the barrier.

7046
04:18:52,540 --> 04:18:53,700
He has the toilet paper.

7047
04:18:54,360 --> 04:18:54,880
Don't worry.

7048
04:18:55,500 --> 04:18:56,380
I'm gonna get the grab.

7049
04:18:56,520 --> 04:18:56,920
Oh!

7050
04:18:58,800 --> 04:18:59,600
Hey, guys.

7051
04:19:00,760 --> 04:19:02,500
I'm also very important.

7052
04:19:03,600 --> 04:19:04,400
Hey, everybody.

7053
04:19:07,920 --> 04:19:08,640
Hey, guys.

7054
04:19:09,480 --> 04:19:09,880
Psych.

7055
04:19:13,300 --> 04:19:14,100
Here we go.

7056
04:19:14,860 --> 04:19:15,260
Nice.

7057
04:19:16,020 --> 04:19:16,500
No!

7058
04:19:16,520 --> 04:19:18,140
Are you fucking kidding me?

7059
04:19:18,240 --> 04:19:18,760
Oh, there he is.

7060
04:19:18,860 --> 04:19:19,160
No.

7061
04:19:19,280 --> 04:19:19,700
Okay.

7062
04:19:19,760 --> 04:19:20,260
We gotta wait.

7063
04:19:20,560 --> 04:19:22,600
Where is he?

7064
04:19:23,180 --> 04:19:23,800
Oh, no.

7065
04:19:23,860 --> 04:19:24,560
He's gonna be...

7066
04:19:24,560 --> 04:19:25,300
Where is he?

7067
04:19:26,120 --> 04:19:26,820
Come on.

7068
04:19:26,940 --> 04:19:27,960
I'm holding it.

7069
04:19:29,140 --> 04:19:29,620
No!

7070
04:19:29,960 --> 04:19:31,440
He hasn't hurt me.

7071
04:19:32,760 --> 04:19:34,040
He has to show up here.

7072
04:19:35,500 --> 04:19:36,080
It's alright.

7073
04:19:36,640 --> 04:19:38,600
No, it's not okay.

7074
04:19:40,660 --> 04:19:42,560
No, it's not okay.

7075
04:19:42,560 --> 04:19:43,760
They damaged it.

7076
04:19:45,260 --> 04:19:46,480
He's literally holding it in.

7077
04:19:49,160 --> 04:19:49,720
Dodge.

7078
04:19:50,760 --> 04:19:51,320
Dodge.

7079
04:19:51,820 --> 04:19:53,500
Oh, she got the toilet paper.

7080
04:19:54,120 --> 04:19:54,680
Alright.

7081
04:19:56,620 --> 04:19:58,120
Where's the other toilet paper?

7082
04:19:58,960 --> 04:20:00,000
Where is it?

7083
04:20:00,420 --> 04:20:03,200
Why is there a toilet paper up there?

7084
04:20:03,620 --> 04:20:03,740
Why is there a toilet paper up there?

7085
04:20:03,940 --> 04:20:06,140
Who's gonna be able to grab it?

7086
04:20:06,540 --> 04:20:06,620
Who's gonna be able to grab it?

7087
04:20:09,220 --> 04:20:10,720
What is he looking at?

7088
04:20:11,480 --> 04:20:12,460
What is this?

7089
04:20:12,460 --> 04:20:15,580
Oh, I got slow-motor some shit.

7090
04:20:15,860 --> 04:20:16,580
Oh, god.

7091
04:20:17,120 --> 04:20:17,600
Please.

7092
04:20:18,580 --> 04:20:19,060
Grab.

7093
04:20:19,060 --> 04:20:20,360
Take me to the other.

7094
04:20:20,400 --> 04:20:20,660
Please.

7095
04:20:20,760 --> 04:20:22,440
I just wanna touch this toilet paper.

7096
04:20:22,880 --> 04:20:23,360
Yes!

7097
04:20:23,360 --> 04:20:23,660
No!

7098
04:20:26,840 --> 04:20:28,100
Guys, please.

7099
04:20:28,240 --> 04:20:28,920
I'm not...

7100
04:20:28,920 --> 04:20:30,740
I'm not a detriment to this team.

7101
04:20:31,100 --> 04:20:32,960
I just need you all to know that.

7102
04:20:33,920 --> 04:20:35,360
I just need you all to know.

7103
04:20:36,260 --> 04:20:38,200
That I am trying my best right now.

7104
04:20:38,520 --> 04:20:41,360
I am trying my best here.

7105
04:20:41,740 --> 04:20:42,440
I'm not even trying.

7106
04:20:42,460 --> 04:20:43,680
I'm not trying to be a bad person.

7107
04:20:43,760 --> 04:20:44,440
Oh, no.

7108
04:20:44,980 --> 04:20:47,480
My team is so smart.

7109
04:20:48,220 --> 04:20:49,140
I'm like the distraction.

7110
04:20:49,380 --> 04:20:49,800
I'm bait.

7111
04:20:50,560 --> 04:20:51,680
I'm just...

7112
04:20:51,680 --> 04:20:53,940
What the fuck happened to me?

7113
04:20:54,420 --> 04:20:55,840
What the fuck?

7114
04:20:56,260 --> 04:20:59,400
I got gang-banged by a bunch of poop.

7115
04:20:59,640 --> 04:21:00,840
Like, what the fuck?

7116
04:21:01,880 --> 04:21:02,780
Hey, guys.

7117
04:21:03,280 --> 04:21:04,760
An important member here.

7118
04:21:05,040 --> 04:21:05,660
Number two.

7119
04:21:07,500 --> 04:21:08,280
It's okay.

7120
04:21:08,780 --> 04:21:11,260
I'm just bait.

7121
04:21:12,460 --> 04:21:13,160
I'm just bait.

7122
04:21:14,680 --> 04:21:15,720
Here we go.

7123
04:21:16,000 --> 04:21:16,800
We're fine.

7124
04:21:17,160 --> 04:21:18,400
We did it!

7125
04:21:19,100 --> 04:21:20,340
Oh my god!

7126
04:21:22,980 --> 04:21:24,260
I existed.

7127
04:21:27,140 --> 04:21:27,860
I...

7128
04:21:28,200 --> 04:21:29,320
Guys, we did it.

7129
04:21:29,340 --> 04:21:31,640
Oh my god.

7130
04:21:32,120 --> 04:21:33,040
What a team.

7131
04:21:33,640 --> 04:21:36,180
What a fucking team.

7132
04:21:37,980 --> 04:21:38,700
Oh.

7133
04:21:39,440 --> 04:21:41,480
What a team, chat.

7134
04:21:42,460 --> 04:21:44,220
What a beautiful team.

7135
04:21:45,420 --> 04:21:47,040
You picked up a bunch of dirt matter.

7136
04:21:47,160 --> 04:21:47,780
How's that, lady?

7137
04:21:50,860 --> 04:21:52,320
They're so good.

7138
04:21:52,840 --> 04:21:54,980
We're all so good, chat.

7139
04:21:55,280 --> 04:21:56,500
We're all...

7140
04:21:57,540 --> 04:21:58,740
We did it.

7141
04:22:02,240 --> 04:22:04,340
They wouldn't have made it there without me.

7142
04:22:08,580 --> 04:22:10,180
The storm has lifted.

7143
04:22:10,280 --> 04:22:11,640
The snow is melting.

7144
04:22:11,860 --> 04:22:14,480
And toilet paper is once again just for the best.

7145
04:22:14,480 --> 04:22:15,180
We're wiping your butt.

7146
04:22:15,500 --> 04:22:17,740
Things are going back to normal in South Park.

7147
04:22:17,920 --> 04:22:19,340
And we're all gonna be alright.

7148
04:22:19,800 --> 04:22:22,900
All of us except for the thousands who tragically lost their lives.

7149
04:22:22,900 --> 04:22:23,240
That's alright.

7150
04:22:23,680 --> 04:22:24,420
Back to you, Tom.

7151
04:22:25,620 --> 04:22:29,100
I've just been told that Tom has also tragically lost his life.

7152
04:22:29,300 --> 04:22:30,400
No, not Tom!

7153
04:22:31,200 --> 04:22:32,140
Back to you, Kelly.

7154
04:22:32,340 --> 04:22:33,300
Who's gonna report the news?

7155
04:22:39,220 --> 04:22:41,500
What about me?

7156
04:22:41,500 --> 04:22:43,120
We all have to go.

7157
04:22:44,160 --> 04:22:47,240
You know, not that long ago I prayed to God.

7158
04:22:47,840 --> 04:22:50,420
And all I asked was to not get totally fucked.

7159
04:22:51,840 --> 04:22:53,520
School isn't that bad, dude.

7160
04:22:54,080 --> 04:22:55,220
No, no, it's okay.

7161
04:22:55,620 --> 04:22:57,000
I'm pretty used to getting fucked now.

7162
04:22:57,280 --> 04:23:00,140
It's just sort of par for the course when you have faith in a higher power.

7163
04:23:03,920 --> 04:23:05,100
Who the fuck is that?

7164
04:23:06,140 --> 04:23:07,400
That can't be Hanky.

7165
04:23:07,560 --> 04:23:08,500
We killed him.

7166
04:23:08,860 --> 04:23:09,260
Jesus!

7167
04:23:11,600 --> 04:23:12,540
Oh my God!

7168
04:23:13,840 --> 04:23:17,840
My children, I am very disappointed in all of you.

7169
04:23:17,900 --> 04:23:18,060
What?

7170
04:23:19,560 --> 04:23:20,740
All of us?

7171
04:23:21,260 --> 04:23:21,800
Yeah, what did we do?

7172
04:23:22,080 --> 04:23:25,660
Every Christmas, Mr. Hanky brought you happiness and joy.

7173
04:23:26,080 --> 04:23:30,800
And yet, when he got canceled for his Twitter posts, you would not forgive him.

7174
04:23:31,460 --> 04:23:32,100
You would not forgive him.

7175
04:23:32,100 --> 04:23:33,640
No, that was everyone else in town.

7176
04:23:33,720 --> 04:23:34,180
We didn't care.

7177
04:23:34,740 --> 04:23:38,960
And yet, did you stand by Mr. Hanky's side when everyone turned on him?

7178
04:23:40,820 --> 04:23:41,480
Everyone turned on him.

7179
04:23:41,500 --> 04:23:42,940
Who the fuck requested the skip?

7180
04:23:43,500 --> 04:23:46,900
But the only mistake that is true is not to forgive.

7181
04:23:47,940 --> 04:23:51,460
It is up to you to make more mistakes.

7182
04:23:56,400 --> 04:23:57,620
Oh, come on.

7183
04:24:05,750 --> 04:24:06,850
Mr. Hanky?

7184
04:24:08,150 --> 04:24:09,170
Mr. Hanky?

7185
04:24:09,170 --> 04:24:09,330
Mr. Hanky?

7186
04:24:09,330 --> 04:24:10,730
Whose toilet does he live in?

7187
04:24:14,210 --> 04:24:15,850
We should have had your back.

7188
04:24:16,350 --> 04:24:18,810
Yeah, we should have had each other's backs.

7189
04:24:18,990 --> 04:24:21,590
All this talking, all this talking about the rules, what's wrong and right.

7190
04:24:22,570 --> 04:24:26,030
Yeah, if anyone's been a piece of shit, it's been us.

7191
04:24:30,140 --> 04:24:31,960
You guys don't mean it.

7192
04:24:33,520 --> 04:24:35,320
Yeah, yeah, we mean it.

7193
04:24:35,360 --> 04:24:35,520
Really.

7194
04:24:35,740 --> 04:24:38,060
We messed up too, Mr. Hanky.

7195
04:24:38,120 --> 04:24:38,840
Everybody does.

7196
04:24:39,280 --> 04:24:42,140
This like feels good orchestra music.

7197
04:24:44,360 --> 04:24:44,840
We're sure, Mr. Hanky.

7198
04:24:44,920 --> 04:24:45,880
We love you.

7199
04:24:46,000 --> 04:24:46,960
Oh my god.

7200
04:24:48,140 --> 04:24:49,480
Well, howdy-how!

7201
04:24:50,220 --> 04:24:51,340
Thank you, boys!

7202
04:24:52,140 --> 04:24:53,680
This is the best day of my life!

7203
04:24:54,140 --> 04:24:56,880
Now we just gotta figure out how to get the rest of the town to forgive you.

7204
04:24:57,080 --> 04:24:59,420
I don't care what the town thinks of me.

7205
04:24:59,620 --> 04:25:01,640
So long as I have you kids.

7206
04:25:02,300 --> 04:25:02,960
Oh, great!

7207
04:25:03,100 --> 04:25:04,200
Now we can all be friends again.

7208
04:25:05,000 --> 04:25:09,020
And maybe sometimes, just sometimes, you can make a blizzard again.

7209
04:25:09,200 --> 04:25:10,640
So we can have another snow day.

7210
04:25:12,240 --> 04:25:13,920
Maybe like right now?

7211
04:25:14,320 --> 04:25:15,240
Could you, Mr. Hanky?

7212
04:25:15,520 --> 04:25:17,420
Could we just have like one more snow day?

7213
04:25:17,500 --> 04:25:20,840
One more snow day so we can have more Dungeons & Dragons!

7214
04:25:21,720 --> 04:25:22,120
And it's snowing again!

7215
04:25:23,560 --> 04:25:24,200
Yay!

7216
04:25:24,720 --> 04:25:27,500
Time to kill another thousand people!

7217
04:25:28,800 --> 04:25:29,440
Yay!

7218
04:25:30,600 --> 04:25:30,920
Yay!

7219
04:25:31,600 --> 04:25:31,660
Yay!

7220
04:25:32,200 --> 04:25:32,840
Yay!

7221
04:25:33,780 --> 04:25:34,020
Yay!

7222
04:25:37,240 --> 04:25:38,840
One more time!

7223
04:25:39,140 --> 04:25:40,460
One more time!

7224
04:25:41,240 --> 04:25:43,380
Ooh, you're loaded with dark matter!

7225
04:25:43,660 --> 04:25:44,760
We did it!

7226
04:25:45,500 --> 04:25:48,260
I was gonna ask, is there an after credits scene?

7227
04:25:48,480 --> 04:25:52,800
But I don't think there's enough people to know if there's an after credits scene.

7228
04:25:58,240 --> 04:25:59,480
I can't tell.

7229
04:26:00,020 --> 04:26:03,860
I don't think there's enough people to fucking figure this out.

7230
04:26:04,100 --> 04:26:06,780
I don't think there's enough people to fucking figure this out.

7231
04:26:06,780 --> 04:26:07,940
What about the new kid?

7232
04:26:08,300 --> 04:26:10,300
Did we just forgot about the new kid?

7233
04:26:10,920 --> 04:26:12,460
Lobster, thank you for the super chat.

7234
04:26:12,560 --> 04:26:13,320
Thank you, thank you.

7235
04:26:16,020 --> 04:26:17,260
Oh my god.

7236
04:26:17,600 --> 04:26:19,080
What a fucking journey.

7237
04:26:19,640 --> 04:26:20,260
Alright, let's go.

7238
04:26:20,880 --> 04:26:21,360
Okay.

7239
04:26:22,160 --> 04:26:27,660
I love Trey Parker and Matt Stone and like, I love like the stuff they do.

7240
04:26:27,880 --> 04:26:40,780
I even went to the Book of Mormon musical with the original cast and got like, I bought like VIP seats like not VIP, sorry, like some of the best seats for Book of Mormon because it was like one of the musicals I've always wanted to watch.

7241
04:26:41,160 --> 04:26:57,800
And I was like in New York at the time for like a conference like an academic conference so I was lucky enough to see the Book of Mormon with with the original cast you know, before they all went become stars in their own right.

7242
04:26:58,000 --> 04:27:02,020
And like, I love the Book of Mormon and I love like all the stuff they do.

7243
04:27:02,260 --> 04:27:08,880
I love like when they were the guy, one of them, when they did the voice acting for one of the Despicable Me movies that was pretty fucking funny.

7244
04:27:09,200 --> 04:27:11,440
But like, holy fuck.

7245
04:27:12,220 --> 04:27:13,180
This game.

7246
04:27:14,760 --> 04:27:19,820
This game was a fucking chore to play.

7247
04:27:26,000 --> 04:27:27,280
This game.

7248
04:27:29,620 --> 04:27:35,260
I took a risk and a gamble to play this game on launch.

7249
04:27:36,180 --> 04:27:47,980
Because I was like okay, I had a feeling it won't be like the perfect game because it's like this weird this is a new area they're gonna play they're gonna, like there's a new area they're gonna play.

7250
04:27:48,000 --> 04:27:48,580
And I wanted to explore.

7251
04:27:48,900 --> 04:27:50,640
But oh my god.

7252
04:27:51,840 --> 04:27:53,640
Oh my fucking god.

7253
04:27:54,160 --> 04:27:57,240
Oh my fucking god.

7254
04:27:58,720 --> 04:28:00,060
This game.

7255
04:28:00,620 --> 04:28:04,580
I think it just needed something.

7256
04:28:04,780 --> 04:28:06,260
It felt really repetitive.

7257
04:28:06,620 --> 04:28:13,840
The longer the longer you play it the, it got like more and more repetitive.

7258
04:28:14,280 --> 04:28:16,580
So like, it just needed something more.

7259
04:28:18,000 --> 04:28:21,400
It just, it really needed something more.

7260
04:28:22,880 --> 04:28:25,760
It felt like really fucking repetitive.

7261
04:28:26,800 --> 04:28:28,520
Oh my god.

7262
04:28:28,760 --> 04:28:30,380
But we did it.

7263
04:28:30,480 --> 04:28:30,980
Guys.

7264
04:28:31,120 --> 04:28:33,100
We fucking did it.

7265
04:28:34,320 --> 04:28:42,820
I can't believe zero, when I tried to queue up for easy, zero game, zero players were playing.

7266
04:28:43,020 --> 04:28:45,340
That's that was actually crazy.

7267
04:28:46,620 --> 04:28:50,060
There was nobody playing a game on easy.

7268
04:28:51,040 --> 04:28:54,260
And one guy on normal.

7269
04:28:55,720 --> 04:28:57,660
Oh, we cleared it.

7270
04:28:57,760 --> 04:28:59,120
We fucking did it.

7271
04:28:59,260 --> 04:29:01,760
I wanted to go all the way to the end.

7272
04:29:03,160 --> 04:29:05,700
I wanted to play all the way to the end.

7273
04:29:05,920 --> 04:29:07,640
But oh my god.

7274
04:29:07,640 --> 04:29:08,220
Oh my god.

7275
04:29:13,620 --> 04:29:16,400
What a journey that was.

7276
04:29:17,140 --> 04:29:20,000
I'm just happy we made it to the end chat.

7277
04:29:20,160 --> 04:29:21,980
I'm so happy we made it.

7278
04:29:25,720 --> 04:29:26,600
GG's everybody.

7279
04:29:28,200 --> 04:29:28,740
GG's.

7280
04:29:28,820 --> 04:29:32,080
I played this game so you guys don't have to.

7281
04:29:32,380 --> 04:29:36,860
I had to I wanted to go all the way to the end so you guys don't have to.

7282
04:29:36,880 --> 04:29:43,460
I know it might not have been like the most engaging stream to watch, but thank you for sticking it through with me.

7283
04:29:43,760 --> 04:29:44,620
Thank you.

7284
04:29:46,780 --> 04:29:49,840
When I got to okay at first I was like okay I'm gonna play two chapters.

7285
04:29:49,940 --> 04:29:54,500
I'm just gonna play two chapters and then I'm gonna call it there and then never touch the game again.

7286
04:29:54,800 --> 04:30:02,480
But then I played two chapters and then the thing is we were past the two hour mark after the two chapters.

7287
04:30:02,700 --> 04:30:06,040
So then I was like alright fuck it.

7288
04:30:06,420 --> 04:30:07,800
There's nothing I can do.

7289
04:30:07,800 --> 04:30:13,040
I might as well play it to the end and get my money's worth cause I pre-ordered the deluxe version.

7290
04:30:13,400 --> 04:30:18,620
I was like I I got through the end I was like oh my god.

7291
04:30:18,820 --> 04:30:20,600
I might as well.

7292
04:30:20,600 --> 04:30:21,900
I pre-ordered it.

7293
04:30:21,980 --> 04:30:23,080
Got the deluxe version.

7294
04:30:23,480 --> 04:30:38,620
You know okay Okay the funniest thing the funniest thing was that I saw that um what was his name?

7295
04:30:38,800 --> 04:30:39,860
I saw was it Nogla?

7296
04:30:40,100 --> 04:30:45,960
Like I saw like uh fuck was it Nogla that had like early access to this game?

7297
04:30:46,220 --> 04:30:49,160
And I was like okay I'm gonna watch this a little bit so I know.

7298
04:30:49,280 --> 04:30:49,780
Not Nogla.

7299
04:30:49,920 --> 04:30:52,040
Uh fuck what's his name?

7300
04:30:52,280 --> 04:30:55,440
Oh yeah no like Nogla and like his friends.

7301
04:30:56,000 --> 04:31:01,900
Um who was the other guy that also got like Vanoss and everybody.

7302
04:31:02,400 --> 04:31:06,960
Uh god what was like I'm trying to remember.

7303
04:31:07,240 --> 04:31:07,500
Oh yeah.

7304
04:31:07,640 --> 04:31:08,340
Delirious yeah.

7305
04:31:08,580 --> 04:31:16,820
Uh Terrorizer Delirious and Nogla they got like sponsored by they got they got sponsored by this game.

7306
04:31:17,540 --> 04:31:33,740
And I was watching it a little bit because I was like oh early access and then I was like okay cause I was like oh hey they're streaming early access like the early release copy of the fucking game.

7307
04:31:34,020 --> 04:31:35,820
And then I was watching it.

7308
04:31:35,880 --> 04:31:44,000
I was I watched five minutes and then they were like this is the best game we ever played.

7309
04:31:45,280 --> 04:31:49,540
they were like they were like oh my god this is so fun.

7310
04:31:49,600 --> 04:31:54,240
I oh my god guys this is so fucking fun this is one of the best multiplayer games I've played.

7311
04:31:54,300 --> 04:31:55,480
I was like bruh.

7312
04:31:57,400 --> 04:32:04,120
They were like they were like oh my god this is so fucking fun guys.

7313
04:32:04,640 --> 04:32:06,760
And I was like Oh my god, isn't it actually that fun?

7314
04:32:11,100 --> 04:32:11,980
No, they were.

7315
04:32:12,140 --> 04:32:13,340
They were sponsored.

7316
04:32:13,780 --> 04:32:14,480
They were sponsored.

7317
04:32:14,860 --> 04:32:16,180
So like it's understandable.

7318
04:32:16,840 --> 04:32:21,920
But like I... bro, I like I was like I believed it a little bit.

7319
04:32:22,080 --> 04:32:25,160
I was like, okay, because I was like, oh man.

7320
04:32:26,000 --> 04:32:26,960
I was hesitant.

7321
04:32:27,160 --> 04:32:32,440
I don't... that was... I watched the early copy and that's why I bought the deluxe version.

7322
04:32:32,440 --> 04:32:37,800
I bought the deluxe... I pre-ordered the deluxe version because I was like, oh my god.

7323
04:32:37,880 --> 04:32:39,920
Maybe it's not that bad because I was worried.

7324
04:32:39,980 --> 04:32:41,140
I was like, oh man, I'm worried.

7325
04:32:41,900 --> 04:32:43,360
I fell for it.

7326
04:32:43,420 --> 04:32:47,220
I actually fell for it because they actually sounded really exciting.

7327
04:32:47,540 --> 04:32:48,060
Excited.

7328
04:32:48,060 --> 04:32:50,840
They actually sounded so excited.

7329
04:32:50,980 --> 04:32:52,300
I fucking fell for it.

7330
04:32:58,120 --> 04:33:01,180
I fucking... I fucking fell for the sponsor.

7331
04:33:01,520 --> 04:33:02,400
I was like...

7332
04:33:02,400 --> 04:33:04,360
Oh my god, they sound like they're actually having so much fun.

7333
04:33:06,440 --> 04:33:13,480
So... so... because that was what pushed me to pre-ordering the deluxe version over like the normal copy.

7334
04:33:13,800 --> 04:33:21,820
Like I was like, do I get the deluxe copy or do I... because I was like, okay, if I get the normal copy, I'll just do like... I'll just like play the first two chapters and then call it because I have feeling.

7335
04:33:22,080 --> 04:33:26,780
I was like, oh, it doesn't really look that fun as fun as like the other games, the older games.

7336
04:33:27,040 --> 04:33:28,720
And then... and then like...

7337
04:33:29,460 --> 04:33:31,260
And then I watched their sponsored stream.

7338
04:33:31,540 --> 04:33:32,380
I watched five...

7339
04:33:32,380 --> 04:33:33,700
Five minutes of their sponsored stream.

7340
04:33:34,000 --> 04:33:36,860
And that was the moment where they were like, oh my god, this game is so fun.

7341
04:33:37,040 --> 04:33:38,660
And then I was like, oh my god, maybe it is so fun.

7342
04:33:38,860 --> 04:33:41,100
So then I was like, alright, I'm going...

7343
04:33:41,540 --> 04:33:41,940
I...

7344
04:33:43,480 --> 04:33:45,440
I'm... I am going to risk it.

7345
04:33:45,540 --> 04:33:46,620
I'm gonna risk it.

7346
04:33:46,740 --> 04:33:47,700
I fell for it.

7347
04:33:47,820 --> 04:33:48,660
I fell for it.

7348
04:33:52,180 --> 04:33:53,760
What you want to believe.

7349
04:33:54,140 --> 04:33:56,760
The thing is, when the creators...

7350
04:33:56,760 --> 04:34:02,360
When the creators actually like take control, like take creative control, they can't...

7351
04:34:02,360 --> 04:34:04,700
They can make really, really, really good things.

7352
04:34:04,900 --> 04:34:05,940
Like... like... like...

7353
04:34:05,940 --> 04:34:17,240
Uh... the creators of South Park, when they have majority of the creative control, they're really good at making really good games or really good shows or really good like musicals and stuff like that.

7354
04:34:17,500 --> 04:34:19,120
But I don't know what happened to this game.

7355
04:34:19,420 --> 04:34:21,660
I don't know what happened to this game.

7356
04:34:21,860 --> 04:34:23,600
Like, they had creative control.

7357
04:34:24,060 --> 04:34:26,000
So like, what the fuck happened?

7358
04:34:26,400 --> 04:34:27,560
Like... what?

7359
04:34:29,040 --> 04:34:29,560
Yeah.

7360
04:34:29,980 --> 04:34:30,880
Yeah, Tray and Matt.

7361
04:34:30,880 --> 04:34:32,700
I was so surprised.

7362
04:34:33,200 --> 04:34:34,920
Because usually they do really well.

7363
04:34:35,220 --> 04:34:36,820
Like the... the...

7364
04:34:37,740 --> 04:34:40,980
The Stick of Truth and like the Fractured But Whole.

7365
04:34:41,340 --> 04:34:42,900
Those are really good...

7366
04:34:42,900 --> 04:34:46,080
I mean, I haven't played Fractured But Whole, but I heard it was a really good game too.

7367
04:34:46,820 --> 04:34:47,380
Uh...

7368
04:34:48,620 --> 04:34:49,780
They were really good.

7369
04:34:50,260 --> 04:34:53,360
And then... like the musical stuff.

7370
04:34:53,600 --> 04:34:54,520
That was really good.

7371
04:34:54,820 --> 04:34:56,220
What the fuck happened here?

7372
04:34:58,440 --> 04:35:00,020
What... what happened?

7373
04:35:00,880 --> 04:35:01,880
I'm so sad!

7374
04:35:05,360 --> 04:35:07,300
It was made by a different studio?

7375
04:35:07,500 --> 04:35:07,860
Maybe.

7376
04:35:08,220 --> 04:35:09,220
I think it's 3D.

7377
04:35:09,360 --> 04:35:09,820
I don't know.

7378
04:35:11,240 --> 04:35:11,760
Yeah.

7379
04:35:12,820 --> 04:35:14,060
Different dev team?

7380
04:35:14,260 --> 04:35:14,680
I guess.

7381
04:35:14,940 --> 04:35:15,180
Yeah.

7382
04:35:17,600 --> 04:35:18,640
Thank you.

7383
04:35:18,660 --> 04:35:19,020
Thank you.

7384
04:35:19,940 --> 04:35:20,460
Yeah.

7385
04:35:20,800 --> 04:35:22,140
But like, I don't know.

7386
04:35:22,180 --> 04:35:24,940
I trusted... I trusted... I trusted the creators.

7387
04:35:25,100 --> 04:35:28,560
Because like usually when they're head of the creative team.

7388
04:35:29,140 --> 04:35:32,020
Um... they work really hard in trying to make a good game.

7389
04:35:32,140 --> 04:35:34,240
So I was... I was just surprised that...

7390
04:35:35,240 --> 04:35:36,320
It was just mid.

7391
04:35:36,520 --> 04:35:37,400
It was so mid.

7392
04:35:38,320 --> 04:35:39,360
It was...

7393
04:35:40,840 --> 04:35:41,680
It was...

7394
04:35:41,680 --> 04:35:43,260
It's not like super shitty.

7395
04:35:43,480 --> 04:35:45,700
It was just really mid.

7396
04:35:46,000 --> 04:35:48,140
It was incredibly mid.

7397
04:35:48,380 --> 04:35:49,340
I'm sorry.

7398
04:35:53,060 --> 04:35:54,220
Oh my god.

7399
04:35:57,080 --> 04:35:57,600
Uh...

7400
04:35:57,600 --> 04:35:57,780
Uh...

7401
04:35:58,560 --> 04:35:59,040
Anyway guys.

7402
04:35:59,420 --> 04:36:00,360
I'm gonna call it here.

7403
04:36:00,580 --> 04:36:01,440
I'm pretty tired.

7404
04:36:01,660 --> 04:36:03,920
That game really took a lot out of me.

7405
04:36:04,220 --> 04:36:07,080
So... but I hope you guys still enjoyed your time with me today.

7406
04:36:07,420 --> 04:36:08,680
As always everybody.

7407
04:36:09,260 --> 04:36:10,060
Stay hydrated.

7408
04:36:10,460 --> 04:36:11,040
Posture check.

7409
04:36:11,160 --> 04:36:13,160
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7410
04:36:13,300 --> 04:36:14,540
And if you stay up for me.

7411
04:36:14,780 --> 04:36:15,580
Head to bed.

7412
04:36:15,760 --> 04:36:17,120
Cause you deserve it.

7413
04:36:17,260 --> 04:36:18,320
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

7414
04:36:18,780 --> 04:36:19,540
Bye guys.

7415
04:36:20,380 --> 04:36:20,780
Bye.
