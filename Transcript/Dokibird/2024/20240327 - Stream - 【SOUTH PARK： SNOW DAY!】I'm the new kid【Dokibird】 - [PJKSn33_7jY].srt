South Park County is being pummeled with snow and more is
expected to come Is it South Park always snowing?

8
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,560
Isn't that the whole thing?

00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,620
Love did you see how hard it's snowing out dad?

10
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,660
Yes, we didn't know it was snowing when was there any other
weather in South Park?

11
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,560
Right yet this storm has gone from bad to worse

12
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:11,800
over and a tanker truck has crashed multiple casualties
multiple casualties yeah i didn't know they will but people

13
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:22,140

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,270
you see

16
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,310
now it's different now instead i think i think i've heard
about this because now that like we're so used to like

17
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,930
online learning from covid even if it's a snow day now
apparently some schools will just transition to like online

18
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:05,590
learning so they'll be like schools canceled that's okay we
have online learning classes for you to go to instead so

19
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,890
this doesn't matter anymore this was something we used

20
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,930
Back in my day, little Timmy, we had school days where we
actually don't have to do school work.

21
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,330
We didn't have good enough technology for online learning
classes.

22
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,380
Remember what they took from you?

23
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,140
City officials were warning that even first responders will
be staying home today.

24
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,980
The roads are completely blocked.

25
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,280
There is no toilet paper anywhere.

26
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,580
What a bad skit.

27
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:58,220
the end of days everyone please take care of yourselves it's
okay those people don't matter they're not main characters

28
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,620

29
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,640

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,230
I'm going outside to play with my friends.

32
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,470
I don't think that's safe, sweetie.

33
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,990
Mom, it's a snow day.

34
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,370
I feel like this is just a react channel now of watching
self-park.

35
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,570
Which I don't mind.

36
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,350
Today we're just gonna be watching self-park episodes on the
Dokeybird channel.

37
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,440
Oh my god.

38
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,200
You're 3D!

39
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,260
Oh my god!

40
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
No school!

41
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,120
Yay!

42
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,380
Come on, buddy!

43
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,400
Let's go, Stan!

44
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,840
Snow Day, everyone!

45
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,980
People are dying in the snow!

46
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,020
New kid, I'm talking to you!

47
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,280
That's me!

48
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,580
New kid!

49
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,640
That's me!

50
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Okay, before like, I accidentally started the game, uh,
before I want to talk about, you know, usually I would have

51
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,940
like, you know, 10 to 15 minutes Zassadon before I actually
start the game.

52
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,840
But then I accidentally started the game.

53
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:56,380
So we had, anyway, as I was saying, the riskiest part about,
the riskiest part about playing a game on launch and then

54
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:04,220
not knowing if a game is good or not, I was worried because,
okay, like, I love Self Park.

55
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,640
I actually really like Self Park.

56
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,100
I've been, like, keeping up to date with all the new Self
Park episodes, and, like, I've watched almost every episodes

57
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,820
of Self Park.

58
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,540
I grew up watching Self Park as well.

59
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,200
I shouldn't have, but because, like, my parents didn't
really know what I was watching when I was, like, home

60
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,660
alone.

61
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,840
So then, like, you know, when my parents used to, like, own
a restaurant, They would leave me at home and then self park

62
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:37,180
will be playing and then I'd be watching it like on TV on
comedy central And I'd be like yay self park and I'd be like

63
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,020
really young.

64
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:49,380
I shouldn't have you watching it Like I absolutely should
not have been watching self park also also I used to have

65
00:08:49,380 --> 00:09:00,920
like this one of my Parents is like ex-friends anymore but
they had kids too so then like the older sister would like

66
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:13,580
take uh tricked my parents into taking me to watch the self
park movie um i was definitely way too young for that uh

67
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:28,060
i had zero understanding of what the fuck i was watching and
then i apparently my parents got When they were, because

68
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:36,260
then the older sister was like, like my parents ex-friends,
like daughter was like, no, it's an animation.

69
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,760
Like, she can watch it.

70
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,260
And then, so then she tricked my parents to like, because
like she wanted to watch it.

71
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:51,840
So then like, by doing so, they're like, oh yeah, I'm going
to let Joki watch it with me so that like she's allowed to

72
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,760
watch this movie.

73
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,440
So then they're like, oh, it's a kid's animated movie?

74
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:08,260
you can totally bring a little dokey over to like watch with
you at the theater so like here's some money here's some

75
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:17,860
money so you can like treat yourself and watch that movie
with with little dokey and then you know i got taken to

76
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:24,940
watch the south park movie i like remember bits of it in my
head i haven't rewatched i never rewatched this movie by the

77
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:35,280
way but i still remember it because uh because because you
know it was like i guess like ptsd because i was way too

78
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,320
young and i i was way too young and i should not have been i
only i watched like music videos of the songs from that

79
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:56,740
movie recently um but yes i was way too young to be watching
the Park movie but that's that's why I'm like this that's

80
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,900
why I'm sort of like this also ultimate thank you mr.

81
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:13,040
richard thank you thank you blame Canada blame Canada but
anyway anyway and then so I love South Park I a hundred

82
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:22,000
percent completed stick of truth I haven't touched the
Fractured but whole self-barking yet because I that was like

83
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,140
a game I really wanted to play on stream, but also was
really worried because like I play stick of truth and I know

84
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:33,660
like stick of truth was Incred- I shouldn't- I don't know if
I ever want to stream stick of truth on stream because of

85
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:46,240
how bad it is in terms It's really bad is it's so like but I
I haven't spoiled anything for for Fractured but whole

86
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,180
because like I I don't want it because like this is like one
of the rare moments where I don't want to be spoiled Because

87
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:58,200
like you have to be surprised like you have to go in
completely blind for that game like for like the self-park

88
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:06,680
games And so like but the thing is the only thing I know
about the the the fractured but whole game is the diabetes

89
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:19,680
kid Because like like that's the one of the cutscenes popped
up in my recommended and I watched it It was so good, but

90
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,940
that's the only thing I remember super diabetes.

91
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:34,160
Yes, that's the only thing I was able to like spoil myself
on But like I have not I don't know anything that's going on

92
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,840
in that game I know it's a sequel to the state of truth, but
like I try I didn't want to spoil it But I don't know if

93
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,640
it's appropriate.

94
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:50,320
I don't know if it's appropriate to stream Like, that's why
I haven't streamed it yet.

95
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,780
Maybe one day, one day.

96
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,960
Because I know Snake of Truth is so fucked up.

97
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,800
Anyway, I love South Park, and I keep up to date with South
Park.

98
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:09,120
But the thing about how risky it is to stream games on
launch, the thing is, is that...

99
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
Also, apparently we have to turn...

100
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,180
Let me turn down a little bit first.

101
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,060
Is that...

102
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,520
The thing about it is that...

103
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:25,540
I don't know how good the game is and then I checked the
reviews for this game and I was so sad because it's mixed

104
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:40,200
reviews I was so sad I was like no the reviews it's mixed
because they they've hit home runs on all their on the last

105
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:52,280
two games I was like no and okay I don't look okay IGN gave
it a three, but like, it's IGN, so I'm like, I don't know

106
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,080
how much I can trust IGN.

107
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,660
I was like, IGN has said some really weird shit about video
games, so I never really cared much about IGN reviews, but

108
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,020
they gave it a three, and I was like, no!

109
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,720
Why is it mixed?

110
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,260
I'm just like, why?

111
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,800
Apparently, the issue is that this game is very expensive.

112
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,480
Like, that is, like, one of the biggest issues for this
game.

113
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,400
It's, like, it's, like, way too expensive for how long...

114
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,300
It's apparently a five-hour game, max.

115
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Or, like, minimum.

116
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,240
It's...

117
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,760
Oh, sorry, minimum.

118
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,900
It's a minimum five-hour game.

119
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,060
And it's, like, basically, it's supposed to be, like, like,
a hack-and-slash.

120
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,380
It's, like, a hack-and-slash.

121
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:53,200
and uh people were complaining about how how uh five hours
for like a campaign and stuff but then they're they also

122
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,940
said they're gonna add more to it they're gonna add uh
they're gonna add more to the game later on but then people

123
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,680
were like whoa why is it only five hours because it's
multiplayer there's multiplayer elements to it so we're

124
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:17,220
gonna see ourselves we're gonna see ourselves why this game
is mixed we're gonna see by the way i bought the deluxe

127
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,500

128
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,840
I'm flashing that cred right here.

129
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,460
Alright.

130
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,920
Okay, I should have...

Okay, I...

Oh my god, it can be a gnome!

133
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,620
Wait, I can be a gnome?

134
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,860
Oh my god, get gnomed.

135
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,460
Every time you look at me, you're gonna get gnomed.

136
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,200
All right.

137
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh, wait.

138
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,900
Let's have... Okay.

139
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,200
All right.

140
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,060
Yellow.

141
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,780
Yellow hair.

142
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,780
And then... Do they have... No, they don't.

143
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,760
Okay.

144
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,440
Let's see.

145
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,800
They can't... I don't be bugged.

146
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,500
I can't be bugged.

147
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,820
That's fucked up.

148
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,720
I can't believe I can't be bugged.

149
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,060
Oh, I can be!

150
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,500
Oh, nice.

151
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,000
Guys, I can be.

152
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,660
I can be bugged.

153
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,260
Balding.

154
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,620
That's good enough.

155
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,620
That's good enough for me.

156
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,100
That's...

157
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Balding is good enough, you know.

158
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,780
It's almost like Bald.

159
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,600
I got cred.

160
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,640
I need people to know I paid $50.

161
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,240
I...

162
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:06,960
I need people to know that I didn't wait for the reviews and
I pre-ordered $50.

163
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:21,160
I pre-ordered for $50 I need people to know that I am that
shameless I did not read the reviews okay all right let's

164
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:33,340
see or it could be ginger oh wait I could be a ginger
balding wait it's not offensive because they're not real

165
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:44,040
people I should be careful I should be careful what I say
Okay, I'm gonna be...

166
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm gonna be a ginger.

167
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,200
They have no soul.

168
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,980
It's true!

169
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,660
If South Park says it's true, then it has to be, right?

170
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,700
I take my facts from...

171
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,860
I learn about my news from South Park because they're always
up to date.

172
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,460
Yeah, I'm gonna do...

173
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
Oh, you're ever gonna do the soulless.

174
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
Oh my god, there's e-boats.

175
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,140
Nice.

176
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,160
That's what I like to see.

177
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,260
All right.

178
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,140
Do they actually have, like, oh my god, they had the Snoopy
dance!

179
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,760
This is it.

180
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,340
This is the real gameplay.

181
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,160
The dancing is the real gameplay.

182
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,160
All right.

183
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,920
I'm done.

184
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:27,980
Finished.

185
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,140
Is that good?

186
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,060
What is this?

187
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,180
I don't know.

188
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:31,940
Clapping.

189
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,360
All right, here we go.

190
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm good.

191
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,020
I can be ginger.

192
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,900

Is there actually no subtitles?

205
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,280
Okay.

206
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,240
Oh, no, wait.

207
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,820
There actually is no.

208
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,160
Oh, there we go.

209
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,820
I was like, I forgot accessibility.

210
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,800
Okay, there you go.

211
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,240
I was going to be like, where the fuck is the subtitles?

212
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:32,220
I'm like, okay, I know you don't care so far, but damn, you
don't care about reading.

213
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,460
You actually don't care.

214
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,160
Nice.

215
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,920
Okay, nice.

216
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,420
We have, we can read now.

217
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,940
We can read.

218
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,080
That's so nice.

219
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,820
Are we on Discord?

220
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,160
Oh my god!

221
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,400
We're on Discord!

222
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,260
Okay, how do I get on top of the school?

223
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,860
There's South Park Elementary.

224
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,280
They understand that Doki Cat-Ri.

225
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,900
Alright, here we go.

226
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,540
You can hide in deep snow to protect you from any
projectiles.

227
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,320
And put you all you've been set on fire.

228
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,700
Stay in deep snow too long, however, will chill you with
slows and deal damage.

229
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,620
How do I...

230
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,040
Oh, that's where I could hide.

231
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,060
The discord went over.

232
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:17,980
Like...

233
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,080
The wizard says toilet paper is more precious than gold
right now.

234
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,200
Pick him up, new kid.

235
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,100
Oh my god.

236
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,720
That's mine.

237
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,080
Use that toilet paper like real money.

238
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,060
Use it to buy a weapon.

239
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,680
It's okay.

240
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,280
He doesn't know.

241
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,140
Oh my god, toilet paper is money?

242
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,640
No, I thought it was over.

243
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,660
Apparently COVID's coming back.

244
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,620
Did you guys hear that?

245
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,160
It's never over.

246
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,320
Bro, this is so fucked up.

247
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,320
All right.

248
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,280
Ooh, weapons.

249
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,580
Oh, Tolkien.

250
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,120
All right, you're armed now, new kid.

251
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,460
Now take out those snowmen to show you our battle ready.

252
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,060
Not yet.

253
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,680
It kind of never left.

254
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,780
We thought it left, but that was just us lying to ourselves.

255
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,540
Okay, and then hold to release for maximum attack.

256
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,060
Oh, nice.

257
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,540
All right.

258
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,780
All right.

259
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,580
Bro, wake up.

260
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,060
It's 2020 again.

261
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,760
Oh, upgrades.

262
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,100
But this game is also about using cards.

263
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,480
Each card is a new ability.

264
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,460
And here's your first one.

265
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,960
Where is I?

266
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,060
No.

267
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,120
I...

268
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,460
I thought...

269
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:29,780
What?

270
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,000
Self-park!

271
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,240
Powers and special skills.

272
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,820
I forgot.

273
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm the chosen one.

274
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,760
I'm the chosen one.

275
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,940
Powers and special skills you can use apart from your
weapons.

276
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,360
You have gained your first power now.

277
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,480
But later, you can equip up to two powers at once.

278
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,520
Unlock new powers by completing milestones and exploring
South Park.

279
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,520
Alright.

280
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,620
Is there like...

281
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,380
Oh my god, I can float.

282
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:53,820
No!

283
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,460
Please.

284
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,800
No!

285
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,440
No!

286
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,980
Alright.

287
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,300
Oh my god.

288
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,980
Bro, what the fuck happened to the school?

289
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,580
Holy shit.

290
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,360
I love how like the school looks amazing, by the way.

291
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,300
And then there's me.

292
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:30,240
looks actually at really I'm sorry but like the background
looks actually really good I just look so I don't look like

293
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,600
I blend well with the background

294
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:45,320
I this is not fit at all now look kids I know school's
closed but you should be at home doing remote learning no

295
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:58,720

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,220

seems easy.

298
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,220
That's alright.

299
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,920
They're younger than me.

300
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,260
They're younger than me.

301
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,880
It's called Survival of the Fittest.

302
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,780
If you live through my slashes, you get to go to first
grade.

303
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,360
Oh, shit.

304
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,640
Oh, wait, do I...

305
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,180
Oh, but there's a healer!

306
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,740
He's like a medic!

307
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,860
Is this Souls-like?

308
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,320
Oh, my God.

309
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,820
Finally a Souls-like game I like.

310
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,860
It's not actually Souls-like.

311
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,660
It's like a hack-and-slash, apparently.

312
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,000
Hoop!

313
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,560
How did I miss?

314
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,940
Oh!

315
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
I have to let go!

316
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,200
Okay.

317
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,380
Finally, the FPS portion of the game.

318
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,160
Okay, I definitely need to lower my sensitivity, then.

319
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,640
Oh my god, look at me go.

320
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,440
Please.

321
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,840
Please stop running.

322
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,080
Oh, I can stop.

323
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,960
Okay, thank you.

324
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,860
I was gonna say, I don't...

325
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,600
I don't think I'm level up Get some resources Got some basic
weapon skills And reviewed how to handle your cars Now it's

326
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,800
time for one last test Hey, you wanted to see me?

327
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,420
Who's this kid?

328
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,100
Are they playing?

329
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,820
No, not yet Wait, what is this elf doing here?

330
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:41,520
I thought we hate elves It's not racism Because they just
Go, go, new kid Kick that fucking elf ass I'm sorry I'm

331
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,560

332
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,960
Get back over here!

333
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,520
You're not real, you don't have rights!

334
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,900
You're an elf!

335
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,240
You got slants!

336
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,020
Oh shit!

337
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,940
It was a trap!

338
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,140
They're not human, they don't have human rights!

339
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,560
And elf rights do not exist yet.

340
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,020
Picking this healing totem card will add it to your powers.

341
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:25,880
Yeah, we can tell turkey all right nice plant a totem that
heals you and your allies for sure oh that's good also sound

342
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:37,840
guy how has the sound been good so far all right plant a
totem proper oh i get to heal okay e is healing okay well

343
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,700
done by the way your powers aren't unlimited you have to get
pissed off by healing if you aren't pissed off enough to use

344
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:54,020
your powers just keep beating up yay When they're pissed
off, you're pissed off meters increases by taking or dealing

345
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:00,120
damage using powers with decreased Oneness if you can't use
power fight with your weapons until you're pissed off again

346
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,240
Nice is that fucking food?

347
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,560
Am I just eating snacks?

348
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,620
Oh shit.

349
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,340
Where are the elves?

350
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,240
Oh shit Where did it come from?

351
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,300
How did I forget?

352
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,200
Okay, I need to remember guys

353
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,880
How do I weapon swap?

354
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,260
How do I weapon swap?

355
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,940
I forgot a weapon swap!

356
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,740
I already forgot!

357
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,320
Oh my god, I don't want to use my bow!

358
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,600
What is?

359
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,080
I'll be!

360
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,620
A, where's A?

361
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,400
No, that's not A.

362
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,160
It's moving!

363
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,080
Oh, it's just left click!

364
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,120
Oh my god, it's just left click.

365
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,340
I don't have to do anything.

366
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,420
It was just left click.

367
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,240
Right click was bow and then left click was sword.

368
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,020
Guys, I'm learning.

369
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,220
I should be a game tester.

370
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,760
Alright, there you go.

371
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,360
We're good, we're good.

372
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,820
We can do this.

373
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,000
We are so good at this game.

374
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,180
It's okay, I can't die.

375
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,720
Butter's just gonna heal me forever.

376
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,740
Great, thank you for the Akasupa.

377
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,940
Thank you, thank you.

378
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,040
The Super Chat is for Elves' rights.

379
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,760
Justice for Elves.

380
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,600
Thank you for the Akasupa.

381
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,660
If a ginger said Elves have no rights, that's when you know
it's serious.

382
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:17,820
Alright.

383
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,420
Nice.

384
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,020
I should be a game journalist, honestly.

385
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,640
Okay, flying daggers.

386
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,500
Dagger dive does four more damage after 0.3 seconds.

387
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,720
Creates a gas cloud that lingers.

388
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,500
Your arrow stuns distant enemies for six seconds and do 100%
more damage.

389
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,000
Oh my god.

390
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,660
I already have...

391
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,040
Oh, it's a legendary upgrade!

392
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,780
Nice.

393
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,060
I'm gaming.

394
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,460
Thank you, Jimmy.

395
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,220
I really appreciate it.

396
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,800
Now where do I go?

397
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,700
Wait, there's more?

398
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,740
Oh god.

399
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,160
Okay, give me a sec.

400
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,400
I want to use my cool-ass ability.

401
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
I can't believe they got actual kids to do this.

402
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,480
Do you know, like, for the kids' voice acting?

403
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,940
Like, Trey gets his child to do the voice acting.

404
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,820
I think they get, like, actual staff kids.

405
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,820
They actually get, like, the staff's children to do the
voice acting for the kids.

406
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,000
Which is, like, you know...

407
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,380
I guess you don't have to pay them.

408
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,200
You just pay yourself at that point.

409
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,100
Yeah, they're actual real kids.

410
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,580
Yeah.

411
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,360
Yeah, his daughter does, like, some of the children voice
acting.

412
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,280
All right, let's get the audio in.

413
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:39,260
We gotta boost up the sound effect by five, and then bring
down the music by five.

414
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:39,780
Okay.

415
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
Let me know if it's okay now, sound guy.

416
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,360
The cards are dealt randomly, but just between us, I can
reshuffle them for a little bit.

417
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,920
put i always forget the colors i always i always forget the
colors for like what the rarity so i'm so glad that they

418
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:01,840
actually tell me because i always forget all right bar
escape deals 20 30 percent more damage and pulls enemies

419
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:13,360
inwards nice but can i not buy it am i poor choose an
upgrade i want this oh upgrade to get oh they're forcing me

420
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,980
to upgrade from what if it's good never mind this is how
powerful it is.

421
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,500
Thank you.

422
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,620
Oh my gosh, they know children don't fucking read.

423
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,220
The keeper of the rules dictates the rarities.

424
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,640
But for a little TP, I can make them more powerful.

425
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,720
All upgrade cards have a level each of which offers.

426
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,160
Yeah!

427
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:31,720
Okay.

428
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,720
Can upgrade rarity for a bribe.

429
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,760
Oh, it's a bribe.

430
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:36,980
Nice.

431
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,240
Teacher says corruption.

432
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,240
Okay.

433
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,760
Double tapping a target with Boa creates 10 damage.

434
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,340
Six meter blast.

435
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,640
Wait, that's so good.

436
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,600
However, to promote Can I promote it even more?

437
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,900
Ultra legendary!

438
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,560
That's the one.

439
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,200
Nice.

440
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,680
Toki planning to be an IGN Gaitrin.

441
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,380
Look, my only issue is that I don't read.

442
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,880
Other than that.

443
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,620
Oh my god, he's a bigger elf!

444
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,020
Why are they feeding these elf children?

445
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,300
Oh my god, I knew it.

446
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:26,680
I knew we should trust these elves get out get away from me
look my only issue is i don't read okay like that the moment

447
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:35,840
i figure out the mechanics i'm like out of game journalism
territory like oh my god there's so many of them there's so

448
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:48,660
many of them okay don't worry see we got this but it's so
smart though to getting your kids to like get your kids to

449
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,740
do the voice acting because then you're technically paying
yourself, you know?

450
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,820
You're technically just paying yourself so you don't lose
money.

451
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:03,980
Whoa!

452
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,720
If you don't have full session of 4, these allies will show
up to aid you.

453
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,660
They'll leave once the fight.

454
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,020
If another player joins your session at any time, one of
these other kids.

455
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,000
Nice.

456
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,200
I got free labor.

457
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,480
Look at that.

458
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,720
They get bigger and loud.

459
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,940
So true.

460
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,060
Yay!

461
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:26,780
TP!

462
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,960
Wait, how do I open up multiplayer so you guys can join us?

463
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,720
Wait, what's the bullshit?

464
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,960
What's bullshit?

465
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,040
Enemy leaders can play bullshit cards during combat to gain
an unfair advantage.

466
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:56,620
it to only a few uses but they're really powerful just now
cow just upgraded one of his elven swarmers to a vampire

467
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:07,720
what the there's back there's vampires in my fantasy
mythical shit what is this oh it increased health and new

468
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:17,720
attacks what if vampires i thought were lord of the rings i
thought there's no vampires in my lord of the rings rip off

469
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,900
Like...

470
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,760
Okay.

471
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,140
Get him.

472
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,120
Get him.

473
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,020
Team Edward.

474
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,200
The vampires are fantasy.

475
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,260
Yeah, but it's medieval fantasy.

476
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,940
We're being like sticklier here.

477
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,880
That's why it's bullshit.

478
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,080
It's Castlevania now.

479
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,260
So, as you can see, we've had to make some changes to the
game because some asshole who we won't name, Decided to

480
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,300
become all powerful and ruin the stick of truth because I
mean that's different you kid So then we played superheroes

481
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:01,080
and guess what happened that same someone got all OP again
and fucking ruined that game too And now because of that

482
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,660
someone I thought you're bad at the game Carmen and then
once there were rules Everyone started arguing over the

483
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,960
rules and then we all went to war again Remember with this
new card based system.

484
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:18,000
You're only as powerful as the cards in your hand and you
only get two to start with Yeah, because aliens are real I'm

485
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,540
sure you'll manage.

486
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,160
Don't worry, I don't need to ruin this game of the game.

487
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,100
Ruin it himself.

488
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,820
Because this is America.

489
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,080
So, you are now the king of two cards.

490
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,740
That's me.

491
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,600
Clyde has information that the elves are preparing to launch
a massive attack on our kingdom.

492
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,120
They've been spotted advancing their forces near Stark's
pond.

493
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,840
We have to take them out before they kill us off.

494
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,660
Oh, and new kid?

495
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,160
This mission will be very dangerous.

496
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,300
So, I'm pairing you with some other new kids who also
recently moved to town.

497
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,860
But keep in mind, you are the real new kid.

498
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,160
Those other new kids.

499
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,960
Yeah, you heard that?

500
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,480
I'm the real one that matters.

501
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,680
Okay, you're the big dog.

502
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,020
Yeah, me Also, I'm going to sign you.

503
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,600
I have Kray at random.

504
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,740
No big deal, but there's a chance I might not give you
number one.

505
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,220
What?

506
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,320
Just know that you're still the best new kid to me.

507
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,860
You're the important one But I have Kray.

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,720
Good luck.

509
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,020
How can I not be number one?

510
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,360
I paid like $20 more than the other regular children.

511
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,540
That's actual bullshit.

512
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,560
What's the point of paying worth money if I'm not number
one?

513
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,860
Three plus one.

514
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,920
Why am I always wife number four?

515
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,840
I'm here and I'll show you how to wage war on my behalf.

516
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,840
And bring your friends if they're not pussy.

517
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,720
Okay, yeah.

518
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,840
This is my war table.

519
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,300
You can choose your mission on the map.

520
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,180
And tell me when you're ready to head to the front lines.

521
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,820
If you want to join someone else's game, you can totally
just be a follower.

522
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,560
Okay, sled matchmaking button.

523
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,020
Oh, okay, wait.

524
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,540
I want to talk to the other kids.

525
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,220

526
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880

00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,160
Select the psycho-rarity to see how they scale.

528
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,680
Okay, and then change levels.

529
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,180
Select the option, train what bothers again by selecting the
tutorial buttons while learning about the books of laws.

530
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:02,700
Thank God.

531
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,420
Okay, I was like, I actually don't want to do the tutorial.

532
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,800
All right, let's see.

533
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,580
What else is there?

534
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,540

535
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,780

539
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,860
Is that toilet paper?

540
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,300
Weak and I run the shop together.

541
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,680

542
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,980
Oh my gosh, so romantic.

543
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,360
I love, I don't know if you guys ever watched the episode
where they like, hook them up, but they actually use like

544
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,200
real fan art, like real like shipping fan art for their
episode.

545
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,260
Like they didn't draw that.

546
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:43,540
They were like, hey guys, if you're like a Twi Clyde
shipper, send us some fan art so we can, oh my god.

547
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,480

00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,640

can head back to the war table whenever you're prepared and

551
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:21,500

your limits give it a try Oh, I want to be stronger.

Yeah, I want to be stronger with bows.

553
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,960
We bought our skin three.

554
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,760
Keep taking in that dark matter.

555
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,000
And you'll get more powerful than you can imagine.

556
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,420
And you don't know about Mr. Hanke.

557
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,660
He's the Christmas spirit.

558
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,800
Because we all have a little Mr. Hanke inside of us.

559
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,320
No matter what.

560
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,700
He's the Christmas spirit.

561
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:44,940
All right.

562
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:45,840
Let's see.

563
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,220
Armor.

564
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,860
Oh, this is like gear and stuff.

565
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,540
Alright, what's this?

566
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,780
I heard you want to try out some new hardware.

567
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,640
Oh, look at that!

568
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,580
Tolkien!

569
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,960
I'm sure I have at least one new thing for you to take out
into the field.

570
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,280
I've got a ranged weapon for you to try.

571
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,260
Either way, you can head back to the war table whenever
you're prepared.

572
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,300
Not prepared.

573
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,620
Wizard staff on for size.

574
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,740
Wizard staff?

575
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,080
Oh, a lot of fireballs that burn many targets at once
charged up for it.

576
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,040
Oh, I want to try magic.

577
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,660
Come and visit whenever you want to switch things up.

578
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,740
Ah, yes, Tolkien.

579
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,500
It's always been Tolkien.

580
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Do you know, like, ever since the Tolkien episode, they,
like, they, they, like, changed every official, like,

581
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:34,540
Wikipedia episode guide, like, on, every official online,
um, information about Tolkien to Tolkien.

582
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,540
The moment that episode, this is, like, actual gaslighting.

583
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,860
Yeah, they switched the subtitles, so it's actually crazy
that they went through all that.

584
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,320
Leave the matchmaking.

585
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,260
Okay, hold.

586
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,340
I want Woo!

587
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,560
Okay, and then Hold and release.

588
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,640
Oh, I can, like, do, like, a strong fire blast, too.

589
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,920
How do I leave the matchmaking?

590
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,700
Do I just, like, oh, I just have to queue up and then
release it again.

591
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,060
Man, I think you've been super chat.

00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,120
Thank you.

597
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,580
Tell me when you're ready to head to the front lines.

598
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,440
You can join someone else's game if you want.

599
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,760
Not everyone is cut out for the glory of leadership.

600
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:22,680
Alright.

601
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Just mark your name here if you want back up that bad.

602
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,240

603
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:27,920
Alright.

604
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,720
We can get started as soon as you're ready.

605
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,440
Alright, I want to host a game.

606
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,220
Host.

607
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,080
Wait, can I...

00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,880
Oh, chapter one!

609
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,280
We're gonna do super hard.

610
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,420
How hard can that be as a kid's game?

611
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,600
Like, it's a game set in a children's town.

612
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,940
It can't be that hard.

613
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,440
Select a chapter?

614
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,820
Wait, can I not host game?

615
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,380
What the fuck?

616
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
How do I host a game?

617
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,820
No!

618
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,280
How do I host it?

619
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,370
Oh, damn it!

620
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,010
Oh, I'm still in the tutorial?

621
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,430
The tutorial never ended?

622
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,430
Like, what?

623
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,030
What do you mean the tutorial never ended?

624
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,910
Wait, where do you?

625
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,810

All right, begin hosting.

628
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:36,190
Okay, everyone can join, but I'm number one, okay, because
I'm the real new kid.

629
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,190
You're not the real new kid.

630
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,290
I don't even know how to... Is that it?

631
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,170
Is that... Let's pick who you're gonna brutalize today.

632
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,110
Did I host it?

633
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,570
Like, it's a tutorial.

634
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,710

Do I have to wait?

646
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,110
Do I have to wait to start this?

647
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,230

00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,270

00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,890
They're at another school.

682
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,230
As the keeper of rules, it is my honor to preside over this
bullshit trap.

683
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,310
Begin your selection.

684
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,770

695
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,410
Your entire team emits noxious fumes to gross out enemies.

696
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,910
Summon that fight for you.

697
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:52,690
You become invisible.

698
00:43:52,790 --> 00:44:00,530
Okay, I need to summon minions because apparently I'm just
an army of fucking one And a boost to our double daggers

00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,430
They have two cards!

709
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,010

00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,350
What will we do?

711
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,450

00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:43,610
It was fucking elves.

715
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,590
You're even below gingers who have no soul.

716
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,470
All right, here we go.

717
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,510
I can't believe they get two cards!

718
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,550

857
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,290
Do I want dark matter?

858
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,090
I feel like raise the love of all your upgrade cards.

859
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,610
I feel like I don't really need that.

860
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,030
Like, my dragoons will be fine.

861
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,690
Sacrifice to the darkness.

862
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:46,650
Nice.

863
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,370
There's not much to do around here.

864
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,010

I have fire.

875
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,810
I actually... I miss old Randy.

876
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,850
I think Tegrity Farms Randy is like...

877
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,590
They pushed too hard on the character.

878
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,310
No DLC in this standard.

879
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,410
Wait, what's that?

880
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,930
There's like stuff here.

881
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:36,310
There's like stuff over there.

882
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:36,870
What is that?

883
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,730
Is that bowling ball?

884
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:39,690
What the fuck is that?

885
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,310
Wait, that is a bowling ball.

886
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,510
Elves must have run off somewhere.

887
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,370
Did I not...

888
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,050
Free this?

889
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,510
This is literally fireball magic.

890
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,270
It's real fireball magic.

891
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,090
Yeah, I miss old Randy.

892
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:58,150
I think that's like one of the changes I didn't like with
the new self-park.

893
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,670
Like, I'm like okay with new self-park, but like Integrity
Farms, Randy, was just too much.

894
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,750
I think they did like...

895
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,230
I think it ruined the Randy character for me.

896
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,890
Because they tried to make him like...

897
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,790
Because now they just...

898
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,230
It's just too much Randy.

899
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,110
It's too much Randy.

900
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,950
But it's not like good Randy too.

901
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:22,890
What are you doing?

902
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:23,850
You barbecuing?

903
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,630
Wait, how do I do this?

904
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,990
Entering campsite.

905
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:35,890
What the fuck was the bowling ball for?

906
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,430
I don't know what the bowling ball for.

907
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,050
Do you want to tell me where your secret base is?

908
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:40,930
No.

909
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:41,890
Damage.

910
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:42,270
Fine.

911
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,510
Kick all their asses, you kids.

912
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,290
Me and my virile dragoons are gonna kick your ass.

913
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,130
They have shields now?

914
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:51,990
What the fuck?

915
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,170
Dragoons!

916
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,370
My very real dragoons, where are you?

917
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:01,110
What?

918
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,570
How are they doing that?

919
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,250
Guys!

920
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,710
Oh, nuts!

921
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,530
There you go!

922
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,030
I know you guys were here!

923
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,170
I knew you guys came here!

924
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,090
I knew you guys were in real!

925
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,990
I told you!

926
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,170
I told you they're real!

927
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,830
The internet cut out.

928
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,270
Like, it was an internet issue, but they're here now!

929
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,170
They're here now, chat!

930
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:27,570
Look!

931
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,130
Look, there they are!

932
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:30,970
There they are!

933
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,710
The dial-up!

934
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,510
It works!

935
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,850
Sorry, a lot of them are on dial-up right now.

936
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,410
Mom had to use the phone!

937
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,070
Mom had to use the phone, but they're here now.

938
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,390
Remember Randy was on Wheel of Fortune?

939
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,470
No, not on the Wheel of Fortune.

940
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:50,550
No.

941
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,250
Okay.

942
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:54,650
All right, get over here.

943
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:56,670
Get over here.

944
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,410
I'm trying my best to kill the Healer Dragoons.

945
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,530
What are you trying to say?

946
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:04,670
Australian Internet.

947
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:05,330
Yeah, yeah.

948
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,610
One of them is on Australian Internet.

949
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,230
The other is on, like, dial-up.

950
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:15,150
And then the other two, they're using data right now.

951
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:24,050
play in america so like that's why they're cutting in and

953
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:45,090

they're like they're going through a tunnel chat it makes

954
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,510
perfectly sense.

955
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:52,350
See, oh no, they drive straight, drove through a tunnel
again.

956
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,190
Ziplining is stupid.

957
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,050
Elves are stupid.

958
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:55,830
It all makes sense.

959
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,410
Don't get distracted by the zip lines.

960
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:59,950
They look way more fun than they are.

961
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,230
The elves probably hit the keys in the back near the office.

962
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,350
Wait, why are they hiding Randy's keys?

963
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,590
Alright, let's see.

964
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:10,450
Oh my god.

965
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:11,330
Dragons!

966
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:13,030
Get out of the tunnel!

967
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,030
Oh!

968
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:14,470
Oh!

969
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,050
Drago, it's the tunnel!

970
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,390
Oh my god!

971
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,410
One of them's out of the tunnel now!

972
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:22,010
Nice.

973
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:22,570
Look at them.

974
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:27,950
They came out of the fucking... You can tell they were in
the tunnel because they just suddenly lagged in.

975
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:28,730
You can tell.

976
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,370
Look at that.

977
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:36,610
They're back.

978
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:37,650

979
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:38,150

00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,270
Oh, it's the magic!

982
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:43,110

1033
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:14,890
This is it.

1034
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:16,490
We got this.

1035
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,550
We got this, my real dragon.

1036
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,310
We're gonna do this together.

1037
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:24,930
Alright.

1038
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:28,930
No, the shield.

1039
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:32,010
If you can't deal with your people, maybe you can get a
friend who can.

1040
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,570
What do you mean?

1041
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,250
I can deal with this.

1042
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,030
I thought I was feeling it.

1043
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,950
Okay, nice.

1044
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:38,590

01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:39,330
Okay.

1046
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:40,010
You know what?

1047
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,050
I think I might have to use.

1048
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:42,650
I think I have to use this.

1049
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,030
It's bullshit time.

1050
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:46,930
It's bullshit time.

1051
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,190
Oh, victory.

1052
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:49,530

All right, now.

01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:52,890
It's okay.

1056
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,030
They're moral support.

1057
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:56,490
It's okay.

1058
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,990
We have the moral support.

1059
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:05,870
My moral support crew.

1060
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,110
Where the fuck is the exit?

1061
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:09,950
I'm lost already.

1062
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:12,950

01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,370

01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,070
We got to get the gas.

1083
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:36,690
There's a cannon.

1084
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,690
Now you can break that block of ice with a cannonball.

1085
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,730
Oh, wait.

1086

paper in the fucking trash can.

There was a cannonball right there.

1120
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,610
I did not have to walk this far.

1121

Thank you.

1133
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,870
Why would elf tracks lead to a waterfall?

1134
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:22,310
What is this?

1135
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:23,970
Overlook point.

Is this lady okay?

1142
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,180

1143
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,640

1144
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,140
Bro, what the fuck?

1145
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:47,560
Oh, no.

1146
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,600
She's an influencer.

1147
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,880
We don't go near those people.

1148
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,300
Jimmy, look away.

1149
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,560
That's an influencer.

1150
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,720
Don't go near them.

1151
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,140
Alright.

1152
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:00,920
She's fine.

1153
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,840
She's just influencing.

1154
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:04,760
Grab the gas can, you kid.

1155
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,360
It's right there.

1156
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,460
Alright, I'm gonna grab it.

1157
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,120
Well, you're fucked.

1158
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:07,740
Oh, no.

1159
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,200
It was a trap.

1160
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:13,300
Who would have thought it was a trap all along?

1161
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,680
I can't believe it.

1162
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,340
How could we have known that?

1163
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,040
How could we have known that it was a trap?

1164
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,640
Okay, nice.

1165
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:35,080

1166
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,240

1167

01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,580
Oh, it's okay.

01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,220

1176
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:05,400

1177
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,540

What a coincidence.

1208
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,360
They're in the tunnel again.

1209
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,140
Guys, what a fucking coincidence.

1210
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,140
Oh my god!

1211
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,580

1212
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,600
What the fuck, you have a shield?

1213
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:06,620
This man played a game before I played a game.

1214
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,800
Here's what fate has in store.

1215
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,600
What do I have?

1216
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:10,860
Uncommon.

1217
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,040
It shoots to...

1218
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,660
You know I'm going to reshuffle.

1219
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:15,980
I don't like these cards.

1220
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,060
Are these more to your satisfaction?

1221
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:18,780
Uncommon.

1222
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:19,780
Enemies drop.

1223
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:20,600

We don't need health.

1271
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,600
We're gonna live forever.

1272
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,140

1280
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,560

Hard mode is actually hard mode.

1396
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,940
The moment I get to him, he's already, like, traveled 20
meters away from me.

1397
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,040
Where did he go?

1398
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,720
Where did he go?

01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,140
He's over there.

1417
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:33,960
He's over here.

1418
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:35,800
Oh, my god.

1419
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,240

He's running.

1442
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,720
He's a coward.

1443
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,020
He's so scared.

01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,360
He can't teleport anymore.

He's scared.

1449
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,500
He can't teleport.

1450
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:06,400
We can do this.

1451
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,280
He lost all his powers.

1452
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,200
Go after him.

1453
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,000
Oh, he teleported chat.

1454
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,200
Who would have thought he teleported?

1455
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:16,840
Who would have thought?

1456
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,200
Oh my god, he's one bar.

1457
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:18,840
He's one bar.

1458
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,220
This is it.

1459
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,660
This is it.

1460
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:22,920

01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:32,040
Please, he's one hit.

1464
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,680
He's literally so close to dying.

1465
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:35,960
Oh, one hit.

1466
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,240
Dive into that.

1467
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,600
I'm just gonna use my staff.

1468
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:40,840
Where did he go?

1469
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,100
The planet is against you.

1470
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,300
Where did he go?

1471
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:44,920
No!

1472
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,260
She's got this.

1473
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:48,580
I got this!

1474
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:49,160
I've got it!

1475
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:49,640
Yes!

1476
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:52,320
Easy.

1477
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,960
So fucking easy.

1478
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:56,980
Yes!

1479
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,120
Yes, I did it!

1480
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,840
You know what, Kyle?

1481
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:02,800
I learned something today.

1482
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,100
You're a little bitch.

1483
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:05,280
Fuck you, Carmen.

1484
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,320
Yay!

1485
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:11,420
We did it.

1486
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,680
We killed Kyle.

1487
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,280
Yay!

1488
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,840
Why are we going to meet Kenny?

1489
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,740
Why are we going to meet Princess Kenny?

1490
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,020
There's a chest!

1491
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:19,600
There's a chest!

1492
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:20,720
Okay.

1493
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:21,840
Snack break.

1494
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,560
I'm going to open this chest first.

1495
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:25,960
Snack break.

1496
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,060
We have a little snack break.

1497
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:32,960
Alright.

1498
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,880
Is there, like, any more loot that we're missing?

1499
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,900
If you guys knew the slow one is, you should just, like, rip
on them.

1500
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,340
Is there any more loot?

1501
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:40,440
I think we were fine.

1502
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,300
Alright, I'm coming over.

1503
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:42,980
No!

1504
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:43,380
No!

1505
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:44,200
Yeah!

1506
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,380
You picked up a bunch of dark matter.

1507
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:45,980
Hi, Madden.

1508
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,880
We did it.

1509
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,500
I knew we were gamers.

1510
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,660
I knew we were gamers.

1511
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,200
Look at that.

1512
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:03,080
Look at all these fucking achievements we made together.

1513
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,060
Me and my real dragons.

1514
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:06,740
Proceed.

1515
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,700
What the fuck does...

1516
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:11,920
Oh, dark matter.

1517
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:13,540
I got the most damage done.

1518
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:15,960
Look at that.

1519
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,620
I had the most DPS.

1520
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:18,620
Yes.

1521
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:23,790
Is it lorita?

1522
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:25,130
Well, well, well.

1523
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,520
Well, well, well.

1524
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:32,780
You just thought you could do anything you wanted, didn't
you?

1525
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,700
You just thought you were so smart.

1526
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:35,740
I beat you, Cal.

1527
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,660
And now by rule, you have to follow my rules here at Coupa
Keep.

1528
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:40,280
Those are the rules, right, Your Honor?

1529
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,520
Those are the rules.

1530
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:41,880
Yes.

1531
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,560
You didn't beat me, fat ass.

1532
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,480
The new kid did.

1533
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,600
And who are those other three kids they were playing with?

1534
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,600
Oh, those were the other new kids.

1535
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:48,960
Yeah.

1536
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,840
They all think they're the actual new kid, but... Yeah, I'm
the one that matters.

1537
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,600
I'm number one.

1538
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:53,780
That's why I'm always the host.

1539
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,700
You're all just minor copies of me.

1540
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:00,840
Why did you attack my fucking base?

1541
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,400
Attack your base.

1542
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:02,820
Ha!

1543
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:03,600
Ha!

1544
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:07,520
Are you denying that you were gearing up your entire army to
attack our fucking base?

1545
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:08,080
Yeah.

1546
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:08,940
Yeah!

1547
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:09,860
Says who?

1548
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:11,020
Says Clyde.

1549
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:11,620
Yeah.

1550
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,040
And do you always trust what Clyde says?

1551
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,680
Yeah, because he's not our elf.

1552
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:16,640
Yeah.

1553
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:17,940

1554
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,820
We are gearing up to attack someone else.

1555
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,820

01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:41,800
winter spell that kind of magic has been outlawed ever since
the new kid ruined the last game by farting backwards in

1559
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:47,920
time yeah well it's been done i know it and what i believe
to have cast this who would do such a thing the same person

1560
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:53,900
who's Stan has been acting strange.

1561
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,980
Ever since he thought his version of the rules were best.

1562
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,060
Where is Stan?

1563
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,340
Must be Man Bear Pig.

1564
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,480
But then the new kid came and got in the way.

1565
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,220
Wow, nice going, new kid.

1566
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:03,920
What?

1567
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,020
What the fuck did I do?

1568
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,420
There's been no fun and games for you guys, but this storm
isn't going to end.

1569
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,960
And our town is in serious trouble.

1570
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,020
Oh, geez.

1571
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,440
Then we have no choice.

1572
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,800
New kid, we must get to the Marshwalker.

1573
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,020
And find out what he's been hiding.

1574
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,560
Stan's gonna be evil?

1575
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,420
You're loaded with dark matter.

1576
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,280
Oh my god.

1577
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,440

Time to set a battle plan.

I can't start the mission!

1662
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,740
So you're stuck waiting because of one inconsiderate at all.

1663
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:38,600

1664

01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,400

Guys, death war.

1677
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,180

1678
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,020
Oh my god.

1679
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,760
Guys, okay.

1680
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:24,720
I hate to do this.

1681
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:27,660
I hate to do this to you.

1682
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:34,740
But I have to I have to start my lobby.

1683
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,820
I need to start the lobby.

1684
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,260
And you have to put him down.

1685
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:47,400
Don't look.

1686
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,960
I took him behind the barn.

1687
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,360
Endless winter spell.

1688
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,540
Magic far beyond his primitive mind.

1689
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,700
I had to take him outside, didn't I?

1690
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,680
I had to take him behind the barn.

1691
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,140
Don't worry, he's gonna come back.

1692
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,860
I took him to the farm downstate.

1693
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,820
Alright, he's at the farm downstate right now.

1694
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:10,470
Alright, here we go.

1695
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:18,570
The Hydra revealed that the Barbarian King Stan and the
Marsh Walkers casted a bad endless winter spell.

1696
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:20,950
He must be stopped.

1697
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:22,850
Dragos.

1698
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:25,390
I know you're all stuck in that traffic jam.

1699
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:35,790
I know you're all in that tunnel chat You're all in that
fucking tunnel right now, but please don't overload the

1700
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:42,050
servers chat Don't don't don't don't overload the servers.

1701
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:44,330
I know it's so hard hard in demand

1702
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:58,630
What the fuck is it?

1703
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:01,230
Cartman you don't belong here.

1704
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:02,990
Fuck you I'm the Grand Wizard.

1705
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:04,210
I belong everywhere.

1706
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:12,910
Since, we know you're not going to win this because your
fucking army are not even relevant characters in South Park.

1707
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:14,550
There's a rumor he's using banned spells.

1708
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:15,650
I'm the wizard.

1709
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:17,350
I'm the only one that gets to use banned spells.

1710
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:19,690
Why don't you and I just settle this now, Cartman?

1711
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:20,610
One on one.

1712
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:23,030
Whoever wins gets to decide the rules forever.

1713
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:23,650
Enough!

1714
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:28,490
I mean, we ought to lay out the Grand Rule so we can get
started.

1715
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,990
So go ahead and lay out your cards.

1716
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:34,150
Okay, I don't really have a lot of cards.

1717
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:35,810
Oh!

1718
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:38,430
The wand cast chain lightning for...

1719
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:38,810
Oh!

1720
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:40,370
I got chain lightning!

1721
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:42,130
I got chain lightning.

1722
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:43,510
That's pretty OP.

1723
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:46,390
Uh...

1724
01:35:46,690 --> 01:35:49,550
You become invisible and healed up while cloaked.

1725
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:58,170
Your entire team emits noxious fumes to grow so you can jump
higher, run forever, and move faster.

1726
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:59,910
Okay, that's a lie.

1727
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:02,050
Like, it runs out.

1728
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:13,890
If I can use it five times, it means I can't run forever
Like, what the fuck?

1729
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:16,890
It should be one use if I can run forever

1730

times.

1732
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:37,590
We can't handle.

1733
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:40,130
Remember, you brought this on yourself.

1734
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:41,870
Cursed arms.

1735
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:42,690
Cursed?

1736
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:46,090
You hear melee weapons become useless?

1737
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:47,590
What the fuck?

1738
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:50,490
These are the tools of our rage.

1739
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:54,630
Three, four cards, five cards?

1740
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,910
A plus ten axe, you can't do that.

1741
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,010
Yes, I can do it.

1742
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:00,650
I forged it by completing a quest.

1743
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:01,730
It's totally legal.

1744
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:04,990
Oh, he went to Home Depot.

1745
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:08,910
Damage grab is a plus 10 axe legal.

1746
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:09,650
What?

1747
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:11,530
Kenny?

1748
01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:15,090
Okay, who the fuck is...

1749
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:17,550
Oh, no, it's like, that's not Kenny.

1750
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:21,390
So, we're still gonna beat the shit out of you.

1751
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:24,590
Ask Kyle how my plus 10 wizard balls taste because you're
next.

1752
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:25,830
This is bullshit.

1753
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:29,490
Fucking five cards.

1754
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:31,050
Son of a bitch.

1755
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:36,650
I can't be on the front of the line, but I'll be in the back
casting spells and doing wizard sheds to keep you all safe.

1756
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,260
Where's my 50 million power?

1757
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,040
Alright.

1758
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,060
Where do I go?

1759
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,440
It's okay, guys.

1760
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:52,120
Don't worry.

1761
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:55,000
The drag who I kicked is definitely coming back.

1762
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,040
He still has one more hour of the game.

1763
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,800
Oh, I have like...

1764
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,360
It's hot.

1765
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,000
It's not like fire anymore.

1766
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:08,280
It's like electricity.

1767
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,220
Oh, I see.

1768
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,100
Wait, this is so OP.

1769
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:13,900
Look at this.

1770
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:17,160
This is actually so OP if I hit the shot.

1771
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:21,680
If I hit the shot, it's so OP, chat.

1772
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:22,240
I swear.

1773
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:23,380
If I hit it.

1774
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:24,960
There you go.

1775
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,380
I just electricity forever.

1776
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,240
And I like...

1777
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:30,860
Okay, yeah.

1778
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,240
I just need to wait for the charge.

1779
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,180
I just do this.

1780
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,560
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1781
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,000
It's still OP, even if I miss.

1782
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,120
It's still OP, okay?

1783
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:48,080
It still works.

1784
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,040
Pew, pew, pew.

1785
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:51,160
God damn it.

1786
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,920
Pew, pew, pew.

1787
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:53,920
Pew.

1788
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,460
Alright, what the fuck is that?

1789
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:56,800
Pew, pew.

1790
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,420
Who made that sound?

1791
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,220
Where did that sound come from?

1792
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,080
Do you guys hear that?

1793
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,660
There was no bicycles next to me.

1794
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,320
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1795

There you go.

1854
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,140
We have to make sure he doesn't life steal, because he's
been, like, living forever because of that.

1855
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:31,840
Hey, it's toilet paper.

Christian friendly game, by the way.

1869
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:10,260

I can't believe.

1871
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,600

From sticks to kind of floppy snakes.

1884
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:47,100
That's okay.

1885
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:50,800

1907
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:10,270
Who taught you kids how to climb?

1908
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:14,590
Okay, we got, oh my, okay, Nudo's gone.

1909
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:15,490
Nudo's gone.

1910
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:18,830
Guys, don't worry, they're not burning to death, guys.

1911
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:21,530
It's just all make-believe.

1912
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:28,330
It's all make-believe they're not actually burning to death.

1913
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:29,350
They'll be fine.

1914
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:31,670
They'll be fine.

1915
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:33,550
The kids don't actually die.

1916
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:35,350
The final wave is coming.

1917
01:45:35,470 --> 01:45:36,790
Where the fuck is the final wave?

1918
01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:39,630
It's just pretend, chat.

1919
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:41,610
It's just pretend.

1920
01:45:43,990 --> 01:45:44,630
Alright.

1921
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:46,250
How can we find you?

1922
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:47,350
I don't even know.

1923
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:51,150
I don't even know how people are going to find my session.

1924
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:52,410
But that's...

1925
01:45:52,410 --> 01:45:54,110
This is why I'm the host.

1926
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,630
I'll always be number one.

1927
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:57,330
Jimmy!

1928
01:45:58,330 --> 01:45:59,050
Any upgrades?

1929
01:45:59,410 --> 01:46:00,330
There's still cop...

1930
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:01,750
Who's still alive?

1931
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:05,870
I killed everybody.

1932
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:07,170
I mean, like...

1933
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:08,830
I pretend killed everybody.

1934
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:10,370
Oh.

1935
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:11,570
Oh, they're up there.

1936
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:14,510
Alright.

1937
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:17,710
I think it would be a lot easier if I joined somebody's
party.

1938
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:19,570
But like...

1939
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:19,710
Oh.

1940
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:23,990
Oh my god, you were in the fucking snow this entire time.

1941
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:25,950
Can't believe it.

1942
01:46:26,490 --> 01:46:27,350
I can't believe it.

1943
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:28,550
I can't even see him.

1944
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:32,150
My magic wand won't let me see.

1945
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:33,810
Pew, pew, pew.

1946
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:37,210
I need to get him out of the invisibility and then use...

1947
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:38,750
He fucking full healed?

1948
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:42,150
God, these guys are the worst.

1949
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:45,190
These guys are actually the worst.

1950
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:47,850
They can full heal if they hit us.

1951
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,290
No, no, don't let him.

1952
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:51,290
Don't let him life steal.

1953
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:52,470
Don't let him life steal.

1954
01:46:52,630 --> 01:46:53,390
He's 1 HP.

1955
01:46:54,430 --> 01:46:54,750
Nice.

1956
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:57,470
Okay.

1957
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:59,970
No, no, I messed it up.

1958
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:01,150
Wee!

1959
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:02,950
How do I mess that up twice?

1960
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:03,870
All right.

1961
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:04,650
Yay!

1962
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:08,430
We did it!

1963
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:11,890
Jimmy, I did it, Jimmy!

1964
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:23,070
Mon flames leave fire patches that last four seconds and
deals three damage.

1965
01:47:24,670 --> 01:47:29,690
Oh, wait, I feel like the Molot... Okay, I feel like you
should get napalm.

1966
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:31,650
I think that would be really good.

1967
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:33,070
I don't want to waste my money yet.

1968
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:34,610
Alright, let's go.

1969
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:35,750
Let's go dragons.

1970
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:40,750
Entering Main Street.

1971
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:42,870
Oh hey guys.

1972
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:45,970
Find Stan and smash his army.

1973
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:48,290
And then kick him in the boughs if you can.

1974
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:52,480
Here!

1975
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,460
Your army won't help you, Cartman!

1976
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:55,800
You're gonna die today!

1977
01:47:57,650 --> 01:47:59,890
I said you're gonna die today!

1978
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:01,390
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna die!

1979
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:14,600
What the fuck?

1980
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:20,910
Bro what?

1981
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:22,870
That's okay, it's just a scratch.

1982
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:24,730
The new kid's dead!

1983
01:48:26,030 --> 01:48:26,590

rules actually i kind of do yeah yeah it's okay i'm just

1986
01:48:53,070 --> 01:49:00,450

a mysterious gooey stuff and then use We wrote the Book of

1987
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:00,670
Laws.

1988
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,560
This isn't fair, butters.

1989
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,640
You have to figure something out so I can beat Stan.

1990
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:10,720
Well, if there is an official anything you can do, I can do
two claws in the rulebook.

1991
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,560
So technically, we wrote the Book of Laws.

1992
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:15,200
Oh, good.

1993
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:16,260
Do that, new kid.

1994
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:17,460
Finish the quest.

1995
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:18,380
Get powered up.

1996
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:19,540
And stop embarrassing me.

1997
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:21,960
I cast the spell.

1998
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:23,000
Your health is back to 100.

1999
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:23,640
Get the fuck off.

2000
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:25,100
God, I have to do everything around here.

2001
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,100
I did it.

2002
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,860
My HP is 100 again.

2003
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:30,260
Yay!

2004
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:32,600
Dun, dun, dun.

2005
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:33,800
Don't scare the new fellas.

2006
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:34,600
Be nice to them.

2007
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:36,460
Stay off the streets.

2008
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:37,900
Oh, I guess, like, I have to go here.

2009
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:41,840
We're gonna go this way.

2010
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,840
What the fuck?

2011
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,300
Remember that Stan has that bullshit axe now.

2012
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,620
Touch the ground and you die.

2013
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,160
It's like lava.

2014
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:48,440
Oh.

2015
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:51,600
Oh, he can use his axe to, like, kill me.

2016
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:52,480
Really?

2017
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,200
What happens if I...

2018
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,060
Oh, yeah.

2019
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:57,640
Do I get dysentery again?

2020
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:06,580
It's okay, he only did 99% damage.

2021
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:09,540
Okay, we need to get these guys.

2022
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:12,020
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2023
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,960
Oh, am I stuck?

2024
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:18,800
Am I stuck here?

2025
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:19,560
Okay, there you go.

2026
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:20,460
It's alright.

2027
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:22,080
I can just stay down here.

2028
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:23,940
Oh, I got some stuff here, too.

2029
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:25,700
Stay off the streets.

2030
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,260
Can I just bone rush this?

2031
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,620
I don't level up or anything.

2032
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,720
The best I get is like...

2033
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:35,400
I think the best I get is like, uh, toilet paper.

2034
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,960
Okay, I need to fucking...

2035
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,520
I need to fucking heal myself, though.

2036
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,220
It's alright!

2037
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:42,000

It's not okay!

2041
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,100
It was not okay.

I'll heal right underneath you.

2045
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:53,740
You can't do anything about it.

2046
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,960
Yeah, I'm okay.

2047
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,440

More toilet paper.

I need a grab.

2124
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,910
A chest open!

01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:40,070
Driving the dark matter, taking this.

2126
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:44,810
Guys, it's just to protect the catapult, okay?

2127
01:55:48,770 --> 01:55:49,950
It's a...

2128
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:52,850
It's to make balloon animals!

2129
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:55,410
Chat, it's a balloon animal!

2130
01:55:56,490 --> 01:55:59,750
It's what clowns use to make balloon animals!

2131
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,570
That's what it is!

2132
01:56:07,230 --> 01:56:10,530
That's why it's so stretchy and long.

2133
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:11,090
Whoa!

2134
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:13,950

2135
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:20,230

2136
01:56:20,230 --> 01:56:21,510

It's okay, I have my dragoons here to distract them.

2140
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:34,650
It's all right.

2141
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,330
I don't need to save them.

2142
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:38,310
They're independent.

2143
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:40,530
They're strong independent goons.

2144
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:42,390
Here we go.

2145
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:44,750
Where the fuck is the last rubber band?

2146
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:46,590
The last balloon animal.

2147
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:48,250
There it is.

2148
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:49,210
That should be enough to repair.

2149
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:50,470
Bullshit.

2150
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:51,990
Oh, no.

2151
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:55,050
Oh, it's just noodle arms.

2152
01:56:55,190 --> 01:56:55,610
That's fine.

2153
01:56:55,730 --> 01:56:56,670
A bullshit card was played.

2154
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:58,050
Your weapons are all floppy now.

2155
01:56:59,210 --> 01:56:59,670
It's okay.

2156
01:56:59,810 --> 01:57:00,670
I can just run.

2157
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:01,870
Phew.

2158
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:04,690
I'm just gonna run.

2159
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:06,490
It's alright.

2160
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:07,450
We're fine.

2161
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:09,370
Ignore everybody!

2162
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:11,970
We have so much toilet paper!

2163
01:57:12,170 --> 01:57:13,910
We don't need the money!

2164
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:16,710
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2165
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:20,410
Oh god, the hockey player is still here.

2166
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:21,190
Oh!

2167
01:57:22,190 --> 01:57:23,450
Get off me!

2168
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:25,090
Bruh!

2169
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:28,610
Taking out their feet.

2170
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:29,790
I did it!

2171
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:31,690
Goodbye, dragons!

2172
01:57:32,150 --> 01:57:33,570
I'll always remember you.

2173
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:42,270
Don't worry, I'll remember everything you've done for me,
Dragons.

2174
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:45,550
I did not leave you.

2175
01:57:45,730 --> 01:57:46,510
I...

2176
01:57:49,450 --> 01:57:52,590
I'll always remember your heart...

2177
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:52,830
Oh!

2178
01:57:53,790 --> 01:57:54,170
Dragons!

2179
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:55,550
Come back!

2180
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:56,550
Remember me!

2181
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:57,690
Dragons!

2182
01:57:57,930 --> 01:57:58,850
Take the catapult!

2183
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:00,290
Take the catapult!

2184
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:05,370
Dragoons, take the catapult!

2185
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:06,790
Dragoons!

2186
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:09,770
Dragoons!

2187
01:58:10,730 --> 01:58:13,790
I told you I remember you, just take the catapult!

2188
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:20,550
Where are they?

2189
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:23,650
Please, I'm on my knees begging.

2190
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:26,930
Just take the catapult, Mimi!

2193
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:37,810
Oh my god!

01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:45,110
But you're not ginger, so like you're not as good as me.

2196
01:58:45,870 --> 01:58:46,790
Oh my god.

2197
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:48,430
There we go.

Never forget.

2204
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:00,270
Never forget what they do.

2205
01:59:00,290 --> 01:59:00,670

Oh, God, not the hockey players.

2217
01:59:43,110 --> 01:59:43,430
It's okay.

2218
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:45,050
They can't take high ground.

2219
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:46,310
There you go.

2220
01:59:46,890 --> 01:59:47,770
They don't know how to climb.

2221
01:59:47,970 --> 01:59:48,750
He knows how to climb.

2222
01:59:49,070 --> 01:59:49,890
He knows how to climb.

2223
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:53,370
But what if he doesn't know how to climb this platform,
though?

2224
01:59:56,990 --> 01:59:57,870
It's okay.

2225
01:59:58,290 --> 02:00:00,270
He doesn't know how to climb this platform.

2226
02:00:00,290 --> 02:00:00,790
one.

2227
02:00:03,090 --> 02:00:03,650
Here we go.

02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:05,010
That's right.

2229
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:06,250
See, I told you.

2230
02:00:06,370 --> 02:00:07,750
You can't jump down and find Jimmy.

2231
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:08,550
Jimmy?

2232
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:09,950
Where the fuck is Jimmy?

2233
02:00:10,490 --> 02:00:11,490
Jimmy's over here.

2234
02:00:12,590 --> 02:00:12,890
Jimmy!

2235
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:14,670
That's not Jimmy.

2236
02:00:15,310 --> 02:00:16,310
Oh, Jimmy's over here.

2237
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:18,150
There's also chests.

2238
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:20,370
Nice.

2239
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:21,310
More dark matter.

2240
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:22,570
Is that another chest over there?

2241
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:24,350
No, that's just a dead guy.

2242
02:00:25,110 --> 02:00:25,650
Pretend dead.

2243
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:29,090
That's just a guy being pretend dead.

2244
02:00:30,290 --> 02:00:31,330
All right, we move on.

2245
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:33,330

All right, let's see.

2248

They're all coming from behind with your dagger.

2249
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:44,420
Okay, we're going to reshuffle.

2250
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:45,380
These cards suck.

2251
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:49,720
Oh, when using Pissed Off Heal 40.

2252
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:52,980
I feel like I haven't really used the Pissed Off abilities.

2253
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,300
So...

2254
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:59,500

2562
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:40,370
Remember, these are designated OP moves that you can only
use for a limited time.

2563
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:41,270

2566
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:47,450
There's no way you'll be able to get through the test of
strength.

02:19:48,270 --> 02:19:48,910

2602
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:25,710
Like, I understand it's 3D, but it's still, it's just, it's

And then the main character...

2697
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:28,570

then they blackmailed him because they knew he was making a

2698
02:28:28,570 --> 02:28:38,190
show and so he couldn't get his nft back to wait no he paid
like triple double the price again to have his board eight

2706
02:29:02,810 --> 02:29:03,830
They don't know I'm here.

2707
02:29:04,770 --> 02:29:06,490

Alright, here we go.

2709
02:29:09,150 --> 02:29:10,990

the board ape event, that shit was crazy!

2713
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:30,190
That shit was actually fucking insane because they used like
some, like, light or whatever.

2714
02:29:32,590 --> 02:29:40,510
Okay, so board ape had, like, a fucking event and they used,
like, like, some black light or whatever to, like, make it

2715
02:29:40,510 --> 02:29:47,130
cool, but then they inadvertently bought, like, the most
expensive black light that was used to kill, like...

2716
02:29:49,030 --> 02:29:50,110
Radiation or whatever.

2717
02:29:50,250 --> 02:29:50,970
They use UV lights.

2718
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:52,730
UV lights and stuff.

2719
02:29:54,510 --> 02:30:01,330
No, wasn't it, like, expensive UV lights that ended up
being, like, oh, they cheaped out on UV lights?

lights that ended up, like, fucking, causing blindness.

2722
02:30:16,150 --> 02:30:17,890

02:36:53,050 --> 02:36:54,490
Apparently there was a ledge.

02:36:57,650 --> 02:36:59,330

I'm not that stupid.

2810
02:37:17,850 --> 02:37:18,690
There's a ledge.

2811
02:37:20,650 --> 02:37:22,710
Okay, there's a ledge right here.

2812
02:37:23,710 --> 02:37:24,930
We can climb this ledge.

2813
02:37:24,990 --> 02:37:26,970
Maybe you'll learn something from the more experienced new
kids.

2814
02:37:28,530 --> 02:37:30,450
Where, what is that supposed to mean?

What do I do?

2822
02:37:54,490 --> 02:37:56,330

And then we're gonna press this.

2869
02:40:57,190 --> 02:40:59,910
And then catapult us above.

2870
02:41:00,990 --> 02:41:02,590
And then...

2871
02:41:02,590 --> 02:41:03,030
Thank Christ.

2872
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:04,290
Oh god, thank god.

2873
02:41:04,630 --> 02:41:06,430
Is it that time for me too?

2874
02:41:06,910 --> 02:41:07,170
Alright.

2875
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:08,110
Burn.

2876
02:41:08,490 --> 02:41:09,210
Burn children.

2877
02:41:09,610 --> 02:41:09,650
Burn.

2878
02:41:10,010 --> 02:41:10,650
A pretend burn.

2879
02:41:11,150 --> 02:41:11,830
Oh no, sixth graders.

2880
02:41:12,350 --> 02:41:12,930
Sixth graders!

2881
02:41:14,210 --> 02:41:14,510
Oh!

2882
02:41:15,930 --> 02:41:17,170
Oh my god.

2883
02:41:18,270 --> 02:41:29,170
the reason why like all these cartoon shows they never like
get they never get like like they never age up or go to a

2884
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:37,550
next grade is because they want to always have continuity so
that people can what's the word when syndication oh yeah

2885
02:41:37,550 --> 02:41:44,210
yeah so they can always run reruns all the time that's the
only reason why people never grow up it's actually the test

2886
02:41:44,210 --> 02:41:48,890
has been completed You've done well head to the chamber of
great is actually fucked up

2887
02:41:52,870 --> 02:41:56,470
The network just wants to be able to run reruns all the
time.

2888
02:41:56,530 --> 02:42:02,330
It's also why like a lot of characters don't go through
character development Because if they go through character

2889
02:42:02,330 --> 02:42:04,670
development running reruns don't make sense

2890
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:11,550
And I watched it

2891
02:42:15,110 --> 02:42:17,210
And I watched it happen.

2892
02:42:20,190 --> 02:42:21,490
Alright, let's see.

2893
02:42:22,090 --> 02:42:23,110
Common, uncommon.

2894
02:42:23,330 --> 02:42:23,890
I'm gonna reshuffle.

2895
02:42:26,210 --> 02:42:27,290
I'm gonna reshuffle.

2896
02:42:27,390 --> 02:42:29,130
I need something that has to do with the wand.

2897
02:42:29,750 --> 02:42:30,830
I don't like the dagger.

2898
02:42:31,530 --> 02:42:32,170
Or the bubble.

2899
02:42:32,310 --> 02:42:33,730
Oh, the bubble is so good.

2900
02:42:34,030 --> 02:42:34,230
Yeah.

2901
02:42:34,350 --> 02:42:35,490
I've had my eye on that one myself.

2902
02:42:35,790 --> 02:42:36,810
Yeah, this one's really good.

2903
02:42:37,370 --> 02:42:37,690
See you.

2904
02:42:38,650 --> 02:42:40,330
Did you know dragons don't eat paladins?

2905
02:42:40,810 --> 02:42:41,870
Apparently they taste lawful.

2906
02:42:42,170 --> 02:42:42,310
Ha!

2907
02:42:43,350 --> 02:42:44,730
Okay, that one was good, Jimmy.

2908
02:42:47,830 --> 02:42:50,150
Will ever have more than one friend?

2909
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:58,190
Okay, we gotta go downstairs.

2910
02:43:01,530 --> 02:43:02,930
Become an honorary marsh.

2911
02:43:04,150 --> 02:43:06,270
Wait, I became an honorary marshwalker?

2912
02:43:07,790 --> 02:43:09,190
Oh, it's this way.

2913
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:11,150
There we go.

2914
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:12,030
Stan's at the playground.

2915
02:43:12,390 --> 02:43:13,510
Let's take a shortcut through the theater.

2916
02:43:15,690 --> 02:43:16,490
Just run!

2917
02:43:16,830 --> 02:43:17,270
Oh, I'm stuck.

2918
02:43:18,590 --> 02:43:19,390
Just run!

2919
02:43:19,910 --> 02:43:21,130
Go, my faithful warrior!

2920
02:43:21,230 --> 02:43:21,990
Speed run!

2921
02:43:24,310 --> 02:43:25,810
We don't need toilet paper!

2922
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:27,850
Just go, go, go, go!

2923
02:43:30,930 --> 02:43:31,490
Just run.

2924
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:33,310
Okay, we need to heal though.

2925
02:43:33,490 --> 02:43:35,170
We can stay here and heal a little bit.

2926
02:43:35,290 --> 02:43:35,810
That's okay.

2927
02:43:37,110 --> 02:43:38,870
Wait, if you just run, Mr. Man!

2928
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:41,930
Just one of us has to get there!

2929
02:43:42,870 --> 02:43:43,210
Oh, God.

2930
02:43:43,350 --> 02:43:43,950
Okay, never mind.

2931
02:43:44,030 --> 02:43:45,050
I have to get back.

2932
02:43:45,070 --> 02:43:45,630

2933
02:43:45,950 --> 02:43:46,710

02:43:47,270 --> 02:43:47,790
Alright.

2935
02:43:48,490 --> 02:43:48,830
No!

2936
02:43:48,950 --> 02:43:49,590
The key!

2937
02:43:50,490 --> 02:43:52,630
Not the level 3 elf's lock!

2938
02:43:53,810 --> 02:43:54,330
Okay.

2939
02:43:54,770 --> 02:43:55,710
Let's get rid of.

2940
02:43:56,230 --> 02:43:57,950
Let's get rid of the fireworks, people.

2941
02:43:58,570 --> 02:44:00,550
This is how war is our one.

2942
02:44:01,970 --> 02:44:02,490
Alright.

2943
02:44:02,490 --> 02:44:03,010
Nice.

2944
02:44:03,610 --> 02:44:04,270
That's right.

2945
02:44:04,330 --> 02:44:05,590
Get into my bubba.

2946
02:44:06,730 --> 02:44:07,250
Oh, yeah?

2947
02:44:08,890 --> 02:44:10,230
We got supersized.

2948
02:44:10,390 --> 02:44:11,070
Kid Cannon.

2949
02:44:11,190 --> 02:44:13,090
So now we get to throw our angriest little kids at you.

2950
02:44:13,290 --> 02:44:14,150
Somehow it's still legal.

2951
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:18,570
It's legal if it's all the kids.

2952
02:44:18,710 --> 02:44:21,450
Okay, it's legal if only the kids are doing it, okay?

2953
02:44:22,930 --> 02:44:24,370
That's why it's legal.

2954
02:44:26,850 --> 02:44:27,850
Oh, God.

2955
02:44:27,930 --> 02:44:29,950
I need to get the bubble and then heals, too.

2956
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:32,890
The bubbles and heals are so good.

2957
02:44:33,850 --> 02:44:34,790
They're so strong.

2958
02:44:36,330 --> 02:44:36,750
All right.

2959
02:44:37,310 --> 02:44:38,370
Get over here.

2960
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:41,610
I need to do the level three Elven lock.

2961
02:44:42,450 --> 02:44:44,030
Oh, where am I?

2962
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:44,970
Okay.

2963
02:44:45,070 --> 02:44:45,690
Bubble time.

2964
02:44:47,410 --> 02:44:49,030
There's still, like, two more kids left.

2965
02:44:49,150 --> 02:44:50,430
I thought it would feel different.

2966
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:51,270
Alright.

2967
02:44:51,490 --> 02:44:52,170
Oh, my God.

2968
02:44:52,310 --> 02:44:54,030
He has unlimited kids!

2969
02:44:56,110 --> 02:44:58,810
When you get rid of the fireworks, they have too many kids.

2970
02:45:00,970 --> 02:45:01,910
Alright, nice.

2971
02:45:02,410 --> 02:45:03,290
Last child.

2972
02:45:05,050 --> 02:45:06,090
Fun and fodder.

2973
02:45:06,370 --> 02:45:07,190
Let's go.

2974
02:45:08,090 --> 02:45:08,330
Alright.

2975
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:09,070
Alright.

2976
02:45:09,090 --> 02:45:09,590
Almost there, new kid.

2977
02:45:09,890 --> 02:45:11,310
We're so close to kicking Stan's ass.

2978
02:45:12,090 --> 02:45:12,570
That...

2979
02:45:12,570 --> 02:45:13,670
No, that's not toilet paper.

2980
02:45:14,070 --> 02:45:15,050
Oh, any cheese.

2981
02:45:15,070 --> 02:45:17,410
What the fuck is this?

2982
02:45:18,950 --> 02:45:19,710
What trailer is this?

2983
02:45:19,810 --> 02:45:20,830
This is an Easter egg?

2984
02:45:21,170 --> 02:45:24,430
The greatest Canadian duo of all time is back.

2985
02:45:24,910 --> 02:45:25,450
Oh my god.

2986
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:30,900
I'm watching it backwards.

2987
02:45:33,080 --> 02:45:34,140
This is Philip.

2988
02:45:35,100 --> 02:45:38,520
Will you away.

2989
02:45:41,620 --> 02:45:43,620

2990
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:44,960
Uh, fast!

2991
02:45:47,300 --> 02:46:04,380
Oh, I could have watched it in the back I didn't realize no
I could have watched it here No my movie I didn't understand

2992
02:46:08,530 --> 02:46:15,630
Oh my god, you're ruining my movie experience Okay

2993
02:46:18,670 --> 02:46:20,410
It moved way too fast.

2994
02:46:21,470 --> 02:46:22,510
Alright, nice.

2995
02:46:23,150 --> 02:46:26,090
I barely can see who's in front of me.

2996
02:46:26,310 --> 02:46:29,470
With how many people are dying.

2997
02:46:32,910 --> 02:46:34,690
Ah, there's a fire!

2998
02:46:35,330 --> 02:46:35,670

2999
02:46:36,410 --> 02:46:37,630
I knew it.

3000
02:46:37,970 --> 02:46:39,530
I knew that was what's coming out.

3001
02:46:42,310 --> 02:46:44,510
We all know Candace not real.

3002
02:46:47,310 --> 02:46:48,490
Because I'm not real.

02:47:51,290 --> 02:47:51,690
That's fine.

3010
02:47:51,930 --> 02:47:53,010
I just don't have to move.

3011
02:47:53,130 --> 02:47:53,870
I just right click.

3012
02:47:56,830 --> 02:47:58,870
Easiest game of my life.

02:48:01,070 --> 02:48:02,330
Right click to win.

3014
02:48:03,250 --> 02:48:05,050
Right your way to the rest of downtown.

3015
02:48:06,030 --> 02:48:06,230
All right.

3016
02:48:06,310 --> 02:48:07,250
We just gotta run.

3017
02:48:07,930 --> 02:48:08,710
Don't look back.

3018
02:48:09,130 --> 02:48:10,050
Don't look back.

3019
02:48:10,390 --> 02:48:11,270
Fake new kid.

3020
02:48:11,790 --> 02:48:12,610
Just keep running.

3021
02:48:13,050 --> 02:48:13,670
We're gonna need to pass through the ice to get to Stan.

3022
02:48:13,830 --> 02:48:14,610
Find a cannon bob.

3023
02:48:15,030 --> 02:48:15,810
Careful fellas.

3024
02:48:16,090 --> 02:48:17,430
Stan's got cannons too.

3025
02:48:18,670 --> 02:48:19,370
The cannonball!

3026
02:48:19,670 --> 02:48:21,070
Wait, where is the cannonball?

3027
02:48:22,270 --> 02:48:23,550
Dude, your weapons can't break this!

3028
02:48:23,770 --> 02:48:24,550
Use the cannons!

3029
02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:25,230
Where the fuck?

3030
02:48:26,330 --> 02:48:27,670
Where the fuck is the cannonball?

3031
02:48:28,170 --> 02:48:29,110
Oh, it's over here!

3032
02:48:29,190 --> 02:48:29,710
I found one!

3033
02:48:30,570 --> 02:48:31,170
I got one!

3034
02:48:32,790 --> 02:48:33,590
Break it!

3035
02:48:34,190 --> 02:48:35,150
Whoa, nice shot!

3036
02:48:35,330 --> 02:48:36,490
Just a few more and you're in!

3037
02:48:37,270 --> 02:48:39,090
One more hit and that barrier is going down!

3038
02:48:39,190 --> 02:48:40,130
Okay, we need one more.

3039
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:42,330
Fake new kid!

3040
02:48:42,570 --> 02:48:43,950
Not the main character new kid!

3041
02:48:44,030 --> 02:48:45,130
Where's the other cannonball?

3042
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:48,430
Wait, where is the other cannonball?

3043
02:48:48,670 --> 02:48:49,470
Oh, it's on me.

3044
02:48:49,970 --> 02:48:50,650
See, I got it.

3045
02:48:51,190 --> 02:48:53,230
I got it, but I can't jump because it's realism.

3046
02:48:54,250 --> 02:48:57,310
Because when you're a child, you can't jump and you have a
cannonball because it's not safe.

3047
02:48:58,510 --> 02:49:01,150
Oh, wait, here you got the other one.

3048
02:49:02,910 --> 02:49:03,270

3049
02:49:04,190 --> 02:49:04,730

02:49:11,810 --> 02:49:12,170
Yes.

3054
02:49:12,390 --> 02:49:13,370
Do I have enough upgrade?

3055
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:13,970
I do.

3056
02:49:14,330 --> 02:49:14,590
Okay.

3057
02:49:14,990 --> 02:49:16,210
This is the OP one.

3058
02:49:16,770 --> 02:49:17,190
Ah, yes.

3059
02:49:17,290 --> 02:49:17,950

3069
02:50:36,530 --> 02:50:38,330
Jumping into the deep snow to put out those slings, buddy.

3070
02:50:38,530 --> 02:50:39,170
It's okay.

3071
02:50:39,530 --> 02:50:41,530
But how do I get the cannonball up top?

3072
02:50:42,810 --> 02:50:43,330
Oh, there is.

3073
02:50:43,370 --> 02:50:43,910
There's a wrap.

3074
02:50:44,330 --> 02:50:46,130
The only way to get out of your defenses is with the cannon.

3075
02:50:46,410 --> 02:50:47,350
Look around for some cannonballs.

3076
02:50:47,830 --> 02:50:49,290
But how do I put it in?

3077
02:50:49,830 --> 02:50:50,890
Yeah, let him fucking have it.

3078
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:51,690
How did you...

3079
02:50:51,690 --> 02:50:52,750
You might have completed the test of strength.

3080
02:50:52,910 --> 02:50:54,310
How did you get up there?

3081
02:50:57,510 --> 02:50:59,570
How does Mr. Men do it?

3082
02:51:01,610 --> 02:51:02,330
Number two!

3083
02:51:03,190 --> 02:51:05,450
I have a catapult right here!

3084
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:07,190

3086
02:51:10,450 --> 02:51:11,250
I'm gonna watch you.

3087
02:51:11,690 --> 02:51:12,770
How did you get up?

3088
02:51:13,330 --> 02:51:14,830
How did you do it?

3089
02:51:15,650 --> 02:51:17,010
You're no match for me, new kid.

3090
02:51:17,050 --> 02:51:18,430
Oh, there's a wrap!

3091
02:51:19,430 --> 02:51:20,510
There's a wrap!

3092
02:51:21,650 --> 02:51:23,490
I figured it out, guys.

3093
02:51:23,690 --> 02:51:24,610
There was a wrap.

3094
02:51:28,150 --> 02:51:29,570
Guys, we did it.

3095
02:51:30,850 --> 02:51:31,870
God, we're so smart.

3096
02:51:32,590 --> 02:51:34,590
We're so fucking smart.

3097
02:51:35,350 --> 02:51:37,650
Who would have thought there was a ramp all along?

3098
02:51:38,730 --> 02:51:40,230
It was right here

3099
02:51:43,370 --> 02:51:51,070
I was a little bit directionally challenged Get over here,
Stan.

3100
02:51:51,990 --> 02:51:52,810
I completed the quest.

3101
02:51:53,450 --> 02:51:58,470
I used the dark matter, but you're not new Maybe I wasn't
using enough.

3102
02:51:59,570 --> 02:52:06,970
Oh God, no Oh, no, please get that thing away from me.

Get that thing away.

3105
02:52:11,410 --> 02:52:12,850
No, get away from me!

3106
02:52:13,190 --> 02:52:14,370
You can't hide from my axe.

3107
02:52:14,650 --> 02:52:15,230
Oh, God.

3108
02:52:15,430 --> 02:52:15,790
It's okay.

3109
02:52:17,290 --> 02:52:19,910
There's so much fire going on.

3110
02:52:20,850 --> 02:52:22,130
Oh, God, to be angry.

3111

02:52:50,030 --> 02:52:57,170
Oh Everyone's going crazy fighting each other for toilet
paper, but I've been finding these treasure chests filled

3120
02:52:57,170 --> 02:53:02,470
with it all over the place People are just leaving them in
hidden but easily findable locations Can you believe that?

3121
02:53:03,090 --> 02:53:09,090
I also beat up stotch and took his toilet paper, too, but
we're gonna be rich dad Dad not now.

3122
02:53:09,190 --> 02:53:11,050
I have to defeat my enemies enemies.

3123
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:14,410
Well, wait So if you lose do they get to take our toilet
paper?

3124
02:53:14,890 --> 02:53:17,130
I guess yeah, those are the rules.

3125
02:53:17,570 --> 02:53:19,710
Oh shit No, they can't have our toilet paper.

3126
02:53:20,010 --> 02:53:24,430
Wait, but he's an adult Join in the middle of a class 10
base siege.

3127
02:53:24,850 --> 02:53:27,630
Well, uh, you know what sure what what?

3128
02:53:29,150 --> 02:53:29,590
Right.

3129
02:53:29,830 --> 02:53:30,550
I'm cutting you down.

3130
02:53:30,670 --> 02:53:31,030
Oh my god.

3131
02:53:31,410 --> 02:53:32,070

I just- Oh!

3134
02:53:37,350 --> 02:53:38,590
Where am I?

3135
02:53:39,230 --> 02:53:42,790
I turned into a PNG because of Randy!

3136
02:53:47,530 --> 02:53:51,350
I turned into a PNG because of Randy.

3137
02:53:51,870 --> 02:53:53,070
Like, what the fuck?

3138
02:53:57,410 --> 02:53:59,670
That's fucked up, man.

3139
02:54:00,110 --> 02:54:01,630
Randy, that's fucked up.

3140
02:54:07,350 --> 02:54:09,750
Okay Okay, how did he die?

3141
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:18,740
He almost had you.

3142
02:54:19,260 --> 02:54:23,560
Oh my god Bro Where the fuck?

3143
02:54:23,860 --> 02:54:24,940
Okay, he's one hit guys.

3144
02:54:25,060 --> 02:54:25,920
Let me kill still.

3145
02:54:26,220 --> 02:54:26,800
Let me kill.

3146
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:28,020
Yeah, I killed my son.

3147
02:54:28,180 --> 02:54:35,600
He's a warrior Dad Please do whatever you want to stand
don't hurt the toilet paper.

3148
02:54:35,680 --> 02:54:45,840
I was gonna be rich ha ha ha ha i can't believe i can't
pause in an online game thank you guys for not letting me

3149
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:56,760
die guys i can't believe it i can't i still managed to pause
an online game let's go

3150
02:54:59,960 --> 02:55:06,620
look at us go we're so good no problem

3151
02:55:10,460 --> 02:55:13,660
I play a game at Honorary's Marsh Walker.

3152
02:55:16,460 --> 02:55:17,180
Let's go.

3153
02:55:17,440 --> 02:55:21,120
Pause the internet.

3154
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:22,080
Pause!

3155
02:55:31,490 --> 02:55:33,750
Why couldn't you just play by the same rules as everyone
else?

3156
02:55:34,070 --> 02:55:35,990
Because my version of the rules actually work.

3157
02:55:36,470 --> 02:55:38,470
The way you guys do it, it doesn't even make any sense.

3158
02:55:38,830 --> 02:55:40,530
You don't even know what power-ups go with what abilities.

3159
02:55:40,910 --> 02:55:42,990
And that's why you turned into a total dick?

3160
02:55:43,310 --> 02:55:45,550
Oh, I'm a dick because I stood up for what I believe in.

3161
02:55:46,290 --> 02:55:47,530
Shouldn't be awarded every level.

3162
02:55:47,630 --> 02:55:48,230
It's confusing.

3163
02:55:48,570 --> 02:55:49,410
Well, we beat you, Stan.

3164
02:55:49,430 --> 02:55:49,770
Wait, what?

3165
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:51,350
But that makes sense.

3166
02:55:52,270 --> 02:55:55,710
Yeah, so can you please stop this witcher spell before more
people get hurt?

3167
02:55:56,090 --> 02:55:56,890
What are you talking about?

3168
02:55:56,930 --> 02:55:57,810
Yeah, what are you talking about?

3169
02:55:57,930 --> 02:55:58,050
Come on, Stan.

3170
02:55:58,410 --> 02:55:59,850
We know this snowstorm isn't natural.

3171
02:56:00,110 --> 02:56:00,890
Somebody used magic.

3172
02:56:01,290 --> 02:56:05,010
Do you really think I would purposely start a storm that's
killing people and shutting down the whole town?

3173
02:56:05,350 --> 02:56:06,690
The way you've been acting lately, yes.

3174
02:56:07,150 --> 02:56:09,130
Why did you turn against everybody and get all aggro?

3175
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:10,490
I don't know, okay?

3176
02:56:11,270 --> 02:56:12,830
He's going through things.

3177
02:56:13,370 --> 02:56:16,210
I guess ever since I got that dark matter stuff from...

3178
02:56:16,290 --> 02:56:17,770
Yes, Mr. Hanky!

3179
02:56:18,230 --> 02:56:19,030
What did you say?

3180
02:56:19,470 --> 02:56:21,210
I got this dark matter stuff from my axe.

3181
02:56:21,330 --> 02:56:22,590
Mr. Hanky!

3182
02:56:22,910 --> 02:56:24,010
From Mr. Hanky?

3183
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:25,210
The Christmas Pooh?

3184
02:56:25,830 --> 02:56:27,150
He's the secret villain!

3185
02:56:28,070 --> 02:56:28,730
That could be it.

3186
02:56:29,050 --> 02:56:29,730
What could it be?

3187
02:56:30,090 --> 02:56:30,850
Don't you guys remember?

3188
02:56:31,350 --> 02:56:32,870
Mr. Hanky was kicked out of town.

3189
02:56:33,290 --> 02:56:34,070
By the entire town.

3190
02:56:34,090 --> 02:56:36,150
Yeah, that's why I was like surprised Mr. Hanky's back.

3191
02:56:36,270 --> 02:56:37,250
He got phased out.

3192
02:56:39,310 --> 02:56:40,350
Oh, come on!

3193
02:56:40,430 --> 02:56:40,850
It wasn't you!

3194
02:56:41,270 --> 02:56:41,610
No!

3195
02:56:42,990 --> 02:56:43,390
No!

3196
02:56:44,430 --> 02:56:44,530
No!

3197
02:56:44,990 --> 02:56:45,390
No!

3198
02:56:45,390 --> 02:56:45,650
Oh, no!

3199
02:56:45,650 --> 02:56:46,890
about that episode.

3200
02:56:47,750 --> 02:56:53,670
If anyone would want to hurt this town, how could you accept
dark gifts from Mr. Hanky and not tell anyone, Stan?

3201
02:56:53,730 --> 02:56:56,370
And this is why I'm scared of playing a second game on
YouTube.

3202
02:56:59,230 --> 02:57:00,910
I remember that episode.

3203
02:57:01,070 --> 02:57:02,890
I guess we have to find Mr. Hanky and put a stop to him.

3204
02:57:03,190 --> 02:57:05,650
By Zaron's balls, we'll find him and destroy his dark
powers.

3205
02:57:06,170 --> 02:57:07,790
And then we can stop this horrible winter storm.

3206
02:57:08,210 --> 02:57:09,930
And then all the stores can finally open again.

3207
02:57:10,390 --> 02:57:10,630
Yeah.

3208
02:57:10,970 --> 02:57:13,450
And people stop fighting over toilet paper and get back to
work.

3209
02:57:13,830 --> 02:57:14,130
Right.

3210
02:57:14,530 --> 02:57:14,890
Yeah.

3211
02:57:15,050 --> 02:57:25,410
And we can get back to going to school what right we can all
get back to no no karmic's gonna be the other secret villain

3212
02:57:25,410 --> 02:57:37,330

would you like some hot cocoa?

3215
02:57:48,150 --> 02:57:48,870
Uh, sure.

3216
02:57:49,070 --> 02:57:51,950
I guess I can have a little hot cocoa before the world ends.

3217
02:57:52,230 --> 02:57:52,990
It's pretty cold.

3218
02:57:53,210 --> 02:57:54,450
I'll take some hot cocoa.

3219
02:57:54,650 --> 02:57:55,370
I'll have some too.

3220
02:57:55,570 --> 02:57:56,350
Does it have dark matter?

3221
02:57:57,110 --> 02:57:58,990
Oh, it has dark matter!

3222
02:57:59,550 --> 02:58:00,910
We're gonna fight adults?

3223
02:58:01,590 --> 02:58:03,310
It's not pretend anymore.

3224
02:58:03,870 --> 02:58:06,410
And you'll never have to, Eric.

3225
02:58:07,290 --> 02:58:07,730
Sweet.

3226
02:58:09,910 --> 02:58:10,070
No.

3227
02:58:10,070 --> 02:58:12,290
I sense great dark matter within you.

3228
02:58:12,570 --> 02:58:14,150
That's not dark matter.

3229
02:58:15,650 --> 02:58:17,790
Oh my god.

3230
02:58:21,690 --> 02:58:25,130
Guys, I think this is a medical concern now.

3231
02:58:25,350 --> 02:58:25,910
I think.

3232
02:58:26,650 --> 02:58:28,530
Oh no.

3233
02:58:29,450 --> 02:58:29,610
Oh no.

3234
02:58:29,770 --> 02:58:32,210
It's probably buried in like 50 feet of snow.

3235
02:58:33,730 --> 02:58:34,230
Guys.

3236
02:58:34,890 --> 02:58:35,310
Guys.

3237
02:58:36,130 --> 02:58:38,430
I think this is a medical concern now.

3238
02:58:39,550 --> 02:58:40,030
I don't think.

3239
02:58:40,370 --> 02:58:41,850
I don't think.

3240
02:58:42,130 --> 02:58:43,230
Oh no.

3241
02:58:43,810 --> 02:58:45,630
Constructed mechanical monstrosity.

3242
02:58:45,650 --> 02:58:47,470
see that fire snowballs for you.

3243
02:58:47,490 --> 02:58:50,930
I still feel the shield is really good compared to...

3244
02:58:51,490 --> 02:58:54,110
I feel like I'm still going to run shield and heals.

3245
02:58:54,530 --> 02:58:55,110
What's this?

3246
02:58:55,550 --> 02:58:56,510
Oh, that's it!

3247
02:58:56,930 --> 02:58:58,170
I get dizzy swinging that thing.

3248
02:58:59,050 --> 02:59:00,550
Okay, that's the level 10.

3249
02:59:02,750 --> 02:59:04,370
That's the level 10 battle axe.

3250
02:59:06,810 --> 02:59:07,150
Okay.

3251
02:59:07,750 --> 02:59:08,410
And then...

3252
02:59:10,910 --> 02:59:12,030
And then...

3253
02:59:12,030 --> 02:59:14,850
Alright, and then press while jumping to... Whoa!

3254
02:59:15,690 --> 02:59:17,030
That's fucking crazy.

3255
02:59:18,270 --> 02:59:19,550
Alright, dark matter time.

3256
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:21,330
Let's see.

3257
02:59:21,430 --> 02:59:23,030
You deal 20% damage?

3258
02:59:23,270 --> 02:59:23,970
Fuck yeah.

3259
02:59:25,230 --> 02:59:28,090
Oh, I do not have a lot.

3260
02:59:28,510 --> 02:59:29,350
Ice skater.

3261
02:59:30,090 --> 02:59:30,350
Oh.

3262
02:59:30,930 --> 02:59:31,430
Alright.

3263
02:59:31,490 --> 02:59:36,070
I don't know about that.

3264
02:59:36,190 --> 02:59:36,590
I don't know.

3265
02:59:36,590 --> 02:59:38,650
I'm worried about this dark matter thing now.

3266
02:59:39,290 --> 02:59:40,810
Not this dark matter.

3267
02:59:44,270 --> 02:59:45,370
Alright, let's see.

Thank you.

3274
03:00:24,740 --> 03:00:27,940
TLDR, if you're pooping dark matter, please see a doctor.

3275
03:00:29,060 --> 03:00:35,160
If your poop starts talking back to you, there might be
something wrong with your brain.

3276
03:00:37,160 --> 03:00:38,420
Huh, no one's here.

3277
03:00:38,840 --> 03:00:39,940
Oh, well, choose your cards.

3278
03:00:40,140 --> 03:00:42,280
We'll need all the bullshit we can to defeat Mr. Hanky.

3279
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:45,500
Wait, does that mean Mr. Hanky doesn't get bullshit?

3280
03:00:46,300 --> 03:00:47,000
Oh, God.

3281
03:00:47,240 --> 03:00:48,960
Fucking flashbang out of nowhere.

03:00:49,180 --> 03:00:49,900

The plot twist!

You're gonna have to go through me!

3289
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:28,480
God damn it, Carmen, what are you doing?

3290
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:31,440
I'm finally gonna live the life I've always dreamt of, Cam?

3291
03:01:31,920 --> 03:01:33,700
A life with no skin.

3292
03:01:34,380 --> 03:01:35,980
Mr. Henke is ruining South Park.

3293
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:37,320
We can't keep living like this.

3294
03:01:37,620 --> 03:01:39,860
Don't worry, you won't be living much longer anyways.

3295
03:01:40,420 --> 03:01:45,040
Mr. Henke has given me the power of dark magic, and I'm
gonna use it to destroy you guys!

3296
03:01:45,480 --> 03:01:47,380
Wait, but then that means he gets like...

3297
03:01:47,380 --> 03:01:48,260
I'm totally betraying you now.

3298
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:50,200
Fifteen cards!

3299
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:52,800
He can do the spells.

3300
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:54,560
He can do the bad spells.

3301
03:01:56,880 --> 03:01:57,660
What a twist.

3302
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:05,880
Wait, but like who the fuck is in his army?

3303
03:02:06,080 --> 03:02:07,120
With me and my dark army in control.

3304
03:02:07,320 --> 03:02:08,500
We never have to go to school again.

3305
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:09,960
You should be thanking me.

3306
03:02:10,600 --> 03:02:11,880
I fucking knew Karma was onto something.

3307
03:02:12,100 --> 03:02:13,000
We have to stop him.

3308
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:15,020
Oh my god.

3309
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:16,120
That's not fair.

3310
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:18,460
You got adults to play pretend with.

3311
03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:19,920
This is not pretend anymore.

3312
03:02:21,660 --> 03:02:23,520
The adults are going to beat up children!

3313
03:02:24,480 --> 03:02:25,500
That's a lawsuit!

3314
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:29,880
Make your way through the backyards.

3315
03:02:30,180 --> 03:02:30,640
Oh no.

3316
03:02:31,420 --> 03:02:32,200
Oh no.

3317
03:02:32,360 --> 03:02:33,900
The Venom Army.

3318
03:02:35,220 --> 03:02:35,520
Bro!

3319
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:38,000
What fucking slap from a dog?

3320
03:02:38,500 --> 03:02:38,820
What?

3321
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:41,320
Carmen's got them all hopped up on dark matter.

3322
03:02:42,820 --> 03:02:43,140
Oh god.

3323
03:02:43,300 --> 03:02:44,500
Thank god it's just a kid.

3324
03:02:46,020 --> 03:02:46,600
Guys it's okay.

3325
03:02:46,780 --> 03:02:47,520
It's just a child.

3326
03:02:50,780 --> 03:02:51,540
It's okay.

3327
03:02:51,660 --> 03:02:51,980
guys.

3328
03:02:52,840 --> 03:02:53,320
Oh, no.

3329
03:02:53,460 --> 03:02:54,580
There's no napalm.

3330
03:02:55,540 --> 03:02:58,600
This is so much more difficult without napalm now.

3331
03:03:00,260 --> 03:03:02,240
This is actually more difficult.

3332
03:03:04,260 --> 03:03:04,540
Alright.

3333
03:03:04,760 --> 03:03:05,120
We're fine.

3334
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:05,600
We're fine.

3335
03:03:06,480 --> 03:03:06,700
Okay.

3336
03:03:07,180 --> 03:03:07,880
We got it.

3337
03:03:08,400 --> 03:03:09,300
Oh, no.

3338
03:03:09,580 --> 03:03:10,540
We got it here.

3339
03:03:11,660 --> 03:03:13,680
Is it because I'm also on fire?

3340
03:03:14,020 --> 03:03:15,980
That I'm taking... No, it can't be.

3341
03:03:16,980 --> 03:03:18,620
No, that can't be it.

3342
03:03:19,540 --> 03:03:33,460
Okay, we gotta get rid of the me i got the i got the fucking

about the teammates here oh no all right heals I'm only

3346
03:04:18,020 --> 03:04:19,460
using the heals for myself.

3347
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:23,460
Alright, we're good.

3348
03:04:24,300 --> 03:04:26,700
We just have to head up.

3349
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:27,600
Get up here!

3350
03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:29,060
Get over your children!

3351

The adults are in here yet, so I have an excuse to beat you
up!

3352
03:04:34,980 --> 03:04:37,140
Alright, I hope Jimmy has the napalm.

3353
03:04:38,480 --> 03:04:40,300
That's like my only hope right now.

3354
03:04:41,480 --> 03:04:42,120
Where do I go?

3355
03:04:42,340 --> 03:04:43,440
Did I kill everybody yet?

3356
03:04:43,740 --> 03:04:44,740
No, they're over there.

3357
03:04:46,680 --> 03:04:47,160
Alright.

3358
03:04:50,040 --> 03:04:58,300
healers this is a trick i just if i start healing next to it
i don't take five technically my heals negate the fire

3359
03:04:58,300 --> 03:05:14,240
damage that i took like look at this damage i'm doing it's
so sad it's actually so sad children please please this dark

3360
03:05:14,240 --> 03:05:19,160
banner it's not healthy Did we defeat everybody?

3361
03:05:20,800 --> 03:05:21,520
Is that everybody?

3362
03:05:22,900 --> 03:05:25,940
Oh my god, he's all the way over there!

3363
03:05:26,580 --> 03:05:29,200
Guys, my very real dragoons.

3364
03:05:30,340 --> 03:05:31,040
Okay, that's it.

3365
03:05:31,480 --> 03:05:32,020
This is it.

3366
03:05:32,900 --> 03:05:35,620
I'm gonna use my melee, my level 10 axe.

3367
03:05:36,140 --> 03:05:38,780
Wait, guys, I have a feeling.

3368
03:05:39,540 --> 03:05:40,400
Oh my god.

3369
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:43,940
Guys, I just...

3370
03:05:43,940 --> 03:05:48,000
There's a possibility that my level 10 axe is really...

3371
03:05:48,020 --> 03:05:49,460
fucking strong.

3372
03:05:54,340 --> 03:05:54,820
I don't know.

3373
03:05:55,060 --> 03:05:55,740
I don't know.

3374
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:57,200
It's just a theory.

3375
03:05:59,580 --> 03:06:05,340
It's just a theory that my axe could be really fucking
strong, but I'm not sure yet.

3376
03:06:07,160 --> 03:06:09,460
It's just a game theory, though.

3377
03:06:12,300 --> 03:06:15,140
It's just a game theory.

3378
03:06:15,760 --> 03:06:16,640
Oh, shit.

3379
03:06:17,740 --> 03:06:19,620
Oh my god, this fucking tree, though.

3380
03:06:22,120 --> 03:06:22,920
Okay.

3381
03:06:24,680 --> 03:06:25,480
Kids!

3382
03:06:30,380 --> 03:06:31,540
Protect the queen!

3383
03:06:33,540 --> 03:06:35,180
Protect the queen!

3384
03:06:36,520 --> 03:06:37,320
Okay.

3385
03:06:38,060 --> 03:06:39,420
We just gotta kill this tree.

3386
03:06:40,340 --> 03:06:41,060
Oh, no.

3387
03:06:42,180 --> 03:06:42,620
Oh, no.

3388
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:44,100
Okay, nice.

3389
03:06:45,240 --> 03:06:48,500
She bet the barrier does not fucking work against melee.

3390
03:06:50,260 --> 03:06:51,800
I'm just gonna burn it for now.

3391
03:06:53,180 --> 03:06:53,900
Oh shit.

3392
03:06:55,780 --> 03:06:58,180
Alright, gotta get rid of the baby tree.

3393
03:06:59,240 --> 03:07:00,780
Baby tree, goodbye.

3394
03:07:01,780 --> 03:07:03,200
Okay, and then... Slam!

3395
03:07:04,740 --> 03:07:05,640
There you go.

3396
03:07:05,980 --> 03:07:06,280
Nice.

3397
03:07:06,620 --> 03:07:07,680
That should be everybody, right?

3398
03:07:08,380 --> 03:07:08,880
No!

3399
03:07:09,360 --> 03:07:10,160
One more!

3400
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:11,240
Slam!

3401
03:07:13,780 --> 03:07:15,420
Okay, there you go.

3402
03:07:15,660 --> 03:07:15,980
We're good.

3403
03:07:17,220 --> 03:07:18,480
Level 10 axe, baby.

3404
03:07:20,460 --> 03:07:28,380
Axe and strong goes back to fire because it's like gun It's
almost like gun.

3405
03:07:28,500 --> 03:07:40,700
I can't stop myself In here off kid come on uh Raise the
rarity of the fire elemental card 70% additional damage

03:07:41,300 --> 03:07:43,440
Fuck, okay 70% good choice.

3407
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:44,280
I need more strength.

3408
03:07:44,400 --> 03:07:48,800
I'm like I feel so weak bring us together soon I feel so
fucking weak right now.

3409
03:07:48,880 --> 03:07:51,220
We need this Where do I go?

3410
03:07:51,400 --> 03:07:51,680
This way?

3411
03:07:54,700 --> 03:07:57,500
Oh, that's why they're so fucking strong.

3412
03:07:57,840 --> 03:07:58,820
Okay, that makes sense now.

3413
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:00,120
Oh, no.

3414
03:08:00,220 --> 03:08:00,900
Oh, no.

3415
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:01,900
It's okay.

3416
03:08:03,600 --> 03:08:05,460
I was like, no wonder they hit so hard.

3417
03:08:05,620 --> 03:08:06,840
I was like, what the fuck?

3418
03:08:08,640 --> 03:08:09,460
Okay, we're good.

3419
03:08:10,680 --> 03:08:11,560
We're good now.

3420
03:08:12,280 --> 03:08:13,880
I do 70% more damage.

3421
03:08:18,640 --> 03:08:19,420
It's alright.

3422
03:08:20,260 --> 03:08:21,940
I have heals right next to me.

3423
03:08:22,440 --> 03:08:23,260
They can't aim.

3424
03:08:25,220 --> 03:08:26,400
Oh, shit!

3425
03:08:26,960 --> 03:08:27,380
It's okay.

3426
03:08:28,700 --> 03:08:30,080
I can heal again.

3427
03:08:30,740 --> 03:08:31,580
That's right.

3428
03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:33,560
Oh, okay.

3429
03:08:33,740 --> 03:08:34,200
Barrier.

3430
03:08:34,840 --> 03:08:35,680
All right, there we go.

3431
03:08:36,140 --> 03:08:37,020
I can heal again!

3432
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:38,440
That's right!

3433
03:08:38,860 --> 03:08:41,380
I'll just stand here and take everything!

3434
03:08:41,780 --> 03:08:42,380
Player one?

3435
03:08:42,880 --> 03:08:43,420
You okay now?

3436
03:08:43,780 --> 03:08:45,200
Yeah, I'm pretty all right.

3437
03:08:45,800 --> 03:08:46,740
Wait, did I defeat everybody?

3438
03:08:47,480 --> 03:08:48,140
And they're all dead.

3439
03:08:48,400 --> 03:08:48,900
Yeah, they are.

3440
03:08:49,140 --> 03:08:49,960
All right, let me just heal.

3441
03:08:51,500 --> 03:08:52,540
More fire.

3442
03:08:54,300 --> 03:08:57,400
Okay, I need to heal myself so I can keep burning people.

3443
03:09:00,620 --> 03:09:01,540
Is that upgraded?

3444
03:09:02,180 --> 03:09:03,080
80%?

3445
03:09:04,040 --> 03:09:05,980
Alright, now I'm definitely stronger than melee.

3446
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:07,900
Oh, fuck, where did you come from?

3447
03:09:08,380 --> 03:09:09,180

03:10:14,900 --> 03:10:16,560
Bro, this song is hardcore, though.

3468
03:10:16,600 --> 03:10:17,220
I'm not gonna lie.

3469
03:10:18,900 --> 03:10:20,240
This song is like...

3470
03:10:20,260 --> 03:10:23,180
It's so fucking hardcore for the situation I'm in.

3471
03:10:23,620 --> 03:10:24,420
Are you...

3472
03:10:24,420 --> 03:10:24,480
What?

3473
03:10:24,920 --> 03:10:25,280
Guys.

3474
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:26,800
Mixed reviews.

3475
03:10:31,400 --> 03:10:34,740
But I want to know how the story ends.

3476
03:10:35,160 --> 03:10:37,500
The things I do for self-park.

3477
03:10:39,440 --> 03:10:39,820
Alright.

3478
03:10:40,520 --> 03:10:42,960
I mean, it's like five chapters, you know?

3479
03:10:43,320 --> 03:10:44,700
I might as well.

3480
03:10:44,860 --> 03:10:46,140
It's five chapters.

3481
03:10:46,440 --> 03:10:48,600
We're already past the two hours mark.

3482
03:10:50,580 --> 03:10:56,060
We're already past the two hours mark, so we might as well
try to see how the story ends.

3483
03:10:56,760 --> 03:10:58,220
How do I get out of here?

3484
03:10:58,960 --> 03:10:59,520
Oh, this way.

3485
03:11:03,540 --> 03:11:04,340
Alright, nice.

3486
03:11:05,780 --> 03:11:06,240
Here we go.

3487
03:11:06,500 --> 03:11:08,380
You think you're hot shit for getting through some of my
forces?

3488
03:11:08,740 --> 03:11:09,260
Guess what?

3489
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:11,020
I got plenty more where that came from, you kids.

3490
03:11:12,660 --> 03:11:15,260
Oh my god, now I actually have to dodge.

3491
03:11:15,800 --> 03:11:16,120
No!

3492
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:19,380
There's too many children!

3493
03:11:20,740 --> 03:11:22,940
Oh, what's the bullshit this time?

3494
03:11:23,860 --> 03:11:24,660
Projectile Hellstorm.

3495
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:28,700
Whoa!

3496
03:11:29,380 --> 03:11:30,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3497
03:11:30,760 --> 03:11:32,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3498
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:32,340
It's okay.

3499
03:11:32,600 --> 03:11:34,240
We gotta kill all the bow and arrow kids.

3500
03:11:35,260 --> 03:11:36,000
It's all right.

3501
03:11:36,540 --> 03:11:37,680
I see you.

3502
03:11:38,260 --> 03:11:39,120
Ooh, it's okay.

3503
03:11:39,300 --> 03:11:39,700
Dodge.

3504
03:11:41,520 --> 03:11:42,060
Oh, wait.

3505
03:11:42,240 --> 03:11:42,460
Shield.

3506
03:11:42,780 --> 03:11:43,180
Shield.

3507
03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:44,560
Shield.

3508
03:11:45,160 --> 03:11:45,180
Oh!

3509
03:11:45,540 --> 03:11:47,220
Wait, you're not in bow and arrow.

3510
03:11:47,620 --> 03:11:48,880
You can do anything you want down there.

3511
03:11:49,100 --> 03:11:49,840
Except keep playing.

3512
03:11:49,840 --> 03:11:51,060
All right, that's okay.

3513
03:11:51,680 --> 03:11:52,180
That's okay.

3514
03:11:52,300 --> 03:11:55,740
My very real dragoons fell down so they can't res me.

3515
03:11:56,600 --> 03:11:58,820
Oh, I'm back.

3516
03:11:59,420 --> 03:12:00,020

3517
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:02,660
Oh my god.

3518
03:12:02,900 --> 03:12:03,720
All right, there you go.

3519
03:12:04,140 --> 03:12:05,200
I'm just gonna stay here.

3520
03:12:06,320 --> 03:12:06,740
It's fine.

3521
03:12:07,420 --> 03:12:08,720
I'm gonna stay here.

3522
03:12:09,580 --> 03:12:10,700
Use my hues.

3523
03:12:11,400 --> 03:12:12,660
Get a little angie.

3524
03:12:13,460 --> 03:12:14,100
There you go.

3525
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:16,760
Jesus Christ, these children.

3526
03:12:17,700 --> 03:12:24,340
These children need a fucking These children needs to get
checked to see if they're on any steroids.

Holy fuck.

3528
03:12:26,540 --> 03:12:29,080
What is this dark matter that makes them so strong?

3529
03:12:29,960 --> 03:12:31,200
I don't understand.

3530
03:12:34,680 --> 03:12:36,560
Like, what's making them so strong?

3531
03:12:37,360 --> 03:12:38,680
Dark matter should not...

03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:09,960

03:18:54,580 --> 03:18:55,240
Chapter 4.

3645
03:18:55,720 --> 03:18:57,720
There has to be...

3646
03:18:57,720 --> 03:18:58,100

Bye, Lakisha.

3652
03:19:11,380 --> 03:19:12,720
I know you're out there.

3653
03:19:13,420 --> 03:19:15,840
I can't be the only one on Chapter 4.

3654
03:19:16,600 --> 03:19:17,120
Where am I?

3655
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:18,300
Another warrior for me to defeat.

3656
03:19:18,820 --> 03:19:19,360
Hello!

3657
03:19:20,700 --> 03:19:22,240

3660
03:19:29,400 --> 03:19:31,760
Where where is this?

3661
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:38,160
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

3662
03:19:38,340 --> 03:19:39,720

3668
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:51,720

Who the fuck is doing that?

3705
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:14,700
Who is doing that?

3706
03:23:15,540 --> 03:23:17,860
I can't believe we found people.

3707
03:23:18,820 --> 03:23:19,860
Real people.

3708
03:23:20,860 --> 03:23:22,560
Oh, I got better chain lightning.

03:23:23,300 --> 03:23:25,380
Alright, I guess we should revive him.

3710
03:23:27,120 --> 03:23:27,980
Who did that?

3711
03:23:28,860 --> 03:23:30,460
Who's doing that?

3712
03:23:32,440 --> 03:23:34,460
Okay, we gotta get rid of these guys.

3713
03:23:36,200 --> 03:23:37,200
Oh, look, he's back to normal.

3714
03:23:40,700 --> 03:23:42,480
Oh my god, I'm so paranoid.

3715
03:23:43,280 --> 03:23:44,460
Who's doing that?

3716
03:23:44,800 --> 03:23:45,820
Who's doing that?

3717
03:23:46,240 --> 03:23:48,180
I'm so fucking paranoid right now.

3718
03:23:48,540 --> 03:23:49,400
Wait, what?

3719
03:23:50,780 --> 03:23:52,060
Why are the dead?

3720
03:23:52,100 --> 03:23:53,420
Why are the dead?

3721
03:23:54,740 --> 03:23:55,300
Wait.

3722
03:23:56,240 --> 03:23:57,480
The dead can do that?

3723
03:23:57,640 --> 03:23:58,040
Wait.

3724
03:24:00,160 --> 03:24:00,600
What?

3725
03:24:04,360 --> 03:24:05,180
Wait, what?

3726
03:24:06,100 --> 03:24:08,200
How come they didn't do that when I was playing?

3727
03:24:08,600 --> 03:24:10,020
Okay, I know that one was you.

3728
03:24:10,420 --> 03:24:12,020
I know that one was you number four.

3729
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:17,300
Yeah, but why didn't they do that when I was playing the
game?

3730
03:24:18,460 --> 03:24:23,480
Oh, God, please, please, please, how do you turn it off?

3731
03:24:25,140 --> 03:24:27,120
Don't even bother resisting me, you guys.

3732
03:24:27,400 --> 03:24:28,040
You're playing by magic.

3733
03:24:28,060 --> 03:24:31,800
Oh, it's one of the cards.

3734
03:24:32,300 --> 03:24:34,120
Oh, that's a card.

3735
03:24:34,760 --> 03:24:35,640
But why?

3736
03:24:36,540 --> 03:24:38,580
What does that even do as a card?

3737
03:24:41,720 --> 03:24:45,640
I can't believe somebody played far enough to know that
that's what they...

3738
03:24:45,640 --> 03:24:46,520
That's a card.

3739
03:24:47,540 --> 03:24:57,080
Like, somebody has, like, has enough knowledge of the
Snowballs, the Snow Day game to know that's a fucking card.

3740
03:24:58,060 --> 03:24:59,520
How should you guys play to know that?

3741
03:25:00,080 --> 03:25:01,080
That's a good question.

3742
03:25:02,380 --> 03:25:04,100
Makes you go faster.

3743
03:25:09,300 --> 03:25:11,900
Alright, we gotta get the chain here.

3744
03:25:13,060 --> 03:25:14,800
Bro, this host keeps dying.

3745
03:25:15,860 --> 03:25:17,200
I'm the new captain now.

3746
03:25:17,500 --> 03:25:18,300
Don't res him!

3747
03:25:18,740 --> 03:25:19,680
Don't res him!

3748
03:25:19,920 --> 03:25:21,020
Let him learn!

3749
03:25:22,460 --> 03:25:23,960
Let him learn!

3750
03:25:24,520 --> 03:25:25,140
Don't res him!

3751
03:25:25,220 --> 03:25:26,620
Let me be the new player one!

3752
03:25:28,540 --> 03:25:30,420
All right, we have to feed all of these guys.

3753
03:25:32,040 --> 03:25:33,780
How many someone was willing to play that far?

3754
03:25:34,160 --> 03:25:35,200
That's why I'm here.

3755
03:25:35,660 --> 03:25:37,980
I'm playing it this far so you guys don't have to.

3756
03:25:38,320 --> 03:25:42,820
All right, nice.

3757
03:25:42,980 --> 03:25:43,720
We killed everybody.

3758
03:25:44,860 --> 03:25:44,880
Nice.

3759
03:25:45,940 --> 03:25:46,520
We gotta go.

3760
03:25:48,320 --> 03:25:48,900
This way.

3761
03:25:49,340 --> 03:25:49,540
Jimmy!

3762
03:25:52,140 --> 03:25:53,660
Uh, Molotov cocktail.

3763
03:25:54,300 --> 03:25:55,080
Drops a Molotov.

3764
03:25:55,280 --> 03:25:56,340
Oh, is it worth it?

3765
03:25:58,400 --> 03:25:58,800
Molotov.

3766
03:26:01,020 --> 03:26:01,820
The 68...

3767
03:26:02,320 --> 03:26:03,700
Wait, no, the spin!

3768
03:26:04,140 --> 03:26:05,300
The legendary spin!

3769
03:26:05,880 --> 03:26:06,480
Try not to die.

3770
03:26:06,620 --> 03:26:07,140
That would be embarrassing.

3771
03:26:07,540 --> 03:26:08,280
Alright, we got it.

3772
03:26:08,500 --> 03:26:08,780
Let's go.

3773
03:26:08,840 --> 03:26:09,220
I'm ready.

3774
03:26:10,060 --> 03:26:10,400
I'm ready.

3775
03:26:16,720 --> 03:26:17,400
I'm gonna spin.

3776
03:26:17,880 --> 03:26:18,820
Spin to win.

3777
03:26:20,140 --> 03:26:21,660
Okay, entering Main Street.

3778
03:26:24,100 --> 03:26:26,140
Alright, this is the part where I died.

3779
03:26:27,300 --> 03:26:28,160
I just got...

3780
03:26:28,160 --> 03:26:29,360
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

3781
03:26:29,440 --> 03:26:30,080
Thank you, thank you.

3782
03:26:30,100 --> 03:26:40,900
Well, this game has mixed reviews and I sort of know why I
can't I sort of know why this game has mixed reviews It's

3783
03:26:40,900 --> 03:26:49,140
it's very obvious why wait what the fuck why didn't I why
didn't I do any damage to him?

3784
03:26:49,320 --> 03:26:50,040
Oh, there you go.

3785
03:26:50,200 --> 03:26:51,580
That was so weird.

3786
03:26:52,500 --> 03:27:02,480
I didn't do any damage just then Okay, I'm gonna heal a
little bit reviews were not wrong, that's for sure.

3787
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:06,240
Like, I know why it's mixed reviews.

3788
03:27:07,620 --> 03:27:08,500
Oh, shit.

3789
03:27:09,260 --> 03:27:09,580
Okay.

3790
03:27:11,320 --> 03:27:12,580
Don't worry, I'm spinning.

3791
03:27:13,560 --> 03:27:16,060
At least I can hold the charge up when I'm moving.

3792
03:27:16,120 --> 03:27:17,480
Just screw those guys and go home.

3793
03:27:18,120 --> 03:27:19,040
Alright, we're going.

3794
03:27:19,620 --> 03:27:20,220
Push up.

3795
03:27:20,560 --> 03:27:21,220
Push forward.

3796
03:27:21,820 --> 03:27:23,720
I need to go to the place where I die.

3797
03:27:25,400 --> 03:27:26,360
Keep pushing.

3798
03:27:27,060 --> 03:27:27,580
Oh, God.

3799
03:27:27,740 --> 03:27:30,800
There's the here.

3800
03:27:31,540 --> 03:27:32,700
Oh, it's because of the shield.

3801
03:27:33,700 --> 03:27:35,340
Oh, I understand.

3802
03:27:36,340 --> 03:27:37,060
I get it now.

3803
03:27:37,500 --> 03:27:38,120
There was a shield.

3804
03:27:38,900 --> 03:27:41,600
Oh, it must be a card or something.

3805
03:27:43,080 --> 03:27:43,460
Oh, no.

3806
03:27:43,880 --> 03:27:44,340
Oh, no.

3807
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:47,720
Oh, it's okay.

3808
03:27:47,820 --> 03:27:48,060
I'm okay.

3809
03:27:48,260 --> 03:27:48,520
I'm okay.

3810
03:27:49,160 --> 03:27:49,780
I'm okay.

3811
03:27:50,400 --> 03:27:51,180
I'm spinning.

3812
03:27:52,120 --> 03:27:52,900
I'm okay, guys.

3813
03:27:53,460 --> 03:27:55,480
I need to press an E here, though.

3814
03:27:56,480 --> 03:27:57,380
Guys, someone E.

3815
03:27:57,880 --> 03:27:58,500

3818
03:28:05,520 --> 03:28:05,720
Okay.

3819
03:28:06,580 --> 03:28:06,740
E!

3820
03:28:07,100 --> 03:28:08,260
We need all the E's!

3821
03:28:08,580 --> 03:28:10,500
Put all the heels right here in the center!

3822
03:28:11,060 --> 03:28:11,740
Double the heels!

3823
03:28:13,340 --> 03:28:14,880
We need double the heels!

3824
03:28:16,820 --> 03:28:17,780
Speed run!

3825
03:28:18,140 --> 03:28:18,880
Wait, what the fuck?

3826
03:28:19,960 --> 03:28:20,480
Alright.

3827
03:28:21,660 --> 03:28:22,460
We're okay.

3828
03:28:23,160 --> 03:28:23,860
Oh, this is good.

3829
03:28:23,940 --> 03:28:24,860
This is like...

3830
03:28:24,860 --> 03:28:25,140
No.

3831
03:28:25,440 --> 03:28:26,140
Not the bullshit.

3832
03:28:28,740 --> 03:28:29,720
Wait, what's that?

3833
03:28:31,020 --> 03:28:31,740
What's that?

3834
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:32,360
What does that do?

3835
03:28:35,020 --> 03:28:36,420
What does that do?

3836
03:28:36,720 --> 03:28:37,400
What do I have?

3837
03:28:37,760 --> 03:28:38,220
I don't know.

3838
03:28:38,320 --> 03:28:39,320
This is not my session.

3839
03:28:40,680 --> 03:28:44,160
Oh, I'm taking damage, but I don't know what I'm doing.

3840
03:28:47,400 --> 03:28:49,160
What is it?

3841
03:28:51,960 --> 03:28:55,740
I want to know what my bullshit does.

3842
03:28:56,440 --> 03:28:58,040
Oh, I can run forever.

3843
03:28:59,860 --> 03:29:01,280
I could run forever.

3844
03:29:01,580 --> 03:29:01,820
Whoa.

3845
03:29:02,280 --> 03:29:02,380
Whoa.

3846
03:29:02,700 --> 03:29:02,700
Whoa.

3847
03:29:03,040 --> 03:29:03,220
Whoa.

3848
03:29:03,360 --> 03:29:03,360
Whoa.

3849
03:29:03,920 --> 03:29:03,920
Whoa.

3850
03:29:04,840 --> 03:29:04,840
Whoa.

3851
03:29:05,900 --> 03:29:05,900
Whoa.

3852
03:29:06,280 --> 03:29:06,380
No.

3853
03:29:07,080 --> 03:29:08,460
You can do anything you want down there.

3854
03:29:08,860 --> 03:29:09,560
My first death.

3855
03:29:10,580 --> 03:29:12,920
It's just like last game.

3856
03:29:14,120 --> 03:29:14,320
Oh.

3857
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:14,600
Oh.

3858
03:29:14,780 --> 03:29:15,220
Number two.

3859
03:29:15,420 --> 03:29:15,640
Number two.

3860
03:29:15,740 --> 03:29:16,360
I'm so important.

3861
03:29:16,660 --> 03:29:17,140
Number four.

3862
03:29:17,440 --> 03:29:18,340
I'm so important.

3863
03:29:19,180 --> 03:29:20,120
You know it.

3864
03:29:20,920 --> 03:29:21,660
It's all right.

3865
03:29:22,480 --> 03:29:22,960

3881
03:30:57,260 --> 03:30:58,220
number one.

3882
03:30:59,860 --> 03:31:00,440
Wait, where do we go?

3883
03:31:00,620 --> 03:31:01,860
Survive all the waves.

3884
03:31:02,040 --> 03:31:02,820
Where are the waves?

3885
03:31:03,540 --> 03:31:04,300
Oh, there they are.

3886
03:31:05,440 --> 03:31:06,420
There are the waves.

3887
03:31:07,740 --> 03:31:08,480
Don't worry, I'm heading over.

3888
03:31:09,020 --> 03:31:09,480
Spin!

3889
03:31:11,320 --> 03:31:11,940
Don't worry.

3890
03:31:12,180 --> 03:31:14,140
The moment I keep spinning, spin!

3891
03:31:14,280 --> 03:31:17,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.

3892

3893
03:31:19,960 --> 03:31:21,680
Oh, my god!

3894
03:31:22,300 --> 03:31:24,440
This is such an OP attack.

3895
03:31:25,060 --> 03:31:26,620
This is actually so OP.

3896
03:31:27,260 --> 03:31:28,080
Holy shit.

3897
03:31:28,800 --> 03:31:31,700
I put shields and then I spin.

3898
03:31:33,860 --> 03:31:34,480
Hey.

3899
03:31:36,920 --> 03:31:37,200
Don't worry.

3900
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:38,120
Bubbles!

3901
03:31:39,800 --> 03:31:40,420
Spin!

3902
03:31:40,980 --> 03:31:41,420
Oh, shit.

3903
03:31:42,180 --> 03:31:42,420
Spin!

3904
03:31:45,940 --> 03:31:46,660
Oh, my God.

3905
03:31:46,700 --> 03:31:47,720
That's a lot of people.

3906
03:31:50,360 --> 03:31:51,540
You're getting carried.

3907
03:31:52,160 --> 03:31:53,080
You're all getting carried.

3908
03:31:53,780 --> 03:31:55,480
You're getting carried by a real gamer.

3909
03:31:55,560 --> 03:31:56,720
I played on hard difficulty.

3910
03:31:57,260 --> 03:31:58,020
This is baby.

3911
03:31:58,700 --> 03:31:59,860
This is baby level.

3912
03:32:02,940 --> 03:32:04,760
Okay, got to get the bubble dough.

3913
03:32:07,060 --> 03:32:07,080
Alright.

3914
03:32:08,460 --> 03:32:08,980
Spin!

3915
03:32:10,640 --> 03:32:11,360
Let it rip.

3916
03:32:12,180 --> 03:32:13,700
It's like Beyblade all over again.

3917
03:32:15,280 --> 03:32:16,160
Oh, God, please!

3918
03:32:17,240 --> 03:32:17,860
Last guy!

3919
03:32:18,440 --> 03:32:19,260
The last one!

3920
03:32:19,820 --> 03:32:20,240
Wait, no.

3921
03:32:20,940 --> 03:32:21,600
Wait, is that really?

3922
03:32:22,820 --> 03:32:23,420
Is there more?

3923
03:32:24,780 --> 03:32:25,880
Where's the other...

3924
03:32:25,880 --> 03:32:26,560
Oh, over there.

3925
03:32:27,260 --> 03:32:27,740
On me!

3926
03:32:28,600 --> 03:32:28,860
On me!

3927
03:32:28,940 --> 03:32:30,400
You can't hear me, but on me!

3928
03:32:32,260 --> 03:32:32,800
Bade Blade.

3929
03:32:33,480 --> 03:32:34,520
It's time to Bade Blade.

3930
03:32:35,880 --> 03:32:37,560
We have what... Please get me out of here.

3931
03:32:38,820 --> 03:32:40,360
We just have...

3932
03:32:40,360 --> 03:32:42,900
We have two more chapters left.

3933
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:43,780
We're so close.

3934
03:32:44,780 --> 03:32:47,500
We're so close to finishing this game!

3935
03:32:48,220 --> 03:32:48,700
Spin!

3936
03:32:50,440 --> 03:32:53,420
Alright, now I actually zap, because I actually don't know
where they are.

3937
03:32:53,860 --> 03:32:54,960
I lost track of people.

3938
03:32:57,500 --> 03:32:59,320
They're going way too fast.

3939
03:33:00,320 --> 03:33:02,400
I can't be bothered to chase after them.

3940
03:33:04,900 --> 03:33:08,340
I can't be bothered to chase after this fucker.

3941
03:33:10,280 --> 03:33:10,960
Alright.

3942
03:33:11,620 --> 03:33:13,440
It's all the fucking stealth elves.

3943
03:33:14,280 --> 03:33:15,720
Bro, you're not cool!

3944
03:33:16,940 --> 03:33:17,320
Alright.

3945
03:33:17,880 --> 03:33:18,720
We gotta help.

3946
03:33:19,420 --> 03:33:20,260
We gotta help these two.

3947
03:33:21,040 --> 03:33:21,320
Alright.

3948
03:33:21,860 --> 03:33:22,640
It's time!

3949
03:33:23,180 --> 03:33:24,540
For my secret weapon!

3950
03:33:25,440 --> 03:33:26,120
Woo!

3951
03:33:37,700 --> 03:33:41,600
This is like babies of urban time, I think.

3952
03:33:44,120 --> 03:33:44,520
All right.

3953
03:33:44,960 --> 03:33:48,520
All I'm going to say, never go out of the formula.

3954
03:33:49,720 --> 03:33:50,960
Let it rip.

3955
03:33:52,560 --> 03:33:52,860
Oh, God.

3956
03:33:53,060 --> 03:33:54,060
No, not the sixth graders.

3957
03:33:54,460 --> 03:33:54,760
It's okay.

3958
03:33:54,860 --> 03:33:56,600
They can't jump up here, so I'm fine.

3959
03:33:58,060 --> 03:33:58,380
They...

3960
03:33:58,380 --> 03:33:59,480
Oh, what?

3961
03:34:00,060 --> 03:34:01,480
You're not even the sixth graders.

3962
03:34:01,500 --> 03:34:03,800
I'm stunned forever.

3963
03:34:05,060 --> 03:34:05,500
I'm...

3964
03:34:05,500 --> 03:34:06,160
Oh, God.

3965
03:34:07,080 --> 03:34:09,420
Oh, oh, I got poisoned.

3966
03:34:10,360 --> 03:34:11,640
I definitely got poisoned.

3967
03:34:14,560 --> 03:34:14,900
Alright.

3968
03:34:16,200 --> 03:34:17,520
So, we have double healers.

3969
03:34:18,260 --> 03:34:18,860
Okay.

3970
03:34:19,440 --> 03:34:21,940
I gotta get rid of the 6th graders here.

3971
03:34:22,320 --> 03:34:22,580
Ow.

3972
03:34:23,020 --> 03:34:25,220
Wait, he's, like, shooting his own people.

3973
03:34:25,400 --> 03:34:25,880
Stop the bleeding.

3974
03:34:26,040 --> 03:34:26,440
Kill yourself.

3975
03:34:27,960 --> 03:34:29,300
I don't need heals.

3976
03:34:30,880 --> 03:34:31,480
Oh.

3977
03:34:31,500 --> 03:34:32,480
Okay, maybe I do.

3978
03:34:33,440 --> 03:34:34,020
Maybe.

3979
03:34:35,100 --> 03:34:36,940
Maybe I do need this.

3980
03:34:39,820 --> 03:34:42,000
Where the fuck is the last guy?

3981
03:34:42,740 --> 03:34:43,700
Did we survive it?

3982
03:34:43,780 --> 03:34:44,360
Great job, new kid.

3983
03:34:44,460 --> 03:34:45,960
Oh my god, we fucking did it.

3984
03:34:46,480 --> 03:34:47,730
We fucking did it.

3985
03:34:48,820 --> 03:34:48,960
Oh.

3986
03:34:49,500 --> 03:34:50,580
We survived.

3987
03:34:51,160 --> 03:34:52,260
We made it.

3988
03:34:52,640 --> 03:34:53,520
See anything like?

3989
03:34:53,840 --> 03:34:54,860
Alright, let's see.

3990
03:34:55,320 --> 03:34:56,060
Rubber bubble.

3991
03:34:56,980 --> 03:34:59,240
It deals 8 damage to the attacker.

3992
03:35:00,460 --> 03:35:01,180
Do I risk it?

3993
03:35:01,500 --> 03:35:02,080
risk it.

3994
03:35:02,860 --> 03:35:03,740
I might have Napal.

3995
03:35:03,980 --> 03:35:09,390
God damn it.

3996
03:35:09,530 --> 03:35:10,950
Wait, I can risk it again.

3997
03:35:11,970 --> 03:35:12,630
How do these look?

3998
03:35:13,510 --> 03:35:14,370
Come on, Jimmy.

3999
03:35:15,410 --> 03:35:16,810
Don't fuck with me, Jimmy.

4000
03:35:20,590 --> 03:35:21,150
That's the one?

4001
03:35:21,330 --> 03:35:21,530
Great.

4002
03:35:22,090 --> 03:35:23,790
I guess I'll think of the team.

4003
03:35:23,850 --> 03:35:24,270
I'm rooting for you.

03:35:25,190 --> 03:35:25,670
I guess.

4005
03:35:26,170 --> 03:35:28,590

4006
03:35:29,930 --> 03:35:31,030
Hey, new kid, get ready.

03:36:19,710 --> 03:36:22,690

Not the adults!

4053
03:38:08,420 --> 03:38:09,580

03:39:52,880 --> 03:39:53,680

You pressed the wrong spot in my head.

03:39:59,300 --> 03:40:00,280
I fucking die.

4089
03:40:01,360 --> 03:40:02,520

03:40:03,180 --> 03:40:03,880
Come on, come on.

4091
03:40:03,940 --> 03:40:04,860
It's gotta be another way out of here.

4092
03:40:04,860 --> 03:40:05,120
Oh, there's a carbon.

4093
03:40:05,260 --> 03:40:07,960
There's carbon right over here.

4094
03:40:08,860 --> 03:40:09,380
Holy shit.

4095
03:40:09,520 --> 03:40:10,560
He has venom powers.

4096
03:40:10,920 --> 03:40:13,240
The hell is I don't think God will want us fighting around
his house like this.

4097
03:40:15,700 --> 03:40:16,460
Where is he?

4098
03:40:16,740 --> 03:40:17,360
Where's the fuck his car?

4099
03:40:17,460 --> 03:40:19,680
No, no, it's this again.

4100
03:40:20,400 --> 03:40:22,140
All right, get out of your fucking force field.

4101
03:40:24,400 --> 03:40:26,100
Get out of your fucking force field.

4102
03:40:26,900 --> 03:40:27,500
Get over here.

4103
03:40:29,100 --> 03:40:30,120
Get over here.

4104
03:40:31,200 --> 03:40:33,100
Get over here, you fucking archer.

4105
03:40:35,520 --> 03:40:35,920
Nice.

4106
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:38,700
Oh my god, I need you guys to group up more.

4107
03:40:38,800 --> 03:40:40,340
I'm wasting my attack on one person.

4108
03:40:41,020 --> 03:40:42,700
I really need you guys to group up more.

4109
03:40:43,820 --> 03:40:44,220
Shield.

4110
03:40:44,760 --> 03:40:45,360

4111
03:40:45,540 --> 03:40:45,960
area.

4112
03:40:46,700 --> 03:40:47,620
That's what I like.

4113
03:40:47,920 --> 03:40:48,880
3-4-1 special.

4114
03:40:52,340 --> 03:40:53,640
3-4-1 special.

4115
03:40:55,660 --> 03:40:56,300

4116
03:40:56,680 --> 03:40:57,340
I'm hopeful.

4117
03:40:58,700 --> 03:41:01,620
I don't know how I always get tricked into...

4118
03:41:02,240 --> 03:41:07,240
I always know that like every time Carmen runs it means he
has to...

4119
03:41:07,240 --> 03:41:11,140
It means like I have to defeat all the enemies but every

Look, I can't keep doing everything, chat.

4130
03:42:56,280 --> 03:42:57,580
I'm not gonna do everything.

4131
03:42:58,140 --> 03:42:59,580
Let's just...

4132
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:01,420
Yeah.

4133
03:43:02,300 --> 03:43:03,080
Let's go, too.

4134
03:43:03,560 --> 03:43:04,900
You know what I mean, too.

4135
03:43:05,380 --> 03:43:05,940
Let's go.

4136
03:43:06,740 --> 03:43:08,660
What the fuck is one doing?

4137
03:43:09,320 --> 03:43:11,020
Bro, can one aim?

4138
03:43:15,020 --> 03:43:18,200
I think one is, like, not doing so well.

4139
03:43:21,800 --> 03:43:22,240
Yeah.

4140
03:43:23,440 --> 03:43:25,040
Oh, I got the zombie shuffle dance.

4141
03:43:25,240 --> 03:43:25,620
What is this?

4142
03:43:27,040 --> 03:43:27,640
The moving.

4143
03:43:27,740 --> 03:43:31,060
I like how this is called the moving grooving when it's the
Snoopy dance.

4144
03:43:32,700 --> 03:43:33,500
They'll be fine.

4145
03:43:36,620 --> 03:43:37,520
I'm not gonna get kicked.

4146
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:38,080
They know.

4147
03:43:38,480 --> 03:43:41,660
They know that I am the carry.

4148
03:43:43,980 --> 03:43:45,840
They won't kick me out because I'm the carry.

4149
03:43:48,200 --> 03:43:49,060
The poison.

4150
03:43:49,120 --> 03:43:50,040
Molotov.

4151
03:43:50,340 --> 03:43:50,400
Look.

4152
03:43:50,720 --> 03:43:51,440
Here, try these on the side.

4153
03:43:51,440 --> 03:43:53,100
I want to see if I can get legendary.

4154
03:43:54,680 --> 03:43:55,480
God damn it.

4155
03:43:55,860 --> 03:43:57,440
Oh, okay.

4156
03:43:57,860 --> 03:43:58,800
20% bigger.

4157
03:43:59,700 --> 03:44:00,380
That's always good.

4158
03:44:00,900 --> 03:44:01,340
See you soon.

4159
03:44:02,200 --> 03:44:03,000
All right, I'm ready.

4160
03:44:04,480 --> 03:44:05,080
Let's go.

4161
03:44:05,920 --> 03:44:06,880
Let's go, too.

4162
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:08,300
Come on.

4163
03:44:12,220 --> 03:44:12,780
Nice.

4164
03:44:14,900 --> 03:44:16,200
I got big, bubba.

4165
03:44:17,100 --> 03:44:17,620
Big.

4166
03:44:21,730 --> 03:44:30,290
Hey, the carter is more Carmen, please I know this one, you
know, this is not realistic because Carmen would never run

4167
03:44:30,290 --> 03:44:30,890
this far

4168
03:44:35,590 --> 03:44:44,910
This is not realistic Carbo would never be up that mountain
He'd be like it would have been done after like the first

4169
03:44:44,910 --> 03:44:45,610
two areas

4170
03:44:51,220 --> 03:44:53,460
How dare you oppose the grand wizard?

4171
03:44:54,720 --> 03:44:58,260
It's just because he really doesn't want to go.

4172
03:44:59,040 --> 03:45:01,640
He really doesn't want to go to school.

4173
03:45:03,060 --> 03:45:03,520
Unrealistic.

4174
03:45:03,780 --> 03:45:05,700
Carbon would never walk so far.

4175
03:45:06,680 --> 03:45:07,720
What is this?

4176
03:45:10,040 --> 03:45:11,840
Oh god, what the fuck?

4177
03:45:12,400 --> 03:45:13,000

He's gone.

4186
03:45:53,080 --> 03:45:53,120
He's gone.

He can't hurt me no more.

4188
03:45:54,820 --> 03:45:56,920
He can't hurt me anymore.

4189
03:45:58,180 --> 03:45:58,920

03:46:11,800 --> 03:46:13,240
Raise the level of all your upgrade cards.

4198
03:46:13,480 --> 03:46:15,280
Raise the rarity of the chain lightning card.

4199
03:46:15,620 --> 03:46:16,820
Uh, I'm gonna raise the level.

4200
03:46:17,180 --> 03:46:17,980
That's powerful.

4201
03:46:18,400 --> 03:46:19,900

4206
03:46:54,050 --> 03:46:59,530
Oh, no, you don't want Mr. Hanky to attack the real Cartman.

4207
03:47:00,910 --> 03:47:01,470
Oh!

4208
03:47:03,690 --> 03:47:04,630
Oh, God.

4209
03:47:05,930 --> 03:47:06,550
This force field!

4210
03:47:07,850 --> 03:47:09,310
I'm trying to hit him.

4211
03:47:09,650 --> 03:47:10,050
I'm trying to head towards him.

4212
03:47:10,490 --> 03:47:13,050
Wait, he gets to have a force field too?

4213
03:47:14,950 --> 03:47:16,190
What the fuck?

4214
03:47:16,390 --> 03:47:17,810
Oh, no, he doesn't get a force field.

4215
03:47:18,350 --> 03:47:20,030
That's like, that's just his...

4216
03:47:20,030 --> 03:47:22,370
Oh, that's just his projectile thing!

4217
03:47:22,910 --> 03:47:23,570
Oh, God.

4218
03:47:24,050 --> 03:47:25,790
How is he so strong?

4219
03:47:27,030 --> 03:47:29,850
Who gave... Who let him have the illegal spells?

4220
03:47:30,570 --> 03:47:31,230
Where did he go?

4221
03:47:31,870 --> 03:47:33,450
Oh my god, he's over there.

4222
03:47:33,730 --> 03:47:37,370
He's over there Okay, don't worry.

4223
03:47:37,510 --> 03:47:38,290
I'm spinning.

4224
03:47:38,870 --> 03:47:39,290
I'm spinning.

4225
03:47:39,990 --> 03:47:42,790
He doesn't get sucked up into my fucking spells.

4226
03:47:43,550 --> 03:47:44,790
Oh, no, someone revive him!

4227
03:47:45,810 --> 03:47:46,330
Okay, nice.

4228
03:47:46,330 --> 03:47:47,750
I know which one is the real grand wizard.

4229
03:47:48,670 --> 03:47:49,250
I got the cue.

4230
03:47:49,370 --> 03:47:50,930
I got the cue.

4231
03:47:51,350 --> 03:47:51,830
Where is he?

4232
03:47:52,410 --> 03:47:53,090
Where is he?

4233
03:47:55,170 --> 03:48:00,050
Please Where's the real wizard he saves as he's using the
force fields?

4234
03:48:00,070 --> 03:48:01,470
God damn it you can't knock it off.

4235
03:48:01,750 --> 03:48:02,490
Where is he?

4236
03:48:02,930 --> 03:48:04,650

4237
03:48:04,770 --> 03:48:08,710
He doesn't get sucked up into my force field So that's not
fair.

4238
03:48:09,010 --> 03:48:12,830
Oh New kids you have disobeyed the grand wizard.

4239
03:48:13,070 --> 03:48:13,530

03:48:13,730 --> 03:48:14,530

I knew I was gaming.

4265
03:50:40,690 --> 03:50:42,130
I fucking knew I was gaming.

4266
03:50:42,510 --> 03:50:44,270
I knew I was carrying chat!

4267
03:50:44,930 --> 03:50:46,330
Guys, we're at the final stretch.

4268
03:50:46,870 --> 03:50:47,850
We're almost there.

4269
03:50:48,290 --> 03:50:49,930
Stage strong, everybody.

4270
03:50:50,970 --> 03:50:53,050
Okay, uh, everyone have a nice dinner?

4271
03:50:53,430 --> 03:50:54,150
Man, I am stuffed.

4272
03:50:54,270 --> 03:50:54,850
I hate too much.

4273
03:50:58,070 --> 03:50:59,710
So, Kube, uh, back to the game, I guess.

4274
03:50:59,930 --> 03:51:02,310
I believe we are about to join forces in battle of Mr.
Hanky, right?

4275
03:51:03,170 --> 03:51:03,510
Fuck you, Cartman.

4276
03:51:03,650 --> 03:51:04,450
We're not playing with you anymore.

4277
03:51:04,750 --> 03:51:05,930
Yeah, you tried to kill us with Dark Matter.

4278
03:51:06,050 --> 03:51:06,510
You're out of the game.

4279
03:51:06,930 --> 03:51:09,210
Well, except you can't kick me out of the game because I'm
the Grand Wizard.

4280
03:51:09,990 --> 03:51:10,170
So?

4281
03:51:10,370 --> 03:51:11,850
Why can't we have a new Grand Wizard?

4282
03:51:12,170 --> 03:51:14,170
We know you're not going to help because you still don't
want to go back to school.

4283
03:51:14,730 --> 03:51:15,030
He's right.

4284
03:51:15,050 --> 03:51:16,970
You were pretty adamant about not wanting to go back to
school.

4285
03:51:17,530 --> 03:51:18,630
Well, I've changed my mind.

4286
03:51:19,170 --> 03:51:20,830
The truth is none of this is my fault.

4287
03:51:21,190 --> 03:51:23,110
I think we all know whose fault it is.

4288
03:51:24,490 --> 03:51:25,470
Whose fault is it?

4289
03:51:25,770 --> 03:51:26,050
Me?

4290
03:51:26,410 --> 03:51:32,190
It's been just a shit show of rules breaking and I got
caught up in it all the time.

4291
03:51:32,450 --> 03:51:34,290
But we have to find Mr. Hanky and stop this storm.

4292
03:51:34,650 --> 03:51:36,630
It's not my fault you guys are all bad at the game.

4293
03:51:36,950 --> 03:51:37,630
We should let him play.

4294
03:51:38,330 --> 03:51:40,590
He just wants to join us so he can betray us again.

4295
03:51:40,850 --> 03:51:42,390
I want to join you because that's the ruse.

4296
03:51:42,790 --> 03:51:45,250
The losing clan has to join forces with whoever defeated
them, right?

4297
03:51:45,570 --> 03:51:46,330
That's your rule, Kyle.

4298
03:51:46,630 --> 03:51:51,730
And I understand how important rules are because if we don't
have rules, then the new kid's just gonna ruin the game like

4299
03:51:51,730 --> 03:51:52,050
always.

4300
03:51:52,510 --> 03:51:53,530
He's got a point there.

4301
03:51:53,690 --> 03:51:54,490
What did I do?

4302
03:51:54,810 --> 03:51:56,590
We have to take Mr. Hanky down before more people die.

4303
03:51:56,610 --> 03:51:57,450
It's not my fault.

4304
03:51:57,710 --> 03:51:59,510
I'm just a better gamer than all

4305
03:52:04,570 --> 03:52:11,530
year how is that my fault if we survive this i'm totally
kicking your ass cartman what did i do i'm kicking his ass

4306
03:52:11,530 --> 03:52:18,070
first your leader chooses the next mission but you can go
get me some hot cocoa all right let's see if we have oh we

4307
03:52:18,070 --> 03:52:26,090

and explodes after a short delay wait that's so that sounds

4308
03:52:26,090 --> 03:52:33,330
so cool that seeks enemies and you just pick one okay we
don't need heals My team will heal for me.

4309
03:52:33,370 --> 03:52:33,970
Tell your friends.

4310
03:52:35,170 --> 03:52:35,590
That's alright.

4311
03:52:36,210 --> 03:52:37,570
My team will heal for me.

4312
03:52:37,610 --> 03:52:38,110
Look at that.

4313
03:52:38,230 --> 03:52:38,910
Now I have drones.

4314
03:52:39,450 --> 03:52:40,530
We've got clothes.

4315
03:52:40,690 --> 03:52:42,170
Alright, we need the dark matter too.

4316
03:52:43,170 --> 03:52:44,310
Alright, dark matter time.

4317
03:52:44,470 --> 03:52:44,930

4320
03:52:50,050 --> 03:52:50,530

4321
03:52:51,890 --> 03:52:52,370

I replaced right here.

4324
03:52:57,590 --> 03:52:59,510
They kicked me out.

4325
03:52:59,750 --> 03:53:01,130
I don't understand.

4326
03:53:01,410 --> 03:53:21,990
what did they kick me out I was carrying I was carrying
there has to be somebody there there has to be somebody on

Three people to join them.

4349
03:56:03,340 --> 03:56:07,140

03:56:07,660 --> 03:56:09,440
The assault on Mr. Hanks' fortress.

4361
03:57:07,060 --> 03:57:07,880
I'll say it now.

4362
03:57:08,020 --> 03:57:08,420
I'm indie.

4363
03:57:08,960 --> 03:57:12,220
This game, it's mixed reviews for a reason.

4364
03:57:15,160 --> 03:57:19,400
It's only for my love of Soapark that I'm willing to play to
the end.

4365
03:57:20,480 --> 03:57:24,160
I Wait, don't buy this game.

4366
03:57:24,500 --> 03:57:26,080
Don't buy this game.

4367
03:57:27,680 --> 03:57:29,240
Mr. Hickey, why are you doing this?

4368
03:57:29,460 --> 03:57:30,440
You used to be our friend.

4369
03:57:31,060 --> 03:57:32,320
Yeah, until you kicked me out of town.

4370
03:57:32,320 --> 03:57:33,080
Yeah, but he got canceled.

4371
03:57:33,440 --> 03:57:35,240
He canceled me and made me an outcast.

4372
03:57:35,760 --> 03:57:39,200
And all I did was text him in and tweet a couple bad jokes.

4373
03:57:40,120 --> 03:57:41,160
They weren't just bad jokes.

4374
03:57:41,300 --> 03:57:43,040
They were really racist and homophobic jokes.

4375
03:57:43,480 --> 03:57:44,320
That were pretty funny.

4376
03:57:44,980 --> 03:57:48,740
The worst part is, you boys weren't there for me.

4377
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:49,960
My own friends.

4378
03:57:50,300 --> 03:57:51,660
They just turned their back.

4379
03:57:52,840 --> 03:57:55,540
No, you turned your back on us, Mr. Henke.

4380
03:57:56,200 --> 03:57:57,880
We're not going to let you keep destroying South Park.

4381
03:57:58,500 --> 03:57:59,360
Reverse the spell now.

4382
03:57:59,920 --> 03:58:02,600
Stop this endless winter, or we're going to have to end it
ourselves.

4383
03:58:03,020 --> 03:58:03,700
You're too late.

4384
03:58:04,220 --> 03:58:07,660
This town and Amber Green is tasting my dark matter.

4385
03:58:08,240 --> 03:58:09,800
I'm in control now.

4386
03:58:10,620 --> 03:58:15,040
All I needed was one of you to use my dark magic and build
up its power.

4387
03:58:15,560 --> 03:58:18,460
I'd put my money on Stan, but he fucked it up.

4388
03:58:18,860 --> 03:58:20,980
And I had to settle for that lame new kid.

Last wave.

4396
03:59:06,620 --> 03:59:07,540
Once, I understand.

4397
03:59:11,460 --> 03:59:15,220
Are you saying Mr. Hanky the Christmas poo came out of
Jesus's butthole?

4398
03:59:15,460 --> 03:59:16,060
Wait, what?

4399
03:59:16,700 --> 03:59:17,420
The holiest.

4400
03:59:17,860 --> 03:59:19,320
That is the power you're dealing with.

4401
03:59:19,840 --> 03:59:21,020
So beware his wrath.

4402
03:59:22,580 --> 03:59:23,860
I want to be able to summon people.

4403
03:59:25,360 --> 03:59:27,640
What do I have?

4404
03:59:29,500 --> 03:59:31,460
What does Mr. Hanky have?

4405
03:59:35,020 --> 03:59:36,100
Holy protection.

4406
03:59:36,900 --> 03:59:38,320
Be gone, projectiles!

4407
03:59:38,980 --> 03:59:39,600

4414
03:59:51,200 --> 03:59:51,660
Hey, no kid.

4415
03:59:51,760 --> 03:59:52,560

4520
04:08:03,750 --> 04:08:04,690
We have to wait for it.

4521
04:08:04,730 --> 04:08:05,690

4565
04:10:11,670 --> 04:10:12,850
Dark magic is shit.

4566
04:10:13,290 --> 04:10:15,010
This whole time, we've been smearing shit on ourselves.

4567
04:10:15,010 --> 04:10:15,670
Oh, sad.

4568
04:10:15,830 --> 04:10:16,610
Now you know.

4569
04:10:16,630 --> 04:10:17,770
I just decided not to think about it.

4570
04:10:17,830 --> 04:10:18,810
Because I'm so gross.

4571
04:10:19,310 --> 04:10:20,670
Not as gross as going back to school.

4572
04:10:21,270 --> 04:10:21,770
Sad.

4573
04:10:22,310 --> 04:10:23,490
Now you realize.

4574
04:10:23,890 --> 04:10:26,130
Guys, it's Mr. Hink.

4575
04:10:26,150 --> 04:10:28,170
What else would it be?

4576
04:10:28,330 --> 04:10:30,510
It's literally Mr. Hanky.

4577
04:10:31,730 --> 04:10:32,890

like i even went to the book of mormon musical with the

4785
04:26:31,320 --> 04:26:37,880
original cast and got like, I bought like VIP seat, like not
VIP, sorry, like some of the best seats for Book of Mormon

4786
04:26:37,880 --> 04:26:39,280
because it was like one of the musicals.

4787
04:26:39,580 --> 04:26:41,100
I've always wanted to watch.

4788
04:26:41,540 --> 04:26:47,800
And I was like in New York at, like I was in New York at the
time for, for like a conference, like an academic

4789
04:26:47,800 --> 04:26:48,380
conference.

4790
04:26:48,680 --> 04:26:57,140
So I was lucky enough to see the Book of Mormon with the
original cast, you know, before they all went become stars

4791
04:26:57,140 --> 04:26:57,960
in their own right.

4792
04:27:00,640 --> 04:27:02,280
And I love, like, all the stuff they do.

4793
04:27:02,700 --> 04:27:08,000
I love, like, when they were the guy, one of them, when they
did the voice acting for one of the despicable me movies.

4794
04:27:08,180 --> 04:27:09,140
That was pretty fucking funny.

4795
04:27:09,660 --> 04:27:20,180
But, like, holy fuck, this game, this game was a fucking
chore to play.

4796
04:27:26,740 --> 04:27:30,560
This game, I...

4797
04:27:30,640 --> 04:27:41,660
i took a risk and a gamble to play this game on launch
because i was like okay i had a feeling it won't be like the

4798
04:27:41,660 --> 04:27:47,980
perfect game because it's like this weird this is a new area
they're gonna play they're like there's a new area they

4799
04:27:47,980 --> 04:27:53,980
wanted to explore but oh my god oh my god

4800
04:28:01,380 --> 04:28:12,240
I think it just it just needed something it felt really
repetitive the longer the longer you play it the it got like

4801
04:28:12,240 --> 04:28:24,480
more and more repetitive so like it just needed something
more it just it really needed something more it felt like

4802
04:28:24,480 --> 04:28:33,320
really fucking repetitive oh my god but we did it Guys, we
fucking did it.

4803
04:28:35,020 --> 04:28:36,800
I can't believe zero.

4804
04:28:37,060 --> 04:28:41,160
When I try to queue up for easy, zero game.

4805
04:28:41,360 --> 04:28:43,040
Zero players were playing.

4806
04:28:43,420 --> 04:28:45,780
That was actually crazy.

4807
04:28:46,940 --> 04:28:50,380
There was nobody playing a game on easy.

4808
04:28:51,760 --> 04:28:54,820
And one guy on normal.

4809
04:28:56,200 --> 04:28:57,840
Oh, we cleared it.

4810
04:28:57,920 --> 04:28:59,240

I was like, okay, because I was like, oh, hey, they're
streaming early access, like the early release copy of the

4842
04:31:33,180 --> 04:31:33,920
fucking game.

4843
04:31:34,600 --> 04:31:35,900
And then I was watching it.

4844
04:31:36,140 --> 04:31:38,820
I was, I watched five minutes.

4845
04:31:40,000 --> 04:31:44,360
And then they were like, this is the best game we've ever
played.

4846
04:31:45,600 --> 04:31:49,580
They were like, they were like, oh my God, this is so fun.

4847
04:31:49,820 --> 04:31:52,140
I, oh my God, guys, this is so fucking fun.

4848
04:31:52,260 --> 04:31:55,800
This is one of the best I'm like, bro.

4849
04:32:01,020 --> 04:32:04,640
Like, oh my god, this is so fucking fun, guys.

4850
04:32:04,860 --> 04:32:07,020
I was like, oh my god, isn't actually that fun?

4851
04:32:11,300 --> 04:32:12,200
No, they were.

4852
04:32:12,480 --> 04:32:13,700
They were sponsored.

4853
04:32:13,900 --> 04:32:14,800
They were sponsored.

4854
04:32:15,120 --> 04:32:16,640
So, like, it's understandable.

4855
04:32:17,320 --> 04:32:22,060
But, like, I, bro, I like, I was like, I believed it a
little bit.

4856
04:32:22,120 --> 04:32:23,220
I was like, okay.

4857
04:32:23,220 --> 04:32:32,060
because I I was like oh man I was hesitant I that was I
watched the early copy and that's why I bought the deluxe

4858
04:32:32,060 --> 04:32:39,480
version I bought the I pre-ordered the deluxe version
because I was like oh my god maybe it's not that bad because

4859
04:32:39,480 --> 04:32:46,900
I was worried I was like oh man I'm worried me I fell for it
I actually fell for it because they actually sounded really

4860
04:32:46,900 --> 04:32:53,200
exciting excited they were they actually sounded so excited
I fucking fell for it um

4861
04:32:58,360 --> 04:33:06,320
I fucking I fucking fell for the sponsor I was like oh my
god they sound like they're actually having so much fun so

4862
04:33:06,320 --> 04:33:14,900
so because that was what pushed me to pre-ordering the
deluxe version over like the normal copy like I was like do

4863
04:33:14,900 --> 04:33:20,040
I get the deluxe copy or do I because I was like okay if I
get the normal copy I'll just do like I just like play the

4864
04:33:20,040 --> 04:33:28,380
first two chapters and then call looked at fun as fun as
like the other games their older games and then and then

4865
04:33:28,380 --> 04:33:34,880
like and then i watched their sponsored stream i watched
five minutes of their sponsored stream and that was the

4866
04:33:34,880 --> 04:33:39,600
moment where they were like oh my god this game is so fun
and i was like oh my god maybe it is so fun so then i was

4867
04:33:39,600 --> 04:33:54,120
like all right i'm going i'm i am going to risk it i'm gonna
risk it i fell for I fell for it when you want to believe

4868
04:33:54,120 --> 04:34:02,720
the thing is when the creators when the creators actually
like take control like take creative control they can make

4869
04:34:02,720 --> 04:34:09,680
really really really good things like like like uh the
creators of self-park when they have majority of the

4870
04:34:09,680 --> 04:34:17,980
creative control they're really good at making really good
games or really good shows or really good like But I don't

4871
04:34:17,980 --> 04:34:19,380
know what happened to this game.

4872
04:34:19,880 --> 04:34:21,840
I don't know what happened to this game.

4873
04:34:22,160 --> 04:34:23,940
Like, they had creative controller.

4874
04:34:24,560 --> 04:34:26,280
So, like, what the fuck happened?

4875
04:34:26,740 --> 04:34:27,880
Like, what?

4876
04:34:29,340 --> 04:34:29,820
Yeah.

4877
04:34:30,220 --> 04:34:31,160
Yeah, Trey and Matt.

4878
04:34:31,660 --> 04:34:33,160
I was so surprised.

4879
04:34:33,520 --> 04:34:35,240
Because usually they do really well.

4880
04:34:35,440 --> 04:34:36,580
Like, the...

4881
04:34:36,580 --> 04:34:36,980
The...

4882
04:34:37,920 --> 04:34:41,160
The Stick of Truth and, like, the Fractured Butthole.

4883
04:34:41,800 --> 04:34:42,940
Those are really good...

4884
04:34:42,940 --> 04:34:46,280
I mean, I haven't played Fractured Butthole, but I heard it
was a really good game, too.

4885
04:34:48,300 --> 04:35:00,240
they were really good and then like the musical stuff that
was really good what the fuck happened here what happened

4886
04:35:00,240 --> 04:35:16,480
I'm so sad it was made by a different studio maybe I think
the 3D oh no different dev team I guess yeah the studio says

4887
04:35:16,480 --> 04:35:23,200
gullible on the dokey look many thank you this super chat
thank you thank you yeah but like i don't know i trusted i

4888
04:35:23,200 --> 04:35:30,880
trusted i trusted the creators because like usually when
they're head of the creative team um they work really hard

4889
04:35:30,880 --> 04:35:42,600
in trying to make a good game so i was i was just surprised
that it was just mid it was so mid it was it's not like

4890
04:35:42,600 --> 04:35:48,380
super shitty it was just really mid It was incredibly mid.

4891
04:35:48,800 --> 04:35:49,620
I'm sorry.

4892
04:35:53,180 --> 04:35:54,900

04:35:57,100 --> 04:35:57,380

4897
04:36:02,020 --> 04:36:04,100
