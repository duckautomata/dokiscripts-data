1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,180
Calera is on it, man.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,040
She's ready to go.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,260
Whoa!

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,220
Okay...

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,340
Wait, what?

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,500
Wait, I was on it.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,020
They're trying to do...

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,500
What's going on?

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,290
I won for... oh wait, this is training.

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,450
You got first on the training one.

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,850
She's not gonna leave now!

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,850
She's not gonna leave!

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,930
This is insane, dude.

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,330
I won the heads or tails!

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,650
I didn't win the heads or tails!

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,850
Oh sh...

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,050
Okay, I could listen to my own stream.

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:49,470
Whoops.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,210
Hey, this is what we'll do.

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,870
What?

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,760
One more minute, then we gotta get it.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,040
Alright.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,120
Gooby plays modern!

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,520
Modern too!

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,420
Sorry, caps lock.

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,680
I can't believe we started early.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
I'm already mentally over.

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,920
After heads or tails, I'm already done for the day.

29
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,380
This is a run back, yeah, from the one and done.

30
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,600
Yeah, no, she's gonna one and done.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,740
She apparently requested to one and done me.

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,100
Just one and done her again.

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,340
Just one and done her again.

34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,780
Easy.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,620
I don't think I'm allowed to.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,840
I think I might get...

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,460
I might get yelled at.

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,760
So what you do is you win, and then go back to character select screen.

39
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,060
Oh my god, that's so evil.

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,740
I think I'm gonna get kicked out.

41
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,820
Oh, thank god.

42
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,220
Are we just waiting?

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,320
For...

44
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,460
Yeah.

45
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:20,580
Yeah.

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,660
I think she's asking for an okay from Sam Jam.

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,900
Oh yeah, you can play once...

48
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,020
Wait, they're spectating our match?

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,140
This is fucked!

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,600
Are we on stream?

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,000
Apparently.

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah, I think they're gonna put us on the mainstream.

53
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,340
That's fucked.

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,540
That's fucked.

55
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,340
The war's staving.

56
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,080
I'm really tired.

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,880
The coin...

58
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
The coin flip!

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
It was so intense!

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,440
She already lost, right?

61
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,360
The coin flip was so intense!

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,980
It was the mod.

63
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,700
All those...

64
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,000
She won the coin flip, but it didn't matter at the end of the day.

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,180
It was just way too much.

66
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,100
Too much pressure on the heads or tails.

67
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,740
50-50.

68
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,060
Oh shit.

69
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,140
I get player one?

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,420
Do I get that side?

71
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:07,940
Yay!

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,400
You lost.

73
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:09,980
Tough luck.

74
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,240
I think she was talking about...

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,020
I'm honoring the first flip!

76
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,300
That's fucking right.

77
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:17,980
Oh.

78
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,820
That's fucking...

79
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,280
Based mod.

80
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,660
Yeah, right.

81
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,100
Cool.

82
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,040
Cool.

83
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,980
Let's do it, Doke.

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Alright, eat up.

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,360
Ugh.

86
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,460
Ugh.

87
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,080
Okay.

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,900
You think she'll let me?

89
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,620
Okay, I'm gonna do the knowledge check.

90
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,280
Wait, are you hungover?

91
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,000
You're gonna start with the run?

92
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,620
I'm gonna do the knowledge check.

93
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,660
Oh, I got...

94
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,120
I got some extra money.

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,060
You get one every set.

96
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,440
Yeah.

97
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,800
If it works...

98
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,300
You know it's gonna be free.

99
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,380
Let's see.

100
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,600
Nope.

101
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,460
He's using the free...

102
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:51,980
The free.

103
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,500
The free.

104
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:52,720
The free.

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,820
It didn't work.

106
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,400
Oh, we're behind.

107
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,300
Oh shit, we caught up.

108
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,260
No, we caught up.

109
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,980
Wow, technology.

110
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,860
We caught up.

111
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,500
Oh shit.

112
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,160
Oh my god, Gumi's a master on wake up.

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,500
Oh, she's using the toy.

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,560
Guys, I think I messed up with the king thing.

115
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,440
The king thing was definitely not it.

116
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,420
The king thing was not it.

117
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,420
Did I rush in?

118
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,580
She's not gonna be ready for shit.

119
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,780
You gotta block and wake him now.

120
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,300
Okay.

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,860
Just block, block, block, block, block.

122
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,700
There you go.

123
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,380
Yep, that's a triangle.

124
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,880
Oh, she did that to me.

125
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,860
Yeah.

126
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,420
Yeah, so she jumped the run grab last round.

127
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,060
So let's do just drive rush something else.

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,080
Drive rush something else.

129
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,520
And then time to square.

130
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,620
Okay.

131
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,180
Just block on this one.

132
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,020
What the hell?

133
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,580
She got combos?

134
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,500
Okay.

135
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,420
Oh yeah, get in there.

136
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,360
Okay, don't drive rush her.

137
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,120
Just walk up.

138
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,680
Yeah.

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,200
Okay, just block.

140
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,000
Nice!

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,640
Oh.

142
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,820
Okay, block it out, block it out.

143
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,180
Okay.

144
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,280
Yeah, just gotta block it out.

145
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

146
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,720
Oh.

147
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,560
I can get in.

148
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,280
Yeah, she's gonna do that.

149
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,140
So you remember, if she does that, you can do down triangle from full screen.

150
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,560
Oh, what?

151
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,580
Oh my god.

152
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,320
Okay, just block here.

153
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,520
Yeah, you gotta walk in.

154
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,500
You gotta make a miracle happen.

155
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:41,920
Yeah, you gotta walk in.

156
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:41,920
You gotta make a miracle happen.

157
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,680
Oh, she grabbed.

158
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah.

159
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,700
So the only thing is, like, you just gave up too much health too early.

160
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,420
Okay.

161
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Remember when you're walking in, use circle and jump x to walk her down.

162
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,840
Circle and jump x...

163
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,240
Oh, okay.

164
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,860
Yeah, when she...

165
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,740
Is this first a one?

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,460
What happened there?

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,900
No, that was a one and done.

168
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,180
One and done.

169
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,520
That's fine, that gives me time to talk strax.

170
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,620
So we win?

171
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,440
Yeah.

172
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,300
Yeah, she quit.

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,540
Let's go!

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,740
Brian, what does she do if...

175
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
If Gumi's full screen, it's...

176
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,040
The Blanka ball is coming, right?

177
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,260
You just do Lariat.

178
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,080
Okay.

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,840
If you're sitting full screen and she flies at you with the Blanka ball, it's down triangle.

180
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,840
But you're not even in that range right now.

181
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,880
That's not even what's getting you.

182
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,100
It's just up close.

183
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,280
It's kind of a scramble.

184
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,900
Let's try to slow it down.

185
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,000
You can play much better when you're slowing it down.

186
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,540
And let's use the spaced out moves.

187
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,080
And if you knock her down, just don't even approach.

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,300
Just let her stand back up.

189
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,180
It's going to match the ball.

190
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, she's going to Blanka ball.

191
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,840
Am I not watching?

192
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,440
Oh my god.

193
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,080
Beat her up!

194
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,420
Oh, I Lariat though.

195
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,580
That was a good try.

196
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,400
Yeah, it's tough.

197
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,380
So just keep trying to get closer.

198
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,000
Nice.

199
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,480
Just block it out, block it out.

200
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,000
That's her command grab.

201
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,920
That you have to jump.

202
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,040
Okay.

203
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,440
Okay, we got to go ham, I think.

204
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,880
I think it's time.

205
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,460
I think it's time to unleash the demons.

206
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,060
I think it's time to unleash the demons.

207
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:41,820
Nice.

208
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,880
There you go.

209
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,900
I accidentally used a ball.

210
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,020
You don't need it, you don't need it.

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,200
Oh, I don't know.

212
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
I feel like I do.

213
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,920
Don't worry, don't worry.

214
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,240
Just block it out and then go ham.

215
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,680
That's fine.

216
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,900
Just block all this.

217
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,140
Yeah, no problem.

218
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,400
Yep, you're good.

219
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,460
Cool.

220
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,220
Keep blocking.

221
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,980
Cool.

222
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,140
Keep blocking.

223
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,020
Yeah.

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,840
Aw, she jumped.

225
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,480
She might not punish.

226
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,300
Yeah, see?

227
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
Aw, she...

228
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,080
Okay, wait.

229
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,680
You have a chance.

230
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,840
Nice.

231
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,560
Get a DI.

232
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,040
Get a DI.

233
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,060
Oh, okay.

234
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,220
Let's go!

235
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,280
Let's go!

236
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,700
Alright, comeback time.

237
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,400
Aw.

238
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,650
Nice jump in.

239
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,750
Oh, jeez.

240
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,410
Yeah, jump X might just body hurt.

241
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,370
I'm not going to anti-air you.

242
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,550
Just jump at her with X.

243
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,150
Oh man, lucky.

244
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,130
Yep, there you go.

245
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,430
Exactly.

246
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,490
Block it out, block it out, block it out.

247
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,270
Easy.

248
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,350
Let's go!

249
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,950
Aw, she did her super.

250
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,370
You're still alive.

251
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,110
I think you're going to live though.

252
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,730
You're going to live.

253
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,490
You're going to be close though.

254
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,630
Okay, just got to block.

255
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,930
Nice anti-air.

256
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,210
What?

257
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,550
No!

258
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:26,430
Oh!

259
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,730
Block, block, block, block, block, block.

260
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,930
Yep, exactly.

261
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,650
She doesn't know how to punish.

262
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,890
She's going to randomly slide, so you need to block her toes.

263
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,810
No, she grabbed.

264
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,530
She grabbed.

265
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,250
I had a feeling she was going to grab too.

266
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,110
But...

267
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,530
That was a really good try.

268
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,310
Yeah, I had a feeling.

269
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,170
Is that it?

270
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,570
That's it, right?

271
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,350
Yeah.

272
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,710
Yeah, I felt she was going to grab, but then you were like, block.

273
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,830
So I was like, okay, I'll block.

274
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,250
Yeah, I mean...

275
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,010
She's been grabbing the entire time.

276
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,970
The other thing she does there is the slide.

277
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,850
That's the problem.

278
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,790
So you got to react to the command grab and jump it.

279
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,210
Yeah.

280
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,470
Maybe a bad call.

281
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,730
I didn't think she would do the command grab there.

282
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,170
There's two things she does.

283
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,810
I think she was doing more grabs than slides in general.

284
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:11,930
I think she was doing more grabs than slides in general.

285
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:11,970
Yeah.

286
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,630
Yeah, the slide is like the classic blocker thing.

287
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,970
Yeah, I'm going to remove the body.

288
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,010
I think next time we know that she just does command grab.

289
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,610
I think next time we know that she just does command grab.

290
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,730
We can see it in jump or lariat.

291
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,650
Buffed Gief.

292
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,050
Yeah, honestly, get him in the top five.

293
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,390
I almost forgot I'm on a team with a bunch of degenerate Gief players for a second.

294
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,810
That's awful.

295
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,850
What's the big idea?

296
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,610
Oh no, this guy has sand.

297
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,870
Why do you have to manually spectate?

298
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:49,710
Holy...

299
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,110
Did the match begin?

300
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,910
It did.

301
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,870
Wait, what?

302
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,350
Yeah, I did click it, but it didn't let me spectate earlier.

303
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,510
Yeah, I did click it, but it didn't let me spectate earlier.

304
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,270
Oh, damn.

305
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,210
Yeah, it has to catch up.

306
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,590
Alright, I'm locked in.

307
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,750
What the f...

308
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,510
Oh, okay, I spectated though, so it was like...

309
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,270
It went super speed mode.

310
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:18,890
It went super speed mode.

311
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,070
Very nice.

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,020
Very nice.

313
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Nice.

314
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,320
Nice.

315
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,480
So good.

316
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,560
Oh, nice.

317
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,420
Oh, yes.

318
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
The combos.

319
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,360
Oh, combos, okay.

320
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,040
Oh my god.

321
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,540
You actually know what you're doing.

322
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,220
Holding my breath.

323
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,080
Let's go!

324
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,260
Nice!

325
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
You got this, SK.

326
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,780
That was solid.

327
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,610
He's so scared.

328
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,290
Oh.

329
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,750
Oh.

330
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,090
Oh.

331
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,370
Yeah, you're about to burn him out.

332
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,250
Oh!

333
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,410
No!

334
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,970
That's the problem.

335
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,090
He's gonna burn you out.

336
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,070
Yeah.

337
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,350
You're good.

338
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,630
He's spending everything.

339
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,990
He has to do this, because...

340
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,810
Yeah.

341
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,090
Oh.

342
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,570
Okay.

343
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,110
If you believe.

344
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,270
Oh!

345
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,530
You have your level 3.

346
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:39,830
Oh!

347
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,370
No!

348
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,090
You got the meter advantage.

349
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,270
Oh!

350
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,330
I'm going to react to one.

351
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,120
Not very good.

352
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,100
Amazing level 3.

353
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,680
Oh, nice.

354
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,360
I love that.

355
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,700
That's perfect.

356
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,180
And it's classic.

357
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,640
It's gonna do so much damage.

358
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:08,860
Nice.

359
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,200
Yeah, he's just waiting to anti-air.

360
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,960
So we can approach on the ground a lot.

361
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,240
There you go.

362
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,260
That's fine.

363
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,660
Oh, no!

364
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,060
Oh!

365
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,580
That's nice.

366
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,080
You played that really good.

367
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,800
The only thing is, if you go into burnout, just press way less buttons.

368
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,900
Just get your one poke and then block.

369
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,420
But you're playing really good.

370
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,740
There's nothing really I would change about your game plan at all.

371
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,440
You got this.

372
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,080
Wait, what?

373
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,400
Is your match still going, SK?

374
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,740
No, they left.

375
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,400
Yeah.

376
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,240
Sometimes it kicks out just the spectators.

377
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,700
That's why.

378
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,080
Wait, it kicked out BrawlPro.

379
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,160
Yeah, you're the only one that got kicked out.

380
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,740
That's fucked.

381
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,520
That's actually fucked.

382
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,440
What are you doing over there?

383
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,380
I think Steam just died.

384
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,420
Did Steam die?

385
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,420
It's not maintenance day.

386
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,300
It's Wednesday.

387
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,620
It's on Tuesdays, right?

388
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,740
Yeah, it's Wednesday.

389
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,120
I'm still in here.

390
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, me too.

391
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,520
This happens to me in ranked a lot.

392
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,020
Is it me?

393
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,980
No, I mean, CFN just is mysterious.

394
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,840
CFN is fun.

395
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,120
What the fuck?

396
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,700
Yeah, the only other thing, SK, is that you can mix in more walk-up throws.

397
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,960
Like in your dry brush pressure, you can dry brush and then walk and throw a little bit more.

398
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,340
I'll restart Steam.

399
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,860
Like crazy.

400
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,960
So, your pressure is really good.

401
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,180
If you throw him a bit more, he's gonna fall apart.

402
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,020
Everything else is perfect though.

403
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,460
Got it.

404
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,910
I'm nervy.

405
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,030
It's alright.

406
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,430
You got this.

407
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,310
Let's go.

408
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,030
Ow.

409
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,490
Round robin one doesn't matter.

410
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:20,890
Remember.

411
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,370
Ow.

412
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:22,730
Ow.

413
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,210
Oh wait, you're fighting.

414
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,030
I didn't even realize it started.

415
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,510
I wasn't spectating.

416
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:42,970
Nice.

417
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,290
Reversal.

418
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,850
He's catching on to your reversals.

419
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,290
I think just a little bit more blocking on wakeup.

420
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,430
He doesn't throw you ever, so you can just block a little bit more on wakeup.

421
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,010
Man.

422
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,290
Who showed up to the party?

423
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,750
Dude, that's so annoying.

424
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,050
Nice throw.

425
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,670
Very good.

426
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:31,910
There you go.

427
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,700
Oh.

428
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,000
I fear I'm dead.

429
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,340
It's over.

430
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:43,900
Yeah.

431
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,900
GG.

432
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,140
GG.

433
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,320
Good try.

434
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,380
I saw you went for that level three combo.

435
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,280
Is that what happened earlier?

436
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,020
Yeah.

437
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,500
Yeah, that would have been really sick.

438
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,300
Yeah, if that had landed, you would have been a good spot to win.

439
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,940
But, it was a good try.

440
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
You had a good game plan.

441
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,540
Next time.

442
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,620
It's alright.

443
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,060
It's day one.

444
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,960
Day one.

445
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:23,480
We're sandbagging on purpose so we can analyze the situation.

446
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,460
Right?

447
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,480
That's it, right?

448
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,880
No, I actually agree.

449
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,460
I think there's clear ways to beat these opponents.

450
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,880
Gumi was doing the command grabs.

451
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,260
Just got to figure out the jumps on that.

452
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,740
Ultima was just waiting for DI's.

453
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,840
We just got to throw them a bunch.

454
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,440
There's definitely clear weaknesses we can pick them apart with next time for sure.

455
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

456
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,080
I think next time instead of a coin flip, it's rock, paper, scissors.

457
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,900
And I had my king mod on and it threw me off.

458
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,460
Yeah, I was playing with the king mod and it literally threw me off.

459
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,060
I thought it was going to be that bad.

460
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,520
I was like, this looks too weird.

461
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm not used to it.

462
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,020
Where's the guy?

463
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,980
Who are you playing now, BP?

464
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,040
I'm on Zangief.

465
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,860
No, no, like who are you playing against?

466
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,960
Big Booty Man.

467
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,320
Oh, okay, gotcha, gotcha.

468
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,700
Big Booty Man.

469
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,940
Big Booty Man.

470
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,540
Oh shit, you got the master too.

471
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
I just saw.

472
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,820
Oh, you got the master?

473
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,260
Let's go!

474
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,820
He was struggling for that last night, but it came together.

475
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,600
Okay, nice.

476
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,760
Dude, hell yeah, dude.

477
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,840
The grind.

478
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,520
Let's go.

479
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,500
Alright.

480
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,980
You know the 10 match-up, you know what to do.

481
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,100
Brawlhalla, did you create your own club for yourself?

482
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,600
My Discord server.

483
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,820
Okay.

484
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,980
Oh yeah.

485
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,020
Oh boy.

486
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,620
Oh wow.

487
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,520
My man's cooking.

488
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,360
Yes, Chef.

489
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,210
He's burnt.

490
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,140
Nice.

491
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,180
S-Band is kind of nutty.

492
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,880
Might be good to let him wake up.

493
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,960
Block and punish.

494
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,120
Nice.

495
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,640
He was ready in the wrong way.

496
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,120
Nice.

497
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,980
Oh, this sucks!

498
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,880
Oh my goodness.

499
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:56,680
That hella worked.

500
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,640
That hella worked.

501
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,220
Yay!

502
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,300
I like how he breaks the 4th wall for a second and just points at you.

503
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,480
You got it, bro.

504
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,080
Good one.

505
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,820
That's hella cool.

506
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,900
Yeah, you can just...

507
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,400
get an actual speedy on that.

508
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,280
Yeah, trust them.

509
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,080
I think that's one of his tactics.

510
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,020
Chat's telling me.

511
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,880
Oh.

512
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,400
Oh, wow.

513
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,780
Oh, he's saving you.

514
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,280
You're good.

515
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,100
I did you a favor.

516
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,940
Ooh, that's a nice Dark Souls dodge.

517
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,820
Ooh, that's a nice Dark Souls dodge.

518
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,880
The invincibility frame.

519
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,800
He won.

520
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,940
He messed up his mash.

521
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,720
He messed up his mash.

522
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,640
But yeah, I think if you approach him, he's going to let it rip like 90% of the time.

523
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,240
he's going to let it rip like 90% of the time.

524
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,100
Ooh.

525
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,160
Ooh.

526
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,440
Ooh.

527
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,460
Ooh.

528
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,240
Ooh.

529
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,430
Oh my goodness.

530
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,370
Oh, that's cool.

531
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,490
I shouldn't have done that, but...

532
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,330
You know what?

533
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,310
Normally I roast you for your meter management, but...

534
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,490
You can roast me.

535
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,430
That was pretty bad.

536
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,750
That was pretty bad.

537
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,550
No, nothing left.

538
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,470
Yeah, that sent a message.

539
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,310
Yeah, he spewed him.

540
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,450
He won't mentally recover from that.

541
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,570
Nice.

542
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,110
Ooh, that was...

543
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,790
I like it.

544
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,590
I like the sequence.

545
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,330
Oh.

546
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,510
Yeah, punishable.

547
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,250
Yep, yep, yep.

548
00:21:59,250 --> 00:21:59,470
Nice.

549
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,990
Oh, level one.

550
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,310
Unsafe.

551
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,190
So unsafe.

552
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,070
Yay!

553
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,670
Let's go.

554
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,390
Please.

555
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,830
And I like your meter management that last round too.

556
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,510
I saw the reset with the knee.

557
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,150
Thanks.

558
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,230
Oh, but you're supposed to sandbag.

559
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,970
What happened?

560
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,390
How do I get out of here?

561
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,830
You're supposed to give up all the data.

562
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,190
How do I leave the first lobby?

563
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:27,950
What do I do?

564
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,770
You press...

565
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,250
I think you press B, right?

566
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:31,490
No?

567
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,190
Yeah, back out.

568
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,330
It says leave custom room.

569
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,150
Will that leave, like, the whole lobby?

570
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,550
That'll leave the whole thing.

571
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,150
Yeah, so what do I do?

572
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,570
Maybe go to the...

573
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,850
Maybe go to the actual selection?

574
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,850
What is it?

575
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,010
You can click on the room you're in, and then it lets you leave, I think.

576
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,130
Maybe?

577
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,270
I don't know.

578
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,330
You press X and then choose an option?

579
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,650
I actually don't remember.

580
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,570
Maybe right click?

581
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,650
Select button?

582
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,670
Ah!

583
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,470
It's select.

584
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,390
That's very unorthodox.

585
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,710
That's not very...

586
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,290
It's not very simple.

587
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,270
Alright, more Ken.

588
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,830
More Ken.

589
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,410
Fun.

590
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,410
Oh wait, I don't want to queue up.

591
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,150
Why did I queue up?

592
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,650
Winner plays Doki.

593
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,670
Let me out.

594
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,350
Let me out.

595
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,150
Let's go.

596
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,710
You got this.

597
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,720
What the fuck?

598
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,220
Wait,

599
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,690
who's who?

600
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,450
Oh, you're...

601
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,270
I was like, who am I queueing for?

602
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,990
Okay!

603
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,430
I couldn't tell.

604
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,660
Oh, mixed?

605
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,140
Okay.

606
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,720
God, he should be playing Zangief the way you're gripping him up.

607
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,560
That's

608
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,440
probably burnt.

609
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,360
Aki, clean a burn out.

610
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,060
Yep, yep.

611
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,460
That's fine.

612
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,060
Whatever.

613
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,880
Wasted that.

614
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,080
Oh my goodness.

615
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,020
That's so clean.

616
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,660
Round two.

617
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,960
That's where the gobs.

618
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,220
Oh no.

619
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,540
Okay, my door's getting knocked.

620
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,140
I'll be right back.

621
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,740
Alright.

622
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,700
Nice, good defense.

623
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,560
Hopping over.

624
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,300
He just gassed right at the end.

625
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,120
At the very end.

626
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,860
Kind of just ran into the eyes.

627
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,760
Good throw.

628
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,380
Yeah, let's stop this.

629
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,090
Yep.

630
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,470
Nice.

631
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,670
I love this.

632
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,250
Not attacking.

633
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,550
Yep, he's not attacking.

634
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,390
Let's go.

635
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,190
Oh, he won't attack Willy.

636
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,210
Oh, okay.

637
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,130
Nice escape.

638
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,690
Wait, wait, it's fine.

639
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,010
It's fine.

640
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Yep, nice.

641
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,240
It's over.

642
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,280
My god.

643
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,300
Wait, are you bullying him?

644
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,580
Yeah.

645
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,960
Sorry.

646
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,420
He blocked that with his forehead.

647
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,050
Alright.

648
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,330
Round one.

649
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,810
Fight.

650
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,030
Nice.

651
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,720
Watch the dry meter for a little bit.

652
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,820
Watch the dry meter for a little bit.

653
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,740
Watch the dry meter for a little bit.

654
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,360
Holy shit.

655
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,200
All these combos.

656
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,560
She's so cool, actually.

657
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,360
Good defense.

658
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,600
This guy.

659
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,700
He's jumping.

660
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,920
Nice gun battle.

661
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,300
Let's go.

662
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:20,940
Yep.

663
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,570
That's my gun.

664
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,590
That's my gun.

665
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:28,930
That's so good.

666
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,710
That's how you're actually supposed to play the game.

667
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:34,930
Yeah.

668
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,650
He's getting ready.

669
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,590
Yep.

670
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,890
Nice save jump.

671
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,150
And the block.

672
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,870
Poison frog punish.

673
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,390
He's dead.

674
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,030
Highlight reel.

675
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,750
That was it.

676
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,110
My bad.

677
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,150
Anyway.

678
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:54,970
Nice.

679
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,190
Well played.

680
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,630
Yo, that reset was fucking cheeky, dude.

681
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,090
Yeah.

682
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:02,830
That was awesome.

683
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,810
That was mean, almost.

684
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,990
Does that mean coaches have to play next?

685
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,570
Oh, yeah.

686
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,630
Oh, okay.

687
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,250
But even if this was Sunday, they'd have to play since it was 2-2 anyways.

688
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,250
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,130
I'm nervous because I like his content.

690
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,910
I love your content, bro.

691
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,010
Cause me.

692
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,110
I'm not.

693
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:25,950
That's it.

694
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,410
He doesn't like you anymore.

695
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,830
I'm sorry.

696
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,350
Not after you did that opening.

697
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,150
He's gonna download you now.

698
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,170
You gotta hit select to leave that slot.

699
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:38,810
Oh.

700
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,890
How do I do that?

701
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,190
Yeah, it's not intuitive at all.

702
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,490
They're waiting on you.

703
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,910
My bad.

704
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,390
This guy is my rank against a legend.

705
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,250
Legend 97?

706
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,850
There's numbers?

707
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,530
A little bit of confidence.

708
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,710
No, you got this.

709
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,550
Coach, you got this, bro.

710
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,790
You can have him.

711
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,130
I didn't even realize there were numbers.

712
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,850
Let's go, dad.

713
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:05,770
Let's go, dad.

714
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,470
Uncle?

715
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:07,670
Uncle Brian?

716
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,310
What is it?

717
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:08,750
Theo Brian?

718
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,330
Theo.

719
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,610
Theo Brian?

720
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,250
Wait, I gotta spectate.

721
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,630
This game sucks.

722
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,330
There you go.

723
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,310
The parry.

724
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,190
Ooh, three hits.

725
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:36,510
Nice.

726
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,310
Oh, that slide.

727
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,690
It's happening so fast.

728
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,450
Nah, this character, Rashid, is a problem.

729
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,990
Yeah, I know.

730
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,070
I fought one and Brian was like, yeah, welcome to Rashid.

731
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,510
Yeah, he was never minus.

732
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,110
I can barely comprehend what's going on.

733
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,210
It's so fucking fast.

734
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,830
This game is so fast.

735
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,510
Aren't.

736
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,810
In the corner.

737
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,310
I miss fashioning.

738
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,290
Rashid is so bullshit, dude.

739
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,310
That is such bullshit.

740
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,450
Oh, my God.

741
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:10,990
You got Rashid.

742
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,250
What's

743
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,280
going on?

744
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,400
He's just spinning.

745
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,840
Oh, my God.

746
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,300
You got

747
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,860
that?

748
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,420
Nice.

749
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,240
Oh, my God.

750
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,660
Rashid's good and JB's cracked.

751
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,920
He's been cracked for years.

752
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,500
I gotta win the first round.

753
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,240
Once he gets to level two, that's when it's like...

754
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,940
Brawl pros left the room again.

755
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,700
Why are they doing that?

756
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,980
SK got left out, too.

757
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Wait, I'll see you.

758
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,700
I got left out.

759
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,560
They're like, this team's over.

760
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,800
Let me see if I can just watch Brian.

761
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,620
Just the stream, yeah.

762
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,140
Yeah.

763
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,440
He's kicking everyone out.

764
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,800
The perfect carry.

765
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,520
God, this is...

766
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,180
This is so...

767
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,920
What do you even do?

768
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,860
My eyes are just cross-eyed just watching this.

769
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,740
There's too many...

770
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,700
It's just so fast.

771
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,280
Yeah.

772
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,340
There's people moving in, so my dog's hearing in.

773
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,180
He's like, who the fuck are these people outside?

774
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,960
The puppy.

775
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,740
God, here we go.

776
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,340
Time to play the mini-game here.

777
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,160
This is the greatest level two in the game.

778
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,020
Yep.

779
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,360
It has some, too, actually.

780
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,940
Oh my gosh.

781
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,480
Racist storm.

782
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,540
Oh my god.

783
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,320
Oh, that fucking level two, dude.

784
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,720
You gotta win the first round.

785
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,100
Good try, Brian.

786
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,860
Good try, man.

787
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,360
I forgot how round robin works.

788
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,980
Do we get points for each person that wins a round, or just the team winning the round?

789
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,020
I think a match.

790
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,480
So every player that wins a team has points.

791
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,140
Plus one?

792
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:37,900
Oh, okay.

793
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,360
So that's a plus one for every...

794
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
I don't remember.

795
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,060
It's been a while.

796
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,780
I think everyone who gets points counts, right?

797
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,720
We don't have to win the whole thing.

798
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,200
Yeah.

799
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,220
What matters is Sunday.

800
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,940
Well, I mean, the seeding is important, too.

801
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,120
I guess.

802
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,260
But, like, as long as we do well in round robin, too, right guys?

803
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,980
So the seeding gives you a buy?

804
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,360
Is that the point?

805
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,620
If you're in the top two teams, you get the buy.

806
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,060
I think it's not guaranteed, but it helps, I think, is what he said.

807
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:12,820
Oh, it definitely helps.

808
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,300
It does, so you don't have to play too many games.

809
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,040
Well, like, I don't know if top two is guaranteed.

810
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,200
I don't know.

811
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,840
It's something that Sajam said about it.

812
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,880
Not guaranteeing it, but it helps.

813
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,480
I don't know what he meant.

814
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,420
Or if I misunderstood.

815
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,740
He said we're doing something extra, too, on Sunday.

816
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,300
I don't know.

817
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,800
In the orientation, he mentioned something.

818
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,040
Oh, I was playing my ranked game.

819
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,780
I was not paying attention to the orientation.

820
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,060
I was hoping you guys were paying attention for me.

821
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,260
Was that all for that one?

822
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,860
Yeah, we're done with that team.

823
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,240
Now we're moving on to the next one.

824
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,400
Okay, guys, I took off the King mod.

825
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,180
I should be a little bit better now.

826
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,340
That's why that's exactly what it was.

827
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,660
Good stuff.

828
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,280
Dude, Espen does not play like a goal.

829
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,920
That rank was throwing me off.

830
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,260
He was getting coached by J1 yesterday, I think.

831
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,900
Yeah, Espen has that old school awareness.

832
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,940
He does some weird stuff, but his decision making is still pretty good.

833
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,940
Reminds me of Brazilian walk by Candice.

834
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,320
Kind of, yeah.

835
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,240
It's both kind of crunchy, but still good.

836
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,180
Yeah, it's like, how are you hitting me?

837
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,780
That type of gameplay.

838
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,320
But it works.

839
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,140
It just works.

840
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,560
So, who do we play next?

841
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,640
There was a bracket somewhere.

842
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,440
It's Dia.

843
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,600
Is it Dia?

844
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,800
Where are you playing?

845
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,660
Diaphone.

846
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,900
Yeah, Diaphone.

847
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,440
What did you say?

848
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,120
Dia.

849
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,680
Oh, Dia.

850
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,000
I thought you said Quesadilla for a second.

851
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,260
Diaphone?

852
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,020
Yeah, isn't Diaphone our next matchup?

853
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,180
Yeah.

854
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:08,260
I think, for me, I realized because in Tekken, I could get backseated, but Street Fighter, I get way too overwhelmed if I get backseated too hard.

855
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,120
Like I said, whatever style you want, if you just want some feedback, maybe be in between games.

856
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,700
Yeah, maybe in between matches.

857
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,760
This one, I have to think too much, and I get so overwhelmed.

858
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,660
Yeah, so whatever kind of feedback you want, just let us know.

859
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,040
Oh, you have to fight PDX.

860
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,780
Oh, the runback!

861
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's the runback.

862
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
It's gonna be a runback, dude.

863
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,900
Oh, man.

864
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,980
Alright, I'm ready.

865
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,900
You're fighting Sykkuno, Doki.

866
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,300
The thing is, I've matched up against him like twice in rank, but like, I don't know.

867
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:56,300
It's different when, because I'm playing, when I play off-stream, it's easier, but when you're streaming in a tournament, it's, my mind goes...

868
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,260
The nerves get kicking.

869
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,040
Yeah, yeah.

870
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,600
Because like, during off-stream rank, it was fine playing against Sykkuno, but then like, I don't know.

871
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,260
I'm not doing the things I should be doing.

872
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,040
Yeah.

873
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,440
Yeah, in tournament, you kind of have to just be able to just autopilot almost.

874
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:19,600
I'm kind of afraid of box-to-box a little bit, but I did beat him in ranked, but I don't know.

875
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,320
He's just wild.

876
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,200
He's solid.

877
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,840
I was pretty impressed with his gameplay.

878
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,560
They did some kind of Pax West thing, Justin Wong.

879
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:28,740
Yeah.

880
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,380
Yeah.

881
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,280
He cannot get, like, his anti, I can't jump at him.

882
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,600
Yeah, he can't jump.

883
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,560
He can't really random DI.

884
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,840
Are you just waiting?

885
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,260
Are your games done, or are you still going?

886
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,140
I'm gonna check if the mod's off.

887
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,000
Okay.

888
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,480
Okay.

889
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,280
I installed the mod.

890
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,140
So I guess the columns are the stages, so we'll be in stage one coming up.

891
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,060
Oh, I see, I see.

892
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,820
I think that's what they're trying to do.

893
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,060
I think so.

894
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,340
That's way more before and like previously.

895
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,880
We didn't even know until later.

896
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,080
Stage one.

897
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,940
I guess Team Diathlon is still playing.

898
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,840
How did JB do at EVO?

899
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,800
He got top 64, maybe?

900
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,240
Oh, really?

901
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,280
You gotta understand with Street Fighter, you can't look at any one tournament.

902
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,240
JB also went super far at the Capcom Cup LCQ.

903
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,300
He beat the best player there twice.

904
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:44,700
But then, there's two more international players and too much talent to even look at one tournament.

905
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,220
Like Daigo ate shit at EVO.

906
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,700
A bunch of people eat shit at EVO.

907
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:56,160
Street Fighter, there's so many high-level players from the entire planet going to these tournaments.

908
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,760
It's a first-to-two game in a game that shouldn't be first-to-two.

909
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,100
So it's super volatile.

910
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,900
That's so crazy to me still.

911
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,680
But JB's pretty Capcom Cup and stuff.

912
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,420
Yeah, I don't understand why it's first-to-two.

913
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,820
This shit ends instantly.

914
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,980
Oh my gosh.

915
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,380
Yeah, that game was so fast.

916
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,240
The coach game...

917
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,680
Yeah, when it's optimized...

918
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,160
I close my eyes and then I open and then the game's over.

919
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,040
Rashid can rush down like fucking crazy.

920
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,240
So what do you do against that character?

921
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,680
That character seems a little crazy.

922
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,500
Boy, don't ask me.

923
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,120
I don't fucking know.

924
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,300
That character's a problem.

925
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,880
I think he's the best in the game right now.

926
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,000
Yeah.

927
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,380
At actual high level against Rashid, you are in the vortex.

928
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,660
And then you just have to... if he gets level two, you just can't do anything.

929
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,460
That's the problem.

930
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,940
So he won the first round and then he got level two, then I couldn't play.

931
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,980
That's just how it goes.

932
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:02,160
You kind of have to win the first round and then lose the second round and force him to pop level two and then win the third.

933
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,500
Did you analyze the Evo Grands?

934
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,400
How Punk... what he did against the... I'm so curious of what you could do against that.

935
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,200
Well, Punk is...

936
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,000
Well, Cammy is different too.

937
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,680
Cammy has a lot more ways to approach but Punk is inhuman.

938
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,520
Like...

939
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,660
His footsie game is just... no one on the planet has level footsies.

940
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,560
And he gets right a lot.

941
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,280
He did a lot of wake up OD divekicks so you can avoid the throw loop pressure with jump forward into a divekick.

942
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,300
So if they go for a throw loop, you're in the air and then you punish them.

943
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,680
They were both doing that a bunch of each other.

944
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,100
He did win with a jump in also.

945
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,900
That was a funny jump in.

946
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,200
After all that, it just comes down to regular ass jump ins.

947
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,080
I do think that the Grand Finals don't they play a lot together?

948
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,980
They're like really good friends or something so they play a lot.

949
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,700
Who?

950
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,200
In the Grand Finals I think it was Angry Bird and Punk.

951
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,980
Punk and Big Bird.

952
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,860
Yeah, I mean they played a bunch.

953
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,120
I mean they're from UAE though.

954
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,400
They don't play online on the regular.

955
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,300
Oh yeah, that's right.

956
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,860
But they've definitely played a lot.

957
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,620
Normally Punk always beats Big Bird.

958
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,660
Like, the fact that he got it so close was kind of big for Big Bird.

959
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,560
Hmm.

960
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,220
Yeah, but the birds Angry Bird and Big Bird, they're both fucking cracked.

961
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,700
They're probably getting the...

962
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,840
Yeah, I'm watching the iPhone stream.

963
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,640
They're not in a match.

964
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,340
Oh, okay.

965
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,080
We're in stage one.

966
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,140
Yeah.

967
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,560
Alright.

968
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:40,780
Okay.

969
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,580
We're up.

970
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,120
I think they signed me Oh, I just got it.

971
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,060
I just got it.

972
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,360
Guys, chat remember if I lose every game, Jwon coached me.

973
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,340
Let's blame Justin.

974
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,900
Blame Justin.

975
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,400
That's why she had two coaches.

976
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,020
Definitely not me.

977
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,860
No, no, no, no.

978
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,820
If I win, Brian coached me.

979
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,560
If I lose, Jwon coached me.

980
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,360
Exactly.

981
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,800
Nobody mastering option selects Doki.

982
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,640
God, you're crap.

983
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,020
There we go.

984
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,020
Angry and Big Bird aren't the only birds that are cracked at this game.

985
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,360
Damn.

986
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,700
I like that instant P player one pick.

987
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,280
Hell yeah.

988
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,120
Instantly.

989
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,260
Frame one.

990
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,900
Dude, that execution was nuts.

991
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,100
I don't understand.

992
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,720
Even if it's 2D, why can't we...

993
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,360
Do you play on Baderon?

994
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,620
Yeah.

995
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,340
Why can't they mirror it?

996
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,920
It's very the same thing anyway.

997
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,080
I think she's leverless.

998
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,260
I'm leverless.

999
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,780
Leverless.

1000
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:02,240
This is like the third time I've heard since this has started, like Tekken players complaining about mirroring in Street Fighter.

1001
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,060
Tekken players love to complain, dude.

1002
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,620
Just learn the other side.

1003
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,760
No, I just love to complain in general.

1004
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,340
Shaking fists at Cloud right now.

1005
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,300
Learn player two.

1006
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,940
I just like to complain overall.

1007
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,340
But that shit matters in Tekken.

1008
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,640
Like, that matters a lot actually.

1009
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,880
I learned like a little bit of Paul on player one side and I got put to player two side one time and I didn't know anything.

1010
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,260
Yeah.

1011
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,040
That's when you go for the two grab.

1012
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,240
Easy.

1013
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,360
Literally everything went out the window.

1014
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,380
The generic two grab.

1015
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:34,980
Yeah.

1016
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,440
Or I would do that grab on...

1017
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,420
Is that the sides flop grab?

1018
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,360
I would do that on accident and I'd be like, I just fucking threw the game.

1019
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,920
It's over.

1020
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,260
Can we quit?

1021
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:50,980
He's trolling.

1022
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,360
He's trolling.

1023
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,360
Nice.

1024
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:53,960
Okay.

1025
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,720
We're stage one.

1026
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,500
I'm calling heads.

1027
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,840
Heads.

1028
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,340
Heads?

1029
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,660
I call it now.

1030
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,140
You should say, you should really mix them up and say like, hails.

1031
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,060
Just to see what they would do.

1032
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,380
He's just trying to sabotage you.

1033
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,620
Because he's heard the rumors.

1034
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,800
That I can't play rumors.

1035
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,960
I was very loud and proud that I can't play rumors.

1036
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,900
He's flipping.

1037
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,720
I'm flipping.

1038
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,780
Damn you got it.

1039
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,620
Another one.

1040
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,180
Let's go.

1041
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,820
Wow.

1042
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,220
Oh god this is the amor fucking love you.

1043
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,840
Good luck SK.

1044
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,380
Y'all got me right team.

1045
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,380
I got you.

1046
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:51,840
I got you.

1047
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,580
You're Sykkuno.

1048
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,240
I have to play Super Show.

1049
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,260
Cause he just.

1050
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,260
Alright.

1051
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,700
I think he knows too cause like, I've been grabbing him all day.

1052
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
So he's mad.

1053
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,780
Grab him.

1054
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,820
Some more dude.

1055
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,220
Nice.

1056
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,920
Movement.

1057
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,420
Oh.

1058
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,340
My respect hitting.

1059
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,660
God damn stream lighter.

1060
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,760
Awe.

1061
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,600
Didn't get the.

1062
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,300
Sorry my dog.

1063
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,260
That dog's hyping you up.

1064
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,900
It's your hype man.

1065
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,180
You're good.

1066
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,120
People there's somebody moving.

1067
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,620
Nice.

1068
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,240
Grab out of the DI.

1069
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:41,840
Let's go.

1070
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,400
Nice.

1071
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,120
Aw.

1072
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,480
Oh get him.

1073
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:49,900
Yes.

1074
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,840
Yes sir.

1075
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,220
Nice.

1076
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,900
Doki please stop biking.

1077
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,240
Stop biking.

1078
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,580
He's hype about the geese.

1079
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,620
He's hype yeah dude.

1080
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,280
Your dog's a grappler man too.

1081
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,340
Stop biking.

1082
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,640
Oh my goodness.

1083
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,080
Oh shit.

1084
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,760
I think that hits me.

1085
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,020
Please.

1086
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,940
Get focused.

1087
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,120
Please.

1088
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,500
Continuing mission.

1089
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:18,840
Oh shit.

1090
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,940
I don't get serious.

1091
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,860
No.

1092
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,460
That's clean.

1093
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,440
Let's go my loyal fans.

1094
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,020
Please.

1095
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,960
Get the first people moving.

1096
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,440
Stop.

1097
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:38,820
Nice.

1098
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,220
One more.

1099
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,100
Oh.

1100
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,400
Oh.

1101
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,460
That was clutch.

1102
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,060
This is crazy.

1103
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,120
How did you have the instinct?

1104
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,980
You might not know what you just did Doki.

1105
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:58,460
I don't know.

1106
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,900
I don't know what I did.

1107
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,000
You were playing Tekken right there.

1108
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,040
I don't know.

1109
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,140
I don't know what I did.

1110
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,680
I don't know.

1111
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,760
I don't know what I did.

1112
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,740
Just unleash the demons Doki.

1113
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,200
Get going.

1114
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,080
Oh shit.

1115
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,820
I don't know.

1116
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:18,860
That's a Doki Zeme dude.

1117
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,680
Hell yeah.

1118
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,940
Oh my.

1119
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,980
Oh she knows.

1120
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,200
No he put me on the other side.

1121
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,320
He actually knows.

1122
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,220
Keep him there.

1123
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,340
Nice.

1124
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:39,940
Nice.

1125
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,200
Here we go.

1126
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:40,920
Yeehaw.

1127
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,920
The Doki Zeme.

1128
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,580
The Doki Zeme dude.

1129
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,320
Oh, here we go.

1130
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,460
Let's go!

1131
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,280
Bro, that freeze frame with the...

1132
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,220
Dude, Sykkuno's kind of blessing us by playing Cammy.

1133
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,420
I like this matchup.

1134
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,600
I like this matchup.

1135
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:07,780
Okay!

1136
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,660
3-0'd!

1137
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,880
I fucked it in three times!

1138
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,900
Okay, I know I can beat Sykkuno at least.

1139
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,320
Doki, every time you do level three, just shout, my loyal fans.

1140
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,800
Even with my dog debuff.

1141
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,280
I think he buffed you out.

1142
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,420
I'm thinking the same.

1143
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,090
That duck was crazy.

1144
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,740
Alright, SK, you got this.

1145
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,380
Oh, you're right, Justin.

1146
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:43,860
I can't believe it.

1147
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,860
I'm playing you right now.

1148
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,440
Thank you, Brydie, for the win, though.

1149
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,820
I'm gonna cheese her out in some way.

1150
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,920
I feel like Jory's the best pick.

1151
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,200
SK, do you want... Oh, okay.

1152
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:56,840
Flip a coin.

1153
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,180
Flip a coin?

1154
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,480
Dude, I'm down.

1155
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,420
I want P2, but...

1156
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,700
You want P2, but...

1157
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,940
I wanna flip a coin anyway.

1158
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,300
Flip a coin.

1159
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:09,540
Flip a coin.

1160
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,620
He wants to do it for fun.

1161
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,200
Okay, fair enough.

1162
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,140
Yeah, just for fun.

1163
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,400
Yo, you got it!

1164
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,580
Okay, I pick P2.

1165
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,020
Nice.

1166
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:19,960
P2?

1167
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,200
What a waste of resources.

1168
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,740
Oh, yeah, dude, seriously.

1169
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:24,940
You freak.

1170
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,280
Who the fuck really thinks P2?

1171
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,280
Okay,

1172
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,120
I got my one win.

1173
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:36,820
Now I can...

1174
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,240
Now I don't have to try anymore.

1175
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,040
I gotta run to the bathroom.

1176
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,800
Before my match, I'll be right back.

1177
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,880
That was my entire goal for today.

1178
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,360
Just win one game.

1179
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,580
That's mine, too.

1180
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,080
That's mine, too.

1181
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,940
My goal.

1182
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,480
You guys got it.

1183
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,000
Gotta do this.

1184
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:56,820
Come on.

1185
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Time to play.

1186
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,120
Round one.

1187
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,620
Oh, no.

1188
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,560
What?

1189
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,460
She has those.

1190
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,980
It says what?

1191
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,120
She's got the DI reactions.

1192
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,620
Oh.

1193
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,800
There you go.

1194
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,920
Really good throw.

1195
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,520
Yup.

1196
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,360
Let's go!

1197
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:24,940
Oh, nice!

1198
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,740
And the combo.

1199
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,940
What's the team winning?

1200
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,440
Let's go!

1201
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:33,980
Oh!

1202
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,700
No, no, no, no!

1203
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,160
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1204
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,500
Composure, composure.

1205
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,320
You got this.

1206
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,560
No!

1207
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,460
Okay, the two grabs is plus.

1208
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,960
No!

1209
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,420
Oh, it's almost.

1210
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,380
I can win.

1211
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,080
Nice.

1212
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,020
Good punish.

1213
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,840
Oh, the reaction.

1214
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,800
Oh, good DP.

1215
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,620
Oh, yeah.

1216
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,980
Oh, fee entry.

1217
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,160
Nice combo.

1218
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,040
Oh.

1219
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,260
You're in there, you're in there.

1220
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:23,680
Yeah.

1221
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,700
If you win this, it means your true rank is plat.

1222
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,380
True.

1223
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah, exactly.

1224
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,440
Let's go.

1225
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:38,840
Nice.

1226
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,360
Oh!

1227
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,260
You're just as good as a plat player!

1228
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,080
Let's go, let's go.

1229
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:43,960
Let's go.

1230
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,140
Let's go.

1231
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,600
Okay.

1232
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,350
Oh, I'm just gonna load this up.

1233
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,220
Oh, no!

1234
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:06,940
Okay.

1235
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,280
Oh, no!

1236
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,720
Okay, but they're burnt out, too.

1237
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,180
Okay.

1238
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,270
Nice.

1239
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,430
You're still in this.

1240
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:21,990
You're still in this.

1241
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,630
Oh!

1242
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:26,210
Whoa!

1243
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,290
What the fuck was that?

1244
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:29,850
Oh, get him!

1245
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,370
Nice.

1246
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,030
Get him!

1247
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:34,290
Oh, my.

1248
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:35,530
No!

1249
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:37,430
Yeah!

1250
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,430
Holy shit!

1251
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,410
What a combat!

1252
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:42,350
Holy shit!

1253
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,570
Let's go!

1254
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:43,870
Let's go!

1255
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:44,310
You're cracked!

1256
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:44,970
Let's go!

1257
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,950
Oh, my God!

1258
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,590
The comeback was insane!

1259
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,250
Let's go!

1260
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,470
Let's go!

1261
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:50,590
Let's go!

1262
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:51,490
Magic pixel is real.

1263
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,060
Let's go!

1264
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:57,800
Get it?

1265
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:57,960
Yeah!

1266
00:51:59,100 --> 00:51:59,580
That was sick!

1267
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,510
She's such a gamer, dude.

1268
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:09,270
Nice.

1269
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:09,670
Nice.

1270
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:10,050
Really good.

1271
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:15,950
Nice.

1272
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,630
Nice.

1273
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,910
That's a nice hit.

1274
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:21,110
Nice.

1275
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:21,330
Full combo.

1276
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:22,310
Nice.

1277
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:23,490
Oh, my God.

1278
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:26,870
Silver play?

1279
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,730
Who knows combos?

1280
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:28,710
Oh, okay.

1281
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:28,990
Okay.

1282
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:29,250
That's fine.

1283
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:29,810
Okay.

1284
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,710
That was good by her.

1285
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:31,890
Oh.

1286
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:33,830
Oh, that was crazy.

1287
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,610
Oh, I'm the one burnt out.

1288
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,770
Oh, you looked at the wrong bar?

1289
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:38,450
Yeah.

1290
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,590
That was kind of scrambly.

1291
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,870
I get confused, too, all the time.

1292
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:45,330
Sometimes.

1293
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,020
Wait.

1294
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,000
Is this the second round?

1295
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,300
Or is it the third?

1296
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:56,500
Yeah.

1297
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:56,940
Okay.

1298
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,940
I lost count.

1299
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,980
It's 1-0, right?

1300
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:00,940
Yeah.

1301
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:01,480
1-0.

1302
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:01,620
Okay.

1303
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,680
The games are going by too fast.

1304
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,630
Oh, you can't react in that move.

1305
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:13,650
Yeah.

1306
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:14,990
She'll always...

1307
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,010
She's spamming that.

1308
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,690
So, if you jump over her, she's gonna do that.

1309
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:19,390
So, just do it.

1310
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:21,630
You can jump over or also just wait.

1311
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:22,850
Like, all she's doing is doing...

1312
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,130
And what's the big reward?

1313
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,250
Big reward is just to do it back.

1314
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:27,390
Yeah.

1315
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:27,630
Yeah.

1316
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:27,870
Yeah.

1317
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,350
You can probably grab more, too.

1318
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:29,710
To be honest.

1319
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:31,310
That, too.

1320
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:31,810
Grab can work.

1321
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,030
And also, if you just wait.

1322
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,370
Like, I would just wait a little bit.

1323
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:34,970
Okay.

1324
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:35,350
Okay.

1325
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,270
Like, don't always take your turn back.

1326
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,070
She's just gonna do DI right after.

1327
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:49,420
Okay.

1328
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:49,820
Okay.

1329
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:53,970
Okay.

1330
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:54,650
Okay.

1331
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:55,610
Okay.

1332
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,350
Okay.

1333
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:56,650
Okay.

1334
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:57,310
Okay.

1335
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:57,930
Okay.

1336
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:58,010
Okay.

1337
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:58,410
Okay.

1338
00:53:58,410 --> 00:53:58,750
Okay.

1339
00:53:59,150 --> 00:53:59,510
Okay.

1340
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:00,930
Okay.

1341
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:03,770
Okay.

1342
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,970
Just block a little and then do the DI.

1343
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:14,910
When she does how's this, you can DI that, like, one, two, how's this, I think.

1344
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:15,450
Right?

1345
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,770
Do better next time.

1346
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,130
Yeah.

1347
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:18,270
Yeah.

1348
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:24,870
But, I mean, in general, like, the game plan should be block her sequence and then wait for the DI.

1349
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:25,510
Get her.

1350
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,030
Nice.

1351
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:27,390
Oh, nice.

1352
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,010
Nice.

1353
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:34,680
Okay.

1354
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,060
Oh, get her.

1355
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,280
Good block.

1356
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,520
Good punish, too.

1357
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:39,860
Oh.

1358
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,100
Nice.

1359
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:40,940
That was good.

1360
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:41,360
That was good.

1361
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:42,520
Let's go.

1362
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:42,800
Oh.

1363
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,400
You're good.

1364
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:44,660
You're good.

1365
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:44,920
Don't worry.

1366
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,360
Nice.

1367
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,840
That was fucking clean.

1368
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:49,720
Let's go.

1369
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,580
Win a ball.

1370
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:50,900
Keep it up.

1371
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:02,390
Okay.

1372
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:02,810
Okay.

1373
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,350
I like that.

1374
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:06,490
Ooh.

1375
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:08,830
Nice.

1376
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:09,050
She's tired.

1377
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:09,150
Yeah.

1378
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:10,010
She's jumping a lot.

1379
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:11,650
Yep.

1380
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,090
Ooh.

1381
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,230
I kind of like that, though.

1382
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:14,050
I don't know.

1383
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:14,330
Yeah.

1384
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:14,890
That's kind of sick.

1385
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:15,670
Nice.

1386
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:16,070
Nice.

1387
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:16,570
Yeah.

1388
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,470
She's just going to DI.

1389
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,030
So.

1390
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:19,910
Oh.

1391
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:20,670
Oh.

1392
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:21,150
That's okay.

1393
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,930
Okay.

1394
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,440
You also used your super.

1395
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,760
Okay.

1396
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,160
Nice.

1397
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,060
Oh, fuck.

1398
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,140
Good try.

1399
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:41,480
Good try.

1400
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,260
Oh.

1401
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,340
Nice try.

1402
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:44,960
Nice try.

1403
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:45,640
Yeah.

1404
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,280
You wanted to level three.

1405
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:46,420
Yeah.

1406
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:46,620
Yeah.

1407
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:46,820
Yeah.

1408
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,360
That was smart.

1409
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,620
That matchup was very doable for you, SK.

1410
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,380
Yeah.

1411
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,740
You can definitely win this.

1412
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,140
Yeah.

1413
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:53,660
On Friday.

1414
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:54,880
Oh, absolutely.

1415
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:55,700
Yeah.

1416
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,240
And you swapped mains, so then you had less time to learn, too.

1417
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,600
Versus Amore.

1418
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:00,640
True.

1419
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:00,720
True.

1420
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,880
And my character's low tier, and like, hers is top one.

1421
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,480
Jury's low tier.

1422
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,620
I see so many.

1423
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,200
There's no fucking way the amount of juries I see.

1424
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:10,600
No, no.

1425
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,140
She's bottom one.

1426
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:11,940
She's bottom one.

1427
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,900
She's bottom one.

1428
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,280
Not absolutely.

1429
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,460
Are you fucking kidding me?

1430
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:15,900
I agree.

1431
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,740
I see so many juries.

1432
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,480
No, but that's not because she's good.

1433
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,860
That's because people are degenerate.

1434
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,360
Are freaks?

1435
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:22,680
Yeah.

1436
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,740
No, I get it.

1437
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,440
Freaky, dude.

1438
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,100
Yeah.

1439
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,580
Juries never won a tournament, so...

1440
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:29,880
True.

1441
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:30,640
In tournaments?

1442
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,120
Yeah.

1443
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,300
Oh shit.

1444
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,060
It's brawl pro time.

1445
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,780
That's a lot of degenerates.

1446
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,220
Jeez.

1447
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,420
All right.

1448
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:35,800
Here we go.

1449
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,740
This is a match of all time right here.

1450
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,640
Oh, the run back.

1451
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:45,110
Fuck.

1452
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:45,510
Okay.

1453
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,210
Speed time.

1454
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:48,450
Nice.

1455
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:49,270
Ooh.

1456
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,600
Mash and throw, huh?

1457
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,200
Yeah.

1458
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,360
Yeah.

1459
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:02,700
Yeah.

1460
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,040
Ooh.

1461
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,220
Nice.

1462
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,140
Here we go.

1463
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,540
Oh, come on.

1464
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,060
If I can...

1465
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,720
If I beat a Cammy, you should be able to beat a Cammy.

1466
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,860
Wait for it.

1467
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,140
Hold on.

1468
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,360
Oh.

1469
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:21,980
Nice.

1470
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,400
Are you alive?

1471
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay.

1472
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,300
Okay.

1473
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,460
Okay.

1474
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:23,600
Okay.

1475
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,380
I was going to say, I don't think he's alive.

1476
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:26,820
Dude.

1477
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,880
Keeper's kind of a tank, but...

1478
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,860
Not that tanky.

1479
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:31,880
Yeah.

1480
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:32,380
Yeah.

1481
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:32,460
Yeah.

1482
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:32,480
Yeah.

1483
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:32,560
Yeah.

1484
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,580
Oh, nice.

1485
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,700
Oh, these combos are clean.

1486
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,280
Yep.

1487
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:44,720
Here we go.

1488
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,040
Ooh.

1489
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,700
Oh, my God.

1490
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:52,800
Magna hands.

1491
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,400
Down, down.

1492
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:53,900
Jeez.

1493
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,020
Oh, my God.

1494
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,100
That's catching me.

1495
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,700
That low.

1496
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,280
Yeah.

1497
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:00,880
That was gameplay.

1498
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,120
Is that a kill?

1499
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:01,840
Yeah.

1500
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,320
You're alive.

1501
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:02,640
Yeah.

1502
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:02,960
Slow forward drive rush.

1503
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,440
I'll watch out for that.

1504
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:03,500
Slow forward drive rush.

1505
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,060
I'll watch out for that.

1506
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,080
Slow forward drive rush.

1507
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,740
And she's burnt.

1508
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,700
So, no meter.

1509
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,600
You're in a good spot.

1510
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:07,880
All right.

1511
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,260
Here we go.

1512
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,000
He knows about your move.

1513
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:14,800
You do it too much.

1514
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,060
Oh, my God.

1515
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:16,620
Oh.

1516
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,440
Nice.

1517
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:18,380
Brother.

1518
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,580
Oh, that was sick, actually.

1519
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,560
That was really good.

1520
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,080
I can't believe that reached.

1521
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:32,830
Uh-huh.

1522
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,050
Oh.

1523
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,190
Nice.

1524
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:37,730
Yeehaw.

1525
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:38,190
Yeehaw.

1526
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:38,430
Oh.

1527
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:39,650
My little friend.

1528
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:39,950
My little friend.

1529
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:40,070
My little friend.

1530
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,250
Oh, that was good.

1531
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,470
This is your last ride.

1532
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:43,610
Nice.

1533
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,710
What the hell?

1534
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:50,290
Oh, whoa.

1535
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,650
Damn.

1536
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:52,730
He's burnt, though.

1537
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,370
It's all good.

1538
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:57,250
Dead.

1539
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:57,850
Nice.

1540
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:58,950
Oh, my God.

1541
00:58:59,150 --> 00:58:59,590
Dishman.

1542
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,010
Nice.

1543
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,350
Let's go.

1544
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,970
My man kept his composure, and he's looking good today.

1545
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:07,390
Look at that.

1546
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,070
That's a handsome guy.

1547
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:10,970
There's a mohawk right there.

1548
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,290
Oh my god, people are still moving.

1549
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:26,790
Is there hurt?

1550
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,210
You're just evening it out for him?

1551
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:32,630
Okay.

1552
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,270
There we go.

1553
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:33,990
Oh, he's in the corner.

1554
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:35,270
Time to play.

1555
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,000
Oh, nice empty jump.

1556
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:44,900
Okay, okay.

1557
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,440
Oh, the knee!

1558
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,600
Oh, the knee!

1559
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,220
The knee grab!

1560
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:55,940
The knee grab!

1561
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,560
His signature move.

1562
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:58,640
Nice!

1563
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,900
My man was scared, dude.

1564
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,600
Carry us in your backpack, bro.

1565
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,160
Yes.

1566
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,920
I'll sit comfortably here, dude.

1567
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,020
Let's go get him!

1568
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,400
Scramble.

1569
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,120
Scramble the eggs.

1570
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,280
Nice.

1571
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,400
The knee throw.

1572
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,300
That's so nasty.

1573
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,680
It brought him to Masters.

1574
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,540
I think he learned.

1575
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,500
Oh, unless...

1576
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,580
Oh, unless...

1577
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,640
Okay, you're alive.

1578
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:41,720
No!

1579
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,180
Oh, nice!

1580
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,440
That's a wrap!

1581
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,840
That's a wrap!

1582
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:49,760
Let's go!

1583
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,220
You know he's upset, dude.

1584
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,600
You know he's upset.

1585
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,420
I thought...

1586
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,140
I thought he might try to bait that, but...

1587
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,200
It's 2-0.

1588
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,880
He couldn't get one.

1589
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,000
Damn.

1590
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,500
Alright, time to get bodied.

1591
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:05,800
Let's go.

1592
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:07,800
You got this.

1593
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,620
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1594
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,600
Wait, who are you fighting?

1595
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,960
I don't even know who you're fighting.

1596
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,060
Box, box.

1597
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:13,900
Oh, okay.

1598
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1599
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,260
Yeah, just let...

1600
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,620
Don't do too many random DI's or anything.

1601
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,040
Oh, I don't DI like ever.

1602
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,860
I believe!

1603
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,700
But I do jump a lot.

1604
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,120
If you do the close jumps, it should be fine.

1605
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,040
It should be fine.

1606
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,840
He does like cross cuts and stuff.

1607
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,340
It's crazy.

1608
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,680
Right, right.

1609
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,540
That sounds insane.

1610
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:43,310
Round 1.

1611
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:48,450
Your MR number is higher, therefore you are better.

1612
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:50,630
Yes.

1613
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,130
I lost to an iron.

1614
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,370
On the first match.

1615
01:01:58,210 --> 01:01:59,070
Warm up game.

1616
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:00,390
That's true.

1617
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,310
I had all the D-Bus going in.

1618
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:02,950
So...

1619
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:11,500
Nice.

1620
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,180
Nice.

1621
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:21,920
Okay,

1622
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,400
I think you played with your food a bit too much.

1623
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:38,660
But...

1624
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,060
That was a scam.

1625
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:45,680
You can win.

1626
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,380
Nice.

1627
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,060
Good defense.

1628
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,520
Oh, wow.

1629
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:14,740
Oh, nice.

1630
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:15,960
Beautiful, beautiful.

1631
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:16,800
Oh, my gosh.

1632
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,240
This is intense.

1633
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,180
He dropped.

1634
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:20,920
Yeah, he's good.

1635
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,660
Oh, god.

1636
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,120
Nice break.

1637
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,560
No grab.

1638
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:32,700
Oh, nice.

1639
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,240
Yeah, that was good.

1640
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,080
Yeah, modern players, they just wait for that.

1641
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,780
Yeah, modern players are gonna do that instantly.

1642
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,020
Yep.

1643
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:44,640
Okay.

1644
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,020
That's winnable.

1645
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:48,360
I believe.

1646
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,020
ADP, the first chance he got on wake up 2, I felt like.

1647
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,020
Okay.

1648
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,000
I just thought we were in the train session, because I was like...

1649
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,120
Is this a timeout?

1650
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:04,980
Nice.

1651
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:06,460
Whoa!

1652
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,470
Oh, that wasn't a try brush.

1653
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,280
Nice challenge.

1654
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:21,880
There we go.

1655
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:22,400
Nice.

1656
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,320
Yeah, he's low.

1657
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,240
Oh, I wanted to grab it.

1658
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,320
Oh, good job.

1659
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,760
DI in the corner.

1660
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,520
And DP.

1661
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,280
Yeah, he loves that shit.

1662
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,720
He can react to the drivers with the DP.

1663
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:46,780
Nice.

1664
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,980
Oh, that was a perfect parry.

1665
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:13,560
Nice.

1666
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:14,680
Oh, nice.

1667
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:14,680
Oh,

1668
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,200
nice.

1669
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,560
Damn.

1670
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,020
Damn.

1671
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:31,220
This is such an intense matchup.

1672
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,460
Yeah, the defense is pretty good.

1673
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,900
Yeah, both sides are just defending really well.

1674
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,600
Random DI.

1675
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,000
You're alive.

1676
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,120
Nice.

1677
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,860
We have critical.

1678
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,460
Oh, nice!

1679
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,020
Oh!

1680
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:51,220
Oh!

1681
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,520
That was a good try.

1682
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,020
That was a bad drop.

1683
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,460
That's my biggest problem, dude.

1684
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,260
I drop a lot.

1685
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:00,920
I don't know.

1686
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,460
Would have level 3 worked there?

1687
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:04,920
Yeah.

1688
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,160
I could have actually killed without level 3.

1689
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,120
I was going for the big...

1690
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,840
Her stun combos are outrageously good.

1691
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:14,840
Yeah.

1692
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,700
They do a ton of damage and they set up for Oki or they kill.

1693
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,980
You know he was good.

1694
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,100
He was mashing, man.

1695
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:23,220
Yeah.

1696
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,580
That was a good try, though.

1697
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,900
He won't get so lucky next time.

1698
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,020
We haven't lost a game that I don't think we can win in...

1699
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,060
What day is it?

1700
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:32,860
In two days.

1701
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,540
Friday, yeah.

1702
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,000
When it was working, when it's obvious, I feel like it's good.

1703
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,600
For Friday, it's easy to...

1704
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,360
Because he was DP, wake up, and when you're in the corner...

1705
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,280
So that's a lot of neutral jumps.

1706
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:49,840
I think I know what to do with neutral jumps when he's neutral jumping bubble.

1707
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,820
She gets some crazy conversions.

1708
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:54,580
She's really good.

1709
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,440
She started looking up a ton of stuff.

1710
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,920
She got a lot of crazy stuff.

1711
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,340
I got some answers.

1712
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,160
I got some answers.

1713
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,800
I just can't jump at him.

1714
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,080
Yeah, we'll go over all the matches, too.

1715
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:11,900
Should be fun.

1716
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,820
I'm super down.

1717
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,460
Wait, what are the points for round one versus round two?

1718
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,260
I know round two is five, but what's round one?

1719
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,400
I think it's less points.

1720
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,780
It's like one or two points.

1721
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,140
It's three?

1722
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,040
Yeah.

1723
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,340
Let's go, coach.

1724
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,720
Coach, let's do this.

1725
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,080
Oh, he's also an Aki.

1726
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,360
Yeah, he plays...

1727
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,200
He's one of the better Akis out there.

1728
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,680
Do you watch his guides?

1729
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,560
No, I watch this guy from the UK called Broski.

1730
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,540
That's why my name is Hispanic Broski.

1731
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:50,140
Because he's considered to be one of the best Akis in the world.

1732
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:50,660
I see.

1733
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,080
Wow!

1734
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,240
He had no rank 97 bullshit.

1735
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,880
He had no legend rank.

1736
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:03,180
Legend rank is pretty much the apex predator of Street Fighter.

1737
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,260
It's like the top 500.

1738
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,920
Fucking JB, man.

1739
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,280
Nephew is up there, too, actually.

1740
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:12,800
He's like...

1741
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,320
Yeah, isn't Nephew insane, too?

1742
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:17,360
Yeah, he's one of the best juries in the world.

1743
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,200
Right behind me, of course.

1744
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,340
Right behind SK.

1745
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:24,440
Maybe you can ask Nephew to coach you.

1746
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:32,700
Just, like, stroke his ego and be like, Hey, I heard you're really, really good at Jury.

1747
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,780
I won't beat your player, don't worry.

1748
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,500
Yeah, yeah.

1749
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,900
But then if it's really fucked up, he coaches you the wrong thing.

1750
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:42,840
Just so...

1751
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,300
No, just be a double agent.

1752
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,280
Like, yeah, don't worry.

1753
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,740
I'm not gonna do anything crazy.

1754
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:53,480
Like, I just love Street Fighter so much that I wanna keep playing Jury afterwards.

1755
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,660
Nephew, you're my biggest...

1756
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,160
I'm your biggest fan, Nephew.

1757
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,320
Can you please coach me?

1758
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:03,380
I watched all your streams and YouTube videos.

1759
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,260
I'm gonna subscribe to your YouTube.

1760
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,820
I watch all your content.

1761
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,200
I'm a tier 3 subscriber on Twitch, please.

1762
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,220
Can you teach me how to play?

1763
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,560
Sorry, are we distracting you?

1764
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,120
Brian's like, these children.

1765
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:19,760
Nice.

1766
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,380
Yes!

1767
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,120
You don't make fun!

1768
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:24,680
Okay, not nice.

1769
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,700
Okay, I'm gonna stop distracting you.

1770
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,540
Three bars versus zero bars.

1771
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,500
I'll do the same to Diaphone.

1772
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,860
I'll be like, Diaphone, I've been your subscriber since...

1773
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,560
I don't know when, dude.

1774
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,000
I'm a tier 3 subscriber.

1775
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,840
I'm number one on your stream, lads.

1776
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,620
I'm a Patreon sub.

1777
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,460
This match is kind of fire, though.

1778
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:49,620
Yeah, this match is nice.

1779
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,880
Oh, the overhead.

1780
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,040
Big combo here.

1781
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:57,260
Nice!

1782
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,160
Let's go!

1783
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,280
Level 2 shenanigans?

1784
01:09:59,380 --> 01:09:59,680
Let's go!

1785
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,360
I saw that Evo!

1786
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,540
Yeah, let's go!

1787
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,460
Coach, you got those!

1788
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,960
Isn't that hard to do?

1789
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,800
Oh, she jumped out.

1790
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:09,960
Okay.

1791
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,220
Wait, it doesn't do that much damage.

1792
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:15,540
Wait, it doesn't do that much damage.

1793
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,460
It's like more corner carry than anything else.

1794
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,560
Oh, okay.

1795
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,440
I was gonna say.

1796
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,160
It looked cool, though.

1797
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,420
Oh, it's super flashy, dude.

1798
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,560
Another one!

1799
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,220
Okay, here we go.

1800
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:29,940
Almost there.

1801
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,500
Just block it.

1802
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,460
Oh, that was a good jump in, dude.

1803
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,980
Oh, he doesn't have... oh, that's death.

1804
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,520
Level 2, yeah.

1805
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,440
Oh, that was a good jump.

1806
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,760
That was a good jump.

1807
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:45,900
Yeah.

1808
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,460
That combo was sick.

1809
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:51,800
Yeah.

1810
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,180
Popcorn?

1811
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,580
What do we need?

1812
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,780
No, these guys are playing like...

1813
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,120
Playing, playing.

1814
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,360
Competitive Street Fighter is crazy, dude.

1815
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:04,520
Oh, here we go.

1816
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,180
Wow!

1817
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:20,420
Nice.

1818
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,140
Nice mash.

1819
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:27,600
Thanks.

1820
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:30,840
Woo!

1821
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,380
I can actually understand this game compared to the last one.

1822
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,940
The Rashid...

1823
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,080
When Rashid's on screen...

1824
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,480
It's like a live Twister.

1825
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,340
Oh!

1826
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,060
That was good on their part.

1827
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:45,460
That was good on their part.

1828
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,500
Yeah.

1829
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,740
I think I should have learned Rashid.

1830
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,280
Nice.

1831
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,280
Nice.

1832
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:52,840
Nice.

1833
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,120
Stand still.

1834
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,280
Stand still!

1835
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,940
I saw that clip.

1836
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,740
It was mad funny.

1837
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,040
No!

1838
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,920
Oh my god!

1839
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:01,800
Keep going!

1840
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,200
Oh, Empty Jump Low!

1841
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:03,540
Let's go!

1842
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,920
Yeah, I might have been able to kill without the Level 3, but...

1843
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,720
It's fine.

1844
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1845
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,660
It's content.

1846
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:14,420
I love that jump into the lane.

1847
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,520
That was great.

1848
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,840
Empty Jump Lows are like...

1849
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,700
Chef's kiss.

1850
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,780
As money.

1851
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:20,700
I'm deep.

1852
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,560
I don't have the best one, but...

1853
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,620
Nah, dude.

1854
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,620
You have the best one.

1855
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,760
Which is grab them.

1856
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,700
Empty Jump Grab.

1857
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:28,520
True.

1858
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,260
Eat it!

1859
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:39,940
Let's go!

1860
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,620
Oh no!

1861
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,660
It's fine.

1862
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,160
It's fine.

1863
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:42,840
You don't need it.

1864
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:44,740
It's that negative.

1865
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,660
Uh-uh-uh.

1866
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,500
Oh my god.

1867
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:51,360
We're good.

1868
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:51,560
We're good.

1869
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,380
Nice backdash.

1870
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,040
Let's go, coach!

1871
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,240
Yes!

1872
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,780
That was good.

1873
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,440
Oh, don't be mashing on me, Amigo!

1874
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:00,920
Nice!

1875
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,060
Oh my god.

1876
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,780
Let's go, dude.

1877
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,520
That's crazy.

1878
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,360
I gotta tell you, that super is one of the coolest supers ever.

1879
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,480
The Muhammad Ali, dude.

1880
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,580
For this next one, you're gonna wanna do more damage than he does to you.

1881
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:19,420
Noted.

1882
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,020
Oh, nice parry!

1883
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:26,820
Oh my god.

1884
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:28,900
He's so good.

1885
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:30,880
Punish counter.

1886
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:31,280
Let's go.

1887
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:31,740
Oh!

1888
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,900
Oh, Lupa's ass.

1889
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,000
Do it again!

1890
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,160
No, no, no.

1891
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,160
You should have...

1892
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:41,300
He'd be like, that's something a silver would do.

1893
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,480
Holy shit!

1894
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,280
Okay, that shit's crazy.

1895
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,540
I thought that was a perfect first second.

1896
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,360
Yeah, Ko, maybe you shouldn't ask him for coaching.

1897
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:50,880
Maybe...

1898
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,740
I mean...

1899
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,340
Do what you just did to him.

1900
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:00,800
Nice.

1901
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,420
Oh my god.

1902
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,440
Coach is cracked right now.

1903
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,240
Empty jump low!

1904
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,820
Oh, fuck it.

1905
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:07,080
We ball.

1906
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,280
Yo.

1907
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,540
What happened to the boss?

1908
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:10,820
Oh, no shot.

1909
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:11,880
Let's go!

1910
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:12,600
Oh!

1911
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,340
You're mine!

1912
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,120
Oh my god.

1913
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,120
We're good, we're good.

1914
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,040
Guys, I'm always...

1915
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,020
Nice break, nice defense!

1916
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,240
Guys...

1917
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,460
Let's go, let's go coach.

1918
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:28,480
What does neutral mean?

1919
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,260
Oh god.

1920
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,200
Did Justin not go over this in the...

1921
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:40,060
I was afraid to ask for a very long time, but people kept saying this to me.

1922
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,340
So you know how they're not doing anything right now?

1923
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:43,720
Yeah.

1924
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:48,440
And the first thing that they do to open the other person up is called the neutral.

1925
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,640
So right now they're playing neutral.

1926
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,000
They're trying to feel each other out.

1927
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,000
Nice!

1928
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,720
Nice neutral, man!

1929
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,520
So like, what does it mean when people say good neutral?

1930
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,300
What Brian just did.

1931
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,300
Weren't you watching?

1932
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,560
That's what Brian just did.

1933
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,580
I waited this long to ask because...

1934
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,180
Nice work.

1935
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:13,480
Nice work.

1936
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,580
Coach, Mrs. Bird needs help.

1937
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,260
That was good.

1938
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,640
What does neutral mean?

1939
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,840
Listen, Doki, for you, don't worry about it.

1940
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,320
Oh, okay.

1941
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:30,420
Like I said before, you're asking for some coaching and all that in the beginning, and I really feel like what's just not poising your mind.

1942
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,860
But people were like, wow, Doki can do some good neutral.

1943
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,080
I'm like, what does that mean?

1944
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,400
Just say thank you, and keep doing you.

1945
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,540
That's what I think.

1946
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:41,540
Okay.

1947
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,800
When you don't know what you're doing, you're doing it right.

1948
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,220
Hey guys, I have a two win streak.

1949
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:47,860
Yay.

1950
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,280
Let's go.

1951
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,240
Sweet.

1952
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,680
So we won that match.

1953
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,340
Technically speaking.

1954
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,300
Overall, right?

1955
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:57,580
3-2.

1956
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,220
Who are we fighting next?

1957
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,580
Good stuff, team.

1958
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:02,460
We're 1-1.

1959
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,160
There's good data on all these matches.

1960
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:12,340
I really feel like most of these matches, like we'll go through them, there's just tiny things for everybody we can all just tweak.

1961
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:16,260
I don't think any of these matches are a lost cause at all.

1962
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:17,400
I think they're all super close.

1963
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:21,500
We're up against Nephew next.

1964
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,200
Nephew.

1965
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,140
Who's on his team?

1966
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,700
Go to the news section, and you'll see it.

1967
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,320
It's Skara, Red, Nephew, Huntress.

1968
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:34,780
It's Skara, Red, Nephew, Huntress.

1969
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:35,460
Wait, who's their fourth?

1970
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:36,780
Wait, who's their...

1971
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,040
Lily.

1972
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,860
Yeah, I face Lily and playing Lily.

1973
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:43,440
Easy.

1974
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,260
Ross is Master's DJ.

1975
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,820
So that'll be fun.

1976
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,960
You're playing Ross?

1977
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,320
Yeah, he's a Master's DJ.

1978
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,640
Wait, where is he?

1979
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,160
Oh, gotcha, gotcha.

1980
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,340
He's a Master's DJ?

1981
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,620
We got a lot of people in second tier.

1982
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,260
Jump, jump, medium kick, and random DI.

1983
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,000
That's gonna be your way to get in.

1984
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:05,180
Okay.

1985
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,060
I'm gonna forget the headbutt, Justin.

1986
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,780
I'm gonna forget it.

1987
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,800
I'm gonna go take a quick bathroom break, guys.

1988
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,500
Good stuff.

1989
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,120
Are they done with their matches, or are they still going?

1990
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,580
Are you peeing?

1991
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:21,080
Don't pee.

1992
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,200
Hold that shit in.

1993
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,120
Hold it?

1994
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:24,600
Yeah, it works.

1995
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,460
Is this why I haven't been winning every tournament?

1996
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:29,660
I've been going to the bathroom and pissing myself?

1997
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,260
You gotta hold it in.

1998
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,300
Today's the day.

1999
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,040
And then you go.

2000
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,520
Do not do that, Brian.

2001
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,600
I'm telling you.

2002
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,080
Alright?

2003
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,160
It works.

2004
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:44,800
It actually works.

2005
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,180
It makes you concentrate more.

2006
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:46,740
Just watch.

2007
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,220
Because I know in competitive in general, it actually does work.

2008
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,880
Because you focus more.

2009
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:53,820
Yeah, yeah.

2010
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,260
It's an actual, real thing.

2011
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,040
I don't do it, but it's a real thing.

2012
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,400
It's real.

2013
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,380
Bathroom over-competitiveness for me.

2014
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,960
Nephew is playing right now.

2015
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,160
I'm actually gonna watch that.

2016
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,000
How do I watch that?

2017
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:09,560
His stream?

2018
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,180
I assume.

2019
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:11,660
Oh yeah.

2020
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,820
Oh dude, if you're in his stream, link it in the chat.

2021
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,220
It's like Nephew dork or something.

2022
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,240
It's like Nephew dork or something.

2023
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,380
Nephew dork.

2024
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,700
Oh, they just finished.

2025
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,120
Oh, they just finished?

2026
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:26,700
Yeah.

2027
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,140
Alright.

2028
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:31,440
Alright, alright.

2029
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,040
Alright, alright.

2030
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,220
That was a stream.

2031
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,640
That was a stream.

2032
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,040
13k viewers on Street Fighter 6, that's pretty good.

2033
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:45,520
13k viewers on Street Fighter 6, that's pretty good.

2034
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:49,780
13k viewers on Street Fighter 6, that's pretty good.

2035
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:52,360
Oh, Lily's back on Twitch.

2036
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:54,140
Oh, Lily's back on Twitch.

2037
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:54,260
Oh, really?

2038
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,340
I thought she was on YouTube.

2039
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,720
I didn't realize she was back on Twitch.

2040
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,860
Justin, how do I kill Lily again?

2041
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,100
Justin, how do I kill Lily again?

2042
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:02,580
I forgot.

2043
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,380
She's live right now.

2044
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,200
Oh shit, okay.

2045
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,040
Oh, wait.

2046
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:22,400
Manon is all about that command grab, right?

2047
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:23,720
Manon?

2048
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:24,580
Yeah.

2049
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,440
Careful with her burnout pressure.

2050
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,980
Getting burnout by Manon is scary.

2051
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,240
And he loves his standing medium pressure.

2052
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,240
Okay, I'm gonna jump permanently.

2053
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:35,900
Until he anti-ears me.

2054
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:37,860
Okay.

2055
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,720
Is there a way to deal with Manon burnout pressure?

2056
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,760
Like, do you get hit by it or something, maybe?

2057
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,020
Oh, did he go to the bathroom?

2058
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,240
Yeah, he did.

2059
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,340
He hasn't come back yet.

2060
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:49,580
Damn.

2061
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,500
Well, this is GG's, guys.

2062
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,280
He went to go piss.

2063
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:56,040
Dude, that Ed match was really cool.

2064
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,300
Ed is really fun in this game.

2065
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,840
In Street Fighter 5, he was...

2066
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,960
I didn't...

2067
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,960
No one liked Ed.

2068
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,760
But here, he's cool.

2069
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,600
Yeah, it's cool watching him.

2070
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,320
Oh, they tagged us.

2071
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,280
Are we done?

2072
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,380
They haven't invited us yet, though.

2073
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,140
Stage 1.

2074
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,420
Let's see.

2075
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:15,660
Hits.

2076
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,420
Yeah, no, do the coin flip.

2077
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,660
It's traditional at this point.

2078
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:27,900
Okay, just hurry up into player 1, and then if they say something, then be like, flip a coin.

2079
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,860
Yeah, but what if she gets there before me?

2080
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I'm not that fast.

2081
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,140
JK, I am.

2082
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,080
You are.

2083
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:38,820
Yeah, there you go.

2084
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,180
None of that loser mentality.

2085
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:40,960
JK.

2086
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,580
I'm in.

2087
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:47,680
I'm fucking in.

2088
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:54,170
I wonder how other people are doing this.

2089
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:54,790
Is there a score?

2090
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:55,610
Oh, there's match report.

2091
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:56,150
Okay.

2092
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:57,990
Alright.

2093
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,050
Let's see.

2094
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:06,360
I'm looking at the match report right now.

2095
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,100
Uh...

2096
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,580
This is so confusing.

2097
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,040
So many different people are in here.

2098
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,480
Wait, Fii won against Red.

2099
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,360
Fii 2-2-1 Red RiotRoss.

2100
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,080
Oh, he did?

2101
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:21,540
Yeah.

2102
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:21,860
Wow.

2103
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,400
Huntress won against BoxBox, though.

2104
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,280
Huntress is really good.

2105
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,000
Yeah.

2106
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:30,880
But, Coeficient got it.

2107
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,360
She's pretty good, though.

2108
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,520
I don't know why.

2109
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,020
She's really good.

2110
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,220
But, Coeficient is better.

2111
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,580
But, Coeficient is better.

2112
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,280
Dia lost to Nephew.

2113
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,680
Uh... Not really that surprised.

2114
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:46,420
To me.

2115
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,360
Hey, whoa.

2116
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,460
I mean, Nephew, though.

2117
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,000
I mean, Nephew, though.

2118
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,220
It is.

2119
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,640
Like, we can all agree Nephew is really good at this game.

2120
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:58,920
Yup.

2121
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:02,700
Fucking smack.

2122
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:08,850
Infer... Infer won against Huntress.

2123
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:09,270
Infer won against Huntress.

2124
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,090
Oh, wow.

2125
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:12,810
He's... Damn, dude.

2126
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:13,970
Coeficient, you got it.

2127
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:14,970
Infernasu?

2128
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:15,430
Yeah, no.

2129
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:16,370
Akuma's a...

2130
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,290
Akuma's a bitch, dude.

2131
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:20,570
Yeah, Akuma's a problem.

2132
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:22,350
Akuma's a hoe, dude.

2133
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:23,650
You lost your...

2134
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:24,930
Did I lose my coin flip?

2135
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:27,010
You lost?

2136
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,310
I lost my coin flip?

2137
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:29,390
No, I didn't.

2138
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:29,950
Watch this.

2139
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:31,230
No, I didn't.

2140
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:31,630
Watch this.

2141
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,010
What are you gonna do?

2142
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:34,230
I need to see this.

2143
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:39,570
Is he edited next to the message?

2144
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:42,690
Question mark.

2145
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:46,190
Got him.

2146
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,070
Instant DQ.

2147
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:51,950
I almost have to agree with SolidBones.

2148
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:53,050
What?

2149
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:55,690
He doesn't have proof?

2150
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,110
He doesn't have proof that he chose heads?

2151
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:00,710
Show me the mod logs.

2152
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:01,430
You won't.

2153
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:07,230
All I'm saying is that...

2154
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:09,690
Is that...

2155
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:11,010
I chose tails.

2156
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,270
Guys, I have vouchers, right?

2157
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:17,410
Does anyone want to vouch me that I chose heads?

2158
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:18,010
Or tails?

2159
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,090
Sorry, I lagged there.

2160
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:20,770
I got you.

2161
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:21,290
I got you.

2162
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:25,570
Voucher, I was...

2163
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,190
There you go.

2164
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:26,930
Yeah, I chose tails.

2165
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:30,890
SK voucher.

2166
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,090
I was the coin.

2167
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:35,550
Voucher, I was the coin.

2168
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:36,830
Shit, it was tails, bro.

2169
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:38,630
I saw that shit.

2170
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:42,050
Those who are wondering what I wrote in the discord, give me a sec.

2171
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:46,830
Guys, this is proof that I chose tails, guys.

2172
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,070
This is proof.

2173
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,750
Right here.

2174
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:58,150
See?

2175
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,050
I told you.

2176
01:23:59,070 --> 01:23:59,470
Tails.

2177
01:23:59,590 --> 01:23:59,990
Vouch.

2178
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:01,350
It's tails.

2179
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,970
It says tails right there.

2180
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,930
It says tails right there.

2181
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:07,590
It literally says it right there.

2182
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:09,150
It literally says it right there.

2183
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:13,050
Bro, just screenshot it and post it again.

2184
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,630
And just add our question mark.

2185
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:32,400
I know when they start, I'm on the Sajam stream.

2186
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,900
Stop corrupting the...

2187
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,540
I'm just telling the truth.

2188
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,780
Stop corrupting people.

2189
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,200
Are they putting us on stream again?

2190
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:42,880
Is that what's going on?

2191
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,280
Again?

2192
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,060
No clue.

2193
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,020
I don't know.

2194
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:45,920
No, we're waiting for people.

2195
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,120
Some people are not there yet.

2196
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,420
I feel like stage 2 is the stream.

2197
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:48,880
That's what...

2198
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,720
Why the fuck is V here?

2199
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,360
Why is so many people here?

2200
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,260
This is more...

2201
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,000
Why is V here?

2202
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:03,840
Yo, thanks, space.

2203
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,000
Guys, please.

2204
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,660
I don't know how to play P2.

2205
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:15,250
Oh, they're trying to make sure the rounds start at the same time.

2206
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:16,010
I see.

2207
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:16,870
That's why.

2208
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:18,510
That makes sense, actually.

2209
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:20,950
I'm gonna go get some water.

2210
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:21,450
I'll be right back.

2211
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:22,530
Alright.

2212
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:23,610
Alright.

2213
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:26,130
Alright.

2214
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:26,770
Water break.

2215
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:29,830
I'm fighting Lily as Lily.

2216
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:30,270
You ready?

2217
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,530
No, but like...

2218
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:36,110
There's not enough Lilies in rank.

2219
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:37,350
There's not enough Lilies in rank.

2220
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:42,930
All she does is she's gonna try to fly at you randomly.

2221
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:45,950
Yeah, like that shit throws me off so much.

2222
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:49,730
Cause like my lariat still timing is not great.

2223
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:51,190
Yeah, you can't really lariat that.

2224
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:56,250
She tries to build up her stores by spinning and then she flies at you.

2225
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:58,770
Yeah, I just have to block, which everyone knows that I'm bad at.

2226
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:03,010
If it has a bunch of wind effects, that's the only one you gotta block.

2227
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:07,330
The other ones where she flies at you without a bunch of special effects, get to mess.

2228
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:08,630
But that's about it.

2229
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:11,010
Other than that, your regular game plan should work.

2230
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:12,070
Alright.

2231
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:13,950
Should be nothing to worry about.

2232
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:16,930
She is aware that I'll grab a lot.

2233
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:18,550
So I'll never grab.

2234
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:21,270
I'll fuck with her.

2235
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:22,470
No, you have to.

2236
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:23,330
I have to grab.

2237
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:27,010
You tried triangle at good times.

2238
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:30,690
Okay, they're telling you to get off player one.

2239
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:31,390
What?

2240
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:35,770
That's not fair.

2241
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:38,690
How did I lose?

2242
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:39,450
I mean, it is fair.

2243
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:41,430
How did I lose?

2244
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,710
I don't understand.

2245
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:47,030
I clearly picked tails.

2246
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:55,670
Okay, but if she wins this one, I should be on...

2247
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:55,830
You can just jump over her.

2248
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,970
I could be on the other side.

2249
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:59,770
You can just walk up and do a jump.

2250
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:04,450
And you're probably gonna sideswap like 15 times during this game.

2251
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:06,570
I know, don't worry about it.

2252
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,010
We'll be okay.

2253
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:10,310
Blame Justin Wong.

2254
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,650
You hear that, Justin?

2255
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:18,050
Justin's a double agent.

2256
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:19,070
He also coached Lily.

2257
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:22,810
He coached everyone I'm fucking fighting, dude.

2258
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:24,450
That shit is rough.

2259
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:26,070
Except me.

2260
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:27,670
I guess I didn't ask him.

2261
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:28,750
Yeah, you didn't ask him.

2262
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:32,650
I didn't want to bother the guy, man.

2263
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:34,470
Like, he's busy.

2264
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:36,530
Oh, nice.

2265
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:36,970
Okay.

2266
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:40,550
Awesome time.

2267
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:42,130
Oh, unlucky.

2268
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:44,290
Oh, yeah.

2269
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:45,770
I hate that so much.

2270
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:47,850
Don't worry.

2271
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:48,750
She's just a silver one.

2272
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:51,350
Yeah, I lost to an iron.

2273
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:52,230
That's not a thing anymore.

2274
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:55,550
Oh...

2275
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,670
Dude, that is not Lily on the sticks.

2276
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:05,470
Can we get a face cam, please?

2277
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:07,290
Do we need the hand cam?

2278
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,050
Oh, my God.

2279
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:10,770
It's so fast.

2280
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:13,650
It's like nobody runs Lily, so I'm so confused.

2281
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:15,230
Oh, my God.

2282
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:16,450
We just have to block that.

2283
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:17,310
Oh, my God.

2284
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:18,910
What the heck, Lily?

2285
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:20,810
Oh, I pressed triangle.

2286
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,130
Yeah, but she's going to move first.

2287
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:26,030
If she does the fancy one, that's the problem.

2288
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:27,270
You got to get out of the way after.

2289
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,550
It looks the same.

2290
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:30,650
It looks the same.

2291
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:31,770
That's the thing.

2292
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:34,610
They all look the same to me.

2293
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:35,510
We'll have to train some Lily.

2294
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:40,730
So, just this game, walk up to her first and DI first.

2295
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:41,450
Okay.

2296
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:44,730
So, she's doing a bunch of big moves from far away then flying at you.

2297
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:45,770
Just walk up and DI first.

2298
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:46,170
Yeah.

2299
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,310
Like, get in there first.

2300
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:49,590
Yeah, get in there now.

2301
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:52,870
Nice.

2302
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:57,150
So, you can keep rushing her down until she gets her...

2303
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:58,190
Okay.

2304
01:28:58,350 --> 01:28:59,470
Oh, my God.

2305
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:00,190
She's blind.

2306
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:03,270
There you go.

2307
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:04,030
Just keep rushing her down.

2308
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:04,470
Okay.

2309
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:05,750
Yeah.

2310
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:06,410
Nice.

2311
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,790
Oh.

2312
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:10,010
That's fine.

2313
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:11,450
Okay.

2314
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:12,370
Now, you got to block if she...

2315
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:12,650
Yeah.

2316
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:13,510
She's going to do the thing.

2317
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,530
You're good.

2318
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:15,450
Now, you can rush her down again.

2319
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:15,750
Okay.

2320
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:16,610
Yeah.

2321
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:18,650
Oh, damn.

2322
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:19,790
I come back and see...

2323
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:22,410
If you rush her down at the beginning of the round, she's weaker.

2324
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:23,270
Okay.

2325
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,130
Going aggressive early is good.

2326
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:27,690
Oh, my God.

2327
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:27,950
Oh.

2328
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:29,370
All right.

2329
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:31,130
You hit the block here.

2330
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,390
That's fine.

2331
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:33,870
Now, try to rush her down again.

2332
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:35,470
Oh.

2333
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:39,310
Yep.

2334
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:41,330
Okay.

2335
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:43,310
Oh.

2336
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:43,690
Yeah.

2337
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,110
And you can rush her down really hard now.

2338
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:46,810
Yep.

2339
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:48,830
Wow.

2340
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:49,910
No.

2341
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:51,890
That's fine.

2342
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:52,490
You're alive.

2343
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:52,650
You're alive.

2344
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:54,470
You're a tank.

2345
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:56,530
Did I hit that?

2346
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:56,890
Yep.

2347
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:57,670
Oh.

2348
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:58,470
Okay.

2349
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:00,610
I didn't know I hit that.

2350
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:03,930
Does that kill?

2351
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:05,670
I was critical, right?

2352
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:05,870
Yeah.

2353
01:30:06,190 --> 01:30:06,570
Okay.

2354
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:09,750
She's beyond dead.

2355
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:10,970
Beautiful.

2356
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:13,770
You gave her back pain.

2357
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:14,790
That's how dead she is.

2358
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,090
Okay.

2359
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:17,050
I should be allowed to be player one after that.

2360
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:17,690
I should...

2361
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:21,470
You're kicking ass off player two.

2362
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:22,330
Just rush her down.

2363
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:25,210
Forget the damn sides.

2364
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:27,110
I will never forget.

2365
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:29,550
Get in there.

2366
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:30,450
Uh oh.

2367
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:34,330
Yes.

2368
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:35,230
Nice.

2369
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:38,630
Oh.

2370
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:39,430
Unlucky.

2371
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:42,110
I should have done the run through it.

2372
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:45,230
Okay.

2373
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:47,050
She's gonna fly at you any second.

2374
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:48,910
Just try to block it.

2375
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:50,290
And then jump after you're blocking it.

2376
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:53,270
Oh.

2377
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:54,510
I jumped though.

2378
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:55,670
Good jump.

2379
01:30:55,670 --> 01:30:55,930
Good jump.

2380
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:56,390
That was great.

2381
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:57,670
Yeah.

2382
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:00,030
Block.

2383
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:00,990
Oh.

2384
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:01,190
What?

2385
01:31:01,450 --> 01:31:03,870
That was bullshit.

2386
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:04,410
That was bullshit.

2387
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:05,410
That sucked.

2388
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:06,570
Nice.

2389
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:08,450
Get her.

2390
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:09,630
She's burnt out.

2391
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:10,190
Oh.

2392
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:12,650
No shot.

2393
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,170
Oh my gosh.

2394
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:16,690
Oh no.

2395
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:17,810
Do I get this?

2396
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:18,330
I do.

2397
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:18,970
Yes.

2398
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:19,270
Yes.

2399
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:22,030
Let's go.

2400
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:25,510
I love how the rush her down is Siberian Express.

2401
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:29,970
I mean he does rush her down with that.

2402
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:30,110
Yeah.

2403
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:32,370
Nice.

2404
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:32,870
Oh.

2405
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:33,570
Get in there.

2406
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:34,710
Oh.

2407
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:35,310
She got it.

2408
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,260
No.

2409
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,320
She grabs me.

2410
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:41,980
Yeah.

2411
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,480
You gotta jump to avoid the grabs after.

2412
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:43,860
Okay.

2413
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:46,540
Yes.

2414
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,000
Nice.

2415
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:47,940
Okay.

2416
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:48,600
That's good too.

2417
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,100
Did I get that?

2418
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:52,200
No.

2419
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,900
She got that over.

2420
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:55,800
It's okay.

2421
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,060
It's okay.

2422
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:56,520
Composure.

2423
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:58,680
Get that.

2424
01:31:58,780 --> 01:31:59,180
Wait.

2425
01:31:59,280 --> 01:31:59,640
You got it.

2426
01:31:59,640 --> 01:31:59,860
Yes.

2427
01:31:59,860 --> 01:31:59,860
Okay.

2428
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,500
You got it.

2429
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:01,080
Trust you.

2430
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,680
One more.

2431
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,560
She's gonna wake up soon.

2432
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:05,240
She might wake up.

2433
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:06,060
Okay.

2434
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,020
It's okay.

2435
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:07,560
Burned out.

2436
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:08,160
Oh.

2437
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,560
She grabbed me.

2438
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,160
Yeah.

2439
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:11,520
That's alright.

2440
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,660
No worries.

2441
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:13,020
No worries.

2442
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,780
Just rush her down again.

2443
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:15,220
It's working.

2444
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:17,120
Oh.

2445
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:17,920
She knows now.

2446
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:20,760
Oh.

2447
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:21,480
Did I hit that?

2448
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:21,960
Oh.

2449
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:22,300
No.

2450
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,740
She...

2451
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,100
Oh.

2452
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:23,680
You gotta jump.

2453
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:24,500
Sorry.

2454
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,220
I should have told you.

2455
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:26,060
That's a command grab.

2456
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,180
I think she was too close, right?

2457
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:29,300
Nah.

2458
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:29,680
It's fine.

2459
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,000
It's fine.

2460
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:31,620
Okay.

2461
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:32,240
You can rush her down.

2462
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,240
What?

2463
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:33,380
Oh.

2464
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:37,040
Nice.

2465
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,340
You can win this easy.

2466
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:38,980
Yeah.

2467
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,580
She has nothing to defend herself.

2468
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:42,460
Nice.

2469
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:43,920
Nice.

2470
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:44,740
Nice.

2471
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:45,720
No.

2472
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,200
It's okay.

2473
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:51,800
No.

2474
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,280
I don't think...

2475
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:52,660
No.

2476
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:53,920
She ducked.

2477
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:56,240
That was close though.

2478
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,640
Very close though.

2479
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:58,500
Yeah.

2480
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,320
You got the general flow of it.

2481
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,720
You just didn't know about that wake up super.

2482
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:05,680
We'll practice that.

2483
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,160
That move, you can't block.

2484
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,380
It's like geese.

2485
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:09,940
You have to hold up.

2486
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:10,580
Yeah.

2487
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,160
That was so good.

2488
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:16,300
That was literally the fourth Lily I've ever fought.

2489
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,620
She's not popular at all.

2490
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:22,680
I think the third or fourth Lily I've ever fought.

2491
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:24,760
Same with the slow though.

2492
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,860
You rush her down early and she's a lot weaker.

2493
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,220
That's basically how it goes.

2494
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:29,560
Yeah.

2495
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,240
Scar is flat wide.

2496
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,000
Okay.

2497
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:36,900
All right.

2498
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:37,880
Oh, you like clean too.

2499
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:38,180
Nice.

2500
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:39,220
Let's go, SK.

2501
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,400
She looks like Lily.

2502
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:44,100
From Temkin.

2503
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,960
Oh, he had level one.

2504
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:47,780
I forgot.

2505
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:49,000
I did forget Justin.

2506
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,000
Justin's trying to get you to do some fancy stuff.

2507
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:57,440
We can practice that more, but that's kind of hard.

2508
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:01,900
Manon looks like an ostrich in that first screen.

2509
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:07,140
That's the most accurate depiction of Manon.

2510
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:08,360
I think I've heard of.

2511
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,940
He hair grabs.

2512
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:14,700
It's so annoying.

2513
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,280
Yeah, she's a command grab character.

2514
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,060
So she might force you to jump or match.

2515
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,700
I tried to jump both times there, but she did the hit thing instead.

2516
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,920
Yeah, you can also just try mashing your OD reversal.

2517
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:28,880
It's the uppercut.

2518
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:29,740
Okay.

2519
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:30,580
Or electric.

2520
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,000
That's the mix up with this character.

2521
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:36,580
Boom, boom.

2522
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,620
Oh, nice.

2523
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:40,520
Wow.

2524
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:42,740
I thought that was my right.

2525
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:43,900
Scar is gaming like that.

2526
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:44,320
That's great.

2527
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:45,600
I'm sorry.

2528
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:46,000
It's flat.

2529
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:49,640
That's gonna hurt.

2530
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,020
Oh, that's gonna hurt a lot.

2531
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:51,880
Oh, nice.

2532
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:52,700
There you go.

2533
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:53,420
Okay.

2534
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,300
Oh, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

2535
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,740
Oh, sorry.

2536
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:02,580
Yeah, these supers, both Manon and Lily, the big level threes, they're grabs.

2537
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,720
You can just jump after they do it.

2538
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,120
So they'll just whiff and you can kill them.

2539
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:11,140
So he does that again with the level three and you're not just always hold up.

2540
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,080
So we'll see if he does it again.

2541
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,080
It'll just come into play at the end of the game.

2542
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:23,520
Nice.

2543
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:37,890
Nice.

2544
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:38,210
Nice.

2545
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:38,470
Nice, SK.

2546
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:39,350
Nice.

2547
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:40,790
Oops.

2548
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:46,670
It's not like a mom.

2549
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:47,950
I'm in the event right now.

2550
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:51,230
What was that?

2551
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:52,310
Was that your mom?

2552
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:55,070
Was that Brawl Mom interrupting this one?

2553
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:56,370
Yeah, was that Brawl Mom, dude?

2554
01:35:56,890 --> 01:35:59,370
I think she wanted to do something.

2555
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:00,670
It's supposed to be oil.

2556
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:02,910
You're gonna take all the trash, BP, dude.

2557
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:05,070
Sorry mom, I'm gaming.

2558
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,170
I can't just leave.

2559
01:36:06,290 --> 01:36:07,390
You can't pause the video game.

2560
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:09,470
Sorry for yelling, guys.

2561
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:11,730
Aw, it's okay.

2562
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:13,190
That was a good round.

2563
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:18,490
I only muted my stream.

2564
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:20,090
You forgot to mute!

2565
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:23,050
There's too many controls.

2566
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:28,790
There's apparently an Amazon package for me out there.

2567
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:31,310
Nice.

2568
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:33,790
Nice.

2569
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:39,780
Nice defense.

2570
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:42,660
Nice.

2571
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:43,300
Nice.

2572
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:44,180
And they're burnt out.

2573
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:45,480
Oh, what?

2574
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,580
Nice jump.

2575
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:55,660
Nice.

2576
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,700
Yeah, that two-hit move is punishable.

2577
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:01,280
I'm scared.

2578
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,040
Get away from me.

2579
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:04,360
Don't grab.

2580
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:08,960
Nice fireballs.

2581
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:09,640
Nice fireballs.

2582
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:12,500
No!

2583
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:14,300
That was close.

2584
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,660
Good try.

2585
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:18,040
Good try, good try.

2586
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,220
Were you trying to do the wake up electric?

2587
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:21,560
Were you trying to do the wake up electric?

2588
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22,380
I am.

2589
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:25,180
I should have, but I was trying to jump.

2590
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:28,880
Yeah, next time we can try that more.

2591
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,480
He's doing hit or grab every time.

2592
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,720
He's doing hit or grab every time.

2593
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,680
I guess to jump every time.

2594
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:38,120
But I was wrong most of the time.

2595
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:38,960
Yeah.

2596
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,940
That's where the wake up reversal comes in handy.

2597
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:43,480
You said DI.

2598
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:45,620
He's susceptible to DI and what?

2599
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:46,260
A medium kick?

2600
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,640
Jump, medium kick.

2601
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,760
If he's walking backwards.

2602
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:55,420
If he doesn't have downcharge, he can't really anti-air you that good.

2603
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,880
So you can walk up, jump, MK.

2604
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,680
And if he's walking away, you can try random DI.

2605
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:01,960
But it's all kind of a guess.

2606
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:03,960
But don't be scared to DI.

2607
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,540
Oh shit, Nephew's 84th rank.

2608
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:07,960
That's higher than 97.

2609
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:11,380
Yeah, Nephew's kind of cracked.

2610
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,640
I'm telling you SK, just go in there.

2611
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,900
I'm a big tier 3 sub.

2612
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,400
Biggest fan.

2613
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,140
I'm your number one donator.

2614
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:22,020
You see that person that donated that much money?

2615
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:22,960
That was me on my alt account.

2616
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,320
I was watching his guide on YouTube.

2617
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,820
But the problem is he's too good.

2618
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,380
I can't replicate anything he does.

2619
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:31,400
That went by so fast.

2620
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,140
I literally just caught the end of that.

2621
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:49,070
Nice.

2622
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:51,710
Nice.

2623
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:59,910
You had enough.

2624
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:04,990
I thought that had armor.

2625
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:08,730
Let's go.

2626
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:13,390
If anything, Broppo will always get us that one point.

2627
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,350
I'm burnt out.

2628
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:19,350
It's okay, you don't need it.

2629
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:21,350
Yes!

2630
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:22,130
Nice!

2631
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:23,630
They messed up.

2632
01:39:26,410 --> 01:39:28,030
Everyone's scared in the face of the thief.

2633
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:28,390
Yeah.

2634
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:32,770
Nice!

2635
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:33,230
Nice!

2636
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:33,670
Nice!

2637
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:40,230
Where are you going?

2638
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:45,420
Nice!

2639
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:45,940
Level 3!

2640
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:46,760
Nice!

2641
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:50,180
That's yours!

2642
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,400
My loyal fans!

2643
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:53,760
Should be dead, right?

2644
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:55,200
Yes, sir!

2645
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:57,880
Yes, sir!

2646
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,320
Random DI's.

2647
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,100
Really good against DJ.

2648
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,220
I'll keep that in mind.

2649
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:06,740
I think I have to face DJ, too.

2650
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:09,100
In this match?

2651
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:10,920
Not in this one.

2652
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:11,880
In the next one, I think.

2653
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:12,860
Or the last one.

2654
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,000
I think all Sham Noel plays DJ.

2655
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:18,220
Wait, who hits first?

2656
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:18,700
Oh, you!

2657
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:19,160
Nice!

2658
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,180
Sometimes you just can't tell.

2659
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:23,480
Yeah, I can't tell who hits first.

2660
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:28,060
Oh, you grabbed him.

2661
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:28,520
That would be cool.

2662
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,680
You're doing real good here.

2663
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:30,680
He's scared, dude.

2664
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:31,160
He's scared.

2665
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,620
You'd be worse if you were on modern brawl, bro.

2666
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,220
Not wrong.

2667
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:39,880
Guaranteed DI.

2668
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,400
Yes!

2669
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:41,340
Nice!

2670
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:47,360
I thought you were silent for a second.

2671
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:48,840
That's sick!

2672
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,420
That's his favorite whack-ass combo.

2673
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,220
But there...

2674
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:52,960
Brian was mad?

2675
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,160
No, it was good.

2676
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:03,240
Yo!

2677
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,120
Oh my god.

2678
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,860
Yo, that chop was so close to his face.

2679
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:09,820
You can smell his fingers.

2680
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:10,860
Nice!

2681
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:13,560
My man is scared, dude.

2682
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:14,980
Yeah.

2683
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:15,440
Oh!

2684
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,040
Fair enough.

2685
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:19,620
He had to.

2686
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:21,240
Yeah, he did.

2687
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,520
Oh my god, look at all the music.

2688
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,480
But you're in player one side now.

2689
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:27,920
Brother.

2690
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:28,640
Empty jump.

2691
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:29,600
You got the good side.

2692
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:31,060
The front comes in.

2693
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:37,800
I just survived.

2694
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,220
Okay, he might try to DI you.

2695
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:42,980
So maybe you can wake up Super, potentially.

2696
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:43,860
Just think about it.

2697
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:47,220
Oh!

2698
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:47,760
Oh, does it hit?

2699
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:48,640
Oh!

2700
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,100
That was so close!

2701
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:55,000
I respect it.

2702
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,020
I respect it.

2703
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,300
That was pretty good.

2704
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:58,780
Maybe you're not meant for P1.

2705
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:01,220
There we go.

2706
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:04,140
Maybe you're a P2 gamer.

2707
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,200
Oh, that was good.

2708
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:14,520
Where you going, Amigo?

2709
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:17,320
Oh, nice!

2710
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:19,360
Burnout?

2711
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:19,780
Yes!

2712
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:22,180
Nice!

2713
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:23,400
The stop!

2714
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,260
What the fuck!

2715
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:28,240
I knew he was gonna jump because of the burnout.

2716
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:30,380
That's how you normally play, Keith.

2717
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,200
Not what it looks like I'm doing.

2718
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,340
Oh!

2719
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:36,160
An actual anti-air.

2720
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:36,660
I'm amazed.

2721
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:37,420
Let's go.

2722
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:41,500
Alright, let's see this.

2723
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:43,140
Alright.

2724
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,100
I'm actually there to spectate.

2725
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:47,540
So who do you have here?

2726
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,180
Uh, Huntress.

2727
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,660
Oh, coin flip?

2728
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:52,200
Oh, dude.

2729
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:53,580
Tails.

2730
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:56,960
Coin flip time.

2731
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:58,840
Who's Huntress playing?

2732
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,860
Uh, Chun.

2733
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:01,060
Okay.

2734
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:01,760
She's really good.

2735
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:03,320
She probably has the highest MR out of anybody.

2736
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:04,140
Damn.

2737
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:06,280
It's like 1700, I think.

2738
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,240
You know what?

2739
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:11,120
I think for this matchup, I'm gonna have to, uh, rock another color here.

2740
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,480
I'm gonna get some plot open back.

2741
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,880
I'm gonna, I'm gonna rock...

2742
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,360
uh, Laki.

2743
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,140
There we go.

2744
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:21,900
L.A.

2745
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:22,480
Aki, dude.

2746
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:23,400
Aki from L.A.

2747
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,300
Damn, I lost the coin flip.

2748
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:30,040
I, I...

2749
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,820
That's what's up, man.

2750
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:37,280
Okay.

2751
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:41,360
Yeah, this is late Kurzaki.

2752
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:42,060
Let's do this.

2753
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:45,060
Why doesn't anyone like Player 2?

2754
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:45,960
I love Player 2.

2755
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,720
I don't mind Player 2 at all.

2756
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:49,160
I just wanted to do it for mind games.

2757
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:49,920
To be honest.

2758
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:50,980
Player 1?

2759
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:51,880
Yeah, that's fair too.

2760
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,140
I should just take everyone's Player 1, actually.

2761
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:56,580
Yeah, just for fun.

2762
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:57,700
Do the...

2763
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:00,400
Do the coin flip, dude.

2764
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,480
Alright, let's lock in here.

2765
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:02,760
What's the record?

2766
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:03,640
Is it, uh...

2767
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:04,280
What is it?

2768
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:06,180
They have 2, we have 1, right?

2769
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:08,260
Yeah.

2770
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:08,600
Okay.

2771
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,460
Yeah, I think so.

2772
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,880
It is possible she doesn't know the matchup.

2773
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:23,600
You know what I mean?

2774
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,000
Oh my god, Popov.

2775
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:28,320
I think Coefficient's just better.

2776
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,100
I think so too, actually.

2777
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:32,580
Woo!

2778
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:34,740
Forgot about that.

2779
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:40,150
Nice.

2780
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:51,420
Oh my god.

2781
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:58,100
Nice challenge.

2782
01:44:58,180 --> 01:44:58,540
That's confirmed.

2783
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:01,680
I saw the vision.

2784
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:04,840
Nice.

2785
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:05,380
Beautiful!

2786
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:05,860
Is she dead?

2787
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:06,880
Level 2?

2788
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:08,820
Yeah, I knew it.

2789
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:11,040
Oh, I think I can...

2790
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:11,580
Oh, you know what?

2791
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,620
I think I could've slid after that.

2792
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:13,960
Yeah.

2793
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:14,260
Yeah.

2794
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:15,640
Maybe just try it, yeah.

2795
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:16,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2796
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,260
Good round, though.

2797
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,060
That's close.

2798
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:19,560
Very close.

2799
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,060
Round 2.

2800
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:22,820
Fight!

2801
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,740
She adapted really fast, too.

2802
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:51,470
Them boys playing chess.

2803
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:54,550
Beautiful.

2804
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:57,270
Ooh!

2805
01:45:57,370 --> 01:45:58,170
Empty jump low!

2806
01:45:58,430 --> 01:45:58,590
Oh!

2807
01:45:58,590 --> 01:45:58,870
Oh!

2808
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:00,570
Let's go.

2809
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:01,730
Oh my goodness.

2810
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:02,630
Oh my god, what a combo.

2811
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:04,650
Set up.

2812
01:46:05,770 --> 01:46:06,390
One more.

2813
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:07,710
Nice!

2814
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:10,010
That was sick.

2815
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:10,770
Let's get them shook.

2816
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:11,910
Let's go.

2817
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:17,470
They're first.

2818
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:34,020
Nice.

2819
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:35,680
Let's get that level 3.

2820
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,320
Nice.

2821
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,340
Oh, I wanted... I was cheeky.

2822
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:39,800
Cheeky.

2823
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:40,160
Cheeky.

2824
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:40,220
Cheeky.

2825
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:40,360
Cheeky.

2826
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:40,360
Cheeky.

2827
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,080
Oh, they're burnt, though?

2828
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:41,780
You're good.

2829
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:42,180
Yeah, yeah.

2830
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,240
Mm-hmm.

2831
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,100
Yeah, I'm dead.

2832
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:52,560
Are you?

2833
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:54,320
Is that critical?

2834
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:56,100
Yeah, I think so.

2835
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:58,740
Unless...

2836
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:01,400
Unless...

2837
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:04,680
Oh, that's close.

2838
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:07,220
That's close on both ends.

2839
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:08,280
I have a question.

2840
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:13,460
Is it hard to stun them on Aki if they're burnt when they're doing the strings like that?

2841
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:14,960
No, but they can just super.

2842
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:16,640
It's always a guess, right?

2843
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:17,540
Yeah.

2844
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:19,160
Aki's good at that, just like everybody else.

2845
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,760
Okay, okay, got it.

2846
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:21,520
It's a risk.

2847
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:30,060
We only lost two of her supers.

2848
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,000
Yeah.

2849
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:32,660
Both browns.

2850
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:36,140
Oh my god.

2851
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:39,480
Nice tech.

2852
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:42,940
Ooh!

2853
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:44,820
That's an overhead, right?

2854
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:45,580
Yeah.

2855
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:47,860
What the hell?

2856
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,500
Ah, there's some flubs there.

2857
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:52,100
Don't worry about it.

2858
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:54,780
Ooh.

2859
01:48:03,790 --> 01:48:04,450
That's nice.

2860
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:06,030
Oh.

2861
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:15,030
Nice!

2862
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:15,590
Oh.

2863
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:15,950
Okay.

2864
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:26,770
Nice.

2865
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:28,170
Nice.

2866
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:29,250
Nice pressure.

2867
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:33,090
Nice pressure.

2868
01:48:34,930 --> 01:48:35,270
Oh!

2869
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:38,510
That was crazy from the Cheninni.

2870
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:41,070
Yeah, like a movie.

2871
01:48:41,290 --> 01:48:43,870
Yeah, the blocking for that.

2872
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:45,770
Good defense.

2873
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:49,790
Bravo, no.

2874
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:50,470
You're jinxed it.

2875
01:48:51,970 --> 01:48:53,010
I panicked.

2876
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:54,330
I panicked so hard, dude.

2877
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:56,770
They were choking, too.

2878
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:57,510
I do.

2879
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:00,230
Yeah.

2880
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:02,230
That was bad.

2881
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:03,190
God dang it.

2882
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:08,640
I feel like I was doing good there.

2883
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,700
It's just I don't know how to fight Cheninni.

2884
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,080
We'll know by tomorrow.

2885
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:16,040
Yeah.

2886
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:19,760
Alright.

2887
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,920
Time to watch the...

2888
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:24,020
Time to watch this.

2889
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,280
I believe.

2890
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,140
I believe.

2891
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:26,800
Let's go.

2892
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,480
Should we fun?

2893
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,100
Yes.

2894
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:32,400
Yeah, you said Juri's low tier, right?

2895
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:35,100
Yeah, she's never won a big tournament ever.

2896
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:36,180
Yeah.

2897
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:37,220
Right?

2898
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:38,660
For sure.

2899
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,360
Yeah, and then there's like 500 EDs in top 8.

2900
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:43,820
Right.

2901
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:44,500
Yeah, dude.

2902
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:45,040
Yeah.

2903
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:47,160
500 EDs in top 8.

2904
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,900
There was like 3 of them, bro.

2905
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,000
Where was the Juri in that?

2906
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:51,340
Yeah, where was the Juri in that?

2907
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,420
Exactly.

2908
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:04,660
Come on, coach.

2909
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:05,500
You're literally meta.

2910
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:09,400
What?

2911
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,580
It's true.

2912
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:12,620
You're distracting him.

2913
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:13,240
I'm sorry.

2914
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,980
I got him into a throw loop.

2915
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:16,440
I'm sorry.

2916
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,040
I'll take that.

2917
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:18,340
Get him.

2918
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:25,740
Dude, that's my bad.

2919
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:34,920
Alright, here we go.

2920
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,700
Okay, this is when Juri becomes top tier.

2921
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:37,680
Hold on.

2922
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,780
I thought you guys said she's off meta.

2923
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,060
Yeah, I know.

2924
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,040
Oh, nice.

2925
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,340
Oh, coach is so good too.

2926
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:46,620
That walk under?

2927
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:46,860
Yeah.

2928
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:01,600
Okay.

2929
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,040
Oh, empty.

2930
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,100
Oh, nice.

2931
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:04,660
Dude.

2932
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,520
It's time to be fancy with it.

2933
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,000
Fuck it.

2934
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:07,680
We ball, dude.

2935
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:14,560
Oh.

2936
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:18,020
That's good.

2937
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:20,100
Oh, please block that.

2938
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:20,700
Oh, no.

2939
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:21,060
Good.

2940
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,100
Nice mash.

2941
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:26,880
Nice.

2942
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,860
If he had level 2, that would have been dead.

2943
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:35,700
Oh, the spacing.

2944
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:37,000
Alright, alright, alright.

2945
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:38,720
This is neutral, Doki.

2946
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:39,480
Just letting you know.

2947
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:40,720
Wait, which part?

2948
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:42,500
This.

2949
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,600
This entire thing?

2950
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:44,200
That.

2951
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:44,740
That was neutral.

2952
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:47,700
That's neutral.

2953
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,300
That's okay.

2954
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:52,320
All he does is play Street Fighter.

2955
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:52,820
That's okay.

2956
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:57,500
He quit his job for this.

2957
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,280
Brian, you know what to do.

2958
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:07,240
You know what to do then.

2959
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:10,440
You want that 50k.

2960
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:14,000
You gotta be hungry, coach.

2961
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:14,680
Come on.

2962
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,220
Pretend like you have to pay rent tomorrow.

2963
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:23,920
Ooh.

2964
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,500
See, Doki, that was neutral.

2965
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:32,070
This is rushdown.

2966
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:32,890
I hate this fucking character.

2967
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:34,490
Oh, the back dash.

2968
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:37,630
Oh, here we go.

2969
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:39,930
Oh.

2970
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:40,170
Oh.

2971
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:44,480
Okay.

2972
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:46,760
Here we go.

2973
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:48,840
Ah, the burnout.

2974
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:51,020
Oh my god, you're sick, coach.

2975
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,080
Oh my god.

2976
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:52,520
Is this good?

2977
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:52,880
Let's go.

2978
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:57,840
Ah, just barely.

2979
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:59,540
Oh, that was close.

2980
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,800
You were so good with it too.

2981
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:03,140
Yeah.

2982
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:05,840
Okay.

2983
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:06,420
Okay.

2984
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:10,780
Okay.

2985
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:11,760
Okay.

2986
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:12,800
Alright.

2987
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:17,490
Alright, here we go.

2988
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:18,310
He's gonna do that thing.

2989
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:20,210
Ugh, the mind games.

2990
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:21,290
Yeah.

2991
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,620
It's a lot of damage, dude.

2992
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:28,540
I might be dead.

2993
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:29,380
Yeah.

2994
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:32,660
Oh, you might be actually dead.

2995
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,080
SK, you know what to do.

2996
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:35,740
You got...

2997
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:36,740
Yeah, I think you're dead.

2998
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:37,420
Yeah, yeah.

2999
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,740
I'll just pull that out.

3000
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,080
Yeah.

3001
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:42,500
I got looped.

3002
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:43,440
I got punished.

3003
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:44,820
You know what you gotta do.

3004
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,080
See, Doki, that was neutral.

3005
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,440
Wait, which part?

3006
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,720
The entire thing.

3007
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:53,320
The entire game was neutral?

3008
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:56,060
The entire game.

3009
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:00,300
That's the part where they're not close to each other and they're looking for opportunities.

3010
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:00,960
This is the team we have to lab.

3011
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:01,720
Okay.

3012
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:03,620
First practice.

3013
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:04,400
Braving.

3014
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,360
Good try, man.

3015
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:11,560
And we can start by having SK go to Nephew and say, I'm your biggest fan.

3016
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:13,360
Alright, I'm gonna add Nephew right now.

3017
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:14,680
Nephew, please coach.

3018
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:21,820
Add Nephew.

3019
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:23,860
Can you coach...

3020
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:26,100
Can you coach...

3021
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:26,840
Can you coach SK for us?

3022
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:30,260
She's your biggest fan.

3023
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,620
She's your biggest fan.

3024
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:35,580
And was screaming for you instead of for our coach.

3025
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:45,580
They don't know.

3026
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:46,520
They don't check VODs.

3027
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:47,600
They don't know.

3028
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:50,420
They don't check VODs.

3029
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:58,480
That's good.

3030
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:02,760
Alright, so who do we play next?

3031
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,140
I think it's Team Shine.

3032
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,020
What did he say to the reply?

3033
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,460
I posted it in general.

3034
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,780
Justin was like, I'll retweet it.

3035
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,740
It was in our general chat.

3036
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:20,740
Wait, you will.

3037
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:22,360
That's not against Menon.

3038
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:26,780
That's fine.

3039
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:27,640
Just take all the info.

3040
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:28,160
Do we know who's on Team Shine?

3041
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:30,260
Let's go to the news.

3042
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:31,900
Oh, SK!

3043
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:32,860
You're in!

3044
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:33,540
You're the best!

3045
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:34,400
You're in!

3046
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:35,740
You're literally in!

3047
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:40,080
So that's Kana, Yanagi...

3048
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,860
Oh, V-Bright Shield and Umi and Infernasu.

3049
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:44,360
Yeah.

3050
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:45,700
Cool.

3051
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:46,980
We did it.

3052
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,240
We fucking did it.

3053
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:54,480
Now SK will be the next Nephew.

3054
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:56,440
We're probably waiting here for a while.

3055
01:55:56,860 --> 01:55:57,680
Oh, really?

3056
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:00,540
Yeah, S-fan and Fumi haven't even finished fighting.

3057
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,260
Oh, okay.

3058
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:03,380
What the fuck?

3059
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,000
We started the same time, didn't we?

3060
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:05,640
Are they on the Sage stream?

3061
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:07,500
I don't know, actually.

3062
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:11,140
Ormoy won his match.

3063
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:13,980
Yeah, but you won against V2.

3064
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:17,620
Yeah, dude.

3065
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,100
No worries.

3066
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:21,420
And you're fucking around with V2.

3067
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:23,740
Jamie against Zangief is... I don't like it.

3068
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,420
Yeah, no.

3069
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,460
Jamie's kind of a bitch.

3070
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,000
He's kind of a hoe.

3071
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:30,500
I feel like I have to let him drink for free on Zangief.

3072
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:35,000
I don't even know how you approach that match.

3073
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,300
Yeah, you kind of have to approach him the whole time to prevent him from doing that.

3074
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:38,920
What is that palm?

3075
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:40,500
Can I light SPD it on block?

3076
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,640
The OD version is...

3077
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,840
I think they're all negative four now.

3078
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:47,420
So, no, you can't do that as a guaranteed punish.

3079
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:47,600
Oh, wow.

3080
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,900
I mean, it's a mix-up, though.

3081
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:50,820
You can try it, but it's not guaranteed.

3082
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:52,160
Hmm.

3083
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:54,640
Okay.

3084
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:56,460
So, are they doing palm on you?

3085
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,300
Like, randomly?

3086
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,020
I don't remember how to fight against Bison.

3087
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:00,900
Um, I don't know.

3088
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,440
I guess we'll find out what happens.

3089
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,820
How do I fight against Bison again?

3090
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,180
Can she...

3091
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:09,980
Like, light SPD is a scissor kick or anything?

3092
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:10,500
Or no?

3093
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,300
Yeah, but it has to be spaced.

3094
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,300
If they space it, then you can't.

3095
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:16,180
Damn.

3096
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,960
But if they don't space it, then you can.

3097
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:20,100
But it's like, that takes so much awareness.

3098
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:21,440
So fast.

3099
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:26,000
But, I mean, this is Rookie Raid, you know.

3100
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,940
Oh my god, apparently I tilted Sykkuno.

3101
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:30,020
He messaged me.

3102
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:32,820
He was like, your Zangief traumatized and tilted me so high.

3103
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:38,420
Because, like, we bumped into each other like two times in ranked.

3104
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:40,620
So, like, in the end, it was like a 3-0.

3105
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:42,700
So, like, in the end, it was like a 3-0.

3106
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:43,740
So, like, in the end, it was like a 3-0.

3107
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,620
So, like, in the end, it was like a 3-0.

3108
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:44,660
Like...

3109
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:46,340
Based Doki, dude.

3110
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:47,940
Traumatizing Sykkuno.

3111
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:51,960
I just fight so many Camis!

3112
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:54,780
Like, literally every two games, it's a fucking Camis.

3113
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:56,420
I'm so done.

3114
01:57:58,340 --> 01:57:59,480
Cami's really popular.

3115
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:05,080
I run into a lot of Camis too.

3116
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:05,660
She's everywhere.

3117
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:07,920
I blame Punk.

3118
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,660
She's everywhere.

3119
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:11,840
It's not just Punk's fault.

3120
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:12,940
That character is a problem.

3121
01:58:12,940 --> 01:58:13,960
It's because of outfit too.

3122
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,180
It doesn't help that she has a nice booty either.

3123
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:20,500
Yes.

3124
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:21,040
Yes.

3125
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:24,100
Can I get an amen?

3126
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:31,120
Yes.

3127
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:34,800
Every time Doki grabbed Cami, her butt was in full view.

3128
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:35,780
Yeah, dude!

3129
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:37,220
That would say the same thing, dude!

3130
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,620
I'm like, thank you, Doki.

3131
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:40,440
Keep grabbing, Doki.

3132
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:40,820
Don't stop.

3133
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:43,700
Maybe that's why he let me win.

3134
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:45,980
Because it's just Koomer bait.

3135
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:48,580
Well, you should tell Sykkuno that.

3136
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:49,560
It's like, I know what you're doing.

3137
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:49,900
It's fine.

3138
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:50,740
You're throwing on purpose.

3139
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:50,900
Hahaha!

3140
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,540
Where are they at?

3141
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:00,180
Where?

3142
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:04,580
Oh.

3143
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:09,800
So they're playing Now and Shine stream.

3144
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:10,960
Okay.

3145
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:15,020
Wait, can I play ranking?

3146
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,000
You might have time for like one.

3147
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:18,440
Oh, shit.

3148
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:19,100
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

3149
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,060
One or two.

3150
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:22,800
Yeah, they gotta do Infernasu and then they gotta do...

3151
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:25,320
I think that's the last one for the coaches.

3152
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:26,780
Alright, I'm gonna play ranking.

3153
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:29,340
Mikko, have you...

3154
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:29,840
Oh, he went AFK.

3155
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:34,120
I need to warm up.

3156
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:35,100
I'm ready.

3157
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:35,360
I'll be right back.

3158
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:42,100
Do you know who, uh...

3159
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:43,660
Who are you playing?

3160
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:43,920
SK?

3161
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,220
Not Fumi.

3162
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:45,960
Bright Shield?

3163
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:48,000
Ed.

3164
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:49,200
She's playing as an Ed.

3165
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:50,200
Ed?

3166
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:50,600
Okay.

3167
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:50,800
Yeah.

3168
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:53,240
I'm playing against a Bison.

3169
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,080
My random matchup is against a Bison.

3170
01:59:58,260 --> 01:59:58,860
What are the odds?

3171
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:00,320
Is that the matchup you're gonna play right now?

3172
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:00,840
Yeah!

3173
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:02,320
What are the odds?

3174
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:03,420
Oh, he knows.

3175
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:03,860
Fuck.

3176
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:04,120
Okay.

3177
02:00:08,580 --> 02:00:09,480
Oh my god.

3178
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:10,240
Where's your internet?

3179
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,740
I don't remember the combo.

3180
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:15,800
It's been a while since I fought a Bison.

3181
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:19,480
That's the worst part.

3182
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:21,220
I don't remember their moves sometimes.

3183
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:23,280
Guys, internet is dog shit.

3184
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,120
Oh, he's WiFi.

3185
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:25,640
Okay.

3186
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,300
Oh.

3187
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:30,340
Oh.

3188
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:35,340
Oh.

3189
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:39,540
Oh, please.

3190
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:42,320
They're fucking with me right now.

3191
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:43,440
WiFi.

3192
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,580
Oh, shit.

3193
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:47,260
Weed God beating your ass right now.

3194
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:48,760
Bro, he's always...

3195
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:51,700
That's the worst WiFi I've ever seen.

3196
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,220
Look at this!

3197
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:56,040
His router is stoned.

3198
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:57,440
Don't worry about it.

3199
02:00:57,740 --> 02:00:59,600
Are you playing a match with WiFi?

3200
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:00,320
Yeah.

3201
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:01,980
I've never had...

3202
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,400
The Weed God is in there.

3203
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:04,580
The Weed God.

3204
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:07,860
The Weed God is fucking me up.

3205
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:08,820
Nope.

3206
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:11,040
What the fuck is this?

3207
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,440
Oh my god.

3208
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:19,880
I don't have an answer on if Brian is single.

3209
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:21,760
Oh.

3210
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:21,900
No.

3211
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:25,660
He has an answer for you again.

3212
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:26,480
What?

3213
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:28,260
He reacted to this.

3214
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:30,200
Oh, damn.

3215
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:31,780
I ran into BoxBox on the right.

3216
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:32,220
Nice.

3217
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,920
What do I do here?

3218
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:38,440
The run back.

3219
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,280
Give me the run back.

3220
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,220
Jesus Christ.

3221
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:43,380
If I win this, I'll be so surprised.

3222
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:44,920
This fucking...

3223
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:45,360
...

3224
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:46,340
...

3225
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:46,460
...

3226
02:01:54,060 --> 02:01:54,900
...

3227
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:54,960
...

3228
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:57,720
...

3229
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:03,680
...

3230
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,000
...

3231
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,440
...

3232
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,960
...

3233
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:06,500
...

3234
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:13,140
I can barely process anything right now.

3235
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:16,140
I'm watching it in like five frames per second.

3236
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:19,140
I'm watching it in like five frames per second.

3237
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:19,220
...

3238
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:24,540
This is why we don't accept Wi-Fi matches.

3239
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:27,960
I've never had such bad connections before.

3240
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:30,980
Even against people in Asia!

3241
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:32,180
This guy is in America!

3242
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,440
This guy is in America!

3243
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:35,880
I would probably trust him.

3244
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:41,660
He's in America.

3245
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:43,560
How was I supposed to know?

3246
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:45,080
Don't worry.

3247
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:46,880
His PS4 is on the router.

3248
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,040
Oh my god.

3249
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:54,780
I can't even watch this without lagging.

3250
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:59,900
Your great training, but your Wi-Fi sucks.

3251
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:02,540
I can't deal with it.

3252
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,740
Do I have enough time to do another game or no?

3253
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,120
No idea.

3254
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:13,460
They were... they're still doing the second to last match.

3255
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:13,880
Oh, okay.

3256
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:14,740
I got into games.

3257
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:17,120
Oh, okay.

3258
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,580
I got into a game anyway.

3259
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:19,980
Yeah, yeah.

3260
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:20,280
You're good.

3261
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:22,560
I just beat BoxBox again on ranked.

3262
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:23,940
This is where it matters, actually.

3263
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:26,880
This is actually where it matters.

3264
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:28,980
I don't give a... I'm one and done.

3265
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:30,700
Slam points.

3266
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:32,280
I'm sorry.

3267
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:33,000
I have to go play.

3268
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:36,160
Yeah, rank points does not matter.

3269
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:38,500
I won and done them.

3270
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:39,060
I'm so sorry.

3271
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:43,660
I gotta... I gotta go play...

3272
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:44,720
Are we ready now?

3273
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:45,240
No.

3274
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,120
Oh, I thought we were...

3275
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:47,840
Wait, what?

3276
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:48,560
No, I'm saying...

3277
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:51,340
Infernosu is playing Cosmonaut and they are going...

3278
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:52,920
Oh, so they're not ready.

3279
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:53,620
Okay.

3280
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:55,400
Oh, I thought they were ready.

3281
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,540
I'm so sorry, BoxBox.

3282
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:57,480
I gotta send them out.

3283
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,520
Just be like, I thought we were ready.

3284
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:00,100
You're in tournament.

3285
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,880
Listen, you can one and done in tournament.

3286
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:02,540
That's fair game.

3287
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:03,200
Tournament day.

3288
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,660
Wait, who am I fighting on Shine's team?

3289
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:08,480
Boomy?

3290
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,680
That's the person below Infernosu?

3291
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:11,140
That's the Ed player.

3292
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:12,240
Okay.

3293
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,260
I think so.

3294
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:14,080
I think there's two Eds.

3295
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:14,100
No.

3296
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:14,300
Goodbye.

3297
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:20,580
I think Ana and Koyanagi are viking in two Eds, then Infernosu and Akuma.

3298
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,160
God and Shine.

3299
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,640
I have to learn to block again.

3300
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:30,580
I already forgot.

3301
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:32,520
I promise I don't one and done like that BoxBox.

3302
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:33,060
I promise.

3303
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:35,140
Just don't hate me.

3304
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:38,920
It's tournament day.

3305
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:39,400
It's necessary.

3306
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:44,280
Yeah, I was free to use the whole honorable box.

3307
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:48,980
Let's go coach!

3308
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:50,080
That's what I needed to hear!

3309
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:50,920
That shit goes out the window.

3310
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:52,420
Save it for tournament.

3311
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:54,260
That's why I'm here.

3312
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:54,660
Okay.

3313
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:55,360
I'm done.

3314
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:55,760
I'm down.

3315
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:57,760
Tournament day one is done.

3316
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,240
It's acceptable.

3317
02:04:59,140 --> 02:04:59,540
Yeah.

3318
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:01,120
Yeah.

3319
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:02,040
I agree.

3320
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:05,860
So they're going at it for Nasu.

3321
02:05:05,860 --> 02:05:06,800
I mean, that's a showdown.

3322
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:08,140
They didn't drag us.

3323
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:08,640
Cosmonaut won.

3324
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:09,940
Oh, he did?

3325
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:10,220
Yeah.

3326
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:13,700
They were struggling a little bit.

3327
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:14,920
But they were going the distance.

3328
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:16,840
Whose stream are you watching now?

3329
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,240
I'm just watching Shine's stream.

3330
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:19,660
Oh no!

3331
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:21,360
Flash.

3332
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:26,620
I think I just got the invite.

3333
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,560
Oh, okay.

3334
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:28,180
Good timing.

3335
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:28,980
Alright.

3336
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:33,040
So they're getting the lobby ready.

3337
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:33,820
But they still gotta play.

3338
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:36,180
Oh, wait.

3339
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:37,000
So they're still playing?

3340
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:38,420
I thought it was over.

3341
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:39,940
I don't think Shine's played JB yet.

3342
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:42,280
Is that a one more rank match?

3343
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:45,560
Is that a Rashid mirror?

3344
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:47,980
Do I get one more rank match?

3345
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:48,520
No.

3346
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:49,820
Shine plays Ed and Kimberly.

3347
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,560
I know him for Kimberly.

3348
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:53,480
I didn't know he was playing Ed.

3349
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:55,020
Are you watching the Ed thing?

3350
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:57,120
See what maybe... I don't know.

3351
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:57,700
See what he does.

3352
02:05:58,840 --> 02:05:59,240
Yeah.

3353
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:00,060
Let's take a look here.

3354
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:01,540
Is Kimberly good in this patch?

3355
02:06:02,380 --> 02:06:02,780
No.

3356
02:06:04,460 --> 02:06:05,700
She's like a counter pick character.

3357
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:08,500
She's a good tournament character too.

3358
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:09,680
She can just play super fast.

3359
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:12,160
She can just rush people down and rob them real quick.

3360
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:13,820
Is it...

3361
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:16,220
Should I just wait instead of playing another game?

3362
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:18,140
You can get like one game.

3363
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:18,540
Oh, okay.

3364
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,600
Yeah, we gotta go.

3365
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:21,320
Wow, addicted.

3366
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:22,400
Nice.

3367
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:28,080
Oh my god.

3368
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,900
I'm tired of the Street Fighter main menu music.

3369
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:32,580
Yeah, you gotta turn music off.

3370
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:35,400
Street Fighter 6 music is fucking ass.

3371
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:36,420
It's so bad.

3372
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:37,380
Yeah.

3373
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:39,880
Compared to Tekken, I agree.

3374
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:42,400
Tekken has the best.

3375
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:43,460
Yeah.

3376
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:45,640
I think...

3377
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:48,980
Dude, Street Fighter music has been sucking for the past like two installations.

3378
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:51,220
I think Street Fighter 4 music was sick.

3379
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:51,860
4 had great music.

3380
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,260
4 had fighting in Ed.

3381
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:56,580
4 and 5 were... I preferred 4, but I think 5 was still pretty good.

3382
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:58,380
A lot of people love 5, but 6 is...

3383
02:06:58,380 --> 02:07:00,100
It sounds like AI garbage.

3384
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,240
Like it's crazy how bad it is.

3385
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,400
It sounds machine generated.

3386
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:06,400
Okay, it doesn't look like...

3387
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:07,640
It doesn't look like he's doing any better.

3388
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:09,300
Shine?

3389
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:12,420
Because I feel like Rashid just does whatever he wants.

3390
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:14,160
But yeah, that's...

3391
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:16,880
The thing is, you guys can't judge anyone around like that.

3392
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:20,840
In Street Fighter, you just get fucking mauled unless you guess right, and then you maul them.

3393
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:23,080
It's a two-touch game, 100%.

3394
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:25,800
Yeah, not necessarily the touches, just the momentum also.

3395
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:29,260
Rashid doesn't really two-touch you, he just carries momentum forever and you're guessing.

3396
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:30,500
No way, man.

3397
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:31,160
Yeah.

3398
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:33,980
It's so normal to see someone get fucking mauled and then win.

3399
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:35,240
It's so...

3400
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:35,820
It just happens.

3401
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:39,340
Is Rashid arguably like top three or something?

3402
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:41,060
I think Rashid's number one.

3403
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:42,560
People will argue that.

3404
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:43,520
I think he's number one.

3405
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:46,760
Because I think he has extra mix that other characters don't have without meter.

3406
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:48,520
He can do things that other characters can't.

3407
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:50,160
And then level two is the best level two in the game.

3408
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:51,520
Agreed.

3409
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:54,700
See, he just got a bunch of plus frames for no fucking reason.

3410
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:55,620
You know what I mean?

3411
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:57,040
Other characters can't do this.

3412
02:07:58,980 --> 02:07:59,740
Why does he...

3413
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,440
Why can he do this?

3414
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,400
Because of DLC sales or what?

3415
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:03,420
Are they doing it like Tekken?

3416
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:05,220
He was like this in Street Fighter V also.

3417
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,600
Street Fighter V obviously.

3418
02:08:06,620 --> 02:08:09,260
I have PTSD from SFV, Rashid.

3419
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:10,660
Oh, nice level three.

3420
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:11,360
That was sick.

3421
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:15,020
You also did a cool one where they...

3422
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:16,720
You leveled one, I think.

3423
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:18,300
Yeah, for the DI.

3424
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:19,500
That's so hard.

3425
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:21,180
When you were stunned.

3426
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,960
Oh, he burned himself out.

3427
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:24,660
High level.

3428
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:26,460
Nice.

3429
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:26,840
Nice.

3430
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:30,960
This is actually a good spot for shine.

3431
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,040
Yep, that's it.

3432
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:37,860
That's crazy, man.

3433
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:39,140
That's how it is, right?

3434
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:44,140
He had to fucking scrap by nearly mauled Frio two rounds right there, right?

3435
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:44,900
Yeah.

3436
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:46,160
That's how this game is.

3437
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:49,460
It's so exhausting, I swear, man.

3438
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:51,520
I feel like it's all fighting games too.

3439
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:54,300
Tekken is so tiring too now with the heat stuff.

3440
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:56,440
I think that's like a lot of modern games.

3441
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:57,020
They're like that.

3442
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:58,440
They're so offensive.

3443
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:03,180
I play Street Fighter IV for like...

3444
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:05,220
I feel like I could play that for days.

3445
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:07,340
And not get tired.

3446
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:08,220
Oh, yeah.

3447
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:09,180
It depends on who you're playing.

3448
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:12,180
If you play like a good fucking Ibuki or some Viper, you're getting vortexed.

3449
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:13,640
I get what you're saying.

3450
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:14,320
I played Bison.

3451
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:16,440
I played Juri and Reina.

3452
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:19,860
I could play Reina all day, every day.

3453
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,320
I love Reina.

3454
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:24,980
Grinding a Mishima must be really fun, though.

3455
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:26,300
So fun.

3456
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:28,080
Wave-oo, wave-oo, wave-oo, electric.

3457
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:29,140
Wave-oo, wave-oo.

3458
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:34,500
Sidestep.

3459
02:09:34,860 --> 02:09:35,640
They combo.

3460
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:36,420
Hellsweep.

3461
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:37,960
Occasional hellsweep.

3462
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:39,640
Hellsweep, hellsweep, hellsweep.

3463
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:42,300
They never expect a third one in a row.

3464
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:45,420
That's so true, that's so true.

3465
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:46,740
Oh, god.

3466
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,620
Wait, I might...

3467
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:49,900
Oh, nice.

3468
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:52,840
Oh, damn, I do it.

3469
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,320
Uh-oh, coach.

3470
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:55,820
Check him out.

3471
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:57,500
Wait a minute.

3472
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:59,060
Oh, he got it.

3473
02:09:59,100 --> 02:09:59,820
Nice jump.

3474
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:00,760
Nice.

3475
02:10:01,820 --> 02:10:03,440
I felt like that was so obvious.

3476
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:05,260
The DI attempt.

3477
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:08,720
That might just be you.

3478
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:11,660
Sometimes it may look obvious, and sometimes it's the best DI ever.

3479
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,300
That's just me working.

3480
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:17,220
That is up a game, damn.

3481
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:18,900
Nice.

3482
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:23,140
So, Legend starts at 2,000 or what?

3483
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,300
No, no.

3484
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:25,220
It's the moving target.

3485
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:26,320
It's top 500.

3486
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:26,440
It's top 500.

3487
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:29,660
And the problem with that is, like, also, there's inflation.

3488
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,440
Japan has, like, all the points.

3489
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:35,620
So, like, these guys might not even be Legend towards the end of the season because there's not enough players.

3490
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:36,840
Oh, it's not region locked?

3491
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:44,160
No, so they compare you with the whole economy, with the world, and there's, like, 40,000 times more players in Japan.

3492
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:46,420
Can you imagine if that was Overwatch?

3493
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,440
That would be really dumb.

3494
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:54,360
So, at the end of the season, most NA players are not Legend because if they're in Asia, they would be.

3495
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:56,060
That backdash was sick.

3496
02:10:56,860 --> 02:10:58,960
Does Apex region lock it?

3497
02:10:59,340 --> 02:10:59,780
No.

3498
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:00,980
No, it doesn't.

3499
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:01,980
Apex, it doesn't.

3500
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:02,580
Oh, wow.

3501
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:02,820
Okay.

3502
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:06,760
Okay, so it's like Apex in a way.

3503
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:07,780
Wait, which one?

3504
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:10,520
Is it Bones or Claire's invite?

3505
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,800
I have two invites.

3506
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:12,660
I think it's Claire's.

3507
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:13,080
Is it Claire?

3508
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:14,020
Okay.

3509
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:14,620
I think so.

3510
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:18,820
I'm not in there because I'm watching the Shine match.

3511
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:21,940
Yeah, I think it's Claire's.

3512
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:22,780
Oh, yeah, I'm in it.

3513
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:25,260
We played this team, so you got time.

3514
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:26,780
Yeah, we played Shine, yeah.

3515
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:27,580
Okay.

3516
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:29,660
He meet frame 1, P1.

3517
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:30,140
Nice.

3518
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:32,320
That's great.

3519
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:39,000
I used to watch a lot of Shine for his Street Fighter 5 jury back when she was booty cheeks.

3520
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:41,080
Yeah, Shine's been godlike for a long time.

3521
02:11:44,020 --> 02:11:45,660
Wait, what's their points right now?

3522
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,420
Let's see.

3523
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:49,860
What's their points?

3524
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:53,800
Okay.

3525
02:11:56,440 --> 02:11:57,680
Oh, our team points?

3526
02:11:58,380 --> 02:11:59,620
It doesn't even tell me.

3527
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,220
I don't think... did they post our team points?

3528
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:05,200
There might be a form, but I don't know if it's updated.

3529
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:06,160
Oh, there's a score tracker.

3530
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:06,840
It's the news.

3531
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:08,440
Oh, is it?

3532
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:08,580
Okay.

3533
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:10,640
I don't know how to read this.

3534
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:14,080
I don't know how to read theory.

3535
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:15,740
Wow, this is looking like a wash, man.

3536
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:17,960
This is a lot of stuff.

3537
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:19,000
Wow.

3538
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:21,820
He did his thing.

3539
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:23,140
It was crazy.

3540
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:26,780
There's a current three-way tie at the moment.

3541
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,460
Three-way tie?

3542
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:28,040
Damn.

3543
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:29,280
By who?

3544
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:31,860
Us, JB, and Phone.

3545
02:12:32,820 --> 02:12:35,720
No, of course not, guys.

3546
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:36,300
We're last.

3547
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,680
What the fuck?

3548
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:44,260
Nephew is first.

3549
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:47,640
What the fuck, guys?

3550
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:49,340
So close.

3551
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:50,040
So close.

3552
02:12:51,940 --> 02:12:52,440
I should believe, dude.

3553
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:53,700
I'm on that copium right now.

3554
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:54,960
We're first, right?

3555
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:57,960
We're all tied for fourth, guys.

3556
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:01,160
Auto, Shine, and...

3557
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:03,040
It's Neph, then Auto, and Shine.

3558
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,720
Aren't we playing...

3559
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:07,180
Auto...

3560
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:09,000
Yeah, we're playing Auto and Shine.

3561
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,200
Okay.

3562
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:13,540
We're playing Auto and Shine next.

3563
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:16,860
Is that who we're tied with?

3564
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:18,820
No, we're tied with JB and Phone.

3565
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:20,400
Okay, okay, okay.

3566
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:22,180
We already played against them.

3567
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:25,340
They're playing against Auto and Shine next.

3568
02:13:30,690 --> 02:13:31,210
Got it.

3569
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:31,730
It's okay, guys.

3570
02:13:31,990 --> 02:13:35,230
Next Friday is where it matters, right?

3571
02:13:36,490 --> 02:13:38,110
We're all gonna grind so much.

3572
02:13:38,110 --> 02:13:39,290
Sunday is where it matters, dude.

3573
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:41,350
No, we want the...

3574
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:46,770
Okay, I don't know if we're gonna get the buy, but we want the better matchup.

3575
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:49,310
We want a buy.

3576
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:52,370
I think Nephew is definitely getting the buy.

3577
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:54,190
No, it's the exact same.

3578
02:13:54,490 --> 02:13:56,530
Yeah, so we play everybody on Friday again, right?

3579
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:57,990
It's worth more, though, the win.

3580
02:13:58,150 --> 02:13:58,850
Yeah, the five points.

3581
02:13:59,210 --> 02:13:59,610
Right.

3582
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:02,750
Which matters.

3583
02:14:04,030 --> 02:14:05,110
Yeah, for sure.

3584
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:07,110
Oh, no, I don't wanna leave.

3585
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:08,950
That was an accident.

3586
02:14:09,330 --> 02:14:10,210
Do I need to do a coin flip?

3587
02:14:11,130 --> 02:14:13,030
If they don't request for it...

3588
02:14:13,030 --> 02:14:14,310
Did they ask for it?

3589
02:14:15,010 --> 02:14:15,410
Where?

3590
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:17,770
Are you from North Carolina?

3591
02:14:18,710 --> 02:14:19,110
No.

3592
02:14:19,690 --> 02:14:20,750
That was random, though.

3593
02:14:21,150 --> 02:14:21,870
What do you mean?

3594
02:14:23,330 --> 02:14:29,470
I just see a lot of, like, UNC in your chat, so I don't know if you went to, like, University of North Carolina or something.

3595
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:31,370
Did you go to UNC?

3596
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:32,970
No, that's not why.

3597
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:35,850
Oh, oh, wait.

3598
02:14:35,890 --> 02:14:37,590
Oh, it took me a second.

3599
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:42,650
Oh, we can play one.

3600
02:14:42,730 --> 02:14:43,050
I'm in.

3601
02:14:44,450 --> 02:14:47,650
I just went to school there.

3602
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:49,150
I don't live there, though.

3603
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:50,510
Oh, okay.

3604
02:14:50,510 --> 02:14:52,710
I don't know if you're being serious.

3605
02:14:53,010 --> 02:14:53,670
Wait, did you really?

3606
02:14:56,350 --> 02:14:56,790
Oh.

3607
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:57,550
Alright.

3608
02:14:58,970 --> 02:15:00,110
I went to UNC.

3609
02:15:00,110 --> 02:15:03,210
I don't think I can do the thing I like to do the most.

3610
02:15:04,130 --> 02:15:05,370
I think they're trolling SK.

3611
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:06,870
I didn't get it.

3612
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:08,470
UNC is UNCLE?

3613
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:08,890
UNC?

3614
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:11,950
They're calling him UNCLE.

3615
02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:13,590
Oh, you're called UNCLE?

3616
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:14,210
Oh, shoot.

3617
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:14,630
My bad.

3618
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:16,030
No, yeah, yeah.

3619
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:17,530
I always wondered...

3620
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:19,550
I'm only 30, bro.

3621
02:15:20,710 --> 02:15:21,930
I mean, you could be an uncle.

3622
02:15:22,450 --> 02:15:23,490
I'm in my prime.

3623
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:25,370
My brother's younger than me.

3624
02:15:28,370 --> 02:15:28,910
Oh, what?

3625
02:15:29,090 --> 02:15:29,370
Oh, I thought it was a dodge.

3626
02:15:29,370 --> 02:15:30,670
That makes a lot more sense now.

3627
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:34,090
That was funny, though.

3628
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:36,290
Oh, I keep forgetting that doesn't do the thing.

3629
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:36,530
Oh, damn.

3630
02:15:39,130 --> 02:15:39,530
Sweep.

3631
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:46,030
Oh, they're jumping.

3632
02:15:46,290 --> 02:15:46,630
Yeah.

3633
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:49,930
I wanted to do the grab.

3634
02:15:50,110 --> 02:15:50,510
Yeah.

3635
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:53,710
That would have been sick.

3636
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:55,270
Nice.

3637
02:15:55,650 --> 02:15:56,450
What the fuck?

3638
02:15:56,450 --> 02:15:57,370
This is one bar.

3639
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:00,330
Time for the Doki Zeme.

3640
02:16:00,350 --> 02:16:02,170
I just realized I'm one bar.

3641
02:16:02,670 --> 02:16:03,450
Oh, nice.

3642
02:16:04,030 --> 02:16:04,750
Let's go.

3643
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:07,550
There's only one bar for this connection.

3644
02:16:08,630 --> 02:16:09,770
Oh, it's a one bar?

3645
02:16:09,890 --> 02:16:10,510
No shot.

3646
02:16:10,910 --> 02:16:13,350
There's only one bar for this.

3647
02:16:15,370 --> 02:16:15,950
It's okay.

3648
02:16:16,010 --> 02:16:16,690
You're playing GEEF.

3649
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:17,650
Just GEEF them.

3650
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:19,630
Let's go.

3651
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:21,570
They're not reacting in one bar Wi-Fi.

3652
02:16:23,150 --> 02:16:24,070
I don't know.

3653
02:16:24,550 --> 02:16:25,570
I'm not reacting.

3654
02:16:25,650 --> 02:16:26,110
Doki Zeme, let's go.

3655
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:28,470
Let's go.

3656
02:16:28,670 --> 02:16:30,050
Yeah, they're not ready for it.

3657
02:16:30,530 --> 02:16:31,270
Get them.

3658
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:32,350
Okay.

3659
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:36,630
Oh, they're doing the power move.

3660
02:16:36,850 --> 02:16:41,750
If he jumps at you, you can level three if he jumps at you.

3661
02:16:42,630 --> 02:16:43,850
Wait for it.

3662
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,670
Wait for it.

3663
02:16:45,370 --> 02:16:46,490
No, she's good.

3664
02:16:47,630 --> 02:16:48,190
You're good.

3665
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:50,390
I think she knows I want to do it.

3666
02:16:50,470 --> 02:16:50,930
That's why.

3667
02:16:51,810 --> 02:16:52,870
No, she don't.

3668
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:54,010
I got it.

3669
02:16:56,510 --> 02:16:58,510
My loyal fan.

3670
02:16:58,870 --> 02:16:59,970
Yo, jumps in.

3671
02:17:00,110 --> 02:17:00,890
I got it.

3672
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:02,530
Gigachat.

3673
02:17:03,070 --> 02:17:06,350
Wait, do we not have the NA restrictions for this one?

3674
02:17:11,970 --> 02:17:12,750
It's okay.

3675
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:13,530
Don't even worry about it.

3676
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:14,930
I'm just like, holy fuck.

3677
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:18,070
How do I process this?

3678
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:20,830
No, the adaptation.

3679
02:17:20,970 --> 02:17:22,250
I'm not good at that part.

3680
02:17:22,530 --> 02:17:22,810
Okay.

3681
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:24,490
Okay.

3682
02:17:24,510 --> 02:17:25,290
All right, all right.

3683
02:17:26,010 --> 02:17:27,450
Oh, she's jumping a lot.

3684
02:17:27,650 --> 02:17:28,350
I just noticed.

3685
02:17:29,010 --> 02:17:29,670
There you go.

3686
02:17:30,890 --> 02:17:31,270
Analyze.

3687
02:17:31,270 --> 02:17:31,650
There you go.

3688
02:17:34,730 --> 02:17:35,110
What?

3689
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:36,930
That was all.

3690
02:17:37,010 --> 02:17:37,850
That should have worked.

3691
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,190
It's the one bar.

3692
02:17:39,210 --> 02:17:40,270
I swear to God.

3693
02:17:40,310 --> 02:17:41,350
It's the one bar.

3694
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:44,310
It's the lag.

3695
02:17:44,610 --> 02:17:45,230
Blame the lag.

3696
02:17:46,970 --> 02:17:47,630
Blame the lag.

3697
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:50,730
Okay.

3698
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:51,050
Okay.

3699
02:17:51,150 --> 02:17:51,870
There you go.

3700
02:17:52,030 --> 02:17:52,590
Get him.

3701
02:17:53,750 --> 02:17:54,190
Okay.

3702
02:17:55,110 --> 02:17:55,550
Yes.

3703
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:56,390
Here we go.

3704
02:17:56,870 --> 02:17:57,310
Okay.

3705
02:17:59,570 --> 02:18:00,010
No.

3706
02:18:00,150 --> 02:18:00,570
Oh, what?

3707
02:18:01,370 --> 02:18:02,610
I thought I blocked it.

3708
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:03,750
Is that an overhead?

3709
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:06,170
I think it is.

3710
02:18:06,330 --> 02:18:06,350
It's an overhead.

3711
02:18:07,050 --> 02:18:07,490
Okay.

3712
02:18:11,270 --> 02:18:12,550
Now that I know.

3713
02:18:15,070 --> 02:18:15,510
Okay.

3714
02:18:16,650 --> 02:18:17,090
Nice.

3715
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:18,670
You're cracked.

3716
02:18:18,990 --> 02:18:20,910
That was so good.

3717
02:18:24,210 --> 02:18:24,970
Cook him up.

3718
02:18:25,950 --> 02:18:27,670
Listen, it's nothing compared to Weed God.

3719
02:18:27,970 --> 02:18:28,930
Oh, that's true.

3720
02:18:29,850 --> 02:18:31,190
Weed God had Wi-Fi.

3721
02:18:31,890 --> 02:18:32,730
Oh, man.

3722
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:34,970
I think she gets this.

3723
02:18:35,190 --> 02:18:36,010
There's no way I live.

3724
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:36,610
Yeah.

3725
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:38,330
I think you're dead.

3726
02:18:40,170 --> 02:18:40,790
All right.

3727
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:41,130
Here we go.

3728
02:18:41,510 --> 02:18:42,210
1-1.

3729
02:18:42,350 --> 02:18:44,250
I don't think I can Larry it against...

3730
02:18:44,250 --> 02:18:45,030
I don't know.

3731
02:18:45,150 --> 02:18:46,330
I may be timing it wrong.

3732
02:18:48,930 --> 02:18:50,410
I could be timing it wrong.

3733
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:52,310
All right.

3734
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:55,790
Oh.

3735
02:18:57,010 --> 02:18:57,910
Yeah, it's tricky.

3736
02:18:58,070 --> 02:18:59,470
They can go other sides.

3737
02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:00,470
Nice.

3738
02:19:02,430 --> 02:19:02,910
Let's go.

3739
02:19:04,130 --> 02:19:04,570
Okay.

3740
02:19:05,550 --> 02:19:07,030
I know she jumps a lot.

3741
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:09,190
Adapting.

3742
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:09,610
Okay.

3743
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:12,130
I know I can hit that.

3744
02:19:14,310 --> 02:19:15,690
But I can't hit the Lariat.

3745
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:20,250
Do I have enough?

3746
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:20,550
No.

3747
02:19:20,630 --> 02:19:20,870
No.

3748
02:19:20,870 --> 02:19:21,390
Larry it?

3749
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:22,750
No.

3750
02:19:22,910 --> 02:19:23,670
He doesn't have the Lariat.

3751
02:19:24,370 --> 02:19:24,890
Almost.

3752
02:19:25,170 --> 02:19:25,470
Almost.

3753
02:19:25,590 --> 02:19:26,090
Okay.

3754
02:19:28,970 --> 02:19:29,490
Okay.

3755
02:19:31,870 --> 02:19:32,390
Okay.

3756
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:33,330
Nice.

3757
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:33,810
Cook him up.

3758
02:19:33,810 --> 02:19:34,070
Nice.

3759
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:34,690
Cook him up.

3760
02:19:37,690 --> 02:19:38,990
Do I get that?

3761
02:19:39,010 --> 02:19:39,370
Yes.

3762
02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:39,790
Okay.

3763
02:19:40,410 --> 02:19:41,490
I get that.

3764
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:42,490
That's my goat.

3765
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:43,970
I am almighty.

3766
02:19:44,510 --> 02:19:44,910
Holy.

3767
02:19:50,570 --> 02:19:50,970
No.

3768
02:19:51,130 --> 02:19:52,110
I pressed the triangle.

3769
02:19:53,010 --> 02:19:53,610
It's okay.

3770
02:19:53,790 --> 02:19:53,890
Yeah.

3771
02:19:54,070 --> 02:19:56,350
It was a misinput.

3772
02:19:56,450 --> 02:19:57,530
It was misinput.

3773
02:19:58,310 --> 02:19:59,270
They have no meter.

3774
02:19:59,330 --> 02:19:59,710
It's okay.

3775
02:19:59,770 --> 02:20:00,270
We take those.

3776
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:01,710
Okay.

3777
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:02,650
Yeah.

3778
02:20:02,710 --> 02:20:03,050
You're good.

3779
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:04,310
You're a tank.

3780
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:05,930
Oh.

3781
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:09,990
Okay.

3782
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:10,290
Okay.

3783
02:20:10,850 --> 02:20:11,630
That's crazy.

3784
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:12,950
I don't even get it.

3785
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:14,250
I don't even get it.

3786
02:20:14,370 --> 02:20:15,950
I'm actually freaking out.

3787
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:18,270
Because he jumps a lot.

3788
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:23,330
Almost.

3789
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:24,050
Almost again.

3790
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:24,850
Did you?

3791
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:25,770
Oh my god.

3792
02:20:25,930 --> 02:20:26,670
That was insane.

3793
02:20:27,510 --> 02:20:29,010
That was crazy dude.

3794
02:20:29,870 --> 02:20:30,490
Nice anti.

3795
02:20:30,490 --> 02:20:31,190
Out of the air.

3796
02:20:31,230 --> 02:20:31,450
Nice.

3797
02:20:31,690 --> 02:20:32,550
Here we go.

3798
02:20:32,590 --> 02:20:32,930
Here we go.

3799
02:20:33,090 --> 02:20:33,710
Get him.

3800
02:20:34,010 --> 02:20:34,490
Yeah.

3801
02:20:35,650 --> 02:20:36,510
Nice Lariat.

3802
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:37,290
Let's go get him.

3803
02:20:37,370 --> 02:20:38,010
Can I get this?

3804
02:20:38,810 --> 02:20:39,250
No.

3805
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:41,430
That should have been a hit.

3806
02:20:41,450 --> 02:20:42,350
A little too early.

3807
02:20:43,470 --> 02:20:44,010
That's alright.

3808
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:44,530
Very close.

3809
02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:46,230
You have the game point.

3810
02:20:52,090 --> 02:20:52,530
Yeah.

3811
02:20:53,910 --> 02:20:54,350
Okay.

3812
02:20:59,390 --> 02:20:59,830
Nice.

3813
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:03,960
Okay.

3814
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,900
Oh my god.

3815
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:07,260
These air tires are crazy.

3816
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:07,980
Cook up.

3817
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:08,480
Cook him up.

3818
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:08,640
Go.

3819
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:09,880
Okay.

3820
02:21:15,540 --> 02:21:16,040
Man.

3821
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:17,280
Don't keep...

3822
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:18,060
This is neutral.

3823
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:21,460
She does this thing.

3824
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:22,600
Which is really...

3825
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:25,480
Nice.

3826
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:26,360
Yes.

3827
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:27,060
Yep.

3828
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:27,900
Grounded.

3829
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:28,780
Yes.

3830
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:30,020
Trying.

3831
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:31,840
Oh my day.

3832
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:32,860
Okay.

3833
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:37,820
Yes.

3834
02:21:37,820 --> 02:21:39,380
Nice anti air.

3835
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:40,260
Oh my god.

3836
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:41,700
She has critical art.

3837
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:44,080
Okay.

3838
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:45,920
Be careful.

3839
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:47,760
I got it.

3840
02:21:48,420 --> 02:21:49,080
Let's go.

3841
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:50,800
Oh.

3842
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:54,520
Technically I'm gold.

3843
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:56,840
I mean I'm gold so I'm gold.

3844
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:57,860
You're gold.

3845
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:01,020
That was actually neutral.

3846
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:01,640
You're right.

3847
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:02,520
I'm gold rank.

3848
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:03,100
That was neutral.

3849
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:04,220
You were playing neutral.

3850
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:05,760
That was neutral.

3851
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:07,760
How do you...

3852
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:13,360
I almost fell over my chair.

3853
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:14,340
With those air command.

3854
02:22:14,380 --> 02:22:17,220
I can't do the lariat.

3855
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:18,800
But I can do air command.

3856
02:22:19,060 --> 02:22:19,300
Dude.

3857
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:21,280
You did the lariat too.

3858
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:23,520
Yeah.

3859
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:26,860
Dude you're cooking dude.

3860
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:28,120
They're not ready for Friday.

3861
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:31,960
Now she'll never jump when she fights me.

3862
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:32,620
What do I do?

3863
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:35,040
Alright SK.

3864
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:37,740
What do I do when she doesn't jump?

3865
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:39,860
What do I do when she doesn't jump?

3866
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:40,760
You win either way.

3867
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:42,840
Alright.

3868
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:44,920
Thank you Justin.

3869
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:45,920
I did it.

3870
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:48,700
Even if we don't get it it's fine.

3871
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:49,880
Yeah.

3872
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:49,980
Yeah.

3873
02:22:49,980 --> 02:22:50,160
No.

3874
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:51,640
That's okay.

3875
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:52,820
It'll be funny if we don't get it.

3876
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:53,280
If we don't get it.

3877
02:22:56,500 --> 02:22:57,400
It's for content.

3878
02:22:57,560 --> 02:22:57,800
You know.

3879
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:00,840
This is the learning ground Robin.

3880
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
We're throwing for content.

3881
02:23:03,140 --> 02:23:03,360
It's fine.

3882
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:03,780
Yeah.

3883
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:04,020
Yeah.

3884
02:23:04,060 --> 02:23:04,400
We're throwing.

3885
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:07,100
Yeah.

3886
02:23:07,240 --> 02:23:08,860
I wasn't even trying guys.

3887
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,320
Oh nice DI.

3888
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:13,560
Bleem.

3889
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:15,720
Oh here we go.

3890
02:23:15,860 --> 02:23:16,240
Nice.

3891
02:23:20,430 --> 02:23:21,550
Oh she uses an ED.

3892
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:22,090
Interesting.

3893
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:23,930
They have two EDs.

3894
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:26,010
Oh they do.

3895
02:23:26,170 --> 02:23:26,350
Yeah.

3896
02:23:26,490 --> 02:23:27,930
Oh the coach uses an ED.

3897
02:23:28,010 --> 02:23:29,870
They all wanted to play Shion's character.

3898
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:32,090
Oh really?

3899
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:32,910
That's so funny.

3900
02:23:35,470 --> 02:23:36,590
Don't worry it's Composure.

3901
02:23:42,470 --> 02:23:42,950
Okay.

3902
02:23:43,850 --> 02:23:44,750
What the hell?

3903
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:45,990
Yeah it's Modern.

3904
02:23:47,210 --> 02:23:48,090
Oh I see.

3905
02:23:48,110 --> 02:23:48,530
Oh man.

3906
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:51,210
Yeah their anti-airs are gonna be really good.

3907
02:23:51,370 --> 02:23:51,790
Oh my god.

3908
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:53,250
It's okay.

3909
02:23:53,330 --> 02:23:54,190
It's time to learn Modern.

3910
02:23:54,410 --> 02:23:55,410
It's time.

3911
02:23:56,990 --> 02:23:57,470
Modern.

3912
02:23:58,290 --> 02:24:00,330
Isn't Nephew Modern Jurgie?

3913
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:01,650
No.

3914
02:24:01,690 --> 02:24:02,070
No.

3915
02:24:02,070 --> 02:24:02,290
No.

3916
02:24:02,510 --> 02:24:03,410
He's Class A.

3917
02:24:03,410 --> 02:24:03,650
Okay.

3918
02:24:13,310 --> 02:24:14,090
Nice.

3919
02:24:14,490 --> 02:24:15,470
Good defense.

3920
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:16,110
Nice.

3921
02:24:19,270 --> 02:24:20,050
Nice.

3922
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:21,790
Oh nice.

3923
02:24:21,850 --> 02:24:22,450
That's good.

3924
02:24:22,450 --> 02:24:22,810
Good recognition.

3925
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:27,880
Almost there.

3926
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:30,060
Oh.

3927
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:31,900
She's wave dashing.

3928
02:24:32,100 --> 02:24:33,300
Oh yeah.

3929
02:24:33,580 --> 02:24:37,960
Oh that's

3930
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:43,400
a good combo.

3931
02:24:45,580 --> 02:24:46,940
Deliver Modern you.

3932
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:48,800
Oh my goodness.

3933
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:49,440
I can't jump.

3934
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:52,960
Yeah jumping's not gonna be good against Modern players.

3935
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,520
You saw what happened to Kanna.

3936
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:57,980
Yeah.

3937
02:24:59,480 --> 02:24:59,980
Nice.

3938
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:03,400
Okay.

3939
02:25:03,700 --> 02:25:03,900
Okay.

3940
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:05,160
Nice.

3941
02:25:05,980 --> 02:25:07,440
Nice wake up.

3942
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:07,860
Let's go.

3943
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:10,660
That's my Grand Master Lucio.

3944
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:13,480
You're getting there.

3945
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:14,140
You're getting there.

3946
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:18,420
Oh wow.

3947
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:20,820
Oh my god.

3948
02:25:20,860 --> 02:25:21,540
I won two rounds.

3949
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,740
I think I beat my record from the last AJM.

3950
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:27,200
Maybe you don't hate Street Fighter.

3951
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:29,300
Maybe you don't hate it.

3952
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:31,240
I'm still drinking tonight.

3953
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:34,600
Okay.

3954
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:35,000
Composure.

3955
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:35,380
You're good.

3956
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:36,200
Go live.

3957
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:43,520
Probably the best level 3 in the game.

3958
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,700
It's so cool looking.

3959
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:48,120
Yeah it's alright.

3960
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:48,640
It's alright.

3961
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:49,480
You almost.

3962
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:52,360
Is there one more round?

3963
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:55,660
You can be more confident with the drive rushes.

3964
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:56,520
Drive rush medium.

3965
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:57,800
Drive rush overhead.

3966
02:25:58,260 --> 02:26:00,800
The jumping is not too good.

3967
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:01,960
Against Ed.

3968
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:03,600
I'm doing something.

3969
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:05,580
What's that?

3970
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:06,580
You're going Chun.

3971
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:10,140
Oh they're not expecting this.

3972
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:13,000
You should do Modern Chun Li.

3973
02:26:15,220 --> 02:26:15,740
Alright.

3974
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:17,540
Cook them up SK.

3975
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:17,980
Let's go.

3976
02:26:18,740 --> 02:26:20,160
Two hours of grinding.

3977
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:23,340
Time for some safe John.

3978
02:26:23,460 --> 02:26:24,460
I have to spectate again.

3979
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:26,600
Why doesn't it automatically...

3980
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:27,220
Alright.

3981
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:31,160
Because Capcom is too busy giving us Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

3982
02:26:32,220 --> 02:26:34,200
Don't question Street Fighter developers man.

3983
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:35,620
You'll never find any answers.

3984
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:39,200
Oh nice.

3985
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:39,980
Nice costume.

3986
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:41,820
Oh shit the match started.

3987
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:45,220
That's what we were just talking about.

3988
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:46,060
Yeah dude.

3989
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:47,380
I stowed out there.

3990
02:26:50,180 --> 02:26:51,460
There we go.

3991
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:53,260
Ready for the speed guys.

3992
02:26:55,540 --> 02:26:56,080
Oh.

3993
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:57,860
Oh wait a minute.

3994
02:26:58,100 --> 02:26:58,940
We gotta strat.

3995
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,080
Oh my god.

3996
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:04,780
Oh I did the jury combo instead.

3997
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:05,820
It's fine.

3998
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:08,000
You're cooking them up.

3999
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:10,520
He was not prepared.

4000
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:12,220
Okay.

4001
02:27:16,700 --> 02:27:17,180
No.

4002
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:17,680
Okay.

4003
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:18,480
Nice.

4004
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:19,580
Correct.

4005
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:20,680
Let's go.

4006
02:27:22,820 --> 02:27:27,060
Is Chun-Li like the counter pick to Ed?

4007
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:30,420
If it's working here then yes.

4008
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:31,880
It's a mental counter pick.

4009
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:32,620
It's a mental.

4010
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:33,060
Oh okay.

4011
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:34,620
Yeah they've been watching VODs of...

4012
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:35,740
It could be a counter pick if she doesn't know.

4013
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:40,000
Yeah they've been watching VODs of SK playing Jury but not Chun-Li.

4014
02:27:40,620 --> 02:27:41,360
That's fine.

4015
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:42,620
You got the reset with the graph.

4016
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:45,540
Nice.

4017
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:46,520
Oh nice.

4018
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:48,220
Let's go.

4019
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:49,860
Another reset.

4020
02:27:49,940 --> 02:27:50,380
You're cooking.

4021
02:27:51,800 --> 02:27:52,400
It's okay.

4022
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:53,060
No problem.

4023
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:56,640
Maybe we should ask Huntress to coach you too.

4024
02:28:01,240 --> 02:28:02,740
The plan still works.

4025
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:05,080
Okay.

4026
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:05,740
There we go.

4027
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:06,120
Oh nice.

4028
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:06,360
Nice.

4029
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:10,080
Got the lifeline.

4030
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:10,480
No worries.

4031
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:17,940
This is neutral.

4032
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:18,820
By the way.

4033
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:19,560
Which one?

4034
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:20,120
Which part?

4035
02:28:20,480 --> 02:28:21,480
This right here.

4036
02:28:24,700 --> 02:28:25,660
Good defense.

4037
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:26,540
Nice.

4038
02:28:26,980 --> 02:28:27,580
Let's go.

4039
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:31,460
Confidence and control.

4040
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:32,660
Yes.

4041
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:34,860
You can tell you're more confident.

4042
02:28:35,740 --> 02:28:36,300
Let's go.

4043
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:38,600
She does that wake up EX reversal a lot.

4044
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:38,980
It's unsafe.

4045
02:28:40,460 --> 02:28:40,700
I hate it.

4046
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:41,980
That's Ed's DP.

4047
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:44,380
You can do your safe jump combo there.

4048
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:47,920
Oh.

4049
02:28:48,340 --> 02:28:48,780
Okay.

4050
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:49,080
That's fine.

4051
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:55,520
Yes.

4052
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:56,400
Nice.

4053
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:57,440
Reversal.

4054
02:28:57,440 --> 02:28:58,100
That was really good.

4055
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:06,000
Nice.

4056
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:07,020
Nice.

4057
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:08,060
Oh nice.

4058
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:09,860
Get him.

4059
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:11,120
Get him.

4060
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:11,600
Yeah.

4061
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:16,620
Okay.

4062
02:29:16,620 --> 02:29:17,060
Composure.

4063
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:17,560
We're good.

4064
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:20,200
Okay.

4065
02:29:21,580 --> 02:29:22,060
Oh.

4066
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:23,560
That was close.

4067
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:25,080
That was a good jump back.

4068
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:25,440
No worries.

4069
02:29:25,780 --> 02:29:28,660
Could have gone either way.

4070
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:30,240
Yes.

4071
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:30,760
This is close.

4072
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:31,420
This is really close.

4073
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:35,960
Maybe you should learn two characters.

4074
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:38,520
That's impressive.

4075
02:29:43,710 --> 02:29:44,190
Okay.

4076
02:29:44,410 --> 02:29:44,590
Okay.

4077
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:50,680
Oh.

4078
02:29:58,760 --> 02:29:59,240
Nice.

4079
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:00,360
Oh.

4080
02:30:00,420 --> 02:30:01,000
Just blocking.

4081
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:01,680
Oops.

4082
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:03,080
Okay.

4083
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:04,400
Oh.

4084
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:05,680
Nice.

4085
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:07,680
Let's go.

4086
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:10,720
Oh.

4087
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:11,380
It's alright.

4088
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:15,080
No.

4089
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:15,820
It's not today.

4090
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:18,240
Is she alive?

4091
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:19,060
Sounds like an asshole.

4092
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:21,600
Sounds like a cop.

4093
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:22,780
Sounds like a cop.

4094
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:32,000
What an anti-air actually.

4095
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:32,580
Okay.

4096
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:33,040
Oh.

4097
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:33,560
Nice.

4098
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:35,520
Here we go.

4099
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:35,620
Let's go.

4100
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:38,580
Okay.

4101
02:30:45,530 --> 02:30:46,170
Oh.

4102
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:48,570
Oh.

4103
02:30:48,850 --> 02:30:49,490
Let's go.

4104
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:49,670
Nice.

4105
02:30:49,990 --> 02:30:50,390
Nice.

4106
02:30:50,470 --> 02:30:51,330
That's insane.

4107
02:30:52,650 --> 02:30:53,290
Composure.

4108
02:30:53,370 --> 02:30:53,770
Here we go.

4109
02:31:21,910 --> 02:31:22,550
Oh.

4110
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:23,510
That was nice.

4111
02:31:23,510 --> 02:31:24,250
She's cooking.

4112
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:26,210
Nice.

4113
02:31:26,830 --> 02:31:27,370
Let's go.

4114
02:31:27,530 --> 02:31:27,870
Get him.

4115
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:28,490
Nice defense.

4116
02:31:28,690 --> 02:31:29,070
Nice defense.

4117
02:31:29,690 --> 02:31:30,130
Yep.

4118
02:31:30,210 --> 02:31:30,970
You have a level three.

4119
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:33,670
Let's go.

4120
02:31:33,990 --> 02:31:34,430
Nice.

4121
02:31:34,470 --> 02:31:34,790
Nice.

4122
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:35,450
Get him.

4123
02:31:35,610 --> 02:31:36,050
Nice.

4124
02:31:36,110 --> 02:31:36,510
Yes.

4125
02:31:37,310 --> 02:31:38,330
Let's fucking go.

4126
02:31:40,170 --> 02:31:40,730
That's it.

4127
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:41,730
Let's go.

4128
02:31:42,650 --> 02:31:43,210
Let's go.

4129
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:44,290
Good job.

4130
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:45,830
Oh my god.

4131
02:31:45,910 --> 02:31:47,210
The Chun-Li swap.

4132
02:31:48,050 --> 02:31:49,130
I told you.

4133
02:31:49,170 --> 02:31:50,610
You practiced that save jump.

4134
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:52,370
I told you that shit would just loop on you.

4135
02:31:52,370 --> 02:31:53,530
You got it.

4136
02:31:53,690 --> 02:31:54,810
That was insane.

4137
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:56,070
Dude.

4138
02:31:56,090 --> 02:31:58,130
You are nutty.

4139
02:31:58,390 --> 02:31:59,970
I had to use the bathroom.

4140
02:32:00,210 --> 02:32:01,230
But I was like...

4141
02:32:02,210 --> 02:32:04,110
What's the point of moving over lights?

4142
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:06,030
While I was pissed and I was watching.

4143
02:32:06,110 --> 02:32:07,350
I'm like this shit is crazy.

4144
02:32:09,290 --> 02:32:09,730
Damn.

4145
02:32:09,730 --> 02:32:10,110
Let's go.

4146
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:10,410
Let's go.

4147
02:32:10,610 --> 02:32:10,910
Damn.

4148
02:32:10,970 --> 02:32:13,750
I didn't know how to leave because I've never won so I left the room.

4149
02:32:16,170 --> 02:32:17,290
Your first win.

4150
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:19,510
Let's go.

4151
02:32:19,510 --> 02:32:22,390
My entire chat is thanking you SK for the channel points.

4152
02:32:22,890 --> 02:32:23,450
Let's go.

4153
02:32:23,730 --> 02:32:24,370
That was beautiful.

4154
02:32:24,970 --> 02:32:26,330
Exactly what you practiced.

4155
02:32:26,430 --> 02:32:27,070
That was awesome.

4156
02:32:28,030 --> 02:32:29,030
That was nutty.

4157
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:31,250
I don't think they were ready for a save jump in C2.

4158
02:32:32,570 --> 02:32:33,690
That was crazy.

4159
02:32:34,130 --> 02:32:35,170
Oh my god.

4160
02:32:35,310 --> 02:32:36,130
I cannot believe it.

4161
02:32:36,130 --> 02:32:39,710
And then when they blocked it you did the fireball instead of the save jump again.

4162
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:40,310
The combo.

4163
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:41,630
I saw that SK.

4164
02:32:41,710 --> 02:32:42,190
That was clean.

4165
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:44,290
I saw the high level play there.

4166
02:32:44,790 --> 02:32:47,190
I think you are supposed to be playing Hag-Li SK.

4167
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:47,570
Oops.

4168
02:32:49,870 --> 02:32:50,510
Oh shit.

4169
02:32:50,590 --> 02:32:51,790
How are you burned out?

4170
02:32:51,910 --> 02:32:53,250
I don't know what happened.

4171
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:55,890
What happened?

4172
02:32:56,030 --> 02:32:56,870
I don't know.

4173
02:32:58,310 --> 02:33:01,570
The match fast forwarded and you were burned out in 10 seconds.

4174
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:02,170
Oh wait.

4175
02:33:02,290 --> 02:33:02,890
Oh my god.

4176
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:03,250
I missed it.

4177
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,690
He's fine.

4178
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:07,070
He's fine.

4179
02:33:07,390 --> 02:33:08,270
No you got those.

4180
02:33:08,590 --> 02:33:10,370
Did I burn out again?

4181
02:33:10,830 --> 02:33:11,870
I didn't see it guys.

4182
02:33:11,990 --> 02:33:12,270
It's okay.

4183
02:33:12,370 --> 02:33:13,810
Screw it dude for your loyal fans.

4184
02:33:14,510 --> 02:33:15,870
Did he win or no?

4185
02:33:16,610 --> 02:33:17,350
He did.

4186
02:33:17,410 --> 02:33:17,770
Okay.

4187
02:33:19,510 --> 02:33:19,950
I need the meter.

4188
02:33:20,830 --> 02:33:21,870
Dragon Ball Z 2.

4189
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:31,280
Nice.

4190
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:34,000
Wait why does this team have all adds?

4191
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:37,140
There's a lot of adds actually.

4192
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:37,420
Yeah.

4193
02:33:37,460 --> 02:33:37,820
Yeah.

4194
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:37,900
Yeah.

4195
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:43,020
Shouldn't you be coaching these guys?

4196
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,160
And they all want to learn the level 2 combo.

4197
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:48,420
You want your team to play different characters.

4198
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:49,460
Not the same one.

4199
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:50,100
Wait really?

4200
02:33:52,180 --> 02:33:54,120
That's not true because Brapo and I we won.

4201
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:55,400
And we were all the same tier.

4202
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:57,180
Oh you're right.

4203
02:33:58,980 --> 02:34:00,320
Yeah but we did this as a team.

4204
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:01,380
King is very special too.

4205
02:34:02,660 --> 02:34:03,600
He's a special boy.

4206
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:05,960
Oh okay.

4207
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:07,960
Come on Brapo.

4208
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:09,180
Nice.

4209
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:11,040
Nice.

4210
02:34:12,820 --> 02:34:14,720
Brother you're about to go undefeated today.

4211
02:34:14,820 --> 02:34:15,260
That's crazy.

4212
02:34:15,260 --> 02:34:15,740
Oh my god.

4213
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:17,560
What do you mean?

4214
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:20,640
I'm going to check in Roy.

4215
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:23,280
He's always talking about this Roy motherfucker.

4216
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:23,980
Like who cares?

4217
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:25,260
No Roy is good bro.

4218
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:27,720
He saw him in Tekken.

4219
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:29,960
You should have seen him in Tekken.

4220
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:31,500
It was not fun.

4221
02:34:32,840 --> 02:34:35,020
He's like in the discord like bro Roy.

4222
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:35,800
You got to look up Roy.

4223
02:34:36,940 --> 02:34:37,420
Okay.

4224
02:34:38,060 --> 02:34:39,840
Roy is also undefeated.

4225
02:34:39,980 --> 02:34:42,200
So like one of you guys will be defeated.

4226
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:43,680
You burned out.

4227
02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:46,640
Are you just fucking with him with the burnout?

4228
02:34:46,940 --> 02:34:48,300
He's definitely fucking with him.

4229
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:50,640
He doesn't care dude.

4230
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:52,040
He's going to burn out no matter what.

4231
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:52,860
That's so toxic.

4232
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:53,880
I saw that.

4233
02:34:55,940 --> 02:34:57,420
That's so toxic.

4234
02:34:58,220 --> 02:34:58,800
That's so toxic.

4235
02:34:58,800 --> 02:34:58,980
Holy shit.

4236
02:34:59,460 --> 02:35:01,120
Oh man it's styling right now.

4237
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:02,860
Wait dude.

4238
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:05,720
You know like the down O.

4239
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,440
I don't play modern.

4240
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:09,280
What are you talking about?

4241
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:10,100
Holy shit.

4242
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:12,400
Holy fuck.

4243
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:14,760
You know if you want to BM.

4244
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:21,440
She's notating in Sony bro.

4245
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:22,240
That's crazy.

4246
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:25,320
I can only read in controller symbols.

4247
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:27,980
I can't read in anything else.

4248
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:29,440
Yeah do that.

4249
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:30,480
That's it.

4250
02:35:30,540 --> 02:35:30,660
That's it.

4251
02:35:30,860 --> 02:35:31,600
You got these?

4252
02:35:34,320 --> 02:35:35,580
Okay here we go.

4253
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:36,460
Oh nice.

4254
02:35:37,160 --> 02:35:37,920
Okay nice.

4255
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:39,820
Empty jumper.

4256
02:35:43,560 --> 02:35:44,300
Let's go.

4257
02:35:44,340 --> 02:35:44,820
Let's go.

4258
02:35:46,140 --> 02:35:47,220
Somebody ban that guy.

4259
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:51,760
This is not toxic.

4260
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:53,000
It's just FGC.

4261
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:54,800
American reset.

4262
02:35:55,220 --> 02:35:57,360
This guy is trying to fight me man.

4263
02:35:58,060 --> 02:35:59,320
He's trying to fight me.

4264
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:01,140
Bro he's stepping up for his bro dude.

4265
02:36:01,140 --> 02:36:03,940
You should fight Bra Pro and then if he wins he gets to fight Ko.

4266
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:05,500
Oh I like that.

4267
02:36:06,780 --> 02:36:07,960
I don't want to queue up.

4268
02:36:08,060 --> 02:36:08,500
Akuma time.

4269
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:09,960
Sorry I queued up.

4270
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:11,400
But I'm also spectating.

4271
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:14,320
This privileged old man.

4272
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:15,120
I swear to god.

4273
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:18,300
Oh my god did I break Kanna's win streak?

4274
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:19,620
Oh my god I did.

4275
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:21,280
I'm looking at the scores.

4276
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:24,300
Yeah she won every game except for me.

4277
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:25,600
Let's go.

4278
02:36:25,820 --> 02:36:27,540
It's the power of Gief let me tell you dude.

4279
02:36:27,880 --> 02:36:28,840
Let's fucking go.

4280
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:31,340
Bro he broke my retri.

4281
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:36,800
Did that fast forward happen?

4282
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:37,360
Yeah.

4283
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:39,100
I love the fast forward.

4284
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:40,660
The coefficient just beating ass.

4285
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:42,080
Yeah that's perfect.

4286
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:45,480
There we go.

4287
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:47,860
Nice hug.

4288
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:49,480
That was cheap.

4289
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:50,480
That was hot.

4290
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:52,460
That was hot?

4291
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:53,940
I'll do that more for you.

4292
02:36:54,860 --> 02:36:55,860
No don't.

4293
02:36:55,960 --> 02:36:57,920
Every time you style you lose.

4294
02:36:58,760 --> 02:37:00,040
Just play to win.

4295
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:01,600
But I wanna style.

4296
02:37:01,860 --> 02:37:02,440
Play to win.

4297
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:05,360
That perfect is pretty stylish man.

4298
02:37:05,420 --> 02:37:05,860
I don't know.

4299
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:07,420
Oh my god.

4300
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:08,160
Stop styling.

4301
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,240
Nice safe jump yeah.

4302
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:14,880
Don't worry about it.

4303
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:17,760
Nice.

4304
02:37:17,820 --> 02:37:18,160
Nice.

4305
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:19,280
Get ready for the anti-airs.

4306
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:24,000
Oh that's a good combo.

4307
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:24,480
One more.

4308
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:28,200
He went for it.

4309
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:29,920
You're styling.

4310
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:30,780
I see you styling.

4311
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:32,600
That was for SK dude.

4312
02:37:32,860 --> 02:37:33,900
He was doing it for SK yeah.

4313
02:37:40,890 --> 02:37:42,230
What is she parrying?

4314
02:37:43,510 --> 02:37:44,170
Uh oh.

4315
02:37:44,730 --> 02:37:45,870
Her webs dude.

4316
02:37:46,970 --> 02:37:47,670
Oh okay.

4317
02:37:48,170 --> 02:37:48,710
Uh oh.

4318
02:37:49,890 --> 02:37:51,650
Time for a wake up situation.

4319
02:37:51,950 --> 02:37:53,470
You know what I'm gonna do something here.

4320
02:37:54,110 --> 02:37:56,270
Oh my god he's gonna wake up level 3.

4321
02:37:56,330 --> 02:37:57,150
And it's not gonna work.

4322
02:37:57,590 --> 02:37:58,930
It's not gonna work.

4323
02:38:02,570 --> 02:38:03,930
Alright it's gonna work dude.

4324
02:38:08,090 --> 02:38:09,770
All this shot right there.

4325
02:38:10,770 --> 02:38:11,290
Bing.

4326
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:12,690
Bing.

4327
02:38:14,370 --> 02:38:14,890
Farewell.

4328
02:38:15,110 --> 02:38:16,610
Dude I love this character.

4329
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:17,570
This character is so sick.

4330
02:38:17,810 --> 02:38:18,970
Oh my god.

4331
02:38:19,770 --> 02:38:20,990
Can she do that to me?

4332
02:38:21,150 --> 02:38:21,450
Sorry.

4333
02:38:21,750 --> 02:38:22,250
Oh not that.

4334
02:38:23,410 --> 02:38:25,250
Maybe you should learn a third character.

4335
02:38:25,430 --> 02:38:25,870
SK.

4336
02:38:26,590 --> 02:38:27,670
I got you.

4337
02:38:27,790 --> 02:38:28,850
I'll help you.

4338
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:30,290
Learn a third character.

4339
02:38:33,330 --> 02:38:35,450
One character for each round.

4340
02:38:35,830 --> 02:38:36,010
Yeah.

4341
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:36,070
Yeah.

4342
02:38:38,210 --> 02:38:39,450
Learn modern Aki.

4343
02:38:39,650 --> 02:38:40,110
Nice.

4344
02:38:43,910 --> 02:38:45,250
That chop's so stupid.

4345
02:38:48,130 --> 02:38:49,170
Oh my god.

4346
02:38:49,350 --> 02:38:50,870
We gots in my chat.

4347
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:52,170
He's cracked.

4348
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:53,970
He doesn't know what to do.

4349
02:38:53,970 --> 02:38:54,670
Nice resets.

4350
02:38:54,810 --> 02:38:55,050
Uh oh.

4351
02:38:55,770 --> 02:38:56,970
He had to do reversal.

4352
02:38:57,270 --> 02:38:58,150
He was out of options.

4353
02:38:58,370 --> 02:38:59,770
Did you see how I styled right there?

4354
02:38:59,830 --> 02:39:01,150
I kinda like posed like Jojo.

4355
02:39:01,470 --> 02:39:03,070
Oh my god yeah.

4356
02:39:03,070 --> 02:39:05,110
It definitely wasn't a missed heavy.

4357
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:06,950
No it was a pose.

4358
02:39:07,150 --> 02:39:07,990
It was the style.

4359
02:39:08,270 --> 02:39:11,110
Guys we gots in my chat and he's from the navy.

4360
02:39:12,510 --> 02:39:13,570
He's real.

4361
02:39:14,110 --> 02:39:16,150
We got preppy for that bison match.

4362
02:39:16,210 --> 02:39:16,970
He was like sorry.

4363
02:39:17,070 --> 02:39:18,310
I'm playing on navy wifi.

4364
02:39:19,470 --> 02:39:19,930
Oh my god.

4365
02:39:20,730 --> 02:39:22,270
I stopped the arc.

4366
02:39:26,190 --> 02:39:26,750
Oh.

4367
02:39:28,950 --> 02:39:30,070
I attacked.

4368
02:39:30,770 --> 02:39:31,610
Kuma thanks.

4369
02:39:31,630 --> 02:39:32,230
Don't worry about it.

4370
02:39:33,130 --> 02:39:33,770
Oh my god.

4371
02:39:33,810 --> 02:39:34,910
This character is dumb as fuck.

4372
02:39:36,030 --> 02:39:36,690
Nice block.

4373
02:39:37,590 --> 02:39:38,470
Now you're good.

4374
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:38,710
You're good.

4375
02:39:38,730 --> 02:39:38,910
You're good.

4376
02:39:38,990 --> 02:39:39,150
You're out.

4377
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:41,630
Nice!

4378
02:39:42,230 --> 02:39:43,090
Oh that's good.

4379
02:39:45,010 --> 02:39:45,950
He doesn't block low.

4380
02:39:47,010 --> 02:39:48,470
Every overhead was blocked.

4381
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:49,730
Every low you get a free combo.

4382
02:39:50,990 --> 02:39:51,850
It's good to know.

4383
02:39:56,590 --> 02:39:57,970
I just like that reset.

4384
02:39:58,390 --> 02:39:59,190
Wah wah wah.

4385
02:40:03,270 --> 02:40:03,630
Nice.

4386
02:40:04,970 --> 02:40:05,790
You know what to do.

4387
02:40:06,190 --> 02:40:06,630
Exactly.

4388
02:40:06,990 --> 02:40:08,110
Free combo every time.

4389
02:40:08,670 --> 02:40:10,050
He pays for the overhead.

4390
02:40:10,390 --> 02:40:11,150
Look at that.

4391
02:40:11,170 --> 02:40:12,310
Look at how much he pays for that.

4392
02:40:15,150 --> 02:40:16,330
Let's go baby!

4393
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:17,030
Nice!

4394
02:40:19,550 --> 02:40:20,310
Let's go baby!

4395
02:40:20,690 --> 02:40:21,230
Let's go!

4396
02:40:23,330 --> 02:40:24,290
Oh that's good.

4397
02:40:24,530 --> 02:40:24,890
Perfect.

4398
02:40:25,450 --> 02:40:26,630
That's a 4-0.

4399
02:40:27,670 --> 02:40:29,150
Now the coach doesn't have to play.

4400
02:40:29,950 --> 02:40:31,010
This is what I need.

4401
02:40:31,250 --> 02:40:32,510
I don't want to have to play.

4402
02:40:32,710 --> 02:40:33,410
Oh shit wait.

4403
02:40:34,730 --> 02:40:34,990
My turn.

4404
02:40:36,150 --> 02:40:37,710
This is what you guys got to be doing.

4405
02:40:37,710 --> 02:40:38,130
Let's go!

4406
02:40:39,770 --> 02:40:40,970
Hold on Doki.

4407
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:41,770
Give me a second.

4408
02:40:41,910 --> 02:40:42,750
Why are we fighting?

4409
02:40:44,570 --> 02:40:46,570
I don't want to throw hands with the bird.

4410
02:40:46,610 --> 02:40:46,950
Alright.

4411
02:40:51,690 --> 02:40:52,130
Alright.

4412
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:53,150
Alright.

4413
02:40:53,570 --> 02:40:55,010
That training paid off coach.

4414
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:55,470
Thank you.

4415
02:40:55,870 --> 02:40:56,690
No problem.

4416
02:40:58,430 --> 02:40:59,310
You're ready.

4417
02:40:59,530 --> 02:41:00,810
He wasn't blocking low at all.

4418
02:41:01,370 --> 02:41:04,430
Well I think Jordan on Friday is going to start blocking.

4419
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:06,030
I start rubbing my hands.

4420
02:41:06,130 --> 02:41:06,590
I'm like yes.

4421
02:41:07,150 --> 02:41:09,230
Yeah Friday is going to be weird man.

4422
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:10,590
I don't want like...

4423
02:41:11,270 --> 02:41:14,510
For people who won all of theirs it might suck more.

4424
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:16,850
Yeah because they're going to analyze the vibes.

4425
02:41:17,070 --> 02:41:18,590
We'll just do the opposite on Friday.

4426
02:41:19,110 --> 02:41:20,750
We'll just overhead every time on Friday.

4427
02:41:21,670 --> 02:41:22,070
Yeah.

4428
02:41:23,290 --> 02:41:24,470
They're going to think I don't block.

4429
02:41:24,590 --> 02:41:26,670
But then on Friday I'm going to finally learn how to block.

4430
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:28,610
Probably not.

4431
02:41:28,950 --> 02:41:30,510
Even though you paid $70.

4432
02:41:30,810 --> 02:41:33,130
Maybe like okay I'll block 10% more.

4433
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:39,980
You're right I won't block.

4434
02:41:40,380 --> 02:41:41,220
Is this a Kimberly?

4435
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:43,400
Yeah it's Shine.

4436
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:46,420
Shine is like one of the best Kimberly's.

4437
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:48,180
Probably the only Kimberly right now.

4438
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:49,280
I don't know any other Kimberly.

4439
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,300
Yeah but how many YouTube subscribers does he have?

4440
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:53,000
Yeah exactly.

4441
02:41:53,660 --> 02:41:54,500
That's what I'm saying.

4442
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:57,740
Does he have the plaque?

4443
02:41:59,140 --> 02:42:00,040
Didn't think so.

4444
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:02,380
Damn that's...

4445
02:42:03,140 --> 02:42:03,720
That's fucked.

4446
02:42:04,360 --> 02:42:05,960
Bro that's fucked.

4447
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:08,540
Oh damn.

4448
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:10,840
I sped up into my coach getting beat up.

4449
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:11,320
Jesus.

4450
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:15,120
He's just teaching us what not to do.

4451
02:42:15,940 --> 02:42:16,500
Right?

4452
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:19,220
That's basically what he's doing.

4453
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:20,420
Look.

4454
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:22,980
I'm telling you coach.

4455
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:24,100
You should have had the piss buff.

4456
02:42:24,620 --> 02:42:27,980
Their coach is avenging their players right now.

4457
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:29,420
After everything we did.

4458
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:31,920
Let's go!

4459
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:32,380
Fuck it.

4460
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:32,740
We ball.

4461
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:33,100
Let's go.

4462
02:42:33,260 --> 02:42:33,860
Oh shit.

4463
02:42:33,980 --> 02:42:34,660
That's cool.

4464
02:42:34,940 --> 02:42:35,300
Oh my gosh.

4465
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:38,720
Do it again!

4466
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:39,980
Get him brother!

4467
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:43,220
That's alright.

4468
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:44,340
He guessed right.

4469
02:42:44,640 --> 02:42:47,900
He's not dead.

4470
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:49,100
It might be a pixel.

4471
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:51,000
It's a pixel for sure.

4472
02:42:51,180 --> 02:42:51,760
It's dangerous.

4473
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:53,200
Will it kill?

4474
02:42:53,960 --> 02:42:54,780
Will it kill?

4475
02:42:54,880 --> 02:42:58,940
It did not kill.

4476
02:42:58,940 --> 02:43:00,220
She's listening to music.

4477
02:43:00,260 --> 02:43:00,640
That's illegal.

4478
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:05,300
She's about to get DMCA'd real soon.

4479
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:05,540
Yeah.

4480
02:43:06,460 --> 02:43:07,280
Ah fuck.

4481
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:09,840
I sandwiched beneath the fucking ball.

4482
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:12,600
Yeah the paintbrush dude.

4483
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:13,920
Oh yeah.

4484
02:43:18,260 --> 02:43:20,160
Looking at the scores for the others.

4485
02:43:20,480 --> 02:43:20,740
One of our.

4486
02:43:20,840 --> 02:43:21,140
One of our.

4487
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:22,260
Okay.

4488
02:43:32,170 --> 02:43:33,190
There we go.

4489
02:43:33,830 --> 02:43:34,490
Oh yeah.

4490
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:36,210
Nice.

4491
02:43:37,210 --> 02:43:37,690
I am tired.

4492
02:43:39,010 --> 02:43:39,490
Woo.

4493
02:43:39,690 --> 02:43:40,110
Oh.

4494
02:43:40,210 --> 02:43:42,970
What are you doing glowing green?

4495
02:43:45,430 --> 02:43:45,910
Nice.

4496
02:43:45,930 --> 02:43:46,430
Oh nice.

4497
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:49,270
That shimmy attempt.

4498
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:56,360
That was too.

4499
02:43:56,420 --> 02:43:56,620
Yeah.

4500
02:43:58,540 --> 02:43:59,020
Okay.

4501
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:02,080
Trying to check that so hard.

4502
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:03,520
Nice.

4503
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:05,400
That's cool.

4504
02:44:06,060 --> 02:44:06,540
Okay.

4505
02:44:07,020 --> 02:44:08,720
Doki this is neutral right here.

4506
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:09,440
This one?

4507
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:10,780
You say that every match.

4508
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:12,580
This is neutral.

4509
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:14,960
I'll never know what neutral is.

4510
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:15,220
Let's go.

4511
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:17,580
I'll never turn.

4512
02:44:19,220 --> 02:44:20,180
Stand still.

4513
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:23,880
Coach is the cop dude.

4514
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:27,300
Is this neutral?

4515
02:44:28,740 --> 02:44:29,620
No not yet.

4516
02:44:29,740 --> 02:44:30,680
Okay this is neutral.

4517
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:31,800
This right here.

4518
02:44:32,420 --> 02:44:33,700
This is neutral right here.

4519
02:44:33,820 --> 02:44:34,480
You see this?

4520
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:34,880
Okay.

4521
02:44:35,140 --> 02:44:37,420
Does the game only have neutral?

4522
02:44:37,420 --> 02:44:38,300
Or is there anything else?

4523
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:40,140
Every game has neutral.

4524
02:44:40,340 --> 02:44:42,040
There's no such thing as no neutral.

4525
02:44:43,640 --> 02:44:45,220
What's it called when it's not neutral?

4526
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:48,000
Guys I think we're making our coach throw.

4527
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:48,400
I think.

4528
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:51,280
I'm sorry.

4529
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:53,400
I lost the neutral.

4530
02:44:53,700 --> 02:44:56,380
He lost the neutral.

4531
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:56,880
See what I mean?

4532
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:58,260
Wait how did you lose the neutral?

4533
02:44:58,540 --> 02:44:59,780
If everything is neutral.

4534
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:02,860
Cause he's guessing wrong.

4535
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:06,760
If you think about it.

4536
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:07,420
I made a mistake.

4537
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:08,940
Now it's neutral.

4538
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:10,000
That was neutral?

4539
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:12,780
Neutral is one big coin flip.

4540
02:45:12,940 --> 02:45:13,980
Sometimes it's heads.

4541
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:14,860
Sometimes it's tails.

4542
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:16,320
Okay.

4543
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,820
He called heads and he got heads.

4544
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:22,220
Wait so it's fighting games?

4545
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:24,920
Just gotcha?

4546
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:28,440
You get that SSR conversion?

4547
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:28,960
Yeah.

4548
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:31,120
Are you going to get that SSR ball?

4549
02:45:33,300 --> 02:45:33,920
Hold on.

4550
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:36,660
We'll see if coach gets it.

4551
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:37,620
Coach gets lucky here.

4552
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,880
Oh my god you're going to get a waifu?

4553
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:41,640
Alright nice.

4554
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:42,400
That was like an SR.

4555
02:45:42,620 --> 02:45:43,240
Oh here we go.

4556
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:45,460
Okay here we go.

4557
02:45:47,740 --> 02:45:48,460
Nice check.

4558
02:45:49,320 --> 02:45:49,700
Nice.

4559
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:50,800
That's it.

4560
02:45:50,900 --> 02:45:51,160
That's it.

4561
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:54,320
That's an SSR right there.

4562
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:54,780
You see that?

4563
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:56,920
Side step right?

4564
02:45:57,860 --> 02:45:58,240
Nice.

4565
02:45:59,580 --> 02:46:01,040
Side step right.

4566
02:46:01,960 --> 02:46:03,360
I'm so sorry you're in this.

4567
02:46:03,360 --> 02:46:04,780
I know you want to play Tekken so bad.

4568
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:09,300
I believe in the Brian.

4569
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:13,380
DOS.

4570
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:14,260
Let's go DOS.

4571
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:15,400
Did you guys see that?

4572
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:17,340
No I looked away.

4573
02:46:18,100 --> 02:46:19,100
Can you do that again?

4574
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:23,300
You only look when I'm getting smoked.

4575
02:46:24,980 --> 02:46:25,900
I'm looking away.

4576
02:46:25,960 --> 02:46:26,480
I'm looking away.

4577
02:46:26,980 --> 02:46:28,220
I'm looking away right now.

4578
02:46:28,980 --> 02:46:30,020
What the hell?

4579
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:32,460
I thought you were safe.

4580
02:46:32,660 --> 02:46:33,200
What the hell?

4581
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:36,640
I thought you were safe.

4582
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:36,980
Is he winning?

4583
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:37,600
I looked away.

4584
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:40,700
Actually he might be.

4585
02:46:40,760 --> 02:46:41,200
Hold.

4586
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:41,600
Hold.

4587
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:44,260
It's not over.

4588
02:46:44,340 --> 02:46:44,700
It's not over.

4589
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:45,740
Okay I'm still looking.

4590
02:46:47,620 --> 02:46:48,880
Doki turn it off.

4591
02:46:49,080 --> 02:46:49,200
Okay.

4592
02:46:49,580 --> 02:46:52,780
Shut it down.

4593
02:46:53,080 --> 02:46:54,220
Okay I'm looking away.

4594
02:46:57,740 --> 02:46:59,460
Okay I'm looking away.

4595
02:46:59,460 --> 02:46:59,880
Sorry.

4596
02:46:59,880 --> 02:47:00,140
Sorry.

4597
02:47:02,940 --> 02:47:03,880
Don't worry coach.

4598
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:04,400
Composure.

4599
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:05,060
We're good.

4600
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:06,540
Ignore the birds.

4601
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:07,680
Don't worry coach.

4602
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:09,360
They're down four games.

4603
02:47:10,580 --> 02:47:12,320
If it makes you feel any better.

4604
02:47:12,480 --> 02:47:13,840
Their entire team lost.

4605
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:16,120
Guys but we need the points.

4606
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:17,140
We need to catch up.

4607
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:19,420
We can't be last.

4608
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:22,280
Coach we gotta pay rent dude.

4609
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:22,980
Come on man.

4610
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:23,940
Coach.

4611
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:26,060
This is our only job.

4612
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:30,380
I'm unemployed coach.

4613
02:47:30,460 --> 02:47:30,920
Please.

4614
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:33,620
Time to hit that unemployment.

4615
02:47:33,820 --> 02:47:35,360
This is our 9 to 5.

4616
02:47:36,580 --> 02:47:37,240
Come on.

4617
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:38,680
Come on food stamps again.

4618
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:41,400
GG's.

4619
02:47:41,580 --> 02:47:42,220
Good try.

4620
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:43,840
Yeah GG's coach.

4621
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:44,520
That was good.

4622
02:47:44,620 --> 02:47:46,320
This is the strap you guys just took.

4623
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:48,420
And then we're good.

4624
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:52,020
Sorry that was my bad.

4625
02:47:52,240 --> 02:47:56,040
This is the first group that we actually like.

4626
02:47:56,840 --> 02:47:59,320
It was always 2-2.

4627
02:47:59,520 --> 02:47:59,960
Yeah.

4628
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:00,860
Yeah.

4629
02:48:02,440 --> 02:48:03,460
Oh my god.

4630
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:06,380
The official Street Fighter account retweeted my stream.

4631
02:48:07,340 --> 02:48:08,040
That's cool.

4632
02:48:08,860 --> 02:48:09,700
That's cool.

4633
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:11,320
They're cloud chasing.

4634
02:48:14,020 --> 02:48:16,940
They literally have more Twitter followers than me.

4635
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:17,020
They literally have more Twitter followers than me.

4636
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:17,400
What do you mean?

4637
02:48:19,420 --> 02:48:21,920
God damn Capcom do cloud chasers.

4638
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:22,940
That's what they are dude.

4639
02:48:23,300 --> 02:48:23,900
Actually.

4640
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:25,000
Actually.

4641
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:32,140
We have to go to another room now.

4642
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:32,640
We have to go to another room now.

4643
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:34,100
Yeah the last team we're playing.

4644
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:35,160
Oh yeah.

4645
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:37,100
You finally get to play Roy.

4646
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:38,240
Automatic.

4647
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:43,060
Can we just tell them to play the Roy match now?

4648
02:48:43,240 --> 02:48:43,420
Can we just tell them to play the Roy match now?

4649
02:48:43,420 --> 02:48:44,520
So we can get in home.

4650
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:47,360
Bro is anxious.

4651
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,480
Can we make that request?

4652
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:51,940
I'm going to make that request.

4653
02:48:52,360 --> 02:48:55,160
I'll be like, Bro really really wants to fight Roy first.

4654
02:48:56,820 --> 02:48:57,560
It's fine.

4655
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:03,320
Were you laying in bed just thinking about the conversions you can get on Jamie?

4656
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:05,180
I don't know any bro.

4657
02:49:05,340 --> 02:49:06,580
I don't fucking know any.

4658
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:09,720
You got him knocked down.

4659
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:10,920
Thinking in your head.

4660
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:11,820
Oh man I should drive.

4661
02:49:12,060 --> 02:49:13,300
I want to play this.

4662
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:16,780
So I can like study it for tomorrow.

4663
02:49:17,060 --> 02:49:17,860
You know what I mean?

4664
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:20,320
Even if I win.

4665
02:49:20,480 --> 02:49:22,480
I want to see what that character has.

4666
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:23,520
He's so annoying in ranked.

4667
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:24,920
He's really.

4668
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:25,560
He is annoying.

4669
02:49:28,820 --> 02:49:29,540
What's your weakness?

4670
02:49:30,980 --> 02:49:31,380
Yeah.

4671
02:49:31,740 --> 02:49:33,240
Heavy punch is obnoxious.

4672
02:49:33,360 --> 02:49:36,140
When I heard that button is 5 frames.

4673
02:49:36,500 --> 02:49:37,900
I nearly shat my pants.

4674
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:40,020
Yeah.

4675
02:49:40,140 --> 02:49:41,940
So that can come out randomly if you're just spamming it.

4676
02:49:42,060 --> 02:49:43,400
But it's negative on block.

4677
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:44,960
Unless they dry brush into it.

4678
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:47,780
You kind of have to let him dry brush a little bit here and there.

4679
02:49:47,860 --> 02:49:48,660
With the heavy punch.

4680
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:50,940
Cause that shit is too quick.

4681
02:49:54,740 --> 02:49:55,200
Wait.

4682
02:49:55,800 --> 02:49:57,060
What's the weakness for Aki?

4683
02:49:57,260 --> 02:49:58,460
Cause I'm fighting an Aki next.

4684
02:49:58,900 --> 02:50:00,100
You're fighting an Aki?

4685
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:02,440
She has bad defense.

4686
02:50:02,820 --> 02:50:04,440
She doesn't have a DP.

4687
02:50:04,700 --> 02:50:05,840
Wait I'm going to knowledge check her.

4688
02:50:06,500 --> 02:50:07,820
Yeah knowledge check her.

4689
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:12,340
What does that mean?

4690
02:50:12,680 --> 02:50:14,420
When you say that Doki.

4691
02:50:14,560 --> 02:50:15,060
What does that mean?

4692
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:16,340
I'm going to back triangle.

4693
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:20,600
You give me a little nervous.

4694
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:22,900
Let's switch back triangle.

4695
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:24,300
I'm back triangle.

4696
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:26,840
She's got a full screen running bear.

4697
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:31,820
If she doesn't block then I'll know.

4698
02:50:32,140 --> 02:50:32,760
Like I said Doki.

4699
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:33,360
You get one.

4700
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:35,420
I know I always do one.

4701
02:50:35,480 --> 02:50:37,320
I do it once.

4702
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:38,240
If it doesn't work.

4703
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:42,520
The thing is I do that for today.

4704
02:50:42,860 --> 02:50:43,760
Cause then I'll know.

4705
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:45,280
They'll never let me do that again.

4706
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:45,760
Like...

4707
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,420
Or just do it closer.

4708
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:50,500
That's the only difference.

4709
02:50:51,400 --> 02:50:53,220
Do it up close to them.

4710
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,000
Not point blank.

4711
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:56,000
But a little bit close.

4712
02:50:56,040 --> 02:50:57,300
That's actually really scary.

4713
02:50:57,840 --> 02:50:59,540
I think you should do that more actually.

4714
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:01,780
If they throw snob bubble at you.

4715
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:02,600
Just lariat.

4716
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:06,300
Oh dark soul dodge it.

4717
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:08,120
Yeah dark soul dodge it.

4718
02:51:08,500 --> 02:51:09,140
I frames.

4719
02:51:09,980 --> 02:51:11,320
I frames it.

4720
02:51:12,680 --> 02:51:15,300
I feel like that's more like a bloodborne dodge.

4721
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:18,120
That's if they try to run at you through it.

4722
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:19,520
Otherwise you can just block it.

4723
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:21,760
I don't know if this person will do that.

4724
02:51:21,820 --> 02:51:23,920
Normally they throw the snob bubble and they run at you.

4725
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:26,020
I don't know either.

4726
02:51:26,020 --> 02:51:28,080
Everybody keeps yelling me to do headbutt.

4727
02:51:28,100 --> 02:51:28,640
But I keep forgetting.

4728
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:30,880
Yeah that's the best part.

4729
02:51:32,120 --> 02:51:33,340
If you jump in on them.

4730
02:51:33,620 --> 02:51:36,420
If you can learn headbutt for Friday.

4731
02:51:36,580 --> 02:51:37,200
Like you'll.

4732
02:51:37,900 --> 02:51:38,560
You're cooking.

4733
02:51:38,620 --> 02:51:41,180
I don't know like when is the best time.

4734
02:51:41,320 --> 02:51:43,360
I always get nervous on when the best time is.

4735
02:51:43,660 --> 02:51:44,940
Whenever you're up close.

4736
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:47,880
Like if you get a knockdown and you're close to them.

4737
02:51:47,960 --> 02:51:49,080
And you don't have the dry rush up.

4738
02:51:49,180 --> 02:51:49,900
That's when you do it.

4739
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:52,460
So the ones from far away you're doing the right thing.

4740
02:51:52,520 --> 02:51:53,920
Like you're dry rushing in that's fine.

4741
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:56,160
But if you're already point blank when they're knocked down.

4742
02:51:56,700 --> 02:51:58,240
That's the best thing to do is just headbutt.

4743
02:52:05,260 --> 02:52:06,460
I'm back with hot water.

4744
02:52:06,780 --> 02:52:07,140
Nice.

4745
02:52:07,860 --> 02:52:08,580
Hot water.

4746
02:52:11,320 --> 02:52:12,380
You're 7 plus and minus.

4747
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:13,280
I almost failed math.

4748
02:52:15,920 --> 02:52:16,720
Which math?

4749
02:52:16,720 --> 02:52:17,740
I don't know.

4750
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:19,780
You don't have to worry about all that.

4751
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:22,500
We're here to crunch the numbers for you.

4752
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:25,340
It's a plus too.

4753
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:26,920
I was like what the fuck does that mean?

4754
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:29,380
You gotta keep pressing your triangles.

4755
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,040
Bashing your squares.

4756
02:52:31,460 --> 02:52:32,400
It'll be okay.

4757
02:52:33,020 --> 02:52:33,600
Red 4.

4758
02:52:34,460 --> 02:52:35,480
Blue 3.

4759
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:37,380
She said I failed math.

4760
02:52:37,380 --> 02:52:38,080
I almost.

4761
02:52:38,380 --> 02:52:39,900
I passed barely.

4762
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:44,720
And I had to map tutors like every other day.

4763
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:45,760
And I still almost failed.

4764
02:52:46,060 --> 02:52:46,440
Dude.

4765
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:49,900
Every other day.

4766
02:52:49,960 --> 02:52:50,500
No it's true.

4767
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:52,100
I would have like 2 hour tutors.

4768
02:52:52,100 --> 02:52:54,560
Because I was like almost unsalvageable.

4769
02:52:55,100 --> 02:52:56,200
D's get degrees.

4770
02:52:56,480 --> 02:52:57,040
You understand?

4771
02:52:57,180 --> 02:52:57,760
It's fine.

4772
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,900
You can still learn as much as possible.

4773
02:53:01,280 --> 02:53:02,340
I thought it was C's.

4774
02:53:03,780 --> 02:53:04,540
D's bro.

4775
02:53:04,640 --> 02:53:06,220
America is something else.

4776
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:06,740
Let me tell ya.

4777
02:53:07,940 --> 02:53:09,100
He's at my stage.

4778
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:09,540
Damn.

4779
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:11,420
Where do you live brother?

4780
02:53:11,780 --> 02:53:12,280
Yeah.

4781
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:13,440
I never heard of that.

4782
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:15,460
I don't know what school coefficient went to.

4783
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:16,160
Dude.

4784
02:53:16,240 --> 02:53:16,940
I'm in.

4785
02:53:17,460 --> 02:53:18,800
I'm in the good old.

4786
02:53:18,880 --> 02:53:20,100
He went to UNC.

4787
02:53:23,060 --> 02:53:24,340
Is that that?

4788
02:53:24,500 --> 02:53:26,180
I didn't know what UNC meant dude.

4789
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:27,380
I don't know what that means.

4790
02:53:28,820 --> 02:53:31,260
And SK had a wonderful education.

4791
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:33,020
I dropped out.

4792
02:53:33,140 --> 02:53:33,860
I dropped out.

4793
02:53:33,900 --> 02:53:36,400
I got a degree.

4794
02:53:37,380 --> 02:53:38,400
I got a degree.

4795
02:53:38,580 --> 02:53:39,680
But it had nothing to do with math.

4796
02:53:42,200 --> 02:53:43,800
Bro I dropped out too dude.

4797
02:53:44,780 --> 02:53:45,780
I'm with you SK.

4798
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:47,160
Damn.

4799
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:51,060
We need that 50k Brian.

4800
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:51,680
We need that 50k Brian.

4801
02:53:52,200 --> 02:53:53,320
I'm telling you bro.

4802
02:53:53,420 --> 02:53:55,060
I mean it when I say I gotta pay rent.

4803
02:53:55,220 --> 02:53:57,080
You guys need money or something?

4804
02:53:59,180 --> 02:54:00,700
This is our hobby right?

4805
02:54:00,700 --> 02:54:03,000
Brian you're off the clock after 8pm PST please.

4806
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:04,300
Brian you're off the clock after 8pm PST please.

4807
02:54:04,300 --> 02:54:04,820
Wait coach.

4808
02:54:04,820 --> 02:54:05,580
Coach real talk.

4809
02:54:06,400 --> 02:54:08,020
Real talk can I ask you something?

4810
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:11,160
Do you think I can kill someone with fang bubble?

4811
02:54:12,660 --> 02:54:14,140
Which move is that?

4812
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:16,420
So her taunt.

4813
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:18,360
She blows a fang bubble.

4814
02:54:18,580 --> 02:54:20,300
And it blows it behind her.

4815
02:54:20,420 --> 02:54:22,780
Doesn't that take like 3 minutes to come out?

4816
02:54:23,920 --> 02:54:24,360
Close.

4817
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:25,640
But yeah.

4818
02:54:26,940 --> 02:54:27,860
Then probably not.

4819
02:54:27,940 --> 02:54:29,280
But if you land it it'll be fucking sick.

4820
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:31,900
I just don't think it's gonna happen.

4821
02:54:31,900 --> 02:54:34,200
I'd rather you just do driver's blow and win.

4822
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:35,800
Over and over.

4823
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:37,240
Dude I'm...

4824
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:38,820
It's so sick.

4825
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,260
Wait did they already invite us?

4826
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:42,720
No they said they're going to.

4827
02:54:42,980 --> 02:54:43,640
They added us.

4828
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:44,160
My bad.

4829
02:54:44,340 --> 02:54:47,060
Wait are they still playing?

4830
02:54:47,060 --> 02:54:47,880
I'm gonna go grab some water guys.

4831
02:54:48,100 --> 02:54:49,000
Oh we just got the code.

4832
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:50,540
Okay yeah we got it.

4833
02:54:53,720 --> 02:54:55,340
I have to fight my wife.

4834
02:54:56,500 --> 02:54:56,900
Who?

4835
02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:57,700
Who's your wife?

4836
02:54:58,460 --> 02:54:58,860
Gatling.

4837
02:55:01,900 --> 02:55:02,340
Yeah.

4838
02:55:03,710 --> 02:55:05,220
Yeah how's she doing so far?

4839
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:06,080
She's doing really well.

4840
02:55:06,260 --> 02:55:08,000
She was 2-1 last night.

4841
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:10,940
1-2-1-2-0.

4842
02:55:11,080 --> 02:55:11,560
Who does she play?

4843
02:55:12,360 --> 02:55:13,260
Modern Ken.

4844
02:55:13,960 --> 02:55:15,340
Oh good luck.

4845
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:19,000
No no pick Chon.

4846
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:20,240
You should go with Chon.

4847
02:55:20,820 --> 02:55:23,020
They might have studied your jury so.

4848
02:55:23,900 --> 02:55:24,980
She's lost too.

4849
02:55:25,660 --> 02:55:26,280
So...

4850
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:30,020
She lost Bright Shield.

4851
02:55:30,400 --> 02:55:31,020
And...

4852
02:55:31,900 --> 02:55:32,300
Uh...

4853
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:33,180
Skara.

4854
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:35,960
Oh Skara's too powerful.

4855
02:55:36,100 --> 02:55:37,300
He keeps command grabbing everyone.

4856
02:55:38,180 --> 02:55:39,140
Skara's doing good.

4857
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:39,880
He's good man.

4858
02:55:41,180 --> 02:55:43,060
I'm surprised cause Manaan's not great.

4859
02:55:44,740 --> 02:55:46,340
But I guess I end flat.

4860
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:47,160
It doesn't matter.

4861
02:55:50,900 --> 02:55:51,380
Okay.

4862
02:55:51,460 --> 02:55:53,260
So are you playing Chon SK?

4863
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:54,560
I don't know.

4864
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:57,740
You should do it for the Evo moment you know.

4865
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:00,360
I think I go jury and see if she has the anti-airs.

4866
02:56:00,360 --> 02:56:01,180
And if she does.

4867
02:56:01,400 --> 02:56:02,140
Then I go Chon.

4868
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:03,460
Oh that's a good idea.

4869
02:56:04,060 --> 02:56:06,500
Or if you want to throw her off right now.

4870
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:08,860
Just play Chon.

4871
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:10,780
Yeah the other way around.

4872
02:56:10,980 --> 02:56:12,360
Yeah you can throw her off right now.

4873
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:15,060
Yeah see if she has the DI reactions.

4874
02:56:15,140 --> 02:56:16,900
And if she does I go jury.

4875
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:17,940
Yes.

4876
02:56:19,860 --> 02:56:20,300
Decisions.

4877
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:22,480
Are you all in the lobby?

4878
02:56:23,220 --> 02:56:24,420
Yeah I'm in the lobby.

4879
02:56:24,520 --> 02:56:25,580
They're not set up yet.

4880
02:56:26,220 --> 02:56:29,300
Oh they said you guys can start when ready.

4881
02:56:29,480 --> 02:56:30,800
Yeah you can start when ready Doki.

4882
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:31,220
I'm waiting.

4883
02:56:32,620 --> 02:56:35,900
I forgot that you're frame one sitting down.

4884
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:37,000
MP1 side.

4885
02:56:37,220 --> 02:56:39,300
I already fucking locked that in.

4886
02:56:48,760 --> 02:56:50,180
Yeah Nephew's first.

4887
02:56:52,100 --> 02:56:53,420
Nephew's definitely first.

4888
02:56:53,560 --> 02:56:54,540
Yeah Nephew's cracked.

4889
02:56:54,860 --> 02:56:55,820
Yeah I appreciate it.

4890
02:56:56,020 --> 02:57:00,360
I think Nephew won all their coach games.

4891
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:00,760
I think Nephew won all their coach games.

4892
02:57:00,780 --> 02:57:01,060
Yeah.

4893
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,940
2-1, 2-1.

4894
02:57:03,060 --> 02:57:05,400
Someone said he's like top 15 in the world or something.

4895
02:57:05,740 --> 02:57:06,780
Like what the heck is that?

4896
02:57:07,180 --> 02:57:09,420
He should be nerfed.

4897
02:57:09,480 --> 02:57:11,880
He should like play blindfolded or some shit.

4898
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:13,320
Like.

4899
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:14,900
To average it out.

4900
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:17,620
If you're top 500 in Street Fighter.

4901
02:57:17,720 --> 02:57:18,920
You need to like nerf yourself.

4902
02:57:21,320 --> 02:57:22,420
Play a different character.

4903
02:57:23,040 --> 02:57:24,080
That's not fair.

4904
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:27,760
That's like the PG-13 version of like.

4905
02:57:28,380 --> 02:57:28,940
That's like the PG-13 version of like.

4906
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:29,860
Love yourself.

4907
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:33,200
It's true.

4908
02:57:33,740 --> 02:57:35,200
If you're top 500.

4909
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:37,240
You should have like one nerf.

4910
02:57:37,420 --> 02:57:37,980
Bro.

4911
02:57:38,080 --> 02:57:40,680
The LTG emote with nerf yourself is too good chat.

4912
02:57:40,840 --> 02:57:41,180
Good job.

4913
02:57:42,120 --> 02:57:43,420
Nerf yourself now.

4914
02:57:44,540 --> 02:57:45,800
Nerf yourself now.

4915
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:47,860
Knowledge check time.

4916
02:57:49,140 --> 02:57:50,740
See I told you.

4917
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:51,900
It's knowledge check.

4918
02:57:52,860 --> 02:57:54,600
I have to spectate.

4919
02:57:54,760 --> 02:57:55,900
Does that mean it works?

4920
02:57:56,220 --> 02:57:57,700
That looks so stupid.

4921
02:57:57,860 --> 02:57:59,540
Now I know it doesn't work.

4922
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:03,160
Oh.

4923
02:58:03,240 --> 02:58:03,600
Alright.

4924
02:58:03,820 --> 02:58:04,840
I gotta see this.

4925
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:06,080
Nice.

4926
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:09,360
Nice.

4927
02:58:09,440 --> 02:58:10,040
There we go.

4928
02:58:11,260 --> 02:58:11,820
Oh.

4929
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:12,160
Get him.

4930
02:58:12,300 --> 02:58:13,220
He crashed my armor.

4931
02:58:19,360 --> 02:58:19,920
Okay.

4932
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:20,760
Get him.

4933
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:21,400
The triangle.

4934
02:58:21,400 --> 02:58:23,240
That was crazy.

4935
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:24,600
Good job.

4936
02:58:25,140 --> 02:58:25,740
Let's go.

4937
02:58:25,740 --> 02:58:27,640
That move you can just.

4938
02:58:28,260 --> 02:58:29,200
Super unsafe.

4939
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:31,940
Oh.

4940
02:58:32,180 --> 02:58:33,260
Nice jump.

4941
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:34,660
He didn't get up.

4942
02:58:35,140 --> 02:58:35,780
Let's go.

4943
02:58:36,460 --> 02:58:37,660
You don't need my help.

4944
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:38,140
You're cooking.

4945
02:58:38,320 --> 02:58:43,020
Get him.

4946
02:58:43,360 --> 02:58:44,300
We take those.

4947
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:46,760
Okay.

4948
02:58:47,300 --> 02:58:47,900
Nice.

4949
02:58:48,680 --> 02:58:49,400
Let's go.

4950
02:58:51,300 --> 02:58:52,860
Made for modern.

4951
02:58:52,860 --> 02:58:53,680
This is incredible.

4952
02:58:54,240 --> 02:58:54,780
Oh.

4953
02:58:55,940 --> 02:58:57,100
That was a good idea.

4954
02:58:57,300 --> 02:58:58,100
That was a good idea.

4955
02:58:58,320 --> 02:59:00,020
That's the only way to beat that move.

4956
02:59:00,360 --> 02:59:00,860
Really?

4957
02:59:01,140 --> 02:59:01,680
Yeah.

4958
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:04,280
She's all good.

4959
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:07,580
She's classic.

4960
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:10,960
She's really trying.

4961
02:59:11,160 --> 02:59:11,860
That's awesome.

4962
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:15,880
Oh.

4963
02:59:16,100 --> 02:59:17,280
She grappled me.

4964
02:59:17,820 --> 02:59:18,360
Sad.

4965
02:59:19,100 --> 02:59:19,640
Sad.

4966
02:59:23,920 --> 02:59:24,780
Did I hit that?

4967
02:59:25,500 --> 02:59:25,900
Oh.

4968
02:59:26,380 --> 02:59:26,780
Okay.

4969
02:59:28,760 --> 02:59:30,020
My loyal fans.

4970
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:31,280
My loyal fans.

4971
02:59:32,540 --> 02:59:34,520
Anything on the ground in front of you.

4972
02:59:34,580 --> 02:59:35,300
That is free range.

4973
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:36,320
She was crouched.

4974
02:59:38,980 --> 02:59:40,400
When she was crouched.

4975
02:59:40,600 --> 02:59:41,520
I couldn't tell.

4976
02:59:42,580 --> 02:59:43,920
Doki, I'm just letting you know.

4977
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:46,160
Some people are not going to sleep tonight because of you.

4978
02:59:46,380 --> 02:59:47,360
Just letting you know.

4979
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:52,340
I'm not going to sleep because of the hype.

4980
02:59:53,120 --> 02:59:53,520
Yeah.

4981
02:59:53,820 --> 02:59:54,740
I'm too excited.

4982
02:59:54,820 --> 02:59:55,200
Oh, my God.

4983
02:59:55,540 --> 02:59:56,940
Roy is going to be in his nightmares.

4984
03:00:01,340 --> 03:00:02,600
He's going to have Cheerios.

4985
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:03,360
She's so fast sometimes.

4986
03:00:03,780 --> 03:00:04,740
R-O-Y.

4987
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:08,140
He might smoke them.

4988
03:00:08,200 --> 03:00:08,540
I don't know.

4989
03:00:08,620 --> 03:00:09,220
It's just funny.

4990
03:00:09,620 --> 03:00:10,120
We'll see.

4991
03:00:10,880 --> 03:00:13,060
That's like the pay-per-view match of the night, dude.

4992
03:00:13,900 --> 03:00:14,800
It's a Jamie thing.

4993
03:00:14,900 --> 03:00:15,720
It's not a Roy thing.

4994
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:18,980
Whatever you say.

4995
03:00:22,860 --> 03:00:23,300
Good job, Doki.

4996
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:26,240
They're talking so much shit.

4997
03:00:26,260 --> 03:00:27,320
They forget to say good job.

4998
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:29,380
Oh, yeah, by the way.

4999
03:00:29,780 --> 03:00:30,460
Oh, no.

5000
03:00:30,620 --> 03:00:33,440
I don't think I live this.

5001
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:34,840
No, Doki.

5002
03:00:35,080 --> 03:00:35,960
Oh, nice.

5003
03:00:37,240 --> 03:00:38,180
Get him, Doki.

5004
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:39,860
Unleash the demons.

5005
03:00:41,980 --> 03:00:43,180
I messed up.

5006
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:44,300
I got worried.

5007
03:00:45,180 --> 03:00:47,160
Doki, just Lariat if it was flat.

5008
03:00:47,260 --> 03:00:48,300
Just Lariat after.

5009
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:50,440
Yeah, down triangle.

5010
03:00:51,160 --> 03:00:52,540
Gotta react to it, too.

5011
03:00:52,680 --> 03:00:53,280
Oh, what?

5012
03:00:53,460 --> 03:00:54,180
You can do that?

5013
03:00:55,060 --> 03:00:55,980
Only one hit.

5014
03:00:59,320 --> 03:01:00,220
Oh, what's that?

5015
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:02,600
That's a full screen thing.

5016
03:01:02,660 --> 03:01:04,400
If she doesn't hit it, you just grab her.

5017
03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:04,860
Okay.

5018
03:01:06,760 --> 03:01:07,360
Oh, ow.

5019
03:01:10,740 --> 03:01:11,120
Nice.

5020
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:11,820
There you go.

5021
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:13,180
I have to play slow.

5022
03:01:13,220 --> 03:01:13,980
I don't like it.

5023
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:16,160
She doesn't know he plays fast.

5024
03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:17,540
You'll be rewarded soon.

5025
03:01:18,080 --> 03:01:19,760
Oh, yeah, the corner is upon us.

5026
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:23,220
The corner is upon us.

5027
03:01:24,100 --> 03:01:25,740
You got her corner, so now you can go ahead.

5028
03:01:25,740 --> 03:01:26,060
She's there.

5029
03:01:26,180 --> 03:01:27,480
All right, time to party.

5030
03:01:28,200 --> 03:01:28,920
Oh, shit.

5031
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:30,080
Sorry, I fucked it up.

5032
03:01:31,260 --> 03:01:32,040
No, you're good.

5033
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:32,540
You're good.

5034
03:01:35,880 --> 03:01:37,020
Oh, my God.

5035
03:01:37,100 --> 03:01:37,520
Let's go.

5036
03:01:37,640 --> 03:01:37,980
Get him.

5037
03:01:38,060 --> 03:01:38,400
Yep, Lariat.

5038
03:01:38,680 --> 03:01:39,500
Yep, there you go.

5039
03:01:39,560 --> 03:01:39,900
Can I get this?

5040
03:01:39,960 --> 03:01:40,320
Nice.

5041
03:01:40,680 --> 03:01:41,400
Oh, I do.

5042
03:01:41,600 --> 03:01:41,940
Nice.

5043
03:01:43,740 --> 03:01:44,240
Let's go.

5044
03:01:46,160 --> 03:01:46,300
Can I get this?

5045
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:48,440
I don't know.

5046
03:01:49,240 --> 03:01:51,220
That's the quote of the day, to be honest.

5047
03:01:51,220 --> 03:01:52,820
Every time she does it.

5048
03:01:52,980 --> 03:01:54,100
That's fucking right.

5049
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:56,260
Do I get this?

5050
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:59,520
You're so innocently doing these gnarly level 3s.

5051
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:01,880
You really are stealing their souls when you do that.

5052
03:02:02,140 --> 03:02:02,780
Oh, yeah.

5053
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:06,900
Oh, you're rewarded.

5054
03:02:06,980 --> 03:02:07,840
You're at the corner now.

5055
03:02:07,940 --> 03:02:08,800
Time to party.

5056
03:02:10,240 --> 03:02:10,620
Yeah.

5057
03:02:11,620 --> 03:02:13,740
Oh, she counted it.

5058
03:02:13,980 --> 03:02:15,020
Yeah, she's adapting.

5059
03:02:15,020 --> 03:02:15,660
That was good on her.

5060
03:02:16,160 --> 03:02:16,640
That's fine.

5061
03:02:16,720 --> 03:02:17,780
She won't count on the next one.

5062
03:02:18,260 --> 03:02:18,640
Okay.

5063
03:02:19,820 --> 03:02:21,140
I would just do it again.

5064
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:22,200
I like that.

5065
03:02:22,220 --> 03:02:22,880
Just do it again.

5066
03:02:24,940 --> 03:02:25,320
Exactly.

5067
03:02:25,320 --> 03:02:25,700
See?

5068
03:02:25,880 --> 03:02:27,380
I would just do it again.

5069
03:02:29,720 --> 03:02:30,480
Oh, unlucky.

5070
03:02:31,880 --> 03:02:32,380
It's alright.

5071
03:02:32,520 --> 03:02:32,740
It's alright.

5072
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:33,660
There you go.

5073
03:02:34,140 --> 03:02:35,780
Give her a little one-two.

5074
03:02:36,420 --> 03:02:36,800
Nice.

5075
03:02:37,880 --> 03:02:38,940
And then Lariat.

5076
03:02:39,480 --> 03:02:39,860
Yes.

5077
03:02:40,040 --> 03:02:43,340
Oh, she counted it, too.

5078
03:02:43,620 --> 03:02:44,000
That's okay.

5079
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:44,580
You're still alive.

5080
03:02:45,240 --> 03:02:47,380
Wait, am I going to die to this?

5081
03:02:47,460 --> 03:02:48,260
No, no, no.

5082
03:02:48,300 --> 03:02:48,980
You're not dying.

5083
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:51,440
Oh, she did the far away one.

5084
03:02:51,660 --> 03:02:52,180
Oh, no!

5085
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:53,180
I died.

5086
03:02:54,840 --> 03:02:55,240
Yeah.

5087
03:02:55,240 --> 03:02:56,080
We still got one more.

5088
03:02:58,900 --> 03:03:01,960
Is there an auto-combo she can do in the corner at all?

5089
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:02,760
It's bad.

5090
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:05,700
Uh, yeah.

5091
03:03:05,780 --> 03:03:08,300
But not after really the wall splats.

5092
03:03:08,660 --> 03:03:09,160
Oh, okay.

5093
03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:10,340
What did you say, SK?

5094
03:03:10,960 --> 03:03:12,700
Oh, I trained myself so hard.

5095
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:16,880
When someone in this game DI's, I'm pressing my pinky down and my hands are even on my desk.

5096
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:17,220
Beautiful.

5097
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:20,340
Dude, I saw your psycho training.

5098
03:03:21,480 --> 03:03:23,380
Oh, she's just, uh, she's countered.

5099
03:03:23,380 --> 03:03:25,300
Yeah, we have to not do it as much.

5100
03:03:25,360 --> 03:03:28,000
Okay, now it's finally time to just walk up and triangle.

5101
03:03:28,500 --> 03:03:28,940
Okay.

5102
03:03:29,020 --> 03:03:29,240
Okay.

5103
03:03:31,820 --> 03:03:34,800
Okay, nice.

5104
03:03:36,440 --> 03:03:37,760
Oh, that was an accident.

5105
03:03:38,200 --> 03:03:38,640
Hahaha.

5106
03:03:40,340 --> 03:03:40,540
Nice.

5107
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:42,220
Okay, yeah.

5108
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:43,440
I keep forgetting that.

5109
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:45,360
Sorry.

5110
03:03:48,200 --> 03:03:48,880
Oh, what?

5111
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:49,900
That should've been hit.

5112
03:03:52,420 --> 03:03:53,200
Oh, nice.

5113
03:03:53,560 --> 03:03:54,200
That's alright.

5114
03:03:57,340 --> 03:03:57,960
Oh, what?

5115
03:03:58,020 --> 03:03:58,720
That was a grab.

5116
03:03:59,700 --> 03:04:01,400
Mmm, I saw the vision, yeah.

5117
03:04:02,080 --> 03:04:02,840
It would've worked.

5118
03:04:02,980 --> 03:04:03,420
Nice!

5119
03:04:03,820 --> 03:04:04,620
That was fixies.

5120
03:04:05,020 --> 03:04:05,500
Okay.

5121
03:04:06,700 --> 03:04:08,020
Well, I'm dead here.

5122
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:09,360
No, no, no.

5123
03:04:09,360 --> 03:04:10,120
You got a chance.

5124
03:04:10,340 --> 03:04:10,500
You got this.

5125
03:04:10,620 --> 03:04:11,600
You gotta believe.

5126
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:14,400
Let's go!

5127
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:16,420
Oh my god!

5128
03:04:16,700 --> 03:04:18,160
You gotta believe!

5129
03:04:18,900 --> 03:04:20,060
Hell yes.

5130
03:04:21,540 --> 03:04:23,200
Perfect command grab.

5131
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:25,360
Okay.

5132
03:04:26,320 --> 03:04:27,320
Let's go!

5133
03:04:27,320 --> 03:04:28,320
You gotta believe!

5134
03:04:29,560 --> 03:04:30,320
Okay.

5135
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:32,060
The Doki Seme!

5136
03:04:32,180 --> 03:04:32,520
Let's go!

5137
03:04:34,440 --> 03:04:35,200
Ooh!

5138
03:04:35,280 --> 03:04:35,880
Nice.

5139
03:04:35,880 --> 03:04:36,120
Nice.

5140
03:04:38,620 --> 03:04:39,740
Dude, just jump.

5141
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:40,880
Don't do anything and grab.

5142
03:04:41,580 --> 03:04:42,520
That'd be so funny.

5143
03:04:44,500 --> 03:04:44,980
Whoops.

5144
03:04:45,200 --> 03:04:46,060
That was an accident.

5145
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:47,240
Whoa.

5146
03:04:48,580 --> 03:04:49,720
Oh, that's my bad.

5147
03:04:51,740 --> 03:04:52,220
Whoops.

5148
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:53,260
I'm panicking.

5149
03:04:53,740 --> 03:04:54,220
Hahaha.

5150
03:04:54,780 --> 03:04:55,260
Cool.

5151
03:04:55,260 --> 03:04:55,880
Keep it cool.

5152
03:04:55,920 --> 03:04:56,300
You got it.

5153
03:04:58,120 --> 03:04:58,600
Nice.

5154
03:04:58,640 --> 03:04:59,480
There you go, Lariat.

5155
03:05:01,500 --> 03:05:01,980
Nice.

5156
03:05:01,980 --> 03:05:02,420
Nice.

5157
03:05:02,420 --> 03:05:03,680
Oh, we did it.

5158
03:05:03,760 --> 03:05:04,100
Let's go!

5159
03:05:05,300 --> 03:05:06,400
You got it!

5160
03:05:06,880 --> 03:05:07,460
Yay!

5161
03:05:07,980 --> 03:05:08,580
Yay!

5162
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:09,920
Broke another record!

5163
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:12,100
Let's go.

5164
03:05:12,500 --> 03:05:14,160
The power of Gief, dude.

5165
03:05:15,360 --> 03:05:17,300
You played so good.

5166
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:18,380
You played neutral.

5167
03:05:18,620 --> 03:05:20,960
I don't know what I'm doing.

5168
03:05:22,660 --> 03:05:24,860
Your neutral was immaculate, Doki.

5169
03:05:25,020 --> 03:05:25,820
Good job.

5170
03:05:26,020 --> 03:05:30,040
You jumped over her slide and then you SCD'd her after.

5171
03:05:30,040 --> 03:05:31,500
I don't know what I'm doing.

5172
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:32,120
Hahaha.

5173
03:05:33,380 --> 03:05:34,200
That's okay.

5174
03:05:35,960 --> 03:05:36,960
Stuff just happens.

5175
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:37,540
Some words eat down inside.

5176
03:05:37,780 --> 03:05:38,320
You understand.

5177
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:40,160
Stuff just happens.

5178
03:05:41,040 --> 03:05:44,080
Wait, why am I queuing for fucking...

5179
03:05:44,080 --> 03:05:45,480
What the fuck is going on, dude?

5180
03:05:45,860 --> 03:05:47,280
Wait, why are you queuing up?

5181
03:05:47,520 --> 03:05:48,340
Because you're next.

5182
03:05:48,980 --> 03:05:50,240
You throwing hands too?

5183
03:05:50,740 --> 03:05:52,420
Wait, is this me again?

5184
03:05:52,620 --> 03:05:53,040
No, it's SK.

5185
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:54,940
Oh, leave queue.

5186
03:05:55,040 --> 03:05:55,420
There we go.

5187
03:05:55,860 --> 03:05:58,600
Are you playing Chun-Li, SK?

5188
03:06:00,040 --> 03:06:01,660
Am I fighting Bra Pro?

5189
03:06:02,040 --> 03:06:02,540
Yes.

5190
03:06:02,640 --> 03:06:03,140
No, no, no.

5191
03:06:06,020 --> 03:06:07,860
Who is Bald Icon?

5192
03:06:09,380 --> 03:06:10,080
That's not me.

5193
03:06:10,480 --> 03:06:11,100
That's not me.

5194
03:06:12,420 --> 03:06:15,580
If you beat him, you're literally a gold player.

5195
03:06:15,860 --> 03:06:16,180
If you beat him, you're literally a gold player.

5196
03:06:16,180 --> 03:06:17,660
No, this should be Cat Link?

5197
03:06:18,280 --> 03:06:19,060
No, it's Cat Link.

5198
03:06:20,840 --> 03:06:21,840
Knowledge Trigger.

5199
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:23,720
Bald Icon came in.

5200
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:30,280
It's missing as the sound effects.

5201
03:06:30,380 --> 03:06:30,720
Oops.

5202
03:06:35,580 --> 03:06:35,880
Oops.

5203
03:06:45,760 --> 03:06:48,000
God, I hate Ken and Ken Player.

5204
03:06:48,700 --> 03:06:50,260
We fight so many.

5205
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:52,000
I know.

5206
03:06:52,260 --> 03:06:54,780
Ken Player made me lose my mind last night.

5207
03:06:55,160 --> 03:06:57,480
I was really upset.

5208
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:58,900
I was really upset.

5209
03:07:00,700 --> 03:07:02,160
I was really upset.

5210
03:07:02,160 --> 03:07:03,680
Nice, Zanchu.

5211
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:04,280
Nice, Zanchu.

5212
03:07:09,060 --> 03:07:10,440
Oh, it's time.

5213
03:07:10,820 --> 03:07:11,420
Nice.

5214
03:07:15,260 --> 03:07:17,160
Don't let her follow the flowchart.

5215
03:07:20,320 --> 03:07:21,540
Whatever that is.

5216
03:07:21,660 --> 03:07:22,900
I just stole what my chat said.

5217
03:07:23,380 --> 03:07:24,200
Nice parry.

5218
03:07:31,420 --> 03:07:32,960
What's the flowchart?

5219
03:07:33,560 --> 03:07:33,980
Alright.

5220
03:07:34,900 --> 03:07:37,140
Now all Ken Players eventually play.

5221
03:07:39,360 --> 03:07:40,580
How do they play?

5222
03:07:41,700 --> 03:07:42,980
You'll know it when you see it.

5223
03:07:43,080 --> 03:07:43,960
We haven't seen it yet.

5224
03:07:44,060 --> 03:07:44,420
Okay.

5225
03:07:44,640 --> 03:07:47,640
Kenathan is a menace.

5226
03:07:48,420 --> 03:07:49,060
Oh, nice.

5227
03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:49,620
There it is.

5228
03:07:55,870 --> 03:07:56,290
Nice.

5229
03:07:57,130 --> 03:07:57,810
It's okay, it's okay.

5230
03:07:58,170 --> 03:07:58,850
They're in the corner.

5231
03:08:00,270 --> 03:08:01,590
It's okay, you're on P1 side.

5232
03:08:02,330 --> 03:08:02,750
Nice!

5233
03:08:06,570 --> 03:08:07,890
And a punish.

5234
03:08:08,090 --> 03:08:08,490
Let's go.

5235
03:08:08,850 --> 03:08:10,110
That was so good.

5236
03:08:24,810 --> 03:08:25,890
Hadouken, Hadouken.

5237
03:08:29,890 --> 03:08:30,430
Nice!

5238
03:08:31,910 --> 03:08:32,470
Let's go!

5239
03:08:35,650 --> 03:08:36,250
Let's go!

5240
03:08:36,310 --> 03:08:38,410
Oh my god, that psycho training paid off, dude.

5241
03:08:38,950 --> 03:08:39,490
Nice.

5242
03:08:39,830 --> 03:08:41,090
She's burnt out.

5243
03:08:42,850 --> 03:08:43,330
Nice.

5244
03:08:43,470 --> 03:08:44,130
Air to air.

5245
03:08:44,130 --> 03:08:45,550
To the corner, let's go get em!

5246
03:08:45,670 --> 03:08:46,530
You undid level 3!

5247
03:08:47,690 --> 03:08:48,710
Oh, it's alright.

5248
03:08:48,790 --> 03:08:52,290
You don't need a level 3.

5249
03:08:52,410 --> 03:08:53,610
We're saving it for next game.

5250
03:08:53,790 --> 03:08:54,090
It's okay.

5251
03:08:54,950 --> 03:08:57,270
We're saving the level 3 for next game.

5252
03:08:57,650 --> 03:08:58,570
For Friday.

5253
03:09:00,230 --> 03:09:01,010
You got it.

5254
03:09:01,110 --> 03:09:02,950
You were just teabagging.

5255
03:09:04,350 --> 03:09:06,190
We're just being toxic, that's good.

5256
03:09:06,190 --> 03:09:06,690
Damn.

5257
03:09:07,110 --> 03:09:09,370
We're gonna be the heel of Seijan Slam 3.

5258
03:09:11,630 --> 03:09:13,330
It's mental warfare, you understand?

5259
03:09:13,730 --> 03:09:15,490
Every tournament needs a heel and that's us.

5260
03:09:21,070 --> 03:09:22,450
Alright, alright, alright.

5261
03:09:23,330 --> 03:09:24,470
Okay, they're waiting for that.

5262
03:09:24,590 --> 03:09:25,650
She flippin'.

5263
03:09:29,880 --> 03:09:30,600
Oh, shit.

5264
03:09:32,920 --> 03:09:33,440
Nice.

5265
03:09:34,220 --> 03:09:36,220
I'm so mad at my wife right now.

5266
03:09:37,740 --> 03:09:38,380
That's right.

5267
03:09:38,380 --> 03:09:40,440
Take the house and the divorce!

5268
03:09:47,660 --> 03:09:48,980
Okay, you're doing good.

5269
03:09:50,680 --> 03:09:51,200
Nice!

5270
03:09:51,580 --> 03:09:52,520
That was cheesy.

5271
03:09:53,820 --> 03:09:55,160
It's all good, it's all good.

5272
03:09:56,780 --> 03:09:57,480
Nice punish.

5273
03:09:57,480 --> 03:09:57,560
Nice grab.

5274
03:09:58,220 --> 03:09:59,260
Get em.

5275
03:10:00,580 --> 03:10:02,440
Oh no, is that the flowchart?

5276
03:10:02,680 --> 03:10:03,460
Oh yeah.

5277
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:07,820
They're honestly not flowcharting.

5278
03:10:08,740 --> 03:10:09,260
Nice.

5279
03:10:11,380 --> 03:10:13,060
Oh, that's close, that's close.

5280
03:10:13,260 --> 03:10:13,780
Solid round.

5281
03:10:14,540 --> 03:10:17,780
Wait, is this the second match or the second round or the third round?

5282
03:10:18,060 --> 03:10:19,380
This is the second game.

5283
03:10:20,300 --> 03:10:20,700
Okay.

5284
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:22,260
So yeah, SK's up.

5285
03:10:22,440 --> 03:10:23,580
Okay, I've been losing track.

5286
03:10:23,820 --> 03:10:26,840
They're actually playing neutral, so it's taking a while.

5287
03:10:28,460 --> 03:10:29,280
Is this neutral?

5288
03:10:30,660 --> 03:10:31,600
No, not yet.

5289
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:32,260
This is the part after neutral.

5290
03:10:32,740 --> 03:10:33,860
Not yet, not yet.

5291
03:10:34,040 --> 03:10:35,400
This is what happens after neutral.

5292
03:10:35,420 --> 03:10:38,440
When they're doing nothing and you forget what game it is, that's when they're playing neutral.

5293
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:39,020
Oh, okay.

5294
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:43,860
When you start spacing out and forget what's going on, that's neutral.

5295
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:46,380
I was throwing there.

5296
03:10:46,620 --> 03:10:47,500
Wait, I'm throwing.

5297
03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:51,780
Oh shit, I think it's time to bring out the jury after this.

5298
03:10:54,240 --> 03:10:54,960
Oh, okay.

5299
03:10:55,120 --> 03:10:56,240
No, I think that's fine.

5300
03:10:56,460 --> 03:10:57,940
So do you want to take a quick break, SK?

5301
03:10:58,080 --> 03:10:58,840
Like go back to the lobby?

5302
03:11:00,320 --> 03:11:00,960
Do it.

5303
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,140
I think if I go jury I'm just going to get fireballed out.

5304
03:11:04,180 --> 03:11:06,280
No, no, you don't need to go jury, you can just take a break.

5305
03:11:06,280 --> 03:11:07,040
Yeah, yeah.

5306
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:08,940
Is that ethical?

5307
03:11:09,460 --> 03:11:10,340
It is.

5308
03:11:11,140 --> 03:11:11,580
No!

5309
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:16,240
It's okay, Composure.

5310
03:11:16,620 --> 03:11:17,420
You're good, you're good.

5311
03:11:18,400 --> 03:11:20,720
Just plug and be like, sorry my internet went off.

5312
03:11:24,080 --> 03:11:26,920
How would they know?

5313
03:11:30,240 --> 03:11:32,120
Can you even turn off your stream for a little bit?

5314
03:11:32,180 --> 03:11:33,380
To sell the ice.

5315
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:37,400
Uh oh.

5316
03:11:37,580 --> 03:11:38,400
Oh man.

5317
03:11:38,600 --> 03:11:42,320
I actually

5318
03:11:49,160 --> 03:11:50,780
want P1 for China and I forgot.

5319
03:11:51,320 --> 03:11:52,280
Is that good?

5320
03:11:53,900 --> 03:11:54,940
Oh, I'm on P1.

5321
03:11:55,160 --> 03:11:56,940
Nice, you're on P1, you're fine.

5322
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:02,260
Oh, that was a good dodge.

5323
03:12:04,740 --> 03:12:06,760
What the fuck am I watching?

5324
03:12:07,080 --> 03:12:08,000
That goes low.

5325
03:12:08,120 --> 03:12:08,460
Thanks.

5326
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:12,920
That's Ken's flowchart right there.

5327
03:12:13,140 --> 03:12:13,700
Yeah.

5328
03:12:13,820 --> 03:12:14,380
Nice.

5329
03:12:14,680 --> 03:12:15,380
I figured it out.

5330
03:12:15,400 --> 03:12:20,300
Used to be Shuriken, now it's Jinrai.

5331
03:12:23,420 --> 03:12:23,980
Ow.

5332
03:12:26,980 --> 03:12:28,360
Oh damn, she got those.

5333
03:12:29,640 --> 03:12:30,480
Oh shit.

5334
03:12:40,130 --> 03:12:40,690
Nice.

5335
03:12:40,710 --> 03:12:42,150
Yeah, that's very punishable.

5336
03:12:42,250 --> 03:12:42,550
Good job.

5337
03:12:50,020 --> 03:12:52,900
It's time for the level 3 critical hit.

5338
03:12:53,240 --> 03:12:53,800
Nice.

5339
03:12:54,660 --> 03:12:55,340
Not now.

5340
03:12:59,280 --> 03:13:00,660
Oh, she doesn't care.

5341
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:01,600
Oh, she's...

5342
03:13:02,440 --> 03:13:04,080
A lot of them might have hit.

5343
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:06,220
It'll hit eventually.

5344
03:13:06,280 --> 03:13:06,700
Good try.

5345
03:13:08,140 --> 03:13:09,260
Yeah, they timed up.

5346
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:11,640
They knew when to press after.

5347
03:13:11,780 --> 03:13:14,300
Like your Hanzanshu, that's their turn.

5348
03:13:14,380 --> 03:13:16,220
When they block it, they understood how to...

5349
03:13:16,220 --> 03:13:17,800
Can I skip this?

5350
03:13:17,820 --> 03:13:19,400
I don't wanna fight this guy, man.

5351
03:13:19,980 --> 03:13:20,520
It's time.

5352
03:13:20,520 --> 03:13:21,280
It's time.

5353
03:13:22,300 --> 03:13:24,120
Bro, I'm getting the popcorn now.

5354
03:13:24,180 --> 03:13:24,800
This is gonna be good.

5355
03:13:25,040 --> 03:13:28,080
After everything you said about this guy's time.

5356
03:13:29,160 --> 03:13:30,160
Guys, at least...

5357
03:13:30,160 --> 03:13:31,380
I'm just gonna...

5358
03:13:31,380 --> 03:13:34,700
At least if we lose all the games today, we're not last.

5359
03:13:34,740 --> 03:13:35,080
Alright.

5360
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:37,000
That's all that matters.

5361
03:13:37,140 --> 03:13:37,800
Not last.

5362
03:13:40,300 --> 03:13:40,960
Just yet.

5363
03:13:41,720 --> 03:13:43,140
Show them pearly whites, dude.

5364
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:44,200
He's smiling at you.

5365
03:13:44,240 --> 03:13:44,760
You gonna take that?

5366
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:47,660
Alright, these are the two top dogs.

5367
03:13:47,660 --> 03:13:49,440
The two undefeated players.

5368
03:13:51,720 --> 03:13:52,420
Let's see it.

5369
03:13:53,580 --> 03:13:54,020
Nice.

5370
03:13:54,100 --> 03:13:54,480
Nice.

5371
03:13:54,480 --> 03:13:55,000
Get him.

5372
03:13:56,980 --> 03:13:57,420
Whoa.

5373
03:13:57,560 --> 03:13:57,980
Oh, yeah.

5374
03:13:58,080 --> 03:13:58,980
Keep him in the corner.

5375
03:14:00,100 --> 03:14:00,960
Don't let him drink.

5376
03:14:04,220 --> 03:14:05,020
Nice jabs.

5377
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:12,060
Uh-huh.

5378
03:14:19,960 --> 03:14:20,400
Mmm.

5379
03:14:20,500 --> 03:14:20,900
Okay.

5380
03:14:23,300 --> 03:14:23,900
No.

5381
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:24,760
He's drunk.

5382
03:14:30,040 --> 03:14:30,640
Nice.

5383
03:14:30,780 --> 03:14:31,080
Nice.

5384
03:14:31,140 --> 03:14:31,760
Good punish.

5385
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:32,420
Let's go.

5386
03:14:32,600 --> 03:14:32,900
Let's go.

5387
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:36,880
Oh, the punish down here.

5388
03:14:38,260 --> 03:14:38,860
Okay.

5389
03:14:38,860 --> 03:14:39,180
Okay.

5390
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:41,460
That was risky for him.

5391
03:14:44,940 --> 03:14:46,560
He's definitely studying your vibes.

5392
03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:49,000
That's his uppercut on block, so it looks weird.

5393
03:14:49,060 --> 03:14:49,420
But...

5394
03:14:53,280 --> 03:14:54,600
Oh, that was close.

5395
03:14:55,200 --> 03:14:57,520
Time to attend the AA meeting, dude.

5396
03:14:57,680 --> 03:14:58,560
No more drinking.

5397
03:15:01,540 --> 03:15:02,660
This is an intervention.

5398
03:15:06,560 --> 03:15:07,060
Oh, no.

5399
03:15:07,160 --> 03:15:07,960
He needs one more drink.

5400
03:15:09,720 --> 03:15:10,340
Two more.

5401
03:15:11,220 --> 03:15:12,100
I can't count.

5402
03:15:13,400 --> 03:15:14,140
I forget.

5403
03:15:14,260 --> 03:15:15,600
You almost killed Matt.

5404
03:15:15,860 --> 03:15:16,760
I forgot.

5405
03:15:18,620 --> 03:15:19,500
I was there.

5406
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:20,640
I was almost there, right?

5407
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:20,800
Yep.

5408
03:15:24,120 --> 03:15:24,580
Okay.

5409
03:15:27,340 --> 03:15:27,800
Nice.

5410
03:15:28,040 --> 03:15:28,660
There we go.

5411
03:15:28,800 --> 03:15:28,880
Nice.

5412
03:15:28,880 --> 03:15:28,880
There we go.

5413
03:15:29,640 --> 03:15:30,100
Nice.

5414
03:15:30,100 --> 03:15:30,100
There we go.

5415
03:15:30,100 --> 03:15:30,220
Nice.

5416
03:15:30,380 --> 03:15:30,420
There we go.

5417
03:15:32,860 --> 03:15:33,780
Good defense.

5418
03:15:34,480 --> 03:15:34,980
Let's go.

5419
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:36,980
This...

5420
03:15:37,700 --> 03:15:39,780
See, that was neutral.

5421
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:40,900
That was...

5422
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:42,920
He's waiting for my knee.

5423
03:15:43,300 --> 03:15:44,780
Yeah, they were looking at each other.

5424
03:15:45,040 --> 03:15:48,640
And also, he's jumping at you a lot.

5425
03:15:48,640 --> 03:15:49,940
And he's also getting...

5426
03:15:49,940 --> 03:15:54,120
Once he lands one jump in from a distance that you could have lariated, he's going for cross-ups a bunch.

5427
03:15:54,300 --> 03:15:58,500
So, just make sure to focus on the far jump in and get the lariat.

5428
03:16:07,920 --> 03:16:08,320
Nice.

5429
03:16:08,900 --> 03:16:09,520
Damn it.

5430
03:16:09,520 --> 03:16:11,140
Every time I do something, he does a stupid kick.

5431
03:16:12,500 --> 03:16:14,280
You could use more stand MP.

5432
03:16:14,580 --> 03:16:15,620
You know, stand BD punch.

5433
03:16:15,820 --> 03:16:16,580
Stuff like that.

5434
03:16:18,540 --> 03:16:19,540
Maybe stand MK.

5435
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:20,460
Like your pokes.

5436
03:16:23,780 --> 03:16:25,340
And then just be wary of the jump.

5437
03:16:25,760 --> 03:16:26,880
Oh my god.

5438
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:29,820
Every time I go for the Polar Express, he fucking hits me.

5439
03:16:30,040 --> 03:16:31,500
The Polar Express.

5440
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:38,420
This is like the slowest I've ever seen Brawl Pro play for the tournament.

5441
03:16:38,440 --> 03:16:38,860
I can't...

5442
03:16:38,860 --> 03:16:43,160
Yeah, he's like spacing you out so well.

5443
03:16:44,300 --> 03:16:45,380
Test his anti-airs.

5444
03:16:45,540 --> 03:16:47,680
You can do jump medium kick.

5445
03:16:51,420 --> 03:16:52,420
He plays...

5446
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:53,080
He's a street fighter.

5447
03:16:53,260 --> 03:16:54,080
He plays Tekken.

5448
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:56,960
He's very, very slow.

5449
03:16:56,960 --> 03:16:58,740
You gotta walk him down with better pokes.

5450
03:16:59,020 --> 03:17:00,380
Stand MK for you.

5451
03:17:00,640 --> 03:17:02,260
Represent these a little bit.

5452
03:17:03,160 --> 03:17:05,020
You're just backing up without doing anything.

5453
03:17:05,440 --> 03:17:05,780
Okay.

5454
03:17:08,380 --> 03:17:11,400
He's slowing you down so much that you're not used to it.

5455
03:17:13,880 --> 03:17:15,580
That's how Roy plays in general.

5456
03:17:16,160 --> 03:17:17,360
He's just very slow.

5457
03:17:17,740 --> 03:17:19,060
Wait until you mess up.

5458
03:17:20,360 --> 03:17:20,820
Nice.

5459
03:17:20,820 --> 03:17:21,220
There you go.

5460
03:17:21,240 --> 03:17:21,600
Get in there.

5461
03:17:24,480 --> 03:17:25,200
Oh, nice.

5462
03:17:25,540 --> 03:17:26,860
There you go.

5463
03:17:27,440 --> 03:17:28,160
Party time.

5464
03:17:29,060 --> 03:17:29,700
You're learning.

5465
03:17:29,900 --> 03:17:30,520
Oh, damn it.

5466
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:32,980
I fucked it up.

5467
03:17:34,280 --> 03:17:34,700
It's okay.

5468
03:17:34,820 --> 03:17:35,040
I believe.

5469
03:17:39,690 --> 03:17:40,950
What the fuck?

5470
03:17:42,230 --> 03:17:43,030
Command grab.

5471
03:17:43,330 --> 03:17:44,230
He got assailed on you.

5472
03:17:44,750 --> 03:17:46,350
I mean, I don't even know what I...

5473
03:17:46,350 --> 03:17:48,070
I know it's a command grab, but I don't know the setup.

5474
03:17:48,070 --> 03:17:49,290
I've never seen that before.

5475
03:17:49,610 --> 03:17:52,750
I think he gets that at level 2 or level 3.

5476
03:17:52,970 --> 03:17:53,190
Nice.

5477
03:17:53,190 --> 03:17:53,230
Damn.

5478
03:17:53,730 --> 03:17:54,130
GGs.

5479
03:17:54,190 --> 03:17:54,390
GGs.

5480
03:17:54,530 --> 03:17:54,610
GGs.

5481
03:17:54,830 --> 03:17:55,130
Okay.

5482
03:17:55,590 --> 03:17:56,850
Yeah, I see what you're scared of.

5483
03:17:56,850 --> 03:18:00,230
We gotta figure out how to assert neutral a little bit more.

5484
03:18:00,490 --> 03:18:04,430
And then also, he was kinda disrespecting your Oki like crazy.

5485
03:18:04,630 --> 03:18:05,450
We gotta tighten that up.

5486
03:18:05,690 --> 03:18:07,270
He was jumping back a lot.

5487
03:18:07,370 --> 03:18:08,450
I didn't think he kept...

5488
03:18:08,450 --> 03:18:14,610
He was avoiding the light kick into Oki after knockdowns because he would just jump back.

5489
03:18:15,010 --> 03:18:15,410
Right.

5490
03:18:15,570 --> 03:18:20,350
But then I only adapted to that at the very end and then he didn't do it anymore at the very end.

5491
03:18:20,350 --> 03:18:20,650
Right.

5492
03:18:20,650 --> 03:18:23,770
And then when you got that SBD Oki, he was just like mashing.

5493
03:18:23,850 --> 03:18:28,370
I think you do drive, rush, crouch, MK to keep it nice and tight and easy.

5494
03:18:28,510 --> 03:18:30,310
Just to counter hit him to keep him pinned down.

5495
03:18:30,550 --> 03:18:31,430
Stuff like that.

5496
03:18:31,510 --> 03:18:34,610
The safest guaranteed options.

5497
03:18:35,070 --> 03:18:36,030
We gotta work on those.

5498
03:18:36,910 --> 03:18:37,310
Okay.

5499
03:18:37,490 --> 03:18:38,090
Got it.

5500
03:18:38,650 --> 03:18:39,050
Alright.

5501
03:18:41,450 --> 03:18:42,070
Who's the next person?

5502
03:18:42,070 --> 03:18:43,070
You're also back rolling every time.

5503
03:18:43,910 --> 03:18:46,730
Which didn't matter that much because he didn't take advantage of it.

5504
03:18:46,850 --> 03:18:48,510
But against Jamie, quick rise.

5505
03:18:48,510 --> 03:18:50,330
Because you don't want to give up space.

5506
03:18:50,410 --> 03:18:50,910
How do you quick rise?

5507
03:18:51,090 --> 03:18:51,950
I don't know how to fucking...

5508
03:18:51,950 --> 03:18:52,790
Don't press anything.

5509
03:18:53,030 --> 03:18:55,570
If you press kicks or you're mashing, you'll get a back roll.

5510
03:18:55,750 --> 03:18:56,730
If you don't press anything...

5511
03:18:56,730 --> 03:18:57,350
Oh, it's another DJ.

5512
03:18:57,690 --> 03:18:59,050
You're used to fighting against that.

5513
03:18:59,390 --> 03:18:59,870
Got it.

5514
03:19:02,730 --> 03:19:04,250
Holy shit, all that parry.

5515
03:19:11,140 --> 03:19:11,880
Row looping.

5516
03:19:14,420 --> 03:19:15,140
Nice defense.

5517
03:19:19,540 --> 03:19:19,980
Whoa.

5518
03:19:23,950 --> 03:19:24,670
BEP now.

5519
03:19:36,500 --> 03:19:37,080
Nice.

5520
03:19:37,100 --> 03:19:37,280
Oh, wow.

5521
03:19:37,820 --> 03:19:38,900
Nice combo.

5522
03:19:45,990 --> 03:19:46,570
Nice.

5523
03:19:47,090 --> 03:19:48,230
Nice comeback.

5524
03:19:51,410 --> 03:19:52,910
Fucked up by being iffy.

5525
03:19:55,430 --> 03:19:56,870
Just want to slither, bro.

5526
03:20:07,570 --> 03:20:08,150
Nice.

5527
03:20:08,550 --> 03:20:09,430
Sneaky throw.

5528
03:20:10,470 --> 03:20:11,330
Oh, nice.

5529
03:20:20,940 --> 03:20:22,840
If he doesn't know it, you gotta grab him.

5530
03:20:31,880 --> 03:20:32,740
Nice and easy.

5531
03:20:32,860 --> 03:20:33,580
Yes, sir.

5532
03:20:33,620 --> 03:20:34,060
Nice.

5533
03:20:34,080 --> 03:20:35,240
Well done, dude.

5534
03:20:35,600 --> 03:20:35,860
Let's go.

5535
03:20:36,560 --> 03:20:37,080
Cool.

5536
03:20:40,220 --> 03:20:40,880
Let's go.

5537
03:20:41,680 --> 03:20:43,380
I can take on this DJ.

5538
03:20:43,480 --> 03:20:44,180
I can take him on.

5539
03:20:45,380 --> 03:20:46,260
You should...

5540
03:20:47,720 --> 03:20:49,580
Maybe you want to swap with him?

5541
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:51,200
How do you feel about Jamie?

5542
03:20:51,580 --> 03:20:54,180
No, they should bump Roy up.

5543
03:20:54,200 --> 03:20:55,040
Maybe Roy should swap.

5544
03:20:55,040 --> 03:20:55,260
Why?

5545
03:20:56,280 --> 03:20:58,320
I know he lied on that application.

5546
03:20:59,420 --> 03:21:00,120
Whoa!

5547
03:21:02,280 --> 03:21:03,940
Live on stream?

5548
03:21:04,880 --> 03:21:05,580
Damn.

5549
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:07,820
Clip it, guys.

5550
03:21:08,280 --> 03:21:10,700
RobPro calls Roy a fucking liar.

5551
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:16,600
He's calling...

5552
03:21:16,600 --> 03:21:20,080
What's that word when you, like, fill, like...

5553
03:21:20,830 --> 03:21:21,940
Put yourself lower rank?

5554
03:21:22,860 --> 03:21:24,060
I'm just gonna go with that.

5555
03:21:24,180 --> 03:21:25,860
Put yourself lower rank in the tournament?

5556
03:21:26,440 --> 03:21:26,920
Smurfing?

5557
03:21:27,380 --> 03:21:29,180
Oh, Roy's smurfing.

5558
03:21:29,540 --> 03:21:31,660
RobPro calls out Roy for smurfing.

5559
03:21:32,440 --> 03:21:33,780
I do not know that word.

5560
03:21:33,900 --> 03:21:34,700
Don't you play Overwatch?

5561
03:21:35,260 --> 03:21:36,600
No, there's, like, a word...

5562
03:21:36,600 --> 03:21:39,260
Isn't there a word for, like, when you sign up for a tournament?

5563
03:21:40,640 --> 03:21:41,380
Sandbagging, I think?

5564
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:45,420
Putting your rank as, like, lower than what it actually is?

5565
03:21:46,020 --> 03:21:47,200
Might be sandbagging.

5566
03:21:47,520 --> 03:21:48,200
I don't remember.

5567
03:21:49,540 --> 03:21:50,220
Could be.

5568
03:21:53,940 --> 03:21:54,200
Nice.

5569
03:21:54,460 --> 03:21:55,040
Good defense.

5570
03:21:55,940 --> 03:21:56,460
Lying.

5571
03:22:00,500 --> 03:22:01,680
Matt said lying.

5572
03:22:04,060 --> 03:22:05,700
You just want Kota to fight Roy.

5573
03:22:08,220 --> 03:22:08,740
Nice.

5574
03:22:20,290 --> 03:22:23,070
RobPro, you're really good at people who are very aggressive.

5575
03:22:23,550 --> 03:22:25,730
The moment they slow down, it's...

5576
03:22:26,550 --> 03:22:27,310
It's hard.

5577
03:22:28,590 --> 03:22:29,050
He's a good character, too.

5578
03:22:29,430 --> 03:22:32,270
You know, he has to do it carefully, I think.

5579
03:22:34,110 --> 03:22:34,930
One more.

5580
03:22:36,590 --> 03:22:37,030
Yes!

5581
03:22:37,030 --> 03:22:38,110
Is that gonna do it?

5582
03:22:38,130 --> 03:22:38,610
It's gonna be close.

5583
03:22:39,930 --> 03:22:40,370
Nice.

5584
03:22:41,670 --> 03:22:42,110
Easy!

5585
03:22:44,250 --> 03:22:44,990
2-2.

5586
03:22:45,850 --> 03:22:46,670
All right, coach.

5587
03:22:47,450 --> 03:22:48,590
Pretend this is the finals.

5588
03:22:48,650 --> 03:22:51,710
You have to win or we're not getting... we're not going to TwitchCon.

5589
03:22:52,030 --> 03:22:54,430
Have you ever heard of the concept of, like, no pressure?

5590
03:22:55,430 --> 03:22:56,830
To play better?

5591
03:22:58,790 --> 03:23:01,930
Pretend your family's all kidnapped, and you're gonna be murdered if you don't win this set.

5592
03:23:02,170 --> 03:23:03,510
Well, we're prepping you now.

5593
03:23:03,670 --> 03:23:07,690
We're training you now to handle pressure for Sunday.

5594
03:23:08,150 --> 03:23:10,230
I've never played in a high-pressure environment.

5595
03:23:10,430 --> 03:23:14,930
Yeah, like, on Sunday, you're gonna have to deal with the same things, so we're giving it to you now, so you're used to it.

5596
03:23:15,190 --> 03:23:16,590
It's like we're in a tournament or something.

5597
03:23:16,730 --> 03:23:19,330
The other coaches don't have this kind of training.

5598
03:23:19,690 --> 03:23:20,710
Just letting you know.

5599
03:23:20,710 --> 03:23:21,230
You'll be ready.

5600
03:23:21,290 --> 03:23:22,790
You're gonna crack on Sunday.

5601
03:23:23,210 --> 03:23:24,270
So you ready to play, Ko?

5602
03:23:27,310 --> 03:23:28,530
I got it, actually.

5603
03:23:28,730 --> 03:23:29,330
I got it.

5604
03:23:29,670 --> 03:23:31,290
We're all waiting for you.

5605
03:23:31,370 --> 03:23:31,590
Okay.

5606
03:23:32,270 --> 03:23:32,690
Let's go.

5607
03:23:32,950 --> 03:23:33,890
Oh, it's a nice Jamie.

5608
03:23:33,930 --> 03:23:34,850
That's why he's so good.

5609
03:23:35,810 --> 03:23:37,270
His coach is a Jamie.

5610
03:23:38,450 --> 03:23:40,290
Automatic is, like, a really technical Jamie.

5611
03:23:40,290 --> 03:23:41,590
He leveled up, too, a lot.

5612
03:23:42,030 --> 03:23:43,670
It was funny, because I was talking to him.

5613
03:23:43,710 --> 03:23:44,970
He's like, I can't beat the pro.

5614
03:23:45,090 --> 03:23:45,630
This sucks.

5615
03:24:09,010 --> 03:24:09,410
Nice.

5616
03:24:20,070 --> 03:24:21,070
Alright, here we go.

5617
03:24:22,790 --> 03:24:23,450
Oh, God.

5618
03:24:23,510 --> 03:24:24,570
Jamie's so obnoxious.

5619
03:24:27,050 --> 03:24:32,090
He's not up there in the tiers, but he's really obnoxious.

5620
03:24:32,110 --> 03:24:32,630
He is.

5621
03:24:32,810 --> 03:24:34,270
I hate playing S in the rank.

5622
03:24:35,430 --> 03:24:36,030
Me, too.

5623
03:24:36,470 --> 03:24:38,310
Yeah, I hate finding him in the rank, too.

5624
03:24:38,970 --> 03:24:40,910
Is he hard to play?

5625
03:24:41,110 --> 03:24:41,610
Is that it?

5626
03:24:43,050 --> 03:24:44,590
So, his moves...

5627
03:24:45,410 --> 03:24:47,230
There are certain moves that get unlocked the more he drinks.

5628
03:24:47,410 --> 03:24:47,530
Yeah.

5629
03:24:47,750 --> 03:24:49,910
Oh, if he has no drinks, he's kind of like, whatever.

5630
03:24:50,510 --> 03:24:52,710
So, it's up to the Jamie player to drink more.

5631
03:24:53,750 --> 03:24:55,150
Yeah, to make him drunk.

5632
03:24:55,790 --> 03:25:00,250
Yeah, but once he gets, you know, he becomes, like, a really strong character the more he drinks.

5633
03:25:01,310 --> 03:25:03,210
You just have to stop him from drinking.

5634
03:25:04,070 --> 03:25:13,710
But he has really good buttons, like, really obscure type moves that isn't really fun to deal with.

5635
03:25:16,110 --> 03:25:17,350
Yeah, he's burnt out.

5636
03:25:18,010 --> 03:25:18,890
It's time to go in.

5637
03:25:18,930 --> 03:25:19,790
Get in the corner.

5638
03:25:19,890 --> 03:25:20,250
Nice.

5639
03:25:23,610 --> 03:25:24,010
Nice.

5640
03:25:24,710 --> 03:25:25,110
Yeah!

5641
03:25:26,470 --> 03:25:27,950
All right, let's see if he has a...

5642
03:25:27,950 --> 03:25:29,230
Does he have a kill combo here?

5643
03:25:29,350 --> 03:25:29,890
I think he does.

5644
03:25:30,830 --> 03:25:31,390
Oh, yeah.

5645
03:25:31,650 --> 03:25:32,510
Bam, bam.

5646
03:25:32,930 --> 03:25:33,850
Bam, bam, bam.

5647
03:25:34,250 --> 03:25:36,730
Yeah, fuck that guy.

5648
03:25:37,270 --> 03:25:38,310
It was close.

5649
03:25:38,550 --> 03:25:40,110
I maybe could have killed him level two.

5650
03:25:42,330 --> 03:25:42,990
Yeah, yeah.

5651
03:25:42,990 --> 03:25:44,070
Yeah, you gotta secure it.

5652
03:25:44,090 --> 03:25:44,970
It's not worth the risk.

5653
03:25:45,110 --> 03:25:47,530
You're good.

5654
03:25:48,770 --> 03:25:50,250
Yeah, this is Sunday.

5655
03:25:50,270 --> 03:25:54,190
We literally need one more point to win to go to TwitchCon.

5656
03:25:54,410 --> 03:25:54,710
No pressure.

5657
03:25:56,610 --> 03:25:57,090
Seriously.

5658
03:25:59,370 --> 03:26:00,150
It's Sunday.

5659
03:26:01,390 --> 03:26:03,050
It's tiebreaker Twitch fight.

5660
03:26:03,750 --> 03:26:04,570
It's Sunday.

5661
03:26:04,730 --> 03:26:05,210
Tiebreaker!

5662
03:26:05,810 --> 03:26:08,550
We're fighting for fourth place so we can go to TwitchCon.

5663
03:26:10,290 --> 03:26:11,030
It's all right.

5664
03:26:11,030 --> 03:26:11,650
He's bending early.

5665
03:26:11,870 --> 03:26:12,970
Oh, he's gonna burn him out.

5666
03:26:12,990 --> 03:26:13,290
Yeah.

5667
03:26:15,050 --> 03:26:15,630
Let's see here.

5668
03:26:17,830 --> 03:26:18,590
Oh, God.

5669
03:26:18,630 --> 03:26:19,750
The throat goat, dude.

5670
03:26:19,910 --> 03:26:21,030
Oh, that did like no damage.

5671
03:26:21,910 --> 03:26:25,230
Yeah, this is where it gets hard.

5672
03:26:26,130 --> 03:26:26,810
Oh, here we go.

5673
03:26:26,850 --> 03:26:27,390
Give him a chance.

5674
03:26:30,690 --> 03:26:31,350
Oh, no.

5675
03:26:32,130 --> 03:26:32,630
It's okay.

5676
03:26:32,750 --> 03:26:33,970
He doesn't have any resources.

5677
03:26:34,250 --> 03:26:35,070
He's not gonna do much.

5678
03:26:36,050 --> 03:26:38,390
Oh, my God.

5679
03:26:39,430 --> 03:26:39,810
Okay.

5680
03:26:41,450 --> 03:26:42,690
We're going to TwitchCon!

5681
03:26:43,430 --> 03:26:44,010
Let's go!

5682
03:26:44,750 --> 03:26:46,090
Wait, we have one more set, right?

5683
03:26:46,630 --> 03:26:47,450
No, we have one more.

5684
03:26:47,790 --> 03:26:48,850
But we still cheer.

5685
03:26:49,010 --> 03:26:49,490
We still cheer.

5686
03:26:49,510 --> 03:26:50,030
Yeah, we still cheer.

5687
03:26:50,070 --> 03:26:50,510
We still cheer.

5688
03:26:50,530 --> 03:26:51,330
That was Sunday.

5689
03:26:51,470 --> 03:26:51,930
Let's go!

5690
03:26:52,090 --> 03:26:52,770
Oh, good confirm.

5691
03:26:52,950 --> 03:26:53,610
Holy shit.

5692
03:26:57,330 --> 03:26:58,050
Nice tech.

5693
03:27:01,230 --> 03:27:01,590
Ooh.

5694
03:27:03,770 --> 03:27:04,130
Oh,

5695
03:27:09,910 --> 03:27:10,390
he ledged across.

5696
03:27:10,510 --> 03:27:10,810
Nice.

5697
03:27:13,490 --> 03:27:13,850
Nice.

5698
03:27:13,850 --> 03:27:14,170
Oh!

5699
03:27:14,170 --> 03:27:16,090
Oh, that's gonna be so sick.

5700
03:27:17,450 --> 03:27:17,970
Woo!

5701
03:27:18,130 --> 03:27:18,650
Nice!

5702
03:27:18,650 --> 03:27:19,430
Call that shit out.

5703
03:27:22,370 --> 03:27:23,410
Oh, yeah!

5704
03:27:23,570 --> 03:27:23,890
Get him!

5705
03:27:23,970 --> 03:27:24,210
Yeah!

5706
03:27:24,210 --> 03:27:24,990
Put him in the corner!

5707
03:27:25,730 --> 03:27:26,250
Yeah!

5708
03:27:27,450 --> 03:27:28,290
Let's go, coach!

5709
03:27:29,470 --> 03:27:30,090
That's him!

5710
03:27:30,250 --> 03:27:31,030
I know that guy!

5711
03:27:32,590 --> 03:27:34,670
That's T-O-F right there.

5712
03:27:34,930 --> 03:27:35,330
That's T-O-F right there.

5713
03:27:40,810 --> 03:27:41,990
Oh, nice punish.

5714
03:27:41,990 --> 03:27:42,330
Holy shit.

5715
03:27:42,430 --> 03:27:43,330
Level 2 time?

5716
03:27:43,490 --> 03:27:44,330
The bottom!

5717
03:27:46,010 --> 03:27:47,430
Let's go, baby!

5718
03:27:49,290 --> 03:27:50,370
Oh, my God.

5719
03:27:50,410 --> 03:27:51,510
These combos are so cool.

5720
03:27:51,550 --> 03:27:52,330
That is so sick, dude.

5721
03:27:52,330 --> 03:27:53,090
Oh, my God.

5722
03:27:53,370 --> 03:27:54,850
Wait, maybe... I have an idea.

5723
03:27:54,870 --> 03:27:56,710
Brawl Pro should learn Ed just for...

5724
03:27:56,710 --> 03:27:58,030
I don't have time.

5725
03:27:58,210 --> 03:27:58,990
I don't have time.

5726
03:28:00,370 --> 03:28:00,810
Just learn Jamie.

5727
03:28:03,070 --> 03:28:06,310
Just learn Ed for the Jamie matchup.

5728
03:28:06,330 --> 03:28:07,530
That's all you need to know.

5729
03:28:08,950 --> 03:28:09,430
Uh-oh.

5730
03:28:09,430 --> 03:28:09,790
Hold on.

5731
03:28:09,830 --> 03:28:10,870
Wait, does he... Oh.

5732
03:28:11,050 --> 03:28:13,230
Yeah, so he gets instantly drunk when he does...

5733
03:28:13,230 --> 03:28:14,770
But his hair is still tied up.

5734
03:28:15,370 --> 03:28:16,790
Yeah, but his shirt's open.

5735
03:28:16,890 --> 03:28:17,370
See his shirt?

5736
03:28:18,130 --> 03:28:18,390
His shirt is open.

5737
03:28:18,570 --> 03:28:18,790
Oh, here we go!

5738
03:28:19,230 --> 03:28:20,030
Get him!

5739
03:28:20,170 --> 03:28:20,970
Kill him, coach!

5740
03:28:21,210 --> 03:28:22,090
Bring it home!

5741
03:28:22,170 --> 03:28:22,830
Bring it home!

5742
03:28:23,250 --> 03:28:23,770
Let's go!

5743
03:28:25,790 --> 03:28:26,830
Twitch, let's go!

5744
03:28:27,890 --> 03:28:29,310
End the day with a win.

5745
03:28:29,830 --> 03:28:30,710
We did it!

5746
03:28:33,950 --> 03:28:35,350
We're going to Korea!

5747
03:28:35,730 --> 03:28:37,870
The kidnappers let your family go!

5748
03:28:38,630 --> 03:28:39,090
Here we go.

5749
03:28:41,970 --> 03:28:42,710
Hell yeah.

5750
03:28:42,890 --> 03:28:43,410
GG's.

5751
03:28:43,430 --> 03:28:43,790
GG's.

5752
03:28:44,050 --> 03:28:44,430
Yay!

5753
03:28:44,430 --> 03:28:46,450
Did we beat this team overall?

5754
03:28:46,730 --> 03:28:47,390
What was our record?

5755
03:28:48,830 --> 03:28:50,190
We tied with...

5756
03:28:50,190 --> 03:28:51,970
We tied with Shine's team.

5757
03:28:53,150 --> 03:28:54,530
Wait, isn't this...

5758
03:28:54,530 --> 03:28:56,490
I think we won 3-2.

5759
03:28:57,050 --> 03:28:57,930
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5760
03:28:57,930 --> 03:28:59,290
I think it's 3-2, yeah.

5761
03:28:59,490 --> 03:29:01,390
So basically you won it for us.

5762
03:29:01,570 --> 03:29:03,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5763
03:29:03,570 --> 03:29:05,550
So we're basically...

5764
03:29:05,550 --> 03:29:10,090
Oh, it's a three-way tie between us, Bone, and Shine.

5765
03:29:10,910 --> 03:29:12,830
I don't know if that's updated, though.

5766
03:29:13,370 --> 03:29:14,350
For a second.

5767
03:29:14,730 --> 03:29:15,770
Oh, thank god.

5768
03:29:15,810 --> 03:29:16,970
First is Nephew.

5769
03:29:17,030 --> 03:29:18,570
They have 51 points.

5770
03:29:18,870 --> 03:29:21,190
Second, three-way tie is 36 points.

5771
03:29:21,850 --> 03:29:23,050
Jeez-a-loo, man.

5772
03:29:23,110 --> 03:29:25,130
Yeah, Nephew is a problem.

5773
03:29:25,690 --> 03:29:26,650
That's what I'm saying!

5774
03:29:26,790 --> 03:29:28,230
We need a Nerf Nephew!

5775
03:29:30,090 --> 03:29:31,370
Nerf yourself now!

5776
03:29:31,690 --> 03:29:31,990
Well, his team...

5777
03:29:32,970 --> 03:29:33,630
Nerf himself now.

5778
03:29:34,330 --> 03:29:37,210
Yeah, it's not a solo thing, right?

5779
03:29:37,250 --> 03:29:38,610
For me, I just lost every...

5780
03:29:38,610 --> 03:29:40,950
The games that are, like, counter-picked to Geve.

5781
03:29:42,230 --> 03:29:44,170
Because, like, Lillian and Lampo.

5782
03:29:44,250 --> 03:29:45,230
But there's key things.

5783
03:29:45,430 --> 03:29:51,730
Like, with most of our matches, there's very small things that we can pick apart real quick and, like, quickly identify.

5784
03:29:51,730 --> 03:29:56,370
Like, I'm pretty confident in a lot of these sets that we can all get more wins.

5785
03:29:56,630 --> 03:29:57,870
Like, very easily.

5786
03:29:58,230 --> 03:30:01,450
So I think, even though we're not in the lead...

5787
03:30:01,450 --> 03:30:03,130
So, did this update?

5788
03:30:03,290 --> 03:30:04,870
Are we tied for last?

5789
03:30:04,870 --> 03:30:06,130
We're tied for second.

5790
03:30:06,130 --> 03:30:07,190
It's a three-way tie.

5791
03:30:09,170 --> 03:30:10,010
Where is it?

5792
03:30:10,010 --> 03:30:10,310
Tied for second?

5793
03:30:11,270 --> 03:30:12,370
It's on the news.

5794
03:30:12,650 --> 03:30:16,710
If you go to the news and then you look at the score tracker.

5795
03:30:16,910 --> 03:30:18,190
But I don't know if that's updated.

5796
03:30:18,410 --> 03:30:19,010
That's the thing.

5797
03:30:19,030 --> 03:30:21,430
I don't know if it's updated or not.

5798
03:30:21,430 --> 03:30:22,490
How many points does it say we have?

5799
03:30:23,010 --> 03:30:23,410
36.

5800
03:30:23,990 --> 03:30:25,330
We have 36 points.

5801
03:30:25,790 --> 03:30:26,690
Is that accurate?

5802
03:30:27,750 --> 03:30:28,590
Okay, let's see.

5803
03:30:28,710 --> 03:30:31,590
Well, they didn't, on the challenge, they didn't update it.

5804
03:30:33,770 --> 03:30:34,390
I think.

5805
03:30:34,710 --> 03:30:35,490
Yeah, they did it.

5806
03:30:35,490 --> 03:30:36,550
I think that was a really good first run.

5807
03:30:36,550 --> 03:30:38,570
Yeah, we did pretty well.

5808
03:30:39,310 --> 03:30:42,430
Honestly, I was very surprised for myself.

5809
03:30:42,450 --> 03:30:43,950
I think we all did really good.

5810
03:30:45,170 --> 03:30:45,650
Yeah.

5811
03:30:46,470 --> 03:30:48,590
It says 39 points on mine.

5812
03:30:48,710 --> 03:30:50,530
Oh, maybe... Refresh?

5813
03:30:50,530 --> 03:30:52,250
Your coach, Brian, was...

5814
03:30:52,250 --> 03:30:54,010
Oh, we got second officially!

5815
03:30:54,490 --> 03:30:55,630
We're both second!

5816
03:30:56,490 --> 03:30:57,030
Wow, dude.

5817
03:30:57,570 --> 03:30:58,690
That's really good.

5818
03:30:58,770 --> 03:30:59,050
What the hell?

5819
03:30:59,330 --> 03:31:04,790
I know, like, Ko and SK, you both put a tier above what you put on the application.

5820
03:31:04,990 --> 03:31:06,370
That's pretty good for second place.

5821
03:31:06,550 --> 03:31:08,390
Wait, what are you talking about?

5822
03:31:08,430 --> 03:31:08,590
What?

5823
03:31:10,810 --> 03:31:12,430
Wait, you literally tweeted that!

5824
03:31:12,710 --> 03:31:14,210
Hold on a minute.

5825
03:31:14,210 --> 03:31:14,750
Friendly liar?

5826
03:31:14,910 --> 03:31:15,710
Why am I a liar?

5827
03:31:15,810 --> 03:31:16,370
Hold on a second.

5828
03:31:16,430 --> 03:31:20,230
No, I meant like you got placed, like, above because you were diamond when you started.

5829
03:31:20,530 --> 03:31:22,830
It's just like you don't really look like a master rank player coefficient.

5830
03:31:23,150 --> 03:31:23,530
I don't know.

5831
03:31:25,830 --> 03:31:28,390
No, I meant you're really good!

5832
03:31:30,210 --> 03:31:31,730
It's surprising how good you are coefficient.

5833
03:31:32,810 --> 03:31:33,170
Yeah.

5834
03:31:33,170 --> 03:31:35,410
Are you a fighting game streamer coefficient?

5835
03:31:36,690 --> 03:31:37,070
No.

5836
03:31:39,710 --> 03:31:42,470
Oh my god, it almost looked like you were a fighting game player.

5837
03:31:44,070 --> 03:31:44,690
Well, shit.

5838
03:31:47,030 --> 03:31:47,650
Well, shit.

5839
03:31:48,050 --> 03:31:52,430
No, I just, I mean, I was, I just don't really play this game too much.

5840
03:31:53,150 --> 03:31:54,170
No, you're cooking, dude.

5841
03:31:54,510 --> 03:31:55,210
You did great.

5842
03:31:55,630 --> 03:31:57,830
I think I'm carried by Aki, real talk.

5843
03:31:57,830 --> 03:31:59,870
I think I'm carried by Aki, real talk.

5844
03:32:00,490 --> 03:32:01,730
You got your flowchart, though.

5845
03:32:01,870 --> 03:32:04,950
You know how to implement a flowchart and execute it.

5846
03:32:05,030 --> 03:32:05,830
Like, that was really good.

5847
03:32:05,870 --> 03:32:05,990
Yeah.

5848
03:32:06,750 --> 03:32:16,990
I feel like I'm cheating too because, like, I watched Broski's guide and that guide literally, it was like giving me every single tool in the armory and I'm like, oh man, I don't even have to look for it.

5849
03:32:17,070 --> 03:32:17,730
It's just all there.

5850
03:32:18,350 --> 03:32:18,710
That's good.

5851
03:32:19,050 --> 03:32:19,410
Yeah.

5852
03:32:21,090 --> 03:32:22,650
I watched all three hours.

5853
03:32:22,770 --> 03:32:23,150
It was crazy.

5854
03:32:23,210 --> 03:32:23,950
What the fuck?

5855
03:32:25,030 --> 03:32:25,750
Holy shit.

5856
03:32:25,830 --> 03:32:28,790
I sat here in this chair and I watched all three hours.

5857
03:32:29,090 --> 03:32:29,690
Oh my god.

5858
03:32:29,690 --> 03:32:34,510
We'll work on, so BrawlPro, we just gotta figure out how to, what to do if you're getting lamed out, which I think is a poke.

5859
03:32:35,410 --> 03:32:37,910
Doki, we just gotta figure out a few key moves.

5860
03:32:39,330 --> 03:32:41,850
Like, Blanka command grab and a couple other moves.

5861
03:32:41,910 --> 03:32:43,390
You just need to see the animation a bit more.

5862
03:32:43,450 --> 03:32:45,130
We can go over that and then we'll smoke them.

5863
03:32:45,310 --> 03:32:46,030
I just need a block.

5864
03:32:46,030 --> 03:32:47,130
You just have to have the reaction.

5865
03:32:47,750 --> 03:32:48,810
The blocking was okay.

5866
03:32:48,910 --> 03:32:53,910
I mean, your defense could be better but I just think there's a few moves that caught you off guard because you've just never seen them.

5867
03:32:54,090 --> 03:32:55,970
Yeah, I don't bump into Blanka or Lily.

5868
03:32:56,170 --> 03:32:59,890
I bumped into every other character in my division except for Blanka and Lily.

5869
03:33:00,110 --> 03:33:01,430
So it's really hard to... Right.

5870
03:33:01,430 --> 03:33:04,690
So you can't be expected to know what to do if you've never freaking seen the character.

5871
03:33:04,810 --> 03:33:04,990
Yeah.

5872
03:33:04,990 --> 03:33:07,930
So now we know a few things to just dial in.

5873
03:33:07,990 --> 03:33:13,550
We can drill the moves and then you can just see them and react to jump or you know, lariat, whatever.

5874
03:33:13,990 --> 03:33:16,310
And Eskay, you're cooking too.

5875
03:33:16,450 --> 03:33:20,590
I think the only thing is we gotta work on which character you wanna play for what matchup.

5876
03:33:20,650 --> 03:33:21,790
We can decide that.

5877
03:33:22,390 --> 03:33:27,230
And then I see a few sequences that are gonna be easy for you to clean up on.

5878
03:33:27,410 --> 03:33:29,390
Like after Hazanshu, what to do there.

5879
03:33:29,970 --> 03:33:33,630
So I think that when they knew what to do after your Hazanshu, that's when they...

5880
03:33:34,250 --> 03:33:35,610
That's when they can give you trouble.

5881
03:33:35,890 --> 03:33:39,450
I would like go for the lightning legs but then I get punished really hard.

5882
03:33:39,470 --> 03:33:41,090
Yeah, cause Hazanshu is actually negative.

5883
03:33:42,450 --> 03:33:42,930
Yeah.

5884
03:33:43,030 --> 03:33:43,330
Right.

5885
03:33:43,690 --> 03:33:45,330
I thought it was plus the heavy.

5886
03:33:46,830 --> 03:33:47,310
Uh...

5887
03:33:47,310 --> 03:33:48,470
The heavy?

5888
03:33:48,550 --> 03:33:48,790
No.

5889
03:33:49,430 --> 03:33:49,910
Oh.

5890
03:33:49,950 --> 03:33:50,410
Nevermind.

5891
03:33:50,530 --> 03:33:51,170
Not bad.

5892
03:33:51,910 --> 03:33:53,090
Now you're making me trip.

5893
03:33:53,750 --> 03:33:54,230
No.

5894
03:33:54,230 --> 03:33:55,750
Heavy Hazanshu?

5895
03:33:56,370 --> 03:33:57,210
Hazanshu, yeah.

5896
03:33:57,310 --> 03:33:58,410
It's minus two.

5897
03:33:58,950 --> 03:33:59,430
Oh.

5898
03:33:59,970 --> 03:34:00,410
Oh.

5899
03:34:00,410 --> 03:34:00,690
Yeah.

5900
03:34:00,810 --> 03:34:01,570
It's minus two.

5901
03:34:01,670 --> 03:34:02,130
That's really bad.

5902
03:34:02,330 --> 03:34:03,210
I've been mashing up the risk.

5903
03:34:03,270 --> 03:34:10,030
I'm looking at the score sheet and I was the only one that beat Sykkuno which is pretty funny.

5904
03:34:11,090 --> 03:34:12,730
You didn't only beat him.

5905
03:34:13,110 --> 03:34:14,230
That's the only one.

5906
03:34:14,950 --> 03:34:18,490
No, I'm pretty sure I just tilted him so hard cause I kept bumping him into rank.

5907
03:34:18,770 --> 03:34:21,170
So he's just tilted at fighting me.

5908
03:34:21,170 --> 03:34:22,530
He sent you hate mail also.

5909
03:34:24,030 --> 03:34:26,810
He sent me hate mail about Thank you.

5910
03:34:26,810 --> 03:34:32,010
He sent me hate mail about Thank you.

5911
03:34:32,010 --> 03:34:34,170
He just really hates Zangief.

5912
03:34:34,390 --> 03:34:35,610
He doesn't know what to do.

5913
03:34:37,050 --> 03:34:41,610
You gotta understand that you are the most terrifying person in this entire event.

5914
03:34:42,910 --> 03:34:45,430
But then they're playing Black Gun Lily.

5915
03:34:47,390 --> 03:34:48,510
Lily's not terrifying.

5916
03:34:48,670 --> 03:34:50,270
They're annoying.

5917
03:34:50,610 --> 03:34:51,630
But they're not terrifying.

5918
03:34:51,750 --> 03:34:55,450
You have a terrifying character and I don't even think you realize how scary you are.

5919
03:34:56,810 --> 03:34:57,290
Very scary.

5920
03:34:57,290 --> 03:34:58,230
You gotta embrace that power.

5921
03:35:00,590 --> 03:35:01,110
Nice.

5922
03:35:01,230 --> 03:35:02,630
That was fun.

5923
03:35:02,890 --> 03:35:07,710
I think if I wasn't king on my very first game I might be the navel.

5924
03:35:08,990 --> 03:35:11,110
I don't even know why you did that.

5925
03:35:11,370 --> 03:35:13,130
I don't know how that...

5926
03:35:13,130 --> 03:35:13,970
I don't know.

5927
03:35:13,990 --> 03:35:15,970
I tried to say.

5928
03:35:17,270 --> 03:35:19,470
Sometimes you gotta learn through experience.

5929
03:35:20,050 --> 03:35:20,690
It's okay.

5930
03:35:20,710 --> 03:35:22,890
I threw in round one.

5931
03:35:23,090 --> 03:35:25,930
It would've been bad if I installed king during the finals.

5932
03:35:26,810 --> 03:35:28,130
I gotta use the bathroom.

5933
03:35:28,510 --> 03:35:32,270
You should add Gumi and be like I threw in round one just to let you know.

5934
03:35:36,230 --> 03:35:39,850
No, if I really want to be toxic I threw in round one and I'm still second.

5935
03:35:41,130 --> 03:35:42,090
Oh shit!

5936
03:35:42,290 --> 03:35:42,790
Get him!

5937
03:35:44,830 --> 03:35:47,430
It wouldn't be that toxic.

5938
03:35:47,950 --> 03:35:49,510
That would be toxic, dude.

5939
03:35:50,670 --> 03:35:51,770
Wait, it updated.

5940
03:35:52,170 --> 03:35:54,190
We're 39 it says now.

5941
03:35:54,930 --> 03:35:56,030
We're officially second.

5942
03:35:57,070 --> 03:35:57,870
We're full second.

5943
03:35:58,850 --> 03:35:59,890
Oh, nice.

5944
03:36:00,410 --> 03:36:01,290
That's why we're talking.

5945
03:36:01,330 --> 03:36:02,390
That's why we're talking shit.

5946
03:36:03,350 --> 03:36:03,870
Let's go.

5947
03:36:05,790 --> 03:36:08,810
No, you won a game.

5948
03:36:08,870 --> 03:36:11,010
You won the Chun-Li mix up.

5949
03:36:11,030 --> 03:36:11,430
Yeah.

5950
03:36:12,870 --> 03:36:14,190
Chun-Li mix up.

5951
03:36:14,330 --> 03:36:16,930
And your division is like demon hours.

5952
03:36:17,130 --> 03:36:17,910
So it's like...

5953
03:36:17,910 --> 03:36:20,050
So many hours.

5954
03:36:20,410 --> 03:36:22,270
They put you in a fucked up division.

5955
03:36:22,330 --> 03:36:22,930
Yeah, they did.

5956
03:36:22,930 --> 03:36:24,930
This is your first time playing Street Fighter ever, right?

5957
03:36:25,070 --> 03:36:26,650
Yes, I have 40 hours.

5958
03:36:27,030 --> 03:36:28,490
Yeah, you're doing amazing.

5959
03:36:28,630 --> 03:36:32,650
You're being thrown to the Sharks right now who have actually been playing this game.

5960
03:36:32,690 --> 03:36:33,350
And you're playing Chun.

5961
03:36:33,590 --> 03:36:35,330
Chun is hard.

5962
03:36:35,650 --> 03:36:36,790
Chun is a hard character.

5963
03:36:36,990 --> 03:36:37,710
Thanks guys.

5964
03:36:40,070 --> 03:36:43,650
If it makes you feel better, you're working way more than they are.

5965
03:36:45,010 --> 03:36:49,410
These people don't know a good day's work when they see one, alright?

5966
03:36:49,410 --> 03:36:50,090
Yeah.

5967
03:36:50,590 --> 03:36:57,990
Yeah, I'm watching your opponents and they have some flowchart shenanigans that the characters at their level are much easier at doing than Chun.

5968
03:36:58,130 --> 03:37:01,130
You picked a really honest character for picking up.

5969
03:37:02,390 --> 03:37:04,110
Locking injury on Friday.

5970
03:37:04,210 --> 03:37:06,410
I'll break down what they're cheesing you with.

5971
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:07,650
Yay!

5972
03:37:08,270 --> 03:37:12,410
How much was each win worth today and what is it worth on Friday?

5973
03:37:12,410 --> 03:37:14,250
Three points and five points.

5974
03:37:14,950 --> 03:37:15,510
Okay.

5975
03:37:15,670 --> 03:37:16,270
Yeah, yeah.

5976
03:37:19,410 --> 03:37:21,210
I think tomorrow we can like VOD review the matches.

5977
03:37:22,410 --> 03:37:24,310
I'm available all day tomorrow.

5978
03:37:24,570 --> 03:37:24,870
Me too.

5979
03:37:24,870 --> 03:37:28,370
We can all get on a call and kind of just VOD review everything.

5980
03:37:29,330 --> 03:37:31,210
I'll be available, you know, evening.

5981
03:37:31,410 --> 03:37:34,030
So maybe like 6pm central.

5982
03:37:34,490 --> 03:37:35,850
This guy and his job.

5983
03:37:36,430 --> 03:37:36,910
Yeah.

5984
03:37:37,890 --> 03:37:39,230
Wait, you have a job?

5985
03:37:41,550 --> 03:37:42,030
Unfortunately.

5986
03:37:42,430 --> 03:37:47,510
Why do you think like all the other coaches are available at 4 in the morning and...

5987
03:37:49,410 --> 03:37:51,510
I mean, Doki, I've been available to coach you.

5988
03:37:51,550 --> 03:37:55,770
You just hit me up when I'm literally like in bed, that Discord notification comes up.

5989
03:37:57,410 --> 03:37:59,270
Wait, you're a salaryman?

5990
03:37:59,490 --> 03:38:00,350
That's crazy.

5991
03:38:00,530 --> 03:38:00,990
Really?

5992
03:38:02,230 --> 03:38:06,510
No, I work remote these days so it's much easier.

5993
03:38:06,650 --> 03:38:08,190
So I can sneak some, you know...

5994
03:38:09,370 --> 03:38:10,430
It's not that bad.

5995
03:38:10,430 --> 03:38:12,430
I'm not like fucking out there doing a hard day's labor.

5996
03:38:15,350 --> 03:38:18,410
Dude, you're a salaryman and you're still kicking ass like that?

5997
03:38:18,450 --> 03:38:19,690
Yeah, exactly.

5998
03:38:20,390 --> 03:38:22,570
But I think I only beat the other salarymen.

5999
03:38:22,730 --> 03:38:24,290
Wait, the others are salarymen too?

6000
03:38:26,070 --> 03:38:27,910
Diaphone and Jibba Automatic.

6001
03:38:28,310 --> 03:38:30,450
Well, actually Automatic might be full-time concentration.

6002
03:38:30,690 --> 03:38:32,810
I know Diaphone has a job.

6003
03:38:33,010 --> 03:38:34,950
I think everybody else is like full-time.

6004
03:38:36,090 --> 03:38:37,390
Like professional stream player.

6005
03:38:37,930 --> 03:38:37,950
That's crazy, man.

6006
03:38:38,490 --> 03:38:39,110
That's nuts.

6007
03:38:40,830 --> 03:38:42,250
Well, that's why I was asking you BrawlPro.

6008
03:38:42,330 --> 03:38:43,310
You kind of trolled me.

6009
03:38:43,390 --> 03:38:43,990
I couldn't tell.

6010
03:38:44,050 --> 03:38:45,050
Are you a full-time streamer?

6011
03:38:46,090 --> 03:38:46,530
Basically.

6012
03:38:47,430 --> 03:38:48,250
See, I don't know.

6013
03:38:49,830 --> 03:38:50,910
Don't mix us up, dude.

6014
03:38:51,010 --> 03:38:51,430
We're your team.

6015
03:38:51,530 --> 03:38:54,270
I have very reduced hours nowadays.

6016
03:38:55,310 --> 03:38:57,250
So you can't justify it.

6017
03:38:57,810 --> 03:38:58,630
I got you.

6018
03:38:59,150 --> 03:38:59,590
Okay.

6019
03:39:00,790 --> 03:39:02,650
Literally, the stream does so well.

6020
03:39:02,750 --> 03:39:05,430
I literally can't justify working more.

6021
03:39:05,730 --> 03:39:07,230
No, I saw your stream numbers.

6022
03:39:07,330 --> 03:39:08,030
I was like, what the fuck?

6023
03:39:08,150 --> 03:39:08,870
That's why I was curious.

6024
03:39:09,910 --> 03:39:12,970
So Doki, we're talking because FGC streamers are poverty, right?

6025
03:39:13,430 --> 03:39:14,610
Oh, that's really odd.

6026
03:39:15,050 --> 03:39:17,130
I'm a full-time streamer.

6027
03:39:17,130 --> 03:39:19,530
It's actually a really unique thing.

6028
03:39:20,590 --> 03:39:22,650
BrawlPro had mad subs and I was like, what the hell?

6029
03:39:22,710 --> 03:39:25,390
It's so rare for a fighting game stream.

6030
03:39:26,070 --> 03:39:28,830
Fighting game streamers generally don't get that many subs.

6031
03:39:29,210 --> 03:39:32,330
There are some VTubers I hang out with and they're like, wait a minute.

6032
03:39:32,410 --> 03:39:36,110
There's people that full-time stream of fighting games?

6033
03:39:36,370 --> 03:39:36,650
What?

6034
03:39:36,970 --> 03:39:37,630
It's like, yeah.

6035
03:39:38,010 --> 03:39:38,850
You'd be surprised.

6036
03:39:39,570 --> 03:39:40,530
It's very rare.

6037
03:39:41,730 --> 03:39:44,350
This is why you got to take us to TwitchCon.

6038
03:39:44,430 --> 03:39:49,630
You have to take us to TwitchCon.

6039
03:39:49,630 --> 03:39:51,610
This is our full-time job.

6040
03:39:52,570 --> 03:39:53,190
This is our full-time job.

6041
03:39:53,190 --> 03:39:54,190
Are you even going, Doki?

6042
03:39:57,510 --> 03:39:59,390
A form of me will be going.

6043
03:40:01,030 --> 03:40:02,590
We have some plans.

6044
03:40:02,770 --> 03:40:03,730
We have plans.

6045
03:40:03,810 --> 03:40:05,690
It will be great if we make it.

6046
03:40:05,690 --> 03:40:07,390
Well, you know, right now, I'm not going.

6047
03:40:07,730 --> 03:40:08,550
Wait, you're not?

6048
03:40:09,050 --> 03:40:09,530
What?

6049
03:40:09,750 --> 03:40:15,570
I'm debating it, but I have the World Warrior, the Capcom Cup qualification tournament that weekend.

6050
03:40:15,930 --> 03:40:17,950
And I'm kind of in the game for my region.

6051
03:40:18,430 --> 03:40:22,130
That's alright, because then we'll just choose the...

6052
03:40:22,130 --> 03:40:23,450
Do you know anybody that's top 100?

6053
03:40:24,590 --> 03:40:25,750
Yeah, I can get a substitute.

6054
03:40:26,690 --> 03:40:28,130
I can pull streams.

6055
03:40:29,150 --> 03:40:32,250
Wait, who's below Nephew's rank?

6056
03:40:34,650 --> 03:40:36,450
He's like, what, top 18th, right?

6057
03:40:36,550 --> 03:40:37,650
Who's ranked 17th?

6058
03:40:37,650 --> 03:40:38,090
Who's right above it?

6059
03:40:38,330 --> 03:40:39,650
Who's right above his rank?

6060
03:40:39,650 --> 03:40:45,030
Nephew is probably the best NA player that would be available right now, so...

6061
03:40:45,470 --> 03:40:46,630
I wouldn't worry about that.

6062
03:40:46,710 --> 03:40:48,330
The thing is, you guys has got to carry it.

6063
03:40:48,370 --> 03:40:50,090
In that format, it's all about you guys.

6064
03:40:50,190 --> 03:40:56,870
I just need to impart my lessons on you enough to give you the playbook so that it could be Joe Schmoe up the street as the coach position.

6065
03:40:56,870 --> 03:40:57,490
Can we get Punk?

6066
03:40:57,690 --> 03:40:58,990
Yeah, I can message Punk.

6067
03:40:59,210 --> 03:41:01,590
I'll publicly at Punk right now.

6068
03:41:02,070 --> 03:41:03,470
Are you friends with him?

6069
03:41:04,330 --> 03:41:04,730
Punk.

6070
03:41:05,050 --> 03:41:06,150
I can hit up Punk.

6071
03:41:06,290 --> 03:41:06,850
I don't know if...

6072
03:41:07,350 --> 03:41:12,510
He's friends with Nephew though, so he might not want to... No, but that's the best part because he's friends with him.

6073
03:41:12,530 --> 03:41:13,670
He wants to kick his ass.

6074
03:41:13,810 --> 03:41:14,010
Yeah.

6075
03:41:14,710 --> 03:41:16,210
Like, he wants to kick his ass.

6076
03:41:16,270 --> 03:41:16,990
That's what friends do.

6077
03:41:18,390 --> 03:41:18,750
No.

6078
03:41:18,750 --> 03:41:21,050
Doki, you've got to start retweeting his tweets now.

6079
03:41:21,210 --> 03:41:22,610
No, I'll just add him.

6080
03:41:24,190 --> 03:41:25,450
Okay, straight up, Adam.

6081
03:41:25,510 --> 03:41:26,330
Sounds good to me.

6082
03:41:27,890 --> 03:41:28,370
So, yeah.

6083
03:41:28,690 --> 03:41:31,050
I'm debating though, so I'm undecided.

6084
03:41:31,070 --> 03:41:35,230
I've got to figure that out real soon, so I'll let you guys know if that happens, and then we'll...

6085
03:41:36,010 --> 03:41:38,650
We have to get in first before we even...

6086
03:41:39,650 --> 03:41:40,710
We have to think about this.

6087
03:41:41,490 --> 03:41:45,830
I'm still a little bit confused because you guys said on Sunday there's some playoffs, so does every team go?

6088
03:41:45,910 --> 03:41:47,370
I'm still confused about the fucking format.

6089
03:41:47,550 --> 03:41:48,310
What happens on Sunday?

6090
03:41:48,390 --> 03:41:49,850
Or sorry, the finals?

6091
03:41:50,070 --> 03:41:52,390
Two teams are not going to TwitchCon.

6092
03:41:52,690 --> 03:41:53,130
Yeah.

6093
03:41:53,230 --> 03:41:55,670
The top four is going to TwitchCon.

6094
03:41:56,130 --> 03:41:56,570
Okay.

6095
03:41:56,770 --> 03:42:00,630
But like, so on Sunday, like two teams are going to get eliminated on Sunday.

6096
03:42:00,750 --> 03:42:01,010
Yes.

6097
03:42:01,010 --> 03:42:06,450
So whoever is at the lower bracket and they lose their lower bracket matches, they are fully eliminated.

6098
03:42:07,030 --> 03:42:07,470
Yeah.

6099
03:42:07,470 --> 03:42:10,570
So if it's double a limb, and if you get out, you're done.

6100
03:42:11,290 --> 03:42:11,730
Gotcha.

6101
03:42:12,130 --> 03:42:12,570
Okay.

6102
03:42:12,630 --> 03:42:12,830
Yeah.

6103
03:42:12,950 --> 03:42:14,670
So Sunday is...

6104
03:42:14,670 --> 03:42:16,290
So if we get seeded, that'd be sick.

6105
03:42:17,070 --> 03:42:20,830
I think like if we get the buy, then we don't have to...

6106
03:42:20,830 --> 03:42:23,190
We're automatically in, right?

6107
03:42:23,450 --> 03:42:23,770
I think so.

6108
03:42:23,770 --> 03:42:26,590
You say double a limb, so we all start in winners?

6109
03:42:26,910 --> 03:42:28,130
Yeah, we all start in winners.

6110
03:42:28,250 --> 03:42:28,470
Yep.

6111
03:42:28,510 --> 03:42:31,090
It's a regular bracket, but instead of people, it's teams.

6112
03:42:31,550 --> 03:42:32,710
It's a six-man bracket.

6113
03:42:33,870 --> 03:42:43,230
So the first round is going to be four teams, and then the second round, people get a buy, and the teams that win the first round will play the second, the team that got buy.

6114
03:42:43,790 --> 03:42:45,050
And then the other ones go to losers.

6115
03:42:45,550 --> 03:42:49,050
We basically have to win one game if we get the buy.

6116
03:42:49,890 --> 03:42:50,330
Yeah.

6117
03:42:51,170 --> 03:42:52,210
Dine got ahead of us?

6118
03:42:52,250 --> 03:42:52,730
Wait, what do you mean?

6119
03:42:52,890 --> 03:42:54,810
It looks like we're in third.

6120
03:42:55,190 --> 03:42:58,170
So Nephew, Dine, then our team.

6121
03:42:58,530 --> 03:42:59,430
Aw, damn.

6122
03:42:59,550 --> 03:43:01,290
Aw, 42 also, damn.

6123
03:43:01,550 --> 03:43:03,490
They got one more set win than us.

6124
03:43:03,710 --> 03:43:04,750
They got one set...

6125
03:43:05,690 --> 03:43:07,050
They just refreshed.

6126
03:43:07,510 --> 03:43:10,550
So we're on a three-rate tie with Phones' team.

6127
03:43:11,870 --> 03:43:12,310
Yeah.

6128
03:43:12,310 --> 03:43:12,750
Alright.

6129
03:43:12,950 --> 03:43:14,310
No, no, we're ahead of them.

6130
03:43:14,330 --> 03:43:15,010
We're not tied with them.

6131
03:43:15,230 --> 03:43:15,970
No, we're third.

6132
03:43:16,350 --> 03:43:17,110
We're cleanly third.

6133
03:43:17,330 --> 03:43:17,810
Wait, what?

6134
03:43:17,870 --> 03:43:18,610
After we refreshed again?

6135
03:43:20,070 --> 03:43:21,630
This sheet is like bugging out.

6136
03:43:22,350 --> 03:43:23,450
Yeah, this sheet is fucked up.

6137
03:43:23,470 --> 03:43:24,230
It's still being updated.

6138
03:43:24,510 --> 03:43:24,770
Yeah.

6139
03:43:26,110 --> 03:43:26,770
It's full.

6140
03:43:26,810 --> 03:43:28,910
We're going to be last place.

6141
03:43:29,090 --> 03:43:31,010
I'm still higher ranked than Gumi's team.

6142
03:43:31,170 --> 03:43:32,290
That's all that matters.

6143
03:43:32,650 --> 03:43:33,490
That's all I care about.

6144
03:43:35,370 --> 03:43:36,770
I care about my own division.

6145
03:43:37,450 --> 03:43:39,930
These set wins keep trickling in somehow, I don't know.

6146
03:43:42,870 --> 03:43:45,190
Someone said, I think the scoreboard is wrong.

6147
03:43:45,470 --> 03:43:47,610
Shine should have 39, but I don't know.

6148
03:43:48,050 --> 03:43:50,470
I mean, we can literally count it right now.

6149
03:43:50,730 --> 03:43:51,110
Recount!

6150
03:43:51,290 --> 03:43:52,150
I demand a recount!

6151
03:43:52,230 --> 03:43:53,230
Alright, guys.

6152
03:43:53,910 --> 03:43:54,790
Stop the count!

6153
03:43:55,030 --> 03:43:57,010
Chat, I know you guys are better at math than me.

6154
03:43:57,090 --> 03:43:57,670
Count this.

6155
03:43:57,870 --> 03:43:59,170
I'm posting the link right now.

6156
03:43:59,390 --> 03:44:00,510
Wait, is the link public?

6157
03:44:01,310 --> 03:44:02,550
Oh, shit.

6158
03:44:03,530 --> 03:44:04,550
I think it is.

6159
03:44:04,650 --> 03:44:05,270
I didn't post it.

6160
03:44:06,270 --> 03:44:07,230
I don't know.

6161
03:44:07,330 --> 03:44:07,770
I think it is.

6162
03:44:07,930 --> 03:44:09,530
It's read-only, so it should be fine.

6163
03:44:09,670 --> 03:44:10,530
Guys, here's the link.

6164
03:44:10,530 --> 03:44:13,830
I literally have it pulled up with the URL there.

6165
03:44:15,030 --> 03:44:18,690
Okay, count it and see if Seijan fucked up.

6166
03:44:20,450 --> 03:44:21,730
It's got to be the jam, man.

6167
03:44:21,830 --> 03:44:22,470
It's got to be him.

6168
03:44:22,890 --> 03:44:28,450
In the last slam, my team was like fifth in seeding and we got second in playoffs.

6169
03:44:29,690 --> 03:44:30,090
Yeah.

6170
03:44:30,090 --> 03:44:32,030
The Friday is really different.

6171
03:44:32,210 --> 03:44:35,030
Tomorrow, people are going to be training really hard tomorrow.

6172
03:44:35,490 --> 03:44:40,710
During Tekken, they were hard trained for our team after the first round robin.

6173
03:44:41,410 --> 03:44:42,190
I remember.

6174
03:44:43,130 --> 03:44:45,990
They were doing bot reviews and everything.

6175
03:44:46,910 --> 03:44:48,010
Yeah, we're going to audit.

6176
03:44:48,070 --> 03:44:49,630
We're auditing Seijan right now.

6177
03:44:52,010 --> 03:44:53,050
Get audited.

6178
03:44:54,910 --> 03:44:56,010
Oh, she's correct.

6179
03:44:56,450 --> 03:44:57,190
My chat's...

6180
03:44:57,190 --> 03:44:58,850
You guys are so good at math.

6181
03:44:58,930 --> 03:44:59,450
What the fuck?

6182
03:45:00,670 --> 03:45:04,150
They're going to find another win for somebody else if we keep auditing them.

6183
03:45:04,330 --> 03:45:04,530
I don't know.

6184
03:45:05,310 --> 03:45:06,810
I'm happy with third right now.

6185
03:45:06,870 --> 03:45:08,070
I ain't trying to push it.

6186
03:45:08,310 --> 03:45:11,190
Oh, because they 3-2 die as team.

6187
03:45:12,210 --> 03:45:12,970
Oh, I see.

6188
03:45:14,270 --> 03:45:14,670
Okay.

6189
03:45:15,830 --> 03:45:16,230
Alright.

6190
03:45:17,570 --> 03:45:17,970
Alright.

6191
03:45:19,930 --> 03:45:26,730
There's some things that I think I can... I mean, we'll go over in bot review, but I think there's a lot Who did you even lose to?

6192
03:45:27,470 --> 03:45:30,670
I lost to Huntress and I lost to Chun-Li.

6193
03:45:31,750 --> 03:45:33,190
Yeah, Huntress and...

6194
03:45:33,190 --> 03:45:34,370
What was the other one?

6195
03:45:35,970 --> 03:45:36,650
Wasn't it...

6196
03:45:37,510 --> 03:45:38,650
I beat Akuma.

6197
03:45:38,970 --> 03:45:39,410
Boxbox.

6198
03:45:40,130 --> 03:45:41,610
But I beat him in ranked.

6199
03:45:43,770 --> 03:45:46,890
I think you can definitely beat him tomorrow or Friday.

6200
03:45:46,890 --> 03:45:51,350
When you're fighting Boxbox, that's going to be more about remembering to respect the Modern.

6201
03:45:51,590 --> 03:45:54,170
You have to alter your strategy when you go up against them.

6202
03:45:54,330 --> 03:45:55,590
I think you know how to beat them.

6203
03:45:55,670 --> 03:45:56,790
You just have to remember to do it.

6204
03:45:57,310 --> 03:45:58,490
That's a huge thing with Modern.

6205
03:45:58,570 --> 03:46:00,690
It's a different game when you're playing an actual Modern player.

6206
03:46:00,810 --> 03:46:01,810
You can't drive as much.

6207
03:46:02,130 --> 03:46:03,150
You can't jump as much.

6208
03:46:03,150 --> 03:46:04,330
You've got to remember to slow it down.

6209
03:46:04,510 --> 03:46:09,190
I think you could definitely fade out some of his DPs and his DIs when you're in the corner.

6210
03:46:09,430 --> 03:46:11,350
He was getting a lot of mileage out of those two.

6211
03:46:11,510 --> 03:46:12,890
Oh, that's how I beat him in ranked.

6212
03:46:13,030 --> 03:46:14,250
I jump a lot more.

6213
03:46:14,590 --> 03:46:15,830
And then he just jumps.

6214
03:46:16,750 --> 03:46:18,770
I jump and he DPs the other way.

6215
03:46:18,830 --> 03:46:19,870
I'm like, yeah, free punish.

6216
03:46:20,730 --> 03:46:24,590
In my chat, we have Shine petitioning to Sajam to get rid of our points.

6217
03:46:24,590 --> 03:46:27,590
We're starting a nasty battle here.

6218
03:46:28,630 --> 03:46:30,310
Sajam said, Shine, you're so right.

6219
03:46:30,450 --> 03:46:32,110
We gave Team Brian F too many points.

6220
03:46:32,950 --> 03:46:33,670
Wait, what?

6221
03:46:34,530 --> 03:46:35,090
No!

6222
03:46:36,510 --> 03:46:38,010
We're gonna work petition.

6223
03:46:38,450 --> 03:46:39,330
We're fucking around.

6224
03:46:39,990 --> 03:46:44,230
I was like, wait, the Audit fucked us over?

6225
03:46:44,590 --> 03:46:45,610
That's what I'm saying.

6226
03:46:45,690 --> 03:46:47,390
Sometimes it's good to keep your head down.

6227
03:46:48,210 --> 03:46:48,770
No!

6228
03:46:49,330 --> 03:46:52,570
The Audit fucked us over instead.

6229
03:46:52,610 --> 03:46:53,630
Wait, no shot.

6230
03:46:53,750 --> 03:46:54,230
Did it really?

6231
03:46:54,650 --> 03:46:55,430
Nah, dude.

6232
03:46:56,350 --> 03:46:57,730
Sajam got V-Bucks.

6233
03:46:57,890 --> 03:46:58,650
Who's bribing him?

6234
03:46:59,270 --> 03:46:59,930
Nah, dude.

6235
03:47:00,070 --> 03:47:01,130
They gave him V-Bucks.

6236
03:47:01,130 --> 03:47:02,270
That would be funny, though.

6237
03:47:04,550 --> 03:47:06,330
Who's gonna audit the Auditors?

6238
03:47:06,430 --> 03:47:07,130
That's true.

6239
03:47:07,450 --> 03:47:07,910
Yeah, dude.

6240
03:47:08,030 --> 03:47:09,590
We need Auditors for the Auditors.

6241
03:47:09,790 --> 03:47:11,830
If we're dead last, we got nothing to lose.

6242
03:47:11,930 --> 03:47:12,550
Oh my god.

6243
03:47:14,090 --> 03:47:15,450
Third is the ultimate.

6244
03:47:15,650 --> 03:47:16,510
Keep your head down.

6245
03:47:16,570 --> 03:47:19,970
That's great because everybody's gonna everybody's gonna Vaude review.

6246
03:47:20,470 --> 03:47:21,890
Shine and Nephew's team.

6247
03:47:22,010 --> 03:47:22,870
They won't care about us.

6248
03:47:22,890 --> 03:47:23,710
We're in the middle of the pack.

6249
03:47:25,150 --> 03:47:25,650
Exactly.

6250
03:47:26,110 --> 03:47:27,170
They're all just gonna...

6251
03:47:27,170 --> 03:47:29,010
We just gotta keep cool.

6252
03:47:29,090 --> 03:47:29,710
Do our thing.

6253
03:47:29,830 --> 03:47:30,130
Low-key.

6254
03:47:30,210 --> 03:47:33,530
They're just gonna do drills for Shine and Nephew.

6255
03:47:35,650 --> 03:47:36,150
Exactly.

6256
03:47:36,410 --> 03:47:42,330
Yeah, everybody's gonna train for Nephew's team, so nobody's gonna realize that no one's gonna care about us.

6257
03:47:43,010 --> 03:47:46,230
Lily, Skara, Red-Rite, Ross, Huntress.

6258
03:47:47,490 --> 03:47:50,030
That team is actually... they're all kinda good at their level.

6259
03:47:50,990 --> 03:47:58,810
I mean, we were We basically won 4-0'd Shine's team.

6260
03:47:59,070 --> 03:48:00,110
It was just a coach match.

6261
03:48:01,730 --> 03:48:05,990
My chat's telling me Fumi was 2-3, not 3-2.

6262
03:48:07,070 --> 03:48:08,450
Oh, we got the auditors on.

6263
03:48:09,370 --> 03:48:11,010
Get the jam man on the phone.

6264
03:48:11,250 --> 03:48:12,510
Get the jam man on the phone.

6265
03:48:13,110 --> 03:48:14,590
Wait, for us or them?

6266
03:48:15,890 --> 03:48:16,870
What are you talking about?

6267
03:48:18,050 --> 03:48:19,310
Us versus Fumi.

6268
03:48:19,310 --> 03:48:21,090
I'm just saying what the chat's saying.

6269
03:48:21,290 --> 03:48:22,170
Don't listen to chat?

6270
03:48:22,290 --> 03:48:23,110
Okay, I don't know.

6271
03:48:23,410 --> 03:48:24,310
I was just...

6272
03:48:25,150 --> 03:48:26,910
We're grasping at straws here.

6273
03:48:27,050 --> 03:48:28,210
We speak, we're in big trouble.

6274
03:48:28,450 --> 03:48:31,670
Is this good for us or bad for us?

6275
03:48:35,090 --> 03:48:36,950
Imagine them listening to this chat.

6276
03:48:37,050 --> 03:48:37,810
We got it right.

6277
03:48:38,270 --> 03:48:46,310
But when it comes to Roy, I played him for the Tekken one and he plays just like he does in Tekken.

6278
03:48:46,450 --> 03:48:48,330
He plays like a dick, dude.

6279
03:48:51,690 --> 03:48:52,230
Just...

6280
03:48:53,170 --> 03:48:57,590
Just swap Roy and who's the first seed?

6281
03:48:57,950 --> 03:49:00,430
I could definitely fight that DJ, bro.

6282
03:49:00,510 --> 03:49:00,990
I swear.

6283
03:49:02,410 --> 03:49:03,910
Swap the Jamie and the DJ.

6284
03:49:04,670 --> 03:49:05,570
That's our petition.

6285
03:49:06,010 --> 03:49:06,950
That's our demand.

6286
03:49:07,630 --> 03:49:10,630
He just lets you come to you and that's it.

6287
03:49:10,830 --> 03:49:15,010
And I think with Keith, it's the easiest to abuse that playstyle.

6288
03:49:15,250 --> 03:49:16,330
Yeah, it is.

6289
03:49:16,330 --> 03:49:20,170
But like Brian was saying, poking is probably your best thing.

6290
03:49:20,170 --> 03:49:23,030
Round robin results, Fumi is 2-3 not 3-2.

6291
03:49:24,470 --> 03:49:26,150
Yeah, that's what my chat was saying.

6292
03:49:26,190 --> 03:49:26,230
For who?

6293
03:49:26,230 --> 03:49:27,770
For us or...

6294
03:49:28,630 --> 03:49:30,450
For her, like Fumi in general.

6295
03:49:31,050 --> 03:49:33,330
Instead of her going 3-2, she went 2-3.

6296
03:49:33,510 --> 03:49:34,370
That's what they're saying.

6297
03:49:34,550 --> 03:49:34,810
2...

6298
03:49:35,470 --> 03:49:35,910
3.

6299
03:49:38,330 --> 03:49:38,770
Oh...

6300
03:49:39,470 --> 03:49:40,630
Oh my god, the audit!

6301
03:49:41,030 --> 03:49:42,390
Are we gonna win the audit?

6302
03:49:42,670 --> 03:49:42,710
2...

6303
03:49:42,710 --> 03:49:45,850
Oh, dude, we're actually gonna win the audit.

6304
03:49:45,970 --> 03:49:46,450
No way.

6305
03:49:46,610 --> 03:49:47,530
Oh my god!

6306
03:49:47,710 --> 03:49:48,970
We won the audit!

6307
03:49:49,510 --> 03:49:51,870
Dude, we're winning coin flips and audits.

6308
03:49:52,250 --> 03:49:54,650
She has two wins only.

6309
03:49:54,910 --> 03:49:55,430
Yeah.

6310
03:49:56,510 --> 03:49:59,130
She only has two wins, but it says 3-2.

6311
03:49:59,330 --> 03:50:03,070
How come this isn't I'm kinda confused why this isn't automatically tracked.

6312
03:50:03,710 --> 03:50:05,490
Call them out right now.

6313
03:50:07,770 --> 03:50:08,830
I don't even...

6314
03:50:08,830 --> 03:50:09,470
52 years on the line!

6315
03:50:10,430 --> 03:50:10,950
Yes.

6316
03:50:12,710 --> 03:50:14,610
Dude, we really are the heel of this slam, dude.

6317
03:50:14,650 --> 03:50:15,170
Oh my god.

6318
03:50:15,310 --> 03:50:16,390
I don't even feel good about this.

6319
03:50:16,390 --> 03:50:19,490
Every tournament needs a heel, and I gladly accept it.

6320
03:50:20,570 --> 03:50:22,490
I'll accept it for the rest of us.

6321
03:50:24,250 --> 03:50:25,110
Is it?

6322
03:50:25,210 --> 03:50:26,750
Am I counting this right?

6323
03:50:27,010 --> 03:50:27,190
Yeah.

6324
03:50:27,270 --> 03:50:29,970
You know SageM doesn't have a job.

6325
03:50:29,970 --> 03:50:31,510
This is manual, dude.

6326
03:50:32,530 --> 03:50:33,710
Yeah, how is this...

6327
03:50:34,690 --> 03:50:35,850
I don't know.

6328
03:50:36,530 --> 03:50:39,890
Yo, Bb is on one right now.

6329
03:50:40,390 --> 03:50:41,970
Oh, he's 39!

6330
03:50:42,170 --> 03:50:42,510
Yes!

6331
03:50:42,710 --> 03:50:43,590
We did it!

6332
03:50:45,270 --> 03:50:47,070
We had a two-way tie!

6333
03:50:47,290 --> 03:50:48,550
Let's fucking go!

6334
03:50:49,950 --> 03:50:51,870
Oh my god, we're tied for six.

6335
03:50:52,110 --> 03:50:52,610
Yeah!

6336
03:50:55,790 --> 03:50:57,410
Dude, we are so bad.

6337
03:50:58,670 --> 03:50:59,610
Well, I don't feel that bad.

6338
03:51:00,450 --> 03:51:01,430
Do you?

6339
03:51:01,510 --> 03:51:02,450
Do you feel that bad?

6340
03:51:02,770 --> 03:51:03,730
I don't.

6341
03:51:03,730 --> 03:51:05,650
See, I knew math was important.

6342
03:51:05,990 --> 03:51:06,770
I knew that shit.

6343
03:51:06,770 --> 03:51:07,270
I wanna recap.

6344
03:51:07,530 --> 03:51:10,190
Sean, I didn't even mean to get into this battle with you, man.

6345
03:51:10,370 --> 03:51:12,710
No, I'm here for the integrity of the tournament.

6346
03:51:13,230 --> 03:51:13,750
Like...

6347
03:51:14,510 --> 03:51:15,390
There it is.

6348
03:51:15,550 --> 03:51:17,530
The rent is on the line, alright?

6349
03:51:19,550 --> 03:51:21,790
This is as grassroots as it can get.

6350
03:51:22,250 --> 03:51:23,770
But now we're tied for seconds.

6351
03:51:23,930 --> 03:51:24,190
Yeah!

6352
03:51:25,530 --> 03:51:28,330
Guys, don't get audited or this is gonna happen to you.

6353
03:51:29,230 --> 03:51:30,210
Do your taxes.

6354
03:51:31,530 --> 03:51:36,510
This never would've happened if Doki wasn't bad at math and said, chat, audit this now.

6355
03:51:39,990 --> 03:51:41,890
She would've never had the idea.

6356
03:51:41,890 --> 03:51:44,910
Well, her chat said it was good, okay?

6357
03:51:45,230 --> 03:51:47,170
How was your chat that said it?

6358
03:51:47,190 --> 03:51:49,030
My chat was not good at math either.

6359
03:51:49,330 --> 03:51:51,170
They reflect the streamer.

6360
03:51:51,230 --> 03:51:52,750
They're saying, die phone shine is messed up?

6361
03:51:52,810 --> 03:51:54,590
They reflect the streamer.

6362
03:51:57,810 --> 03:51:58,850
Oh my god.

6363
03:52:00,370 --> 03:52:00,990
Amor too?

6364
03:52:01,670 --> 03:52:02,070
Oh yeah.

6365
03:52:02,290 --> 03:52:06,150
Did they fuck up other stuff too?

6366
03:52:07,230 --> 03:52:08,230
I don't know.

6367
03:52:08,570 --> 03:52:10,030
I think things are falling apart.

6368
03:52:11,510 --> 03:52:12,570
Not a way to math.

6369
03:52:12,590 --> 03:52:15,110
Sage, we won't fuck your TOs, man.

6370
03:52:15,730 --> 03:52:16,290
Don't worry.

6371
03:52:16,330 --> 03:52:18,170
Bright Shield won two Amor.

6372
03:52:18,350 --> 03:52:21,150
So, I think that counts as a win.

6373
03:52:21,710 --> 03:52:22,510
So are we?

6374
03:52:22,610 --> 03:52:23,170
It's okay.

6375
03:52:23,330 --> 03:52:24,590
We already got second.

6376
03:52:24,710 --> 03:52:25,790
We don't need to do any more audits.

6377
03:52:25,790 --> 03:52:27,470
We already secured second place.

6378
03:52:29,630 --> 03:52:31,230
We opened the can of worms.

6379
03:52:31,290 --> 03:52:32,210
It's out of our control.

6380
03:52:33,090 --> 03:52:33,970
Oh boy.

6381
03:52:34,170 --> 03:52:38,310
All I know is tomorrow we're gonna see a whole different score.

6382
03:52:40,030 --> 03:52:40,950
Tomorrow we're at last place.

6383
03:52:41,250 --> 03:52:43,970
Yeah, we see ourselves at last place.

6384
03:52:44,690 --> 03:52:46,790
Someone has an offshore bank account.

6385
03:52:49,150 --> 03:52:52,110
A Cayman account somewhere with a lot of money.

6386
03:52:56,470 --> 03:52:58,830
Guys, this is why we have to do our taxes correctly.

6387
03:53:00,670 --> 03:53:01,970
It's why I hire someone.

6388
03:53:02,290 --> 03:53:03,770
Yeah, exactly guys.

6389
03:53:06,050 --> 03:53:07,290
This was fun.

6390
03:53:07,410 --> 03:53:08,390
This was good.

6391
03:53:08,450 --> 03:53:09,210
I think we all did well.

6392
03:53:10,030 --> 03:53:10,470
Really good.

6393
03:53:10,730 --> 03:53:11,790
GG's everybody.

6394
03:53:12,530 --> 03:53:13,210
GG's.

6395
03:53:13,210 --> 03:53:14,550
You guys are kicking a lot of ass.

6396
03:53:14,950 --> 03:53:17,230
I had a lot of fun.

6397
03:53:17,850 --> 03:53:18,550
Thank you.

6398
03:53:18,750 --> 03:53:22,910
Thank you coach for helping us.

6399
03:53:23,670 --> 03:53:25,650
Yeah, so tomorrow I'm gonna be available.

6400
03:53:25,830 --> 03:53:27,550
We can do non-dgen hours.

6401
03:53:29,230 --> 03:53:32,730
Thank you coach for being the moral compass of the team.

6402
03:53:33,870 --> 03:53:35,470
Yeah, he's like responsible.

6403
03:53:35,470 --> 03:53:38,510
He's literally the only person with the moral compass.

6404
03:53:40,030 --> 03:53:45,430
I have to go eat dinner so I don't get acid reflux because I'm old and go to bed and get ready for work.

6405
03:53:45,990 --> 03:53:48,390
Salary man and acid reflux.

6406
03:53:48,530 --> 03:53:49,090
This is crazy.

6407
03:53:49,250 --> 03:53:50,590
That's my plan for the evening.

6408
03:53:50,750 --> 03:53:53,530
Good job squad.

6409
03:53:55,050 --> 03:53:55,610
GG's everybody.

6410
03:53:56,710 --> 03:53:57,630
Have a good night.

6411
03:53:58,230 --> 03:53:58,890
Bye bye.

6412
03:53:58,930 --> 03:53:59,550
Have a great time.

6413
03:54:00,610 --> 03:54:01,090
GG's.

6414
03:54:01,450 --> 03:54:02,090
Bye bye.

6415
03:54:02,910 --> 03:54:03,570
Bye bye.

6416
03:54:05,810 --> 03:54:07,010
Oh my god.

6417
03:54:07,010 --> 03:54:11,050
I am I'm actually really surprised how well I did today.

6418
03:54:11,850 --> 03:54:15,630
I was not I honestly was like okay I'm gonna win one game and that's it.

6419
03:54:15,730 --> 03:54:19,590
I was not confident at all.

6420
03:54:19,730 --> 03:54:22,170
Like everybody was grinding so much.

6421
03:54:22,470 --> 03:54:23,870
And like I don't know.

6422
03:54:23,990 --> 03:54:24,990
Like I'm not blocking.

6423
03:54:28,650 --> 03:54:33,390
So I'm happy that we did pretty well in the end.

6424
03:54:33,630 --> 03:54:46,270
And like we only lost our match ups because I trolled in the first game and I trolled in the first game and then on the first game I realized that I cannot be back seated like live.

6425
03:54:46,610 --> 03:54:49,970
Like my brain overloads during the tournament.

6426
03:54:50,170 --> 03:54:57,690
It's fine like when it's like regular rank but during the tournament like my mind actually over simulates cause I like don't know what to do.

6427
03:55:00,790 --> 03:55:02,790
And the king thing was not it.

6428
03:55:04,890 --> 03:55:05,910
I was very nervous.

6429
03:55:05,970 --> 03:55:10,310
First games I'm always very nervous on on the first game.

6430
03:55:10,530 --> 03:55:11,490
I'm always very nervous.

6431
03:55:11,790 --> 03:55:17,250
And like I'm also playing a Blanka match up for Gif is like the worst match up.

6432
03:55:17,370 --> 03:55:26,990
So like so like I was not I was not ready for like the Blanka match up cause like it's the worst match up for me and I don't play against a lot of Blankas in rank.

6433
03:55:27,610 --> 03:55:34,410
So I was really happy that in the end we only lost against the characters that were like Zeke Gif counters.

6434
03:55:34,470 --> 03:55:35,930
So I'm good with that.

6435
03:55:36,030 --> 03:55:38,710
I'm okay with that.

6436
03:55:38,870 --> 03:55:39,770
And we got second.

6437
03:55:39,990 --> 03:55:40,730
I'm really happy.

6438
03:55:40,890 --> 03:55:42,670
We were able to get second place in the end.

6439
03:55:42,930 --> 03:55:44,270
For the first day.

6440
03:55:44,670 --> 03:55:46,590
Anyway, fun team.

6441
03:55:47,270 --> 03:55:48,170
Fun games.

6442
03:55:48,350 --> 03:55:55,010
It took a while to like get into like the spirit of things because like I was super nervous in the beginning.

6443
03:55:55,510 --> 03:55:58,290
I was also like I was just full of hate.

6444
03:55:59,870 --> 03:56:03,770
Cause I was like cause rank makes me feel.

6445
03:56:04,970 --> 03:56:07,390
Rank really does make me feel dead inside.

6446
03:56:10,870 --> 03:56:16,330
But the team five is really good and that's all that matters.

6447
03:56:16,570 --> 03:56:17,650
I beat a plat player.

6448
03:56:17,930 --> 03:56:18,930
No, gold player.

6449
03:56:19,210 --> 03:56:20,950
So technically I belong in gold.

6450
03:56:21,170 --> 03:56:22,550
Anyway guys, I'm gonna call it here.

6451
03:56:22,810 --> 03:56:23,650
I'm gonna rest up.

6452
03:56:23,730 --> 03:56:25,330
As always everybody stay hydrated.

6453
03:56:25,650 --> 03:56:26,150
Posture check.

6454
03:56:26,230 --> 03:56:27,710
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6455
03:56:27,850 --> 03:56:31,490
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

6456
03:56:31,570 --> 03:56:32,770
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6457
03:56:33,030 --> 03:56:33,770
I'll see you guys on Friday.

6458
03:56:34,290 --> 03:56:34,870
For real.

6459
03:56:34,890 --> 03:56:37,310
For more Street Fighter Sajam Slam.

6460
03:56:37,510 --> 03:56:40,830
I'm actually really surprised that Street Fighter retweeted my tweet.

6461
03:56:41,010 --> 03:56:42,470
I was not expecting that.

6462
03:56:43,410 --> 03:56:44,830
Hey I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6463
03:56:45,210 --> 03:56:45,910
Bye guys.

6464
03:56:47,570 --> 03:56:48,010
Bye.

6465
03:56:48,010 --> 03:56:52,730
Also thank you Justin for coaching me and watching my stream.

6466
03:56:52,870 --> 03:56:54,090
I really appreciate it.

6467
03:56:54,090 --> 03:56:55,430
I hope I made you proud Justin.

6468
03:56:55,790 --> 03:56:57,090
I don't know if you're still here.

6469
03:56:58,090 --> 03:57:00,170
But I hope I made Justin proud.

6470
03:57:00,570 --> 03:57:01,410
I'll see you guys later.

6471
03:57:01,530 --> 03:57:01,830
Bye.
