1
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,180
Oh, sorry, immersion.

2
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,800
Oh, sorry, don't look at that.

3
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,860
Don't look at that.

4
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,200
There was a glitch in the matrix, guys.

5
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,300
I hate you, send to your meds in time chat.

6
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,380
There was nothing there.

7
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,100
There was nothing there.

8
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,900
Anyway, hello, everybody.

9
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,840
Hello, hello.

10
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,720
I am not looking forward to...

11
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,680
to the next part of Silent Hill, because I heard that the next section of Silent Hill is pretty fucking spooky.

12
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,720
Oh, why did I do this to myself?

13
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,180
I'm just... oh my god, why is this game so fucking scary?

14
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,640
I was... okay, I was actually...

15
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,240
I was actually, like, this close to UnSilentHill's Silent Hill.

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,260
I don't know if you guys saw the...

17
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:58,320
I don't know if you saw the mod, but somebody made a mod for Silent Hill where it just looks like a very nice city.

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,820
Like, it looks like a very... it looks like a... it looks like a nice town.

19
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:12,060
And I was... I was this close to downloading the mod, because I thought that was so fucking funny.

20
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,180
So basically, let me show you guys a picture of it.

21
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,560
Let me show you guys a picture, because I was like, oh...

22
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,140
Yeah, I was gonna... I was this close.

23
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,080
I need you guys to know, I almost did it.

24
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:30,460
I was almost that shameless to UnSilentHill's Silent Hill, because I was just so done.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,320
I was... I'll show you the picture.

26
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,480
It was so good.

27
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,400
Oh my god, this is the picture chat of UnSilentHilling's Silent Hill.

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,240
So...

29
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,580
And then I saw the picture.

30
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Wait, okay, let me see.

31
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,340
Oh my god.

32
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,340
And then somebody... somebody posted...

33
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,520
It looks so cozy.

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,460
I know!

35
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,860
It looks so nice.

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,480
It looks like such a nice town, chat.

37
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,160
Like, it just... it looks like...

38
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,440
And then there's a mod.

39
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,800
There's a... there's a mod that like...

40
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,340
That...

41
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,300
There's a mod that removes the fog.

42
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,560
And then I was like, bro, I won't...

43
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,380
I like... I like how the...

44
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,180
I like the... how the monster is just like, making my way downtown, moving fast.

45
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,940
Does it look so nice?

46
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
That's so wrong.

47
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,080
And then I almost...

48
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,600
There's another mod that removes the fog.

49
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,120
He's just out on the jog.

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,080
He's just out... just having a...

51
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,980
He's just doing... going through his day.

52
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,860
It looks... it just looks so much...

53
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,320
I don't know.

54
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,060
It just looks a lot cozy, you know?

55
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,260
He's just getting his groceries.

56
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,640
He's just doing his errands.

57
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,680
And I was this close...

58
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,100
Chat, I was...

59
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,960
I was this close to downloading both of those mods.

60
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,960
It's just... just for the sake of going...

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,180
Just for the sake of this...

62
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,960
Playing more of this game.

63
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,860
Anyway, Fiction for Eternity.

64
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,740
Thank you for the super chat.

65
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,480
Thank you, thank you.

66
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,680
I don't know if you're gonna see this.

67
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,240
I did, but I'm gonna keep trying until you see...

68
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,320
Oh, wait, I didn't see it.

69
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,560
Not a good user.

70
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,660
Thank you for the super chat.

71
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,540
Thank you, thank you.

72
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,400
Don't worry, Doki.

73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,320
I've confirmed the remake is only 10 times scarier than the OG game.

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,480
Thank you for the super chat.

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
Thank you, thank you.

76
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,500
I was this close, chat.

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
I was honestly...

78
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
It was almost there.

79
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,920
It was almost there, but then I also got lazy too.

80
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840
So my laziness won over the fact that like...

81
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,640
I could have made this game less scary for myself.

82
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,880
Also, if you guys didn't know...

83
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Life update.

84
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,460
If you guys didn't know, I finally updated my Twitch emotes.

85
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,620
So I finally added Twitch emotes and animated...

86
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,200
Because I just got my animated emotes yesterday.

87
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,040
So I figured, you know, I was like...

88
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,280
Oh, I got my animated emotes.

89
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
I might as well.

90
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,640
So basically...

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,280
Let me see.

92
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,920
Where can I put this?

93
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,080
We have animated emotes now on Twitch.

94
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,600
Yay!

95
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,380
So not only do we have...

96
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,360
So this is one of my favorite anime emotes that we got.

97
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,960
Right here.

98
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,280
I think this one's my favorite, honestly.

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,980
It's like lip sync to shut up and take my money.

100
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
So this is one of them.

101
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,340
And then we have a second version of this.

102
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,480
So where he's like...

103
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,400
And then we have a part two version where he's just screaming.

104
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,960
He's like...

105
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,500
So we have two.

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,200
Both of these are on Twitch right now.

107
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,000
Unfortunately, YouTube doesn't have animated emotes.

108
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,720
But if you subscribe on Twitch, you can use these emotes anywhere on any channel.

109
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,500
So you know how YouTube emotes, you can only use it on my channel.

110
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,060
But on Twitch, you can use it anywhere.

111
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,200
So yeah.

112
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,100
So I'm really excited that we finally have them.

113
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,160
And since we finally have animated emotes, I figured like...

114
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,780
Since I have animated emotes, I might as well update all my other Twitch emotes.

115
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,520
So Twitch emotes are fully updated now.

116
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,420
Well, not fully.

117
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm pretty sure I'm missing a couple of more emotes there.

118
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,400
But it's as updated as I could get yesterday until I got lazy.

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,880
James, thank you for the super chat.

120
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,700
Thank you, thank you.

121
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,040
I could be walking around nice wet, but no.

122
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,760
Gotta suffer while I search for my dead bitch of a wife.

123
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,940
Thank you for the super chat, James.

124
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,780
Thank you, thank you.

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,520
You could have had it, James.

126
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,760
If only I wasn't so lazy.

127
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,500
If only...

128
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,120
Oh yeah, and then we have...

129
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,340
So yeah.

130
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,200
For those who don't know where I stream on Twitch, it's literally Doki Bird at Twitch.

131
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,580
So this is...

132
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,040
Life is live.

133
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,720
Anyway.

134
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,060
Let me see.

135
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,360
Originally, we were given...

136
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,260
Originally, for the monkey, we were given this one.

137
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,820
But I wanted to...

138
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,180
But then I figured you guys also wanted the classic monkey too.

139
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,280
So other than monkey spin, we have the classic monkey banana.

140
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,560
So we have both for all of you guys.

141
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,020
So you get both the spin and banana.

142
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,980
So we have nostalgia and spin.

143
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,320
And then we also have...

144
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,960
I like this one too.

145
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,760
I like...

146
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,660
Doki run.

147
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,240
So we have run as well.

148
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,020
So yeah, that's like a little update on what we have for...

149
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
What we have...

150
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,960
What we did...

151
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,980
What I did yesterday.

152
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,300
I did so much stuff.

153
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,360
Oh my gosh.

154
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,740
Okay, I think I can...

155
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,680
I think I can say a little bit about it because it's not technically not leaking.

156
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,960
But I saw...

157
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,380
I saw my nendoroid.

158
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm so excited.

159
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm so excited.

160
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,020
I saw...

161
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,380
I saw my nendoroid.

162
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,180
You guys are...

163
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,600
Ah, I can't wait.

164
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Yeah.

165
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,660
Yeah.

166
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,800
I saw it.

167
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,860
I saw...

168
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,980
I saw...

169
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,760
They sent me...

170
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,040
They sent me the prototype.

171
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,180
And I saw it.

172
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,280
And I'm super excited.

173
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,480
And I can't wait for you guys.

174
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,880
You guys are going to love it.

175
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,800
You guys are going to love the things I requested.

176
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,600
Because there was a lot of freedom on what I could request.

177
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,260
On what I want.

178
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,380
And oh my god, you guys are going to love what I requested.

179
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,240
You guys are going to...

180
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,320
So I'm super...

181
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,140
Well, I won't say...

182
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,060
I won't say what I put on there.

183
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,140
But I think you guys are going to be really happy.

184
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,800
I don't know when.

185
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,440
I don't know when it's actually going to be shown.

186
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,700
But...

187
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,760
Because I was sent the first prototype.

188
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,240
Like, pictures of it.

189
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,880
So...

190
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,800
So I can't wait.

191
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,620
I can't wait.

192
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,100
Yay!

193
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,420
Bounty Hunter...

194
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,920
It really depends on the sales of the first one.

195
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,940
So like, you guys...

196
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,040
If you guys really want the Bounty Hunter, you gotta buy 20.

197
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,240
If all of us...

198
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:57,940
If everybody buys at least 5 dendroids per person, maybe we can have the Bounty Hunt.

199
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,820
No, everyone buy 50.

200
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,320
So you can have a full party, chat.

201
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,260
You want to have a full party, right?

202
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,480
Or buy 3, so we can have a full Apex party.

203
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,400
Uh...

204
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,940
How is that a scam?

205
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,760
It's called...

206
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,300
It's called fucking...

207
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,540
What was it?

208
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,620
Demand...

209
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,420
Supply and Demand.

210
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,860
It's Basic Economics 101.

211
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,200
It's called Supply and Demand, chat.

212
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,180
If there's enough demand, then there's gonna be more supply.

213
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:35,960
P.S.A.

214
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
Don't listen to this mod.

215
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,980
Don't...

216
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,920
Spend reasonably.

217
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,700
Hahaha!

218
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,780
Reasonably is 5 dendroids.

219
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,440
That...

220
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,420
Buy 60, so you can fill up an entire Apex lobby.

221
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,040
Silent the stream.

222
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,120
Anyway, um...

223
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,800
I'm super duper excited.

224
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,940
Ah, there's so many...

225
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,980
Oh my gosh, my...

226
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,340
Like, guys, I tweeted about it.

227
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,380
But...

228
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,860
By the way, I'm stalling.

229
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,300
Um, I am not...

230
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,160
I am, uh...

231
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm not...

232
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,440
I am shameless to tell you guys that I am stalling before I play Silent Hill 2.

233
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,580
Um, anyway, uh...

234
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,700
Anyway, um...

235
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,480
Oh, yeah, uh...

236
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,620
The next couple...

237
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,580
Oh my gosh, the next couple of months is gonna be so...

238
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,940
Not rough, but like...

239
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, I'm gonna be so fucking busy.

240
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,260
I...

241
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm gonna tell you guys straight, like...

242
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,100
It's so packed.

243
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,200
The next couple of months regarding the stuff I have to do.

244
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,960
So, I hope you guys enjoy the final months of 2024.

245
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,820
I have so many things planned for you guys.

246
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,560
And I'm super duper excited.

247
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,600
Uh, whenever all the things eventually get announced.

248
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,060
Yay!

249
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,740
Um...

250
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,360
Um...

251
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,740
Fiction!

252
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,180
Thank you for the super chat.

253
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,240
Thank you, thank you.

254
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,500
Here's some more, so please hear my plea!

255
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,340
Can you play Spec Ops Align?

256
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,640
I want you to be one of us when it comes to the horrors of war.

257
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,560
What is that?

258
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,120
Oh, so thank you for the super chat.

259
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,140
Thank you, thank you.

260
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,540
What the fuck is Spec Ops Align?

261
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,400
2012?

262
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,740
This game is alive?

263
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,840
Spec Align, the ops is no longer available on the Steam store.

264
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,580
Um...

265
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:40,650
Um...

266
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,030
What?

267
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,590
What?

268
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:48,970
Uh...

269
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,310
I don't know, man.

270
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,170
I...

271
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,410
I don't know what to tell you, bro.

272
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,130
I don't know.

273
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,250
I don't know what to tell you, bro.

274
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,470
Like, I can't...

275
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,830
I can't fix Steam.

276
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:05,950
Um...

277
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,090
Delisted moment.

278
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,210
Um...

279
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,230
Um...

280
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,330
Um...

281
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,370
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

282
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,570
Thank you, thank you.

283
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,810
Uh, thank you for the super chat.

284
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,470
Uh...

285
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,310
Wait, no way!

286
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,550
It got delisted due to musical reasons?

287
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,390
Oh, that's rough, buddy.

288
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,590
I'm sorry, man.

289
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:34,970
I'm...

290
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,830
I'm fucking sorry, man.

291
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,270
The goddamn music industry.

292
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,710
All right.

293
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,030
Yes.

294
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,410
I guess it's time.

295
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,230
I guess.

296
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,610
Okay, let me make sure my volume is okay.

297
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,730
Okay, let me save the sound settings for this.

298
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,250
I usually save sound settings for games that I think I'll play again.

299
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,830
So, I need to save this.

300
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,970
Uh, that's for Devour.

301
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:17,390
All right, and then where's my Silent Hill 8.7?

302
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:17,890
All right.

303
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,810
All right, here we go.

304
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,950
Here we go.

305
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:23,870
Oh my god.

306
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,230
Oh my god.

307
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,930
The worst part about this game is the fact that like...

308
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,050
James did not have to be such a fucking pervert.

309
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,610
Like, I...

310
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,300
James, if you were like...

311
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,300
If you weren't some fucking closeted freak, everything would have been fine.

312
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,120
If you were very open about what you like and what you want, James.

313
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
Like, if you were so open about...

314
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,640
He's a freaky freak.

315
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,620
Yes, that's the whole point.

316
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,880
Would you prefer the monsters to not be sexy?

317
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,300
I prefer the...

318
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,460
Okay.

319
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,720
I'm just saying is that if the...

320
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,480
If he was...

321
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,340
If he was, um...

322
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,860
If he accepted himself for who he was...

323
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,880
And didn't felt ashamed of his...

324
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,040
Of his kinks and fetishes, we wouldn't be here.

325
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,560
Okay?

326
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,840
That's all I'm saying.

327
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,940
We wouldn't be here if he wasn't such a...

328
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,360
If he wasn't so ashamed of himself.

329
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,780
I just need someone to match my freak.

330
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,460
You had Mary!

331
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,520
And then she died.

332
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,360
That's true.

333
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,260
But that...

334
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,060
There was the internet for a reason, James.

335
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,160
You have the internet to find somebody who match your freak.

336
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,280
Like, there is someone out there.

337
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,460
She was sick.

338
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,240
Yes, and she's dead.

339
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,440
And you have to find somebody else to match it.

340
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,780
Uh, thank you for the super chat, James.

341
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,280
Anyway, thanks for the super chat, James.

342
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,060
Thank you, thank you.

343
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,680
The mask stays on.

344
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,920
All right.

345
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,120
All right, so...

346
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,360
All right.

347
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,520
So we are back in the jukebox era.

348
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,960
The stupid jukebox era.

349
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,710
Wait, so Pyramid being a big buff half-naked man.

350
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,910
What did James mean by this?

351
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,110
Thank you for the super chat, Kaz.

352
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:43,870
Thank you, thank you.

353
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,350
Oh, you don't know?

354
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,390
He sees himself as Pyramid Head.

355
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,870
In his own fantasy.

356
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:02,370
James sees himself as Pyramid Head of everything he's been trying to deny himself.

357
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,370
Pyramid Head is him, but free.

358
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,330
Like, he's his self insert.

359
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,470
Like, he's literally...

360
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,430
Oh yeah, I forgot I was also dying.

361
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,390
Pyramid Head is...

362
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,730
He wishes he was him.

363
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,390
Exactly.

364
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,430
He wishes he was Pyramid Head.

365
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,690
That's basically him if he was...

366
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:32,370
If he unleashes his beast form, his true form, he would be Pyramid Head.

367
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,790
All right.

368
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,390
Okay, guys.

369
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,250
I know I'm stalling this, but I actually need to get a cough drop.

370
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,210
I'll be right back.

371
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,950
We'll just look at the door, guys.

372
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,950
We'll look at the door.

373
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,910
I'll be right back.

374
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,330
Okay, I'm back.

375
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,570
All right.

376
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,530
I'm back.

377
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,630
I'm finished stalling.

378
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:11,210
Guys, I know you've watched 500 million streamers already got past this stage because I waited a bit too long to do a part two.

379
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,930
But you don't understand, guys.

380
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,890
It's Silent Hill.

381
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:14,690
Like...

382
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:24,090
I know you already might have seen 500 million other streamers already got through this stage of the game.

383
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,130
But like, now you're gonna watch me try and get past this stage of the game.

384
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,870
Now it's my turn.

385
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,250
Oh my god.

386
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,170
How do I heal again?

387
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,030
Guys, I don't remember how to heal.

388
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,750
What are my controls?

389
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,450
Oh my god.

390
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:39,750
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,010
We're still stalling.

392
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,590
I don't remember the controls.

393
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,550
Give me a sec.

394
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,050
Okay, melee, dodge, space, reload, weapons.

395
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,610
Where the- They're struggling?

396
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,010
Where's heal?

397
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,730
Okay, V.

398
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:56,630
Okay.

399
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,690
All right.

400
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,710
Okay.

401
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,690
All right.

402
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,810
Stop lock time, let's go.

403
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,410
I'm ready.

404
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,110
I'm so fucking ready.

405
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,950
Does that mean I can lock this?

406
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,150
Oh my god, where am I?

407
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,910
Where the fuck am- Why is it so dark, guys?

408
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,590
Okay, sorry.

409
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,330
I- I thought about this for a while.

410
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,410
Like-

411
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,690
Why do I have to make this thing so hard?

412
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,650
Guys, I'm sorry.

413
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,930
I thought about this and I figured...

414
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,770
Guys, no, you don't understand.

415
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,810
You don't understand.

416
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,830
I need it to be brighter.

417
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,250
Can I not make it brighter?

418
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,610
Okay, graphics.

419
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,590
Okay, guys.

420
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,710
Wait, there's no... I can't make the game brighter?

421
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,590
Are you fucking serious?

422
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,950
Okay, alright.

423
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,970
It's under Gamma Calibration.

424
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:04,710
Thank you.

425
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,950
Okay, guys.

426
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,390
Okay, there we go.

427
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,790
Guys, I'm sorry.

428
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,810
Like, I can't.

429
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:21,550
Please just let me have it be just a little bit brighter, you guys.

430
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,850
It's so dark.

431
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,870
I can't see the action, please.

432
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,190
Okay, that's a lot better.

433
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,090
Please, please let me have this.

434
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:33,870
Like, please.

435
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,330
That's all I ask.

436
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,550
Let me have this.

437
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,990
Fiction, thank you for the super chat.

438
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,630
Thank you, thank you.

439
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,950
I've been trying to ask you to play that game for months.

440
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,070
But you missed them all, including how you're gonna have to find an alternate way to play it.

441
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,990
Oh, no.

442
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,610
Is it legal?

443
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,530
Are the alternative ways legal, though?

444
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,950
Thank you for the super chat.

445
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,950
Thank you, thank you.

446
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,070
Okay, guys.

447
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,010
Like, I still want sponsors.

448
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,330
Guys, I don't want to piss off game companies, guys.

449
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,030
Thank you for the super chat.

450
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,970
Thank you, thank you.

451
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,830
Cyber, thank you for the super chat.

452
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,490
Thank you, thank you.

453
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,630
Speaking of merch, have the YouTubes been shipped out yet?

454
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,550
I don't know, actually.

455
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,730
I should ask about that.

456
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:39,410
I remember when the estimated shipping was.

457
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,150
Does anyone remember?

458
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,610
It's been a while, so I don't remember.

459
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:47,870
November?

460
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:48,710
Oh, okay.

461
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,570
So next month.

462
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,130
I like that there's a little bit of sun here for now.

463
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,590
That's nice.

464
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,990
You came back after you left.

465
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,750
It's fine.

466
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,070
He didn't try anything.

467
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,470
He just seemed sad.

468
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,890
Mumbled about getting out of town with someone.

469
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,230
I wasn't gonna let him drive in his condition, so I locked him out.

470
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,750
His car should be out back.

471
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,390
Maybe check if it's still there by the morning.

472
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,590
It's a greenish-blue one.

473
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,710
Plate number ending with 06, I think.

474
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,810
Oh, this is the window I'm supposed to bash later.

475
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,790
Wait, then what's this?

476
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,950
Wait, what?

477
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,210
What?

478
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,870
Where was the car?

479
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,250
06.

480
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:33,670
Okay.

481
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,790
I just have to destroy the car.

482
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,190
Alright, guys.

483
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,610
I most likely will play 2 hours.

484
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,410
If I'm lucky, maybe.

485
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,830
If I'm lucky, 2 hours and 15 minutes.

486
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,610
Because I don't feel so...

487
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,970
I already don't feel so good.

488
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,270
I don't feel so good already.

489
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,870
Guys, I'm scared.

490
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,610
What do you mean?

491
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,070
I'm actually so scared.

492
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,730
I'm scared, guys.

493
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,070
Oh, no.

494
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,030
Wait, I can blame it.

495
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,410
Guys, I'm also sick.

496
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,680
No.

497
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,600
Guys, my tummy hurt too.

498
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,420
That's fine.

499
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,060
What do you mean lies?

500
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,420
I'm literally sick.

501
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,440
Guys, I actually have a good excuse.

502
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,340
It's just a game, Doki.

503
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,860
It can't hurt you.

504
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,000
Yes, it can.

505
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,060
This whole game is about mental pain.

506
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,980
And I'm feeling the mental anguish right now.

507
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,220
Oh, it's just a bug.

508
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,880
That's fine.

509
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,200
I swear, if it's just a bug and then the actual monster comes out and bashes my head.

510
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,060
I swear to fucking god.

511
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,480
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

512
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,300
Nope, bad.

513
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,060
Bad, nope, nope.

514
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,060
Oh, don't make me use it.

515
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,000
I've killed many.

516
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,020
I've killed many of my imaginary friends.

517
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,180
They're not real, so it's not murder.

518
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,000
Just so you guys know, they're not actually real.

519
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,200
Look out, Doki, behind you!

520
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,350
Where's the other one?

521
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,330
Oh, what the fuck?

522
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,410
You trying to sneak behind me, you little bitch?

523
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,270
That's right.

524
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,990
I ain't afraid of you.

525
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,630
Fuck these cars.

526
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,950
God, I should have downloaded the remove mods.

527
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:47,970
Shit.

528
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,990
I should have downloaded remove the fog.

529
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,970
Like, at least maybe if I got rid of the fog...

530
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,670
Things would have been better for me.

531
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,070
Oh my god.

532
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,620
Dan, thank you for the super chat.

533
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,880
Thank you, thank you.

534
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,360
Is there more meds?

535
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,780
Any more meds?

536
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:22,980
Hello?

537
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,820
Any more sick people in Silent Hill?

538
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,080
I request more sick people in Silent Hill which I can rob.

539
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,080
Dan, thank you for the super chat.

540
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,740
Thank you, thank you.

541
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,560
The original had a...

542
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,940
Had a screen noise effect that made the game look grainy like a film.

543
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,940
It's absence in this remake saddens me.

544
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,540
This game is too pretty.

545
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,300
Thank you for the super chat.

546
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,640
Thank you, thank you.

547
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,540
Oh no, thank god this game is too pretty.

548
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,180
At least it's less scary, right?

549
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,620
I like how you're willing to play this game but not Dead Space Remake and it's less scarier.

550
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,140
Friend, thank you for the super chat.

551
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,440
Thank you.

552
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,160
Oh, I did though.

553
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,220
And we finished it.

554
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,660
Dude, Dead Space Remake is a lot less scary than this game.

555
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,960
No, no, no, you can't...

556
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,800
As somebody that played all the Dead Spaces, it is less scary.

557
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,000
Because I have a fucking...

558
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,100
Oh look, just as I... I have a gun.

559
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,100
But like, the guns don't work.

560
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,720
Because the monsters in Dead Space, they stay dead.

561
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,100
But the monsters here don't stay dead.

562
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,080
Are you fucking...

563
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,760
Are you...

564
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,740
No, no, no.

565
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,400
No, no, no.

566
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,420
No, no.

567
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,160
Get out, get away, get away.

568
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,240
Okay.

569
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,960
That's fine.

570
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,700
Alright.

571
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,400
You fucking...

572
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,120
Oh, it didn't hit me.

573
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,720
Oh, it didn't hit me, thank god.

574
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay.

575
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,600
Okay, thank god.

576
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,000
Okay, that's good, that's good, that's good, that's good.

577
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,800
And then he's fucking crawling like a little...

578
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,080
Oh god!

579
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Try to be a goddamn...

580
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,980
How is a...

581
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,470
Nobody loves you!

582
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,810
Nobody loves you!

583
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,910
Not even your parents, and that's why you're orphans.

584
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,270
Okay.

585
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:38,910
There we go.

586
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,230
Shouldn't you just run away?

587
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,210
Yes, but I need loot.

588
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,310
I can't run away when there's all these cars out there.

589
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,330
But like I was saying...

590
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,210
As I was saying, I think...

591
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:00,650
I think Dead Space is less scary than Silent Hill 2.

592
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,010
Than Silent Hill 2 right now.

593
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,530
Because in Silent Hill 2...

594
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,570
I'm not a fighter, but in Dead Space I am.

595
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,650
So...

596
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,210
It's a lot easier to deal with, because I can just shoot them and then it's fine.

597
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,450
But...

598
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,230
I can't...

599
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,490
I can't fucking shoot these fuckers!

600
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,390
Okay.

601
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,450
Yeah, it's spookier too.

602
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,470
I'm not supposed to go now.

603
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,910
Oh my god, where...

604
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,830
Wait, which apartment?

605
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,570
There?

606
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,350
Main street?

607
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,110
Where am I?

608
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,320
Guys, I can't read them.

609
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,020
Oh, wood side apartments.

610
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,500
Oh, back there!

611
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,600
How the fuck do I get there?

612
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,560
The red square?

613
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,580
Where are my items?

614
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,960
Oh, fuck me, I didn't get a chance to read that!

615
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,060
Okay, sorry.

616
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:16,460
I didn't get a chance to read the key I got after getting fucking ran at.

617
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,720
Like...

618
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,480
Like, my bad!

619
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,100
Like, how was I...

620
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,600
I was told that there was no pauses when you're on the map.

621
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,120
I was fucking told there was no pauses.

622
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,820
Like, what the fuck was I supposed to do?

623
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,980
Oh my god.

624
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,360
Guys, how was I supposed to read in this condition?

625
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,160
Like, with all these fuckers just...

626
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,400
With all these fuckers!

627
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,300
Just there.

628
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,620
How am I supposed to read?

629
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,560
Alright.

630
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,240
Is this it?

631
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,860
They're still following me.

632
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,880
Jesus Christ, stop.

633
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,360
Alright.

634
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,440
Alright.

635
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,500
They shouldn't follow me now.

636
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,380
I'm inside.

637
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,480
Nice.

638
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,920
They shouldn't follow me now.

639
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,040
This is like a safe space, right?

640
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,920
Alright, and now I'm here.

641
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,430
Okay.

642
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,140
Oh, there it is.

643
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,800
It is safe.

644
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,160
Okay.

645
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,000
Okay, thank god.

646
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,140
God!

647
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,420
Thank god.

648
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,080
Okay, it's still safe.

649
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,680
JL, how much for four hours instead of two hours?

650
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,700
Thank you for the super chat, JL.

651
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,200
Thank you, thank you.

652
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,020
Guys, I don't think you can afford it.

653
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,520
Truthfully, I don't think you can afford my four hour fee.

654
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,660
Okay.

655
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:20,940
What is this?

656
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,640
Is this more meds?

657
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,520
Oh, thank god.

658
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,440
Oh, wait.

659
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,220
Handgun ammo for a gun I don't have.

660
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,150
Oh my god.

661
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,670
What's this?

662
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,270
Oh, it's the puzzle.

663
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:38,530
Oh.

664
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,850
Oh.

665
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:46,690
Oh.

666
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,990
Oh.

667
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,550
Oh my god.

668
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:49,970
Okay.

669
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,190
Three bright coins in the five holes be.

670
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,070
First sits the maiden underneath the tree.

671
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,110
The wind passed the bet.

672
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,170
Thank you for the super chat.

673
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,150
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,050
What if we paid 200 per hour?

675
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,490
Then you just need to pay 400.

676
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,490
Thank you for the super chat.

677
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,050
Thank you, thank you.

678
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,490
Okay.

679
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,290
The wind from behind the maiden doth blow.

680
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,090
A beautiful flower alone has to grow.

681
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,750
And here comes the man, so sleek and so fine.

682
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,490
In the pale moon...

683
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,370
That wasn't me agreeing to it.

684
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,050
I did not agree to the deal.

685
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,430
I was just stating a fact.

686
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,230
I was just stating numbers.

687
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,310
In the pale...

688
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,430
We didn't even have a contract here, guys.

689
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,750
There was no negotiations nor contracts.

690
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,150
And here comes a man, so sleek and so fine.

691
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,830
In the pale moonlight, his eyes doth shine.

692
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:58,570
Alright.

693
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,810
So, I have to find six of these.

694
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,460
Oh my god.

695
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,670
Bro.

696
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:10,930
I can't even...

697
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,890
Okay, there we go.

698
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,750
10 out of 10.

699
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:13,890
I need...

700
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,850
It's over, bro.

701
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,850
She's learned not to take benefits of us.

702
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,490
JL, thank you for the super chat.

703
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,050
Thank you.

704
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,930
Thank you.

705
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,850
Oh my god.

706
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,530
Why am I in a confined space?

707
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,250
Why am I in a...

708
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,890
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

709
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,270
Thank you.

710
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:41,950
Thank you.

711
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,130
Raise the count.

712
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,210
Why am I in a...

713
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,730
Oh my god.

714
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,250
I think that's the worst part.

715
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,290
I'm in like a confined area.

716
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,550
Like, and I don't even have a fucking flashlight.

717
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,990
Where's the flashlight?

718
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,570
How the fu...

719
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:05,970
Okay.

720
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,150
Alright.

721
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,890
Wait, I did not get everything?

722
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,930
Why is it still circled?

723
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,690
Did I not get everything in this room?

724
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,610
What am I missing in this room?

725
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,740
Is it worse?

726
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,060
Yes, this is worse than Ashley.

727
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,500
Cause like I said, like, even when you have a gun in this game.

728
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,840
Cause like, I didn't ever...

729
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,140
This is my first Silent Hill game.

730
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,040
But...

731
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,900
Oh, it's telling me where the puzzle is.

732
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,320
Oh.

733
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,820
Okay, even though...

734
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,940
Like, I know stuff about Silent Hill.

735
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,480
And like, even though this is like...

736
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,060
Um...

737
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,240
Um...

738
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,340
Even though this is like a...

739
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,220
This is my first Silent Hill game.

740
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,800
Like, guns doesn't matter.

741
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,800
Guns don't fucking matter.

742
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,820
Like, it doesn't fucking matter in this game.

743
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,000
Like, it doesn't matter if I shoot them.

744
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,980
They just come back alive.

745
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,800
Like, what's the point?

746
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,440
What's the point of your shooting?

747
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,600
If they just fucking live?

748
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,020
Like, I might as well just chuck my gun at them.

749
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,540
Like, it's just a waste of precious time.

750
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,460
Nice.

751
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,160
Got more ammo.

752
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,870
That's not killing if it's temporarily.

753
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,530
That's just me fucking staggering them.

754
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:34,930
Like...

755
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,090
It's...

756
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,030
It's not...

757
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,530
That's not what kill means, guys.

758
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,010
Kill means they're dead.

759
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,850
That's not what kill means.

760
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,310
Kill means...

761
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,750
Sayonara.

762
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,850
Goodbye forever.

763
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,980
Yuki, dad said he wants to play...

764
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,660
Wants you to play 4 hours for us.

765
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,880
Well, he wants a lot of things.

766
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,700
And if I give him all of these things, he...

767
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,880
He would not...

768
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,780
He would not be okay.

769
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,120
Some would say I would be a very bad owner.

770
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,900
Are you serious?

771
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,620
The fuck was that?

772
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
What the fuck was that?

773
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,290
I had a bet with you in Overwatch 2 a few streams ago.

774
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:40,390
So since I do not know if you made top 500 this season, you can be forced to play 4 hours this instead to make us both suffer.

775
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,390
Wait, what was the bet?

776
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:47,990
Oh, no.

777
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,310
Wait, what was...

778
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,410
What was our bet?

779
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,170
Wait.

780
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,750
I actually know.

781
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,910
Okay, if you...

782
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,770
Okay, if we both don't remember the bet, it's okay.

783
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,990
None of us remember what the bet is.

784
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,510
It's okay.

785
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,310
Thank you again for the...

786
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,210
I really appreciate it.

787
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,710
And we stay dead in buildings with a few...

788
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,750
What are the exceptions?

789
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,090
You can't stay with a few exceptions and then don't name the exceptions.

790
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,330
What does that mean?

791
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,010
How would I know which one is the exception?

792
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,190
Thank you for the super chat.

793
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:32,670
Thank you.

794
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,750
Thank you.

795
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,790
Okay.

796
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,950
Oh, my God.

797
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,390
I hate this.

798
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,970
I hate this so much.

799
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,610
Oh, my God.

800
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,190
I hate this game so much.

801
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,410
Oh, my God.

802
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,170
This game...

803
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,690
This game will be the fucking...

804
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,210
Oh, it's the mannequins.

805
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,470
No, it's the fucking...

806
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,710
Oh, my God.

807
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,630
No, not the mannequins.

808
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,470
Oh, I know what this is.

809
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,190
I know what this is.

810
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,230
No.

811
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,250
I know what this is.

812
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,890
Here's my flashlight.

813
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,810
It's the sexy legs.

814
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,330
It's the sexy legs.

815
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,330
James, I know you like legs.

816
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,630
James.

817
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,930
Oh, my God, James.

818
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,290
Why?

819
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,410
Oh, my God.

820
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,190
The fucking sexy legs.

821
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,890
Oh, hey.

822
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,630
Are those Mary's clothes?

823
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,650
Bro, if you love...

824
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,170
Oh, my God.

825
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,770
No wonder you're so...

826
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,130
No wonder your desires are so fucking suppressed.

827
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,950
Is this what Mary dressed like?

828
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,250
And then you're like...

829
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,630
It's like a Victorian girl.

830
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,770
You see a Victorian girl show a little bit of ankle?

831
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,870
And now all your monsters are just sexy legs.

832
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,450
Like...

833
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:28,570
When your fucking wife dresses like it's in the Victorian era and now you're fucking...

834
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,150
You're fucking...

835
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,730
You see an ankle and now you're...

836
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,690
This is all you see now.

837
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,790
This is...

838
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,330
This is all you see.

839
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,010
God damn it, James.

840
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,950
Damn it.

841
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,430
Oh, my God.

842
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,530
He just knows what he likes, guys.

843
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,350
He fucking knows what he likes.

844
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,730
Do I need to heal or should I get damaged a little bit more?

845
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,630
You know what?

846
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,370
I respect it.

847
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,890
Wait, where's like...

848
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,390
They punish him.

849
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,590
They punish him with a good time.

850
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,690
Don't...

851
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,110
Okay.

852
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,650
Should I heal now or should I wait until...

853
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,810
Should I heal now or should I wait until I'm damaged a little bit more?

854
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,370
I'm mad at James.

855
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,570
God damn it, James.

856
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,090
Thank you for the super chat.

857
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:39,490
Thank you.

858
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,250
Thank you.

859
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,850
Okay, I assume it's like...

860
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,630
I assume it's downstairs.

861
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,450
The shoot courtyard key.

862
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,290
I assume that's what it means.

863
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,300
Okay, maybe here?

864
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,360
No, that's not it.

865
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,660
Oh, it's the other side.

866
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,560
God, I don't feel so good.

867
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,040
I don't...

868
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,440
I don't feel so good.

869
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,500
I don't feel so good, James.

870
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,410
I'm gonna save just in case, James.

871
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,270
I'm gonna save.

872
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,250
I don't trust you, my dude.

873
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,250
I don't...

874
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:38,250
I don't...

875
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,650
Wait, did they remove that scene?

876
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,850
Did they remove the infamous pyramid head scene?

877
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,910
Then we'll actually know if it's Gooning Hill.

878
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,730
We'll know.

879
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:55,250
What?

880
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,770
They didn't?

881
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:03,310
Alright.

882
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,770
Oh, they did?

883
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,750
Poor pyramid head.

884
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:10,630
Poor James.

885
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,490
Even in the remake, his desires remain suppressed.

886
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,310
Okay, I guess we'll go this way.

887
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,360
What the fuck is in James' head?

888
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,280
Let him be free!

889
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,100
His wife is dead!

890
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,960
Literally, this is all he asked for.

891
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,560
His wife is fucking dead.

892
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,300
Let him be who he is.

893
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:40,980
Please,

894
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,160
he has nothing.

895
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,020
Stop judging him!

896
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,800
Warning, garbage chute out of order.

897
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,320
Do please not use until the problem is resolved.

898
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,780
Bro, there's so many problems.

899
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,220
What the fuck?

900
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,520
Let me through!

901
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,020
Here?

902
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,640
What the fuck?

903
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,000
Okay.

904
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,840
Question mark.

905
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,620
Did it look at the trash?

906
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,260
Oh, there it is!

907
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:28,560
Okay.

908
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,340
Where's the entrance?

909
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,320
Wait a minute, where am I supposed to go?

910
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,480
Give me a sec.

911
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
I need to know where I'm supposed to go.

912
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,100
I need to know where the entrance is.

913
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,340
There's an open window?

914
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,160
Oh shit, there's an open...

915
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,140
I should not be needing this.

916
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,920
I should not be needing this to go through an open window.

917
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:03,340
This is a problem.

918
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,820
You need to build up your upper body strength if you need an open window for this.

919
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,070
Oh my god.

920
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,910
Buried two inches in his neck.

921
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,410
Oh Jesus Christ.

922
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,290
At least get a fucking fork.

923
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,230
Oh my god.

924
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,790
He's trying to kill me.

925
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,350
He's trying to punish me.

926
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:12,230
That monster.

927
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,570
The red devil.

928
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:14,650
Forgive me.

929
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:15,630
I did it.

930
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:16,990
But it wasn't me.

931
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,970
I guess now that I think of it...

932
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:19,490
About it.

933
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,750
He was kinda cra...

934
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,270
Oh, just a little bit, you know?

935
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:23,090
Like...

936
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,490
Yeah, just...

937
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:27,890
You know.

938
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,030
You know.

939
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,690
Talking about the red devil.

940
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,150
Seems a little pretty fucking silly, you know?

941
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,070
Just a little silly.

942
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,510
Just a little bit odd.

943
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,230
But we didn't think much about it.

944
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:40,810
We're just like...

945
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,310
Oh, look.

946
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,010
Look at that silly Walter.

947
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,250
Saying all these things again.

948
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,190
Let's see.

949
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,950
Oh wait, is this open?

950
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,110
Oh my gosh, thank god.

951
00:47:58,590 --> 00:47:59,810
Why would you do this?

952
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,150
Why would you bait me with the option of opening and you don't even give me the meds?

953
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,930
How could you do this to me?

954
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:07,650
How?

955
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,730
How could you do this to me?

956
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:14,450
Alright.

957
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:15,910
Well, at least I get ammo.

958
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:21,370
Just a little bit.

959
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:22,730
He's just a little silly.

960
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,010
I don't know what else to say.

961
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,680
Not again.

962
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,760
Not again.

963
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,500
Not again.

964
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,220
Not again.

965
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,420
Where would he be in?

966
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,040
Not again.

967
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,600
He's outside, isn't he?

968
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,740
Oh my god!

969
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,020
Okay.

970
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,040
He tried to sneak up to me, but I heard the sound.

971
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:52,820
Okay.

972
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,460
Okay.

973
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,680
Okay.

974
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,040
Okay.

975
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:57,740
Let's...

976
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,880
Come on, Doki.

977
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,840
You got this.

978
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,440
Come on.

979
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,200
You got this.

980
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,180
It's just a door.

981
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,280
You got this, Doki.

982
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,620
It's just a door.

983
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,280
It's just...

984
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,380
It's just a door.

985
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,800
Alright.

986
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,500
Here we go.

987
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,040
We're here.

988
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,920
We're here at the door.

989
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,680
We're here.

990
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,740
Oh, I wish this was Red Dead Space instead.

991
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,360
Guys, I wish this was Dead Space.

992
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,920
Here we go.

993
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,740
Here we fucking go.

994
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,020
Alright.

995
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,280
Here we go.

996
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,740
Oh, there you are.

997
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,880
Okay.

998
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,180
Bro, I'm not stupid, bro.

999
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,180
Okay.

1000
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:06,920
Get out.

1001
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,980
Get out.

1002
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,160
I...

1003
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,800
Get out!

1004
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,780
I am a man of God.

1005
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,640
Do not tempt me, you seductress.

1006
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,360
Do not tempt me.

1007
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,480
That's right.

1008
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,060
Hellfire.

1009
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,880
How did he see me?

1010
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,640
Okay.

1011
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,840
Let's go.

1012
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,640
Where are we?

1013
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,840
Oh.

1014
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,580
Oh, there's handgun.

1015
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,120
Nobody can tempt me now.

1016
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,860
Let's see.

1017
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,600
Just in case.

1018
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,120
Be gone.

1019
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,060
Be gone.

1020
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,180
Be gone, seductress!

1021
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,500
Be gone!

1022
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,900
I am a man of God.

1023
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,020
You can't tempt me into the world of sin.

1024
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:07,780
Alright.

1025
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,080
I guess that's it.

1026
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,620
That's all?

1027
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,100
That's everything in this place?

1028
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,200
Okay, I guess it was.

1029
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,160
I guess it was everything.

1030
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,060
Just wanted to be sure.

1031
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,260
Go back at it again.

1032
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,220
Here we go.

1033
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,680
Don't listen to Toki.

1034
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,920
Dude, tempt me.

1035
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,440
Jeez, thank you for the super chat.

1036
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:37,860
Thank you.

1037
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,020
No, I got an achievement for opening a locked door.

1038
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,480
For trying to open a locked door.

1039
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,220
Alright.

1040
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,720
Alright, here we go.

1041
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,320
The hell?

1042
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,760
Wait, what?

1043
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,660
That was pointless.

1044
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,800
Did I get anything?

1045
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:22,490
No.

1046
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,910
Is there another window?

1047
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,520
The fuck?

1048
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,520
What was the point?

1049
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:42,310
What the fuck was the point of that?

1050
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,830
There's nothing there.

1051
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:48,830
I got ammo.

1052
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:49,890
That's all I got.

1053
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,490
That was literally everything.

1054
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,170
The shortcut to what?

1055
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,650
Was there supposed to be a mystic item?

1056
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,210
Where was the item?

1057
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:15,570
Mystic item?

1058
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,630
Oh, it's over there.

1059
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,750
Fucking hell.

1060
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,630
Alright, grab that key.

1061
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,250
The placement of that enemy is concerning because it was in the bathroom for me.

1062
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,770
The jumpscares are spot...

1063
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:34,250
Oh!

1064
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,590
Why is there a child here?

1065
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,630
Who fucking left this child here?

1066
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,990
This is not up to code.

1067
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,530
No children should be here.

1068
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:48,790
Goddamn children.

1069
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:53,030
Yeah, what the kids do... That's exactly what I'm saying, James.

1070
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,730
Not what the fuck do I do.

1071
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,110
That was literally...

1072
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,170
Fucking children.

1073
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,630
Oh, goddamn child.

1074
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,210
Oh, that child is so mean.

1075
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,590
Whose child is this?

1076
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,030
What the fuck do I do now?

1077
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:33,110
I guess like, I go on...

1078
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,130
But I don't have that...

1079
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,390
It's unlocked now?

1080
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,450
Maybe it's unlocked now.

1081
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,650
Maybe that area is unlocked.

1082
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:44,670
Right?

1083
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,590
I assume it is.

1084
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,290
I'm gonna save just in case.

1085
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:53,510
The fuck?

1086
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:58,810
Okay.

1087
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,530
Okay, it is.

1088
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,570
It is.

1089
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:04,530
Alright.

1090
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:06,370
Alright.

1091
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,610
Now the place is unlocked.

1092
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,050
Okay.

1093
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:13,610
The fuck?

1094
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:17,010
Wait, does that mean this area is unlocked too?

1095
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,710
Oh, it is.

1096
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,530
Oh, nice.

1097
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:19,890
Sweet.

1098
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:21,330
Alright.

1099
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,610
I guess I'll go to all these other rooms.

1100
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,180
Oh.

1101
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,340
Oh.

1102
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,560
Oh.

1103
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,760
Where is he?

1104
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,900
Where is he?

1105
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,160
Where is he?

1106
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:41,520
He's here.

1107
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,340
He's here somewhere.

1108
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,480
Oh, he's here.

1109
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,720
He's here.

1110
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,780
I know you're here.

1111
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,790
Get over here.

1112
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,410
I'm gonna fucking put this down inside your head.

1113
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:00,850
Oh, that's right, child.

1114
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,030
I mean, monster.

1115
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,190
I'm talking about the monster.

1116
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:08,270
I'm just, I'm just shimmying over there.

1117
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,170
I'm almost there, guys.

1118
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,490
Oh, I'm almost there.

1119
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,030
We're almost there.

1120
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,010
We're gonna make it.

1121
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,150
We're gonna make it.

1122
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:28,030
Okay, but before I do that...

1123
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,290
Let's beat up some legs.

1124
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,120
Where are the legs?

1125
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,680
Where is the seductress here to tempt me?

1126
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,200
Where are you?

1127
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,360
Where are you?

1128
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,580
I know you wanna tempt me again.

1129
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,740
Wait, what?

1130
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,520
What?

1131
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,020
Oh, hey.

1132
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:02,620
What?

1133
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,940
Where is she?

1134
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,600
Where are the legs at?

1135
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,080
I was so prepared to get tempted.

1136
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,520
I was ready.

1137
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:18,040
I was ready to let her try.

1138
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,640
What the fuck?

1139
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,920
She doesn't even wanna try?

1140
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Bro, I could've...

1141
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:28,760
What?

1142
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,840
She doesn't even wanna try?

1143
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,840
My biggest fear, a child.

1144
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,840
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

1145
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,300
Thank you, thank you.

1146
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,420
Why doesn't she wanna try?

1147
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,160
Oh, it's a wedding dress.

1148
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,800
Is that my wedding dress?

1149
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,520
I mean, my Maria?

1150
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:54,620
Huh?

1151
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,260
Alright, here we go.

1152
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,960
Here we go, back at it again.

1153
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,960
Here we go.

1154
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,340
We're gonna make it eventually.

1155
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,660
Here we go.

1156
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,180
Here we go.

1157
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,760
This is it.

1158
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:22,890
Alright.

1159
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:28,530
Legs?

1160
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,210
No legs?

1161
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:35,550
Okay.

1162
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,470
Oh, I guess I'll grab the key.

1163
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:46,330
Second floor, hallway key.

1164
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,270
Okay, that's for second floor.

1165
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,890
Alright, that means there's a monster right here.

1166
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,490
The legs has to be here, the seductress.

1167
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,840
She has to be here.

1168
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,480
Where else would it be?

1169
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,240
Einstein Blumen, okay.

1170
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,020
Where else would she be tempting me from?

1171
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,160
My god, it's so quiet.

1172
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,700
I think this is what I don't like.

1173
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,760
It's either like the spookiest fucking ambient noises ever, or it's so quiet.

1174
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,480
And then like, I'm so like nervous right now.

1175
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,040
I'm very nervous.

1176
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,920
It's like way too quiet.

1177
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,920
Bro, I played Fortnite.

1178
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,060
I'm using Fortnite strats right now.

1179
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,580
Bro,

1180
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,040
what the fuck?

1181
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,640
At least there's medicine there.

1182
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,960
God, I hate this at all.

1183
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,720
My god, my heart.

1184
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:23,440
If I had a heart monitor on right now, my heart is like through the roof right now.

1185
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,880
I'm so fucking... oh my god, I'm so...

1186
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,560
Oh, that's the child I'm gonna fucking find.

1187
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,620
I'm gonna find her.

1188
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:36,620
Okay.

1189
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:36,880
Okay.

1190
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,510
Alright, no seductress here.

1191
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:50,550
No legs to tempt me and to tempt me to sin.

1192
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:53,190
No Adam and Eve scenario.

1193
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,570
That's good to know.

1194
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,570
Can Adam and Eve this, bitch?

1195
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,770
Oh hey, the door's open.

1196
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,950
Hey, the door was never open before.

1197
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:06,050
Wait a minute.

1198
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:06,970
God.

1199
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,490
Wait a minute.

1200
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,200
Okay.

1201
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:20,880
Hello?

1202
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,740
Hello?

1203
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,460
Hello?

1204
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,340
No, it's not the same, guys.

1205
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,800
He's not... it's not the same, guys.

1206
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,480
You wanna throw up?

1207
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,260
Watch this.

1208
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,240
Oh!

1209
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,920
Okay, I need him to throw up first.

1210
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,980
There we go.

1211
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,000
That's right!

1212
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,040
Ha!

1213
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,300
Okay, dodge, dodge, dodge.

1214
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,220
That's right, I know your pattern now!

1215
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,360
That's right!

1216
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,880
I figured out your pattern, you bitch!

1217
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,560
That's right.

1218
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,520
I figured it out.

1219
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:08,900
Nice.

1220
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,720
Oh, now I can go here.

1221
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:12,660
Ooh.

1222
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,000
Ooh.

1223
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,360
Is there legs here?

1224
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,220
Is there legs?

1225
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:19,860
Any legs?

1226
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,740
Any...

1227
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,800
Any more temptations?

1228
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,420
Anyone else want to tempt me right now?

1229
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,360
Yeah?

1230
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,460
Anyone else wants to tempt me into sin?

1231
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,540
Oh, no.

1232
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,400
Okay, we're good.

1233
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:39,500
Okay.

1234
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,840
Okay, none.

1235
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,460
That's good.

1236
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,300
That's good.

1237
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,740
That's good.

1238
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,540
That's good.

1239
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,540
We don't have to deal with more.

1240
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:51,560
Alright.

1241
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,820
Please deliver this to Mrs. M...

1242
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,720
What the...

1243
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,680
What the fuck?!

1244
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,440
I'm trying to read!

1245
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,660
I really read!

1246
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,080
Don't ruin this for me!

1247
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,220
Don't...

1248
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,840
What would your Silent Hill monsters be?

1249
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,080
I'm already living through it right now.

1250
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:13,260
Mistakes.

1251
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1252
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,200
Thank you, thank you.

1253
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,140
That's all I need.

1254
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1255
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:17,940
Thank you, thank you.

1256
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,520
EversleepyVodWatcher here.

1257
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,940
Just popping in the super chat.

1258
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,160
Make sure we're still staring at the...

1259
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1260
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,500
Thank you, thank you.

1261
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,440
I'm really worried about her.

1262
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,520
She's been cooped up all along with his belongings for days on end.

1263
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,980
She won't even move them.

1264
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,860
And God forbid anyone else touch anything.

1265
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,140
It's breaking my heart just thinking about it.

1266
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,500
Unlucky.

1267
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,220
Poor guy.

1268
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,560
Just in case.

1269
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,580
Just in case.

1270
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,020
Oh, can't have no sinners here.

1271
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,380
No sinners in my area.

1272
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,420
Alright.

1273
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,280
Oh my God.

1274
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,920
Oh my God.

1275
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,800
We're okay.

1276
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:13,820
We're okay.

1277
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,900
I'm pretty sure this has to be...

1278
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,400
Do we...

1279
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,900
I'm pretty sure the apple goes up there.

1280
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,980
That's where the apple should be going to.

1281
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,200
Alright.

1282
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,540
I have the key to the second...

1283
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,140
I don't know if I should...

1284
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,340
Should I even go through...

1285
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,220
Do I go upstairs first or...

1286
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,500
Or go through that area, chat?

1287
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:51,000
Like, do I go upstairs or do I go through, like, the hallway of pain?

1288
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,020
Like...

1289
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,420
Kid, thank you for the super chat.

1290
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,200
The hallway of my...

1291
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,100
Of my inner dark thoughts.

1292
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,440
Thank you for the super chat.

1293
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:09,040
Kid, thank you, thank you.

1294
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,340
Yeah, but I have the key.

1295
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,060
I have the second floor hallway.

1296
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,520
Which one should I go first?

1297
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:23,800
I don't know if I should go through the hallway of my inner dark thoughts or, like, the second floor.

1298
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,220
Can't tell.

1299
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,380
Which one should I do, chat?

1300
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,360
Is it through that hallway?

1301
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,020
Is it through the hallway right now?

1302
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,620
The hallway I'm looking at at the moment?

1303
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,400
Where...

1304
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,240
Where all the...

1305
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,620
The sexy ladies are dancing over there?

1306
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:44,700
Where are you co...

1307
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,360
Oh, neither.

1308
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,200
You know neither.

1309
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:46,500
I'm...

1310
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:46,800
Okay.

1311
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,260
Alright.

1312
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,980
We're gonna go through the hallway of fucking ladies.

1313
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,220
I'm gonna...

1314
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,200
The freaky hallway.

1315
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,980
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1316
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,460
Guys, I've been hydrating a lot, okay?

1317
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,420
I'll be right back.

1318
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,420
I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

1319
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:34,950
I'm back, guys.

1320
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:36,490
I actually turned on the lights.

1321
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,190
I turned on multiple lights.

1322
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,050
In my...

1323
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,110
In my apartment.

1324
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,450
Just...

1325
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:45,650
Just for this.

1326
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:46,410
I had...

1327
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:47,650
I had to.

1328
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:48,590
I...

1329
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,330
I couldn't.

1330
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:51,530
Oh, my God.

1331
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:53,490
Oh, my God.

1332
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,110
It's too dark outside.

1333
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:55,650
It's too...

1334
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,630
It's too dark in this game.

1335
01:07:58,650 --> 01:07:59,210
Alright.

1336
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,930
Time to go through the hallway of my inner dark...

1337
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:03,830
Where did they go?

1338
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:06,330
Where did my...

1339
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:08,570
Where did my freaks go?

1340
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:11,410
Oh, there they are.

1341
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,710
I knew you guys wouldn't leave me.

1342
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,330
Get over here.

1343
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:17,230
Let's get freaky right now.

1344
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,050
Yes, I...

1345
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:21,510
Guys, I need you guys to know.

1346
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:23,770
My electricity bill is gonna...

1347
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,710
Go up now because of this.

1348
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:27,890
But it's worth it.

1349
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,930
Oh, I had a feeling.

1350
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,730
Yeah, he's charging it up.

1351
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,070
He's charging it up again?

1352
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:39,270
Oh, my God.

1353
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:40,470
Is he charging it up again?

1354
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,030
That hits me?!

1355
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:44,430
Oh, no.

1356
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:47,350
There's no more Mr. Nice Guy.

1357
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:50,330
Can't believe that hits me.

1358
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:54,870
I'm fucked up.

1359
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,790
I planned it and everything.

1360
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,030
Does he go through this?

1361
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:05,830
Oh, he does.

1362
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:08,650
Okay, just in case.

1363
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:10,010
Yes, I knew it.

1364
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:10,690
I knew it.

1365
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,030
Like, now I'm paranoid.

1366
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,130
Oh, nice.

1367
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:14,450
Okay.

1368
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:17,410
Are you fucking crawling now?

1369
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,250
You're crawling?

1370
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:19,970
You're fucking crawling?

1371
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,070
Okay, I'm a little...

1372
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,230
I'm a little...

1373
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,730
I'm a little...

1374
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:27,590
I'm a...

1375
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:29,490
You don't make me happy.

1376
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:38,450
You didn't follow the script.

1377
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,410
So, I'm a little peeved.

1378
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:47,450
You were supposed to follow the script, bro.

1379
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,660
Alright, any legs?

1380
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,460
Any legs in here?

1381
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,300
Any...

1382
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:02,460
Any...

1383
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,900
Any singles in my area?

1384
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,600
Okay, nice.

1385
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,620
Another health drink.

1386
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,400
Any single ladies in my area?

1387
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,760
Alright, here we go.

1388
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,160
Oh, I didn't open this.

1389
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:23,840
It didn't matter.

1390
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,680
Okay, I feel like I should heal.

1391
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,240
I feel like I should heal.

1392
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,240
I'll do it.

1393
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,510
Alright, off we go.

1394
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:42,290
Off we go to 101.

1395
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:52,580
Okay.

1396
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,200
Is that it?

1397
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,940
Is that really it?

1398
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,180
I only had a one...

1399
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:01,680
Okay.

1400
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,260
Why...

1401
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,900
Why did I have to go here?

1402
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,540
What was the point?

1403
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:09,800
Okay.

1404
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,180
That's alright.

1405
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,360
That's okay.

1406
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,800
I lost HP just to heal again.

1407
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,880
Got back the health drink that I lost.

1408
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,520
Please don't tell me I missed an item in there.

1409
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,660
I didn't miss an item, right?

1410
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,120
Did I?

1411
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:30,960
I don't know.

1412
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,740
I don't know.

1413
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,820
Cory, thank you for the super chat.

1414
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

1415
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:45,280
First time I finished Silent Hill 2, we had Tornado Drill Siren go off in the neighborhood on a foggy day.

1416
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,240
I cried and hid for an hour.

1417
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:51,060
You got this, Toki.

1418
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,800
Oh my god.

1419
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,520
I'm glad you're okay, bro.

1420
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,780
Holy shit.

1421
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:56,460
Yeah.

1422
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,740
There was a gun in there?

1423
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,180
Where?

1424
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,500
I got back into the freaky hall.

1425
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,510
Please don't come back to life.

1426
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:08,750
I missed an important item.

1427
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,080
Where could you place a gun?

1428
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:21,930
Oh my god.

1429
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:22,710
It's a photo.

1430
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:26,310
I thought this was it.

1431
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,490
But it's just a photo.

1432
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:41,550
No guns here.

1433
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,330
It's an upstairs?

1434
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:45,910
Then why'd it have to go here?

1435
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:51,950
Why did I have to be here?

1436
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:55,970
This was all for a fucking photo!

1437
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:01,430
Oh my god, this was all for a goddamn photo.

1438
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,910
I can't believe it.

1439
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,070
I can't...

1440
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,210
I can't...

1441
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:13,010
I can't believe I came back for a fucking Valentine's Day photo.

1442
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:14,470
I can't...

1443
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:15,350
I can't...

1444
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,490
I can't...

1445
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,550
Believe it!

1446
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:19,270
This is my anger management class.

1447
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,490
I can't fucking believe it.

1448
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:27,130
Okay, up I go.

1449
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,180
Alright, here we go.

1450
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,340
I guess the gun is here then.

1451
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:37,540
I

1452
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,380
guess the gun has to be here.

1453
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,580
Okay.

1454
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,180
There's so many rooms.

1455
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,220
How many rooms are there?

1456
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,100
What the fuck?

1457
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,480
Why did I kill this guy?

1458
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,860
Why did I kill you?

1459
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,640
I don't remember this.

1460
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,440
Oh no, did I black out and did this?

1461
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,160
It's Pyramid Head.

1462
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,160
It has to be him.

1463
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:18,960
It's him.

1464
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,980
It has to be him.

1465
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,180
I didn't do this.

1466
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,880
Unless I did black out.

1467
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,400
That can't be me.

1468
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,420
I didn't do this.

1469
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,280
That has to be Pyramid Head.

1470
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,760
Hello?

1471
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:34,460
Me?

1472
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,460
Guy I wish I...

1473
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,670
The guy...

1474
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,000
My fantasy ideal self.

1475
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,860
God, I'm so paranoid just walking through these halls.

1476
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,280
Oh, there he is!

1477
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:58,820
There's me!

1478
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,240
Hello?

1479
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,540
Hey!

1480
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,120
I'm you!

1481
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:18,140
Oh my god, look at that hunk of a body you got there.

1482
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,960
That's my true peak form right there.

1483
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,360
Hey there!

1484
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,040
Can I change my hat?

1485
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:31,120
Hey!

1486
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,820
We're just to save.

1487
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,540
You are not...

1488
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:38,720
At least he's friendly.

1489
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:39,840
Hey!

1490
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:42,480
Bro!

1491
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,300
That's me!

1492
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,560
I mean, you and I...

1493
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,760
Alone in this apartment.

1494
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,360
Nobody here to bother us.

1495
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,800
One of us has to change.

1496
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,060
Just the two of us.

1497
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,340
It's like looking in the mirror.

1498
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:09,520
Yeah!

1499
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,440
It's there like looking in the...

1500
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,760
What is he just standing there?

1501
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,820
It's not even scary.

1502
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,460
He literally is just...

1503
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:18,520
Standing there.

1504
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,800
Feels weird.

1505
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,160
He's just like there.

1506
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:25,260
Like...

1507
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,560
This is so awkward.

1508
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:27,980
Like he's just...

1509
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:28,860
Like...

1510
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,180
What?

1511
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,280
Don't come in?

1512
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:37,380
Do you wanna...

1513
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,280
Do you wanna come in here?

1514
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,720
I don't know.

1515
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:41,760
Alright.

1516
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,320
Oh, this is where the legs lady is.

1517
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:53,340
No?

1518
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,940
I don't understand.

1519
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,880
Why is he just there watching me?

1520
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,480
Like...

1521
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,620
Does he not wanna...

1522
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,520
He's on strike.

1523
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,220
Like I'm just wondering if he wanted to hang out.

1524
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:12,720
You know?

1525
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,840
Like clearly we both have something in common.

1526
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,100
Like we both have...

1527
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,360
Pyramids as heads.

1528
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,720
Just thought he would just wanna hang out, you know?

1529
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:26,780
Just...

1530
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,380
You know, relate to each other.

1531
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,220
How about we just be super relatable?

1532
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:34,160
What's this?

1533
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:38,870
What?

1534
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:43,590
What is that?

1535
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,970
I don't fucking know what I just looked at.

1536
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:51,210
That's a wall.

1537
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:57,270
Why are there scratches on the wall?

1538
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,210
I'm just like, that's a wall.

1539
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,020
Something was supposed to be there, yeah.

1540
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,080
Who knows?

1541
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,610
Okay, you can't smash the wall.

1542
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:18,430
You can?

1543
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,630
I don't think I can.

1544
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:20,930
See?

1545
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:25,570
Can't slap it.

1546
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:30,450
Guess I'll go through this deep dark hole.

1547
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:37,130
Okay, if I go through that...

1548
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:40,110
Then I have 214...

1549
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:43,030
Why is he just watching me like that?

1550
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,190
It's just weird.

1551
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,510
I just don't like it.

1552
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:49,850
I'm like, he's just staring at me.

1553
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:53,970
Like...

1554
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:56,870
It's just weird.

1555
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:59,970
Like, he's just...

1556
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:01,170
He doesn't even do anything.

1557
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,090
Like, yeah, I know, we're both handsome.

1558
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:05,050
You're literally me.

1559
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,350
We gotta keep that in the bedroom, bro.

1560
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:17,210
Due to the ongoing renovation works, tents are asked to keep...

1561
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,430
Oh, the third floor of the building.

1562
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:18,870
Okay.

1563
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:22,410
Oh.

1564
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:23,650
Oh.

1565
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:31,840
Toki, when someone matches her freak.

1566
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,920
Papa, thank you for the superchat.

1567
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,200
Thank you, thank you.

1568
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,700
I don't know, I just feel like...

1569
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,460
His entrance should be a little scarier.

1570
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,020
Instead, he just...

1571
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:49,740
He's just...

1572
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,420
I don't...

1573
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,240
Is it...

1574
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,080
I don't know.

1575
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,320
Is that...

1576
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,200
Is that just me?

1577
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,920
I feel like, you know, his entrance should be just a little scarier.

1578
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,160
Instead, he's just...

1579
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,900
He's literally just...

1580
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,420
He's just standing there watching me.

1581
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,880
But he is you, James.

1582
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:11,680
Exactly.

1583
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,180
He is you.

1584
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,940
Like, he's just the default standing man.

1585
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,480
I'm like, I don't know what you want me to do, bro.

1586
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,440
Like...

1587
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:28,750
Alright.

1588
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:32,370
Well, there's a lot of bullets here, so I assume...

1589
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:33,790
Oh, hey, there's another ammo here.

1590
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,500
James, thank you for the superchat.

1591
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,040
Thank you, thank you.

1592
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:46,380
Man, if I was a fraction of the hotness of Pyramid Head, I'd have so many more...

1593
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,660
Oh, James.

1594
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,520
Oh, no, my cop drop.

1595
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,760
My cop drop broke.

1596
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,100
Goddamn, I blame you, James.

1597
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:54,920
This is your fault.

1598
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,940
Wait, where did I drop my cop drop?

1599
01:20:59,140 --> 01:20:59,880
Oh, fuck.

1600
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,680
I don't know where it went.

1601
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,300
Oh, well.

1602
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,200
Alright.

1603
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,700
What does this do?

1604
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,540
Now what?

1605
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,780
Oh, hey.

1606
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,260
Okay, there's a door here.

1607
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,180
Um...

1608
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,560
Oh, do I shoot it?

1609
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,180
I might as well just shoot it, right?

1610
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,400
Alright.

1611
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,080
Now what?

1612
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,040
Alright, is this like Resident Evil where I have... where headshots don't matter?

1613
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,360
I need to know now.

1614
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,060
Because I have, like...

1615
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,920
You know, if I hold it, I need to know.

1616
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,200
I can...

1617
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,080
Before I waste bullets.

1618
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,840
I need to know.

1619
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,660
Okay, it's like Resident Evil.

1620
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:50,060
Okay.

1621
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:56,910
Alright, that's good to know.

1622
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:57,910
Headshots don't matter.

1623
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,020
You're right.

1624
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,260
They sort of don't have a head.

1625
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:04,680
You're right.

1626
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,100
I forgot.

1627
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,420
It's just literally legs.

1628
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:08,580
Like...

1629
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,540
You're right.

1630
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,740
How do I swap weapons?

1631
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,320
Guys, how do I swap weapons?

1632
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,240
I'm, like, stuck on my gun.

1633
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:25,870
Burrito, thank you for the superchat.

1634
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:27,130
Thank you.

1635
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:30,370
I can't... How do I swap weapons?

1636
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:30,990
Chat.

1637
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:35,270
Oh, I only shoot while aiming?

1638
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:36,710
Oh, thank God.

1639
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:36,990
Okay.

1640
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:38,830
I tested it out.

1641
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:44,600
Okay.

1642
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,680
What do I do?

1643
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,860
Where am I?

1644
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,060
Wait, what do I do now?

1645
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,110
Guys, where do I...

1646
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,580
Where do I go?

1647
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,520
Gang, thank you for the superchat.

1648
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,560
Thank you, thank you.

1649
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:11,600
Where do I...

1650
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,720
Where do I go?

1651
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,120
I'm stuck.

1652
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:19,740
212?

1653
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,080
Okay.

1654
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,960
Oh, wait, there's TVs on.

1655
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:30,160
Wait, what the fuck?

1656
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,540
Wait, when was the TV on?

1657
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,160
Oh, she's definitely dead.

1658
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,120
Where did you get here?

1659
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,300
Do it, you coward!

1660
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:50,910
Do it!

1661
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,480
Is that me?

1662
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,100
Wait, that's my pants.

1663
01:23:58,260 --> 01:23:59,540
How did you get here?

1664
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,620
Oh, hey, 212.

1665
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,700
Oh, now you're scared.

1666
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,500
You killed so many hot, sexy legs today.

1667
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:12,120
But one blanket you couldn't lift.

1668
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:17,070
That seems to be me.

1669
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:18,010
Those are my pants.

1670
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:19,070
And my shoes, see?

1671
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:20,310
We have the same shoes.

1672
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,430
Oh, that's me.

1673
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:23,950
I died?

1674
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:29,590
It has to be me.

1675
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:31,950
That's literally my pants and shoes.

1676
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:34,830
He's just missing the hat.

1677
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,630
Oh, he knows it's me.

1678
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,100
Oh, he's gone.

1679
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:51,470
Oh my god, my sexy self is gone.

1680
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:56,290
My dream ideal body.

1681
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:08,630
I swear to god, I swear to god, if I fucking see you, I swear to god I'm ready.

1682
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,790
I'm ready, you fucking seductress.

1683
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:15,030
Oh, I'm so ready.

1684
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:20,710
You goddamn sexy fool.

1685
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:26,270
Okay.

1686
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,830
Okay, she's not here.

1687
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:32,110
Okay, we're good.

1688
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:33,470
We're good.

1689
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,560
I have to be sure, guys.

1690
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,120
Okay, there's nothing outside.

1691
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:45,560
Seduce this freak.

1692
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,820
Okay, now that I'm outside, I feel less scared.

1693
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,780
Alright, now I'm inside again.

1694
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,440
Now I'm scared.

1695
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,800
Okay, that was like a quick five seconds.

1696
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:00,860
Okay, that's fine.

1697
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:04,660
That's fine.

1698
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:04,740
That's fine.

1699
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,380
Not good.

1700
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1701
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:11,760
Thank you.

1702
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:12,740
Thank you.

1703
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,500
Fun fact, it's an evil James who was replaced by Pyramid Head.

1704
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,420
Hence why Pyramid Head killed him off screen.

1705
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,720
His jacket was red.

1706
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:20,540
Thank you for the super chat.

1707
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:20,880
Thank you.

1708
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:21,600
Thank you.

1709
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:28,030
Alright.

1710
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:31,650
Oh, he's here.

1711
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:33,390
Wait, is that her?

1712
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,020
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

1713
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,320
I'm sorry.

1714
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,600
That was so funny.

1715
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,200
I'm sorry.

1716
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,000
I was just like, wait, he has two legs.

1717
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,620
He never stops.

1718
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,520
I'm just like, what is he doing there?

1719
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,760
I was like, wait a minute.

1720
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:07,980
This doesn't seem right.

1721
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,380
Something's wrong with this picture.

1722
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,880
Alright, any more?

1723
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,740
Like, he was just standing there.

1724
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:26,740
Bro was playing dress to impress.

1725
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:33,480
Literally dress to impress and I just came over here and be like, just shot her in the leg.

1726
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:39,760
Okay.

1727
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:40,300
Okay.

1728
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,440
Anything back here?

1729
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,300
No, that's just a fucking wall.

1730
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:49,800
Okay.

1731
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:52,600
Oh, hello.

1732
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:55,680
Okay.

1733
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:56,660
Hello.

1734
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:58,960
Did he even hit me?

1735
01:27:59,080 --> 01:27:59,980
I can't tell.

1736
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,000
Okay.

1737
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,620
That was pointless for that guy.

1738
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:14,870
I was just like, my wife!

1739
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,240
I shouldn't waste ammo.

1740
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,900
But it'd be funny.

1741
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:39,990
Oh, that hit me!

1742
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:42,510
Are you fucking- Okay, that's karma.

1743
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,710
That's actually karma.

1744
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,530
I didn't think that would actually hit me, guys.

1745
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:58,790
I didn't think this through.

1746
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:03,670
Oh shit, that must be a shortcut.

1747
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:06,310
Guys, I didn't think it through, guys.

1748
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:07,870
I don't know if you noticed that.

1749
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,850
I didn't think it through.

1750
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:16,030
I just thought it'd be funny.

1751
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:28,860
Hot lady?

1752
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,020
Hot lady?

1753
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,760
Oh, there it is.

1754
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:35,960
Oh, welcome home!

1755
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:43,130
Oh shit!

1756
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,370
That's right!

1757
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:52,270
Happy birthday!

1758
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:56,470
This is my birthday you shouldn't have!

1759
01:29:58,890 --> 01:29:59,630
Oh, what?

1760
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:04,810
Bro, no, no, no.

1761
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:06,170
Don't get on your knees, please.

1762
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:07,130
No, don't, don't.

1763
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:08,550
I'm a man of God.

1764
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:14,750
Guys, I know it's my birthday, guys, but please.

1765
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:18,110
I promised.

1766
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:24,690
Bro, bro, it's not even my actual birthday, bro.

1767
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:29,930
Oh, hey.

1768
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:32,170
Oh, nevermind.

1769
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:33,070
I was like working late.

1770
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,060
Oh, nice, more ammo.

1771
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:42,380
To be fair, I would like more HP instead of ammo, though.

1772
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,060
Not gonna lie.

1773
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:49,540
Okay.

1774
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,860
Heads to 205.

1775
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,900
Oh, destroy the balloons if I want.

1776
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,380
Nobody deserves happiness.

1777
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:00,680
Oh.

1778
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:03,140
Okay, I can't.

1779
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:06,500
Guys, you liar.

1780
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:08,900
I was going to.

1781
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:13,600
He just wants to help his bro out.

1782
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,640
Wait, what?

1783
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,980
What's the point of going outside?

1784
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:27,250
I'm not gonna waste my bullets.

1785
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,950
Like, does it give me anything?

1786
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:35,730
Guys, I'm not gonna waste my bullets, guys.

1787
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:39,510
Doki is for fresh air.

1788
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:46,530
I'm bragging rights.

1789
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:48,110
Which way do I go again?

1790
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:50,010
Okay, straight.

1791
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:56,690
Bro, I know we're like best friends, bro, but like, bro.

1792
01:31:58,970 --> 01:31:59,970
I'm sorry.

1793
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:01,850
Just don't swing that way, bro.

1794
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:04,410
That's why you got the legs, lady.

1795
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:05,090
Was it?

1796
01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:15,330
Oh, okay.

1797
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:17,650
Bro.

1798
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,840
Just wanted to help a bro out, bro.

1799
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:36,860
You must think I'm cruel, but this prison is of your own making.

1800
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:38,380
The choice was yours.

1801
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:41,880
I've watched you make it over and over and over again.

1802
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,160
This time's not gonna be any different.

1803
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,500
And I'll be here.

1804
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:46,460
Watching.

1805
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:47,460
Oh, bro.

1806
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,200
Bro, I'm sorry for rejecting you.

1807
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,020
Wait.

1808
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:58,880
The fuck?

1809
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:03,980
What is this?

1810
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,000
Is this my little peephole?

1811
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,980
Whose hole is this?

1812
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:16,560
Who lived here?

1813
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:20,300
Who lived here?

1814
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,080
Oh.

1815
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,400
Okay.

1816
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:30,800
Okay.

1817
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:36,980
Oh, he was watching something.

1818
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,180
Somebody in here.

1819
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:42,260
How do I get there?

1820
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:48,200
Is 205 open now?

1821
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,020
Chat?

1822
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,560
I assume 205 has opened up, right?

1823
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:01,010
I can push it?

1824
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:05,350
Oh, I can!

1825
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:09,590
Oh, there we go.

1826
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:16,820
What?

1827
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:18,720
What happened?

1828
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,460
Oh, that fucking thing!

1829
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,080
Okay.

1830
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,260
Nice poem.

1831
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,980
Oh, no.

1832
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,380
Oh, no.

1833
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,500
Oh, fuck.

1834
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:00,060
Okay.

1835
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:01,360
Seven.

1836
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:06,140
Okay, let me read this poem again.

1837
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,440
Okay, so...

1838
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,980
The second number is seven.

1839
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,040
The second number is seven.

1840
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,980
There's a seven here.

1841
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:24,820
What's the next number?

1842
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,940
What the fuck?

1843
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,540
I only found one number!

1844
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,180
Eleven.

1845
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:39,200
Okay.

1846
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,220
Okay, that's the last number.

1847
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:47,700
Seven and eleven is the last number.

1848
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,080
So...

1849
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:54,300
Okay, it's blank, seven, blank, blank, eleven.

1850
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:56,320
Cause that's the river.

1851
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,250
Should be...

1852
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:05,770
Thirteen.

1853
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,010
Thirteen, seven.

1854
01:36:08,730 --> 01:36:10,210
Thirteen, seven.

1855
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:12,110
We need one more.

1856
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:15,070
Thirteen, seven.

1857
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:16,210
Has he found home?

1858
01:36:16,330 --> 01:36:17,410
Oh, please pray tell.

1859
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:20,850
What's the last number?

1860
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,310
Thirteen, seven.

1861
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:26,290
And then, blank, eleven.

1862
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:32,940
Where's the last number?

1863
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,340
Where is it?

1864
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,740
I'm looking everywhere!

1865
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,300
Is it only three numbers?

1866
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,540
Nothing is highlighted.

1867
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,500
Oh, I got all of them?

1868
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:06,860
Okay, thirteen, seven, eleven.

1869
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:07,860
Okay.

1870
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:10,940
Thirteen...

1871
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,320
Seven...

1872
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:15,760
What?

1873
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,080
Thirteen...

1874
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,160
Oh.

1875
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:26,980
Seven...

1876
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:28,780
Eleven.

1877
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,000
What?

1878
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,760
That's not how you do it?

1879
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,200
Did I mess it up?

1880
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,000
Thirteen...

1881
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:43,460
Seven...

1882
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,160
Eleven.

1883
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:46,740
Oh, there we go.

1884
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:47,400
I messed it up.

1885
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,820
Yeah, I messed it up.

1886
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,620
Oh, my jaw and head.

1887
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:55,300
If only I could see what that says.

1888
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:56,180
Whoa.

1889
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,680
Guess we'll never know.

1890
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:03,600
Alright.

1891
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,480
Nice.

1892
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,420
That was an easy fucking puzzle.

1893
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:12,140
After I go out of here...

1894
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:15,140
I guess I can go out...

1895
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:17,520
I go to 205?

1896
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,240
And check that out.

1897
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,580
And then...

1898
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,800
I'm already sort of low-key lost, not gonna lie.

1899
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:27,040
Like, I don't remember where I've been and where I haven't been.

1900
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,640
Like, where am I at this point?

1901
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,580
I don't know.

1902
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:45,680
Oh.

1903
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:47,300
Alright.

1904
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,320
It's my birthday again?

1905
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:52,200
Hello?

1906
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,460
Oh, there's a little chair.

1907
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:01,160
I don't like the implication of that chair.

1908
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,560
Is that...

1909
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:07,160
Oh, I don't like the...

1910
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:13,020
Cause it could be a good chair or a bad chair.

1911
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:15,940
Is it my birthday chair or is it like...

1912
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,200
My wife's birthday chair?

1913
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:22,240
Oh, shit!

1914
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,020
Sorry, I got distracted.

1915
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:24,340
Oops.

1916
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,060
I...

1917
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:29,020
Okay, I got...

1918
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:37,420
And you know you know.

1919
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:49,420
Alright.

1920
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,040
I'm not sure what that even means.

1921
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:53,340
Okay, that's good for you.

1922
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,820
That's good for you.

1923
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:57,400
You don't want to know.

1924
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,520
I missed an item?

1925
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:06,560
I missed a fucking bug.

1926
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,080
That's what I missed.

1927
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,120
Oh, I did miss an item.

1928
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:11,440
Okay.

1929
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:15,700
Alright.

1930
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:17,800
Oh, wait.

1931
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:18,440
There's stuff here.

1932
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,660
Might as well hydrate real fast.

1933
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,520
I just don't like being like low HP.

1934
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,840
It freaks me out a little.

1935
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:30,430
How do I go this way?

1936
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:31,650
Oh, I can.

1937
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:35,410
Okay.

1938
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:37,390
Oh, it's a shortcut.

1939
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:38,850
Yeah.

1940
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:40,310
Should I save?

1941
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:42,530
I feel like I should save.

1942
01:40:44,150 --> 01:40:45,570
I'm gonna go save.

1943
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:47,070
Just in case.

1944
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,240
Hey, guys.

1945
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,340
Happy.

1946
01:40:58,460 --> 01:40:59,640
What the fuck?!

1947
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,640
How are you still alive?!

1948
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,140
Oh, my God.

1949
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:10,100
Get out of here.

1950
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:11,980
I'm trying to save my game.

1951
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,460
Alright.

1952
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:15,680
I'm just gonna...

1953
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:17,780
go ahead to save my game.

1954
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,340
Alright, that didn't scare me that much because I knew that I had a feeling one of them came back to life.

1955
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,480
Because it started being like danger, danger, stranger, danger.

1956
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,760
And I was like, oh, okay.

1957
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,500
So, like, I had a feeling.

1958
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:35,620
I had a feeling.

1959
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,980
I had a feeling things weren't gonna go so well.

1960
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:42,540
Alright.

1961
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:43,500
Nice.

1962
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:47,780
Okay, I'm gonna go put this in the hole.

1963
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,020
Put this in the hole.

1964
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,420
I can move it around later.

1965
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:55,580
I just want it to be there.

1966
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:01,570
Yeah, because I was like, stop.

1967
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:06,210
I'm just like, stop.

1968
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:07,190
God.

1969
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:09,790
Nobody wants you here.

1970
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:12,470
This is why nobody invited you to the welcome home party.

1971
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:18,770
Alright, up I go.

1972
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:22,960
I'm pretty sure I am like...

1973
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:26,350
I could be doing this a lot faster.

1974
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:30,450
But there's a lot of things I could be doing.

1975
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:38,710
Definitely feel like I could be doing...

1976
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:43,290
I would have been done with this level a long time ago.

1977
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:48,170
Oh.

1978
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,030
Oh.

1979
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:56,550
He's supposed... he's not supposed to be there.

1980
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:00,950
Hello?

1981
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:03,010
Oh, there he is.

1982
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:07,970
Okay.

1983
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:10,110
I mean...

1984
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:12,210
I mean, he's just gonna...

1985
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:17,090
He's just gonna run like that, I guess.

1986
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:20,630
Alright, there we go.

1987
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:23,930
I was like, just vomit!

1988
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:29,830
He's just walking there.

1989
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:30,310
Please.

1990
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:32,690
He's just...

1991
01:43:32,690 --> 01:43:35,410
He's just trying to hang out.

1992
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:37,730
Okay.

1993
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:38,790
Nice.

1994
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:39,970
Oh my God, it disintegrated.

1995
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:42,470
That's some fucking old-ass block right there.

1996
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:43,990
Alright.

1997
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:46,070
Oh, thank God.

1998
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:47,150
Thank God there's a safe.

1999
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:49,770
Thank God there's a safe.

2000
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:56,370
Where do I go?

2001
01:43:56,590 --> 01:43:57,830
Can I even go downstairs?

2002
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:01,550
Wait, which way?

2003
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:04,370
I guess I go up?

2004
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:06,910
I guess so.

2005
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,050
Oh yeah, there's a door here.

2006
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:15,330
Oh my God, how big are the apartments?

2007
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:18,030
How big are these...

2008
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:21,790
How many more rooms must I go into?!

2009
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:25,870
Oh my God.

2010
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:31,770
There's like four fucking... I need like...

2011
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:34,750
Four to five more fucking medallions!

2012
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:34,990
Medallions!

2013
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,660
Oh my God.

2014
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,040
I feel like I'm gonna be here forever.

2015
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,280
Oh, there you are.

2016
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:00,760
Ah,

2017
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:06,460
fuck!

2018
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,100
Oh shit!

2019
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:08,040
That's fucking right!

2020
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:08,480
Whoa!

2021
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:10,580
Whoa!

2022
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,120
That's... I'm done.

2023
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,260
I was done.

2024
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,420
I was over here with that shit.

2025
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,940
Oh shit, sorry.

2026
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,120
I was too...

2027
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:32,420
No more playing around.

2028
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:34,680
No more...

2029
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:37,760
No more playing around here.

2030
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:41,560
You dodge, I bring the gun out.

2031
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:44,940
Dodge this.

2032
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:51,300
That fight wasn't fair, Toki.

2033
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:56,380
Yeah, and the 3v1 was not...

2034
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:59,960
Okay, and what about that 3v1 that they try to do?

2035
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:00,760
Huh?

2036
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,980
Like, what about that?

2037
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:07,780
If you're trying to say that wasn't fair.

2038
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,320
They literally tried to 3v1 me.

2039
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:16,500
Okay.

2040
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:19,600
They did have guns, though.

2041
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:24,430
Okay, nice.

2042
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:27,810
I got back some of the ammo I used on these girls.

2043
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:32,050
They are just legs.

2044
01:46:34,290 --> 01:46:36,690
Yeah, but they wanna kick me.

2045
01:46:37,450 --> 01:46:38,750
What did I do to them?

2046
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:42,090
I literally did nothing.

2047
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:46,490
Is there anything back there, just in case?

2048
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:53,160
Just items?

2049
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:53,800
Oh, nice.

2050
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:54,720
Okay.

2051
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,040
I had a feeling there was something over here.

2052
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:01,980
I know there's...

2053
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:03,760
I know there's something here.

2054
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:04,780
I know I can feel it.

2055
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:08,720
It all looks normal, but it's not.

2056
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:11,500
It's underneath, pulsing, trying to get out.

2057
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:13,940
Is it trying to get out?

2058
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:15,780
Is it trying to get out, or should I get in?

2059
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,520
I have to uncover it.

2060
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,980
Rip it to the surface.

2061
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:22,820
I was innocent.

2062
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,140
They attacked me first.

2063
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,320
They ran after me!

2064
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,400
This was all self-defense.

2065
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:38,790
This was literally self-defense.

2066
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:45,420
Oh, what?

2067
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,840
Oh, that was an accident.

2068
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:48,740
No!

2069
01:47:48,740 --> 01:47:51,740
What the...

2070
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:58,150
Oh my god, this is...

2071
01:47:58,150 --> 01:47:59,950
Oh my god.

2072
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:02,990
Oh my god!

2073
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:08,060
Oh my god.

2074
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:09,500
I'm so fucked up.

2075
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,860
I'm so fucked up right now.

2076
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,340
I'm so fucked up.

2077
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:16,160
No, wrong legs.

2078
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,900
Wrong legs.

2079
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,980
Holy shit.

2080
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:28,660
Oh my god, I used so many... I used so many resources there.

2081
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:31,360
I didn't think they would fucking...

2082
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,780
Oh my god, I didn't think they would come after me like that.

2083
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,900
They saw what I did to the other girls.

2084
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,880
They saw what I did.

2085
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,520
Oh my god, I need to use two?

2086
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:46,080
How fucked up did they made me?

2087
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:53,220
Oh, these women...

2088
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:56,500
They ain't playing no more, guys.

2089
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:58,840
They are not playing no more.

2090
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:01,960
Oh no.

2091
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,880
Oh no, they're not playing, guys.

2092
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:10,180
They're not playing no more, chat.

2093
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:12,540
They know what they want.

2094
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:22,070
Oh, okay.

2095
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:24,290
They have to be on the other side.

2096
01:49:25,450 --> 01:49:26,150
They're mad.

2097
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:28,330
They're so fucking mad.

2098
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:34,580
There's a note.

2099
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:36,320
I was wrong.

2100
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,640
Wrong, wrong.

2101
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:38,380
No, I wasn't.

2102
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:39,460
But I was entirely right.

2103
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,060
I need to peel off more something.

2104
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:42,780
Something more blood clothes.

2105
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:48,150
It has to be here.

2106
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:52,960
I fucking knew it.

2107
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:54,100
I knew it.

2108
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,780
Oh, I fucking...

2109
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:04,050
I fucking knew it.

2110
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:05,770
I knew you were hiding something.

2111
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:06,790
I knew you were hiding.

2112
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:07,710
I knew it.

2113
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:08,850
I knew it.

2114
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:10,250
Hellfire.

2115
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:18,070
Be gone, woman.

2116
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:25,290
Alright, let's see.

2117
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:27,590
How do I get there?

2118
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:34,270
Was it just Lou here?

2119
01:50:36,210 --> 01:50:37,510
Is that it?

2120
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:39,950
Is there nothing else?

2121
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:45,060
There's a crawl space.

2122
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:45,560
This?

2123
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,420
I don't even get past that.

2124
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:54,530
There's a bed?

2125
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,220
What the fuck?

2126
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:12,920
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

2127
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,460
I'm so confused.

2128
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:24,840
Like, where am I?

2129
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:28,020
Where do I go?

2130
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,620
I thought...

2131
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:31,780
Is this a dead end?

2132
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,860
What's the point of going here?

2133
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,080
What the fuck was the point?

2134
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,650
Crawl?

2135
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:58,710
Just in case I...

2136
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:00,130
I can't.

2137
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:05,730
Guys, I know you're fucking with me.

2138
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:07,190
There's no way I can crawl.

2139
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:11,210
There's no crawl button.

2140
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:11,650
What?

2141
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:13,990
Go back?

2142
01:52:16,190 --> 01:52:17,610
There's no way.

2143
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,240
Oh my god, I have to press E.

2144
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:30,360
I had to press E.

2145
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:31,720
Oh my god, LaCroix.

2146
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:34,540
Let me grab...

2147
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:37,400
Let me grab me some fucking LaCroix real quick.

2148
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,820
Oh my god, I had to press E.

2149
01:52:49,210 --> 01:52:50,970
Alright, I have this now.

2150
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:00,710
I guess I throw my canned juice.

2151
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:04,990
Goodbye, juice.

2152
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:10,840
Yay!

2153
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,580
Oh, I fixed it!

2154
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:13,680
My LaCroix!

2155
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:16,660
No!

2156
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:23,460
Why did she do that?

2157
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:24,060
Is she stupid?

2158
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:27,240
Alright, how do I go back?

2159
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:28,880
How do I get back down?

2160
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:29,320
Okay.

2161
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:33,900
Oh, I don't like that sound.

2162
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:37,500
Oh, he's here.

2163
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:47,030
Where do I go?

2164
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:49,550
Is there anything over here?

2165
01:53:49,710 --> 01:53:50,750
I never went this way.

2166
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:53,170
Hello?

2167
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:56,370
Any freaks?

2168
01:53:57,150 --> 01:53:58,590
Any freaks?

2169
01:53:59,790 --> 01:54:00,630
No freaks?

2170
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:02,630
Alright.

2171
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:05,850
No freaks.

2172
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,470
No freaks ready.

2173
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:14,110
Anybody wanna freak out?

2174
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:18,530
Any hot single freaks in the area?

2175
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:26,790
Oh my god, my heart, man.

2176
01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:28,170
My fucking heart.

2177
01:54:28,530 --> 01:54:29,330
Like...

2178
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:31,270
God damn it.

2179
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:34,590
Okay.

2180
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:35,610
Yes.

2181
01:54:36,090 --> 01:54:36,950
Is there a shortcut here?

2182
01:54:41,070 --> 01:54:42,570
Oh, nice ammo.

2183
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,590
What was this?

2184
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,190
Where am I?

2185
01:55:01,030 --> 01:55:02,130
Oh, okay.

2186
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:02,770
That's a shortcut.

2187
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:03,250
Okay.

2188
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:05,390
Okay, I was like...

2189
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:07,610
Where the fuck am I?

2190
01:55:07,710 --> 01:55:08,990
I'm so confused.

2191
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:13,290
Where's the medallion?

2192
01:55:16,670 --> 01:55:18,030
Wait, where the...

2193
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:21,800
Where the fuck is the coin?

2194
01:55:29,150 --> 01:55:30,650
Where is it?

2195
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:35,740
Where could it fall?

2196
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:41,160
Who stole it?

2197
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:46,380
Who the fuck stole it?

2198
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:52,880
Who the fuck stole the coin?

2199
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:55,980
Oh my god.

2200
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:57,140
Where is it?

2201
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:59,200
Oh my god, it's all the way there.

2202
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,640
It's actually so far.

2203
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:05,020
Why was the coin so fucking far?

2204
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:06,960
Holy shit.

2205
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:11,540
Oh my god.

2206
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:15,060
Why the fuck was the coin so far?

2207
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:20,540
Alright, back into the coin hole you go.

2208
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:25,100
I know it's not the right order, guys.

2209
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:28,780
But like, there's so many coins and I just want to put it there.

2210
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,220
I...

2211
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,400
I just want...

2212
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,520
I just...

2213
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,680
I just want to put it there for now.

2214
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:40,470
Alright.

2215
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:42,830
Where am I supposed to go now?

2216
01:56:43,690 --> 01:56:45,850
I guess I could look into the rooms?

2217
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:47,610
On the very...

2218
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:49,470
I need three more.

2219
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:54,680
Oh, I only need one more?

2220
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:56,480
Where is the last coin?

2221
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:57,820
Chat?

2222
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:58,980
Where is it?

2223
01:57:02,990 --> 01:57:04,410
Is that the bottom floor?

2224
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:15,840
It's in the...

2225
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,300
There's a fucking pool?

2226
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:20,120
What the fuck?

2227
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:22,320
I guess it's the Rosewater Park, right?

2228
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:24,240
It has to be the pool.

2229
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:29,820
Yeah, it should be back here.

2230
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:35,670
Okay, here we go.

2231
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:39,630
Here we fucking go.

2232
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:42,030
Alright.

2233
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:44,710
Hello?

2234
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:46,950
Hello?

2235
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:53,450
Any pool boys or pool ladies in my area too?

2236
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:58,310
Huh?

2237
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:00,350
Who's coughing?

2238
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,020
The fuck?

2239
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:16,760
Hello?

2240
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:21,660
Hello?

2241
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:24,800
Who's you?

2242
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:36,000
Did you see a child?

2243
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,100
I have something to...

2244
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:41,700
I never forgot about her.

2245
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:47,120
Like, why are you here?

2246
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:47,460
Why are you here?

2247
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,080
Who are your monsters, Eddie?

2248
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:54,940
Unless Eddie is like my subconscious.

2249
01:58:59,290 --> 01:59:01,330
You're not from here?

2250
01:59:02,570 --> 01:59:03,410
How'd you get here?

2251
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:04,470
How'd you get to Silent Hill?

2252
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:06,390
Me?

2253
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:22,370
What?

2254
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:29,990
Look, I'm just trying to be friendly.

2255
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:32,390
He won't think I'm weird if I wear the mask.

2256
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:34,250
He'll think I'm like not one of the monsters.

2257
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:41,810
Yeah!

2258
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:44,670
No, I want an ally.

2259
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:46,410
What do you mean no?

2260
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:49,510
James, we need an ally!

2261
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:55,670
You can literally find people to get...

2262
01:59:55,670 --> 01:59:57,310
Yeah, it makes me more approachable, chat.

2263
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:59,450
What do you mean?

2264
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:06,550
James, we could find some...

2265
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:08,010
Wait, I have a collar on.

2266
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:11,550
Oh, it's that type of mask.

2267
02:00:11,910 --> 02:00:13,870
And that closed the door on it.

2268
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:16,670
Look how it closed the door.

2269
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:19,190
I was like, alright, enough of that.

2270
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:27,410
No more looking at that for you.

2271
02:00:29,970 --> 02:00:32,330
I just didn't even want to look at it.

2272
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:36,090
I can't believe I closed the fucking door.

2273
02:00:39,150 --> 02:00:41,030
I'm just like, well, I'm done.

2274
02:00:41,250 --> 02:00:43,250
My day here is over.

2275
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:46,990
I did my job.

2276
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:51,150
Alright, out of the window we go.

2277
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:52,590
Yippee!

2278
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:53,910
Oh, hey, there's a pula.

2279
02:00:54,510 --> 02:00:55,050
Oh, shit.

2280
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:56,090
Okay,

2281
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:02,040
let me get rid of this guy first.

2282
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,220
Let me shoot him in the ass.

2283
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,500
We didn't see that.

2284
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:15,720
We didn't see that guy.

2285
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,580
Okay, okay.

2286
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:23,160
There's the pula.

2287
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:31,720
Look, I just wanted to shoot him in the butt.

2288
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,040
Is he gonna run at me?

2289
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:36,360
No!

2290
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:37,660
What?

2291
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:38,720
You double...

2292
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:41,720
You triple tap, you whore.

2293
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:42,700
You...

2294
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:43,600
I should've just shot you.

2295
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:45,740
That's it, I'm not dealing with this anymore.

2296
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:48,420
Oh!

2297
02:01:59,150 --> 02:01:59,450
Okay.

2298
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:02,330
Alright.

2299
02:02:05,630 --> 02:02:06,830
Let's see.

2300
02:02:07,110 --> 02:02:08,650
I'll kill these guys first.

2301
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:13,230
Oh, what?

2302
02:02:19,010 --> 02:02:19,610
Okay.

2303
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:21,530
I didn't realize he gets up, guys.

2304
02:02:23,490 --> 02:02:25,250
That was my mistake.

2305
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:28,410
But I will not make mistakes no more.

2306
02:02:28,530 --> 02:02:33,130
I will not make the same mistake no more!

2307
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:34,870
Alright, there should be the medallion.

2308
02:02:35,490 --> 02:02:35,950
Yay!

2309
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:39,290
We did it.

2310
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:44,190
Alright.

2311
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:46,290
Apparently he hugs.

2312
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:48,470
Now we know.

2313
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:50,950
How do I get out of here?

2314
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:56,910
Okay, not this way.

2315
02:02:57,510 --> 02:02:58,290
What's this say?

2316
02:02:59,190 --> 02:03:00,790
This gate is open from...

2317
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:02,170
Guys, does anyone know what time it is?

2318
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:09,030
Alright.

2319
02:03:09,870 --> 02:03:12,050
Oh, I wasted so much.

2320
02:03:12,430 --> 02:03:14,090
I wasted so much for that though.

2321
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:16,910
Okay.

2322
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:18,590
Just wanna make sure I got everything.

2323
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:25,040
Oh my god.

2324
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:26,800
Okay, here we go.

2325
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:31,720
Oh, thank god this is back here.

2326
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:34,100
Oh, thank god it loop-de-looped.

2327
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:37,220
Oh, thank god it loop-de-looped.

2328
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:39,900
Okay.

2329
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:46,160
Soon...

2330
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:50,780
First sits the maiden underneath the tree.

2331
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:55,820
The wind from behind the maiden doth blow.

2332
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:58,900
So sleek in the eyes.

2333
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,520
Okay, then it's here.

2334
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:03,720
Wait, where the fuck does the snake go?

2335
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:08,620
What?

2336
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,500
That's a snake.

2337
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:19,500
Oh!

2338
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:27,320
Sorry, I didn't realize you could flip the coin.

2339
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:28,060
Alright.

2340
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:31,280
The man doth approach his blade.

2341
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:35,720
Now revealed, his face disappears behind.

2342
02:04:36,490 --> 02:04:39,500
Away from the man doth the maiden flee.

2343
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:43,180
Towards the flower, away from the tree.

2344
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:51,300
Oh, okay.

2345
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,360
Here.

2346
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:54,320
Here.

2347
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:56,580
Here.

2348
02:04:57,860 --> 02:04:58,640
That not it?

2349
02:04:59,000 --> 02:04:59,360
Here?

2350
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:00,820
Here.

2351
02:05:00,980 --> 02:05:01,700
Oh, no, no, no.

2352
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:04,440
Running towards the flower!

2353
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:06,660
The fuck?

2354
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:07,180
Okay.

2355
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:15,520
Yeah.

2356
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:20,480
It's away from the tree.

2357
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,960
His face disappears.

2358
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:37,440
She's not underneath the tree anymore.

2359
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,960
Away from the tree.

2360
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:43,200
The fuck?

2361
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:45,660
She's not dead!

2362
02:05:46,180 --> 02:05:47,200
It's not a snake!

2363
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:51,840
Where else would it be?

2364
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:57,540
Do we put it here?

2365
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,100
I don't understand.

2366
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:08,220
That's the sword!

2367
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:09,820
That's the sword!

2368
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,320
That's the sword!

2369
02:06:25,450 --> 02:06:26,470
Oh my god, please.

2370
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:32,290
Where

2371
02:06:40,570 --> 02:06:41,670
could it be?

2372
02:06:42,070 --> 02:06:43,470
Where could it be?

2373
02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:47,150
I literally have every combination possible!

2374
02:06:48,350 --> 02:06:49,310
Think hard.

2375
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:51,630
The man doth approach his blade.

2376
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:52,450
The blade now revealed.

2377
02:06:53,150 --> 02:06:56,270
His face disappears behind the shining steel.

2378
02:06:58,770 --> 02:07:01,910
Away from the man doth the maiden flee.

2379
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:03,630
Towards the...

2380
02:07:05,450 --> 02:07:08,010
I swear to god I'm heading towards it.

2381
02:07:09,070 --> 02:07:10,110
Like, she's running!

2382
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:21,360
That's the sword!

2383
02:07:25,390 --> 02:07:27,230
How stupid am I?

2384
02:07:35,870 --> 02:07:36,710
How stupid am I?

2385
02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:38,010
Like, she's not dead!

2386
02:07:38,430 --> 02:07:40,410
Her face is right there!

2387
02:07:54,490 --> 02:07:54,910
What?

2388
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:12,860
Oh my god, what?

2389
02:08:14,300 --> 02:08:15,740
I don't understand.

2390
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:18,200
I...

2391
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,940
I don't...

2392
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:23,200
Okay.

2393
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:25,880
Where once a venomous glee.

2394
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:28,460
Where once was a maiden, but a stone.

2395
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:29,900
And over her grave.

2396
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:31,760
There we go.

2397
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:32,060
Okay.

2398
02:08:32,260 --> 02:08:35,280
The beast who its teeth in her flesh doth bore.

2399
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:37,640
He who has felled, she who is no more.

2400
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:39,320
Now on to you fall.

2401
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:47,460
What?

2402
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:56,160
The beast who its teeth in her flesh doth bore.

2403
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:58,900
He who has felled, she who is no more.

2404
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:19,360
Oh, okay!

2405
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:20,220
I didn't realize.

2406
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:20,660
Okay.

2407
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:21,100
Okay.

2408
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,220
Flesh doth bore.

2409
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:26,460
He who has felled, she who is no more.

2410
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:29,360
Now on to you falls a grievous chore.

2411
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:32,080
Who carries...

2412
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:33,720
Well, obviously the snake, right?

2413
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:35,980
Yeah.

2414
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:37,980
That is...

2415
02:09:37,980 --> 02:09:38,660
Okay, I did it.

2416
02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:40,280
It was the snake.

2417
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:45,820
Oh my god.

2418
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:46,420
I...

2419
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:48,300
I didn't understand the second one.

2420
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:49,520
The second one fucked me up.

2421
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:50,460
I still don't understand.

2422
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:51,600
I...

2423
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:55,020
I still don't understand the second one.

2424
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:56,460
Okay.

2425
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:03,800
I have to go to 200, so I have to go up.

2426
02:10:07,250 --> 02:10:09,710
I didn't understand the second one, chat.

2427
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:12,570
I didn't understand.

2428
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:25,560
Is this way?

2429
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:26,860
Yeah.

2430
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:31,460
I'm scared.

2431
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,060
I'm scared.

2432
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:37,440
Oh...

2433
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:39,340
Oh...

2434
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:40,200
Oh...

2435
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:41,420
201.

2436
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:43,060
What do I do in 201?

2437
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:49,600
Hello?

2438
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:53,220
Why is this so nice?

2439
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:56,640
Oh, thank god.

2440
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:57,240
There is heals.

2441
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:00,060
Why is this a nicer area?

2442
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:03,560
Oh, nevermind.

2443
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:08,820
Nevermind.

2444
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:24,180
Oh

2445
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:33,340
my god.

2446
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:33,920
It's him.

2447
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:34,980
It's me.

2448
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:41,700
They didn't remove the seed.

2449
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:42,380
No!

2450
02:11:49,830 --> 02:11:52,930
This is what happens when my desires...

2451
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:54,570
James, no.

2452
02:11:54,690 --> 02:11:55,390
Don't watch this.

2453
02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:56,110
James, no.

2454
02:11:56,650 --> 02:11:57,950
James, no.

2455
02:12:00,690 --> 02:12:03,390
Just because you think you can't doesn't mean you should.

2456
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:18,980
What the fuck?

2457
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:20,840
He's just like, did you like what you see?

2458
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:37,850
Round two.

2459
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:51,510
What the fuck?

2460
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:52,680
He has a fucking...

2461
02:12:53,770 --> 02:12:54,390
Road!

2462
02:12:54,630 --> 02:12:55,250
My bullets!

2463
02:12:57,330 --> 02:12:57,950
James!

2464
02:12:58,290 --> 02:12:59,250
My bullets!

2465
02:12:59,650 --> 02:13:03,670
Do you know how hard it was to get those bullets?

2466
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:12,010
Minus three bullets.

2467
02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:31,470
No more watching privileges.

2468
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:33,110
Sorry.

2469
02:13:33,370 --> 02:13:34,990
Sorry for ruining the moment.

2470
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:54,400
James, you fucked up.

2471
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:55,820
He took away...

2472
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:58,720
He took away the privilege, James.

2473
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:05,340
He took it away.

2474
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:11,620
Oh,

2475
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:16,480
shit.

2476
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:18,760
This one has an ass.

2477
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:21,360
Alright.

2478
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:23,040
Let's see this way.

2479
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,020
Why is it kicked up?

2480
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:29,200
You know why, James.

2481
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:31,040
You know why.

2482
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:36,580
Oh, I have to go to the other side?

2483
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:54,310
Alright, now I'm here.

2484
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:01,840
Oh, my God.

2485
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:02,180
Okay.

2486
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:02,980
Okay.

2487
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:07,740
I lost my three bullets because James couldn't share.

2488
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:12,660
James didn't want to share no more.

2489
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:20,460
Where the fuck?

2490
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:23,100
I don't even have a map for this, James.

2491
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:26,120
We're in uncharted territory now.

2492
02:15:28,180 --> 02:15:30,180
Oh, I don't even have a map.

2493
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:33,100
James, where the fuck do I go, James?

2494
02:15:40,940 --> 02:15:42,000
Oh, there's the map.

2495
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:42,720
Oh, thank God.

2496
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:45,860
Oh, this is extra rusty.

2497
02:15:51,220 --> 02:15:51,700
Right.

2498
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:55,580
Which one is the map?

2499
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:57,480
Which one is the save point room?

2500
02:15:58,240 --> 02:15:59,420
Let's find out.

2501
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:01,080
Oh, not there.

2502
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:02,620
Hello.

2503
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:04,600
Oh.

2504
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:07,040
Oh, that's a longer range.

2505
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:09,380
Hello.

2506
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:13,340
Oh, he has...

2507
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:15,220
What?!

2508
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:21,000
Okay, I don't like this one.

2509
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:23,540
Alright.

2510
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:23,780
Alright.

2511
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:25,020
Now I know.

2512
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:26,300
The spiky one.

2513
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:28,540
Are you serious?!

2514
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:32,200
Everything can be wrong with him!

2515
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:36,180
Oh my God.

2516
02:16:38,060 --> 02:16:41,400
There's so many that actually use bullets for these guys.

2517
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:46,760
James, this is why you don't waste bullets on Pyramid Head.

2518
02:16:49,320 --> 02:16:52,380
Okay, the one with spikes does all that.

2519
02:16:55,020 --> 02:16:55,840
Break wall?

2520
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:56,340
Which wall?

2521
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:56,860
This one?

2522
02:16:57,760 --> 02:16:58,780
Oh, it is.

2523
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:03,180
Where?

2524
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:04,880
Where do I heal up?

2525
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:10,620
Guys, the thing is...

2526
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:13,820
There is no other way to heal up right now.

2527
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:14,980
I'm stuck here.

2528
02:17:24,930 --> 02:17:25,490
Thanks.

2529
02:17:27,570 --> 02:17:28,570
Ma'am?

2530
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:35,180
Oh my God, please.

2531
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:36,120
Ma'am?

2532
02:17:39,050 --> 02:17:39,850
Where are you?

2533
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:42,570
Ma'am?

2534
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:46,850
I literally saw you walk!

2535
02:17:51,510 --> 02:17:54,070
You're not fooling anybody!

2536
02:17:54,350 --> 02:17:55,470
You were walking!

2537
02:17:58,530 --> 02:18:00,010
Oh, there he is.

2538
02:18:00,050 --> 02:18:00,570
I see her.

2539
02:18:01,890 --> 02:18:05,210
Oh, I see multiple hers.

2540
02:18:07,710 --> 02:18:08,310
Alright.

2541
02:18:10,970 --> 02:18:12,650
Are these explodey guys?

2542
02:18:12,770 --> 02:18:13,550
Yeah, they are.

2543
02:18:20,580 --> 02:18:21,700
I am...

2544
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:24,620
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2545
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,120
I'm sorry.

2546
02:18:26,300 --> 02:18:27,340
I'm sorry.

2547
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:32,340
It wasn't you.

2548
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:33,560
You weren't the main target.

2549
02:18:41,550 --> 02:18:42,250
No!

2550
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:48,640
My bullets!

2551
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:53,440
God damn it.

2552
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:54,060
Oh, thank God.

2553
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:54,940
I'm not punished.

2554
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,300
I'm not punished at all.

2555
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:00,700
Oh, thank God.

2556
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:05,600
Oh, thank God I didn't get punished for my actions.

2557
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:16,220
Oh my God, where the fuck is the... Where the fuck is the save point?

2558
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:31,240
There's a moth area?

2559
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:35,160
I should be coming back here.

2560
02:19:36,580 --> 02:19:38,340
Yeah, I am on door for moth.

2561
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:39,660
Where

2562
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:52,760
the fuck is the save point in this God forsaken world?

2563
02:19:58,850 --> 02:20:00,130
Oh, thank God.

2564
02:20:00,390 --> 02:20:02,390
He asked and they shall give.

2565
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:03,830
Oh, thank God.

2566
02:20:03,990 --> 02:20:05,870
Thank God there's a save point.

2567
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:06,970
Thank fucking God.

2568
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:08,430
I thought I'd be trapped here forever.

2569
02:20:08,930 --> 02:20:10,230
Oh my God.

2570
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:18,320
East, thank you for the super chat.

2571
02:20:18,460 --> 02:20:18,900
Thank you.

2572
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:19,400
Thank you.

2573
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:22,300
As a fellow James, we don't like to share.

2574
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:24,860
Henry fears Scott.

2575
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:26,700
He'll run from him and hide.

2576
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:29,380
He's fled to the west on the other side.

2577
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:32,040
But here comes Mildred with unknown intent.

2578
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:35,980
Scott lies face down, blind to her descent.

2579
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:40,760
No, I'm... No, nothing is okay right now.

2580
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:43,160
No, absolutely nothing.

2581
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:45,580
I just want to know, chat, how...

2582
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:49,220
How long is the... is the...

2583
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:50,380
Oh, hey, Scott.

2584
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:53,700
How... Oh, something said...

2585
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,640
How long is the apartment's part?

2586
02:20:56,220 --> 02:21:01,240
How fucking long will I be trapped in the apartment?

2587
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:11,580
Alright, we need to find the clock keys.

2588
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:16,040
Camera, save one more time.

2589
02:21:20,580 --> 02:21:22,280
Oh my God, get me out.

2590
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:24,220
Somebody get me out of here.

2591
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:28,180
Somebody get me out of the fucking apartment, please.

2592
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:32,300
Somebody call the technician.

2593
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:39,180
Okay, well at least there's ammo here.

2594
02:21:45,150 --> 02:21:47,170
I want to be outside.

2595
02:21:51,990 --> 02:21:55,850
Someone give me the outside world again, that's...

2596
02:21:58,670 --> 02:22:00,910
Oh shit, the fuck?

2597
02:22:01,070 --> 02:22:01,750
No, my light.

2598
02:22:04,450 --> 02:22:05,210
Whoa!

2599
02:22:05,970 --> 02:22:07,210
It's not cool.

2600
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:11,410
You can't just turn off my light like that.

2601
02:22:13,350 --> 02:22:14,690
That's rude.

2602
02:22:17,470 --> 02:22:19,650
That's fucking rude, ma'am.

2603
02:22:23,410 --> 02:22:24,070
It's not cool.

2604
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:26,790
Hey, here.

2605
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:29,370
Oh, there's a dog.

2606
02:22:29,470 --> 02:22:30,750
Oh, there's... I got to break this.

2607
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:36,460
Okay, I got to break this wall.

2608
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:43,620
I was polite, I called her ma'am.

2609
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:48,860
Oh, hey, a big... Oh, hey, yeah, let's put bullets with the baby.

2610
02:22:51,380 --> 02:22:52,020
Stupid bug.

2611
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:57,740
I can't believe the bug got me.

2612
02:22:57,800 --> 02:22:59,120
Are you fucking serious?

2613
02:23:00,820 --> 02:23:03,840
The bug actually got me.

2614
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:06,900
They baited me with the baby!

2615
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:11,340
I got baited!

2616
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:18,560
I saw the baby and I was like, hehe.

2617
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:26,860
I just have to be sure.

2618
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:30,380
Because if they explode, I don't want to get near them.

2619
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:34,060
Oh, nice.

2620
02:23:35,180 --> 02:23:35,940
More ammo.

2621
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:40,080
Oh, thank God, they're giving me so much ammo.

2622
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:41,740
Thank fucking God.

2623
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:43,220
I needed this.

2624
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:45,020
I needed this.

2625
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:52,300
God, I wish they gave me more ammo.

2626
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:52,780
Heels.

2627
02:23:53,620 --> 02:23:57,040
I need less of that and more of the fucking heels.

2628
02:23:58,600 --> 02:23:59,960
Where do I go?

2629
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:02,400
Where am I?

2630
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:04,520
This is locked.

2631
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:08,620
Why'd they take me upstairs?

2632
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:10,100
Please make sense.

2633
02:24:13,180 --> 02:24:15,640
I need you to make sense.

2634
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:17,580
Why am I out here?

2635
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:19,200
Break the window?

2636
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:20,180
I can do that?

2637
02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:21,420
Vandalism?

2638
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:25,700
No, you guys were wrong.

2639
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:28,000
Climb?

2640
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:28,540
Where?

2641
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:29,300
Is that a ladder?

2642
02:24:35,810 --> 02:24:36,030
Oh!

2643
02:24:38,950 --> 02:24:40,450
Guys, it wasn't yellow.

2644
02:24:40,570 --> 02:24:41,550
I couldn't tell.

2645
02:24:45,930 --> 02:24:48,490
Guys, I can only read in yellow.

2646
02:24:52,010 --> 02:24:53,130
Oh, wait.

2647
02:24:53,170 --> 02:24:53,690
He was here.

2648
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:58,080
I was here.

2649
02:24:58,260 --> 02:24:59,280
Pyramid Head was here.

2650
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:07,720
Guys, I can't read in... I can't... I can only read in yellow, guys.

2651
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:08,400
You know that.

2652
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:14,720
Do I have to kill Pyramid Head?

2653
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:27,580
Okay.

2654
02:25:35,060 --> 02:25:36,640
Oh, I'm getting really scared now.

2655
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:38,620
I'm getting really scared, chat.

2656
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:41,200
I don't like this.

2657
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:46,260
I don't like all the... I don't like all the dead bodies here.

2658
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:46,460
Is there?

2659
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:56,400
There's so many dead bodies.

2660
02:25:57,380 --> 02:25:58,960
Why is there so many?

2661
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:06,480
I don't know which way to go.

2662
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:22,840
There's so many of you.

2663
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:23,380
Ah!

2664
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:30,000
Alright.

2665
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:35,320
My fucking toe touched it.

2666
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:42,120
My goddamn toe touched his stupid puke.

2667
02:26:44,690 --> 02:26:46,960
I can't believe my big toe.

2668
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:51,100
My fucking big ass toe fucked me up.

2669
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:54,970
I don't know what...

2670
02:26:56,660 --> 02:26:59,180
Oh, this area is so confusing to me.

2671
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:08,600
Oh, nice.

2672
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:09,240
More bullets.

2673
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:14,000
There's something on the other side.

2674
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:18,620
Oh my god, I'm so filled with fear right now.

2675
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:28,520
Okay, shortcut.

2676
02:27:28,820 --> 02:27:30,420
Why is there a shortcut like this?

2677
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:34,180
Like, what?

2678
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:37,740
Oh, they're all gonna come alive, aren't they?

2679
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:39,820
They're all gonna come alive.

2680
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,640
That's why there's a shortcut like this.

2681
02:27:43,300 --> 02:27:44,660
Oh, that's why.

2682
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:46,360
It makes so much more sense.

2683
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:47,120
That's why.

2684
02:27:48,800 --> 02:27:50,280
Oh, I know it.

2685
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:55,020
I fucking know it.

2686
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:58,020
Oh, I fucking know it.

2687
02:27:58,020 --> 02:27:59,260
They're all gonna come alive.

2688
02:27:59,420 --> 02:28:00,720
That's why it's like that.

2689
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:02,380
That's why.

2690
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:04,660
Makes you loop the loop.

2691
02:28:10,790 --> 02:28:11,910
There's a wall?

2692
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:14,230
Where?

2693
02:28:14,310 --> 02:28:15,030
Oh, there it is.

2694
02:28:15,130 --> 02:28:15,610
This one?

2695
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:25,280
Is this a shortcut?

2696
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:30,620
Yeah, it is.

2697
02:28:32,980 --> 02:28:37,700
I feel like they're all gonna come alive and I'm supposed to run away from them.

2698
02:28:40,020 --> 02:28:41,380
I feel it.

2699
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:44,580
That's why there's so many loop-de-loop areas.

2700
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:49,780
I can read the script right now.

2701
02:28:55,940 --> 02:29:01,000
Oh my god, I feel the script right now.

2702
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:04,000
I know what they wanna do!

2703
02:29:08,470 --> 02:29:09,830
What the fuck?

2704
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:14,020
Oh, what?

2705
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:15,200
Is that TV?

2706
02:29:18,940 --> 02:29:19,680
Okay.

2707
02:29:21,690 --> 02:29:23,180
What's that doing over there?

2708
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:26,760
Okay.

2709
02:29:27,580 --> 02:29:29,740
What are all these doing over there?

2710
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:31,260
I

2711
02:29:40,690 --> 02:29:41,090
got...

2712
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:42,470
and now there's another...

2713
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:43,450
Oh my god.

2714
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:46,410
Okay, here we go.

2715
02:29:47,210 --> 02:29:47,610
What?

2716
02:29:48,470 --> 02:29:50,770
Oh, the window closed.

2717
02:29:51,650 --> 02:29:51,990
Oh!

2718
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:55,670
I was like, what happened?

2719
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:56,750
What happened?

2720
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:05,080
Okay, I guess I'll raise the pressure.

2721
02:30:20,550 --> 02:30:22,750
Oh my god, please.

2722
02:30:23,630 --> 02:30:24,270
Please.

2723
02:30:25,930 --> 02:30:27,450
Oh god, please.

2724
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:28,590
Get out!

2725
02:30:31,310 --> 02:30:31,950
No!

2726
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:34,470
Please.

2727
02:30:37,630 --> 02:30:38,630
Oh my god.

2728
02:30:39,170 --> 02:30:41,190
Bro, that was so... oh my god.

2729
02:30:41,310 --> 02:30:43,350
Please, that was so much of my HP.

2730
02:30:43,350 --> 02:30:46,410
That was so much of my HP.

2731
02:30:47,070 --> 02:30:48,390
You guys suck!

2732
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:50,530
You guys suck!

2733
02:30:57,910 --> 02:30:59,630
What key did I get?

2734
02:31:00,210 --> 02:31:01,990
I don't even remember what key I got.

2735
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:03,010
306, okay.

2736
02:31:04,630 --> 02:31:05,150
Okay.

2737
02:31:10,990 --> 02:31:14,030
That was so much of my HP, chat.

2738
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:20,940
Oh.

2739
02:31:26,950 --> 02:31:28,870
Oh, she's ballerina now.

2740
02:31:28,990 --> 02:31:30,270
Wait, has she always been ballerina?

2741
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:39,200
Okay, now she has ballerina shoes.

2742
02:31:47,540 --> 02:31:48,840
Oh my god.

2743
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:50,760
Oh my god, my heart.

2744
02:31:51,580 --> 02:31:52,820
My heart.

2745
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:53,200
My heart.

2746
02:32:00,520 --> 02:32:03,360
My fucking heart right now.

2747
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,520
Oh, it's the regular ones.

2748
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:07,480
It's the regular ones.

2749
02:32:07,780 --> 02:32:09,520
It's not the extra freaky ones.

2750
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:10,860
That's fine!

2751
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:12,880
That's fine!

2752
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:17,980
No!

2753
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:19,220
No!

2754
02:32:21,740 --> 02:32:22,800
Oh no.

2755
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:23,040
Oh no.

2756
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:27,580
Oh my... guys, remember when I had 30 bullets?

2757
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:29,120
Me too, I remember.

2758
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:36,360
I remember when I had 30 bullets, guys.

2759
02:32:43,810 --> 02:32:45,810
Bro, there's not enough room.

2760
02:32:45,910 --> 02:32:47,570
There's only so little room, man!

2761
02:32:56,330 --> 02:32:58,400
There's only so little room!

2762
02:33:03,070 --> 02:33:04,270
Like, please!

2763
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:17,940
Oh, my head has the bullet count?

2764
02:33:18,100 --> 02:33:19,660
I had 30 at one point.

2765
02:33:23,050 --> 02:33:27,790
And then life was like... has a sick way of being like...

2766
02:33:29,210 --> 02:33:29,730
JK.

2767
02:33:31,390 --> 02:33:32,430
What the fuck?

2768
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:38,430
Okay.

2769
02:33:42,170 --> 02:33:44,290
I just... I didn't want to risk it, man.

2770
02:33:44,710 --> 02:33:48,110
I just didn't want to risk it, bro.

2771
02:33:48,110 --> 02:33:52,010
She just walked up to me and I was like, self-defense.

2772
02:33:52,310 --> 02:33:54,490
I plead self-defense!

2773
02:34:05,960 --> 02:34:06,560
Alright.

2774
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:08,060
I missed a photo?

2775
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:15,160
What photo?

2776
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:24,140
Where could it be?

2777
02:34:30,220 --> 02:34:32,380
I have no idea what you're talking about.

2778
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:37,560
There's a little photo?

2779
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:41,000
There is not a photo.

2780
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:42,100
That's just blood.

2781
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:46,080
That's just blood.

2782
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:52,860
Okay, what do I have?

2783
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:53,800
I have the valve.

2784
02:34:55,240 --> 02:34:57,020
And I go back to 307.

2785
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:04,600
I just run.

2786
02:35:18,190 --> 02:35:19,650
Like, I don't know what else to do.

2787
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:21,270
Oh, shit!

2788
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:25,210
Alright, that's just a regular guy.

2789
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:35,740
Alright, there you go.

2790
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:37,800
Oh my god.

2791
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:39,240
Okay.

2792
02:35:39,980 --> 02:35:41,040
To the right we go.

2793
02:35:42,500 --> 02:35:43,420
Oh yeah, you're not dead.

2794
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:49,860
I think I don't know a thing when I see one!

2795
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:51,300
Oh, shit!

2796
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:53,400
Oh my god, get out here!

2797
02:35:53,780 --> 02:35:55,000
The second cockroach!

2798
02:35:57,380 --> 02:35:59,960
He was like, oh my god, I want to join in.

2799
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:04,660
He's just like, is this a party?

2800
02:36:05,220 --> 02:36:06,800
And I wasn't invited?

2801
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:15,060
When you find out the cockroach can fly.

2802
02:36:23,390 --> 02:36:25,930
Everyone decides to join in.

2803
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:28,250
Alright.

2804
02:36:29,230 --> 02:36:30,370
Did I do it?

2805
02:36:31,850 --> 02:36:32,770
Oh, I got the key!

2806
02:36:33,710 --> 02:36:35,130
Oh, I got the hour hand!

2807
02:36:35,790 --> 02:36:36,190
Nice.

2808
02:36:37,070 --> 02:36:38,690
Oh, that must be a shortcut out.

2809
02:36:47,490 --> 02:36:48,570
Oh, thank god.

2810
02:36:54,430 --> 02:36:54,830
Okay.

2811
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:03,440
I don't remember where the- is this the save point area?

2812
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:06,820
Oh my god, it is.

2813
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:07,700
Oh, thank god.

2814
02:37:12,060 --> 02:37:12,500
Please.

2815
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:17,300
Oh my god, we made it all the way here.

2816
02:37:17,380 --> 02:37:18,240
We made it back.

2817
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:24,880
Alright.

2818
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:31,430
I don't fucking know what that is.

2819
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:38,240
Is that where it's pointing at?

2820
02:37:39,900 --> 02:37:41,720
Alright, now where do I go?

2821
02:37:46,150 --> 02:37:47,710
Do I have any other items?

2822
02:37:51,900 --> 02:37:53,420
Alright, we're gonna call it here.

2823
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:58,240
That's enough for my brain today.

2824
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:08,480
That's enough for my brain.

2825
02:38:09,820 --> 02:38:11,700
That's enough for today.

2826
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:13,440
There.

2827
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:21,280
Oh my god.

2828
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:23,600
My brain was just like...

2829
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:27,660
My brain was literally like flatlining there and then I'm like, you know what?

2830
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:31,920
It's a good time to stop.

2831
02:38:33,940 --> 02:38:35,440
Puzzle, puzzle detect.

2832
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:37,180
Guys, I already did two puzzles.

2833
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:39,480
I don't know if I can do the third.

2834
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:46,560
I don't know if a third puzzle is gonna hit the spot, guys.

2835
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:51,280
The thinking cap has been reached.

2836
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:53,180
Thank you for the super chat.

2837
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:54,140
Thank you, thank you.

2838
02:38:54,420 --> 02:38:57,860
Good job getting through the American ghost to a gun range during ammo shortage.

2839
02:38:58,160 --> 02:38:59,900
Emotional experience.

2840
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:02,140
Thank you for the super chat.

2841
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,860
Thank you, thank you.

2842
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:12,200
Anton, did you get top 500 Overwatch 2 this season or do you owe Paladin and James a debt?

2843
02:39:12,340 --> 02:39:13,620
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

2844
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:14,280
Thank you, thank you.

2845
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:14,600
Okay, wait.

2846
02:39:14,700 --> 02:39:17,480
How many days left do I have of the season?

2847
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:22,600
Guys, I actually... What was the bet that I made?

2848
02:39:22,780 --> 02:39:25,480
There was so many things going on, guys.

2849
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:37,540
Guys, double or nothing next season.

2850
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:39,140
I'll get it, guys, guys.

2851
02:39:39,700 --> 02:39:40,220
Negotiate.

2852
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:43,360
Double or nothing, I'll get it next season.

2853
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:47,800
And if I don't, if I don't, you guys, you guys cannot.

2854
02:39:48,580 --> 02:39:50,800
Double or nothing next season.

2855
02:39:51,020 --> 02:39:51,800
I'll do it.

2856
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:53,160
I'll do it next season.

2857
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:55,180
There was just a lot of stuff going on.

2858
02:39:55,380 --> 02:39:59,300
But this time, this time it'll be different, guys.

2859
02:39:59,440 --> 02:40:00,280
Double or nothing.

2860
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:09,260
Don't worry.

2861
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:11,680
Like, don't worry.

2862
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:14,720
Guys, double or nothing.

2863
02:40:14,940 --> 02:40:16,620
I promise you guys, next season.

2864
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:25,420
If I don't get it next season, then, then you guys can claim your prize.

2865
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:28,000
I have an excuse.

2866
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:30,340
I was sick, chat.

2867
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:33,820
I was so sick, guys.

2868
02:40:39,080 --> 02:40:40,100
Paladin, please.

2869
02:40:40,760 --> 02:40:41,320
Please.

2870
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:43,680
Please, please, Paladin.

2871
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:46,280
Double or nothing, please.

2872
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:47,380
I'll do anything.

2873
02:40:47,540 --> 02:40:51,640
If I don't get top 500, you can request anything.

2874
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:56,840
You can literally request anything in your dreams.

2875
02:40:57,020 --> 02:41:00,300
It will be yours if you give me double.

2876
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:02,060
No, no, not now.

2877
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:03,180
Not now.

2878
02:41:05,740 --> 02:41:06,700
Please, Paladin.

2879
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:14,820
I swear, next season, if I don't do it, you get anything you ever want.

2880
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:16,860
Anything.

2881
02:41:18,100 --> 02:41:21,320
I told my teacher that when I was, this is my homework.

2882
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:22,700
I was sick.

2883
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:24,040
Angela, thank you for the super chat.

2884
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:24,980
Thank you, thank you.

2885
02:41:25,400 --> 02:41:26,260
Guys, please.

2886
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:27,660
Oh, I have another excuse.

2887
02:41:27,800 --> 02:41:28,700
Guys, my voice.

2888
02:41:28,700 --> 02:41:30,740
Oh, my voice, guys.

2889
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:31,700
Oh, wait.

2890
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:33,620
Oh, my God.

2891
02:41:33,700 --> 02:41:34,480
My voice.

2892
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:37,120
Oh, my God.

2893
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:39,960
I can barely talk anymore.

2894
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:47,900
I need a rest.

2895
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:52,100
I can barely, barely talk.

2896
02:41:57,980 --> 02:41:59,280
JL, anything.

2897
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:00,960
Paladin, you have the power.

2898
02:42:01,360 --> 02:42:02,720
Think about it, Paladin.

2899
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:04,900
Think about it.

2900
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:14,540
Just think about it, guys.

2901
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:16,460
Paladin, come on.

2902
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:21,440
You can request anything you want if I don't make it next season.

2903
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:24,020
It's a double or nothing, Paladin.

2904
02:42:24,380 --> 02:42:28,920
The world is your oyster.

2905
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:34,840
Guys, I would never lie.

2906
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:37,080
After giving you the example.

2907
02:42:37,700 --> 02:42:41,980
After proving to you guys what lying can get you.

2908
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:43,920
I would never lie.

2909
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:49,660
I would never do such a thing.

2910
02:42:53,870 --> 02:42:55,050
Don't worry.

2911
02:42:58,250 --> 02:43:00,950
It's literally one more hour.

2912
02:43:01,390 --> 02:43:02,610
No, you don't understand.

2913
02:43:02,990 --> 02:43:05,230
This game scares the shit out of me.

2914
02:43:05,550 --> 02:43:07,050
You don't understand.

2915
02:43:10,690 --> 02:43:13,130
You don't understand.

2916
02:43:16,070 --> 02:43:19,090
This game is so fucking scary.

2917
02:43:19,650 --> 02:43:21,170
You want a contract?

2918
02:43:21,430 --> 02:43:22,510
I will fucking fine.

2919
02:43:22,830 --> 02:43:24,570
I'll fucking... Okay, here we go.

2920
02:43:24,630 --> 02:43:25,630
This is the contract.

2921
02:43:26,510 --> 02:43:27,490
Do we have any lawyers?

2922
02:43:27,870 --> 02:43:29,910
Do we have any Dragoon lawyers in chat?

2923
02:43:30,150 --> 02:43:33,690
Double or nothing.

2924
02:43:40,030 --> 02:43:44,810
Overwatch top 500 next season.

2925
02:43:52,510 --> 02:43:56,290
Paladin gets anything.

2926
02:43:57,350 --> 02:43:58,310
There we go.

2927
02:43:58,930 --> 02:44:00,190
Okay, we have a law student.

2928
02:44:00,270 --> 02:44:01,010
That's almost.

2929
02:44:01,230 --> 02:44:02,810
This will be your first job.

2930
02:44:03,870 --> 02:44:04,350
Alright.

2931
02:44:06,390 --> 02:44:09,200
And then...

2932
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:10,200
There we go.

2933
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:11,260
And I'll sign for you too.

2934
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:19,880
Don't worry.

2935
02:44:20,480 --> 02:44:22,980
I got you.

2936
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:24,400
I'll sign for you.

2937
02:44:28,020 --> 02:44:28,760
Don't worry.

2938
02:44:28,860 --> 02:44:29,500
I got you.

2939
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:35,020
And then a lawyer can look at this and confirm for me.

2940
02:44:35,020 --> 02:44:41,420
Alright, the moment the lawyer confirms for me, then it is official.

2941
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:42,300
There we go.

2942
02:44:42,960 --> 02:44:44,760
The left side is your signature.

2943
02:44:45,260 --> 02:44:46,440
Thank you for signing it.

2944
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:50,180
Doki can't be trusted since she banned a guy because she didn't like...

2945
02:44:50,180 --> 02:44:50,480
No!

2946
02:44:50,700 --> 02:44:52,440
I banned him because he lied.

2947
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:53,300
That's different.

2948
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:55,680
That's so different.

2949
02:44:59,020 --> 02:45:00,700
Thank you for the super chat.

2950
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:02,020
Thank you.

2951
02:45:04,460 --> 02:45:09,000
One of the things I've always admired about you is your willingness to follow through with bets and bargains with your chat.

2952
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:10,820
Thank you for the super chat.

2953
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:11,240
Thank you.

2954
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:12,020
Thank you, guys.

2955
02:45:12,380 --> 02:45:13,360
Alright, paladin.

2956
02:45:13,440 --> 02:45:14,160
Do we have a deal?

2957
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:15,820
Give me a handshake right now.

2958
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:17,880
Handshake right now.

2959
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:19,420
Come on.

2960
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:20,100
Come on.

2961
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:20,660
You know what you want.

2962
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:21,780
This is such a good deal.

2963
02:45:21,940 --> 02:45:22,340
Come on.

2964
02:45:22,380 --> 02:45:22,760
Here we go.

2965
02:45:22,860 --> 02:45:23,900
I have my hand out.

2966
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:25,780
Paladins, I have...

2967
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:28,100
Come on.

2968
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:29,760
Give me the other hand, paladins.

2969
02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:30,540
Come on.

2970
02:45:30,540 --> 02:45:31,580
It's right there.

2971
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:32,620
It's...

2972
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:34,400
Come on.

2973
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:36,140
You know you want to shake the hand.

2974
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:36,960
Come on.

2975
02:45:37,420 --> 02:45:38,940
Give me the other hand.

2976
02:45:42,620 --> 02:45:43,920
Come on, paladin.

2977
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:46,660
Just shake the hand.

2978
02:45:46,940 --> 02:45:47,400
Just...

2979
02:45:48,820 --> 02:45:51,460
Just shake the hand, paladin.

2980
02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:52,420
Come on.

2981
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:53,220
Right there.

2982
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:54,120
No, no, no.

2983
02:45:54,220 --> 02:45:54,700
You...

2984
02:45:54,700 --> 02:45:56,380
Oh, shit.

2985
02:45:56,540 --> 02:45:57,120
Okay, wait.

2986
02:45:57,380 --> 02:45:58,500
No, no, no.

2987
02:45:58,500 --> 02:45:59,580
No, paladin.

2988
02:45:59,600 --> 02:45:59,940
Come on.

2989
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:00,800
You know you want to.

2990
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:02,240
Just put the other hand.

2991
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:03,720
Put...

2992
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:08,000
Put the other hand in there.

2993
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:09,220
You know you want to.

2994
02:46:10,480 --> 02:46:12,120
Don't listen to the haters.

2995
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:14,320
Listen to your oshi.

2996
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:19,400
Toki, I can't believe you pulled the oshi card like that.

2997
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:23,980
I can't believe it.

2998
02:46:24,820 --> 02:46:26,180
Where are you, paladins?

2999
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:28,760
Where are you?

3000
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:30,800
Where is he?

3001
02:46:30,820 --> 02:46:31,660
I don't see him.

3002
02:46:33,240 --> 02:46:34,460
I don't see him.

3003
02:46:34,580 --> 02:46:35,020
Where is he?

3004
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:36,440
I don't see his response.

3005
02:46:36,620 --> 02:46:37,860
No, he didn't say no.

3006
02:46:38,120 --> 02:46:39,280
He didn't say...

3007
02:46:39,280 --> 02:46:42,660
That's emotional blackmail.

3008
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:47,640
I don't see you.

3009
02:46:48,540 --> 02:46:50,780
Paladins, just put that hand there.

3010
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:51,320
You know?

3011
02:46:51,620 --> 02:46:53,160
That's all you have to do.

3012
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:55,280
Just put your hand there.

3013
02:46:55,460 --> 02:46:59,560
Just put that...

3014
02:47:00,460 --> 02:47:02,440
Oh my god!

3015
02:47:03,020 --> 02:47:04,800
That's fucked.

3016
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:08,660
That's fucked.

3017
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:10,680
But you know what's more fucked?

3018
02:47:14,740 --> 02:47:18,660
Oh, you're gonna regret this, paladin.

3019
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:22,000
Oh, you're gonna...

3020
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,620
You're gonna regret this.

3021
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:28,180
Because look what I found.

3022
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:31,000
Look what I found.

3023
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:32,100
He shook his hand.

3024
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:33,040
It's over.

3025
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:35,040
Hand has been shook.

3026
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:38,460
Thank you for accepting the deal.

3027
02:47:45,090 --> 02:47:46,870
Wow, paladins.

3028
02:47:46,870 --> 02:47:48,850
Thank you so much.

3029
02:47:49,450 --> 02:47:50,270
For...

3030
02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:53,770
For accepting that deal.

3031
02:47:54,910 --> 02:47:56,050
I really...

3032
02:47:56,050 --> 02:47:57,890
I really appreciate it.

3033
02:47:58,070 --> 02:47:59,190
Thank you.

3034
02:47:59,370 --> 02:48:06,150
I'm so happy that you decided to double or nothing the arrangement that we had.

3035
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:10,030
I really...

3036
02:48:10,030 --> 02:48:12,430
I really appreciate it, paladins.

3037
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:16,690
For giving me that handshake in the end.

3038
02:48:16,870 --> 02:48:19,230
And letting me...

3039
02:48:19,230 --> 02:48:21,510
Letting us do a double or nothing.

3040
02:48:26,890 --> 02:48:28,230
How do you know?

3041
02:48:28,430 --> 02:48:29,830
How do you know that's not his hand?

3042
02:48:29,890 --> 02:48:31,450
He literally wrote that down.

3043
02:48:32,090 --> 02:48:34,010
He wrote this down, chat.

3044
02:48:34,450 --> 02:48:36,350
How would you know?

3045
02:48:42,690 --> 02:48:45,850
JL, I so look forward to Doki's stream.

3046
02:48:46,870 --> 02:48:47,590
Thank you for the super chat.

3047
02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:47,950
Thank you.

3048
02:48:48,650 --> 02:48:49,450
Wow.

3049
02:48:50,490 --> 02:48:51,370
Anyway, guys.

3050
02:48:51,790 --> 02:48:52,270
Thank you.

3051
02:48:52,530 --> 02:48:57,550
Huge shout out to paladins.

3052
02:48:58,050 --> 02:49:01,230
For agreeing to this double or nothing.

3053
02:49:02,030 --> 02:49:04,590
And then shaking my hand.

3054
02:49:05,050 --> 02:49:06,910
For this arrangement.

3055
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:10,610
And as his oshi.

3056
02:49:11,350 --> 02:49:14,470
I shall honor this deal.

3057
02:49:15,170 --> 02:49:17,030
For the double or nothing.

3058
02:49:26,230 --> 02:49:28,310
It was a great time.

3059
02:49:28,410 --> 02:49:30,410
I had a great time today, guys.

3060
02:49:30,910 --> 02:49:34,250
I had a great time.

3061
02:49:36,230 --> 02:49:37,770
That's not his hand.

3062
02:49:37,930 --> 02:49:38,830
Oh, yeah?

3063
02:49:39,070 --> 02:49:41,250
How do you know that, Mike?

3064
02:49:41,250 --> 02:49:43,110
You have never seen his hand before?

3065
02:49:43,790 --> 02:49:44,710
Thank you for the super chat.

3066
02:49:44,750 --> 02:49:45,070
Thank you.

3067
02:49:45,130 --> 02:49:46,930
You don't know that.

3068
02:49:47,430 --> 02:49:50,870
We don't have a supreme court here to challenge me.

3069
02:49:54,450 --> 02:49:55,690
Anyway, guys.

3070
02:49:56,290 --> 02:49:57,850
I'm gonna head off now.

3071
02:49:58,490 --> 02:50:00,150
As always, everybody.

3072
02:50:02,010 --> 02:50:02,830
Say hi.

3073
02:50:04,310 --> 02:50:05,430
Photoshop this.

3074
02:50:05,690 --> 02:50:06,170
What?

3075
02:50:06,170 --> 02:50:07,830
Darkblade!

3076
02:50:10,030 --> 02:50:10,510
Darkblade.

3077
02:50:10,870 --> 02:50:13,330
I can't believe you would...

3078
02:50:13,330 --> 02:50:17,770
I can't believe you would say such a thing.

3079
02:50:17,930 --> 02:50:19,710
Give me like...

3080
02:50:19,710 --> 02:50:21,270
Oh, my gosh.

3081
02:50:21,370 --> 02:50:22,510
I can't...

3082
02:50:22,510 --> 02:50:25,470
I can't believe you would...

3083
02:50:25,470 --> 02:50:27,710
Say such a thing.

3084
02:50:27,870 --> 02:50:28,750
Darkblade.

3085
02:50:28,750 --> 02:50:28,930
Darkblade.

3086
02:50:33,570 --> 02:50:36,390
How could you say that?

3087
02:50:39,230 --> 02:50:40,110
How...

3088
02:50:43,150 --> 02:50:45,850
How could you say such a thing?

3089
02:50:46,390 --> 02:50:49,190
I don't understand.

3090
02:50:49,930 --> 02:50:54,050
I don't understand what you're talking about, guys.

3091
02:50:54,250 --> 02:50:56,290
I would never...

3092
02:50:56,290 --> 02:50:58,290
I would never...

3093
02:51:00,430 --> 02:51:03,550
I would never use Photoshop.

3094
02:51:03,950 --> 02:51:04,310
But like...

3095
02:51:04,810 --> 02:51:06,050
Yeah, no, you're right.

3096
02:51:06,430 --> 02:51:07,850
You're right, Darkblade.

3097
02:51:08,910 --> 02:51:10,510
I am a doki bird.

3098
02:51:18,620 --> 02:51:19,820
I don't know.

3099
02:51:21,020 --> 02:51:22,660
You're right, Darkblade.

3100
02:51:22,840 --> 02:51:24,400
I am a doki bird, though.

3101
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:25,840
Hey, guys.

3102
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:26,780
Thank you for the super chat.

3103
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:27,800
Thank you, thank you.

3104
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:30,980
She hated him because he said the truth.

3105
02:51:31,360 --> 02:51:33,880
Also, truth, to be fair.

3106
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:35,740
Thank you for the super chat.

3107
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:36,900
Thank you, thank you.

3108
02:51:37,580 --> 02:51:39,420
I went to University of America.

3109
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:40,400
American Samoa.

3110
02:51:40,540 --> 02:51:41,140
Exactly!

3111
02:51:42,020 --> 02:51:43,460
We have lawyers confirming.

3112
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:47,420
Guys, we have lawyers confirming.

3113
02:51:48,820 --> 02:51:49,420
Momohaku.

3114
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:50,660
Obviously, she's...

3115
02:51:50,660 --> 02:51:53,160
What forgery are you talking about?

3116
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:56,020
What forgery?

3117
02:51:56,300 --> 02:51:58,400
She took chat away.

3118
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:05,120
Now, nobody can confirm anything.

3119
02:52:05,500 --> 02:52:06,060
No more.

3120
02:52:06,820 --> 02:52:08,460
I don't even have...

3121
02:52:08,460 --> 02:52:10,720
Even chat disappeared.

3122
02:52:11,160 --> 02:52:14,260
Even chat...

3123
02:52:14,260 --> 02:52:14,800
There we go.

3124
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:15,760
Look at that.

3125
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:17,620
See?

3126
02:52:18,460 --> 02:52:19,400
I'm a doki bird.

3127
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:20,120
Anyway, guys.

3128
02:52:20,420 --> 02:52:21,180
I'm gonna head off now.

3129
02:52:21,460 --> 02:52:23,240
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

3130
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:26,840
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3131
02:52:26,960 --> 02:52:29,700
