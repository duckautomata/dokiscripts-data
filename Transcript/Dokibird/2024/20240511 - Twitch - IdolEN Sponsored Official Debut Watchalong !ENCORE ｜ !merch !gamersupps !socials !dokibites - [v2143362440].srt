1
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:49,450
Wow!

2
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,130
Good morning!

3
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,010
Good morning everybody!

4
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,270
Hello, hello!

5
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,630
Okay, I hope she doesn't start while I'm doing my intro.

6
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,830
So, Edelian has requested me to not show any of the audio or the visuals of their debut.

7
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,570
So, you'll have to click on the link if you want to see what I'm watching.

8
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,350
Anyway, it was so last minute.

9
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,530
They literally contacted me, I think like two or three days ago.

10
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,550
I don't remember.

11
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,790
I just remember like one of my staff like just messaged me about it.

12
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,130
And then I was like, oh, I haven't really done like something like this before.

13
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,290
I figured like, to be fair, okay.

14
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,030
They offered a lot of money and I was like, because it's sponsored.

15
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,990
I was just like, you know what?

16
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,950
I mean...

17
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,170
I can use this to reinvest in my channel.

18
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:54,830
I can use this to like reinvest into Doki Bird, into my channel.

19
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,250
And like into like stuff for you, Dragoons.

20
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,310
And I'm, oh my gosh.

21
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,890
I just, I can't spoil anything.

22
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,130
But I've been...

23
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,070
There's a lot of projects down the line that require a lot of funding.

24
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,330
So, I was like, oh, okay.

25
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,070
This would be good.

26
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,050
Oh, shit.

27
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,750
She's starting.

28
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,690
Okay.

29
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,430
I haven't done one of these in a long time.

30
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,130
I haven't watched a fucking full debut in a very long time.

31
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,870
Oh, it started.

32
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,410
Funding secured.

33
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,130
True.

34
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,370
Oh, they're using the AI.

35
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,410
AI voice.

36
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,450
Okay.

37
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,490
She's like a, she's like a fireman.

38
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
The text-to-speech.

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,580
Yeah.

40
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,580
I'm not gonna lie.

41
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,320
From all the like ads with that exact voice.

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Like my first instinct is to flee, you know, like the flight or flight or fight.

43
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,620
Every time I hear, hear that voice that like text-to-speech voice.

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,820
I was like flight.

45
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,400
Yeah.

46
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,040
Yeah.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,500
Yeah.

48
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,920
Yeah.

49
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

50
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,220
Yeah.

51
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,720
We will.

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,100
We will.

53
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,940
Okay.

54
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,780
You know, what's funny.

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm so sorry.

56
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,760
I'm talking over your deep.

57
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:40,620
Ever since like, ever since like, uh, the, like, uh, the idol EN sponsored watch along news broke out.

58
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,880
I got a lot of companies reaching out to me because it like opened the fucking dam.

59
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,620
A lot of companies started reaching out.

60
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,580
Asking if I would want to do like a, do like an official watch alongs and stuff like that.

61
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:11,340
And then like, um, my staff, one of my staff members was like, yeah, like we, we were after your, after like that tweet went public, a lot of companies reached out.

62
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,740
I was like, oh shit.

63
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,820
And then obviously I'm not going to take every offer.

64
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,400
This was like, I was, uh, I was like the first one to reach out.

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,940
So I was just like, yeah, yeah, I can do it.

66
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,220
I mean, they're offering a lot.

67
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,000
So I might as well.

68
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,660
Unless, unless the company gives me a lot of money.

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,100
I won't be accepting all of them.

70
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,440
Toki's doing sponsored watch along.

71
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,460
Let's fucking go.

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,700
Oh my gosh.

73
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,440
All her assets are really pretty though.

74
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,840
Oh no.

75
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,080
The shorts meta.

76
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,500
I like how she used a fucking fake PNG.

77
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,380
You're now the advertising meta.

78
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,300
Book your Toki bird today.

79
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,120
No, I'm like a cameo.

80
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,100
I'm literally cameo.

81
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
Oh my gosh.

82
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,480
Her ears move.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,860
Her ears are like dog ears.

84
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,440
You're saying fucking vertical streamers.

85
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,920
Wait.

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,280
Is she using like those?

87
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,320
Those like pre subtitles?

88
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,660
Wait.

89
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,120
Oh no.

90
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,560
Whoa.

91
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
She timed those.

92
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,940
Wait.

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,920
I can't tell if those are like, I can't tell if those subtitles are like AI generated.

94
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,560
Not AI.

95
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,580
Is it like those like those translating ones where you talk and then the subtitles show up?

96
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,140
Or like she fucking timed the subtitles perfectly.

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,300
The last subtitles.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,140
I can't tell.

99
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,780
I don't know if that was like generated or not.

100
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,160
That was actually crazy.

101
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,720
I know there's like one for like Japanese as well.

102
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,680
Like Japanese live translation.

103
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,740
That's something.

104
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,360
There's something not generated.

105
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,900
I can't watch two streams at once on mobile.

106
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,960
It feels bad, man.

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,080
They're like apparently, Encore is apparently like an idol.

108
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,280
An idol.

109
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,500
Idol.

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,080
Group.

111
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,820
An idol.

112
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,240
Idol.

113
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,640
Group.

114
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,920
I think it's like their first one.

115
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,900
So they're all like technically singers.

116
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,500
They're actually.

117
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,140
Oh no.

118
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,880
That's the singing.

119
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,020
But apparently they're like made just for singing.

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,840
So like they're all should be like really good singers.

121
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,320
Technically.

122
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,570
Wait.

123
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,990
What?

124
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,570
What?

125
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,670
What?

126
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:54,910
What?

127
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,110
What?

128
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,390
Yeah.

129
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,150
Like actually idol focused.

130
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,890
Yeah.

131
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,910
Free entertainment.

132
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,750
Let's go for free concert for free.

133
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,710
I love free concerts.

134
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,410
I can't believe it.

135
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,810
They paid me to watch a concert.

136
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,310
It's great.

137
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,710
Also guys, you guys don't know.

138
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,710
I'm only watching one stream.

139
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,380
I'm so busy.

140
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,760
This was supposed to be a rest week.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,420
And then, thank God, okay, not thank God that it's like, she's like scuffed a little.

142
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,700
But at least I can talk a little bit more to you guys.

143
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,440
I can give more announcements while she's figuring stuff out.

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:14,320
Not thank God for her, but it gives me time to give you guys announcements while she sets everything up.

145
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,660
Anyway, this week was supposed to be...

146
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,860
This week was supposed to be rest week, but so many things came up last minute.

147
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,940
Dang Toki.

148
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,080
I'm so busy.

149
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
How considerate of her, that she lets me like, do my nows me.

150
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,360
What?

151
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,220
What?

152
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm just listening to the lyrics and I'm like, what?

153
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,720
Why is this?

154
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,940
Why is this?

155
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,120
Like, why?

156
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,160
Why is this?

157
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,950
It is white boy rap!

158
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,360
This rap is too lit for Old Lady Toki!

159
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,280
No!

160
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,980
What are you talking about?

161
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,880
Is this what zoomers listen to now?

162
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,180
Is this what zoomers listen to?

163
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Of course this is what zoomers listen to.

164
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm a zoomer, right?

165
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,030
Wait, is this... okay.

166
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,730
Is this an original rap?

167
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,270
Or like, is she doing a cover?

168
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,250
Are these real lyrics?

169
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,520
There's no way she's freestyling this, right?

170
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,660
There's no way!

171
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,200
The lyrics, like, sort of made sense from the ones that I could, like, figure out.

172
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,740
Toki's in her 60s, Toki Beach!

173
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,520
I am ageless!

174
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,100
Anime women do not age!

175
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,900
I'll forever be hit with the times!

176
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,620
She's coming after Drake next.

177
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,640
I heard there was, like, some fucking Drake vs.

178
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
Kendrick Lamar drama.

179
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,100
And, like, honestly, I have not been paying any attention to, like, pop culture since becoming an...

180
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,740
Well, to be fair, I only... I only, like...

181
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,020
absorbed the stuff that shows up on Twitter.

182
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,480
But then when I heard about the Drake vs.

183
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,560
Kendrick Lamar drama, I was like, Drake?

184
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,600
The fucking Canadian boy?

185
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,290
That guy... that guy is, like... that guy is, like, fucking...

186
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,870
Like, nobody takes him seriously.

187
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,630
From Degrassi?

188
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,010
Yeah!

189
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,150
That's, like, the Degrassi dude?

190
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,870
The guy that was in the wheelchair?

191
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,680
The guy from the meme?

192
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,950
Oh, this is, like, her trailer... her, like, info trailer.

193
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,730
Drake, the famous explorer.

194
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,070
No, nobody will ever forget that he was on Degrassi.

195
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,220
I feel like debut streams is always so nerve-wracking.

196
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,520
Obviously, because it's, like, you know, it's, like, the first impression.

197
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,320
And it's, like, the first time you're gonna get, like, so many eyes on you.

198
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,340
Like, sometimes, you know, people who debut... do debut streams or, like, join a company and do a debut stream.

199
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,360
They never had the... this is, like, the most they've ever got in their entire lives.

200
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,340
So, it's so nerve-wracking.

201
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,860
I remember when I was, like, so fucking nervous and my voice was shaking.

202
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,280
And I was just like...

203
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,120
Grapes are great.

204
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,940
I like cotton...

205
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,320
Okay, the cotton candy grapes are really good.

206
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,940
Wait, is she actually a rapper?

207
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,040
I... I could... I could...

208
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,080
I thought... I thought...

209
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,720
I thought that was a joke.

210
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm sorry!

211
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,380
I didn't think she was actually... she was actually a rapper.

212
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,420
I thought she was... I thought that was, like, the joke part.

213
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,460
I couldn't tell!

214
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,490
I couldn't listen to the lyrics!

215
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,390
I couldn't tell!

216
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,580
Wait, that was her narrating?

217
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,640
Wait, what?

218
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,360
Oh my god, that was her narrating!

219
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,000
That's actually... that's actually talented.

220
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,020
Damn.

221
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,000
I can do three voices.

222
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,200
This.

223
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,080
This.

224
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,200
This.

225
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,680
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

226
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,420
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

227
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,720
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

228
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,980
Yeah, that sounded so different.

229
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,560
All Toki all the time.

230
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,060
Who was that Toki?

231
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,580
For free?

232
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,240
Oh my god, this should have been, like...

233
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,520
Paid.

234
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,500
I can't believe they paid me for this!

235
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,120
Wow!

236
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,280
And I... I got paid for this.

237
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,560
Wow!

238
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,280
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

239
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,090
They paid you for fee!

240
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,370
Paid to look at me!

241
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,870
People will kill to be in my position!

242
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,230
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

243
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,790
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

244
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,960
Why couldn't it be me?

245
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,090
Hey!

246
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,950
Mismatched accessories...

247
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,270
is a fucking...

248
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,150
staple...

249
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,470
in VTuber culture.

250
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,390
I have no idea why.

251
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,610
I think it's like one of the ways where...

252
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,490
I mean, I've mismatched socks too.

253
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,130
Mismatched tights.

254
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,590
But it's like...

255
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,410
It's like a staple in VTuber design.

256
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,090
I think it's like a way to be more unique.

257
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,270
Well, most of the mismatch you don't even see anyway!

258
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,050
Because you only see the fucking...

259
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,990
I'm symmetrical other than my bow tie...

260
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,750
My bows here.

261
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,290
Like, holy shit.

262
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,390
It's so fluid for something we can't see.

263
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,670
For like 99% of the stream.

264
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,450
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

265
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,010
A lot of the...

266
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,990
A lot of like the creative aesthetic stuff...

267
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,510
Like, we don't even see it 99% of the time.

268
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,150
Because it's usually up on the shoulders and up.

269
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,330
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

270
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,390
The arms are so fluid.

271
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,010
So flowing.

272
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,760
Whoa!

273
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,540
It burns off?

274
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,300
That's a waste of...

275
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,200
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

276
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,140
The taxpayers paid for that uniform!

277
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,760
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

278
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,630
Okay, the flame burning off the clothes was actually pretty cool.

279
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,490
Oh my god, it burns back?

280
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,530
This...

281
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,930
This goes against the laws of physics.

282
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,150
Who is she?

283
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,550
Fuck the taxpayers, I guess.

284
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,830
Damn.

285
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,710
What's the proper VTuber thing?

286
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,200
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

287
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,120
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

288
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,990
Is she gonna have an angy face?

289
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,470
I can do that.

290
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,050
Say that again.

291
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,090
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

292
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,950
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

293
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,730
Oh no, that's a...

294
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,510
You know, that's...

295
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,710
That's a part of her skin suit.

296
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,160
This is like the one time you see me do an angry face.

297
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,380
Cause I'm just happy all the time.

298
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,700
Or just, like, fanatic.

299
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,380
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

300
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,240
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

301
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,040
Wait, what the fuck?

302
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,560
Wait, I wanna be able to do that!

303
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,220
I can't do that!

304
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,120
Gotta use Photoshop!

305
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,400
Yeah, that face is good.

306
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
That one's nice.

307
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,440
I like that her lore video did not take herself seriously.

308
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,640
Cause I'm, like, really tired of very...

309
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,300
Like, I don't know!

310
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,820
I feel like very serious lore videos...

311
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,540
There's, like, been so many...

312
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,160
I feel like it's been, like, overdone now.

313
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,740
That people just sort of, like, gloss over it these days.

314
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,360
Because after the debut, they're like, I am the demon from hell.

315
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,220
And, like, trauma dump, trauma dump.

316
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,280
But now, I'm here VTubing.

317
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,140
And then, after the lore video...

318
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,740
Of the very super serious lore video...

319
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,920
It's like...

320
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,240
It's like none of that existed.

321
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,200
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

322
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,080
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

323
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,820
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

324
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,610
And, like, after the lore video, it's just like, Anyway, I love Hello Kitty.

325
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,010
And everything is okay now.

326
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,810
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

327
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,650
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

328
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,770
I rather just, like...

329
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,210
I don't know.

330
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,810
I think, like...

331
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,290
Nowadays, it's definitely much more interesting...

332
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,990
To have your lore develop in real time.

333
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,550
So that, like...

334
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,530
Instead of, like, giving you all the lore at once...

335
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,270
Um...

336
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,490
It's more so, like, you build on your lore.

337
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,170
Like, every couple of streams...

338
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,110
Like, every, like...

339
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,870
Every, like, stream or so...

340
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,250
There's, like, something new you fucking made up.

341
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,790
Or, no, actually, it's real.

342
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,450
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

343
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,090
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

344
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,170
To build up, like, bits of your lore...

345
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,730
You slowly add on to it.

346
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,850
And then...

347
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,930
It's real, though.

348
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,870
Because it's my life.

349
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,570
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

350
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,870
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

351
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,590
Community...

352
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,110
Community lore, you know?

353
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,110
And then...

354
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,830
Uh...

355
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,190
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

356
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,830
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

357
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,510
And then...

358
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,190
And after you, like...

359
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,110
And then, like, you know...

360
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,610
And it also gives these fans...

361
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,390
Like, up to interpretation for fans.

362
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,110
That they can, like, come up with stuff.

363
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,070
To...

364
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,760
Oh, wait!

365
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,280
She has a bald toggle.

366
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,640
I like how the hat is just, like...

367
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,760
Uh...

368
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,960
Defying physics right now.

369
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,760
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

370
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,340
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

371
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,420
Do you have an origin lore?

372
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm a tomato.

373
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,840
In a skin suit.

374
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,500
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

375
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,780
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

376
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,400
That's all you need to know.

377
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,420
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

378
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,080
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

379
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,120
Hey, Bree did the rigging!

380
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,900
I know her!

381
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,200
Can I take off my hat?

382
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,960
Bro, it's a fucking skin suit.

383
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,740
It's literally sewed into my skin.

384
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,060
Into my human skin.

385
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,920
Can you remember your skin?

386
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,520
Yeah, of course!

387
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,460
It's a skin suit.

388
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,380
For a reason.

389
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,730
What's a stinger?

390
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,450
It's a transition.

391
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,530
I have stingers, but I keep forgetting to use them.

392
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,250
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

393
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,570
I've just been so busy!

394
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,150
I'm sorry!

395
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:53,070
It was a gift, too, from my dragoons, but I keep forgetting to set it up!

396
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,060
People are like, wait a minute, she does!

397
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,700
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

398
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,720
Like your new PC!

399
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,920
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

400
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,720
Professional, I am.

401
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,480
I'm pretty professional.

402
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,330
I feel like the most professional you'll ever be is during your debut.

403
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,270
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

404
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:34,770
And then after all, after preparing everything for your debut, and then, like, during the debut stream, you're like, it's over.

405
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,010
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

406
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,720
Fun facts about Encore.

407
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,680
Oh, but the rest of the girls in the group.

408
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,660
I heard, like, they're, uh...

409
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,420
Well, I mean, like, they're all, like, past Vtubers that joined in.

410
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,660
But, like, Anya is, like, uh...

411
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,360
Is, like, one of the ones that had, like, a complete rehaul of the group.

412
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,740
Of everything.

413
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,500
Are those, like, INFP?

414
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,320
Are those, like...

415
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,380
Oh, that's, like, the personality test.

416
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,640
They're, like, low-key a scam.

417
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,260
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

418
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,960
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

419
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:42,740
-ha -ha!

420
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,620
You base off your entire...

421
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,240
Like, if you get...

422
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,860
See, find out your personality traits as, like, those letters.

423
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,880
And you base off your entire personality on these traits.

424
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,520
It's...

425
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,180
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

426
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,820
Ha -ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

427
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,640
I don't know.

428
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,880
I just find them a scam.

429
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,800
I don't think it's...

430
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,060
I...

431
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,100
I don't think, like...

432
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:01,940
Like...

433
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,960
Like...

434
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,940
Like, these types of letters can, like, basically describe your entire personality.

435
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,160
It's, like, how intelligent IQ tests are a scam.

436
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,520
Because IQ tests don't actually, like...

437
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,060
IQ tests that you take on the internet is a fucking scam.

438
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,460
Oh, hey, Hades, too!

439
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,590
I did, and I think it's pretty accurate.

440
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,550
I think it's because, like, it's more so of, like, biases.

441
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,770
Because it's, like, when you...

442
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,810
You know, it's, like, astrology.

443
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,090
When you see...

444
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,390
When you're, like, oh, what's my...

445
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,930
What's my zodiac sign?

446
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,210
And then you read the zodiac prediction and the personality.

447
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,870
And you're, like, wait, that's me!

448
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,390
That's how I feel, like, uh...

449
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,910
That's how I feel about, like, personality tests.

450
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,890
Like, you read the personality test.

451
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,390
And you're, like, wait, that's me!

452
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,530
Because, like, you know, you're, like, oh, that's totally me, you know?

453
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,270
It's just...

454
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,210
I feel like it's just really broad.

455
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,170
Yeah, confirmation bias.

456
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,680
There's just, like, way too many, like, statements in a personality test.

457
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,360
Like, in, like, those, like, personality tests.

458
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,120
That, like, at least one of them would match you.

459
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,820
Sounds like what a Libra would say.

460
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,710
Joke's on you.

461
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,090
I'm not a Libra.

462
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,140
Wait, has it been an hour already?

463
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,080
Wait, are the debuts 30 minutes?

464
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,380
Wait, what?

465
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,640
Wait, what?

466
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,840
Is she going to sleep?

467
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,960
There's no way it's over.

468
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,840
She's, like, at her schedule.

469
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,430
Or did she just go too fast?

470
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,180
Wait, are they actually 30 minutes?

471
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,790
She's so cool.

472
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,100
I think 30 minutes is, like, optimal.

473
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,020
I think, like, 30 to 40 minutes is a good balance.

474
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,740
Because when a debut stream is way too long, it just drags on too much.

475
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,180
And then, like, you sort of... it loses the hype IMO.

476
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,060
This is my own opinion.

477
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,160
But I think 30 to 40 minutes is, like, actually a good balance.

478
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,820
Yeah, it stops a lot of dead air, too.

479
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,200
Yeah.

480
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,840
2.0 is where you want to go, like, more...

481
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,780
Where you go more in-depth in things.

482
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,890
She's probably on a lot of energy drinks.

483
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,730
To be fair, that's really common.

484
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,450
Because a lot of people, before their debut, they're, like, so nervous.

485
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,110
And, like, they couldn't sleep and stuff like that.

486
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,330
So it makes sense that, like, you know, you have to have an energy drink on.

487
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:28,590
Like, a lot of famous VTubers had to, for their very first debut, would be, like, on a shitload of caffeine.

488
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:32,950
Wait,

489
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,930
I know how to spell crayon.

490
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,110
Oh my god, finally I'm smarter than somebody.

491
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,830
Yeah, C-R-A-Y-O-N.

492
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,770
Toki's been too real.

493
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,170
Wait, wait, why?

494
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,110
The pause.

495
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,450
The pause.

496
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,910
Why did you pause?

497
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,890
Because I'm watching a debut!

498
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,330
Like, what do you mean, why did I pause?

499
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,450
We're doing a watch-along.

500
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,570
We're fucking multitasking right now.

501
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,910
Oh shit, okay, the isolation is fucking sick, though.

502
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,470
The first pause of the whole stream.

503
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,450
Oh shit, is that the...

504
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,710
Is that the...

505
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,110
Oh, that's the...

506
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,750
The genmates.

507
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,310
That's cute.

508
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,110
The animation's really cute.

509
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,250
I love it.

510
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,200
Is her genmates a deer?

511
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,700
No, she was gonna eat a deer.

512
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,580
Actually, I was interested... I hope Anya sings more.

513
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,560
Actually, I was interested in seeing, like, her... more of her singing.

514
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,480
Since they're, like, idol.

515
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,520
You know, like, they're, like, the idol idol.

516
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,380
Uh...

517
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,980
The, uh...

518
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,380
Idol group?

519
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,980
Maybe she'll sing at the end.

520
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,800
Oh, she, like...

521
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,340
She's, like...

522
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,960
What was it called?

523
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,220
There's, like, a particular name, like, kawaii rap.

524
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,700
I swear, like, there's a name for that type of rapping.

525
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,540
Cause it's, like, a Gatmoe with the voice and the rap style.

526
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,930
I assume, like, that's, like, her rap style from the white boy rap that we heard.

527
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,190
I assume that's it.

528
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,690
Alright, let's see your cover.

529
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,790
I mean...

530
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:49,710
To be fair, I did not realize that her... the debut streams are, like, 30 minutes each.

531
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,370
Because, like...

532
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,110
Uh...

533
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,730
Idol EN paid for an hour.

534
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,030
So, you know, it's fair that I listened to your cover, too.

535
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,830
You know, you get your money's worth.

536
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,670
Guys, I don't scam people.

537
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,690
You get your money's worth.

538
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,510
Kat, thank you for the tier 1 resub for two months in a row!

539
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,170
Thank you!

540
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:09,830
Thank you!

541
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,450
Oh my gosh.

542
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,650
That ending screen.

543
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,210
Seems so familiar.

544
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,950
Is there a cover out?

545
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,270
And she did say she's gonna rate it into her cover video.

546
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,670
She did say that.

547
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,070
Alright, let's see.

548
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:28,890
Anya.

549
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:31,890
Alright.

550
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,570
Oh, yeah!

551
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,130
2.35!

552
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,310
Okay, there it is.

553
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,290
Uh...

554
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,890
If my mod can pin her cover...

555
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,710
Uh...

556
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,190
Her cover into...

557
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,970
Wait, is this, like...

558
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,610
It's a cover video.

559
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,130
My song knows what you did in the dark.

560
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,370
Wait, what...

561
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,650
What kind of song is that?

562
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,710
Wait, is this Fall Out Boy?

563
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,470
Oh, shit!

564
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,450
This is Fall Out Boy!

565
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,310
Alright.

566
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,650
Oh my god.

567
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,690
Fall Out Boy.

568
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,330
I'm not used to seeing English songs being sung by Vtubers.

569
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,550
Especially...

570
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,330
Even if they're, like, part of an EN company.

571
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,010
I'm just...

572
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,410
I'm never used to seeing that, you know?

573
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,470
Alright.

574
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,710
So, uh...

575
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,990
Can my mod pin the...

576
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,750
Uh, yeah.

577
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,950
Can you pin that, mod?

578
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,960
Is there another debut?

579
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,600
I unfortunately don't have time to watch the second and third debut.

580
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,000
Uh...

581
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,360
Because, uh...

582
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,280
Like I said, I have my own announcement later on today.

583
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,420
So, like...

584
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,000
I need to, like, set up the overlays and everything.

585
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,900
So...

586
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,020
So, unfortunately...

587
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,600
Unfortunately, I won't be able to watch the second and third.

588
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,330
Alright.

589
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,630
Because I know, like...

590
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,510
After...

591
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,790
Whoa!

592
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,550
Okay.

593
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,010
That always catches me off guard.

594
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,800
That always catches me off guard.

595
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Whenever they do the...

596
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,420
The whole...

597
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,340
Um...

598
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,860
The whole, like...

599
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,240
Like, the fucking premiere.

600
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,020
For the premiere stuff, I always choose, like, the...

601
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,320
The...

602
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,280
The quietest one.

603
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,220
Because...

604
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,700
The...

605
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,360
I don't understand.

606
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,040
I don't understand why, like, the premiere videos that you choose...

607
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,660
For your...

608
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,500
For, like...

609
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,760
That you choose, it's so fucking loud.

610
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,240
Like, the countdown stuff is actually crazy loud.

611
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,840
Um...

612
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,580
And, like...

613
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:39,860
I...

614
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,480
I always try to choose the quiet...

615
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,060
Like, the...

616
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,180
The...

617
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:42,520
The...

618
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:42,840
The...

619
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,060
The the...

620
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,980
Not -Suprising...

621
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,100
Countdowns.

622
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,020
Just because the volume balancing for these is, like, actually...

623
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,400
Terrible.

624
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,740
Like, you can't even balance it too...

625
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,120
So wake you up.

626
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,420
Yeah?

627
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,920
I mean, like...

628
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,220
The reason why I can't choose the second and third is also because, like...

629
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,180
It's also because, like...

630
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,800
Um...

631
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,360
There's, like, a delay in between debuts.

632
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,040
And, by the time the second one comes up...

633
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,000
I won't have time...

634
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,140
It was actually interesting to watch a debut again.

635
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:39,760
I have not watched a full debut, like I would watch like highlights of debuts, but I haven't watched a full debut live in a very long time.

636
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:51,060
Because I feel like a person's personality and how they are streaming wise, you don't see that in debut.

637
00:36:51,500 --> 00:37:02,940
And I like that's why like for me, like I feel like usually I just watch their other streams after their debut, just to like see what they are like as a person or like as a VTuber.

638
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,780
So it was interesting to watch again.

639
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,340
Oh, it's this song!

640
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,640
I did not know the title of this song.

641
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,740
Yeah, it's just the pilot.

642
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,270
I actually like this song.

643
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,140
She's pretty good.

644
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,160
I'm up, up, up.

645
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,380
Oh my gosh, this is like the type of song that you want to sing along to.

646
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,200
Yeah, she's really good.

647
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,640
The instrumental is really nice too.

648
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,660
I'm always so jealous of people that can sing.

649
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,800
I wish my vocal cords can do that.

650
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,520
I wish my vocal cords can do that.

651
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,780
I wish my vocal cords can do that.

652
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,080
What do you mean?

653
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,360
You guys, guys, this is just a lot of copium right now.

654
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,980
You cannot say I can sing just like this.

655
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:52,980
Yeah.

656
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,280
This is like fucking pure, like actual talent.

657
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,480
I'm up, up, up.

658
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,040
Light him up, up, up.

659
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,580
Light him up, up, up.

660
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,500
Fire.

661
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

662
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,500
Well, oh, oh, oh.

663
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

664
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

665
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,120
oh, oh, oh, oh.

666
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,610
I would love to hear more of her rapping though.

667
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,130
Because like that's her special.

668
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,330
Like, specialized.

669
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:37,970
I think it's really smart.

670
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,170
I assume the other two are-are like main singers.

671
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,810
And then they're-Anya's like the rapper of the group.

672
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,950
Which makes sense because a lot of idol groups now.

673
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,690
It's like two, like you know.

674
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,350
You have at least one rapper.

675
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,350
To do like the rap break.

676
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,500
People say I can rap, but it's just a spoken word for me.

677
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,280
I don't even know if I can actually or if people are just being nice.

678
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,280
I have no idea if I can actually rap or if people are just being nice to me.

679
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,040
She's the roller player of the trio.

680
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,180
That was fun.

681
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:41,940
That was fun.

682
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,980
I really enjoyed...

683
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,940
Like I said, it's been so long since I watched the actual debut live.

684
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,480
Not just like highlights and stuff.

685
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,460
So it was really interesting.

686
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,040
I think... I actually would love to hear more of her rapping.

687
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,560
Just because it's like her specialty.

688
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,260
But like you can tell that...

689
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,020
She has...

690
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,420
Like her vocal range is insane.

691
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,200
You can tell.

692
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,580
Just from the fact that the fucking...

693
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,160
You know, the intro video that she did.

694
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,000
The intro video that she did there.

695
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,320
Where she like fucking went from like...

696
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,140
I guess like low voice to like high pitch was like insane.

697
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,720
I was like, oh my gosh, I can't do that.

698
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,300
Yeah, the watch mojo.

699
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,000
It's interesting to see that she didn't list her...

700
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,480
Her like debut is very unconventional.

701
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,120
In a way that, you know...

702
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,880
Like usually the...

703
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,900
You know, the fucking default template is...

704
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,180
Is like, you know...

705
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,240
What was the default template?

706
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,960
Like likes, dislikes, favorite games, stuff like that.

707
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,520
Like she didn't go that route.

708
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,280
It was more so of just shitposting.

709
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,080
Which is nice to see sometimes.

710
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,840
Because...

711
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,920
I don't know.

712
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,960
As a fellow shitposter...

713
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,740
Um...

714
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,240
It's nice to see like...

715
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,740
Like someone trying to do something different.

716
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,140
Um...

717
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,220
It adds more variety.

718
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,260
You know, you just don't expect it type deal.

719
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,180
It's like, oh...

720
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,020
They do something that you don't expect.

721
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,680
So, I guess it keeps you on the toes.

722
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,080
And stuff like that.

723
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,420
Yeah, it's like...

724
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,040
Uh...

725
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah, she only puts like...

726
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,600
Yeah, but we don't know her game choices.

727
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,560
Like what is like...

728
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,600
Type of games that she might like.

729
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,100
Or like her favorite...

730
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,020
Like her favorite games.

731
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,760
Stuff like that.

732
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,680
Um...

733
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,240
I guess it's like something we find out.

734
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,180
I guess it also makes you want to watch...

735
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,820
Debut 2.0.

736
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So you can...

737
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,300
I guess it's a nice like...

738
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,060
Bait too.

739
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,920
To like bait you into watching...

740
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,340
Debut 2.0.

741
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,700
Unless it's like the newest meta.

742
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,340
Like I said, I haven't watched fucking debut streams in a long ass time.

743
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,080
But like in debut 2.0...

744
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,760
You actually like know more about the person.

745
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,560
Regarding like...

746
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,780
Their specific interests.

747
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,040
So if she...

748
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,880
Like people would be like...

749
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,140
Oh yeah.

750
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,840
Um...

751
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,180
I really liked watching her debut video.

752
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,200
But what does she actually do?

753
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,200
I guess I'll have to watch...

754
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,800
Debut 2.0.

755
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,200
To find out...

756
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,140
What her like...

757
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,000
Other interests are.

758
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,360
Um...

759
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,880
So it was pretty interesting.

760
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,480
Um...

761
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,720
Her assets are...

762
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,220
Uh...

763
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:09,640
I've...

764
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,380
Oh my god.

765
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,240
Her fucking like...

766
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,860
Live...

767
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,140
Subtitles stuff.

768
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,480
Was pretty cool.

769
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,140
But I feel like...

770
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,340
If I try to get one of those live subtitles...

771
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,280
Checking it can never translate what I'm saying.

772
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:20,980
Hahaha.

773
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:21,820
I don't know.

774
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:21,940
Haha.

775
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,380
It'll just be like...

776
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,740
70% laughing.

777
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,580
Last time...

778
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,580
That was just be like...

779
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,080
Haha.

780
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:32,800
Hahaha.

781
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,720
Yeah.

782
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,100
You have to speak like...

783
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,880
Very clearly.

784
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,260
Annunciate.

785
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:43,940
That is so...

786
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,200
True.

787
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:44,900
And...

788
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,720
We all know.

789
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,480
That is something...

790
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,560
I do not do.

791
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,380
Hahaha.

792
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,200
Haha.

793
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:50,540
Haha.

794
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:50,980
Hahaha.

795
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:51,800
Hahaha.

796
00:43:51,820 --> 00:44:06,560
We have a mush mouth for a reason, but yeah, very interesting debut so far, definitely like not the usual, the usual type of debuts you see for like the debut templates and stuff.

797
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,860
So it's always really nice to see something different.

798
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:18,780
And just to be like, you know, surprised about like what it is, like surprised and like not knowing what you're going to see next in a debut.

799
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,940
So, and she is clearly a very talented singer.

800
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,800
I think the one thing, like I said before, I think the one thing I would love to see was just more rapping, just because it's her speciality.

801
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:42,960
Like I know like the white boy rap was like a shitpost, but it was another shitpost.

802
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:48,760
But I would definitely love to see like actual, like actual rap.

803
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,760
Like rapping from her.

804
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,380
I guess we'll see it later.

805
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,580
We'll see it more of that later.

806
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,640
Since, honestly, I will not be surprised.

807
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:06,040
I will not be surprised if she has a, if the group has a debut song together.

808
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,420
But if they don't, then like, well, I was wrong.

809
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:17,760
But if they do have one, then it's like, you know, the template.

810
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,420
They're the singer group.

811
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,620
They should, I feel like.

812
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,120
I feel like they should since they're the singing group, right?

813
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,800
Like it seems like something, the debut group song meta.

814
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,860
Yeah, it's like meta now.

815
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,080
Like the debut group song.

816
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,980
Or listed the debut song of the three members.

817
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,200
Yeah.

818
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,600
Yeah.

819
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,160
So maybe we'll definitely hear more of her rapping in there since it's like singer, singer, rapper.

820
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,320
I mean, it's a very smart choice.

821
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,900
Cause like concerts make so much money.

822
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,280
I feel like concerts in general is like one of the biggest money makers for like VTubers.

823
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,760
Because like for one, it's less...

824
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,140
What's the word?

825
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:07,860
There's less of a budget going in, setting up a concert for VTubers versus setting up a concert for like real people.

826
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,900
Toki, you can't say that.

827
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,920
VTubers are just as real.

828
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,580
You're right.

829
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,800
Sorry.

830
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,260
I'm...

831
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,980
I honestly think like...

832
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,360
I think like budget cost-wise, like logistical...

833
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,880
Yeah, fewer logistical expenses.

834
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:29,460
Okay, here are some logistical expenses a VTuber concert does not have to worry about.

835
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,440
Food.

836
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,340
It's like...

837
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,340
Yeah, if it's...

838
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:37,840
Like...

839
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,460
Anyway, or like not...

840
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,120
Sorry, I meant like non-3D stuff.

841
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,380
Obviously 3D stuff.

842
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,720
Yes.

843
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,240
3D stuff.

844
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:48,500
Yes.

845
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,040
Food.

846
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:03,260
But like I feel like logistic-wise, definitely IMO like a VTuber con...

847
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,340
Like also like special effects.

848
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:10,480
You know, when you do like special effects, you know, like pyrotechnics or whatever.

849
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,420
Like when you go to like an IRL concert, all that stuff.

850
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,160
And then cleaning the stage.

851
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,820
And everything.

852
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,520
Like you don't have to worry about that because it's all on a screen.

853
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,340
And then like, you know, like fucking...

854
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,160
Oh, we need like fire coming up behind the VTuber.

855
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,120
Don't worry.

856
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,140
I got it in post.

857
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,320
Click, click, click.

858
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,160
Oh, yeah.

859
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,240
And also security.

860
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,260
You're right.

861
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,880
Explosions behind.

862
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:43,980
Don't worry.

863
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:49,200
Let me download real quick on the Unity store.

864
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,480
Insert fire gift.

865
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,600
Don't worry.

866
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Let me download a fucking fireworks on the Unity store real quick.

867
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,440
And then click and drag.

868
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,070
Yeah.

869
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,490
Thank you again.

870
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,670
Thank you again to Idle Union for sponsoring me to do an official...

871
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,290
An official watch along.

872
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,530
It was really exciting.

873
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:24,830
I know like there has been like a lot of companies are wondering, will I do more official watch alongs in the future?

874
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:25,870
It really depends.

875
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,110
I guess like the offer.

876
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,910
Idle Union was like the first one to offer to me.

877
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:38,070
So then obviously and then like obviously like I saw the amount and then because it is sponsored.

878
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,110
And I was like, yeah, fuck it.

879
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,690
I'll take it.

880
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,590
Because like I'm just giving me a lot of expenses for me.

881
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,690
In the future regarding like projects and like stuff for you guys.

882
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,550
So I was like, you know, I'll take it to reinvest in the channel.

883
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:54,470
Like giving a new new talents some publicity.

884
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,970
And then I like we all win.

885
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,110
We all win.

886
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,170
But it really depends on the offer.

887
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,370
And obviously I won't be taking all saying yes to every offer.

888
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,070
But it really depends.

889
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,230
But yes, thank you guys so much.

890
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,150
Anyway, we'll go back to prepping for my announcement stream.

891
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:21,070

892
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:24,750
