00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,450
Wait, is this...

353
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,590
No, it's just more rooms.

354
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,930
It's just more back rooms.

355
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,790
Oh my god.

356
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,750
Where are we?

357
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,070
What is that?

358
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,170
What is that?

359
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,950
What is that?

360
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,810
Oh, we have to... It's a shadow.

361
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:46,630
Wait.

362
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,410
Oh, it's a horse!

363
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,890
It's a horse!

364
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,690
It's a horse!

365
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,510
Yeah.

366
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,750
How do I...

367
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,260
Oh, yeah.

368
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,120
Yeah, yeah, okay.

369
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,760
Then what do we do with the horse?

370
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,840
I have no idea.

371
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,300
Wait.

372
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,340
Oh, it's a door!

373
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:00,980
Open the door!

374
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,180
Wait, what?

375
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,220
Did you see the silhouette?

376
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,320
But it's looking to R?

377
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
It seems that the clock...

378
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,800
Oh, wait, we need to find...

379
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,320
Wait, there's a...

380
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,740
It's a clock.

381
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
There is a clock.

382
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,180
Yeah.

383
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,340
We need to find clock hands.

384
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,640
Okay.

385
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,520
Okay, so there's a clock inside, so we need to find a clock
hand.

386
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,120
What is this?

387
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,620
So are we going to get inside this door?

388
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,800
Is it but is looking to the art?

389
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,700
What is wrong?

390
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,880
All right, we need to find clock hands.

391
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,120
Yeah.

392
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,420
All right.

393
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
So we're going to get in here, right?

394
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,440
Yeah, no, I already got in here.

395
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,920
And it's like, we're missing items.

396
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,200
Oh, okay.

397
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,920
Yeah, we're missing a clock hands.

398
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,600

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,100
Okay.

400
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,840
Guys, don't do that.

401
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,340
No, don't do that.

402
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:48,920
Hello?

403
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,020
Don't do that.

404
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,240
We're going to slowly and steady that we're not going to.

405
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,440
You're not gonna take any risk, you know?

406
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:55,780
Hello?

407
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,060
I need to mention you that you're playing with a fucking
beginner.

408
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,060
Wait a minute, I have never played this game before!

409
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,900
You've watched videos of this!

410
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,020
I haven't!

411
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,990
Okay, nothing here.

412
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,190
Dead end, dead end.

413
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:14,990
Okay.

414
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:15,850
Okay.

415
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,270
Where do we go?

416
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,290
I'm already lost.

417
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,430
Did we come here before?

418
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,950
Me too.

419
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,230
Wait, did we come here?

420
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,150
I don't know where we are.

421
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,770
Where are we?

422
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,150
I don't know too.

423
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,750
I have no sense of the direction.

424
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,490
Come on.

425
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,250
You're good at...

426
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:29,830
Oh my god.

427
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,530
You're good at the direction.

428
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,270
Everyone knows about me is that I don't know where I am.

429
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,850
This is a dead end.

430
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,590
Have we been here?

431
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,090
She's... He's dead!

432
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,210
They're dead!

433
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,150
Okay.

434
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,670
Okay.

435
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,250
Okay.

436
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,170
Well, I don't think we're...

437
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,810
I don't think we're getting out of here.

438
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:20,700
I don't think we're getting out of here.

439
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,840
How am I supposed to drink my almond milk?

440
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,160
I can't even...

441
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:31,180
How am I supposed to drink my almond milk inventory?

442
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,920

443
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,460

I can't even open my inventory!

445
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,020
Move!

446
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,920
Okay.

00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,120
Okay.

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,980
Who's that?

451
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,560
Is that you?

452
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,000

453
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,980

00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,200

It's not 1987.

522
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,860
It's not 1987.

523
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,160
It was not a swipe.

524
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,240
It was a drag.

525
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,580
I figured it out.

526
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,420

540
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,420
Oh, my God.

541
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,600

00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:55,820
Wait.

543
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,560

548
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,100

553
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,010
Why was I the one that died first?

554
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,790
Why couldn't it be me?

555
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,670
Oh my god.

556
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,930
Can you break the law?

Look, we're still in the beginning.

562
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:17,560
It wouldn't matter if I just perished because we're still in
the beginning of the level Like like does it really matter?

568
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,980
How does it matter?

569
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,800
You can revive.

570
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,460
How?

571
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,320

573
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,020

00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,840
My items?

576
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,580

577
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,880

581
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,760
I'm so fucking scared.

582
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,120
I'm so scared.

583
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,800
You son, do you hear me?

584
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,340
You need to find the door of light.

585
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,820
Follow the light, you son.

586
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,380
Follow the light so you can come back.

587
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,480
I'll wait here in the locker.

588
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,940
What do you mean?

589
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,560

00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,080
Just find the light and I'll wait here.

591
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,300

00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:29,370

You can't hear you saw cuz they're dead

598
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,330
You can't hear them because the dead can't talk.

599
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,590
That's what it means.

600
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,230
You're not supposed to ghost people.

601
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,490
There's no ghosting allowed.

602
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,090
All right.

603
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,090
Why can't I just throw the fucking vase on the ground?

604
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,570
It's a fucking vase.

605
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,180
I need to finish reading this.

606
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,280
Oh, I need a hammer.

607
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,440

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,560
What the fuck is a hammer?

609
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,440
Why can't I just throw in a fucking base?

610
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,920
It's made of glass!

611
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,760
This is so fucking dumb.

612
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,620
Oh hey, there's a head.

613
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,620
Oh my god, please.

614
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,460
You saw it.

615
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,460
Find the light!

616
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,980
Find the light!

617
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:39,880
Please!

618
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,080
Come, I swear to God, if you do not find the light right
now, I will let this monster here kill me.

619
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,800
I don't care what my fucking almond water.

620
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,120
I don't, okay, where the fuck's the monster?

621
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:53,900

I'm gonna, where the fuck is it?

623
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,020
Come over here.

624
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,120
I don't care anymore.

625
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,900
You saw would not find the light.

626
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,660
Something will come over and fucking rip me apart.

627
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,600
Oh, hey, there's more almond water that I can't use.

628
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,840
I can't even carry it.

629
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,120
I have too much albid water.

630
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,800
Something will fucking kill me.

631
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,980
There we go.

632
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,160
That's fucking right.

633
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,100
That's right.

634
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,440
You did this, you saw it.

635
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,500
Where is he?

636
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,400
Where's the stick figure guy?

637
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,780
Wait, what?

638
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,080
Hello?

639
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,220
Yeah, that's right.

640
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,280
Come on, kill me!

641
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,280
Hello?

642
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,040
Where is it?

643
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,900
What the fuck?

644
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,860
Get over here.

645
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,900
They're stuck in the wall!

646
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,820
What the fuck?

647
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,020
Oh my god, it can't even do the simple job!

648
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,460
Oh my god, it was stuck in the wall.

649
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,860
It was...

650
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,600
Get over here.

651
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,600
Get over here.

652
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,880
Okay, it's less scary when it's just smacking me in the
face.

653
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:28,000

fight are you kidding me it's like five okay well i gotta

654
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,240
find the door now

655
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,860
he's on you had five minutes to find the door All right.

656
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,160
I guess I'll find the door.

657
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,640
All right, where the fuck is the door?

658
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,400
Find the luminous door and revive.

659
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,980
You mean you had five minutes to find the fucking door and
you didn't find the fucking door?

660
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:56,720
What?

661
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,250
Okay.

662
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,350
Well, we found the fucking wheelchair.

663
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,410
And there's a teddy bear.

664
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,150
There's a radioactive door.

665
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,130
Holy shit.

666
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,850
What are all these items?

667
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,590
This is such a bad idea to play as a duo.

668
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,110
We should have been a full squad.

669
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,070
We shouldn't.

670
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,910
What?

671
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,410
I can't believe it.

672
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,650
And it was my idea to play this game, too.

673
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,110
Okay.

674
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,170
Can't you hear you suck?

675
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,810
I don't think you saw it's close to me.

676
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,410
I think you saw it's trying to find the door as well.

677
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:46,630
Wait.

678
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,650
I heard it.

679
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,230
It was shimmering.

680
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:49,930
You heard that?

681
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,110
I heard like a shimmering sound.

682
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,840
Where is it?

683
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,900
Where is it?

684
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,180
Gotta do the hard mode.

685
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,760
This is normal mode and we're fucking struggling.

686
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,180
I might even do easy mode after this.

687
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,130

00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:27,530

00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,190
This has to be the door.

00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,070
Where's you son?

It's your flashlight.

903
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:31,610
You died here.

904
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:32,850
Oh, okay.

905
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,290
I got it.

906
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,950
Oh, okay.

907
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,110
Okay.

908
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,150
Okay.

909
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,250
Okay.

910
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,830
Why are we silly?

911
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,370
I feel like I've been here like 20 times.

912
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,090
I don't know where they go.

913
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:46,570
I'm gonna.

914
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:46,930
Okay.

915
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,390
Let's be brave.

916
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,910
Okay.

917
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:49,590
For now.

918
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:50,590
I'm so brave.

919
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:51,190
Dead end.

920
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,570
where you died three times.

921
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,090
We keep coming back.

922
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,050
We keep coming back to where you died.

923
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:06,050
TV.

924
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,070
We've been here many times already.

925
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:08,970
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

926
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:11,310
We have never progressed.

927
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:14,090
We don't progress anywhere.

928
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,490
We're always going back to the same place.

929
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,290
Shut up.

930
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:18,890
I'm focusing.

931
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,350
Wait, what is this box?

932
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,310
This is yours.

933
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,870
It's also yours.

934
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,550
Oh shit, I picked up some teeth and some ears.

935
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:30,270
Okay, here.

936
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,330
Oh my god, okay.

937
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:35,630
But there's nothing here.

938
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,610
It's okay, we don't have to mind about that.

939
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,470
Now, I really want to get out of my room.

940
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:41,590
I mean, get out of this room.

941
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,350
We need to find a new world.

942
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,810
We're back to the TV!

943
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,590
We're back to the TV!

944
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:52,570
Why are we still always going back to the TV?

945
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,150
Where?

946
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,330
It's the same place.

947
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:57,970
This is the same room!

948
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:58,930
We died!

949
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,610
Same place!

950
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,470
Oh my god.

951
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,510
Never ending collab.

952
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,430
Are you ready for a long, long stream?

953
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:10,470
We're lost!

954
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:14,330
We keep going back to the same place!

955
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,230
Why did you go back to there?

956
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:17,230
Nah!

957
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:18,190
Nah!

958
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:19,490
No, my god.

959
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:23,130
We need to figure out a new place to go!

960
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:24,150
Here!

961
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:29,670
Yeah, yes, I thought you actually- I thought you're
actually- I'm pretty sure we didn't come here.

962
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:32,610
I know the Minecraft streamer is good at the sense of
directions, right?

963
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:33,970
That is not true.

964
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,190
That is absolutely- No, we've been here!

965
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,470
Oh, the red key!

966
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,330
Yeah, this is the red key door!

967
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:47,490
Let's, you know, we gotta- we better just stick around here
and don't too go far from here.

968
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:47,990
Wait.

969
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,050
Okay, if you find a painting, look at it closer.

970
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:52,350
Okay.

971
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:53,590
Alright.

972
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,470
There must be a new place we haven't gone before.

973
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,890
There has to be one new place.

974
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,770
I refuse to believe that we're...

975
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,550
We found everything.

976
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,290
We need to break the cycle.

977
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,910
Wait, we haven't gone here, I think.

978
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:14,650
You saw it.

979
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,970
You saw it.

980
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,330
This way.

981
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:15,590
Okay.

982
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:16,850
Here?

983
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,590
I think so.

984
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,890
I don't think we've been here, right?

985
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:22,570
I bet so.

986
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,090
Yeah, this looks new.

987
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,810
There's no TV here.

988
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,950
Yeah.

989
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,090
There's no TV.

990
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:29,190
This is new.

991
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:30,690
Okay.

992
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,110
No, we've opened this door before.

993
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:36,230
Yeah, yeah.

994
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,410
This is the tutorial.

995
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:38,470
This is the beginning.

996
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,290
We're back in the beginning.

997
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,290
I'm focusing.

998
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:42,690
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

999
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:43,170
Here.

1000
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:44,370
Here.

1001
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:45,430
Here.

1002
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,670
I spent 30 minutes on the tutorial.

1003
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,270
You know what?

1004
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:51,550
You shouldn't let me, you know, guide the way for you.

1005
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,490
I shouldn't be guiding the way either.

1006
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:55,130
Just as lost!

1007
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,070
I'm just as lost as you!

1008
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,350
I swear to God!

1009
00:53:58,550 --> 00:53:59,870
This is the TV room!

1010
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,250
This is the fucking TV room!

1011
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,910
It's the same room again!

1012
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,630
We're back in the TV room!

1013
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,130
We're back in the room!

1014
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,710
Why do I keep going back to...

1015
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:13,730
I really hate this game.

1016
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,170
Wait, you said...

1017
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,450
You said, come here!

1018
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,450
Come here!

1019
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,910
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1020
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,210
This side, this side.

1021
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,830
Here, here, here, here.

1022
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,950
This has to be new, right?

1023
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:27,630
I hope so.

1024
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,370
I really hope so.

1025
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,230
It's just a red key room.

1026
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,730
I swear to God.

1027
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:32,830
Okay.

1028
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:34,890
Oh my God.

1029
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:35,830
We're back in the beginning.

1030
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:36,610
We're back.

1031
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,780
We keep looping.

1032
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,500
How do we get out of this loop?

1033
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:44,960
Oh my God.

1034
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,980
We must find our way out of this loop.

1035
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,140
What is this loop?

1036
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,240
We can never be a good team.

1037
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,140
I'll tell you, Doki.

1038
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:53,880
Oh my God.

1039
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,340
No, no, no.

1040
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,280
It's not us.

1041
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:55,980
It's not us.

1042
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,680
It's the game.

1043
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,460
It's not us.

1044
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,600
You're really bad, Commander.

1045
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,500
I'm sorry.

1046
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,300
Oh, yeah?

1047
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,940
You do better.

1048
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,100
You do better.

1049
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,400
No.

1050
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,720
I found a new room.

1051
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,800
I found a new room.

1052
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,720
It's dead bodies.

1053
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,260
I'm, I'm, like, the beginner for most of the game.

1054
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,040
I found a new room.

1055
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,100
What is this?

1056
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,480
At least I didn't find a TV room five times.

1057
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,580
And so missing people were found in Paladin.

1058
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,620
Some of your bodies were found in some anomalies.

1059
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,080
Look for a VHS tape for more information.

1060
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,640
Fish.

1061
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,840
We need a VHS tape.

1062
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:29,820
Okay.

1063
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,280
Malcolm Fisher.

1064
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:33,220
Oh!

1065
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,440
Okay.

1066
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,640
I- I- oh, we- we put like- I have like body parts on me.

1067
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,300
So I think like we put like body parts on them.

1068
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,600
Got it.

1069
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,960
Like a- look at the corpses.

1070
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,340
They hide a secret code.

1071
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,160
Just pay attention to the blood.

1072
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,220
What?

1073
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,780
Pay attention to the blood.

1074
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,860
Blood type, I guess.

1075
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,200
I guess it's like heart.

1076
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,100
Oh!

1077
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:55,960
Wait!

1078
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,180
Okay, I have...

1079
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,640
Okay, the blood is...

1080
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,760
The blood, okay.

1081
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,660
Is there any blood on the leg?

1082
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,640
I have a leg.

1083
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,720
I mean, none of them are on the leg though.

1084
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,080
I have foot and...

1085
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,060
I have a foot and ear, but none of them are like...

1086
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,040
None of them have like head or ears, God.

1087

01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,820
What do you mean?

1222
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,820

01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,320
Okay, we can't touch the smoke.

1235
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:14,830
Why is it red again?

1236
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:18,930

They won't be here.

1247
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:34,420
It's gone.

1248
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,260

01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:41,780
They're gone.

1253
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:42,820
They're gone.

Get out of the base room!

1629
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:15,040
You saw it.

1630
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,580
I want to leave.

1631
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:17,600
You saw it.

1632
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,080
I want to leave that.

1633
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,620
Get out.

1634
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:24,640

01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,700
Get out of the base room.

1638
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,800

Wait.

1642
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,000
I heard something.

1643
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:42,280
Base room.

1644
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,240

1645
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,080

1646
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:50,320

1675
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,920
This is easy mode.

1676
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,260
We spent almost an hour to...

1677
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:05,420
Oh!

1678
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,500
Read note.

1679
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:09,700
Radiation room.

1680
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,640
There's a locked door.

1681
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,280
So, holy...

1682
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,260
We don't have the...

1683
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:16,320
We don't have anything to protect ourselves.

1684
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:17,020
We need the protection suits.

1685
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:17,480
Yeah, yeah.

1686
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,180
Come over here.

1687
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1688
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:20,580
Close.

1689
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,360
This is a tutorial and it's easy.

1690
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,060
Radiation.

1691
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:36,680
I didn't want to tell you until now.

1692
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,200
We've been on easy this entire time.

1693
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,160
I don't believe.

1694
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:43,960
I don't believe.

1695
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,620
We are 100% on easy.

1696
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,380
Okay, we need to figure out how to find the door.

1697
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,920
Did you see the red light?

1698
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,380
No, I didn't see that.

1699
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,020
I think there's the bug on my, you know, game screen.

1700
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,800
Here's the red light.

1701
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:06,140
No.

1702
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,440
It's not there.

1703
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:08,960
It's not there.

1704
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:09,780
It's fine.

1705
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:10,220
It's fine.

1706
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:10,980
It's fine.

1707
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:11,300
It's fine.

1708
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:12,580
Okay.

1709
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:17,130
Okay, here we're good.

1710
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:17,610
We're good.

1711
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:17,690
We're good.

1712
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:19,550
We need to find the red door.

1713
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:21,990
Okay, we're back in the body's room.

1714
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,770
This is not the door room.

1715
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,170
But I remember, like, um...

1716
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,230
The red door is just...

1717
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:30,430
Just, you know, we...

1718
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:31,610

Okay.

1745
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:27,910
The moment we find the door.

You're the one that did it.

Just to make sure.

1753
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:38,710
Yeah.

1754
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:40,630
Why do we need to spray this hallway?

1755
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:41,870
What is this hallway going to be?

1756
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:44,170
Just to make sure that we're not getting lost again.

1757
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:44,510
Okay.

01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:46,410

01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:05,750
I can't tell.

1775
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,010
Oh my god.

1776
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:25,970
you said you said find the door find the the white

1777
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:45,200
look I'm I'm not gonna say that is my fault all I'm saying
is that the locker was right there and either of us could

1778
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,540
have got it.

1779
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:54,900
It was a 50-50 in getting the door.

1780
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,920
It's not my fault.

1781
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,180
Not, you know, that was your fault.

1782
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:01,160
That was your fault.

1783
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:01,560
Are you okay?

1784
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,940
How's it my fault?

1785
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:03,460
No.

1786
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:04,060
No?

1787
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,440
I'm not okay.

1788
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,660
How is that my fault?

1789
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,500
You did it.

1790
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,500
You were the one that didn't get the door, the locker.

1791
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,980
I died four times already in this round, you know?

1792
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:15,360
Yeah!

1793
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:16,840
That's...

1794
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,640
That sucks.

1795
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,600
But that's not my fault.

1796
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:24,600
I don't think it's this way.

1797
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,140
I think...

1798
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:29,300
I think it's, like, somewhere in one of these corridors.

1799
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,180
Maybe this one?

1800
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:31,760
Okay.

1801
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,180
No, this is the body one.

1802
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,500
This is the body.

1803
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,280
Maybe this one?

1804
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,040

You always know where the door is.

1926
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,100
We should have followed you.

1927
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,840
I should have believed myself.

1928
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,320
You should have believed yourself.

1929
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:46,360
Okay, they said, look at the painting.

1930
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,500
There might be a code.

They said the painting has a code inside.

1932
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,720

Did it open?

3028
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:46,360

The paper must be radiated too.

3036
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:04,620
I sprayed everything I swear to God.

3037
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:05,260
Okay.

3038
02:40:06,260 --> 02:40:06,480

Oh, three items!

3042
02:40:15,270 --> 02:40:15,690
Three more!

3043
02:40:16,230 --> 02:40:16,450
Okay.

02:40:17,490 --> 02:40:18,450

02:40:19,770 --> 02:40:21,250
Oh, let's see, let's see.

3046
02:40:23,410 --> 02:40:24,050
Okay.

3047
02:40:24,590 --> 02:40:25,830
No, still three more.

3048
02:40:27,450 --> 02:40:28,090
Okay.

3049
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:34,880
Spray everything.

3050
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:38,200
Do the lockers get radiated?

3051
02:40:42,430 --> 02:40:43,590
Oh my god.

3052
02:40:45,850 --> 02:40:47,030
Spray everything.

3053
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:47,570
Yeah.

3054
02:40:47,870 --> 02:40:48,510
I bet.

3055
02:40:50,490 --> 02:40:51,130
Okay.

3056
02:40:51,550 --> 02:40:52,210
Three more.

3057
02:40:52,310 --> 02:40:53,070
Still three more.

3058
02:40:53,370 --> 02:40:54,190
What about now?

3059
02:40:55,570 --> 02:40:57,910
Uh, two, two more, two more, two more, two more.

3060
02:40:58,590 --> 02:41:00,410
Where is the last two?

3061
02:41:05,230 --> 02:41:19,510
I swear to god I swear to fucking god Two more I found one I
did it!

3062
02:41:19,890 --> 02:41:21,650
I did it!

3063
02:41:21,710 --> 02:41:22,590
Spring every city!

3064
02:41:22,690 --> 02:41:23,430
Let's go!

3065
02:41:25,610 --> 02:41:26,910
Let's go!

3066
02:41:28,590 --> 02:41:30,110
Why is this so hard?

3067
02:41:30,690 --> 02:41:32,030
We did it!

3068
02:41:32,230 --> 02:41:33,930
Why is this so hard?

3069
02:41:34,190 --> 02:41:37,530
Alright, there's a creature that wanders aimlessly on some
backroom zones.

3070
02:41:37,670 --> 02:41:40,270
It seems to have no conscience but until it's hungry.

3071
02:41:40,710 --> 02:41:42,950
At which point it becomes aggressive.

3072
02:41:43,370 --> 02:41:45,250
Venus looks for the closest subject to eat.

3073
02:41:45,390 --> 02:41:48,470
It distinguishes from other creatures that looks to skin its
victims.

3074
02:41:48,630 --> 02:41:49,490
Oh, okay.

3075
02:41:49,950 --> 02:41:50,930
And seal their skin.

3076
02:41:51,030 --> 02:41:53,490
It's reasoning that he can spell blood over long distance.

3077
02:41:54,030 --> 02:41:54,770
Oh, shit.

3078
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:55,550
Okay.

3079
02:41:57,310 --> 02:41:58,390
Did you get it?

3080
02:41:58,590 --> 02:41:59,930
Yeah, I did.

3081
02:42:00,650 --> 02:42:02,570
But, like, the next...

3082
02:42:02,570 --> 02:42:03,110
How do we open?

3083
02:42:03,310 --> 02:42:04,190
Oh, I did it.

3084
02:42:05,350 --> 02:42:06,270
Oh, my God.

3085
02:42:06,490 --> 02:42:06,750
Okay.

3086
02:42:06,990 --> 02:42:07,550
Oh, my God.

3087
02:42:07,810 --> 02:42:08,510
There is a progress.

3088
02:42:09,190 --> 02:42:09,730
We're doing...

3089
02:42:09,730 --> 02:42:10,890
I think we're doing fine.

3090
02:42:11,230 --> 02:42:11,390
No?

3091
02:42:11,570 --> 02:42:12,550
Oh, my God.

3092
02:42:12,830 --> 02:42:14,570
We're doing so well.

3093
02:42:15,290 --> 02:42:16,410
Yeah, we're going well.

3094
02:42:17,390 --> 02:42:18,450
Oh, my God.

3095
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:19,390
Oh.

3096
02:42:20,630 --> 02:42:20,930
Oh.

3097
02:42:21,690 --> 02:42:22,290
Oh.

3098
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:23,130
Oh.

3099
02:42:23,490 --> 02:42:24,090
Okay.

3100
02:42:24,930 --> 02:42:25,530
Okay.

3101
02:42:26,690 --> 02:42:28,570
I'm a little worried, though.

3102
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:28,990
Down?

3103
02:42:29,370 --> 02:42:30,970
Wait, are we gonna die if we go down?

3104
02:42:31,610 --> 02:42:32,710
I don't know.

3105
02:42:34,530 --> 02:42:35,690
No, don't do that.

3106
02:42:35,830 --> 02:42:36,330
Don't do that.

3107
02:42:37,710 --> 02:42:38,530
Wait, it's locked.

3108
02:42:40,410 --> 02:42:42,290
How do we... Wait, wait.

3109
02:42:43,410 --> 02:42:43,810
Wait.

3110
02:42:44,470 --> 02:42:45,310
Where are we going?

3111
02:42:45,310 --> 02:42:45,690
Where are we going?

3112
02:42:46,390 --> 02:42:49,010
Well, I guess we go down.

3113
02:42:49,750 --> 02:42:50,850
Okay, let's go.

3114
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:55,730
Did they die?

3115
02:42:59,430 --> 02:43:00,430
Now what?

3116
02:43:01,430 --> 02:43:02,450
We did it!

3117
02:43:02,450 --> 02:43:03,490
We beat the level!

3118
02:43:04,670 --> 02:43:05,890
We did it!

3119
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:06,790
You saw me!

3120
02:43:07,030 --> 02:43:08,490
We did it!

3121
02:43:08,730 --> 02:43:09,170
No!

3122
02:43:09,810 --> 02:43:10,090
Yeah!

3123
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:13,070
And this is where we call it.

3124
02:43:15,970 --> 02:43:16,530
Okay.

3125
02:43:17,090 --> 02:43:17,830
Now what?

3126
02:43:18,010 --> 02:43:18,510
Now what?

3127
02:43:18,590 --> 02:43:21,570
This is where we end the game.

3128
02:43:22,330 --> 02:43:22,810
The game?

3129
02:43:24,090 --> 02:43:24,510
Okay.

3130
02:43:24,890 --> 02:43:25,290
You know what?

3131
02:43:25,490 --> 02:43:26,610
I think it's fine.

3132
02:43:26,790 --> 02:43:28,530
I think we did really well.

3133
02:43:28,650 --> 02:43:30,170
I think you know we- I think so.

3134
02:43:30,350 --> 02:43:30,630
Yeah.

3135
02:43:31,210 --> 02:43:34,970
We spent two hours of stream and there are a lot of
progress.

3136
02:43:35,930 --> 02:43:37,950
Yeah, we make so much progress.

3137
02:43:38,110 --> 02:43:40,410
You know, yeah, we did.

3138
02:43:40,730 --> 02:43:41,070
Yeah.

3139
02:43:41,310 --> 02:43:42,010
We did us a lot.

3140
02:43:42,010 --> 02:43:46,810
I don't think we don't have to do everything if we, you
know, enjoy the game.

3141
02:43:47,010 --> 02:43:47,470
You know what?

3142
02:43:49,610 --> 02:43:50,870
I'm proud of myself.

3143
02:43:51,210 --> 02:43:52,890
You know, I'm proud of ourselves too.

3144
02:43:52,950 --> 02:43:53,990
We did so well.

3145
02:43:54,250 --> 02:43:55,690
We did so well.

3146
02:43:56,210 --> 02:44:00,970
We might have got stuck a lot, but you know what?

3147
02:44:01,210 --> 02:44:03,890
We did so well on easy.

3148
02:44:04,490 --> 02:44:05,470
We did so.

3149
02:44:08,430 --> 02:44:13,270
Even though it was easy mode, we were pretty good at this
game, right?

3150
02:44:13,770 --> 02:44:15,290
I don't believe that it was easy mode.

3151
02:44:15,810 --> 02:44:17,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3152
02:44:17,490 --> 02:44:18,970
Yeah, guys, I was joking.

3153
02:44:19,070 --> 02:44:21,450
When I said it was easy, I meant hard.

3154
02:44:21,810 --> 02:44:24,650
We were definitely on hard mode, guys.

3155
02:44:25,610 --> 02:44:28,270
Yeah, you saw me.

3156
02:44:28,290 --> 02:44:28,770
Don't believe that.

3157
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:30,170
That was a hard mode, okay, chat.

Just for fucking promotion, I sacrificed too much for
myself.

3166
02:45:38,350 --> 02:45:40,850
I killed so much brain cell for this.

3167
02:45:41,150 --> 02:45:41,870
But you know what?

action i think like og the og one with the mask is my

3202
02:48:33,740 --> 02:48:38,900
favorite oh wait sorry that's sound wave I thought I said
sound wave.

3203
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:41,300
I thought you said sound wave, not shock wave.

3204
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:42,220
Shock wave?

3205
02:48:42,340 --> 02:48:49,360
I don't really care much about shock wave's design because
like shock wave wasn't really my favorite transformer.

3206
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:56,160
I liked sound wave more than shock wave because like sound
wave was like a fucking DJ.

3207
02:48:57,340 --> 02:49:02,800
So like for me shock wave, I don't really care too much
about their design.

3208
02:49:03,280 --> 02:49:08,800
But if I had to pick, Prime, I think.

3209
02:49:08,860 --> 02:49:11,060
I think Shockwave Prime was a nice design.

3210
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:12,280

Howie Doki just got home from driving in the snowstorm and
had your stream playing in the background.

3301
02:52:40,670 --> 02:52:42,110
Let's focus on the road, of course.

3302
02:52:42,470 --> 02:52:43,510

02:52:57,930 --> 02:53:00,070
Before the stream, I was, like, super tired, too.

3310
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:03,410
I feel like every time I'm not streaming, I'm just very
tired.

3311
02:53:03,450 --> 02:53:07,670
I was, like, so tired, like, physically and mentally.

3312
02:53:08,730 --> 02:53:10,650
And so I was just, like, oh, man.

3313
02:53:10,670 --> 02:53:12,750
Man, I hope I'll be able to stream.

3314
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:14,010
I feel so tired.

3315
02:53:14,190 --> 02:53:17,990
Every time I turn on the stream, I just go like 100%.

3316
