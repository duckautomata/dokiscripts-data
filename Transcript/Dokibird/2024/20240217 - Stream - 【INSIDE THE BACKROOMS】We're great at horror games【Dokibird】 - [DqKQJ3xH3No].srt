00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,680
Hello, hello!

3
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,280
Feels sorta like deja vu.

4
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,120
Look at this tiny little guy right here.

5
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,900
Silence, you are tiny.

6
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,640
What do you mean?

7
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,640
Look at you, you saw.

8
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,160
Look at this little baby.

9
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,440
Look at this little baby.

10
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,380
You know what?

11
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,100
No, you should be tiny.

12
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,500
What do you mean shrunk for me?

13
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,260
That's your real size.

14
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,340
That's your real size.

15
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,500
What do you mean?

16
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,760
Oh, you sound quiet.

17
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,740
Okay, let me raise you a little bit higher.

18
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,500
Is this better guys?

19
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,120
Sorry, we're using in-game mic, so like...

20
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,020
Yeah, so I have to like lower the game volume.

21
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,880
Wait, you scared?

22
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,080
What do you mean?

23
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,780
No, because the game volume will be louder than you.

24
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,680
What do you mean?

25
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,420
Yeah, to be really honest, I don't really hear your voice too.

26
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,380
Yeah, you have to lower the in-game volume so you can hear me.

27
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,380
I have you all the way up on voice though.

28
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,520
Is this better guys?

29
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Let me know if this is better.

30
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,940
I'm gonna... I can turn...

31
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,700
Oh, I can lower the music volume.

32
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,320
That's awesome.

33
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,280
Yeah, yeah, we can lower like all the game stuff and then... Oh, nice.

34
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,400
That's nice for me.

35
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,480
That's way better for me.

36
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,140
Awesome.

37

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,680
A bit louder.

40
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,980
Okay, eat your mic.

41
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,860
Eat your mic.

42
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,260
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm just gonna increase my mic game.

43
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,900
What do you mean?

45
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,960
What will be?

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,860
Do I need to increase mine?

47
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,660
Ah ah ah ah ah ah.

48
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,520

49
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,020
A bit louder?

50
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,800
A bit more?

51
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,600
Okay, I'll... I'll... I'll increase...

52
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,240
Oh God, I'm gonna like... When you start screaming, that's when I'm scared.

53
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,940
I'm just gonna try my best not to scream.

54
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,160
In a horror game?

55
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,260
I don't want to do any dramatic scream.

56
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,140
Yeah, yeah, because you're known to not scream.

57
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,440
Yeah, then, you know...

58
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,140
I want to focus on controlling my sanity today.

59
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,180
Oh...

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,920
Entertaining dramatic scream.

61
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,320
You know what I mean?

62
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,760

I'm always loud.

72
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,360

So I've never played this game before.

160
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,020
I don't think Yusan you've played this game before, right?

161
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,540
Where are we?

162
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,940
Oh shit.

163
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,220
Yusan can't hear me.

164
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,400
What the fuck?

165
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,800
I just realized.

166
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,940
Yusan can't even hear me.

167
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,160
Where?

168
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,380
Yusan's talking to themselves right now.

169
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,810
Oh my god.

170
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,030

I'm so scared.

181
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,110
Oh my god.

182
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,270
What do you mean?

183
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,050
You're way much scarier than I am.

185
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,050
I look like a homeless person.

186
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,530
I look like a homeless person.

187
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,770

How do I say that?

210
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,690
Bring your attention to something else.

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,470
So you don't have to you know.

212
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,450

As long as we're together.

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,490
Nothing bad can happen to us right?

224
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,110
Oh wait.

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,790
That's what chat's for.

306
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,950
Seven.

307
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,050

308
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,290

Okay.

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,270
Four.

313
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,150
Four seven one one three eight.

314
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,030
Four.

315
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,790
Two nine.

316
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,070
Seven one one.

317
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,070
So some numbers are missing.

318
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,090
What?

319
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,270
Some numbers are missing there.

320
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,570
There's numbers missing?

321
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,810
I'm so confused.

322
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,310
Me too.

323
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,630
Uhhhh.

324
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,930
I'm so.

325
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,570
No.

326
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,410
Why is there a puzzle?

327
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,830
Why is there?

328
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,130
I have no idea.

329
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,990
Why did they make a puzzle?

330
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,870
Anyway.

331
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,230
Look around.

332
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,070
Wait I see so many people pressing.

333
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,610
Telling me to press these numbers.

334
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,710
Okay.

335
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,450
Don't worry.

336
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,270
Chat is backseating you.

337
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,970
Wait but it's not working.

338
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,610
What do they mean?

339
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,410
Seven.

340
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,570
Four.

341
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,870
Oh no I already lost.

342
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,030
Wait are you cheating right now?

343
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,090
No I'm not cheating.

344
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,970
No no no.

345
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,910
This is a stream.

346
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,410
What do you mean wow?

347
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,370
What do you mean?

348
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,450
What awesome professional gamer behavior.

349
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,610
You're okay.

350
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,310
Gamers always ask chat for help.

351
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,730
The big.

352
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,290
I am very mature and I am willing to ask for help.

353
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,630
I am willing to ask for help.

354
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,570
That's when you know I am a gamer.

355
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,410
Okay.

356
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:56,730
So I'm going to press the nine.

357
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,410
One.

358
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,550
I am so disappointed on this.

359
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,710
Okay.

360
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,010
What do the numbers mean?

361
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,530
Don't do that.

362
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,330
Okay then you solve this.

363
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,410
You're so smart.

364
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,350
Yeah?

365
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,030
Do it.

366
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:13,790
Solve it.

367
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,470
So I say that some numbers are missing here.

368
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,290
Like which one?

369
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,690
So five.

370
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,590
So far I know five is missing.

371
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,550
Why do you know five?

372
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,050
Oh okay.

373
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:26,950
There's no five.

374
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,570
There's no six.

375
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,130
Yeah.

376
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,830
Zero?

377
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,710
Do we have zero in the...

378
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,250
No it's only one.

379
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,950
Why would there be a floor zero on an elevator?

380
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:39,770
You son.

381
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,230
Where the fuck is floor zero?

382
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,450
What is...

383
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,410
Zero doesn't exist.

384
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,010
You know yeah I'm just thinking something more logical.

385
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,270
How is zero as an elevator number logical?

386
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,490
Floor B!

387
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,790
Come on you know.

388
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,570
This is something.

389
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,610
This is the teamwork.

390
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,310
Yeah.

391
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,070
We're gonna help each other to solve it.

392
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,310
My teamwork is getting chat to help.

393
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,990
Come on yeah.

394
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:13,590
Let's focus.

395
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,770
So five, six.

396
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,670
Okay zero.

397
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,330
No zero.

398
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:17,970
Okay no zero.

399
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,890
There's no five.

400
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,870
There's no six.

401
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,130
Okay I'll type that in.

402
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,450
Wait okay.

403
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,230
Five, six, three.

404
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,210
Three.

405
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,930
What's the last one?

406
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,990
Seven?

407
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,010
No there was a seven wasn't there?

408
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:33,810
It's not this.

409
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,570
Eight.

410
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,090
Oh no there's eight.

411
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,110
Seven there is yeah.

412
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,590
It's seven one nine eight.

413
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,410
Why is it seven one one?

414
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,770
Why is it seven one nine eight?

415
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,110
Seven one nine eight.

416
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,110
It was not seven one nine eight.

417
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,930
Who said that bad in this person?

418
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,190
This is the reason why you shouldn't trust in chat.

419
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,470
And it's your own mistake.

420
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,030
Okay?

421
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:00,690
Yeah.

422
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,870
Wait look at that.

423
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,410
There is B.

424
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,670
Wait there is B.

425
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,250
Yeah but I can't press B.

426
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,850
Look at that.

427
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,390
There is zero.

428
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:08,950
Look at that.

429
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:09,490
Zero.

430
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,830
B is a letter.

431
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,610
B is a letter.

432
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,030
B is a letter.

433
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,330
Zero is a number.

434
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,290
Zero is a number.

435
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,650
Zero is a number.

436
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,610
B is a letter.

437
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,330
Basement is basement.

438
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,730
But who is the one that's roasting me for pointing out the number zero?

439
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,370
It's basement one two three four five.

440
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,710
Because no one puts basement as a zero.

441
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,950
Everyone puts basement as basement.

442
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,770
I'm not talking about that.

443
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,870
It's basement one two three four five six seven eight.

444
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,590
Or G ground level.

445
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,250
One two three four five six seven eight.

446
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,390
I'm not talking like that.

447
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,330
Come on.

448
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,210
This is teamwork.

449
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,210
Listen.

450
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,010
Okay?

451
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,090
This is teamwork.

452
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,310
I'm educating you on elevators.

453
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,110
I'm trying to educate you.

454
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,970
I'm trying to educate you on elevators.

455
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,850
Chad help.

456
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,490
Chad help.

457
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,510
Look it's basement lobby.

458
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,330
One two three four five six seven eight.

459
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,330
Wait why is it 1987?

460
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,390
Where did you get 1987 from?

461
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,650
I'm pointing out the thing to solve the puzzle.

462
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:12,950
I'm pointing out the thing to solve the puzzle.

463
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,390
But she decided to roast me.

464
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,510
But she decided to roast me.

465
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,290
What the hell?

466
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,330
Okay.

467
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,710
Why is it 1987?

468
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,670
Explain.

469
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,710
1987?

470
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,690
On the roll call?

471
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,170
Okay.

472
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,030
1987.

473
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,050
Nineteen...

474
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,450
Nineteen...

475
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,950
Eighty-seven.

476
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,710
Oh my god we did it!

477
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:34,890
I told you!

478
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,350
I'm not happy with it.

479
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,110
I'm not happy with it.

480
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,510
I'm not happy with it.

481
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,910
We did it guys!

482
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,610
We're so smart.

483
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,310
We're so fucking smart.

484
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,590
This is so questionable.

485
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,030
I am not.

486
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,110
Oh my god.

487
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,110
This is the fight of 87.

488
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,690
We will never know why.

489
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,550
We will never know why that was the correct answer.

490
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,010
But it worked.

491
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,410
It worked.

492
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:02,710
It worked.

493
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,530
That's all that matters.

494
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,810
It worked.

495
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,030
I don't like this.

496
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,890
It's getting darker now.

497
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,510
We go this way.

498
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,150
Okay.

499
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,110
Did you hear that?

500
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,530
As long as we're together nothing bad can happen.

501
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,670
Wait what's this?

502
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,350
Water.

503
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,130
Almond water.

504
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,070
It can save you so make sure you watch your stamina.

505
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,130
It can save you.

506
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,370
What's this?

507
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,170
Wait.

508
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,030
That's a new spot.

509
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,070
It resembles a dog due to the fact that no one has managed to photo.

510
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:37,470
Oh.

511
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,550
Amber.

512
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,630
It also is known and is terminated by direct eye contact.

513
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,850
It also is known and is terminated by direct eye contact.

514
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,770
I was roasting you.

515
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:47,570
Wait.

516
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,650
Wait.

517
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,630
It's scared.

518
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,790
It doesn't like noise.

519
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,850
It says it doesn't like noise.

520
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,850
No I didn't hear that noise.

521
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,510
There's no noise.

522
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,570
Let's move.

523
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,390
I'm following you.

524
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,390
Wait does it like whistles?

525
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,750
Stop it.

526
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,510
Good boy.

527
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,730
Where is he?

528
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,330
Oh.

529
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:22,810
No.

530
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,610
What is that?

531
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,030
It's a locker.

532
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:27,850
Okay.

533
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,650
What the fuck is that?

534
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,870
So whenever I found an enemy.

535
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,950
Whenever I encountered an enemy.

536
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,190
We can just be here.

537
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,850
Oh my god.

538
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,990
Your head is...

539
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,370
Wait why is it right outside?

540
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,970
Get out.

541
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,670
I heard something.

542
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,550
What do you hear?

543
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,330
Hello?

544
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,910
I heard.

545
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,890
I heard that I see.

546
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,750
There's only one locker.

547
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,590
Come over here.

548
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:01,890
Wait.

549
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,840
Please.

550
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,500
Please.

551
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,720
Get out.

552
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,140
What a dialogue.

553
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,230
I don't like this collab.

554
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,510
What do you mean?

555
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,710
Are you having fun?

556
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,490
I'm having so much fun.

557
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,430
Wait.

558
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,770
We found a room.

559
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,250
No.

560
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,510
It's just more rooms.

561
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,690
It's just more back rooms.

562
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,590
Oh my god.

563
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,450
Where are we?

564
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,430
Wait.

565
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:39,930
What is that?

566
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,950
What is that?

567
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,570
It's a shadow.

568
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,290
Oh it's a horse.

569
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:47,790
It's a horse.

570
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,090
How do I?

571
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,080
Oh yeah.

572
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,100
Easy.

573
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,540
Then what do we do with the horse?

574
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,620
I have no idea.

575
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,140
Wait.

576
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,040
Oh it's a door.

577
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,300
It's a door.

578
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,840
Open the door.

579
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,020
Wait what?

580
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,140
It's looking to R.

581
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,660
It seems that the clock...

582
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,760
Oh wait we need to find...

583
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,660
Wait there's a... It's a clock.

584
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,460
There is a clock.

585
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,020
Yeah.

586
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,060
We need to find clock hands.

587
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,520
Okay.

588
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,520
Okay so there's a clock inside so we need to find a clock hand.

589
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,500
Okay so...

590
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,420
Are we gonna get inside this door?

591
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,520
R?

592
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,480
What is wrong?

593
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,680
Alright we need to find...

594
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,600
We need to find clock hands.

595
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,840
Yeah.

596
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,540
So we're gonna get in here right?

597
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,300
No I already got in here and it's like...

598
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,580
We're missing items.

599
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,060
Oh okay.

600
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,620
Yeah we're missing a clock hands.

601
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,220
Okay.

602
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,660
Guys don't do that.

603
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,280
No.

604
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,180
Don't do that.

605
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:48,800
Hello?

606
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,900
Don't do that.

607
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,620
We're not gonna take any risk.

608
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,180
You know?

609
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,540
Hello?

610
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,800
I need to mention you that you're playing with a fucking beginner.

611
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,980
Wait I have never played this game before.

612
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,780
You've watched videos of this.

613
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,580
I haven't.

614
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,770
Nothing here.

615
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,550
Dead end.

616
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:13,950
Dead end.

617
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,270
Okay.

618
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,710
Okay.

619
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,090
Where do we go?

620
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,010
I'm already lost.

621
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,290
Did we come here before?

622
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:20,690
Me too.

623
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,170
Wait did we come here?

624
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,070
I don't know where we are.

625
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,850
I don't know too.

626
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,430
I have no sense of direction.

627
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,730
Come on you're good at... Oh my god.

628
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,350
No no.

629
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,990
What everyone knows about me is that I don't know where I am.

630
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,650
This is a dead end.

631
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,270
Have we been here?

632
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,050
She's...

633
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,050
They're dead!

634
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:45,770
They're dead!

635
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,910
Ah!

636
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,150
Ah!

637
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,290
Okay.

638
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,410
Okay.

639
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,110
Okay.

640
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:02,450
Okay.

641
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,090
Well I don't think we're...

642
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,170
I don't...

643
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,370
I don't...

644
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,470
I don't think we're getting out of here.

645
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,230
I don't think we're getting out of here.

646
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,560
How am I supposed to drink my almond milk?

647
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,060
I can't even...

648
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,400
I...

649
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,880
How am I supposed to drink my almond milk?

650
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,860
Vintori!

651
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,140
Vintori!

652
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,660
Didn't think

653
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,340
I...

654
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,140
I can't even open my inventory.

655
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,280
How do I move?!

656
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,580
How do I move?!

657
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,760
Okay...

658
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,480
Smells like...

659
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,900
Who's that?

660
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,340
Is that you?

661
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,420
Who's that?

662
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:06,420
Is that you?

663
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:06,800
Is that you?

664
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,840
Oh my god!

665
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,000
That's Yusa!

666
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,500
Oh, we're so fucked.

667
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,600
We're so fucked.

668
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,800
Yusa, where are you going?

669
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,400
Yusa, where did you go?

670
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,720
Where did Yusa's shadow go?

671
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm so scared!

672
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,480
Oh my god, where do I...

673
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,260
Leave me alone!

674
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,060
Yusa!

675
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,700
Look for the flashlight!

676
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,520
If you can hear me right now!

677
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,600
Yusa!

678
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,160
Look for the flashlight!

679
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,080
Look for the flashlight!

680
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,320
And lead me to the flashlight!

681
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,960
Oh god.

682
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm so fucked.

683
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,060
You know what, what if I just die?

684
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,580
You know what?

685
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,620
Come over here.

686
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,540
What if I don't want to do this alone anymore?

687
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,800
What if I just die?

688
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,040
Yusa, did you find the flashlight?

689
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,560
Where is it?

690
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,520
Where's your shadow?

691
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,530
Where's the shadow?

692
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,090
Where's Yusa's shadow?

693
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,330
There's the shadow.

694
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,290
It's not me!

695
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,010
Okay, here.

696
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,610
You see that?

697
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,450
You see this box?

698
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:48,910
Yeah.

699
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,070
Yeah, open that.

700
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,270
No, not the locker!

701
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,170
No, don't get... Get out of the locker!

702
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:57,930
Be brave!

703
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,290
No!

704
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,670
You said open it!

705
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,010
You sacrificed your face!

706
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,210
Where are you going?

707
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,410
Where are you?

708
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,210
Here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here.

709
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,190
Where is here?

710
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,090
Yeah?

711
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,070
What's the password?

712
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,310
Oh, Yusa.

713
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,530
Where are you?

714
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,110
Where did you go?

715
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,810
Oh, there's your shadow.

716
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,190
Okay.

717
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,370
Oh, I found more meds.

718
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,050
And almond water.

719
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,190
Okay.

720
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,510
But like, what's the code?

721
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,530
How do I...

722
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,010
What's the code?

723
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,350
How do I...

724
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,550
Okay.

725
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,130
I can't... I can't switch...

726
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,950
How do...

727
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,460
Wait.

728
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,520
How do I move?

729
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,340
How do I move that?

730
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,080
Okay.

731
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,840
Nineteen...

732
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,140
Eighty-seven...

733
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,760
Who opened the door?

734
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,240
Please.

735
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,020
Please.

736
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,360
Please!

737
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,680
Oh, it's a drag!

738
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,280
Okay, I figured it out.

739
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,740
It's not 1987.

740
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,440
It's not 1987.

741
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,960
It was not a swipe.

742
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,000
It was a drag.

743
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,300
I figured it out.

744
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:30,960
I figured it out.

745
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,960
It's not 1987!

746
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,060
Oh my God.

747
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,760
It was not the bite of 87, guys.

748
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,920
We figured it out.

749
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,480
It was not the bite of 87.

750
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,200
Oh my God.

751
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,600
Wait.

752
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,720
We'll close the...

753
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,120
Oh, boy.

754
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,820
Fuck you.

755
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,820
Fuck you.

756
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,020
We'll never figure this out.

757
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,400
Okay, but if we close the door...

758
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,500
Maybe, like, nothing will hurt me.

759
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,660
Okay.

760
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,360
The drag of 87.

761
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,500
I was panicking!

762
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,480
Okay.

763
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,420
Okay.

764
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,860
Okay.

765
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,300
We'll never figure out why this is...

766
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,740
Why...

767
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,920
How to get the right answer.

768
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,580
Oh my God.

769
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,740
Why would it be 1983?

770
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,780
What happened in 1983?

771
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,420
I still don't know how we got 1987 from the last quarter.

772
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,220
What if I...

773
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,080
I still don't know how we got that.

774
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,540
I still...

775
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,280
Oh, wait.

776
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,680
Maybe it is 1987.

777
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,120
And I just need to...

778
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,580
Wait.

779
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,200
Maybe it is.

780
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,680
I just need...

781
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,260
No, it's not.

782
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,820
It's not.

783
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,140
Oh my God.

784
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,380
It's another bite.

785
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,660
Wait.

786
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,060
Yusa, where did you go?

787
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,060
I don't know.

788
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,400
I don't know.

789
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,360
Wait.

790
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,380
Time nobody give me.

791
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,320
We'll never figure it out.

792
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,840
Yusa, where are you?

793
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,820
Yusa!

794
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,150
Where they go?

795
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,030
Where they...

796
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,170
Yusa, please?

797
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,610
Why was I the one that died first?

798
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,290
Why couldn't it be me?

799
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,450
Oh my God.

800
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,030
Push the door then...

801
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,890
Can you break the lock?

802
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,810
Okay, if I could break the lock I would have just thrown the fucking box down right now.

803
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,730
We need lockpick master here.

804
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,860
Who's that?

805
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,220
Hello?

806
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,880
Oh, it's the stick figure guy.

807
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,960
It's him again.

808
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,380
Okay, someone call MatPat.

809
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,560
Oh my god.

810
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,500
Okay, but what if I just die?

811
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,140
Look, we're still in the beginning.

812
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,660
It wouldn't matter if I just perished.

813
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
Because we're still in the beginning of the level.

814
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,960
Like, does it really matter?

815
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,160
Does it really matter?

816
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,760
Maybe he'll open it.

817
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,660
Okay.

818
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,940
Alright, you know what?

819
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,820
I'm gonna... you know what?

820
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,640
I'm gonna do it.

821
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,880
It wouldn't fucking matter.

822
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,940
It wouldn't... it wouldn't matter.

823
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,660
How does it matter?

824
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,220
You can revive... how?

825
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,000
Where can I revive them?

826
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,300
Oh my god.

827
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,840
Where do I revive them?

828
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,760
I have just Almond Water.

829
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,700
Oh my god.

830
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,380
Oh no.

831
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,060
My Almond Water.

832
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,160
I'm so fucking scared.

833
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm so scared.

834
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,540
Yu-san, do you hear me?

835
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,040
You need to find the Door of Light.

836
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,480
Follow the light, Yu-san.

837
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,260
Follow the light.

838
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,980
So you can come back.

839
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,300
I'll wait here in the locker.

840
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,140
What do you mean no?

841
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,860
Just find the light and I'll wait here.

842
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,920
Find the light and come back here.

843
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,760
Alright.

844
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,380
Don't worry.

845
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,020
Yu-san, find the light.

846
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,960
I can stay in the...

847
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,620
I don't think I can stay in the locker.

848
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,760
Yu-san?

849
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,590
Yu-san?

850
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,870
So many fucking lockers, man.

851
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,330
Why is there... maybe this can be broken with something?

852
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,470
A fucking screwdriver?

853
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,110
No, screwdrivers can't...

854
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,970
Okay, maybe this is a bad idea to play with two people.

855
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,250
I just realized.

856
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,590
Maybe that's a fucking bad...

857
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,370
Who's that?

858
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,670
Who's that?

859
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,270
Who's that?

860
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,050
Oh my god.

861
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,990
What the fuck was that?

862
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,170
You can't hear Yu-san?

863
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,590
Because they're dead!

864
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,090
You can't hear them because the dead can't talk!

865
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,330
That's what it means.

866
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,930
You're not supposed to ghost people.

867
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,010
There's no ghosting allowed.

868
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:53,850
Alright.

869
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,890
Why can't I just throw the fucking...

870
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,970
The vase on the ground?

871
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,170
It's a fucking vase!

872
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,960
I need to finish reading this.

873
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,160
Oh, I need a hammer.

874
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,300
Where the fuck is the hammer?

875
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,260
Why can't I just throw the fucking vase?

876
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,340
It's made of glass!

877
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,060
This is so fucking dumb.

878
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,420
Oh hey, there's a head.

879
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,720
Oh my god.

880
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,140
Oh my god, please.

881
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,300
Yu-san, find the light!

882
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,680
Find the light!

883
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,420
Please!

884
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,580
Come!

885
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,700
I swear to god, if you do not find the light right now, I will let this monster here kill me.

886
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,560
I don't care about my fucking almond water.

887
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,780
I don't care.

888
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,020
Okay, where the fuck is the monster?

889
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,660
Come over here.

890
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,220
I'm gonna...

891
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,940
Where the fuck is the...

892
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
Come over here.

893
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,880
I don't care anymore.

894
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,740
Yu-san would not find the light.

895
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,480
Something will come over and fucking rip me apart.

896
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,520
Oh hey, there's more almond water that I can't use.

897
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
I can't even carry it!

898
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,480
I have too much almond water!

899
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,440
Something will fucking kill me.

900
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,640
There we go.

901
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
That's fucking right!

902
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:21,980
That's right!

903
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,100
You did this, Yu-san!

904
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,280
Where is he?

905
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,980
Where's the stick figure guy?

906
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,500
Wait, what?

907
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:31,900
Hello?

908
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,060
Yeah, that's right!

909
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,980
Come on, kill me!

910
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,120
Hello?

911
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,840
Where is it?

912
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,680
What the fuck?

913
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,400
Get over here.

914
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,620
They're stuck in the wall!

915
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,940
What the fuck?

916
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,460
Oh my God, it can't even do the simple job!

917
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,220
Oh my God, it was stuck in the wall.

918
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,360
Get over here.

919
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,520
Get over here.

920
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:05,880
OK.

921
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,740
It's less scary when it's just smacking me in the face.

922
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,880
It's a lot less scary.

923
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,660
Follow the...

924
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,160
We both need a fire!

925
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Are you kidding me?

926
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,580
It's like five?

927
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,500
Okay.

928
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,920
Well, I gotta find the door now.

929
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,420
He's on!

930
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,400
You had five minutes to find the door!

931
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,620
All right.

932
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,920
I guess I'll find the door.

933
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,400
All right, where the fuck is the door?

934
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,060
Find the luminous door and revive.

935
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,700
You mean you had five minutes to find the fucking door and you didn't find the fucking door?

936
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:06,550
Okay, well we found the fucking...

937
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,010
There's a teddy bear.

938
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,930
Okay, there's a radioactive door.

939
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,950
Holy shit.

940
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,550
What are all these items?

941
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,090
This is such a bad...

942
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,370
idea to play as a duo.

943
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,690
We should have been a full squad.

944
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,290
I can't believe it and it was my idea to play this game too.

945
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,890
Okay.

946
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,930
Can't you hear Yuson?

947
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,750
I don't think Yuson's close to me.

948
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,930
I think Yuson's trying to find the door as well.

949
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,510
Wait, I heard it.

950
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,190
It was shimmering.

951
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,690
You heard that?

952
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,770
I heard like a shimmering sound.

953
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,500
Where is it?

954
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,360
Where is it?

955
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,100
God, do the hard mode?

956
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,500
This is normal mode and we're fucking struggling!

957
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,820
I might even do easy mode after this!

958
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,490
At this rate.

959
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,030
Wait, I found it!

960
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:19,970
Wait.

961
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,350
Wait, oh!

962
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:22,770
Oh!

963
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,270
Wait, this is it!

964
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,050
Yuson!

965
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,290
Get over here!

966
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,520
This has to be it!

967
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,380
This has to be it!

968
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,640
Wait, what?

969
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,170
This is it!

970
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:49,730
Okay.

971
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,130
Okay.

972
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,830
Maybe... I'm gonna wait a minute.

973
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,730
I'm gonna wait a minute.

974
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,870
Yuson has to show up.

975
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,350
Yuson!

976
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,630
Wait, that's Yuson?

977
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,330
Wait, what would that be, Yuson?

978
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:02,630
That's me?

979
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,930
That's a... This is the door!

980
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,990
This has to be the door!

981
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,690
Where is Yuson?

982
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,350
It's just me?

983
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,990
I have nine lives!

984
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,410
Yuson, you have no excuse!

985
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,250
I have nine...

986
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,650
I have nine lives!

987
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,430
I have nine lives!

988
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,950
Oh my god!

989
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,210
We're restarting!

990
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,330
We're restarting!

991
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,350
You suck!

992
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,330
I'm not doing this!

993
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,680
Fuck you!

994
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,520
Like this, I'm doing it on easy!

995
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,300
I'm doing it on easy!

996
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,040
Lumau!

997
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,140
Lumau!

998
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,380
Lumau!

999
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,320
Fuck you!

1000
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,560
Donkey!

1001
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,220
What did I do?

1002
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,460
Oh my god...

1003
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,860
Lumau.

1004
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,580
Lumau.

1005
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,140
What the fuck do you mean?

1006
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,060
You had her!

1007
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,880
Why did you find the door?

1008
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,400
I... I... I died.

1009
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,340
And I can't do anything if I died.

1010
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:52,820
You know?

1011
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,020
You can!

1012
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,280
You can find the door!

1013
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,380
You find...

1014
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,340
Yeah, I didn't know that.

1015
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,220
Yeah, I didn't know that I have to find the door.

1016
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,880
Sorry about that.

1017
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,660
You had to find the door!

1018
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,640
You know what?

1019
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,620
Now we know.

1020
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,940
Now we know how to do that.

1021
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,440
What about we just gonna figure it out?

1022
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,280
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1023
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,560
Now we're better.

1024
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,360
We're better people now.

1025
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,760
Look at that.

1026
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,000
Back here we go again.

1027
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,660
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get a ball.

1028
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,240
Come on.

1029
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,740
You know?

1030
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:19,980
Alright.

1031
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,180
Okay, now we know what to do.

1032
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:21,940
Now we know.

1033
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,200
Yeah.

1034
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:23,840
Yeah.

1035
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,500
Now we know.

1036
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,820
We can... we can rush this.

1037
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,200
Yeah, yeah.

1038
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,960
Okay, I'm gonna grab the almond water.

1039
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,760
Give it to me!

1040
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,300
Give it to me!

1041
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,900
You can have this.

1042
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,880
You can have the other one.

1043
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,680
Where is that?

1044
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,920
The spray can?

1045
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,300
Okay.

1046
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,060
Yeah, yeah.

1047
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,540
Okay, so I don't remember.

1048
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,020
I don't remember where to go.

1049
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,020
Yeah.

1050
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,760
I'm just gonna follow you.

1051
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,400
I'm gonna follow you.

1052
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,120
No, no, no, no.

1053
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,220
Let's not get into somewhere dark.

1054
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,380
You know, maybe we can just follow the...

1055
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,160
When you find a fl... Apparently there was a flashlight that we missed.

1056
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,720
Yeah.

1057
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,360
Oh, we can get a flashlight.

1058
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1059
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,360
There's a flashlight.

1060
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,100
Wait, you saw it?

1061
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:57,840
Hello?

1062
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,040
Yeah.

1063
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,780
Oh, there you are.

1064
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,200
There you are.

1065
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,540
Okay.

1066
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,300
Okay, there's apparently like a flash... Oh, that's a mirror.

1067
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,260
Holy shit.

1068
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,580
That's...

1069
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,160
Oh my god.

1070
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,940
Okay, there's like... Wait, there's a TV.

1071
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,940
Cannot turn on at this moment.

1072
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,320
Did you hear that?

1073
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,520
No.

1074
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,280
Cannot turn on this...

1075
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,240
I'm gonna pretend I didn't.

1076
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,160
And we... Don't acknowledge it.

1077
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,000
It didn't happen.

1078
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,300
Okay.

1079
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,920
Okay.

1080
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,500
There's like apparently a flashlight somewhere.

1081
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,500
Oh, they're in the drawers.

1082
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,640
Oh.

1083
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,320
Oh, the drawer.

1084
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,020
Is there a flashlight?

1085
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:31,900
Wait.

1086
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
No, that's anxiety.

1087
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,700
You can have that.

1088
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,280
I'll get it.

1089
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,440
I'll get it.

1090
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:36,780
Yeah.

1091
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,340
Okay.

1092
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,380
We have to find...

1093
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,080
We have to... Wait, there's a door here.

1094
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,120
Oh, it's just two lockers.

1095
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,620
It's just lockers.

1096
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:45,700
Oh, guys.

1097
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,780
I'll just say lockers.

1098
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,900
Oh,

1099
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:51,490
what?

1100
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,190
What?

1101
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,050
What?

1102
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,890
Oh, there's not for hiding.

1103
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,110
Oh.

1104
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,090
I can't even get on inside.

1105
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,710
What the fuck?

1106
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,210
There's...

1107
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,790
There's shells.

1108
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,870
I can't even get out in here.

1109
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,470
What the fuck?

1110
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,090
Okay.

1111
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:07,930
Let's go.

1112
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,390
Let's go.

1113
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:08,950
Right.

1114
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,230
Okay.

1115
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,010
Okay.

1116
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,090
I heard a head step.

1117
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,130
No, no.

1118
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:19,270
Okay.

1119
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,730
Okay, I think my favorite part was the fucking scream in the distance.

1120
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,710
You saw find the door.

1121
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,250
Find the door you saw.

1122
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,510
Find the door.

1123
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,590
I'll wait here.

1124
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,670
Find the door.

1125
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,330
You have nine lives.

1126
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,960
I swear you'll be able to find the door.

1127
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,180
It's so easy.

1128
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,840
It's so easy.

1129
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,940
How did I sacrifice them?

1130
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,620
They're the ones that died.

1131
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,560
I saw red light.

1132
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,260
Okay.

1133
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,400
There they are.

1134
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,200
They found the door.

1135
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,160
I saw red light.

1136
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:55,160
Okay.

1137
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,800
You saw found the door.

1138
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,840
You saw it.

1139
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,980
Oh wait, they don't have a radio.

1140
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,800
I'm alive.

1141
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,920
You saw it.

1142
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,460
I'm alive.

1143
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,300
I died.

1144
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,780
You found the door.

1145
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,520
Yeah, I died.

1146
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,780
But when I found the door, I revived.

1147
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,960
Yes, see I told you that's all we need to do.

1148
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,740
Oh, we were back here.

1149
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,120
We went.

1150
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:19,600
We were here.

1151
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,640
Because there was the mirror.

1152
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,020
I need to experience the thing to, you know, educate myself.

1153
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,560
Yeah, see it's all.

1154
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,800
It's a learning process.

1155
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,840
Yeah, it's a learning process.

1156
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,800
We found the door.

1157
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,520
Respect that.

1158
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,200
Okay.

1159
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,020
Yeah, we did.

1160
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,960
We're learning.

1161
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,160
We learned.

1162
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,880
Look at that.

1163
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,480
See, now we know.

1164
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
You need a key.

1165
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,120
We need to find a red key.

1166
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:40,840
Okay.

1167
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,900
We need to find the red key.

1168
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,100
Oh my... Oh, there's more drawers.

1169
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,460
Okay.

1170
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,020
The hour is 1015.

1171
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,780
Okay, more pills.

1172
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,320
How is this level two?

1173
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,400
It's insane.

1174
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,860
It's just a level two.

1175
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,680
Do you hear that?

1176
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,240
At my locker.

1177
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,040
Okay, awesome, awesome, awesome.

1178
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,160
What is this?

1179
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:07,860
What is this?

1180
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,240
Come on.

1181
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,180
Here, here, here, here.

1182
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,500
It's gonna kill you, not me.

1183
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,800
I'm gonna run away anyway, you know.

1184
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,240
It's fine.

1185
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,300
I'm just gonna run away.

1186
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,540
You can just die alone, you know.

1187
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:18,900
Whoa!

1188
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,760
I don't want to die.

1189
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,680
Okay, okay.

1190
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,900
No, wait, wait, wait.

1191
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,800
It's okay.

1192
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,680
We'll die together.

1193
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,640
Okay.

1194
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,120
Yeah.

1195
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:27,820
Awesome.

1196
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:28,780
Oh, wait.

1197
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,400
What about we try here?

1198
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,280
Come over here.

1199
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,360
Here?

1200
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:32,980
Yeah.

1201
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:33,880
Where did you go?

1202
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,260
Oh, here.

1203
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:34,440
Okay.

1204
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,820
There we go.

1205
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah.

1206
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,280
Hello?

1207
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,580
Hello?

1208
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,240
Okay.

1209
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,640
Okay.

1210
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,960
I'm so lost.

1211
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:43,580
I...

1212
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,500
Me too.

1213
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,420
Where are we?

1214
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,300
It's like a maze here.

1215
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,760
Yeah, it is the back rooms.

1216
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,440
No, we've been here because the door is open.

1217
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,120
Oh, wait.

1218
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,400
There's more.

1219
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:50,880
There's more.

1220
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,640
Oh, there's flashlight!

1221
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,660
Oh, wait.

1222
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,700
Is that flashlight?

1223
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,380
Let's go!

1224
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,700
Oh, my God.

1225
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,160
The one thing we've always... We forgot to... Oh, wait.

1226
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,440
This was the tutorial.

1227
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,020
Wait.

1228
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,340
This is the first drawer we found.

1229
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,160
Yeah, this is the tutorial.

1230
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,380
We missed the flashlight in the tutorial.

1231
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:10,940
Okay.

1232
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,440
Oh, my God.

1233
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,400
We're so bad.

1234
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,180
We missed the...

1235
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,360
You gotta carry me, Doki.

1236
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,660
You're a professional streamer.

1237
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,200
You can't do this to me.

1238
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,560
Oh, my God.

1239
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,620
We missed the flashlight in the tutorial.

1240
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,140
Thank you, Remy.

1241
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,040
It's okay.

1242
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,080
Now we have flashlight.

1243
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,140
Yeah.

1244
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:29,780
Everything's going well.

1245
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:29,820
Okay.

1246
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,040
Our mission before we end stream is to get out of here.

1247
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,140
Yeah.

1248
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:35,680
True.

1249
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,880
We just need to...

1250
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,480
Let's go.

1251
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:01,820
Let's go.

1252
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,120
Is it okay?

1253
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,060
Are we okay?

1254
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,540
Are we okay?

1255
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:06,560
Yeah.

1256
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:06,780
I think so.

1257
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:06,800
Are we okay?

1258
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:09,940
It's fine.

1259
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,260
It's fine.

1260
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:10,660
It's fine.

1261
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,120
It's fine.

1262
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,640
It's fine.

1263
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,760
Everything is fine.

1264
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,570
Oh, no.

1265
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,910
I don't know.

1266
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,140
I'm a real monkey.

1267
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,820
Oh, my God.

1268
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,400
Oh, my God.

1269
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,920
He said, find the light.

1270
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,500
Find the light.

1271
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,840
Oh, my God.

1272
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,440
Oh, my God.

1273
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,720
He said, did you hear back?

1274
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,960
Welcome back.

1275
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,940
He said...

1276
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,560
Help.

1277
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,120
Help.

1278
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,400
I died to...

1279
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,460
Get out of the fucking room.

1280
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,340
There's a monster.

1281
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:48,460
Come.

1282
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:48,960
There's a monster.

1283
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,360
Come.

1284
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,140
I can't die like this many times.

1285
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,740
Please.

1286
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,520
Okay.

1287
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,060
He said, when you see the red light, there's a monster.

1288
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,200
Okay.

1289
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,100
I got it.

1290
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:01,660
Okay.

1291
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,580
When you see red light, there's a monster.

1292
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,100
I got it.

1293
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,660
I got it.

1294
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:06,940
Okay.

1295
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,540
Okay.

1296
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,120
If you see red...

1297
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,480
I heard the fucking sound.

1298
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,860
I heard the fucking sound.

1299
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,600
What's that?

1300
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,220
That was a jump scare.

1301
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:20,540
Okay.

1302
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,200
Wait.

1303
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,480
What's that?

1304
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:25,960
There's a box.

1305
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:26,920
What is it?

1306
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,360
What is it?

1307
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:27,820
What is it?

1308
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,360
There's another light.

1309
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,340
It's yours.

1310
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,140
It's your flashlight.

1311
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,420
You died here.

1312
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,680
Okay.

1313
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,140
Got it.

1314
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,260
Okay.

1315
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,480
Yeah.

1316
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,280
Okay.

1317
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,140
Awesome.

1318
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:36,960
Okay.

1319
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,220
Okay.

1320
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,580
Okay.

1321
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:38,800
Okay.

1322
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,100
Okay.

1323
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,820
Why are we still here?

1324
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,100
I feel like I've been here like 20 times.

1325
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,780
I don't know where to go.

1326
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,780
I'm gonna... Okay.

1327
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,140
Let's be brave.

1328
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:48,800
Okay.

1329
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,400
For now.

1330
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:49,820
Yeah.

1331
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,420
I'm so brave.

1332
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:50,740
Okay.

1333
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,060
Dead end.

1334
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:51,360
Dead end.

1335
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:51,800
Dead end.

1336
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:51,840
Dead end.

1337
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:51,960
Wait.

1338
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:52,760
We're here again.

1339
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,760
We just got here.

1340
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,360
This is... This is where you died three times.

1341
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,680
We keep coming back.

1342
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:00,720
Wait.

1343
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,180
Wait.

1344
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:01,520
Wait.

1345
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,860
We keep... We keep coming back to where you died.

1346
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,500
TV.

1347
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,020
TV.

1348
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,820
We've been here many times already.

1349
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,320
Wait.

1350
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:08,540
Wait.

1351
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:08,640
Wait.

1352
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,920
We've been... We have never progressed.

1353
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,700
We don't progress anywhere.

1354
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,180
We're always going back to the same place.

1355
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,240
Shut up.

1356
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:18,680
I'm focusing.

1357
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,460
Wait.

1358
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,160
What is this box?

1359
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:22,980
This is yours.

1360
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,700
It's also yours.

1361
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,080
Oh, shit.

1362
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,640
I picked up some teeth and some...

1363
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:27,800
Oh, shit.

1364
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,760
Oh, my God.

1365
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,140
Okay.

1366
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:32,940
Here.

1367
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,300
Oh, my God.

1368
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:33,500
Okay.

1369
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:33,920
What?

1370
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,280
Okay.

1371
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,360
There's nothing here.

1372
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,360
It's okay.

1373
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,460
We don't have to mind about that.

1374
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,380
Now, I really want to get out of my room.

1375
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,560
I mean, get out of this room, so...

1376
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,280
We need to find... We need to find a new world.

1377
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,420
We're back to the TV.

1378
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,380
Why are we still always going back to the TV?

1379
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:55,880
Where?

1380
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,140
It's the same place.

1381
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:57,780
This is the same place.

1382
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,880
Same room, but we died!

1383
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,400
Same place!

1384
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,560
Oh my god!

1385
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,020
We're so lost!

1386
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,260
Never ending collab.

1387
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,400
Are you ready for the long, long stream?

1388
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,060
We're lost!

1389
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,680
We keep going back to the same place!

1390
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,380
Why did you go back to the same place?

1391
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,280
No, oh my god.

1392
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,840
We need to figure out a new place to go!

1393
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:23,920
Here!

1394
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,800
Here, Yusuf!

1395
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,560
I thought you were actually going to Minecraft.

1396
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,460
I'm pretty sure we didn't come here.

1397
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,400
I know the Minecraft streamers are good at the sense of directions, right?

1398
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,020
Okay.

1399
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,840
That is not true.

1400
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,260
That is absolutely...

1401
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,780
No, we've been here!

1402
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,260
The red key!

1403
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,040
Yeah, this is the red key door!

1404
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,640
Let's, you know, we better just stick around here.

1405
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,160
And don't go too far from here.

1406
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,340
Wait here.

1407
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,780
Okay, if you find a painting, look at it closer.

1408
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,220
Okay.

1409
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,400
Alright.

1410
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,200
There must be a new place we haven't gone before.

1411
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:58,740
Yeah.

1412
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,640
There has to be one new place.

1413
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,440
I refuse to believe that we're...

1414
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,220
We found everything.

1415
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,120
We need to break the cycle.

1416
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,760
Wait, we haven't gone here, I think.

1417
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,220
Yusan, Yusan, this way.

1418
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:15,480
Okay.

1419
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:16,740
Here?

1420
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,420
I think so.

1421
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,760
I don't think we've been here, right?

1422
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,360
I bet so.

1423
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,100
This is new.

1424
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,640
There's no TV here.

1425
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:26,620
Yeah.

1426
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,940
There's no TV.

1427
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,980
This is new.

1428
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,540
Right side here.

1429
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,600
Okay.

1430
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,780
No, we've opened this door before.

1431
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

1432
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,140
This is the tutorial!

1433
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,220
This is the beginning!

1434
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,040
We're back at the beginning!

1435
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,820
I'm focusing!

1436
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1437
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:42,920
Here?

1438
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,340
Here?

1439
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:44,960
Here?

1440
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,120
Here?

1441
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,500
I spent 30 minutes on the tutorial.

1442
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:47,960
You know what?

1443
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,420
You shouldn't let me, you know, guide the way for you.

1444
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,320
I shouldn't be guiding the way either!

1445
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,780
I'm just as lost!

1446
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,860
I'm just as lost as you!

1447
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,540
I swear to god... this is the TV room!

1448
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,980
This is the fucking TV room!

1449
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,680
It's the same room again!

1450
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,400
Oh my god.

1451
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,240
We're back at the TV room!

1452
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,240
Is the same...

1453
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,040
I hate this game.

1454
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,500
I really hate this game.

1455
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,180
Wait, wait, wait...

1456
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,280
Yusan... Yusan, come here.

1457
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,200
Come here.

1458
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1459
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,060
This side, this side.

1460
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,600
Here, here, here.

1461
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,740
This has to be new, right?

1462
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,480
I hope so.

1463
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:28,320
I really hope so.

1464
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,120
This is the red key room.

1465
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,540
I swear to God.

1466
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:32,660
Okay.

1467
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,680
Oh my God, we're back in the beginning.

1468
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,340
We're back!

1469
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:42,680
We keep looping!

1470
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,140
How do we get out of this?

1471
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,720
We must find our way out of this loop!

1472
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,880
What is this loop?

1473
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,040
We can never be a good team, I'll tell you, Doki.

1474
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,660
Oh my God.

1475
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,220
No, no, no.

1476
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,140
It's not us.

1477
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:55,880
It's not us.

1478
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,540
It's the game.

1479
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,240
It's not us.

1480
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,460
You're really bad, Commander.

1481
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,220
I'm sorry.

1482
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,120
Oh yeah?

1483
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,760
You do better.

1484
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,920
You do better.

1485
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:05,460
No!

1486
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,600
I found a new room!

1487
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,780
I found a new room!

1488
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,620
It's dead bodies.

1489
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,000
I'm like the beginner for most of the game.

1490
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,960
I found a new room.

1491
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,920
What is this?

1492
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,440
At least I didn't find a TV room.

1493
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,140
Five times!

1494
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,500
It's about missing people were found in Paladin.

1495
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,600
Some of the bodies were found in some anomalies.

1496
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,760
Look for a VHS tape for more information.

1497
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,620
Fisher.

1498
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,220
We need a VHS tape.

1499
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:29,720
Okay.

1500
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,920
Malcolm Fisher.

1501
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:33,800
Oh!

1502
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,280
Okay.

1503
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,060
I mean... I... I... Oh!

1504
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:36,440
We...

1505
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,500
We put like... I have like body parts on me.

1506
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,000
So I think like we put like body parts on them.

1507
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,460
Got it.

1508
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:43,980
Like a...

1509
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,840
Look at the corpses.

1510
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,160
They hide a secret code.

1511
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,700
Just pay attention to the body parts.

1512
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:47,860
The blood.

1513
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,000
What?

1514
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,640
Pay attention to the blood.

1515
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,700
Blood type, I guess.

1516
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,980
I guess it's like heart.

1517
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:54,740
Oh!

1518
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,700
Wait!

1519
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,140
Okay.

1520
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,360
I have...

1521
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:00,800
Okay.

1522
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,580
The blood is...

1523
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,000
The blood.

1524
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:03,480
Okay.

1525
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,380
Is there any blood on the leg?

1526
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,340
I have a leg.

1527
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,400
None of them are on the leg though.

1528
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,200
I have foot and... I have a foot and ear.

1529
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,740
But none of them are like...

1530
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,840
None of them have like head or ears, God.

1531
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,440
I have teeth too.

1532
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,440
Hey, Nuki.

1533
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:25,940
Look at it.

1534
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,480
What?

1535
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:31,760
Insane.

1536
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,240
Respect the dead body.

1537
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:34,840
Okay.

1538
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,460
Okay.

1539
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:37,880
What?

1540
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,460
Oh!

1541
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:40,940
Okay.

1542
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:41,680
That's scaring me.

1543
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,520
Wait.

1544
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,160
But how do we...

1545
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,100
Do you have any idea for this?

1546
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,540
The corp... We need to find...

1547
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,240
We need to find a tape.

1548
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,000
The tape?

1549
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,500
Yeah.

1550
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:49,720
Yeah.

1551
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,080
Okay.

1552
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,020
Tape on the dead body, right?

1553
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,560
Yeah.

1554
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,960
Don't touch the smoke because I think the smoke is like dangerous.

1555
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:56,780
Wait.

1556
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,400
We need to find the tape and...

1557
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,060
Blood matches this to the keypad.

1558
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,440
There's no blood here.

1559
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,100
Alright.

1560
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:06,820
Let's find a VHS.

1561
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,340
Let's go back.

1562
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,820
We need to find a VHS tape.

1563
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,680
You want the almond milk?

1564
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,500
Can we go up?

1565
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,440
Here.

1566
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,020
No.

1567
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,240
No.

1568
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:15,360
No.

1569
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,080
There's almond water.

1570
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,660
You should take it.

1571
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,240
Okay.

1572
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,460
It heals your HP.

1573
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:21,840
Okay.

1574
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,500
I think I'm just gonna heal my HP now.

1575
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,340
Can I?

1576
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,340
Use.

1577
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,180
Alright.

1578
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,640
Look at the lock on the locker.

1579
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,340
What do you mean?

1580
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:35,940
Oh!

1581
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:38,780
Oh!

1582
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:41,880
One, two... Okay.

1583
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,480
Wait.

1584
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,160
I figured this out.

1585
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,840
I figured it out.

1586
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,080
Two, three...

1587
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,700
Okay.

1588
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,340
Oh my god.

1589
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,760
I'm so fucking stupid.

1590
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,060
Two, three...

1591
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,100
You're so fucking stupid.

1592
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,080
I did it.

1593
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,320
Wow.

1594
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,020
I did it.

1595
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,680
I found a hammer.

1596
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,780
We can break vases now.

1597
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,280
Awesome.

1598
00:57:59,520 --> 00:57:59,780
Okay.

1599
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,180
Where are you by the way?

1600
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,500
Wait.

1601
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,060
Where are you?

1602
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:04,820
You son?

1603
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,320
Hello?

1604
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:06,800
Doki?

1605
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,180
You son?

1606
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:36,730
I'm gonna die.

1607
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:39,990
Where are you?

1608
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:44,030
Where are you?

1609
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:44,510
Where are you?

1610
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,950
I'm inside the locker now.

1611
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,490
Get out of the locker!

1612
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:49,990
I just found two enemies already.

1613
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:51,350
Like I don't know.

1614
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,150
Oh my god.

1615
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:52,730
Wait.

1616
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:53,410
Where are you?

1617
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,370
I don't wanna get out of my...

1618
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,250
Oh my god.

1619
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:56,790
Okay.

1620
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,710
Yeah.

1621
00:58:58,750 --> 00:58:59,310
I think they're gone.

1622
00:58:59,390 --> 00:58:59,730
It's okay.

1623
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,650
There's an enemy next to me.

1624
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,410
Why I can't even find you?

1625
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,510
I hear your voice.

1626
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,600
You died?

1627
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,260
No, right?

1628
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:17,440
No.

1629
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,540
There's people next to me.

1630
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,460
Come over here.

1631
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,440
I'm at the bodies.

1632
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:35,270
Why is there red light?

1633
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:36,330
Leave.

1634
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:37,250
Leave.

1635
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,270
Leave.

1636
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,480
What do you mean it's probably gone?

1637
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,100
There's still red lights in front of me.

1638
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:48,780
Okay.

1639
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,540
I'm very anxious right now.

1640
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,120
That's what meds are for.

1641
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,640
I'm cured now.

1642
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,820
I found a tablet.

1643
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,520
I found the tape.

1644
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,020
I found the tape?

1645
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,080
Yeah.

1646
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,260
It was at the horse room.

1647
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,440
Come to the...

1648
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,360
Come to the body room.

1649
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,400
Body room.

1650
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:06,820
Okay.

1651
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,820
Wherever you are.

1652
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,240
Go back to the body room.

1653
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,580
I don't know where you are.

1654
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,560
I'm gonna be in the body room.

1655
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,780
You have a... You still have your radio?

1656
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,580
Yeah, I think so.

1657
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,420
Oh, God.

1658
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,240
The radio is so fucking loud.

1659
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:28,440
Okay.

1660
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,840
The dead... The body room, right?

1661
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,380
Yeah.

1662
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,300
I'm in the body room.

1663
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:32,920
Where was that?

1664
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,260
Where was... What do you mean where was that?

1665
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,100
Where was that?

1666
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,600
It's in the body room.

1667
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,220
Where was... Where was that?

1668
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,760
I'm just...

1669
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,120
I'm still in the body room.

1670
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,140
I have so many items on me.

1671
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,080
You can't let me die.

1672
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,440
I have so many things on me.

1673
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:57,900
Wait.

1674
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,360
Wait.

1675
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:58,700
Hello?

1676
01:00:59,100 --> 01:00:59,840
You sign?

1677
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,120
Hello?

1678
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,560
You somewhere?

1679
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,180
I'm trying to find where was the body room.

1680
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,670
I'm trying to find you.

1681
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:14,990
We're up.

1682
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,070
Okay.

1683
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:16,330
Here.

1684
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:16,830
There's a buggy.

1685
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:17,150
There's a buggy.

1686
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:17,370
There's a buggy.

1687
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:17,530
There's a buggy.

1688
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:17,690
There's a buggy.

1689
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:18,070
There's a buggy.

1690
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,770
Why are you hiding inside the locker?

1691
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:22,210
What?

1692
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,630
There is... There is a person next to us.

1693
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:26,630
No.

1694
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:27,490
No.

1695
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,290
It's gone.

1696
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,970
Oh, it's gone?

1697
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:29,210
It's gone.

1698
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:29,890
Yeah.

1699
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,270
Oh.

1700
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:30,510
No.

1701
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:30,730
No.

1702
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:30,850
No.

1703
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:31,850
Okay.

1704
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:36,090
It's gone.

1705
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:36,430
It's gone.

1706
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,770
It's gone.

1707
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:37,830
What do you mean it's gone?

1708
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:38,450
I see red.

1709
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:40,190
No.

1710
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:40,530
It's there.

1711
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:41,310
No.

1712
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,630
It's gone.

1713
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:45,930
You can't say it's gone when I can see the color red.

1714
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:46,450
Okay.

1715
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:47,270
Now it's gone.

1716
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:48,410
It's gone.

1717
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:48,910
It's gone.

1718
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:50,790
Now it's gone.

1719
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:54,170
It can't be like it's gone when there's red.

1720
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:55,450
Okay.

1721
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:56,290
We need to find the TV.

1722
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:57,690
Okay.

1723
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:58,090
Wait.

1724
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:58,470
Wait.

1725
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,190
What do I hear?

1726
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,350
I heard something drinking.

1727
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,790
Okay.

1728
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:03,270
Okay.

1729
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,490
We need to find the TV room.

1730
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:05,610
Okay.

1731
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,990
We found it before 20 times.

1732
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:08,830
We can do it again.

1733
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:09,850
I know, right?

1734
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:10,190
Yeah.

1735
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,030
We found it!

1736
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:13,770
Where?

1737
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:14,090
Where?

1738
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:14,290
Where?

1739
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:14,410
Where?

1740
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:14,690
Okay.

1741
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:14,930
No.

1742
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,370
There's an enemy in front of us.

1743
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:19,730
It's over here.

1744
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:21,190
Okay.

1745
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:23,070
Yeah.

1746
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:23,810
There's an enemy there.

1747
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:24,570
There's an enemy there.

1748
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:25,790
Okay.

1749
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:26,190
Okay.

1750
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:26,490
Okay.

1751
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:26,710
Okay.

1752
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:26,950
Okay.

1753
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:27,990
You know what?

1754
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,190
I'm proud of us for it.

1755
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,610
We can always find the TV room.

1756
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:31,990
I know, right?

1757
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,250
Yeah.

1758
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:35,510
We can always find the TV room.

1759
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,150
They're gone.

1760
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,490
They're gone.

1761
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:36,770
No.

1762
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:37,070
They're not.

1763
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:39,150
No.

1764
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,530
They're not.

1765
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,330
I see red.

1766
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:41,670
Really?

1767
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:43,890
If it's red, there's enemies.

1768
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:45,310
What do you mean?

1769
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:46,510
Oh.

1770
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:49,170
My flashlight, it's not working anymore That's why.

1771
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:49,590
Is it?

1772
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:50,170
No.

1773
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:50,690
It is.

1774
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,070
It's just when you're close to the enemy, it doesn't work.

1775
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:55,890
Wait.

1776
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,730
I just saw your stream.

1777
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:58,610
But, okay.

1778
01:02:58,610 --> 01:02:58,790
Okay.

1779
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:03,110
But my- on my screen, it doesn't turn- the light is not turning red.

It's not turning red?

1782
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:06,850
What's wrong with your screen?

1783
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,270
Oh, there's a smoke!

1784
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,010
Okay, we can't touch the smoke.

1785
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,470
Why is it red again?

1786
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,760
Why is it red?

1787
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,280

1815
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,840

1816
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,160

They're gone.

1843
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:42,340
They're gone.

1844
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,020
Okay, we saw the dog, guys.

1845
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,900
Happy birthday.

What does it say?

1856
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,120
Alright, so there's nine bodies.

1858
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,240
We need to find that room again!

01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:32,460
No.

1860
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:33,760
Not again.

01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:41,970
Malcolm Fisher.

1862
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:43,030

01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:55,850
Lena.

1870
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,290
No eye.

1871
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:58,690
Okay.

1872
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,250
Okay, Lena no eye.

1875
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,070
Chad!

1876
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,650
Oh, I have teeth!

1877
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,610
I have teeth on me!

1878
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,990
Okay, we need to give Chad his teeth.

1879
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,810
And eyes for Lena?

1880
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,850

I have teeth already.

1884
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:19,990
I have teeth already.

1885
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,410
So let's go back to the body room.

1886
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:22,510
Okay.

1887
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:23,390
Okay, our mission.

1888
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:25,610
We just have to finish this room.

1889
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:28,150
We just have to finish this level.

1890
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:29,670
I like it.

1891
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:30,250
I love it.

1892
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,870
The moment we finish this level, we win.

1893
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,230
We win.

1894
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:37,390
Okay.

1895
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:39,710
I don't know where to go.

1896
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:42,490
I don't remember where... where was the body room?

1897
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,570
Where was the fire?

1898
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:44,090
Me too.

1899
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:49,770
Where was the body room?

1900
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:50,930
Was it like in here?

1901
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:53,670
You, son?

1902
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:54,910
Yeah?

1903
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:55,790
Where are you?

1904
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:57,830
Here, here, here, here.

1905
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:58,710
Where is here?

1906
01:06:59,170 --> 01:06:59,870
Come over here.

1907
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:01,450
Here, here, here, here.

1908
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:01,730
Okay.

1909
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,810
Alright, I think it was like in this corridor?

1910
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:07,730
I hope so.

1911
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:08,810
I think?

1912
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,070
I can't move properly.

1913
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:11,650
Oh my god.

1914
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,250
I'm seriously lack of stamina.

1915
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:13,930
Okay.

1916
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,250
Okay.

1917
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,330
Yeah, I found it.

1918
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:17,770
I found it.

1919
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:18,130
Okay.

1920
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,550
It was Chad, right?

1921
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:23,490
Wait, there's a red.

1922
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,070
There's red.

1923
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,430
This is Lena.

1924
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,110
Okay.

1925
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:34,290
We need to find Chad.

1926
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:35,390
Okay.

1927
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,570
We need to find Chad.

1928
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,610
Chad is teeth.

1929
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:39,690
Marco.

1930
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:41,490
Celine.

1931
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:43,770
Frank.

1932
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:46,770
Robert.

1933
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:47,050
Welcome.

1934
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,190
Okay, I found Chad.

1935
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:50,150
The last one.

1936
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:50,510
Nice.

1937
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:53,870
I just put it here?

1938
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:54,850
Mm.

1939
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:57,650
I do it?

1940
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:58,710
Okay, I got teeth.

1941
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,270
Alright.

1942
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:01,870
We need...

1943
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:05,190
We need to find an eye and a nose.

1944
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,230
Okay.

1945
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,030
How do we find them?

1946
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:09,230
Okay, we just gotta look.

1947
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:10,330
Alright.

1948
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:12,170
Okay.

1949
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,730
Did you go this way yet?

1950
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:15,490
Did you go this way yet?

1951
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:17,390
Nope.

1952
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:18,910
I guess.

1953
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:20,690
Alright.

1954
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:21,650
We didn't...

1955
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:22,310
Did we go here yet?

1956
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,230
No, I don't think so.

1957
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:27,590
That's just a locker.

1958
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,410
It's just a normal locker.

1959
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:30,670
Normal locker, you know?

1960
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,130
But it could be a trap.

1961
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,110
Where the fuck is the nose?

1962
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:35,670
Wait, there's red here.

1963
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:38,590
Who's over there though?

1964
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:41,710
I don't know where we haven't gone.

1965
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,510
Want me to go there?

1966
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:44,750
I don't know.

1967
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:45,790
I'm so lost.

1968
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:46,750
Where do we not go?

1969
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,030
I can never tell.

1970
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,690
I heard the sound.

1971
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,190
I heard the noise.

1972
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:51,630
Do I have footsteps?

1973
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:53,390
I'm just gonna get myself a ball.

1974
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:53,930
I'm just gonna go.

1975
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:07,840
No!

1976
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:08,120
No!

1977
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:08,300
No!

1978
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:08,420
No!

1979
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:08,700
No!

1980
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,060
No!

1981
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:09,260
No!

1982
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:09,500
No!

1983
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:09,840
No!

1984
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:09,980
No!

1985
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:10,320
No!

1986
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:10,520
No!

1987
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:10,740
No!

1988
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:10,840
No!

1989
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,120
No!

1990
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,300
No!

1991
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:11,500
No!

1992
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:11,680
No!

1993
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,560
No!

1994
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,840
It was not my fault that we did that.

1995
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,680
Was not my fault they're not fast enough for the locker.

1996
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,820
Was not my fault!

1997
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,420
How could I?

1998
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,740
Whoever gets the locker first win.

1999
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,420
They could have...

2000
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,940
They could have picked their own locker.

2001
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,240
They could have found it.

2002
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,120
I did not abandon you some.

2003
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,000
I saw a locker and I went for it.

2004
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,520
Look I have the...

2005
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,700
I have the...

2006
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:21,420
I have the...

2007
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,940
the ear and the legs.

2008
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,560
This is important.

2009
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,960
I have the ears and the legs.

2010
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,200
I can't die.

2011
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:30,280
I can't die.

2012
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:35,780
Exactly.

2013
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:39,480
Don't need to outrun the monster.

2014
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:43,160
I just gotta be faster than the other person.

2015
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,220
I just need to be faster.

2016
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,200
Exactly.

2017
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,020
That was horrible.

2018
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,740
What do you mean?

2019
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,060
I found the locker.

2020
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,540
That was horrible.

2021
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,060
I said...

2022
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:00,420
I'm scared.

2023
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,960
I'm like anxious now.

2024
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:03,600
Maybe...

2025
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:04,920
We can...

2026
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,660
Come here.

2027
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,340
We haven't been here.

2028
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:10,960
Where did you go?

2029
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,160
What is that?

2030
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:14,900
I have the hammer.

2031
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:16,900
Nice.

2032
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,420
I have screws on it by the way.

2033
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:18,800
Yeah.

2034
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,460
Wait.

2035
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,740
I don't have the hammer.

2036
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,620
Do you have the hammer?

2037
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,800
I don't have it actually.

2038
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,240
Really?

2039
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:26,420
Yeah.

2040
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,340
Let me check my email.

2041
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:27,780
You have it?

2042
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:28,680
I didn't pick it up.

2043
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,280
No.

2044
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:32,860
I don't have it.

2045
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:33,080
Wait.

2046
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:33,460
I do.

2047
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,860
I'm dumb.

2048
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:35,800
I'm dumb.

2049
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:36,180
I do.

2050
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,020
How do I...

2051
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:37,640
I?

2052
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:39,500
Wait.

2053
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:39,780
One.

2054
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,020
Yeah.

2055
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:42,640
Okay.

2056
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,800
How do I bring my hammer out?

2057
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,520
How do I?

2058
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:48,460
Swing it.

2059
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:49,620
Swing it.

2060
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:50,900
How do I?

2061
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,660
It won't let me bring my hammer out.

2062
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,240
I'm scroll wheeling.

2063
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,020
You have to equip it.

2064
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:57,640
Equip it.

2065
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,240
I did.

2066
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,600
I did.

2067
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:00,580
Why?

2068
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,280
Okay.

2069
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:03,400
You do.

2070
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:03,820
Okay.

2071
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:04,400
You're so good.

2072
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,600
You picked up the hammer.

2073
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:06,660
Okay.

2074
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:06,860
Okay.

2075
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,560
Let me try that.

2076
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,200
Equip.

2077
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:09,520
That's right.

2078
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:11,920
Equip.

2079
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:12,620
Okay.

2080
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:14,480
How do I use that?

2081
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:14,920
Yeah.

2082
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,500
Oh yeah.

2083
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:15,780
Yeah.

2084
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,900
How do you use it?

2085
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,220
Yeah.

2086
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,480
How do we use that?

2087
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,660
How do you use it?

2088
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,000
Yeah.

2089
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:22,800
Wait.

2090
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:24,740
Interact.

2091
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,200
Maybe you can break something.

2092
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:28,800
Wait.

2093
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:29,520
Yeah.

2094
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:29,960
Yeah.

2095
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:30,800
How do you use it?

2096
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,440
You saw it.

2097
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,060
Oh wait.

2098
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:34,400
E.

2099
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,600
Press E.

2100
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,620
Then I.

2101
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:37,560
Then scroll wheel.

2102
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,360
Um...

2103
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,760
What did you say?

2104
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:46,340
E.

2105
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,320
I.

2106
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,940
And then scroll wheel.

2107
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:50,740
Okay.

2108
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,860
So I have to equip first, right?

2109
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:53,180
Yeah.

2110
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:53,360
Yeah.

2111
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:54,700
Yeah.

2112
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:54,700
E.

2113
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:56,300
I.

2114
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,120
Yeah.

2115
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,520
Scroll.

2116
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,180
Yeah.

2117
01:12:59,220 --> 01:12:59,400
No.

2118
01:12:59,460 --> 01:12:59,720
It's not.

2119
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:00,500
It's not working.

2120
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,980
I told you it wasn't easy.

2121
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:03,740
Okay.

2122
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:04,220
Fine.

2123
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:04,580
Fine.

2124
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:04,760
Fine.

2125
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,700
I'll figure it out.

2126
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,200
E.

2127
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:07,820
I.

2128
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,800
Oh my god.

2129
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:11,620
I'm so... I figured it out.

2130
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,000
I'm so proud of ourselves.

2131
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:15,780
I'm so proud of ourselves.

2132
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:15,800
Okay.

2133
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:16,260
Okay.

2134
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:16,900
Okay.

2135
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,040
Wait.

2136
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:18,520
Wait.

2137
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:18,740
Wait.

2138
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:19,000
Something.

2139
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:19,340
Wait.

2140
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,220
Did you hide inside the locker?

2141
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,520
Okay.

2142
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:27,100
Okay.

2143
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:28,540
Okay.

2144
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,140
I'm safe.

2145
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:30,540
Okay.

2146
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:30,900
Awesome.

2147
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,300
Awesome.

2148
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:31,600
Awesome.

2149
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,500
Okay.

2150
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,320
I'm safe.

2151
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,180
Okay.

2152
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,100
Where are you?

2153
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,020
Okay.

2154
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,320
Okay.

2155
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:37,520
Okay.

2156
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,040
I'm just... I'm just breaking everything right now.

2157
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,200
What is that?

2158
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:42,300
What is this?

2159
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:42,640
I don't know.

2160
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,620
I found the red key!

2161
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:45,140
Noice.

2162
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:48,340
What's that?

2163
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,380
What's that?

2164
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,240
What?

2165
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,100
It's me.

2166
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,500
Why were you screaming?

2167
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:53,480
It's me.

2168
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,320
It's me.

2169
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,320
Why were you screaming?

2170
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,540
I'm in front of you.

2171
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,120
You don't see me?

2172
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:58,940
I see you.

2173
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,020
But why were you screaming?

2174
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:01,060
No.

2175
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:01,920
I'm happy.

2176
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:02,700
I'm happy.

2177
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:02,880
Oh.

2178
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,240
You're happy.

2179
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:03,620
Okay.

2180
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,020
Okay.

2181
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:04,460
Okay.

2182
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,960
I thought something happened.

2183
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,320
I was like... something...

2184
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,060
There's a dog.

2185
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:09,580
There's a dog.

2186
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,020
There's a dog.

2187
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:10,400
I'm just screaming.

2188
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:37,610
Yusa, where are you?

2189
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:38,990
Nogie.

2190
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:40,190
Nogie.

2191
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:42,090
I'm inside.

2192
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:42,710
Are you okay?

2193
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,070
You're inside the locker?

2194
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:44,450
Okay.

2195
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:44,870
It's gone.

2196
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:45,190
It's gone.

2197
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:45,790
Yeah.

2198
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:45,810
Yeah.

2199
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:46,090
Yeah.

2200
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:47,910
We dodged it.

2201
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:48,570
Yeah.

2202
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:48,790
Yeah.

2203
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:49,410
We did it.

2204
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:50,470
We did it.

2205
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:51,030
We're a team.

2206
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,270
We're a team.

2207
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:03,840
It's fine.

2208
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,340
It's fine.

2209
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:04,860
Get out.

2210
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,420
It's not fine.

2211
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,140
He's in front of me.

2212
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:06,920
It's fine.

2213
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:07,680
It's fine.

2214
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:15,180
It's not right.

2215
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:21,000
Run.

2216
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:21,920
Find a locker.

2217
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,540
Find a locker.

2218
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:31,880
Are you okay?

2219
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,180
Are you okay?

2220
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,680
Yusa, are you okay?

2221
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:38,960
It's gone.

2222
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,000
Oh my god.

2223
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,700
We're so good at this game.

2224
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,480
It's not okay.

2225
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:43,880
Okay.

2226
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,560
I need to drink my almond water.

2227
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:47,780
Okay.

2228
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,060
Where are you?

2229
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,620
Where did you go?

2230
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:51,480
I'm here.

2231
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,060
Okay.

2232
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:52,420
Okay.

2233
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,680
I'm gonna break some more vases.

2234
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:56,500
Hammer.

2235
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,260
More violence.

2236
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,520
Break everything.

2237
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,200
Nice.

2238
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:00,480
Okay.

2239
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:01,740
I have the red key.

2240
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:02,320
We got...

2241
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,620
Oh, you want the anxiety pills?

2242
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,240
Do you need some?

2243
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:04,980
I need it.

2244
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:05,380
Yeah.

2245
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:05,460
Yeah.

2246
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:05,660
Here.

2247
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,500
There's some more.

2248
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:07,440
I ran out of my...

2249
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,060
I ran out of my anxiety pills.

2250
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:10,260
Oh my god.

2251
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,260
The dog left.

2252
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,460
Oh my god.

2253
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,120
The dog left.

2254
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:15,580
Okay.

2255
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,460
There has...

2256
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:17,280
Is there anything else?

2257
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,700
There's more anxiety pills here.

2258
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:19,720
I need it.

2259
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,400
I need it.

2260
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:20,660
Yeah.

2261
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:20,820
Yeah.

2262
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:20,880
Yeah.

2263
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:36,510
Leave us alone!

2264
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:39,370
We just wanted to eat our fish!

2265
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,630
Leave us alone!

2266
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,450
What's the dog doing?

2267
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:48,930
Leave us alone!

2268
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:52,950
I'm alive, alive.

2269
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:53,490
Are you alive?

2270
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:55,190
Is the dog still there?

2271
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,790
No.

2272
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:57,650
Just do it.

2273
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,910
If the dog's there, we're gonna get out of here.

2274
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:03,210
It's there.

2275
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:06,890
You see that?

2276
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:07,390
It's there.

2277
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:08,190
It's just right there.

2278
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,470
I don't have enough almond water!

2279
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:10,690
It's just right there.

2280
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:11,410
You see that?

2281
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:12,050
I do!

2282
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:13,750
I'm looking at it right now!

2283
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:14,350
Leave!

2284
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:16,850
They're looking at me right now!

2285
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:18,410
They're staring at me!

2286
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:25,590
Why did you do that to me?

2287
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,250
Why?

2288
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,350
Why did you do that to me?

2289
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:29,050
Why?

2290
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:31,110
Oh!

2291
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,810
Oh, the water fucking died!

2292
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:34,710
What was that?

2293
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:36,710
What did you do that?

2294
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:37,370
What do you mean?

2295
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:38,090
Explanation.

2296
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:38,990
What do you mean?

2297
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:39,790
I didn't do anything!

2298
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,170
I'm just trying to...

2299
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:41,850
Almond water!

2300
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:42,890
Almond water!

2301
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:43,490
Almond water!

2302
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:43,870
Oh, the water fucking died!

2303
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:44,350
The water fucking died!

2304
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:47,270
What the fuck?

2305
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:49,810
Stay there!

2306
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:50,830
You...

2307
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:56,190
Oh my god.

2308
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:57,570
Oh my god.

2309
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,010
Monster magnet.

2310
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:00,190
Shut up!

2311
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:00,670
Shut up!

2312
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,710
Is there anything else in the vases?

2313
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:16,930
Get out!

2314
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:18,310
Get away!

2315
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:20,450
I can't!

2316
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:21,370
I just...

2317
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:25,430
But I wanna find... I wanna know if there's anything else!

2318
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:26,570
My sight!

2319
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:29,330
Is there anything else in the vases?

2320
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:32,130
That's the only reason why I'm breaking them!

2321
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:35,130
Why is he still there?

2322
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:35,670
Leave!

2323
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:42,630
The dog fucking loved me so bad!

2324
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,170
Oh my god!

2325
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:46,830
Oh my god!

2326
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:48,970
Okay.

2327
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,530
But there's one more vase!

2328
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,690
Oh, it's just a key.

2329
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:56,370
Why did Nani break that many vases?

2330
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:57,850
Okay, is he gone?

2331
01:18:58,510 --> 01:18:59,650
Nice, nice, nice.

2332
01:18:59,650 --> 01:18:59,970
Okay.

2333
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:02,930
Okay, I need to drink my almond water again.

2334
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:04,970
Okay, we can leave now!

2335
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:06,250
We have the key!

2336
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:08,570
Awesome!

2337
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:09,170
Awesome!

2338
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,250
I'm happy that we're...

2339
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,290
Okay, come here!

2340
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:14,490
Oh!

2341
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:16,170
It's still here!

2342
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:17,030
Leave!

2343
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,050
Leave me alone!

2344
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,270
What the fuck?

2345
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:26,330
That's so funny!

2346
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:28,070
He's still here!

2347
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:29,970
No, it's gone!

2348
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:32,150
No, he's literally still here!

2349
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,250
I'm looking at him!

2350
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:33,850
Don't worry!

2351
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,390
No, no, get out!

2352
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:37,250
You know...

2353
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:47,410
Dude, just... the fucking... the scream from...

2354
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:52,670
I like how I heard the scream from the distance!

2355
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,770
It's like...

2356
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,550
Oh no!

2357
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:00,730
Oh no!

2358
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:02,310
No, it's not!

2359
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:03,770
He's not here!

2360
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:05,110
Wow!

2361
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,610
Oh my god!

2362
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,230
Oh my god!

2363
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:16,970
Is it...

2364
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,010
Is it gone now?

2365
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:22,650
Is the dog gone?

2366
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:27,750
More almond water!

2367
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,730
I love my almond water!

2368
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:38,720
You son?

2369
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,780
Come, he's gone!

2370
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,800
He's gone for real!

2371
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,560
You son?

2372
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:51,820
You son?

2373
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:54,840
You son?

2374
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:57,540
You son?

2375
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,020
I can't do it!

2376
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,120
You son, come over here!

2377
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,970
Get out of the room!

2378
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,410
Leave us alone!

2379
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:22,570
Oh my god, leave!

2380
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:25,710
What a lot of...

2381
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:26,590
Leave!

2382
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,830
I can't get- Leave!

2383
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,270
You son!

2384
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:39,370
Just...

2385
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:40,370
Leave!

2386
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:42,190
Just...

2387
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:48,070
We just wanna finish this level.

2388
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:49,750
This is all we want.

2389
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:53,130
Just fucking leave us alone!

2390
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:58,170
Oh my god!

2391
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,050
I'm just here forever!

2392
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:06,810
Where are you?

2393
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,910
Yusak, get out of the room!

2394
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,200
Oh my god!

2395
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,480
Why is it still here?

2396
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,980
Oh my god!

2397
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,540
Oh my god!

2398
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:40,320
Why is it still here?

2399
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,680
Oh my god.

2400
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,340
Yusak, I'm gonna leave the room.

2401
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,000
Yusak!

2402
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,620
Yusak, run!

2403
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,200
Run to me!

2404
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:57,340
Yusak, run to me!

2405
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,840
Run to the vase!

2406
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,700
Run out of the vases!

2407
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,200
Get out of the vase room!

2408
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,720
Oh my god!

2409
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,060
Oh my god!

2410
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,000
Dog!

2411
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,020
Dog!

2412
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,460
What

2413
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,160
the fuck is this?

2414
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:26,620
What the fuck is this?

2415
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:26,840
Dog!

2416
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:32,830
Dog!

2417
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:33,470
Dog!

2418
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:36,910
Fuck out of here!

2419
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:38,510
Oh my god!

2420
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:41,170
I can't see any shit!

2421
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,270
Oh my god!

2422
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:43,490
Anxiety pill?

2423
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:45,110
Oh my god!

2424
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:46,830
I used all of my almond water!

2425
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:47,250
That's insane!

2426
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:49,570
Almond water!

2427
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,370
Save me!

2428
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:51,950
Save me!

2429
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:52,410
Save me!

2430
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:52,790
Please!

2431
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:56,850
Look it!

2432
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,310
I see you!

2433
01:23:59,450 --> 01:23:59,530
I see you!

2434
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:03,510
Get out of the vase room!

2435
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:04,970
Get out of the vase room!

2436
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:06,650
Just leave that room!

2437
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:08,570
I can't find it.

2438
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:10,670
Get out of the vase room!

2439
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:12,350
Please!

2440
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:14,370
Yusak!

2441
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,370
I wanna leave!

2442
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:18,850
Yusak, I wanna leave that!

2443
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:21,350
Get out!

2444
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:24,430
Get out?

2445
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:26,330
Get out of the vase room!

2446
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:29,650
Leave the vase room!

2447
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:31,390
Leave that room!

2448
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:33,110
I swear I'll leave!

2449
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,670
Wait, I heard...

2450
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:36,350
I heard this.

2451
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:36,690
Wait.

2452
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:38,810
I heard something.

2453
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,130
Base room.

2454
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:46,890
What are you talking about?

2455
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:48,630
Just leave that room!

2456
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:51,190
Get out of that room!

2457
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,870
Get out of the area!

2458
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,390
Please!

2459
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:57,050
Please!

2460
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,150
Wait!

2461
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:00,450
Ducky?

2462
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:01,390
Where are you?

2463
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,870
Okay, I'm in the chest box right now.

2464
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:04,570
I'm in the upper chest.

2465
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:05,130
Okay, we're out!

2466
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:05,770
We're out!

2467
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:06,370
We did it!

2468
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:06,670
Yusak!

2469
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:07,710
Turn around!

2470
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:08,350
I'm here!

2471
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,590
Turn around!

2472
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:10,210
Okay, no!

2473
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,630
Let's go!

2474
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:12,410
You don't have to use the radio!

2475
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:13,750
We did it!

2476
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,330
We got out of the room!

2477
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,050
That's all I wanted!

2478
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:19,530
I just wanted to leave that room!

2479
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:20,810
I...

2480
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,550
We're out of the room!

2481
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,910
I used the ball thing that I'm killing now.

2482
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:27,570
I'm in the water.

2483
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:28,350
This is insane.

2484
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:29,250
Here, there's more anxiety.

2485
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:30,110
I found a hand!

2486
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:31,850
And I found Almond Water.

2487
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:33,710
Oh my god!

2488
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:36,050
We're finally out of the room!

2489
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:37,570
We did it!

2490
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:39,350
We did it!

2491
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,150
We're out of the fucking room!

2492
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:43,590
This game's fucking hard, yo!

2493
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:44,610
Yeah!

2494
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,770
Why does everybody love to play this game?

2495
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,910
It's fucking hard!

2496
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:51,790
Yusak, I just need you to know...

2497
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:53,350
We're on easy mode!

2498
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:54,630
No!

2499
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:57,290
No!

2500
01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:58,390
No!

2501
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:00,730
Oh my god!

2502
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:02,810
This is easy mode!

2503
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:05,150
We spent almost an hour to...

2504
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:05,250
Oh!

2505
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:08,290
Read note.

2506
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:09,530
Radiation room.

2507
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:10,490
There's a locked door.

2508
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:13,370
We don't have...

2509
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:14,650
We don't have a radiation...

2510
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:16,110
We don't have anything to protect ourselves.

2511
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:16,790
We need the protection suits.

2512
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:17,390
Yeah, yeah.

2513
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:18,070
Come over here.

2514
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:20,050
Oh my god.

2515
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:23,590
This is a tutorial and it's easy!

2516
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:25,650
This is a tutorial and it's easy!

2517
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:26,250
Radiation hosu.

2518
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:29,450
Radiation hosu.

2519
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:31,130
Oh my god.

2520
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:32,910
Oh my god.

2521
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:36,390
I didn't want to tell you until now.

2522
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:37,750
I didn't want to tell you until now.

2523
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:38,330
Oh my god.

2524
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:40,830
We've been on easy this entire time.

2525
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:42,350
I don't believe that.

2526
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:43,990
I don't believe that.

2527
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,930
We are 100% on easy mode.

2528
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:48,010
We are 100% on easy mode.

2529
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:49,950
Okay, we need to figure out how to find the door.

2530
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:56,690
We need to figure out how to find the door.

2531
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:56,690
Oh my god.

2532
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:57,390
Did you see the red light?

2533
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:00,210
No, I didn't see that.

2534
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:02,710
I think there's a bug on my game screen.

2535
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:05,690
There's a red light.

2536
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:06,070
No.

2537
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:08,350
It's not there.

2538
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:08,830
It's not there.

2539
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:09,670
It's fine.

2540
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,090
It's fine.

2541
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:10,910
It's fine.

2542
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:11,230
It's fine.

2543
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,430
Okay.

2544
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:16,500
Okay.

2545
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,040
Okay, here we're good.

2546
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:17,320
We're good.

2547
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,360
We need to find the red door.

2548
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,880
Okay, we're back in the body's room.

2549
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,120
This is not the door room.

2550
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,540
But I remember Yeah?

2551
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,960
The red door is just...

2552
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,280
It's supposed to be around here.

2553
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2554
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,120
Okay, I'll follow you.

2555
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,120
You find it.

2556
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,920
You're so good at finding the door.

2557
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:37,660
No.

2558
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:38,960
No.

2559
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,280
I am really good at dodging dogs.

2560
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,420
But you found the dog.

2561
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,820
You found the door like three times before.

2562
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,780
How did we do that?

2563
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:49,700
I don't know.

2564
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,920
I'm following you.

2565
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,760
How did we do that?

2566
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:54,100
I don't remember.

2567
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,500
I don't...

2568
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,440
Is it here?

2569
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:58,460
I don't know.

2570
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,840
I'm just following you.

2571
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,060
No, this is the tutorial.

2572
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,160
We're back in the...

2573
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:09,960
I also think you're really good at finding the tutorial.

2574
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,100
Here, here, here.

2575
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:13,660
You know why?

2576
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,100
Can I make some excuse?

2577
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:16,460
Oh my... wait, wait.

2578
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,960
There is the bug on my game.

2579
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,900
Wait, I can...

2580
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,080
I can spray paint and...

2581
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,740
Oh my god, wait.

2582
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:24,940
Wait, how do I spray paint?

2583
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,060
Oh my god, wait, wait, wait.

2584
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,440
How do I spray paint?

2585
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:30,220
How do I use this?

2586
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,400
Wait, look, look, I can...

2587
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,540
Oh my god, yeah.

2588
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:35,660
What is it for?

2589
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:38,780
I can use this to tell us where to go.

2590
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,240
Oh my god, wait, wait, wait.

2591
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,500
V, change image.

2592
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:42,520
Okay.

2593
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,460
That's awesome.

2594
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:46,040
Okay.

2595
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,180
How do I do this?

2596
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:51,580
Beware, exit.

2597
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:54,880
Look at that, look at that.

2598
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,380
Look at this.

2599
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,200
Yeah, yeah, how do you...

2600
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2601
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,440
Oh my god, we should have done this.

2602
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,840
Why did we do this?

2603
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:04,780
Why did...

2604
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:06,340
Why was it so hard?

2605
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:06,860
Oh my god.

2606
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,640
Why were we so stupid?

2607
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:11,760
Why were we so stupid?

2608
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,160
We didn't know how to play this game.

2609
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,340
Okay, alright.

2610
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,280
We figured it out.

2611
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,360
Oh my god.

2612
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,360
Okay, okay.

2613
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:25,500
Alright, we figured out how to use this.

2614
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:28,040
Okay, the moment we find the door...

2615
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:28,280
Okay, the moment we find the door...

2616
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,220
Wait, what?

2617
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:31,420
Can we splay this...

2618
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,640
hallway just in case?

2619
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,520
How do I do that?

2620
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,040
I don't know, you're the one that did it.

2621
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:37,800
Just to make sure.

2622
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,260
Why do we need to spray this hallway?

2623
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:41,700
What is this hallway gonna be?

2624
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,960
Just to make sure that we're not getting lost again.

2625
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:45,200
Okay, but they don't have...

2626
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,140
Why are they all ones?

2627
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,100
I don't know.

2628
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,700
Wait, it's not here.

2629
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:50,500
This wasn't it.

2630
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,880
We figured out how to use the spray paint though.

2631
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,440
Yeah, awesome.

2632
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,900
You know you can change the picture.

2633
01:29:59,440 --> 01:29:59,880
You know you can change the picture.

2634
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,680
No, I just wanna make sure we've been here already.

2635
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:02,980
No, I just wanna make sure we've been here already.

2636
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:03,260
You know?

2637
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:05,540
Ah!

2638
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:07,140
Ah!

2639
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,940
Oh my god.

2640
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:30,570
Everything is just one.

2641
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,310
Everything is just one.

2642
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:35,850
Oh my

2643
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:42,780
god.

2644
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,700
Oh my god.

2645
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,160
You suck!

2646
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,440
Oh my god.

2647
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,160
Oh my god.

2648
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,340
Is your son dead?

2649
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,940
I don't know guys.

2650
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,460
Do you think your son is okay?

2651
01:30:59,120 --> 01:30:59,760
Guys.

2652
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,580
Do you think they're okay?

2653
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,100
Guys.

2654
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,080
I can't tell.

2655
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,960
Oh my god.

2656
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,900
Oh my god.

2657
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:16,700
You son!

2658
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,320
You son!

2659
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:22,200
Find the door!

2660
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,360
Find the...

2661
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,880
The white...

2662
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:33,950
Look.

2663
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:38,470
I'm not gonna say that it's my fault.

2664
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:40,230
All I'm saying is that...

2665
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:43,090
The locker was right there.

2666
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,930
And either of us could have got it.

2667
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:46,710
And either of us could have got it.

2668
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:54,650
It was a 50-50 in getting the door.

2669
01:31:54,970 --> 01:31:55,490
It was a 50-50 in getting the door.

2670
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:56,630
It's not my fault.

2671
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,810
It's not my fault.

2672
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:01,070
That was your fault.

2673
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:01,490
Are you okay?

2674
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:02,630
How is it my fault?

2675
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:03,330
No.

2676
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:03,810
No!

2677
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,230
I'm not okay!

2678
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:07,430
How is that my fault?

2679
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:08,390
You did it!

2680
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:10,450
You were the one that didn't get the door!

2681
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:11,390
The locker!

2682
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:14,430
I died four times already in this round.

2683
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:14,890
You know?

2684
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:15,170
Yeah!

2685
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,230
That's... that sucks!

2686
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:23,570
But that's not my fault.

2687
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:24,470
I don't think it's this way.

2688
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:25,150
I think...

2689
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:27,270
I think it's like...

2690
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:29,050
Somewhere in one of these corridors.

2691
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:29,990
Maybe this one?

2692
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:31,590
Okay.

2693
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:35,970
No, this is the body one.

2694
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:39,050
This is the body... Maybe this one?

2695
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:39,970
Lisa.

2696
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:41,690
Where'd you go?

2697
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:42,790
This one, this one, this one.

2698
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:46,170
Wait, this is the one where you spray-painted one.

2699
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:47,550
So it's definitely not this.

2700
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:48,810
Not here.

2701
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,450
Is it here?

2702
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:52,450
No, this is the... It's the TV.

2703
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,690
We keep going to the TV.

2704
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:56,770
Wow, you're memorizing the map.

2705
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:57,430
Nice.

2706
01:32:57,690 --> 01:32:58,030
Okay.

2707
01:32:58,890 --> 01:33:00,250
There's red, there's red light.

2708
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,570
There's red light, there's red light.

2709
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,610
You saw there's red light there.

2710
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:03,290
There's red light.

2711
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,410
There's red light.

2712
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:07,990
I really hate it!

2713
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:10,770
You know, I think there's the game bug on my screen.

2714
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:12,410
I think so too, cause...

2715
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:14,390
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, I see him.

2716
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:15,430
I see him.

2717
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,090
He's like walking over.

2718
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:20,930
It's gone, it's fine.

2719
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,330
It's fine.

2720
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:24,530
Woah, you see that?

2721
01:33:26,370 --> 01:33:27,110
You see that?

2722
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:29,850
Yeah, do you see it?

2723
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,190
Oh wait, I'm getting crazy looking at it.

2724
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:34,070
Don't look at it!

2725
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:37,190
Don't look at it by the way.

2726
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,110
There's like...

2727
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:39,530
Oh, it's gone, it's gone.

2728
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:39,890
Okay.

2729
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:41,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2730
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:43,090
I was like, you see that?

2731
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:43,970
Wait, never.

2732
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:48,830
I heard something instead.

2733
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:49,630
There's a horse room.

2734
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:50,890
Wait, did you finish the horse?

2735
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:52,450
Yeah, we finished the horse.

2736
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:54,090
We did, we did.

2737
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2738
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,430
In this room, we got the screwdriver.

2739
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:58,810
Wait, there's a...

2740
01:33:58,810 --> 01:33:59,810
Wait, I found a nose!

2741
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:01,970
Yeah, there's a nose.

2742
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:02,830
Do you need albin water?

2743
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:04,330
There's albin water right here.

2744
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:06,910
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

2745
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:08,930
Yeah, there's albin water.

2746
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,890
Oh my god, we got the nose.

2747
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:12,270
Awesome.

2748
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:15,330
Alright, we're figuring it out.

2749
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,690
I didn't know that that was a nose.

2750
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:20,730
I thought that was something else.

2751
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:22,370
Okay, we were here before.

2752
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:23,690
I remember this.

2753
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:24,990
Okay.

2754
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:27,530
Where the fuck is the red door?

2755
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:30,190
I don't remember!

2756
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:33,190
We found it so many times!

2757
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:34,750
Here.

2758
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:36,030
Okay, here.

2759
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:37,390
This is the dog room.

2760
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:39,110
We don't need to go back to the dog room.

2761
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:39,750
Oh, yo.

2762
01:34:39,870 --> 01:34:40,490
Oh, yo.

2763
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:42,870
That's the dog room.

2764
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:44,150
Okay.

2765
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:44,990
Okay.

2766
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,530
We don't have the... go to the clock.

2767
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:49,170
We don't have the clock arms, though.

2768
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:49,970
Guys.

2769
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:52,310
I don't have the arms for the clock.

2770
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:56,070
Okay, we have the nose.

2771
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:58,110
Where the fuck...

2772
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:58,590
Alright, chat.

2773
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:00,930
Do you guys remember where the red door is?

2774
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:02,050
It's to you.

2775
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,330
Chat, wait, wait, I can't breathe.

2776
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:08,330
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

2777
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:09,490
There's a face in there.

2778
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:11,470
There is a face in there.

2779
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:13,110
No, I don't see that.

2780
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:14,350
I don't see that.

2781
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:16,010
He's still there, he's still there, he's still there.

2782
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:17,110
He's still there.

2783
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,670
Don't look at it.

2784
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:23,190
Are we gonna go insane if we look at their face?

2785
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:23,650
Yeah, yeah.

2786
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:26,070
If we look at the face, we go crazy.

2787
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:27,930
Okay, it's gone, it's gone.

2788
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:28,930
Okay.

2789
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:32,990
I'm pretty sure... I found the body room.

2790
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:33,390
Guys!

2791
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:34,910
Who has no nose?

2792
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:37,390
Who has no nose?

2793
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:38,130
Okay.

2794
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:38,370
Eyes.

2795
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:40,630
Just eyes.

2796
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:46,350
I bet, you know, we're gonna use the red key and open the door and there's gonna be the eyes.

2797
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:47,730
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2798
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:49,050
Right?

2799
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:50,750
I think so.

2800
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:53,170
It has to be because our next one is the key.

2801
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:56,450
We just don't know where the door is.

2802
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:57,470
This one, this one.

2803
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:58,850
We can't find the fucking door.

2804
01:35:58,850 --> 01:35:59,410
This guy, this guy.

2805
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:01,570
Alright, got it.

2806
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:02,270
I got Malcolm.

2807
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:02,810
Okay.

2808
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:03,730
Alright.

2809
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:06,590
One more.

2810
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:07,830
Okay, wait, wait.

2811
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,250
Mark this.

2812
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,930
Mark this area.

2813
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:09,530
How far are we?

2814
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:12,850
We should mark this area to remember the... Can you change the picture?

2815
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:14,290
Okay, okay, okay.

2816
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:15,230
Change the picture to something?

2817
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:16,850
Okay.

2818
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:17,670
How about this?

2819
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:19,830
Can't all be ones.

2820
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:21,750
It can be, yeah.

2821
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:22,570
Change picture.

2822
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:23,350
Change color.

2823
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:23,930
Wait, wait.

2824
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:26,130
They can't all be ones.

2825
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:26,570
Okay.

2826
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:27,850
That's still a one.

2827
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:28,450
But okay.

2828
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,110
How about that?

2829
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:31,550
I guess so.

2830
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:33,950
Good enough, right?

2831
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:35,750
That's good enough, yeah.

2832
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:38,470
That works, that works.

2833
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:39,750
It's not a nose.

2834
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:40,570
That's for sure.

2835
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,230
I'm trying to figure out...

2836
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,470
We know that we've been there.

2837
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:48,230
Yeah, at least we know that's the fucking...

2838
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:51,350
Where the fuck is the door?

2839
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:53,390
I can't...

2840
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:54,810
We need something.

2841
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:58,070
We need someone who's actually a genius to play this game.

2842
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:59,210
We need to find the door!

2843
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:01,170
Where is the door?

2844
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:02,410
Door!

2845
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,990
Where is the...

2846
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:06,410
I'm at the tutorial.

2847
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:11,830
Oh my god.

2848
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:12,370
Come on, follow me, follow me.

2849
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:13,050
Just follow me.

2850
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:14,230
Just follow me.

2851
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:14,810
Just trust me.

2852
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:14,910
It's gonna work.

2853
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:15,150
Okay, I'll follow you.

2854
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:15,730
I'll trust you.

2855
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:17,550
I trust you.

2856
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:17,730
Okay.

2857
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:18,690
Okay.

2858
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:20,810
It's gonna work.

2859
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:21,370
Yeah.

2860
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:23,530
I'm running out of my stamina.

2861
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:26,190
I'm trusting you right now.

2862
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:27,250
It's red.

2863
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:28,710
Yeah.

2864
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:30,850
Okay.

2865
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:32,670
We did it!

2866
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:33,470
Oh my god!

2867
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:34,570
I knew I could trust...

2868
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:35,950
I knew I could... Told you!

2869
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:38,230
You always know where the door is!

2870
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:40,010
We should've followed you!

2871
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:41,910
I should've believed myself, not you.

2872
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:43,050
You should've believed yourself!

2873
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:46,130
Okay, they said... Look at the painting.

2874
01:37:46,290 --> 01:37:47,330
There might be a code.

2875
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:53,250
They said the painting has a code.

2876
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:53,750
There might be a code inside.

2877
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,510
How do we look?

2878
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:57,030
I don't know.

2879
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:59,690
How do we... How?

2880
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:01,610
How?

2881
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:03,510
How do we figure it out?

2882
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,030
They're like, the painting has a code.

2883
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:10,310
I don't see any numbers here.

2884
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:10,590
I don't see anything.

2885
01:38:11,110 --> 01:38:11,930
Did you just...

2886
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:12,790
Wait, I see it!

2887
01:38:12,850 --> 01:38:13,290
I see it!

2888
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:14,250
What?

2889
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:15,750
Come here, come here, come here!

2890
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:17,350
Look at this!

2891
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:20,830
I'm looking at it.

2892
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:21,950
You're not seeing it?

2893
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:23,230
Like, this angle.

2894
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:24,610
It's like red!

2895
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:25,130
This angle.

2896
01:38:26,530 --> 01:38:27,430
I don't see that.

2897
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:28,210
You don't see it?

2898
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:28,710
Wait!

2899
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:30,130
Yeah, you see it?

2900
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:30,390
Oh!

2901
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:34,370
Okay, I see... What does it say?

2902
01:38:35,470 --> 01:38:36,370
Is that an A?

2903
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:39,350
What is this?

2904
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:40,690
Is it... Is it L?

2905
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:42,050
What is that?

2906
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:42,410
L.

2907
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:43,830
A.

2908
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:44,490
L?

2909
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:44,670
Okay.

2910
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:45,530
L, A.

2911
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:47,050
R.

2912
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:48,690
R?

2913
01:38:49,450 --> 01:38:49,850
O.

2914
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:51,390
O?

2915
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:52,470
M.

2916
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:53,550
What is that spell?

2917
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:56,110
I don't know.

2918
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:57,130
I am not a namespeaker.

2919
01:38:57,130 --> 01:38:57,610
I don't know what that spells either.

2920
01:38:58,030 --> 01:38:59,030
Don't worry, chat will know.

2921
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:00,270
Wait, what is that?

2922
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:01,410
I got fingers!

2923
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:03,270
LMAO!

2924
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,750
LMAO!

2925
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:04,210
LMAO?

2926
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:04,750
Is it this?

2927
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:06,650
Guys, is it LMAO?

2928
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:07,590
Guys!

2929
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:13,450
Is it LMAO?

2930
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:15,710
Oh, it's moral.

2931
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:16,430
Okay.

2932
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:18,790
Okay, I figured it out.

2933
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:20,170
It's moral.

2934
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:22,350
Okay, guys.

2935
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:23,070
Thank you.

2936
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:24,250
It's LMAO.

2937
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:25,050
Thank you.

2938
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:26,890
Oh my god.

2939
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:30,410
I still don't know how 1987 was the answer.

2940
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:31,110
I'm gonna miss myself.

2941
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:32,230
And I'll never know.

2942
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:33,990
Moral.

2943
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,470
Okay.

2944
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:37,710
Where the fuck is L?

2945
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:39,830
L.

2946
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,250
Oh, here it is.

2947
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:43,550
Nice.

2948
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:44,910
Whoa.

2949
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:46,030
Oh yeah, get the almond water.

2950
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:47,990
I got fused.

2951
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:48,810
No, I can't take it anymore.

2952
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:49,890
I got too much water.

2953
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:50,810
Oh, you got too much water.

2954
01:39:50,830 --> 01:39:51,590
Okay, I got it.

2955
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:54,630
I got a few fuses.

2956
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:56,890
And moon jelly.

2957
01:39:57,290 --> 01:39:57,650
Pick up moly jelly.

2958
01:39:58,270 --> 01:39:59,990
What the fuck do I do with the fuses?

2959
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:01,770
In the fuse box.

2960
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:02,330
Okay.

2961
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:06,350
Wait, but like, what do we...

2962
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:07,730
Where do we go next?

2963
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:09,930
I feel like we did so many things.

2964
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:11,950
What else are we missing?

2965
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:15,770
Chat!

2966
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:19,130
I don't know anymore.

2967
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:20,690
I don't know what to do anymore.

2968
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:22,510
Where was the fuse room?

2969
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:24,590
There was a fuse room?

2970
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:25,870
There was?

2971
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:26,650
Was there?

2972
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:27,730
I don't know.

2973
01:40:27,850 --> 01:40:30,130
I don't think I've ever seen the fuse room.

2974
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:31,090
I've never seen it before.

2975
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:32,430
So I think we don't have to go...

2976
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:35,070
We don't have to come back here anymore, isn't it?

2977
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:36,790
I don't know.

2978
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:39,590
I don't think...

2979
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:40,190
You know what?

2980
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:42,910
What about we just gonna stick in that room first?

2981
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:43,770
But like...

2982
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:45,430
But like...

2983
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:46,130
We're...

2984
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,490
Let's go back.

2985
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:50,310
But like, what do we do?

2986
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:52,950
We need to find clock hands.

2987
01:40:53,190 --> 01:40:55,290
But where the fuck are the clock hands?

2988
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:57,550
We're gonna figure it out later.

2989
01:40:58,070 --> 01:40:59,130
It's at 1.

2990
01:40:59,330 --> 01:40:59,810
Okay.

2991
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:03,870
Oh, we still need the body parts now.

2992
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:05,830
We need to figure out all the...

2993
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:08,370
All the...

2994
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:08,830
Okay.

2995
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:09,870
Wait, wait, wait.

2996
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,310
Where was the red room again?

2997
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:12,710
I just wanna make sure to...

2998
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:14,550
Use the spray can to, you know...

2999
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:16,070
This is it.

3000
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:17,750
This is it.

3001
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:18,290
There's a monster here.

3002
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:19,670
Oh my god.

3003
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:20,710
No, no, no, no.

3004
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:21,670
AHHHHH!

3005
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:42,710
Are you okay?

3006
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:45,810
Chat!

3007
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:47,410
Yeah?

3008
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:49,830
I'm still alive!

3009
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:50,530
Yay!

3010
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:53,790
Okay.

3011
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:56,290
I wanna make sure we didn't miss anything.

3012
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:57,370
I'm gonna go back in.

3013
01:41:58,050 --> 01:41:58,570
Yeah.

3014
01:41:59,130 --> 01:42:01,930
I wanna be sure we didn't miss anything in the...

3015
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:03,390
In this room.

3016
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,670
Cause I don't wanna come back here.

3017
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,210
And this way is pretty simple.

3018
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:08,530
I mean...

3019
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:10,450
Yeah, these are just lockers, so...

3020
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:12,270
There's a cat here.

3021
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:13,410
Hello, little kitty.

3022
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:14,750
Yeah, there's nothing here.

3023
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:17,490
There's nothing in the drawers, too.

3024
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:19,430
Alright, we didn't miss anything.

3025
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,050
Nice.

3026
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:21,370
Awesome.

3027
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:21,810
Wait!

3028
01:42:22,290 --> 01:42:23,250
What is that?

3029
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:25,170
Is that a porn?

3030
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:26,510
No, it's a cat!

3031
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:27,210
It's a pussy!

3032
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:31,010
Pussy in my...

3033
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:32,750
My pussy in bio.

3034
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:36,890
My pussy in bio.

3035
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:39,830
Okay.

3036
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:42,990
Alright, we got... What do we do next, chat?

3037
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:45,630
We don't know where the claw cans are!

3038
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:47,810
What's in your inventory?

3039
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,090
Do you have any claw cans?

3040
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:51,010
What's in your inventory?

3041
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:52,770
Wait, let me check.

3042
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:57,190
No, I have screwdriver, uh, splay can, I have moly jelly...

3043
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:58,470
Okay, I have that, too.

3044
01:42:58,470 --> 01:42:59,870
Yeah, I have all that.

3045
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:02,250
I don't know where else to go.

3046
01:43:02,670 --> 01:43:04,410
I feel like we went so...

3047
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:05,370
Wait, okay, I'll fo...

3048
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:07,130
The dog's here!

3049
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:07,650
The dog's here!

3050
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:09,830
The dog's to our right.

3051
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:12,750
The dog's there!

3052
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:15,390
The dog's here!

3053
01:43:15,470 --> 01:43:16,390
I saw the dog!

3054
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:17,990
I saw the dog!

3055
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:20,930
I saw the dog!

3056
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:22,270
I saw the dog!

3057
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:24,630
I saw the dog!

3058
01:43:25,190 --> 01:43:26,370
We're back in the tutorial.

3059
01:43:27,110 --> 01:43:27,630
We're back!

3060
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:28,450
We're back!

3061
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:29,890
Oh, it's back in the tutorial!

3062
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:30,450
I'm out of here!

3063
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:31,230
Seriously!

3064
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:33,830
Okay.

3065
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:34,850
Okay, follow me!

3066
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:41,930
I'm just gonna try my wild I'm just gonna try my success.

3067
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:45,350
We'll never get out of the tutorial!

3068
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:47,630
Not here, not here, not here, not here.

3069
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:49,470
Not here, not here, not here.

3070
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:51,070
I'm running out of pills!

3071
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:53,370
I'm running out!

3072
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:57,150
What about here?

3073
01:43:57,290 --> 01:43:58,010
What about here?

3074
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:00,730
Where will we leave the tutorial?

3075
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:01,850
What about here?

3076
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:04,330
Okay, it's a radiation room here again.

3077
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:08,250
Yeah, but we can't go to the radiation room because we'll get radiated.

3078
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:12,130
Let me mark it.

3079
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:14,810
Let me mark the radiation room just in case.

3080
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:16,630
How do we know if it's the radiation room?

3081
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,110
You know...

3082
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:24,090
Equip, use...

3083
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:24,670
Okay.

3084
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:25,210
Oh!

3085
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:28,070
We can find the...

3086
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:30,590
The... the vase room.

3087
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:31,350
Remember the vase room?

3088
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,420
Why is the dog always here?

3089
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:39,780
Why is

3090
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:44,860
the dog always here?

3091
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:44,940
Why is the dog always here?

3092
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,140
Oh, God!

3093
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,620
Leave us alone!

3094
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,020
Leave us alone!

3095
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:58,090
Please!

3096
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:58,500
Please!

3097
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:03,760
I don't have a lot of Alvin wine!

3098
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:03,940
I don't have a lot of Alvin wine!

3099
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:04,240
I don't have a lot of water!

3100
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:06,500
Eeeeee!

3101
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:16,410
I just wanted to get out of the tutorial!

3102
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:19,210
Why is the tutorial so high?

3103
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:21,170
Why is the tutorial so high?

3104
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:22,910
Why is the tutorial so high?

3105
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:28,980
Alright.

3106
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:31,720
We figured this out.

3107
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:35,080
I'm in the chest room.

3108
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:36,460
I'm in the chest room.

3109
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:38,560
I found the clock hands!

3110
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:43,830
Okay, guys.

3111
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:44,530
What is the numbers?

3112
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,590
We don't need a figure.

3113
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:46,770
We can do this together.

3114
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:50,790
Yes, we don't need the clue.

3115
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:52,010
Get us out of the tutorial.

3116
01:45:52,830 --> 01:45:54,530
Guys, we don't need the clue.

3117
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:57,630
We don't need to actually solve this.

3118
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:00,350
Just hand me the numbers right now.

3119
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:05,130
It can't be 1015!

3120
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:06,590
That's the fucking clock!

3121
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:12,420
It can't!

3122
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:14,500
I knew it was a 1015.

3123
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:17,100
There's no way it's 1987!

3124
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:18,780
Again!

3125
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:20,000
Please, please!

3126
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:20,720
Please!

3127
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:25,220
Oh my God!

3128
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:25,860
Look here!

3129
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:28,460
Okay, in the chest room, right?

3130
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,220
I found you!

3131
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,420
There's red outside.

3132
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,380
You should come in.

3133
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:34,260
You should come in.

3134
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:35,500
I see red light.

3135
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:39,580
We're trying to figure out the passcode for this.

3136
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,100
I don't know why I'm in the end room.

3137
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:42,080
It's not 1980!

3138
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,200
Everyone's like, it's 1980!

3139
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:45,720
I swear to God it's not 1987!

3140
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:47,820
I swear to God!

3141
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:48,440
I swear to God!

3142
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:50,720
I knew it!

3143
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:51,860
I fucking knew it!

3144
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,640
I fucking knew it was a 1987!

3145
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:56,380
I fucking knew it was a 1987!

3146
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,160
Okay, I found the clock hat!

3147
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,420
Do you remember where the horse is?

3148
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:00,920
Yeah, boom!

3149
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,200
Here?

3150
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:05,860
Here?

3151
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:09,320
Here?

3152
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,480
Wait, why is my flashlight...

3153
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,300
Oh, I cut it off.

3154
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:15,980
Around here!

3155
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,640
Around here?

3156
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:18,900
Around here!

3157
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,320
Are you sure?

3158
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:22,780
I don't think that's...

3159
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:25,720
No, it's not here.

3160
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,240
I think...

3161
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,320
I don't think that's...

3162
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:30,720
I think it's back here.

3163
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:33,320
I'm pretty sure.

3164
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:34,980
I found it.

3165
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,680
I knew it.

3166
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:36,580
Yay!

3167
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,840
I was correct!

3168
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,460
I don't think you knew the way.

3169
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,360
I don't think you knew the way.

3170
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:43,860
No, you were not correct.

3171
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:46,640
That was absolutely...

3172
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:49,380
You were not correct.

3173
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,940
There was no way.

3174
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,880
I was halfway correct.

3175
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,820
No, you were not.

3176
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,720
Come on, you can solve this game alone.

3177
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,840
I swear to God.

3178
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:01,380
Wait, how do we...

3179
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:04,720
How do we do the clock?

3180
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,560
How do we...

3181
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:08,300
Rotate it?

3182
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:09,620
I'm trying!

3183
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,560
I can't get it!

3184
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,160
Oh, it's back here!

3185
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:14,800
Wait, what?

3186
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:16,100
Oh, back?

3187
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:16,640
Okay.

3188
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:19,200
Where was it?

3189
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:19,480
Oh!

3190
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,140
Okay.

3191
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,660
Is it 10?

3192
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:24,140
It's 10.

3193
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,480
Is it on 10?

3194
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:28,160
It's on 10.

3195
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,520
Okay, is this on 5?

3196
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:30,600
Let me know when it's on 5.

3197
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:33,280
Okay, so the short one is on 10.

3198
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,280
And the long one is on 5 right now.

3199
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:36,380
Oh, okay.

3200
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:39,160
Is the long one on 10 yet?

3201
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:40,960
No, wait, wait.

3202
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,140
The long one is on 5, right?

3203
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:44,020
The long one is on 5.

3204
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:44,740
Yeah, okay.

3205
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:45,600
Is this on 10?

3206
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:47,380
No, 7.

3207
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:50,320
10?

3208
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:50,820
5.

3209
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,140
5.

3210
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:54,700
3, 2.

3211
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:57,540
Oh my God, where the fuck is...

3212
01:48:58,420 --> 01:49:00,000
Just go, almost there.

3213
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:01,540
12, 11, 10!

3214
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:03,720
Okay, this is short.

3215
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:04,900
Is this on 15?

3216
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:08,800
The short one, right?

3217
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:09,800
I need long one.

3218
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:10,300
Long.

3219
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:10,860
Long, long.

3220
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:13,260
I need 15.

3221
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:13,960
I heard something!

3222
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:16,320
12.

3223
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,280
I'm hearing something!

3224
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,700
Shh, it's the dog.

3225
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:25,760
3, 2, 1.

3226
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:27,860
12.

3227
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,080
11.

3228
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:31,660
10.

3229
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:32,500
9.

3230
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,220
Where the fuck is 15?

3231
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:35,740
7.

3232
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:39,400
Wait, 15, 3!

3233
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:40,440
You gotta put a...

3234
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:40,720
Put it on 3.

3235
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,040
3, 3.

3236
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:44,720
Okay.

3237
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:45,780
2, 1.

3238
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,100
1, 1, 2.

3239
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:48,900
3, there we go.

3240
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:49,700
Okay.

3241
01:49:53,070 --> 01:49:53,990
Oh my God.

3242
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:57,030
We're asking such a stupid question.

3243
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:58,750
Wait, that's the short one!

3244
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:01,830
The long one!

3245
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:04,030
The short one has to be on 10!

3246
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:06,090
And the long one has to be on 3!

3247
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,350
And the long one has to be on 3!

3248
01:50:09,890 --> 01:50:11,910
And the long one has to be on 3!

3249
01:50:11,910 --> 01:50:15,310
The short one is on 2 right now.

3250
01:50:15,330 --> 01:50:15,530
The short one is on 2 right now.

3251
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:17,830
Okay, I need the short one to be on 10.

3252
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:18,730
I...

3253
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:22,190
11.

3254
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:24,110
That's so stupid.

3255
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:24,830
10.

3256
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:25,430
Okay, now 10.

3257
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:26,030
We're so...

3258
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:29,770
Oh my God, we're both so dumb.

3259
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:30,790
1.

3260
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:32,250
2.

3261
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:33,710
3.

3262
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:34,970
Yeah, we did it!

3263
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:36,350
Yay!

3264
01:50:38,330 --> 01:50:39,230
What the fuck?

3265
01:50:39,950 --> 01:50:41,990
You're pretty bad at listening.

3266
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:43,290
What do you mean?

3267
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:46,150
Okay, 3, 7, 0, 8.

3268
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:49,490
Okay, we gotta go back to the dog room.

3269
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:52,450
3, 7, 0, 8.

3270
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:53,450
Oh my God.

3271
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:54,950
The dog room.

3272
01:50:55,050 --> 01:50:55,790
Here, right?

3273
01:50:55,910 --> 01:50:56,390
Here?

3274
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:00,150
It's supposed to be here.

3275
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:01,070
Right?

3276
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:02,690
Here, yeah, this way, this way.

3277
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:04,850
Oh my God.

3278
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:05,290
Oh my God.

3279
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:07,150
AHHHHH!

3280
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,300
Ooooooooh.

3281
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:18,840
Oh.

3282
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:21,800
Are you fucking kidding me?

3283
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:23,240
Yeah.

3284
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:25,800
Oh.

3285
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:27,860
Oh.

3286
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:29,840
Oh.

3287
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:31,640
Oh.

3288
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,060
You so...

3289
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:35,140
Where are you?

3290
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:36,540
Where are you?

3291
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:39,440
I used the mobile thing.

3292
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,880
Where are you now?

3293
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:42,000
Oh.

3294
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:43,400
I'm...

3295
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:46,260
I'm freaking out.

3296
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,980
I'm freaking out.

3297
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:49,060
Are you fucking kidding...

3298
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:50,740
Everything is trying to kill me.

3299
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:53,300
Everything is trying to kill me.

3300
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:54,560
Leave me the fuck alone!

3301
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:00,460
Oh.

3302
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:02,360
Is it gone now?

3303
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:03,740
Is it...

3304
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,540
Is it gone now?

3305
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,660
Guys, I don't think it was gone.

3306
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:24,680
I don't think...

3307
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:29,620
I don't think...

3308
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:30,000
I don't think...

3309
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:33,040
Guys, I have all the good thi...

3310
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:34,580
I have all the stuff right now.

3311
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:36,040
I can't die.

3312
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:39,360
If I die, all of my stuff will be gone.

3313
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:40,840
Look, this is important.

3314
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,760
I have a lot of the stuff right now.

3315
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:43,180
Okay?

3316
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:46,160
I need to make sure I don't die.

3317
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,280
I need to make sure...

3318
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:54,440
Are you okay?

3319
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:57,060
Are you alive?

3320
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:57,600
You're alive!

3321
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,820
Okay, let's go to the...

3322
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:01,340
Let's go to the dog room.

3323
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:02,740
This game is not okay.

3324
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:03,900
We're fine.

3325
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:04,840
We're fine.

3326
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:06,080
Oh my god.

3327
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,340
Okay, we gotta run to the dog room.

3328
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:11,560
3708

3329
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:15,620
Okay.

3330
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:16,360
We're here.

3331
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,760
Okay, 3... 7...

3332
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,640
I got this.

3333
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:20,920
3...

3334
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:23,280
7...

3335
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:26,460
0...

3336
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:27,080
8.

3337
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:29,220
Huh?

3338
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,720
Oh, okay.

3339
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,620
It just didn't register.

3340
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:34,820
Oh my god.

3341
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,640
We got pliers.

3342
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:37,960
What the fuck were the pliers...

3343
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:38,980
What are the pliers for?

3344
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:41,420
Progress!

3345
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:43,560
We got progress.

3346
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,580
But what is it for though?

3347
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:47,680
What is this for?

3348
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:50,240
I have no idea.

3349
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,100
The first...

3350
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:52,760
First...

3351
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:53,080
Open!

3352
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:57,020
No, no, no!

3353
01:53:58,960 --> 01:53:59,600
Close the door!

3354
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,900
Why did you close the door on yourself?

3355
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:06,120
Did I do that all by myself?

3356
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:07,460
I thought you were roasting me.

3357
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,200
No, you closed it yourself!

3358
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:12,140
I ruined it this whole time.

3359
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:13,200
Just all by my own.

3360
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,320
I was watching you close the door on yourself.

3361
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:19,680
What the fuck?

3362
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:19,780
What the fuck?

3363
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:21,360
Okay, let's go.

3364
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,340
What are we missing?

3365
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:24,020
Like an eye.

3366
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:24,940
We're missing an eye.

3367
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:25,860
We need to find...

3368
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:28,540
What do I use the pliers for though?

3369
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:29,380
I don't know.

3370
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,780
Okay, we don't have to come back here ever again.

3371
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:33,920
We're done here.

3372
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:36,420
Oh my god.

3373
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,440
Chad, help!

3374
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:39,060
What are we missing?

3375
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:41,460
Chad, help.

3376
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:42,460
Chad, please.

3377
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,580
Where do we need to go?

3378
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:47,600
We went through everything!

3379
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:48,960
Chad!

3380
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:51,380
Did we go through all that?

3381
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:54,360
Where were you heading right now?

3382
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:57,180
I left... There's no... There's a smiley face near us.

3383
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,600
Oh my god.

3384
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:03,390
That's the red door.

3385
01:55:04,590 --> 01:55:06,050
That's the body parts.

3386
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:07,010
These are body parts.

3387
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:07,950
We don't need to be here.

3388
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:10,770
Oh, mirror room!

3389
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:11,510
Mirror room!

3390
01:55:13,450 --> 01:55:14,990
Wait, they said go to the...

3391
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:15,370
I'm in the mirror room.

3392
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:17,930
We have to go to the mirror room.

3393
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:19,250
I forgot.

3394
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:22,250
Okay, I believe in you.

3395
01:55:22,330 --> 01:55:23,970
You can find the mirror room.

3396
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:25,650
Okay, six cents.

3397
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:29,790
That's like the one room we always find.

3398
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:31,350
Believe my sense.

3399
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:32,630
I believe in you.

3400
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:33,710
Yeah.

3401
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:35,790
That's the what's not there.

3402
01:55:36,690 --> 01:55:38,430
That's the dog room.

3403
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:40,030
That's the dog room.

3404
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:44,230
Yeah.

3405
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:46,030
Yeah.

3406
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:48,690
Well, we're here.

3407
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:49,130
Well, we're here.

3408
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:51,130
No, that's the tutorial.

3409
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:54,530
Here.

3410
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:55,150
Come here.

3411
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:55,450
Come here.

3412
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:58,610
It's near the tutorial room.

3413
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:01,110
Because I know it's near the tutorial room.

3414
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:04,130
That's the one room we're really good at.

3415
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:05,550
Well.

3416
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:08,650
Here.

3417
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:09,830
Here.

3418
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:10,350
Here.

3419
01:56:10,570 --> 01:56:11,310
Got it?

3420
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:15,490
Smiley face.

3421
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:16,350
Smiley.

3422
01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:17,550
It's not here.

3423
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:18,730
That's the dog room again.

3424
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:20,230
We're back in the dog room.

3425
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:22,830
We're back in the dog.

3426
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:25,490
Where the fuck is the mirror room?

3427
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,930
Okay.

3428
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:28,270
Tutorial.

3429
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:28,970
This is tutorial.

3430
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:29,750
I remember.

3431
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:30,950
This is tutorial.

3432
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:32,150
Okay.

3433
01:56:32,210 --> 01:56:32,770
They said.

3434
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:33,650
This is tutorial.

3435
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:37,350
We're literally at the tutorial again.

3436
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:41,050
We're literally at the tutorial again.

3437
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:43,190
Why are we so lost?

3438
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:43,890
For real.

3439
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:50,730
100% if there were two more people, we would have definitely solved this a lot faster.

3440
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:53,130
we would have definitely solved this a lot faster.

3441
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:54,790
As a duo, we're so fast.

3442
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:56,610
It's the tutorial!

3443
01:56:57,190 --> 01:56:57,810
It's the elevator!

3444
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:01,450
Look for the ones.

3445
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:12,100
You sad?

3446
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:15,600
You sad?

3447
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,780
You sad?

3448
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,160
You sad?

3449
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,360
Where are you?

3450
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:26,740
Where are you?

3451
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:27,200
Scared!

3452
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,000
Where is... I'm at the mirror room!

3453
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:29,560
Come here!

3454
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:30,780
Where are you?

3455
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:31,760
I'm back in the tutorial!

3456
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:32,880
Come to me!

3457
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:34,560
There was a monster!

3458
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:39,410
I'm at the beginning!

3459
01:57:43,230 --> 01:57:49,730
Oh my god!

3460
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:51,330
Where are you?

3461
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:51,990
I'm at the beginning!

3462
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:55,680
Find the ones you sad!

3463
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:58,420
Find your...

3464
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:58,920
Find your ones!

3465
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,460
You sad?

3466
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:06,720
You sad?

3467
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,040
Hello?

3468
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:19,720
You sad?

3469
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,020
You sad?

3470
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:26,460
Where are you?

3471
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:27,460
I'm at the ones!

3472
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:29,840
I'm at the ones!

3473
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:31,740
I need my taxi!

3474
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,780
Come to the mirror room!

3475
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:35,680
I don't know where the mirror room is!

3476
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:38,870
I believe in device!

3477
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:40,850
I don't believe in myself!

3478
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:43,910
Pick me up!

3479
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:44,910
Uber!

3480
01:58:45,330 --> 01:58:46,350
Pick me up!

3481
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:49,330
Now is your time to be independent!

3482
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:50,150
Now!

3483
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:51,150
I don't want to be independent!

3484
01:58:52,610 --> 01:58:54,750
You have to be independent!

3485
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:56,050
I don't want to be independent!

3486
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:57,250
No!

3487
01:58:58,690 --> 01:58:59,630
It's too scary!

3488
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:00,930
How dare you.

3489
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:02,610
You can spoil it like this.

3490
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:03,590
I found you!

3491
01:59:03,590 --> 01:59:03,890
I'm here!

3492
01:59:05,210 --> 01:59:06,310
How does this...?

3493
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:06,570
Ok...

3494
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:10,230
I did it.

3495
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:11,790
Are you proud of me?

3496
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:13,050
I did it.

3497
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:14,990
Okay, we're at the mirror room guys.

3498
01:59:15,170 --> 01:59:16,690
What do we do at the mirror room?

3499
01:59:18,270 --> 01:59:19,650
What do we do?

3500
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:22,710
We're at the mirror room!

3501
01:59:24,270 --> 01:59:25,550
We're at the mirror room.

3502
01:59:25,730 --> 01:59:26,730
Yeah, what do we do?

3503
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:29,390
We're at the mirror room.

3504
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:32,270
Smashy smashy time?

3505
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:35,130
How do I smash it?

3506
01:59:35,130 --> 01:59:37,790
Go through the mirror.

3507
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:39,590
Wait, how about the hammer?

3508
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:40,190
I don't know.

3509
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:40,570
I don't know.

3510
01:59:40,670 --> 01:59:41,990
I can't get the hammer.

3511
01:59:42,150 --> 01:59:43,070
No, it's not the hammer.

3512
01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:44,830
It's not?

3513
01:59:45,270 --> 01:59:45,750
Smash.

3514
01:59:46,030 --> 01:59:46,570
It says smash.

3515
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:47,890
You can?

3516
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:48,470
Where?

3517
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:50,450
How?

3518
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:51,150
I don't know.

3519
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:52,650
I'm pretty sure.

3520
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:53,410
Smash the mirror.

3521
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:55,490
How do you smash it?

3522
01:59:57,570 --> 01:59:59,110
Oh, body parts first.

3523
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:00,710
But where's the eye?

3524
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:03,790
We can't find the eye!

3525
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:05,550
How do we find the eye?

3526
02:00:05,910 --> 02:00:08,250
We don't know where the eye is!

3527
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:10,350
We don't know where the eye is.

3528
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:13,570
I'm just gonna make sure to mark the path.

3529
02:00:14,570 --> 02:00:15,090
Yeah.

3530
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:16,370
Yeah, use... okay.

3531
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:18,790
Okay, where the fuck's the eye?

3532
02:00:19,730 --> 02:00:22,090
The previous subject was found without a mirror.

3533
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:23,010
Okay, wait, what the fuck?

3534
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:23,670
That's the wrong...

3535
02:00:23,670 --> 02:00:26,150
I shouldn't be using this image.

3536
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:26,730
What the fuck?

3537
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:27,950
Oh my... oh, I hate that.

3538
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:32,250
Oh my god, I fucking... do you remember that last vase we never smashed?

3539
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:34,390
That had the eye in it.

3540
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:34,810
Nope.

3541
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:36,410
Nope.

3542
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:37,410
I can't believe it.

3543
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:39,630
Okay, we gotta find the vases again.

3544
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:40,570
The dog room.

3545
02:00:41,130 --> 02:00:41,610
Okay.

3546
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:42,670
I can't believe it.

3547
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:45,450
I can't fucking believe... I...

3548
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:48,410
Oh wait, did you mark it to tell us that that's the eye?

3549
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:50,510
This is the eye... mirror room?

3550
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:53,010
I think that was the... that's not the good place to mark.

3551
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:53,510
Okay.

3552
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:54,330
Okay, here.

3553
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:55,570
Mirror room?

3554
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:57,070
Okay, mirror room?

3555
02:00:57,330 --> 02:00:57,810
Okay.

3556
02:00:58,750 --> 02:00:59,230
Okay.

3557
02:00:59,230 --> 02:00:59,450
Okay.

3558
02:00:59,670 --> 02:01:00,330
Mirror room.

3559
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:02,730
Okay, it's pretty obvious now.

3560
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:03,570
I can't...

3561
02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:05,170
Now we know where the mirror room is, Elsa.

3562
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:10,490
I can't believe the last vase was where the fucking eye is.

3563
02:01:10,590 --> 02:01:12,310
No, this is not where the vase is.

3564
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:13,930
It's like back here.

3565
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:17,390
We need to find the... you remember the horse room?

3566
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:18,290
We need to get there.

3567
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:19,730
Okay.

3568
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:20,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3569
02:01:20,850 --> 02:01:21,610
Wait, where did you go?

3570
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:23,490
Youssef?

3571
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:25,490
Here?

3572
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:26,790
Youssef, where are you?

3573
02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:27,290
Come here, come here.

3574
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:27,930
Here.

3575
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:29,190
What about here?

3576
02:01:29,730 --> 02:01:30,310
Horse room?

3577
02:01:30,330 --> 02:01:30,750
Here.

3578
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:32,990
Here?

3579
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:35,650
No, no, no, no.

3580
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:36,970
No, no, no, it's not here.

3581
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:37,990
No, no, it's here.

3582
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:38,690
This is the exit.

3583
02:01:39,130 --> 02:01:40,270
This is the exit.

3584
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:42,610
And now we need to figure out where the dog room is.

3585
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:48,270
We need to figure out where the fuck is the dog room.

3586
02:01:50,370 --> 02:01:51,650
Okay, we're at the tutorial.

3587
02:01:51,930 --> 02:01:52,470
We're at the tutorial.

3588
02:01:52,490 --> 02:01:53,090
That's the tutorial.

3589
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:54,110
I think it's here.

3590
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:54,930
Right?

3591
02:01:55,450 --> 02:01:56,550
No, that's the dead end.

3592
02:01:57,270 --> 02:02:00,310
I remember the dog room was somewhere there.

3593
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:01,590
I mean, not the dog room though.

3594
02:02:01,710 --> 02:02:06,270
I mean, the horse room was just near around the tutorial.

3595
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:07,710
This is the tutorial.

3596
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:08,750
This is the elevator.

3597
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:11,450
Here?

3598
02:02:12,970 --> 02:02:14,370
No, this is the elevator.

3599
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:15,770
Elevator.

3600
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:17,070
Okay, follow me, follow me.

3601
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:17,530
Again.

3602
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:19,210
I'm gonna use my sixth sense again.

3603
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:19,570
Okay.

3604
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:20,470
All right.

3605
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:22,510
I believe in your... No, it's this way.

3606
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:23,870
Your sixth sense.

3607
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:28,070
Here, here, here, here.

3608
02:02:28,390 --> 02:02:29,350
Just follow me.

3609
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:30,270
Just follow me.

3610
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:32,770
Here, here, here, here.

3611
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:37,450
Oh my god.

3612
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:40,910
I trust your sixth sense.

3613
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:44,410
I'm not smart enough to play... Okay, this is the mirror room.

3614
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,350
This is the mirror room.

3615
02:02:45,570 --> 02:02:46,710
This is the mirror room.

3616
02:02:46,710 --> 02:02:49,250
I'm not smart enough to play this game, seriously.

3617
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:51,910
Wait, why was this red?

3618
02:02:52,050 --> 02:02:53,230
Why did we mark this red?

3619
02:02:53,370 --> 02:02:53,830
Red door?

3620
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:56,290
Yeah, the door.

3621
02:02:56,430 --> 02:02:56,970
The lead door.

3622
02:02:57,170 --> 02:02:57,210
This is the door.

3623
02:02:57,210 --> 02:02:57,470
Okay.

3624
02:02:58,090 --> 02:02:58,570
Yeah.

3625
02:02:58,930 --> 02:03:01,050
No, or was it the... No, this is the door.

3626
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:01,270
Yeah.

3627
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:01,350
Yeah.

3628
02:03:01,930 --> 02:03:02,290
Yeah.

3629
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:04,730
Okay.

3630
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:05,150
This room.

3631
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:06,410
Here.

3632
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:08,650
No, this is the mirror room!

3633
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:09,230
No, this is the mirror room!

3634
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:09,470
No, this is the mirror room!

3635
02:03:10,630 --> 02:03:10,990
Here?

3636
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:16,890
Oh, this one!

3637
02:03:16,990 --> 02:03:17,290
Is that...?

3638
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:18,210
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3639
02:03:18,330 --> 02:03:18,870
This is it!

3640
02:03:18,970 --> 02:03:19,350
This is it!

3641
02:03:19,390 --> 02:03:20,550
Wait, why is it red?

3642
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:21,590
Okay, this is it!

3643
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:22,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3644
02:03:22,870 --> 02:03:24,010
And then we go straight down.

3645
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:25,230
Okay.

3646
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:28,670
Oh my god...

3647
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:33,260
It's right there.

3648
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:34,680
I heard something.

3649
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:35,720
No, he's right in front of us.

3650
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,400
He's like in the walls.

3651
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:48,760
Alright.

3652
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,100
This is it.

3653
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,800
I swear to fucking god.

3654
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,820
There was no fucking eye.

3655
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:04,100
There was no fucking eye.

3656
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,280
You liars.

3657
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:08,500
You fuckers lied to me.

3658
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:09,640
There was no eye!

3659
02:04:16,650 --> 02:04:18,330
You fucking...

3660
02:04:20,970 --> 02:04:23,150
Where the fuck is the eye?

3661
02:04:26,990 --> 02:04:28,290
Oh my god.

3662
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:31,530
It was not the last base.

3663
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:34,110
I fucking knew it.

3664
02:04:36,390 --> 02:04:37,770
Then where is it?

3665
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:40,230
Where is the last base?

3666
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:41,030
Where is...

3667
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:43,070
Where is the last body?

3668
02:04:46,330 --> 02:04:47,550
Oh my god.

3669
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,090
How many dead bodies?

3670
02:04:50,830 --> 02:04:53,110
How many dead bodies are there?

3671
02:04:57,210 --> 02:04:59,510
I trusted you chat.

3672
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:08,620
Locker with shells but we opened every locker.

3673
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:11,660
Oh wait, you died.

3674
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:12,860
Wait, you died?

3675
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:13,400
I died.

3676
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:14,640
You died?

3677
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:17,680
Sorry, I stole your screwdriver.

3678
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:19,400
I didn't realize you...

3679
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:20,080
Yeah, I have screwdriver.

3680
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,080
I didn't realize you died.

3681
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:27,920
Wait, did we open the TV drawers already?

3682
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:30,180
The radioactive room?

3683
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,560
That's where the eye is?

3684
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,300
But we have no protection suits.

3685
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,460
Yeah, we don't have any protection suits.

3686
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:44,120
Can we just walk in without the protection room?

3687
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,020
Can we just walk through?

3688
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:47,260
But they're like...

3689
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:52,200
Okay, there's a locked door that only will open the radiation of the room is on low.

3690
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:53,880
To achieve this is a class D.

3691
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:56,320
It won't limit it but it will decrease the radiation.

3692
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:00,200
Don't go in there.

3693
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:00,700
Steal the suits.

3694
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:01,620
No, wait.

3695
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:02,500
Wait, you can steal it?

3696
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:06,080
Yeah, maybe you can interact with this guy?

3697
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:06,940
I don't know.

3698
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,020
How do we take his suit?

3699
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:10,040
How do we take his suit?

3700
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:12,520
Oh, everybody was like don't go through.

3701
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:14,100
Don't go through the room.

3702
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:14,920
Yeah.

3703
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:19,460
They're like don't do it.

3704
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:22,940
Okay, thank you.

3705
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,060
We won't do that.

3706
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:25,580
We won't go.

3707
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:26,020
Thank you.

3708
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:28,640
Don't trust... where's the eyes then?

3709
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:30,520
I swear to God.

3710
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:31,040
You screwdriver.

3711
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:32,320
Wait, screwdriver?

3712
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:33,860
Oh, no, I don't have the screwdriver.

3713
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:34,380
No, I have it.

3714
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:34,940
I have it.

3715
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:35,420
I took it.

3716
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:35,940
I took it.

3717
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:36,640
Okay.

3718
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:37,700
Alright.

3719
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:39,680
What else?

3720
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:41,860
Oh my God.

3721
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:44,040
Okay, we need to figure out...

3722
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:47,020
We need to figure out where the...

3723
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:48,060
Where the fuck is the eye?

3724
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:50,000
Where is the protection suit?

3725
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:51,700
Where's the eye?

3726
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:52,700
Where is it?

3727
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,260
Where is it?

3728
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:54,340
Where is it?

3729
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:54,880
I don't...

3730
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:57,380
I don't know where it is.

3731
02:06:57,820 --> 02:06:58,700
It's in the...

3732
02:06:58,700 --> 02:06:59,120
Enter.

3733
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:01,200
Check in that room.

3734
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,620
Take his eye.

3735
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,960
You guys are pretty random.

3736
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:07,300
Oh my God.

3737
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:08,820
We're never gonna progress.

3738
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:10,100
I told you guys that...

3739
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:11,280
I told you guys that...

3740
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,760
We'll never know what's in...

3741
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:12,880
Oh.

3742
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:14,580
It's red.

3743
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:16,400
Why is it red?

3744
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:17,860
I don't know.

3745
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:18,660
Why is it red?

3746
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:19,200
Is there a enemy?

3747
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:23,300
From the mirror.

3748
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:25,680
Where...

3749
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,240
Where is it?

3750
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:28,320
No, I don't believe that.

3751
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:29,260
It's in the room.

3752
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:30,020
I don't believe that.

3753
02:07:30,260 --> 02:07:31,380
It's in the room.

3754
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:32,220
What do you mean?

3755
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:34,800
I looked at all the lockers.

3756
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:35,540
What in the wall?

3757
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:37,820
Did we miss...

3758
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:39,480
There is a locker next to...

3759
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:39,600
Not too many trolls.

3760
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:39,920
Wait.

3761
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:41,780
There's a locker next to the red door.

3762
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:43,160
Did we miss out the eye?

3763
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:43,720
Did you guys hear the backseat?

3764
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:44,100
Okay.

3765
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:44,480
Okay.

3766
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,940
The red room drawer.

3767
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:47,380
Find us the red room.

3768
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:47,840
Find us the red room.

3769
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:48,880
Oh my god.

3770
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:49,220
Where was it?

3771
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:49,880
Find the red room.

3772
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:51,500
The red door.

3773
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:51,860
Where was it?

3774
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:53,600
It's not there.

3775
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:59,800
Where are you going?

3776
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:00,020
Oh.

3777
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:01,400
It's apparently random.

3778
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:02,660
It's...

3779
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:03,200
Okay.

3780
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:05,820
It's random and they say it's usually in the locker.

3781
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:06,000
Oh, it's random.

3782
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:07,840
It's in the locker or a drawer.

3783
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:08,400
Okay.

3784
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:09,480
We're missing a drawer.

3785
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:10,560
Okay.

3786
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:12,420
All right.

3787
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:13,980
We might die here because it's...

3788
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:15,620
There's a red light but I don't know where the...

3789
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:16,980
Where the monster is right now.

3790
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:17,820
Okay.

3791
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:18,600
Oh my god.

3792
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:20,280
We need to find...

3793
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:20,520
Can we just go in?

3794
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:23,680
Yeah.

3795
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:24,240
It's okay.

3796
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:24,860
Okay.

3797
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:26,000
We need to find the red door.

3798
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:27,840
The red door.

3799
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:28,280
Okay.

3800
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,540
I believe in you.

3801
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:30,840
Okay.

3802
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:32,560
Just follow me.

3803
02:08:32,660 --> 02:08:33,220
It's okay.

3804
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:33,760
Following you?

3805
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,460
I'll be responsible.

3806
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:35,540
Don't worry.

3807
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:36,240
This is the dog room.

3808
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:40,920
I thought the red room is near the dog room.

3809
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:41,840
No.

3810
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:43,260
This is the dog room.

3811
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:43,980
It's not...

3812
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:45,280
I know it's not here.

3813
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:46,760
It's not here.

3814
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:48,200
Not there?

3815
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:48,920
It's...

3816
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:49,380
It's...

3817
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:50,060
It's not here.

3818
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:51,440
This is the dog room.

3819
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:53,100
I think this is the...

3820
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:56,140
B, why are we back at the dog room?

3821
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:57,720
We're never leaving.

3822
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:00,120
Go back.

3823
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:00,900
Go back.

3824
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:01,520
Go back.

3825
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:02,020
Go back.

3826
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:02,640
Go back.

3827
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:03,300
Go back.

3828
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:04,280
Go back.

3829
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:05,040
Go back.

3830
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:05,620
Go back.

3831
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:06,100
Go back.

3832
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:06,120
Come back.

3833
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:06,900
Come back.

3834
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:08,580
I don't wanna go to Minnesota!

3835
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:09,460
Oh no, no!

3836
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:11,040
Is he gone?

3837
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:11,680
Is he gone?

3838
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:13,100
Is he gone?

3839
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:13,760
Is he gone?

3840
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:14,260
Let me check.

3841
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:15,860
He's gone!

3842
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:16,300
He's gone!

3843
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:19,960
Okay, okay, okay.

3844
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:23,000
Go look at the... we live in the lockers for now.

3845
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:24,400
Live in the locker!

3846
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:25,100
Live in the locker!

3847
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:25,820
Live in the locker!

3848
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:32,840
Okay, it's gone.

3849
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:33,260
It's gone.

3850
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:33,640
It's gone.

3851
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:34,440
Is it gone?

3852
02:09:34,700 --> 02:09:35,140
It's gone.

3853
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:35,800
It's gone.

3854
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:38,300
We gotta find the eye!

3855
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:39,500
You saw it!

3856
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:41,980
Is it still red?

3857
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:45,040
Just run!

3858
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:45,420
Just run!

3859
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:45,820
Just run!

3860
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:46,140
Just run!

3861
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:47,640
Just run!

3862
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:58,810
Just run!

3863
02:09:58,810 --> 02:09:59,190
Just run!

3864
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:00,230
Just run!

3865
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:01,070
Just run!

3866
02:10:01,110 --> 02:10:01,110
Just run!

3867
02:10:01,130 --> 02:10:01,270
Just run!

3868
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:10,060
Why the fuck let us...

3869
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,440
Free us, please!

3870
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:19,560
I... I just wanna finish the tutorial!

3871
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:27,180
Why is this the hardest level ever?

3872
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:31,560
What is wrong with this game?

3873
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,720
I have the last...

3874
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:34,000
It's the anxiety pill!

3875
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:39,420
You son, where... where are you?

3876
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:40,760
You son!

3877
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:43,740
You son!

3878
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:47,140
Okay, this is the... the body room.

3879
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,100
Wait, there's more anxiety pills.

3880
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:51,480
Let's go.

3881
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:56,400
If I close my eyes...

3882
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:03,780
I'm gonna die.

3883
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:04,320
I'm gonna die.

3884
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,080
I'm gonna die.

3885
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:07,200
I'm gonna die.

3886
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:08,900
Oh my god, I lost...

3887
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:10,160
You son, where are you?

3888
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:11,920
You son!

3889
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:13,060
You son!

3890
02:11:15,970 --> 02:11:17,510
What if I just die?

3891
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:18,310
I lost...

3892
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:18,930
You know what?

3893
02:11:19,090 --> 02:11:21,590
What if I just die and find the fu...

3894
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:22,290
I swear to god.

3895
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:23,250
I sw...

3896
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:28,670
I think the best thing I can do right now is I die and I find the eye.

3897
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:30,470
Oh, I found the fucking...

3898
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:31,470
I found the red door.

3899
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:35,860
Just kill me.

3900
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:37,640
I found the red door.

3901
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:38,280
Just kill...

3902
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,440
Just kill me.

3903
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:40,540
End this!

3904
02:11:41,220 --> 02:11:43,140
There's no eye here anyway!

3905
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:44,280
Okay.

3906
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:47,080
Alright.

3907
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:50,220
We got... we can find... we're gonna find the eye.

3908
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:52,820
I swear I'm gonna find the fucking eye.

3909
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:55,320
I'm gonna find the eye while I'm dead.

3910
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:58,280
I'm gonna find the eye while I'm dead!

3911
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:03,080
It's the only way!

3912
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:06,680
It's the only way!

3913
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:09,780
Awesome.

3914
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,180
It's the only way!

3915
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:13,300
Okay, you're there.

3916
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:14,520
Okay, I see your shadow.

3917
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:15,100
Good luck.

3918
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:16,460
I'm...

3919
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:17,600
There's no timer!

3920
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:18,820
I'm gonna find the eye!

3921
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:22,120
I'm gonna find the eye while I'm dead!

3922
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:29,060
I can't see items when I'm dead?

3923
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:30,080
Then what...

3924
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,460
Are you fucking kidding me?

3925
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,520
I can't even see items when I'm dead.

3926
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:34,320
I...

3927
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,200
Oh my god.

3928
02:12:39,810 --> 02:12:41,390
Oh my god.

3929
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:43,270
This is a fucking hell.

3930
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:44,910
This is...

3931
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:47,190
No!

3932
02:12:47,650 --> 02:12:50,510
I can't find items while I'm dead.

3933
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:51,970
Okay.

3934
02:12:52,210 --> 02:12:52,990
What I learned...

3935
02:12:54,570 --> 02:12:55,130
Wait.

3936
02:12:55,370 --> 02:12:56,630
Wait, where's the mirror room?

3937
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:58,610
Did we check the TV fucking drawers?

3938
02:12:58,910 --> 02:13:02,470
I swear to fucking god, if we never like looked into the...

3939
02:13:02,470 --> 02:13:08,190
Looked into the drawers in the TV mirror room, I swear to fucking god, I would be so mad.

3940
02:13:08,470 --> 02:13:10,270
I would be so fucking mad.

3941
02:13:10,590 --> 02:13:11,150
I...

3942
02:13:11,910 --> 02:13:12,250
I...

3943
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:12,290
I...

3944
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:15,250
I don't know where the tea...

3945
02:13:15,250 --> 02:13:15,670
Okay.

3946
02:13:15,910 --> 02:13:17,190
I swear to god.

3947
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:19,010
Okay, all the drawers are open.

3948
02:13:19,190 --> 02:13:20,810
Alright, all the drawers are open.

3949
02:13:20,970 --> 02:13:22,310
Thank fucking god.

3950
02:13:22,590 --> 02:13:22,790
I...

3951
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:27,650
I'm trying to...

3952
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:29,450
Did we ever open this?

3953
02:13:29,650 --> 02:13:33,570
I swear to god, did we ever open this?

3954
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:42,710
I swear.

3955
02:13:43,670 --> 02:13:45,210
Oh my god.

3956
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:46,910
Oh.

3957
02:13:46,910 --> 02:13:50,810
Oh my fucking god.

3958
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:51,830
Okay, yes I did.

3959
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:53,970
Alright, I'm back at the tutorial.

3960
02:13:54,370 --> 02:13:59,610
I know, I need to revive, but I need to figure out where the fuck am I first.

3961
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:01,930
Okay, this is the revive room.

3962
02:14:02,530 --> 02:14:03,330
Where's the...

3963
02:14:03,330 --> 02:14:04,770
This is the mirror room.

3964
02:14:04,770 --> 02:14:06,150
I keep going back to the mirror room.

3965
02:14:06,370 --> 02:14:06,910
I keep...

3966
02:14:06,910 --> 02:14:08,330
This is the red room.

3967
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:09,090
Okay.

3968
02:14:09,730 --> 02:14:10,930
Red room is here.

3969
02:14:11,470 --> 02:14:12,910
Okay, red room is here.

3970
02:14:13,210 --> 02:14:14,050
I swear.

3971
02:14:14,230 --> 02:14:15,130
Where is it?

3972
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:16,210
I'm slowly...

3973
02:14:16,210 --> 02:14:16,890
I'm going for the red room.

3974
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:17,890
I'm going crazy right now.

3975
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:18,610
Where the...

3976
02:14:18,610 --> 02:14:18,810
Okay.

3977
02:14:19,690 --> 02:14:20,290
Radiation room.

3978
02:14:20,390 --> 02:14:21,550
I'm going to check the radiation.

3979
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:24,430
I want to know what the fuck is in the radiation room.

3980
02:14:24,650 --> 02:14:25,990
I'm going to make sure I've...

3981
02:14:26,590 --> 02:14:27,950
Okay, those are just lockers.

3982
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:29,310
Okay, I was going to be like, I swear.

3983
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:30,970
I swear to fucking god.

3984
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:32,650
If there was like nothing...

3985
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:35,910
Did we ever open the drawers in the clock room?

3986
02:14:38,050 --> 02:14:38,750
Did we?

3987
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:40,750
Oh my god.

3988
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:41,850
Did we?

3989
02:14:44,190 --> 02:14:44,590
Guys!

3990
02:14:45,190 --> 02:14:45,970
Did we?

3991
02:14:46,910 --> 02:14:47,550
Oh, yes.

3992
02:14:47,790 --> 02:14:49,070
Oh, thank god.

3993
02:14:49,130 --> 02:14:49,450
Okay.

3994
02:14:49,570 --> 02:14:50,750
I just needed to know that.

3995
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:54,340
All right.

3996
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,160
What was in this room?

3997
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:59,740
It was a gas mask, a bucket.

3998
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:01,580
Wait.

3999
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:04,980
I couldn't look at items while dead.

4000
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:08,440
What the fuck did you guys mean when you said I couldn't?

4001
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:10,260
The fuck are these?

4002
02:15:14,650 --> 02:15:16,330
Okay, radiation room.

4003
02:15:16,590 --> 02:15:17,910
So many doors.

4004
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:19,730
Oh my god.

4005
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:20,870
There's...

4006
02:15:20,890 --> 02:15:21,630
There's like crutches.

4007
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:23,070
There's a fucking teddy bear.

4008
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:25,050
How do I get out of here?

4009
02:15:25,690 --> 02:15:26,410
How do I...

4010
02:15:26,410 --> 02:15:28,090
How do I get out of here?

4011
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:29,850
Oh, those are not items.

4012
02:15:30,190 --> 02:15:31,570
You mean they're not items?

4013
02:15:31,650 --> 02:15:32,970
They just exist?

4014
02:15:36,910 --> 02:15:38,750
I don't know how to get out of here now.

4015
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:40,710
Must be...

4016
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:41,610
Where am I?

4017
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:43,450
Okay, here it is.

4018
02:15:43,550 --> 02:15:43,830
All right.

4019
02:15:43,850 --> 02:15:44,850
We're going to find the...

4020
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:46,350
We're going to get out of here.

4021
02:15:47,930 --> 02:15:49,290
Those items don't count.

4022
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:50,110
That's a puzzle.

4023
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:54,350
The moment we find the eyeball and finish the fucking body parts...

4024
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:54,690
I'm...

4025
02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:55,050
We're...

4026
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:55,410
This...

4027
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:56,090
It's over.

4028
02:15:56,330 --> 02:15:56,910
This...

4029
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:03,500
Oh my god.

4030
02:16:06,580 --> 02:16:07,760
Where's the door?

4031
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:08,880
It just revived me.

4032
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:11,640
Okay.

4033
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:13,600
How do I get revived?

4034
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:15,580
How do I get revived?

4035
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:17,160
Where is it?

4036
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:18,780
Where's the heartbeat?

4037
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:19,000
Heartbeat!

4038
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:26,440
I hear the heartbeat, but where?

4039
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:31,880
Where is it?

4040
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:40,300
Follow the trail.

4041
02:16:40,980 --> 02:16:42,780
Follow the light trail.

4042
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:44,620
I'm here.

4043
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:47,720
I'm back!

4044
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,580
I'm back!

4045
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:50,240
Why?

4046
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:52,520
Oh my god, I'm back!

4047
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:53,760
Don't worry!

4048
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:58,360
When you want to revive, you gotta follow the light.

4049
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:05,480
Yeah, I was trying to see a locker that we didn't open.

4050
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:07,680
I was trying to find a locker.

4051
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:09,720
We already did the red door though.

4052
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,860
It's not the red door.

4053
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:12,800
This one's the red door.

4054
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:14,440
Yeah, but like...

4055
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:15,640
We have to...

4056
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,600
The horse room, right?

4057
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:18,160
We opened all of these.

4058
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:19,760
It's like in a drawer!

4059
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:23,740
The eye is in a drawer or a locker that we didn't open!

4060
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,700
But we opened everything!

4061
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:27,940
We opened everything!

4062
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:29,040
Where?

4063
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:30,160
Okay.

4064
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:31,340
TV room.

4065
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:33,120
TV room lockers.

4066
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:33,560
TV room.

4067
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:34,300
Body room.

4068
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:36,960
A tiny offshoot near the vase room.

4069
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:37,900
What?

4070
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,520
A tiny offshoot near the vase room?

4071
02:17:40,580 --> 02:17:42,880
Which has a drawer with the eyes...

4072
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:46,060
The vase room has two spots the eye can be.

4073
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:46,840
Okay.

4074
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:48,920
We need to fix...

4075
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:49,100
Okay.

4076
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:51,940
We checked the TV room.

4077
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:53,180
Okay.

4078
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:54,880
The TV room lockers, right?

4079
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:56,120
We did all that.

4080
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:57,380
Let's go to the...

4081
02:17:57,380 --> 02:17:59,540
I didn't know we opened all the drawers there.

4082
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:01,240
We opened the body room.

4083
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:01,960
Okay.

4084
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:04,840
We can try the vase room again.

4085
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:07,020
Maybe it's in the vase room.

4086
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:08,960
Where is the vase room?

4087
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:10,980
Maybe it's in the vase room.

4088
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:11,180
Okay, follow me.

4089
02:18:11,180 --> 02:18:11,260
Sixth sense.

4090
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:12,240
Alright.

4091
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:14,380
There has to...

4092
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:15,000
Alright.

4093
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:16,060
We're gonna go...

4094
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:17,120
We're gonna do a checklist.

4095
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:19,900
We'll do a little checklist.

4096
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,060
We'll do vase room first.

4097
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:23,160
This is the first room.

4098
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:23,440
This is the...

4099
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:23,840
Okay.

4100
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:24,500
Elevator.

4101
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:26,080
The first...

4102
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:27,660
It's fine.

4103
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:28,420
It's fine.

4104
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:29,860
The first thing we find is...

4105
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:32,180
That means we can start from the beginning again.

4106
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:32,760
Oh, my God.

4107
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:38,740
Whenever you're lost, you have to review yourself, then you have to remember how did you actually start.

4108
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:39,340
Oh, my God.

4109
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:39,860
Oh, my God.

4110
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:40,640
I like how we...

4111
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,160
It's important.

4112
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:42,760
I like how we...

4113
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:44,320
It's really important to...

4114
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:44,480
Okay.

4115
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:45,260
This is the TV room.

4116
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:46,240
Here.

4117
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,600
Here.

4118
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:46,820
Here.

4119
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:47,020
Here.

4120
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:47,300
Here.

4121
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:00,380
What?

4122
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:02,520
You found it??

4123
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:04,080
It was here all along.

4124
02:19:08,820 --> 02:19:09,840
I'm happy.

4125
02:19:17,230 --> 02:19:18,230
I'm happy.

4126
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:18,610
I'm happy.

4127
02:19:18,610 --> 02:19:18,650
I'm happy.

4128
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:19,270
I'm happy.

4129
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:19,750
Let's go!

4130
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:21,670
Let's finish this!

4131
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:23,870
No fucking way!

4132
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:25,550
We can finish it!

4133
02:19:25,570 --> 02:19:27,550
I fucking believe that!

4134
02:19:27,730 --> 02:19:28,530
Oh my god!

4135
02:19:28,630 --> 02:19:30,530
It was in a fucking...

4136
02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:34,530
We were in this room before for so long!

4137
02:19:34,530 --> 02:19:36,090
It was in there.

4138
02:19:36,150 --> 02:19:37,150
Okay, body room.

4139
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:39,150
Where's the body room?

4140
02:19:40,430 --> 02:19:42,710
There are all the red ones!

4141
02:19:48,350 --> 02:19:50,270
No, that's the red door.

4142
02:19:50,330 --> 02:19:50,870
That's the door.

4143
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:52,810
Around here!

4144
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:54,670
Around here!

4145
02:19:55,090 --> 02:19:57,450
Yeah, is it here?

4146
02:19:58,490 --> 02:19:59,590
Around here.

4147
02:19:59,890 --> 02:20:00,970
No, that's the tutorial.

4148
02:20:02,010 --> 02:20:03,350
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4149
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:06,010
Let's go back to the red room again.

4150
02:20:06,050 --> 02:20:06,630
Oh, I got the hide here.

4151
02:20:06,790 --> 02:20:07,270
Here?

4152
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:07,690
Here?

4153
02:20:07,770 --> 02:20:08,950
No, that's the tutorial.

4154
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:10,470
You're in the tutorial.

4155
02:20:13,150 --> 02:20:15,090
Where was the body room again?

4156
02:20:15,270 --> 02:20:17,010
Where was the body room?

4157
02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:19,270
Where is it?

4158
02:20:19,650 --> 02:20:20,950
Did I pick it up?

4159
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:21,810
I did.

4160
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:23,610
I can't believe.

4161
02:20:25,310 --> 02:20:26,810
Oh my god.

4162
02:20:26,850 --> 02:20:28,370
I'm in the mirror room.

4163
02:20:28,890 --> 02:20:29,790
Where am I?

4164
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:31,930
Where am I?

4165
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:35,090
I'm so lost.

4166
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:36,850
Not here.

4167
02:20:37,750 --> 02:20:38,590
Not here.

4168
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:39,270
Not here.

4169
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:39,630
Where are we?

4170
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:42,270
This is the door room.

4171
02:20:43,570 --> 02:20:44,330
Not here.

4172
02:20:44,390 --> 02:20:45,010
Not here.

4173
02:20:45,070 --> 02:20:45,590
Not here.

4174
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:46,250
We need to...

4175
02:20:54,550 --> 02:20:56,010
I'm not okay.

4176
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:57,270
I'M NOT OKAY!

4177
02:20:57,270 --> 02:20:58,170
YOU SAID!

4178
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:03,910
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

4179
02:21:04,450 --> 02:21:04,810
Woah.

4180
02:21:05,510 --> 02:21:06,030
Woah.

4181
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:06,790
Woah.

4182
02:21:07,330 --> 02:21:08,170
That's okay.

4183
02:21:08,910 --> 02:21:10,310
Everything is okay.

4184
02:21:10,370 --> 02:21:12,410
I still have my one Almond Water.

4185
02:21:15,540 --> 02:21:16,060
Okay.

4186
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:17,560
We're fine.

4187
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:18,980
You said we're fine.

4188
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:20,700
We're fine.

4189
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:21,920
We're okay.

4190
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:23,420
There is the enemy.

4191
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:24,380
I FOUND IT.

4192
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:24,720
FOUND IT.

4193
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:25,220
FOUND IT.

4194
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:26,920
I FOUND IT.

4195
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:27,900
OH MY GOD.

4196
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:28,460
Okay.

4197
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:29,640
What was their name?

4198
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:31,660
It was like Leia or some shit.

4199
02:21:31,860 --> 02:21:32,140
Leia.

4200
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:32,860
Leia.

4201
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:33,560
Leia.

4202
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:34,000
Leia.

4203
02:21:34,060 --> 02:21:34,060
Leia.

4204
02:21:34,260 --> 02:21:34,320
Leia.

4205
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:34,560
Leia.

4206
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:34,680
Leia.

4207
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:34,780
Leia.

4208
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:35,800
Leia.

4209
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:35,800
Leia.

4210
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:35,800
Leia.

4211
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:35,800
Leia.

4212
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:37,940
Oh my god!

4213
02:21:37,980 --> 02:21:38,260
Mirror!

4214
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,180
Mirror room

4215
02:21:42,370 --> 02:21:42,490

4216
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:43,390
I heard the sound!

4217
02:21:44,430 --> 02:21:44,910
What?

4218
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:46,290
What are you seeing?

4219
02:21:48,110 --> 02:21:48,910
What happened?

4220
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:51,910
Oh my god.

4221
02:21:52,250 --> 02:21:52,970
We did it!

4222
02:21:53,530 --> 02:21:54,510
We did it!

4223
02:21:54,510 --> 02:21:55,510
We finished this puzzle!

4224
02:21:55,610 --> 02:21:56,450

4225
02:21:56,450 --> 02:21:57,050

4226
02:21:57,170 --> 02:21:57,970
Oh my god.

4227
02:21:58,110 --> 02:21:58,490
Mirror room!

4228
02:21:58,490 --> 02:21:58,750
Mirror room!

4229
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:00,450

4231
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:03,590
Let's go to the mirror room!

4232
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:04,450
You saw him!

4233
02:22:04,450 --> 02:22:04,750
Let's go!

4234
02:22:05,010 --> 02:22:05,470
Follow me!

4235
02:22:05,530 --> 02:22:05,910
Follow me!

4236
02:22:05,950 --> 02:22:06,350
Follow me!

4237
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:08,950
I'll be responsible for this.

4238
02:22:09,150 --> 02:22:09,650
Don't worry.

4239
02:22:09,670 --> 02:22:10,670
It's gonna be fine.

4240
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:11,970
We did this.

4241
02:22:13,070 --> 02:22:13,510
Here.

4242
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:13,950
Here.

4243
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:14,210
Here.

4244
02:22:14,210 --> 02:22:15,730
We're so gonna find the mirror room.

4245
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:16,130
There we go!

4246
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:16,530
There we go!

4247
02:22:16,650 --> 02:22:16,890

4248
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:17,170

4249
02:22:17,170 --> 02:22:17,330

4250
02:22:17,430 --> 02:22:18,010
Come here!

4251
02:22:18,070 --> 02:22:18,170
Come here!

4252
02:22:18,870 --> 02:22:19,730
You saw him!

4253
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:20,450
The door is open!

4254
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:22,030
Look!

4255
02:22:25,570 --> 02:22:26,670
This is new!

4256
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:30,110
What the fuck?

4257
02:22:31,370 --> 02:22:32,930
I don't like anything new.

4258
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:34,750
I don't like anything new.

4259
02:22:36,350 --> 02:22:38,510
How do I... How do I use this?

4260
02:22:39,230 --> 02:22:39,670
Okay.

4261
02:22:39,950 --> 02:22:40,390
Interact.

4262
02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:41,850
Interact.

4263
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:43,970
Interact.

4264
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:44,530
How do I use it?

4265
02:22:44,530 --> 02:22:45,090
How do I use the screwdriver?

4266
02:22:46,510 --> 02:22:46,950
Screwdriver?

4267
02:22:46,990 --> 02:22:47,590
I don't have it.

4268
02:22:47,750 --> 02:22:48,290
No, I do.

4269
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:49,650
But how do I use it?

4270
02:22:51,570 --> 02:22:52,410
Oh my god.

4271
02:22:54,250 --> 02:22:55,530
There's a... Is there a fuse?

4272
02:22:57,170 --> 02:22:58,430
No, I don't have fuse too.

4273
02:22:58,490 --> 02:22:58,770
Wait.

4274
02:22:58,770 --> 02:22:58,770
Blue?

4275
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:01,290
Yellow?

4276
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:08,720
No?

4277
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:09,840
I can't open that.

4278
02:23:12,700 --> 02:23:13,980
What was the color?

4279
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:15,960
What are those colors for?

4280
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:16,940
I don't know.

4281
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:21,640
I don't know.

4282
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:26,840
We need fuses but I don't try to find where the fuses are.

4283
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:30,800
Yeah.

4284
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:33,640
I have nothing in my inventory right now.

4285
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:34,420
It's pretty empty.

4286
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:34,980
Okay.

4287
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:35,960
I have everything.

4288
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:36,680
Wait.

4289
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:37,720
Maybe this?

4290
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:38,940
Okay.

4291
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:39,680
What's this?

4292
02:23:39,940 --> 02:23:40,460
What about this mirror?

4293
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:41,760
There are multiple layers of stone too.

4294
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:44,080
But only three can be up at the same time.

4295
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:44,340
Oh!

4296
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:47,580
Okay.

4297
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:48,380
But what color?

4298
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:51,440
What color do they have to be?

4299
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:54,020
I have no idea.

4300
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:55,180
Oh!

4301
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:58,000
Oh, okay.

4302
02:23:59,080 --> 02:23:59,460
Wait.

4303
02:23:59,540 --> 02:23:59,760
Okay.

4304
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:00,580
I get it.

4305
02:24:00,620 --> 02:24:00,880
I get it.

4306
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:01,240
I get it.

4307
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:02,200
Okay.

4308
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:02,780
Okay.

4309
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:03,480
It's not this one.

4310
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:05,620
Alright.

4311
02:24:06,580 --> 02:24:06,960
Okay.

4312
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:08,840
Go to the door.

4313
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:09,400
Go to the door.

4314
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:10,320
And then I'm gonna...

4315
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:11,520
I'm gonna talk to you.

4316
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:11,740
I'm gonna...

4317
02:24:11,740 --> 02:24:12,480
I'm gonna walkie-talkie.

4318
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:15,020
Go to the door and tell me if it's green.

4319
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:15,880
Go to the door.

4320
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:16,900
And start.

4321
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:17,500
Go to the door.

4322
02:24:18,820 --> 02:24:19,460
Which door?

4323
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:20,120
Okay.

4324
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:20,320
Wait.

4325
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:20,500
Wait.

4326
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:20,640
Wait.

4327
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:22,060
I'll go to the door.

4328
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:24,180
I'm gonna go to the door.

4329
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:26,600
And then you flip the switches.

4330
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:28,260
And I'll tell you if it's green.

4331
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:31,080
I'll tell you if it's yes or no.

4332
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:32,480
Okay.

4333
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:32,940
Okay?

4334
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:35,060
So which...

4335
02:24:35,060 --> 02:24:35,400
Come here.

4336
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:35,620
Come here.

4337
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:36,320
So...

4338
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:37,220
Come here.

4339
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:37,400
Come here.

4340
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:37,580
Come here.

4341
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:38,180
You start.

4342
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:38,780
Okay.

4343
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:39,520
Okay.

4344
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:40,260
So you see this door?

4345
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:41,440
Okay.

4346
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:41,940
So I...

4347
02:24:41,940 --> 02:24:44,080
One of the switches I did was correct.

4348
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:46,080
So I want you to keep doing...

4349
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:48,960
You can only have three switches at the same time.

4350
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:50,140
So you turn...

4351
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:51,280
You turn on the switch.

4352
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,700
Each switch.

4353
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:55,100
And I'll tell you if it's yes or no.

4354
02:24:55,220 --> 02:24:56,440
If it's no, turn it off.

4355
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:56,620
Okay.

4356
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:58,140
If it's yes, keep it on.

4357
02:24:58,960 --> 02:24:59,360
Okay.

4358
02:24:59,420 --> 02:24:59,520
Okay.

4359
02:24:59,600 --> 02:24:59,740
Okay.

4360
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:00,080
Okay?

4361
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:00,200
Alright.

4362
02:25:00,380 --> 02:25:00,380
Alright.

4363
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:01,400
Use the walkie-talkie.

4364
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:02,600
Okay.

4365
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:03,240
Okay.

4366
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:03,720
Alright.

4367
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:04,600
Go.

4368
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:04,840
Go.

4369
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:04,920
Go.

4370
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:07,460
So...

4371
02:25:07,460 --> 02:25:08,700
I'm just gonna...

4372
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:10,760
Up the leveler, right?

4373
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:11,120
Yeah.

4374
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:11,340
Yeah.

4375
02:25:12,900 --> 02:25:13,640
In the rack.

4376
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:15,000
No.

4377
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:16,560
How about this?

4378
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:16,860
No.

4379
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:18,380
Turn it off.

4380
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:18,760
Okay.

4381
02:25:18,820 --> 02:25:19,280
I just...

4382
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:19,960
Yeah.

4383
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:23,480
How about this?

4384
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:24,920
No.

4385
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:25,940
Turn it off.

4386
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:26,340
Wait.

4387
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:26,640
Yes.

4388
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:26,900
Yes.

4389
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:27,500
Yes.

4390
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:29,060
Oh no.

4391
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:29,560
Yeah.

4392
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:29,780
Wait.

4393
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:30,100
Don't...

4394
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:30,960
Turn it back on.

4395
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:31,220
Yeah.

4396
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:32,300
We need one more.

4397
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:32,900
We need one more.

4398
02:25:37,610 --> 02:25:38,490
It's not working.

4399
02:25:38,990 --> 02:25:39,390
Oh.

4400
02:25:39,410 --> 02:25:40,270
You have to turn...

4401
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:40,510
Go up.

4402
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:42,250
It's not working.

4403
02:25:42,590 --> 02:25:42,910
Oh.

4404
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:43,150
Okay.

4405
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:43,390
Wait.

4406
02:25:43,470 --> 02:25:43,550
Wait.

4407
02:25:43,550 --> 02:25:43,630
Wait.

4408
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:44,310
I know which one.

4409
02:25:45,590 --> 02:25:46,230
I think.

4410
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:48,470
Wait.

4411
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:49,650
Like this one's not working.

4412
02:25:49,730 --> 02:25:50,370
Let me... Let me try.

4413
02:25:50,410 --> 02:25:50,810
Let me try.

4414
02:25:50,850 --> 02:25:51,910
I think it was this one.

4415
02:25:51,950 --> 02:25:52,770
Is this yes or no?

4416
02:25:53,070 --> 02:25:53,390
Oh.

4417
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:53,910
This was yes.

4418
02:25:54,590 --> 02:25:55,350
This was yes.

4419
02:25:56,370 --> 02:25:56,690
Okay.

4420
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,780
We need to turn off one more.

4421
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:03,940
Turn off.

4422
02:26:04,180 --> 02:26:04,700
We need to turn on.

4423
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:05,400
We need to turn on.

4424
02:26:05,420 --> 02:26:05,600
Sorry.

4425
02:26:05,660 --> 02:26:06,280
We need to turn on.

4426
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:07,800
Okay.

4427
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:08,500
So this one?

4428
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:12,480
We ignore that.

4429
02:26:23,790 --> 02:26:24,510
Okay.

4430
02:26:24,510 --> 02:26:37,130
It goes on again.

4431
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:37,890
Why is this so hard?

4432
02:26:38,210 --> 02:26:38,470
Okay.

4433
02:26:39,150 --> 02:26:39,830
Okay.

4434
02:26:40,350 --> 02:26:44,330
Why is it still...?

4435
02:26:44,330 --> 02:26:44,510
Okay.

4436
02:26:45,270 --> 02:26:46,130
Why is it still on?

4437
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:47,590
Let me pass.

4438
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:49,270
Okay.

4439
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:50,770
Yeah.

4440
02:26:50,790 --> 02:26:51,410
Okay.

4441
02:26:51,410 --> 02:26:51,590
Okay.

4442
02:26:52,430 --> 02:26:53,690
Oh okay, I did it.

4443
02:26:53,790 --> 02:26:54,230
It worked!

4444
02:26:55,210 --> 02:26:55,830
Awesome.

4445
02:26:56,330 --> 02:26:56,950
Sorry.

4446
02:26:58,990 --> 02:27:00,110
That was hard.

4447
02:27:00,230 --> 02:27:00,850
We did it!

4448
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:01,350
Yay!

4449
02:27:03,550 --> 02:27:05,370
Wait, there's a radiation suit!

4450
02:27:05,710 --> 02:27:06,330
We did it!

4451
02:27:06,470 --> 02:27:07,090
I

4452
02:27:10,570 --> 02:27:11,050
need to go!

4453
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:12,350
Oh my god.

4454
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:15,070
We did it!

4455
02:27:15,650 --> 02:27:16,690
Put it on!

4456
02:27:17,810 --> 02:27:19,490
Put it on!

4457
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:21,670
Put it on!

4458
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:26,210
Calm down, I need to heal myself like real quick.

4459
02:27:26,270 --> 02:27:27,910
I don't remember what these do.

4460
02:27:29,190 --> 02:27:29,670
Okay.

4461
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:32,430
Okay, awesome.

4462
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:33,450
Put it on.

4463
02:27:33,530 --> 02:27:34,770
Oh yeah, we did it!

4464
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:35,890
Put it on!

4465
02:27:35,890 --> 02:27:36,810
Put it in your inventory!

4466
02:27:36,850 --> 02:27:37,270
Okay, let's go to the radiation room.

4467
02:27:38,650 --> 02:27:40,650
Open your inventory and put it on!

4468
02:27:41,970 --> 02:27:43,710
Oh okay, I thought I put it on already.

4469
02:27:43,790 --> 02:27:44,110
Equip!

4470
02:27:44,110 --> 02:27:44,730
How about this?

4471
02:27:44,750 --> 02:27:45,130
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

4472
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:46,870
We did it!

4473
02:27:47,170 --> 02:27:47,650
Guys!

4474
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:49,350
I need to know...

4475
02:27:49,350 --> 02:27:51,650
How much more do we have of this?

4476
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:53,110
This stuff at this level.

4477
02:27:54,550 --> 02:27:55,970
I have no idea.

4478
02:27:56,090 --> 02:27:56,810
We're gonna figure it out after the radiation room.

4479
02:27:56,810 --> 02:27:57,570
You don't have it on yet!

4480
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:59,390
You don't have your radiation suit on.

4481
02:28:01,270 --> 02:28:03,750
Well I thought I had my suit on.

4482
02:28:03,990 --> 02:28:06,150
Wait, do I have my suit on?

4483
02:28:07,790 --> 02:28:08,450
You are.

4484
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:09,210
Yeah, wait wait wait.

4485
02:28:09,350 --> 02:28:09,990
Yeah, you don't.

4486
02:28:09,990 --> 02:28:11,050
I equipped it already.

4487
02:28:11,350 --> 02:28:12,370
Wait, use, use.

4488
02:28:12,490 --> 02:28:13,430
Yeah, there we go!

4489
02:28:13,650 --> 02:28:13,850
Whoa!

4490
02:28:14,810 --> 02:28:15,250
Okay.

4491
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:17,590
Looking pretty handsome in that suit.

4492
02:28:19,670 --> 02:28:21,390
We have two more puzzles!

4493
02:28:21,670 --> 02:28:23,190
We have two more puzzles!

4494
02:28:23,370 --> 02:28:24,090
You saw it!

4495
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:24,550
Among us!

4496
02:28:24,730 --> 02:28:25,290
Among us!

4497
02:28:25,290 --> 02:28:26,310
Okay, base room!

4498
02:28:26,890 --> 02:28:27,570
Radiation room!

4499
02:28:27,630 --> 02:28:29,030
We need to find the radiation room!

4500
02:28:29,490 --> 02:28:31,450
For god, where was that?

4501
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:32,710
I don't remember where was that!

4502
02:28:32,710 --> 02:28:33,430
It's not this way!

4503
02:28:33,690 --> 02:28:34,750
It's not this way!

4504
02:28:37,810 --> 02:28:40,270
Okay, now, now figure it out.

4505
02:28:42,910 --> 02:28:43,810
Okay, follow me.

4506
02:28:43,810 --> 02:28:44,470
Two more puzzles!

4507
02:28:44,950 --> 02:28:46,330
Follow my six sense.

4508
02:28:46,590 --> 02:28:47,010
Okay?

4509
02:28:47,090 --> 02:28:47,810
Alright, here we go.

4510
02:28:48,010 --> 02:28:48,470
Here.

4511
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:50,650
Here.

4512
02:28:50,790 --> 02:28:50,790
Here.

4513
02:28:50,790 --> 02:28:51,730
Oh, that's the red room.

4514
02:28:51,770 --> 02:28:51,970
No.

4515
02:28:51,970 --> 02:28:52,570
That's the red room.

4516
02:28:54,650 --> 02:28:55,710
Oh my god.

4517
02:28:55,770 --> 02:28:56,970
That is... Yeah, yeah, yeah, here!

4518
02:28:57,730 --> 02:28:58,510
We can go!

4519
02:28:58,590 --> 02:28:58,610
Nice!

4520
02:28:58,610 --> 02:28:58,910
Awesome!

4521
02:28:59,030 --> 02:28:59,370
Here, here!

4522
02:28:59,570 --> 02:29:00,890
We can do it!

4523
02:29:01,050 --> 02:29:02,570
No, no.

4524
02:29:02,610 --> 02:29:03,150
All the way.

4525
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:03,810
All the way there.

4526
02:29:04,430 --> 02:29:05,150
Oh yeah, yeah?

4527
02:29:05,330 --> 02:29:06,050
No, no.

4528
02:29:06,050 --> 02:29:06,830
This is base room.

4529
02:29:06,910 --> 02:29:07,530
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4530
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:08,050
Radiation room is here.

4531
02:29:09,410 --> 02:29:10,850
But there's a... It's right here.

4532
02:29:11,070 --> 02:29:11,630
No, no, no, no, no.

4533
02:29:11,630 --> 02:29:12,510
But there's a red light.

4534
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:16,860
Whoa, okay.

4535
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,180
I guess we just go through.

4536
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:22,080
Okay.

4537
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:22,640
I found it!

4538
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:23,240
I found it!

4539
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:23,480
Here.

4540
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:23,840
Yeah!

4541
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:24,500
Let's go.

4542
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:26,160
Alright, I need to read this again.

4543
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:27,460
Okay.

4544
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:27,900
Okay.

4545
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:32,060
Oh, there is a locker that only will open the radiation room is on low level.

4546
02:29:32,260 --> 02:29:35,480
To achieve this, the class is required only to be able to increase...

4547
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:35,660
What is this?

4548
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:35,660
What is this?

4549
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:36,280
Gas mask.

4550
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:38,200
Some items on the rooms are contaminated.

4551
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:39,440
Oh, okay.

4552
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:43,840
So what we need to do is find the items with the most contamination.

4553
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:45,240
Okay.

4554
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:46,180
With the most radiation.

4555
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:50,580
Oh, so I need to use the radiation...

4556
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:50,600
Okay.

4557
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:50,600
This has...

4558
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:50,600
This is four.

4559
02:29:52,120 --> 02:29:52,600
Four?

4560
02:29:54,220 --> 02:29:54,700
Alright.

4561
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:55,480
So, wait.

4562
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:56,100
What is this?

4563
02:29:56,460 --> 02:29:56,940
One...

4564
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:58,900
Is the... Okay.

4565
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:00,600
This one has a lot of radiation.

4566
02:30:00,760 --> 02:30:01,240
Okay.

4567
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:01,240
Hold the radiation one.

4568
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:01,360
I'm just gonna hold it on flashlight.

4569
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:02,860
I found one has a lot of radiation.

4570
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:04,600
And then we spray it.

4571
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:06,180
Okay.

4572
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:06,620
Got it.

4573
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:09,220
There you go.

4574
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:11,480
Yeah.

4575
02:30:11,580 --> 02:30:11,800
Okay.

4576
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:13,920
That gas mask has a lot of radiation.

4577
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:14,540
Whoa.

4578
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:15,540
Whoa.

4579
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:15,880
Whoa.

4580
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:21,580
There's a monster here.

4581
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:22,540
I hear the footsteps.

4582
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:23,560
I hear the footsteps.

4583
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:23,980
Yeah.

4584
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:23,980
Me too.

4585
02:30:24,460 --> 02:30:25,380
I do too.

4586
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:26,380
I don't like that.

4587
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:28,880
I don't like that.

4588
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:31,120
I don't like that too.

4589
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:33,480
Okay.

4590
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:34,080
That's the door.

4591
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:37,100
Woo!

4592
02:30:37,860 --> 02:30:38,340
Okay.

4593
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:39,140
Does this have radiation?

4594
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:41,480
No.

4595
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:42,600
Okay.

4596
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:42,860
No?

4597
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:43,480
Okay.

4598
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:43,760
Alright.

4599
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:44,920
Uh...

4600
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:45,200
Hmm.

4601
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:45,660
Wait.

4602
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:46,140
What was this?

4603
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:46,680
Teddy bear.

4604
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:48,000
Teddy bear.

4605
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:49,280
Radiation?

4606
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:49,680
Oh, yeah.

4607
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:49,880
Yeah.

4608
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:50,380
Spray it.

4609
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:51,080
Spray it.

4610
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:53,140
Spray it with your extinguisher.

4611
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:54,340
Okay.

4612
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:54,980
Hold on a moment.

4613
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:55,360
Yeah.

4614
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:55,420
Yeah.

4615
02:30:55,420 --> 02:30:55,440
Yeah.

4616
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:56,440
Use...

4617
02:30:58,500 --> 02:30:59,140
And then...

4618
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:00,960
Did you spray it?

4619
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:01,080
Yeah.

4620
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:01,480
I did that.

4621
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:02,260
He's spraying.

4622
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:02,880
He's spraying.

4623
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:03,540
Okay.

4624
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:03,880
Nice.

4625
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:05,620
This one too.

4626
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:06,160
This one too.

4627
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:07,440
Okay.

4628
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:08,720
Spray it.

4629
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:11,300
Okay.

4630
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:11,780
Nice.

4631
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:12,840
Alright.

4632
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:16,180
Oh my god.

4633
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:18,040
This game has like a lot of things to do.

4634
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:18,540
What about this?

4635
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:18,640
This one.

4636
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:18,840
Yeah.

4637
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:19,080
Yeah.

4638
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:19,160
Yeah.

4639
02:31:21,860 --> 02:31:22,180
Alright.

4640
02:31:25,350 --> 02:31:25,930
I don't know.

4641
02:31:27,170 --> 02:31:28,190
I think that's...

4642
02:31:28,190 --> 02:31:28,650
Alright.

4643
02:31:28,670 --> 02:31:29,070
I'm gonna check.

4644
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:29,410
Let's...

4645
02:31:29,410 --> 02:31:30,090
I'm gonna check the door.

4646
02:31:30,610 --> 02:31:32,050
Oh, we should have sprayed the door.

4647
02:31:32,190 --> 02:31:33,250
We should have...

4648
02:31:33,250 --> 02:31:34,510
We should have...

4649
02:31:34,510 --> 02:31:34,970
We should have...

4650
02:31:34,970 --> 02:31:35,650
We should have...

4651
02:31:35,650 --> 02:31:36,090
Okay.

4652
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:36,570
This one.

4653
02:31:36,610 --> 02:31:36,890
This one.

4654
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:37,210
Choose.

4655
02:31:38,230 --> 02:31:38,550
Okay.

4656
02:31:39,970 --> 02:31:40,290
Okay.

4657
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:44,150
This.

4658
02:31:44,170 --> 02:31:44,350
This.

4659
02:31:45,310 --> 02:31:45,630
Okay.

4660
02:31:48,130 --> 02:31:48,470
Okay.

4661
02:31:49,090 --> 02:31:51,190
I'm trying to figure out this... the wheelchair.

4662
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:52,590
Okay.

4663
02:31:54,290 --> 02:31:54,650
Nice.

4664
02:31:54,870 --> 02:31:55,570
This one too.

4665
02:31:55,610 --> 02:31:56,150
The horsey.

4666
02:31:56,530 --> 02:31:56,890
Awesome.

4667
02:31:56,890 --> 02:31:58,870
Are we spraying just every item?

4668
02:31:59,570 --> 02:32:00,310
We have to go back.

4669
02:32:00,390 --> 02:32:00,790
We have to go back.

4670
02:32:00,830 --> 02:32:01,470
We have to find the door.

4671
02:32:01,570 --> 02:32:02,410
We have to find the door.

4672
02:32:02,990 --> 02:32:03,650
Where's the door?

4673
02:32:04,890 --> 02:32:05,570
Where's the door?

4674
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:06,550
I see the yellow door.

4675
02:32:06,710 --> 02:32:07,070
Oh, here.

4676
02:32:07,210 --> 02:32:07,310
Here.

4677
02:32:07,310 --> 02:32:07,550
Before.

4678
02:32:10,190 --> 02:32:11,130
We... Spray the door.

4679
02:32:11,170 --> 02:32:11,350
Wait.

4680
02:32:11,430 --> 02:32:11,550
What?

4681
02:32:13,770 --> 02:32:14,130
No!

4682
02:32:14,410 --> 02:32:16,010
We needed one, two more items!

4683
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:17,050
No!

4684
02:32:18,750 --> 02:32:19,270
What?

4685
02:32:19,450 --> 02:32:21,450
You said we gotta spray the door.

4686
02:32:21,450 --> 02:32:22,790
I thought we... I thought we did it!

4687
02:32:23,250 --> 02:32:25,190
I thought we did it!

4688
02:32:25,610 --> 02:32:27,750
What did... What did I do wrong?

4689
02:32:27,890 --> 02:32:29,170
Did I do something wrong?

4690
02:32:29,330 --> 02:32:31,690
No, we need... We didn't find enough items.

4691
02:32:32,490 --> 02:32:33,190
Oh, shit.

4692
02:32:33,770 --> 02:32:34,290
Whoops.

4693
02:32:34,370 --> 02:32:34,930
I dropped it.

4694
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:36,070
No!

4695
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:42,370
We need to find two more items that's contaminated!

4696
02:32:44,930 --> 02:32:46,830
I thought we found it all!

4697
02:32:49,370 --> 02:32:50,190
Two more.

4698
02:32:50,510 --> 02:32:52,050
Yeah, we need to find two more.

4699
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:53,750
Nooo,

4700
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:59,670
I didn't find all of them!

4701
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:00,110
How about this?

4702
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:00,570
How about this?

4703
02:33:00,570 --> 02:33:01,050
How about this?

4704
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:01,510
How about this?

4705
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:03,090
No.

4706
02:33:03,570 --> 02:33:04,050
Here?

4707
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:04,610
Looking?

4708
02:33:06,030 --> 02:33:06,630
This one?

4709
02:33:07,150 --> 02:33:08,510
How about here?

4710
02:33:08,690 --> 02:33:09,670
How about this area?

4711
02:33:09,910 --> 02:33:10,930
No, there's none.

4712
02:33:11,010 --> 02:33:11,630
There's none here.

4713
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:13,650
I'm looking.

4714
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:18,120
What the fuck?

4715
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:20,920
Is it here?

4716
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:23,080
Can I just spray every item we see?

4717
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:25,640
No.

4718
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:30,520
I mean, technically, yeah.

4719
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:33,200
Right?

4720
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:34,460
Technically, we can.

4721
02:33:34,760 --> 02:33:43,480
But I feel like that's gonna make it harder for us.

4722
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:44,600
Yeah.

4723
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:46,960
Where the fuck?

4724
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:48,840
Where were the last two items?

4725
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:49,540
I can't figure it out.

4726
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:57,380
No, the three we couldn't... I don't know where the last two items are.

4727
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:00,140
I can't find it.

4728
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:03,640
Where's the last two items?

4729
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:04,700
That's radioactive!

4730
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:06,180
Oh no, that's the door.

4731
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:07,220
No, that's the locker.

4732
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:08,320
This one?

4733
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:10,900
Oh my god.

4734
02:34:10,980 --> 02:34:11,740
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4735
02:34:11,780 --> 02:34:14,060
I'm gonna use the spray can.

4736
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:18,220
Oh yeah, true.

4737
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:18,660
Yeah.

4738
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:20,700
Okay, we gotta mark the door.

4739
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:25,260
We're gonna mark the door?

4740
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:29,320
We have to find... Okay, find the ra... Oh shit!

4741
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:30,660
Oh god, that scared me.

4742
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:32,260
That's a smiley face in there.

4743
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:32,720
Don't look.

4744
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:33,180
Oh no.

4745
02:34:33,480 --> 02:34:34,160
Don't look.

4746
02:34:37,660 --> 02:34:39,940
Cup in corner next to the chair?

4747
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:42,960
There's a cup in the corner?

4748
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:45,200
What?

4749
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:45,640
Yes.

4750
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:48,800
Oh my god.

4751
02:34:52,400 --> 02:34:53,440
What is it?

4752
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:55,980
I heard the doggo.

4753
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,860
No, not the doggo.

4754
02:34:58,360 --> 02:34:59,360
Leave us alone.

4755
02:35:00,240 --> 02:35:01,300
Leave us alone.

4756
02:35:01,380 --> 02:35:01,840
Okay, wait, wait.

4757
02:35:01,860 --> 02:35:03,220
Let's mark the items first.

4758
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:04,020
Yeah.

4759
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:07,920
Okay, this one is... Mark this item was radioactive.

4760
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:08,740
Can you mark it?

4761
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:10,120
Okay, okay.

4762
02:35:10,460 --> 02:35:10,940
Yeah, yeah.

4763
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:11,480
With a spray can.

4764
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:12,200
With a spray can.

4765
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:14,100
I have no spray can.

4766
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:15,340
Oh shit.

4767
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:15,920
Wait, what?

4768
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:16,460
Okay.

4769
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:17,180
I have no spray can.

4770
02:35:17,260 --> 02:35:17,460
Okay.

4771
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:18,740
Okay, here.

4772
02:35:18,860 --> 02:35:19,920
I'm gonna drop my spray can.

4773
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:20,960
Here you go.

4774
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:23,520
Um...

4775
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:24,440
Okay.

4776
02:35:26,820 --> 02:35:28,280
Cup is in the similar...

4777
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:29,160
Well, I can pick it up.

4778
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:29,540
Why?

4779
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:31,900
What happened to your spray can?

4780
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:34,740
I can pick it up for the moment.

4781
02:35:35,940 --> 02:35:36,340
Okay.

4782
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:38,480
Well, I can pick it up.

4783
02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:40,140
Oh, I think I got too much item.

4784
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:40,800
Got it.

4785
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:46,680
So, I'm gonna drop one of the... Invalid Peel.

4786
02:35:47,500 --> 02:35:51,220
And... I believe I can grab the spray can right now.

4787
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:51,960
Nice.

4788
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:54,840
Oh, it's the horse?

4789
02:35:58,610 --> 02:35:59,330
The horse?

4790
02:36:00,350 --> 02:36:01,070
The horse?

4791
02:36:01,450 --> 02:36:01,910
Wait, wait.

4792
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:02,270
Come with me.

4793
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:02,630
Come with me.

4794
02:36:02,670 --> 02:36:03,530
I remember where the horse is.

4795
02:36:03,670 --> 02:36:04,070
Come with me.

4796
02:36:07,230 --> 02:36:08,270
Oh, the horse toy.

4797
02:36:08,970 --> 02:36:09,330
Yeah.

4798
02:36:09,430 --> 02:36:09,790
Okay.

4799
02:36:09,850 --> 02:36:11,070
I didn't know... I don't know where the horse is.

4800
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:13,130
I forgot.

4801
02:36:13,290 --> 02:36:13,510
Yeah.

4802
02:36:14,730 --> 02:36:15,310
Where's the horse?

4803
02:36:15,450 --> 02:36:16,270
Is it here?

4804
02:36:16,470 --> 02:36:16,770
Yeah.

4805
02:36:16,810 --> 02:36:17,310
I found it.

4806
02:36:17,350 --> 02:36:17,430
Here.

4807
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:21,480
Okay.

4808
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:25,660
And where's the cup?

4809
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:26,940
Cup?

4810
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:27,400
Okay.

4811
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,620
There's a cup somewhere.

4812
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:30,060
Is it this?

4813
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:30,960
No, that's Moth Jelly.

4814
02:36:34,270 --> 02:36:35,050
Not here.

4815
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:36,250
I'm just gonna go find a cup.

4816
02:36:36,310 --> 02:36:37,190
That's Moth Jelly.

4817
02:36:37,250 --> 02:36:37,970
What do you mean?

4818
02:36:39,210 --> 02:36:41,450
Cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup.

4819
02:36:43,410 --> 02:36:43,810
Papers?

4820
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:46,150
Papers?

4821
02:36:46,930 --> 02:36:47,330
Here.

4822
02:36:47,550 --> 02:36:47,850
Is it?

4823
02:36:47,950 --> 02:36:48,610
Spray the paper.

4824
02:36:48,610 --> 02:36:49,230
Spray the paper.

4825
02:36:50,030 --> 02:36:50,630
How about this one?

4826
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:50,990
How about this paper?

4827
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:52,470
Spray... No!

4828
02:36:52,810 --> 02:36:53,550
Spray the paper.

4829
02:36:53,650 --> 02:36:54,150
Spray it.

4830
02:36:54,270 --> 02:36:54,490
Spray it.

4831
02:36:55,730 --> 02:36:56,690
Doki, doki.

4832
02:36:56,790 --> 02:36:57,330
Doki...

4833
02:36:57,330 --> 02:36:58,270
Just spray it!

4834
02:36:59,330 --> 02:37:00,030
Th... This one?

4835
02:37:01,250 --> 02:37:02,630
Just spray it!

4836
02:37:02,670 --> 02:37:03,510
Spray everything!

4837
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:06,170
Didn't work.

4838
02:37:06,730 --> 02:37:07,870
I don't know!

4839
02:37:07,910 --> 02:37:09,850
I'm spraying everything I see!

4840
02:37:10,210 --> 02:37:10,790
No!

4841
02:37:11,050 --> 02:37:12,070
The time limit!

4842
02:37:15,130 --> 02:37:16,830
Just spray every item!

4843
02:37:16,890 --> 02:37:18,270
It doesn't matter anymore!

4844
02:37:22,910 --> 02:37:25,550
Just spray every item you see!

4845
02:37:25,610 --> 02:37:26,330
We split up!

4846
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:28,490
We split up and start spraying!

4847
02:37:28,790 --> 02:37:30,030
I'll just spray everything I see.

4848
02:37:30,230 --> 02:37:31,450
We split up!

4849
02:37:31,590 --> 02:37:32,250
I can't!

4850
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:34,730
It doesn't matter!

4851
02:37:35,710 --> 02:37:37,770
We have to spray everything!

4852
02:37:41,290 --> 02:37:42,990
Eventually it'll work!

4853
02:37:43,290 --> 02:37:44,590
I've given up.

4854
02:37:45,930 --> 02:37:47,590
Just spray everything!

4855
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:52,980
Spray and pray!

4856
02:37:58,100 --> 02:37:58,780
Okay.

4857
02:37:58,780 --> 02:37:59,460
Alright.

4858
02:37:59,460 --> 02:37:59,600
Alright.

4859
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,640
We must be close.

4860
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:04,320
Alright.

4861
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,220
So anyway, I just started blasting.

4862
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:10,160
Did you spray everything?

4863
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:13,220
I just spray everything I see as possible.

4864
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:13,600
Oh boy!

4865
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:15,980
There's still six items?

4866
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:17,700
It's still working!

4867
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:20,780
There's still six items!

4868
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:21,940
It's not even working!

4869
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:24,260
Keep spraying!

4870
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:31,820
I just keep spraying!

4871
02:38:35,380 --> 02:38:36,920
Eventually it'll work!

4872
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:39,980
I'm not gonna play.

4873
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:40,380
Why?

4874
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:41,960
Did it open?

4875
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:42,920
Did you hear that?

4876
02:38:43,140 --> 02:38:43,800
Did it open?

4877
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:46,120
I sprayed it alive!

4878
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:47,620
I heard the door was open.

4879
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:48,380
No, it's four.

4880
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:50,820
It's four.

4881
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:54,280
Keep spraying!

4882
02:38:54,420 --> 02:38:55,460
Keep spraying!

4883
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:57,420
Oh my god.

4884
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:02,080
Four items.

4885
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:02,580
Okay.

4886
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:05,500
I just keep spraying.

4887
02:39:07,440 --> 02:39:10,340
We have nothing else to spray anymore.

4888
02:39:10,760 --> 02:39:12,320
There has to be more.

4889
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:12,980
Oh, wait.

4890
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:13,640
This one?

4891
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:14,040
Is it?

4892
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:18,300
There's always more!

4893
02:39:24,060 --> 02:39:26,520
There has to be more items!

4894
02:39:29,420 --> 02:39:30,400
I can't find it!

4895
02:39:30,660 --> 02:39:31,640
Wait, wait, wait.

4896
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:34,120
You said I can't walk through!

4897
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:34,920
You said...

4898
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:38,820
I have no idea!

4899
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:39,880
Wait, hold on.

4900
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:41,420
You said you're blocking the door!

4901
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:44,240
I can't spray!

4902
02:39:44,740 --> 02:39:45,580
What about this?

4903
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,520
What about this?

4904
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:48,980
Spray the walls!

4905
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:51,140
What about this?

4906
02:39:53,060 --> 02:39:54,700
Just spray ourselves.

4907
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:55,400
What about this?

4908
02:39:55,740 --> 02:39:58,920
The paper must be radiated too.

4909
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:04,460
I sprayed everything, I swear to god.

4910
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:05,080
Okay.

4911
02:40:05,580 --> 02:40:06,140
Alright.

4912
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:11,060
I'm just gonna...

4913
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:12,840
Three items!

4914
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:15,200
Three items?!

4915
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:15,440
Three more!

4916
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:16,340
Okay.

4917
02:40:17,060 --> 02:40:18,280
Two now, right?

4918
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:21,120
Oh, let's see, let's see.

4919
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:23,800
Okay.

4920
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:26,100
There's still three more, three more.

4921
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:28,040
Okay.

4922
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:34,540
Spray everything.

4923
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:37,690
Do the lockers get radiated?!

4924
02:40:41,930 --> 02:40:43,250
Oh my god.

4925
02:40:45,830 --> 02:40:46,590
Spray everything.

4926
02:40:47,090 --> 02:40:47,370
Yeah.

4927
02:40:47,570 --> 02:40:48,350
I bet.

4928
02:40:48,530 --> 02:40:49,070
Okay.

4929
02:40:51,070 --> 02:40:52,930
Three more, still three more.

4930
02:40:53,210 --> 02:40:53,830
What about now?

4931
02:40:55,730 --> 02:40:56,910
Two, two more!

4932
02:40:57,010 --> 02:40:57,270
Two more!

4933
02:40:57,310 --> 02:40:57,630
Two more!

4934
02:40:58,070 --> 02:41:00,430
Where is the last two?!

4935
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:06,350
I swear to god.

4936
02:41:06,470 --> 02:41:06,770
I just can't!

4937
02:41:07,970 --> 02:41:10,910
I swear to fucking god.

4938
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:14,050
Two more!

4939
02:41:14,670 --> 02:41:15,810
I found one!

4940
02:41:18,070 --> 02:41:19,170
I did it!

4941
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:21,450
I did it!

4942
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:22,270
Sprint everything!

4943
02:41:22,510 --> 02:41:22,870
Let's go!

4944
02:41:27,870 --> 02:41:29,910
Why is this so hard?

4945
02:41:30,190 --> 02:41:31,690
We did it!

4946
02:41:32,010 --> 02:41:33,690
Why is this so hard?

4947
02:41:33,690 --> 02:41:37,290
Alright, there's a creature that wanders aimlessly on some backroom zones.

4948
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:40,070
It seems to have no conscience but until it's hungry.

4949
02:41:40,250 --> 02:41:42,590
At which point it becomes aggressive.

4950
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:45,170
Beings look for the closest subject to eat.

4951
02:41:45,230 --> 02:41:46,810
It distinguishes from other creatures.

4952
02:41:46,910 --> 02:41:48,330
It looks to skin its victims.

4953
02:41:48,490 --> 02:41:49,270
Oh, okay.

4954
02:41:49,610 --> 02:41:50,810
And steal their skin.

4955
02:41:50,930 --> 02:41:53,210
It's reasoning that it can even spell blood over long distance.

4956
02:41:53,610 --> 02:41:55,030
Oh shit, okay.

4957
02:41:57,050 --> 02:41:58,330
Did you get it?

4958
02:41:58,470 --> 02:41:59,590
Yeah, I did.

4959
02:42:00,110 --> 02:42:01,550
But like...

4960
02:42:01,550 --> 02:42:02,950
How do we open?

4961
02:42:03,150 --> 02:42:03,670
Alright, I did it.

4962
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:06,450
Oh my god, okay.

4963
02:42:06,770 --> 02:42:08,270
Oh my god, there is the progress.

4964
02:42:08,750 --> 02:42:10,670
We're doing... I think we're doing fine.

4965
02:42:10,930 --> 02:42:14,290
Oh my god, we're doing so well.

4966
02:42:14,930 --> 02:42:16,290
Yeah, we're going well.

4967
02:42:16,910 --> 02:42:18,150
Oh my god.

4968
02:42:20,170 --> 02:42:20,730
Oh.

4969
02:42:21,630 --> 02:42:22,190
Oh.

4970
02:42:22,430 --> 02:42:22,990
Oh.

4971
02:42:23,270 --> 02:42:23,830
Okay.

4972
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:25,190
Okay.

4973
02:42:26,710 --> 02:42:28,430
I'm a little worried though.

4974
02:42:28,730 --> 02:42:30,670
Wait, are we gonna die if we go down?

4975
02:42:31,230 --> 02:42:32,170
I don't know.

4976
02:42:34,590 --> 02:42:35,610
No, don't do that.

4977
02:42:35,650 --> 02:42:36,110
Don't do that.

4978
02:42:37,270 --> 02:42:37,710
Wait.

4979
02:42:37,710 --> 02:42:38,350
It's locked.

4980
02:42:40,430 --> 02:42:41,410
How do we... Wait.

4981
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:42,230
Wait.

4982
02:42:43,790 --> 02:42:44,230
Wait.

4983
02:42:44,230 --> 02:42:44,910
Where do we go?

4984
02:42:44,950 --> 02:42:45,550
Where are we going?

4985
02:42:46,770 --> 02:42:48,690
Well, I guess we go down.

4986
02:42:49,410 --> 02:42:50,270
Okay, let's go.

4987
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:55,420
Did they die?

4988
02:42:59,380 --> 02:43:00,220
Now what?

4989
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:02,340
We did it!

4990
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:03,340
We beat the level!

4991
02:43:03,560 --> 02:43:04,140
Now what?

4992
02:43:04,140 --> 02:43:05,760
We did it!

4993
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:06,600
You saw me!

4994
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:07,580
We did it!

4995
02:43:08,380 --> 02:43:09,280
Now what?

4996
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:10,080
Yeah!

4997
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:12,600
And this is where we call it.

4998
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:16,820
Okay.

4999
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:17,720
Now what?

5000
02:43:17,860 --> 02:43:18,340
Now what?

5001
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:21,260
This is where we end the game.

5002
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:22,720
The game?

5003
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:25,220
Okay, how about...

5004
02:43:25,220 --> 02:43:25,460
You know what?

5005
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:26,380
I think it's fine.

5006
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:28,380
I think we did really well.

5007
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:29,320
I think, you know...

5008
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:29,980
I think so.

5009
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:30,960
Yeah, you know...

5010
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:32,500
We spent two hours upstream.

5011
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:34,520
And there are a lot of progress.

5012
02:43:35,420 --> 02:43:37,760
Yeah, we made so much progress.

5013
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:38,440
You know...

5014
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:39,340
I think so.

5015
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:40,260
We did.

5016
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:40,820
Yeah.

5017
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:41,820
We did a lot.

5018
02:43:41,820 --> 02:43:46,640
I don't think we don't have to do everything if we, you know, enjoy the game.

5019
02:43:46,700 --> 02:43:47,260
You know what?

5020
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:47,820
Yeah.

5021
02:43:48,780 --> 02:43:49,420
You know what?

5022
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:50,640
I'm proud of myself.

5023
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:52,820
You know, I'm proud of ourselves too.

5024
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:53,760
We did so well.

5025
02:43:53,960 --> 02:43:55,360
We did so well.

5026
02:43:55,960 --> 02:43:58,280
We might have got stuck a lot.

5027
02:43:59,020 --> 02:43:59,500
But...

5028
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:00,740
You know what?

5029
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:01,980
Yeah.

5030
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:03,700
We did so well on easy.

5031
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:04,980
We did so...

5032
02:44:08,360 --> 02:44:13,100
Even though it was easy mode, we were pretty good at this game, right?

5033
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:15,180
I don't believe that it was easy mode.

5034
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:16,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5035
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:18,800
Yeah, guys, I was joking.

5036
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:21,240
When I said it was easy, I meant hard.

5037
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:24,440
We were definitely on hard mode, guys.

5038
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:25,140
Yeah.

5039
02:44:25,160 --> 02:44:25,980
It was definitely...

5040
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:27,860
Yeah, you suck.

5041
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:28,720
Don't believe that.

5042
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:30,080
That was a hard mode, okay, chat?

5043
02:44:30,140 --> 02:44:30,480
Yeah.

5044
02:44:30,480 --> 02:44:32,800
Thank you for coming to this.

5045
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:35,420
Thank you for playing with me, you son.

5046
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:36,620
Thank you too.

5047
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:37,540
That was so much fun.

5048
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:38,700
It was really fun.

5049
02:44:38,740 --> 02:44:42,780
And chat, thank you very much for being really patient at our game talk.

5050
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:49,500
Thank you so much for backseating us, but kindly, you know?

5051
02:44:50,540 --> 02:44:54,200
I will give a credit for you guys for your patience.

5052
02:44:55,880 --> 02:44:59,240
There's no fan base being this much patient.

5053
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:02,620
Dragoon, Yurei, you guys are the best.

5054
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:04,260
And you know what?

5055
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:05,500
Have an awesome day.

5056
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:07,340
Yeah, thank you guys.

5057
02:45:07,460 --> 02:45:09,460
Thank you for coming, you son.

5058
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:10,580
Thank you.

5059
02:45:10,780 --> 02:45:12,600
Oh my god.

5060
02:45:12,620 --> 02:45:13,200
Oh my god.

5061
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:14,160
Thank you, everybody.

5062
02:45:14,700 --> 02:45:18,220
I'm going to talk to my chat real quick, you son.

5063
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:19,720
But thank you again.

5064
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:21,900
I really had a great time.

5065
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:24,660
By the way, chat, there's going to be my 3D concert.

5066
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:27,600
Yeah, yeah, check out Yusuke's 3D concert.

5067
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:30,920
I am definitely not here for self-promote.

5068
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:33,300
Because that's too much sacrifice to myself.

5069
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:37,540
Just for fucking promotion, I sacrificed too much for myself.

5070
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:40,600
I killed so much brain cells for this.

5071
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:41,580
But you know what?

5072
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:44,000
I think it was kind of worth it.

5073
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:44,500
You know?

5074
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:50,060
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

5075
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:52,220
Okay, bye-bye.

5076
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:52,620
Bye-bye.

5077
02:45:52,620 --> 02:45:53,640
Bye-bye.

5078
02:45:56,500 --> 02:45:59,260
Oh my god, I just insta-quit.

5079
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:04,240
I just insta-quit the game.

5080
02:46:08,380 --> 02:46:10,820
Shit, that was so fun.

5081
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:11,840
Oh my god.

5082
02:46:11,940 --> 02:46:14,220
I can't believe we beat the tutorial.

5083
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:17,820
I'm so proud of us.

5084
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:18,940
We did it.

5085
02:46:18,940 --> 02:46:20,400
We beat the tutorial.

5086
02:46:24,540 --> 02:46:27,980
Oh my god, I can't believe.

5087
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:30,460
I can't believe we did the

5088
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:38,740
tutorial.

5089
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:41,280
I swear to fucking god.

5090
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:42,480
I'm going to...

5091
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:43,680
Oh, where am I?

5092
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:45,140
Whoa, okay.

5093
02:46:46,600 --> 02:46:47,880
Oh my god.

5094
02:46:53,400 --> 02:46:56,560
Thank you again to Yusuke for joining me today.

5095
02:46:56,860 --> 02:46:57,660
That was really fun.

5096
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:00,020
I'm going to go read some books.

5097
02:47:00,020 --> 02:47:03,540
Oh my god, I haven't read Super Chats in so long.

5098
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:04,460
Give me a sec.

5099
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:08,420
Donation reading time.

5100
02:47:09,340 --> 02:47:15,000
Oh my gosh, it's been a while since we did donation reading.

5101
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:17,720
So, I'm gonna read some Super Chats.

5102
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:20,440
I'm sorry if I can't get to a lot of the Super Chats today.

5103
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:22,560
I'm a bit tired.

5104
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:27,280
I hope you guys had a lot of fun though.

5105
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:29,520
That was a little bit of a mess.

5106
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:30,660
But we did it.

5107
02:47:30,720 --> 02:47:32,040
We did it everybody!

5108
02:47:32,480 --> 02:47:35,100
We fucking beat the tutorial!

5109
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:38,240
I'm so proud of all of us.

5110
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:39,800
I really am.

5111
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:44,220
It truly was one of the hardest games I've ever played.

5112
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:50,520
I can't believe how much we fucking struggled.

5113
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:53,060
Oh my god, man.

5114
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:55,640
Thank you for all the gifted memberships too!

5115
02:47:55,880 --> 02:47:57,340
Thank you everybody.

5116
02:47:57,580 --> 02:47:58,740
Thank you guys.

5117
02:47:58,860 --> 02:47:59,500
Thank you guys.

5118
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:02,200
Alright, um... let's see.

5119
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:06,040
NS5, how's the backlog of Super Chats?

5120
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:06,740
Thank you for the Super Chat.

5121
02:48:06,820 --> 02:48:07,420
Thank you, thank you.

5122
02:48:07,540 --> 02:48:08,700
It's like pretty rough.

5123
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:10,240
It's a pretty rough backlog.

5124
02:48:10,520 --> 02:48:12,960
I really appreciate all the support.

5125
02:48:13,340 --> 02:48:15,080
I really do appreciate it.

5126
02:48:15,280 --> 02:48:16,100
It's a lot.

5127
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,060
Thank you for the Super Chat.

5128
02:48:19,100 --> 02:48:19,860
Thank you, thank you.

5129
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:24,240
MechanicalLandShark, itoki, what is your favorite design of Shockwave?

5130
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:28,720
G1, Prime, Cylinder, OA, or God forbid live action?

5131
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:30,880
I think like... OG.

5132
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:34,100
The OG one with the mask is my favorite.

5133
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:36,040
Oh wait, sorry, that's Soundwave.

5134
02:48:36,220 --> 02:48:38,760
I don't know why I thought I said Soundwave.

5135
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:41,180
I thought you said Soundwave, not Shockwave.

5136
02:48:41,460 --> 02:48:44,860
Shockwave, I don't really care much about Shockwave's design.

5137
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:49,540
Because like Shockwave wasn't really my favorite Transformer.

5138
02:48:49,540 --> 02:48:51,820
I liked Soundwave more than Shockwave.

5139
02:48:52,380 --> 02:48:55,860
Because like Soundwave was like a fucking DJ.

5140
02:48:56,620 --> 02:48:58,320
So like, for me...

5141
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:02,520
Shockwave, I don't really care too much about their design.

5142
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:08,520
But if I had to pick, I think it'd be like... Prime, I think.

5143
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:10,780
I think Shockwave Prime was a nice design.

5144
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:12,180
Thank you for the Super Chat.

5145
02:49:12,260 --> 02:49:13,080
Thank you, thank you.

5146
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:15,080
ColdDeath, itoki, you're really amazing.

5147
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:15,680
We all support you.

5148
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:16,580
Thank you for the Super Chat.

5149
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:17,680
Thank you, thank you.

5150
02:49:17,820 --> 02:49:18,800
I really appreciate it.

5151
02:49:18,800 --> 02:49:19,460
Thank you so much.

5152
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:22,680
Let's see...

5153
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:24,340
Phoenix, thank you for the Super Chat.

5154
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:25,180
Thank you, thank you.

5155
02:49:25,180 --> 02:49:27,280
Voitan, it was fun to see you, son.

5156
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:28,700
You look for the exit in your room.

5157
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:29,900
You're average office building.

5158
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,020
Thank you for the Super Chat.

5159
02:49:31,140 --> 02:49:31,940
Thank you, thank you.

5160
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:34,640
We got super fucking lost.

5161
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:36,420
I swear to God.

5162
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:38,700
We kept trying to find the fucking...

5163
02:49:39,260 --> 02:49:40,120
I swear to God.

5164
02:49:40,140 --> 02:49:41,680
The amount of times we got...

5165
02:49:41,680 --> 02:49:43,320
We were just stuck in the tutorial...

5166
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:45,280
The elevator beginning.

5167
02:49:46,300 --> 02:49:48,060
I swear to God.

5168
02:49:48,740 --> 02:49:50,660
We were always stuck.

5169
02:49:50,940 --> 02:49:53,520
We always came back to the elevator.

5170
02:49:53,900 --> 02:49:55,340
No matter what.

5171
02:49:55,900 --> 02:49:56,760
Yes, son.

5172
02:49:56,780 --> 02:49:58,100
Thank you for the Akka soup.

5173
02:49:58,100 --> 02:49:59,440
Thank you, thank you.

5174
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:00,700
Thanks, Dragoons.

5175
02:50:00,700 --> 02:50:01,700
Thanks, Doki.

5176
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:03,100
Thank you for the Akka.

5177
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:03,460
Yes.

5178
02:50:04,240 --> 02:50:06,640
Make sure to check out Yu-san.

5179
02:50:06,900 --> 02:50:08,560
And also their covers.

5180
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:09,600
And their music.

5181
02:50:09,880 --> 02:50:11,140
And their original songs.

5182
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:15,280
And also check out their first 3D concert that's coming up.

5183
02:50:15,320 --> 02:50:16,040
I don't remember when.

5184
02:50:16,340 --> 02:50:19,340
I don't remember when.

5185
02:50:19,480 --> 02:50:20,920
But like, it's coming up.

5186
02:50:22,840 --> 02:50:25,500
Simu, can't wait for part 2 of the tutorial.

5187
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:27,020
I can't believe that was the tutorial.

5188
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:28,340
Thank you for the super chat.

5189
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:29,180
Thank you, thank you.

5190
02:50:29,360 --> 02:50:31,020
Mister, remember Doki.

5191
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:33,880
The tutorial was all the friends we made along the way.

5192
02:50:33,980 --> 02:50:34,860
Thank you for the super chat.

5193
02:50:34,960 --> 02:50:35,820
Thank you, thank you.

5194
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:37,540
Pixel, love your stream.

5195
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:39,400
Any chance for Dynasty Warriors 3 someday?

5196
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:40,660
Thank you for the super chat.

5197
02:50:40,720 --> 02:50:41,340
Thank you, thank you.

5198
02:50:41,400 --> 02:50:44,360
Oh my God, I can actually play like the good Dynasty Warriors.

5199
02:50:49,730 --> 02:50:50,910
Oh my God.

5200
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:53,290
We can play the good ones.

5201
02:50:54,290 --> 02:50:55,270
Oh my God.

5202
02:50:55,290 --> 02:50:56,630
Maybe in the future.

5203
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:58,290
Thank you for the super chat.

5204
02:50:58,350 --> 02:50:59,530
Thank you, thank you.

5205
02:51:04,150 --> 02:51:04,670
Let's see.

5206
02:51:04,810 --> 02:51:06,730
Where was I in the super chat?

5207
02:51:11,250 --> 02:51:12,890
Doki, I think this is dead.

5208
02:51:13,130 --> 02:51:13,770
The dog.

5209
02:51:14,070 --> 02:51:15,050
Thank you for the super chat.

5210
02:51:15,110 --> 02:51:15,830
Thank you, thank you.

5211
02:51:16,070 --> 02:51:17,750
Mister 2, we beat the tutorial.

5212
02:51:17,970 --> 02:51:18,450
Let's go!

5213
02:51:18,830 --> 02:51:20,290
I hope to see Yuusan again.

5214
02:51:20,410 --> 02:51:20,710
It was fun.

5215
02:51:20,770 --> 02:51:21,310
Thank you for the super chat.

5216
02:51:21,390 --> 02:51:21,890
Thank you, thank you.

5217
02:51:21,890 --> 02:51:22,470
I hope so too.

5218
02:51:22,650 --> 02:51:25,350
I hope we do more collabs in the future with Yuusan.

5219
02:51:26,210 --> 02:51:27,390
Anyway, thank you for the super chat.

5220
02:51:27,450 --> 02:51:28,010
Thank you, thank you.

5221
02:51:28,010 --> 02:51:29,870
Watching all play was a rollercoaster.

5222
02:51:29,950 --> 02:51:31,390
But it was also so much fun.

5223
02:51:31,590 --> 02:51:32,910
Keep being awesome, Doki.

5224
02:51:32,970 --> 02:51:33,850
Thank you for the super chat.

5225
02:51:33,970 --> 02:51:35,010
Thank you, thank you.

5226
02:51:35,010 --> 02:51:36,530
I'm glad you guys enjoyed that collab.

5227
02:51:37,370 --> 02:51:39,590
It's nice to be able to collab with them.

5228
02:51:39,750 --> 02:51:43,850
And I can't wait to do lots of collabs with lots of different people in the future.

5229
02:51:44,570 --> 02:51:44,970
Saber!

5230
02:51:45,070 --> 02:51:45,870
Vocal exercise.

5231
02:51:45,990 --> 02:51:47,170
Thank you for the super chat.

5232
02:51:47,270 --> 02:51:48,150
Thank you, thank you.

5233
02:51:48,930 --> 02:51:52,170
I like how the only time I died was when I just gave up.

5234
02:51:56,430 --> 02:51:57,930
I was just like...

5235
02:51:58,670 --> 02:51:59,390
Fuck this.

5236
02:51:59,810 --> 02:52:02,350
I don't even know where the fucking eye is!

5237
02:52:02,710 --> 02:52:05,870
Just let this end me.

5238
02:52:06,350 --> 02:52:07,690
Anyway, thank you for the super chat.

5239
02:52:07,770 --> 02:52:08,370
Thank you, thank you.

5240
02:52:08,430 --> 02:52:09,990
Watching all play was a rollercoaster.

5241
02:52:10,130 --> 02:52:11,430
But it was also so much fun.

5242
02:52:11,750 --> 02:52:12,790
Wait, did I just read that?

5243
02:52:12,950 --> 02:52:13,670
I'm so sorry.

5244
02:52:13,790 --> 02:52:15,130
If I did, thank you for the super chat.

5245
02:52:15,210 --> 02:52:15,910
Thank you, thank you.

5246
02:52:15,990 --> 02:52:17,670
Your first super chat, Adrien.

5247
02:52:17,750 --> 02:52:18,230
Thank you!

5248
02:52:18,650 --> 02:52:21,050
The two of you make up one brain cell in that tutorial.

5249
02:52:21,210 --> 02:52:21,890
Peak content.

5250
02:52:21,950 --> 02:52:22,810
Keep it up.

5251
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:24,430
Thank you for the super chat.

5252
02:52:24,550 --> 02:52:25,390
Thank you, thank you.

5253
02:52:26,330 --> 02:52:26,690
PoonV!

5254
02:52:26,690 --> 02:52:27,570
Thank you for the machenta!

5255
02:52:28,030 --> 02:52:28,730
Thank you!

5256
02:52:31,530 --> 02:52:34,150
Liquid, thank you for the super chat!

5257
02:52:34,270 --> 02:52:34,470
Thank you!

5258
02:52:34,770 --> 02:52:40,270
Just got home from driving in the snow storm and had your stream playing in the background.

5259
02:52:40,510 --> 02:52:41,970
I was focused on the road, of course.

5260
02:52:42,110 --> 02:52:43,390
Thank you for keeping me company!

5261
02:52:43,590 --> 02:52:44,610
Thank you for the super chat!

5262
02:52:44,770 --> 02:52:45,050
Thank you!

5263
02:52:47,550 --> 02:52:49,390
I'm glad that I kept you company.

5264
02:52:50,370 --> 02:52:51,810
I'm glad you guys...

5265
02:52:53,050 --> 02:52:56,430
I'm glad you guys have all enjoyed today's stream.

5266
02:52:56,430 --> 02:52:57,710
That was really, really fun.

5267
02:52:57,850 --> 02:52:59,870
Before the stream, I was super tired too.

5268
02:53:00,210 --> 02:53:03,270
I feel like every time I'm not streaming, I'm just very tired.

5269
02:53:03,390 --> 02:53:07,450
I was so tired physically and mentally.

5270
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:12,570
And so I was just like, Oh man, I hope I'll be able to stream.

5271
02:53:12,690 --> 02:53:13,890
I feel so tired.

5272
02:53:13,990 --> 02:53:17,770
But every time I turn on the stream, I just go like 100%.

5273
02:53:17,770 --> 02:53:19,990
I was just like, alright, let's go.

5274
02:53:20,990 --> 02:53:22,290
Let's fucking go.

5275
02:53:22,830 --> 02:53:24,610
I'm a content creator.

5276
02:53:27,510 --> 02:53:28,790
I got this!

5277
02:53:29,430 --> 02:53:30,650
I can do this!

5278
02:53:32,690 --> 02:53:34,030
Thank you for the super chat.

5279
02:53:34,110 --> 02:53:34,930
Thank you, thank you.

5280
02:53:36,830 --> 02:53:38,810
Welcome to the Ambership.

5281
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:41,470
I really appreciate it.

5282
02:53:41,530 --> 02:53:42,290
Thank you, thank you.

5283
02:53:43,130 --> 02:53:44,350
Black, thank you for the super chat.

5284
02:53:44,410 --> 02:53:45,130
Thank you, thank you.

5285
02:53:45,310 --> 02:53:49,030
Sometimes when you're lost, it's great to go back at the start to figure out your way.

5286
02:53:49,130 --> 02:53:52,450
You saw while being lost going back to the tutorial door.

5287
02:53:53,170 --> 02:53:55,750
Thank you for the super chat.

5288
02:53:55,750 --> 02:53:56,650
Thank you, thank you.

5289
02:53:56,750 --> 02:53:57,710
I can't believe.

5290
02:53:57,910 --> 02:53:59,750
Okay, Nem, thank you for the magenta super.

5291
02:54:00,030 --> 02:54:00,950
Thank you, thank you.

5292
02:54:01,010 --> 02:54:06,270
I can't believe the eye was in the locker the entire time.

5293
02:54:06,470 --> 02:54:08,710
I can't believe it.

5294
02:54:09,370 --> 02:54:10,890
The one...

5295
02:54:10,890 --> 02:54:15,610
The room we hid in for so long.

5296
02:54:15,750 --> 02:54:19,330
We kept hiding in the room.

5297
02:54:19,390 --> 02:54:21,010
We kept hiding in.

5298
02:54:21,150 --> 02:54:25,250
And it was in there the entire time.

5299
02:54:25,250 --> 02:54:27,270
I can't believe it.

5300
02:54:28,290 --> 02:54:30,710
None of us looked at it.

5301
02:54:30,770 --> 02:54:32,830
We all did not think it was there.

5302
02:54:33,230 --> 02:54:35,690
I kept in that room so fucking long.

5303
02:54:35,950 --> 02:54:38,690
And I didn't even realize it was there.

5304
02:54:41,850 --> 02:54:43,470
Andrew, thank you for the super chat.

5305
02:54:43,590 --> 02:54:44,310
Thank you, thank you.

5306
02:54:44,390 --> 02:54:48,070
Horror games are scary, but your uratics and nissan's hyperventilation.

5307
02:54:48,230 --> 02:54:50,090
I honestly could not take your fear seriously.

5308
02:54:50,890 --> 02:54:52,090
Thank you for the super chat.

5309
02:54:52,270 --> 02:54:53,390
Thank you, thank you.

5310
02:54:53,470 --> 02:54:54,070
All right.

5311
02:54:54,070 --> 02:54:55,970
I'm going to call it here now.

5312
02:54:56,550 --> 02:54:57,110
And...

5313
02:54:58,450 --> 02:54:59,870
And rest up.

5314
02:55:00,050 --> 02:55:03,330
But thank you everybody for all the super chats.

5315
02:55:03,570 --> 02:55:05,510
I'm really sorry if I couldn't read yours in time.

5316
02:55:05,930 --> 02:55:07,330
But thank you everybody.

5317
02:55:07,570 --> 02:55:09,710
I really had an amazing time.

5318
02:55:10,650 --> 02:55:11,890
Hanging out with everybody.

5319
02:55:12,310 --> 02:55:16,210
And playing this game with you, son.

5320
02:55:16,410 --> 02:55:19,830
I hope you guys had an amazing time with us.

5321
02:55:20,190 --> 02:55:22,390
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

5322
02:55:22,690 --> 02:55:23,210
Posture check.

5323
02:55:23,250 --> 02:55:23,990
Get up and move around.

5324
02:55:24,070 --> 02:55:25,130
To get that blood flowing.

5325
02:55:25,210 --> 02:55:28,790
If you stayed up for me, head to bed.

5326
02:55:29,170 --> 02:55:31,450
Because you deserve it.

5327
02:55:31,730 --> 02:55:33,090
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5328
02:55:33,410 --> 02:55:34,110
Bye, guys.

5329
02:55:34,750 --> 02:55:35,150
Bye.
