That's not bullying.

6
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,560
That's just a challenge.

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,260
Well, you want me to start talking about touching my balls?

8
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,320

What about it, Lily?

33
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,780
Why did that give us your first thing you want to say?

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,020
Do you have something to tell us?

35
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,940
I don't know.

36
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm, I just figured I, okay, I guess we're not really on the
same wavelength here.

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,100
Oh, okay.

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,260
I just thought that maybe, you know, maybe you're just
coincidentally.

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,380
googled for absolutely no reason whatsoever what it's like
to have them why did you google in awards for me what it

40
00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:05,060
might be like i i wasn't yeah yeah at all can you explain
into the class i wasn't seeing any suspicious growth it's

41
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:12,580

do you even see them yeah how do you oh wait are they inside

42
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,260
wait Maybe I was just investigating my health.

43
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,960
That's the blowhole blast.

44
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,560
Can you buy one of those doctor equipments?

45
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,340
She's got a camera and like a tube.

46
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,260
Oh, no.

47
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,560
Loki, that's what you do with the prize money.

48
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,440
What the fuck?

49
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,880
How did you know?

50
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,020
That would be so funny.

51
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,780
Are you going to make a stream just dedicated to that?

52
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,920
I need to defend.

53
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,800
Okay, okay, okay.

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,740
But if you had one of those, which hole would you stick it
in first?

55
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,860
I think nose will be so funny.

56
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,240
Nose?

57
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,980
The nose.

58
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,400
The nose.

59
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,340
Because, like, it's, like, weird.

60
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,740
And, okay, maybe that's just me, but if you stick it up your
butt, it's, like, what do you expect?

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,740
Like, you kind of know what to expect.

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,460
But, like, the nose, it's, like, it's full of, like, hairs,
and, like, maybe it's tiny, but maybe it's also just, like,

63
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,200
a fat boogie.

64
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,060
Like, it's full of surprises, man.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,640
If the camera is small enough, you can stick it down the
edge of your eye.

66
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,940
Oh, goodness.

67
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,100
Whoa.

68
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:13,940
The end.

69
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,000

one should be easiest yeah i can do this first one i can

110
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:22,380

that's the that's the great part we're just power level yeah

114
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:58,100
we're trusting the process just trust the process also like
we know that legendaries are like 360 points but sure for

115
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:05,240

furry There's like but then there's like a degree.

169
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,270
It's like a spectrum.

170
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:06,210
It's like a furry spectrum I think you're so smart you think
you're so smart.

171
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,110
What's 25 plus 25, huh?

172
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,840

What's 25 plus 25, huh?

174
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,840
Is that a trick question?

175
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,320
No, it's a math.

176
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,120
math question.

177
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,760
No way.

178
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,000

Guys, you're supposed to play a video game.

200
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:33,840
Okay, so they said they said they said don't do anything and
we're not allowed to do anything But but like we're about to

201
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,960

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,520
What do we do?

203
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,240
What do we do?

204
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
We're gonna get invaded.

205
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
We're gonna get invaded.

206
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,400
Tell the admins we're literally getting invaded.

207
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,340
We are being invaded.

208
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,120
We are being raided.

209
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,540
We have to fight back!

210
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
We can't we can't really uh...

211
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,940
It's away, but it's the tacos!

212
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,040
I know we need tacos too!

213
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,380
Oh wait, I've already killed them.

214
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,340
Wait, never mind, they're on their way, they're on their
way.

215
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,940
Oh, I have to close the server.

216
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,240
Oh my gosh.

217
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,180
Oh shit.

218
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,160
Wait, I thought they said everything was good.

219
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,160
I thought you said once you checked in, you can start the
server.

220
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,720
I also thought once you checked in.

221
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,740
I thought so too, they were like, okay, just log in, but
don't leave.

222
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,740
Like not already did.

223
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,860
Server is closed anyways.

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
Problem solved.

225
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,440
We solved it, guys!

226
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,500
We closed the server.

227
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,240
Did they check the settings?

228
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,140
I don't know, man.

229
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,440
We didn't do anything.

230
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,800
I thought we were in the green to start.

231
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,620
We were shocked.

232
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,460
Wait, they were like, no, they're giving conflicting
information.

233
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,280
The admins don't even know.

234
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,380
Listen, all I'm saying is he's...

235
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,500
He was saying, please wait for our communication.

236
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,960
The last time he didn't told us we got checked and we
started late.

237
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:01,940
And then but then the person beneath it was like now if
you're being raided, you can fight so technically We don't

238
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,840
need the closest server Who's right?

239
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,800
Who's the alpha admin?

240
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:18,040
All right, tell me now we can start now we can start the
world Okay, all right, it's the same code Yeah, it made a

241
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,820
big difference.

242
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,600
No session found though.

243
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,240
I need the code.

244
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,220
We need the code.

245
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,100
Yeah, no session found because I'm stuck It now we're late
again.

246
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,420
No, we have three minutes to start.

247
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,560
You don't have time yet.

248
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,300

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,820
It was yeah.

255
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,660
Oh, you're right.

256
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:02,020

We're just here to check.

265
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,720
Unless we get raided, then we can kill, but not.

266
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,360
Then we can fight.

267
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,020

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,780
I'm stealing this ball.

342
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,580
Thank you.

343
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,320
I have a lot of mats if people want.

344
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,820
I'm gonna make another chest to put these mats in.

345
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,760
I think I'm gonna make a chest to sort stuff a bit more
efficiently because it'll take so much time to go through

346
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,780
all the chests.

347
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,880
Let's see.

348
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,080
So I'm gonna redo the chest if anyone wants.

349
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:31,640
honey i put the ice organs too i and then yeah if you want
to resort stuff you can what the fuck see half the reason

350
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,060
they're getting trapped is because the this like piece of
like the cliff we're on is made out of this stone that they

351
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:50,620
can fall through no you're so fucking stupid no it's not our
fault they're pretty it's just our pals are pretty stupid

352
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:56,340
it's not our fault all right i'm just gonna send it over
here all right let's see I have to do...

353
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,940
What do I have to do again?

354
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,220
Alright, I'm gonna go start killing some pals.

355
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,440
I'm just gonna try to put them further apart so that they
don't get stuck on each other.

356
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,260
Okay, I make one big chest, which is just like common
materials.

357
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,800
So whenever you come to the base real quick, you can just
dump all your like common shit in there.

358
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,420
Alright, I'm gonna get the mozzarella meat for us.

359
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,180
And then...

360
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,320
Okay, it should have enough storage for everything dumped.

361
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,490
Okay, I'm gonna try to get this shell off the...

362
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,020
Well, I should get a misandra right now for us, actually.

363
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,200
I feel like that'd be the easiest.

364
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,920
Because we need a misandra.

365
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,240
Alright, I need to grab this bee.

366
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,480
Okay.

367
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,640
Alright, let's go.

368
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,080
Alright, put the bee in the right pouch.

369
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,420
We fly.

370
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,260
Where am I?

371
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,660

372
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,600
We fly.

373
00:21:53,140 --> 00:22:02,420

374
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:10,580
uh okay we still need 250 ingot but once we get 250 ingot
after that it all just becomes refined ingot so we need to

375
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:18,080
stop making like a crap ton unless we need it for other
things oh we need the ingots for the balls so yeah balls i

378
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,540
right that's what we need okay i need to go set up the the
coal base so i'll go do that what gender do we need for the

379
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:55,300
massandra um massandra what is the pedal pedal one the

393
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:58,660
I'm just gonna respawn it He's somewhere oh I think this
base that they always walk like a really weird path and

394
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:06,320
they're like like five bases ahead they're just walking
they're like goodbye they're just it's just too good our

395
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:19,760
base is just good you know like where is she going or but

Love the game, but anyway, it's your fault.

402
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay, well, I took the beds off the rock for the most part,
so they should get stuck in the rock.

403
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,320
Okay, there's two.

404
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,720
There's a male and a female, but we'll kill.

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,040
Oh my goodness, why is he stuck up there?

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,780
My eight arrows.

407
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,560
You can do this.

408
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,720
My eight arrows.

409
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,560
Go, Vanuil.

411
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,640

Upgrading base.

415
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,380
Okay, that's the female.

416
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,480
We don't care about the female.

417
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,200
Oh, God.

Nice.

435
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,020

Uh...

440
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,700
If there's no eggs, we can just kill some chickens.

441
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,680
Yeah, we can kill chickens or I can throw one in the ranch
maybe.

442
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,860
Alright, I need to find a fast traveler.

443
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,160
What the fuck are you doing over here?

444
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,620
I have... I caught a masandra so you can breed it at any
time you want.

445
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,660
Nice.

446
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,900
Let it have a good time.

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,260
Oh yeah, sure.

448
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,680
Remember to put a patalia in the...

449
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,220
in the base whenever you have time.

450
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,740
I'm using her right now.

451
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,420
What?

452
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,780
Why you gotta say it like that?

453
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,980
What are you using her for?

454
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,640
She's in my party.

455
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,320
Mm-hmm.

456
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,260
And what is her purpose in your party?

457
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,100
To break it.

458
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,660
To break it.

459
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
To break it.

460
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,180
Where the fuck is he?

461
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,060
It's a fast travel.

462
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,640
It was one.

463
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,420
Okay, I'll make a barrel at the base and that barrel will
have the spheres all the time.

464
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,040
Yes, I need some giga spears right now.

465
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,380
Can we make a conveyor belt already?

466
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,200
I think we need circuit boards for that though.

467
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:32,980
Yeah, we just...

468
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,660
If we can build a...

469
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,940
If we can build a...

470
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,280
Oh, well, we have a...

471
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,680
Oh, yeah, we need to make the power generation.

472
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,720
Yeah, we need circuit boards.

473
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,680
Like, right away.

474
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah, I think...

475

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,400
Yeah, we just...

477
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,800

572
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,200
name.

573
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,920
I think it's just because, like, I guess it's like Dark
Souls-esque, too.

574
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,900
So it's like...

575
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,140
Yeah.

576
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,460

Oh, another thing.

580
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:12,540
If you see any electric, that's, like, large electric eggs,
that's another way to get Grisbolt that is, like, less of a

581
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,640
hassle if anybody has any.

582
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,600

583
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,460

594
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,880
Maybe I should not use a vanworm.

595
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,720
Maybe I should use a sweeper.

596
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,240
No, why are you hungry?

597
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,820

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,440
What did I not pay- this is not what I paid you for because
you're not getting paid in general.

614
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,080
Yeah, you don't really get paid, but...

615
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,840
You're allowed to survive if you make balls.

616
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,640
Yeah.

617
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,900
Earn your food.

00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,440
Your use to me is your ball production.

619
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,780
Don't worry, they're gonna be able to make balls faster in a
second.

620
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,860
Oh yeah, this is Assembly line.

00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,000
I can try and catch a ray hound.

640
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,920
You can't catch a grisbolt, right?

641
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,500
Unless we go to the sanctuary, right?

642
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,660
Can you catch a grisbolt?

643
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,080

yourself our comfy does not cover medical costs no insurance

673
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,620
this is a north American Tournament, baby.

674
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,420
I feel like a North American Tournament does cover for
medical costs.

675
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Maybe half.

676
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,520
If you're lucky.

677
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,240
Where the fuck is the repair?

678
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,200
Do we have any medicine?

679
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,600
No, we don't even have a medicine bar.

680
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,520
Oh, wait.

681
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,220
I have some medicine.

682
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:35,500
Hold on.

683
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:35,720
Wait a minute.

684
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,160
Let's see.

685
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,720
I'm trying to put away...

686
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,600
I'm putting away...

687
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,820
Mining away.

688
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,820
I don't know what's left of mine, I mine it anyways.

689
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,260
It's Minecraft world, so beautiful.

690
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Nice.

691
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,120
That was beautiful, guys.

692
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,200
Mine diamonds!

693
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,460
What will you do a karaoke stream, Sheriff for?

694
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,060
You have the voice for it.

695
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,040
I wonder where I feel like it.

696
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,120
Why won't you give your Chad karaoke?

697
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,260
I need to find a way to give reverb on my voice.

698
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,680
That's how you sound nice.

699
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,360
You can just do reverb.

700
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:21,540
Yeah.

701
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,600
Okay, how do I do that?

702
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,800
It's so just get a go XLR.

703
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:33,820
Last time I got a go XLR, I plugged that shit in and
downloaded the software, and nothing worked, and I was too

704
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,800
lazy, so I gave it.

705
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,300
Why would you mean nothing worked?

706
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,260
I don't know.

707
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
I was pressing buttons.

708
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,420
There's no thing.

709
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,920
I don't know how to make the noises.

710
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,620
There's no thing.

711
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,400
There's no thing.

712
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,480
There's no thang.

713
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,140
No thang just sticking out.

714
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,600
Just watch a YouTube tutorial.

715
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
I found a solution to our fox having an ulcer.

716
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,260
I replaced him with a different fox.

717
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,480
We don't need him anyway.

718
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,300
Medical carrot.

719
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,300
No, thank you.

720
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,980
We're just replacing him.

721
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,640
Holy fuck.

722
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,600
It's okay.

723
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,680
We'll get a scab.

724
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,620
Is that it?

725
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,480
Welcome to capitalism.

726
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,280
Scabs are allowed in this company.

727
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:24,500
Jesus Christ I've been mining this whole time Oh, I thought
you were supposed to power it level Yeah, I need balls for

728
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:24,900
that.

729
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,380
I'm gonna try to collect a bunch of shit I'm heading to
catch a right hound now.

730
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:37,260
Oh Sick, we got another bushy All right All right, come over
here.

731
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,140
It's right hound time Am I heading the right way?

732
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,120
Does anybody have any eggs incubators empty?

733
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,000
Nope, no, I'm not on me.

734
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,940
There might be one in the chest.

735
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,800
Oh, yeah, we don't have electricity.

736
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,420
We got one common.

737
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,420
So, like, we can't make balls anymore.

738
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,180
We can have electricity already.

739
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,160
I can make one right now.

740
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,540
Yeah.

741
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,340
Hell yeah, brother.

742
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,820
Oh, wait, no, we need 100 ingot.

743
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,600
That's what I was waiting for.

744
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,360
Oh, shit.

745
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,240
Yeah.

746
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,060
We need it, though, so...

747
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,140
Just make more furnaces.

748
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,340
That's our, like, only answer to make more...

749
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,180
We don't even have enough firepower to take care of the
furnace and make more.

750
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,320
Should we?

751
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,580
We should...

752
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,020
No, it's kind of a waste of mats.

753
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,260
I was gonna say we can make the better furnace, but we might
as well just wait until we can make the electric furnace.

754
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,520
We should like...

755
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,020
How much are we from leveling up the base?

756
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,260
What do we need for base level?

757
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,460
Right now for a base level up...

758
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,180
Give me a second.

759
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,400
We need the power generators, so we need...

760
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,360
I'm just waiting on the ingot.

761
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:43,920
Okay.

762
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,440
so if we can hold off on balls for a second i just need to i
need 50 ingots here that's sure for we need 50 i need the

763
00:43:51,440 --> 00:44:00,860
balls i need the balls i can't level right now i can't level
i have to kill everything where the fuck are the what about

764
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:15,380
my balls i have a heat resistant armor now i just need to
find the rye hounds rye hounds where are you uh is the wheat

765
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:23,780
ready yet yes cool okay i can start breeding what are you
trying to make with the ingots uh i need to make the power

766
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:33,260
generator so i need 50 or do i need to go for it yeah i have
41 i think we need more mining pals we're kind of behind on

767
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:42,300
rock and stuff agree i think you have to mine at yourself at
this point it would be really the mining pals don't dig like

768
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:49,400
at all they're like if we can get the dig toys can't we do
the can't we dig toys we need to catch them in the desert

769
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:59,100
yeah isn't dick toys still bugged they're bugged every every
mind pal is bugged they don't i thought they were a turtle

770
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:13,730
that's oh yeah everybody in my chat says dig toys bad okay
yeah it's super buggy right now dig toys is good if you use

771
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:21,990
it yourself yeah yeah but not as like mine well no pal is
good at mining like yeah it's just they're all trying to

772
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:29,190
make auto yeah trying to make auto farms is useless right
now in this game i might land with like a different like

773
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:37,210
mining pal it works so well like it doesn't respawn fast
enough for them to have much to do well you actually got

774
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,570
your pals to collect all the yeah like it works flawless
it's just a eu div it's

775
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:55,470
you guys it would have worked whenever i had my pals trying
to collect stuff they would just pick it up drop it pick it

776
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:01,750
up drop it and there just be giant piles everywhere i think
it just depends on how your base is set up too because i

777
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:09,410
have had problems with like pals picking up my shit because
i made a very specific base to yeah avoid all the passing

778
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:20,010
issues like uh i build like walls and pathways and stuff
specifically cake all right we made our first cake nice now

779
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:30,470
bleed i guess we'll start with anubis because he's the most
useful for the base i'm handing over to can anubis mine uh

780
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:37,990
anubis can do handiwork and then you can replace the
breeding pals too because some of them are useless anyway

781
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:50,100
i'm handing over to this waypoint where the is the rye hound
i need a female rye hound right Because we have a male

782
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,800
massager.

783
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,640
Yeah, if we're going to make Grisbold that way.

784
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,160
Yeah, I can't find him.

785
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,520
Oh, I made the electric thing.

786
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,140
Oh, you made it already?

787
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,500
Nice.

788
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,020
Okay, cool.

789
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,240
Now I just need a pal that can power it.

790
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,740
Oh, wait, you made it?

791
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:05,920
Is it being built?

792
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:06,800
Okay, okay.

793
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,300
Thanks.

794
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,620
I'm trying to find the Rai Hound wherever you are.

795
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,380
Wait, Anubis also has mining.

796
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,840
We might want to consider making more than one Anubis.

797
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,780
Just to get the mining.

798
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:26,320
all right control because it slows down the ball the ball
production a ton i have to just like mine manually the whole

799
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:40,460
time i'm just trying to find our little dog in this sad
world out here yeah i feel like the base being 50 on newbies

800
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:48,720
is like actually the play yeah honestly like we just breed a
couple of them real quick make electrical and then some

801
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,580
handy work The rest is mining.

802
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,340
That will solve all the ball issues.

803
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,520
Oh, that would, yeah.

804
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,320
Honestly.

805
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,440
Oh, my God, Lily, you're brainstorming.

806
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,160
I'm brainstorming.

807
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,460
Your brain is enlarging right now.

808
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,660
I'm doing it.

809
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,540
My game crashed.

839
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:22,730
Oh, I put one in.

840
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,270
I put one in.

841
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,010
Okay, nice.

842
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,090
Whoa!

843
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,650
These guys hurt!

844
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:28,450
Holy shit!

845
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:29,910
How did I miss?

846
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,670
Are you fucking kidding me?

847
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,770
I'm just stuck here making fucking cake.

848
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:37,070
You know what?

849
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:37,930
I should just go do something else.

850
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:38,710
I'm gonna go do something else.

851
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,430
The spear isn't working on Dazzy levels already.

852
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,570
Try using a better spear.

853
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,430
Wait, what?

854
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:46,490
The Giga spear doesn't work on a Dazzy?

855
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,630
What the fuck do you need?

856
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:51,690
What?

857
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,930
Oh, giga, mega, ultra sphere!

858
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,490
Oh, there you go, there you go, I just need to damage more.

859
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,110
Oh, thank god, I was like, there's no way.

860
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,950
There's no way it doesn't work.

861
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:03,410
Come on.

862
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:04,490
Yes.

863
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:05,930
Yes.

864
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,710
Alright, nice, some levels already.

865
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,010
Let's see, I can...

866
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:14,290
Okay.

867
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,470
Alright, I'm gonna catch these tokotokos.

868
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,250
Okay, cool, cool.

869
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,310
Get over here, tokotokos.

870
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,790
Alright, we need to make more wheat.

871
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,170
Ooh.

872
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,220
Okay, nice.

873
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,020
Oh, fuck.

874
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,740
That is unlucky.

875
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,480
I'm cooking.

876
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,200
Why do they have to sleep at night, bro?

877
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,260
Are you using the Igness?

878
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,420
You have it.

879
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,740
It's not on base.

880
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,840
It's on base right now.

881
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,840
Pretty sure.

882
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,160
I just make it cook real quick.

883
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,580
Oh shit, it's hot.

884
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,940
Oh no, it's hot now.

885
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,120
No gathering.

886
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,660
You must make ore.

887
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,040
You must make ore now.

888
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:20,000
If you want pure ingots, you could teleport to the other
base I have and then just mine that.

889
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:24,920
Oh no, he's... how am I missing?

890
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,660
Give me that toko toko.

891
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,060
Yay!

892
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,380
not have, wait, a better workbench?

893
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,340
We should.

894
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:38,800
No, we do.

895
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:39,780
It's right over here.

896
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,160
All we do here.

897
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:40,540
Yep.

898
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,060
Sorry, there's cement on it right now.

899
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,900
Don't worry.

900
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,160
I'll try and work with it.

901
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:45,540
Alright.

902
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,980
I'll just keep cooking cake.

903
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,280
I'll just keep cooking cake.

904
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,040
Rihon, where are you?

905
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,200
I should be able to make the...

906
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:56,800
What do we need?

907
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,700
What do we need in level 32 and 33?

908
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:13,400
We need to make the hot springs the better hot springs and
we need to make the just about there uh the weapon assembly

909
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:22,840
line okay i'm almost i'm like level 30 now i should get to

summit all right

911
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:34,580
Okay.

912
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:42,700
If cement is already in the thing, then we should have
everything, I think, to build the thing.

913
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,380
The thing?

914
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,300
The hot springs?

915
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,980
We just need to level.

916
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,240
Yeah.

917
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,440
When we're thinging the thing?

918
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

919
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,020
Oh, yeah, yeah.

920
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,000
The thing for the thing for the hot spring?

921
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:53,820
Yeah.

922
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:54,900
Exactly.

923
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:55,860
It's so easy.

924
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,300
Oh, God, I can't fly.

925
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,860
Why is it all just a die?

926
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,600
I swear, these dogs are the hardest shit I've ever...

927
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,280
The hardest shit.

928
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:10,820
to find oh hey there's an electric egg wait oh nice this egg
could hatch it hopefully it's a gris bolt if it's a gris

929
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:18,620
then wait what what size is it has to be i haven't found a
large electric egg this is faster is it no way i'll try and

930
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:33,430
find a dog just in case i see him slower hi guys am i in the
right place chat my back seaters i am there's level 36 okay

931
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:38,850
this is awkward um okay i I did not realize they're level
36.

932
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,090
They're big boys.

933
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:41,330
Wow, they're...

934
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:42,190
Yeah, I mean...

935
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,030
This is bad.

936
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,690
Okay, I don't think this is faster, but...

937
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,090
I might die.

938
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:47,870
Just...

939
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:48,290
Uh-oh.

940
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,670
Rival.

941
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,650
Chucky might die.

942
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,070
Hopefully, that electric egg is just a grisble.

943
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:54,670
No, we're done.

944
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:58,890
Yeah, but if I die, we won't get the electric egg.

945
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,090
I'm gonna see if I can catch one, though.

946
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,090
I'm gonna...

947
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,410
I'm gonna try my best.

948
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:05,170
You know what?

949
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:06,470
Uh...

950
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,370
I'm just gonna, you know, I'm not testing this.

951
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,730
I'm gonna, I'm gonna bank it all on this electric egg.

952
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:12,510
Fuck this.

953
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:19,270
Actually, unless, there's one, okay, I can separate this one
guy.

954
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,210
I'm right, there's two.

955
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,830
No, you!

956
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,130
You're the one guy?

957
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,790
I'm gonna one guy, this guy.

958
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:24,590
Dang.

959
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,410
Make balls.

960
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,250
Oh my god, please, please don't run away.

961
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,230
This guy's level 34.

962
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,030
Wait, what gender do I need them to be?

963
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,490
I forgot.

964
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:33,230
What's the relaxatoris gender?

965
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,210
It doesn't matter, just get him.

966
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:36,990
No, the relaxatoris, I would need to ask, sure, I think.

967
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,050
I think you have one.

968
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,410
I have one too.

969
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,990
Like, I don't...

970
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:41,470
Is that male or female?

971
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:42,550
You know?

972
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,450
Pretty sure I only killed the live sources.

973
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,090
I have one as well, so...

974
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,250
Yeah, we need him, but...

975
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,230
Let me see.

976
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:53,110
It might be on the other side.

977
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:54,910
It might be on the other side.

978
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:55,930
You have to throw him.

979
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,430
Okay, I'll try.

980
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:01,490
So, we need the Masanda, but I think we have Masanda...

981
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:02,990
We have a male Masanda, yeah.

982
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:04,090
Yeah.

983
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,930
Okay, we only have male, then we need a female one.

984
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,270

Eat the cake.

1036
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,240
I don't think make babies.

1037
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,640
I don't think pressuring them.

1038
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,460
How long does it take them make babies?

1039
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:29,900
Oh my god I think maybe stop watching Stop watching them and
then maybe Sometimes like is that a requirement or a request

1040
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,660
really what you say?

1041
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:31,760
Really?

1042
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,040
Do we have something to my palladium fragments?

1043
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:34,560
Like the...

1044
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,200
The Crusher.

1045
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,440
The Crusher.

1046
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,480
Yeah, yeah, just...

1047
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:37,960
We don't.

1048
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,620
We should make one.

1049
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,040
Yeah, let me make one.

1050
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:40,720
Okay.

1051
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,900
Alright, I'm just gonna construct these.

1052
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:44,780
You get a spear second.

1053
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:45,580
Oh, yeah, wait a minute.

1054
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:51,700
For the Crusher, I wrote down this yesterday, but for the
Crusher, can we get that boss, the...

1055
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,300
What is his name?

1056
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,720
The little water noodle guy.

1057
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,360
One of the bosses.

1058
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,160
Yay!

1059
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,020

1061
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,500

1062
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,680
Can we put him out for the...

1063
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:05,560
for the crusher yeah i can do it which do you want to get
rid of let me know not the miners the miners are like

1064
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:14,000

1065
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,860
let's just let me know and then i can put the azure rope in
there i'm just gonna i'm gonna go power level a little bit i

1066
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:27,160
need because you guys i need to get to level two and level
32 and 3 for us you could also just start making some mega

1067
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:34,220
spheres We just need some fragments.

1068
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,800
We don't have enough wood for a crusher.

1069
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,460
That cost less material.

1070
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,060
Well, it's a good thing there's a bunch of trees around
there.

1071
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,060
Yeah, yeah, good thing!

1072
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,820
That's what the base is for!

1073
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,480
I can shut down some trees often.

1074
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:49,880
We gotta get to level 20!

1075
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,460
Where the fuck are the other pals around here?

1076
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,800
I need a power level.

1077
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,700
It says 33 for us.

1078
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,320
empty area I've ever seen.

1079
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,540
That was.

1080
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:07,940
Oh, there you are.

1081
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:08,940
I'm going to catch a frock.

1082
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:17,550
Is it enough?

1083
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,730
I can get a bunch of magus pears.

1084
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,230
I can probably get a power level pretty high.

1085
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,990
We need wood for magus pears.

1086
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:31,090
I'm going to have to put the elk back in here to make wood.

1087
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:33,990
We need...

1088
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:40,690
just need woods i mean not doing anything right now so i'm
just gonna swap her i mean just start cutting some trees

1089
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:54,670
right now by yourself on it and then make some mega spheres
for sure for all right because once i get to legendary

1090
01:02:54,670 --> 01:03:02,710
spheres all you need is legendary spheres only cost
palladium and iron i'm pretty sure you guys need more

1091
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:05,450
tombatts or They need carbon fiber.

1092
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:06,630
Toma's always good, right?

1093
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,030
I think we have an Anubis soon.

1094
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,790
Okay, so you don't need Tombat then.

1095
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:13,650
It looks like another two minutes until the first egg comes
out.

1096
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,010
Nice.

1097
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,510
And then, did we have...

1098
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:21,750
Did we have the right genders for making the Lyleen?

1099
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:22,210
I forgot.

1100
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,370
Yeah, we do.

1101
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,330
I got a Massandra.

1102
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:24,930
All right.

1103
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:25,890
I'm just...

1104
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:27,330
I will need the pet, whatever, then...

1105
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,270
Massandra's...

1106
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:31,870
The Sirfoomia give her the Patalia...

1107
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:32,030
Pretty soon.

1108
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:32,610
Or Lyleen?

1109
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,190
You probably got about five or six minutes.

1110
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:35,730
Augie.

1111
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:41,390
Get over here, Flock.

1112
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,830
Why are none of us lucky enough for Lucky Pals?

1113
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:45,990
I haven't found one yet.

1114
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,330
Yeah, well I'm never gonna find one.

1115
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,710
Keep that.

1116
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,810
Sure for why aren't you lucky?

1117
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,910
You know, my stats got rolled differently when I spawned.

1118
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,710
Then what did you get for your stats?

1119
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,390
I don't know, like...

1120
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:03,990
Like my hands?

1121
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,470
Your hands?

1122
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,190
All right.

1123
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:11,890
Okay.

1124
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:12,870
Ah.

1125
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,590
See you.

1126
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:15,630
We just need a couple more eggs.

1127
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,610
Deforestation sounds.

1128
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:22,830
Deforestation ASMR.

1129
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:24,050
Nice.

1130
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:26,330
I love deforestation in game.

1131
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,010
Deforestation ASMR.

1132
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:33,870
You said that was such like a nice ASMR voice though.

1133
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,390
I'm committed.

1134
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:39,550
I'm in the role now.

1135
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:41,890
Yeah, we're being immersed right now.

1136
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:43,090
I'm being immersed.

1137
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,850
Thank you very much My immersion.

1138
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,730
Stop trying to break our immersion.

1139
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:47,810
Oh my god.

1140
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:48,590
My immersion.

1141
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,190
Mom.

1142
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,790
Oh my god.

1143
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:56,710
You're embarrassing me, but I'm my friend Stop
Industrialization ASMR

1144
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,920
Hi, all right, all right crusher is made.

1145
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,340
Uh, do you want me to just make a bunch of palladium
fragments right now?

1146
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,080
Yeah, because that's what's holding back the bold right now.

1147
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,940
All right, I'm starting production.

1148
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,640
We're going to be wiped out of rock, but that's okay.

1149
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,680
Because I don't think we're really...

1150
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,140
I'm on my way to make more rock.

1151
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,640
All right, maybe the baby is born.

1152
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,380
The baby is born!

1153
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:33,540
Yes!

1154
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,340
Clip, clip, clip.

1155
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,060
Is it clipping time?

1156
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:35,700
The baby!

1157
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,140
It's a huge rocky egg.

1158
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,340
Is that what Anubis comes out of?

1159
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:39,640
I guess so.

1160
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,040
Oh, wait, no, no clip.

1161
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,240
Sorry, no clip then.

1162
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,960
I thought you meant the baby's hatched.

1163
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:45,800
No.

1164
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,960
No clip, guys.

1165
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:47,420
No clip.

1166
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:48,320
False alarm.

1167
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,120
I'm putting... False alarm.

1168
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,280
My water broke.

1169
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:51,680
Never mind.

1170
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,100
False alarm.

1171
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,820
I'm gonna leave them in there to make another Anubis,
though.

1172
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:55,280
Okay.

1173
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,020
Wait, just kidding.

1174
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,060
It takes 40 fucking minutes, but we're not doing that.

1175
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,380
Oh, no, not the dog.

1176
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,200
Alright, then I will need Pet... Pet... Pet...

1177
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,400
Pet... Pet... Petal...

1178
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:06,440
Okay.

1179
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,720
I'll let them make a second egg while I'm waiting for it.

1180
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:16,750
What's the lowest level Anubis you can catch?

1181
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:23,890
That wouldn't that shouldn't take 40 minutes if it's like a
quick, you know, like a yeah, yeah, yeah, right I hear you I

1182
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:30,970
put her in the box Thank you Do I have to be level 32 or 33
for the crafting thing that you need?

1183
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,110
uh 32 and 33.

1184

1188
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,470

1190
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:54,110
The box.

1191
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,610

I catch an extra person for the viewing thing.

1197
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:06,750
Thanks.

1198
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:08,910
Because we need a view, right?

1199
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,470
Do we know how many people we have already?

1200
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:15,650
Humans?

1201
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,990
Yeah, the humans, yeah.

1202
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:18,490
We can count them real quick.

1203
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:19,290
We can count them.

1204
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:20,850
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1205
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:21,930
Wait, start by element.

1206
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,150
Their element is nothing, so they'll show up at the top.

1207
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:26,630
I have 8.

1208
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:27,530
8 of them.

1209
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,250
Okay, I think I have, like, 5 right now.

1210
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:31,650
Because we need 20 in total.

1211
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:35,030
The viewing thing can be made from level 14, so it's not
hard.

1212
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,570
Yeah, I just want to make sure we have, like, enough for...

1213
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:40,810
Actually, I'll just build it.

1214
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,510
Enough for the viewing thing.

1215
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:44,810
Because we need 20, right?

1216
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:45,790
Yeah.

1217
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:48,550
Okay, sort.

1219
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:51,850
I have seven.

1220
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:53,650
You have eight, right?

1221
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:56,750
We should probably make it at the end because it'll fuck up
all of our base shit.

1222
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:57,690
All right.

1223
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:58,330
Yeah, I know.

1224
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,530
I'm just wondering how much we have.

1225
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:01,670
You need an azure orb, right?

1226
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:04,410

Yes.

1229
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:10,070
I wanted to use him on the base just because he's better at
water than I got azure obs in there.

1230
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:10,870
Okay.

1231
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:13,030

faster.

01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:52,070
We're all struggling together.

1359
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,850
We're trying to make as many spears as possible.

1360
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,150
We just need a shit ton of stone.

1361
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:04,730
Then a bunch of gigaspheres can start being made.

1362
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:05,650
Gigaspheres.

1363
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,550
I am bringing a bunch of spears.

1364
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:09,290
What's happening to all the stones?

1365
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,850
Wait, did you guys make some stuff just now?

1366
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:12,910
With stone?

1367
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:14,690
Someone must have.

1368
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,130
Yeah, because there's like five now.

1370
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,510

1372
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:21,570
Let's see.

1373
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:22,750
Let's hope this is a gris bowl.

1374
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:24,430
Let's hope it's a gris.

1375
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:25,530
Is it a gris bowl?

1376
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:27,530
It is a ray hound, which is fine.

1377
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,290

01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:33,490
Ray hound, gris bowl.

So the Verdash is like close by.

1426
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,540
I think I'm leveled up enough for Verdash.

1427
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:55,560
He's like level 34.

1428
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:57,400
For sure.

1429
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:00,200
Okay, it's this way.

1430
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:02,880

How many, how much honey do we need?

1435
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:19,230
Uh, I think actually for the amount of breeding we're gonna
do, we're actually probably gonna be okay on honey since it

1436
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:26,530
doesn't expire Okay, well We can use another bee though You
can use another bee or do you want don't we need don't we

think like priority right now is the cooking station because

1665
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:24,830
that's like two done yeah so you can come back but the
cooking station requires us to make like hold on the cooking

1666
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:33,270
station is like you have to get the circuit boards to make
the cook the electric kitchen you have to be level 41 and

1667
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:44,570
then you need to have uh refine ingot circuit boards well so
it's okay circuit boards is the main problem because you

1668
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:53,810
can't like pure quartz you have to kind of just like get
pure course okay i yeah and that's in the the the ice area

01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,060
well just like in your life it's so hard to find women

1686
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:11,900
ah am i in the area for this now no comment maybe that's
like most sandra tinder or something just just swipe a bit

1687
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:19,100
to find a female wait what are you gonna say sure for we
have a bunch of coal to make carbon fiber have we been

1688
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:23,220
making coal i think we i just dropped like a hundred we have
No?

1689
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,140
Do we need more?

1690
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:26,500
You drop charcoal.

1691
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:28,280
Oh charcoal, fuck.

1692
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,440
No, I've been- I've been making- I've been doing all
breeding.

1693
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:34,320
Um, I should fly out and just get that started though.

1694
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:35,680
Oh, we don't have coal at all?

1695
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:36,500
Oh shit.

1696
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:37,560
That's how we did.

1697
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,840
Once I make- Once I make this cake, I will go down there.

1698
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,880
And start making it.

1699
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,040
I'll go make the base for coal.

1700
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,340
I guess I don't care if I get hit.

1701
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,220
Uh, I need to make a tropical outfit.

1702
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,560
Oh shit.

1703
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:56,420
I've basically become a glorified pal.

1704
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,780
Because all you're doing is working.

1705
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:08,140
Because the pal's hour and a half, I'm just like, yeah, I'm
mining and chopping trees and working the pals for your

1706
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:08,500
bench.

1707
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,280
My favorite pal.

1708
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:10,880
Lily.

1709
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,740
That's my favorite pal.

1710
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:17,120
Don't worry, that's how some people are on other teams too.

1711
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,320
You're not the only one.

1712
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:25,440
Yeah, I'm pretty sure about four people in each team is
like, Well, one of them at least is banished to pile the

1713
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:25,580
wood.

1714
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,620
Alright, I'm gonna...

1715
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:32,860
Since we don't have the Mossandra, I'm gonna fly out and
start making the coal base.

1716
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,780
Yeah, yeah, just go make that.

1717
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,400
Finally!

1718
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:38,720
I'm just gonna keep trying to find a fucking Massandra.

1719
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,300
What a type of hands!

1720
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:44,620
Oh shit, Van Worm, you're fucking dying.

1721
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:46,580
Oh well.

1722
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,240
Van Worm...

1723
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,260
Better than Van Worm, they've got the...

1724
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:49,660
What is it called?

1725
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:50,180
The beacon?

1726
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:51,600
I'm level 34!

1727
01:35:52,620 --> 01:36:07,520
34 okay that sucks where the fuck are you oh i see are the
gorillas i'm gonna leave ignis here and take back this

1728
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:14,750
fucking panda and let me grab

1729
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:34,280
my worm there has to be a female somewhere all right uh you
should suggested the place by the anubis um let me just take

1730
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:44,840
a look at my thing no don't shoot him please oh the first
one is where I built my base but this I found one you're the

1731
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:51,560
anubis is the base one yes oh yeah you anyone the anubis is
technically in like a less dangerous location it's only got

1732
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:57,960
six nodes they said that there's a place in the deep sand
dunes that has eight nodes of coal but I first picture I

1733
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:03,160
linked is a place where there's a waypoint and you can fly
to the top left mountain and you don't even need to make a

1734
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:03,580
base.

1735
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:04,760
Oh, okay.

1736
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:05,220
Okay.

1737
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,560
That's convenient.

1738
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:07,600
All right.

1739
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,700
I'm just gonna try to get over there then.

1740
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:14,100
Because I don't have any waypoints out that way yet.

1741
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,760
Yeah, just just head there.

1742
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:23,360
Negative 125, negative 84, negative 125, 125, 84.

1743
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,020
Okay.

1744
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,160
All right, nice.

1745
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,280
Okay, I got the...

1746
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:32,800
Oh!

1747
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,460
All right, I got the female.

1748
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:38,020
I'm just gonna put it in base whenever you're ready to breed
it.

1749
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:38,620
I don't...

1750
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:39,860
I'm just gonna...

1751
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,400
Actually, I can breed it for us.

1752
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:42,860
Yeah, I'll do the breeding for us.

1753
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,280
Yeah, yeah, put it in the...

1754
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,320

01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,500
I'll put the wolf out.

1756
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:52,300
I did it.

1757
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:54,500

1758
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,520
Now I can...

1759
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,260
Okay, I got the wolf.

1760
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:58,460

01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:37,600
Okay.

1767
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:38,300

Alright, I gotta go...

1769
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,260
I gotta leave base for it and go make the other base.

1770
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,880
Alright, I'm just going to put...

1771
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,500

Actually, you can...

You can do the breeding right now since you're here.

1774
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,360
I'm here.

1775
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:53,700

What do we get rid of?

1778
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:00,340
You can get rid of...

1779
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:01,840
I'll just move this guy out for right now.

1780
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:02,980
There you go.

1781
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:03,520

you mean can't be assigned yes you what do you mean yes

1786
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:46,260
again sometimes the hitbox seems to creep over other shit
the what hitbox the the like when you try to assign the pal

1787
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:52,240
sometimes yeah seems to overlap with other shit oh that's
i'm just what the does that mean hold on wait a minute can't

1788
01:39:52,240 --> 01:40:00,680
be assigned that's weird with breeding where you have to
take out you have to like put two females in and to like

1789
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:04,940
make it unbug i don't know the bugs are annoying yeah that
sounds It's really annoying.

1790
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:07,980
It says it's not compatible with cooling.

1791
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,060
Wait, what?

1792
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:09,780
What?

1793
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,740
I don't, what the fuck does that mean?

1794
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:12,560
What?

1795
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:15,620
What does that mean?

1796
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,260
Are you- What the fuck does that mean?

1797
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:19,740
There's three misandras in front of me.

1798
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:22,020
I fucking- That's crazy.

1799
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:23,320
Okay.

1800
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:25,500
I literally found just found more misandras.

1801
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:34,220
Okay, I- Now it says nobody's at the breeding ground.

1802
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:42,540
okay just take them out and put it back in yeah i'm taking
them out and that should fix it i sign you to a tree i sign

1803
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:55,120
you to literally whatever just get out of there okay okay
wait more stone again go lily go lily pal just it keeps

1804
01:40:55,120 --> 01:41:01,460
saying i can't put the most the the panda in there because
of instability with cooling.

1805
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,500
Just try and put, like, two females in there.

1806
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:05,920
I'll put two.

1807
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:06,340
I'll try to.

1808
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,660
That one is a female, though.

1809
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:08,640
Just unbug it.

1810
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,820
Just unbug it and then see what happens.

1811
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:12,820
Yeah, the panda is a female, though.

1812
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:16,320
So it should be able to... Okay.

1813
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,200
If it saves that cooling, it usually means that they're on
break and they need to wander around for a bit.

1814
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,480
That's what some of my chat says.

1815
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,800
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1816
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:32,140
They're too mad to Yeah, they need a break.

1817
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:36,480
Can I like force them to sit in the olden?

1818
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:39,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1819
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:39,760
Whoa.

All of us supposed to be natural.

01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,500
Consent is sexy.

1822
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,020
I said to go on a spa date.

1823
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,720

When did we hire HR?

1831

1850
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
All right, it looks like it unbugs.

1851
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,660
Oh, hell yeah, they're in love.

1852
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,040
Whoops, wait, no, I'm not trying to cut you right now.

1853
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,480
Please let me Orion deal with the egg.

1854
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:56,300
Just kidding.

1855
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,200
I think I just put both of the...

1856
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,040
Wait, yes, hell yeah.

1857
01:43:59,060 --> 01:43:59,580
Yeah, all right, cool.

1858
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,080
They're making a baby.

1859
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,020
Oh, thank you.

1860
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:04,660
Okay.

1861
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:09,020
While they do that, I'm gonna go make the coal base.

1862
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:10,320
Whoa.

1863
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:15,110
Please.

1864
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:17,410
Please leave me alone.

1865
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:20,870
Oh, no.

1866
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:21,470
All right.

1867
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:22,810
Oh, no, I'm poisoned.

1868
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:26,570
I need some food for myself, and then I can go, can I make
another cake?

1869
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:30,350
I should know if I can kill this in time.

1870
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:32,190
We need egg.

1871
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:34,350
Oh, no, we didn't fucking what?

1872
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:36,790
We need so much stuff.

1873
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:38,070
It's never done!

1874
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:40,510
It's never over.

1875
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:43,170
Now I know what they feel like.

1876
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:48,270
Now you know why they have zero rights.

1877
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:50,550
Now you know.

1878
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:55,950
And they'll never get rights.

1879
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:57,510
This is terrible.

1880
01:44:58,150 --> 01:44:59,030
This is capitalism.

1881
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:00,290
Welcome to capitalism.

1882
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:02,650
Welcome to capitalism.

1883
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:04,830
Enjoy your state.

1884
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:06,270
Plus you have no other choice.

1885
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:07,550
I enjoyed my state.

1886
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:08,810
I enjoyed my time.

1887
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:11,890
Yeah, of course you did.

1888
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:16,130
Oh my god.

1889
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:18,850
I don't think I can kill the second tower, girl.

1890
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:21,090
She's way too strong.

1891
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:22,570
She wicked.

1892
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:25,070
My fucking pals are too fucking weak.

1893
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:30,310
She's like, oh no, she's too strong.

1894
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,930
Oh god, sweeper, please, sweep, sweep.

1895
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:34,670
She's like, oh no, she'll beat me up.

1896
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,630
Oh no, she's gonna beat me up.

1897
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:37,790
That's awful.

1898
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:38,430
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1899
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:43,190
I would hate to know where that tower is, where this girl's
beating you up.

1900
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:44,110
That would be...

1901
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:45,910
I just want to know so I can avoid it.

1902
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:47,590
That sounds terrible, you know?

1903
01:45:47,790 --> 01:45:48,750
Like, oh my goodness.

1904
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:51,650
Come on, sweeper.

1905
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:53,270
You're so tanky.

1906
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:55,150
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1907
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:58,310
I'm at 40,000 out of 70.

1908
01:45:59,230 --> 01:46:00,650
We're slowly getting there.

1909
01:46:02,850 --> 01:46:04,090
All right, cool, cool, cool.

1910
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:04,470
All right.

1911
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:08,350
I'm so close.

1912
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:10,850
Go, Pen King.

1913
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:13,430
You're our last hope.

1914
01:46:14,850 --> 01:46:15,430
Go, Pen King.

1915
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:18,450
Do we have the other, the Anubis yet?

1916
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:20,470
Uh, they're both hatching.

1917
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:22,230
They're still not hatched?

1918
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:23,990
No, they take 40 minutes each.

1919
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:26,010
Jesus Christ, they're so fucking tanky.

1920
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:27,670
I know, that's why I've been stuck at the base.

1921
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:28,570
I've just been doing breeding.

1922
01:46:28,710 --> 01:46:30,790
Wait, is the Anubis the longest one to breed?

1923
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:38,250
or is it a large axe or all the same hour at 45 we've got
one more minute left on the first noobus egg uh which is

It's okay.

2025
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:44,750

making, but it's not.

2031
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:57,570

Actually, I'll just fucking ride the dog.

2073
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:42,430

but that's what they did with children on farms that's true

2079
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:43,210
Into the mines, you gold.

2080
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:47,330
Soon as soon as you're 12, you're going to be working on the
farm.

2081
01:58:51,410 --> 01:58:52,730
As God intended.

2082
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:54,850
Perfect for the mines.

2083
01:58:55,830 --> 01:58:55,970
Alright.

2084
01:58:56,590 --> 01:59:01,150
Look, if God didn't want them to work in the mines, then
kids should not exist.

2085
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:04,630
You sure?

2086
01:59:07,050 --> 01:59:08,970
I'm 100% sure.

2087
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:11,090
Oh, I think I went past where I was supposed to go.

2088
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:11,650
Wait, no, I didn't.

2089
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:15,890
Yes, and my parents should have put me in the mines.

2090
01:59:16,770 --> 01:59:19,230
Born to roam free, forced to mine.

2091
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:24,530
You're seeing it as if it's a bad thing.

2092
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:28,950
Also, if we have the eggs, we also need to make one more
cake.

2093
01:59:29,490 --> 01:59:32,550
If anybody's on base and can make a cake.

2094
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:35,630
I can probably queue one up if we have.

2095
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:39,530
Yeah, I'm just...

2096
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:40,690
Wait, we have a...

2097
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:41,830
Okay, there's a...

2098
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:43,290
Oh, I'm going to relax the stories.

2099
01:59:43,410 --> 01:59:43,950
You guys can catch it.

2100
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:44,450
Relax the stories.

2101
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:45,070
Catch some.

2102
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:48,350
Catch some because then if we don't have the right gender,
it won't matter.

2103
01:59:48,990 --> 01:59:49,350
Yeah, yeah.

2104
01:59:49,690 --> 01:59:50,090

2109
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:56,870
It's time, Lily.

2110
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:57,390
I kept the balls in order.

2111
01:59:59,270 --> 02:00:00,270
I kept the balls away.

2112
02:00:00,650 --> 02:00:01,790
There's more balls in the base.

2113
02:00:01,970 --> 02:00:03,590
There's more balls in the base.

2114
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:04,270
I'm dead.

2115
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:05,410
Wait, you're dead?

2116
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:07,130
I can't do it.

2117
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:08,430

2118
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:11,010

Okay, you really do sound like the voice from the game
though.

2138
02:01:20,590 --> 02:01:21,470
You can fess up.

2139
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:23,910
You can just tell me that you're the guy from...

2140

2141

2145
02:01:31,190 --> 02:01:32,590
I don't know how that fucking works.

2146
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:35,430
Don't I have to join like some voice actors guild or some
shit?

2147
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:37,010
No, I don't think so.

02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:37,770
I think...

2149
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:38,750

If you never try, if you never try, you'll never get
employed.

2156
02:01:54,610 --> 02:01:55,450
I don't want to try.

2157
02:01:55,830 --> 02:01:56,310
Why not?

2158
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:58,430
I just want everything to be given to me.

2159
02:01:58,530 --> 02:01:59,350

2160
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:03,010

02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:24,170
Trevor, are you high enough level for the...

2184
02:03:24,170 --> 02:03:24,290
Oh, wait.

2185
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:25,550
You might be at my dead stuff.

2186
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:26,010
For the...

2187
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:27,190
You are, that's my dead stuff.

2188
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:28,050
Can you pick it up?

2189
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:31,250
Oh, you're in my guild, so yeah, probably.

2190
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:33,630
I don't know if there's anything useful in there.

2191
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:36,030
I've recovered ever since, but you can...

2192
02:03:36,030 --> 02:03:36,770
I need better balls as a thing.

2193
02:03:37,290 --> 02:03:39,250
I'm trying to look for a waypoint.

2194
02:03:40,290 --> 02:03:42,230
A dive of, like, pretty much nothing.

2195
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:43,670
What do we need for hyperspeers?

2196
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:44,310
Do you guys know?

2197
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:45,350
Oh, yeah, I took it all.

2198
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:47,870
Trevor, what mats do you need for hyperspeers?

2199
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:50,670
Let me see.

2200
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:53,430
I'm looking for...

2201
02:03:53,430 --> 02:03:53,790
Cement.

2202
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:55,590
How do I make cement?

2203
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:58,850
Six coal, one stone.

2204
02:03:59,230 --> 02:03:59,930
Six coal, one ore.

2205
02:04:00,130 --> 02:04:00,610
Okay, okay.

2206
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:04,550
What mats do we need for Hyper Spear Share for?

2207
02:04:06,910 --> 02:04:09,510
I got it covered, but I can't queue a mob.

2208
02:04:09,970 --> 02:04:12,050
I will just make sure we have the materials.

2209
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:13,990
There's no fast travel over here.

2210
02:04:14,090 --> 02:04:14,510
Wait, what?

2211
02:04:16,450 --> 02:04:18,430
Also, your mods said they made a list.

2212
02:04:18,450 --> 02:04:19,450
but where is it?

2213
02:04:21,810 --> 02:04:22,170
Uh...

2214
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:24,190
There's no list in here.

2215
02:04:24,430 --> 02:04:25,390
I can just copy paste it.

2216
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:25,870
Hold on.

2217
02:04:26,090 --> 02:04:27,990
I think they didn't even post it.

2218
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:28,870
No, I think they...

2219
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:29,550
Wait, here.

2220
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:30,130
There you go.

2221
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,810
I think they posted it in the wrong chat.

2222
02:04:33,150 --> 02:04:33,490
There you go.

2223
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:34,330
Okay.

2224
02:04:34,830 --> 02:04:35,050
All right.

2225
02:04:35,230 --> 02:04:36,010
I need...

2226
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:36,510
Chill it.

2227
02:04:36,570 --> 02:04:37,770
Do we not do chill it?

2228
02:04:37,870 --> 02:04:38,810
Or did we do chill it?

2229
02:04:39,190 --> 02:04:39,970
Oh, those are the ones we did.

2230
02:04:39,970 --> 02:04:41,910
Can you give me a list of those we need to do?

2231
02:04:42,070 --> 02:04:43,130
Because that's easier for me.

2232
02:04:43,150 --> 02:04:44,050
Oh, what we need to do.

2233
02:04:44,150 --> 02:04:45,850
For day one, bosses.

2234
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:47,790
Because that's easier for me to keep track.

2235
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:56,350
um i'm gonna capture two black marketeers through us now

2239
02:05:20,470 --> 02:05:21,070
We need coal.

2240
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:22,170
We still need coal.

2241
02:05:23,150 --> 02:05:25,090
I'm about to mine so I'm gonna circle.

2242
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:30,150
I'm gonna put away...

2243
02:05:30,150 --> 02:05:31,950
Okay, back to stone.

2244
02:05:32,850 --> 02:05:33,170
Nice.

2245
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:34,570
I've used up all the stone.

2246
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:36,790
Black marketeers are tough.

2247
02:05:37,190 --> 02:05:39,630
Well, I have to do it for the team.

2248
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:42,230
Bad worm.

2249
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:48,970
No, I'm starving.

2250
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:52,010
I don't know, whoever told me it's easier to manually mine.

2251
02:05:52,030 --> 02:06:01,130
of anubis i feel like you're you're i feel like my bore was
more effective maybe you're not doing it right get all of

2252
02:06:01,130 --> 02:06:11,610
these stones okay hold up wait let me put him into the base
because i feel like he's more useful in here to do the stone

2253
02:06:11,610 --> 02:06:24,590
mining in here for now while i'll get my manual stone wait
that's not that's not cool Um, they don't need this, so I'm

2254
02:06:24,590 --> 02:06:25,150
gonna eat it.

2255
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:29,690
Oh, no, stop being hungry.

2256
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:30,830
Isn't he a low level?

2257
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:32,510
That shouldn't matter for mining.

2258
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:34,890
It's not fighting a pal.

2259
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:35,810
It's just mining.

2260
02:06:37,330 --> 02:06:37,850
Uh...

2261
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:39,830
God, I'm a boar.

2262
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:42,730
Where is one of the black marketeers?

2263
02:06:44,350 --> 02:06:45,210
Let's see.

2264
02:06:47,710 --> 02:06:48,230
141...

2265
02:06:49,970 --> 02:06:51,010
41-404?

2266
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:53,210
It's supposed to be right here.

2267
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:53,790
Hold on.

2268
02:06:54,010 --> 02:06:56,490
I'm trying to like figure out where the black marketeers
are.

2269
02:06:57,830 --> 02:06:59,470
There's one right below our base.

2270
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:01,650
Yeah, I'm trying to...

2271
02:07:01,650 --> 02:07:03,150
Oh, it's this thing right here.

2272
02:07:03,230 --> 02:07:04,050
It's this thing right here.

2273
02:07:04,170 --> 02:07:04,410
Okay.

2274
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:05,190
I got it.

2275
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:06,110
Okay.

2276
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:07,110
I see it.

2277
02:07:07,110 --> 02:07:07,850
I found the spot.

2278
02:07:08,690 --> 02:07:09,310
Is this it?

2279
02:07:12,370 --> 02:07:14,270
Is this the marker for that?

2280
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:15,950
I think so.

2281
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:17,390
All right, I'm gonna see if I can catch him.

2282
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:19,350
Oh!

2283
02:07:20,270 --> 02:07:21,310

2287
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:56,620
Coal can't be assigned.

2288
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:56,960
What?

2289
02:08:02,910 --> 02:08:03,930
I need some wood.

2290
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:07,490
I need hyperspeers to catch the marketeers.

2291
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:10,210
Does the gigaspere not work?

2292
02:08:11,110 --> 02:08:12,070
I'm getting somewhere.

2293
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:14,190
It might just be a really, really, really, really low
chance.

2294
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:16,950
You know, I'm going to risk it.

2295
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:19,150
I'm going to risk it.

2296
02:08:19,390 --> 02:08:20,090
It'll be fine.

2297
02:08:22,350 --> 02:08:27,590
I have enough gigaspers to fucking risk the catch.

2298
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,180
Wait, what the fuck?

2299
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:33,940
I have a grenade?

2300
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:36,320
Throwing Garnata.

2301
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:37,060
Nice.

2302
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:39,580
I tried to go to punch and then a grenade came out.

2303
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:40,140
And I was like, ugh.

2304
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:43,800
Alright, back to you.

2305
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,100
Oh god, I'm so stupid.

2306
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:47,020
Oh wait, cause it's not my axe.

2307
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:48,340
It's Lily's axe.

2308
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:49,940
That's where this axe came from.

2309
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:51,140
Hello.

2310
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:53,100
Oh yeah, you got her stuff?

2311
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:54,140
Thanks for the axe.

2312
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:55,080
Yeah, I got your stuff.

2313
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:55,840
You're welcome, you're welcome.

2314
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:58,840
Alright, here we go.

2315
02:08:59,060 --> 02:09:00,560
It's time to risk this.

2316
02:09:02,060 --> 02:09:03,840
We'll be fine

2317
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:12,170
All right, Cole I put a pal box out here now.

2318
02:09:12,290 --> 02:09:13,510
We've got a fast travel.

2319
02:09:13,650 --> 02:09:14,170
What the fuck?

2320
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:16,910
Okay Go to your thing.

2321
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:19,170
I was told we need wood.

2322
02:09:19,470 --> 02:09:19,970
I'll get wood.

2323
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:25,050
Oh, he has a pal too Yeah, and a machine gun.

2324
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:26,950
Oh my god, my pal's almost dead.

2325
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:27,710
All right.

2326
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:30,830
I stopped risking it You know, sure for this is your job.

2327
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:35,190
I'm not doing this Shit.

2328
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:37,330
This one too.

2329
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:38,310
Alright.

2330
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:41,510
He is way too strong.

2331
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:44,430
Who's good at mining that I've got in my party right now?

2332
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:46,930
Wait, can they not mine the coal?

2333
02:09:48,530 --> 02:09:49,830
I can come mine the coal.

2334
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:50,430
They should be able to.

2335
02:09:50,770 --> 02:09:52,590
I put Tombat out here, but Tombat's not doing anything.

2336
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:55,730
I need more nails for the large power bed.

2337
02:09:57,110 --> 02:09:57,790
Do we need more nails?

2338
02:09:57,950 --> 02:09:58,190
Okay.

2339
02:09:58,730 --> 02:10:00,710
We need more for that, right?

2340
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:05,610
Just iron.

2341
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:08,030
I know we need ingots.

2342
02:10:08,570 --> 02:10:08,910
Ingots, okay.

2343
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:10,650
You can queue up some ingots.

2344
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:13,950
I held off because I wasn't sure how much we need for like
the refined.

2345
02:10:13,950 --> 02:10:15,790
They can mine coal, but you have to take away the mining
station.

2346
02:10:16,650 --> 02:10:16,770
What?

2347
02:10:16,970 --> 02:10:18,770
No, you need level three for coal.

2348
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:20,770
You need level three pals.

2349
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:21,490
Mining.

2350
02:10:21,970 --> 02:10:22,950
That's what they said.

2351
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:23,830
Okay, okay.

2352
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:26,890
Who can we get that's level three?

2353
02:10:27,530 --> 02:10:28,590
I'll just... Is Anubis?

2354
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:31,850
Anubis is, but I want to try something.

2355
02:10:32,070 --> 02:10:35,190
Okay, I'm gonna need one of the Anubis This is here to start
getting cold.

2356
02:10:35,470 --> 02:10:35,770

this inferior Leah with this superior Lily.

2483
02:19:40,330 --> 02:19:42,530
Oh, my God, we can finally replace her.

2484
02:19:45,270 --> 02:19:47,430
You, your position has become redundant.

2485
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:51,230
Now it doesn't matter if you get sick.

2486
02:19:52,110 --> 02:19:53,190
You have become useless.

2487
02:19:53,610 --> 02:19:54,250
No worth.

2488
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:55,210
No worth.

2489
02:19:55,210 --> 02:19:55,990
For your services.

2490
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:56,650
Thank you.

2491
02:19:58,810 --> 02:20:00,530
You don't get a pension after.

2492
02:20:01,430 --> 02:20:02,050
Rest in peace.

2493
02:20:02,610 --> 02:20:05,270
We need milk and egg, but it doesn't really fucking matter,
so it's all good.

2494
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:07,410
All right, next thing we need to breed.

2495
02:20:09,070 --> 02:20:11,610
First off, why have you just been in here doing nothing?

2496
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:16,170
We have enough time to breed the rest, or...

2497
02:20:16,170 --> 02:20:17,110
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

2498
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:17,750
We're gonna be good.

2499
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:21,030
Because we still have to do the other stuff, so...

2500
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:21,650
I'm just a little worried.

2501
02:20:21,670 --> 02:20:22,230
Yeah, no, we're gonna be good.

2502
02:20:22,570 --> 02:20:27,630
The last thing we need to breed is pretty much once his
Grisbolt is done in four minutes.

2503
02:20:28,450 --> 02:20:31,530
If we have the correct sex, then I can immediately breed the
last one.

2504
02:20:31,710 --> 02:20:32,590
If we don't...

2505
02:20:32,610 --> 02:20:35,390
Then I'm gonna need somebody to get another relaxesaurus.

2506
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:36,670
I have.

2507
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:37,430
I'll show you.

2508
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:39,090
I'll see what relaxesaurus I have.

2509
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:42,710
Um, but I'm gonna maybe go try to get pure crystals, maybe.

2510
02:20:43,210 --> 02:20:47,090
Um, I have a male relaxesaurus right now on me.

2511
02:20:47,290 --> 02:20:48,350
Maybe you guys need a male.

2512
02:20:48,370 --> 02:20:48,870
This is a female.

2513
02:20:50,050 --> 02:20:50,590
Otherwise...

2514
02:20:50,590 --> 02:20:51,290
Let's see.

2515
02:20:51,810 --> 02:20:53,980
I need to fucking replace some of my pals in here.

2516
02:20:54,990 --> 02:20:56,990
Uh, Univore, Lunaris.

2517
02:20:57,670 --> 02:20:59,150
I do not need.

2518
02:20:59,750 --> 02:21:00,990
I need 40 nails.

2519
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:02,030
Nice.

2520
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:02,970
Don't do it.

2521
02:21:03,450 --> 02:21:04,370
Don't do it.

2522
02:21:04,490 --> 02:21:05,010
Let me see where they're at.

2523
02:21:05,170 --> 02:21:06,270
We're at 26 nails.

2524
02:21:06,550 --> 02:21:06,770
I'll help.

2525
02:21:08,470 --> 02:21:10,850
I think I can do another...

2526
02:21:10,850 --> 02:21:12,530
I can do a...

2527
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:12,930
I can do a...

2528
02:21:12,930 --> 02:21:13,950
I killed a Mammarist, right?

2529
02:21:14,190 --> 02:21:15,190
Yeah, I can.

2530
02:21:15,650 --> 02:21:16,330
Let's see.

2531
02:21:16,390 --> 02:21:17,430
Where is the Mammarist?

2532
02:21:17,470 --> 02:21:19,630
Is the Mammarist the one in the beginning?

2533
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:20,650
Yeah.

2534
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:21,330
Okay.

2535
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:22,930
Well, let's see if I can kill it.

2536
02:21:23,550 --> 02:21:24,870
Let's see if I can kill this.

2537
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:28,090
If you need help, good luck.

2538
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:29,790
Thank you.

2539
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:30,970
I really appreciate it.

2540
02:21:30,990 --> 02:21:37,310
appreciate that if you need to help no one can good luck
yeah no one can help you but if you need on your own goodbye

2541
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:48,730
all right let's see go van worm go hey it's all right all
right nails are done okay put him in the box it's fine uh

2542
02:21:48,730 --> 02:21:59,170
apparently it's not are they in a box i'm about to put in my
box yeah okay i the box was full okay they're in the box now

2543
02:22:01,070 --> 02:22:02,550
I just gotta put this somewhere.

2544
02:22:04,330 --> 02:22:04,810
Oop.

2545
02:22:07,170 --> 02:22:08,810
Oh, this boss is easy.

2546
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:10,970
I'm so fucking tanky now.

2547
02:22:11,090 --> 02:22:12,650
Or my pals are tanky.

2548
02:22:14,290 --> 02:22:15,030
Go, pal.

2549
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:15,230
Go.

2550
02:22:15,510 --> 02:22:15,810
Oh.

2551
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:18,770
I'm so good at Dark Souls now.

2552
02:22:19,650 --> 02:22:20,770
I'm so good at Dark Souls.

2553
02:22:21,450 --> 02:22:22,630
Two minutes on that one.

2554
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:24,550
Alright, we need to make circuit boards.

2555
02:22:24,790 --> 02:22:27,450
So I'm just gonna go get some pure quartz.

2556
02:22:27,730 --> 02:22:27,950
Yeah.

2557
02:22:28,330 --> 02:22:30,970
Chat, do you know if there's like any particularly rare?

2558
02:22:30,990 --> 02:22:39,370
really good spot for pure quartz or is it literally just
wander around the mountain i know there's that lake the

2559
02:22:39,370 --> 02:22:49,850
unthawable lake has a lot of them uh all right i'll head to
the lake we'll see please please you need well why are you

2560
02:22:49,850 --> 02:23:05,870
so weak okay uh and then we okay two pal beds i'll help i'll
help build be alone me alone oh my god please you built two

2561
02:23:05,870 --> 02:23:17,100
of them right yeah sure did you did you build two of these
pal beds yeah okay cool you can upgrade it now other one

2562
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:25,460
it's like to the right of it okay or the left of it you
should be able to level up the base now right yeah yeah once

2563
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:33,580
these two are built we'll be able to level up the base what
level is our base now uh it's gonna be 16 or 17 the next one

2564
02:23:33,580 --> 02:23:39,240
pretty much all comes together by finishing the electric
furnace once the electric furnace is done uh we're gonna

2565
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:45,760
we're pretty much gonna skip level three level 17 and 18 and
we're just gonna do the build for 19 because the build for

2566
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:51,580
19 will speed up how long it'll take for us to 17 and 18 i
like did the math last night and it's just better to just do

2567
02:23:51,580 --> 02:24:03,460
the 19 base uh objective first all right come on all right
base upgrade done all right refined metal chest Nice.

2568
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:05,620
Come on, Mammarous.

2569
02:24:05,620 --> 02:24:06,360
All right, let me check.

2570
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:07,460
Refined metal chest.

2571
02:24:08,980 --> 02:24:10,220
Refined metal chest.

2572
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:15,260
Okay, we need a refined ingot nail wood.

2573
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:17,900
Okay, can you build us the refined metal chest?

2574
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:20,720
What level is it?

2575
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:24,420
It is level 39.

2576
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:25,940
Yeah.

2577
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:26,780
Okay.

2578
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:28,080
That should be fine.

2579
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:32,660
The next thing we're going to need, we're going to need a
bunch of circuit boards.

2580
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:40,640
refined ingot so I'm gonna go I'm gonna get the grisbolt
situation figured out first but then I'm gonna go try to

2581
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:51,100
farm the quartz I'm just trying to catch my mammal why is it
5% holy

2582
02:24:54,580 --> 02:25:03,900
shit this mammal rest is taking fucking forever well it's
not a mammar active it's a mammarast that's why it takes so

2583
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:08,040
long Jesus Christ I'm still left.

2584
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:08,740
Oh my god.

2585
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:13,880
I think I definitely need a hypersphere some shit How where
the mats for hypersphere?

2586
02:25:14,480 --> 02:25:16,340
I have we have all the mats.

2587
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:17,680
I just can't kill them.

2588
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:18,200
Oh, okay.

2589
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:21,180
Circuit ports have filled the sphere assembly line.

2590
02:25:21,740 --> 02:25:21,920
Oh, okay.

2591
02:25:22,540 --> 02:25:23,860
So Mamma rest is caught.

2592
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:25,520
Clip clip clip clip.

2593
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:26,180
I got it.

2594
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:27,660
Clip clip clip clip.

2595
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:29,520
I feed your pal.

2596
02:25:29,740 --> 02:25:30,240
Oh my god.

2597
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:33,440
Never mind Clip clip clip clip clip.

2598
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:34,880
All right, cool.

2599
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:41,440
No I'm going to try and find dungeons for us now because we
production assembly line.

2600
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:44,800
We need to do dungeons at the two hour mark and we're at the
two hour mark.

2601
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:46,780
So I'm going to try to find the dungeons and you guys do
your thing.

2602
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:50,580
All our eggs are incubated.

2603
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:51,420
I'm going to hatch them.

2604
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:55,720
We can make a third base, by the way, so we can teleport
everybody to the dungeons.

2605
02:25:56,060 --> 02:25:56,720
We got Grisbolt.

2606
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:58,560
Do we need a Grisbolt?

2607
02:25:58,800 --> 02:25:59,040
Let's go!

2608
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:01,940
The Grisbolt and we got, I'm hatching the scorching one.

2609
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:03,440
What is the gender of the Grisbolt?

2610
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:05,140
I'm going to check now.

2611
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:09,120
Grisbolt is Female.

2612
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:11,240
And we have a male Relaxasaurus.

2613
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:12,320
Let's go!

2614
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:13,180
Who do we get?

2615
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:14,600
Who are we replacing?

2616
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,200
Can you take out the ones I'm replacing?

2617
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:17,840
They're all sleeping, so it doesn't matter.

2618
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:19,920
Yeah, but I'll just take out.

2619
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:20,680
I'll take this guy out.

2620
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:22,100
Okay, Relaxasaurus is here.

2621
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:24,360
Alright, here we go.

2622
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:24,780
Alright, cool.

2623
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:26,920
No, no, don't sleep.

2624
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:28,000
No.

2625
02:26:28,980 --> 02:26:29,340
No.

2626
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:31,440
Get up.

2627
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:34,240
Okay, I just got to wait till they land.

2628
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:35,100
I can't put them in there.

2629
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:43,980
I'm trying to look at what the dungeons are caverns of doom
dungeon okay i know you put that for dungeons caverns of

2630
02:26:43,980 --> 02:26:52,480
dune okay it's in the desert okay it's level it's level 38
dungeon which is fine sure 4 and i are high enough level hey

2631
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:59,540
all right breeding is gonna be fine we're we're good nice
yeah i just need to get the circuit board so i can make the

2632
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:06,380
spheres so i can get the hyperspheres so then i can oh yeah
start catching the bosses i'm gonna get the materials for a

2633
02:27:06,380 --> 02:27:13,360
basis so you guys can teleport to me to do the dungeon okay
sounds good okay we have i can make then you can also start

2634
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:24,340
teleporting us to those islands so yeah yeah so how much
refined ingot do we need i have 87 and i can make 330 it'll

2635
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:35,840
be a hundred it'll be a hundred refined ingots to make the
uh sphere assembly line And then for the balls, it's...

2636
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:38,480
So I'll just max it out so you can queue up all the balls,
maybe.

2637
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:39,400
Five per ball.

2638
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:40,360
Okay.

2639
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,820
We just queue up all the units.

2640
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:46,480
The major problem with the production assembly line is just
circuit boards.

2641
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:50,640
It's probably better if...

2642
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:51,600
Can I make polymer yet?

2643
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:55,020
I make pal metal ingots, and then I make legendary spheres.

2644
02:27:55,380 --> 02:27:57,180
I just need cement and carbon fiber.

2645
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:58,580
All right.

2646
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:01,420
We also need to make polymers.

2647
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:09,040
i'm not level 33 so i need to get up a couple levels before
i can do that so if we can make a bunch of cement that would

2648
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:18,980
be i can we have any i can make like a lot more 200 more am
i in the right area if i can just make legendary spheres

2649
02:28:18,980 --> 02:28:27,860
then it'll be way easier to catch the i'm gonna start
reading to make a rock all right you guys do that i'm just

2650
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:39,660
gonna find us that fucking dungeon where the heck let's take
him down wait no not you we have no more anubis in the base

2651
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:47,000
wait we have one anubis we should have I took one of the
anubis just to start making some I'm gonna put them back

2652
02:28:47,000 --> 02:29:03,100
okay yeah no it is this guy and Griswold okay last breed oh
where the fuck is a dungeon okay I am looking at and then

2653
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:10,640
grab back to rock trying to find the dungeon spawns on the
on the little guide you made

2654
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:21,940
i hope it was helpful i i like got really uh like i started
looking into all the stuff i needed for breeding and then it

2655
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:32,140
just led me down a rabbit hole of all the other things i
needed no that's not it oh the dungeons right breeding time

2656
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:45,380
breed breed breed wrong mouth it's so hard there they go
there they go fall in love I'll leave you to it good luck

2657
02:29:45,380 --> 02:29:54,700
just fall in love it's that easy just do it good luck with
the fertilization you're like all you need is a cake and

2658
02:29:54,700 --> 02:30:04,960
then they'll fall in love that's all no no it's not falling
down Well, I hope it's not exhibitionism because I don't

2659
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:05,500
want to stand up.

2660
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:07,780
Okay, at the one hour mark, we start petting.

2661
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:10,380
Yes, yeah, we start...

2662
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:10,600
Okay.

2663
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:12,260
We start petting together.

2664
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:14,660
I don't know why that makes me laugh every time you say it.

2665
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:15,380
I'm just like, okay.

2666
02:30:15,860 --> 02:30:17,420
We just do group petting.

2667
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:18,860
What's so funny about that?

2668
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:19,900
Yeah, what's so funny?

2669
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,160
This is a serious thing.

2670
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:22,560
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

2671
02:30:22,660 --> 02:30:22,900
You're right.

2672
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:23,640
Sorry.

2673
02:30:24,220 --> 02:30:25,520
I had the giggles, my bad.

2674
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:26,660
Oh my god.

2675
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,840
How dare you laugh about petting?

2676
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:29,920
Right.

We'll never know.

2700
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:52,180
That's role play.

2701
02:31:55,100 --> 02:31:56,060
Is it, though?

2702
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:57,320
Is it really RP?

2703
02:31:57,720 --> 02:31:58,400
Okay, I'm flying.

2704
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:00,160
I'm out when I have a little pony.

2705
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:01,120
Do I need to wait for anything?

2706
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:02,160
Yeah, I'm going to wait for the egg.

2707
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:03,980

2713
02:32:33,400 --> 02:32:35,720
I mean, we don't have the kitchen yet, so there's no kitchen
yet.

2714
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:39,060
Wait, you're a high enough level to do it now.

2715
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:40,100
We just don't have the materials.

2716
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:41,500
We just don't have the circuit boards.

2717
02:32:42,220 --> 02:32:42,440
Nah.

2718
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:43,000
All right.

2719
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:44,600
Yeah, I gotta fly out of here then.

2720
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:47,440
I'm just trying to find the dungeon.

2721
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:49,720
Guys, am I going the right way?

2722
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:58,140
Guys, we're trying to find the cavern of the Dune dungeon.

2723
02:32:58,460 --> 02:32:59,440
I don't know.

2724
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:08,120
Excuse me, sir, do you know where the cavern of the Dune
dungeon is?

2725
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:10,100
There's no holes anywhere!

2726
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:17,200
Where the fuck are the holes?

2727
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:23,580
I'm over-encumbered.

2728
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:29,820
Oh, also, uh, Lily, this applies to you and me.

2729
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:35,720
Make sure that you have at least 40 pals registered in your
decks today because there's a big difference between 30 and

2730
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:36,220
40.

2731
02:33:36,320 --> 02:33:38,860
You get, like, 20 points versus 50 points.

2732
02:33:39,080 --> 02:33:39,940
I have 22.

2733
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:41,880
We can probably just drop them to each other.

2734
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:43,200
No, no, you have to catch them.

2735
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:43,820
You've got to catch them.

2736
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:44,620
I have to catch them.

2737
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:46,400
Wait, open up this egg, then.

2738
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:47,760
Hatch this egg.

2739
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:49,760
Whatever this common egg is.

2740
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:51,640
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2741
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:52,420

2742
02:33:52,980 --> 02:33:54,020
I think I did it.

2743
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:55,000
All right, let's go.

2744
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:56,660
Okay, I don't know if this is the right one.

2745
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:58,180
Oh, my God.

2746
02:33:58,520 --> 02:33:59,600

So, all of the breeding stuff, I can just hide.

2786
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:38,130
I don't need this anymore.

2787
02:36:41,150 --> 02:36:44,170
Oh, we can still make a dire howl, but I was kind of like...

2788
02:36:44,170 --> 02:36:45,290
Wait, did you clip the...

2789
02:36:45,290 --> 02:36:46,490

We're waiting for it to hatch.

2791
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:47,910
Okay.

2792
02:36:48,870 --> 02:36:52,230
Um, but the dire howl, is it like worth doing?

2793
02:36:52,290 --> 02:36:52,470
No.

2794
02:36:52,470 --> 02:36:53,050
I feel like it isn't.

2795
02:36:53,130 --> 02:36:55,390
You have to get the three passive moves.

2796
02:36:55,390 --> 02:36:56,470
We have the right things.

2797
02:36:57,330 --> 02:37:02,570

Not like this.

2823
02:38:49,230 --> 02:38:51,570
I'm ready to go to the boss.

Yay.

2843
02:39:27,130 --> 02:39:29,090
It was intentional by design.

2844
02:39:29,350 --> 02:39:32,130
Alright, I'm at the, I'm back at the base whenever
everyone's ready.

02:44:01,820 --> 02:44:02,420

That'd be super helpful.

2953
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:05,380
I'm going to make...

2954
02:44:05,380 --> 02:44:07,760
I want to make the...

2955
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:09,280
Actually, we can do the photos later then.

2956
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:10,360
I'll just find the other dungeon.

2957
02:44:12,740 --> 02:44:14,200
Oh, do I have any food on me?

2958
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:14,800
No.

2959
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:18,320
Is there any food at base or no?

2960
02:44:20,140 --> 02:44:22,180
Check the PAL food thing.

2961
02:44:22,580 --> 02:44:26,880
There should be at least some honey and some other stuff
because I'm done with the cakes.

2962
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:27,900
I don't need to make any more cakes.

2963
02:44:29,180 --> 02:44:30,980
Okay, I'll eat the honey then.

2964
02:44:33,320 --> 02:44:34,540
Yeah, we're not breeding anything.

2965
02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:36,500
Sounds like, what is it with flesh tubers and quartz?

2966
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:41,440
I mean, if you can avoid eating the honey, that's probably
the harder one for us to...

2967
02:44:41,440 --> 02:44:42,480
Okay, I'll get the egg.

2968
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:44,880
Okay, I'll get the milk then.

2969
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:46,840
I...

2970
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:48,640
Okay, because my pals need milk.

2971
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:49,320
Need milk?

2972
02:44:50,260 --> 02:44:56,120
Yeah, if we want to actually just fill the ranch with, like,
chickens, we can just have a buck ton of eggs.

2973
02:44:56,860 --> 02:44:59,160
Or fill it with the cows, and then we can have...

2974
02:44:59,180 --> 02:45:06,520
milk we need a production assembly line let's see what do i
need dude i'm gonna find the other i'm finding i'm gonna go

2975
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:20,400
find the other dungeon okay uh volcanic cavern dungeon
that's a level 40 that is all the way down here on the edge

2976
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:31,360
but where is the where the how the fuck do i get there sure
are you okay with like destroying the base later when i find

2977
02:45:31,360 --> 02:45:39,720
the dungeon uh yeah i mean just let them farm some quartz
real fast okay as long as soon as you have the base just let

2978
02:45:39,720 --> 02:45:49,600
me know and then i'll get the quartz like this way okay
taking like 10 minutes max all right here i'll go i'm

2979
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:56,440
heading over to the volcanic dungeon oh hey there's some
chicken i can kill for food oh yeah we need to take that

2980
02:45:56,440 --> 02:46:06,520
photo in the in the crater too i don't know where how to
find that what's this uh there's like a there's a lift monk

2981
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:11,340
statue in the middle of the crater i guess and we have to
take a photo with it but we need we all need that advanced

2982
02:46:11,340 --> 02:46:18,340
armor and i just don't think it's worth it so i mean you you
can live if it's like one second you'll be fine right yeah

2983
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:30,040
we can like whatever yeah like you just need photo yeah just

2985
02:46:37,400 --> 02:46:50,480

do you need sure for to get the hard bosses i need the i

2987
02:47:03,090 --> 02:47:09,390

stopping you right now and it's just a quartz right the

2988
02:47:09,390 --> 02:47:15,210
course that's stopping you from making those balls because i
need the circuit boards but i got yeah we need to make the

2989
02:47:15,210 --> 02:47:20,430
circuit we need to make the oven first before we can use the
circuit boards for anything we can get that do you think an

2990
02:47:20,430 --> 02:47:28,910
hour is enough for you to catch the bosses what the fuck is
that yeah i mean they die fast all right so getting to them

2991
02:47:28,910 --> 02:47:35,830
that's the problem you just need to make sure we get
everything ready for sure for in an hour so then he can

2992
02:47:35,830 --> 02:47:45,830
speed run catching the hard bosses i'm working on it yeah he
just dropped me at the quartz i'll but i made the base there

travel point and I'll be right there.

2994
02:47:55,230 --> 02:47:57,330
Do we need a special armor to survive there?

2995
02:47:57,890 --> 02:47:58,410
Just Tundra.

2996
02:47:58,670 --> 02:47:59,590
You need the cold armor.

02:48:00,430 --> 02:48:01,290
Oh, just kidding.

2998
02:48:01,430 --> 02:48:01,870
You need cold armor.

2999
02:48:03,050 --> 02:48:04,710
Then I'll have to make that first.

3000
02:48:04,830 --> 02:48:06,170
Unless you don't need it right now.

3001
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:08,290
You can just drop it for me.

3002
02:48:10,090 --> 02:48:15,750
If you have any, if you have a fire resistance armor or
anything, I can buy you two shirts.

3003
02:48:17,330 --> 02:48:18,990
I do have a fire resistance.

3004
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:20,790
Oh no, this is a heat resistance.

3005
02:48:21,450 --> 02:48:32,570
Oh, I found the dungeon i found it already oh nice okay sure
for it's time to destroy that base not yet not yet we need

3006
02:48:32,570 --> 02:48:39,290
that quartz but i found it mine the quartz i don't give a
fuck if you found it or not you want me to catch those

3007
02:48:39,290 --> 02:48:47,530
legendaries or what okay i'll mark it i'll mark it where am
i i'm gonna mark this right now it's like 250 minutes so we

3008
02:48:47,530 --> 02:48:48,710
have like lots of time for this

3009
02:48:52,130 --> 02:48:52,730
That was fast, though.

3010
02:48:52,770 --> 02:48:54,130
I didn't expect to find that.

3011
02:48:54,970 --> 02:48:58,430
Alright, I'm gonna really quick just get this fast travel.

3012
02:48:59,630 --> 02:49:00,070
Alright.

3013
02:49:00,450 --> 02:49:01,530
I found the... Oh.

There we go.

3015
02:49:02,750 --> 02:49:03,670
No, that's fucking ore.

3016
02:49:04,150 --> 02:49:04,310
Ore.

3017
02:49:05,510 --> 02:49:06,390
Oh my god, this one was...

3018
02:49:06,390 --> 02:49:07,410
Okay, I'm at a fast travel.

3019
02:49:07,530 --> 02:49:09,530
There's a town along the south coast.

3020
02:49:09,870 --> 02:49:10,150
Okay.

3021
02:49:10,310 --> 02:49:10,850
Oh, there is.

3022
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:16,130
Okay, I found that here.

3023
02:49:19,790 --> 02:49:20,230
And...

3024
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:21,970
Is that the one?

3025
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:33,190
why did i that's your nerf west guys i'm not high level
enough to do a legendary sure first the only closest one

3026
02:49:34,970 --> 02:49:40,970
yeah i don't think i'm gonna be killing a legendary yeah and
if he can't kill that today i can't kill a legendary i mean

3027
02:49:40,970 --> 02:49:49,850
i can probably kill it i mean we can get points from killing
it yeah we still get half points from killing yeah i mean

3028
02:49:49,850 --> 02:49:59,550
180 is better than nothing and they're cold in my mind i can
mine it don't worry well i can give you really close you

3029
02:49:59,550 --> 02:50:07,310
need like cold armor right resistance okay i can give you i
can get you one i'm going back to base and i'll make you one

3030
02:50:07,310 --> 02:50:27,470
nice i have to quads in no time uh let's see no no it's so
long let me see outfit okay i think i don't know sure if

02:50:27,470 --> 02:50:32,990
it's a normal tundra outfit okay or does she need like the i
don't know all right i'm just gonna make a normal one then

3032
02:50:32,990 --> 02:50:41,350
maybe it'll be fine i know i can buy two undershirts i know
if you have heat resistance i can buy two cold i do have

3033
02:50:41,350 --> 02:50:49,670
heat resistance yeah then i'll just go buy the two
undershirts it would be bing chiling actually I don't know.

3034
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:53,230
Chat says high or low protection is better, so I'll give
you...

3035
02:50:53,230 --> 02:50:54,430
I'll make it a normal one then.

3036
02:50:54,670 --> 02:50:54,970
It's okay.

3037
02:50:55,030 --> 02:50:58,490
I'm making her pelt right now.

3038
02:50:58,570 --> 02:50:58,810
Okay.

3039
02:50:59,710 --> 02:51:01,070
Oh, no, my pelt's hungry.

3040
02:51:01,230 --> 02:51:06,510
Wherever I can find the higher crafting area, because this
is a fucking mess right now.

3041
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:07,190
Yeah.

3042
02:51:09,410 --> 02:51:10,370
Where is it?

3043
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:13,310
Oh, there it is.

3044
02:51:13,850 --> 02:51:15,150
Cold, resistant pelt.

3045
02:51:15,330 --> 02:51:16,650
I'm not having any luck here.

3046
02:51:16,730 --> 02:51:18,110
I thought that there was going to be a bunch of...

3047
02:51:18,950 --> 02:51:29,940
ports here there's none here uh where are you here in the
base uh

3048
02:51:33,960 --> 02:51:50,040
drop there you go boom thank you wham bam now you can go
farm stuff back to palling let's see oh just palling around

3049
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:59,660
just palling around piling around try to see what i can put
away i have a lot of eggs but i don't think we need to hatch

3050
02:51:59,660 --> 02:52:12,440
i'm gonna fly back to the bay oh my god there's some lot of
forms i need um let's see i want to see i want pia to see

3051
02:52:12,440 --> 02:52:18,840
i'll catch the valet then where the is the valet okay all
right i'm so close to

3052
02:52:21,980 --> 02:52:22,500
Legendary.

3053
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:23,620
Almost there.

3054
02:52:23,880 --> 02:52:25,460
Tell me more about your legendary balls.

3055
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:31,220
Veilet, pal, world, location.

3056
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:32,520
I'm Zoe.

3057
02:52:33,620 --> 02:52:34,340
I forgive you.

3058
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:36,300
I don't actually want to know about that.

3059
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:37,500
That's all I thought.

3060
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:40,620
Make sure you check for lumps though.

3061
02:52:41,480 --> 02:52:42,240
Have you checked your balls?

3062
02:52:43,420 --> 02:52:47,060
I would say check for them yourselves but you guys don't
have balls.

3063
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:49,220
Oh man, no balls.

3064
02:52:49,660 --> 02:53:01,400
I do have loads so bullish what the did i just do okay it's
fine yeah oh there it is i'll catch the village right now we

3065
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:10,500
didn't we didn't want to have we didn't it's over here we
didn't want to have a lodging site that was i'm almost there

3066
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:13,880
how much polymer can i make gooch

3067
02:53:17,450 --> 02:53:24,210
hey dude could you get out of the way i believe you still
haven't found any lucky pals we're not lucky i can't believe

3068
02:53:24,210 --> 02:53:43,230

We're kicking.

3083
02:54:15,550 --> 02:54:18,010
We need a teammate replacement right now.

3084
02:54:18,410 --> 02:54:18,410
No.

3085
02:54:18,790 --> 02:54:19,350
I need to...

3086
02:54:19,350 --> 02:54:20,870
Alright, I'm moving the logging site.

3087
02:54:21,030 --> 02:54:21,770
I'm so sorry.

3088
02:54:23,910 --> 02:54:24,230
Ow.

3089
02:54:24,390 --> 02:54:24,830
Oh shit.

3090
02:54:24,950 --> 02:54:34,750
this is not good this is not good i'm not dodging okay did
we have a rough idea of how much coins we need in 150 oh i

3091
02:54:34,750 --> 02:54:42,090
think we might be fine actually oh shit at night it's very
cold oh my goodness i'm i think i'm dying at this wait what

3092
02:54:42,090 --> 02:54:51,090
i got what happened to the cold pill i guess at night it's
just too cold pp do you still need it quartz for anything uh

3093
02:54:51,090 --> 02:54:59,650
yeah so we need to make the circuit boards let me see so we
need to build the product assembly line um which requires I

3094
02:54:59,650 --> 02:55:05,450
believe 10 circuit boards so we need the quartz I think we
already and we need polymers too um but we should have

3095
02:55:05,450 --> 02:55:15,850
enough high quality pallet oil to make at least uh what's 36
divided by two we can make 18 we can make 18 polymers so we

3096
02:55:15,850 --> 02:55:24,370
can I think make that already uh but we pretty much want to
skip past it because we don't want to make the wait did we

3097
02:55:24,950 --> 02:55:30,950
advanced furnace oh never mind we already made it yeah i
made that okay okay yeah then we just need to legendary

3098
02:55:30,950 --> 02:55:36,490
balls okay cool then we just need to make the production
assembly line or the whatever it is uh the production

3099
02:55:36,490 --> 02:55:49,930
assembly line two the level two version i need 20 nails then
and i i think if we just get a few more cords i think that i

3100
02:55:49,930 --> 02:55:55,570
need to get some palladium fragments and some more iron
ingots Okay.

3101
02:55:56,950 --> 02:55:58,330
Or is it ingots?

3102
02:55:59,250 --> 02:56:00,610
I think I just need ore.

3103
02:56:01,350 --> 02:56:01,910
You just need ore.

3104
02:56:02,150 --> 02:56:02,330
Yeah.

3105
02:56:03,650 --> 02:56:05,730
Because then I can make the legendary balls.

3106
02:56:06,070 --> 02:56:06,450
Okay.

3107
02:56:09,390 --> 02:56:11,810
Okay, we have 200 quarts now.

3108
02:56:12,010 --> 02:56:12,510
Oh, shit.

3109
02:56:12,770 --> 02:56:13,210
That's a lot.

3110
02:56:14,770 --> 02:56:15,350
That should be enough.

3111
02:56:15,350 --> 02:56:15,690
That should be enough.

3112
02:56:15,970 --> 02:56:16,430
Yeah, yeah.

3113
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:18,010
All right, cool, cool, cool, cool.

3114
02:56:18,710 --> 02:56:20,190
Circuit boards are what level?

3115
02:56:20,610 --> 02:56:22,210
I don't know if I can assist.

3116
02:56:24,030 --> 02:56:24,510
But...

3117
02:56:24,950 --> 02:56:37,490
circuit boards circuit boards are from level level 35 okay
unfortunately i cannot help wait there's no palladium

3118
02:56:37,490 --> 02:56:45,210
fragment all right uh get ready to clip i think one of these
eggs wait no not this one can you make more palladium off of

3119
02:56:45,210 --> 02:56:51,950

That's fair.

3141
02:57:18,130 --> 02:57:24,190
As soon as the night is over, they're gonna make the
fragments i'm gonna farm some manually in the meantime just

3142
02:57:24,190 --> 02:57:34,910
leave me alone i have 40 now i don't know how much you need
in total we have a hundred almost just a bunch you know all

3143
02:57:34,910 --> 02:57:39,590
right i'm gonna go manually i'm about to get a bunch of
palladium fragments okay mostly mostly just trying to get

3144
02:57:39,590 --> 02:57:54,070
iron ore all right iron ore look i can i'm gonna finish this
cement um Should we take the bat off of the mining station

3145
02:57:54,070 --> 02:57:55,130
and put him on ore?

3146
02:57:56,770 --> 02:57:59,010
I think we can just mine the ore.

3147
02:57:59,190 --> 02:57:59,830
Are you fine?

3148
02:58:00,070 --> 02:58:00,230
Okay.

3149

Yeah.

3150
02:58:02,610 --> 02:58:03,030
I'm on it.

3151
02:58:03,170 --> 02:58:05,130
I'm getting pinged so hard right now.

3152
02:58:05,790 --> 02:58:06,330
I'm getting...

3153
02:58:06,330 --> 02:58:08,850
Because we also need to rock for like the fragments.

3154
02:58:09,090 --> 02:58:10,070
So I'm like, ah, shit.

3155
02:58:10,810 --> 02:58:11,570
Turns hat around.

3156
02:58:12,130 --> 02:58:12,850
Mining away.

3157
02:58:13,950 --> 02:58:14,990
Mining away.

3158
02:58:19,190 --> 02:58:21,930
You can move the base whenever now.

3159
02:58:22,270 --> 02:58:22,490
Okay.

3160
02:58:23,990 --> 02:58:27,590
Let me see if I can catch this fucking Veilet, and then we
can do that thing.

3161
02:58:28,470 --> 02:58:28,950
Oh, please.

3162
02:58:29,550 --> 02:58:30,730
Please just don't kill me.

3163
02:58:30,910 --> 02:58:31,710
I'm so low.

3164
02:58:33,730 --> 02:58:34,610
I'm going to force this.

3165
02:58:35,370 --> 02:58:36,270

We only need 10 circuit boards, right?

3219
03:00:34,660 --> 03:00:37,880
We need a lot, but we need 10 for right now.

3220

I added some more.

3221
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:42,580
Did you guys destroy the base yet?

3222
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:46,400
Did you destroy the base yet or no?

3223
03:00:47,740 --> 03:00:49,580
You're able to do that yourself.

3224
03:00:49,580 --> 03:00:50,200
Oh, I should be.

3225
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:50,640
Oh, yeah.

3226
03:00:50,780 --> 03:00:52,340
And I get the materials automatically, right?

3227
03:00:53,220 --> 03:01:00,160
the electric kitchen if you want to make that right now uh
sure we only need five circuit boards for that and then um

3228
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:08,000
for the exception for the uh assembly line two we need 10 so
we need to make like 15 circuit boards we need more high

03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:15,800
grade oil then i put some high grade oil in the chest
because i've fucking killed a lot of people wait do i have

3231
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:32,260
minutes left so okay we need to like speed run some stuff
after that mark and our mark we should start taking photos

3235
03:01:54,930 --> 03:01:57,450
Okay, I'm dismantling the quartz base then.

3236
03:01:58,030 --> 03:01:58,510
It's the one.

3237
03:01:59,290 --> 03:02:00,210
Shit, where is this?

3238
03:02:00,210 --> 03:02:02,450
We're good on quartz It's the one next to the quivern,
right?

3239
03:02:03,830 --> 03:02:05,010
Is that is that the base?

3240
03:02:06,210 --> 03:02:13,530
Uh, the one next to the quivern I don't see the map, but
it's the one above Anubis We we still need the Anubis one, I

3241
03:02:13,530 --> 03:02:13,730
think.

3242
03:02:13,930 --> 03:02:23,770
I don't know what that was uh the one above and can you guys
like head there so i can see where it is because i don't i'm

3243
03:02:23,770 --> 03:02:33,710
worried i'm gonna get the wrong base uh okay the the one
that's like do you see the quivern yeah the base that's near

3244
03:02:33,710 --> 03:02:39,730
the quivern don't destroy that oh okay so the one above the
yeah the one the highest one right yep yep the highest one

3245
03:02:39,730 --> 03:02:47,450
you can destroy that yeah all right yep okay i'm Is it near
anything?

3246
03:02:48,210 --> 03:02:52,790
We'll be base level 20 once we do pretty much just the
production line, I think.

3247
03:02:52,970 --> 03:02:54,710
And then, because we already have the electric.

3248
03:02:55,070 --> 03:02:57,490
So we should be automatically level 20.

3249
03:02:57,690 --> 03:02:58,310
We just make the...

3250
03:02:58,310 --> 03:02:58,970
I needed to make.

3251
03:02:59,190 --> 03:02:59,670
Head over.

3252
03:03:00,190 --> 03:03:02,750
Assembly line and the electric cooker.

3253
03:03:03,550 --> 03:03:04,290
Electric kitchen?

3254
03:03:04,810 --> 03:03:07,490

That was the only one?

3544
03:19:55,400 --> 03:19:56,500

3545
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:57,040
No!

3546
03:19:59,540 --> 03:20:00,940
Stop killing everything!

3547
03:20:04,810 --> 03:20:05,170
Okay.

3548
03:20:07,690 --> 03:20:08,670
Back to mining.

3549
03:20:09,250 --> 03:20:09,430
Okay.

3550
03:20:09,670 --> 03:20:10,090

03:20:48,160 --> 03:20:48,880
Can I get a different cow?

3556
03:20:48,960 --> 03:20:49,680
Oh, fuck off.

3557
03:20:49,820 --> 03:20:49,860

Come on.

3559
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:58,040
Why are you so hard to fucking catch?

3560
03:20:59,280 --> 03:21:01,860
It's like the cow knows that I'm trying to kill him or
something.

3561
03:21:03,720 --> 03:21:04,980
Maybe it's because you shot him?

3562
03:21:05,680 --> 03:21:06,120
Nah.

3563
03:21:06,640 --> 03:21:07,640
That can't be it.

3564
03:21:09,160 --> 03:21:10,460

give you my armor and then you can get if you know where it
is i can I've never been.

3568
03:21:44,750 --> 03:21:47,470
Somebody in the base building competition built a base
there.

3569
03:21:47,590 --> 03:21:49,250
That's why I know it exists, but...

3570
03:21:49,250 --> 03:21:49,330
Oh.

3571
03:21:49,770 --> 03:21:53,390
Yeah, I don't know where that is, so I don't know how to get
that for us.

3572
03:21:54,610 --> 03:21:55,770

3573
03:21:55,830 --> 03:21:56,550
What's your floor?

3574
03:21:57,270 --> 03:21:58,090
What are we talking about?

3575
03:21:58,430 --> 03:21:59,310
The volcano.

3576
03:22:00,030 --> 03:22:01,870
The volcano effigy.

3577
03:22:03,930 --> 03:22:09,330
I mean, I can find it on the map pretty easily, but I don't
know if I can traverse the locale to get there.

3578
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:11,050
I mean, I can give you my heat pelt.

Why isn't the lettuce on the cheeseburger?

3586
03:22:56,470 --> 03:22:57,490
Why is it on the hot dog?

3587
03:23:00,050 --> 03:23:01,770
Different strokes for different folks.

3588
03:23:02,890 --> 03:23:04,930

Bro, there's so many things I have to do right now.

3622
03:25:11,550 --> 03:25:13,690
You think I'm going to remember all the fucking exact
numbers?

3623
03:25:14,270 --> 03:25:14,970
I thought you're perfect.

3624
03:25:15,310 --> 03:25:15,850

03:25:16,650 --> 03:25:18,610
Yeah, perfect at the things I want to be perfect at.

3626
03:25:19,490 --> 03:25:20,510
And that's not being perfect.

03:25:21,710 --> 03:25:22,790
Perfect in my world.

3628
03:25:23,790 --> 03:25:26,550
Okay, other ways to farm high-quality pale oil.

3629
03:25:26,930 --> 03:25:28,430
I'm buying one of them right now.

3630
03:25:28,650 --> 03:25:29,570
The Wally Pops.

3631
03:25:29,670 --> 03:25:31,910
Wally Pops drop as well.

03:28:38,390 --> 03:28:40,630
We're almost there one hour left!

3685
03:28:40,970 --> 03:28:41,190
We're almost there!

3686
03:28:41,450 --> 03:28:41,890
Almost there!

3687
03:28:43,550 --> 03:28:44,330
Wait, wait, wait.

3688
03:28:44,590 --> 03:28:46,370
You signed up for this war soldier.

3689
03:28:46,570 --> 03:28:48,610
You have to finish it.

3690
03:28:49,390 --> 03:28:50,070
Oh, I'm working.

3691
03:28:50,610 --> 03:28:51,570
I'm mining.

3692
03:28:52,050 --> 03:28:52,970
And I'm mining.

3693
03:28:53,430 --> 03:28:54,510
And I'm mining.

3694
03:28:56,070 --> 03:28:57,310
She's trying her best.

3695
03:28:57,490 --> 03:28:58,150
She's mining.

3696
03:28:59,270 --> 03:28:59,950
I'm mining.

3697
03:29:00,470 --> 03:29:01,190
She's mine.

3698
03:29:01,210 --> 03:29:02,250
Now I hit the button again.

3699
03:29:02,410 --> 03:29:03,390
All right, let me know what you get.

3700
03:29:04,450 --> 03:29:05,010
Eighth place.

3701
03:29:05,030 --> 03:29:06,110
We're in eighth place right now.

3702
03:29:06,310 --> 03:29:07,170
So cute.

3703
03:29:07,450 --> 03:29:08,530
We're just waiting for you.

3704
03:29:10,090 --> 03:29:13,710
I'm slowly watching him flying to the fast travel.

3705
03:29:14,590 --> 03:29:16,450
He's almost there.

3706
03:29:16,470 --> 03:29:17,670
Almost there.

3707
03:29:18,310 --> 03:29:20,450
Should have to travel across the fucking desert.

3708
03:29:20,870 --> 03:29:25,590
Also, I'm registered 40, by the way, in case that becomes
relevant later.

3709
03:29:26,890 --> 03:29:28,230
Yeah, I only have 29.

3710
03:29:28,230 --> 03:29:29,750
If we want to clip that, we want to clip that.

3711
03:29:30,110 --> 03:29:30,270
Okay.

3712
03:29:31,130 --> 03:29:33,630
I'm still catching a lot, so I'm good to go.

3713
03:29:33,930 --> 03:29:37,150
I have 50, so that's like 60 points.

3714
03:29:37,410 --> 03:29:40,790
Yeah, because I think there's like a big leap between 30 and
40.

3715
03:29:40,870 --> 03:29:43,030
It was like 20 points versus 50 points.

yeah all right here we go sure four is sure four is almost

Message, message, message.

4322
04:00:20,150 --> 04:00:22,490
I said Anubis is bugged and they ignored me, so.

4323
04:00:23,870 --> 04:00:25,910
Just do the other bosses then.

4324
04:00:26,110 --> 04:00:26,350
All right.

4325
04:00:26,450 --> 04:00:27,310
Working on it.

4326
04:00:27,690 --> 04:00:27,930
All right.

4327
04:00:28,130 --> 04:00:30,070
I'm going to try to make a holding pen somewhere.

4328
04:00:33,760 --> 04:00:35,580
Well, rest in peace.

4329
04:00:36,380 --> 04:00:43,860
is really big actually it requires quite a lot more room
than i think we have to work with uh just put it at a

4330
04:00:43,860 --> 04:00:49,900
different base than like yeah yeah yeah yeah actually that's
a good idea because we need to put 20 anyway in there yeah

4331
04:00:49,900 --> 04:01:00,220
good good point all right i'm gonna go to the anubis base

4332
04:01:00,220 --> 04:01:08,800
right wait i forget what element earth is weak to what do i
need for the thing let's see How much time do we have left?

4333
04:01:08,940 --> 04:01:10,560
We have 17 minutes.

4334
04:01:11,040 --> 04:01:11,680
Do you need to trip for it?

4335
04:01:11,700 --> 04:01:13,840
Do you think we could do the Tower 3 together or now?

4336
04:01:14,040 --> 04:01:14,460
Peladium.

4337
04:01:15,620 --> 04:01:16,020
Probably.

4338
04:01:18,160 --> 04:01:20,080
How much more points do we get for that?

4339
04:01:20,200 --> 04:01:22,800
Tower 3 is...

4340
04:01:24,480 --> 04:01:25,860
That's 150 points.

4341
04:01:26,920 --> 04:01:27,260
Okay.

4342
04:01:27,540 --> 04:01:29,020
I can do that after I kill Anubis.

4343
04:01:29,180 --> 04:01:29,280
No.

4344
04:01:29,900 --> 04:01:30,880
I need to figure out...

4345
04:01:30,880 --> 04:01:32,300
Well, I need to kill this one too.

4346
04:01:32,500 --> 04:01:33,340
This other...

4347
04:01:33,340 --> 04:01:34,840
The fucking...

4348
04:01:34,840 --> 04:01:36,360
Where the fuck is this, Bob?

4349
04:01:37,020 --> 04:01:38,200
It's on the other island?

4350
04:01:38,860 --> 04:01:40,440
Guys, where's the botan?

4351
04:01:40,560 --> 04:01:41,380
Is it on the other island?

4352
04:01:41,980 --> 04:01:43,560
It's on the other fucking island.

4353
04:01:44,800 --> 04:01:45,140
Oh no.

4354
04:01:49,600 --> 04:01:50,000
What?

4355
04:01:50,660 --> 04:01:51,640
Are you level 50 yet?

4356
04:01:51,840 --> 04:01:52,120
Sure for?

4357
04:01:52,820 --> 04:01:55,220
No, if I kill some more bosses, I probably will be.

4358
04:01:55,520 --> 04:01:55,540
Okay.

4359
04:01:55,620 --> 04:01:57,160
I don't think I get levels from the...

4360
04:01:57,160 --> 04:01:57,360
What?

4361
04:01:57,500 --> 04:01:59,900
You get levels from the tower bosses?

4362
04:02:00,360 --> 04:02:00,760
Uh, yeah.

4363
04:02:00,880 --> 04:02:01,220
You do.

4364
04:02:01,460 --> 04:02:01,660
You do.

4365
04:02:02,320 --> 04:02:02,720
Oh, you do?

4366
04:02:02,880 --> 04:02:03,060
Okay.

4367
04:02:03,980 --> 04:02:04,380
Okay.

4368
04:02:08,650 --> 04:02:09,770
Building the holding pen.

4369
04:02:10,350 --> 04:02:11,390
Should be close now.

4370
04:02:12,030 --> 04:02:15,950
I'll put in as many humans as I can Lily, do you have humans
on you?

4371
04:02:17,470 --> 04:02:19,250
I have a ton in my box.

4372
04:02:19,670 --> 04:02:25,030
Yeah, yeah, can you go to where Pee-Pee is and then put some
humans in there because we need 20?

4373
04:02:28,760 --> 04:02:32,000
Let me just on my way catch this Lutmon.

4374
04:02:32,760 --> 04:02:33,640
Wait, I think I already got it.

4375
04:02:33,880 --> 04:02:35,480
They're all just fucking passed out.

4376
04:02:38,000 --> 04:02:41,920
I don't think I can do anything to them while it's
nighttime, but we can just throw them all on the ground and

4377
04:02:41,920 --> 04:02:42,520
that should be good enough.

4378
04:02:43,700 --> 04:02:45,360
One, two, three, four, five.

4379
04:02:46,300 --> 04:02:47,700
Wait, we can only put 15.

4380
04:02:47,860 --> 04:02:49,220
How are we supposed to put 20 of them in there?

4381
04:02:49,300 --> 04:02:49,640
Wait, what?

4382
04:02:50,880 --> 04:02:52,220
Anubis has been caught.

4383
04:02:52,220 --> 04:02:53,060
Clip, clip, clip, clip, clip.

4384
04:02:54,840 --> 04:02:57,360
Oh, you put them here!

4385
04:02:57,660 --> 04:02:58,140
Okay, wait.

4386
04:02:58,320 --> 04:02:58,680
Yeah, never mind.

4387
04:02:58,820 --> 04:02:59,000
We're good.

4388
04:02:59,180 --> 04:02:59,360
We're good.

4389
04:03:00,100 --> 04:03:00,420
We're good.

4390
04:03:00,420 --> 04:03:01,280
Okay, I can...

4391
04:03:01,280 --> 04:03:02,420
They all just fall in.

4392
04:03:02,920 --> 04:03:03,180
Yeah.

4393
04:03:03,500 --> 04:03:05,300
Clip, clip, clip, TP mod, Anubis.

4394
04:03:06,240 --> 04:03:06,600
That's wild.

4395
04:03:06,840 --> 04:03:07,080
Do you know where...

4396
04:03:07,080 --> 04:03:10,120
Are you able to get to that dungeon place?

4397
04:03:10,180 --> 04:03:11,660
Because I can just TP there and do it.

4398
04:03:11,940 --> 04:03:12,860
What, tower 3?

4399
04:03:13,860 --> 04:03:14,600
Yeah, the tower.

4400
04:03:14,660 --> 04:03:16,100
I don't know where tower 3 is, though.

4401
04:03:16,300 --> 04:03:16,760
Oh, wait, sure.

4402
04:03:16,940 --> 04:03:20,060
Do you have any humans you can put in this box since you're
right behind me anyway?

4403
04:03:20,600 --> 04:03:21,980
I mean, I got the black marketeers.

4404
04:03:22,220 --> 04:03:23,840
Yeah, just put them in there because we need...

4405
04:03:23,840 --> 04:03:25,220
How many more do you guys need for 20?

4406
04:03:25,460 --> 04:03:26,880
Uh, right now, I...

4407
04:03:26,880 --> 04:03:29,300
Oh, we only have, uh, 6, 7, 8, 9.

4408
04:03:29,460 --> 04:03:29,840
We've got 9.

4409
04:03:29,920 --> 04:03:30,140
9?

4410
04:03:30,320 --> 04:03:31,540
I have 8 on me.

4411
04:03:31,580 --> 04:03:32,700
I just want... I need to kill...

4412
04:03:32,700 --> 04:03:33,520
Oh, sorry, we've got 10.

4413
04:03:33,740 --> 04:03:34,840
Yeah, you can just put them in here.

4414
04:03:34,880 --> 04:03:35,960
Okay, I have 8 on me.

4415
04:03:36,020 --> 04:03:37,420
But I need... I won't kill this one.

4416
04:03:37,620 --> 04:03:38,360
Oh, my goodness.

4417
04:03:38,600 --> 04:03:40,120
I might just go to the tower then.

4418
04:03:40,200 --> 04:03:41,080
Yeah, you go to the tower.

4419
04:03:41,280 --> 04:03:42,460
I'm gonna do...

4420
04:03:43,360 --> 04:03:46,280
Find the fucking last boss here for medium.

4421
04:03:47,060 --> 04:03:49,360
Well, we'll leave our 10 humans in there for right now.

4422
04:03:49,600 --> 04:03:50,380
It's right here.

4423
04:03:50,620 --> 04:03:50,760
Okay.

4424
04:03:51,760 --> 04:03:52,660
You're here somewhere.

4425
04:03:52,880 --> 04:03:56,000
Yeah, whoever puts the last human in, just clip it.

4426
04:03:56,240 --> 04:03:57,340
Okay, it'll be me.

4427
04:03:57,560 --> 04:03:58,320
Wait, P.P., I don't know.

4428
04:03:58,520 --> 04:03:59,300
Wait, where you at?

4429
04:03:59,360 --> 04:03:59,940
I don't see you.

4430
04:03:59,980 --> 04:04:00,880
I'm at the Anubis base.

4431
04:04:01,760 --> 04:04:03,160
The fuck is the last guy.

4432
04:04:03,420 --> 04:04:05,180
Wait, why doesn't that show where you are?

4433
04:04:05,300 --> 04:04:05,980
That's so weird.

4434
04:04:06,260 --> 04:04:08,020
Oh, because I'm bugged right now.

4435
04:04:08,440 --> 04:04:08,680
Oh.

4436
04:04:09,320 --> 04:04:09,640
Yeah.

4437
04:04:09,720 --> 04:04:12,420
Come to the Anubis base and then don't use the pale box.

4438
04:04:12,520 --> 04:04:13,340
Use the actual...

4439
04:04:13,760 --> 04:04:14,160
cage.

4440
04:04:14,460 --> 04:04:16,280
Just come over and press X and you can put him in there.

4441
04:04:16,560 --> 04:04:17,120
Oh, there he is.

4442
04:04:17,260 --> 04:04:17,460
Okay.

4443
04:04:18,360 --> 04:04:20,720
Alright, I'm gonna go kill Botan.

4444
04:04:21,780 --> 04:04:22,180
One.

4445
04:04:22,880 --> 04:04:23,280
Two.

4446
04:04:24,020 --> 04:04:26,660
Keep thinking you're talking about Yu-Yu-Hakusho every time
you say it.

4447
04:04:27,640 --> 04:04:28,040
Alright.

4448
04:04:29,720 --> 04:04:30,520
Holy shit.

4449
04:04:30,700 --> 04:04:31,140
Oh, dang.

4450
04:04:31,340 --> 04:04:32,500
That's some cute humans!

4451
04:04:33,520 --> 04:04:34,440
What number are we at now?

4452
04:04:35,780 --> 04:04:36,720
I can't see.

4453
04:04:36,780 --> 04:04:38,000
It's kind of buggy for me.

4454
04:04:38,340 --> 04:04:40,000
It doesn't really show it.

4455
04:04:40,060 --> 04:04:41,220
There's a raid apparently.

4456
04:04:41,640 --> 04:04:41,720
12, 13.

4457
04:04:41,900 --> 04:04:42,760
Wait, 12, 13.

I thought maybe if I left they just wouldn't be interested.

4468
04:05:47,900 --> 04:05:49,280
Oh, that's a funny point!

4469

That's right, that's a.

4472
04:05:54,900 --> 04:05:56,360
That's a hundred points to catch it.

4473
04:05:56,500 --> 04:05:57,360
I can't defend the base.

4474
04:05:57,480 --> 04:05:58,380
They're destroying the mailbox.

4475
04:05:58,780 --> 04:05:59,540
Oh, this is not correct.

4476
04:05:59,700 --> 04:06:00,500
I don't really know what to do.

4477
04:06:00,680 --> 04:06:01,860
There's like, You just leave.

4478
04:06:02,140 --> 04:06:04,060
If you just leave, they don't attack anything.

4479
04:06:04,060 --> 04:06:05,040
Yeah, just leave, just leave.

4480
04:06:05,560 --> 04:06:06,460
I got it!

4481
04:06:06,780 --> 04:06:07,080
Nice.

4482
04:06:07,220 --> 04:06:08,160
Quick, quick, quick, quid.

4483
04:06:08,180 --> 04:06:08,920
Quick, quick!

4484
04:06:09,100 --> 04:06:11,280
Clip, quick, quick.

4485
04:06:13,360 --> 04:06:15,360
Uh, they're chasing me, um...

4486
04:06:18,580 --> 04:06:20,620
Just teleport away, like, too long.

4487
04:06:21,200 --> 04:06:24,540
I got too far away from the paddle box, so I'm just gonna
fly away now.

4488
04:06:24,880 --> 04:06:25,460
Ah, fuck!

4489
04:06:25,720 --> 04:06:26,260
Alright, I'm dead.

4490
04:06:26,500 --> 04:06:27,260
Well, you know what, it's fine.

4491
04:06:27,420 --> 04:06:27,940
I saw it, I saw it.

4492
04:06:28,440 --> 04:06:28,920
Clip, clip, clip!

4493
04:06:29,080 --> 04:06:29,440

04:09:54,330 --> 04:09:54,750
All right.

4554
04:09:54,990 --> 04:09:55,710

I'm too busy clipping, but they're so hungry.

4557
04:09:59,890 --> 04:10:03,050
Let me see Lyft Monks if I can get anything on that, but I
don't think so.

4558
04:10:03,210 --> 04:10:06,570
You need to be back by three minutes if you can, so we can
do the chickpea.

4559
04:10:07,570 --> 04:10:08,070
How much time we got?

4560
04:10:08,090 --> 04:10:10,570
Well, I just died to like a bug or some shit, so I'm here.

04:10:10,990 --> 04:10:12,230
Okay, let's do the stream now.

4562
04:10:13,270 --> 04:10:13,630
Okay.

4563
04:10:13,950 --> 04:10:14,850
I need a butcher knife.

Wait, what is Lyft Monk?

4565
04:10:17,090 --> 04:10:20,690

real quick and then I'll do it.

4568
04:10:26,810 --> 04:10:27,690

04:10:28,210 --> 04:10:29,230
Can you make- Yeah, just give me one.

4570

04:10:31,790 --> 04:10:32,030
Okay.

4572
04:10:32,230 --> 04:10:33,430

my pal box right now.

4576
04:10:45,930 --> 04:10:46,650
Meat cleavers.

4577
04:10:46,790 --> 04:10:48,170
Do we have to do it all at the same time?

4578
04:10:48,230 --> 04:10:48,950
Let me see.

4579
04:10:50,890 --> 04:10:51,590
Where is it?

4580
04:10:51,630 --> 04:10:54,130
All teams must be within this mansion mantle of chickpea.

4581
04:10:54,610 --> 04:10:55,070
I think so.

4582
04:10:55,150 --> 04:10:56,590
We should all get together then.

4583
04:10:57,350 --> 04:10:57,350
Okay.

4584
04:10:57,730 --> 04:10:58,310
Meat cleavers.

4585
04:10:58,490 --> 04:10:59,330
Yeah, we'll have to do it at the same time.

4586
04:11:02,830 --> 04:11:03,550
In the...

4587
04:11:03,550 --> 04:11:04,530

We just had it.

4786
04:20:22,230 --> 04:20:24,490

You know what, though?

4887
04:25:10,350 --> 04:25:11,990
Trust the process, right?

4888
04:25:12,150 --> 04:25:15,450
We said it was going to be slow at the start and big gains
at the end.

4889
04:25:15,690 --> 04:25:17,410
That was way too stressful.

4890
04:25:17,610 --> 04:25:18,410
Not gonna lie.

4891
04:25:18,710 --> 04:25:19,610
That was really sad.

4892
04:25:19,930 --> 04:25:20,710
Trust the process.

4893
04:25:22,170 --> 04:25:23,590
All people had to do.

4894
04:25:23,770 --> 04:25:26,310
We would have been so much better if people just trusted us.

4895
04:25:26,310 --> 04:25:26,830
Yeah, that's true.

4896
04:25:27,070 --> 04:25:27,330

You know, that's right.

We trust it so hard.

4900
04:25:31,430 --> 04:25:33,070
We trust it so hard.

4901
04:25:33,230 --> 04:25:36,590
We trusted so fucking hard trust go.

4902
04:25:37,730 --> 04:25:38,610

It's not our fault.

4912
04:26:37,110 --> 04:26:39,350
Turf was too weak for his pal.

4915
04:26:44,310 --> 04:26:45,050
It's not our fault.

4916
04:26:45,130 --> 04:26:47,230
His pal isn't...

4917
04:26:48,590 --> 04:26:49,090

Give us that point.

4928
04:26:59,830 --> 04:27:01,320
It doesn't change our placements.

04:28:03,990 --> 04:28:04,870
Count it.

4940
04:28:04,950 --> 04:28:07,050
There's no mention of player level 50.

4941
04:28:07,310 --> 04:28:08,510
That's a whole different achievement.

4942
04:28:09,250 --> 04:28:11,730
That's a different achievement for a reason.

4943
04:28:12,230 --> 04:28:13,410
That's a different achievement.

4944
04:28:13,870 --> 04:28:19,430
If they wanted it to be PAL and trainer, they would have
clarified in the rules, but they didn't.

4945
04:28:19,610 --> 04:28:24,710
It would have been one achievement for more points, but they
split the achievement.

4946
04:28:26,150 --> 04:28:26,590
Objection!

The mod's not coming over.

They don't want to fight us.

4971

04:30:41,630 --> 04:30:45,990
Look, I'm a Vtuber, I can't read, but I can read the word
pal, and that's all it said.

4992
04:30:46,310 --> 04:30:47,170
They deleted it.

4993
04:30:48,170 --> 04:30:49,750
They stopped typing!

4994
04:30:50,750 --> 04:30:52,610
They stopped typing?

4995
04:30:53,150 --> 04:30:54,450
They're ghosting us!

4996
04:30:55,290 --> 04:31:04,730
Yeah, I'm gonna do it again Typing again, typing Typing
typing typing typing typing Oh, oh, oh Where is it?

4997
04:31:04,910 --> 04:31:11,530
Come on We want to do it Give the others that point too We
don't care We deserve it Everybody deserves those points

4998
04:31:11,530 --> 04:31:14,710
Come on No!

4999
04:31:15,010 --> 04:31:22,390
Yeah, but that's a red number That doesn't matter It doesn't
Yeah, but it doesn't mention cap It isn't a cap So what?

5000
04:31:22,470 --> 04:31:27,810
Nothing mentions cap Nothing mentions We have a separate
achievement for player level.

5001
04:31:27,910 --> 04:31:29,130
What's the point then?

5002
04:31:30,290 --> 04:31:31,430
What the fuck's the point?

5003
04:31:31,810 --> 04:31:32,990
Yeah, what the fuck's the point?

5004
04:31:33,450 --> 04:31:34,110
We're being robbed.

5005
04:31:34,590 --> 04:31:35,830
We're being robbed right now.

5006
04:31:36,710 --> 04:31:39,870
We're being such huge carrots at the moment.

5007
04:31:41,310 --> 04:31:42,530
That's our third place.

5008
04:31:43,010 --> 04:31:44,690
That's our third place right there.

5009
04:31:49,990 --> 04:31:51,130
It's a dire wolf.

5010
04:31:51,430 --> 04:31:53,870
There was no way we captured a level 50.

5011
04:31:54,930 --> 04:32:04,990
dire wolf we leveled at fairish show me a level 50 dire wolf
and i'll show you a god there is no such thing pepe hands

5012
04:32:04,990 --> 04:32:16,850
we've been scummas we've been scummas unbelievable if you
don't make the rules proper we deserve the points that is

5013
04:32:16,850 --> 04:32:25,210
the mistake for next time that has to be fixed they did
count they did count the pack 20 humans right They did.

5014
04:32:25,550 --> 04:32:26,410
They should have.

5015
04:32:26,650 --> 04:32:27,010
Yeah.

5016
04:32:27,450 --> 04:32:31,590
I think half points at least is a good compensation.

5017
04:32:33,370 --> 04:32:34,410
Oh my god.

5018
04:32:34,710 --> 04:32:35,550
At least half.

5019
04:32:36,970 --> 04:32:40,210
At least half for when my fangle at the end.

5020
04:32:40,330 --> 04:32:42,710
I put a woo at the end so they can't get mad at me.

5021
04:32:43,730 --> 04:32:45,170
It's illegal to be mad.

5022
04:32:45,370 --> 04:32:46,150
It's internet girl magic.

5023
04:32:46,830 --> 04:32:50,670
Can we get partial points for when?

5024
04:32:55,910 --> 04:33:05,950
I just learned how to read, but it doesn't say cap.

5025
04:33:13,310 --> 04:33:15,610
All caps so they know I'm serious.

5026
04:33:17,910 --> 04:33:21,310
I like how Fangalob is in cap because he Googled the name.

5027
04:33:21,330 --> 04:33:23,710
Because I copied and pasted it from the Google Doc.

5028
04:33:25,810 --> 04:33:29,630
Can we get partial points for my...

5029
04:33:29,630 --> 04:33:30,110
Fengalope.

5030
04:33:30,190 --> 04:33:30,770
Fengalope!

5031
04:33:35,090 --> 04:33:37,190
That's how they know I'm serious.

5032
04:33:37,790 --> 04:33:40,170
So sure if I wrote...

5033
04:33:40,170 --> 04:33:40,810
Oh my god.

5034
04:33:41,370 --> 04:33:43,200
Half points, please, because...

5035
04:33:43,690 --> 04:33:44,350
Fengalope.

5036
04:33:44,870 --> 04:33:45,310
Fengalope!

5037
04:33:46,530 --> 04:33:46,970
Fengalope!

5038
04:33:46,970 --> 04:33:50,130
Oh, are you choking?

5039
04:33:51,630 --> 04:33:52,470
Bro.

5040
04:33:53,490 --> 04:33:54,410
Oh my god.

5041
04:33:54,990 --> 04:33:56,490
Give us those points!

5042
04:33:58,010 --> 04:33:59,290
Give us those points!

5043
04:34:00,430 --> 04:34:02,410
Did we get a clip of the kill?

5044
04:34:03,130 --> 04:34:03,990
Okay, we did, yeah.

5045
04:34:04,390 --> 04:34:06,090
Yeah, we got a clip of the kill, probably.

5046
04:34:06,270 --> 04:34:07,470
We should have, yeah.

5047
04:34:07,950 --> 04:34:12,390
That should have been there.

5048
04:34:15,110 --> 04:34:19,270
Yeah, and then I walked up to Anubis and he was bugged and
then I had to kill him later.

5049
04:34:19,610 --> 04:34:20,570
Guys, we're not third.

5050
04:34:20,570 --> 04:34:21,450
Everything's against me.

5051
04:34:22,230 --> 04:34:25,470
That's why we're trying so hard to get these extra points.

5052
04:34:25,950 --> 04:34:28,770
Because if we get the extra points, we would be third.

5053
04:34:29,290 --> 04:34:29,970
No, we're four.

5054
04:34:30,170 --> 04:34:32,010
We literally need 20 more points.

5055
04:34:35,430 --> 04:34:36,810
Oh, my guys.

5056
04:34:37,370 --> 04:34:38,930
It's not about the money.

5057
04:34:39,230 --> 04:34:40,650
It's top three.

5058
04:34:42,930 --> 04:34:44,710
It's about bragging rights.

5059
04:34:44,950 --> 04:34:45,850
You wouldn't understand.

5060
04:34:45,910 --> 04:34:47,910
You don't understand, guys.

5061
04:34:48,050 --> 04:34:52,770
Because top three, third and fourth place gets the same
amount of money.

5062
04:34:53,130 --> 04:35:01,350
They get the same amount of to put pile tournament champion
top three in my file for at least a week i need that on my

5063
04:35:01,350 --> 04:35:08,010

Can I just say sure for?

5066
04:35:29,210 --> 04:35:33,790
I don't know who's making your clips, but they're very
sassiest clips.

5067
04:35:34,530 --> 04:35:34,910
Those are me.

5068
04:35:35,750 --> 04:35:36,470
Yeah, look at it.

5069
04:35:36,710 --> 04:35:37,590
It says clipped by.

5070
04:35:38,030 --> 04:35:38,790
You're sassy.

5071
04:35:39,190 --> 04:35:40,090
I am sassy.

5072
04:35:41,050 --> 04:35:43,050
I told you I've contained myself.

5073
04:35:43,390 --> 04:35:44,730
I played with great men.

5074
04:35:46,630 --> 04:35:47,150
Dang.

5075
04:35:48,090 --> 04:35:49,650
Because it's not about the money.

5076
04:35:49,910 --> 04:35:52,090
Third and fourth get the same amount of money.

5077
04:35:53,670 --> 04:35:53,930
Okay.

5078
04:35:55,610 --> 04:35:57,490
Ryan Higgins team got more points.

5079
04:35:57,610 --> 04:35:58,470
I don't think we can go.

5080
04:35:58,550 --> 04:35:59,850
Oh, they got more.

5081
04:35:59,990 --> 04:36:03,150
Oh, no, no, we can if we get them.

5082
04:36:03,410 --> 04:36:04,350
No, no, no, no.

5083
04:36:04,370 --> 04:36:06,150
And we get the partial points.

5084
04:36:06,550 --> 04:36:08,110
How are they still getting more points?

5085
04:36:08,730 --> 04:36:10,810
Wait, how the fuck are they still getting more points?

5086
04:36:10,990 --> 04:36:12,270
The report is over.

5087
04:36:14,270 --> 04:36:18,910
I want to know how Team Garrick is six after they were first
from day one.

5088
04:36:19,490 --> 04:36:21,290
They did all, no, because they did all the global.

5089
04:36:21,570 --> 04:36:21,850
Oh, yeah.

5090
04:36:21,870 --> 04:36:24,070
They did all the global stuff in the day one.

5091
04:36:24,390 --> 04:36:26,490
They didn't have a good foundation.

5092
04:36:26,890 --> 04:36:27,950
They didn't have a good foundation.

5093
04:36:28,210 --> 04:36:31,570
They didn't have a process that was to be trusted.

5094
04:36:32,590 --> 04:36:36,310
We actually got the second most day two achievement points.

5095
04:36:36,770 --> 04:36:37,430
Let's go.

5096
04:36:37,850 --> 04:36:39,990
We just didn't get lucky pals.

5097
04:36:40,590 --> 04:36:45,330
I spent like six hours making that document yesterday.

5098
04:36:45,930 --> 04:36:45,930
Okay.

5099
04:36:46,210 --> 04:36:50,230
Can someone tell me how Zentrea's team got zero day two
achievement points?

5100
04:36:50,890 --> 04:36:53,190
They forfeited day two.

5101
04:36:54,390 --> 04:36:57,470
Like, if one of your teammates couldn't do a day two, so
they forfeited.

5102
04:36:57,930 --> 04:36:59,470
Oh, why didn't they just say a new person?

5103
04:37:00,270 --> 04:37:01,770
I guess, like, it's so last minute.

5104
04:37:01,950 --> 04:37:05,290
Maybe because, like, is Iron Mouse the host of the world?

5105
04:37:05,450 --> 04:37:06,330
That could have been it.

5106
04:37:06,950 --> 04:37:08,250
Wait, wait, they're typing.

5107
04:37:08,750 --> 04:37:09,550
They're typing now.

5108
04:37:09,750 --> 04:37:10,090
They're typing.

5109
04:37:10,970 --> 04:37:11,270
They're typing.

5110
04:37:11,950 --> 04:37:12,350
This is right.

5111
04:37:12,490 --> 04:37:13,150
Shut up.

5112
04:37:14,570 --> 04:37:16,630
Never invite Team Doki again.

5113
04:37:16,910 --> 04:37:17,470
Talk to you anymore.

5114
04:37:17,930 --> 04:37:18,790
Retourish a flesh man.

5115
04:37:21,970 --> 04:37:22,770
Stupid trash.

5116
04:37:22,770 --> 04:37:24,370

It's not good enough!

5137

It doesn't have the same ring as top three!

5138
04:39:58,700 --> 04:39:59,280

04:40:01,270 --> 04:40:02,840

I know it doesn't sound as good on the Twitter profile.

5141
04:40:08,040 --> 04:40:11,780
How am I supposed to drag the fourth place on my Twitter
profile?
