1
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Hey everybody!

2
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,800
I wasn't ready!

3
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,340
What the heck?

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,440
I did a countdown!

5
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,740
You had to be the most ready because you started before any of us really.

6
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,780
I was like, Doki, no please, I'm not ready.

7
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,280
And she was like, I don't give a shit.

8
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,500
Oh yeah, yeah, fuck you.

9
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,800
This is my stream now.

10
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,580
We're live!

11
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,880
We're live now!

12
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,840
Fuck you!

13
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,280
Stop being bully.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,460
Don't bully Squirt, stop.

15
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,200
No, no, no, we're here to bully Surefour.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
The only non-Btuber here.

17
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,000
Surefour, have you checked your balls?

18
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,040
That's not bullying.

19
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:24,940
Balls check?

20
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,120
Wait, you want me to start talking about touching my balls?

21
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,140
I don't think so.

22
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,220
I don't think so.

23
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,920
I'm the one that's being tame here.

24
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,400
I am suppressing myself.

25
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,860
You want me to take my balls out?

26
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,460
Woah!

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,980
This is a medical check here, Surefour.

28
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,940
I've been talking about my headlight for like five steps ahead.

29
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,280
I've been talking about my constipation for a while, like now it's your turn.

30
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:02,960
Hey, go for it.

31
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,580
This is a health stream now.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,880
This is a health check.

33
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,240
We want to make sure everybody is medically okay.

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,440
There is nothing you can say that would make me uncomfortable.

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,660
I'm ironed by this.

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,500
To be fair...

37
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,160
Do it!

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,920
Do it!

39
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,460
I dare you!

40
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,260
Alright, Lily, do it!

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,040
Say something, but don't go for European!

42
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,280
Uh...

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Anal warts.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,280
What?

45
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,880
Yeah, what about it?

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Got them all.

47
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,520
You got some of those?

48
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,600
Oh, hello.

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,900
What about it, Lily?

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,140
Why did that...

51
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,580
What is your first thing you want to say?

52
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,840
Do you have something to tell us?

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,780
I don't know.

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,380
I just figured...

55
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,540
Okay, I guess we're not really on the same wavelength here.

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,420
Okay, I will...

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,160
I just thought that maybe, you know, maybe you just coincidentally googled for absolutely no reason whatsoever what it's like to have them.

58
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,540
Why did you google anal warts?

59
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,100
Can you explain for me what it might be like to have them?

60
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,040
I wasn't interested at all about my anal lumps.

61
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,560
I wasn't seeing any suspicious growth.

62
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,340
It's alright.

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,880
I hope you started at all and not images.

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,960
How do you even see them?

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,320
Yeah, how do you...

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,340
Oh, wait, are they inside?

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,920
Wait...

68
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,000
Maybe I was just investigating my health.

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,540
That's the blowhole blast.

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,960
Can you buy one of those doctor equipments that's got a camera and like a tube?

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,960
Oh, no!

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
Wait, Loki, that would be so fun.

73
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,300
That's what you do with the prize money.

74
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,340
What the fuck?

75
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,840
How did you know?

76
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,900
That would be so fun.

77
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,520
Are you gonna make a stream just dedicated to that?

78
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,600
I need to defend.

79
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,720
Okay, okay, okay.

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,480
But if you had one of those, which hole would you stick it in first?

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,680
I think... I think nose would be so funny.

82
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,340
Nose?

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,960
The nose?

84
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,380
Yeah.

85
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,140
The nose.

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,600
Why?

87
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,560
Cause like, it's like weird and...

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,540
Okay, maybe that's just me, but if you stick it up your butt, it's like, what do you expect?

89
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,500
Like, you kinda know what to expect.

90
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,120
But like the nose, it's like, it's full of like hairs and like maybe it's tiny, but maybe it's also just like a fat boogie.

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,860
Like, it's full of surprises, man!

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,160
If the camera's small enough, you can stick it down the edge of your eye.

93
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,440
Oh!

94
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,920
Oh, good!

95
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,420
Good guys!

96
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,160
Wow!

97
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,820
Straight in the slime, no thanks.

98
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,120
I can look for my last eyelashes.

99
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,940
Oh my god.

100
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,720
You know when you have eyelashes and your eye, you rub it and suddenly it's gone, it's like, well, that's just in the back of my eye forever now.

101
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Dude, I never thought about it.

102
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,620
Where do they go?

103
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,460
Right, but if one doesn't go, they manage to disappear.

104
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,580
I feel like it's biodegradable, isn't it?

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,420
They get disintegrated.

106
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,260
Oh, boy!

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,220
It's like when there's bugs that randomly fly into your eyes.

108
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,700
No!

109
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,360
No!

110
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,120
They just get disintegrated.

111
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,900
Oh, boy!

112
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,660
Is that real?

113
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,160
Guys, can we...

114
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,000
Bugs fly into people's eyes all the time.

115
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,480
Okay, I had it a lot when I was bicycling a lot.

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
I was like, little fucking bugs in my eyes.

117
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,700
That's just a nature massage.

118
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,660
I don't want them to touch my eyeballs.

119
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,460
How did we get here?

120
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,820
How the fuck did we...

121
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,460
Guys, how about we discuss...

122
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,560
We got here because you tried to make me uncomfortable.

123
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,540
Let's talk about the strats that we're gonna be doing for day two, everybody.

124
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:09,760
That's boring.

125
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,560
Why don't we tell our chat what we're planning on doing for day two, everyone?

126
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,840
Our chat is just like, I can't believe I got up early for this.

127
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,360
My condolences.

128
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,260
But you kind of knew what you were signing up for.

129
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,740
Don't pretend.

130
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,280
Come on.

131
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,580
Look at this.

132
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,840
Look at these people.

133
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,740
Look at them.

134
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,520
What do you mean, these people?

135
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,600
Yeah, what do you mean?

136
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:39,740
I don't know.

137
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:39,880
Or they're saying Lily.

138
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,420
These people.

139
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,320
One of us is a literal big bugger.

140
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,420
What the hell?

141
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,080
How do you say that about Dokie?

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,860
That's so rude.

143
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,040
That's discrimination.

144
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,280
Live on stream?

145
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,680
Live on stream?

146
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,560
I can't believe Shidelyv2 has been cancelled.

147
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,280
Oh my...

148
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,660
Again.

149
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,360
Again.

150
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,860
I couldn't see the Twitlengers.

151
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,100
I can sense them.

152
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,280
You can't.

153
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,660
Oh my god.

154
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:19,220
Anyways, so our jobs today, Shorifor is our, as always, our power leveler.

155
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,860
He is the tank of the group.

156
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
He's gonna be catching all the hard pals.

157
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,400
I will be focused on the medium pals and also catching all the ingredients for the food.

158
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,840
Lily is the ballmaster.

159
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,740
I'm the ballmaster.

160
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,680
She's gonna be the ballmaster and Peepee will be the basemaster.

161
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,400
So, and she's gonna be working on doing all the base stuff.

162
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,080
And so yeah, that is our job.

163
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,120
At the two hour mark, we're gonna be doing dungeon runs.

164
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,320
And then one hour mark, we're gonna be petting some pals.

165
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,300
So just to make sure we all remember that.

166
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,760
Wait, when are we doing the, are we doing the faction towers too as well?

167
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,540
After the dungeons?

168
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,040
Yeah.

169
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,940
Should we do them as a group or singular?

170
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,780
I mean, if you can do it singular, do it.

171
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,760
I mean, the first one should be easy as fuck.

172
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,920
Yeah, I can do this first one.

173
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,480
I can focus on the first tower.

174
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,920
Honestly, I can do that right now.

175
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
I don't know, cause it's so low leveled.

176
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,400
Aye.

177
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,160
Yeah, and then we can figure out the other towers.

178
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,360
After, on the two hour mark when we're doing the dungeons.

179
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,260
Oh yeah, so anyway, that's our plan.

180
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,040
We actually have a plan this time.

181
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,520
Well, we.

182
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,580
We're not going in super blind.

183
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:33,660
We're not going in super blind.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,200
Alright guys, I believe in us to be still top ten after this.

185
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
Oh yeah, easy, easy.

186
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,720
Yeah, we didn't do any of the global points, so that's the great part.

187
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,220
Yeah, cause we were just power leveling.

188
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,420
Trusting the process.

189
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,440
Just trust the process.

190
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,380
Just trust the process.

191
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,880
Also like, we know that legendaries are like 360 points.

192
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,940
But Surefour was like, there's no way we can get it.

193
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,900
Maybe it's just cause I was playing the game with the hardest difficulty.

194
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,120
Maybe it's easier now.

195
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,060
Maybe.

196
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,360
Oh, we check try it later.

197
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
Like at the one hour mark.

198
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,920
And see if we can catch any legendaries.

199
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,660
Also, the admin wants to see your world settings.

200
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:17,880
Oh.

201
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,080
Okay.

202
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,840
They're asking for it.

203
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh yeah, we're supposed to start in one minute.

204
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
Like scrolling and shit.

205
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,720
Oh wait, no, they're starting the checks in one minute.

206
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,460
Alright, alright.

207
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,040
Cool, cool, cool.

208
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,300
I'm scrolling up and down.

209
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,240
He's trying his best.

210
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm scrolling up and down.

211
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,320
I think we should figure out the breeding stuff too.

212
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,500
Like if we have the palace for it.

213
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,580
When we're in.

214
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,920
Oh my goodness, Peepee, I just saw your freaking Twitch Rivals image.

215
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,800
Wait, that's so cute.

216
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,360
What?

217
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,860
Wait, that's so adorable.

218
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,120
I also drew Surefour.

219
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,700
Wait, what was it?

220
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,460
Wait, you drew this?

221
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,380
The character's name is like Chisumi?

222
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,980
Yeah, yeah.

223
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,320
Yeah.

224
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,140
Chisumi.

225
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,320
Chisumi.

226
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,700
Chisumi.

227
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,520
Chisumi.

228
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,840
Chisumi.

229
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,080
Chisumi.

230
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,100
Chisumi.

231
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,180
My alt account in Overwatch.

232
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,540
Ah, sorry I doxxed you on me.

233
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,960
Oh, that's fine.

234
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,740
You know, he has a VTuber model too.

235
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,100
Yeah, he's a VTuber.

236
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,480
But he refused to be a VTuber.

237
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,740
I'm used to it once.

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,700
He's too scared.

239
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,740
Hard time VTuber.

240
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,640
He's too scared.

241
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,360
He's a coward.

242
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,660
I'm not scared.

243
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,700
I'm not a coward.

244
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,300
Alright, turn it on then.

245
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,380
Why don't you turn it on?

246
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,060
Oh, that chat.

247
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,720
Your streamer's a VTuber.

248
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,400
You think I have my fucking shit set up right now?

249
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,240
You know what?

250
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,420
Chat, Surefour chat, how do you feel that your streamer's a part-time VTuber?

251
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:43,700
Yeah.

252
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,220
How do you feel about that?

253
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,040
Are you expecting me to like respond for you?

254
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,560
Like you're asking my...

255
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,080
Are you like looking at it right now?

256
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,360
Like what's going on here?

257
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,830
I think I can start the world, right?

258
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,750
Your chat does not...

259
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,350
We need the code.

260
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,110
Yeah, we need the code.

261
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,230
Wait, you're already a furry?

262
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,950
When were you a furry?

263
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,790
I was never a furry.

264
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,890
Then why is your chat saying you're a furry?

265
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,810
They call me Scaly because I like dragons.

266
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,410
Don't hide the truth.

267
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,590
No, I am.

268
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,930
Embrace your truth.

269
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,870
Embrace who you are.

270
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,690
Embrace your truth.

271
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,570
Don't be scared.

272
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,910
Listen, I'm one of the most truthful people you'll ever meet.

273
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,690
If I was a furry, I would just say it.

274
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,190
Yeah, but isn't a Scaly also a furry?

275
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,250
Yeah.

276
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,790
But I'm not a Scaly either.

277
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:33,810
Hmm.

278
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,550
So you're trying to say your chat is lying?

279
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:43,010
I just like dragon... Listen, so dragon girls and cat girls are not on the furry scale.

280
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,130
Yes they are!

281
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,270
How are they not on the furry scale?

282
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,710
No they aren't.

283
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,190
Ears and tail is fine.

284
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,170
Everything else, that's when you start getting furry.

285
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,250
Hmm.

286
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,370
There's like...

287
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,090
But you like dragons?

288
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,790
It's like a degree.

289
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,970
It's like a spectrum.

290
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,670
Yeah, dragons are sick.

291
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,110
It's like a furry spectrum.

292
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:00,790
Dragon Ds?

293
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:01,850
Spectrum.

294
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,990
You think you're so smart.

295
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,070
You think you're so smart.

296
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,790
What's 25 plus 25, huh?

297
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,460
Shepard, where the fuck is our world code?

298
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,640
It's not a global achievement.

299
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,200
I don't have to laugh.

300
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,580
What's 25 plus 25, huh?

301
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,620
Is that a trick question?

302
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,820
No, it's a math question.

303
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,380
No way.

304
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,780
Nuh uh.

305
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,760
Not gonna trick me into doing math on a Saturday.

306
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,540
Just establish.

307
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,800
Damn.

308
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,660
Alright, I'm joining the lobby.

309
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,660
I'm in the world.

310
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm in the world too.

311
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,600
That's not answering my math question.

312
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,680
Yeah, why didn't you answer his math question?

313
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,540
Are you too stupid?

314
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,500
That's fucked up, Dokie.

315
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,320
What?

316
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
I'm asking a question!

317
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,480
That's fucked up.

318
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,720
That's fucked up.

319
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
I was just asking a question!

320
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,680
That's fucked up.

321
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm just repeating what you said, but like in different... I'm rewording it so I don't please your eyes.

322
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
What the fuck?

323
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,320
What the fuck?

324
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,440
What the fuck?

325
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,780
Oh my god.

326
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,020
Oh my god.

327
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,020
Girl, stop.

328
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,700
Guys, you're supposed to play a video game.

329
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,900
Oh, wait.

330
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,920
They said don't do anything.

331
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,700
We're not actually doing anything.

332
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
We're not allowed to do anything.

333
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,080
But, but, but, like, we're about to get invaded.

334
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,740
Wait, wait, wait, what do we do?

335
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,280
What do we do?

336
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,920
What do we do?

337
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,640
We're gonna get invaded.

338
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,340
We're gonna get invaded.

339
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,580
Tell the admins we're gonna literally get invaded.

340
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,820
We're not gonna get invaded.

341
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,900
We are being invaded.

342
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,380
We are being invaded.

343
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,160
Help!

344
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,060
Help!

345
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,360
We have to fight back.

346
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,060
We can't, we can't really...

347
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,920
It's a... wait, but it's the Tokos!

348
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,700
Close the server.

349
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,820
I know, we need Tokos too.

350
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,240
We already killed them.

351
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,060
Wait, never mind.

352
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,580
They're on their way.

353
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,140
They're on their way.

354
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,260
They said, fuck away.

355
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,740
Close the server.

356
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,180
Oh my god.

357
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,060
Oh shit.

358
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,740
Wait, I thought they said everything was good.

359
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,320
I'm in green balls.

360
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,120
I thought you said once you checked in you can start the server.

361
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,520
Yeah.

362
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,740
I also thought once you checked in...

363
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,860
I thought so too.

364
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,500
They were like, okay, just log in but don't leave.

365
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,040
Like, what?

366
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,580
Server's closed anyways.

367
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,220
Problem solved.

368
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,080
We solved it, guys!

369
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,580
We, we closed.

370
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,520
We closed the server.

371
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,040
Did they check the settings?

372
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,580
Oh no, we're in trouble.

373
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't know, man.

374
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,160
We didn't do anything.

375
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:37,840
We didn't catch the last but not clear.

376
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,520
I thought we were in the green to start.

377
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,540
We were shocked.

378
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,760
Wait, they were like, no, they're giving conflicting information.

379
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,260
The admins don't even know.

380
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,680
Listen, all I'm saying is, he was saying, please wait for our communication.

381
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,880
The last time he didn't told us, we got checked and we started late.

382
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,280
That's all.

383
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,500
And then, but then the person beneath it was like, now if you're being raided, you can fight.

384
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,360
So technically, we don't need to close the server.

385
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,540
Who's right?

386
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,280
Who's the alpha admin?

387
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,880
You're being assaulted.

388
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,460
All right, tell me, now we can start.

389
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,840
Now we can start the world.

390
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,100
Oh, now we can.

391
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,140
Oh, oh, oh.

392
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,420
Okay.

393
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,160
All right.

394
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,400
It's the same code.

395
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,460
Okay, cool.

396
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,580
Yeah, it made a big difference.

397
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,420
No session found, though.

398
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,140
I need the code.

399
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,040
We need the code.

400
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,040
Yeah, no session found because I'm starting it, motherfucker.

401
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,440
Man, now we're late again.

402
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,040
No, we have a set.

403
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,360
No, no, no.

404
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,540
No, we have three minutes left.

405
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,180
Why did I still start?

406
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,540
You don't have timer yet.

407
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,440
We can do it.

408
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,600
We just can't catch them.

409
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
I... chill.

410
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,380
Well, the raid's gone because I power gamed.

411
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,340
Okay, nice.

412
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:38,760
Oh.

413
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,220
Nice.

414
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,740
Is it the same code?

415
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,300
We exploited.

416
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,060
We didn't exploit.

417
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,000
We legally exploited.

418
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,940
I exploited.

419
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,580
Legally.

420
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,280
It's a legal exploit.

421
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a feature.

422
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,500
It was...

423
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,540
Yeah, oh, you're right.

424
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,060
It's a feature.

425
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,520
Well, technically, it was a legal exploit because we illegally started but then legally turned it off.

426
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,020
Wait, so can we join?

427
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,160
Yeah, we can.

428
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,100
Yeah, now we should...

429
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,980
My game crashed.

430
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,680
Move down.

431
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,760
That's karma already?

432
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,680
No way.

433
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,120
Move down.

434
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
We're being punished.

435
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,320
We did it.

436
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,600
We did it.

437
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,620
We did it.

438
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,280
Hey, I just leveled up from doing nothing.

439
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,700
Let's go.

440
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:17,960
Oh, shit.

441
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,440
Let's go.

442
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,440
Okay.

443
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:21,880
All right.

444
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm joining back again.

445
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,660
Don't worry.

446
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,320
Come back in.

447
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,780
Keep telling...

448
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,520
You guys are not allowed to touch anything when you look.

449
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:29,880
Yeah.

450
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,500
We're just here to...

451
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,760
Unless we get raided, then we can kill but not...

452
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,180
Then we can fight.

453
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,940
All right.

454
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,740
I'm back in.

455
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,840
It's okay.

456
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,620
I didn't have my gear.

457
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,880
I hope the Toko's come back.

458
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,980
Oh, boy.

459
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,960
We need them.

460
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,800
Why is everybody...

461
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,040
Wait, everyone is sick.

462
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,340
What did you do to our paths?

463
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,620
Everyone's sick.

464
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,120
They have terrible living conditions.

465
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,500
What happened?

466
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,180
Who the fuck did this to our paths?

467
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,840
What do you mean terrible living conditions?

468
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,440
They have fluffy beds.

469
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,020
Okay, look.

470
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,600
I'm not...

471
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,820
We have two fluffy beds.

472
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,520
I am not...

473
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,720
And no fucking fountain.

474
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,620
I'm not in charge...

475
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,940
I'm not in charge of the power base.

476
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,700
Who the fuck did this to them?

477
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,040
Look.

478
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:06,920
Look.

479
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,560
I was busy.

480
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,960
Dude, our cat fucking bitch is stuck.

481
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,120
Dude, I'm stuck, Kim.

482
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,540
We're not allowed to help her yet.

483
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,000
It's all right.

484
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,340
It's all right.

485
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,020
I'm getting rid of the beds today.

486
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,880
I'll help her.

487
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,400
I'll help her.

488
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,920
We just have to watch her struggle for now.

489
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,360
Our cat just is stuck.

490
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,100
We're unable to do anything legally.

491
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,620
We actually...

492
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,460
We need to make the giant pell bed today.

493
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,260
Really, really quickly.

494
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,500
We need to make the giant pell bed today.

495
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,800
Really, really right after this.

496
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:30,820
All right.

497
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,660
That is your job.

498
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,100
I'm gonna...

499
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,620
We need to figure out what we need.

500
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:33,920
Okay.

501
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,420
We need a Massandra for the breeding and also the...

502
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,760
I mean, you got the Nubus stuff all done, right?

503
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,360
We're good with the Nubus breeding, right?

504
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,260
Probably.

505
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,380
I need to check gender.

506
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,260
All right.

507
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,580
And then we just need a Massandra.

508
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,840
I have a male Pen King.

509
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,340
I have a female Bushi, but I need a male Pen King.

510
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,340
I have a male Pen King.

511
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,140
That's the problem.

512
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm gonna get the Nubus.

513
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,020
We got it.

514
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,260
Yeah.

515
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,420
I caught one from the boss.

516
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,020
I'm pretty sure he's a guy.

517
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,460
I need the bee.

518
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,540
I need the bee.

519
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:04,880
Yeah.

520
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,660
I can put that in too.

521
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,520
So we can get some honey.

522
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,800
I'll put the bee and the Pen King in the thing.

523
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,800
Who do I take out though?

524
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,300
Does anybody have the cow as well?

525
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,080
I have a cow.

526
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,620
Oh, then we can put that in too.

527
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,800
Oh yeah.

528
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,540
I've got a cow as well.

529
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:17,740
Where's the fucking...

530
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,020
Where was the...

531
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,880
The doc, the Google...

532
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,340
Doc posting again?

533
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,800
Oh, let me give it to you.

534
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
He's like resending it.

535
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,600
Wait, are you talking about for the...

536
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,560
Which Google doc?

537
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,140
The achievement?

538
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,480
Which one?

539
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,940
Resend or...

540
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,360
Okay.

541
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,400
I can give you that.

542
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,640
Yay.

543
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,340
You can start.

544
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,800
Okay.

545
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,900
We can start now.

546
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,040
We can start.

547
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,320
Yay.

548
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,740
Let's go.

549
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,920
I can put...

550
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,020
I have a cow.

551
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,260
Just take out whatever you don't need and I'll fill a slot with the cow.

552
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:43,720
Okay.

553
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,120
I'm putting in my male Pen King.

554
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,520
Wait, I've got a cow.

555
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,360
I'll just throw the cow in.

556
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,180
Okay.

557
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:47,560
Perfect.

558
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,280
All right.

559
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,980
Where the fuck did I put the penguin?

560
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,580
We also need to get tomato seeds, lettuce seeds, and I think we probably already have wheat seeds.

561
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,260
I'm getting rid of the...

562
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,520
Do I get rid of the chick monk?

563
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,460
Which one do I get rid of?

564
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,860
Which one do I get rid of?

565
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,280
Chipmunk is worthless.

566
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:02,980
You can get rid of it.

567
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,200
Okay.

568
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,260
And then I'll put in the G-Guard.

569
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,300
Where the fuck is this fucker?

570
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,620
I don't know.

571
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:10,760
I caught you.

572
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,300
Well, they're like sleeping.

573
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,180
So they're like trying to move in.

574
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,300
Wait.

575
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,480
Who do you want me to get rid of?

576
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,020
I don't know which one to get rid of.

577
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,320
Oh my god.

578
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,640
We can get rid of the cat.

579
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,540
Cat-tiva or whatever.

580
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:18,640
Yeah.

581
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:18,880
I got it.

582
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,580
Put it in.

583
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:19,960
Okay.

584
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,360
All right.

585
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,480
Let me fix my stuff.

586
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,720
All right.

587
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,480
Once it's daytime...

588
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
I need the Google Doc.

589
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,540
I put it in the chat.

590
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,920
Oh, nice.

591
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,220
Yeah.

592
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,180
I'm freezing to death.

593
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,360
My loot is in Brazil.

594
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,820
Oh shit.

595
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Welcome to Brazil.

596
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,280
I died at the fucking ball as soon.

597
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:45,700
Okay.

598
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,840
I'm gonna put all this stuff away.

599
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,420
Let's see.

600
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,720
Actually, I think it's worth getting.

601
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,640
Did I have anything?

602
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,340
No.

603
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,100
Oh yeah.

604
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,060
Remember to make more furnaces.

605
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,500
We need to make more furnaces.

606
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,700
See.

607
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,200
I'm about to just make a bunch of furnaces.

608
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,680
I'm gonna make a bunch of iron on this island over here.

609
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,600
I'm stealing this ball.

610
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,320
Thank you.

611
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,180
I have a lot of mats if people want.

612
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,600
I'm gonna make another chest to put these mats in.

613
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:18,460
I think I'm gonna make a chest to sort stuff a bit more efficiently because it'll take so much time to go through all the chests.

614
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,480
Let's see.

615
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,560
So I'm gonna redo the chest just real quick.

616
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:22,860
Oh, I have three honey.

617
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,180
If anyone wants honey, I put the ice organs too.

618
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,820
Aight.

619
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,420
And then...

620
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,380
Yeah, if you want to resort stuff, you can.

621
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,200
What the fuck?

622
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:39,860
Half the reason they're getting trapped is because the... this like piece of... like this cliff we're on is made out of this stone that they can fall through.

623
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,280
No.

624
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,860
What the fuck?

625
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,700
You're so fucking stupid.

626
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,100
No, it's not our fault.

627
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,300
They're pretty... it's just our pals are pretty stupid.

628
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,700
It's not our fault.

629
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,800
I'll sell your...

630
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,500
Alright, I'm just gonna set it over here.

631
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,260
Alright, let's see.

632
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,040
I have to do...

633
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,800
This chest here.

634
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,120
I have to do...

635
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,780
What do I have to do again?

636
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,140
Alright, I'm gonna go start killing some pals.

637
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,220
I'm just gonna try to put them further apart so that they don't get stuck on each other.

638
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,980
Okay, I make one big chest which is just like common materials.

639
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,680
So whenever you come to the base real quick, you can just dump all your like common shit in there.

640
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,240
Alright, I'm gonna get the matsurina meat for us.

641
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,100
And then...

642
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,560
Okay, it should have enough storage for everything dumpable.

643
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,400
Okay, I'm gonna try to get this shit off the...

644
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,900
I should get a massandra right now for us actually.

645
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,140
I feel like that'd be the easiest.

646
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,800
Cause we need a massandra.

647
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,100
Alright, I need to grab this bee.

648
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,420
Okay.

649
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,880
Alright, let's go.

650
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,880
Alright, put the bee in the right pouch.

651
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,680
We fly.

652
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,980
We fly.

653
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,960
Where am I?

654
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,340
I went the wrong way again.

655
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,400
We fly.

656
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,020
Massandra.

657
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,640
I'm coming over.

658
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,380
We fly.

659
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,160
We only need for the rest of the base building.

660
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,780
Hold on, let me take a look.

661
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,340
We only actually need...

662
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:03,880
Uh...

663
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,380
Okay, we still need 250 ingot.

664
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,800
But once we get 250 ingot, after that it all just becomes refined ingot.

665
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,520
So we need to stop making like a crap ton unless we need it for other things.

666
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,320
Oh, we need the ingots for the balls.

667
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,620
Yeah, balls.

668
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,480
So I guess we'll just keep trying to make that.

669
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,220
Yeah, I feel like we have to because we need the balls.

670
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,160
Alright.

671
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,200
Where am I?

672
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,380
I need 300...

673
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,260
380 ore.

674
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,940
I need 300 ore for the refined ones for the base.

675
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,080
Stop building!

676
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,660
I'll just start stealing some.

677
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:32,980
Just make more furnaces.

678
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Just make more furnaces.

679
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,100
Get over here.

680
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:35,760
Okay.

681
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,920
I'm about to make a lot of ore over here.

682
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,740
Nice.

683
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,000
That's what we need.

684
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,860
Okay, I need to go set up the coal base.

685
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,780
So I'll go do that.

686
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
What gender do we need for the Massandra?

687
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,180
Um, Massandra?

688
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,600
What is the petal one?

689
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,320
What is...

690
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,020
What gender is that one?

691
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,700
Do you know what the petalia that you caught?

692
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,480
What was the gender of it?

693
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:54,840
Female.

694
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,580
Female?

695
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:55,760
Male.

696
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:55,940
Male.

697
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,660
Okay, I'll catch a male.

698
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,640
Okay.

699
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,760
Alright.

700
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,080
I don't know if I...

701
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,980
My game crashed.

702
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,500
Why is it crashing?

703
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,280
It's handicapping us.

704
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,560
What the fuck?

705
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,080
Let me back in.

706
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,060
Guys, I think I might need a new PC.

707
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,300
Probably wait a bit because the coal base is solid so just make a bunch of iron over here maybe.

708
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,420
Bip.

709
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,240
Please.

710
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,420
I was just wondering.

711
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,440
Or you can mine a bunch of iron over here.

712
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:27,500
Bip.

713
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,320
Just a bunch of iron over here.

714
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,460
Chat, you heard him.

715
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,100
They need a new PC.

716
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,280
Get on it.

717
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,060
Hold it here first.

718
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,480
New PC.

719
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,720
Get on it.

720
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,340
Top top.

721
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,160
I've got a 4080.

722
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,700
Why does this keep happening?

723
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,620
Maybe it's too good.

724
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,440
It's too good.

725
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:42,820
You're right.

726
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,640
It's just too good of a PC.

727
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,140
You know what I mean?

728
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,140
Nah, what the fuck?

729
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,720
You can't do this.

730
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,320
Wait, where...

731
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,520
Where is the cow?

732
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,440
You put it out.

733
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't see it.

734
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,740
I'm just gonna respawn it.

735
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,680
He's somewhere.

736
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,500
Oh, I think this bails that they always walk like a weirdo.

737
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,720
It's a really weird path and they're like five bases ahead.

738
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,260
They're just walking into nothing.

739
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,700
They're like, goodbye, it's time to Brazil.

740
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,320
Our base is just too fucking good, you know?

741
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,320
Like, where is she going?

742
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,260
Or...

743
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,700
But it's, yeah, the PALs just need better walk cycles.

744
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Sounds like a PAL problem.

745
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,160
Come on.

746
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,660
Pal, you heard that?

747
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,480
It's not our fault, it's your fault.

748
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,180
By the way, thanks for sponsoring this tournament, by the way.

749
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,020
Love the game though, keep at it.

750
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,300
Love the game, but...

751
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,720
Love the game, but anyway, it's your fault.

752
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,780
Okay, well I took the beds off the rock for the most part, so they should not get stuck in the rock.

753
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,360
Okay, there's two, there's a male and a female.

754
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,860
That'll help at least a little bit.

755
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,760
But we'll kill...

756
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,820
Oh my goodness, why is he stuck up there?

757
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,480
My eight arrows.

758
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,380
You can do this.

759
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,400
My eight arrows.

760
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,300
Go, Vanu.

761
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,700
Go.

762
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
What are we using the boar for?

763
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,460
I think he's mining.

764
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,120
The miners?

765
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,680
Okay, upgrading base.

766
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,260
That's the female, we don't care about the female.

767
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,380
Oh God, please.

768
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:11,660
Alright.

769
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Who is a builder who can build?

770
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,080
Alright, this is gonna be rough... NO, GWIRRAK!

771
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,240
Leave me alone!

772
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,420
Okay, I got...

773
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,880
I got the whole thing.

774
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,860
I got Mildessandra!

775
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,400
We basically have what we needed for the other breeding.

776
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,540
Alright, I want to set up the breeding before... oh wait, shit.

777
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,220
We need to make the cake.

778
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,880
Alright, for the cake...

779
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,880
For the cake, I need flour, I need berries, I need milk, and I need egg.

780
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,200
Alright, we need egg.

781
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,100
Does anybody have any eggs on them?

782
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,160
Yeah, I put a lot of eggs in the chest.

783
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,160
Nice.

784
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,280
Alright, I'm gonna grab egg.

785
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,340
I think so.

786
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,580
I trust.

787
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,360
There's something in there.

788
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,460
If there's no eggs, we can just kill some chickens.

789
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,460
Yeah, we can kill chickens or I can throw one in the ranch, maybe.

790
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,660
Alright, I need to find a...

791
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,980
Hey, Vy.

792
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,980
What the fuck are you doing over here?

793
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,260
I have... I caught a misandra, so you can breed it at any time you want.

794
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,540
Nice.

795
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,800
Let it have a good time.

796
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,180
Oh yeah, sure.

797
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,340
Remember to put a petalia in the base whenever you have time.

798
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,480
I'm using her right now.

799
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,280
What?

800
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,560
Why you gotta say it like that?

801
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,740
What are you using her for?

802
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,520
She's in my party.

803
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,220
Mm-hmm.

804
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,020
What is her purpose in your party?

805
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
To breed.

806
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
To breed.

807
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,520
To breed.

808
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,700
Where the fuck is she?

809
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,960
It's a fast travel.

810
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:15,540
No, it's this one.

811
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,480
It was one.

812
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:24,380
Okay, I'll make a barrel at the base and that barrel will have the spears all the time.

813
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:24,820
Alright, yeah.

814
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,760
I need some Giga Spears right now.

815
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,240
Can we make a conveyor belt already?

816
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,000
I think we need circuit boards for that though.

817
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,280
I think we can.

818
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,760
Yeah, we just...

819
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,440
If we can build a...

820
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,460
If we can build a...

821
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,100
Oh, we have a...

822
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,520
Oh yeah, we need to make the power generator.

823
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,580
Yeah, we need circuit boards.

824
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:38,920
Yeah.

825
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,500
Like right away.

826
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,140
Yeah, I think we're all at the level to make them.

827
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,280
Yeah, we just... we need the quartz.

828
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,740
That's literally it.

829
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,000
What's the dungeon we need to do?

830
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Mountain Stream Grotto?

831
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,940
Do we need that?

832
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,060
I'm gonna check.

833
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,200
Mountain...

834
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,640
Oh no, no we don't.

835
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,200
It's sacred.

836
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,600
We need the...

837
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,800
Nah, check.

838
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,960
Dunes, Volcanic and Sacred Mountain.

839
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,780
Yeah, I just checked it's not this one.

840
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,420
Alright.

841
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,440
We need... I need more Giga Spears right now.

842
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,560
I only have four.

843
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,700
I'm just gonna go build the coal base.

844
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,820
I only have four, Lily.

845
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,140
Where are my fire pelts?

846
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,160
Where are my balls, Lily?

847
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,480
Oh, here.

848
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,280
Here are some balls.

849
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,380
In the... in the... what is it called?

850
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:23,960
The barrel.

851
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,000
In the middle of the base.

852
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,480
Okay.

853
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,460
I'll steal this one too from...

854
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,020
Yeah.

855
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,360
Nice.

856
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,140
He's trying his best to make more.

857
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,640
I'm gonna steal it right now.

858
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,360
I just need more ingots and then I can start making more.

859
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,860
Alright, that should be enough for now.

860
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,800
Where are the other fire pelts?

861
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,320
Oh my god, bro!

862
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,380
Where are they?

863
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,880
Alright, do you want me to put the Massandra in now or later?

864
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,580
Into the breeding?

865
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,620
We don't have cake yet.

866
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,860
Yeah, but do you want me to just put it in... put it in there for now?

867
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,320
I'm gonna replace the dino one since...

868
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,080
Yeah, I can grab it and set it in my...

869
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,600
Yeah, I put it in.

870
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,860
I replaced the dino just in case.

871
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,220
Okay, cool.

872
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,480
I'm gonna do the faction tower now.

873
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,660
I'm gonna do the tower.

874
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,540
Yeah, I wanna start breeding but we don't have cake, so...

875
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,280
How do we make cake?

876
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,620
You need honey and milk and egg.

877
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,220
Oh, eggs?

878
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,420
I can give you guys eggs now.

879
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,560
Yeah, you're just missing eggs, right?

880
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,400
Yeah, I'm just... well, I'm missing honey.

881
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,880
The bee will not stay in the ranch for some reason.

882
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,700
Just chuck him in.

883
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,340
I got some honey.

884
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,480
I'll take honey if you got it.

885
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,080
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna kill some chickens real quick.

886
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm gonna go build the coal base.

887
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Hello little chicken.

888
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,760
Do you need to research cement?

889
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,740
Cement?

890
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,900
Cement is made out of bone, pal fluid, and stone, I think.

891
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,200
Do you need to research it?

892
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,820
It's one of the things, yeah.

893
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,100
I can't see it in the tech tree.

894
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,300
Maybe I'm blind.

895
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,500
It should be...

896
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,200
Let me see.

897
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,520
I don't want to just need insta-kill.

898
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,220
I'm gonna go ride my...

899
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,020
Cement is level 19.

900
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,920
Yeah, you guys should be able to.

901
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,780
Also, we have stone structures now as well.

902
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,820
Chicken, where are you, chicken?

903
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,720
I'm gonna kill you.

904
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,920
Stop eating!

905
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,060
Go back to work!

906
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,080
Stop eating!

907
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,340
You can't eat when you have worked for it!

908
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,300
Yeah, that's right.

909
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,760
You didn't earn the food.

910
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
You didn't earn the food yet.

911
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:20,940
Yeah.

912
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,580
You heard her.

913
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,420
You can eat when you die.

914
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:24,860
I'm starving too.

915
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,740
Fuck, fuck, wait, I'm also starving, man.

916
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,900
I'm saying that you gotta preach it.

917
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,760
I earned it, surely.

918
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,260
What did you do?

919
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,340
Oh, wait, can somebody give me... do we have all the tombats out right now?

920
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,540
I want to take one to the new base.

921
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,520
I have two of it, yeah.

922
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,780
Okay, can you put another one on base?

923
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,620
I'll just take this one.

924
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,820
Yeah, I can.

925
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,600
I just need a...

926
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,520
I can fucking pick up... no, you're hungry!

927
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,000
Why are you hungry?

928
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,500
You can starve when I tell you to.

929
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,720
Stop starving!

930
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,280
Stop starving now!

931
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,040
Stop it!

932
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,640
I need water, pals.

933
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,000
I can give you some water, pals, if you need it.

934
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,520
Sorry, I'll throw it.

935
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:11,940
Surf it.

936
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,780
Alright, I got 16 eggs.

937
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,680
I'm putting the eggs in the...

938
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll put the eggs in the chest.

939
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,020
You should have enough now, right?

940
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,860
With the eggs?

941
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,300
Unless you're missing something?

942
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,480
We still need honey, but maybe...

943
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,580
We have a lot of honey.

944
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,500
Like, I put some honey, too, in the chest.

945
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,100
Wait, where's the honey?

946
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,420
In one of the chests.

947
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,560
I put like three, at least three in there.

948
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,200
What do you mean?

949
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,180
I'll take a look.

950
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,570
You have no permission to start.

951
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,910
What a guy.

952
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,570
What a guy.

953
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,020
What?

954
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,460
Alright, I am...

955
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,100
Stop it!

956
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,420
Yeah, there's three honey at least in there.

957
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,160
And there's six... there's 43 eggs, too.

958
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,500
Work.

959
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,900
Okay, okay.

960
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,780
Then I can probably cook.

961
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,860
Make sure you're using the Jormuntide Ignis for smelting.

962
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,460
What the fuck?

963
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,160
Oh, yeah.

964
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,680
We have the Instagram just doing it right now.

965
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,460
Uh... let's see.

966
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:14,860
Oh, yeah.

967
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,420
I'm gonna go do the...

968
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,460
I'm gonna go do the faction tower.

969
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,760
For real this time.

970
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,900
Aight, good luck.

971
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,580
Alright, let's make a mill.

972
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,420
You should put the...

973
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:27,760
What?

974
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,140
You're not gonna use the egg right away.

975
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,880
You should put it in the cooler.

976
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,460
Yes.

977
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,600
Cause the eggs are... the...

978
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,680
Oh.

979
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,780
The eggs is in the...

980
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,040
It's...

981
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,400
Oh, fuck.

982
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,320
I forgot to get the arrows.

983
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,860
It is in the chest.

984
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,760
The three chests.

985
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
That's like on the cliff.

986
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,300
It's in one of them.

987
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,700
Oh, over here.

988
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:48,940
Okay.

989
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,420
Cool.

990
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,540
Yeah.

991
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,420
I don't think you... you don't have to take it out.

992
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,040
Let me see if I can actually already just make the cake.

993
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,880
You don't have to take the materials out.

994
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,660
We need milk.

995
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,400
I gotta make flour.

996
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:57,900
Okay.

997
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,360
I'll make the milk.

998
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,340
Any extra arrows?

999
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:01,880
Anywhere?

1000
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,600
On the bench.

1001
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,120
There's 363.

1002
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,360
We should have loads of arrows there.

1003
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,300
I'm gonna... I'm... oink.

1004
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,540
Mine.

1005
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,740
It's mine now.

1006
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,820
I moved the...

1007
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,280
The chest.

1008
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:12,700
Alright.

1009
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,020
Get the tower.

1010
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,640
Get ready to clip this when I defeat this tower.

1011
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,020
Also remember to yell clip it, clip it when we...

1012
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,140
Shufar, remember to yell clip it, clip it!

1013
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,740
So we remember to clip it.

1014
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,700
Clip this.

1015
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,600
Thank you... wait.

1016
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,700
Shoutout to my mods.

1017
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,840
Thank you so much for clipping everything yesterday.

1018
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
You're the realist.

1019
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,820
Hell yeah.

1020
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,000
Alright, let me in them.

1021
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,240
They now have a nickname thanks to Doki Juno.

1022
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,560
They're now called the peepee mods.

1023
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,220
The peepee mods?

1024
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,460
Which sounds like something that should be outlawed everywhere but Florida, but you know, it's fine.

1025
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,460
Alright, here we go.

1026
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,640
I can kill this guy.

1027
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,760
He's like fucking...

1028
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,320
What level is he?

1029
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,660
I'm gonna reset these.

1030
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,820
Go, Vang!

1031
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,420
Awww.

1032
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,180
They should probably run into less shit now.

1033
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,800
Oh no, please leave me alone.

1034
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,680
I need an open line.

1035
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,460
Nooo.

1036
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,060
Wait, where are the wood and the palladium?

1037
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,420
Ow, girl!

1038
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,100
What the... stop!

1039
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,660
I'm killing the faction.

1040
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,420
Zoe and Grif...

1041
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,360
What level is this?

1042
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,660
What level is the second tower, boss?

1043
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,480
You guys know?

1044
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,060
30?

1045
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,860
Okay, so yeah, I haven't done that.

1046
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,260
I only got to the first one.

1047
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,280
Yeah, that's the first one and I just put down the fucking mechanic.

1048
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,300
I'm like, I'm done.

1049
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,020
I'm good.

1050
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,600
Damn!

1051
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,000
I was like, okay, that was it.

1052
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,160
I played three days non-stop and then I was like, I'm good.

1053
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm good to go.

1054
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,480
I feel like the bosses just aren't like as worth it in this game.

1055
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,660
Yeah, I don't know.

1056
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,040
Compared to similar games that we won't name.

1057
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,760
I think it's just because like... I guess it's like Dark Souls-esque too.

1058
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,740
So it's like...

1059
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,040
Yeah.

1060
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,860
But like, it's not as rewarding to kill them.

1061
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,640
Yeah.

1062
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,320
Oh!

1063
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,400
Another thing.

1064
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,380
If you see any electric that's like large electric eggs, that's another way to get Grisbolt.

1065
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,580
That is like less of a hassle if anybody has any.

1066
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:13,840
I have.

1067
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,460
I don't have one.

1068
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,320
Alright.

1069
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,480
Well, if you guys see any priority on that one.

1070
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,600
Okay.

1071
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,540
Uh, mill.

1072
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,540
No, don't kill me.

1073
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,160
Okay.

1074
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,140
Bat Worm, please!

1075
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:28,820
Stop!

1076
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,720
Oh my god.

1077
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,520
My Bat Worm got stuck.

1078
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm gonna be down.

1079
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,820
Maybe I should not use a Bat Worm.

1080
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,660
Maybe I should use a sweeper.

1081
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,260
Fuck.

1082
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,060
Oh, why are you hungry?

1083
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,640
You're not allowed to starve.

1084
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,700
Stop starving!

1085
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,700
Stop starving!

1086
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,560
I didn't tell you.

1087
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,460
Wait, where did Lutmon go?

1088
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:50,900
Hello?

1089
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,760
My flower!

1090
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,000
Stop building!

1091
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,420
Get the fuck back here!

1092
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,040
These fucking pals!

1093
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,960
These pals of Goldcraft Ball!

1094
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,480
These fucking pals.

1095
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,780
Fuck!

1096
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,260
Wait, I've got a new snake bar.

1097
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,100
What did I not pay?

1098
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,240
This is not what I paid you for because you're not getting paid in general.

1099
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,340
Yeah, you don't really get paid but...

1100
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,600
You're allowed to survive if you make balls.

1101
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,400
Yeah.

1102
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,760
Earn your food.

1103
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,180
Your use to me is your ball production.

1104
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,660
Don't worry, they're gonna be able to make balls faster in a second.

1105
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,140
Oh yeah, the assembly line.

1106
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,200
Let's go!

1107
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,060
Finally!

1108
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,980
Assembly line.

1109
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,800
Clip this!

1110
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,540
Clip, clip, clip, clip!

1111
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,280
Boss eliminated!

1112
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,480
Clip, clip, clip!

1113
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,260
Let's go!

1114
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,820
Clip, clip, clip!

1115
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,520
Clip, clip, clip!

1116
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,660
Clip, clip, clip!

1117
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,540
Clip, clip, clip!

1118
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,960
I need a bunch of balls.

1119
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,540
We all do.

1120
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,640
We're on it.

1121
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,520
We all need balls.

1122
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,100
We're on it.

1123
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,340
Alright, what do I... okay, let's see.

1124
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,320
What else do we need?

1125
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,240
Let's see.

1126
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,920
I can try and catch a Greyhound.

1127
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,820
You can't catch a Grizzbolt, right?

1128
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,300
Unless we go to the Sanctuary.

1129
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,300
Right?

1130
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,580
Can you catch a Grizzbolt?

1131
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,860
I have no idea either.

1132
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,600
Yeah, we need a Grizzbolt.

1133
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,200
Yeah, but can we catch a Grizzbolt?

1134
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,380
From the Sanctuary?

1135
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:13,720
Yes.

1136
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,260
Yes?

1137
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,520
But I don't know what level the Sanctuary is.

1138
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,020
Okay, I'm just gonna go to the desert and catch a Hound.

1139
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,440
I need pallium fragments.

1140
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,200
Hold up.

1141
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,340
That should have helped the flow around here.

1142
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,220
How much rock do we have?

1143
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,600
There's a way to easily get pallium fragments.

1144
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:30,900
Not much.

1145
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,840
Oh yeah, with the Crusher.

1146
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,120
Yeah.

1147
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,880
Oh, now with Crusher?

1148
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,640
You go to the Rain Syndicate Tower.

1149
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,580
And then you just teleport to the cave.

1150
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,700
And there's big ore nodes in there.

1151
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,120
Oh!

1152
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,760
Okay.

1153
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,520
And in every cave there's pallium.

1154
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,140
Oh yeah, yeah.

1155
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,980
So we just find a dungeon, right?

1156
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah.

1157
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,500
Yep.

1158
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,520
Alright, let's see.

1159
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,080
What do I need to do now?

1160
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,620
I got one of the towers done.

1161
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,520
I'm not leveled up for the medium bosses yet.

1162
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,480
Let's see.

1163
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,960
What levels are the Marketeers?

1164
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,460
The lowest level one I know is 40.

1165
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,140
40?

1166
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,740
Okay, I'm not in range for that yet.

1167
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,580
I'm gonna get heat resistant armor and catch a Ray Hound for us.

1168
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,200
Ummm...

1169
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,800
Okay, I don't have the crafting yet for that.

1170
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:29,860
Let's see.

1171
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,900
Where are you?

1172
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,000
Heat resistant pelt armor.

1173
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,320
Let's get the cold resistant pelt armor.

1174
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:38,900
Okay.

1175
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,560
Uhhh... I need more ingots.

1176
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,720
Where... I'm gonna help bring my Van Worm here.

1177
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,120
Van Worm!

1178
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,860
Ingots now!

1179
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,920
Ingots!

1180
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,380
Catch!

1181
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,300
Go, go Van Worm!

1182
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,880
Okay, my Van Worm is doing ingots.

1183
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,960
Because I need that shit.

1184
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,620
I'll farm some ore for us too.

1185
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,000
Uh, now that we have the...

1186
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,720
Just the assembly line, do we still need the sphere wrench?

1187
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,340
I don't think we do, no.

1188
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,460
Don't think so, no.

1189
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,940
Alright, then I'll just nuke it.

1190
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,840
Okay.

1191
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,540
Alright, cool.

1192
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,920
I just need my... I need like 40 ingots so I can make the heat resistant armor.

1193
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,180
Thank you, Pen King.

1194
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,040
Thank you, Pen King for the flower.

1195
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,160
I think I just need to go collect milk now.

1196
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,600
And we have enough for a cake.

1197
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,760
I was hoping we have everything we need.

1198
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,940
Our pals need like...

1199
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,680
Like four more beds by the way.

1200
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,180
Why do we have beds for them?

1201
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,000
If they have those bags, they won't sleep and they won't work that easy.

1202
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,400
Guys!

1203
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,380
One has ulcer!

1204
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,180
What are you doing to our pals?

1205
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,340
No!

1206
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,580
No time to cure the ulcer.

1207
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,340
We can replace them.

1208
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,900
You replace the world, manage your ulcer yourself.

1209
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:05,460
Yeah.

1210
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,560
Our comfy does not cover medical costs.

1211
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,380
No insurance.

1212
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,180
This is a North America tournament, baby.

1213
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,020
I feel like a North American tournament does cover for medical costs.

1214
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,100
Maybe half.

1215
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,200
Maybe half.

1216
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,280
If you're lucky.

1217
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,280
Where the fuck is the repair box?

1218
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,140
Do we have any medicine?

1219
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,140
No, we don't even have a medicine bar.

1220
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,080
Oh wait, I have some medicine.

1221
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,660
Hold on, wait a minute.

1222
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:38,860
Let's see.

1223
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,740
I'm trying to put away...

1224
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,160
I'm putting away...

1225
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,440
Mining away.

1226
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,060
I don't know what's left of mine.

1227
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,300
I mine it anyways.

1228
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,060
Minecraft world, so beautiful.

1229
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,120
Nice.

1230
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,820
That was beautiful, guys.

1231
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,760
Mine diamonds!

1232
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,320
What will you do a karaoke stream, Sheriff War?

1233
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,740
You have the voice for it.

1234
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,740
I wonder if I feel like it.

1235
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,880
I want you to give your Chad karaoke.

1236
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,140
I need to find a way to give reverb on my voice.

1237
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,220
That's how you sound nice.

1238
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,140
You can do...

1239
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,820
Oh shit, nevermind, I can't do this.

1240
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,460
Yeah!

1241
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,040
It's easy.

1242
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,440
I can't do that.

1243
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,560
It's so... just get a GoXLR.

1244
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,240
Easy.

1245
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:34,640
Last time I got a GoXLR, I plugged that shit in and downloaded the software and nothing worked and I was too lazy so I gave up.

1246
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,560
What?

1247
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,040
What do you mean nothing worked?

1248
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,900
I don't know, I was pressing buttons, there's no thing, I don't know how to make the noises.

1249
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,560
There's no thang.

1250
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,560
There's no thang.

1251
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,280
There's no thang.

1252
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,080
No thang, just sticking out.

1253
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,340
Just watch a YouTube tutorial.

1254
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,400
Yo, they won't tell me shit.

1255
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,140
In the solution to our fox having an ulcer, I replaced him with a different fox.

1256
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,580
Nice.

1257
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,140
We don't need him anyway.

1258
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,080
Medical care?

1259
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,980
No thank you.

1260
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,700
No, we just replaced him.

1261
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,220
Holy fuck.

1262
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,580
It's okay, we'll get a scab.

1263
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,760
Is that it?

1264
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,960
Man, I love capitalism simulator.

1265
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,780
This is my favorite game.

1266
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,300
Welcome to capitalism.

1267
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
Scabs are allowed in this company.

1268
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,180
Jesus Christ.

1269
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,080
I've been mining this whole time.

1270
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,320
I thought you were supposed to power level.

1271
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,560
Yeah, I need balls for that.

1272
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,360
I'm trying.

1273
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm gonna try to collect a bunch of shit.

1274
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,020
I'm heading to catch a Ryehound now.

1275
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,600
Oh sick, we got another Bushi.

1276
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,160
Alright, come over here, it's Ryehound time.

1277
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,040
Am I heading the right way?

1278
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,060
Does anybody have any eggs?

1279
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,880
The incubator is empty.

1280
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,860
Nope, not on me.

1281
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,560
There might be one in the chest.

1282
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,160
Oh yeah, we don't have electricity, so we can't make balls anymore.

1283
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,020
We can have electricity already.

1284
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,620
I can make one right now.

1285
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,280
Yeah.

1286
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,100
Hell yeah, brother.

1287
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,780
Oh wait, no, we need 100 ingot.

1288
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,500
50 ingot, that's what I was waiting for.

1289
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,200
Oh shit.

1290
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,060
Yeah.

1291
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,720
We need it though, so...

1292
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,960
Just make more furnaces.

1293
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,020
That's our only answer.

1294
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,220
Make more.

1295
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,740
We don't even have enough firepower to kill him.

1296
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,980
Take care of the furnace and make more.

1297
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,180
Should we?

1298
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,200
We should...

1299
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,820
Ah, no, it's kind of a waste of mats.

1300
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,060
I was gonna say, we can make the better furnace, but we might as well just wait until we can make the electric furnace.

1301
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,940
We should like...

1302
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,900
How much are we from leveling up the base?

1303
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,120
What do we need for base level?

1304
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,060
Right now for base level up...

1305
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,040
Give me a second.

1306
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,260
We need the power generator, so we need... I'm just waiting on the ingot.

1307
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:43,780
Okay.

1308
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,760
So if we can hold off on balls for a second, I just need to...

1309
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,120
I need 50 ingots.

1310
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,920
Dude, I sure for we need 50 ingots.

1311
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,360
I need the balls.

1312
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,260
I need the balls.

1313
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,720
I can't level right now.

1314
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,420
You're gonna have to kill everything.

1315
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,400
Where the fuck are the...

1316
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,240
Captain, what about my balls?

1317
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:01,800
...ryhounds?

1318
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,280
I have a heat resistant armor now.

1319
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,500
I just need to find...

1320
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,160
Make ingots.

1321
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,140
...the ryhounds.

1322
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,840
Rhyhounds, where are you?

1323
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,760
Uh, is the wheat ready yet?

1324
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,360
Yes!

1325
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,900
Cool, okay, I can start breeding.

1326
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,460
What are you trying to make with the ingots?

1327
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,020
Uh, I need to make the power generator.

1328
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,900
So I need 50.

1329
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,720
I don't know if I need to go for it yet.

1330
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,360
I have 41.

1331
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,820
I think we need more mining pals.

1332
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,040
We're kinda behind on rock and stuff.

1333
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:34,960
Yeah, agree.

1334
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,000
I think you have to mine it yourself at this point.

1335
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,200
It would be really good...

1336
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,840
The mining pals don't dig, like, at all.

1337
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,540
They're like losers.

1338
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,900
If we can get the dig toys, can't we do the...

1339
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,120
If we can get the dig toys, we need to catch them in the desert.

1340
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,700
Isn't dig toys still bugged?

1341
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,960
They're bugged?

1342
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,780
Every mining pal is bugged.

1343
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,300
They don't fucking work.

1344
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,260
I thought they were a turtle.

1345
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,020
Fuck's sake, Matt!

1346
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,750
Oh yeah, everybody in my chat says, dig toy's bad.

1347
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:10,310
Okay.

1348
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,230
Yeah, it's super buggy right now.

1349
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,150
Dig toys is good if you use it yourself.

1350
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,810
Yeah, yeah, but not as like a mine thing.

1351
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,970
Well, no pal is good at mining.

1352
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:19,630
Like...

1353
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,210
Yeah, it's just... they're all bugged in general.

1354
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,110
Trying to make auto farms is useless right now in this game.

1355
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,030
I made one with like a different mining pal.

1356
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,230
It works so well.

1357
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:35,230
Like, it doesn't respawn fast enough for them to have much to do.

1358
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,530
What, you actually got your pals to collect all the shit?

1359
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,630
Yeah, like, it works flawless.

1360
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:41,630
I have so much iron.

1361
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:41,910
It's just the EU div.

1362
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,890
It's the EU div?

1363
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:44,650
It's the EU div.

1364
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,590
We should have had our servers in EU div.

1365
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,490
You guys, it would have worked.

1366
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:57,490
Whenever I had my pals trying to collect stuff, they would just pick it up, drop it, pick it up, drop it, and there'd just be giant piles everywhere.

1367
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,390
I think it just depends on how your base is set up too.

1368
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:04,130
Because I've had problems with pals picking up my shit.

1369
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,470
Because also I did...

1370
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,610
I made a very specific base to... yeah, avoid all the pathing issues.

1371
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:15,250
Like, I built like walls and pathways and stuff specifically so that I can path easier.

1372
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:15,990
Cake!

1373
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,050
Alright, we made our first cake.

1374
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,270
Now, breed.

1375
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,410
I guess we'll start with Anubis, because he's the most useful for the base.

1376
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,010
I'm heading over to... Can Anubis mine?

1377
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,510
Anubis can do handiwork.

1378
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,770
And then you can replace the breeding pals too, because some of them are useless anyway.

1379
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,100
I'm heading over to this waypoint.

1380
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,780
Where the fuck is the Ryehound?

1381
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,120
I need a female Ryehound, right?

1382
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,520
Because we have a male Massandra.

1383
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,280
Yeah, if we're gonna make Grisbold that way.

1384
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,040
Yeah, I can't find him.

1385
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,360
Oh, I made the electric thing.

1386
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,980
Oh, you made it already?

1387
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,380
Nice.

1388
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:00,920
Okay, cool.

1389
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,880
Now I just need a pal that can power it.

1390
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,540
Oh wait, you made it?

1391
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,820
Is it being built?

1392
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,700
Okay, okay.

1393
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,140
Thanks.

1394
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,280
I'm trying to find the Ryehound wherever you are.

1395
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,260
Wait, Anubis also has mining?

1396
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,760
We might wanna consider making mine.

1397
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,160
Yeah.

1398
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,560
Just to get the mining under control.

1399
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,740
Because it slows down the ball production a ton.

1400
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,480
I have to just mine manually the whole time.

1401
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:37,740
I'm just trying to find our little dog in this sad world out here.

1402
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,040
Yeah, I feel like the base being 50% Anubis is actually the play.

1403
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,340
Yeah, honestly.

1404
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,400
We just breed a couple of them real quick.

1405
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,220
Electric.

1406
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:47,720
Electro.

1407
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,120
And then some handiwork.

1408
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,320
The rest is mining.

1409
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,160
That will solve all the ball issues.

1410
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,160
Oh, that would, yeah.

1411
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,120
Honestly.

1412
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,300
Oh my god, Lily, you're brainstorming!

1413
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,980
I'm brainstorming!

1414
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,960
Your brain is enlarging right now!

1415
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,100
I'm doing it!

1416
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,320
My game crashed.

1417
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,380
Alright, next one.

1418
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:08,720
No!

1419
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:11,740
Why?

1420
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,400
You're cursed!

1421
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,360
I'm cursed right now!

1422
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,520
Someone cursed my game!

1423
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:16,760
Stop being happy!

1424
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,100
I just want the right hound!

1425
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,560
Please!

1426
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,960
Let me in!

1427
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,140
Where am I?

1428
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:26,920
Okay.

1429
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,560
High quality hot springs.

1430
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,120
We need...

1431
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,300
So when you start making cement...

1432
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,260
I can make cement.

1433
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,800
I can't make the hot springs though.

1434
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,060
And we need a weapon assembly line.

1435
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,080
So whoever is level 32 and 31...

1436
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,100
I can get to level 32 soon after I fucking...

1437
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:43,900
I will make cement.

1438
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,300
At the moment, surefour has the balls.

1439
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,940
He needs to hurry and power level.

1440
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,340
I have no balls!

1441
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,320
That's the problem!

1442
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,000
Are we not at range yet for the ingots?

1443
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,320
Well, we need power.

1444
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,500
And then we also need this and we need that.

1445
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,560
Oh my god, we need so many things.

1446
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,020
And we need this and that.

1447
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,360
Am I in the right area for fucking the Ryehounds?

1448
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,080
I haven't found a single Ryehound.

1449
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,400
Uh...

1450
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,120
I put their location on the dock but I don't know where they'd be.

1451
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,900
Like the... like am I...

1452
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,120
I'm pretty sure I'm in the area for it.

1453
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,340
Yeah.

1454
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,700
This has to be the area for the fucking Ryehounds.

1455
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,500
Chat, am I in the right area?

1456
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,960
I can never tell anymore.

1457
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,920
All I see is tocos.

1458
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,360
And you'll never freaking know.

1459
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,180
I'll never know.

1460
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,900
God, the cake takes so freaking long to cook.

1461
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,460
Probably.

1462
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,760
Oh, apparently it's daytime only.

1463
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,960
Okay, that makes sense.

1464
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,460
I'm gonna dazzy.

1465
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,800
Is a dazzy good?

1466
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,340
Can't believe it's daytime only.

1467
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,160
Now I'm stuck here.

1468
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,940
I have like half a day.

1469
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,760
I can't believe I wasted half.

1470
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,580
I'm gonna catch this then.

1471
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,680
I'm gonna catch these then.

1472
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,340
Please don't take all the damage.

1473
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,870
I have a electric power.

1474
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:17,630
We can...

1475
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,990
I can give you a dazzy soon.

1476
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,890
I have one.

1477
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:23,090
I put one in.

1478
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:23,670
Woah.

1479
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,510
These guys hurt.

1480
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:28,350
Holy shit.

1481
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:29,690
How did I miss?

1482
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,390
Are you fucking kidding me?

1483
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,630
I'm just stuck here making fucking cake.

1484
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,010
You know what?

1485
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:37,850
I should just go do something else.

1486
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:41,250
The spear isn't working on dazzy level 30.

1487
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,470
Try using a better spear.

1488
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:43,050
Wait, what?

1489
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,330
The Giga Spear doesn't work on a dazzy?

1490
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:47,730
What?

1491
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,270
What the fuck do you need?

1492
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:51,390
What?

1493
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,910
Giga Mega Ultra Spear.

1494
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:55,290
There you go.

1495
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,390
I just need to damage more.

1496
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,010
Oh thank god.

1497
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:57,950
I was like there's no way.

1498
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,370
There's no way it doesn't work.

1499
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,110
Come on.

1500
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:04,290
Yes.

1501
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:07,830
Alright, nice.

1502
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:08,370
I'm level 30.

1503
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:08,990
Okay.

1504
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,310
Let's see if I can...

1505
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,410
I'm gonna catch these tokotokos.

1506
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,890
Okay, cool.

1507
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:17,130
Cool.

1508
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:17,210
Cool.

1509
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,210
Get over here tokotoko.

1510
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,450
Alright, we need to make more wheat.

1511
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,010
Ooh.

1512
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,840
Okay, nice.

1513
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:33,900
Oh fuck.

1514
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,160
Oops.

1515
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,600
Guys, I'm lucky.

1516
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,260
I'm cooking.

1517
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,980
Why do they have to sleep at night, bro?

1518
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,240
Are you using the Ignis?

1519
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,160
You...

1520
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,280
You have it.

1521
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,540
It's not on base.

1522
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,500
It's on base right now.

1523
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,440
Oh.

1524
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:53,640
What?

1525
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,040
I just make it cook real quick.

1526
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,600
Oh shit, it's hot.

1527
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,060
Oh no, it's hot now.

1528
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,940
No gathering.

1529
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,300
You must make ore.

1530
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,980
You must...

1531
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,640
No gathering.

1532
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,760
Make ore now.

1533
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,400
Ore.

1534
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,080
Now.

1535
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:19,040
If you want pure ingots, you can teleport to the other base I have and then just mine that.

1536
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,860
Oh no.

1537
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,740
How am I missing?

1538
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,420
Give me that tokotoko.

1539
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,840
Yay!

1540
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,240
Do we not have...

1541
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:35,640
Wait.

1542
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,060
A better workbench?

1543
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,220
We should.

1544
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,720
No we do.

1545
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,460
It's right over here.

1546
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:39,920
All we do here.

1547
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,940
Sorry, there's cement on it right now.

1548
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:42,740
Don't worry.

1549
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,780
I'll try and work with it.

1550
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,460
Alright.

1551
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,240
I'll just keep cooking cake.

1552
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:47,540
I'll just keep cooking cake.

1553
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,720
Raihoun, where are you?

1554
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,880
I should be able to make the...

1555
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,320
What do we need the...

1556
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,000
Uh...

1557
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,440
What do we need in level 32 and 33?

1558
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,620
Uh...

1559
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,840
We need to make the...

1560
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,660
hot springs, the better hot springs, and we need to make the...

1561
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:10,980
Um...

1562
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,540
The weapon assembly line.

1563
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:13,880
Okay.

1564
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,860
I'm almost... I'm like level 30 now.

1565
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,100
Nice!

1566
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,680
I should get to level 31 soon.

1567
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,800
I...

1568
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,780
Find the goddamn Raihoun.

1569
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,580
Boom.

1570
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,760
Cement them.

1571
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,620
It's day time!

1572
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,260
Where are you?

1573
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,360
Hit em with the cement!

1574
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,020
Alright.

1575
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,460
Okay.

1576
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:41,260
If cement is already in the thing, then we should have everything, I think, to build the...

1577
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,660
The thing?

1578
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,280
The thing?

1579
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,220
The hot springs?

1580
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:45,660
Yeah.

1581
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,360
When we're thing-ing the thing?

1582
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,040
Oh yeah.

1583
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,740
Oh yeah.

1584
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,580
Exactly.

1585
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,620
It's so easy.

1586
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,480
Oh god.

1587
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,140
I can't fly.

1588
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,800
Why is it all just a die?

1589
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,240
These dogs are the hardest shit I've ever...

1590
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,680
The hardest shit to find.

1591
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,340
Oh hey, there's an electric egg.

1592
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,280
Wait.

1593
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,320
This egg could hatch it.

1594
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,260
If it's a grizz, then...

1595
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,540
Wait, what size is it?

1596
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,340
I haven't found a large electric egg.

1597
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,620
I don't think this is as fast as it is.

1598
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,920
No way.

1599
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,880
I'll try and find a dog just in case we don't...

1600
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,200
Guys,

1601
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:26,850
am I in the right place?

1602
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,270
Chat!

1603
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,510
My back seat is...

1604
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:28,990
I am!

1605
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,730
You're level 36?!

1606
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,130
Okay, this is awkward.

1607
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,450
Okay, I did not realize you're level 36.

1608
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:39,930
They're big boys.

1609
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,370
Wow, they're... yeah.

1610
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:43,930
This is bad.

1611
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,290
I don't think this is fast enough.

1612
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,790
I might die.

1613
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:47,990
Uh oh.

1614
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:49,410
Thanks.

1615
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:54,610
Hopefully that electric egg is just a grizz bolt and then we're done.

1616
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:54,770
Hopefully that electric egg is just a grizz bolt and then we're done.

1617
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:58,770
Yeah, but if I die, we won't get the electric egg.

1618
00:54:59,010 --> 00:54:59,610
Oh no.

1619
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,650
I'm gonna see if I can catch one.

1620
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,230
I'm gonna try my best.

1621
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:04,930
You know what?

1622
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,290
Uh...

1623
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,250
I'm just gonna... I'm not testing this.

1624
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:11,590
I'm gonna bank it all on this electric egg.

1625
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,190
Fuck this.

1626
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,070
Actually, unless... There's one!

1627
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,090
I can separate this one guy.

1628
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,610
No, you!

1629
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,170
You're gonna one guy him?

1630
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,570
I'm gonna one guy this guy.

1631
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:27,050
Oh my god, please don't run away.

1632
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,090
This guy's level 34.

1633
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,990
Wait, what gender do I need them to be?

1634
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,270
I forgot.

1635
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,050
What's the relaxotaurus gender?

1636
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,150
It doesn't matter, just get him.

1637
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:35,110
No, the relaxotaurus?

1638
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,210
I would need to ask.

1639
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,230
Sure, I think...

1640
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,370
I have one too.

1641
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,370
Is that male or female?

1642
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,350
Pretty sure I only killed the relaxotaurus.

1643
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,890
I have one as well, so...

1644
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,530
Yeah, we need him, but...

1645
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,150
Let me see.

1646
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,910
It might be on the other side.

1647
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:54,530
I'm taking a quick look.

1648
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:55,750
You have to throw him.

1649
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,070
So, we need the masanda.

1650
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,910
But I think we have masanda...

1651
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,610
We have a male masanda.

1652
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:05,750
Yeah, we only have male, then we need a female.

1653
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:06,590
Wait, sure, for Wastey?

1654
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:07,610
Put him on our team.

1655
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,310
Put him on our team?

1656
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:10,650
What do you mean?

1657
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:14,190
Yeah, but if I have him, I already have Incineroar on my team making the ore.

1658
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:15,430
Oh, okay.

1659
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:16,590
I think it's the location.

1660
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,830
Wait, I'm gonna try this down and rebuild this.

1661
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,090
Like, much further into the farm.

1662
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,310
I think it's too far outside.

1663
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,050
I'm worried you got this.

1664
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,130
I'll feed you.

1665
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,370
What the...

1666
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,090
Woo!

1667
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,310
Woo!

1668
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:37,070
No!

1669
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,870
There's so many people trying to kill me!

1670
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,790
Oh my god!

1671
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:42,570
Please!

1672
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,110
There's so many people involved now!

1673
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,330
So, it sounds like things are going really well for Doki right now.

1674
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:47,530
No!

1675
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:48,450
Things are...

1676
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,130
It sounds amazing!

1677
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,430
It sounds like... man!

1678
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,410
Oh my god, alright, I'm gonna bank on this...

1679
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,070
Where's my invite?

1680
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:55,450
What the fuck?

1681
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,730
I'm gonna bank on this egg.

1682
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:57,290
I'm gonna...

1683
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,130
I'm gonna try to get up to... fuck me up.

1684
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,230
Holy shit.

1685
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:07,250
It literally... five pals came up and just killed the two rayhounds I had.

1686
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:08,150
It was crazy.

1687
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,210
Come on, cake!

1688
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,550
I just want the zanubias!

1689
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,070
I'm just gonna bank on this one egg I have.

1690
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,730
I'm just hoping it's not a drassie.

1691
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,930
What size is the egg?

1692
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:23,350
Large.

1693
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,770
Alright, then maybe.

1694
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:27,470
Fingers crossed!

1695
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,530
I got third party so hard.

1696
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,250
There he is!

1697
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:32,030
Oh my god.

1698
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,150
Can you call back the asynaram?

1699
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:34,870
Yeah.

1700
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,110
There he fucking is.

1701
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,310
Alright, I'm coming over.

1702
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:38,590
Alright,

1703
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:43,130
I'm heading over.

1704
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,300
I... can you in just a second...

1705
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,340
rebuild the...

1706
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,700
assembly line?

1707
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,740
The palsphere assembly line?

1708
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,620
But like...

1709
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,300
attempt to find...

1710
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,540
I can chop down some trees to make it more in base.

1711
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,300
I think the location was just...

1712
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,380
Oh my god, he's so big and broken.

1713
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,020
It's fine.

1714
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,520
Alright, I put in...

1715
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,580
I can put it in front of the beds, but I think that'll fuck things up.

1716
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,980
I moved the beds mostly out of the way, but...

1717
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,080
Can you just put it...

1718
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,480
anywhere in... oh shit, that's the beds.

1719
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,320
We can rebuild the beds down below, but they don't...

1720
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,300
seem to understand how to go down the...

1721
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,360
Yeah, what if I put it here?

1722
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,760
It's like in between the beds as well, but...

1723
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,340
not so much in front of them.

1724
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,100
Yeah.

1725
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,220
Alright.

1726
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,660
Nice.

1727
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,000
Time to breed.

1728
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,760
Do you have any hyperspheres around?

1729
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,420
Um, I only have...

1730
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,320
gigaspears, sorry.

1731
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,560
I can't make hyper.

1732
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,420
I was focusing...

1733
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,140
on giga, cause I figured...

1734
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,320
I'm gonna... you catch high level shit.

1735
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,320
Just gonna... Yeah, we need giga.

1736
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,300
You need giga?

1737
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,660
Okay.

1738
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,160
I can give you some of my gigaspears if you want them.

1739
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,900
Um... What do you got?

1740
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:54,980
I can drop 15.

1741
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,000
I dropped 15 on me.

1742
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,320
It's next to the berries.

1743
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,400
They're from right here.

1744
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,180
There's so many names...

1745
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,480
Where am I?

1746
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:03,760
Here.

1747
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,180
Thank you.

1748
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,720
Here's some giga.

1749
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,120
Oh, I'm gonna go...

1750
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,240
catch some...

1751
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,460
Let's see how much you have.

1752
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,760
I'm just gonna make some normal.

1753
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,740
I'm gonna power level a little bit.

1754
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,000
Wait, come the fuck back.

1755
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,520
Come back.

1756
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,300
So I can catch the... Yes!

1757
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,940
The new assembly line works.

1758
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:19,700
Nice.

1759
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:20,700
Nice!

1760
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,000
They're working on it now.

1761
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,120
Alright, cool, cool, cool.

1762
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,960
Alright, I'm putting Bushi in the breeding booth.

1763
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:28,640
Oh my god, please.

1764
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,200
Let me get down...

1765
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,960
from the fucking... vanworm.

1766
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,600
And I'm gonna go grab Pen King.

1767
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,000
Uh...

1768
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,480
Oh, what the fuck just died?

1769
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,680
Where's the assembly line?

1770
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,560
Go ahead.

1771
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,460
It's like...

1772
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,460
It's breeding time!

1773
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:46,500
Where is it?

1774
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,760
The brick stone rock thing.

1775
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,380
The brick big stone rock thing.

1776
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,840
Yes, the big stone tooth coming out of this...

1777
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,060
facility.

1778
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,140
Oh, there it is.

1779
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,460
Okay, I'm gonna... I need some...

1780
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,520
Okay, I'm gonna...

1781
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,120
I need to get some normal...

1782
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,040
I need to get some normal...

1783
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,520
Skulking around.

1784
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,400
Alright, here we go.

1785
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,220
Alright, go!

1786
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:06,860
Go!

1787
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,820
Fall in love!

1788
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,100
Make babies!

1789
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,620
Plop, plop, plop!

1790
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,280
What?!

1791
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,360
Eat the cake!

1792
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,160
Make babies!

1793
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,300
I don't think pressuring them...

1794
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,400
How long does it take them to make babies?

1795
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:20,800
Oh my god.

1796
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,600
I think maybe stop watching?

1797
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,080
Stop watching them and then maybe...

1798
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,500
Sometimes... Is that... Is that a...

1799
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,640
requirement or a request?

1800
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,160
Really?

1801
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:30,560
What did you say?

1802
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:31,680
Really?

1803
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,800
Do we have something to make palladium fragments?

1804
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,500
Like the...

1805
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,040
Um, the crusher.

1806
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,340
The crusher.

1807
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,880
Yeah, yeah, just... We don't.

1808
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,480
We should make one.

1809
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,000
We... I'm about to make one.

1810
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:40,660
Okay.

1811
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,600
Alright, I'm just gonna construct these.

1812
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,540
Oh, yeah, wait a minute.

1813
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,340
For the crusher...

1814
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,360
I wrote down this yesterday, but for the crusher...

1815
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,540
Uh, can we get that...

1816
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,140
boss, the... What is his name?

1817
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:52,960
The...

1818
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,540
The little water noodle guy.

1819
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,240
One of the bosses.

1820
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,880
I have an azeroth.

1821
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:58,500
Yay!

1822
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:58,740
I have one.

1823
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,440
Yeah, can we put him... Can we put him out for the...

1824
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,080
for the crusher?

1825
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:01,800
Yeah, I can do it.

1826
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,040
Which do you want to get rid of?

1827
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,620
Let me know.

1828
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,280
Not the miners.

1829
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,520
The miners are like essential right now.

1830
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:07,340
Okay.

1831
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,700
Uh, well once Bushi and what's his name, like, uh...

1832
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,600
stop going at it, then...

1833
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,580
we can put them away.

1834
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:13,760
Oh, yeah.

1835
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,620
Alright, just let me know.

1836
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,940
And then I can put the azeroth in there.

1837
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,100
I'm just... I'm gonna...

1838
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,480
Oh, shit.

1839
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,440
I'm going to go power level a little bit.

1840
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,800
I need... Cause you guys... I need to get to level 2 and 3...

1841
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,220
Level 32 and 3 for us.

1842
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,360
You could also just start making some...

1843
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,520
mega spheres.

1844
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,440
Okay.

1845
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:31,880
Alright.

1846
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,720
We just need some fragments.

1847
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,580
We don't have enough wood for a crusher.

1848
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,180
That costs less material.

1849
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,640
Well, it's a good thing there's a bunch of trees around here.

1850
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,140
Yeah, yeah.

1851
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:40,940
Good thing!

1852
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,340
That's what the base is for!

1853
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:42,460
I can...

1854
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,400
I can chop down some trees off there.

1855
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,160
Yeehaw!

1856
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,320
We gotta get to level 20!

1857
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,180
Where the fuck are the other pals around here?

1858
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,680
I need a power level...

1859
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,520
It says 33 for us.

1860
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,160
This is the most empty area I've ever seen.

1861
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,060
Pals!

1862
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:07,820
Oh, there you are.

1863
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,760
I'm gonna catch a frock.

1864
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:14,170
Okay...

1865
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:17,370
Is it enough?

1866
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:21,510
If I can get a bunch of mega spheres, I can probably... No, it's not enough.

1867
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:21,770
Wait.

1868
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,050
...power level pretty high.

1869
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,830
Umm... We need wood for mega spheres.

1870
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,890
Alright, I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to put the elk back in here to make wood.

1871
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:33,530
We need...

1872
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,550
Uhh...

1873
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,390
We just need wood.

1874
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,150
So I mean...

1875
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:37,150
Uh...

1876
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:38,970
Flannel's not doing anything right now, so I'm just gonna swap her.

1877
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,050
I mean, just start cutting some trees right now.

1878
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,350
By yourself.

1879
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:43,510
On it.

1880
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,750
And then make some mega spheres for true 4.

1881
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:49,970
Alright.

1882
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,210
Because...

1883
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:56,270
Once I get to legendary spheres, all you need is...

1884
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:01,270
Legendary spheres only cost palladium and iron, I'm pretty sure.

1885
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:03,350
Do you guys need more tombats?

1886
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,810
Or...

1887
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,370
Oh, they need carbon fibers.

1888
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,610
Tombats are always good right now.

1889
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,830
But I think we have an Anubis soon?

1890
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,590
Okay, so you don't need tombat then.

1891
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:13,490
It looks like another 2 minutes until the first egg comes out.

1892
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:14,850
Nice.

1893
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,190
Uhh... And then, did we have...

1894
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:21,690
Did we have the right genders for making the Lylene?

1895
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:22,070
I forgot.

1896
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:23,250
Yeah, we do.

1897
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:24,210
I got a Missandra.

1898
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:24,770
Alright.

1899
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,270
I will need the pet whatever then.

1900
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:27,890
Missandra's...

1901
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,510
Surefour, you may give...

1902
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,570
Give her the bataleo.

1903
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:31,950
Pretty soon.

1904
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:32,650
Or Lylene.

1905
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,070
You probably got about 5 or 6 minutes.

1906
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:35,470
Augie.

1907
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:41,250
Get over here, Fwock.

1908
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,850
Why are none of us lucky enough for lucky palettes?

1909
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,750
I haven't found one yet.

1910
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,170
Yeah, well I'm never gonna find one.

1911
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:49,450
Keep that.

1912
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,470
Surefour, why aren't you lucky?

1913
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,870
You know, my stats got rolled differently when I spawned.

1914
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,370
What did you get for your stats?

1915
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,150
I don't know, like...

1916
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:03,770
Like, my hands?

1917
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:05,670
Your hands!

1918
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,010
Alright.

1919
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:11,710
Okay.

1920
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,410
See you.

1921
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,210
Deforestation sounds.

1922
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:22,610
Deforestation ASMR.

1923
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:23,910
Nice.

1924
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,010
I love deforestation in-game.

1925
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:28,510
Deforestation ASMR.

1926
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:33,770
You said that with such like a nice ASMR voice though.

1927
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:36,910
You said that with such like a nice ASMR voice though.

1928
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:37,470
You said that with such like a nice ASMR voice though.

1929
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,310
I'm committed!

1930
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:39,370
I'm in the role now!

1931
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:39,570
I'm committed!

1932
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:39,570
I'm in the role now!

1933
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,330
Yeah, we're being immersed right now!

1934
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:42,890
I'm being immersed.

1935
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,070
Thank you very much.

1936
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,570
Yeah, stop trying to break our immersion.

1937
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:47,390
Oh my god.

1938
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:50,770
Mom, oh my god, you're embarrassing me!

1939
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:51,470
Mom, oh my god, you're embarrassing me!

1940
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:52,170
Stop!

1941
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,030
Industrialization ASMR.

1942
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:56,410
Industrialization ASMR.

1943
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:57,750
Industrialization ASMR.

1944
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,660
Alright, Crusher is made.

1945
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,140
Do you want me to just make a bunch of Palladium fragments right now?

1946
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,740
Yeah, cause that's what's holding back the bold right now.

1947
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,600
Alright, I'm starting production.

1948
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,520
We're gonna be wiped out of rock, but that's okay.

1949
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,060
I'm on my way to make more rock.

1950
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,360
Alright, maybe the baby is born.

1951
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,000
The baby is born!

1952
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,380
Yes!

1953
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,100
Clip, clip, clip!

1954
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:34,980
Is it clipping time?

1955
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,020
It's a huge rocky egg.

1956
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,260
Is that what Anubis comes out of?

1957
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,920
Oh wait, no clips.

1958
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,100
Sorry, no clips then.

1959
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,880
I thought you meant the baby's hatched.

1960
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,760
No clip, guys.

1961
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,300
No clip.

1962
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:47,860
False alarm.

1963
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,000
False alarm.

1964
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,120
My water broke!

1965
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:51,540
Nevermind.

1966
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,020
False alarm.

1967
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,680
I'm gonna leave them in there to make another Anubis though.

1968
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:55,120
Okay.

1969
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,880
Wait, just kidding.

1970
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,920
It takes 40 fucking minutes, but we're not doing that.

1971
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,180
Oh no, not the dog.

1972
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,980
Alright, then I will need...

1973
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:03,860
pet...pet...pet...

1974
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,860
pet...petile.

1975
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:05,680
I'm coming.

1976
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,520
I'll let them make a second egg while I'm waiting for it.

1977
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,570
What's the lowest level Anubis you can catch?

1978
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,850
That shouldn't take 40 minutes.

1979
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:22,550
If it's like a quick, you know, Yeah, yeah!

1980
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:24,770
I put her in the box.

1981
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:25,950
Thank you!

1982
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:30,890
Do I have to be level 32 or 33 for the crafting thing that you need?

1983
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:33,850
Uh, 32 and I'm running 33.

1984
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:36,750
I'm running 32 then.

1985
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:39,470
Okay, I'm gonna take...

1986
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:41,550
Oh, did you put her in here?

1987
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:42,490
Yeah.

1988
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:44,570
I think...

1989
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,310
No, you have to put her in the base.

1990
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,290
I can't see your box.

1991
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:49,670
Yeah, she's in the box.

1992
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,310
Wait, everyone has their own box?

1993
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,470
Yeah, everyone has their own box.

1994
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,210
You have to put in the...

1995
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,690
You have to have her working.

1996
01:06:58,670 --> 01:06:59,030
Yeah.

1997
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,990
Okay, so I'm just gonna get rid of this ghost bitch then.

1998
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:03,650
Sounds good.

1999
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,090
Alright, I catch an extra person for the viewing thing.

2000
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:06,550
Thanks.

2001
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,770
Because we need a view, right?

2002
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:12,230
Do we know how many people we have already?

2003
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:15,570
Uh... humans?

2004
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:16,510
Yeah, the humans.

2005
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,830
Yeah.

2006
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:18,330
We can count them real quick.

2007
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:20,950
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... wait.

2008
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:21,770
I'm short by element.

2009
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:25,010
Their element is nothing, so they'll show up at the top.

2010
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:26,470
I have 8.

2011
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:29,990
Okay, I think I have like 5 right now.

2012
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,550
Because we need 20 in total.

2013
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:34,950
The viewing thing can be made from level 14, so it's not hard.

2014
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:35,230
Yeah.

2015
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:37,730
I just want to make sure we have enough for...

2016
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:39,510
Um...

2017
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:40,610
Actually, I'll just build it.

2018
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,290
Enough for the viewing thing.

2019
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:44,630
Because we need 20, right?

2020
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:45,710
Yeah.

2021
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:48,290
I have... okay, sort.

2022
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:51,170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

2023
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,570
I have 7.

2024
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:53,630
You have 8, right?

2025
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:56,510
We should probably make it at the end, because it'll fuck up all of our base shit.

2026
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:57,630
Yeah.

2027
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:58,190
Yeah, I know.

2028
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,430
I'm just wondering how much we have.

2029
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:01,510
You need an azerob, right?

2030
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:03,990
Uh...

2031
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,130
You need...

2032
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:05,410
Yes.

2033
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:08,770
I wanted to use him on the base, just because he's better at water than anybody else.

2034
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:09,870
I put it... I got azerobs in there.

2035
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:11,250
Okay, uh...

2036
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,730
I'll grab him and I'll switch him.

2037
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:15,730
Uh...

2038
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,670
Put you on the crusher.

2039
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:21,050
Like, serpent's alright, but...

2040
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,170
Azerob should be way faster.

2041
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:24,110
Um...

2042
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,210
What do you need me to do?

2043
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,650
I need a power level stone.

2044
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:27,570
Get some freaking stone.

2045
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,450
Get stone?

2046
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:29,990
Okay, I can grab stone now for us.

2047
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:30,870
I'm getting stone.

2048
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,530
We need more.

2049
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,750
So much more.

2050
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:34,450
More stone.

2051
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:35,790
Unlimited power.

2052
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,010
I'll go mine stone for us.

2053
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,550
Can I have my buddy's five?

2054
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,610
We should have enough...

2055
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:46,270
tree... tree bark for a while.

2056
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,710
Tree... tree fiber.

2057
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:48,670
There we go.

2058
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:49,390
There we go.

2059
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:49,650
There we go.

2060
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,030
Tree sustenance.

2061
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,670
The trinussi.

2062
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:53,870
Rock and stone!

2063
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:54,310
Stone!

2064
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:57,050
Okay, I need to make more cake.

2065
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,390
Oh my god, all I'm doing is making cake.

2066
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,290
That's all we need.

2067
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:02,550
Bruh.

2068
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:04,910
Okay, there's some stone and...

2069
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:05,930
There's some stone right now.

2070
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,530
I quickly mined 17.

2071
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,710
I'm gonna go power level some more.

2072
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:11,610
I'm gonna go power level some more.

2073
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,590
Oh yeah, we need level 32.

2074
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,030
Oh yeah, we need level 32.

2075
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,330
Okay, what do we need in level 32?

2076
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:17,290
Uh... We need raw milk.

2077
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,590
Uh... Assembly line?

2078
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:19,550
Did you build the hot spring?

2079
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,010
We need the weapon assembly line.

2080
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,750
Oh, you need the high quality hot spring?

2081
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:26,470
Yeah, high quality hot spring and the weapons assembly line.

2082
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,150
Okay, I can milk make that now.

2083
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:28,650
Where do you want?

2084
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:29,650
I'm gonna put this randomly.

2085
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:32,510
We need... okay, we need stone for that.

2086
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:33,590
And then...

2087
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,430
Where's high quality assembly line?

2088
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,290
Where is that?

2089
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:39,470
I'm making another cake.

2090
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:40,070
Nails.

2091
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:40,810
We need nails.

2092
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:41,770
Ten more nails.

2093
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,270
I'm gonna make ten nails right now.

2094
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:45,070
Or put it in there.

2095
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:48,750
Nails.

2096
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,590
Uh... Is Ignis out here right now?

2097
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:52,650
He's stuck in a tree.

2098
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:54,130
Oh, I'll get him.

2099
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,950
Silly little guy.

2100
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:57,670
Silly Ignis.

2101
01:09:58,770 --> 01:09:59,570
Get back here.

2102
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:02,210
Someone fucking do this and then...

2103
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,370
I'm gonna put him on my team for a second so I can control him.

2104
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:06,490
Where the fuck are the rock ones?

2105
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:08,870
Um...

2106
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:10,670
Sweep, sweep, sweep?

2107
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:13,010
Work on that.

2108
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:15,610
Okay, there.

2109
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:16,350
Make the cake.

2110
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,270
Go and do the rock stuff.

2111
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:21,630
Dumud, no!

2112
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,050
Dumud, come over here!

2113
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:25,670
Wait.

2114
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:26,910
I'm a genius.

2115
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:27,670
Oh my goodness.

2116
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:28,750
Wait, chat.

2117
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:29,970
I have the breath.

2118
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:30,470
Watch this.

2119
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:32,250
Oh my god, what are you doing, Lili?

2120
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,290
What are you doing?

2121
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:38,110
I'm gonna farm the rock with my boar, which is pretty fast.

2122
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,290
And then I'll get it all into base.

2123
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:41,830
In one go.

2124
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:44,330
Abusing the wolf charge.

2125
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:47,190
Oh, that is so big brain.

2126
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,970
Because then I don't care about the weight.

2127
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:52,030
I don't have to go back and forth every time I'm cucumbered.

2128
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,250
I can just do it in one big longer trip.

2129
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,650
Yeah, yeah.

2130
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:55,250
Oh my god.

2131
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,210
You're like a gamer right now.

2132
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:01,390
I made an improved furnace so we can make a fine kettle.

2133
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:02,570
Oh nice, that's good.

2134
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,830
Let's go!

2135
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:06,250
Alright, then I need to go make the coal.

2136
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:09,350
Okay.

2137
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,090
We're cooking so hard right now.

2138
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:13,350
Our cake is done.

2139
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:14,870
I need to make another coal.

2140
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,410
We need milk, berries, flour.

2141
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:17,870
Cooking!

2142
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:24,450
Alright, I have a lot of stone for us.

2143
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,010
I have a lot of stone for us.

2144
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,390
That should be close to...

2145
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,330
Actually, I'm close to...

2146
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,270
100.

2147
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:30,610
Stop!

2148
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:31,850
Why are you getting tired?

2149
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:32,850
Keep working!

2150
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:34,850
Just work, man!

2151
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,930
You have nothing else to do in your life?

2152
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:40,410
Oh shit, it's damage.

2153
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:43,150
Alright, looks like the crusher...

2154
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:45,370
They're not doing anything on it anymore, which maybe means they're dead.

2155
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,710
I mean, done.

2156
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:47,890
They're dead?

2157
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:52,390
Give me like 10 more minutes and I'm bringing home loads of rock.

2158
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:52,710
Okay, yeah, they...

2159
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,070
They made the 61 palladium fragments.

2160
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:56,070
Nice.

2161
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,310
There's no labor loss for pals.

2162
01:11:58,570 --> 01:11:59,890
You think there's pal rights?

2163
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,570
What do you think this is, summer camp?

2164
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:03,050
No pal rights.

2165
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,390
There's no pal rights here.

2166
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:09,650
If there were pal rights, they would not be stuck in the fucking ball.

2167
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,090
If there were pal rights, they would not be stuck in the fucking ball.

2168
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,050
We need two Anubises, right?

2169
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,110
Oh, we need cement.

2170
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,050
We need 20 cement.

2171
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,810
If someone can make that.

2172
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,790
Okay, I'm gonna get the...

2173
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,390
Petili, whatever her name is.

2174
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,510
Get out of here, you're so annoying.

2175
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:32,550
How do you make cement?

2176
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:36,430
We need 20.

2177
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:37,310
Cement is bone, pal, wood.

2178
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,490
I think it has been a special workbench.

2179
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,510
Oh, okay, I'm gonna see if we can make cement right now.

2180
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:42,710
Because we need...

2181
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:43,070
Oh, I think we need...

2182
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,430
Oh no, we need 20.

2183
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:46,550
Have pal fluids too.

2184
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,150
What level... where the fuck is cement?

2185
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:53,470
Oh god, there it is.

2186
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:56,750
It is time to breed.

2187
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:57,770
Cement.

2188
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:01,130
There's so many crackers, which one's the right one?

2189
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:01,990
No, stop.

2190
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,290
Stop being useful, go breed.

2191
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:06,730
There you go.

2192
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:08,230
Oh, it makes 10.

2193
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:09,190
I need 20.

2194
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:10,670
Okay.

2195
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,050
Please breed.

2196
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:14,830
Thank you.

2197
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:17,450
Job's done.

2198
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:18,730
Yay.

2199
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:19,750
Thanks.

2200
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:22,250
Alright, wait.

2201
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:29,190
Do you think you're at your high enough level to do the hard pals now?

2202
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:30,230
For day 2?

2203
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:31,890
Day 4?

2204
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:33,690
Ummm...

2205
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,410
What are the average levels of those guys?

2206
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,070
They are level...

2207
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:39,830
40.

2208
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,710
Nah, those guys are level 40s.

2209
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:45,970
I'm gonna try to make as many spears.

2210
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:46,230
Oh man.

2211
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,290
I've been on it this whole time.

2212
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,690
I know, I know.

2213
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,490
We're all struggling together.

2214
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:57,530
We're trying to make as many spears as possible.

2215
01:13:58,490 --> 01:13:58,610
We're trying to make as many spears as possible.

2216
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,890
We just need a shit ton of stone.

2217
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:04,410
Then a bunch of gigasfears can start being made.

2218
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:05,650
Gigasfears.

2219
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,710
I am bringing a bunch of stone.

2220
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,570
Wait, did you guys make some stuff just now?

2221
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:12,670
With stone?

2222
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:14,590
Someone must have.

2223
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:15,990
Yeah, cause there's like 5 now.

2224
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:16,870
I had 80.

2225
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:17,450
What?

2226
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:20,310
No, back to mining.

2227
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:22,670
Let's see, let's hope this is a grizzbolt.

2228
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,290
Let's hope it's a grizz.

2229
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:25,410
Is it a grizzbolt?

2230
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,310
It is a rayhound, which is fine.

2231
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:28,230
Oh, okay, that's fine.

2232
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:28,790
We got it.

2233
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:29,150
It's fine.

2234
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:30,650
We got what we need.

2235
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:33,990
Rayhound, grizzbolt, it's the same.

2236
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:35,230
Alright, cool.

2237
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:40,070
I yearn for the mines.

2238
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,650
We can put more people in.

2239
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:43,490
We want somebody who can do this, right?

2240
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:45,690
Okay, let's see.

2241
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:52,340
Where's my stone?

2242
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,960
I need eggs too, so I'm gonna split out this fucking chicken.

2243
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,660
There should be like a lot of eggs.

2244
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,200
Okay, I'm bringing almost a thousand.

2245
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,180
Unless like you, unless like spy aid.

2246
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,880
Well, I had to make a bunch of kegs.

2247
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,220
So, hold on, let me check.

2248
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:09,580
Oh no, sorry.

2249
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,340
Milk is what I need.

2250
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:10,920
I don't need eggs.

2251
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,960
Yeah, I was gonna say, I fucking brought out a ton of eggs.

2252
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:14,880
My bad.

2253
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,920
Sorry, I didn't mean to doubt your egg making process.

2254
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:20,220
The stone farm at the base sucks.

2255
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:20,500
That's fucking right.

2256
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,820
I know the best about eggs.

2257
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:23,720
You're really good at laying eggs.

2258
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:24,860
Don't worry about it.

2259
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,480
I know everything there is about eggs.

2260
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,060
I got like a thousand stones in 15 minutes time.

2261
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:37,340
The stone base at the base doesn't seem to get the bonus from like the extra bonus.

2262
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,340
Make sure the hot spring now.

2263
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,760
I'm gonna put it all the way here.

2264
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,140
So they have to travel down.

2265
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,040
Boom!

2266
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,800
A thousand stones!

2267
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,360
Holy shit, they're all...

2268
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,980
Why is there so many hungry people?

2269
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,040
We need, uh...

2270
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:54,120
berries if people have any that they've gotten on the road.

2271
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,580
We don't really use our berry farm.

2272
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:57,760
So...

2273
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,220
This is fine.

2274
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,480
I'm building the hot spring now.

2275
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,360
This is fine.

2276
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,980
What's wrong with the hot spring?

2277
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,520
Why are you saying it like that?

2278
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,640
What's wrong with the hot spring?

2279
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:14,740
This is fine!

2280
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,060
Are we doing some OSHA violations over here?

2281
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:20,440
It's fine.

2282
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,880
They don't care enough.

2283
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,580
They don't care.

2284
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,120
It's a water slide, exactly.

2285
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,740
It's a water slide.

2286
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,720
Did you put it on the side of the map?

2287
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,640
I don't know.

2288
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,020
All of this work for one stone.

2289
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,020
Wait, unless...

2290
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:37,720
Unless?

2291
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:38,660
Unless?

2292
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,400
Can I mine it with my board?

2293
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,280
Can I mine it with my board?

2294
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,260
Maybe you do, yeah.

2295
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,280
Okay, we got the hot spring.

2296
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,500
Okay, we got the hot spring.

2297
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:48,540
Weapons?

2298
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,680
Checking what else I need for it.

2299
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,140
We need a lot.

2300
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,340
We need a hundred ingots.

2301
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,580
I found a stone.

2302
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,080
I found a stone.

2303
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,140
I made power spheres in the working.

2304
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:04,260
I will get ingots done.

2305
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,520
I need a hundred ingots.

2306
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,300
Let me know when we've reached a hundred.

2307
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,580
Okay.

2308
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,800
That's all we need.

2309
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:14,020
Ummm...

2310
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,280
I need milk.

2311
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,340
Flour should be okay, I just need milk.

2312
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,460
I'll go kill the birdash now.

2313
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,880
The bee is not really making a lot of honey.

2314
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,120
Which is concerning.

2315
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,800
I'm gonna go kill the birdash now.

2316
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:30,120
If someone just goes and kills bees, they just drop honey off the deck.

2317
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:30,580
True.

2318
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,840
Alright, it's this way.

2319
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,540
Oh yeah, the bee is doing other shit.

2320
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,180
What is...

2321
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:39,780
Okay for...

2322
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:41,860
Right now.

2323
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,060
No we're not.

2324
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,240
No we're not.

2325
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,440
Oh wait, yes we are.

2326
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:46,640
We're good.

2327
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,560
The birdash is close by.

2328
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,660
I think I'm leveled up enough for birdash.

2329
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,840
He's like level 34.

2330
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,240
For sure.

2331
01:17:58,780 --> 01:17:59,600
Okay, it's this way.

2332
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:02,720
Sure, what level are you at?

2333
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,060
I might kill some bees right now.

2334
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,540
Nice.

2335
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,140
Actually, I can kill bees here.

2336
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:11,990
How many...

2337
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:12,830
How much honey do we need?

2338
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:19,630
I think actually for the amount of breeding we're gonna do, we're actually probably gonna be okay on honey since it doesn't expire.

2339
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:20,690
Oh okay, well...

2340
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,070
We could use another bee though.

2341
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,410
Use another bee or do you want...

2342
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,670
Don't we need that queen bee for something?

2343
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:28,910
No.

2344
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,790
You have the queen bee boss.

2345
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:31,330
No.

2346
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:32,450
No.

2347
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:33,550
That's what I'm thinking.

2348
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:35,450
Elizabeth Bee or whatever her name is.

2349
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:36,970
She was on the achievement list.

2350
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:39,230
Oh god, oh god.

2351
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:40,350
Leave me alone, leave me alone.

2352
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:45,470
No, wrong one.

2353
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:48,030
It's my fucking thing.

2354
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:48,550
Okay, yeah.

2355
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:54,570
Yeah, we need so many more miners in the base.

2356
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:55,950
No one is mining anything.

2357
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:57,410
At all.

2358
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:59,730
Nah, we stream on Twitch.

2359
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:01,210
We don't really need miners in chat.

2360
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:01,790
I don't think.

2361
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,970
I don't think we need any more miners.

2362
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:06,270
I think we good, I think we good.

2363
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,630
I think we good.

2364
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:11,210
You gotta be 13 and over to be on Twitch right now?

2365
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:11,890
I'm just saying.

2366
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,010
Stop typing I'm 12 in the chat.

2367
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:15,610
I swear to god.

2368
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:16,950
I'm just saying, 13 and over.

2369
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:20,990
Where is...

2370
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:21,930
Where is Ash?

2371
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:24,590
Germantide is here.

2372
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:26,130
Oh wait, it's like further up.

2373
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:29,070
Oh my god, they were so close to making the egg.

2374
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:29,590
No.

2375
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,550
They went to sleep.

2376
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:34,170
It's alright, we got...

2377
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,090
Wait, do we need the queen bee?

2378
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,110
Do we need the queen bee?

2379
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,910
It's a kill.

2380
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:38,950
We have to kill.

2381
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:41,250
I'm also day one achievement I think.

2382
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:42,730
We have to kill and then the lies to be?

2383
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:43,750
It's not priority.

2384
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,250
Or the boss.

2385
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:46,870
The boss or the normal?

2386
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:48,170
Oh, okay.

2387
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:52,050
Alright, cause I found there's a normal Elizabeth here.

2388
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:56,110
We also need a little bit of milk.

2389
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:56,970
Alright.

2390
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:59,750
Guys, do not type that you're 12.

2391
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:01,030
You can actually get banned.

2392
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:02,570
You will actually get banned.

2393
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,170
Don't type that.

2394
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,710
You will actually get banned.

2395
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,490
You will actually get banned.

2396
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,270
Don't type it.

2397
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:09,770
They want to be freed.

2398
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:12,490
You will literally get banned like immediately.

2399
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:14,550
They want to be freed from their cages.

2400
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:15,070
Yeah.

2401
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,710
Cagy wagey freedom.

2402
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,290
Don't do it.

2403
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,950
Don't do it bro.

2404
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,040
Okay.

2405
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,000
Uh...

2406
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:29,900
Okay.

2407
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:37,630
How much time do we have left?

2408
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:39,810
We're at the three hour mark by the way.

2409
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:41,390
Yup.

2410
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:41,650
Wait.

2411
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:43,930
Oh, there's three hours left.

2412
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:44,470
Oh my god.

2413
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,850
I thought you said we've already been doing this three hours.

2414
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2415
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:48,610
I was like, oh my god.

2416
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:49,710
Can you imagine?

2417
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:53,190
We only have like one clip in three hours.

2418
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:54,210
That'd be so sad.

2419
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,090
I started to panic.

2420
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:56,150
I was like what the fuck.

2421
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:57,270
I've done fucking nothing.

2422
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:03,750
We've just been like trying to efficient size the base and got nothing else done.

2423
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,050
Uh...

2424
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:05,570
Okay.

2425
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:09,450
For the weapons assembly line, where are we at with that?

2426
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,110
Um, I'm just...

2427
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:12,410
Do we need more ingots?

2428
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:13,050
We need ingots.

2429
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:13,790
We need a hundred ingots.

2430
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,370
We have everything but...

2431
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,190
I am making 184 ingots right now.

2432
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:19,610
Yeah, like that's clearly the only thing we're missing.

2433
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:20,550
Just the ingots.

2434
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:21,990
Alright.

2435
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:25,510
Do we have food?

2436
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:26,290
I'm starving.

2437
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:26,870
I'm on HP.

2438
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,710
Something's gonna sneeze on me and I'll die.

2439
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:30,990
Just like...

2440
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:31,190
Fine.

2441
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:31,770
Just don't get invaded.

2442
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:35,850
Yeah, in that moment we get raided right there.

2443
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,250
Yup.

2444
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,790
Those five berries are for our pals.

2445
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:41,570
Okay, they gotta split it between the 14 of them.

2446
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,650
Well, now it's too bad.

2447
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,810
Now they have zero berries.

2448
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:47,190
Because I'm starving.

2449
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,390
Lily's life matters more than the pal.

2450
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:52,230
Exactly.

2451
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,670
Oh wait, I can get some berries real quick.

2452
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:55,430
I think it's done.

2453
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:57,570
I think it's done.

2454
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:58,450
Surefour can make it.

2455
01:21:58,490 --> 01:21:59,550
Are you at the base right now?

2456
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:00,870
Surefour or no?

2457
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:04,190
I can make it.

2458
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:07,130
I just need to catch this...

2459
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,070
Catch the burr dash and then I can come over and make it.

2460
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:10,970
You're good.

2461
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,810
Whoa, get away from me.

2462
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:34,030
Come on, leave me alone.

2463
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:35,090
Leave me alone.

2464
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:36,870
Real quick.

2465
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:39,670
Where did this wheat come from?

2466
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:40,370
Who's hungry?

2467
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:42,450
Mind if I roll wheat?

2468
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:45,070
Oh god, are they stuck somewhere?

2469
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:45,830
I'll grab them.

2470
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:50,750
Come on.

2471
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:53,270
Come on, daytree.

2472
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,370
Come on, Surefour's daydream.

2473
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:56,750
I think.

2474
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,930
That I still own for some reason.

2475
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:02,090
The trade you had.

2476
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:04,290
You had my chickpea and I got your daydream.

2477
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:08,530
They're going to need to learn how to share real fast.

2478
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:09,530
We got five berries.

2479
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,200
Wait.

2480
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,460
Oh shit.

2481
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,500
You're level 22.

2482
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,340
I think you'll be fine.

2483
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,260
Actually, no.

2484
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,500
You will not be fine.

2485
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,120
Alright, we've got all the ingot are cooked.

2486
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,360
Oh shit.

2487
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,060
What?

2488
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,720
What the fuck did it hit me?

2489
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,440
Okay, I was like 200 miles away and it still hit me.

2490
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,220
How much charcoal do we need?

2491
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:44,800
Let me check.

2492
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,580
Charcoal, charcoal, charcoal.

2493
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:47,740
We need 100.

2494
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,080
Alright, I'll just make it right now.

2495
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:55,100
I need 100 of these.

2496
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,280
Okay.

2497
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:57,340
Go.

2498
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:57,740
Go.

2499
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,960
Wait, why am I making him in that?

2500
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:02,640
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

2501
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,580
It doesn't matter.

2502
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,460
It'll be fine.

2503
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,180
Everything will be fine.

2504
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:06,560
It's fine.

2505
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:09,900
Mike baby?

2506
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,040
Bubby.

2507
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,260
Mike baby please?

2508
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:16,600
Are we rehacking everything for the babies yet?

2509
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,980
Uh, I just need one more cake.

2510
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:23,440
But the cows ain't giving me milk.

2511
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:24,880
Oh no.

2512
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,300
That's the worst part.

2513
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,440
They're not giving the milk.

2514
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,140
They're on strike.

2515
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,660
Oh shit, we're good.

2516
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:32,920
We're good.

2517
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:40,840
8%.

2518
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,280
That should be enough, right?

2519
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:53,440
Oh my god, why is it 8%?

2520
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:55,260
Oh no, they're all hungry.

2521
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,220
Alright, clip, clip, clip!

2522
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:58,100
I got it for a dash!

2523
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:58,940
Clip, clip, clip!

2524
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:02,980
We got our first medium bosses.

2525
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:04,860
Let's go!

2526
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,640
I'll do it manually.

2527
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,500
Clip, clip, clip!

2528
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,780
Clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip!

2529
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,420
Alright, who's the next boss?

2530
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,220
That is a level 38.

2531
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:15,380
I am not high enough level for this shit.

2532
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,620
I am only a level 33 baby.

2533
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,240
Uh, did anybody grab the flowers?

2534
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,300
I made like three of them, but they're not here.

2535
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:27,000
They might be in the chest somewhere.

2536
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:27,920
I didn't grab anything.

2537
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:29,820
That's okay.

2538
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,240
Panking!

2539
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,040
Alright, let's see.

2540
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,860
Oh, nevermind, it's working.

2541
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:37,360
Okay, cool.

2542
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,020
Just kidding.

2543
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:40,920
Just kidding.

2544
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:45,060
I'm gonna replace you now.

2545
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:49,720
Alright.

2546
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,220
Cook!

2547
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,520
You pelted a bad no.

2548
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,600
Do we have the ingots?

2549
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,420
Enough ingots to make the weapon now?

2550
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:57,500
Alright, we do.

2551
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,080
I'm gonna make it.

2552
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,620
Do you want me to place it?

2553
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,020
Where do you want me to place it?

2554
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,800
Literally anywhere.

2555
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,180
Maybe down the hill?

2556
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,440
Alright, I'll place it down the hill.

2557
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,280
I'm putting it down here.

2558
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:13,840
I'm putting it down here.

2559
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:14,960
I'm putting it down here.

2560
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,100
I'm putting it at the edge of the barrier.

2561
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,220
I can't fucking...

2562
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,200
I can't use the barrier.

2563
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:22,740
I'm using the boar because I'm making...

2564
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,760
I'm using him to make pal's fears.

2565
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,100
No boar.

2566
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:28,160
I am...

2567
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:28,860
Manual labor.

2568
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:35,230
I'm building the weapon assembly line.

2569
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:37,210
It is done in 20 seconds.

2570
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:38,030
Done!

2571
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:41,230
Alright, I'm putting berries in.

2572
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,290
So they'll stop being hungry.

2573
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:46,370
37 whole berries.

2574
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:47,150
Nice.

2575
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:47,710
There you guys go.

2576
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:48,650
You don't even need to share.

2577
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,750
Everybody gets one berry and a little bit.

2578
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:53,750
What level is the...

2579
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:56,130
To cook the food?

2580
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:59,950
Do we need to unlock for the electric kitchen or whatever?

2581
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,150
Also... 41.

2582
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:02,870
41?

2583
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:03,170
Sure.

2584
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:04,090
What level are you now?

2585
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,510
41.

2586
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:07,270
Wait, we can make it now!

2587
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:10,490
Come over here and make the pot whenever you're free.

2588
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:12,390
I'll subgrade the base.

2589
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:13,890
Those were two conflicting statements.

2590
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:19,210
By the way, we can make a third base now.

2591
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:21,330
Lilene, now I've got to make the grisbolt.

2592
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:22,730
We have a...

2593
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:25,090
We have improved furnace too.

2594
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:27,210
Grisbolt time.

2595
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:27,810
Let's go!

2596
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:29,370
We need to build large pal bed.

2597
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:30,950
Nice!

2598
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:31,590
Let's go!

2599
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:34,270
What level is large pal bed?

2600
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:35,890
I'm gonna make grisbolt now.

2601
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:38,990
We have improved furnace.

2602
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,770
We need to make the big pal bed by the way.

2603
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:41,970
The big blue one.

2604
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:43,950
Well, sure, 4K can make it.

2605
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:47,430
That's like the level 15 one.

2606
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:49,090
So we need to make high quality cloth.

2607
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:50,350
Which we should be able to do.

2608
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:51,070
We should have enough.

2609
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:52,770
Yeah, that's sure for a job.

2610
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:54,290
Nice.

2611
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:01,510
I'm gonna... which one is tower 2?

2612
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:02,770
I'll try to get to tower 2.

2613
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:04,390
Tower 2...

2614
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:07,250
Powered.

2615
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,830
Get the fuck back here.

2616
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:11,010
What level is Lilene?

2617
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,470
Awesome music.

2618
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:14,430
Get the fuck back here.

2619
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:16,750
Go back to the tent and breed.

2620
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:18,150
What are you doing?

2621
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,110
Stop running.

2622
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:21,310
Go to the breeding station.

2623
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:23,830
I think Azerope is stuck.

2624
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:24,910
Assume your station.

2625
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:27,890
Hold up, I'm gonna resummon Azerope.

2626
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:28,890
She seems very...

2627
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:29,070
There you go.

2628
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:29,270
There.

2629
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:30,230
Not productive.

2630
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:34,050
Okay.

2631
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,210
Um, can you please...

2632
01:28:37,210 --> 01:28:38,150
How long is your resting for?

2633
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,410
Take care of the fucking berries so that people aren't hungry.

2634
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:40,830
Thank you.

2635
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:42,770
Stop resting.

2636
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:43,250
Go work.

2637
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:46,710
Okay, are they breeding?

2638
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:48,470
And were they the... oh god.

2639
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,710
What are you doing?

2640
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,210
What are you doing out here, buddy?

2641
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:52,530
What are you doing?

2642
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:54,650
Why aren't you breeding?

2643
01:28:55,690 --> 01:28:56,910
Are you guys both...

2644
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:57,590
Wait a minute.

2645
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:58,890
Is one of you a girl?

2646
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,030
Nope.

2647
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:01,790
Okay.

2648
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,490
Uh, wait.

2649
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:03,190
Do we have a...

2650
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:04,990
Do we have a female panda?

2651
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,130
Uh...

2652
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:09,290
Trug.

2653
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:12,330
Do we have one of those?

2654
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:13,450
True gay.

2655
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,330
Wait, do we have...

2656
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:18,490
Can we get a moss...

2657
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:20,610
A mossander who is like a lady?

2658
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:22,470
I'm back.

2659
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:23,990
Where do they spawn?

2660
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:27,090
That's why the panda space is going extinct.

2661
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:28,390
What?

2662
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,110
What's going on?

2663
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:32,010
Uh, we need a female mossander.

2664
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:32,950
We need a female?

2665
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:33,210
Why?

2666
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,150
Because the wolf...

2667
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:38,190
To make the Grisbolt.

2668
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:39,530
Oh, wait.

2669
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:39,990
No, no, no.

2670
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:40,990
I do.

2671
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:43,350
Because we're trying to make the Grisbolt.

2672
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:44,830
Oh, so you need a female...

2673
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:45,690
I need a female mossander.

2674
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:46,930
Okay, I can get one right now.

2675
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,050
We only have a male.

2676
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:49,770
Do we have a male Mausanda?

2677
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:50,810
We've only got male.

2678
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:53,330
And we need a wolf with it?

2679
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:54,390
We need a...

2680
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:55,510
So we're trying to make Grisbolt.

2681
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:56,930
I can find one right now.

2682
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:57,350
What's the secondary?

2683
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:58,250
What's the secondary?

2684
01:29:58,550 --> 01:29:59,150
The house.

2685
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:00,510
The house and Dire house.

2686
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:01,070
Rayhound.

2687
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:01,770
The Rayhound.

2688
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:03,310
We hatched a Rayhound, so...

2689
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:03,570
Yeah.

2690
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:04,910
Mausanda would be easier to get.

2691
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:05,370
I can find a female.

2692
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:06,950
I can find one right now.

2693
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,630
I'm actually literally in the forest right now.

2694
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:09,770
Okay, cool.

2695
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:11,030
I'm Lily in the forest.

2696
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,730
I'm in a forest right now.

2697
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:13,650
Lily's in the forest?

2698
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:16,090
What are you doing there?

2699
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:17,370
I'm in the forest right now.

2700
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,350
She's in the forest right now?

2701
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:20,250
What's the order?

2702
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,230
What time?

2703
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,310
I'm trying to find Lily right now.

2704
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:25,230
Lily, where are you?

2705
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:27,170
Deforestation!

2706
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:28,330
I can hear her.

2707
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:29,330
Deforestation!

2708
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,570
She's...

2709
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:34,870
I've been trying to find you for 20 years, Lily.

2710
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:40,390
I'm trying...

2711
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,490
Alright.

2712
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:42,430
I'm at the Mausanda forest.

2713
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:43,550
Cool, cool, cool.

2714
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:43,630
Cool.

2715
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:44,550
I just need to get a female.

2716
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,550
I need to make more cake.

2717
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,160
Let's see...

2718
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,040
Uh, milk and flour.

2719
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:55,420
Okay.

2720
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,220
Need more milk.

2721
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,260
Need more milk.

2722
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,280
I just need some milk.

2723
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,120
Mausandra!

2724
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,160
There's a lot of Lizabees.

2725
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,840
Flying around.

2726
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:16,910
So many Lizabees.

2727
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:17,110
More milk please.

2728
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:22,190
It has to be Mausandra here.

2729
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:33,610
What do we need sure for to do it back at base again?

2730
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:41,650
Oh, we need to make the large pal bed, but I don't...

2731
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:44,330
You might be able to be that.

2732
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:45,330
No, I'm not.

2733
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:46,930
I'm not the level.

2734
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:48,330
I mean, I could get there eventually.

2735
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:51,050
Also, we have 60 gigas in base.

2736
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:51,730
Okay.

2737
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:53,830
Yeah, I'm gonna come collect them soon.

2738
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:55,470
Yeah, level 36.

2739
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:57,930
We need to make high quality cloth as well.

2740
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:59,810
When does that recipe unlock?

2741
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:02,930
That's well, obviously below 480.

2742
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:05,870
Let me see if I can make any.

2743
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:06,750
Oh, we need a cooking station.

2744
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:10,690
Yeah, we need sure for it to be back for cooking station so we can make the burgers and stuff.

2745
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:11,450
Yeah.

2746
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:12,010
Yeah.

2747
01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:13,670
High quality cloth is also 36.

2748
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:18,930
I think like priority right now is the cooking station because that's like two achievements done.

2749
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:19,970
Yeah.

2750
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:20,570
Okay.

2751
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:22,430
So you can come back with that.

2752
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:24,390
But the cooking station requires us to make like, hold on.

2753
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:31,850
The cooking station is like, you have to get the circuit boards to make the electric kitchen.

2754
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:36,790
You have to be level 41 and then you need to have refined ingot circuit boards.

2755
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:38,530
Well, so it's...

2756
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:39,310
You got refined ingots?

2757
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:40,710
Okay.

2758
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:42,650
Oh, there you go.

2759
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:45,790
Circuit boards is the main problem because you can't like pure quartz.

2760
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:47,110
You have to kind of just like get.

2761
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:48,510
That's getting taken care of.

2762
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:49,350
Okay, pure quartz.

2763
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:49,950
Okay.

2764
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:50,430
I...

2765
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:50,690
Yeah.

2766
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,730
And that's in the ice area.

2767
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:54,110
Ice pile.

2768
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:54,330
Yeah.

2769
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:54,890
Okay.

2770
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:56,010
I can get that later.

2771
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:57,690
Okay.

2772
01:32:57,710 --> 01:32:58,470
What is wrong with this pile?

2773
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:01,250
I found four fucking dudes.

2774
01:33:01,730 --> 01:33:03,790
Where are the female Masandras?

2775
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:06,450
Holy shit.

2776
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:07,910
This is why pandas are endangered.

2777
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:09,970
Jesus Christ.

2778
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:11,590
There's so many fucking bees.

2779
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:12,150
They have no bitches.

2780
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:13,490
They got no bitches.

2781
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:14,290
There's no bitches anywhere.

2782
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:16,210
Where did all the guys come from?

2783
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,040
I'm literally just flying around trying to fucking kill them.

2784
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:25,600
Find the bitches.

2785
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,800
What do I need to build while I'm here?

2786
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:33,840
Pallet bed and high quality cloth if you can.

2787
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:35,640
The large pallet bed.

2788
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,540
Both at level 36.

2789
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:39,780
We need two large pallet beds and also cloth.

2790
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:40,960
Do we have the material?

2791
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:42,480
Oh no, we need the high quality.

2792
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:45,720
You're the only one who can make the material and the bed.

2793
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,600
We need to make two of them as well.

2794
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:49,780
Do we have enough wool?

2795
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,280
Yeah, we have a lot of wool.

2796
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,960
Yeah, we're fucking good at wool.

2797
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:58,920
Just like in real life, it's so hard to find women.

2798
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,020
Am I in the area for this now?

2799
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,580
No comment.

2800
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:10,480
Maybe that's like a Malzandra Tinder or something.

2801
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,720
Just swipe a bit to find a female.

2802
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,260
Wait, what are you going to say sure for?

2803
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,960
We have a bunch of coal to make carbon fiber.

2804
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,540
Have we been making coal?

2805
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:21,900
I think we... I just dropped like a hundred coal.

2806
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:22,520
We have.

2807
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,080
No?

2808
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,040
We need to make more.

2809
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,160
All charcoal, fuck.

2810
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:31,260
No, I've been... I've been making... I've been doing all breeding.

2811
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,200
I should fly out and just get that started though.

2812
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:35,420
Oh, we don't have coal at all?

2813
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,340
Oh shit.

2814
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:42,440
Once I make... once I make this cake, I will go down there and start making it.

2815
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,380
I'll go make the base for coal.

2816
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,080
I guess I don't care if I get hit.

2817
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,020
I need to make a tropical outfit.

2818
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:53,460
Oh shit.

2819
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,900
I've basically become a glorified pal.

2820
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,240
Because all you're doing is working.

2821
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:08,280
The past hour and a half I'm just like, yeah, I'm mining and chopping trees and working the pal spear bench.

2822
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:08,880
Yup.

2823
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,660
My favourite pal, Lily.

2824
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,440
That's my favourite pal.

2825
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:16,920
Don't worry, that's how some people are on other teams too.

2826
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,080
You're not the only one.

2827
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:19,880
Don't worry.

2828
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,980
Yeah, I'm pretty sure about four people in each team.

2829
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:25,440
Yeah, he was like, well, one of them at least is banished to pal the room.

2830
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:32,800
Alright, I'm gonna... since we don't have the mossandra, I'm gonna fly out and start making the coal base.

2831
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:33,720
Yeah, yeah, just go make that.

2832
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:34,240
Finally!

2833
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:38,500
I'm just gonna keep trying to find a fucking mossandra.

2834
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:41,120
What a type of hands.

2835
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,740
Oh shit, Vanworm, you're fucking dying.

2836
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:49,600
Vanworm... better than Vanworm, they've got the... what is it called?

2837
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:50,020
The beacon?

2838
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:51,440
Oh, but I'm not level 34!

2839
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:52,840
I'm not level 34.

2840
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:53,300
Okay.

2841
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:54,820
That sucks.

2842
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:58,800
Where the fuck are you?

2843
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,840
All I see are the fucking gorillas.

2844
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,720
Alright, I'm gonna leave... I'm gonna leave Ignis here.

2845
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:08,000
And take back this fucking panda.

2846
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:14,850
And let me grab...

2847
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:19,200
My worm.

2848
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,880
There has to be a female somewhere!

2849
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:29,060
Alright, uh... you suggested the place by the Anubis.

2850
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:30,840
Um...

2851
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,000
Let me just take a look at my thing.

2852
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,800
No, don't shoot him, please.

2853
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:42,100
Oh, the first one is where I built my base.

2854
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:42,440
Hmm.

2855
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,120
But this...

2856
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:44,400
I found a...

2857
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,880
The one near the Anubis is the base one.

2858
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:46,240
Yes!

2859
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:47,840
Oh yeah, you go anywhere.

2860
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,480
The Anubis is technically in like a less dangerous location.

2861
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:52,040
It's only got six nodes.

2862
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,560
They said that there's a place in the deep sand dunes that has eight nodes.

2863
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,680
And it's like a little bit of a cold, but I don't know if it really matters that much.

2864
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,400
Well, the first picture I linked is a place where there's a waypoint.

2865
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,600
And you can fly to the top left mountain.

2866
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,420
And you don't even need to make a base.

2867
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:04,700
Oh, okay.

2868
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:05,200
Oh, okay.

2869
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:06,220
That's convenient.

2870
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,400
Alright, I'm just gonna try to get over there then.

2871
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,920
Cause I don't have any waypoints out that way yet.

2872
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:15,320
Yeah, just head there.

2873
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:20,600
Negative 125, negative 84, negative 125...

2874
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:23,620
125, 84...

2875
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:25,880
Okay.

2876
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:28,940
Alright, nice.

2877
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:29,740
Okay, I got the...

2878
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:30,080
Please don't be dismal!

2879
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:32,440
Oh!

2880
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:34,380
Alright, I got the female.

2881
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:37,840
I'm just gonna put it in base whenever you're ready to breed it.

2882
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:38,260
I don't...

2883
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,740
I'm just gonna...

2884
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:40,860
Actually, I can breed it for us.

2885
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:41,240
Oh, you got it?

2886
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,760
Yeah, I'll do the breeding for us.

2887
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:42,840
Oh, we can breed it then?

2888
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:43,100
Yeah, yeah.

2889
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,880
Put it in the...

2890
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,220
I've got the wolf.

2891
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:47,980
I'll put the wolf up.

2892
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,000
I did it.

2893
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,300
I got the female.

2894
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:55,320
Now I can...

2895
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:55,560
Fuck!

2896
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,120
Okay, I got the wolf.

2897
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,320
Give me a second.

2898
01:37:59,420 --> 01:37:59,880
Alright.

2899
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:05,950
Thank you.

2900
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:13,210
I'm just getting... heading to the waypoint and then I'll pass over... pass it over.

2901
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,300
Is that all we need for breeding?

2902
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,140
Or do we need anything else?

2903
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:20,920
Yeah, yeah.

2904
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:21,820
Nope.

2905
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:22,800
That's all we need.

2906
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,820
There's cake in there already.

2907
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,360
Um, we just need them to make a grizzbolt.

2908
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,060
Alright.

2909
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,400
Heading down.

2910
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,060
Making my way downtown.

2911
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,120
At the two hour mark, we should just do the dungeons.

2912
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:37,540
Okay.

2913
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,180
Sounds good.

2914
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:44,140
Alright, I gotta go... I gotta leave base for a bit and go make the other base.

2915
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:44,660
Alright.

2916
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:48,160
I'm just going to put...

2917
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:53,240
Actually, you can... you can do the breeding right now since you're here and I'm here.

2918
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:53,620
Okay.

2919
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,460
Alright, cool.

2920
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,000
Um...

2921
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:56,920
Who do we get rid of?

2922
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,240
Um...

2923
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:01,680
You can get rid of... I'll just move this guy out for right now.

2924
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:02,860
There you go.

2925
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:03,420
Open spot.

2926
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:07,440
Alright, I'm gonna go do the second tower.

2927
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,160
No, come back.

2928
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:09,840
No, come here.

2929
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:11,040
Where you going?

2930
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,200
Where you going?

2931
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:13,240
Let's do the second tower.

2932
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,240
Come back!

2933
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,360
Okay, I got him.

2934
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:18,680
Faction tower.

2935
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,420
Faction tower to location.

2936
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:22,880
Let's go.

2937
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:23,700
Let's go breed.

2938
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,120
It is time for you to breed.

2939
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:27,780
Powered.

2940
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,260
Where the fuck is the second tower?

2941
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:33,780
Can't be assigned?

2942
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:34,900
What do you mean can't be assigned?

2943
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:35,520
Yes you can.

2944
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,100
What do you mean?

2945
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:38,560
Yes you can.

2946
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:41,620
Sometimes the hitbox seems to clip over other shit.

2947
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:42,380
Breeding failed.

2948
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:43,140
The what hitbox?

2949
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,820
The like when you try to assign the power sometimes the hitbox seems to overlap.

2950
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,140
Yeah?

2951
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:48,620
with other shit.

2952
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,060
Oh.

2953
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,320
What the fuck does that mean?

2954
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:51,640
Hold on.

2955
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:52,440
It can't be assigned.

2956
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:53,880
That's weird.

2957
01:39:53,960 --> 01:40:01,920
With breeding where you have to take out... you have to like put two females in and to like make it unbug.

2958
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,380
I don't know the bugs are really annoying.

2959
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,780
Yeah that sounds really annoying.

2960
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,660
It says it needs it's not compatible with cooling.

2961
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,780
Wait what?

2962
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,600
I don't... what the fuck does that mean?

2963
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,380
What?

2964
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,320
What does that Are you fucking kidding?

2965
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,180
What the fuck does that mean?

2966
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,680
There's three misandras in front of me.

2967
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:20,200
I fucking...

2968
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,460
Okay.

2969
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,360
I literally just found more misandras.

2970
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,180
Okay.

2971
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:30,620
Okay.

2972
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,320
Now it says nobody's at the breeding... okay.

2973
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,420
Just take them out and put it back in.

2974
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:37,860
Yeah I'm taking them out.

2975
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:38,840
And that should fix it.

2976
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,700
I assign you to a tree.

2977
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:43,320
I assign you to literally whatever.

2978
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,980
Just get out of there.

2979
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:45,920
Okay.

2980
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:47,680
Okay.

2981
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:48,380
Again.

2982
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:52,740
Go Lily.

2983
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,020
Go Lily Go Lily pal.

2984
01:40:54,020 --> 01:41:01,240
It keeps saying I can't put the the panda in there because of instability with cooling.

2985
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:02,480
Huh?

2986
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,400
Yeah just try and put like two females in there.

2987
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:07,660
That one is a female though.

2988
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:08,480
Just unbug it.

2989
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,580
Just unbug it and then see what happens.

2990
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,820
Yeah the panda is a female though so it should be able to...

2991
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:16,200
Okay.

2992
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:22,100
If it says that coolant it usually means that they're on break and they need to wander around for a bit.

2993
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,220
That's what some of my chat says.

2994
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:24,680
Oh okay okay okay.

2995
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,160
They're too madged to fuck.

2996
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:29,800
Yeah.

2997
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,600
They need a break.

2998
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,380
Can I like force them to sit in the old tent?

2999
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,020
Whoa.

3000
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,780
Whoa whoa whoa.

3001
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:39,740
Whoa.

3002
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,900
Love is supposed to be natural.

3003
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:44,500
Hey hey hey.

3004
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:45,760
Consent is sexy.

3005
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,820
I said to go on a spa date.

3006
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,520
I said go on a spa date.

3007
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,620
I didn't say that.

3008
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:51,600
Whoa.

3009
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:56,480
I don't know if you're a right fit for this team now.

3010
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:58,000
What the heck?

3011
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:59,780
What the heck?

3012
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,320
After all I've done for this team?

3013
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:06,380
HR needs to speak to you real quick after that.

3014
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,780
When did we hire HR?

3015
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:12,140
Ever since you talk about consent.

3016
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:14,540
Ever since you talk about consent.

3017
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:14,800
Man.

3018
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,080
Not again.

3019
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,060
Alright.

3020
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:21,060
I'm gonna see if I can fucking do this boss battle.

3021
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,660
Okay I can put her in here now.

3022
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,000
So that's it.

3023
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:26,180
That's like a good sign maybe?

3024
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,240
Wait I wanna take my cake back.

3025
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,040
Alright.

3026
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:35,680
I don't know if I'm high enough level for this but we'll see.

3027
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:36,760
Alright.

3028
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:37,300
Back to start.

3029
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,240
We don't have a choice.

3030
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,660
Trust the process chat.

3031
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,800
Trust the process.

3032
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:41,700
Trust the pal.

3033
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,660
Trust Lily.

3034
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:44,280
She is a certified pal.

3035
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:44,860
Best pal.

3036
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:45,880
I'm a certified pal.

3037
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:48,080
I've been accepted into the pal world.

3038
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:48,960
Look I'm one of them.

3039
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,000
I can't even tell the difference.

3040
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:55,920
I don't know if I'm like high enough level for this boss.

3041
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,140
I don't know if I'm like high enough level for this boss.

3042
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,720
I don't know if I'm like high enough level for this boss.

3043
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:00,880
Alright.

3044
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:01,220
Alright.

3045
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,820
Maybe now they don't need a break?

3046
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:04,480
Maybe now they don't need a break?

3047
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:07,980
We gonna find out.

3048
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:09,140
We gonna find out.

3049
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:10,060
67 ,000?

3050
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:10,680
Okay wait maybe?

3051
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,440
Oh my god I'm fighting Lily.

3052
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,020
Oh my god I'm fighting Lily.

3053
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:18,580
Don't fight Lily?

3054
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:18,580
Lily?

3055
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:19,580
Join us?

3056
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:20,380
What's happening?

3057
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:21,320
We're just mad!

3058
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:22,100
Come on, let's go!

3059
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,120
Yo, beat them the fuck up.

3060
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,220
Yeah, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.

3061
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:26,440
Beat the fuck up.

3062
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:31,260
So I need to talk to HR, but that's fine?

3063
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:34,640
Look, I've been...

3064
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,560
Look, you're too new here to do that, you know?

3065
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,820
You don't know that I am, but...

3066
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,560
You're too new here right now.

3067
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:44,940
You have to be more established to be able to beat up Lily.

3068
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,960
Alright, it looks like it unbugs.

3069
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,300
Aw hell yeah!

3070
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,360
They're in love!

3071
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:52,140
Whoops.

3072
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,860
Wait, no, I'm not trying to pet you right now.

3073
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:54,900
Please let me Orion you, what the heck?

3074
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:58,100
Just kidding, I think I just put both of the...

3075
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:58,540
Wait, yes!

3076
01:43:58,620 --> 01:43:59,000
Hell yeah!

3077
01:43:59,100 --> 01:43:59,460
Alright, cool.

3078
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,720
They're making a baby.

3079
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:01,840
Oh, thank you.

3080
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:04,580
Okay.

3081
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:08,520
While they do that, I'm gonna go make the coal base.

3082
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:10,620
Please.

3083
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:16,670
Please, Lily.

3084
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:17,110
Leave me alone.

3085
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:20,730
Oh no.

3086
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:21,290
Alright.

3087
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:22,590
Oh no, I'm poisoned.

3088
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:25,290
I need some food for myself, and then I can go...

3089
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:26,390
Can I make another cake?

3090
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:30,250
I actually don't know if I can kill this in time.

3091
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:30,350
Oh no!

3092
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:30,870
I need egg!

3093
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:31,810
I need egg.

3094
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:34,610
Oh no, we need fucking... what the...

3095
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:36,510
We need so much stuff.

3096
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:37,510
It's never done!

3097
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:40,270
It's never over!

3098
01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:41,250
It's fucking never done.

3099
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:42,990
Now I know what they feel like.

3100
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:48,110
Now you know why they have zero rights.

3101
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:50,230
Now you know.

3102
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:51,110
Now I know, what the fuck?

3103
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,890
And they'll never get rights.

3104
01:44:56,010 --> 01:44:57,130
This is terrible.

3105
01:44:57,810 --> 01:44:58,730
This is capitalism.

3106
01:44:59,170 --> 01:45:00,250
Welcome to capitalism.

3107
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:02,570
Welcome to capitalism.

3108
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:05,930
Enjoy your stay, cause you have no other choice.

3109
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:08,610
I enjoyed my stay, I enjoyed my time.

3110
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:11,570
Thank you, capitalism.

3111
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:18,670
Oh my god, I don't think I can kill the second tower girl.

3112
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:20,830
She's way too strong.

3113
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:22,410
She wicked.

3114
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:24,850
My fucking towers are too fucking weak.

3115
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:30,190
She's like, oh no, she's too strong.

3116
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,690
Oh god, sweeper please, sweep sweep sweep.

3117
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:34,370
She's like, oh no, she'll beat me up.

3118
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:36,370
She's gonna beat me up.

3119
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:38,250
Sweep sweep sweep.

3120
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:43,070
I would hate to know where that tower is where this girl's beating you up.

3121
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:45,690
I just want to know so I can avoid it.

3122
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:48,450
That sounds terrible, you know, like oh my goodness.

3123
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:52,870
Come on sweeper, you're so tanky.

3124
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:53,470
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

3125
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:58,010
I'm at 40,000 out of 70.

3126
01:45:59,110 --> 01:46:00,530
We're slowly getting there.

3127
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:03,890
All right, cool, cool, cool.

3128
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:04,310
All right.

3129
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:07,910
I'm so close.

3130
01:46:09,850 --> 01:46:10,650
Go penking.

3131
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:13,230
You're our last hope.

3132
01:46:14,490 --> 01:46:15,230
Go penking.

3133
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:18,230
Do we have the other, the Anubis yet?

3134
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:20,390
Uh, they're both hatching.

3135
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,030
They're still not hatched?

3136
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:23,870
No, they take 40 minutes each.

3137
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:25,970
Jesus Christ, they're so fucking tanky.

3138
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:27,590
I know, that's why I've been stuck at the base.

3139
01:46:27,690 --> 01:46:28,450
I've just been doing breeding.

3140
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:30,730
Wait, is the Anubis the longest one to breed?

3141
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:32,070
Or is the others?

3142
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:34,090
The large eggs are all the same.

3143
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:34,190
They're all the same.

3144
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:37,470
We've got one more minute left on the first Anubis egg.

3145
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:37,950
Okay.

3146
01:46:37,950 --> 01:46:38,230
Which is true.

3147
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:39,670
I think that's good because then I can put in the next egg.

3148
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:40,110
So...

3149
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:42,610
Which is the...

3150
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:45,850
Because we need to make sure we have enough time to breed the other ones too.

3151
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:46,510
Yeah.

3152
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:48,410
I think we're gonna be like giddy giddy okay.

3153
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:49,770
It just depends on...

3154
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:51,770
Well, we can make a third incubator.

3155
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:54,550
We need one for the Grizz that I'm trying to hatch.

3156
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:54,950
Okay.

3157
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:58,450
I can make it the moment I fucking beat up this Lily.

3158
01:46:58,890 --> 01:46:59,330
Okay.

3159
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:02,810
I'm gonna have to walk the fucking walk, fam.

3160
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:04,650
I see.

3161
01:47:05,530 --> 01:47:07,150
Why are you so tanky, Lily?

3162
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:07,570
Yeah.

3163
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:08,390
Just die already.

3164
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:13,190
It makes me a very hard to walk chopper man.

3165
01:47:13,730 --> 01:47:15,550
Lily, I need these points, Lily.

3166
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:17,450
Do it for the team, Lily.

3167
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:20,490
Can't even get the proper beating here.

3168
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:21,230
What the fuck, man?

3169
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:23,890
Oh my gosh.

3170
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:26,090
These are the worst conditions I have to live with.

3171
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:29,370
All

3172
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:33,460
right.

3173
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:35,780
Wait, we're gonna check it.

3174
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:36,200
You guys ready?

3175
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,040
You ready?

3176
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:37,380
You ready to clip?

3177
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,920
Three, two, one.

3178
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,420
Incubation.

3179
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:41,740
Incubation complete.

3180
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,780
I'm pulling out the huge rocky egg.

3181
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:45,280
If it's not Anubis, I...

3182
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,040
Hey!

3183
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,100
Clip, clip, clip!

3184
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:47,880
Clip, clip, clip!

3185
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:48,780
Anubis!

3186
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:49,200
Clip, clip, clip!

3187
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:50,420
There's our first Anubis.

3188
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:51,740
Clip, clip, clip.

3189
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:52,740
Clip, clip, clip.

3190
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:53,460
All right.

3191
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:56,760
Oh shit.

3192
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:01,500
This is the last tree that I chopped 1500 wood.

3193
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,640
Jesus Christ.

3194
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,160
That should last us a good 10 minutes.

3195
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:07,780
.

3196
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:08,360
.

3197
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:08,720
.

3198
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:09,280
.

3199
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:11,320
.

3200
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:12,260
I need more.

3201
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,080
I really need eggs.

3202
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,640
Did I say you killed Verdash already?

3203
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,940
Yeah, I killed Verdash already.

3204
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,540
Verdash is the only thing I killed.

3205
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:22,000
Or like captured.

3206
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:23,340
Verdash is the only one I captured.

3207
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:23,740
Gosh.

3208
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:24,380
Hell yeah.

3209
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:24,940
Okay, cool.

3210
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:26,540
All right.

3211
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,320
I'm leaving that cake.

3212
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,520
I'm gonna grab the egg and then I need to go do coal.

3213
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:32,700
Oh shit.

3214
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:33,420
Oops, daydream.

3215
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:34,680
Bye bye.

3216
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,160
Please have baby.

3217
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:39,040
Okay, they're gonna go to sleep.

3218
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:39,640
Yeah, fuck that.

3219
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,060
I'm gonna go.

3220
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:40,780
Oh shit.

3221
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,860
I'm gonna go.

3222
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:50,460
Come on, Vanworm.

3223
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,120
Do we have the crusher to make fragments?

3224
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:55,640
Yeah, we have the crusher already being used.

3225
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:57,060
Nice.

3226
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,660
Oh my god, 20k.

3227
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,000
Come on, 20k in four minutes, please.

3228
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,080
What the heck is it?

3229
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:09,280
Not the life.

3230
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:12,720
Is this the crusher?

3231
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:13,300
Yes.

3232
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:19,950
All right, pals.

3233
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:21,710
I respect that you need food.

3234
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:23,170
But I also need food, so...

3235
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:24,970
We're always gonna need food.

3236
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:26,050
I'm gonna just take some of that.

3237
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:26,830
Oh shit.

3238
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:30,150
I'm back to rock.

3239
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:31,750
Back to rock you go.

3240
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:33,210
Back to being a pal.

3241
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:34,290
Yeah.

3242
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:36,950
I love being a pal.

3243
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:38,590
Go, go Lily, go.

3244
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:42,590
All right, flying out.

3245
01:49:43,330 --> 01:49:43,810
Please.

3246
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:46,830
Why are you so tanky?

3247
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:51,110
Wait, do I need tropicals?

3248
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:52,570
Probably need tropicals.

3249
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:57,650
Chandra outfit, no.

3250
01:49:58,430 --> 01:49:59,390
Back to rock.

3251
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:00,970
I need my tropical clothes.

3252
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:05,270
How much rock have you farmed in total?

3253
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:06,710
I'm actually curious, Lily.

3254
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:14,250
Oh my goodness, like, I will pay good money to have someone go back and count all of what I've farmed.

3255
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:16,250
Just accumulate everything.

3256
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:17,870
Oh no.

3257
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:21,450
Just so I can feel accomplished.

3258
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:23,130
My dad is a fan.

3259
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:25,370
We're done because I wanted to know how you're doing.

3260
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:26,930
Well, we got the Anubis now.

3261
01:50:26,930 --> 01:50:28,850
And he's like flying through rock.

3262
01:50:29,030 --> 01:50:29,410
Nice.

3263
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:30,250
That's good.

3264
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:33,250
So that should help a little.

3265
01:50:35,610 --> 01:50:37,550
Oh no, I can't even aim anymore.

3266
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:38,730
What the fuck is going on?

3267
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:40,110
No.

3268
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:40,670
Noob down.

3269
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:41,870
No.

3270
01:50:42,330 --> 01:50:42,810
Who's that?

3271
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:45,330
Better pals for mining?

3272
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:45,990
I don't know.

3273
01:50:46,050 --> 01:50:46,770
I'm level 23.

3274
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:47,670
What happened, Sherpoi?

3275
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:48,010
I don't have any options.

3276
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:50,290
I was saying you're a noob to keep an aim.

3277
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:52,310
Oh no, I'm not a noob.

3278
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:53,030
I'm almost killed.

3279
01:50:53,150 --> 01:50:53,870
I almost killed her.

3280
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:58,070
I have two minutes left to kill it.

3281
01:50:58,330 --> 01:50:59,310
Sherpoi, why are you hungry?

3282
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:04,430
He's like, mother, I crave sustenance.

3283
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:07,350
We don't have time for you to be hungry right now.

3284
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:12,710
Oh god.

3285
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:14,850
Oh man.

3286
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:17,070
I am basically a farming pal.

3287
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:20,890
Wait, can I just take Anubis and manually farm with him?

3288
01:51:20,970 --> 01:51:22,610
Is that gonna be faster than Rush War?

3289
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:23,310
I have no idea.

3290
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:23,850
Maybe.

3291
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:30,190
I feel like this is the fastest Anubis is the fastest.

3292
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:31,570
Clip, clip, clip!

3293
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:32,870
I finished tower two!

3294
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:34,230
Let's go!

3295
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:35,550
Clip, clip, clip!

3296
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:37,770
Clip, clip, clip.

3297
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:39,070
Oh my god.

3298
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:39,870
We did it.

3299
01:51:42,610 --> 01:51:44,510
Okay, my entire team is hungry.

3300
01:51:44,510 --> 01:51:45,490
I didn't name these palts.

3301
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:48,490
Oh my god.

3302
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:50,570
If I named him, he would be called yeast infection.

3303
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:51,030
What?

3304
01:51:51,650 --> 01:51:52,090
What?

3305
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:53,310
Did I explain?

3306
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:54,290
What?

3307
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,290
Excuse me?

3308
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:58,350
Is there something that randomly popped into my mind?

3309
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:59,110
What can I say?

3310
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:03,970
It's just a little fun name I came up with.

3311
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:04,670
So fun.

3312
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:05,990
You can change it if you don't like it.

3313
01:52:06,030 --> 01:52:06,810
It's very fun.

3314
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:07,150
So fun.

3315
01:52:07,610 --> 01:52:07,830
Yeah.

3316
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:08,570
It's festive.

3317
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:09,830
I don't know.

3318
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:11,770
We can name him like UTI or something.

3319
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:13,270
Oh yeah.

3320
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:13,910
That's a really good option.

3321
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:15,950
What is going on with your life right now?

3322
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:17,030
I don't know.

3323
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:19,110
HDMI cable?

3324
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:19,850
Question mark.

3325
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:21,510
That's a good name.

3326
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:23,510
Is everything okay?

3327
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:26,110
I think so.

3328
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:26,970
Yeah.

3329
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:29,170
Why are people worried?

3330
01:52:30,170 --> 01:52:31,330
I'm a little worried.

3331
01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:33,770
I mean I wasn't 30 seconds ago but I will admit.

3332
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:35,470
Whoa.

3333
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:36,450
Come on.

3334
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:37,650
You're convinced now.

3335
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,590
Like it's a fitting name.

3336
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:42,370
Let's see.

3337
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:44,430
Oh wait now I saw food in this.

3338
01:52:44,770 --> 01:52:47,610
Yeah man I'm so upset my parents didn't name me UTI.

3339
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:49,010
That could have been my life.

3340
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:51,130
You could have had it all.

3341
01:52:51,130 --> 01:52:52,010
I don't think VTubers exist.

3342
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:53,350
I need like 9...

3343
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,370
Let me try and find my...

3344
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:55,970
Where the fuck is the crusher?

3345
01:52:56,130 --> 01:52:58,330
I really want it to be called Samsung Galaxy man.

3346
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:02,650
S7 Edge.

3347
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:05,070
I need to try and find the...

3348
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:05,930
Where's the crusher?

3349
01:53:06,010 --> 01:53:06,570
Is that the bottom?

3350
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:10,990
Crusher is in the corner close to the cliff.

3351
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:11,250
In the back?

3352
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:14,810
Yeah by the large cliff.

3353
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:16,410
By the large cliff.

3354
01:53:16,530 --> 01:53:18,390
I'm going to try and find the crusher.

3355
01:53:19,950 --> 01:53:20,550
Uh...

3356
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:22,130
Where the fuck?

3357
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:23,290
Oh there it is.

3358
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:26,810
Alright I can make...

3359
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:27,970
Another incubator.

3360
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:29,810
Nice.

3361
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:31,070
If you guys need it.

3362
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:34,250
Also I had to leave...

3363
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:36,470
Before they finished breeding because it's night time.

3364
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:38,110
But if you're there...

3365
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:39,990
In the daytime can you grab the egg?

3366
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:41,390
Um...

3367
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,710
We need another incubator.

3368
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:44,690
What eggs?

3369
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:48,270
Is there any eggs right now that can be...

3370
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:49,050
Put in the incubator?

3371
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:51,910
They're really close to giving birth.

3372
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:52,890
But they went to sleep.

3373
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:54,350
Okay so...

3374
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:57,450
Wait no there's an egg here.

3375
01:53:58,550 --> 01:53:59,690
Oh sweet alright.

3376
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:00,750
Can you pop that in the...

3377
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:03,470
Make another incubator if possible and pop that in there.

3378
01:54:03,690 --> 01:54:05,390
A huge electric egg.

3379
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:06,350
I'm putting that in.

3380
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:10,310
Alright here we go.

3381
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:15,770
And then we just have to hope that it's the right gender.

3382
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:18,090
Otherwise we gotta get another relaxasaurus too.

3383
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:18,570
Alright.

3384
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:20,390
I mean relaxasaurus is easy to catch.

3385
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:21,430
So I'm fine with that.

3386
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:24,150
Alright let's see how much time.

3387
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:25,530
Seven minutes till...

3388
01:54:26,650 --> 01:54:27,090
Okay...

3389
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:29,810
I'm trying to look at what we need right now.

3390
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:31,330
Um...

3391
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:33,310
Shurifor what are you doing right now?

3392
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:36,590
I'm doing stuff.

3393
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:37,450
Oh...

3394
01:54:37,450 --> 01:54:40,250
I don't have to cry.

3395
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:41,110
It's okay.

3396
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:44,370
It doesn't have to be first place.

3397
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:44,610
I am.

3398
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:47,070
What are you doing?

3399
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:48,850
What are you doing right now Shurifor?

3400
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:53,870
I was trying to see if the high quality cloth was finish making but it's not.

3401
01:54:55,030 --> 01:54:56,270
Now I'm waiting for day time.

3402
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:57,410
And I'm leveling.

3403
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:58,350
You're leveling?

3404
01:54:58,430 --> 01:54:59,170
What level are you right now?

3405
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:01,050
I'm 44.

3406
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:02,070
44?

3407
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:06,490
Actually that's the max we need for the base so...

3408
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:07,690
Let's see...

3409
01:55:07,690 --> 01:55:08,810
I'm trying to see...

3410
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,950
How many hours do we have left?

3411
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:12,110
We're 23 minutes till the 2 hour mark.

3412
01:55:12,550 --> 01:55:13,710
So we need to...

3413
01:55:13,710 --> 01:55:15,050
Let's see...

3414
01:55:15,870 --> 01:55:17,810
Trying to see...

3415
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:19,790
Maximum...

3416
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:22,430
I'm trying to see what I have to do right now.

3417
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:26,390
I'm going to try and catch some of the day 1...

3418
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:26,790
I'm going to try and catch some of the day 1...

3419
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:27,970
I'm going to do some of the day 1 bosses then.

3420
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:29,530
Um...

3421
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:30,810
Just to faster level up.

3422
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:33,810
Because for the higher level...

3423
01:55:34,650 --> 01:55:35,570
Bosses I need...

3424
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:37,330
Ultra spheres I think.

3425
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:39,010
Yeah.

3426
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:40,870
Wait what am I doing?

3427
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:42,230
Okay.

3428
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:44,430
Let's see...

3429
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:47,670
I'm going to do the day 1 stuff so I can level up to at least level...

3430
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:49,710
Level 40?

3431
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:52,490
And then...

3432
01:55:52,490 --> 01:55:53,590
Okay you didn't get the...

3433
01:55:53,590 --> 01:55:54,650
Prawn cherry right?

3434
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:56,690
I don't remember which ones we...

3435
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:58,070
Have we done nightwing?

3436
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:00,090
Oh there's a list somewhere in the discord.

3437
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:02,750
Actually my mods might be able to post it again.

3438
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:05,010
But they have a picture of all the stuff we did on day 1.

3439
01:56:05,110 --> 01:56:07,690
Yeah can you show me what we were missing in day...

3440
01:56:07,690 --> 01:56:09,930
Can PPMOD show me what we were missing in day 1 for the day 1?

3441
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:11,310
Yeah.

3442
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:14,490
So I can like breeze through it real quick for us.

3443
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:18,510
Um... I know like the prawn cherry we haven't...

3444
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:19,210
MVPPs.

3445
01:56:19,610 --> 01:56:20,970
Alright let me look up...

3446
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:21,990
You're my MVPPs.

3447
01:56:22,130 --> 01:56:22,730
Thank you.

3448
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:23,970
The global...

3449
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:28,070
Events whatever the most points anyways.

3450
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:31,050
Did we get the fen lope?

3451
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:31,990
Have we done the fen lope yet?

3452
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:34,270
Fen lope was bugged when I tried to...

3453
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:35,030
Oh yeah I remembered.

3454
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:37,030
Okay I'm gonna get the uni vault then.

3455
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,390
You haven't done the uni vault yet right?

3456
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:39,910
I don't think so.

3457
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:41,110
Alright I'll get that.

3458
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:45,030
Uhhhh the uni vault is...

3459
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:47,430
20 points.

3460
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:50,290
That's 20 points that we can get.

3461
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,160
Oh wait I need to get my...

3462
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,640
I forgot to grab my...

3463
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:00,480
Fucking...

3464
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:02,260
Vanworm.

3465
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:05,600
Vanworm are you done healing yourself yet?

3466
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:11,170
No.

3467
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:12,450
I have one more.

3468
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:15,290
Alright I guess I'll stay here and...

3469
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:17,390
Help out with the wood.

3470
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:18,810
Do we need wood or rock?

3471
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:19,770
More.

3472
01:57:20,050 --> 01:57:21,050
Let me see.

3473
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:24,010
How's Anubis pulling?

3474
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:26,290
He's doing amazing.

3475
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:27,270
Let's go!

3476
01:57:27,370 --> 01:57:28,570
I'll get some rock for us then.

3477
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:31,810
While we...

3478
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:34,370
I'll get some rock cause I don't have enough.

3479
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:35,810
I don't have my vanworm to...

3480
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:36,670
Grease through.

3481
01:57:38,270 --> 01:57:40,050
Actually I'll just fucking ride the dog.

3482
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:42,310
I won't waste time.

3483
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:46,990
I'll ride the dog over.

3484
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:47,330
I'll ride the dog over.

3485
01:57:48,010 --> 01:57:48,890
Oh shit.

3486
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:49,830
It's broken.

3487
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:51,650
Uhhhh...

3488
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:54,110
Oh crap.

3489
01:57:54,590 --> 01:57:56,130
Baby you do much.

3490
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:56,630
For now.

3491
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:01,770
Oh please don't fall vanworm.

3492
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,230
I know you can make it to this cliff.

3493
01:58:03,230 --> 01:58:05,430
Someone can hatch the other Anubis right now.

3494
01:58:05,510 --> 01:58:05,730
Someone can hatch the other Anubis right now.

3495
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:07,790
The other Anubis can be hatched.

3496
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:10,610
I'm not at the base yet.

3497
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:12,410
So Lily you should hatch it.

3498
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:13,870
Alright let's go.

3499
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:17,690
Chet says he's butter mining as well.

3500
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:20,710
Go make him work.

3501
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:22,610
The moment he's born that's his job.

3502
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:23,410
The moment he's born.

3503
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:24,870
Hello baby anyway.

3504
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:26,730
Into the mines you go.

3505
01:58:27,230 --> 01:58:29,530
Into the mines you go baby.

3506
01:58:30,290 --> 01:58:31,670
Put up the yearn for the mines.

3507
01:58:32,030 --> 01:58:33,210
You guys are laughing.

3508
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:36,470
You guys are laughing but that's what they did with children on farms.

3509
01:58:36,830 --> 01:58:38,650
Put up the yearn for the mines.

3510
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:39,270
That's true.

3511
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:42,770
Into the mines you go.

3512
01:58:42,950 --> 01:58:43,670
Into the mines you go baby.

3513
01:58:43,670 --> 01:58:46,930
As soon as you're twelve you're gonna be working on the farm.

3514
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:48,590
As soon as you're twelve you're gonna be working on the farm.

3515
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:50,490
As soon as you're twelve you're gonna be working on the farm.

3516
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:52,010
As God intended.

3517
01:58:53,250 --> 01:58:54,530
Perfect for the mines.

3518
01:58:55,230 --> 01:58:55,870
Alright.

3519
01:58:56,110 --> 01:58:59,150
Look if God didn't want them to work in the mines.

3520
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:00,710
Then kids should not exist.

3521
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:04,370
You sure?

3522
01:59:06,910 --> 01:59:08,870
I'm 100% sure.

3523
01:59:08,990 --> 01:59:09,230
I'm 100% sure.

3524
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:11,070
I think I went past where I was supposed to go.

3525
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:11,650
Wait no I didn't.

3526
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:15,570
Yes and my parents should have put me in the mines.

3527
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:17,790
Born to roam free.

3528
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:18,970
Forced to mine.

3529
01:59:21,570 --> 01:59:24,170
You see it hasn't been a bad thing.

3530
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:28,730
Also if we have the eggs we also need to make one more cake.

3531
01:59:29,250 --> 01:59:29,690
Also if we have the eggs we also need to make one more cake.

3532
01:59:29,690 --> 01:59:30,550
If anybody's on base.

3533
01:59:31,010 --> 01:59:32,410
And can make a cake.

3534
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:35,630
I can probably queue one up if you have one.

3535
01:59:35,870 --> 01:59:36,190
Okay.

3536
01:59:38,170 --> 01:59:39,150
Yeah I'm just.

3537
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:40,690
Oh wait we have a cake.

3538
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:43,090
Oh I'm going to get the relaxaura.

3539
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:44,310
You guys can catch the relaxaura.

3540
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:47,510
Catch some because then if we don't have the right gender.

3541
01:59:47,610 --> 01:59:48,190
It won't matter.

3542
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:49,470
Yeah yeah somebody.

3543
01:59:51,070 --> 01:59:51,610
Lily's there.

3544
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:52,610
Lily it's your job.

3545
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:56,630
It's time Lily.

3546
01:59:58,830 --> 02:00:00,150
I kept the balls away.

3547
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:01,730
There's more balls in the base.

3548
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:04,050
I'm dead.

3549
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:05,250
What you're dead?

3550
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:08,290
I'm fucking dead.

3551
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:10,650
I'm on level I just one shot me.

3552
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:13,170
I fell through the map.

3553
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:15,350
Lily no.

3554
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:18,510
What happened?

3555
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:21,470
They've got the list in discord by the way.

3556
02:00:21,530 --> 02:00:22,250
Okay nice.

3557
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:26,350
Under the sea.

3558
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:28,370
Under the sea.

3559
02:00:33,490 --> 02:00:34,710
She's swimming but she dead.

3560
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:36,910
I have a uni vault if we need it later.

3561
02:00:36,910 --> 02:00:38,910
To the shadow realm.

3562
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:40,750
Wild but only good.

3563
02:00:42,830 --> 02:00:44,010
You sure about that?

3564
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:44,990
Yes.

3565
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:46,870
Yes.

3566
02:00:52,530 --> 02:00:53,110
Mine.

3567
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:54,450
Back to work.

3568
02:00:56,330 --> 02:00:57,090
Work work.

3569
02:00:58,170 --> 02:00:59,910
It's time to get back to work.

3570
02:01:00,070 --> 02:01:00,610
Work work work.

3571
02:01:01,590 --> 02:01:02,170
Ow.

3572
02:01:03,870 --> 02:01:04,750
Sweep sweep sweep.

3573
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:07,550
Sweep sweep.

3574
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:11,070
That was fun.

3575
02:01:11,810 --> 02:01:13,970
Let's have some more of some time in some time soon.

3576
02:01:13,970 --> 02:01:16,850
Okay you really do sound like the voice from the game though.

3577
02:01:17,330 --> 02:01:17,890
You really do sound like the voice from the game though.

3578
02:01:18,490 --> 02:01:19,270
You really do sound like the voice from the game though.

3579
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:21,390
You can fess up.

3580
02:01:21,470 --> 02:01:23,250
You can just tell me that you're the guy from...

3581
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:26,330
Dude I would be a sick voice actor.

3582
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:27,790
You have 88 balls.

3583
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:29,550
Get a voice reel right now.

3584
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:30,670
And apply.

3585
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:32,450
I don't know how that fucking works.

3586
02:01:32,450 --> 02:01:35,270
Don't I have to join like some voice actors guild or some shit?

3587
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:36,850
No I don't think so.

3588
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:38,670
I think... use your clout.

3589
02:01:39,730 --> 02:01:41,070
No I ain't got clout.

3590
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:42,510
Just be like I'm a voice actor.

3591
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:44,170
I'm a voice actor.

3592
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:44,610
Done.

3593
02:01:45,130 --> 02:01:46,130
It's that easy.

3594
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:47,950
It's just that easy.

3595
02:01:49,390 --> 02:01:50,930
If you never try...

3596
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:53,030
If you never try you'll never get employed.

3597
02:01:54,030 --> 02:01:54,490
If you never try you'll never get employed.

3598
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:55,190
I don't wanna try.

3599
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:56,110
Why not?

3600
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:58,150
I just want everything to be given to me.

3601
02:01:58,150 --> 02:01:59,450
Alright I gotta talk to Cole.

3602
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:02,770
Spoken like a true content creator.

3603
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:11,720
I just need to make sure he doesn't fucking die.

3604
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:21,480
Alright come on.

3605
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:25,200
18% Clip clip clip.

3606
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:26,280

3607
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:29,820
I got uni vault.

Nice.

3609
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:38,430
How to become a voice actor.

3610
02:02:38,610 --> 02:02:39,090
Step 1.

3611
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:40,050
Declare intent.

3612
02:02:42,270 --> 02:02:43,570
It's just that easy.

3613
02:02:43,990 --> 02:02:44,330
Amazing.

3614
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:45,510
It's just that easy.

3615
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:48,070
I am voice actor.

3616
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:49,930
Hire me.

3617
02:02:50,410 --> 02:02:50,950
Done.

3618
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:54,250
Please accept me.

3619
02:02:54,370 --> 02:02:55,330
I'm so happy for you dude.

3620
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:58,690
This is my follower count.

3621
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:05,690
I'm pretty sure we have enough dragon types to do the dragon petting thing.

3622
02:03:05,970 --> 02:03:07,030
I think we have enough water dude.

3623
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:07,390
I think we have enough water too.

3624
02:03:07,410 --> 02:03:08,270
I'm pretty sure.

3625
02:03:10,030 --> 02:03:13,130
I think we should start petting at an hour mark.

3626
02:03:13,210 --> 02:03:14,970
I think at 2 hour mark we should do dungeons.

3627
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:17,510
I think we should start petting at an hour mark.

3628
02:03:17,550 --> 02:03:21,770
I met somebody's dead stuff location.

3629
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:23,870
Are you high enough level for the...

3630
02:03:23,870 --> 02:03:25,310
Oh wait you might be at my dead stuff.

3631
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:26,990
You are that's my dead stuff.

3632
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:30,990
Oh you're in my guild so yeah probably.

3633
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:33,470
I don't know if there's anything useful in there.

3634
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:36,030
I've recovered ever since but you can scout.

3635
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:39,170
I'm trying to look for a waypoint.

3636
02:03:39,290 --> 02:03:39,450
I'm trying to look for a waypoint.

3637
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:42,050
A dive of like pretty much nothing.

3638
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:43,570
What do we need for hyperspears?

3639
02:03:43,690 --> 02:03:45,210
Oh yeah I took it all.

3640
02:03:45,510 --> 02:03:47,790
What mats do you need for hyperspears?

3641
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:50,350
Let me see.

3642
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:52,490
I'm looking for...

3643
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:53,490
Cement.

3644
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:55,190
How do I make cement?

3645
02:03:57,330 --> 02:03:58,650
6 coal 1 stone.

3646
02:03:58,890 --> 02:03:59,870
6 coal 1 ore.

3647
02:03:59,970 --> 02:04:00,290
Okay okay.

3648
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:03,990
What mats do we need for hyperspears?

3649
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,450
I don't know what you're sure for.

3650
02:04:06,870 --> 02:04:09,370
I got a cover but I can't kill a mob.

3651
02:04:09,810 --> 02:04:11,870
I will just make sure we have the materials.

3652
02:04:12,490 --> 02:04:12,890
I will just make sure we have the materials.

3653
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:13,930
There's no fast travel over here.

3654
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:14,250
Wait what?

3655
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:19,230
Also your mods said they made a list but where is it?

3656
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:19,590
Also your mods said they made a list but where is it?

3657
02:04:21,310 --> 02:04:21,710
Uhhhh...

3658
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:24,010
There's no list in here.

3659
02:04:24,150 --> 02:04:25,270
I can just copy paste it.

3660
02:04:25,350 --> 02:04:27,850
I think they didn't even post it.

3661
02:04:27,970 --> 02:04:28,650
No I think they...

3662
02:04:28,650 --> 02:04:32,650
I think they posted in the wrong chat.

3663
02:04:32,830 --> 02:04:33,310
There you go.

3664
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:34,290
Okay.

3665
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:35,530
Alright I need...

3666
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:36,390
Chill it?

3667
02:04:36,490 --> 02:04:41,690
Can you give me a list of those we need to do?

3668
02:04:41,870 --> 02:04:43,030
Cause that's easier for me.

3669
02:04:43,970 --> 02:04:44,590
For day 1.

3670
02:04:45,410 --> 02:04:47,590
Cause that's easier for me to keep track.

3671
02:04:48,890 --> 02:04:51,790
I'm gonna capture 2 black mercuteers.

3672
02:04:52,750 --> 02:04:53,710
For us now.

3673
02:04:53,890 --> 02:04:55,190
Cause that's something I can do.

3674
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:56,790
Let me take a look at the DM.

3675
02:04:57,010 --> 02:04:59,550
I'm gonna set the base now on the coal spot.

3676
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:01,290
Once I get a shot then some...

3677
02:05:01,290 --> 02:05:02,410
Twilight Dunes.

3678
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:04,550
I need the boss.

3679
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:07,150
Well I have...

3680
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:09,550
Twilight Dunes is on this little ridge.

3681
02:05:09,610 --> 02:05:10,790
88 gigaspears?

3682
02:05:10,830 --> 02:05:12,270
I can't make hyper.

3683
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:13,550
Yeah yeah.

3684
02:05:13,690 --> 02:05:16,170
Once I get the refined metal I'll make the hyper.

3685
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:18,190
How do you get refined metal again?

3686
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:19,930
We need coal.

3687
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:21,890
We still need coal.

3688
02:05:22,190 --> 02:05:22,770
Alright.

3689
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:25,070
I'm about to mine so I'm gonna say I can.

3690
02:05:27,850 --> 02:05:29,950
I'm gonna put away...

3691
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:31,650
Okay back to stone.

3692
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:33,010
Nice.

3693
02:05:33,990 --> 02:05:34,370
I'm gonna put all this in.

3694
02:05:34,670 --> 02:05:36,570
Black Mercuteers are tough.

3695
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:39,190
Well I have to do it for the team.

3696
02:05:41,410 --> 02:05:41,890
Sandworm.

3697
02:05:47,230 --> 02:05:48,510
I know I'm starving.

3698
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:49,410
I don't know.

3699
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:52,670
Whoever told me it's easier to manually mine with Anubis.

3700
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:53,570
I feel like you're...

3701
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:56,710
I feel like my boar was more effective.

3702
02:05:58,270 --> 02:06:00,010
Maybe you're not doing it right.

3703
02:06:00,010 --> 02:06:01,610
I feel like this should get all of these stones.

3704
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:02,890
Maybe.

3705
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:03,650
Okay hold up.

3706
02:06:03,730 --> 02:06:07,190
Wait let me put him into the base cause I feel like he's more useful in here.

3707
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:09,390
I'm starting.

3708
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:13,590
To do the stone mining in here for now.

3709
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:16,970
While I'll get my manual stone.

3710
02:06:17,010 --> 02:06:17,950
Wait that's not...

3711
02:06:17,950 --> 02:06:19,250
That's not coal.

3712
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:22,130
Um.

3713
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:23,870
They don't need this.

3714
02:06:23,970 --> 02:06:24,930
So I'm gonna eat it.

3715
02:06:27,790 --> 02:06:29,490
Oh no stop being hungry.

3716
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:30,750
Isn't he a low level?

3717
02:06:30,850 --> 02:06:32,170
That shouldn't matter for mining.

3718
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:34,770
He's not fighting a pal.

3719
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:35,550
He's just mining.

3720
02:06:35,850 --> 02:06:36,110
Ohhhh.

3721
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:39,690
Hold on my boar.

3722
02:06:40,090 --> 02:06:42,330
Where is one of the black marketeers?

3723
02:06:44,110 --> 02:06:44,790
Let's see.

3724
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:46,690
141?

3725
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:49,490
141.

3726
02:06:50,290 --> 02:06:50,730
404?

3727
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:52,910
It's supposed to be right here.

3728
02:06:53,130 --> 02:06:53,450
Hold on.

3729
02:06:53,630 --> 02:06:56,050
I'm trying to like figure out where the black marketeers are.

3730
02:06:57,590 --> 02:06:59,350
There's one right below our base.

3731
02:06:59,430 --> 02:06:59,550
Oh wait.

3732
02:06:59,690 --> 02:07:00,670
Yeah I'm trying to.

3733
02:07:01,550 --> 02:07:03,070
Oh it's this thing right here.

3734
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:04,770
Okay I got it.

3735
02:07:06,110 --> 02:07:07,090
Okay I see it.

3736
02:07:07,110 --> 02:07:07,690
I found the spot.

3737
02:07:08,150 --> 02:07:08,970
Is this it?

3738
02:07:12,290 --> 02:07:13,970
Is this the marker that?

3739
02:07:14,970 --> 02:07:15,810
I think so.

3740
02:07:15,910 --> 02:07:17,130
Alright I'm gonna see if I can catch him.

3741
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:19,330
Uhhh.

3742
02:07:19,990 --> 02:07:21,170
No that's not you.

3743
02:07:22,790 --> 02:07:23,230
Alright.

3744
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:26,090
I don't know what level they are.

3745
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:26,670
What level are they?

3746
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:29,090
The one underneath is 40.

3747
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:31,390
The rest are like 50 I think.

3748
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:32,110
I'm 36.

3749
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:33,430
I think that'll be fine.

3750
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:33,950
I'm 36.

3751
02:07:34,090 --> 02:07:34,570
It's fine.

3752
02:07:36,110 --> 02:07:37,530
It shouldn't be that bad right?

3753
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:39,250
Oh.

3754
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:41,730
Well that tokotoko is dead.

3755
02:07:41,810 --> 02:07:42,030
Yeah.

3756
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:46,410
Where am I?

3757
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:47,670
I'm walking the wrong way.

3758
02:07:47,690 --> 02:07:48,770
I always fly the wrong way.

3759
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:56,220
Cole can't be assigned.

3760
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:56,860
What?

3761
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:03,670
I need some wood.

3762
02:08:04,890 --> 02:08:07,250
I need hyperspears to catch the marketeers.

3763
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:08,250
I'll get you wood after.

3764
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:08,670
Probably.

3765
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:09,850
Does a gigaspear not work?

3766
02:08:10,490 --> 02:08:12,250
I'm getting some right now.

3767
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,810
It might just be a really really really low chance.

3768
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:14,530
Uhhh.

3769
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:16,570
You know I'm gonna risk it.

3770
02:08:17,810 --> 02:08:18,930
I'm gonna risk it.

3771
02:08:19,010 --> 02:08:19,830
It'll be fine.

3772
02:08:21,870 --> 02:08:27,250
I have enough gigaspears to fucking risk the catch.

3773
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:33,120
Wait what the fuck?

3774
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:33,680
I have a grenade?

3775
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,180
Throwing granata.

3776
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:36,980
Nice.

3777
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,500
I tried to go to punch and then a grenade came out.

3778
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:40,000
I was like ugh.

3779
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:43,320
Back to you.

3780
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,120
Bless you.

3781
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:46,340
Thank you.

3782
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:46,800
Thank you.

3783
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:48,700
Hello.

3784
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:52,940
You got her stuff?

3785
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:55,220
You're welcome.

3786
02:08:57,200 --> 02:08:58,700
Alright here we go.

3787
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:00,280
It's time to risk this.

3788
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:02,780
We'll be fine.

3789
02:09:06,930 --> 02:09:07,450
Alright.

3790
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:08,470
Cole.

3791
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:11,890
I put a pal box out here.

3792
02:09:11,930 --> 02:09:13,430
Now we've got a fast travel.

3793
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:13,970
What the fuck?

3794
02:09:14,410 --> 02:09:14,710
Okay.

3795
02:09:15,890 --> 02:09:16,790
Go do your thing.

3796
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:19,030
I was told we need wood.

3797
02:09:19,170 --> 02:09:19,830
I'll get wood.

3798
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:21,990
Oh he has a pal too?

3799
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:23,770
Yeah.

3800
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:24,890
And a machine gun.

3801
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:26,650
Oh my god my pal's almost dead.

3802
02:09:27,050 --> 02:09:28,970
Alright I stopped risking it.

3803
02:09:29,190 --> 02:09:30,750
You know, sure this is your job.

3804
02:09:30,810 --> 02:09:31,410
I'm not doing this.

3805
02:09:31,790 --> 02:09:33,330
How many jobs do I have?

3806
02:09:34,570 --> 02:09:35,050
Shit.

3807
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:36,850
This one too.

3808
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:38,230
Alright.

3809
02:09:39,710 --> 02:09:41,490
He is way too strapped.

3810
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:44,170
I'm so good at mining that I've got in my party right now.

3811
02:09:44,650 --> 02:09:45,130
Wait.

3812
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:46,830
Can they not mine the coal?

3813
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:49,730
I can come mine the coal.

3814
02:09:49,730 --> 02:09:52,410
I put Tom bat out here but Tom bat's not doing anything.

3815
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:55,490
I need more nails for the large power bed.

3816
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:57,110
I need more nails for the large power bed.

3817
02:09:57,110 --> 02:09:57,590
You need more nails?

3818
02:09:57,810 --> 02:09:57,990
Okay.

3819
02:09:58,630 --> 02:10:00,550
We need ore for that right?

3820
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:01,990
Yeah.

3821
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:05,430
Just iron.

3822
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:07,830
No we need ingots.

3823
02:10:08,070 --> 02:10:08,770
Ingot's okay.

3824
02:10:08,770 --> 02:10:10,530
You can queue up some ingots.

3825
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:13,610
I held off because I wasn't sure how much we need for the refined.

3826
02:10:13,610 --> 02:10:14,570
They can mine coal but you have to take away the mining station.

3827
02:10:14,570 --> 02:10:16,130
I just made a bunch of refined ingots.

3828
02:10:16,590 --> 02:10:18,590
No you need level 3 for coal.

3829
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:20,490
You need level 3 pals.

3830
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:21,650
Mining.

3831
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:22,710
That's what they said.

3832
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:23,730
Okay okay.

3833
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:26,770
Who can we get that's level 3?

3834
02:10:27,110 --> 02:10:27,890
I'll just...

3835
02:10:27,890 --> 02:10:28,450
Anubis?

3836
02:10:29,650 --> 02:10:31,530
Anubis is but I wanna try something.

3837
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:35,070
Okay I'm gonna need one of the Anubis's here to start getting coal.

3838
02:10:35,190 --> 02:10:35,770
Where can I make Palmer?

3839
02:10:36,270 --> 02:10:36,710
Palmer?

3840
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:39,110
On the map.

3841
02:10:39,230 --> 02:10:40,910
You'll need tropical clothes to come out here though.

3842
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:43,090
You need Palmer?

3843
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:44,230
Sure for?

3844
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:48,010
But I have your stuff so if you had tropical clothes then...

3845
02:10:48,010 --> 02:10:49,270
I did not have that.

3846
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:49,550
Okay.

3847
02:10:49,970 --> 02:10:51,450
It's time for Google.

3848
02:10:51,690 --> 02:10:54,990
I'll just very quickly try something and see if that works.

3849
02:10:55,330 --> 02:10:56,230
I have chat.

3850
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:57,690
You have chat?

3851
02:10:57,810 --> 02:11:02,310
I have indeed mine coal so if you can make me clothes I can already get started.

3852
02:11:02,310 --> 02:11:02,630
Alright let's go.

3853
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:03,570
Okay I'll make you that.

3854
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:05,090
Alright.

3855
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:05,410
Okay.

3856
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:09,070
What's that?

3857
02:11:11,130 --> 02:11:12,070
PP mud!

3858
02:11:13,390 --> 02:11:14,390
PP mud!

3859
02:11:14,850 --> 02:11:17,130
You... information is not correct!

3860
02:11:17,490 --> 02:11:18,510
You're in for...

3861
02:11:18,510 --> 02:11:20,050
Wait actually...

3862
02:11:20,050 --> 02:11:21,130
Wait Univolt.

3863
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:22,330
Yeah we captured Univolt.

3864
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:22,550
Yeah.

3865
02:11:23,310 --> 02:11:24,870
What do you mean you don't see a clip?

3866
02:11:25,210 --> 02:11:26,350
I said clip clip clip!

3867
02:11:27,990 --> 02:11:28,990
Your mod...

3868
02:11:28,990 --> 02:11:30,840
Your mod fucking missed the Univolt.

3869
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:33,190
Here Shy Lily I'm just gonna give you mine.

3870
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:34,330
Okay okay.

3871
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:37,590
Can you bring it to me?

3872
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:38,750
Yeah I'm just gonna...

3873
02:11:38,770 --> 02:11:40,870
I'm gonna drop this... I'm gonna like drop it on the ground.

3874
02:11:41,090 --> 02:11:41,470
Eh.

3875
02:11:42,070 --> 02:11:42,550
Eh.

3876
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:44,530
Oh god.

3877
02:11:44,710 --> 02:11:45,890
Is everything okay there?

3878
02:11:46,090 --> 02:11:46,650
Come on!

3879
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:47,730
You can do it!

3880
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:48,690
I'm Q-Comfort!

3881
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:49,890
You can do it!

3882
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:51,590
What the fuck is this game?

3883
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:54,810
I'm gonna fly back and I'll come back and make some stuff.

3884
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:55,870
What do we need here?

3885
02:11:56,230 --> 02:11:59,130
I'll finish the coal and I'll return to base.

3886
02:11:59,210 --> 02:11:59,490
Okay.

3887
02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:00,350
And then I'll do rock.

3888
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:01,350
Okay okay.

3889
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:04,270
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna make...

3890
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:05,550
another trap of it.

3891
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:07,410
Sweet!

3892
02:12:08,130 --> 02:12:09,590
Can you guys link the...

3893
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:11,750
the clip of me catching...

3894
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:13,410
Univolt for the mod?

3895
02:12:14,490 --> 02:12:15,350
Oh niggah.

3896
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:17,570
Alright.

3897
02:12:17,610 --> 02:12:18,810
How's it going with the breeding?

3898
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:20,870
Uh...

3899
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:21,730
Well I'm not there.

3900
02:12:21,870 --> 02:12:23,050
I'm fucking doing bosses.

3901
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:24,230
Okay.

3902
02:12:26,150 --> 02:12:26,750
Alright.

3903
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:28,250
I'm taking a look.

3904
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:29,690
Okay.

3905
02:12:29,710 --> 02:12:31,130
The Narcissist is here.

3906
02:12:31,710 --> 02:12:32,310
Alright.

3907
02:12:32,490 --> 02:12:33,090
So we have...

3908
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:34,130
We already have this one going.

3909
02:12:34,290 --> 02:12:36,350
We've got a Grizz that's set to hatch.

3910
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:38,970
Uh... So I think we're good.

3911
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:40,950
Let's see...

3912
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:43,090
I'm getting the Lunaris for us.

3913
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:45,350
We're at the 12th place right now.

3914
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:47,290
But we also have like not been getting...

3915
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:49,150
doing a lot of points of...

3916
02:12:49,150 --> 02:12:49,890
Trust the process!

3917
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:54,700
Give me your fucking meat.

3918
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:55,960
My pal team's hungry.

3919
02:12:57,620 --> 02:12:58,140
Alright.

3920
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:04,260
Uh... Now that they bred...

3921
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:05,820
We don't actually need this one out anymore.

3922
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:10,360
I can't believe Surefour and I have not found a single lucky pal.

3923
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:12,000
I'm not lucky.

3924
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:13,480
I've established this state.

3925
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:15,720
Yeah but I haven't either!

3926
02:13:17,020 --> 02:13:18,720
I've not heard a single Shiny!

3927
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:26,760
This is actually crazy.

3928
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:27,860
We haven't heard anything.

3929
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:30,880
Alright.

3930
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:32,400
I'm gonna take one of the Anubises.

3931
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:33,960
We've got two Anubis right?

3932
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:34,840
Yeah.

3933
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:35,680
Wait.

3934
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:38,640
Lily do you think I should bring one of the Anubises out there or no?

3935
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,300
Honestly just let them do the stone.

3936
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:43,100
Cause we are also low on stone.

3937
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:44,700
Like chronically always.

3938
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:47,280
And I'll be getting this cool...

3939
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:48,740
done before respawns.

3940
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:49,340
Alright.

3941
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,640
Yeah if we had time it'd be great if we could make...

3942
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:53,580
a second... like another Anubis.

3943
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:54,680
But we just... there's no way.

3944
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:57,120
It takes like 40 minutes minimum.

3945
02:13:57,440 --> 02:13:58,280
Oh shit that's crazy.

3946
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:01,060
Cause you can make Anubis like...

3947
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:02,060
breed with Anubis.

3948
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:04,320
And we have a female and male Anubis.

3949
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:06,100
But it's not gonna happen today.

3950
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:07,460
I don't think you guys have time for breeding...

3951
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:08,360
an Anubis.

3952
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:08,900
No way.

3953
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:10,220
Absolutely not.

3954
02:14:10,380 --> 02:14:11,040
Oh my god.

3955
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:12,160
It's fine.

3956
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:14,160
I am basically an Anubis.

3957
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:14,940
True.

3958
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:16,000
True.

3959
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:18,020
We're Anubis.

3960
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:19,340
You're basically the pal.

3961
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,480
Anubis at home.

3962
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:23,340
Wait.

3963
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:23,780
Uh...

3964
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:24,480
Sure.

3965
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:27,340
Can you make the large pal beds?

3966
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:29,180
We don't have the nails yet.

3967
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:30,700
Oh we don't have nails?

3968
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:32,400
Are we low on nails?

3969
02:14:32,860 --> 02:14:33,300
Yeah.

3970
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:34,680
Okay I'll do that.

3971
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:38,700
We should have lots of ore that we can make into ingots.

3972
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:40,740
I didn't touch the ingots yet.

3973
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:43,000
Cause I'm pretty sure we need higher quality stuff.

3974
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:45,700
So I can queue up stuff.

3975
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:45,940
Yeah we need to make...

3976
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:47,040
That's what we're getting the coal for.

3977
02:14:47,620 --> 02:14:48,540
That's what the coal's for.

3978
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:49,860
Alright.

3979
02:14:55,810 --> 02:14:57,190
Come on fan worm.

3980
02:15:00,010 --> 02:15:00,610
Come on!

3981
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:01,710
I need to repair some of my stuff.

3982
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:02,630
Okay nice.

3983
02:15:03,370 --> 02:15:04,070
Should be it.

3984
02:15:05,690 --> 02:15:07,690
Oh shit I'm so fucked up right now.

3985
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:10,730
Bro I'm so fucked up.

3986
02:15:10,730 --> 02:15:12,230
I'm so fucked up at the moment.

3987
02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:14,090
I am so fucked up right now.

3988
02:15:14,230 --> 02:15:14,910
Oh my god.

3989
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:17,630
I have the board hit.

3990
02:15:17,690 --> 02:15:18,130
That's my most crazy.

3991
02:15:18,550 --> 02:15:21,270
My pal world is so intense.

3992
02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:23,270
Shut up.

3993
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:26,030
I'm so fucking liiiiive.

3994
02:15:26,030 --> 02:15:27,950
No I'm actually almost dead guys.

3995
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:28,810
Oh no.

3996
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:32,010
I just touched it even though it was lagging.

3997
02:15:32,590 --> 02:15:33,570
Oh please.

3998
02:15:33,590 --> 02:15:34,170
Bro gamer.

3999
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:35,050
Bro gamer.

4000
02:15:35,690 --> 02:15:36,270
It lagging so hard.

4001
02:15:38,030 --> 02:15:38,870
Okay I'm good.

4002
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:40,990
Okay clip clip clip.

4003
02:15:41,170 --> 02:15:42,350
PP bots clip clip clip.

4004
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:44,410
I don't know what to say again.

4005
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:45,030
Clip clip clip.

4006
02:15:45,910 --> 02:15:47,370
Thank god Lunaris.

4007
02:15:50,590 --> 02:15:51,590
Holy shit.

4008
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:53,850
That was like one HP.

4009
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:56,190
Not even close baby.

4010
02:15:59,390 --> 02:15:59,890
Wait.

4011
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:01,070
Why am I doing this?

4012
02:16:01,130 --> 02:16:01,710
You should be.

4013
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:01,810
I'm waiting.

4014
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:06,170
Come here you big guy.

4015
02:16:06,850 --> 02:16:07,890
What are you even doing?

4016
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:09,770
What are you doing?

4017
02:16:09,950 --> 02:16:10,470
Come here.

4018
02:16:11,570 --> 02:16:12,610
Okay he's stuck.

4019
02:16:13,730 --> 02:16:15,510
Oh no I'm too far.

4020
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:16,450
Nice refined ingot.

4021
02:16:16,530 --> 02:16:16,850
Let's go.

4022
02:16:17,650 --> 02:16:18,170
Yeah.

4023
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:22,850
Am I close now?

4024
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:23,550
Ah.

4025
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:26,050
Dammit please I'm busy.

4026
02:16:27,290 --> 02:16:28,210
Dammit please.

4027
02:16:29,030 --> 02:16:30,730
Dammit please fuck off I'm busy.

4028
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:31,650
Oh my goodness.

4029
02:16:34,310 --> 02:16:35,970
There's an Anubis walking around.

4030
02:16:36,190 --> 02:16:36,650
Oh wait.

4031
02:16:36,810 --> 02:16:37,550
That's a boss.

4032
02:16:38,270 --> 02:16:39,450
Yeah yeah yeah.

4033
02:16:39,450 --> 02:16:40,730
Get away from that Anubis.

4034
02:16:40,830 --> 02:16:41,670
He's fucking 47 now mate.

4035
02:16:42,270 --> 02:16:43,810
Don't get close to that one.

4036
02:16:43,830 --> 02:16:45,450
Oh my god another Anubis.

4037
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:46,830
Another Anubis.

4038
02:16:46,830 --> 02:16:47,490
What the heck.

4039
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:48,470
You guys.

4040
02:16:48,970 --> 02:16:50,010
You guys.

4041
02:16:50,310 --> 02:16:52,490
You guys catch this for us?

4042
02:16:56,050 --> 02:16:57,410
Oh my god.

4043
02:16:57,410 --> 02:16:59,870
Like I'm not even lying right now.

4044
02:16:59,950 --> 02:17:02,750
But I just saw an Anubis.

4045
02:17:02,910 --> 02:17:03,310
Oops.

4046
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:04,850
I pressed the wrong button.

4047
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:06,530
We're going to the skate park.

4048
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:07,590
I didn't want to go to the skate park.

4049
02:17:07,790 --> 02:17:07,990
Okay.

4050
02:17:08,210 --> 02:17:10,230
Oh my god where the fuck is...

4051
02:17:10,230 --> 02:17:13,170
I'm trying to find like a...

4052
02:17:13,970 --> 02:17:15,510
waypoint so I can come home.

4053
02:17:15,890 --> 02:17:15,930
Okay.

4054
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:19,210
Let me bring some stuff to you.

4055
02:17:20,510 --> 02:17:21,290
How we doing?

4056
02:17:21,390 --> 02:17:22,690
How many coal have you already gotten?

4057
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:24,910
I have mined all the coal.

4058
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:27,030
I'm picking it up and I'll let you know how much it is.

4059
02:17:27,130 --> 02:17:29,430
I'm going to start looking for the dungeons now.

4060
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:31,070
So we can get the dungeons done.

4061
02:17:31,970 --> 02:17:32,370
Okay.

4062
02:17:33,610 --> 02:17:34,690
We have the brown cherry.

4063
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:42,790
There's actually a couple areas with the coal ore in that area.

4064
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:45,810
If you actually just want to like go and mine the rest of them.

4065
02:17:45,850 --> 02:17:47,670
That would actually be super duper freaking helpful.

4066
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:48,630
Let me send you...

4067
02:17:48,630 --> 02:17:51,070
The map is already in the discord but I'll grab it again.

4068
02:17:51,230 --> 02:17:52,810
Okay I have 800 coal.

4069
02:17:52,990 --> 02:17:53,130
Okay.

4070
02:17:53,490 --> 02:17:54,890
Oh 800 coal.

4071
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:55,910
That's a lot of coal.

4072
02:17:56,090 --> 02:17:58,610
I told you I'm a pile of...

4073
02:17:58,610 --> 02:18:01,150
We need more coal for...

4074
02:18:01,150 --> 02:18:02,870
For sure for like...

4075
02:18:02,870 --> 02:18:04,390
Gun stuff don't we?

4076
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:05,450
Okay yeah yeah.

4077
02:18:05,710 --> 02:18:06,890
I don't need too much coal for that.

4078
02:18:07,350 --> 02:18:08,390
Holy shit.

4079
02:18:10,070 --> 02:18:11,750
That was what I was most worried about.

4080
02:18:12,550 --> 02:18:14,230
That's why Lily's our best pal.

4081
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:16,210
Don't worry I'm best pal.

4082
02:18:16,350 --> 02:18:17,610
Best pal Lily!

4083
02:18:19,410 --> 02:18:21,570
She's our level 50 pal right there.

4084
02:18:22,170 --> 02:18:23,070
Right there.

4085
02:18:23,070 --> 02:18:23,890
Do I count?

4086
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:24,730
Can we like...

4087
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:25,730
Sign me up for achievement?

4088
02:18:27,210 --> 02:18:28,310
Level 50 pal?

4089
02:18:28,350 --> 02:18:31,190
Level 500 points right there?

4090
02:18:32,210 --> 02:18:32,610
Right?

4091
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:34,850
There's not actually a good part but like...

4092
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:35,410
You know.

4093
02:18:36,650 --> 02:18:37,810
Alright we need quartz.

4094
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:38,990
Alright then what should I do right now?

4095
02:18:40,410 --> 02:18:41,790
This egg is gonna hatch.

4096
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:43,850
And next I need to make the orcerc.

4097
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:46,390
So once we have Grizzbolt hatched.

4098
02:18:46,390 --> 02:18:47,710
How long till Grizz hatches?

4099
02:18:49,850 --> 02:18:50,850
Grizz is in five.

4100
02:18:52,470 --> 02:18:52,870
Yeah.

4101
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:55,130
But we will clip in 20 seconds.

4102
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:55,990
Clip clip clip!

4103
02:18:56,210 --> 02:18:57,310
I got Bronsherry!

4104
02:18:57,530 --> 02:18:58,270
Clip clip clip!

4105
02:19:00,530 --> 02:19:01,170
Bronsherry's done.

4106
02:19:01,810 --> 02:19:05,030
Okay we need to start making a bunch of refined ingot.

4107
02:19:05,130 --> 02:19:08,390
Like basically we just have to make like a fuck ton of refined ingots.

4108
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:09,670
How do we make refined ingots?

4109
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:11,610
I'll take care of that.

4110
02:19:11,790 --> 02:19:14,050
Yeah that's like the number one thing that we need.

4111
02:19:14,130 --> 02:19:15,890
We need... how many refined ingots do we need?

4112
02:19:15,950 --> 02:19:17,330
We need like hundreds.

4113
02:19:18,270 --> 02:19:21,290
Okay I can start with 87 for now.

4114
02:19:21,430 --> 02:19:21,570
Alright.

4115
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:23,510
Lylene was born!

4116
02:19:23,630 --> 02:19:23,970
Clip clip clip!

4117
02:19:24,870 --> 02:19:26,170
Oh Lily's... yay!

4118
02:19:27,450 --> 02:19:28,290
Successful breeding!

4119
02:19:28,350 --> 02:19:30,250
We got another Lily!

4120
02:19:30,410 --> 02:19:30,770
Let's go!

4121
02:19:31,230 --> 02:19:32,010
We can replace her!

4122
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:39,570
Alright we're gonna swap out this inferior Leah with this superior Lily.

4123
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:42,150
Oh my god we can finally replace her!

4124
02:19:45,090 --> 02:19:45,690
Yippee!

4125
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:47,070
Your position has become redundant.

4126
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:50,970
Now it doesn't matter he gets sick.

4127
02:19:51,990 --> 02:19:52,630
You have become...

4128
02:19:52,870 --> 02:19:52,930
useless.

4129
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:54,070
No worth.

4130
02:19:54,270 --> 02:19:55,190
No worth.

4131
02:19:55,830 --> 02:19:56,370
Thank you.

4132
02:19:56,650 --> 02:19:57,010
Goodbye.

4133
02:19:58,570 --> 02:20:00,350
You don't get a pension after.

4134
02:20:01,150 --> 02:20:02,630
Rest in peace you won't be missed.

4135
02:20:02,670 --> 02:20:05,070
We need milk and egg but it doesn't really fucking matter so it's all good.

4136
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:07,270
Alright next thing we need to breed!

4137
02:20:08,890 --> 02:20:11,210
First off why have you just been in here doing nothing?

4138
02:20:13,090 --> 02:20:13,590
Fuck off.

4139
02:20:13,590 --> 02:20:15,150
Do we have enough time to breed the rest or?

4140
02:20:15,930 --> 02:20:16,290
Yeah!

4141
02:20:16,390 --> 02:20:17,050
Yeah we're good.

4142
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:17,610
We're gonna be good.

4143
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:20,490
Cause we still have to do the other stuff so...

4144
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:21,930
I'm just a little worried cause...

4145
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:27,410
The last thing we need to breed is pretty much once this grisbolt is done in four minutes.

4146
02:20:28,110 --> 02:20:31,430
If we have the correct sex then I can immediately breed the last one.

4147
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:35,190
If we don't then I'm gonna need somebody to get another relaxosaurus.

4148
02:20:35,950 --> 02:20:38,850
I'll show you... I'll see what relaxosaurus I have.

4149
02:20:39,610 --> 02:20:42,510
But I'm gonna maybe go try to get pure crystals maybe?

4150
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:46,730
I have a male relaxosaurus right now on me.

4151
02:20:46,970 --> 02:20:47,690
Maybe you guys need a male.

4152
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:49,550
So hopefully this is a female otherwise...

4153
02:20:50,490 --> 02:20:51,490
Let's see...

4154
02:20:51,490 --> 02:20:53,770
I need to fucking replace some of my pals in here.

4155
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:56,030
Univolt...

4156
02:20:56,750 --> 02:20:59,310
Lunaris... I do not need...

4157
02:20:59,310 --> 02:21:00,830
I need 40 nails.

4158
02:21:02,010 --> 02:21:02,750
Don't do it.

4159
02:21:03,070 --> 02:21:04,910
Let me see where they're at.

4160
02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:06,150
We're at 26 nails.

4161
02:21:07,170 --> 02:21:07,690
Uhhhh...

4162
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:09,990
I think I can do another...

4163
02:21:10,590 --> 02:21:12,070
I can do a...

4164
02:21:12,070 --> 02:21:13,750
I can kill the mammorast right?

4165
02:21:14,050 --> 02:21:15,070
Yeah I can.

4166
02:21:15,450 --> 02:21:16,250
Let's see...

4167
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:19,470
Where is the mamm... Is the mammorast the one in the beginning?

4168
02:21:20,490 --> 02:21:20,650
Yeah.

4169
02:21:20,770 --> 02:21:21,210
Okay.

4170
02:21:21,370 --> 02:21:22,870
Well let's see if I can kill it.

4171
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:24,650
Let's see if I can kill this.

4172
02:21:25,190 --> 02:21:26,730
If you need help...

4173
02:21:26,730 --> 02:21:27,970
Um... Good luck.

4174
02:21:28,890 --> 02:21:29,590
Thank you.

4175
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:31,530
I really appreciate that.

4176
02:21:31,530 --> 02:21:32,290
If you need help...

4177
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:32,730
No one can.

4178
02:21:32,830 --> 02:21:33,150
Good luck.

4179
02:21:33,610 --> 02:21:36,010
No one can help you but if you need it...

4180
02:21:36,010 --> 02:21:36,550
Goodbye.

4181
02:21:37,710 --> 02:21:40,030
Let's see... Go VanWorm!

4182
02:21:40,150 --> 02:21:40,410
Go!

4183
02:21:41,310 --> 02:21:41,950
It's alright.

4184
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:43,250
Alright nails are done.

4185
02:21:45,010 --> 02:21:46,130
Put him in the box.

4186
02:21:47,310 --> 02:21:47,950
It's fine.

4187
02:21:47,950 --> 02:21:50,010
Uh... Apparently...

4188
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:52,270
It's not... Are they in a box?

4189
02:21:52,630 --> 02:21:53,830
I'm about to put him in a box.

4190
02:21:53,950 --> 02:21:54,170
Yeah.

4191
02:21:54,330 --> 02:21:54,790
Oh okay.

4192
02:21:55,610 --> 02:21:56,970
I... The box was full.

4193
02:21:57,930 --> 02:21:59,010
Okay they're in the box now.

4194
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:02,430
Alright I'm just gonna put this somewhere.

4195
02:22:04,150 --> 02:22:04,590
Oop.

4196
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:08,390
Oh this boss is easy!

4197
02:22:08,930 --> 02:22:10,610
I'm so fucking tanky now!

4198
02:22:10,990 --> 02:22:12,490
Or my pals are tanky.

4199
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:15,130
Go pal go!

4200
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:15,230
Go!

4201
02:22:15,250 --> 02:22:15,610
Whoa!

4202
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:18,490
I'm so good at Dark Soulings now.

4203
02:22:19,450 --> 02:22:20,590
I'm so good at Dark Souls.

4204
02:22:21,090 --> 02:22:22,330
Two minutes on that one.

4205
02:22:22,890 --> 02:22:27,330
Alright we need to make circuit boards so I'm just gonna go get some Pure Quartz.

4206
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:27,830
Yeah.

4207
02:22:28,010 --> 02:22:32,350
Chat do you know if there's like any particularly really good spot for Pure Quartz?

4208
02:22:32,490 --> 02:22:35,390
Or is it literally just wander around the mountain?

4209
02:22:37,150 --> 02:22:37,630
Oop.

4210
02:22:37,650 --> 02:22:38,850
I know there's that lake.

4211
02:22:39,050 --> 02:22:41,050
The unthawable lake has a lot of them.

4212
02:22:42,650 --> 02:22:43,910
Alright I'll head to the lake.

4213
02:22:45,130 --> 02:22:45,570
We'll see.

4214
02:22:45,950 --> 02:22:46,490
Please.

4215
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:48,150
Please Unifold.

4216
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:50,270
Why are you so weak?

4217
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:52,570
Okay and then we...

4218
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:56,030
Okay two pal beds I'll help build.

4219
02:22:57,430 --> 02:22:58,330
Leave me alone.

4220
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:01,250
Leave me alone.

4221
02:23:03,590 --> 02:23:04,670
Oh my god please!

4222
02:23:05,050 --> 02:23:06,210
You built two of them right?

4223
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:10,920
Yeah.

4224
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,160
Did you build two of these pal beds?

4225
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:13,860
Yeah.

4226
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:14,960
Okay cool.

4227
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:16,180
Getting upgraded now.

4228
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:23,760
We should be able to level up the base now, right?

4229
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:28,340
What level is our base now?

4230
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:32,020
Alright, we're like...

4231
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:48,460
The build for 19 will speed up how long it'll take for us to do 17 and 18.

4232
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:49,780
I did the math last night.

4233
02:23:49,900 --> 02:23:54,380
And it's just better to just do the 19 base objective first.

4234
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:55,180
Alright.

4235
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:57,620
Come on.

4236
02:23:58,580 --> 02:24:00,320
Alright, base upgrade done!

4237
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:02,400
Alright, refined metal chest.

4238
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:03,280
Nice.

4239
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:05,560
Come on, Memorous!

4240
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:06,980
Let me check refined metal chest.

4241
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:09,880
Refined metal chest.

4242
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:13,820
Okay, we need a refined ingot.

4243
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:14,940
Nail it.

4244
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:15,080
Nail wood.

4245
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:17,480
Okay, can you build us the refined metal chest?

4246
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:20,500
What level is it?

4247
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:24,260
It is level 39.

4248
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:25,900
Okay.

4249
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:27,860
That should be fine.

4250
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:33,800
The next thing we're gonna need, we're going to need a bunch of circuit boards and refined ingots.

4251
02:24:33,900 --> 02:24:35,400
So I'm gonna go...

4252
02:24:36,220 --> 02:24:41,660
I'm gonna get the grisbolt situation figured out first, but then I'm gonna go try to farm the quartz.

4253
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:46,140
I'm just trying to catch my Memorous.

4254
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:47,420
Why is it 5%?

4255
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:54,920
Holy shit.

4256
02:24:54,980 --> 02:24:57,420
This Memorous is taking fucking forever.

4257
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:01,900
Well, it's not a Memorous active.

4258
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:02,600
It's a Memorous.

4259
02:25:02,740 --> 02:25:03,960
That's why it takes so long.

4260
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:05,140
Jesus Christ.

4261
02:25:06,400 --> 02:25:07,520
I'm still at...

4262
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:08,660
Oh my god.

4263
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:10,980
I think I definitely need a hyperspear or some shit.

4264
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:13,660
What are the mats for hyperspear?

4265
02:25:14,480 --> 02:25:15,120
I have a lot of them.

4266
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:16,260
We have all the mats.

4267
02:25:16,260 --> 02:25:17,320
I just can't queue them.

4268
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:17,920
We need circuit boards.

4269
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:21,260
We need circuit boards to build the sphere assembly line too.

4270
02:25:21,780 --> 02:25:21,900
Okay.

4271
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:23,540
So Memorous is caught.

4272
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:24,820
Clip, clip, clip.

4273
02:25:25,220 --> 02:25:25,920
I got it.

4274
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:26,600
Clip, clip, clip.

4275
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:27,380
Clip, clip, clip.

4276
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:29,320
Feed your pal.

4277
02:25:29,460 --> 02:25:30,140
Oh my god.

4278
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:30,560
I did it.

4279
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:31,100
Never mind.

4280
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:32,900
Clip, clip, clip.

4281
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:33,820
Clip, clip, clip.

4282
02:25:33,980 --> 02:25:34,700
Alright, cool.

4283
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:36,020
Now...

4284
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:40,060
I'm gonna try to find dungeons for us now because we...

4285
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:41,220
Next is production assembly line.

4286
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:44,700
We need to do dungeons at the two hour mark and we're at the two hour mark.

4287
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:45,100
So I'm gonna try to find dungeons.

4288
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:46,600
I'm gonna try to find the dungeons and you guys do your thing.

4289
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:47,820
Check your...

4290
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:48,480
Um...

4291
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:50,540
All our eggs are incubated.

4292
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:51,200
I'm gonna hatch them.

4293
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:55,560
We can make a third base by the way so we can teleport everybody to the dungeons.

4294
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:56,620
We got Grisbolt.

4295
02:25:57,480 --> 02:25:58,460
Do we need a Grisbolt?

4296
02:25:58,700 --> 02:25:58,800
Let's go!

4297
02:25:58,980 --> 02:26:00,640
The Grisbolt and we got...

4298
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:01,820
I'm hatching the Scorching One.

4299
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:02,900
Alright, what is the gender of the Grisbolt?

4300
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:04,100
The Scorching One was a...

4301
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:04,800
I'm gonna check now.

4302
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:06,180
Uh...

4303
02:26:06,740 --> 02:26:08,880
Grisbolt is a female.

4304
02:26:09,140 --> 02:26:10,860
And we have a male Relaxosaurus.

4305
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:12,080
Let's go!

4306
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:12,420
Alright.

4307
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:12,900
Let's put them out.

4308
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:13,000
Who do we get?

4309
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:14,420
Who are we replacing?

4310
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:15,100
Can you take them out?

4311
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,100
Can you take out the ones we're replacing?

4312
02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:17,560
They're all sleeping so it doesn't matter.

4313
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:18,420
Um...

4314
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:19,340
Yeah, but I don't...

4315
02:26:19,340 --> 02:26:19,840
I'll just take out...

4316
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:20,600
I'll take this guy out.

4317
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:21,920
Okay, Relaxosaurus is here.

4318
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:24,200
Alright, here we go.

4319
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:24,660
Alright, cool.

4320
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:26,760
No, no, don't sleep.

4321
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:27,400
No...

4322
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:28,280
No...

4323
02:26:28,980 --> 02:26:29,340
No...

4324
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:31,480
I'm gonna get HP for once.

4325
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:31,780
Get up!

4326
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:34,140
Okay, I just have to wait till it lands.

4327
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,000
I can't put them in there.

4328
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:37,040
I'm trying to look at what the dungeons are.

4329
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:38,840
Caverns of Dune dungeon.

4330
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:42,680
Okay, I know you put that with dungeons.

4331
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:44,400
Caverns of Dune.

4332
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:45,080
Okay, that's...

4333
02:26:45,100 --> 02:26:45,720
It's in the desert.

4334
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:49,940
Okay, it's level 38 dungeon, which is fine.

4335
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:51,720
I'm sure if we're in higher enough level.

4336
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:55,080
Alright, breeding is gonna be fine.

4337
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:55,700
We're good.

4338
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:57,120
Nice.

4339
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:57,340
Nice.

4340
02:26:57,340 --> 02:27:02,180
Yeah, I just need to get the circle boards so I can make the spheres so I can get the hyperspheres so then I can...

4341
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:03,800
Oh yeah.

4342
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:04,780
Start catching the bosses.

4343
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:08,600
I'm gonna get the materials for bases so you guys can teleport to me to do the dungeon.

4344
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:09,520
Okay.

4345
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:10,440
Sounds good.

4346
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:11,540
Okay, we have...

4347
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:12,140
I can like...

4348
02:27:12,140 --> 02:27:14,780
Then you can also start teleporting us to those islands.

4349
02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:15,780
Yeah, yeah.

4350
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,760
So how much refined ingot do we need?

4351
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:23,860
I have 87 and I can make 330 more.

4352
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:34,940
It'll be a hundred refined ingots to make the sphere assembly line and then for the balls, it's...

4353
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:38,220
So I'll just max it out so you can queue all the balls later.

4354
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:39,200
Five per ball.

4355
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:40,280
Okay.

4356
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:42,460
We just queue up all the ingots.

4357
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:44,760
The major problem with the balls is that they're not as good as the spheres.

4358
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:45,540
Actually, it's probably...

4359
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:46,380
It's just circle boards.

4360
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:50,180
It's probably better if...

4361
02:27:50,180 --> 02:27:51,520
Can I make polymer yet?

4362
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:54,820
I make pal metal ingots and then I make legendary spheres.

4363
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:57,040
I just need cement and carbon fiber.

4364
02:27:57,720 --> 02:27:58,420
All right.

4365
02:27:59,020 --> 02:28:01,100
We also need to make polymers.

4366
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:05,800
I'm not level 33 so I need to get up a couple levels before I can do that.

4367
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:09,400
So if we can make a bunch of cement, that would be gook.

4368
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:10,140
I can...

4369
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:11,000
We have 80.

4370
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,300
I can make like a lot more.

4371
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:14,220
Okay.

4372
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:16,040
I'm in the right area.

4373
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:22,880
If I can just make legendary spheres, then it'll be way easier to catch the motherfuckers.

4374
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:24,240
Where are the Anubis?

4375
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:24,320
All right.

4376
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:25,180
I'm gonna start reading.

4377
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:26,040
I want to slave them to make a rock.

4378
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:27,460
You guys do that.

4379
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:29,600
I'm just gonna find us that fucking dungeon.

4380
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,520
Where the heck?

4381
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:34,060
Let's take him down.

4382
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:35,520
Wait.

4383
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:36,320
No.

4384
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:36,920
Not you.

4385
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:37,780
I don't need you.

4386
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:37,800
Wait.

4387
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:39,420
We have no more Anubis in the base?

4388
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:39,880
Wait.

4389
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:40,800
We have one Anubis.

4390
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:41,160
We should have one.

4391
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:41,560
Where's the other one?

4392
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:45,800
I'm gonna start making some.

4393
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:46,580
I'm gonna put him back.

4394
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:47,440
Okay.

4395
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:47,920
Yeah.

4396
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:48,100
No.

4397
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:48,660
It is this guy.

4398
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:49,140
And Griswold.

4399
02:28:49,300 --> 02:28:49,620
Okay.

4400
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:52,020
Last breed.

4401
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:53,980
Ooh.

4402
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:56,060
Where the fuck is the dungeon?

4403
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:00,320
Okay.

4404
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:01,660
I am looking at the...

4405
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:02,360
I am looking at the...

4406
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:03,980
And then grab Griswold.

4407
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:04,500
...back to rock.

4408
02:29:05,580 --> 02:29:10,460
Trying to find the dungeon spawns on the little guide you made.

4409
02:29:13,060 --> 02:29:13,580
See.

4410
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:14,720
I hope it was helpful.

4411
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:14,740
I mean, I'm so happy.

4412
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:24,100
I like, got really, uh, like, I started looking into all the stuff I needed for breeding and then it just led me down a rabbit hole of all the other things I needed.

4413
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:25,760
No, that's not it.

4414
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:26,980
Oh.

4415
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:29,800
The dungeons.

4416
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:30,560
Right.

4417
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:31,740
Breeding time.

4418
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:33,600
Breed, breed, breed.

4419
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:35,920
Wrong mouth.

4420
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:40,460
It's so hard to find the dungeon.

4421
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:40,480
Alright.

4422
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:40,800
There they go.

4423
02:29:40,860 --> 02:29:41,260
There they go.

4424
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:41,840
Fall in love.

4425
02:29:43,060 --> 02:29:43,980
I'll leave you to it.

4426
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:44,720
I'm gonna go find the dungeon.

4427
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:46,100
Good luck with the breeding.

4428
02:29:46,340 --> 02:29:47,120
It's that easy.

4429
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:47,840
Just do it.

4430
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:48,640
It's easy.

4431
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:50,040
Good luck with the fertilization.

4432
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:51,900
Why are you trying to make it complicated?

4433
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:53,100
Why are you trying to make it complicated?

4434
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:55,800
You're like, all you need is a cake and then they'll fall in love.

4435
02:29:58,180 --> 02:29:58,660
That's all.

4436
02:29:59,120 --> 02:29:59,300
No!

4437
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:00,480
No!

4438
02:30:00,620 --> 02:30:01,860
Stop falling down!

4439
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:07,620
Well, I hope it's not exhibitionism because I don't want to stand over there and watch Okay, at the one hour mark, we start petting.

4440
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:09,100
Yes.

4441
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:10,080
Yeah, we start.

4442
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:10,520
Okay.

4443
02:30:10,580 --> 02:30:11,840
We start petting together.

4444
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:14,620
I don't know why that makes me laugh every time you say it.

4445
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:14,700
I don't know why that makes me laugh every time you say it.

4446
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:15,280
I'm just like, okay.

4447
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:17,320
Wait, we just do group petting?

4448
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:18,640
What's so funny about that?

4449
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:19,880
Yeah, what's so funny?

4450
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:21,000
This is a serious thing.

4451
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:22,520
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

4452
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:22,820
You're right.

4453
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:23,480
Sorry.

4454
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:24,880
I had the giggles.

4455
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:25,360
My bad.

4456
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:26,540
Oh my god.

4457
02:30:26,620 --> 02:30:28,780
How dare you laugh about petting?

4458
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:29,720
Right?

4459
02:30:30,020 --> 02:30:31,320
They're like, group petals.

4460
02:30:35,480 --> 02:30:36,880
Ah, yes.

4461
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:38,140
My favorite Pal World hobby.

4462
02:30:38,340 --> 02:30:39,380
Group petting.

4463
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:40,800
Of course.

4464
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:43,400
It's perfectly weird.

4465
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:44,680
People need a pet.

4466
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:45,260
I want a pet too.

4467
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:46,520
Yeah.

4468
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:48,860
Yeah, you're so right.

4469
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:49,460
You're so right.

4470
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:50,940
What the hell are you guys talking about?

4471
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:57,440
Can I be patted since I've been doing Pal work?

4472
02:30:58,580 --> 02:30:59,880
I feel like I deserve...

4473
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:01,100
It's called Pal World, not Pat World.

4474
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:01,900
Okay, you're...

4475
02:31:01,900 --> 02:31:02,860
I'm not responding to this statement.

4476
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:03,640
You calm down.

4477
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:04,600
You calm down.

4478
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:06,180
You're just like, please.

4479
02:31:07,860 --> 02:31:08,300
Please.

4480
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:09,500
Shut the fuck up.

4481
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:09,800
Please.

4482
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:13,520
You're just sitting there like, oh my god, please stop talking.

4483
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,180
I'm the only male here.

4484
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:16,000
I don't want...

4485
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:16,560
I'm on...

4486
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:18,240
I'm running water here.

4487
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:20,160
I got big dick energy if that makes you feel better.

4488
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:21,280
You have big dick energy?

4489
02:31:21,460 --> 02:31:22,340
Hell fucking no.

4490
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:23,140
Whoa.

4491
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:28,800
You were like, I'm gonna try and make you uncomfortable.

4492
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:32,760
And then you just made yourself uncomfortable talking about like, what was it?

4493
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:34,540
Like the anal fissures or something?

4494
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:35,900
Anal fissures.

4495
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4496
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:45,140
I'm just being the straight man of the group because I'm an RP God.

4497
02:31:45,140 --> 02:31:45,220
Oh my god.

4498
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:49,460
Is it RP or is it real?

4499
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:50,340
We'll never know.

4500
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:52,020
It's roleplay.

4501
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:55,860
Is it though?

4502
02:31:56,060 --> 02:31:57,180
Is it really RP?

4503
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:58,220
I'm flying.

4504
02:31:58,660 --> 02:32:00,080
I'm out when I have a little punny.

4505
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:01,000
Do I need to wait for anything?

4506
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:02,060
Yeah, I'm gonna wait for the egg.

4507
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:03,860
I'll wait for the egg and then I'll go.

4508
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:05,600
What can I do to be useful right now though?

4509
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:11,780
I'm still trying to find the fucking dungeon.

4510
02:32:11,940 --> 02:32:13,020
This dungeon is so hard to find.

4511
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:13,740
Holy shit.

4512
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:19,060
When we need to butcher pals, by the way, we should butcher the cow.

4513
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:20,600
No, we need to butcher chicken.

4514
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:21,640
It's only chicken.

4515
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:23,260
Oh, it's only chicken?

4516
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:24,600
Yeah, but we have a lot of them.

4517
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:25,640
Oh.

4518
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:30,620
Because I need the meat from the cow and I need the meat from the boar.

4519
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:33,100
Not right now though.

4520
02:32:33,260 --> 02:32:34,640
I mean, we don't have the kitchen yet.

4521
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:38,960
Wait, you're a high enough level to do it now.

4522
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:39,960
We just don't have the materials.

4523
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:41,280
We just don't have the circuit boards.

4524
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:42,240
Nah.

4525
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:42,840
Alright.

4526
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:44,440
Yeah, I gotta fly out of here then.

4527
02:32:45,140 --> 02:32:47,300
I'm just trying to find the dungeon.

4528
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:49,340
Guys, am I going the right way?

4529
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:58,000
Guys, we're trying to find the cavern of the Dune dungeon.

4530
02:32:58,200 --> 02:32:59,160
I don't know.

4531
02:33:03,640 --> 02:33:05,180
Excuse me, sir?

4532
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:07,820
Do you know where the cavern of the Dune dungeon is?

4533
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:09,560
There's no holes anywhere!

4534
02:33:15,140 --> 02:33:16,840
Where the fuck are the holes?

4535
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:23,520
I'm over encumbered.

4536
02:33:23,540 --> 02:33:23,660
I'm over encumbered.

4537
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:24,060
I'm over encumbered.

4538
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:27,480
Oh, also, uh...

4539
02:33:28,060 --> 02:33:29,720
Lily, this applies to you and me.

4540
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:36,040
Make sure that you have at least 40 pals registered in your decks today because there's a big difference between 30 and 40.

4541
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:38,140
You get like 20 points versus 50 points.

4542
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:39,760
I have 22.

4543
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:41,840
We can probably just drop them to each other.

4544
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:42,600
No, no, you have to catch them.

4545
02:33:43,300 --> 02:33:46,180
Wait, open up this egg then.

4546
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:47,620
Uh, hatch this egg.

4547
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:49,580
Whatever this common egg is.

4548
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:52,280
Wait, I think I found a dungeon!

4549
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:53,820
I think I did it!

4550
02:33:54,080 --> 02:33:54,920
Alright, let's go!

4551
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,480
Okay, I don't know if this is the right one.

4552
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:59,440
Oh my god, please, for the love of god.

4553
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:00,460
Okay.

4554
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:02,360
Please.

4555
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:05,980
I'm gonna make some common...

4556
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:07,600
...pal spheres.

4557
02:34:08,660 --> 02:34:09,060
Okay.

4558
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:09,920
I found it!

4559
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:12,180
Alright, I'm making a base right now.

4560
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:14,180
I still need to get...

4561
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:16,820
...three more pals to get the 50 points.

4562
02:34:16,980 --> 02:34:18,460
I'm putting the base up now.

4563
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:21,120
So I need you guys to get over here.

4564
02:34:21,360 --> 02:34:24,020
Can you give me one second just to get the last agony?

4565
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:24,280
Not yet, because I'm trying to get...

4566
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:25,060
Wait, wait, wait, we have three bases?

4567
02:34:25,880 --> 02:34:26,280
Yeah.

4568
02:34:26,380 --> 02:34:27,960
So you can just put it down.

4569
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:31,940
No, but I can put it because I cannot be able to get any more bases.

4570
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:33,960
Oh wait, do we have a third base built?

4571
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:36,220
Oh yeah, you can just destroy mine.

4572
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:37,120
Fuck it, we'll vault.

4573
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:40,800
Someone destroy it and then we do this dungeon right now.

4574
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:41,740
You can destroy it.

4575
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:42,280
Where is it?

4576
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:43,100
I can't.

4577
02:34:44,180 --> 02:34:44,300
You can destroy it.

4578
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:46,020
Wait, what do you mean you can't?

4579
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:48,480
I'm literally in front of the dungeon, what do you mean?

4580
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:49,080
Oh, this one?

4581
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:50,520
Okay, I'm gonna dismantle it.

4582
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:51,640
You can hold V on it.

4583
02:34:54,060 --> 02:34:54,420
Alright.

4584
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:56,080
Let me know when I can build it.

4585
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:59,320
Is everybody ready to do this dungeon?

4586
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:01,020
No, I'm trying to get quartz.

4587
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:01,780
Let me put the egg in.

4588
02:35:03,100 --> 02:35:04,060
Last egg, last egg.

4589
02:35:04,740 --> 02:35:05,620
You need coal?

4590
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:06,480
Don't we have enough?

4591
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:07,360
No, quartz.

4592
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:08,740
Oh, quartz.

4593
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:09,260
Okay.

4594
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:12,700
When are you done, Sher4?

4595
02:35:14,180 --> 02:35:15,080
There's an egg for you.

4596
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:16,660
If you want to open up that egg.

4597
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:17,720
Yes, let me do that.

4598
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:19,500
Get over here right now.

4599
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:22,060
Right now.

4600
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:25,440
It took me five minutes to find this dungeon.

4601
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:28,080
I'm gonna fast travel around.

4602
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:30,480
Find some shit to catch that I didn't touch yet.

4603
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:34,060
Okay.

4604
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:35,860
I'm good.

4605
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:36,940
Are you guys all ready?

4606
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:40,460
I'm getting quartz, Doki.

4607
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:42,240
How many times do I have to say it, motherfucker?

4608
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:44,080
Finish your quartz!

4609
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:49,260
Oh, wow.

4610
02:35:49,440 --> 02:35:51,020
We have so many refining.

4611
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:51,940
We're doing great.

4612
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:53,520
We're gonna get this.

4613
02:35:53,940 --> 02:35:55,920
Bates is gonna be 20 in no time.

4614
02:35:56,460 --> 02:35:58,040
All we need is the circuit boards.

4615
02:35:59,020 --> 02:35:59,560
Faster!

4616
02:36:01,820 --> 02:36:05,160
Alright, I'm gonna try and find...

4617
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:05,400
Let's go!

4618
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:08,580
Oh, no.

4619
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:09,540
He's broken again.

4620
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:12,020
I'm gonna fucking catch more stuff then.

4621
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:13,620
While I wait.

4622
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:14,060
I'm gonna try and find...

4623
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:16,780
Oh, no.

4624
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:17,180
I'm stuck.

4625
02:36:18,140 --> 02:36:19,320
Why am I always stuck?

4626
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:23,020
There we go.

4627
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:25,420
Can I catch this?

4628
02:36:26,460 --> 02:36:27,100
Level 35.

4629
02:36:27,320 --> 02:36:28,260
I should be able to.

4630
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:30,680
Okay.

4631
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:32,140
I'm gonna check that off the list.

4632
02:36:32,740 --> 02:36:33,460
Uh... okay.

4633
02:36:34,380 --> 02:36:37,140
So, all of the breeding stuff, I can just hide.

4634
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:38,020
I don't need this anymore.

4635
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:39,920
Hide.

4636
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:41,360
Hide.

4637
02:36:41,420 --> 02:36:44,060
Oh, we can still make a dire howl, but I was kind of like...

4638
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:46,120
Wait, did you clip the...

4639
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:47,480
We're waiting for it to hatch.

4640
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:47,780
Okay.

4641
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:52,000
But the dire howl... Is it worth doing?

4642
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:52,380
No.

4643
02:36:52,400 --> 02:36:55,480
You have to get the three passive moves.

4644
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:56,220
If we have the right things.

4645
02:36:57,400 --> 02:37:00,760
Because it's only a pod and egg, so it's like fucking 10 minutes per egg.

4646
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:02,900
Okay, if it's 10 minutes per egg, then that's fine.

4647
02:37:03,340 --> 02:37:05,560
I guess I can try to...

4648
02:37:05,560 --> 02:37:06,680
Do they need cake though?

4649
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:07,800
Yes.

4650
02:37:08,460 --> 02:37:10,360
Okay, then let's not do it.

4651
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:10,980
Let's not do it.

4652
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:15,040
I don't think it's worth it because I feel like we should put our time in something else at this point.

4653
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:16,060
Yeah, let's do something else.

4654
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:21,560
Yeah, because we really need to catch up on some points since we haven't really uh...

4655
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:23,440
been farming points.

4656
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:27,000
Once I get legendary spheres, I'll be able to catch all the bosses.

4657
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:27,580
Let's go!

4658
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:29,640
Yeah, that's a lot of points.

4659
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:30,520
Alright.

4660
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:33,320
Okay, are we ready to go to the dungeon?

4661
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:35,620
I'm getting quartz.

4662
02:37:37,220 --> 02:37:38,980
He's getting quartz, we had.

4663
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:39,960
Alright.

4664
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:41,660
I'm gonna come get quartz with you then.

4665
02:37:42,480 --> 02:37:43,940
Yeah, help him get quartz.

4666
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:46,840
Can you actually... oh wait, we can't drop a base anymore.

4667
02:37:47,140 --> 02:37:47,420
Alright.

4668
02:37:47,540 --> 02:37:50,620
I mean, I can destroy this base right now.

4669
02:37:50,980 --> 02:37:51,380
Nah.

4670
02:37:51,980 --> 02:37:56,480
I mean, if quartz is just something you mine, you just drop me in and I'll mine it in no time.

4671
02:37:56,820 --> 02:37:57,720
I'm not even kidding.

4672
02:37:58,060 --> 02:37:59,300
I'm gonna destroy the base then.

4673
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:01,080
No, no, no, it's okay.

4674
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:04,180
It's okay, I can just fly over.

4675
02:38:05,580 --> 02:38:06,500
It's... it's fine.

4676
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:07,480
There's a town?

4677
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:08,360
Where's the town?

4678
02:38:09,820 --> 02:38:10,340
Okay, cool.

4679
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:11,340
Give me a compass direction.

4680
02:38:11,980 --> 02:38:14,600
Chat, I need a compass direction I can grab the town.

4681
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,060
Oh, there it is.

4682
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:15,780
Nevermind, I see it.

4683
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:19,720
It's right there.

4684
02:38:21,060 --> 02:38:21,780
Wait, what the fuck?

4685
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:22,280
What the fuck?

4686
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:25,520
No, no, what the fuck?

4687
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:27,480
I fucking died!

4688
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:31,620
I went to the Anubis and I didn't have the tropical armor on.

4689
02:38:31,780 --> 02:38:33,480
And I fucking just died instantly.

4690
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:35,280
Because I took it.

4691
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:37,040
I died for quartz.

4692
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:38,260
That's okay.

4693
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:38,900
It's alright.

4694
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:39,760
It's fine.

4695
02:38:40,360 --> 02:38:41,620
I'll just make myself a new armor.

4696
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:42,240
That's fine.

4697
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:43,900
No.

4698
02:38:46,940 --> 02:38:47,840
Not like this.

4699
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:50,520
I'm ready to go to the boss.

4700
02:38:51,720 --> 02:38:52,020
Are you fucking...

4701
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:52,880
Okay, I'm coming for her.

4702
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:54,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

4703
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:57,580
I'm just saying, I might as well go.

4704
02:38:59,220 --> 02:39:01,160
Alright, head over to the dungeon.

4705
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:03,080
Alright, head over to the dungeon.

4706
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:05,240
When everybody's ready, head over to the dungeon.

4707
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:05,680
When everybody's ready, head over to the dungeon.

4708
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:06,820
It'll take me one minute.

4709
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:07,360
Just one minute.

4710
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:08,260
Okay, it's okay.

4711
02:39:08,340 --> 02:39:10,860
I'm grabbing the fast travel in the town.

4712
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:12,100
For later.

4713
02:39:12,460 --> 02:39:13,600
I'm just gonna go pick up my shit.

4714
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:19,220
Okay.

4715
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:20,160
There we go.

4716
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:21,140
You know what though?

4717
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:22,640
That was actually a speed strat.

4718
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:23,700
Because now I don't need to eat.

4719
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:25,000
Yay!

4720
02:39:27,420 --> 02:39:28,900
That was intentional by design.

4721
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:30,560
Alright, I'm back at the base.

4722
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:31,800
Whenever everyone's ready.

4723
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:33,360
I'm ready to fast travel.

4724
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:36,480
I'll wait here.

4725
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:37,660
Alright.

4726
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:38,080
I'm in.

4727
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:40,260
I'm coming.

4728
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:41,600
Are you close?

4729
02:39:42,220 --> 02:39:42,980
I'm coming.

4730
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:46,580
I'm very close.

4731
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:48,760
Where is she?

4732
02:39:49,160 --> 02:39:50,300
Oh, there she is!

4733
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:52,400
I was like, don't worry about it.

4734
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:53,340
Why are you here?

4735
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:54,240
Did you die?

4736
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:56,420
I died.

4737
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:59,700
I'm catching paths I don't have yet.

4738
02:39:59,740 --> 02:40:00,700
I've skipped so many.

4739
02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:02,800
Oh my god, you're naked!

4740
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:04,600
Don't worry about it.

4741
02:40:05,740 --> 02:40:06,700
Okay, okay.

4742
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:09,760
I'm fine.

4743
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:12,900
Don't worry.

4744
02:40:13,500 --> 02:40:16,180
I'm just going to kill these guys with flamethrowers.

4745
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:17,700
Alright guys, don't die.

4746
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:18,660
Don't die to these guys.

4747
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:19,120
Just run.

4748
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:21,560
Just run.

4749
02:40:21,700 --> 02:40:23,180
These are very high level.

4750
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:24,380
We have to get to these.

4751
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:27,320
We have to get to the dungeon as fast as we can.

4752
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:28,360
Or they'll die.

4753
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:30,880
Just keep running.

4754
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:33,940
As long as everyone has a wolf, it should be fine.

4755
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:34,460
Oh fuck.

4756
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:37,280
I've got a flying thing.

4757
02:40:38,180 --> 02:40:39,120
Just don't die.

4758
02:40:39,220 --> 02:40:41,480
We need you alive so we can get this done.

4759
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:42,320
Fuck.

4760
02:40:44,220 --> 02:40:45,480
I don't know what way it is.

4761
02:40:45,740 --> 02:40:46,600
Oh okay, I don't know.

4762
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:47,420
I was following you.

4763
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:48,680
We're doing it live.

4764
02:40:49,140 --> 02:40:50,620
I love doing this live.

4765
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:52,440
I can't even get up!

4766
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:54,500
Okay, I got it.

4767
02:40:54,620 --> 02:40:58,640
Oh no, I'm alone with the dudes!

4768
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:00,320
Oh yeah, it's over here.

4769
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:00,780
Okay.

4770
02:41:01,460 --> 02:41:02,280
First try, baby.

4771
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:06,440
Wait, I'm about to get fucking flamethrowered to death.

4772
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:07,120
No, you're fine.

4773
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:10,260
Just run past them.

4774
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:11,760
Yeah, just...

4775
02:41:13,100 --> 02:41:14,100
I'm almost there.

4776
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:15,660
Just keep on trucking along.

4777
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:18,120
We're basically at the dungeon.

4778
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:20,400
Sure, we can try and kill it together here.

4779
02:41:20,660 --> 02:41:21,900
Wait, I'm not there yet.

4780
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:22,660
Okay, we'll wait.

4781
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:23,940
It's a pyrene.

4782
02:41:26,780 --> 02:41:28,020
I'm gonna put my...

4783
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:28,960
Univolt...

4784
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:30,480
Alright.

4785
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:32,900
You guys ready?

4786
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:35,720
No, we need small peepee.

4787
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:36,820
Where's small peepee?

4788
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:40,040
I'm sorry, my small peepee is really busting it to get over there.

4789
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:42,360
Where's small peepee?

4790
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:42,380
Where is she?

4791
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:44,440
I don't even see her.

4792
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:45,740
I've got anxiety.

4793
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:47,460
Come on.

4794
02:41:47,720 --> 02:41:49,560
You're almost... Are you stuck?

4795
02:41:50,020 --> 02:41:50,880
I'm stuck.

4796
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:51,740
I'm getting off.

4797
02:41:51,740 --> 02:41:52,060
I'm going.

4798
02:41:52,280 --> 02:41:53,080
Yeah, I'm stuck.

4799
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:53,860
It's okay, I'm coming.

4800
02:41:54,220 --> 02:41:55,420
Okay, we're here.

4801
02:41:56,840 --> 02:41:58,320
I'm coming, I'm coming.

4802
02:41:58,660 --> 02:41:59,600
Alright, let's go.

4803
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:01,320
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

4804
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:02,240
I've arrived.

4805
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:03,760
Alright, here we go.

4806
02:42:03,940 --> 02:42:04,600
So sorry.

4807
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:07,320
I'm here.

4808
02:42:07,400 --> 02:42:08,440
Do I have to hit it for it to count?

4809
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:09,120
No, no, no.

4810
02:42:09,340 --> 02:42:09,980
We just have to...

4811
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:11,140
You just gotta witness.

4812
02:42:12,140 --> 02:42:13,200
Don't die from this.

4813
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:14,060
I'm witnessing a murder, it's okay.

4814
02:42:14,360 --> 02:42:16,580
Just stay far away.

4815
02:42:16,900 --> 02:42:19,820
We just have to kill it, but you can capture it if you want to.

4816
02:42:25,570 --> 02:42:25,970
Alright.

4817
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:28,290
You wanna capture it, Turf4?

4818
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:29,290
I can try.

4819
02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:30,970
I don't know what the percentage is though.

4820
02:42:31,490 --> 02:42:32,290
I don't know either.

4821
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:34,950
If it's like super low, we just fucking...

4822
02:42:35,770 --> 02:42:36,370
kill it.

4823
02:42:36,670 --> 02:42:38,170
Oh my god, my uni bullet.

4824
02:42:40,770 --> 02:42:41,690
Go, tanking!

4825
02:42:43,570 --> 02:42:44,510
Oh, he's almost dead.

4826
02:42:45,390 --> 02:42:46,550
I'm retreating mine.

4827
02:42:48,830 --> 02:42:50,470
It's 6%, just kill it.

4828
02:42:50,630 --> 02:42:50,970
Just...

4829
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:52,070
Okay.

4830
02:42:53,810 --> 02:42:55,510
Grass type versus fire!

4831
02:42:55,630 --> 02:42:57,510
What's the worst thing that can happen?

4832
02:42:57,950 --> 02:42:58,230
Grass type versus fire!

4833
02:42:58,230 --> 02:42:58,230
What's the worst thing that can happen?

4834
02:42:58,230 --> 02:43:00,470
It didn't want to join the family, now it must die.

4835
02:43:00,470 --> 02:43:01,790
Yeah, now it must die.

4836
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:02,470
Alright, nice.

4837
02:43:02,790 --> 02:43:03,670
Picture, picture!

4838
02:43:08,110 --> 02:43:09,410
We did it!

4839
02:43:09,430 --> 02:43:09,650
We did it!

4840
02:43:09,650 --> 02:43:10,150
Clip, clip, clip!

4841
02:43:10,350 --> 02:43:13,290
I hereby confirm I have witnessed the murder.

4842
02:43:13,550 --> 02:43:14,490
I was here.

4843
02:43:15,530 --> 02:43:16,370
I was here.

4844
02:43:16,950 --> 02:43:17,990
I participated.

4845
02:43:18,510 --> 02:43:20,070
I am guilty.

4846
02:43:20,830 --> 02:43:22,010
Alright, next dungeon?

4847
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:24,150
Next dungeon, well I need to find it.

4848
02:43:24,370 --> 02:43:25,490
Alright, you guys can leave now.

4849
02:43:26,830 --> 02:43:29,070
You guys can leave, I'll go find the next one.

4850
02:43:29,070 --> 02:43:29,490
I'll do courts then.

4851
02:43:29,490 --> 02:43:32,650
Let me know when you guys all leave and I'll dismantle this.

4852
02:43:32,970 --> 02:43:33,890
I left.

4853
02:43:33,950 --> 02:43:35,050
You should let me dismantle.

4854
02:43:35,050 --> 02:43:36,170
Okay, yeah, you can dismantle it.

4855
02:43:37,070 --> 02:43:38,970
Okay, I'm gone.

4856
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:40,390
Are you gonna dismantle this here for?

4857
02:43:41,170 --> 02:43:41,570
Yeah.

4858
02:43:41,730 --> 02:43:44,970
Alright, I'm gonna fucking head somewhere else then.

4859
02:43:46,130 --> 02:43:47,830
Smoke Peepy's still at that base.

4860
02:43:47,990 --> 02:43:48,690
No, I'm out.

4861
02:43:49,370 --> 02:43:50,010
She's out.

4862
02:43:50,570 --> 02:43:51,370
I'm out too.

4863
02:43:52,310 --> 02:43:55,390
I'm gonna go find the...

4864
02:43:55,390 --> 02:43:56,970
I'm gonna go to the other sanctuaries.

4865
02:43:57,830 --> 02:43:58,570
And then...

4866
02:43:58,570 --> 02:43:59,010
I'm gonna make...

4867
02:43:59,490 --> 02:44:01,150
I'm gonna make a base near the courts.

4868
02:44:01,450 --> 02:44:02,090
Yes, please!

4869
02:44:03,450 --> 02:44:04,550
That'd be super helpful.

4870
02:44:04,730 --> 02:44:06,610
I'm gonna make... I wanna make...

4871
02:44:07,410 --> 02:44:09,150
Actually, we can do the photos later then.

4872
02:44:09,210 --> 02:44:10,150
I'll just find the other dungeon.

4873
02:44:12,610 --> 02:44:14,010
Do I have any food on me?

4874
02:44:14,810 --> 02:44:15,170
No...

4875
02:44:16,510 --> 02:44:17,650
Is there any food at base?

4876
02:44:17,670 --> 02:44:18,010
Or no?

4877
02:44:19,950 --> 02:44:22,010
Check the pal food thing.

4878
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:25,250
There should be at least some honey and some other stuff.

4879
02:44:25,370 --> 02:44:26,750
Cause I'm done with the cakes.

4880
02:44:26,870 --> 02:44:27,770
I don't need to make any more cakes.

4881
02:44:29,490 --> 02:44:30,350
I'll eat the honey then.

4882
02:44:32,990 --> 02:44:34,310
Yeah, we're not breeding anything.

4883
02:44:34,370 --> 02:44:36,490
Sounds like what is it with flesh tubers and quarks?

4884
02:44:36,730 --> 02:44:41,350
I mean, if you can avoid eating the honey, I mean, if you can avoid eating the honey, that's probably the harder one for us to...

4885
02:44:41,350 --> 02:44:42,470
Okay, I'll get the egg.

4886
02:44:43,390 --> 02:44:44,410
I'll get the milk then.

4887
02:44:45,590 --> 02:44:48,310
Okay, cause my pals need milk.

4888
02:44:50,130 --> 02:44:50,530
I...

4889
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:55,950
Yeah, if we wanna actually just fill the ranch with like, Yeah, if we wanna actually just fill the ranch with like, chickens, we can just have a fuck ton of eggs.

4890
02:44:56,630 --> 02:44:59,370
Or fill it with the cows and then we can have milk.

4891
02:44:59,370 --> 02:45:01,620
We need a production assembly line.

4892
02:45:02,010 --> 02:45:02,730
Let's see, what do I need?

4893
02:45:03,370 --> 02:45:05,630
Dude, I'm gonna find the other...

4894
02:45:05,630 --> 02:45:07,150
I'm gonna go find the other dungeon.

4895
02:45:10,010 --> 02:45:10,590
Okay.

4896
02:45:11,310 --> 02:45:11,890
Uh...

4897
02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:14,210
Volcanic cavern dungeon.

4898
02:45:14,430 --> 02:45:15,370
That's a level 40.

4899
02:45:16,110 --> 02:45:18,910
That is all the way down here.

4900
02:45:18,990 --> 02:45:20,030
On the edge.

4901
02:45:22,650 --> 02:45:23,810
Where's the...

4902
02:45:25,090 --> 02:45:26,810
How the fuck do I get there?

4903
02:45:28,030 --> 02:45:31,630
Trevor, are you okay with like, destroying the base later, when I find the dungeon?

4904
02:45:33,490 --> 02:45:33,850
Uh...

4905
02:45:34,610 --> 02:45:37,250
Yeah, I mean, just let them farm some quartz real fast.

4906
02:45:37,570 --> 02:45:42,050
As long... as soon as you have the base just let me know, and then I'll get the quartz.

4907
02:45:42,170 --> 02:45:43,070
Just like this way, okay?

4908
02:45:43,250 --> 02:45:43,550
Alright,

4909
02:45:46,990 --> 02:45:47,950
here I go.

4910
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:51,550
I'm heading over to the volcanic dungeon.

4911
02:45:52,730 --> 02:45:54,530
Oh hey, there's some chicken I can kill for food.

4912
02:45:55,090 --> 02:45:56,710
Oh yeah, we need to take that photo

4913
02:46:03,630 --> 02:46:07,730
There's a statue in the middle of the crater.

4914
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:09,530
We have to take a photo with it.

4915
02:46:09,650 --> 02:46:11,510
We all need that advanced armor.

4916
02:46:11,790 --> 02:46:12,730
I just don't think it's worth it.

4917
02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:14,690
You can live.

4918
02:46:15,250 --> 02:46:17,470
If it's one second, you'll be fine.

4919
02:46:17,870 --> 02:46:19,390
We can live for a hot second.

4920
02:46:20,730 --> 02:46:22,550
Yeah, you just need a photo.

4921
02:46:23,470 --> 02:46:27,210
Just a little burn is not too bad, you know?

4922
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:28,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4923
02:46:29,410 --> 02:46:29,970
Like what?

4924
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:30,590
You're some coward?

4925
02:46:31,530 --> 02:46:33,650
Alright, I'm making the pal box at the...

4926
02:46:33,650 --> 02:46:34,230
...

4927
02:46:37,710 --> 02:46:39,210
I'll kill you so I can eat your meat.

4928
02:46:41,690 --> 02:46:42,290
There you go.

4929
02:46:42,370 --> 02:46:43,230
I got enough meat now.

4930
02:46:44,330 --> 02:46:44,730
Alright.

4931
02:46:45,370 --> 02:46:46,010
Tirok, go!

4932
02:46:49,030 --> 02:46:50,330
Heading for the other dungeon.

4933
02:46:50,410 --> 02:46:51,750
Where the fuck that is?

4934
02:46:51,750 --> 02:46:53,010
The courts are on the pal box.

4935
02:46:53,850 --> 02:46:54,250
Oogie.

4936
02:46:58,460 --> 02:47:02,100
How much time do you need, Tirok, for it to get the hard bosses?

4937
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:04,320
I need the better balls.

4938
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:06,500
That's the only thing that's stopping me right now.

4939
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:07,860
Leave me be!

4940
02:47:07,860 --> 02:47:08,940
And it's just the courts, right?

4941
02:47:09,060 --> 02:47:11,080
The courts that's stopping you from making those balls?

4942
02:47:11,940 --> 02:47:13,300
Because I need the circuit boards.

4943
02:47:13,500 --> 02:47:14,020
But I got some...

4944
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:18,740
Yeah, we need to make the oven first before we can use the circuit boards for anything else.

4945
02:47:18,740 --> 02:47:19,420
You think we can get that?

4946
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:23,080
You think an hour is enough for you to catch the bosses?

4947
02:47:23,080 --> 02:47:24,460
What the fuck is that?

4948
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:24,820
Yeah.

4949
02:47:25,940 --> 02:47:27,120
I mean, they die fast.

4950
02:47:27,460 --> 02:47:28,400
Alright, so we just...

4951
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:29,460
Just getting to them, that's the problem.

4952
02:47:29,860 --> 02:47:37,760
We just need to make sure we get everything ready for sure for in an hour so then he can speedrun catching the hard bosses.

4953
02:47:38,820 --> 02:47:39,900
I'm working on it.

4954
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:42,220
Yeah, he just dropped me at the courts.

4955
02:47:42,340 --> 02:47:42,640
I'll...

4956
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:45,580
Yeah, I made the base there.

4957
02:47:45,820 --> 02:47:46,800
Alright, Lily, it's time.

4958
02:47:46,900 --> 02:47:47,560
Go, pal.

4959
02:47:47,640 --> 02:47:48,460
Go, Lily, pal.

4960
02:47:48,580 --> 02:47:48,780
Go.

4961
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:49,100
I'm going.

4962
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:50,100
Wait, let me go, too.

4963
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:52,620
A fast travel point.

4964
02:47:52,740 --> 02:47:53,060
Okay.

4965
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:53,800
I'll be right there.

4966
02:47:54,780 --> 02:47:56,980
Do I need a special armor to survive there?

4967
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:58,320
Just Tundra.

4968
02:47:58,460 --> 02:47:59,440
You need the cold armor.

4969
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:01,160
Oh, just kidding.

4970
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:01,780
You need cold armor.

4971
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:04,540
Then I'll have to make that first.

4972
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:06,000
Unless you don't need it right now.

4973
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:08,040
You can just drop it for me.

4974
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:15,400
If you have any... If you have a fire resistance armor or anything, I can buy you two shirts.

4975
02:48:17,080 --> 02:48:18,800
I do have a fire resistance.

4976
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:19,280
Wait, what's the...

4977
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:20,440
This is a heat resistance.

4978
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:22,480
Oh, I found the dungeon.

4979
02:48:22,480 --> 02:48:23,480
I found it already.

4980
02:48:23,700 --> 02:48:24,220
Oh, nice.

4981
02:48:25,300 --> 02:48:25,960
Okay, sure.

4982
02:48:26,020 --> 02:48:27,600
For it's time to destroy that base.

4983
02:48:29,220 --> 02:48:29,940
Not yet.

4984
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:31,400
Not yet.

4985
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:33,000
We need that court.

4986
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:34,060
But I found it.

4987
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:35,380
Or I'll just go mine the courts.

4988
02:48:35,580 --> 02:48:37,960
I don't give a fuck if you found it or not, bro.

4989
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:40,320
You want me to catch those legendary or what?

4990
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:41,800
Okay, I'll mark it.

4991
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:42,840
I'll mark it.

4992
02:48:43,180 --> 02:48:43,800
Where am I?

4993
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:44,320
Wait, what the fuck?

4994
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:45,860
I'm going to mark this right now.

4995
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:48,540
It's like 250 minutes, so we have like lots of time for this.

4996
02:48:49,860 --> 02:48:50,220
Uh...

4997
02:48:50,860 --> 02:48:51,220
E...

4998
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:52,660
That was fast though.

4999
02:48:52,700 --> 02:48:53,860
I didn't expect to find that.

5000
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:58,300
Alright, I'm gonna really quick just get this fast travel.

5001
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:01,020
Alright, I found the...

5002
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:02,100
Oh, there you go.

5003
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:03,500
No, that's fucking ore.

5004
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:06,180
Oh my god, this one was...

5005
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:07,300
Okay, I'm at a fast travel.

5006
02:49:07,400 --> 02:49:07,880
I'm all out.

5007
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:09,260
There's a town along the south coast.

5008
02:49:09,620 --> 02:49:10,000
Okay.

5009
02:49:10,100 --> 02:49:10,720
Oh, there it is.

5010
02:49:13,720 --> 02:49:15,600
Okay, I found that here.

5011
02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:18,040
Then...

5012
02:49:21,220 --> 02:49:21,780
Is that the one?

5013
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:24,840
Why?

5014
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:28,600
Legendary or first?

5015
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:31,380
Guys, I'm not high level enough to do a legendary.

5016
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:32,920
Surefire is the only closest one.

5017
02:49:34,940 --> 02:49:37,120
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to be killing a legendary.

5018
02:49:37,160 --> 02:49:40,280
Yeah, and if he can't kill a legendary, I can't kill a legendary.

5019
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:41,860
I mean, I can probably kill it.

5020
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:44,760
I mean, we can get points from killing it.

5021
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:47,160
Yeah, we still get half points from killing.

5022
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:48,200
Yeah.

5023
02:49:49,300 --> 02:49:50,780
I mean, 180 is better than nothing.

5024
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,600
Okay, I die already fast in the cold.

5025
02:49:53,260 --> 02:49:55,100
180 is already hard in the base.

5026
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:56,860
I can mine it, don't worry.

5027
02:49:57,780 --> 02:49:59,260
I can give you really cold...

5028
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:01,380
You need like cold armor, right?

5029
02:50:01,460 --> 02:50:01,680
Cold resistance.

5030
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:03,420
Okay, I can give you... I can get you one.

5031
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:06,560
I'm going back to base and I'll make you one.

5032
02:50:07,220 --> 02:50:07,580
Nice.

5033
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:10,380
I have the quartz in no time.

5034
02:50:12,300 --> 02:50:12,960
10 minutes.

5035
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:14,340
Let's see.

5036
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:17,300
No, this thing is so long.

5037
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:19,160
Let me see.

5038
02:50:19,820 --> 02:50:20,900
Let me see if I upgrade.

5039
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:22,660
Is a normal Tundra outfit okay?

5040
02:50:23,800 --> 02:50:24,480
I think so.

5041
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:25,620
I don't know.

5042
02:50:26,940 --> 02:50:29,560
Trevor, is a normal Tundra outfit okay or does she need like the...

5043
02:50:29,560 --> 02:50:30,440
I don't know.

5044
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:32,420
Alright, I'm just going to make a normal one.

5045
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:33,700
Then maybe it'll be fine.

5046
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:36,540
I know I can buy two undershirts.

5047
02:50:36,660 --> 02:50:40,400
I know if you have heat resistance, I can buy two cold undershirts.

5048
02:50:40,420 --> 02:50:41,900
I do have heat resistance.

5049
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:44,740
Yeah, then I'll just go buy the two undershirts.

5050
02:50:46,040 --> 02:50:47,420
It would be Bingqiling.

5051
02:50:48,380 --> 02:50:49,600
Actually, I don't know.

5052
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:52,700
Chat says high or low protection is better, so I'll give you...

5053
02:50:52,700 --> 02:50:54,220
I'll make it a normal one then.

5054
02:50:54,440 --> 02:50:54,880
It's okay.

5055
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:58,200
I'm making her a pelt right now.

5056
02:50:58,400 --> 02:50:58,680
Okay.

5057
02:50:59,380 --> 02:51:00,860
Oh no, my pelt's hungry.

5058
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:06,380
Wherever I can find the higher crafting area because this is a fucking mess right now.

5059
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:07,000
I'm just...

5060
02:51:08,680 --> 02:51:10,480
Where is it?

5061
02:51:10,660 --> 02:51:10,860
Climbing.

5062
02:51:12,220 --> 02:51:13,100
Oh, there it is.

5063
02:51:13,740 --> 02:51:15,100
Cold resistant pelt.

5064
02:51:15,260 --> 02:51:16,560
Man, I'm not having any luck here.

5065
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:18,020
I thought that there was going to be a bunch of...

5066
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:19,020
Alright, Lily got you.

5067
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:19,320
...forts here.

5068
02:51:19,420 --> 02:51:19,780
There's none.

5069
02:51:24,390 --> 02:51:24,910
Here.

5070
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:27,290
Where are you?

5071
02:51:27,850 --> 02:51:28,370
Here.

5072
02:51:28,390 --> 02:51:29,110
In the base.

5073
02:51:31,070 --> 02:51:31,590
Drop.

5074
02:51:34,530 --> 02:51:34,930
There you go.

5075
02:51:35,390 --> 02:51:35,910
Boom.

5076
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:36,630
Thank you.

5077
02:51:37,830 --> 02:51:38,530
Wham bam.

5078
02:51:39,270 --> 02:51:40,930
Now you can go farm stuff.

5079
02:51:43,170 --> 02:51:44,330
Back to palling.

5080
02:51:46,030 --> 02:51:46,890
Let's see.

5081
02:51:48,570 --> 02:51:49,530
Oh shit.

5082
02:51:49,530 --> 02:51:51,010
Just palling around.

5083
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:51,830
Just palling around.

5084
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:56,170
Just trying to see what I can put away.

5085
02:51:56,650 --> 02:51:59,630
I have a lot of eggs, but I don't think we need to hatch anything.

5086
02:51:59,630 --> 02:52:01,570
I'm going to fly back to b-b-b-bay.

5087
02:52:03,550 --> 02:52:07,850
Oh my god, there's a lot of worms I need.

5088
02:52:09,170 --> 02:52:10,030
Let's see.

5089
02:52:10,070 --> 02:52:10,350
Checking.

5090
02:52:10,350 --> 02:52:11,170
I want to see.

5091
02:52:11,370 --> 02:52:12,170
I want P.A.

5092
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:12,370
to see.

5093
02:52:12,370 --> 02:52:14,070
I'll catch the valet then.

5094
02:52:14,470 --> 02:52:15,990
Where the fuck is the valet?

5095
02:52:16,190 --> 02:52:16,590
Okay.

5096
02:52:17,190 --> 02:52:17,630
Alright.

5097
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:19,390
I am so close to being able to make her.

5098
02:52:20,170 --> 02:52:20,870
Legendary balls.

5099
02:52:21,910 --> 02:52:22,390
Legendary?

5100
02:52:22,450 --> 02:52:23,150
Almost there.

5101
02:52:23,410 --> 02:52:25,190
Tell me more about your legendary balls.

5102
02:52:26,130 --> 02:52:26,610
What?

5103
02:52:27,470 --> 02:52:27,950
Valet.

5104
02:52:28,510 --> 02:52:28,990
Pal.

5105
02:52:29,150 --> 02:52:29,630
World.

5106
02:52:30,550 --> 02:52:31,030
Location.

5107
02:52:31,610 --> 02:52:32,290
I'm Zoe.

5108
02:52:33,270 --> 02:52:34,210
I forgive you.

5109
02:52:34,350 --> 02:52:36,110
I don't actually want to know about that.

5110
02:52:36,390 --> 02:52:37,250
That's what I thought.

5111
02:52:38,750 --> 02:52:40,350
Make sure you check for lumps though.

5112
02:52:41,090 --> 02:52:42,190
Have you checked your balls?

5113
02:52:42,430 --> 02:52:42,650
It's important.

5114
02:52:43,270 --> 02:52:44,350
Check for your balls?

5115
02:52:44,430 --> 02:52:46,810
I would say check for them yourselves, but you guys don't have balls.

5116
02:52:47,390 --> 02:52:48,070
Oh man.

5117
02:52:48,210 --> 02:52:48,910
No balls.

5118
02:52:49,030 --> 02:52:49,370
I'm sorry.

5119
02:52:49,390 --> 02:52:50,230
I have loads of ballage.

5120
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:51,850
I do have loads of ballage.

5121
02:52:52,030 --> 02:52:53,830
What the fuck did I just do?

5122
02:52:53,910 --> 02:52:54,750
Loads of ballage.

5123
02:52:54,830 --> 02:52:55,030
Okay.

5124
02:52:55,150 --> 02:52:55,350
It's fine.

5125
02:52:55,490 --> 02:52:55,910
It's fine.

5126
02:52:55,950 --> 02:52:56,030
Yeah.

5127
02:52:56,330 --> 02:52:57,270
Oh, there it is.

5128
02:52:58,170 --> 02:53:00,650
I'll catch the valet right now.

5129
02:53:01,110 --> 02:53:01,610
We didn't.

5130
02:53:01,610 --> 02:53:02,610
We didn't want to have.

5131
02:53:02,790 --> 02:53:03,450
We didn't.

5132
02:53:04,110 --> 02:53:05,210
It's over here.

5133
02:53:05,330 --> 02:53:06,830
We didn't want to have a lodging site.

5134
02:53:06,990 --> 02:53:07,470
That was.

5135
02:53:07,750 --> 02:53:08,150
No.

5136
02:53:08,430 --> 02:53:10,150
I'm almost there.

5137
02:53:10,970 --> 02:53:12,270
How much polymer can I make?

5138
02:53:17,360 --> 02:53:18,160
Hey dude.

5139
02:53:18,260 --> 02:53:19,040
Could you get out of the way?

5140
02:53:19,080 --> 02:53:19,300
I'm sorry.

5141
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:19,620
I'm sorry.

5142
02:53:19,620 --> 02:53:21,160
I still haven't found any lucky pals.

5143
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:23,140
We're not lucky.

5144
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:24,540
I can't believe it.

5145
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:25,920
We're not lucky enough!

5146
02:53:26,240 --> 02:53:28,100
I haven't even seen Uno.

5147
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:32,200
Why aren't you lucky?

5148
02:53:34,100 --> 02:53:37,360
Because my stats on spawn...

5149
02:53:40,500 --> 02:53:41,700
I fucked up.

5150
02:53:42,620 --> 02:53:45,860
Alright, I should be able to make legendary bowls soon and then I can...

5151
02:53:47,480 --> 02:53:48,420
Start catching them.

5152
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:49,440
Alright, alright, calm down.

5153
02:53:49,440 --> 02:53:50,640
How are you hungry right now?

5154
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:52,500
Calm down?

5155
02:53:54,540 --> 02:53:55,440
They're legendary.

5156
02:53:55,580 --> 02:53:56,060
Calm down.

5157
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:57,680
We heard your first time.

5158
02:53:57,760 --> 02:53:59,240
I'm going AFK 20 minutes.

5159
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:05,320
What did you do, PP?

5160
02:54:05,980 --> 02:54:07,240
I'm so sorry!

5161
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:08,560
This is it.

5162
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:09,020
We're kicking.

5163
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:09,860
We're kicking now.

5164
02:54:11,400 --> 02:54:13,640
Stop calling HR on me!

5165
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:14,300
We're kicking.

5166
02:54:15,560 --> 02:54:17,700
We need a teammate replacement right now.

5167
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,740
No, I need to... alright, I'm moving the logging site.

5168
02:54:20,740 --> 02:54:21,660
I'm so sorry.

5169
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:24,040
Ow.

5170
02:54:24,260 --> 02:54:25,500
Oh shit, no, this is not good.

5171
02:54:25,860 --> 02:54:26,760
This is not good.

5172
02:54:26,820 --> 02:54:27,400
I'm not dodging.

5173
02:54:29,480 --> 02:54:32,860
Okay, do we have a rough idea of how much coins we need in 150m?

5174
02:54:32,860 --> 02:54:33,760
Holy shit!

5175
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:34,320
Fuck.

5176
02:54:34,880 --> 02:54:36,860
I think we might be fine, actually.

5177
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:39,280
Oh shit, at night it's very cold.

5178
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:41,660
Oh my goodness, I think I'm dying at this pace.

5179
02:54:41,660 --> 02:54:41,960
Wait, what?

5180
02:54:42,080 --> 02:54:43,400
What happened to the cold pill?

5181
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,240
I guess at night it's just too cold.

5182
02:54:47,080 --> 02:54:47,480
It depends.

5183
02:54:47,480 --> 02:54:50,160
PP, do you still need... quartz for anything?

5184
02:54:50,740 --> 02:54:52,520
Uh, yeah, so we need to make the circuit boards.

5185
02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:52,820
Let me see.

5186
02:54:52,860 --> 02:54:55,260
So we need to build the production assembly line.

5187
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:57,160
Um...

5188
02:54:58,580 --> 02:55:00,540
Which requires, I believe, 10 circuit boards.

5189
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:01,780
So we need the quartz.

5190
02:55:01,920 --> 02:55:04,000
I think we already... and we need polymers, too.

5191
02:55:04,500 --> 02:55:08,520
But we should have enough high quality pallet oil to make at least...

5192
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:09,540
No!

5193
02:55:09,540 --> 02:55:11,380
Uh, what's 36 divided by 2?

5194
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:12,240
We can make 18.

5195
02:55:12,600 --> 02:55:14,020
We can make 18 polymers.

5196
02:55:15,180 --> 02:55:17,380
So we can, I think, make that already.

5197
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:25,560
Uh, but we pretty much wanna skip past it because we don't wanna make the... wait, did we already make an advanced furnace?

5198
02:55:25,800 --> 02:55:26,900
Oh, nevermind, we already made it.

5199
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:28,380
Yeah, I made that.

5200
02:55:28,740 --> 02:55:30,480
Okay, okay, yeah, then we just need to...

5201
02:55:30,480 --> 02:55:35,200
Okay, cool, then we just need to make the production assembly line, or the... whatever it is.

5202
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:37,180
Uh, the production assembly line 2.

5203
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:39,720
The level 2 version.

5204
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:44,600
I need 20 nails then.

5205
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:45,600
Hmm.

5206
02:55:46,220 --> 02:55:54,200
And I think if we just get a few more quartz, I think that I need to get some palladium fragments and some more iron ingots.

5207
02:55:54,480 --> 02:55:54,960
Whew!

5208
02:55:55,100 --> 02:55:55,480
Okay.

5209
02:55:56,820 --> 02:55:58,180
Or, is it ingots?

5210
02:55:59,180 --> 02:56:00,320
I think I just need ore.

5211
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:01,720
You just need ore.

5212
02:56:01,940 --> 02:56:02,200
Yeah.

5213
02:56:03,320 --> 02:56:05,340
Because then I can make the legendary bowls.

5214
02:56:05,800 --> 02:56:06,240
Okay.

5215
02:56:08,980 --> 02:56:09,460
Uhhh...

5216
02:56:09,460 --> 02:56:11,580
Okay, we have 200 quartz now.

5217
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:13,460
Oh shit, that's a lot of quartz.

5218
02:56:13,620 --> 02:56:14,400
That should be enough.

5219
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:15,500
That should be enough.

5220
02:56:15,600 --> 02:56:16,220
Way more than enough.

5221
02:56:16,220 --> 02:56:16,240
Yeah, yeah.

5222
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:17,940
Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

5223
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:20,020
Um, circuit boards are what level?

5224
02:56:20,260 --> 02:56:21,940
I don't know if I can assist.

5225
02:56:22,260 --> 02:56:23,500
Uh, but...

5226
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:25,740
Circuit boards...

5227
02:56:25,740 --> 02:56:27,500
Circuit boards are from...

5228
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:29,000
Level...

5229
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:32,420
Level 35.

5230
02:56:32,900 --> 02:56:33,300
Okay.

5231
02:56:34,740 --> 02:56:35,780
Unfortunately, I cannot help.

5232
02:56:36,400 --> 02:56:38,080
Wait, there's no palladium fragments in here?

5233
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:42,340
Alright, uh, get ready to clip, I think, one of these eggs.

5234
02:56:42,420 --> 02:56:43,260
Wait, no, not this one.

5235
02:56:43,260 --> 02:56:46,680
Can you make more palladium off of the... the mill or whatever the fuck?

5236
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:47,780
Gung-do, hold up.

5237
02:56:48,100 --> 02:56:48,760
Just kidding.

5238
02:56:48,900 --> 02:56:49,580
Go, Lily, go.

5239
02:56:49,660 --> 02:56:50,220
Don't need to clip it.

5240
02:56:50,580 --> 02:56:50,940
Don't need to clip it.

5241
02:56:50,940 --> 02:56:51,680
Go, Lily, go.

5242
02:56:52,120 --> 02:56:53,000
Go, Lily, go.

5243
02:56:53,180 --> 02:56:53,300
Wait, what...

5244
02:56:53,300 --> 02:56:54,120
What happened to clipping?

5245
02:56:55,300 --> 02:56:56,380
Uh, wrong egg.

5246
02:56:57,200 --> 02:56:57,560
Nooooo!

5247
02:56:57,760 --> 02:56:59,280
The egg I needed is still 20 more minutes.

5248
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:00,780
Nooooo!

5249
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:01,240
Yeah.

5250
02:57:01,240 --> 02:57:01,400
I know.

5251
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:03,380
Sorry, I got your hopes up.

5252
02:57:04,060 --> 02:57:04,420
Not...

5253
02:57:04,420 --> 02:57:05,280
No, clip, clip, clip!

5254
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:07,040
No clip, clip, clip, I'm sorry.

5255
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:07,960
No clip, clip, clip.

5256
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:08,480
I'm so sorry.

5257
02:57:08,580 --> 02:57:09,120
I'm so sorry.

5258
02:57:09,180 --> 02:57:09,720
No clip, clip, clip.

5259
02:57:10,020 --> 02:57:11,280
I feel so lied to.

5260
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:11,920
Please forgive me.

5261
02:57:11,980 --> 02:57:12,820
Please forgive me.

5262
02:57:12,820 --> 02:57:13,280
No.

5263
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:14,720
No.

5264
02:57:15,980 --> 02:57:16,680
No forgiveness.

5265
02:57:17,360 --> 02:57:17,740
That's fair.

5266
02:57:17,740 --> 02:57:17,880
That's fair.

5267
02:57:17,940 --> 02:57:21,020
Okay, as soon as the night is over, they're gonna make the fragments.

5268
02:57:21,220 --> 02:57:23,160
I'm gonna farm some manually in the meantime.

5269
02:57:23,700 --> 02:57:24,700
Just leave me alone.

5270
02:57:24,880 --> 02:57:26,000
I have 40 now.

5271
02:57:26,860 --> 02:57:28,320
I don't know how much you need in total.

5272
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:30,860
Maybe 100 almost.

5273
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:32,720
Just a bunch, you know.

5274
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:34,700
Alright.

5275
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:35,760
But I'm gonna go manually farm.

5276
02:57:35,800 --> 02:57:37,760
I'm about to get a bunch of palladium fragments.

5277
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:38,180
Okay.

5278
02:57:38,200 --> 02:57:40,080
So mostly, mostly just try and get iron ore.

5279
02:57:40,340 --> 02:57:40,940
That's what we need.

5280
02:57:40,960 --> 02:57:41,160
Alright.

5281
02:57:42,460 --> 02:57:43,160
Iron ore?

5282
02:57:43,320 --> 02:57:44,120
Well, I can have a lot.

5283
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:44,940
I'm gonna finish this cement.

5284
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:54,980
Should we take the bat off of the mining station and put him on ore?

5285
02:57:57,160 --> 02:57:58,620
I think we can just mine the ore.

5286
02:57:58,900 --> 02:57:59,920
Are you fucking...

5287
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:00,160
Okay.

5288
02:58:00,300 --> 02:58:00,760
Manual?

5289
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:01,100
Yeah.

5290
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:01,300
Manually.

5291
02:58:01,540 --> 02:58:02,000
Yeah.

5292
02:58:02,180 --> 02:58:02,940
I'm on it.

5293
02:58:02,980 --> 02:58:05,000
I'm getting pinged so hard right now.

5294
02:58:05,340 --> 02:58:06,280
I'm getting...

5295
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:08,680
Cause we also need the rock for like the fragments.

5296
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:09,780
So I'm like, ah shit.

5297
02:58:10,460 --> 02:58:11,140
Turns out it's a rock.

5298
02:58:11,140 --> 02:58:11,280
We're gonna try that around.

5299
02:58:11,580 --> 02:58:12,660
Mining away.

5300
02:58:13,900 --> 02:58:14,840
Mining away.

5301
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:15,580
No I told you.

5302
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:21,680
You can move the base whenever now.

5303
02:58:21,780 --> 02:58:22,300
Okay.

5304
02:58:23,260 --> 02:58:27,380
Let me see if I can catch this fucking Valen then we can do that thing.

5305
02:58:27,880 --> 02:58:28,700
Oh, please.

5306
02:58:29,180 --> 02:58:30,620
Please just don't kill me.

5307
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:31,380
I'm so low.

5308
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:34,380
Gonna force this.

5309
02:58:35,160 --> 02:58:36,100
I can't.

5310
02:58:36,240 --> 02:58:37,580
Don't be kidding me.

5311
02:58:37,580 --> 02:58:37,720
Wait!

5312
02:58:40,420 --> 02:58:40,940
What?!

5313
02:58:49,090 --> 02:58:50,970
I cannot aim right now.

5314
02:58:51,090 --> 02:58:51,470
Alright.

5315
02:58:52,130 --> 02:58:54,350
Please don't kill me, please don't- No, no!

5316
02:58:56,290 --> 02:58:57,990
I wanted to make the Chillette saddle.

5317
02:58:59,330 --> 02:59:00,170
That was scary.

5318
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:02,650
Chillette, the best a man can get.

5319
02:59:09,190 --> 02:59:10,310
I'm trying, please.

5320
02:59:10,410 --> 02:59:11,430
It's 5%!

5321
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:13,370
I have 37...

5322
02:59:13,870 --> 02:59:14,910
I have 37 balls!

5323
02:59:17,390 --> 02:59:18,190
37 balls?

5324
02:59:18,450 --> 02:59:19,510
I have 37 giga balls!

5325
02:59:20,050 --> 02:59:21,250
I will force this!

5326
02:59:21,930 --> 02:59:22,850
It's 5%!

5327
02:59:22,850 --> 02:59:25,650
You're gonna force it- force your balls?

5328
02:59:25,710 --> 02:59:26,350
Get in here!

5329
02:59:27,090 --> 02:59:29,330
Get yourself in here, you stupid bug!

5330
02:59:29,330 --> 02:59:30,830
So close and into your balls is unhealthy!

5331
02:59:30,910 --> 02:59:31,670
I'm sorry, there we go.

5332
02:59:31,790 --> 02:59:32,370
Clip, clip, clip!

5333
02:59:32,430 --> 02:59:32,930
I got it!

5334
02:59:33,010 --> 02:59:33,490
Clip, clip, clip!

5335
02:59:33,610 --> 02:59:34,670
That's gotta be an OSHA violation.

5336
02:59:34,930 --> 02:59:36,430
I'm calling HR right now.

5337
02:59:36,730 --> 02:59:37,130
Alright.

5338
02:59:37,470 --> 02:59:40,630
Okay, anyway, I'm gonna go- I'm gonna repair and then we can do the dungeon.

5339
02:59:40,850 --> 02:59:41,810
Are you guys all ready for dungeon?

5340
02:59:42,830 --> 02:59:43,230
Yes.

5341
02:59:43,310 --> 02:59:43,630
Yep.

5342
02:59:43,630 --> 02:59:44,170
Alright, alright.

5343
02:59:44,270 --> 02:59:45,230
I'm just mining ore.

5344
02:59:45,350 --> 02:59:45,810
I need wounds.

5345
02:59:46,090 --> 02:59:46,690
Clip, clip, clip!

5346
02:59:46,830 --> 02:59:47,850
PP bot, I did it!

5347
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:50,050
I got the valet!

5348
02:59:50,050 --> 02:59:50,650
They're so proud of you!

5349
02:59:50,970 --> 02:59:51,730
They're so proud!

5350
02:59:52,190 --> 02:59:53,270
Alright, where are you guys?

5351
02:59:53,290 --> 02:59:55,550
Okay, I'm gonna repair my armor and then we can do the dungeon.

5352
02:59:56,450 --> 02:59:57,950
Alright, I'm gonna take half of this milk.

5353
02:59:58,190 --> 02:59:59,030
I need the milk.

5354
03:00:00,330 --> 03:00:01,090
Wait, no, fuck that.

5355
03:00:01,230 --> 03:00:02,570
I can- I can live without milk.

5356
03:00:02,590 --> 03:00:03,450
I'll take half the berries.

5357
03:00:03,550 --> 03:00:03,650
What?

5358
03:00:03,650 --> 03:00:05,150
There's like, lots of frozen- I'm gonna hatch these.

5359
03:00:05,410 --> 03:00:05,630
What?

5360
03:00:05,770 --> 03:00:07,270
Why am I aiming- what?!

5361
03:00:09,630 --> 03:00:12,770
We got a mouse, mouse, mouse, cat, mouse, cat, christ?

5362
03:00:13,570 --> 03:00:15,530
And, uh, another mouse, christ.

5363
03:00:15,650 --> 03:00:15,950
Okay.

5364
03:00:16,150 --> 03:00:18,270
Ohh, where the fuck is the repair bench?

5365
03:00:18,550 --> 03:00:18,990
Okay...

5366
03:00:20,990 --> 03:00:21,430
Ohh...

5367
03:00:22,930 --> 03:00:24,270
There's two repair benches.

5368
03:00:24,290 --> 03:00:24,930
Okay, I got it, okay.

5369
03:00:24,990 --> 03:00:27,030
I'm gonna go make the base now for us.

5370
03:00:27,350 --> 03:00:27,970
Okay, cool.

5371
03:00:30,470 --> 03:00:31,230
Alright, let's...

5372
03:00:31,230 --> 03:00:33,810
We only need 10 circuit boards, right?

5373
03:00:34,430 --> 03:00:35,650
Uh, we need a lot!

5374
03:00:35,850 --> 03:00:37,570
But, we need 10 for right now.

5375
03:00:37,910 --> 03:00:39,510
I need some more...

5376
03:00:39,510 --> 03:00:42,430
Did you guys destroy the base yet?

5377
03:00:44,530 --> 03:00:46,170
Did you destroy the base yet or no?

5378
03:00:47,690 --> 03:00:49,150
You're able to do that yourself.

5379
03:00:49,330 --> 03:00:50,070
Oh, I should be.

5380
03:00:50,210 --> 03:00:52,210
Oh yeah, and I get the materials automatically, right?

5381
03:00:52,330 --> 03:00:58,630
Okay, so for the electric kitchen, if you want to make that right now, sure, we only need five circuit boards for that.

5382
03:00:58,730 --> 03:01:03,710
And then for the exception, for the assembly line two, we need ten.

5383
03:01:03,790 --> 03:01:05,590
So we need to make like 15 circuit boards.

5384
03:01:06,250 --> 03:01:08,970
We need more high-grade oil then.

5385
03:01:09,510 --> 03:01:14,210
I put some high-grade oil in the chest because I fucking killed a lot of people.

5386
03:01:14,690 --> 03:01:16,390
Wait, do I have... am I holding some?

5387
03:01:16,570 --> 03:01:17,650
No, I'm not holding any.

5388
03:01:17,950 --> 03:01:20,710
We have 17 minutes and then an hour left.

5389
03:01:21,230 --> 03:01:23,870
Sorry, we have like one hour and 16 minutes left, so...

5390
03:01:24,890 --> 03:01:28,470
We need to like speed run some stuff after that mark.

5391
03:01:30,010 --> 03:01:33,230
At an hour mark, we should start taking photos of like petting the pals.

5392
03:01:33,670 --> 03:01:34,110
Yeah.

5393
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:34,950
Just to be sure.

5394
03:01:36,070 --> 03:01:37,610
Do you want to go to the dungeon now then?

5395
03:01:37,750 --> 03:01:39,390
Yeah, I'm heading over there for us.

5396
03:01:39,510 --> 03:01:39,730
Okay.

5397
03:01:39,810 --> 03:01:41,190
And getting that dungeon.

5398
03:01:41,630 --> 03:01:42,110
Alright.

5399
03:01:45,020 --> 03:01:47,260
Where the fuck did I put... oh, it's over here.

5400
03:01:47,360 --> 03:01:47,620
Alright.

5401
03:01:49,280 --> 03:01:50,780
I'm gonna destroy...

5402
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:53,560
Where is the other base?

5403
03:01:54,800 --> 03:01:57,160
Okay, I'm dismantling the quartz base then.

5404
03:01:57,520 --> 03:01:58,520
It's the one...

5405
03:01:59,100 --> 03:02:00,200
Shit, where is this?

5406
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:00,700
We're good on quartz, I think.

5407
03:02:00,700 --> 03:02:02,160
It's the one next to the quiver, right?

5408
03:02:03,400 --> 03:02:04,800
Is that the base?

5409
03:02:05,980 --> 03:02:07,160
The one next to the quiver?

5410
03:02:07,380 --> 03:02:07,600
Uh...

5411
03:02:08,640 --> 03:02:10,860
I don't see the map, but it's the one with the buff.

5412
03:02:10,860 --> 03:02:11,340
Anubis?

5413
03:02:11,400 --> 03:02:13,620
We still need the Anubis one, I think.

5414
03:02:13,760 --> 03:02:15,060
I don't know what that was.

5415
03:02:15,420 --> 03:02:16,140
It's the one above Anubis.

5416
03:02:17,200 --> 03:02:18,920
Uh... the one above Anubis.

5417
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:22,480
Can you guys like head there so I can see where it is?

5418
03:02:22,940 --> 03:02:24,980
Because I'm worried I'm gonna get the wrong base.

5419
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:27,280
Uh... okay.

5420
03:02:27,380 --> 03:02:29,540
The one that's like...

5421
03:02:30,020 --> 03:02:31,400
Do you see the quiver?

5422
03:02:32,400 --> 03:02:33,060
Yeah, I'm at the quiver.

5423
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:34,020
The base that's near the quiver?

5424
03:02:34,100 --> 03:02:34,920
Don't destroy that one.

5425
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:35,240
Oh, okay.

5426
03:02:35,340 --> 03:02:36,760
So the one above the...

5427
03:02:36,760 --> 03:02:37,500
Yeah, the one above.

5428
03:02:37,560 --> 03:02:38,280
The highest one, right?

5429
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:39,140
Yep, yep.

5430
03:02:39,180 --> 03:02:40,040
The highest one you can destroy.

5431
03:02:40,040 --> 03:02:40,520
Okay, I'll destroy that.

5432
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:40,720
Yeah.

5433
03:02:41,400 --> 03:02:42,020
All right.

5434
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:42,440
Yep.

5435
03:02:42,520 --> 03:02:43,820
Okay, I'm making the base now.

5436
03:02:45,540 --> 03:02:47,100
Oh... is it near anything?

5437
03:02:47,900 --> 03:02:52,660
We'll be base level 20 once we do pretty much just the production line, I think.

5438
03:02:52,780 --> 03:02:54,620
And then... because we already have the electric.

5439
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:57,360
So we should be automatically level 20.

5440
03:02:57,500 --> 03:02:57,560
All right.

5441
03:02:57,560 --> 03:02:58,820
Which is the thing I needed to make?

5442
03:02:59,040 --> 03:02:59,520
Head over.

5443
03:02:59,900 --> 03:03:02,540
Assembly line and the electric cooker.

5444
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:04,140
Electric kitchen?

5445
03:03:04,480 --> 03:03:07,040
Yeah, electric kitchen and the assembly line.

5446
03:03:07,120 --> 03:03:07,720
All right, guys.

5447
03:03:07,780 --> 03:03:08,600
You can head over now.

5448
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:09,380
I made the base.

5449
03:03:09,380 --> 03:03:10,380
Also, we have 400.

5450
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:10,940
400 ore.

5451
03:03:11,060 --> 03:03:13,360
You can kill whatever you need while we do the dungeon.

5452
03:03:13,660 --> 03:03:14,060
Nice.

5453
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:14,420
Suit.

5454
03:03:14,580 --> 03:03:15,440
All right, I'm waiting.

5455
03:03:15,720 --> 03:03:17,760
All right, I'm looking for you at the base.

5456
03:03:17,820 --> 03:03:18,040
Okay.

5457
03:03:19,280 --> 03:03:20,100
On my way.

5458
03:03:20,560 --> 03:03:21,940
We're here waiting.

5459
03:03:22,020 --> 03:03:22,460
Wing my way.

5460
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:23,180
We're here waiting.

5461
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:23,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5462
03:03:24,860 --> 03:03:25,260
Cool.

5463
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:26,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5464
03:03:26,980 --> 03:03:27,840
I'm here to wait.

5465
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:28,680
It's pretty over here.

5466
03:03:29,100 --> 03:03:29,940
It's up here, PP.

5467
03:03:30,520 --> 03:03:32,020
All right, I'm just gonna grab this left monk.

5468
03:03:32,320 --> 03:03:35,440
I'm gonna check what the last dungeon that defined.

5469
03:03:36,660 --> 03:03:37,060
Oh.

5470
03:03:37,620 --> 03:03:38,020
Oh.

5471
03:03:38,580 --> 03:03:38,660
Oh.

5472
03:03:39,780 --> 03:03:40,180
Oh.

5473
03:03:40,500 --> 03:03:41,580
It's mega pretty over here.

5474
03:03:42,540 --> 03:03:45,120
I see the sacred mountain dungeon.

5475
03:03:45,220 --> 03:03:46,620
What level do we have to be for that?

5476
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:47,680
Level 45.

5477
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:49,860
I think I can keep that.

5478
03:03:49,860 --> 03:03:51,620
Yeah, I think we can pull it off.

5479
03:03:52,020 --> 03:03:56,500
Well, sure, Fora and I can, but you guys might get insta-dived.

5480
03:03:57,360 --> 03:03:57,760
Yeah.

5481
03:03:59,220 --> 03:04:00,580
We'll just be in.

5482
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:02,140
You've got a shield, right?

5483
03:04:02,740 --> 03:04:03,540
A shield?

5484
03:04:03,660 --> 03:04:03,860
No.

5485
03:04:04,260 --> 03:04:05,300
Oh, I lost it.

5486
03:04:05,340 --> 03:04:06,020
Should've made you a shield.

5487
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:07,340
You had my loot.

5488
03:04:07,580 --> 03:04:08,760
My shield was in there.

5489
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:09,440
Oh, no.

5490
03:04:09,440 --> 03:04:09,460
All right.

5491
03:04:09,500 --> 03:04:09,860
I'll just wait.

5492
03:04:09,860 --> 03:04:10,140
Oh, wait.

5493
03:04:10,140 --> 03:04:10,660
Does that mean...

5494
03:04:10,660 --> 03:04:10,960
Oh, wait.

5495
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:11,540
I've got your shield.

5496
03:04:11,660 --> 03:04:12,040
Wait, hold on.

5497
03:04:12,080 --> 03:04:12,540
I've got your shield.

5498
03:04:13,880 --> 03:04:14,860
Here, I'm gonna drop it.

5499
03:04:14,960 --> 03:04:15,500
Are you near me?

5500
03:04:15,540 --> 03:04:15,740
You...

5501
03:04:15,740 --> 03:04:16,220
Yeah.

5502
03:04:16,340 --> 03:04:16,960
Let's see.

5503
03:04:17,280 --> 03:04:17,600
All right.

5504
03:04:17,600 --> 03:04:18,140
Here's your shield.

5505
03:04:18,740 --> 03:04:19,200
Let's go.

5506
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:21,020
I do have a shield.

5507
03:04:21,080 --> 03:04:21,800
You got a shield!

5508
03:04:21,820 --> 03:04:21,920
Oh, my God.

5509
03:04:21,980 --> 03:04:22,540
You have a shield!

5510
03:04:23,640 --> 03:04:24,140
Shield, shield!

5511
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:24,880
Let's go.

5512
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:27,360
What level are you right now, Surefour?

5513
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:30,160
47.

5514
03:04:30,500 --> 03:04:30,820
47.

5515
03:04:30,980 --> 03:04:31,580
Oh, you're almost 50.

5516
03:04:31,740 --> 03:04:34,660
We have one of the achievements to get to level 50.

5517
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:35,820
Yeah, a pal to level 50.

5518
03:04:36,260 --> 03:04:36,580
Yeah.

5519
03:04:37,260 --> 03:04:38,440
I'm coming over there.

5520
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:39,020
All right.

5521
03:04:39,140 --> 03:04:39,460
Second.

5522
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:43,140
Just gonna wait.

5523
03:04:43,600 --> 03:04:44,520
Let me see.

5524
03:04:44,720 --> 03:04:47,960
I guess after that, I'm gonna go travel to the sanctuaries after that.

5525
03:04:48,460 --> 03:04:49,160
I'm here.

5526
03:04:49,420 --> 03:04:49,780
All right.

5527
03:04:49,940 --> 03:04:50,680
Oh, shit.

5528
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:51,240
Oh, shit.

5529
03:04:51,360 --> 03:04:51,840
Oh, what happened?

5530
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:53,440
Uh, I'm...

5531
03:04:53,440 --> 03:04:55,180
Oh, where is that?

5532
03:04:55,180 --> 03:04:56,180
I'm gonna go inside before I die.

5533
03:04:56,220 --> 03:04:56,540
Inside?

5534
03:04:56,660 --> 03:04:57,560
Yeah, just get inside.

5535
03:04:58,360 --> 03:04:59,120
Yeah, let's go inside.

5536
03:04:59,120 --> 03:04:59,480
Oh, okay.

5537
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:00,040
Yeah, let's go inside.

5538
03:05:00,320 --> 03:05:01,500
Yeah, let's enter.

5539
03:05:03,520 --> 03:05:05,280
All right, let's go find...

5540
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:08,620
Let's go find the...

5541
03:05:09,220 --> 03:05:09,440
Oh, my God.

5542
03:05:09,460 --> 03:05:10,220
Oh, yeah.

5543
03:05:10,340 --> 03:05:11,200
We just don't...

5544
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:12,280
Make sure you don't get hit.

5545
03:05:12,660 --> 03:05:13,600
Just keep running.

5546
03:05:14,940 --> 03:05:16,300
Wait, did you get a wolf finally?

5547
03:05:16,660 --> 03:05:17,240
Pee-pee.

5548
03:05:17,620 --> 03:05:19,960
I forgot to fucking bring it though.

5549
03:05:21,740 --> 03:05:22,620
Oh, boy.

5550
03:05:22,880 --> 03:05:23,420
Pee-pee just...

5551
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:24,500
I might die actually.

5552
03:05:24,820 --> 03:05:25,360
Pee-pee, no.

5553
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:26,700
I'm so sorry.

5554
03:05:27,220 --> 03:05:28,200
I'm so sorry.

5555
03:05:28,520 --> 03:05:29,160
Just fly.

5556
03:05:29,180 --> 03:05:29,880
Just keep flying.

5557
03:05:30,020 --> 03:05:30,800
Just keep flying.

5558
03:05:32,500 --> 03:05:33,920
I'm looking back.

5559
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,360
So if she does get down, I'll fucking run back to her.

5560
03:05:36,580 --> 03:05:37,420
I'm running.

5561
03:05:37,540 --> 03:05:37,980
I'm running.

5562
03:05:38,060 --> 03:05:38,560
I'm running.

5563
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:38,920
I'm running.

5564
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:40,080
I'm running.

5565
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:40,480
Oh, the lava.

5566
03:05:40,520 --> 03:05:41,260
I'm so sorry.

5567
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:43,500
I made the saddle and everything, but I forgot to grab.

5568
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:44,960
No, it doesn't hurt.

5569
03:05:45,060 --> 03:05:45,740
This lava doesn't hurt.

5570
03:05:45,940 --> 03:05:46,000
Oh, shhh.

5571
03:05:46,300 --> 03:05:47,080
Oh, is it here?

5572
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:49,680
No, not this way.

5573
03:05:49,760 --> 03:05:50,140
No, okay.

5574
03:05:50,260 --> 03:05:50,520
It's okay.

5575
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:52,080
They're all a little bit borked right now.

5576
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:53,980
It's not this way, so we're turning back.

5577
03:05:54,840 --> 03:05:55,200
Okay.

5578
03:05:55,240 --> 03:05:55,840
It's so bright.

5579
03:05:55,980 --> 03:05:56,280
Jesus.

5580
03:05:56,360 --> 03:05:57,140
Fucking flashbang.

5581
03:05:57,160 --> 03:05:57,580
It's like...

5582
03:05:57,580 --> 03:05:58,380
Yeah, I know.

5583
03:05:58,820 --> 03:05:59,520
Oh, shit.

5584
03:06:00,220 --> 03:06:01,560
Which way did you guys go?

5585
03:06:01,700 --> 03:06:02,080
Um...

5586
03:06:02,080 --> 03:06:02,960
Look for it.

5587
03:06:03,160 --> 03:06:03,560
This way?

5588
03:06:04,200 --> 03:06:04,620
This way?

5589
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:05,080
Okay.

5590
03:06:05,380 --> 03:06:06,260
We'll find out.

5591
03:06:06,340 --> 03:06:07,240
We'll find it.

5592
03:06:07,300 --> 03:06:08,740
We'll try and find it.

5593
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:10,480
Oh, wait.

5594
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:12,020
You don't have any pallet with saddles?

5595
03:06:12,780 --> 03:06:13,060
No.

5596
03:06:13,460 --> 03:06:13,920
Oh, no.

5597
03:06:13,960 --> 03:06:14,240
Well, no.

5598
03:06:14,320 --> 03:06:14,700
Yeah, I do.

5599
03:06:14,760 --> 03:06:15,900
I've got wyvern, so I can fly.

5600
03:06:16,180 --> 03:06:16,460
Okay.

5601
03:06:16,460 --> 03:06:16,480
Just fly.

5602
03:06:16,700 --> 03:06:16,980
Okay.

5603
03:06:17,460 --> 03:06:18,100
Not this way?

5604
03:06:18,240 --> 03:06:18,440
Okay.

5605
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:19,220
Yeah, just fly.

5606
03:06:19,320 --> 03:06:20,840
I think it's just convenient at that point.

5607
03:06:23,020 --> 03:06:23,860
It's just doorways.

5608
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:24,820
It's only doorways.

5609
03:06:24,920 --> 03:06:26,620
I think it has to be this right side then.

5610
03:06:27,440 --> 03:06:27,720
Yep.

5611
03:06:28,580 --> 03:06:29,320
Should be at least.

5612
03:06:30,680 --> 03:06:31,460
I'm heading over.

5613
03:06:31,560 --> 03:06:31,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5614
03:06:31,940 --> 03:06:32,240
It's here.

5615
03:06:32,980 --> 03:06:33,340
All right.

5616
03:06:33,340 --> 03:06:33,780
Cool, cool, cool.

5617
03:06:33,860 --> 03:06:34,200
It's here.

5618
03:06:34,920 --> 03:06:35,560
Let's go fight.

5619
03:06:35,660 --> 03:06:36,060
Are we all here?

5620
03:06:36,800 --> 03:06:37,760
Just gotta wait for the pp.

5621
03:06:37,980 --> 03:06:38,260
Yep.

5622
03:06:38,300 --> 03:06:38,720
I'm right here.

5623
03:06:38,720 --> 03:06:39,300
All right.

5624
03:06:39,360 --> 03:06:39,760
Let's go.

5625
03:06:40,260 --> 03:06:42,700
I am consenting to witnessing a murder.

5626
03:06:42,800 --> 03:06:43,480
All right.

5627
03:06:43,480 --> 03:06:43,980
Here you go.

5628
03:06:44,920 --> 03:06:45,860
Let's go kill this.

5629
03:06:46,140 --> 03:06:48,360
I am consenting to witnessing a murder right now.

5630
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:49,600
911, please.

5631
03:06:49,720 --> 03:06:51,340
There's a murder happening right now.

5632
03:06:53,560 --> 03:06:54,420
Oh, my God.

5633
03:06:54,560 --> 03:06:55,840
I have no arrows now.

5634
03:06:55,960 --> 03:06:56,400
All right.

5635
03:06:57,620 --> 03:06:58,400
Go, Panking.

5636
03:06:58,800 --> 03:06:59,480
Go, Van.

5637
03:06:59,480 --> 03:07:00,020
Go, little guy.

5638
03:07:00,040 --> 03:07:00,760
You got this.

5639
03:07:01,080 --> 03:07:02,120
Well, I'm just gonna watch.

5640
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:05,680
I don't have any fucking weapons anymore.

5641
03:07:09,950 --> 03:07:10,430
No.

5642
03:07:10,470 --> 03:07:10,730
Okay.

5643
03:07:10,750 --> 03:07:11,150
Murder.

5644
03:07:12,310 --> 03:07:12,710
Yay.

5645
03:07:12,790 --> 03:07:13,190
Woohoo.

5646
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:18,660
You gonna catch him?

5647
03:07:18,940 --> 03:07:19,340
No.

5648
03:07:19,340 --> 03:07:19,640
Oh.

5649
03:07:19,780 --> 03:07:20,520
Clip, clip, clip.

5650
03:07:20,700 --> 03:07:21,440
Clip, clip, clip.

5651
03:07:21,540 --> 03:07:21,840
Clip, clip, clip.

5652
03:07:21,860 --> 03:07:22,260
Pp bar.

5653
03:07:22,300 --> 03:07:23,160
Let's clip, clip, clip.

5654
03:07:23,300 --> 03:07:23,980
Clip, clip, clip.

5655
03:07:24,220 --> 03:07:24,280
Clip, clip, clip.

5656
03:07:24,580 --> 03:07:25,360
We got it.

5657
03:07:26,520 --> 03:07:27,220
All right.

5658
03:07:27,480 --> 03:07:27,980
All right.

5659
03:07:27,980 --> 03:07:28,360
Nice.

5660
03:07:30,240 --> 03:07:30,640
Yay.

5661
03:07:30,940 --> 03:07:31,260
Woohoo.

5662
03:07:31,960 --> 03:07:32,200
Yay.

5663
03:07:33,140 --> 03:07:33,540
Woohoo.

5664
03:07:35,320 --> 03:07:36,020
Let's see.

5665
03:07:36,040 --> 03:07:37,780
I'm level 39 now.

5666
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:39,440
Someone fucking opened this.

5667
03:07:39,440 --> 03:07:39,560
Yeah.

5668
03:07:39,580 --> 03:07:40,380
I made the palcifice.

5669
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:42,040
I put my pail out there to die.

5670
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:46,000
I'm gonna go to the wildlife sanctuaries for us.

5671
03:07:46,140 --> 03:07:46,380
All right.

5672
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:48,780
That sounds like a good idea.

5673
03:07:49,020 --> 03:07:49,460
All right.

5674
03:07:49,600 --> 03:07:50,520
Let's get out here.

5675
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:52,780
I'm gonna try and start catching the boys.

5676
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:53,420
All right.

5677
03:07:53,420 --> 03:07:53,840
Where's the...

5678
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:54,340
What are we doing?

5679
03:07:54,340 --> 03:07:56,040
Did you build the electric cooker already?

5680
03:07:56,460 --> 03:07:56,980
Where's the...

5681
03:07:56,980 --> 03:07:57,520
What?

5682
03:07:57,660 --> 03:07:58,800
You built the electric cooker?

5683
03:07:58,960 --> 03:08:00,340
Or do we not have enough still?

5684
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:01,180
We got...

5685
03:08:01,180 --> 03:08:01,980
I built the electric kitchen.

5686
03:08:02,180 --> 03:08:02,640
Oh, okay.

5687
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:04,680
I think like either Peepee or Lily...

5688
03:08:04,680 --> 03:08:04,700
Oh, no.

5689
03:08:04,700 --> 03:08:05,360
There's not enough electricity.

5690
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:05,840
Yeah.

5691
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:09,500
Should work on the cheeseburger and the hot dog then.

5692
03:08:09,540 --> 03:08:09,720
Yeah.

5693
03:08:09,740 --> 03:08:10,700
We need to...

5694
03:08:10,700 --> 03:08:11,040
Yeah.

5695
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:11,940
We just need to get...

5696
03:08:11,940 --> 03:08:12,020
Yeah.

5697
03:08:12,020 --> 03:08:12,020
We just need to get...

5698
03:08:12,020 --> 03:08:12,720
You guys work on that.

5699
03:08:13,100 --> 03:08:14,340
The stuff built and that's it.

5700
03:08:14,680 --> 03:08:15,340
We do.

5701
03:08:15,500 --> 03:08:16,120
We got the kitchen now.

5702
03:08:16,400 --> 03:08:17,160
You got the kitchen now?

5703
03:08:17,300 --> 03:08:17,460
Yeah.

5704
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:18,920
But you already built it?

5705
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:19,360
Okay.

5706
03:08:19,560 --> 03:08:19,920
Yeah.

5707
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:20,580
So you guys can...

5708
03:08:20,580 --> 03:08:20,680
It's fucking...

5709
03:08:20,680 --> 03:08:21,100
It's Chris' fault.

5710
03:08:22,380 --> 03:08:22,740
I...

5711
03:08:23,340 --> 03:08:23,700
Sick.

5712
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:24,320
All right.

5713
03:08:24,360 --> 03:08:24,480
Okay.

5714
03:08:24,480 --> 03:08:25,420
Let me check my notes.

5715
03:08:25,980 --> 03:08:26,340
Sure.

5716
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:27,800
Four will get the hard bosses.

5717
03:08:27,940 --> 03:08:31,920
I'm gonna go get fly to the sanctuaries.

5718
03:08:33,880 --> 03:08:34,240
Okay.

5719
03:08:35,560 --> 03:08:36,220
Maserina cheese.

5720
03:08:36,900 --> 03:08:39,320
We need milk, flour, and tomatoes.

5721
03:08:39,400 --> 03:08:40,640
So we need two tomato seeds.

5722
03:08:40,860 --> 03:08:41,760
We can get the tomatoes.

5723
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:46,780
So we need two tomato seeds from the wandering merchant who's in the sand area.

5724
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:48,680
So actually, we might need to go back there.

5725
03:08:52,100 --> 03:08:55,780
Can anybody go to Dune Shelter and buy three tomato seeds?

5726
03:08:55,940 --> 03:08:56,920
I don't have the fast...

5727
03:08:56,920 --> 03:08:57,620
I don't have money.

5728
03:08:58,060 --> 03:08:59,160
Where's Dune Shelter?

5729
03:08:59,160 --> 03:08:59,540
I have money.

5730
03:08:59,620 --> 03:09:00,040
I have money.

5731
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:00,920
I can do it.

5732
03:09:00,920 --> 03:09:02,040
I can buy tomato seeds.

5733
03:09:02,120 --> 03:09:02,260
Okay.

5734
03:09:02,260 --> 03:09:02,800
Let me give you money.

5735
03:09:02,800 --> 03:09:03,840
I have tomato seeds here.

5736
03:09:04,360 --> 03:09:05,300
Oh, you got tomato seeds?

5737
03:09:05,340 --> 03:09:05,740
I have six.

5738
03:09:06,020 --> 03:09:06,620
All right.

5739
03:09:06,700 --> 03:09:07,100
Six!

5740
03:09:07,420 --> 03:09:08,000
All right.

5741
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:09,040
I have six tomato seeds.

5742
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:10,620
I'm gonna make some arrows real fast.

5743
03:09:10,660 --> 03:09:11,740
Why can't I pick it up?

5744
03:09:11,740 --> 03:09:12,080
There we go.

5745
03:09:12,360 --> 03:09:12,740
All right.

5746
03:09:12,740 --> 03:09:14,520
I'm gonna make tomato...

5747
03:09:14,520 --> 03:09:15,720
Oh, tomato plantation.

5748
03:09:17,600 --> 03:09:18,600
Can we get more coal?

5749
03:09:19,840 --> 03:09:21,860
What level do you need to be to do the tomato plantation?

5750
03:09:22,120 --> 03:09:23,600
I can go get more coal.

5751
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:23,900
Thank you.

5752
03:09:23,900 --> 03:09:24,880
Do we still have the coal farm?

5753
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:25,260
Okay.

5754
03:09:25,340 --> 03:09:26,560
So Lily, go get coal.

5755
03:09:26,860 --> 03:09:27,660
Uh, pee-pee.

5756
03:09:27,980 --> 03:09:28,300
No!

5757
03:09:29,420 --> 03:09:31,820
I'm one level too low to make the tomato plantation.

5758
03:09:31,960 --> 03:09:32,280
Okay.

5759
03:09:32,340 --> 03:09:32,980
I can make it.

5760
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:33,620
I can make it.

5761
03:09:33,800 --> 03:09:35,980
Can you make lettuce plantation too while you're at it?

5762
03:09:36,040 --> 03:09:36,460
Yeah, I can.

5763
03:09:36,580 --> 03:09:38,680
I'm just gonna get my arrows and then I can make it.

5764
03:09:38,760 --> 03:09:41,140
And then after that...

5765
03:09:41,140 --> 03:09:41,500
Okay.

5766
03:09:42,680 --> 03:09:43,640
Thank you.

5767
03:09:43,700 --> 03:09:45,660
Before I do our jobs or other jobs.

5768
03:09:46,360 --> 03:09:47,020
Okay.

5769
03:09:47,200 --> 03:09:47,920
Okay.

5770
03:09:47,920 --> 03:09:49,480
What level is lettuce and tomato?

5771
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,660
33 and like 30 something.

5772
03:09:53,360 --> 03:09:54,080
35.

5773
03:09:54,980 --> 03:09:58,220
35 is not bad.

5774
03:10:00,560 --> 03:10:00,920
36?

5775
03:10:02,360 --> 03:10:03,380
There is...

5776
03:10:03,380 --> 03:10:03,620
Nope.

5777
03:10:03,720 --> 03:10:04,360
It's 33.

5778
03:10:04,360 --> 03:10:05,680
38 is lettuce.

5779
03:10:05,780 --> 03:10:06,880
I can't find a tomato.

5780
03:10:07,480 --> 03:10:08,820
Tomato is 32.

5781
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:09,420
Sorry.

5782
03:10:09,500 --> 03:10:09,860
32.

5783
03:10:09,960 --> 03:10:11,640
32 and 36.

5784
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:11,720
32 and 36.

5785
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:11,820
38.

5786
03:10:11,860 --> 03:10:13,600
Um, does it matter where I put it?

5787
03:10:13,920 --> 03:10:14,920
Does not matter.

5788
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:15,340
Okay.

5789
03:10:15,360 --> 03:10:16,600
As long as pals can reach it.

5790
03:10:16,680 --> 03:10:17,160
It doesn't matter.

5791
03:10:17,460 --> 03:10:17,860
Tomato...

5792
03:10:17,860 --> 03:10:18,820
Uh, we don't have...

5793
03:10:18,820 --> 03:10:20,320
Can you pass me the tomato and lettuce seeds?

5794
03:10:20,480 --> 03:10:20,620
Yeah.

5795
03:10:21,180 --> 03:10:22,320
I don't have lettuce seeds.

5796
03:10:22,940 --> 03:10:23,340
Okay.

5797
03:10:23,400 --> 03:10:25,500
I can buy lettuce seeds later.

5798
03:10:25,680 --> 03:10:27,260
Can you give me a tomato and I'll just...

5799
03:10:27,260 --> 03:10:27,540
Yep.

5800
03:10:27,620 --> 03:10:28,300
There's a tomato.

5801
03:10:28,440 --> 03:10:30,180
We can get the burger done first then.

5802
03:10:30,360 --> 03:10:31,380
Uh, alright.

5803
03:10:31,420 --> 03:10:33,680
For the tomato...

5804
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:40,080
For the mozzarella meat, we need two tomatoes, flour, milk, and we need to kill a mazarinna.

5805
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:42,040
Um, I can kill a mazarinna.

5806
03:10:42,100 --> 03:10:44,360
I'm putting the tomato plantation at the bottom.

5807
03:10:44,360 --> 03:10:44,720
No, you can...

5808
03:10:44,720 --> 03:10:45,600
You should focus on other stuff.

5809
03:10:45,620 --> 03:10:46,480
I can go kill a mazarinna.

5810
03:10:46,720 --> 03:10:47,080
Yeah.

5811
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:49,100
I put the tomato plantation at the bottom.

5812
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:49,920
There was no more space.

5813
03:10:50,040 --> 03:10:50,320
Okay.

5814
03:10:50,460 --> 03:10:51,800
And then I'll go get the...

5815
03:10:51,800 --> 03:10:52,180
Sounds good.

5816
03:10:52,480 --> 03:10:52,920
Lettuce.

5817
03:10:53,740 --> 03:10:54,360
I'll go...

5818
03:10:54,360 --> 03:10:55,160
I'll go manual it.

5819
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:58,100
Do you have a general idea of how much coal you need?

5820
03:10:58,560 --> 03:10:59,880
I'll just grab everything.

5821
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:02,520
Yeah, just grab whatever you can.

5822
03:11:03,080 --> 03:11:04,020
Uh, wait.

5823
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:05,660
Did we make the production belt too?

5824
03:11:06,120 --> 03:11:06,760
Not yet.

5825
03:11:07,060 --> 03:11:07,500
Okay.

5826
03:11:07,640 --> 03:11:09,080
I need more high grade.

5827
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:09,960
Uh...

5828
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:10,700
Do you need more...

5829
03:11:10,700 --> 03:11:12,180
Here, I dropped the tomato seeds behind me.

5830
03:11:12,300 --> 03:11:12,620
Thank you.

5831
03:11:13,580 --> 03:11:14,260
Alright, I'll grab them.

5832
03:11:14,300 --> 03:11:15,960
I'm trying to go kill the bosses while I have time.

5833
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:16,260
Yeah, yeah.

5834
03:11:16,460 --> 03:11:16,640
Okay.

5835
03:11:16,840 --> 03:11:17,500
Do the bosses.

5836
03:11:17,620 --> 03:11:18,060
Sure, 4.

5837
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:18,500
Yeah.

5838
03:11:18,700 --> 03:11:19,480
I'm gonna...

5839
03:11:19,480 --> 03:11:21,300
I'll take care of the food.

5840
03:11:21,400 --> 03:11:22,460
I just need the lettuce plantation.

5841
03:11:22,580 --> 03:11:22,880
That's all.

5842
03:11:24,140 --> 03:11:24,460
Um...

5843
03:11:25,160 --> 03:11:27,040
I can buy the lettuce plantations, right?

5844
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:27,840
Yeah.

5845
03:11:27,880 --> 03:11:30,160
You can buy lettuce seeds, I think, from the same vendor.

5846
03:11:30,760 --> 03:11:31,080
Uh...

5847
03:11:31,080 --> 03:11:31,800
Just like this...

5848
03:11:31,800 --> 03:11:33,340
It doesn't matter which town, right?

5849
03:11:34,340 --> 03:11:34,660
No.

5850
03:11:34,800 --> 03:11:35,560
Well, hold on.

5851
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:36,100
Let me take a look.

5852
03:11:36,160 --> 03:11:36,880
I put it in the notes.

5853
03:11:37,140 --> 03:11:37,940
Uh, lettuce.

5854
03:11:38,200 --> 03:11:38,520
Lettuce.

5855
03:11:39,700 --> 03:11:40,020
Uh...

5856
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:40,520
Okay.

5857
03:11:40,540 --> 03:11:42,840
The wandering merchant in Dune Shelter.

5858
03:11:43,040 --> 03:11:44,000
It's the guy...

5859
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:45,120
It's like the desert one.

5860
03:11:45,420 --> 03:11:46,740
I might be fucked here.

5861
03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:47,760
I found it.

5862
03:11:47,840 --> 03:11:48,300
Oh, boy.

5863
03:11:48,460 --> 03:11:48,900
Just run.

5864
03:11:49,020 --> 03:11:50,000
Just run.

5865
03:11:50,180 --> 03:11:50,600
You can live.

5866
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:52,200
I'm cucumbered.

5867
03:11:52,300 --> 03:11:53,500
Wait, I don't have money.

5868
03:11:54,260 --> 03:11:55,500
No one gave me money.

5869
03:11:55,500 --> 03:11:56,460
Let me give you money.

5870
03:11:56,560 --> 03:11:57,300
Do you need money?

5871
03:11:57,520 --> 03:11:57,960
Yeah.

5872
03:11:58,020 --> 03:11:59,900
No one gave me money for this.

5873
03:12:00,360 --> 03:12:00,800
Goodbye.

5874
03:12:01,880 --> 03:12:02,600
Okay, here.

5875
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:03,040
I'm dropping.

5876
03:12:03,080 --> 03:12:04,060
I'll drop my money.

5877
03:12:06,360 --> 03:12:07,780
Okay, I have 400...

5878
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:09,460
Holy shit.

5879
03:12:09,500 --> 03:12:09,860
Okay.

5880
03:12:09,860 --> 03:12:10,060
You know what?

5881
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:10,800
You're so slow.

5882
03:12:11,740 --> 03:12:12,100
You're so slow.

5883
03:12:13,120 --> 03:12:14,080
Okay, I'm going to buy this.

5884
03:12:14,080 --> 03:12:14,660
Make sure you get three.

5885
03:12:14,780 --> 03:12:15,320
Three minimum.

5886
03:12:15,500 --> 03:12:15,820
Okay.

5887
03:12:16,120 --> 03:12:16,380
All right.

5888
03:12:16,380 --> 03:12:17,000
We'll near this bitch.

5889
03:12:19,200 --> 03:12:19,920
All right.

5890
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:20,980
I'm gonna butcher...

5891
03:12:20,980 --> 03:12:21,240
Wait.

5892
03:12:21,300 --> 03:12:22,100
I need to make a machete.

5893
03:12:22,540 --> 03:12:24,140
Cause I see a rush roe over there.

5894
03:12:24,200 --> 03:12:24,660
So I'll just...

5895
03:12:24,660 --> 03:12:25,780
I'll go get that meat right now.

5896
03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:27,320
Get that meat?

5897
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:29,220
Wait a...

5898
03:12:29,220 --> 03:12:29,900
Is he gone?

5899
03:12:30,420 --> 03:12:30,780
Nope.

5900
03:12:32,920 --> 03:12:33,280
Um...

5901
03:12:33,880 --> 03:12:34,240
Machete.

5902
03:12:34,520 --> 03:12:34,820
Nope.

5903
03:12:35,280 --> 03:12:35,640
Nope.

5904
03:12:35,780 --> 03:12:36,380
You okay?

5905
03:12:37,420 --> 03:12:37,780
Nope.

5906
03:12:38,080 --> 03:12:39,360
Oh, I don't think she's okay.

5907
03:12:39,700 --> 03:12:40,060
Hey.

5908
03:12:40,060 --> 03:12:41,460
She sounds alright.

5909
03:12:41,720 --> 03:12:46,140
I was like maybe that disappeared if I teleport back and forth but um...

5910
03:12:47,200 --> 03:12:47,720
Yeah.

5911
03:12:48,980 --> 03:12:49,620
We're killed.

5912
03:12:50,120 --> 03:12:51,920
How many wandering merchants are there?

5913
03:12:53,580 --> 03:12:54,760
Okay I got some food.

5914
03:12:54,760 --> 03:12:55,820
I earned some stock.

5915
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:56,520
Lettuce!

5916
03:12:56,520 --> 03:12:59,860
We're gonna go- wait do they have to be alive to use the meat cleaver?

5917
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:01,820
Or is it a dead situation?

5918
03:13:02,360 --> 03:13:02,400
Yes.

5919
03:13:02,400 --> 03:13:02,720
Alive.

5920
03:13:03,160 --> 03:13:03,680
Okay.

5921
03:13:03,900 --> 03:13:05,460
That's why it's inhumane.

5922
03:13:06,560 --> 03:13:07,080
Gotcha.

5923
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:08,360
Gotcha.

5924
03:13:09,840 --> 03:13:11,940
Cause when they're dead it doesn't taste as good.

5925
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:14,720
Chat it's important- chat you need to watch this cause it's important to remember where your food comes from.

5926
03:13:14,840 --> 03:13:15,400
I'd be very thankful.

5927
03:13:17,480 --> 03:13:20,020
Alright I got the- I'm gonna plant the lettuce stuff then.

5928
03:13:21,660 --> 03:13:22,600
Ummm... three right?

5929
03:13:22,700 --> 03:13:23,080
I got three.

5930
03:13:26,100 --> 03:13:26,460
Noooo!

5931
03:13:26,900 --> 03:13:27,720
Oh you stinker.

5932
03:13:27,760 --> 03:13:29,280
Eventually they'll despawn right?

5933
03:13:29,400 --> 03:13:29,520
That's okay.

5934
03:13:29,520 --> 03:13:29,780
I got the farm.

5935
03:13:29,780 --> 03:13:30,680
I can just get berries.

5936
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:34,200
I actually- I rode our whole base.

5937
03:13:35,880 --> 03:13:36,240
Ummm...

5938
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:37,680
Lettuce!

5939
03:13:40,040 --> 03:13:40,440
Ummm...

5940
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:44,740
Oh my god there's like- we have like barely any space to fucking put this now.

5941
03:13:45,080 --> 03:13:46,300
I can get rid of the breeding.

5942
03:13:46,500 --> 03:13:47,340
I can get rid of the breeding.

5943
03:13:47,420 --> 03:13:48,080
We're not bringing it anywhere.

5944
03:13:48,080 --> 03:13:48,080
Okay.

5945
03:13:48,080 --> 03:13:49,200
Yeah can you get rid of it?

5946
03:13:49,240 --> 03:13:49,540
Yeah.

5947
03:13:49,540 --> 03:13:50,380
And then I can plant this.

5948
03:13:52,060 --> 03:13:52,860
Uh... disassemble.

5949
03:13:53,560 --> 03:13:54,180
Nice alright.

5950
03:13:54,260 --> 03:13:54,460
Okay.

5951
03:13:54,600 --> 03:13:55,000
Disassembled.

5952
03:13:55,940 --> 03:13:56,340
Alright.

5953
03:13:56,980 --> 03:13:57,560
There you go.

5954
03:13:58,300 --> 03:13:58,700
Thanks!

5955
03:13:58,860 --> 03:13:59,320
I'll build it.

5956
03:13:59,360 --> 03:14:00,660
Okay now I can help you build.

5957
03:14:00,940 --> 03:14:04,840
Alright I'm gonna go fly to fucking sanctuary for real now.

5958
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:05,260
Thank you!

5959
03:14:05,560 --> 03:14:06,040
I'll cook!

5960
03:14:06,240 --> 03:14:07,000
For real, for real!

5961
03:14:07,080 --> 03:14:07,800
For real, for real!

5962
03:14:07,840 --> 03:14:08,140
I got you!

5963
03:14:08,420 --> 03:14:10,860
We finished the breeding, now we just gotta do the cooking.

5964
03:14:11,460 --> 03:14:13,140
And then base will be done.

5965
03:14:13,640 --> 03:14:15,600
And then surefire's gotta speedrun catching the bosses.

5966
03:14:16,440 --> 03:14:16,840
Yep.

5967
03:14:17,040 --> 03:14:17,660
I'm working on it.

5968
03:14:17,660 --> 03:14:18,980
Yeah, you guys should focus on bosses.

5969
03:14:19,360 --> 03:14:21,040
Yeah, I already got all the mediums.

5970
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:23,300
I mean, I'm missing one more medium, but I can catch that later.

5971
03:14:23,440 --> 03:14:27,800
I'm just gonna work on getting the sanctuaries first, because it's not that difficult.

5972
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:32,140
Let's see...

5973
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:36,200
It's right... here.

5974
03:14:40,150 --> 03:14:42,570
We have... we're almost at an hour mark.

5975
03:14:43,110 --> 03:14:45,690
Maybe at the 45 minute mark we start cutting.

5976
03:14:47,070 --> 03:14:49,390
I haven't had anything to drink in three hours.

5977
03:14:49,610 --> 03:14:51,310
Oh my god, go hydrate!

5978
03:14:51,630 --> 03:14:55,690
Palworld is like the worst game for my health, because I forget to drink, I forget to like...

5979
03:14:55,690 --> 03:14:57,330
I like shrimp, I just like...

5980
03:14:57,330 --> 03:14:58,430
Holy shit!

5981
03:14:58,790 --> 03:14:59,570
Holy shit!

5982
03:14:59,570 --> 03:15:00,970
Holy fuck, hydrate!

5983
03:15:01,050 --> 03:15:01,870
That's not healthy!

5984
03:15:02,450 --> 03:15:07,250
I like literally become like a Sword Art Online protagonist when I play Palworld.

5985
03:15:07,530 --> 03:15:07,990
Oh god.

5986
03:15:08,110 --> 03:15:10,450
Just like forget my... I have a body.

5987
03:15:10,650 --> 03:15:11,930
The worst thing to be.

5988
03:15:12,750 --> 03:15:13,550
Bro, honestly...

5989
03:15:13,550 --> 03:15:15,450
I'm like three T's in, that's gold.

5990
03:15:15,710 --> 03:15:17,810
Alright, hold on.

5991
03:15:17,870 --> 03:15:18,370
I'm gonna take...

5992
03:15:18,370 --> 03:15:19,630
I'm gonna take like a big one.

5993
03:15:19,970 --> 03:15:21,930
Just for my favorite pal, Lily.

5994
03:15:22,870 --> 03:15:23,270
Yippee!

5995
03:15:23,590 --> 03:15:24,530
Our best pal!

5996
03:15:25,330 --> 03:15:26,690
Alright, I killed one of the bosses.

5997
03:15:26,890 --> 03:15:27,290
Best pal!

5998
03:15:27,290 --> 03:15:27,750
Wait, you killed?

5999
03:15:27,910 --> 03:15:28,470
Not captured?

6000
03:15:28,990 --> 03:15:29,710
I captured.

6001
03:15:30,150 --> 03:15:31,350
Oh, clip clip clip!

6002
03:15:31,630 --> 03:15:32,250
Surefour captured!

6003
03:15:32,750 --> 03:15:33,750
Wait, which one did you capture?

6004
03:15:33,770 --> 03:15:34,170
I drank a lot of water.

6005
03:15:34,190 --> 03:15:35,590
I'm gonna have a pee pee problem, and...

6006
03:15:35,610 --> 03:15:36,410
like a second, bro.

6007
03:15:36,830 --> 03:15:38,850
You are... you are the pee pee.

6008
03:15:38,950 --> 03:15:39,330
Cybelex?

6009
03:15:40,390 --> 03:15:40,830
Okay.

6010
03:15:40,990 --> 03:15:42,610
How, how do you have pee pee problem?

6011
03:15:42,890 --> 03:15:43,850
Wait, Cybelex?

6012
03:15:43,890 --> 03:15:45,190
Oh my god, my throat feels so much better.

6013
03:15:45,250 --> 03:15:47,830
It felt so bad, and I was like, why do I feel terrible?

6014
03:15:48,270 --> 03:15:50,370
They're still here, no fucking way!

6015
03:15:51,330 --> 03:15:52,930
Why do I feel so bad?

6016
03:15:55,030 --> 03:15:56,390
Alright, pee pee mod.

6017
03:15:56,910 --> 03:15:59,690
Surefour caught a pal, Cybelex, clip clip clip.

6018
03:16:00,010 --> 03:16:01,070
Remember the clip clip clip.

6019
03:16:01,190 --> 03:16:01,270
Yeah, they already did it.

6020
03:16:02,170 --> 03:16:03,290
Just to be sure.

6021
03:16:04,210 --> 03:16:04,790
Hot dog.

6022
03:16:04,790 --> 03:16:05,410
What?

6023
03:16:05,570 --> 03:16:05,950
What?

6024
03:16:06,670 --> 03:16:07,990
Alright, just need that lettuce.

6025
03:16:09,990 --> 03:16:12,430
And then I gotta get that cow meat.

6026
03:16:15,150 --> 03:16:16,310
Where's the nearest cow?

6027
03:16:17,430 --> 03:16:20,610
It's where the vanworm... vanworm... where we caught the vanworm.

6028
03:16:21,410 --> 03:16:23,130
We're 10th place right now.

6029
03:16:24,870 --> 03:16:26,030
That's not...

6030
03:16:26,580 --> 03:16:27,250
Top 10!

6031
03:16:27,330 --> 03:16:27,670
Top 10!

6032
03:16:30,170 --> 03:16:34,290
I think the moment we take pictures of petting the cows, we will skyrocket.

6033
03:16:34,590 --> 03:16:36,590
Cause that's the one thing that we haven't really done.

6034
03:16:36,770 --> 03:16:37,670
We gotta make our little petting zoo.

6035
03:16:37,730 --> 03:16:40,290
We gotta put out all the humans too at the very end.

6036
03:16:40,930 --> 03:16:44,310
When we're ready to just say like, we don't care about materials anymore.

6037
03:16:44,490 --> 03:16:46,370
I think... no, at the last 10 minutes we can do that.

6038
03:16:46,790 --> 03:16:47,150
Yeah.

6039
03:16:47,950 --> 03:16:48,510
That's fine.

6040
03:16:49,510 --> 03:16:49,870
Alright.

6041
03:16:51,850 --> 03:16:53,870
Okay, do we require more coal?

6042
03:16:54,850 --> 03:16:55,530
Or do we...

6043
03:16:55,530 --> 03:16:56,590
Sure, do you need more coal?

6044
03:16:56,890 --> 03:16:57,650
What do you need?

6045
03:16:57,670 --> 03:16:58,110
I need more...

6046
03:16:58,970 --> 03:17:04,430
I feel like hypersphere materials is like the thing we need the most at that point.

6047
03:17:04,950 --> 03:17:05,430
Right?

6048
03:17:07,110 --> 03:17:10,690
Yeah, I have seven legendary spheres queued up.

6049
03:17:10,810 --> 03:17:11,470
Iron ore.

6050
03:17:11,810 --> 03:17:12,290
Lily.

6051
03:17:12,610 --> 03:17:13,090
Okay.

6052
03:17:13,490 --> 03:17:14,750
Iron ore, got it.

6053
03:17:14,850 --> 03:17:17,090
Let me just grab one Anubis.

6054
03:17:17,090 --> 03:17:18,430
And the palladium fragments.

6055
03:17:18,670 --> 03:17:19,750
Those are always gonna be two.

6056
03:17:20,070 --> 03:17:20,590
Yeah, yeah.

6057
03:17:20,630 --> 03:17:21,930
I need those two later as well.

6058
03:17:25,210 --> 03:17:26,870
Let me know whenever you're...

6059
03:17:26,870 --> 03:17:29,790
Whenever you're ready to do the black market, I can do it with you.

6060
03:17:30,470 --> 03:17:32,050
So I can aggro it together.

6061
03:17:32,390 --> 03:17:33,650
Dude, that's hype.

6062
03:17:33,890 --> 03:17:36,110
I'm excited to see this done like legit.

6063
03:17:37,310 --> 03:17:38,970
Wait, people do it... wait, what?

6064
03:17:39,190 --> 03:17:43,410
I didn't know you could do it any other way than like the exploit way.

6065
03:17:43,650 --> 03:17:44,050
What?

6066
03:17:44,450 --> 03:17:46,330
People do it... there's an exploit?

6067
03:17:47,150 --> 03:17:48,510
No, not in this game.

6068
03:17:48,550 --> 03:17:50,630
There's no glitches in this game at all, ever.

6069
03:17:50,730 --> 03:17:51,890
There's an exploit for the black market?

6070
03:17:52,010 --> 03:17:53,190
I have to catch it legit?

6071
03:17:53,430 --> 03:17:54,050
What do you mean?

6072
03:17:54,050 --> 03:17:54,150
Me?

6073
03:17:56,010 --> 03:17:57,150
What do you mean?

6074
03:17:59,650 --> 03:18:00,090
People don't do it legit?

6075
03:18:00,090 --> 03:18:04,910
Cause I guess normally you would use the... you would use the... the... the... fire.

6076
03:18:06,010 --> 03:18:07,230
Well, I didn't know that.

6077
03:18:07,390 --> 03:18:09,530
I fucking... fucking did it the hard way.

6078
03:18:12,750 --> 03:18:13,750
That's why you a pro.

6079
03:18:14,690 --> 03:18:15,550
Oh, come on.

6080
03:18:16,730 --> 03:18:19,010
I'm very slowly flying over there.

6081
03:18:19,030 --> 03:18:21,270
I'm just gonna... you know, I'm just gonna...

6082
03:18:24,050 --> 03:18:26,810
Alright, I'll go get... I'll go get a... a pal.

6083
03:18:28,390 --> 03:18:33,050
I'm gonna go catch one of the... or kill one of the... cows, I guess.

6084
03:18:33,230 --> 03:18:34,030
Last hour.

6085
03:18:35,010 --> 03:18:35,410
Stop.

6086
03:18:37,090 --> 03:18:37,490
Me.

6087
03:18:37,710 --> 03:18:38,550
At the clock.

6088
03:18:38,670 --> 03:18:39,070
Stop.

6089
03:18:40,290 --> 03:18:40,690
Stop.

6090
03:18:42,170 --> 03:18:44,970
I'm a sliding pal, but I'm three seconds later than light.

6091
03:18:45,010 --> 03:18:46,250
What if I pick up this berry though?

6092
03:18:46,430 --> 03:18:47,850
Alright, you get ready to clip.

6093
03:18:47,930 --> 03:18:48,510
Get ready to clip.

6094
03:18:48,570 --> 03:18:50,450
Here comes the last breed that we're doing.

6095
03:18:51,010 --> 03:18:52,170
Ozark was born.

6096
03:18:52,550 --> 03:18:53,010
Let's go!

6097
03:18:54,050 --> 03:18:54,330
Clip, clip!

6098
03:18:55,010 --> 03:18:55,650
Clip, clip, clip!

6099
03:18:55,970 --> 03:18:56,610
Clip, clip, clip!

6100
03:18:57,590 --> 03:18:59,090
Alright, I got Jormuntide.

6101
03:19:00,030 --> 03:19:00,390
Clip!

6102
03:19:00,390 --> 03:19:01,070
Sure, four, two!

6103
03:19:01,190 --> 03:19:01,730
Clip, clip, clip!

6104
03:19:04,210 --> 03:19:05,290
Oh my god, I'm still hungry.

6105
03:19:05,450 --> 03:19:06,590
Jormuntide, lord of the sea.

6106
03:19:07,630 --> 03:19:08,610
Lord of the sea.

6107
03:19:08,710 --> 03:19:08,910
Alright.

6108
03:19:09,150 --> 03:19:13,350
We got Jormuntide and the breeding Ozark, whatever his name is.

6109
03:19:15,430 --> 03:19:16,150
Okay, um...

6110
03:19:18,690 --> 03:19:19,050
Lettuce.

6111
03:19:19,050 --> 03:19:22,430
Lettuce and then I can make the hot dog and then I'll just make the... the cheeseburger.

6112
03:19:24,530 --> 03:19:26,510
I just need two mazarinameats.

6113
03:19:27,910 --> 03:19:29,830
Oh my god, I've been flying forever.

6114
03:19:30,830 --> 03:19:32,110
Where did he go?

6115
03:19:32,290 --> 03:19:32,550
Stop!

6116
03:19:33,210 --> 03:19:33,770
Okay.

6117
03:19:33,870 --> 03:19:34,870
Leaving your post!

6118
03:19:36,810 --> 03:19:37,370
Don't!

6119
03:19:37,430 --> 03:19:38,070
I just...

6120
03:19:38,070 --> 03:19:38,790
I'm flying out of here.

6121
03:19:38,790 --> 03:19:40,310
Legendary balls, I swear!

6122
03:19:42,370 --> 03:19:42,930
Please!

6123
03:19:42,970 --> 03:19:45,490
I'm gonna catch this guy just for now.

6124
03:19:45,570 --> 03:19:45,810
Alright.

6125
03:19:45,810 --> 03:19:47,410
Was it over here?

6126
03:19:47,410 --> 03:19:48,210
For the PAL register.

6127
03:19:54,050 --> 03:19:55,250
Was it the only one?

6128
03:19:55,310 --> 03:19:55,990
No, I don't think so.

6129
03:19:59,070 --> 03:20:00,610
Stop killing everything!

6130
03:20:06,880 --> 03:20:08,540
Back to mining.

6131
03:20:08,800 --> 03:20:09,360
Okay.

6132
03:20:09,720 --> 03:20:10,900
Mining away!

6133
03:20:12,080 --> 03:20:13,680
Over to the here.

6134
03:20:15,540 --> 03:20:17,480
Okay, directly... directly west.

6135
03:20:17,700 --> 03:20:18,060
Alright,

6136
03:20:21,450 --> 03:20:24,050
I'm gonna go kill myself a cow.

6137
03:20:25,170 --> 03:20:25,810
Nice.

6138
03:20:25,810 --> 03:20:26,690
Come on, Bessie!

6139
03:20:27,350 --> 03:20:28,350
Are you fucking...

6140
03:20:30,210 --> 03:20:30,570
No.

6141
03:20:30,710 --> 03:20:31,130
I'll get you in the way.

6142
03:20:34,590 --> 03:20:35,310
Come on!

6143
03:20:35,330 --> 03:20:35,970
Swimming cow!

6144
03:20:36,190 --> 03:20:37,310
That's gonna be some good meat.

6145
03:20:38,430 --> 03:20:39,150
Come on!

6146
03:20:40,430 --> 03:20:44,450
I should've been flying to the sanctuary but I wanted to catch this for a registered CAL!

6147
03:20:45,650 --> 03:20:47,090
Wait, what the fuck is wrong with that cow?

6148
03:20:47,830 --> 03:20:48,790
Can I get a different cow?

6149
03:20:48,870 --> 03:20:49,470
Oh, fuck off!

6150
03:20:49,570 --> 03:20:49,750
No!

6151
03:20:54,450 --> 03:20:55,170
Oh shit, cow.

6152
03:20:55,810 --> 03:20:57,790
Why are you so hard to fucking catch?

6153
03:20:59,110 --> 03:21:01,710
It's like the cow knows that I'm trying to kill him or something.

6154
03:21:03,290 --> 03:21:04,730
Maybe it's cause you shot him?

6155
03:21:05,610 --> 03:21:06,010
Nah!

6156
03:21:06,350 --> 03:21:07,410
That can't be it.

6157
03:21:09,050 --> 03:21:10,170
I don't know!

6158
03:21:11,210 --> 03:21:13,090
Maybe cause you shot a cow.

6159
03:21:13,590 --> 03:21:13,610
Nah!

6160
03:21:13,890 --> 03:21:14,910
I don't think so.

6161
03:21:16,510 --> 03:21:17,450
There's the sanctuary.

6162
03:21:18,890 --> 03:21:19,650
Come here, dude!

6163
03:21:20,050 --> 03:21:20,530
Yay!

6164
03:21:21,350 --> 03:21:22,150
Extra meat.

6165
03:21:23,770 --> 03:21:24,050
Alright.

6166
03:21:24,050 --> 03:21:24,770
Cool, we out.

6167
03:21:25,190 --> 03:21:25,590
Peace.

6168
03:21:29,300 --> 03:21:30,320
I'm almost there.

6169
03:21:30,380 --> 03:21:32,300
I feel like I've been flying for 50 years.

6170
03:21:35,260 --> 03:21:38,140
I don't know how to get to the volcano thing.

6171
03:21:38,320 --> 03:21:43,280
I feel like I can give you my armor and then you can get... you know where it is.

6172
03:21:43,520 --> 03:21:47,360
I've never been... somebody in the base building competition built a base there.

6173
03:21:47,440 --> 03:21:49,000
That's why I know it exists but...

6174
03:21:49,440 --> 03:21:53,380
Yeah, I don't know where that is so I don't know how to get that for us.

6175
03:21:53,420 --> 03:21:53,800
Talk about it.

6176
03:21:55,520 --> 03:21:55,960
What?

6177
03:21:56,060 --> 03:21:56,380
Cheer for?

6178
03:21:56,920 --> 03:21:57,880
What are we talking about?

6179
03:21:58,080 --> 03:21:59,100
The volcano.

6180
03:21:59,100 --> 03:21:59,660
The center of the volcano.

6181
03:21:59,900 --> 03:22:01,640
The volcano effigy.

6182
03:22:03,640 --> 03:22:09,200
I mean, I can find it on the map pretty easily but I don't know if I can traverse the locale to get there.

6183
03:22:09,420 --> 03:22:15,080
I mean, I can give you my heat pelt armor and then you can get... we'll do that later cause I'm trying to...

6184
03:22:15,080 --> 03:22:16,240
Alright, I'm making the food now.

6185
03:22:16,380 --> 03:22:16,680
Okay.

6186
03:22:18,300 --> 03:22:24,560
I can get to all the other team photos just not the... just not the volcano one.

6187
03:22:25,880 --> 03:22:27,240
Alright, be ready to clip.

6188
03:22:27,280 --> 03:22:28,460
We're making the cheeseburger.

6189
03:22:28,560 --> 03:22:30,400
Double checking, not a hamburger, definitely a cheeseburger.

6190
03:22:30,580 --> 03:22:32,060
Alright, cheeseburger, start production.

6191
03:22:32,940 --> 03:22:33,420
Yay!

6192
03:22:35,900 --> 03:22:36,720
Order up!

6193
03:22:37,080 --> 03:22:38,440
Cheeseburger is done!

6194
03:22:38,680 --> 03:22:39,340
Clip, clip, clip!

6195
03:22:39,700 --> 03:22:40,320
Clip, clip, clip!

6196
03:22:41,680 --> 03:22:43,360
We got the cheeseburger.

6197
03:22:43,960 --> 03:22:51,000
And for those who are not interested in cheeseburgers, we will also have some nice hot dogs for you.

6198
03:22:51,060 --> 03:22:53,540
Just one second, I gotta harvest the lettuce.

6199
03:22:54,480 --> 03:22:56,240
Why isn't the lettuce on the cheeseburger?

6200
03:22:56,340 --> 03:22:57,280
Why isn't it on the hot dog?

6201
03:22:59,980 --> 03:23:01,520
Different strokes for different folks.

6202
03:23:02,420 --> 03:23:04,720
Do any of you eat hot dogs with lettuce?

6203
03:23:05,400 --> 03:23:05,760
No.

6204
03:23:05,900 --> 03:23:06,800
I mean, there's some...

6205
03:23:06,800 --> 03:23:07,280
I put like onion and stuff on it.

6206
03:23:07,460 --> 03:23:09,060
Japanese hot dogs with lettuce.

6207
03:23:09,420 --> 03:23:09,880
Oh yeah.

6208
03:23:09,880 --> 03:23:10,540
I've had some of those.

6209
03:23:10,640 --> 03:23:11,000
Oh yeah.

6210
03:23:11,680 --> 03:23:12,740
So I'm at the...

6211
03:23:12,740 --> 03:23:14,000
Are you guys ready to come over?

6212
03:23:14,140 --> 03:23:15,220
I'm at the wildlife sanctuary.

6213
03:23:15,640 --> 03:23:17,240
Ah, one second, I'm just harvesting the lettuce.

6214
03:23:17,240 --> 03:23:17,520
I'll be on my way.

6215
03:23:17,580 --> 03:23:18,560
What about you, Sheriff War?

6216
03:23:19,580 --> 03:23:20,760
No, I gotta kill this boss.

6217
03:23:21,180 --> 03:23:23,040
Alright, we'll just wait until he's ready to kill that boss.

6218
03:23:23,200 --> 03:23:23,520
I'm just gonna wait for him to come over.

6219
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:24,280
I'm gonna put the base here first.

6220
03:23:25,680 --> 03:23:28,060
I have harvested a couple more ore.

6221
03:23:28,760 --> 03:23:30,020
I'll get a rock after.

6222
03:23:31,020 --> 03:23:34,260
Alright, base is done so you guys can come over whenever.

6223
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:35,480
Alright, one second.

6224
03:23:35,560 --> 03:23:37,640
It's gonna be about 30 minutes.

6225
03:23:37,780 --> 03:23:38,520
Yeah, no, that's fine.

6226
03:23:38,620 --> 03:23:40,340
Just wait until Sheriff War is done with his boss.

6227
03:23:40,460 --> 03:23:41,700
I'm just gonna...

6228
03:23:42,600 --> 03:23:43,000
What?

6229
03:23:44,060 --> 03:23:45,880
Alright, I'm gonna do...

6230
03:23:46,500 --> 03:23:46,900
Alright!

6231
03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:47,540
Let's see...

6232
03:23:50,700 --> 03:23:51,960
Okay, lettuce get...

6233
03:23:52,740 --> 03:23:53,500
How much meat?

6234
03:23:53,520 --> 03:23:55,680
How much more do we have for our base to get to level 20 anyway?

6235
03:23:56,060 --> 03:23:58,960
All we gotta do is build that line 2 and we're done.

6236
03:23:59,360 --> 03:24:00,660
Line 2 and then we...

6237
03:24:00,660 --> 03:24:01,760
Yeah, just need high quality pal...

6238
03:24:02,320 --> 03:24:02,780
Pal oil?

6239
03:24:03,060 --> 03:24:03,920
Fuel, yeah, oil.

6240
03:24:03,920 --> 03:24:05,860
You can get that from farming the...

6241
03:24:06,400 --> 03:24:06,860
What was it?

6242
03:24:06,900 --> 03:24:07,460
The penguin?

6243
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:07,900
Relaxosaurus.

6244
03:24:07,900 --> 03:24:08,800
No, that's the other one.

6245
03:24:09,080 --> 03:24:09,560
Relaxosaurus.

6246
03:24:09,700 --> 03:24:12,100
I can farm that later after...

6247
03:24:12,100 --> 03:24:12,860
Okay.

6248
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:16,160
We're making the hot dog now.

6249
03:24:16,680 --> 03:24:18,460
The legendary pal...

6250
03:24:18,460 --> 03:24:19,160
Cone up.

6251
03:24:19,160 --> 03:24:19,720
...spheres are done.

6252
03:24:20,800 --> 03:24:21,440
Legendary what?

6253
03:24:21,720 --> 03:24:22,180
Legendary...

6254
03:24:22,180 --> 03:24:22,640
Legendary what?

6255
03:24:23,520 --> 03:24:23,920
What is spheres?

6256
03:24:24,320 --> 03:24:25,060
Clip, clip, clip!

6257
03:24:25,160 --> 03:24:25,200
Clip!

6258
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:25,320
One on your hotdog is done!

6259
03:24:25,320 --> 03:24:26,200
One sure hotdog is done!

6260
03:24:26,880 --> 03:24:27,500
Hotdog's done!

6261
03:24:27,940 --> 03:24:28,420
Cooking is done!

6262
03:24:28,420 --> 03:24:30,980
Cooking done!solel Uh... Beep, beep, mon!

6263
03:24:31,940 --> 03:24:32,340
Hide..

6264
03:24:32,340 --> 03:24:35,060
Hide sheet, don't need it, well, fourteen.

6265
03:24:35,740 --> 03:24:36,820
Hide, don't need it.

6266
03:24:37,360 --> 03:24:38,380
Fifteen hides, don't need it.

6267
03:24:38,380 --> 03:24:39,400
Let's see what I need to do.

6268
03:24:41,240 --> 03:24:41,640
Hide this!

6269
03:24:41,640 --> 03:24:42,580
I don't need it.

6270
03:24:44,920 --> 03:24:46,600
Uh... Hide, I don't need that either.

6271
03:24:47,300 --> 03:24:48,800
Yep, all we need is the...

6272
03:24:48,800 --> 03:24:49,200
Paline.

6273
03:24:52,260 --> 03:24:52,660
Aberура?

6274
03:24:53,100 --> 03:24:53,500
Do we...

6275
03:24:53,500 --> 03:24:54,360
I can make that.

6276
03:24:54,420 --> 03:24:57,200
I'm gonna buy- how much pal oil do you need, Surefour?

6277
03:24:57,360 --> 03:24:57,740
Do you know?

6278
03:24:58,480 --> 03:24:59,040
High quality.

6279
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:00,700
How much?

6280
03:25:01,260 --> 03:25:01,900
An amount.

6281
03:25:02,480 --> 03:25:04,120
How much is an amount?

6282
03:25:04,680 --> 03:25:05,820
Fuck a final, man!

6283
03:25:06,320 --> 03:25:06,760
What?

6284
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:08,120
You're the one making it!

6285
03:25:09,040 --> 03:25:11,440
Bro, there's so many things I have to do right now.

6286
03:25:11,480 --> 03:25:13,460
You think I'm gonna remember all the fucking exact numbers?

6287
03:25:13,840 --> 03:25:14,940
I thought you were perfect!

6288
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:15,580
What happened?

6289
03:25:16,280 --> 03:25:18,480
Yeah, I'm perfect at the things I wanna be perfect at.

6290
03:25:18,960 --> 03:25:20,380
Then that's not being perfect!

6291
03:25:21,080 --> 03:25:22,580
I'm perfect in my world.

6292
03:25:23,500 --> 03:25:26,280
Okay, uh, other ways to farm high quality pal oil.

6293
03:25:26,580 --> 03:25:28,300
I'm buying some right now.

6294
03:25:28,420 --> 03:25:29,500
The Wallipops.

6295
03:25:29,620 --> 03:25:31,580
Wallipops drop as well.

6296
03:25:32,180 --> 03:25:34,180
Uh, da muds drop them.

6297
03:25:35,200 --> 03:25:36,260
Digtoys drop them.

6298
03:25:36,460 --> 03:25:39,840
So I think actually the Wallipops is probably the fastest and easiest way.

6299
03:25:40,000 --> 03:25:40,900
Alright, I got menacing.

6300
03:25:42,240 --> 03:25:42,720
Menacing?

6301
03:25:42,840 --> 03:25:43,280
Clip, clip, clip!

6302
03:25:43,420 --> 03:25:44,040
We got menacing!

6303
03:25:44,520 --> 03:25:45,060
Let's go!

6304
03:25:45,920 --> 03:25:46,400
Mod!

6305
03:25:46,580 --> 03:25:47,040
PP mod!

6306
03:25:47,120 --> 03:25:47,760
We got menacing!

6307
03:25:48,560 --> 03:25:49,860
Make sure you clip it!

6308
03:25:52,340 --> 03:25:52,820
Okay.

6309
03:25:53,500 --> 03:25:53,800
Alright.

6310
03:25:54,860 --> 03:25:55,740
Let's see...

6311
03:25:55,740 --> 03:25:57,020
I'm going to...

6312
03:25:57,020 --> 03:25:58,340
I dropped some...

6313
03:25:58,340 --> 03:25:59,420
I got five.

6314
03:25:59,660 --> 03:26:00,260
I just got five.

6315
03:26:00,500 --> 03:26:03,580
So I'm not sure if that's enough.

6316
03:26:04,660 --> 03:26:07,100
I don't think so, but like I just put five in there just in case.

6317
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:10,120
Palmer takes two high quality each.

6318
03:26:10,120 --> 03:26:10,600
Two high quality.

6319
03:26:10,940 --> 03:26:12,700
Okay, so I put five in there.

6320
03:26:13,140 --> 03:26:14,740
Um, oh shit my team's hungry.

6321
03:26:14,900 --> 03:26:15,080
Alright.

6322
03:26:15,440 --> 03:26:18,380
Just go to the pal deck, look for relaxasaurus.

6323
03:26:18,440 --> 03:26:18,800
Yeah, yeah.

6324
03:26:18,800 --> 03:26:19,240
I will.

6325
03:26:19,280 --> 03:26:20,100
And kill those guys.

6326
03:26:20,100 --> 03:26:21,820
Um, do we have...

6327
03:26:21,820 --> 03:26:23,480
Are we good to go to take a photo now?

6328
03:26:24,320 --> 03:26:26,980
After I travel to a fast travel spot.

6329
03:26:27,100 --> 03:26:28,280
Okay, we'll just wait for sure.

6330
03:26:28,300 --> 03:26:29,580
I'll kill dummits in the meantime.

6331
03:26:29,940 --> 03:26:32,580
I'm gonna go kill some walley pops in the meantime.

6332
03:26:32,940 --> 03:26:33,600
Well, sure.

6333
03:26:33,680 --> 03:26:35,260
We're gonna be able to be done soon.

6334
03:26:35,860 --> 03:26:36,800
Coming back soon.

6335
03:26:36,920 --> 03:26:38,240
So we should just head over now.

6336
03:26:38,960 --> 03:26:39,360
Okay.

6337
03:26:39,500 --> 03:26:41,420
Since he's just flying over to fast travel.

6338
03:26:41,520 --> 03:26:42,340
It's to the far left.

6339
03:26:48,650 --> 03:26:49,730
Is it hot or cold?

6340
03:26:50,070 --> 03:26:51,270
Um, I don't...

6341
03:26:51,270 --> 03:26:52,410
I can't tell.

6342
03:26:52,650 --> 03:26:53,930
My thing isn't showing.

6343
03:26:53,970 --> 03:26:55,170
Oh, there it's medium.

6344
03:26:55,390 --> 03:26:57,030
Actually, I have heat pelt on.

6345
03:26:57,030 --> 03:26:57,610
So I don't know.

6346
03:26:57,750 --> 03:26:58,750
It could be cold.

6347
03:26:58,850 --> 03:26:59,930
Oh, let me grab my chillit.

6348
03:26:59,990 --> 03:27:02,490
So I'm not super fucking slow this time.

6349
03:27:02,610 --> 03:27:03,490
I have heat pelt on.

6350
03:27:03,810 --> 03:27:04,750
It's just a photo.

6351
03:27:04,870 --> 03:27:05,470
It's not a dungeon.

6352
03:27:05,730 --> 03:27:06,270
Oh, JK.

6353
03:27:07,550 --> 03:27:07,990
Okay.

6354
03:27:13,220 --> 03:27:14,520
All right, I wait.

6355
03:27:15,180 --> 03:27:15,800
I'm here.

6356
03:27:16,020 --> 03:27:18,340
All right, we're just missing Lily and Surefour.

6357
03:27:19,780 --> 03:27:20,360
He's still...

6358
03:27:20,360 --> 03:27:23,220
He's still trying to find the fast point.

6359
03:27:24,320 --> 03:27:25,280
I know where it is.

6360
03:27:25,500 --> 03:27:26,580
I just have to get there.

6361
03:27:27,280 --> 03:27:28,760
He's coming over.

6362
03:27:28,980 --> 03:27:29,420
I'll be on my way then.

6363
03:27:30,240 --> 03:27:30,680
I'm coming.

6364
03:27:30,680 --> 03:27:32,060
I got six oil in the meantime.

6365
03:27:32,580 --> 03:27:33,800
How much oil do we need?

6366
03:27:35,320 --> 03:27:35,720
Suzaku?

6367
03:27:35,800 --> 03:27:36,600
Fucking one of them.

6368
03:27:37,500 --> 03:27:38,060
Oh, yeah.

6369
03:27:38,220 --> 03:27:39,040
Yeah, he is.

6370
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:41,480
Might as well just kill this guy real quick then.

6371
03:27:41,620 --> 03:27:42,120
What the fuck?

6372
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:43,240
What the fuck?

6373
03:27:45,020 --> 03:27:45,800
We're waiting for you.

6374
03:27:45,800 --> 03:27:47,200
He's on the way to the fast travel point.

6375
03:27:47,360 --> 03:27:48,620
What the fuck do you want from me, man?

6376
03:27:48,900 --> 03:27:51,660
All right, then we can just do other stuff while he does that.

6377
03:27:52,060 --> 03:27:52,880
All right, let's do that.

6378
03:27:53,840 --> 03:27:55,760
I'm literally just about to catch him.

6379
03:27:57,400 --> 03:27:58,540
Did you catch him?

6380
03:27:59,180 --> 03:28:00,660
He's in the ball right now.

6381
03:28:00,660 --> 03:28:01,520
All right, okay.

6382
03:28:01,560 --> 03:28:02,700
I'm down back here.

6383
03:28:02,820 --> 03:28:03,660
I didn't even believe.

6384
03:28:03,840 --> 03:28:04,220
I can fly back.

6385
03:28:11,380 --> 03:28:12,280
I caught him.

6386
03:28:12,420 --> 03:28:13,640
All right, clip, clip, clip.

6387
03:28:14,280 --> 03:28:15,640
We got Suzaku.

6388
03:28:15,900 --> 03:28:18,520
Oh, you know I got to catch this Lovander though.

6389
03:28:18,980 --> 03:28:19,380
What?

6390
03:28:21,060 --> 03:28:21,800
Suzaku caught.

6391
03:28:22,060 --> 03:28:22,840
Clip, clip, clip.

6392
03:28:22,940 --> 03:28:23,540
Pee pee bun.

6393
03:28:24,760 --> 03:28:26,740
All right, so Lily and I are here.

6394
03:28:27,380 --> 03:28:28,500
Lily and Pee Pee.

6395
03:28:28,500 --> 03:28:29,500
Lily and I are here.

6396
03:28:29,800 --> 03:28:30,200
Hello.

6397
03:28:30,500 --> 03:28:30,900
Hello.

6398
03:28:31,020 --> 03:28:31,440
I am here.

6399
03:28:31,860 --> 03:28:32,460
We're here.

6400
03:28:32,520 --> 03:28:32,860
I'm sorry.

6401
03:28:32,960 --> 03:28:33,800
I'm just trying to stay away.

6402
03:28:33,800 --> 03:28:34,400
I'm yellow.

6403
03:28:36,140 --> 03:28:37,540
I'm so fucking late.

6404
03:28:38,300 --> 03:28:39,680
We're almost there.

6405
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:40,480
One hour left.

6406
03:28:40,580 --> 03:28:41,100
We're almost there.

6407
03:28:41,160 --> 03:28:41,640
We're almost there.

6408
03:28:43,800 --> 03:28:46,200
You signed up for this war soldier.

6409
03:28:46,340 --> 03:28:47,140
You have to finish it.

6410
03:28:47,160 --> 03:28:48,300
You got to finish it.

6411
03:28:48,820 --> 03:28:49,880
Oh, I'm working.

6412
03:28:50,160 --> 03:28:51,340
I'm mining.

6413
03:28:52,260 --> 03:28:52,780
Mining.

6414
03:28:53,220 --> 03:28:53,580
Mining.

6415
03:28:53,820 --> 03:28:54,340
Mining.

6416
03:28:54,680 --> 03:28:55,200
Mining.

6417
03:28:55,660 --> 03:28:57,080
She's trying her best.

6418
03:28:57,160 --> 03:28:57,920
She's mining.

6419
03:28:58,800 --> 03:28:59,700
I'm mining.

6420
03:29:00,160 --> 03:29:01,060
She's mining.

6421
03:29:01,060 --> 03:29:02,120
Now I hit the button again.

6422
03:29:02,280 --> 03:29:03,180
All right, let me know what you got.

6423
03:29:03,920 --> 03:29:04,480
I'm going to go.

6424
03:29:04,480 --> 03:29:04,740
Eight place.

6425
03:29:04,920 --> 03:29:05,960
We're in eighth place right now.

6426
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:06,860
So cute.

6427
03:29:07,040 --> 03:29:08,280
We're just waiting for you.

6428
03:29:08,420 --> 03:29:08,780
Let's go.

6429
03:29:09,960 --> 03:29:13,360
I'm slowly watching him flying to the fast travel.

6430
03:29:14,800 --> 03:29:15,660
He's almost there.

6431
03:29:16,180 --> 03:29:17,240
Almost there.

6432
03:29:18,060 --> 03:29:20,180
Travel across the fucking desert.

6433
03:29:20,500 --> 03:29:25,280
Also, I'm registered 40, by the way, in case that becomes relevant later.

6434
03:29:26,440 --> 03:29:28,200
Yeah, I only have 29.

6435
03:29:28,200 --> 03:29:28,640
If we want to clip that.

6436
03:29:28,700 --> 03:29:29,080
Okay.

6437
03:29:29,120 --> 03:29:29,660
We want to clip that.

6438
03:29:29,700 --> 03:29:30,220
Okay.

6439
03:29:31,060 --> 03:29:32,500
I'm still catching a lot.

6440
03:29:32,540 --> 03:29:33,540
So I'm good to go.

6441
03:29:33,540 --> 03:29:35,700
I have 50.

6442
03:29:35,840 --> 03:29:37,020
So that's like 60 points.

6443
03:29:37,060 --> 03:29:37,340
Yeah.

6444
03:29:37,340 --> 03:29:40,700
Because I think it's like there's like a big leap between 30 and 40.

6445
03:29:40,740 --> 03:29:42,840
It was like 20 points versus 50 points.

6446
03:29:43,100 --> 03:29:43,540
All right.

6447
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:45,460
Yeah.

6448
03:29:45,640 --> 03:29:46,260
All right.

6449
03:29:46,280 --> 03:29:46,700
Here we go.

6450
03:29:46,960 --> 03:29:47,220
Sure.

6451
03:29:47,220 --> 03:29:48,960
Four is almost there.

6452
03:29:49,040 --> 03:29:49,920
I'm literally watching.

6453
03:29:49,980 --> 03:29:50,180
All right.

6454
03:29:50,220 --> 03:29:50,500
Clip.

6455
03:29:50,500 --> 03:29:50,680
Clip.

6456
03:29:50,680 --> 03:29:50,980
Clip.

6457
03:29:50,980 --> 03:29:51,300
We're here.

6458
03:29:51,800 --> 03:29:52,220
Clip.

6459
03:29:52,220 --> 03:29:52,520
Clip.

6460
03:29:52,520 --> 03:29:52,840
Clip.

6461
03:29:52,980 --> 03:29:53,400
Clip.

6462
03:29:55,080 --> 03:29:55,500
Clip.

6463
03:29:55,820 --> 03:29:56,240
Clip.

6464
03:29:56,240 --> 03:29:56,400
Clip.

6465
03:29:56,540 --> 03:29:56,720
Clip.

6466
03:29:56,720 --> 03:29:56,920
Clip.

6467
03:29:56,920 --> 03:29:57,100
Clip.

6468
03:29:57,220 --> 03:29:57,560
Clip.

6469
03:29:58,760 --> 03:29:59,180
Clip.

6470
03:29:59,180 --> 03:29:59,540
Bye.

6471
03:30:00,900 --> 03:30:01,300
Bye!

6472
03:30:01,660 --> 03:30:03,200
I'm heading to the third one now.

6473
03:30:03,680 --> 03:30:08,680
I'm going to try to get some poly waps or whatever the fuck they're called and get some high quality power.

6474
03:30:08,680 --> 03:30:10,100
Where the fuck is the last.

6475
03:30:10,160 --> 03:30:12,380
Because once we do that, we'll be base level.

6476
03:30:12,540 --> 03:30:13,060
Oh, it's cold.

6477
03:30:13,320 --> 03:30:14,140
How much do we in total?

6478
03:30:14,280 --> 03:30:16,000
I just got six while waiting.

6479
03:30:19,020 --> 03:30:19,820
Good question.

6480
03:30:22,600 --> 03:30:23,860
Really good question, actually.

6481
03:30:25,100 --> 03:30:26,560
What are your jobs right now?

6482
03:30:26,840 --> 03:30:27,180
Shit.

6483
03:30:27,220 --> 03:30:28,180
Don't hit me.

6484
03:30:28,180 --> 03:30:29,160
I'm getting high quality quality.

6485
03:30:29,160 --> 03:30:32,420
I'm trying to get high quality Paloal and farm whatever people tell me to.

6486
03:30:32,580 --> 03:30:33,940
Okay, what about you, PP?

6487
03:30:34,060 --> 03:30:35,160
What's your job at the moment?

6488
03:30:35,340 --> 03:30:36,500
I'm flying back to base, hold on.

6489
03:30:37,300 --> 03:30:39,640
I'm trying to get high quality Paloal so we can finish the base.

6490
03:30:39,820 --> 03:30:41,520
Okay, so both of you are going to do that, alright?

6491
03:30:42,040 --> 03:30:46,040
Yeah, I'm killing Dammit and I think she's killing Woolly Pops for it.

6492
03:30:46,160 --> 03:30:49,760
Yeah, but they're not out right now because it's nighttime, so I'm going to come back for a sec.

6493
03:30:50,740 --> 03:30:54,020
I think Dammit still spawns at night, I'm not sure they care.

6494
03:30:54,020 --> 03:30:59,960
You can also go to the Anubis base where they've got the dig choices and the other one, they also drop it.

6495
03:31:02,780 --> 03:31:04,180
Oh, there, two Dammits.

6496
03:31:04,440 --> 03:31:08,540
Wait, if one of us beats the tower, does anybody else have to be there or we don't?

6497
03:31:08,640 --> 03:31:09,880
No, just one of us.

6498
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:11,220
Yeah, I already did two towers.

6499
03:31:11,540 --> 03:31:12,240
Alright, perfect.

6500
03:31:12,820 --> 03:31:13,940
Oh no, I'm hungry.

6501
03:31:14,500 --> 03:31:16,080
Alright, I'm going to go to the Anubis base.

6502
03:31:16,400 --> 03:31:17,440
Wait, do I have to catch the Mammoth?

6503
03:31:17,740 --> 03:31:17,840
Oh, Lily!

6504
03:31:18,300 --> 03:31:18,740
Hi Lily.

6505
03:31:18,860 --> 03:31:19,200
The Mammoth?

6506
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:19,900
Hi.

6507
03:31:20,700 --> 03:31:23,100
I already... I did... to my Dammit farm.

6508
03:31:23,100 --> 03:31:24,180
Oh shit, I'm freezing to death.

6509
03:31:24,200 --> 03:31:28,000
Yeah, I already did all the mediums, except for the Botan.

6510
03:31:30,220 --> 03:31:30,660
Botan?

6511
03:31:30,740 --> 03:31:31,700
Or the Botan, yeah.

6512
03:31:31,780 --> 03:31:32,520
Your Oshi.

6513
03:31:33,200 --> 03:31:34,060
Why am I cold?

6514
03:31:34,660 --> 03:31:35,840
Actually, my Oshi is Hosho Marine.

6515
03:31:35,840 --> 03:31:37,340
Why is the desert so cold at night?

6516
03:31:37,820 --> 03:31:38,660
What the fuck?

6517
03:31:38,860 --> 03:31:39,860
What happened to Botan?

6518
03:31:40,100 --> 03:31:41,380
He used Oshi in her too.

6519
03:31:41,380 --> 03:31:42,960
I discovered Hosho Marine.

6520
03:31:44,500 --> 03:31:46,360
Hosho Marine, this is...

6521
03:31:48,200 --> 03:31:48,640
Okay.

6522
03:31:48,700 --> 03:31:49,620
Wait, where are we?

6523
03:31:50,340 --> 03:31:51,860
Oh, it's all those... oh my...

6524
03:31:51,860 --> 03:31:53,620
Yeah, you did discover a Marine.

6525
03:31:53,740 --> 03:31:54,180
There she is.

6526
03:31:54,200 --> 03:31:54,900
Okay, I got six more.

6527
03:31:57,300 --> 03:31:58,720
Dang, she's so hot though.

6528
03:31:59,280 --> 03:32:00,320
She's so hot.

6529
03:32:00,580 --> 03:32:01,820
Why'd they make her look like that?

6530
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:03,920
I'm starving right now.

6531
03:32:03,940 --> 03:32:04,440
I might die before...

6532
03:32:04,440 --> 03:32:05,420
Don't make me act up.

6533
03:32:05,560 --> 03:32:06,840
I could do anything.

6534
03:32:09,840 --> 03:32:10,320
Shit.

6535
03:32:10,720 --> 03:32:12,540
Oh wait, there's a... waypoint here.

6536
03:32:12,700 --> 03:32:12,900
Okay.

6537
03:32:13,840 --> 03:32:15,300
Oh no, help!

6538
03:32:16,420 --> 03:32:18,100
Can someone revive me?

6539
03:32:18,340 --> 03:32:19,300
Lily, help.

6540
03:32:19,380 --> 03:32:20,180
I'm coming to you.

6541
03:32:20,180 --> 03:32:20,620
Absolutely.

6542
03:32:21,060 --> 03:32:25,640
I got... I was defeated by this hot lady and I couldn't... I couldn't help myself.

6543
03:32:25,760 --> 03:32:26,420
I'm so sorry.

6544
03:32:26,540 --> 03:32:27,280
Wait a minute.

6545
03:32:27,380 --> 03:32:28,600
I hear a shiny.

6546
03:32:28,740 --> 03:32:29,960
It'd be a shame if I...

6547
03:32:29,960 --> 03:32:31,100
Oh my god, shiny!

6548
03:32:31,100 --> 03:32:32,420
...catch her while I'm reviving you.

6549
03:32:32,500 --> 03:32:32,820
Oh no!

6550
03:32:33,180 --> 03:32:34,280
That's okay, it's better...

6551
03:32:34,280 --> 03:32:35,560
Oh my god, she's behind you!

6552
03:32:35,660 --> 03:32:36,720
She's behind you!

6553
03:32:37,120 --> 03:32:38,200
She's behind you!

6554
03:32:38,300 --> 03:32:38,580
Fuck!

6555
03:32:39,320 --> 03:32:39,920
Oh shit.

6556
03:32:39,920 --> 03:32:40,140
She's behind you.

6557
03:32:42,320 --> 03:32:43,840
Are you guys okay?

6558
03:32:43,960 --> 03:32:45,080
Oh my god, please stay in!

6559
03:32:45,320 --> 03:32:46,720
Are you guys all okay?

6560
03:32:46,960 --> 03:32:48,120
What's going on?

6561
03:32:48,380 --> 03:32:48,800
She's behind you.

6562
03:32:49,820 --> 03:32:50,260
Okay.

6563
03:32:51,160 --> 03:32:52,220
Okay, holy shit.

6564
03:32:52,380 --> 03:32:54,280
What the fuck is going on?

6565
03:32:55,140 --> 03:32:56,240
Oh, thank you.

6566
03:32:56,380 --> 03:32:56,900
Thank you.

6567
03:32:57,660 --> 03:32:58,500
Holy shit.

6568
03:32:58,740 --> 03:33:00,260
Oh, Andel's done its perfect timing.

6569
03:33:00,260 --> 03:33:00,960
Oh yeah, let's kill him.

6570
03:33:00,980 --> 03:33:01,240
Let's kill him.

6571
03:33:01,260 --> 03:33:01,480
Okay.

6572
03:33:01,900 --> 03:33:03,120
Okay, banworm.

6577
03:33:23,530 --> 03:33:24,590
I wanna keep one.

6578
03:33:24,590 --> 03:33:25,030
Yeah, I got it.

6579
03:33:25,030 --> 03:33:25,670
I wanna keep one.

6580
03:33:25,790 --> 03:33:26,050
Fuck you!

6581
03:33:26,170 --> 03:33:26,490
Oh, Clip!

03:33:26,690 --> 03:33:27,290
Clip, Clip, Clip!

6583
03:33:27,470 --> 03:33:29,610
He didn't wanna be kept, so he can die.

6584
03:33:29,730 --> 03:33:31,770

6585

Congrats!

6587
03:33:34,930 --> 03:33:35,510
Keep him up!

6588
03:33:35,530 --> 03:33:38,890
We really have not seen a lot of lucky pals.

6589
03:33:39,370 --> 03:33:40,350
Surefour, you did it!

6590
03:33:40,350 --> 03:33:41,310
You're finally lucky!

6591
03:33:41,870 --> 03:33:42,790
Oh my god.

6592
03:33:43,190 --> 03:33:44,130
So proud of you.

6593
03:33:45,690 --> 03:33:46,490
I wanna die.

6594
03:33:46,590 --> 03:33:47,390
Uh, alright.

6595
03:33:48,330 --> 03:33:50,990
Lily, can I have all the high quality pal oil you have right now?

6596
03:33:51,110 --> 03:33:52,070
I'll just take it back to base.

6597
03:33:52,070 --> 03:33:52,730
I have nine on me.

6598
03:33:52,930 --> 03:33:53,610
Alright, I'll take it.

6599
03:33:54,290 --> 03:33:55,510
Why do you wanna die?

6600
03:33:55,670 --> 03:33:56,690
You have so much to live for!

6601
03:33:56,890 --> 03:33:57,010
Here.

6602
03:33:57,650 --> 03:33:58,250
Where are you?

6603
03:33:58,430 --> 03:33:59,350
Just falling down.

6604
03:33:59,450 --> 03:33:59,990
Like what?

6605
03:34:00,290 --> 03:34:00,570
Oh!

6606
03:34:00,670 --> 03:34:01,750
Like marine!

6607
03:34:02,230 --> 03:34:03,170
Oh, thank you!

6608
03:34:03,430 --> 03:34:03,750
I got it.

6609
03:34:03,830 --> 03:34:04,470
On the fat picture!

6610
03:34:04,470 --> 03:34:05,590
She doesn't know me, little bro.

6611
03:34:07,290 --> 03:34:08,050
Thank you!

6612
03:34:08,450 --> 03:34:10,990
But if you live long enough, she'll eventually know you, right?

6613
03:34:12,370 --> 03:34:13,790
Anubis, why are you so fucking tall?

6614
03:34:14,350 --> 03:34:14,950
Oh shit.

6615
03:34:15,150 --> 03:34:15,410
I said, hail!

6616
03:34:15,550 --> 03:34:17,330
Oh no, I had a boss battle with him?

6617
03:34:17,430 --> 03:34:17,790
Uh oh.

6618
03:34:18,130 --> 03:34:18,770
Hey guys.

6619
03:34:18,870 --> 03:34:19,510
Well, I don't want that.

6620
03:34:19,510 --> 03:34:20,510
We're the fucking relaxesauruses, man.

6621
03:34:21,330 --> 03:34:21,730
Um...

6622
03:34:21,730 --> 03:34:28,970
We already got- We got a lot of pal- We might be- Uh, they've been doing- Peepee and Lily have been doing pal- pal- I'll come back.

6623
03:34:29,350 --> 03:34:29,850
Mm-hmm.

6624
03:34:30,030 --> 03:34:31,250
I'm grabbing some more.

6625
03:34:31,270 --> 03:34:31,630
I've got, uh...

6626
03:34:31,630 --> 03:34:32,350
I just got another damnit.

6627
03:34:32,690 --> 03:34:33,490
I've got twelve.

6628
03:34:33,810 --> 03:34:33,950
What?

6629
03:34:35,890 --> 03:34:36,810
Oh, what the fuck?

6630
03:34:36,850 --> 03:34:37,970
No, I don't wanna fight him.

6631
03:34:38,050 --> 03:34:39,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6632
03:34:40,290 --> 03:34:43,030
Guys, are you guys free for the third sanctuary?

6633
03:34:43,210 --> 03:34:43,950
Cause I'm already here.

6634
03:34:44,010 --> 03:34:45,310
Yeah, I'm getting the hell out of there.

6635
03:34:45,410 --> 03:34:46,130
Anubis was attacking.

6636
03:34:46,450 --> 03:34:46,770
Okay.

6637
03:34:47,030 --> 03:34:47,710
I'm gonna be there in...

6638
03:34:47,710 --> 03:34:48,990
I'll finish this damnit off and then I'm ready.

6639
03:34:49,250 --> 03:34:50,990
I'm gonna be there in, like, uh...

6640
03:34:50,990 --> 03:34:51,630
30 seconds.

6641
03:34:52,250 --> 03:34:54,850
Yeah, I'm just running back to base with, uh, the oil.

6642
03:34:58,660 --> 03:34:59,740
Alright, here we go.

6643
03:34:59,760 --> 03:35:00,560
How many, uh...

6644
03:35:00,560 --> 03:35:02,540
Sure, do you know how many we need?

6645
03:35:03,720 --> 03:35:04,480
Uh, pal oils?

6646
03:35:04,740 --> 03:35:05,440
He does not.

6647
03:35:06,340 --> 03:35:06,720
Okay.

6648
03:35:08,420 --> 03:35:09,400
Alright, I'll bring you what I got.

6649
03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:11,480
Alright, I got the...

6650
03:35:11,480 --> 03:35:13,220
Oh, I didn't get my pal oil for a kill.

6651
03:35:13,380 --> 03:35:13,660
Oh.

6652
03:35:14,920 --> 03:35:15,300
Where's...

6653
03:35:15,300 --> 03:35:17,200
Let me disassemble this base.

6654
03:35:19,740 --> 03:35:20,120
Okay.

6655
03:35:20,380 --> 03:35:21,100
Putting it in.

6656
03:35:21,240 --> 03:35:23,080
I got base ready for every- Oh, I got it.

6657
03:35:23,100 --> 03:35:23,120

6658
03:35:23,120 --> 03:35:23,180
On my way.

6659
03:35:23,180 --> 03:35:23,420
I'm joining you, buddy.

6660
03:35:23,680 --> 03:35:24,340
On my way.

6661
03:35:25,680 --> 03:35:27,080
Making my way down down.

6662
03:35:27,400 --> 03:35:28,720
More and faster.

6663
03:35:29,120 --> 03:35:31,280
Flying very slowly at medium speed.

6664
03:35:31,700 --> 03:35:32,160
I'm flying very slowly.

6665
03:35:32,160 --> 03:35:33,700
It's at the very top, right?

6666
03:35:33,980 --> 03:35:34,820
It's not really that quick, but I'm trying my best.

6667
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:36,920
Uh, the base is at the very, very top, right?

6668
03:35:37,300 --> 03:35:38,640
Bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap.

6669
03:35:39,340 --> 03:35:40,640
I'm ready whenever.

6670
03:35:40,900 --> 03:35:41,240
Okay, alright.

6671
03:35:41,240 --> 03:35:42,180
My pals are starving.

6672
03:35:42,420 --> 03:35:44,720
So I need you guys to get over here.

6673
03:35:45,060 --> 03:35:45,520
Okay, coming to you.

6674
03:35:45,520 --> 03:35:46,040
Oh, shit.

6675
03:35:46,040 --> 03:35:46,200
Oh shit!

6676
03:35:46,880 --> 03:35:49,200
It said top right, top left.

6677
03:35:49,980 --> 03:35:50,380
Oh!

6678
03:35:51,020 --> 03:35:51,880
Oh, I see you.

6679
03:35:51,980 --> 03:35:53,760
Okay, I'm flying away because...

6680
03:35:53,760 --> 03:35:55,100
Let me know when you guys are there.

6681
03:35:55,100 --> 03:35:55,740
There is a...

6682
03:35:55,740 --> 03:35:56,840
I just came into danger!

6683
03:35:56,960 --> 03:35:57,440
What's happening?

6684
03:35:57,440 --> 03:35:58,940
Okay, yeah, there's a pal that's very angry.

6685
03:35:59,400 --> 03:36:02,320
So I need you guys to all be there at the same time.

6686
03:36:03,620 --> 03:36:05,060
Okay, are you guys all heading there?

6687
03:36:05,420 --> 03:36:06,020
I'm here.

6688
03:36:06,260 --> 03:36:07,060
I'm on my way.

6689
03:36:07,500 --> 03:36:10,060
Okay, I'm just waiting for sure before they get there.

6690
03:36:12,360 --> 03:36:14,760
Mammoth dropped 10 ore to kill by the way.

6691
03:36:14,760 --> 03:36:16,220
Okay, that is my line however.

6692
03:36:16,580 --> 03:36:16,920
Alright, click up, click up!

6693
03:36:16,920 --> 03:36:18,960
Click up, click up, click up, click up!

6694
03:36:19,860 --> 03:36:20,460
Alright, bye.

6695
03:36:22,580 --> 03:36:24,060
That was a nice vacation, Bob.

6696
03:36:24,120 --> 03:36:25,020
Alright, we did it.

6697
03:36:25,040 --> 03:36:25,740
We got this sanctuary.

6698
03:36:27,620 --> 03:36:28,700
Okay, I'm fucking...

6699
03:36:28,700 --> 03:36:30,080
I'm going home so I can...

6700
03:36:30,980 --> 03:36:31,740
Okay, uh...

6701
03:36:31,740 --> 03:36:32,540
Clip, peep, peep, bye.

03:36:33,400 --> 03:36:36,280
Alright, so I can get the...

6703
03:36:36,280 --> 03:36:37,720
Alright, I'm taking a look at what we need.

6704
03:36:37,900 --> 03:36:39,560
We need some more palladium fragments.

6705
03:36:39,640 --> 03:36:40,720
We need more palladium fragments?

6706
03:36:40,920 --> 03:36:41,200
You need some?

6707
03:36:41,340 --> 03:36:42,440
Okay, yeah, he needs some now.

6708
03:36:44,760 --> 03:36:46,960
Can we get Ignis out of the ground though while I do that?

6709
03:36:47,060 --> 03:36:47,840
If they're at the box.

6710
03:36:48,560 --> 03:36:48,920
Ignis?

6711
03:36:49,900 --> 03:36:51,260
Yeah, he's like stuck in the ground.

6712
03:36:52,320 --> 03:36:52,920
Okay, yeah.

6713
03:36:53,560 --> 03:36:54,120
Yeah, I can.

6714
03:36:54,280 --> 03:36:55,000
He's back now.

6715
03:36:55,620 --> 03:36:56,340
Picking fragments.

6716
03:37:01,420 --> 03:37:01,780
Um...

6717
03:37:02,580 --> 03:37:04,260
Let's see... how much time do we have?

6718
03:37:04,520 --> 03:37:06,160
You guys wanna do the petting now?

6719
03:37:06,300 --> 03:37:06,720
For now?

6720
03:37:06,920 --> 03:37:08,160
Just to get that over with?

6721
03:37:08,280 --> 03:37:08,980
Cause we have like...

6722
03:37:08,980 --> 03:37:11,120
All of us come over here.

6723
03:37:12,060 --> 03:37:13,040
Let's do water first.

6724
03:37:13,080 --> 03:37:13,680
Let's just go in order.

6725
03:37:14,340 --> 03:37:15,120
And do water.

6726
03:37:15,860 --> 03:37:16,220
Alright.

6727
03:37:16,600 --> 03:37:18,280
Um, I'm bringing out the...

6728
03:37:18,280 --> 03:37:19,160
I'll do penking.

6729
03:37:19,480 --> 03:37:20,600
I'm bringing out the Flock.

6730
03:37:24,600 --> 03:37:26,220
Are they only water?

6731
03:37:26,400 --> 03:37:27,580
Yeah, only water type.

6732
03:37:28,360 --> 03:37:29,600
So they can't be mixed?

6733
03:37:30,260 --> 03:37:31,320
I think they can, right?

6734
03:37:31,440 --> 03:37:32,620
They should be able to.

6735
03:37:33,020 --> 03:37:33,740
There's... oh.

6736
03:37:34,200 --> 03:37:35,160
It doesn't say.

6737
03:37:35,200 --> 03:37:36,520
It says of the same element.

6738
03:37:36,560 --> 03:37:38,120
So I have the Flock out.

6739
03:37:39,760 --> 03:37:40,280
Ezra...

6740
03:37:40,280 --> 03:37:42,800
I don't think it matters if... I have a Broncherry Aqua.

6741
03:37:43,580 --> 03:37:44,580
Should we ask?

6742
03:37:44,660 --> 03:37:45,040
Admin.

6743
03:37:45,040 --> 03:37:45,540
Pause.

6744
03:37:47,060 --> 03:37:47,580

6745
03:37:48,940 --> 03:37:51,200
At admin... Can we...

6746
03:37:51,200 --> 03:37:53,060

6747
03:37:53,060 --> 03:37:55,080
Pals be mixed type?

6748
03:37:55,440 --> 03:37:57,480
For pal petting?

6749
03:37:58,180 --> 03:38:00,120
Like water and grass?

6750
03:38:01,400 --> 03:38:01,920
Okay.

6751
03:38:02,960 --> 03:38:04,040
You're gonna kill Anubis?

6752
03:38:04,160 --> 03:38:04,980
It's gonna be so fast!

6753
03:38:05,020 --> 03:38:05,580
Sure for it!

6754
03:38:06,600 --> 03:38:07,120
Okay.

6755
03:38:08,480 --> 03:38:10,100
You know how much time we have left?

6756
03:38:10,320 --> 03:38:11,360
It's called time efficiency.

6757
03:38:11,680 --> 03:38:12,140
Alright, fine!

6758
03:38:12,260 --> 03:38:13,120
Go kill Anubis!

6759
03:38:15,600 --> 03:38:16,920
Wait, where the fuck is Anubis?

6760
03:38:18,460 --> 03:38:18,860
Bro!

6761
03:38:19,000 --> 03:38:20,560
Why do... Why are these...

6762
03:38:20,560 --> 03:38:22,220
No, the fucking boss Anubis.

6763
03:38:22,600 --> 03:38:24,240
Oh yeah!

6764
03:38:24,320 --> 03:38:24,620
Yeah!

6765
03:38:24,640 --> 03:38:25,260
They can be mixed!

6766
03:38:25,300 --> 03:38:25,780
They can be mixed!

6767
03:38:25,800 --> 03:38:26,260

6768
03:38:26,860 --> 03:38:28,460

6769
03:38:29,180 --> 03:38:29,980
How do we pet?

6770
03:38:30,060 --> 03:38:30,880
I forgot how to pet.

6771
03:38:32,120 --> 03:38:33,120
And what the fuck is he?

6772
03:38:33,260 --> 03:38:33,860
Who was he before?

6773
03:38:34,700 --> 03:38:35,380
Alright guys!

6774
03:38:35,540 --> 03:38:39,140
We are... Let's go downstairs and pet them because there's too many pals here.

6775
03:38:39,980 --> 03:38:41,160
Wait, did you bring them downstairs?

6776
03:38:41,460 --> 03:38:41,800
Wait, what?

6777
03:38:41,800 --> 03:38:41,960
No, no.

6778
03:38:41,960 --> 03:38:44,480
I'm going down to the mound so we can all like get the...

6779
03:38:45,040 --> 03:38:46,040

6780
03:38:46,120 --> 03:38:48,380
We got all these other pals blocking it.

6781
03:38:48,660 --> 03:38:49,440
You guys ready?

6782
03:38:49,760 --> 03:38:50,560
We have to do this.

6783
03:38:50,680 --> 03:38:50,980
Alright.

6790
03:38:57,840 --> 03:38:58,780
You're playing on controller?

6791

03:39:34,260 --> 03:39:34,720
Lily's not here!

6825
03:39:34,720 --> 03:39:37,000
You guys are still petting them and Shy Lily's not here yet.

6826
03:39:37,140 --> 03:39:39,900
Yeah, I was like how did you get all of us if Lily's not here?

6827
03:39:40,180 --> 03:39:44,020

Alright, good thing my Boncherry is grass too.

6837
03:39:57,260 --> 03:39:59,700
So you can pet your Boncherry again.

6846
03:40:18,440 --> 03:40:19,840
That's not grass.

6847

Alright.

6848
03:40:21,820 --> 03:40:24,520
Oh my god, why does he look like such a handsome man?

Dark type.

6857
03:40:37,300 --> 03:40:38,900
That's enough, stop petting.

6858
03:40:38,940 --> 03:40:39,380
Get out of the way.

6859
03:40:39,400 --> 03:40:40,020
Get out, get out.

No, that's neutral.

6866
03:40:49,480 --> 03:40:50,140
That's electric.

6867
03:40:50,560 --> 03:40:51,300
That's dragon.

6868
03:40:51,620 --> 03:40:52,860

03:40:55,160 --> 03:40:56,760
You can also smoke by element.

6872
03:40:57,000 --> 03:40:57,680
Yeah, I smoke by element.

6892
03:41:34,940 --> 03:41:36,860
Wait, does anyone have an ice for her?

6893
03:41:38,200 --> 03:41:40,420
Let me double check, but I don't think I have ice.

6894
03:41:40,420 --> 03:41:41,240
Oh, come on.

6895
03:41:41,280 --> 03:41:42,340

There you go.

6900
03:41:45,980 --> 03:41:46,260
That counts.

6901
03:41:46,840 --> 03:41:47,400
Yeah, yeah, that counts.

6902
03:41:47,720 --> 03:41:50,900
Well, we're getting raided right now, so...

6903
03:41:50,900 --> 03:41:51,320

6913
03:42:01,260 --> 03:42:01,840

6914
03:42:03,500 --> 03:42:04,400

We don't care.

6920
03:42:11,600 --> 03:42:12,740

6923
03:42:16,420 --> 03:42:18,400
In the middle of a fucking war.

6924
03:42:19,940 --> 03:42:20,980
What happened to us?

6925
03:42:22,400 --> 03:42:23,540
It's fucking dying.

6926
03:42:24,520 --> 03:42:25,100

6927
03:42:25,100 --> 03:42:26,220
It's okay, we got the clip.

03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:09,840
See you.

6956
03:43:09,940 --> 03:43:10,680
Everybody's dead.

6957
03:43:10,840 --> 03:43:12,140
Everything at base is dead.

6958
03:43:12,240 --> 03:43:14,880
I don't need anything because everything's dead.

6959
03:43:15,160 --> 03:43:16,180
Okay, we got...

6960

Let's keep petting.

6962
03:43:19,940 --> 03:43:20,460
Earth type.

6963
03:43:21,980 --> 03:43:25,300
I'm gonna grab the sick ones and put them back in the box so they can heal.

6964
03:43:25,480 --> 03:43:25,680
Okay.

6965

03:43:30,480 --> 03:43:30,920
Ground.

6967
03:43:31,220 --> 03:43:31,660
Grass.

6968
03:43:32,860 --> 03:43:34,200
Where the fuck is he at?

6969
03:43:34,200 --> 03:43:36,060

6970
03:43:36,060 --> 03:43:36,660

6971
03:43:37,560 --> 03:43:38,660
Is ground earth?

6972
03:43:38,900 --> 03:43:40,400

6973
03:43:41,200 --> 03:43:43,280

6978
03:43:51,440 --> 03:43:52,300
I'm at the bottom.

6979
03:43:52,520 --> 03:43:53,960
I have my trust in ground.

6980
03:43:54,680 --> 03:43:55,980
Okay, sorry.

6981
03:43:56,100 --> 03:43:56,560
Give me one second.

6982
03:43:56,780 --> 03:43:57,420
Earth is ground.

6983
03:43:59,260 --> 03:44:02,080
I'm gonna grab all the pals now.

6984
03:44:02,080 --> 03:44:04,180
Okay, earth, fire, electric dragon.

Wait, is that earth?

6988
03:44:08,200 --> 03:44:08,440
No.

6989
03:44:08,540 --> 03:44:09,380
No, dire howl is neutral.

6990
03:44:10,800 --> 03:44:12,520
I don't have an earth one.

6991
03:44:12,660 --> 03:44:13,060
I don't think...

6992
03:44:13,060 --> 03:44:13,960
I can give you an earth...

6993
03:44:14,660 --> 03:44:15,380
Rush war?

6994
03:44:15,520 --> 03:44:16,240

6996
03:44:19,260 --> 03:44:19,680

6998
03:44:20,960 --> 03:44:21,700

6999
03:44:21,720 --> 03:44:22,300

Wait, it has to be different?

7020
03:44:54,340 --> 03:44:55,320
Yeah, it has to be different.

7025
03:44:59,420 --> 03:44:59,980

Are we gonna try and do the kill achievements with the unique skills?

7073
03:46:15,540 --> 03:46:17,200
I don't think we have time for that.

7074
03:46:17,300 --> 03:46:18,960
Those are like not a lot of points either.

7075
03:46:19,560 --> 03:46:20,000
Two.

7076
03:46:22,060 --> 03:46:27,160
Yeah, I think we just focus on the other, the easier ones first cause that might be too much.

7077
03:46:27,220 --> 03:46:28,820

03:46:33,500 --> 03:46:34,320
Lily needs one.

7083
03:46:34,480 --> 03:46:35,840
I can steal grisbal.

7084
03:46:36,040 --> 03:46:36,720
Oh, you have grisbal?

7085
03:46:37,400 --> 03:46:38,260
Yeah, you can have it.

7086
03:46:38,340 --> 03:46:40,980
Just take him from the farm for now.

7087
03:46:41,640 --> 03:46:42,000
Alright.

7088
03:46:42,980 --> 03:46:43,480
I'm ready.

7089
03:46:43,540 --> 03:46:43,920
One over here.

7090
03:46:44,600 --> 03:46:45,260
Pet, pet, pet.

7091
03:46:46,540 --> 03:46:47,380
Let me see.

7092
03:46:47,460 --> 03:46:47,780
Yeah.

7093
03:46:47,840 --> 03:46:48,380
Pet, pet, pet.

7094
03:46:50,080 --> 03:46:51,100
Alright, dig it.

7095
03:46:51,540 --> 03:46:52,220
Clip, clip, clip.

7096
03:46:52,280 --> 03:46:52,800
Clip, clip, clip.

7097
03:46:55,300 --> 03:46:55,760
What's next?

7098
03:46:56,100 --> 03:46:57,420
Uh, last one is dragon.

7099
03:46:57,420 --> 03:46:57,920
Yep.

7100
03:46:58,760 --> 03:47:02,560
I wonder if I can use the same pet for a different type.

7101
03:47:02,800 --> 03:47:03,460
Yeah, you can.

7102
03:47:04,980 --> 03:47:05,780
We'll find out.

7103
03:47:05,920 --> 03:47:07,060
Alright, let's go.

7104
03:47:07,780 --> 03:47:08,120
I'm ready.

7105
03:47:08,440 --> 03:47:09,600
I don't have dragon yet.

7106
03:47:09,620 --> 03:47:10,520
Let me grab my dragon.

7107
03:47:10,900 --> 03:47:12,760
Let me see if I have a dragon.

7108
03:47:12,920 --> 03:47:14,680
I might need someone to drop me a dragon.

7109
03:47:15,120 --> 03:47:16,380
Yeah, we might have to drop you a dragon.

7110
03:47:17,320 --> 03:47:18,120
Oh, I have a quiver.

7111
03:47:18,400 --> 03:47:19,900
I'm getting a quiver for mine.

7112
03:47:20,740 --> 03:47:21,140
Okay.

7113
03:47:21,940 --> 03:47:22,540
Um, wait.

7114
03:47:22,660 --> 03:47:23,500
Can you use...

7115
03:47:23,500 --> 03:47:24,900
You can use a...

7116
03:47:24,900 --> 03:47:25,220
Oh, wait.

7117
03:47:25,240 --> 03:47:26,200
I'm gonna use chillit for mine.

7118
03:47:26,220 --> 03:47:26,400
Sorry.

7119
03:47:26,500 --> 03:47:27,960
Vanworm is not a dragon.

7120
03:47:27,960 --> 03:47:28,980
Yeah, Vanworm is not a dragon.

7121
03:47:29,120 --> 03:47:29,720
I'll use chillit.

7122
03:47:30,960 --> 03:47:31,240
Alright.

7123
03:47:31,440 --> 03:47:32,180
Oh, shit.

7124
03:47:32,360 --> 03:47:32,980
You're fucking huge.

7125
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:33,680
Yeah, I need a dragon.

7126
03:47:33,800 --> 03:47:34,160
I don't have a dragon.

7127
03:47:34,160 --> 03:47:34,320
Oh, yeah.

7128
03:47:34,340 --> 03:47:34,560
I have a dragon.

7129
03:47:34,600 --> 03:47:34,780
Okay.

7130
03:47:34,940 --> 03:47:35,780
I can give you one.

7131
03:47:36,100 --> 03:47:37,780
I'm putting one... Oh, I can use azurobe.

7132
03:47:37,820 --> 03:47:38,600
I can steal azurobe.

7133
03:47:38,600 --> 03:47:39,260
Yeah, you can use azurobe.

7134
03:47:39,360 --> 03:47:40,220
Is azurobe dragon?

7135
03:47:41,020 --> 03:47:41,540
Yeah, probably.

7136
03:47:41,580 --> 03:47:41,800
Okay.

7137
03:47:45,480 --> 03:47:45,760
Nice.

7138
03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:47,800
Okay.

7139
03:47:50,120 --> 03:47:50,400
Ready?

7140
03:47:50,400 --> 03:47:50,680
Yep.

7141
03:47:51,080 --> 03:47:51,720
Pet, pet, pet.

7142
03:47:52,100 --> 03:47:52,800
Pet, pet, pet.

7143
03:47:52,860 --> 03:47:53,640
Pet, pet, pet.

7144
03:47:54,340 --> 03:47:54,880
Pet, pet, pet.

7145
03:47:55,360 --> 03:47:56,420
Oh, my god.

7146
03:47:56,480 --> 03:47:57,480
You can barely see anything.

7147
03:47:57,640 --> 03:47:58,120
Click, click, click.

7148
03:47:58,780 --> 03:47:59,580
Click, click, click.

7149
03:48:00,200 --> 03:48:02,260
You're just gonna have to trust in us.

7150
03:48:02,480 --> 03:48:03,760
Trust us, yeah.

7151
03:48:03,980 --> 03:48:04,660
Trust the process.

7152
03:48:04,880 --> 03:48:05,500
Believe us.

7153
03:48:06,540 --> 03:48:06,940
Alright.

7154
03:48:07,960 --> 03:48:08,520
PB Mod.

7155
03:48:08,600 --> 03:48:11,280
You should have two, four, six, eight clips.

7156
03:48:11,440 --> 03:48:11,540
All of them.

7157
03:48:11,540 --> 03:48:12,560
You should have eight clips there.

7158
03:48:13,220 --> 03:48:13,620
Alright.

7159
03:48:13,860 --> 03:48:14,620
There we go.

7160
03:48:14,660 --> 03:48:15,100
We did it.

7161
03:48:15,600 --> 03:48:16,000
Alright.

7162
03:48:16,080 --> 03:48:18,420
Back to killing bosses here for it.

7163
03:48:18,440 --> 03:48:19,060
Back to work.

7164
03:48:19,520 --> 03:48:19,920
Okay.

7165
03:48:20,020 --> 03:48:20,420
Um...

7166
03:48:20,840 --> 03:48:21,240
Wait.

7167
03:48:21,560 --> 03:48:22,480
Can you make the...

7168
03:48:22,480 --> 03:48:23,540
Can you make the thing?

7169
03:48:23,880 --> 03:48:24,720
Did we bring it?

7170
03:48:24,900 --> 03:48:25,420
Yeah.

7171
03:48:25,540 --> 03:48:26,580
Did we bring you enough?

7172
03:48:26,620 --> 03:48:27,380
Or the...

7173
03:48:28,420 --> 03:48:28,980
Uh...

7174
03:48:29,820 --> 03:48:32,580
You have enough for high quality pallets?

7175
03:48:32,740 --> 03:48:32,980
Yeah.

7176
03:48:32,980 --> 03:48:35,520
To make the...

7177
03:48:37,040 --> 03:48:38,920
Polymers to make the...

7178
03:48:38,920 --> 03:48:39,100
Conducting line two?

7179
03:48:40,120 --> 03:48:40,680
Yeah.

7180
03:48:40,980 --> 03:48:45,280
I need six more refined ingots.

7181
03:48:45,860 --> 03:48:46,640
Five circuit boards.

7182
03:48:46,640 --> 03:48:47,480
Six more refined ingots?

7183
03:48:47,480 --> 03:48:47,760
Alright.

7184
03:48:47,800 --> 03:48:48,260
No problem.

7185
03:48:48,300 --> 03:48:49,400
And 21 nails.

7186
03:48:49,880 --> 03:48:50,240
Wait.

7187
03:48:50,240 --> 03:48:51,180
What was the second one?

7188
03:48:52,580 --> 03:48:53,780
Five circuit boards.

7189
03:48:54,900 --> 03:48:55,360
Okay.

7190
03:48:55,380 --> 03:48:56,620
I can make five circuit boards.

7191
03:48:56,940 --> 03:48:58,820
Where the fuck are my nails?

7192
03:48:59,160 --> 03:49:01,440
I need the nails and the refined ingots.

7193
03:49:02,720 --> 03:49:04,080
And then we're gooch.

7194
03:49:04,200 --> 03:49:05,420
What is palmetal ingots?

7195
03:49:05,440 --> 03:49:07,060
What the heck do I make nails for?

7196
03:49:07,060 --> 03:49:07,240
Oh, that's for the other thing.

7197
03:49:07,500 --> 03:49:08,460
Oh, I can't make nails.

7198
03:49:08,720 --> 03:49:10,040
Those are for the legendary spirits.

7199
03:49:10,180 --> 03:49:10,440
Alright.

7200
03:49:10,440 --> 03:49:12,440
We're gonna need to get those off the line.

7201
03:49:12,980 --> 03:49:14,740
To make more refined ingot.

7202
03:49:16,320 --> 03:49:16,800
Alright.

7203
03:49:16,960 --> 03:49:17,680
I'm gonna...

7204
03:49:17,680 --> 03:49:17,960
Okay.

7205
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:18,940
I need to steal some food.

7206
03:49:18,980 --> 03:49:19,800
I'm fucking hungry.

7207
03:49:21,100 --> 03:49:22,720
We only need six refined ingots.

7208
03:49:23,180 --> 03:49:23,600
Yeah.

7209
03:49:23,720 --> 03:49:27,060
We're having a little bit of a problem in that everything died.

7210
03:49:28,140 --> 03:49:28,560
Yeah.

7211
03:49:28,840 --> 03:49:29,260
Okay.

7212
03:49:29,360 --> 03:49:30,440
Well, we have like 30 minutes.

7213
03:49:30,520 --> 03:49:30,980
So you guys...

7214
03:49:31,520 --> 03:49:33,540
Let's try to speedrun this.

7215
03:49:33,760 --> 03:49:36,680
Surefour and I can finish the rest of the bosses.

7216
03:49:36,680 --> 03:49:38,040
I'll try to build the...

7217
03:49:38,520 --> 03:49:42,960
We need to be at level 20 as well to make the zoo with 20 people in it.

7218
03:49:43,160 --> 03:49:43,440
We need to be at level 20 as well to make the zoo with 20 people in it.

7219
03:49:43,440 --> 03:49:43,460
Okay.

7220
03:49:43,600 --> 03:49:44,000
Yeah.

7221
03:49:44,040 --> 03:49:44,220
Alright.

7222
03:49:44,700 --> 03:49:46,920
Trevor, do you want to do the black marketeers right now with me?

7223
03:49:48,500 --> 03:49:49,780
Trevor, do you want to do the black marketeers right now with me?

7224
03:49:49,780 --> 03:49:50,280
Okay.

7225
03:49:50,300 --> 03:49:50,820
After that.

7226
03:49:50,840 --> 03:49:51,220
Then I'll...

7227
03:49:51,220 --> 03:49:53,000
You and I will do the black marketeers thing.

7228
03:49:53,280 --> 03:49:55,480
We need to know where the second black marketeer is though.

7229
03:49:55,680 --> 03:49:55,740
Oh.

7230
03:49:55,740 --> 03:49:57,120
We can find...

7231
03:49:57,120 --> 03:49:58,520
I can find one easily.

7232
03:50:00,160 --> 03:50:00,960
I have the...

7233
03:50:00,960 --> 03:50:03,500
I'll find the second one right now and then try to market.

7234
03:50:03,740 --> 03:50:03,860
Okay.

7235
03:50:06,880 --> 03:50:07,880
Where am I?

7236
03:50:08,860 --> 03:50:09,260
Okay.

7237
03:50:09,260 --> 03:50:09,700
What do we need?

7238
03:50:09,800 --> 03:50:10,540
I did the nails.

7239
03:50:11,920 --> 03:50:12,320
Okay.

7240
03:50:12,320 --> 03:50:12,900
There's one here.

7241
03:50:13,620 --> 03:50:15,720
Can you go get some more pal oil?

7242
03:50:16,420 --> 03:50:16,820
Yeah.

7243
03:50:16,820 --> 03:50:17,920
You get the pal oil.

7244
03:50:17,940 --> 03:50:18,300
Thank you.

7245
03:50:18,340 --> 03:50:18,640
Thank you.

7246
03:50:19,780 --> 03:50:20,100
There's one.

7247
03:50:21,680 --> 03:50:22,100
Okay.

7248
03:50:22,180 --> 03:50:22,880
I don't want to do...

7249
03:50:22,880 --> 03:50:24,220
Guys, I don't want to do the... That's my pal.

7250
03:50:24,620 --> 03:50:26,780
Do it with so many people around us.

7251
03:50:26,840 --> 03:50:28,640
So, there's one here that I know.

7252
03:50:31,160 --> 03:50:31,760
Let's see.

7253
03:50:31,840 --> 03:50:33,800
I have nine more pal oil.

7254
03:50:34,060 --> 03:50:34,900
I can deposit.

7255
03:50:35,020 --> 03:50:37,000
We need to butcher chickens as well, right?

7256
03:50:37,220 --> 03:50:37,640
Yeah.

7257
03:50:38,160 --> 03:50:38,580
Okay.

7258
03:50:38,700 --> 03:50:40,900
Now we can do it really fast because we have so many chickens.

7259
03:50:41,360 --> 03:50:41,780
Yeah.

7260
03:50:44,380 --> 03:50:44,800
Okay.

7261
03:50:44,900 --> 03:50:46,340
How much pal oil do we still need?

7262
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:49,580
Do you know?

7263
03:50:49,780 --> 03:50:49,880
I'm not sure.

7264
03:50:49,880 --> 03:50:51,480
How much pal oil do we need for the polymer?

7265
03:50:51,680 --> 03:50:52,060
None.

7266
03:50:52,540 --> 03:50:53,540
We're already done with that.

7267
03:50:53,660 --> 03:50:54,820
What materials are we needing?

7268
03:50:55,140 --> 03:50:55,540
Boards.

7269
03:50:57,540 --> 03:50:58,460
So, we don't need that.

7270
03:50:58,600 --> 03:51:01,180
Six or seven refined ingots.

7271
03:51:01,400 --> 03:51:02,240
Twenty-one nails.

7272
03:51:02,840 --> 03:51:03,680
Twenty-one nails.

7273
03:51:03,740 --> 03:51:04,300
Nails are done.

7274
03:51:04,380 --> 03:51:05,300
We just need to get the...

7275
03:51:05,300 --> 03:51:07,340
Now I caught the Suzuku.

7276
03:51:07,580 --> 03:51:10,100
I found the black marketeer.

7277
03:51:10,260 --> 03:51:10,680
Level 40.

7278
03:51:10,880 --> 03:51:11,560
I found another one.

7279
03:51:11,620 --> 03:51:12,320
Refined ingot.

7280
03:51:12,460 --> 03:51:14,800
I'm going to make as many as it'll make.

7281
03:51:15,040 --> 03:51:16,460
I can kill them.

7282
03:51:16,620 --> 03:51:18,420
And I'm also almost level 50.

7283
03:51:19,060 --> 03:51:19,800
Alright, nice.

7284
03:51:19,960 --> 03:51:21,860
Ingot will be done by the time you get back.

7285
03:51:21,960 --> 03:51:23,420
It's already at seven, eight, nine.

7286
03:51:23,660 --> 03:51:25,780
So, if you just come, you'll have enough.

7287
03:51:26,860 --> 03:51:27,860
Now someone can clip the real Suzuku.

7288
03:51:27,860 --> 03:51:29,220
So, are we missing anything then still?

7289
03:51:30,140 --> 03:51:31,240
Clip, clip, clip, Suzuku.

7290
03:51:31,720 --> 03:51:33,120
No, actually, I think we're good.

7291
03:51:33,140 --> 03:51:34,360
We don't need high quality pal oil.

7292
03:51:34,520 --> 03:51:35,480
PP mod Suzuku.

7293
03:51:37,860 --> 03:51:39,320
We just need the refined ingots.

7294
03:51:39,320 --> 03:51:42,300
If you can just go catch a couple of pals so that you're...

7295
03:51:42,300 --> 03:51:43,760
Yeah, because I'm going to...

7296
03:51:43,760 --> 03:51:45,000
Yeah, Lily, you just go catch pals.

7297
03:51:45,360 --> 03:51:46,520
Go catch pals.

7298
03:51:46,760 --> 03:51:48,260
Sure, Four and I are just going to focus on...

7299
03:51:48,420 --> 03:51:49,240
Black Marketeers right now.

7300
03:51:50,200 --> 03:51:50,640
Okay.

7301
03:51:51,140 --> 03:51:53,100
I'm waiting for you on one of them.

7302
03:51:53,140 --> 03:51:53,560
On me.

7303
03:51:54,600 --> 03:51:55,040
Yeah.

7304
03:51:55,320 --> 03:51:57,200
Do you have the waypoint for this?

7305
03:51:58,540 --> 03:51:59,820
I'm about to find out.

7306
03:52:04,570 --> 03:52:05,170
Let's see.

7307
03:52:05,930 --> 03:52:06,550
Oh, shit.

7308
03:52:06,630 --> 03:52:09,290
At the ten minute mark, we can do the chicken and the human thing.

7309
03:52:11,450 --> 03:52:13,390
I'm looking at the global just to be sure.

7310
03:52:17,090 --> 03:52:18,650
How hard is tower three?

7311
03:52:19,090 --> 03:52:19,830
I'm at you.

7312
03:52:19,870 --> 03:52:20,690
Okay, let's go.

7313
03:52:21,590 --> 03:52:22,350
Follow me.

7314
03:52:24,750 --> 03:52:25,730
It's like right here.

7315
03:52:33,270 --> 03:52:33,750
There.

7316
03:52:35,330 --> 03:52:36,070
Dig toys.

7317
03:52:36,770 --> 03:52:37,250
Ow.

7318
03:52:39,130 --> 03:52:40,170
Here we come.

7319
03:52:40,250 --> 03:52:41,070
Over here.

7320
03:52:41,850 --> 03:52:44,690
Do you want me to make more of the pal metal ingot?

7321
03:52:45,130 --> 03:52:46,130
I don't think you can.

7322
03:52:47,330 --> 03:52:48,190
I can.

7323
03:52:48,710 --> 03:52:49,510
Oh, can you?

7324
03:52:49,730 --> 03:52:50,210
Yeah.

7325
03:52:50,750 --> 03:52:52,050
Just make as many as I can?

7326
03:52:52,430 --> 03:52:52,730
Yeah.

7327
03:52:52,950 --> 03:52:53,430
Okay.

7328
03:52:53,930 --> 03:52:54,890
I'm ready whenever.

7329
03:52:55,610 --> 03:52:56,090
Alright.

7330
03:52:58,090 --> 03:52:58,890
Fuck him up.

7331
03:52:59,310 --> 03:52:59,830
Let's go.

7332
03:53:00,150 --> 03:53:01,270
We gotta capture him.

7333
03:53:04,860 --> 03:53:05,920
Oh my god.

7334
03:53:07,320 --> 03:53:08,400
He's getting fucked up.

7335
03:53:08,420 --> 03:53:10,540
I'm a little over encumbered at the moment.

7336
03:53:10,800 --> 03:53:12,260
Alright, be careful on the deets I guess.

7337
03:53:12,480 --> 03:53:12,760
Yeah.

7338
03:53:14,600 --> 03:53:15,440
I'm gonna...

7339
03:53:15,440 --> 03:53:17,580
My shotgun does a lot of damage to him.

7340
03:53:19,400 --> 03:53:21,180
My van should kill him.

7341
03:53:21,580 --> 03:53:22,880
That sounded really good.

7342
03:53:22,880 --> 03:53:23,480
I'm gonna reset him now.

7343
03:53:24,800 --> 03:53:25,160
Yeah.

7344
03:53:25,160 --> 03:53:26,360
You can catch him now.

7345
03:53:26,600 --> 03:53:26,960
Okay.

7346
03:53:28,800 --> 03:53:30,580
Fuck, which spear should I be using?

7347
03:53:30,820 --> 03:53:34,120
I have no idea, but we need to catch this fucker.

7348
03:53:39,290 --> 03:53:39,650
Okay.

7349
03:53:39,690 --> 03:53:40,150
Come on.

7350
03:53:42,210 --> 03:53:42,570
Nice.

7351
03:53:42,570 --> 03:53:43,570
12 percenter.

7352
03:53:43,790 --> 03:53:44,250
Let's go.

7353
03:53:44,530 --> 03:53:45,950
We got one of the black marketeers.

7354
03:53:45,990 --> 03:53:46,690
We just need one more.

7355
03:53:46,750 --> 03:53:47,110
Clip that.

7356
03:53:47,150 --> 03:53:47,670
Clip, clip, clip.

7357
03:53:47,970 --> 03:53:49,090
Clip us catching that one.

7358
03:53:49,550 --> 03:53:50,750
Then get it later.

7359
03:53:50,990 --> 03:53:52,630
Alright, let's go for the other one.

7360
03:53:52,790 --> 03:53:54,150
I marked it, so just follow.

7361
03:53:55,650 --> 03:53:57,450
I think we need more spears.

7362
03:53:57,450 --> 03:53:59,250
Come back to base and build the thing then.

7363
03:53:59,810 --> 03:54:01,230
We have all the materials you should need.

7364
03:54:01,230 --> 03:54:01,290
Oh, okay.

7365
03:54:01,470 --> 03:54:02,350
You go build it.

7366
03:54:03,170 --> 03:54:03,970
And then...

7367
03:54:03,970 --> 03:54:06,830
I can set up the jail with the humans in it.

7368
03:54:06,830 --> 03:54:08,070
I can set up the jail with the humans in it.

7369
03:54:08,550 --> 03:54:10,930
Can you build... No, it's not gonna show for...

7370
03:54:10,930 --> 03:54:12,710
Can you get more spears for sure for them?

7371
03:54:12,930 --> 03:54:13,250
Yeah.

7372
03:54:13,370 --> 03:54:16,050
I have to start the thing.

7373
03:54:16,050 --> 03:54:18,750
I made the pal metal for you.

7374
03:54:19,490 --> 03:54:21,690
I don't have the recipe for the spears though.

7375
03:54:21,910 --> 03:54:22,310
Alright.

7376
03:54:24,110 --> 03:54:28,130
I'll go to the other marketeer whenever he's ready so he'll know where it is.

7377
03:54:28,810 --> 03:54:31,070
I need palladium fragments.

7378
03:54:31,510 --> 03:54:32,790
Palladium fragments are done.

7379
03:54:32,910 --> 03:54:33,330
Let me grab them.

7380
03:54:34,390 --> 03:54:36,430
I'm gonna get to the other one right now.

7381
03:54:37,150 --> 03:54:38,210
How many do you need?

7382
03:54:39,750 --> 03:54:40,990
As many as you can.

7383
03:54:41,410 --> 03:54:41,850
Okay.

7384
03:54:42,790 --> 03:54:43,230
Alright.

7385
03:54:43,310 --> 03:54:44,530
I've got 17 right now.

7386
03:54:44,590 --> 03:54:46,730
I should have had 46 but I don't.

7387
03:54:50,050 --> 03:54:51,250
Go power lover!

7388
03:54:51,310 --> 03:54:52,030
Palladium fragments are in.

7389
03:54:52,030 --> 03:54:52,290
Go!

7390
03:54:59,360 --> 03:54:59,840
I'm gonna get the potion.

7391
03:55:02,580 --> 03:55:03,060
Okay.

7392
03:55:04,560 --> 03:55:06,240
I'm heading to the second marketeer.

7393
03:55:07,960 --> 03:55:08,440
What?!

7394
03:55:08,440 --> 03:55:09,020
Okay.

7395
03:55:09,100 --> 03:55:10,040
He's on the crusher again.

7396
03:55:10,940 --> 03:55:12,880
Lily's just catching pals right now guys.

7397
03:55:12,980 --> 03:55:14,460
She needs all the pals she can get.

7398
03:55:15,120 --> 03:55:16,180
I just need pals.

7399
03:55:18,700 --> 03:55:19,600
Preaching to the choir.

7400
03:55:23,820 --> 03:55:25,860
I still need the nine nails.

7401
03:55:26,340 --> 03:55:26,820
And...

7402
03:55:26,820 --> 03:55:28,200
Oh, I need like...

7403
03:55:29,540 --> 03:55:29,660
Four nails.

7404
03:55:30,360 --> 03:55:32,520
What do you need?

7405
03:55:32,860 --> 03:55:33,460
Nine nails.

7406
03:55:34,880 --> 03:55:35,280
Wow!

7407
03:55:36,540 --> 03:55:37,500
Put them in a box.

7408
03:55:37,980 --> 03:55:38,380
Okay.

7409
03:55:46,080 --> 03:55:46,980
In the box.

7410
03:55:48,160 --> 03:55:48,720
Wait, no.

7411
03:55:48,780 --> 03:55:49,240
That's a dungeon.

7412
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:50,000
It's not working.

7413
03:55:50,280 --> 03:55:51,440
I still need nine apparently.

7414
03:55:51,800 --> 03:55:53,160
Wait, did I went the wrong one?

7415
03:55:53,820 --> 03:55:55,340
Is this the wrong area?

7416
03:55:55,680 --> 03:55:57,020
Yeah, where do I put this thing?

7417
03:55:58,060 --> 03:55:58,660
Anywhere you can.

7418
03:55:59,940 --> 03:56:01,720
I can get rid of the shit down here.

7419
03:56:02,020 --> 03:56:04,340
We don't need these two farms anymore.

7420
03:56:05,220 --> 03:56:05,760
This one right here?

7421
03:56:06,520 --> 03:56:07,360
Wait, which one?

7422
03:56:07,760 --> 03:56:08,200
This.

7423
03:56:08,520 --> 03:56:10,000
The production up here.

7424
03:56:10,380 --> 03:56:11,200
To your right.

7425
03:56:13,200 --> 03:56:14,120
Up here.

7426
03:56:14,220 --> 03:56:14,740
I'm jumping on.

7427
03:56:14,840 --> 03:56:15,260
Oh shit.

7428
03:56:15,380 --> 03:56:16,180
Fucking on.

7429
03:56:17,640 --> 03:56:19,040
I'll just put it down there.

7430
03:56:19,140 --> 03:56:19,460
Fuck it.

7431
03:56:20,140 --> 03:56:22,560
Sorry, I became over-encumbered.

7432
03:56:23,320 --> 03:56:23,780
Eeeeee!

7433
03:56:26,460 --> 03:56:29,640
I went the wrong way for the black marketeer.

7434
03:56:29,980 --> 03:56:31,360
Wait, it's inside the dungeon?

7435
03:56:31,780 --> 03:56:32,200
Is that...

7436
03:56:32,200 --> 03:56:33,500
Did I actually mark it correctly?

7437
03:56:33,920 --> 03:56:34,680
It's not a dungeon.

7438
03:56:35,120 --> 03:56:35,440
It's...

7439
03:56:35,840 --> 03:56:36,160
Okay.

7440
03:56:36,660 --> 03:56:37,640
Which one are you going to?

7441
03:56:37,880 --> 03:56:38,240
I don't know.

7442
03:56:38,260 --> 03:56:38,980
I think I went the wrong way.

7443
03:56:39,940 --> 03:56:41,140
Yeah, you should come to me.

7444
03:56:41,260 --> 03:56:42,960
I know where there's one real close.

7445
03:56:43,200 --> 03:56:43,440
Okay.

7446
03:56:44,200 --> 03:56:44,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7447
03:56:45,200 --> 03:56:46,680
I might just go catch it right now.

7448
03:56:46,680 --> 03:56:47,360
Yeah, you can go catch it.

7449
03:56:47,360 --> 03:56:47,960
You don't need me, right?

7450
03:56:47,960 --> 03:56:49,800
I can do the rest of the build if you did it.

7451
03:56:49,840 --> 03:56:50,520
Alright, then we're good.

7452
03:56:50,960 --> 03:56:51,480
That's fine.

7453
03:56:53,260 --> 03:56:54,260
Yeah, I went the wrong way.

7454
03:56:54,280 --> 03:56:55,180
I found... I just...

7455
03:56:55,180 --> 03:56:55,520
I just need luck.

7456
03:56:55,920 --> 03:56:58,300
Yeah, there's one underneath the desolate church.

7457
03:56:58,300 --> 03:56:59,840
Yeah, you can get that then.

7458
03:57:00,360 --> 03:57:02,760
I'll go... I'm going to look at what else I can do.

7459
03:57:02,940 --> 03:57:04,100
I'll go get the...

7460
03:57:04,620 --> 03:57:05,780
There's still 20 minutes.

7461
03:57:05,840 --> 03:57:07,020
I can kill this other boss then.

7462
03:57:07,380 --> 03:57:07,640
Okay.

7463
03:57:09,800 --> 03:57:10,200
Oh...

7464
03:57:10,200 --> 03:57:12,240
Alright, I'm going to upgrade the base level.

7465
03:57:12,940 --> 03:57:13,700
I'm hungry.

7466
03:57:13,800 --> 03:57:14,020
Fuck.

7467
03:57:14,100 --> 03:57:14,440
Okay.

7468
03:57:16,340 --> 03:57:17,280
Is there more food?

7469
03:57:17,480 --> 03:57:17,940
Back at base?

7470
03:57:17,940 --> 03:57:19,940
Wait, was that assembly line 2 or was that assembly line 1?

7471
03:57:20,460 --> 03:57:21,560
That was assembly line 2.

7472
03:57:21,880 --> 03:57:23,220
You need a 2 to upgrade.

7473
03:57:23,480 --> 03:57:24,580
Why isn't it registered?

7474
03:57:24,880 --> 03:57:25,180
Hold on.

7475
03:57:28,540 --> 03:57:28,940
Eh?

7476
03:57:30,980 --> 03:57:32,880
It says that it's not built.

7477
03:57:33,020 --> 03:57:33,060
It says that it's not built.

7478
03:57:34,300 --> 03:57:36,100
Uh... let me head over and see.

7479
03:57:36,440 --> 03:57:37,600
I mean, you can look at it.

7480
03:57:37,660 --> 03:57:38,160
It says...

7481
03:57:38,160 --> 03:57:38,660
Yeah.

7482
03:57:38,740 --> 03:57:39,460
No, I got it.

7483
03:57:39,500 --> 03:57:40,120
You're bugged.

7484
03:57:40,120 --> 03:57:40,600
You're bugged.

7485
03:57:40,600 --> 03:57:41,060
I got it.

7486
03:57:41,500 --> 03:57:42,480
Base level 20!

7487
03:57:42,780 --> 03:57:43,540
Clip, clip, clip!

7488
03:57:43,840 --> 03:57:44,620
Clip, clip, clip!

7489
03:57:44,840 --> 03:57:45,820
Base level 20!

7490
03:57:46,500 --> 03:57:47,160
Thank you!

7491
03:57:47,260 --> 03:57:47,700
Clip!

7492
03:57:47,700 --> 03:57:48,160
PP mod!

7493
03:57:48,900 --> 03:57:49,420
Let's go!

7494
03:57:49,620 --> 03:57:50,360
Base level 20!

7495
03:57:50,460 --> 03:57:51,720
I'm going to build... You were just bugged out.

7496
03:57:52,020 --> 03:57:52,580
I'm going to build the prison.

7497
03:57:52,740 --> 03:57:53,700
Okay, build the prison.

7498
03:57:53,760 --> 03:57:54,160
Yeah.

7499
03:57:55,440 --> 03:57:55,880
I'll...

7500
03:57:55,880 --> 03:57:56,980
Yeah, alright.

7501
03:57:57,780 --> 03:57:58,820
Alright, viewing cage.

7502
03:57:59,340 --> 03:58:00,040
Okay, let's go.

7503
03:58:00,060 --> 03:58:02,540
Let's see... Oh shit, viewing cage needs to be fucking huge.

7504
03:58:02,800 --> 03:58:03,020
Alright.

7505
03:58:04,880 --> 03:58:06,440
Uhhhh... I'm going to go catch...

7506
03:58:06,440 --> 03:58:08,920
Do we actually need this production assembly line?

7507
03:58:09,020 --> 03:58:10,540
Or can I just get rid of it now that we made it?

7508
03:58:10,940 --> 03:58:12,300
The number 1 or the number 2?

7509
03:58:12,960 --> 03:58:14,040
Uh... the number 2.

7510
03:58:14,300 --> 03:58:15,240
Because it's faster.

7511
03:58:15,440 --> 03:58:16,520
Just get rid of number 1 then.

7512
03:58:17,640 --> 03:58:18,000
Alright.

7513
03:58:18,000 --> 03:58:19,760
I need a big open space.

7514
03:58:20,120 --> 03:58:21,780
Can you make carbon fiber on it?

7515
03:58:22,660 --> 03:58:23,720
Uh... yeah, maybe.

7516
03:58:23,840 --> 03:58:24,200
Let me check.

7517
03:58:24,820 --> 03:58:25,180
Powered...

7518
03:58:25,180 --> 03:58:26,700
Oh wait, no, I don't have the recipe.

7519
03:58:26,700 --> 03:58:27,360
So, no.

7520
03:58:27,460 --> 03:58:28,460
Uh, you should have it.

7521
03:58:28,540 --> 03:58:29,280
Or you should be...

7522
03:58:29,280 --> 03:58:29,680
For carbon fiber?

7523
03:58:30,740 --> 03:58:31,140
Yeah.

7524
03:58:31,940 --> 03:58:32,940
It's right here.

7525
03:58:33,080 --> 03:58:33,300
Okay.

7526
03:58:35,440 --> 03:58:36,720
The fuck is my shit?

7527
03:58:38,260 --> 03:58:39,300
I've got mines...

7528
03:58:41,760 --> 03:58:42,560
Offensive walls...

7529
03:58:44,740 --> 03:58:45,140
Uhhhh...

7530
03:58:45,140 --> 03:58:46,580
Wait, I need a...

7531
03:58:46,580 --> 03:58:48,280
Fucking... fuck, I need a...

7532
03:58:48,280 --> 03:58:49,460
We're in 5th place right now!

7533
03:58:50,440 --> 03:58:50,840
Yoooo!

7534
03:58:51,800 --> 03:58:53,960
Sorry, carbon fiber's level 35.

7535
03:58:54,140 --> 03:58:54,760
I can't make it.

7536
03:58:54,840 --> 03:58:55,800
I can make it.

7537
03:58:55,960 --> 03:58:56,520
I'll make it.

7538
03:58:56,560 --> 03:58:56,680
I'll make it.

7539
03:58:56,700 --> 03:58:56,980
I can make it.

7540
03:58:57,220 --> 03:58:59,820
I can make it.

7541
03:58:59,900 --> 03:59:00,220
It's okay, Trevor.

7542
03:59:00,260 --> 03:59:01,000
You go do your bosses.

7543
03:59:01,780 --> 03:59:02,560
I'm working on it.

7544
03:59:02,860 --> 03:59:03,180
Alright.

7545
03:59:03,520 --> 03:59:03,840
I...

7546
03:59:04,240 --> 03:59:05,060
I can put it.

7547
03:59:05,120 --> 03:59:06,380
Where's the high quality crafter?

7548
03:59:06,380 --> 03:59:09,080
I'm gonna just try to make space wherever I can.

7549
03:59:09,200 --> 03:59:10,160
Oh my gosh, there's so many crafters.

7550
03:59:10,160 --> 03:59:11,360
This is just a regular assembly line, right?

7551
03:59:11,940 --> 03:59:13,620
Where's the assembly line so I can make the fiber?

7552
03:59:14,540 --> 03:59:16,020
Um, down below where the trees are.

7553
03:59:17,000 --> 03:59:18,480
Alright, I'll set it up.

7554
03:59:19,420 --> 03:59:19,740
Okay.

7555
03:59:21,480 --> 03:59:23,040
Uhhhh... Is it just carbon fiber?

7556
03:59:23,820 --> 03:59:24,140
Right?

7557
03:59:24,180 --> 03:59:24,620
With coal?

7558
03:59:24,760 --> 03:59:24,920
Yeah.

7559
03:59:25,000 --> 03:59:25,300
With coal?

7560
03:59:25,380 --> 03:59:26,000
How much do you need?

7561
03:59:27,100 --> 03:59:28,320
Just... a bunch?

7562
03:59:28,520 --> 03:59:29,460
I'll do thirty.

7563
03:59:30,560 --> 03:59:31,860
Okay, I'll put thirty up.

7564
03:59:32,320 --> 03:59:36,140
Okay, first try black market at your 7 percent, baby.

7565
03:59:36,260 --> 03:59:36,520
Nice!

7566
03:59:36,840 --> 03:59:38,120
Okay, clip clip clip...

7567
03:59:38,120 --> 03:59:38,940
We got two.

7568
03:59:39,180 --> 03:59:39,600
Clip.

7569
03:59:39,620 --> 03:59:42,360
Put the both of them there.

7570
03:59:42,520 --> 03:59:44,380
Cause we have two clips of us catching two.

7571
03:59:45,120 --> 03:59:48,640
Um, I'm taking ten of the tomatoes cause I'm fucking hungry right now.

7572
03:59:51,960 --> 03:59:52,460
Uhhhh...

7573
03:59:54,120 --> 03:59:56,180
I'm gonna go kill this one guy.

7574
03:59:57,420 --> 03:59:58,840
Oh yeah, I'm definitely bugged.

7575
04:00:00,560 --> 04:00:01,500
I'd have to re-log.

7576
04:00:02,220 --> 04:00:02,660
That's alright.

7577
04:00:02,820 --> 04:00:03,760
I think it's alright.

7578
04:00:04,340 --> 04:00:05,060
I'll make it work.

7579
04:00:07,840 --> 04:00:08,580
It's this way.

7580
04:00:09,840 --> 04:00:11,900
Anubis was bugged, so I couldn't kill him.

7581
04:00:12,260 --> 04:00:12,660
No!

7582
04:00:12,660 --> 04:00:14,460
I don't know what we're supposed to do about that.

7583
04:00:15,500 --> 04:00:17,740
I don't know if they'll give us free points or not.

7584
04:00:18,000 --> 04:00:18,920
Message... message...

7585
04:00:18,920 --> 04:00:22,060
I said Anubis is bugged and they ignored me.

7586
04:00:23,420 --> 04:00:25,640
Just do the other bosses then.

7587
04:00:25,940 --> 04:00:26,180
Alright.

7588
04:00:27,700 --> 04:00:29,820
I'm gonna try to make a holding pen somewhere.

7589
04:00:33,730 --> 04:00:34,210
Well...

7590
04:00:34,910 --> 04:00:37,910
The holding pen is really big, actually.

7591
04:00:38,610 --> 04:00:41,690
It requires quite a lot more room than I think we have to work with.

7592
04:00:42,450 --> 04:00:44,490
Just put it at a different base then.

7593
04:00:44,650 --> 04:00:45,110
Yeah, yeah.

7594
04:00:46,290 --> 04:00:49,430
Actually, that's a good idea because we need to put 20 anyway in there.

7595
04:00:49,590 --> 04:00:50,650
Yeah, good idea.

7596
04:00:50,670 --> 04:00:51,430
Good point.

7597
04:00:51,590 --> 04:00:53,650
Alright, I'm gonna go to the Anubis base.

7598
04:00:54,950 --> 04:00:56,290
Okay, Anubis is back up.

7599
04:00:56,730 --> 04:00:57,130
Nice.

7600
04:00:57,870 --> 04:00:58,270
Scary.

7601
04:00:58,430 --> 04:00:58,890
I'm gonna go.

7602
04:00:59,810 --> 04:01:03,450
Wait, I forget what element Earth is weak to.

7603
04:01:03,610 --> 04:01:04,830
What do I need for the thing?

7604
04:01:05,650 --> 04:01:05,870
Let's see.

7605
04:01:07,270 --> 04:01:08,630
How much time do we have left?

7606
04:01:08,730 --> 04:01:10,270
We have 17 minutes.

7607
04:01:10,710 --> 04:01:13,570
Do you think we could do the tower 3 together or no?

7608
04:01:14,690 --> 04:01:15,090
Probably.

7609
04:01:15,870 --> 04:01:16,270
Probably.

7610
04:01:18,090 --> 04:01:19,930
How much more points do we get for that?

7611
04:01:20,030 --> 04:01:20,650
Power is 3.

7612
04:01:20,670 --> 04:01:22,030
3 is...

7613
04:01:24,270 --> 04:01:25,610
That's 150 points.

7614
04:01:26,570 --> 04:01:27,090
Okay.

7615
04:01:27,230 --> 04:01:28,890
I can do that after I kill Anubis.

7616
04:01:29,130 --> 04:01:29,170
No.

7617
04:01:29,470 --> 04:01:32,130
I need to figure out... well, I need to kill this one too.

7618
04:01:32,210 --> 04:01:34,090
This other... the fucking...

7619
04:01:34,670 --> 04:01:36,410
Where the fuck is this boss?

7620
04:01:36,830 --> 04:01:37,930
Is it on the other island?

7621
04:01:38,310 --> 04:01:40,310
Guys, where's the boton?

7622
04:01:40,390 --> 04:01:41,270
Is it on the other island?

7623
04:01:41,650 --> 04:01:43,310
It's on the other fucking island.

7624
04:01:44,110 --> 04:01:44,890
Oh no.

7625
04:01:49,410 --> 04:01:49,930
What?

7626
04:01:50,350 --> 04:01:51,530
Are you level 50 yet?

7627
04:01:51,610 --> 04:01:52,010
No.

7628
04:01:52,910 --> 04:01:55,190
If I kill some more bosses, I probably will be.

7629
04:01:55,210 --> 04:01:55,430
Okay.

7630
04:01:55,570 --> 04:01:56,930
I don't think I get levels from the...

7631
04:01:56,930 --> 04:01:57,190
What?

7632
04:01:57,290 --> 04:01:59,650
You get levels from the tower bosses?

7633
04:02:00,230 --> 04:02:00,630
Yeah.

7634
04:02:00,730 --> 04:02:01,110
You do.

7635
04:02:01,910 --> 04:02:02,310
Okay.

7636
04:02:08,360 --> 04:02:09,560
Building the holding pen.

7637
04:02:10,040 --> 04:02:11,220
Should be close now.

7638
04:02:11,940 --> 04:02:13,620
I'll put in as many humans as I can.

7639
04:02:14,300 --> 04:02:15,620
Lily, do you have humans on you?

7640
04:02:17,100 --> 04:02:19,220
I have a ton in my box.

7641
04:02:19,220 --> 04:02:19,460
Yeah, yeah.

7642
04:02:19,460 --> 04:02:20,660
Can you go to where...

7643
04:02:21,840 --> 04:02:24,180
Go to where Peepee is and then put some humans in there?

7644
04:02:24,300 --> 04:02:24,800
Because we need 20.

7645
04:02:28,550 --> 04:02:31,910
Let me just on my way catch this Lupemon.

7646
04:02:32,450 --> 04:02:33,450
Wait, I think I already have one.

7647
04:02:33,710 --> 04:02:35,230
They're all just fucking passed out.

7648
04:02:37,190 --> 04:02:37,470
Uhhhh...

7649
04:02:38,010 --> 04:02:40,170
I don't think I can do anything to them while it's nighttime.

7650
04:02:40,350 --> 04:02:41,570
But we can just throw them all on the ground.

7651
04:02:41,730 --> 04:02:42,370
And that should be good enough.

7652
04:02:43,730 --> 04:02:45,290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

7653
04:02:46,190 --> 04:02:47,530
Wait, we can only put 15.

7654
04:02:47,750 --> 04:02:49,090
How are we supposed to put 20 of them in there?

7655
04:02:49,090 --> 04:02:49,410
Wait, what?

7656
04:02:51,990 --> 04:02:52,850
Clip Clip Clip!

7657
04:02:52,990 --> 04:02:54,990
Clip Clip Clip!

7658
04:02:55,250 --> 04:02:56,990
Oh, you put them here!

7659
04:02:57,490 --> 04:02:58,010
Okay, wait.

7660
04:02:58,130 --> 04:02:58,650
Yeah, nevermind.

7661
04:02:58,710 --> 04:02:58,950
We're good.

7662
04:02:59,010 --> 04:02:59,250
We're good.

7663
04:03:01,130 --> 04:03:02,150
They'll just fall in.

7664
04:03:03,290 --> 04:03:04,010
Clip Clip Clip!

7665
04:03:04,030 --> 04:03:05,070
Peepee mod Anubis!

7666
04:03:06,030 --> 04:03:06,510
That's wild.

7667
04:03:06,670 --> 04:03:09,890
Are you able to get to that dungeon place?

7668
04:03:10,110 --> 04:03:11,450
Because I can just TP there and do it.

7669
04:03:11,750 --> 04:03:12,650
What, tower 3?

7670
04:03:13,750 --> 04:03:14,550
Yeah, the tower.

7671
04:03:14,570 --> 04:03:15,990
I don't know where tower 3 is though.

7672
04:03:16,090 --> 04:03:16,350
Oh, wait.

7673
04:03:16,390 --> 04:03:16,610
Sure.

7674
04:03:16,710 --> 04:03:18,450
Do you have any humans you can put in this box?

7675
04:03:18,650 --> 04:03:19,910
Since you're right behind me anyway.

7676
04:03:21,710 --> 04:03:22,890
Yeah, just put them in there.

7677
04:03:23,310 --> 04:03:25,090
How many more do you guys need for 20?

7678
04:03:25,430 --> 04:03:29,090
Right now, we only have 6, 7, 8, 9.

7679
04:03:29,330 --> 04:03:29,970
We've got 9 people in here.

7680
04:03:29,970 --> 04:03:31,450
I have 8 on me.

7681
04:03:31,550 --> 04:03:32,730
I just want any of the killed...

7682
04:03:32,730 --> 04:03:32,930
Oh, sorry.

7683
04:03:32,990 --> 04:03:33,430
We've got 10.

7684
04:03:34,250 --> 04:03:35,870
Okay, I have 8 on me.

7685
04:03:35,950 --> 04:03:37,130
But I want to kill this one.

7686
04:03:37,530 --> 04:03:38,150
Oh my goodness!

7687
04:03:38,530 --> 04:03:40,010
I might just go to the tower then.

7688
04:03:40,190 --> 04:03:40,910
Yeah, you go to the tower.

7689
04:03:41,170 --> 04:03:42,390
I'm gonna do...

7690
04:03:42,870 --> 04:03:45,430
I'm trying to find the fucking last boss here.

7691
04:03:45,550 --> 04:03:46,090
For medium.

7692
04:03:47,030 --> 04:03:48,910
Well, we'll leave our 10 humans in there for right now.

7693
04:03:49,650 --> 04:03:50,250
It's right here.

7694
04:03:50,370 --> 04:03:50,650
Okay.

7695
04:03:52,030 --> 04:03:55,690
Yeah, whoever puts the last human in, just clip it.

7696
04:03:55,890 --> 04:03:56,170
Okay.

7697
04:03:56,470 --> 04:03:57,210
It'll be me.

7698
04:03:57,590 --> 04:03:59,150
Wait, where you at?

7699
04:03:59,290 --> 04:03:59,830
I don't see you.

7700
04:03:59,850 --> 04:04:00,730
I'm at the Anubis space.

7701
04:04:01,490 --> 04:04:02,950
The fuck is the last guy?

7702
04:04:03,270 --> 04:04:05,070
Why doesn't that show where you are?

7703
04:04:05,210 --> 04:04:05,790
That's so weird.

7704
04:04:06,130 --> 04:04:07,530
Oh, because I'm bugged right now.

7705
04:04:08,130 --> 04:04:08,490
Oh.

7706
04:04:09,210 --> 04:04:10,450
Yeah, come to the Anubis space.

7707
04:04:10,610 --> 04:04:12,250
And then don't use the pail box.

7708
04:04:12,370 --> 04:04:13,890
Use the actual cage.

7709
04:04:14,170 --> 04:04:15,270
Just come over and press X.

7710
04:04:15,350 --> 04:04:16,110
And you can put him in there.

7711
04:04:16,110 --> 04:04:16,950
Oh, there he is.

7712
04:04:17,090 --> 04:04:17,310
Okay.

7713
04:04:18,090 --> 04:04:20,470
Alright, I'm gonna go kill Botan.

7714
04:04:21,450 --> 04:04:21,870
One.

7715
04:04:22,750 --> 04:04:23,170
Two.

7716
04:04:23,770 --> 04:04:25,390
I keep thinking you're talking about Yu Yu Hakusho.

7717
04:04:25,590 --> 04:04:26,510
Every time you say it.

7718
04:04:27,410 --> 04:04:27,830
Alright.

7719
04:04:29,550 --> 04:04:30,390
Holy shit.

7720
04:04:30,530 --> 04:04:31,010
Oh, dang.

7721
04:04:31,110 --> 04:04:32,210
That's some cute humans.

7722
04:04:33,430 --> 04:04:34,290
What number are we at now?

7723
04:04:35,710 --> 04:04:36,610
I can't see.

7724
04:04:36,690 --> 04:04:37,790
It's kinda buggy for me.

7725
04:04:38,030 --> 04:04:39,910
It doesn't really show it.

7726
04:04:39,970 --> 04:04:40,950
There's a raid up here.

7727
04:04:41,410 --> 04:04:41,830
Wait.

7728
04:04:42,070 --> 04:04:42,590
12, 13.

7729
04:04:42,730 --> 04:04:43,130
Wait, wait, wait.

7730
04:04:43,730 --> 04:04:44,570
12, 13.

7731
04:04:44,970 --> 04:04:45,890
14, 15.

7732
04:04:46,110 --> 04:04:46,890
16, 17.

7733
04:04:47,210 --> 04:04:48,590
We still need three more.

7734
04:04:50,710 --> 04:04:52,910
At the 10 minute mark, we have to butcher the chickens.

7735
04:04:53,670 --> 04:04:54,030
Okay.

7736
04:04:57,150 --> 04:04:57,510
Wait.

7737
04:04:57,550 --> 04:04:57,950
Wait a minute.

7738
04:04:58,050 --> 04:04:59,070
6, 12.

7739
04:04:59,070 --> 04:05:01,350
We need four more pails to get 40 caught.

7740
04:05:01,430 --> 04:05:03,290
Yeah, we need three more humans.

7741
04:05:03,430 --> 04:05:04,330
I killed Lily already.

7742
04:05:04,490 --> 04:05:04,910
I already did it.

7743
04:05:06,010 --> 04:05:06,730
That's tower two.

7744
04:05:08,370 --> 04:05:09,570
Wait, where the fuck's tower three?

7745
04:05:09,610 --> 04:05:10,490
Tower three is a volcano.

7746
04:05:11,230 --> 04:05:12,170
I'm gonna leave here.

7747
04:05:12,350 --> 04:05:13,310
I don't wanna fight these people.

7748
04:05:13,310 --> 04:05:13,610
I'm gonna die.

7749
04:05:14,830 --> 04:05:15,950
I guess so.

7750
04:05:17,450 --> 04:05:18,730
Yeah, tower two was Lily.

7751
04:05:19,570 --> 04:05:20,050
Okay.

7752
04:05:20,110 --> 04:05:21,650
We need three more humans and we're good.

7753
04:05:21,790 --> 04:05:22,370
Okay, yeah.

7754
04:05:22,430 --> 04:05:22,790
I have three.

7755
04:05:22,870 --> 04:05:23,310
That's fine.

7756
04:05:23,370 --> 04:05:24,110
I'll head over there.

7757
04:05:25,030 --> 04:05:25,990
It's being raided.

7758
04:05:26,130 --> 04:05:26,990
I just kinda left.

7759
04:05:27,530 --> 04:05:28,010
Wait.

7760
04:05:28,070 --> 04:05:30,730
If it's raided, then they could destroy the human pen.

7761
04:05:30,970 --> 04:05:31,410
Oh.

7762
04:05:31,550 --> 04:05:33,110
Well, I can't fight all of them.

7763
04:05:33,370 --> 04:05:34,070
Oh no.

7764
04:05:34,530 --> 04:05:35,010
Okay.

7765
04:05:36,310 --> 04:05:37,650
I'm almost done.

7766
04:05:37,930 --> 04:05:38,730
A little pause.

7767
04:05:39,110 --> 04:05:39,990
Oh no.

7768
04:05:39,990 --> 04:05:40,230
Oh no.

7769
04:05:42,570 --> 04:05:43,350
Oh no.

7770
04:05:44,530 --> 04:05:47,510
I saw maybe if I left, they just wouldn't be interested in you.

7771
04:05:47,710 --> 04:05:48,150
Let's go!

7772
04:05:48,190 --> 04:05:48,610
Catch it!

7773
04:05:48,610 --> 04:05:48,950
Catch it!

7774
04:05:49,030 --> 04:05:49,030
Catch it!

7775
04:05:50,590 --> 04:05:51,750
So the four...

7776
04:05:51,750 --> 04:05:52,350
Oh my goodness.

7777
04:05:52,530 --> 04:05:56,290
That's a hundred points if you catch it.

7778
04:05:56,350 --> 04:05:57,250
I can't defend the base.

7779
04:05:57,310 --> 04:05:58,290
They're destroying the pail box.

7780
04:05:58,590 --> 04:06:00,390
I don't really know what to do.

7781
04:06:00,470 --> 04:06:01,830
There's like literally 20 of them.

7782
04:06:01,950 --> 04:06:03,610
If you just leave, they don't attack.

7783
04:06:03,770 --> 04:06:04,370
Yeah, just leave.

7784
04:06:04,430 --> 04:06:04,790
Just leave.

7785
04:06:05,210 --> 04:06:06,030
I got it!

7786
04:06:06,650 --> 04:06:07,050
Let's go!

7787
04:06:07,170 --> 04:06:07,570
Clip!

7788
04:06:07,570 --> 04:06:07,650
Clip!

7789
04:06:07,710 --> 04:06:08,030
Clip!

7790
04:06:08,030 --> 04:06:08,110
Clip!

7791
04:06:08,110 --> 04:06:08,470
Clip!

7792
04:06:08,790 --> 04:06:09,170
Clip!

7793
04:06:09,450 --> 04:06:09,670
Clip!

7794
04:06:09,670 --> 04:06:10,050
Clip!

7795
04:06:10,050 --> 04:06:10,410
Clip!

7796
04:06:10,410 --> 04:06:10,670
Clip!

7797
04:06:10,690 --> 04:06:11,070
Clip!

7798
04:06:13,410 --> 04:06:14,270
They're chasing me.

7799
04:06:18,290 --> 04:06:19,490
Just teleport away.

7800
04:06:20,550 --> 04:06:24,210
I got too far away from the pail box, so I'm just gonna fly away now.

7801
04:06:24,670 --> 04:06:24,830
Ah!

7802
04:06:25,050 --> 04:06:25,430
Fuck!

7803
04:06:25,510 --> 04:06:26,170
Alright, I'm dead.

7804
04:06:26,290 --> 04:06:26,950
Well, you know what?

7805
04:06:26,950 --> 04:06:27,170
It's fine.

7806
04:06:28,230 --> 04:06:28,610
Clip!

7807
04:06:28,610 --> 04:06:28,710
Clip!

7808
04:06:28,730 --> 04:06:28,870
Clip!

7809
04:06:28,870 --> 04:06:29,410
I got Botan!

7810
04:06:29,550 --> 04:06:29,770
Clip!

7811
04:06:29,850 --> 04:06:29,910
Clip!

7812
04:06:29,950 --> 04:06:30,130
Clip!

7813
04:06:31,050 --> 04:06:32,130
I got Botan!

7814
04:06:32,270 --> 04:06:32,510
Clip!

7815
04:06:37,680 --> 04:06:38,060
Alright.

7816
04:06:40,320 --> 04:06:40,700
Okay.

7817
04:06:40,840 --> 04:06:42,540
They all left our base, it looks like.

7818
04:06:42,740 --> 04:06:44,500
I'm gonna head over and put the...

7819
04:06:44,500 --> 04:06:46,400
I need to find a fast travel.

7820
04:06:46,520 --> 04:06:47,860
Yeah, I need to find a fast travel right now.

7821
04:06:48,080 --> 04:06:48,480
Awesome!

7822
04:06:48,900 --> 04:06:49,860
And then I can do it.

7823
04:06:50,040 --> 04:06:51,220
Yeah, and then just clip it while you're there.

7824
04:06:53,840 --> 04:06:54,640
Let's see...

7825
04:06:54,640 --> 04:06:55,320
Stupid!

7826
04:06:56,060 --> 04:06:56,460
Brr!

7827
04:06:57,220 --> 04:06:57,620
Brr!

7828
04:06:57,820 --> 04:06:58,220
Brr!

7829
04:07:00,020 --> 04:07:00,420
Alright.

7830
04:07:00,420 --> 04:07:01,240
Submit already!

7831
04:07:01,580 --> 04:07:02,280
Be caught!

7832
04:07:04,000 --> 04:07:06,600
Are you still catching the lucky pow or just regular pow?

7833
04:07:06,700 --> 04:07:07,800
I got the lucky pow.

7834
04:07:07,860 --> 04:07:08,260
Okay.

7835
04:07:08,260 --> 04:07:09,800
I was gonna be like, oh no.

7836
04:07:10,840 --> 04:07:11,000
No, no.

7837
04:07:11,020 --> 04:07:13,260
PP Mod is clipping and submitting my stuff.

7838
04:07:13,500 --> 04:07:14,000
I think so.

7839
04:07:14,160 --> 04:07:15,540
PP Mod submitted mine too!

7840
04:07:16,580 --> 04:07:17,920
Thank you, PP Mods!

7841
04:07:18,560 --> 04:07:19,600
We're in fourth place!

7842
04:07:20,200 --> 04:07:22,220
I know where that last dungeon is.

7843
04:07:22,400 --> 04:07:23,060
I'm pretty sure.

7844
04:07:23,360 --> 04:07:25,440
Do we think we can get it done in ten minutes?

7845
04:07:26,980 --> 04:07:29,440
If you can find the dungeon and build the base in time.

7846
04:07:29,460 --> 04:07:29,980
I know where it is.

7847
04:07:30,060 --> 04:07:30,560
I'm pretty sure.

7848
04:07:32,660 --> 04:07:34,100
How many points is that dungeon?

7849
04:07:34,400 --> 04:07:35,700
That dungeon is...

7850
04:07:37,360 --> 04:07:37,760
880.

7851
04:07:39,400 --> 04:07:40,000
880 points.

7852
04:07:40,120 --> 04:07:40,520
180.

7853
04:07:40,720 --> 04:07:41,100
180.

7854
04:07:41,900 --> 04:07:42,560
Oh, never mind.

7855
04:07:42,600 --> 04:07:44,040
It's blocked off where it usually...

7856
04:07:44,040 --> 04:07:44,920
I think it is.

7857
04:07:47,080 --> 04:07:47,640
False alarm.

7858
04:07:48,640 --> 04:07:49,040
Alright.

7859
04:07:49,140 --> 04:07:51,060
I am heading back right now.

7860
04:07:51,520 --> 04:07:53,900
It's the ten minute mark so we should...

7861
04:07:53,900 --> 04:07:55,560
Why are you doing tower three right now, Shurfer?

7862
04:07:55,760 --> 04:07:56,540
What are you doing?

7863
04:07:56,760 --> 04:07:57,820
Well, I have to go get to it.

7864
04:07:57,900 --> 04:08:00,620
I'm either gonna do tower three or the other bosses.

7865
04:08:00,620 --> 04:08:01,480
Which is better points?

7866
04:08:02,200 --> 04:08:04,160
Well, bosses is like 70 and 65.

7867
04:08:04,360 --> 04:08:07,200
Tower three is a hundred and... Oh my gosh.

7868
04:08:07,260 --> 04:08:07,660
I don't wanna...

7869
04:08:07,760 --> 04:08:08,840
I'm trying to hit...

7870
04:08:09,680 --> 04:08:10,560
It's 150.

7871
04:08:13,080 --> 04:08:15,940
But the thing is, if I kill the bosses, I know I get level ups.

7872
04:08:16,000 --> 04:08:18,620
But you're 100% sure you get XP from tower bosses?

7873
04:08:19,760 --> 04:08:21,860
I'm... Because I'm really close to 50.

7874
04:08:22,340 --> 04:08:23,740
Well, if it's faster to do...

7875
04:08:23,740 --> 04:08:25,420
Level 50 pal is 120 points.

7876
04:08:26,260 --> 04:08:27,960
Then do the hard bosses then.

7877
04:08:28,080 --> 04:08:29,220
Because then you can...

7878
04:08:29,700 --> 04:08:30,780
Yeah, just do the hard bosses.

7879
04:08:31,600 --> 04:08:34,480
I'm gonna head over back now and put the human...

7880
04:08:36,280 --> 04:08:37,680
Okay, I'm taking a look at my list.

7881
04:08:38,500 --> 04:08:38,900
Uhh...

7882
04:08:38,900 --> 04:08:40,500
Forget what the tower even is.

7883
04:08:40,620 --> 04:08:41,740
Let me see what I can do.

7884
04:08:42,640 --> 04:08:43,640
Yeah, just do bosses.

7885
04:08:44,420 --> 04:08:46,700
I'm gonna head over and trying to get to the base.

7886
04:08:47,360 --> 04:08:49,040
Oh no, my Van Worm's starving.

7887
04:08:49,400 --> 04:08:49,660
Fuck.

7888
04:08:51,300 --> 04:08:52,480
Okay, I think...

7889
04:08:55,100 --> 04:08:56,520
Yeah, let me check my registered Pokemon.

7890
04:08:56,760 --> 04:08:58,780
Do you guys have food at the base?

7891
04:08:58,860 --> 04:08:59,820
Because I really need food.

7892
04:09:00,260 --> 04:09:02,400
We need 200 more points for third place.

7893
04:09:04,700 --> 04:09:06,180
Well, we're gonna get some...

7894
04:09:06,180 --> 04:09:07,280
Here, check the cooler.

7895
04:09:07,760 --> 04:09:08,720
We're just gonna put a bunch of food in there.

7896
04:09:08,780 --> 04:09:15,280
We're about to hit a bunch of free points from me hitting 50, butchering the chickpeas, and human food.

7897
04:09:16,140 --> 04:09:18,040
Okay, I am heading...

7898
04:09:18,040 --> 04:09:18,820
Which base?

7899
04:09:19,940 --> 04:09:21,400
Cooler, normal base, but...

7900
04:09:21,400 --> 04:09:23,060
Yeah, I'm putting humans.

7901
04:09:23,540 --> 04:09:24,800
How do I put the humans in?

7902
04:09:25,340 --> 04:09:26,680
You walk up to it and hit X.

7903
04:09:26,800 --> 04:09:28,420
Okay, umm...

7904
04:09:30,620 --> 04:09:32,100
How many do they need?

7905
04:09:32,700 --> 04:09:33,500
1, 2, 3...

7906
04:09:33,500 --> 04:09:35,260
I'm so close to my 40 pal's, man.

7907
04:09:35,260 --> 04:09:36,840
Okay, I'm putting more than 3.

7908
04:09:37,220 --> 04:09:38,340
They're all gonna be in there.

7909
04:09:39,540 --> 04:09:40,240
Clip, clip, clip!

7910
04:09:40,560 --> 04:09:41,220
Clip, clip, clip!

7911
04:09:41,880 --> 04:09:43,700
There's definitely more than 20 now!

7912
04:09:44,960 --> 04:09:45,640
Clip, clip, clip!

7913
04:09:46,440 --> 04:09:47,120
On my end!

7914
04:09:47,200 --> 04:09:47,780
Clip, clip, clip!

7915
04:09:48,540 --> 04:09:49,180
Viewing cage!

7916
04:09:49,440 --> 04:09:51,940
My team is starving.

7917
04:09:54,320 --> 04:09:54,680
Alright.

7918
04:09:54,800 --> 04:09:55,580
We're so hungry.

7919
04:09:57,280 --> 04:09:59,340
I'm too busy clipping, but they're so hungry.

7920
04:09:59,700 --> 04:10:03,000
Let me see LiftMonks if I can get anything on that, but I don't think so.

7921
04:10:03,100 --> 04:10:05,180
Sure, you can be back by 3 minutes if you can.

7922
04:10:05,260 --> 04:10:06,580
So we can do the chickpea.

7923
04:10:07,160 --> 04:10:07,980
How much time we got?

7924
04:10:08,160 --> 04:10:10,440
Well, I just died to like a bug or some shit, so I'm here.

7925
04:10:10,620 --> 04:10:11,980
Oh, okay, let's do chickpea now.

7926
04:10:12,700 --> 04:10:13,060
Okay.

7927
04:10:13,720 --> 04:10:14,600
I need the butcher knife.

7928
04:10:15,720 --> 04:10:16,860
Wait, what is LiftMonk?

7929
04:10:16,940 --> 04:10:20,620
I really need to get back and fucking try and get that shit back.

7930
04:10:20,620 --> 04:10:21,680
Nah, there's no way I'm gonna get that.

7931
04:10:21,680 --> 04:10:23,360
Okay, okay, let's get the... I'm getting the butcher knife.

7932
04:10:23,460 --> 04:10:26,420
Give me the butcher knife real quick and then I'll do it.

7933
04:10:26,460 --> 04:10:27,500
I can make butcher knives.

7934
04:10:28,000 --> 04:10:31,320
Yeah, just give me one, I'll do it real quick, and then I need to try and kill that boss.

7935
04:10:31,580 --> 04:10:31,920
Okay.

7936
04:10:32,040 --> 04:10:33,280
I'll make four butcher knives.

7937
04:10:35,260 --> 04:10:35,960
I'll make one so that one has to be free.

7938
04:10:35,960 --> 04:10:38,500
I'm getting the chicken in my pal box right now.

7939
04:10:40,780 --> 04:10:41,780
I'm making two.

7940
04:10:42,820 --> 04:10:44,880
I have a chicken in my pal box.

7941
04:10:45,800 --> 04:10:46,600
Meat cleavers.

7942
04:10:46,600 --> 04:10:48,040
Do we have to do it all at the same time?

7943
04:10:48,100 --> 04:10:48,560
Let me see.

7944
04:10:50,520 --> 04:10:51,480
Where is it?

7945
04:10:51,560 --> 04:10:54,840
I think so.

7946
04:10:55,000 --> 04:10:56,240
We should all get together then.

7947
04:10:57,020 --> 04:10:57,420
Okay.

7948
04:10:57,420 --> 04:10:58,040
Meat cleaver.

7949
04:10:58,040 --> 04:10:59,200
We all have to do it at the same time.

7950
04:11:01,480 --> 04:11:02,280
In the...

7951
04:11:02,280 --> 04:11:04,460
The barrel?

7952
04:11:05,260 --> 04:11:07,420
I'm going to do this fast because I need to go get my shit.

7953
04:11:07,720 --> 04:11:08,760
Barrel, barrel, put in barrel.

7954
04:11:09,320 --> 04:11:10,360
I'm trying, I'm trying.

7955
04:11:10,700 --> 04:11:11,720
Okay, there we go.

7956
04:11:12,440 --> 04:11:12,900
Cleaver and barrel.

7957
04:11:14,780 --> 04:11:15,640
Someone get the other.

7958
04:11:16,740 --> 04:11:17,360
I'm going downstairs.

7959
04:11:18,360 --> 04:11:19,500
Let's all go downstairs when you're ready.

7960
04:11:22,640 --> 04:11:23,220
Cleaver and barrel.

7961
04:11:23,320 --> 04:11:24,040
I'm trying to...

7962
04:11:25,220 --> 04:11:26,440
Let me know when you guys are ready.

7963
04:11:26,740 --> 04:11:27,660
I gotta get a chicken.

7964
04:11:28,600 --> 04:11:30,780
Can I have your fire armor after this?

7965
04:11:31,040 --> 04:11:32,120
Yeah, I can give you my fire armor.

7966
04:11:32,120 --> 04:11:32,600
Fire armor, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7967
04:11:34,040 --> 04:11:34,860
Okay, I got a chicken.

7968
04:11:34,860 --> 04:11:35,660
How do I cleave them?

7969
04:11:35,880 --> 04:11:36,880
Put it in your inventory.

7970
04:11:37,060 --> 04:11:39,600
And then four in butcher.

7971
04:11:41,920 --> 04:11:42,640
Yeah, ready?

7972
04:11:43,620 --> 04:11:45,880
Wait, I have it in my inventory but I don't have a butcher option.

7973
04:11:45,880 --> 04:11:46,500
You have to be holding it.

7974
04:11:46,740 --> 04:11:47,860
Yeah, hold it, hold it.

7975
04:11:49,220 --> 04:11:50,220
Wait, hold it?

7976
04:11:50,320 --> 04:11:51,360
I can't hold it.

7977
04:11:51,580 --> 04:11:53,720
You drag the butcher knife into your weapon.

7978
04:11:54,840 --> 04:11:56,320
Put it in your weapon slot.

7979
04:11:56,440 --> 04:11:57,640
Time is of the essence.

7980
04:11:57,760 --> 04:11:58,820
I need to get level 50.

7981
04:11:59,540 --> 04:12:00,700
Put it in the weapon slot.

7982
04:12:02,460 --> 04:12:03,240
What do you mean?

7983
04:12:03,360 --> 04:12:04,640
You just dragged it there.

7984
04:12:04,880 --> 04:12:07,160
Take away one of the items.

7985
04:12:07,880 --> 04:12:09,100
You guys are bugged.

7986
04:12:09,320 --> 04:12:10,780
Give me your armor.

7987
04:12:11,160 --> 04:12:11,920
Yeah, I'm bugged.

7988
04:12:12,000 --> 04:12:12,900
Okay, I guess we're...

7989
04:12:14,020 --> 04:12:15,200
They're bugged or some shit.

7990
04:12:15,520 --> 04:12:17,700
Guess we're not butchering the chicken.

7991
04:12:17,880 --> 04:12:18,660
You guys are bugged.

7992
04:12:18,840 --> 04:12:20,780
You have to re-log.

7993
04:12:21,000 --> 04:12:21,740
Just re-log.

7994
04:12:21,940 --> 04:12:23,000
And then surefour do his thing.

7995
04:12:23,340 --> 04:12:24,480
Just re-log, re-log.

7996
04:12:26,520 --> 04:12:30,380
There's no other way to explain it other than just put it in your weapon slot.

7997
04:12:30,500 --> 04:12:31,960
That's the only way we can win.

7998
04:12:32,120 --> 04:12:33,360
That's literally all you do.

7999
04:12:33,780 --> 04:12:34,740
What do you mean?

8000
04:12:34,780 --> 04:12:35,880
We're your pickaxe?

8001
04:12:36,120 --> 04:12:37,880
You're literally bugged.

8002
04:12:37,880 --> 04:12:38,980
You're literally bugged.

8003
04:12:38,980 --> 04:12:40,120
You have to re-log.

8004
04:12:40,900 --> 04:12:41,780
Okay, I'm joining.

8005
04:12:42,920 --> 04:12:44,640
We catch your four ready left.

8006
04:12:45,080 --> 04:12:45,980
What the fuck?

8007
04:12:47,480 --> 04:12:49,300
You guys are taking two damn logs.

8008
04:12:49,660 --> 04:12:52,360
He can get like four achievements done right now.

8009
04:12:52,460 --> 04:12:54,420
So we're letting him do his thing.

8010
04:12:54,460 --> 04:12:56,600
Wheel the knife, drag it over your pickaxe.

8011
04:12:56,680 --> 04:12:57,100
I'm drunk.

8012
04:12:58,120 --> 04:12:59,940
Just throw your pickaxe away.

8013
04:12:59,940 --> 04:13:01,660
You have to re-log at the same time?

8014
04:13:01,680 --> 04:13:02,200
Yes, it does.

8015
04:13:02,320 --> 04:13:02,460
Yeah.

8016
04:13:02,760 --> 04:13:04,180
The screenshot is all four of them.

8017
04:13:04,800 --> 04:13:05,600
It's working now.

8018
04:13:07,740 --> 04:13:08,740
Just re-log.

8019
04:13:10,260 --> 04:13:11,740
You guys just have to wait a bit.

8020
04:13:11,840 --> 04:13:12,720
You have to wait for it.

8021
04:13:12,800 --> 04:13:14,680
I'm going to upgrade.

8022
04:13:15,020 --> 04:13:17,660
Go get the human thing while I'm...

8023
04:13:17,660 --> 04:13:18,000
I did.

8024
04:13:18,020 --> 04:13:18,700
I did the human already.

8025
04:13:19,040 --> 04:13:19,640
How did you make it work?

8026
04:13:20,080 --> 04:13:21,060
I just re-logged.

8027
04:13:22,080 --> 04:13:22,820
Just re-log.

8028
04:13:24,980 --> 04:13:27,360
You still haven't re-logged?

8029
04:13:27,360 --> 04:13:28,160
What do you mean?

8030
04:13:28,160 --> 04:13:29,360
Put it in your weapon slot.

8031
04:13:29,680 --> 04:13:30,520
Re-log!

8032
04:13:31,480 --> 04:13:31,880
I did!

8033
04:13:32,960 --> 04:13:33,480
I did!

8034
04:13:35,560 --> 04:13:36,220
I'm here!

8035
04:13:36,340 --> 04:13:36,380
What do I do?

8036
04:13:37,460 --> 04:13:41,340
The slot you're holding the crossbow in, just drag the butcher knife in there instead.

8037
04:13:42,740 --> 04:13:43,140
Oh.

8038
04:13:43,700 --> 04:13:44,700
Oh my god.

8039
04:13:44,740 --> 04:13:45,660
What do you mean, oh?

8040
04:13:48,240 --> 04:13:49,040
No shot.

8041
04:13:50,000 --> 04:13:50,940
We gotta wait.

8042
04:13:51,100 --> 04:13:53,420
We're just waiting for sure for him to do his thing.

8043
04:13:53,420 --> 04:13:53,440
I have it.

8044
04:13:53,540 --> 04:13:53,920
I have it.

8045
04:13:54,020 --> 04:13:54,820
I got the butcher.

8046
04:13:54,960 --> 04:13:55,340
I got it.

8047
04:13:57,360 --> 04:13:58,420
I have it.

8048
04:13:58,420 --> 04:14:00,660
I have it.

8049
04:14:00,940 --> 04:14:04,100
Is there no way I have to catch pals to register?

8050
04:14:04,240 --> 04:14:05,200
You can't drop at all?

8051
04:14:05,360 --> 04:14:06,860
I'm missing two pals, man.

8052
04:14:06,960 --> 04:14:07,400
Two.

8053
04:14:09,060 --> 04:14:10,160
Okay, wait, I've got it.

8054
04:14:10,200 --> 04:14:10,440
It's there.

8055
04:14:10,480 --> 04:14:11,840
It's not working anymore.

8056
04:14:11,920 --> 04:14:12,560
I got it.

8057
04:14:12,780 --> 04:14:13,380
I got it.

8058
04:14:13,860 --> 04:14:15,920
I have also a pp mod.

8059
04:14:16,560 --> 04:14:17,620
Yeah, pp mod.

8060
04:14:17,700 --> 04:14:18,460
Clip, clip, clip.

8061
04:14:18,460 --> 04:14:20,520
I have 355 registered.

8062
04:14:20,760 --> 04:14:21,300
Clip, clip, clip.

8063
04:14:21,540 --> 04:14:23,100
I have 55 registered.

8064
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:24,620
I get what you mean now.

8065
04:14:24,660 --> 04:14:26,540
I was trying to put it in my actual...

8066
04:14:27,360 --> 04:14:27,980
I meant the butcher knife.

8067
04:14:28,020 --> 04:14:30,360
I was trying to put the chicken in my fucking weapon slot.

8068
04:14:30,500 --> 04:14:33,440
No fucking way you're thinking that, Brenn.

8069
04:14:33,500 --> 04:14:33,940
What?

8070
04:14:34,680 --> 04:14:35,120
What?

8071
04:14:36,200 --> 04:14:38,420
How the fuck do you put him in the weapon slot?

8072
04:14:38,700 --> 04:14:39,600
Okay, okay.

8073
04:14:39,760 --> 04:14:40,320
We just wait.

8074
04:14:40,380 --> 04:14:41,380
We just wait.

8075
04:14:41,560 --> 04:14:42,820
He's just gonna do his thing.

8076
04:14:43,200 --> 04:14:43,720
Pp mod.

8077
04:14:43,860 --> 04:14:44,420
Clip my...

8078
04:14:44,420 --> 04:14:45,340
Clip, clip, clip.

8079
04:14:45,740 --> 04:14:46,180
Registered.

8080
04:14:46,260 --> 04:14:46,700
55.

8081
04:14:47,760 --> 04:14:48,480
Clip, clip, clip.

8082
04:14:48,900 --> 04:14:50,020
If I steal...

8083
04:14:53,520 --> 04:14:54,400
Holy shit.

8084
04:14:54,600 --> 04:14:56,980
Can you make another butcher knife in case I die again?

8085
04:14:56,980 --> 04:14:57,520
Yeah, yeah.

8086
04:14:57,520 --> 04:14:58,780
We have three minutes here for it.

8087
04:14:58,780 --> 04:15:01,220
Do you think you can get through it in three minutes?

8088
04:15:01,820 --> 04:15:02,240
Maybe.

8089
04:15:02,240 --> 04:15:04,060
Lily, how many pals do you have registered?

8090
04:15:04,700 --> 04:15:05,120
38.

8091
04:15:05,360 --> 04:15:06,020
I'm a thing to lose.

8092
04:15:06,020 --> 04:15:06,860
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

8093
04:15:07,500 --> 04:15:08,660
Lily, uh...

8094
04:15:09,120 --> 04:15:10,760
You should probably...

8095
04:15:10,760 --> 04:15:11,960
All you need is...

8096
04:15:12,960 --> 04:15:13,380
What?

8097
04:15:13,380 --> 04:15:14,060
Two more?

8098
04:15:14,760 --> 04:15:15,180
Two...

8099
04:15:15,180 --> 04:15:15,900
Take this money.

8100
04:15:15,980 --> 04:15:16,900
I'm gonna drop this money.

8101
04:15:18,240 --> 04:15:20,780
I'm gonna kill myself after I get this guy.

8102
04:15:20,940 --> 04:15:21,300
Okay.

8103
04:15:22,500 --> 04:15:25,060
I'm gonna make another butcher knife for you just in case.

8104
04:15:25,060 --> 04:15:26,380
He's in the cage.

8105
04:15:26,540 --> 04:15:27,760
I'm gonna need one if I'm killing myself.

8106
04:15:28,740 --> 04:15:29,460
But, yeah.

8107
04:15:31,780 --> 04:15:34,560
But if you can, go to the Anubis base and just buy two pals.

8108
04:15:34,800 --> 04:15:35,820
I'll manage, I'll manage, I'll manage.

8109
04:15:36,180 --> 04:15:37,720
Either that or go to the regular...

8110
04:15:37,720 --> 04:15:38,560
Go to the regular...

8111
04:15:38,560 --> 04:15:40,140
Actually, regular would be faster.

8112
04:15:40,240 --> 04:15:41,100
Just go to the regular village.

8113
04:15:41,320 --> 04:15:42,280
Alright, just go to the regular village.

8114
04:15:42,820 --> 04:15:43,180
Alright.

8115
04:15:43,580 --> 04:15:44,100
Doesn't matter.

8116
04:15:44,320 --> 04:15:45,360
There... Oh god.

8117
04:15:46,540 --> 04:15:46,900
Jesus.

8118
04:15:49,080 --> 04:15:51,020
Alright, I'm throwing pokeballs at him now.

8119
04:15:51,640 --> 04:15:52,000
Alright.

8120
04:15:52,500 --> 04:15:53,220
Two minutes.

8121
04:15:55,060 --> 04:15:55,880
I'm gonna get this sure for...

8122
04:15:55,880 --> 04:15:57,280
I believe in you.

8123
04:16:02,320 --> 04:16:02,680
Jesus.

8124
04:16:02,760 --> 04:16:03,700
No fucking shot.

8125
04:16:04,680 --> 04:16:05,320
Did you get it?

8126
04:16:06,200 --> 04:16:07,860
I don't think that sounds like something...

8127
04:16:07,860 --> 04:16:07,880
Last ball.

8128
04:16:10,160 --> 04:16:12,980
Oh, bullshit.

8129
04:16:13,120 --> 04:16:14,220
I guess I just have to kill him then.

8130
04:16:15,820 --> 04:16:16,620
Do we get...

8131
04:16:16,620 --> 04:16:17,800
We don't get points for killing him though.

8132
04:16:18,220 --> 04:16:18,760
We do.

8133
04:16:18,920 --> 04:16:19,320
Oh, we do?

8134
04:16:19,480 --> 04:16:19,700
Okay.

8135
04:16:20,500 --> 04:16:21,640
I mean, I think so.

8136
04:16:21,840 --> 04:16:23,180
I think they made a new rule for that.

8137
04:16:23,180 --> 04:16:24,500
I have enough money to buy everything!

8138
04:16:25,080 --> 04:16:25,360
Yay!

8139
04:16:26,700 --> 04:16:27,920
I don't have enough money.

8140
04:16:28,460 --> 04:16:29,280
I have money.

8141
04:16:29,320 --> 04:16:29,820
I can give her some.

8142
04:16:30,540 --> 04:16:31,520
Okay, go, go, go.

8143
04:16:31,560 --> 04:16:31,800
Drop money.

8144
04:16:32,420 --> 04:16:33,280
I'm going over there.

8145
04:16:34,660 --> 04:16:35,620
How do I sell...

8146
04:16:36,700 --> 04:16:38,160
How do I sell...

8147
04:16:38,160 --> 04:16:40,260
You guys need to show a pal that I got it.

8148
04:16:40,900 --> 04:16:41,460
It's right there.

8149
04:16:41,560 --> 04:16:41,900
It's right there.

8150
04:16:42,920 --> 04:16:43,720
What did he go?

8151
04:16:43,840 --> 04:16:44,580
I dropped it.

8152
04:16:44,620 --> 04:16:45,440
I dropped it in front of you.

8153
04:16:45,820 --> 04:16:46,920
Where is the mucketeer?

8154
04:16:48,300 --> 04:16:49,140
Right here in front of you.

8155
04:16:50,040 --> 04:16:50,860
Where's the butcher knife?

8156
04:16:50,960 --> 04:16:51,260
Right in front of you.

8157
04:16:51,500 --> 04:16:52,240
Okay, I'm coming over.

8158
04:16:52,300 --> 04:16:52,580
I'm coming over.

8159
04:16:53,180 --> 04:16:54,000
We have one minute.

8160
04:16:54,140 --> 04:16:55,060
I'm so close to level 50.

8161
04:16:55,140 --> 04:16:55,460
I'm ready to butcher.

8162
04:16:56,380 --> 04:16:57,260
Where's the knife?

8163
04:16:57,560 --> 04:16:58,320
I'm here.

8164
04:16:58,380 --> 04:16:58,540
I'm here.

8165
04:16:58,580 --> 04:16:59,480
I'm coming over to give it to you.

8166
04:16:59,540 --> 04:17:00,760
I have to travel back to...

8167
04:17:01,480 --> 04:17:02,040
Lily here.

8168
04:17:02,080 --> 04:17:02,480
One minute.

8169
04:17:02,540 --> 04:17:02,780
Let's go.

8170
04:17:03,280 --> 04:17:03,600
Alright.

8171
04:17:03,880 --> 04:17:04,400
Let's go.

8172
04:17:04,580 --> 04:17:04,860
Okay.

8173
04:17:05,000 --> 04:17:05,960
Lily, you gotta come back.

8174
04:17:06,220 --> 04:17:08,480
We gotta go downstairs and butcher this fucking chicken.

8175
04:17:09,000 --> 04:17:09,320
Finally.

8176
04:17:09,320 --> 04:17:10,060
Alright, I'm downstairs.

8177
04:17:10,180 --> 04:17:10,620
Let's go.

8178
04:17:10,740 --> 04:17:11,100
Let's go.

8179
04:17:11,120 --> 04:17:11,420
Let's go.

8180
04:17:11,780 --> 04:17:12,320
Alright, here we go.

8181
04:17:12,480 --> 04:17:14,100
3, 2, 1.

8182
04:17:14,820 --> 04:17:15,460
Go, butcher!

8183
04:17:16,240 --> 04:17:16,920
Clip, clip, clip!

8184
04:17:17,940 --> 04:17:18,860
Clip, clip, clip, clip!

8185
04:17:18,860 --> 04:17:19,020
Let's play!

8186
04:17:21,440 --> 04:17:22,780
Alright, there we go.

8187
04:17:23,000 --> 04:17:23,860
Alright, got it.

8188
04:17:23,940 --> 04:17:24,360
We got it.

8189
04:17:24,600 --> 04:17:25,580
Show your context.

8190
04:17:25,840 --> 04:17:26,420
It's right there.

8191
04:17:26,520 --> 04:17:27,740
Clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip.

8192
04:17:28,020 --> 04:17:29,140
Lily, show your context.

8193
04:17:29,140 --> 04:17:31,680
You have one minute to get to level 50.

8194
04:17:33,360 --> 04:17:33,780
Let's go.

8195
04:17:34,020 --> 04:17:34,720
40 registered.

8196
04:17:35,200 --> 04:17:35,580
Alright.

8197
04:17:36,020 --> 04:17:37,540
How the fuck am I gonna get to level 50?

8198
04:17:37,980 --> 04:17:40,620
What can you do in one minute or 30 seconds?

8199
04:17:41,220 --> 04:17:41,760
36 seconds.

8200
04:17:41,760 --> 04:17:43,000
I can kill a boss.

8201
04:17:43,500 --> 04:17:45,540
Okay, I don't think we can get that in 30 seconds.

8202
04:17:46,900 --> 04:17:49,240
I just need to kill like a semi-high level boss.

8203
04:17:49,480 --> 04:17:50,240
I don't think...

8204
04:17:50,240 --> 04:17:51,260
I need armor and shit.

8205
04:17:51,400 --> 04:17:53,260
He has 26 seconds here.

8206
04:17:53,320 --> 04:17:54,540
Here's some pelt armor.

8207
04:17:54,940 --> 04:17:55,780
Kill a noobist in 26 seconds.

8208
04:17:56,420 --> 04:17:57,800
I don't think he can.

8209
04:17:58,620 --> 04:18:04,460
Also, I don't think anybody got this, but check your lift monks as well.

8210
04:18:04,800 --> 04:18:05,560
No, but zero.

8211
04:18:05,660 --> 04:18:06,600
I don't think we got this.

8212
04:18:06,720 --> 04:18:07,600
Yeah, I have none.

8213
04:18:07,840 --> 04:18:09,820
I got to four, but not enough.

8214
04:18:10,160 --> 04:18:11,460
Shurper, did you show your pelt deck?

8215
04:18:13,500 --> 04:18:15,260
Uh... I'm trying to get level 50 first.

8216
04:18:15,320 --> 04:18:15,720
We still have time.

8217
04:18:15,720 --> 04:18:16,000
We still have the five minutes.

8218
04:18:16,040 --> 04:18:17,600
We still have the five minutes after we can do that.

8219
04:18:20,040 --> 04:18:20,480
I'm reporting.

8220
04:18:20,480 --> 04:18:21,200
Yeah, yeah.

8221
04:18:21,200 --> 04:18:21,780
Yeah, that's true.

8222
04:18:22,140 --> 04:18:23,280
You can report your pelt deck during that.

8223
04:18:23,740 --> 04:18:24,820
It's ding ding ding!

8224
04:18:25,540 --> 04:18:26,140
Your statue!

8225
04:18:26,340 --> 04:18:26,800
Your statue!

8226
04:18:27,140 --> 04:18:27,580
Ding ding ding!

8227
04:18:28,040 --> 04:18:29,200
Wait, actually, no, never mind.

8228
04:18:29,320 --> 04:18:29,860
Is it over?

8229
04:18:30,040 --> 04:18:30,600
It's over.

8230
04:18:30,600 --> 04:18:31,460
It's ding ding ding!

8231
04:18:31,820 --> 04:18:32,740
Ding ding ding!

8232
04:18:34,360 --> 04:18:36,400
We were so close to 50.

8233
04:18:36,780 --> 04:18:38,720
If only I had more balls, man!

8234
04:18:38,880 --> 04:18:39,760
I would have had it!

8235
04:18:40,720 --> 04:18:41,480
I'm sorry, man.

8236
04:18:41,680 --> 04:18:42,240
I'm sorry.

8237
04:18:42,280 --> 04:18:42,920
Check your pelt deck.

8238
04:18:43,040 --> 04:18:43,700
Pelt deck time.

8239
04:18:43,900 --> 04:18:44,660
I showed mine.

8240
04:18:45,000 --> 04:18:45,780
Show your deck.

8241
04:18:47,060 --> 04:18:47,880
Ding ding ding!

8242
04:18:48,040 --> 04:18:49,680
I already did before, but here.

8243
04:18:49,840 --> 04:18:50,420
Pelt deck.

8244
04:18:50,420 --> 04:18:52,840
That was clutch getting a little into the 40.

8245
04:18:52,900 --> 04:18:53,260
Let's go.

8246
04:18:53,420 --> 04:18:58,260
I mean, am I allowed to use the statue to see how many lift monk I went to?

8247
04:18:58,480 --> 04:19:01,240
We have to get to, like, five.

8248
04:19:01,680 --> 04:19:03,320
I'm not at five for ten points.

8249
04:19:03,420 --> 04:19:04,020
I'm at four.

8250
04:19:04,420 --> 04:19:04,820
Yeah.

8251
04:19:04,960 --> 04:19:06,580
I mean, if I'm allowed to enhance.

8252
04:19:07,740 --> 04:19:08,680
Yeah, I think so.

8253
04:19:08,900 --> 04:19:09,220
Right?

8254
04:19:09,320 --> 04:19:09,880
For reporting?

8255
04:19:10,040 --> 04:19:11,260
Yeah, you should be fine.

8256
04:19:11,500 --> 04:19:12,520
Yeah, it's just reporting.

8257
04:19:12,720 --> 04:19:14,380
I'm at three, actually.

8258
04:19:14,580 --> 04:19:15,000
I'm at four.

8259
04:19:15,260 --> 04:19:15,760
Yeah, nothing to report.

8260
04:19:15,780 --> 04:19:16,180
None of us are at five.

8261
04:19:16,380 --> 04:19:17,280
Five is where there's points.

8262
04:19:17,320 --> 04:19:18,180
Yeah, five is where it starts.

8263
04:19:18,380 --> 04:19:21,320
I have 71 registered pals.

8264
04:19:22,420 --> 04:19:23,220
71 showed.

8265
04:19:23,460 --> 04:19:24,000
Clip, clip, clip.

8266
04:19:26,400 --> 04:19:27,020
Mine's 40.

8267
04:19:27,380 --> 04:19:28,100
Already clipped.

8268
04:19:28,460 --> 04:19:29,160
Clip, clip, clip.

8269
04:19:29,220 --> 04:19:30,260
Fourth tied for third.

8270
04:19:30,520 --> 04:19:31,400
We're tied for third.

8271
04:19:31,480 --> 04:19:31,820
55.

8272
04:19:32,060 --> 04:19:32,720
Clip, clip, clip.

8273
04:19:33,480 --> 04:19:35,920
They're still tallying, though, so we could get pushed down.

8274
04:19:36,120 --> 04:19:36,620
Yeah, that's true.

8275
04:19:38,140 --> 04:19:39,260
You know what, though?

8276
04:19:39,840 --> 04:19:40,820
We did really good.

8277
04:19:40,820 --> 04:19:41,840
We did pretty well.

8278
04:19:42,140 --> 04:19:43,620
We did pretty fucking good.

8279
04:19:43,680 --> 04:19:44,580
We did pretty good.

8280
04:19:45,960 --> 04:19:47,040
We almost got 120, man.

8281
04:19:47,040 --> 04:19:49,740
We almost got 120, man!

8282
04:19:49,980 --> 04:19:52,200
Level 50 in eight hours, though?

8283
04:19:52,300 --> 04:19:54,020
That's kinda crazy.

8284
04:19:54,040 --> 04:19:54,460
We almost got it.

8285
04:19:54,940 --> 04:19:59,000
If somebody could've put the fuck out of the function.

8286
04:19:59,000 --> 04:20:06,420
I would've gotten 70 points for Blasamit, but it failed the second thing, and then I would've gotten the level 50 for 120.

8287
04:20:08,460 --> 04:20:10,420
Yeah, I'm checking what other stuff we can...

8288
04:20:10,420 --> 04:20:11,860
RNGs is not with me.

8289
04:20:12,160 --> 04:20:14,180
Yeah, our RNG was pretty fucking bad.

8290
04:20:14,180 --> 04:20:16,900
And I had to use the legendary balls in the black market.

8291
04:20:20,700 --> 04:20:21,580
We just had...

8292
04:20:21,580 --> 04:20:24,460
The black market appears to be worth it, because 180 points, so...

8293
04:20:24,460 --> 04:20:24,940
Alright.

8294
04:20:28,280 --> 04:20:29,560
71... did you...

8295
04:20:29,560 --> 04:20:31,900
Okay, I'm trying to check if they did all of this.

8296
04:20:32,480 --> 04:20:34,300
And Lily got hers, too.

8297
04:20:34,900 --> 04:20:36,100
Wait, Lily got 40.

8298
04:20:36,100 --> 04:20:37,360
It says 38, though.

8299
04:20:38,920 --> 04:20:39,800
Lily got 40?

8300
04:20:40,020 --> 04:20:40,300
Yeah.

8301
04:20:40,300 --> 04:20:40,540
Yeah.

8302
04:20:41,300 --> 04:20:44,600
Peepee, do the new one, because that says 38.

8303
04:20:45,500 --> 04:20:46,700
New register, 48.

8304
04:20:47,520 --> 04:20:47,920
40.

8305
04:20:50,400 --> 04:20:51,420
High five, Lily.

8306
04:20:51,840 --> 04:20:53,220
Oh my god, Lily, we did it!

8307
04:20:54,740 --> 04:20:55,540
We clutched!

8308
04:20:55,540 --> 04:21:01,140
We just threw money at you, like, The last five minutes, we were just screaming at each other.

8309
04:21:01,740 --> 04:21:05,260
We were throwing money at me and screaming at me.

8310
04:21:05,500 --> 04:21:09,940
It didn't show the butcher thing, so I restarted, but then you guys were like, put it in the slot!

8311
04:21:10,300 --> 04:21:12,700
I was like, how the fuck do you put them in the weapon slot?

8312
04:21:12,920 --> 04:21:15,300
I died to a fucking bug, man.

8313
04:21:15,480 --> 04:21:17,360
I would have been 50 if not for the bug.

8314
04:21:18,080 --> 04:21:18,720
You died to a fucking bug!

8315
04:21:18,720 --> 04:21:20,160
Your lucky stats, man!

8316
04:21:20,280 --> 04:21:21,220
Your luck stats!

8317
04:21:21,640 --> 04:21:24,420
Let me see if I can find the clip of how I fucking died.

8318
04:21:24,560 --> 04:21:27,700
Just be like, compensation points, please.

8319
04:21:27,700 --> 04:21:30,780
Yeah, like, I would have gotten 50 if not for that shit.

8320
04:21:30,800 --> 04:21:31,220
On God.

8321
04:21:32,340 --> 04:21:33,420
It's actually wild.

8322
04:21:34,760 --> 04:21:35,360
That was crazy.

8323
04:21:36,240 --> 04:21:38,160
You should have checked your balls, man.

8324
04:21:38,500 --> 04:21:39,940
Dude, what does this have to do with balls?

8325
04:21:40,300 --> 04:21:41,460
You ran out of balls!

8326
04:21:41,480 --> 04:21:43,000
You know the house rule!

8327
04:21:43,140 --> 04:21:45,760
You check your balls before you leave!

8328
04:21:47,620 --> 04:21:49,480
Oh yeah, we should log out.

8329
04:21:50,100 --> 04:21:51,720
Oh, pp mod, pp mod.

8330
04:21:51,800 --> 04:21:52,540
40, 40.

8331
04:21:52,660 --> 04:21:53,700
You didn't give her...

8332
04:21:53,700 --> 04:21:54,860
check the registered 40.

8333
04:21:55,140 --> 04:21:56,580
Wait, technically...

8334
04:21:56,580 --> 04:21:58,500
Tell Lily to show dex.

8335
04:21:59,020 --> 04:22:03,500
Does the level sync matter with pals?

8336
04:22:03,680 --> 04:22:05,660
Because technically my pals are level 50.

8337
04:22:05,760 --> 04:22:06,640
Wait, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

8338
04:22:06,640 --> 04:22:07,660
That works, that works!

8339
04:22:07,740 --> 04:22:08,100
Report, report!

8340
04:22:08,280 --> 04:22:08,840
Oh fuck yeah!

8341
04:22:09,740 --> 04:22:11,500
Take a photo, take a photo!

8342
04:22:11,660 --> 04:22:14,300
It just has to be not level 50.

8343
04:22:14,900 --> 04:22:17,000
I had the dex open for so long!

8344
04:22:17,500 --> 04:22:18,060
Open dex.

8345
04:22:18,500 --> 04:22:19,620
Okay, hold up.

8346
04:22:19,800 --> 04:22:22,560
Show the level 40, because we still have...

8347
04:22:22,560 --> 04:22:24,220
Yeah, we still have one minute.

8348
04:22:24,300 --> 04:22:24,920
pp mod, please.

8349
04:22:24,940 --> 04:22:27,320
We also need the clip of...

8350
04:22:27,320 --> 04:22:28,560
Sureforce, level 50.

8351
04:22:29,540 --> 04:22:31,100
Yeah, I'm just looking at it.

8352
04:22:31,980 --> 04:22:32,780
Sureforce, okay.

8353
04:22:32,780 --> 04:22:36,060
I will fucking go over there and look at it.

8354
04:22:36,260 --> 04:22:38,560
pp mod, keep it open.

8355
04:22:38,680 --> 04:22:39,820
I'll screenshot myself.

8356
04:22:41,200 --> 04:22:42,660
Thank you so much.

8357
04:22:42,720 --> 04:22:43,320
Please clip.

8358
04:22:43,520 --> 04:22:44,480
Wait, no, that's level 40.

8359
04:22:44,640 --> 04:22:45,240
Oh wait, level sync.

8360
04:22:45,580 --> 04:22:46,600
Level 50.

8361
04:22:46,880 --> 04:22:52,840
Level 50 is sureforce.

8362
04:22:55,660 --> 04:22:56,620
Level 50 is sureforce.

8363
04:22:56,620 --> 04:22:57,920
50 is sureforce pet.

8364
04:22:58,900 --> 04:22:59,380
50 is sureforce pet.

8365
04:22:59,840 --> 04:23:02,120
Pal is level 50, kinda, is the name of the clip.

8366
04:23:02,240 --> 04:23:02,720
Pal is level 50, kinda, is the name of the clip.

8367
04:23:02,780 --> 04:23:03,520
Oh, oh, oh.

8368
04:23:03,980 --> 04:23:07,220
No, get rid of that!

8369
04:23:07,340 --> 04:23:08,760
They're not gonna watch the clip anyway.

8370
04:23:08,900 --> 04:23:09,620
Just get rid of it.

8371
04:23:11,340 --> 04:23:12,840
Call it, pal is level 50.

8372
04:23:13,000 --> 04:23:14,420
So fucking giga chad.

8373
04:23:14,540 --> 04:23:16,060
The chad is fucking pal.

8374
04:23:16,120 --> 04:23:16,760
It's calz!

8375
04:23:16,980 --> 04:23:17,720
Log out, log out.

8376
04:23:17,820 --> 04:23:18,380
I'm logging out.

8377
04:23:19,080 --> 04:23:20,080
Logging out, logging out.

8378
04:23:20,220 --> 04:23:21,060
Logging out.

8379
04:23:22,300 --> 04:23:22,780
Logging out.

8380
04:23:24,480 --> 04:23:25,280
Holy shit.

8381
04:23:25,300 --> 04:23:26,320
That was like...

8382
04:23:26,320 --> 04:23:29,180
the most stressful last five minutes.

8383
04:23:29,380 --> 04:23:29,580
That was so stressful.

8384
04:23:29,580 --> 04:23:30,140
Holy shit.

8385
04:23:31,140 --> 04:23:31,540
Bro.

8386
04:23:32,880 --> 04:23:34,420
Dude, we did so good.

8387
04:23:34,420 --> 04:23:35,700
We did so good though.

8388
04:23:36,200 --> 04:23:38,940
Okay, watch this clip and explain to me how I died.

8389
04:23:39,100 --> 04:23:39,820
Okay, I'm watching.

8390
04:23:39,980 --> 04:23:40,760
I need to know now.

8391
04:23:40,900 --> 04:23:42,440
I'll put the clip in the chat.

8392
04:23:42,820 --> 04:23:44,820
I put it in the team Doki Bird.

8393
04:23:45,100 --> 04:23:46,320
Is it...

8394
04:23:48,200 --> 04:23:50,080
I was like, what?

8395
04:23:52,120 --> 04:23:54,280
Han, I'll pull up the clip for chat in a second.

8396
04:23:54,800 --> 04:23:55,240
What?

8397
04:23:55,500 --> 04:23:57,100
Wait, yeah, what the fuck killed you?

8398
04:23:57,380 --> 04:23:58,060
I don't know!

8399
04:23:58,140 --> 04:23:59,440
That's what I'm confused about.

8400
04:24:01,020 --> 04:24:01,460
Huh?

8401
04:24:03,400 --> 04:24:04,720
Okay, I'm trying to give you the clip.

8402
04:24:04,840 --> 04:24:06,060
Wait, wait, what killed you?

8403
04:24:06,160 --> 04:24:08,440
Wait, were you on fire maybe and it didn't register?

8404
04:24:08,780 --> 04:24:09,640
Give me a sec, guys.

8405
04:24:09,680 --> 04:24:09,840
I'm off.

8406
04:24:09,840 --> 04:24:12,020
But fire damage doesn't tick that fast for all of my health.

8407
04:24:12,020 --> 04:24:13,660
Yeah, that was really fast.

8408
04:24:13,720 --> 04:24:14,720
Like the fire damage.

8409
04:24:15,100 --> 04:24:15,120
Yeah.

8410
04:24:16,500 --> 04:24:18,460
Oh shit, I'm still in non-miss mode, guys.

8411
04:24:18,560 --> 04:24:19,080
Give me a sec.

8412
04:24:19,680 --> 04:24:20,560
Here, I'll show chat.

8413
04:24:20,780 --> 04:24:25,760
I have an on mode on so people don't track you down where I'm looking at.

8414
04:24:27,000 --> 04:24:27,360
Why is she in the chat?

8415
04:24:27,360 --> 04:24:27,880
There you go.

8416
04:24:28,040 --> 04:24:28,320
There it is.

8417
04:24:29,300 --> 04:24:30,300
I'm just dying.

8418
04:24:30,500 --> 04:24:32,640
He just fucking collapses.

8419
04:24:32,660 --> 04:24:33,520
Just fucking dies.

8420
04:24:33,660 --> 04:24:35,580
Yeah, he just collapses.

8421
04:24:39,600 --> 04:24:41,600
It's like the dead lolomote.

8422
04:24:49,540 --> 04:24:51,400
He's in the background.

8423
04:24:51,720 --> 04:24:53,260
He's like, huh?

8424
04:24:56,980 --> 04:24:58,180
Holy fuck.

8425
04:24:59,380 --> 04:25:01,800
I'm gonna check the rankings right now.

8426
04:25:02,360 --> 04:25:04,480
That was so fucking stressful.

8427
04:25:04,780 --> 04:25:05,740
Holy shit.

8428
04:25:06,160 --> 04:25:07,980
That was actually so stressful.

8429
04:25:08,500 --> 04:25:09,140
You know what though?

8430
04:25:09,660 --> 04:25:11,800
Trust the process, right?

8431
04:25:11,920 --> 04:25:15,280
We said it was gonna be slow at the start and big gains at the end.

8432
04:25:15,460 --> 04:25:15,740
Oh my god.

8433
04:25:15,740 --> 04:25:17,160
That was way too stressful.

8434
04:25:17,400 --> 04:25:18,100
Not gonna lie.

8435
04:25:18,520 --> 04:25:20,500
We said trust the process.

8436
04:25:21,100 --> 04:25:22,240
Trust the process.

8437
04:25:22,460 --> 04:25:26,560
We would have been so much better if people just trusted in the stressors.

8438
04:25:26,560 --> 04:25:26,700
Yeah, that's true.

8439
04:25:26,920 --> 04:25:28,020
Or I'm a process.

8440
04:25:28,180 --> 04:25:28,800
We trusted in the stressors the whole time.

8441
04:25:29,380 --> 04:25:30,160
That's right.

8442
04:25:31,240 --> 04:25:32,840
We trusted so hard.

8443
04:25:33,240 --> 04:25:35,400
We trusted so fucking hard.

8444
04:25:35,860 --> 04:25:36,360
Trustga.

8445
04:25:37,020 --> 04:25:38,340
Oh my god.

8446
04:25:38,520 --> 04:25:39,260
It's so close.

8447
04:25:39,280 --> 04:25:43,520
Third and fourth place is so close.

8448
04:25:43,960 --> 04:25:44,280
Bro.

8449
04:25:44,960 --> 04:25:46,160
Oh my god.

8450
04:25:47,900 --> 04:25:49,100
I'm gonna pull this over.

8451
04:25:49,160 --> 04:25:51,400
Third place for zero...

8452
04:25:52,100 --> 04:25:52,740
What's the word?

8453
04:25:54,140 --> 04:25:54,780
Setup?

8454
04:25:54,860 --> 04:25:56,220
We didn't setup anything.

8455
04:25:58,180 --> 04:25:59,540
We didn't fall deep yet.

8456
04:26:00,160 --> 04:26:01,680
We just must have planned.

8457
04:26:01,920 --> 04:26:03,200
You didn't even level 50.

8458
04:26:03,260 --> 04:26:05,820
They didn't count it.

8459
04:26:06,080 --> 04:26:06,840
They didn't count it.

8460
04:26:07,020 --> 04:26:08,920
It says level 50, man.

8461
04:26:08,960 --> 04:26:11,060
It says level 50.

8462
04:26:11,440 --> 04:26:13,820
It says level 50, pal.

8463
04:26:14,420 --> 04:26:15,020
No.

8464
04:26:15,420 --> 04:26:18,920
It says the pal has to be level 50.

8465
04:26:19,100 --> 04:26:21,560
Nothing says it's connected to player level.

8466
04:26:21,620 --> 04:26:22,220
Instructions.

8467
04:26:22,220 --> 04:26:22,800
Exactly.

8468
04:26:22,900 --> 04:26:23,500
Unclear.

8469
04:26:25,780 --> 04:26:26,380
Okay.

8470
04:26:26,540 --> 04:26:28,760
What about my bug dying randomly, admin?

8471
04:26:30,480 --> 04:26:32,920
It says pal level 50.

8472
04:26:33,860 --> 04:26:35,640
It says pal level 50.

8473
04:26:35,640 --> 04:26:35,760
It says pal level 50.

8474
04:26:35,760 --> 04:26:36,680
It's not our fault.

8475
04:26:36,700 --> 04:26:38,940
Turf was too weak for his pal.

8476
04:26:39,380 --> 04:26:39,960
Weak?

8477
04:26:40,120 --> 04:26:41,220
It says pal level 50.

8478
04:26:43,840 --> 04:26:45,960
It's not our fault his pal isn't up.

8479
04:26:46,020 --> 04:26:47,280
It's an up.

8480
04:26:47,620 --> 04:26:48,740
Up section.

8481
04:26:49,540 --> 04:26:50,140
Admin.

8482
04:26:50,140 --> 04:26:51,180
Oh, we got a second.

8483
04:26:51,220 --> 04:26:52,580
We got an at.

8484
04:26:55,140 --> 04:26:55,540
Objection.

8485
04:26:55,880 --> 04:26:56,600
There we go.

8486
04:26:59,220 --> 04:27:01,620
It doesn't change our placements.

8487
04:27:02,040 --> 04:27:04,260
It doesn't change our placements at all.

8488
04:27:04,700 --> 04:27:05,340
It doesn't change our placements at all.

8489
04:27:05,340 --> 04:27:06,020
Wait, does it not?

8490
04:27:06,360 --> 04:27:07,180
It doesn't.

8491
04:27:07,420 --> 04:27:09,900
Wait, how many points is the level?

8492
04:27:09,920 --> 04:27:10,720
Wait, no, it does.

8493
04:27:11,440 --> 04:27:12,720
We would be second.

8494
04:27:13,460 --> 04:27:14,140
No, no, no.

8495
04:27:14,160 --> 04:27:16,580
If it does, we're third because they...

8496
04:27:16,580 --> 04:27:18,360
They just went in front of us.

8497
04:27:18,360 --> 04:27:20,060
Yeah, we would be third.

8498
04:27:20,260 --> 04:27:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

8499
04:27:21,620 --> 04:27:22,880
This does matter.

8500
04:27:23,220 --> 04:27:25,560
This is technicalities right now.

8501
04:27:25,680 --> 04:27:28,540
If we get it, we are third.

8502
04:27:31,180 --> 04:27:33,480
It literally says pal level 30.

8503
04:27:33,680 --> 04:27:36,180
Nothing says... it's corresponding.

8504
04:27:36,460 --> 04:27:37,700
It has to be...

8505
04:27:38,180 --> 04:27:38,480
Exactly.

8506
04:27:39,080 --> 04:27:42,120
Yeah, we're the people admin hate.

8507
04:27:42,380 --> 04:27:43,160
Feels good.

8508
04:27:43,560 --> 04:27:44,620
No, right now.

8509
04:27:45,560 --> 04:27:46,440
Objection, actually.

8510
04:27:48,360 --> 04:27:49,740
Ryan Higa's team is like...

8511
04:27:50,120 --> 04:27:51,400
20 points ahead of us.

8512
04:27:51,500 --> 04:27:52,740
So we need that point.

8513
04:27:53,060 --> 04:27:53,860
We need it.

8514
04:27:53,960 --> 04:27:57,580
We really need it.

8515
04:27:58,540 --> 04:27:59,460
Come on.

8516
04:28:01,680 --> 04:28:02,240
Bro.

8517
04:28:02,500 --> 04:28:03,700
Bro, come on.

8518
04:28:03,700 --> 04:28:04,380
Count it.

8519
04:28:04,660 --> 04:28:06,980
There's no mention of player level 50.

8520
04:28:07,000 --> 04:28:08,260
That's a whole different achievement.

8521
04:28:09,260 --> 04:28:11,620
That's a different achievement for a reason.

8522
04:28:12,120 --> 04:28:13,280
That's a different achievement.

8523
04:28:13,300 --> 04:28:18,340
If they wanted it to be pal and trainer, they would have clarified in the rules.

8524
04:28:18,360 --> 04:28:19,300
But they didn't.

8525
04:28:19,300 --> 04:28:22,660
It would have been one achievement for more points.

8526
04:28:22,920 --> 04:28:24,440
But they split the achievement.

8527
04:28:25,680 --> 04:28:26,240
Objection!

8528
04:28:26,240 --> 04:28:26,760
Yeah!

8529
04:28:27,980 --> 04:28:29,340
Take him the coin, Lily!

8530
04:28:30,100 --> 04:28:31,560
I'll take him the fucking coin!

8531
04:28:35,040 --> 04:28:37,040
Give us those 20 points!

8532
04:28:37,540 --> 04:28:39,300
I'll point fingers and scream.

8533
04:28:39,340 --> 04:28:40,380
And they will take me serious.

8534
04:28:40,660 --> 04:28:42,400
At this point, we lost...

8535
04:28:42,400 --> 04:28:44,640
We lost the sure fortune to two bugs.

8536
04:28:46,140 --> 04:28:47,800
They should give us... No, no, no.

8537
04:28:48,360 --> 04:28:49,840
Actually, actually, what do we do about...

8538
04:28:49,840 --> 04:28:49,980
Three bugs, technically.

8539
04:28:50,280 --> 04:28:53,020
Yeah, what do we do about the fangalope when I went to a new bug?

8540
04:28:53,020 --> 04:28:53,360
Yeah, three bugs.

8541
04:28:53,720 --> 04:28:56,100
Yeah, we had three bugs.

8542
04:28:56,360 --> 04:28:56,940
Come on!

8543
04:28:57,000 --> 04:28:58,660
Dude, why am I constantly getting fucked?

8544
04:29:02,200 --> 04:29:04,000
At least someone's getting it.

8545
04:29:04,100 --> 04:29:04,520
At least someone's getting it.

8546
04:29:04,520 --> 04:29:04,560
Whoa!

8547
04:29:04,840 --> 04:29:06,480
God, I fucking wish.

8548
04:29:09,340 --> 04:29:09,780
Wild.

8549
04:29:11,620 --> 04:29:13,100
Level 50 or bust!

8550
04:29:13,160 --> 04:29:13,960
Give it to us!

8551
04:29:14,420 --> 04:29:14,860
Come on!

8552
04:29:14,860 --> 04:29:15,420
Come on!

8553
04:29:20,000 --> 04:29:21,120
He's a coward.

8554
04:29:21,180 --> 04:29:22,400
The mod's not coming over.

8555
04:29:22,580 --> 04:29:24,340
He doesn't want to fight us.

8556
04:29:24,440 --> 04:29:27,300
He's like the Karens in the Dokibird chat.

8557
04:29:27,420 --> 04:29:29,000
Need to be left alone.

8558
04:29:30,010 --> 04:29:31,720
Give us those 20 points!

8559
04:29:33,460 --> 04:29:35,960
We want those 20 points!

8560
04:29:38,500 --> 04:29:40,420
I'm not asking anymore.

8561
04:29:40,880 --> 04:29:42,940
We're demanding right now.

8562
04:29:42,940 --> 04:29:43,360
It's a demand.

8563
04:29:43,360 --> 04:29:43,780
Demand.

8564
04:29:45,440 --> 04:29:49,040
Would you like to return to your wife and kids safely today?

8565
04:29:49,340 --> 04:29:49,760
Oooh.

8566
04:29:53,740 --> 04:29:57,120
Bro, they're not giving it to us.

8567
04:29:57,180 --> 04:29:58,960
Oh my god, they're ignoring us!

8568
04:29:59,340 --> 04:29:59,640
What?

8569
04:30:00,280 --> 04:30:00,820
Okay.

8570
04:30:01,260 --> 04:30:02,720
Let's...I told you, man!

8571
04:30:03,320 --> 04:30:10,260
Someone add dead person be like question mark während Ask Dan Clancy for a review.

8572
04:30:10,400 --> 04:30:11,340
I'll bring it up Monday.

8573
04:30:11,440 --> 04:30:12,460
I'll bring it up at the dinner.

8574
04:30:12,460 --> 04:30:13,200
I'll be like that!

8575
04:30:14,720 --> 04:30:17,800
I didn't get my third place at the rivals!

8576
04:30:20,440 --> 04:30:21,280
That's money.

8577
04:30:21,520 --> 04:30:24,320
That is money right there that we deserve.

8578
04:30:25,280 --> 04:30:26,680
We deserve it!

8579
04:30:26,740 --> 04:30:28,060
Oh, wait, wait, they're typing!

8580
04:30:28,440 --> 04:30:29,360
They're typing!

8581
04:30:29,520 --> 04:30:30,680
They're typing!

8582
04:30:30,800 --> 04:30:31,200
They're typing!

8583
04:30:31,200 --> 04:30:31,560
Come on!

8584
04:30:32,060 --> 04:30:32,800
They're typing!

8585
04:30:34,960 --> 04:30:36,140
We deserve it!

8586
04:30:36,140 --> 04:30:36,700
Come on!

8587
04:30:36,880 --> 04:30:37,420
Come on!

8588
04:30:37,420 --> 04:30:38,100
Come on!

8589
04:30:38,100 --> 04:30:39,280
Give us the points!

8590
04:30:41,380 --> 04:30:45,800
Look, I'm a Vtuber, I can't read, but I can read the word pal, and that's all it said.

8591
04:30:47,380 --> 04:30:49,560
They stopped typing!

8592
04:30:50,860 --> 04:30:52,760
They stopped typing?!

8593
04:30:52,760 --> 04:30:54,140
They're ghosting us.

8594
04:30:55,600 --> 04:30:57,320
Put your fucking balls down!

8595
04:30:57,420 --> 04:30:57,880
Typing again!

8596
04:30:58,580 --> 04:30:58,980
Typing again!

8597
04:30:59,420 --> 04:31:00,360
Typing, typing, typing!

8598
04:31:00,500 --> 04:31:01,380
Typing, typing, typing!

8599
04:31:01,440 --> 04:31:02,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

8600
04:31:03,680 --> 04:31:04,560
Where is it?

8601
04:31:04,620 --> 04:31:05,020
Come on!

8602
04:31:05,220 --> 04:31:06,680
We don't care!

8603
04:31:06,780 --> 04:31:08,520
You can give the others that point too!

8604
04:31:08,600 --> 04:31:09,040
We don't care!

8605
04:31:09,280 --> 04:31:09,920
We deserve it!

8606
04:31:09,980 --> 04:31:11,340
Everybody deserves those points!

8607
04:31:11,460 --> 04:31:11,860
Come on!

8608
04:31:13,900 --> 04:31:14,400
No!

8609
04:31:14,700 --> 04:31:16,180
Yeah, but that's a red number!

8610
04:31:16,240 --> 04:31:16,960
That doesn't matter!

8611
04:31:17,200 --> 04:31:18,680
It doesn't... yeah, but it doesn't mention cap!

8612
04:31:19,300 --> 04:31:20,240
It doesn't!

8613
04:31:20,240 --> 04:31:20,480
It doesn't cap!

8614
04:31:21,480 --> 04:31:22,240
So what?

8615
04:31:22,300 --> 04:31:23,440
Nothing mentions cap!

8616
04:31:23,620 --> 04:31:27,620
Nothing mentions... we have a separate achievement for player level!

8617
04:31:27,800 --> 04:31:28,720
What's the point then?

8618
04:31:29,800 --> 04:31:31,640
What the fuck's the point?!

8619
04:31:31,640 --> 04:31:33,080
Yeah, what the fuck's the point?!

8620
04:31:33,080 --> 04:31:33,960
We're being robbed.

8621
04:31:34,120 --> 04:31:35,300
We're being robbed right now.

8622
04:31:36,620 --> 04:31:39,260
We're being such huge carrots at the moment.

8623
04:31:41,080 --> 04:31:42,460
That's our third place.

8624
04:31:42,580 --> 04:31:44,160
That's our third place right there.

8625
04:31:44,380 --> 04:31:45,240
Level 50.

8626
04:31:49,800 --> 04:31:51,060
It's a dire wolf!

8627
04:31:51,200 --> 04:31:55,680
There was no way we captured a level 50 dire wolf!

8628
04:31:56,120 --> 04:31:57,800
We love wood and ferrets!

8629
04:31:57,900 --> 04:32:01,520
Show me a level 50 dire wolf and I'll show you a god!

8630
04:32:01,760 --> 04:32:03,300
There is no such thing!

8631
04:32:03,400 --> 04:32:04,540
Scum-O's peppy hands.

8632
04:32:05,980 --> 04:32:07,700
We've been scum-O'sed.

8633
04:32:08,240 --> 04:32:09,540
We've been scum-O'sed.

8634
04:32:10,580 --> 04:32:11,260
Unbelievable.

8635
04:32:11,880 --> 04:32:16,240
If you don't make the rules proper, we deserve the points.

8636
04:32:16,240 --> 04:32:19,200
That is a mistake for next time that has to be fixed.

8637
04:32:20,800 --> 04:32:21,480
Unbelievable.

8638
04:32:21,700 --> 04:32:24,480
They did count the pack 20 humans, right?

8639
04:32:24,640 --> 04:32:25,100
They did.

8640
04:32:25,220 --> 04:32:26,100
They should have.

8641
04:32:26,400 --> 04:32:31,440
I think half points at least is a good compensation.

8642
04:32:32,560 --> 04:32:34,040
Oh my god.

8643
04:32:34,540 --> 04:32:35,340
At least half.

8644
04:32:36,860 --> 04:32:39,960
At least half for when my fangalope was gone.

8645
04:32:39,960 --> 04:32:42,480
I put a woo at the end so they can't get mad at me.

8646
04:32:43,640 --> 04:32:45,820
It's internet girl magic.

8647
04:32:46,240 --> 04:32:50,540
Can we get partial points for when...

8648
04:32:53,700 --> 04:32:55,740
I just got fangaloped.

8649
04:32:56,040 --> 04:32:58,260
I just know a freaking idea.

8650
04:33:00,920 --> 04:33:02,280
Oh my god.

8651
04:33:02,280 --> 04:33:05,480
I just learned how to read but it doesn't say cap.

8652
04:33:07,920 --> 04:33:08,440
So...

8653
04:33:08,440 --> 04:33:09,420
Oh no.

8654
04:33:09,720 --> 04:33:10,200
Oh.

8655
04:33:10,480 --> 04:33:10,840
Oh.

8656
04:33:13,040 --> 04:33:15,320
All caps so they know I'm serious.

8657
04:33:17,760 --> 04:33:20,960
I like how fangaloped isn't cap because he googled the name.

8658
04:33:20,960 --> 04:33:23,560
Because I copied and pasted it from the Google Doc.

8659
04:33:26,960 --> 04:33:29,120
Can we get partial points for when...

8660
04:33:29,120 --> 04:33:29,960
Fangaloped.

8661
04:33:35,300 --> 04:33:36,740
So they know I'm serious.

8662
04:33:37,800 --> 04:33:39,760
So sure if I wrote...

8663
04:33:39,760 --> 04:33:40,560
Oh my god.

8664
04:33:40,900 --> 04:33:43,320
Half points please because...

8665
04:33:43,320 --> 04:33:44,280
Fangaloped.

8666
04:33:44,440 --> 04:33:45,060
Fangaloped.

8667
04:33:48,700 --> 04:33:49,800
I'm choking.

8668
04:33:51,580 --> 04:33:52,220
Bro.

8669
04:33:54,420 --> 04:33:56,700
Give us those points.

8670
04:33:57,440 --> 04:33:58,480
Give us those points.

8671
04:33:58,480 --> 04:33:59,240
Wait did we get a...

8672
04:34:00,080 --> 04:34:01,200
Did we get a...

8673
04:34:01,200 --> 04:34:01,460
Close.

8674
04:34:01,500 --> 04:34:02,700
We got a clip of the kill.

8675
04:34:02,940 --> 04:34:03,540
Okay we did.

8676
04:34:03,660 --> 04:34:03,780
Yeah.

8677
04:34:04,040 --> 04:34:05,900
Yeah we got a clip of the kill probably.

8678
04:34:06,120 --> 04:34:06,820
We should have.

8679
04:34:07,060 --> 04:34:07,900
I screwed up.

8680
04:34:08,020 --> 04:34:08,540
I screwed up.

8681
04:34:09,180 --> 04:34:10,100
I screwed up.

8682
04:34:10,660 --> 04:34:12,000
I should have been there.

8683
04:34:14,720 --> 04:34:19,100
Yeah and then I walked up to Anubis and he was bugged and then I had to kill him later.

8684
04:34:19,400 --> 04:34:20,280
Guys we're not third.

8685
04:34:20,280 --> 04:34:21,280
Everything's against me.

8686
04:34:21,460 --> 04:34:22,020
We're fourth right now.

8687
04:34:22,040 --> 04:34:25,060
That's why we're trying so hard to get these extra points.

8688
04:34:25,380 --> 04:34:25,820
Come on.

8689
04:34:25,820 --> 04:34:28,460
Because if we get the extra points we would be third.

8690
04:34:28,920 --> 04:34:29,900
No we're fourth.

8691
04:34:29,900 --> 04:34:31,740
We literally need twenty more points.

8692
04:34:31,840 --> 04:34:32,120
No.

8693
04:34:35,650 --> 04:34:36,500
Oh my god.

8694
04:34:37,040 --> 04:34:38,700
It's not about the money.

8695
04:34:38,840 --> 04:34:40,000
It's top three.

8696
04:34:40,740 --> 04:34:42,620
It's the principle.

8697
04:34:42,780 --> 04:34:44,020
It's the principle.

8698
04:34:44,220 --> 04:34:45,600
You wouldn't understand.

8699
04:34:45,820 --> 04:34:47,620
You don't understand guys.

8700
04:34:47,880 --> 04:34:50,340
Because top three... third and fourth place...

8701
04:34:50,340 --> 04:34:50,600
Damn Daniel.

8702
04:34:50,860 --> 04:34:52,580
Gets the same amount of money.

8703
04:34:52,780 --> 04:34:54,700
They get the same amount of money.

8704
04:34:54,920 --> 04:34:59,720
I'm not able to put PAL Tournament champion top three in my file for at least a week.

8705
04:34:59,900 --> 04:35:02,140
I need that on my Twitter profile.

8706
04:35:03,080 --> 04:35:03,520
Yes!

8707
04:35:03,740 --> 04:35:04,840
We can... you know what?

8708
04:35:04,840 --> 04:35:05,320
You know what guys?

8709
04:35:05,420 --> 04:35:06,920
We'll just put top three with an asterisk next to it.

8710
04:35:06,920 --> 04:35:08,120
That's twenty points right there.

8711
04:35:08,560 --> 04:35:09,540
That's twenty points.

8712
04:35:09,600 --> 04:35:10,720
That clip is twenty points.

8713
04:35:10,800 --> 04:35:11,040
Top three asterisk?

8714
04:35:17,500 --> 04:35:18,580
Yeah sorry chat.

8715
04:35:18,700 --> 04:35:19,560
They're still tallying.

8716
04:35:19,600 --> 04:35:21,620
So yeah it's a little...

8717
04:35:21,620 --> 04:35:23,360
I like the clip.

8718
04:35:23,480 --> 04:35:23,880
Where?

8719
04:35:24,960 --> 04:35:25,400
Where?

8720
04:35:26,080 --> 04:35:26,520
Wait.

8721
04:35:26,580 --> 04:35:27,200
He's not there.

8722
04:35:27,740 --> 04:35:28,880
Can I just say sure for?

8723
04:35:29,060 --> 04:35:29,880
I don't know who's making the clip.

8724
04:35:29,880 --> 04:35:31,840
I'm not making your clips but they're very sassy.

8725
04:35:31,840 --> 04:35:31,900
Those are mine.

8726
04:35:31,960 --> 04:35:33,540
They have like the sassiest clips.

8727
04:35:33,980 --> 04:35:34,800
Those are me.

8728
04:35:35,120 --> 04:35:35,180
You're making them yourself?

8729
04:35:35,440 --> 04:35:35,900
You are sassy.

8730
04:35:35,900 --> 04:35:37,180
Yeah look it says clipped by.

8731
04:35:37,600 --> 04:35:38,620
You're sassy.

8732
04:35:38,840 --> 04:35:39,960
I am sassy.

8733
04:35:40,940 --> 04:35:42,720
I told you I've contained myself.

8734
04:35:42,980 --> 04:35:44,080
I'm like the straight man.

8735
04:35:46,160 --> 04:35:46,680
Dang.

8736
04:35:47,740 --> 04:35:49,480
Guys it's not about the money.

8737
04:35:49,560 --> 04:35:51,920
Third and fourth get the same amount of money.

8738
04:35:53,280 --> 04:35:53,800
Okay.

8739
04:35:55,400 --> 04:35:57,380
Ryan Higgins team got more points.

8740
04:35:57,440 --> 04:35:58,340
I don't think we can count them.

8741
04:35:58,340 --> 04:35:59,860
Oh they got more points.

8742
04:35:59,860 --> 04:36:02,940
Oh no no we can if we get the...

8743
04:36:02,940 --> 04:36:04,080
No no no no.

8744
04:36:04,080 --> 04:36:06,320
If we get the partial points we...

8745
04:36:06,320 --> 04:36:06,640
Trust the process.

8746
04:36:06,640 --> 04:36:07,980
How are they still getting more points?

8747
04:36:08,000 --> 04:36:08,280
Trust the process.

8748
04:36:08,660 --> 04:36:10,740
Wait how the fuck are they still getting more points?

8749
04:36:10,760 --> 04:36:12,020
The report is over.

8750
04:36:14,100 --> 04:36:18,720
I want to know how team Garrick is six after they were first from day one.

8751
04:36:19,080 --> 04:36:19,880
They did all...

8752
04:36:19,880 --> 04:36:21,160
No because they did all the global.

8753
04:36:21,480 --> 04:36:21,780
Oh yeah.

8754
04:36:21,800 --> 04:36:23,840
They did all the global stuff in the day one.

8755
04:36:24,260 --> 04:36:24,740
Day one.

8756
04:36:24,740 --> 04:36:26,140
They didn't have a good foundation.

8757
04:36:26,460 --> 04:36:27,840
They didn't have a good foundation.

8758
04:36:27,900 --> 04:36:28,180
They didn't have a global...

8759
04:36:28,180 --> 04:36:29,600
They didn't have a process.

8760
04:36:29,600 --> 04:36:29,840
They didn't have a process.

8761
04:36:29,860 --> 04:36:31,440
They have to be trusted.

8762
04:36:32,640 --> 04:36:33,480
We actually...

8763
04:36:33,480 --> 04:36:35,960
We actually got the second most day two achievement points.

8764
04:36:36,580 --> 04:36:37,180
Let's go.

8765
04:36:37,380 --> 04:36:37,780
Whoa.

8766
04:36:37,780 --> 04:36:39,780
We just didn't get lucky pals.

8767
04:36:39,920 --> 04:36:45,020
I spent like six hours making that document yesterday.

8768
04:36:45,440 --> 04:36:45,840
I like...

8769
04:36:45,840 --> 04:36:49,940
Okay can someone tell me how Zentrea's team got zero day two achievement points?

8770
04:36:49,940 --> 04:36:50,440
Oh they left...

8771
04:36:50,440 --> 04:36:52,980
They forfeited day two.

8772
04:36:53,200 --> 04:36:53,440
Yeah.

8773
04:36:53,520 --> 04:36:54,560
Yeah because like...

8774
04:36:54,560 --> 04:36:54,920
What the fuck?

8775
04:36:54,920 --> 04:36:57,420
One of your teammates couldn't do day two so they forfeited.

8776
04:36:57,620 --> 04:36:58,000
Oh.

8777
04:36:58,060 --> 04:36:59,340
Why didn't they just send a new person?

8778
04:36:59,480 --> 04:36:59,840
I don't know.

8779
04:36:59,860 --> 04:37:01,620
I guess like it's so last minute.

8780
04:37:01,680 --> 04:37:05,200
Maybe because like is Iron Mouse the host of the world?

8781
04:37:05,280 --> 04:37:06,080
That could have been it.

8782
04:37:06,640 --> 04:37:07,200
Wait.

8783
04:37:07,320 --> 04:37:08,060
Wait they're typing.

8784
04:37:08,280 --> 04:37:09,440
They're typing now.

8785
04:37:09,660 --> 04:37:09,980
They're typing.

8786
04:37:10,080 --> 04:37:10,640
They're typing.

8787
04:37:10,780 --> 04:37:11,180
They're typing.

8788
04:37:11,520 --> 04:37:11,600
They're typing.

8789
04:37:11,600 --> 04:37:12,880
They're just like shut up.

8790
04:37:13,360 --> 04:37:16,280
They're like never invite team Doki again.

8791
04:37:16,360 --> 04:37:17,680
I'll be Tornado.

8792
04:37:17,680 --> 04:37:18,520
Flesh man.

8793
04:37:21,440 --> 04:37:22,560
Stupid trash.

8794
04:37:22,600 --> 04:37:24,820
Why am I only judged by my flesh?

8795
04:37:28,540 --> 04:37:29,100
You've...

8796
04:37:29,100 --> 04:37:29,840
You've...

8797
04:37:29,840 --> 04:37:31,700
You're just like this fucking flesh tuber.

8798
04:37:32,260 --> 04:37:34,820
He must be inciting them to revive.

8799
04:37:34,920 --> 04:37:37,000
Why can't they be saying these fucking pixels?

8800
04:37:39,040 --> 04:37:40,020
You're the one.

8801
04:37:40,100 --> 04:37:41,060
You're the one.

8802
04:37:41,060 --> 04:37:41,440
Shut up UwU.

8803
04:37:41,700 --> 04:37:44,680
You're the one who's like can we get partial points for when...

8804
04:37:44,680 --> 04:37:45,280
Fangaloo.

8805
04:37:45,560 --> 04:37:45,800
What the fuck?

8806
04:37:45,800 --> 04:37:49,240
Okay let me scroll up and see all the pictures you guys posted.

8807
04:37:50,040 --> 04:37:51,120
And the objection.

8808
04:37:51,480 --> 04:37:53,660
Wait I'm gonna take a photo of the whole...

8809
04:37:54,780 --> 04:37:56,260
I love this.

8810
04:37:57,120 --> 04:37:57,840
I love this.

8811
04:37:58,840 --> 04:37:59,820
I love this.

8812
04:38:02,640 --> 04:38:04,640
I'm just curious what they're gonna say.

8813
04:38:04,860 --> 04:38:05,420
Oh my god.

8814
04:38:05,420 --> 04:38:05,680
This is great.

8815
04:38:05,680 --> 04:38:09,220
Well apparently Overwatch is on top because Flats and Seagull were on...

8816
04:38:09,220 --> 04:38:11,540
Team Average Jonas' team.

8817
04:38:11,580 --> 04:38:12,000
Oh shit.

8818
04:38:12,560 --> 04:38:14,880
Yo go Overwatch too.

8819
04:38:15,340 --> 04:38:15,860
There we go.

8820
04:38:16,940 --> 04:38:18,800
What the fuck were they doing?

8821
04:38:19,200 --> 04:38:20,720
I like how they stopped typing.

8822
04:38:20,740 --> 04:38:21,520
Going Giga mode apparently.

8823
04:38:23,680 --> 04:38:24,240
Holy.

8824
04:38:24,520 --> 04:38:25,460
They probably did all...

8825
04:38:25,460 --> 04:38:29,420
They probably did all of those ones where you kill bosses with like the unique weapons.

8826
04:38:29,480 --> 04:38:29,800
I don't know.

8827
04:38:29,800 --> 04:38:30,800
No they did lucky pals.

8828
04:38:30,900 --> 04:38:32,320
They literally have 10 lucky pals.

8829
04:38:32,820 --> 04:38:33,300
What?

8830
04:38:33,540 --> 04:38:34,060
No but they have...

8831
04:38:34,060 --> 04:38:34,640
They have...

8832
04:38:34,640 --> 04:38:37,680
They have almost 2000 global achievements.

8833
04:38:37,960 --> 04:38:38,820
Oh shit.

8834
04:38:39,200 --> 04:38:39,580
What the fuck?

8835
04:38:39,680 --> 04:38:40,480
We only have 1600.

8836
04:38:42,660 --> 04:38:43,240
That's fine.

8837
04:38:43,480 --> 04:38:44,260
We had...

8838
04:38:44,260 --> 04:38:44,680
That's aight.

8839
04:38:44,940 --> 04:38:46,180
I can't believe it.

8840
04:38:46,300 --> 04:38:48,200
It's like this is mentioned on broadcast as well.

8841
04:38:48,800 --> 04:38:50,880
How will we be watching the broadcast?

8842
04:38:50,960 --> 04:38:51,500
We're playing.

8843
04:38:52,160 --> 04:38:54,800
What the fuck do I think I'm doing?

8844
04:39:00,210 --> 04:39:01,010
It's like...

8845
04:39:01,010 --> 04:39:02,490
I think it says it's mentioned on broadcast.

8846
04:39:02,510 --> 04:39:04,850
And I'm just like we're playing.

8847
04:39:05,090 --> 04:39:06,190
How do we know?

8848
04:39:10,030 --> 04:39:11,690
Guys, guys, can you shut the fuck up?

8849
04:39:11,770 --> 04:39:12,570
I'm trying to watch the broadcast.

8850
04:39:12,930 --> 04:39:13,570
Guys, please.

8851
04:39:13,630 --> 04:39:14,110
Silence.

8852
04:39:14,330 --> 04:39:15,630
He a dire wolf though.

8853
04:39:16,750 --> 04:39:17,450
Come on.

8854
04:39:17,450 --> 04:39:18,370
He is a dire wolf.

8855
04:39:23,110 --> 04:39:23,590
Okay.

8856
04:39:23,910 --> 04:39:24,650
It's fine.

8857
04:39:24,890 --> 04:39:26,090
We got top five.

8858
04:39:27,110 --> 04:39:28,750
I can't believe it though.

8859
04:39:28,810 --> 04:39:29,210
We got top five.

8860
04:39:29,210 --> 04:39:30,230
You mean top four.

8861
04:39:30,430 --> 04:39:30,690
Top four.

8862
04:39:30,690 --> 04:39:32,310
The goal was top five but with third.

8863
04:39:32,370 --> 04:39:32,490
Top four.

8864
04:39:32,510 --> 04:39:32,950
It's so close.

8865
04:39:33,030 --> 04:39:33,270
Yeah.

8866
04:39:33,270 --> 04:39:33,950
It hurts.

8867
04:39:33,950 --> 04:39:36,650
That's not really funny that surefour's luck.

8868
04:39:36,690 --> 04:39:38,290
Surefour definitely has zero luck.

8869
04:39:38,310 --> 04:39:39,510
If I just wasn't fucking unlucky.

8870
04:39:39,850 --> 04:39:40,150
Yeah.

8871
04:39:40,170 --> 04:39:42,290
Surefour is actually zero luck.

8872
04:39:42,450 --> 04:39:45,090
If he wasn't lucky, we would have been top three.

8873
04:39:45,410 --> 04:39:46,490
Holy shit.

8874
04:39:50,270 --> 04:39:51,670
That's actually crazy.

8875
04:39:52,310 --> 04:39:52,350
Yeah.

8876
04:39:52,350 --> 04:39:54,030
We're fucking top four.

8877
04:39:54,130 --> 04:39:54,330
No.

8878
04:39:54,830 --> 04:39:55,990
It's not good enough.

8879
04:39:56,270 --> 04:39:58,470
It doesn't have the same ring as top three.

8880
04:39:58,510 --> 04:39:59,170
What the heck?

8881
04:40:00,970 --> 04:40:01,770
I know.

8882
04:40:01,790 --> 04:40:02,490
It doesn't sound good.

8883
04:40:02,490 --> 04:40:03,830
I know.

8884
04:40:03,910 --> 04:40:06,630
It doesn't sound as good on the Twitter profile.

8885
04:40:08,070 --> 04:40:11,610
How am I supposed to drag the fourth place on my Twitter profile?

8886
04:40:11,790 --> 04:40:12,550
Come on, man.

8887
04:40:13,350 --> 04:40:18,070
My new title is top three asterisks if it wasn't for that damn fangalope glitch.

8888
04:40:24,090 --> 04:40:24,810
It's okay.

8889
04:40:24,950 --> 04:40:27,430
We're top three in your hearts, right chat?

8890
04:40:27,590 --> 04:40:29,190
In your hearts, we're top three.

8891
04:40:29,390 --> 04:40:30,150
Right chat.

8892
04:40:30,270 --> 04:40:30,670
Come on.

8893
04:40:30,670 --> 04:40:31,470
Right chat.

8894
04:40:31,470 --> 04:40:33,330
Type one of the top three.

8895
04:40:33,410 --> 04:40:34,690
Type one of the top three.

8896
04:40:34,750 --> 04:40:35,030
Okay.

8897
04:40:35,150 --> 04:40:36,190
I'm going to put top three.

8898
04:40:36,310 --> 04:40:38,490
I'm going to tweet out top three.

8899
04:40:38,610 --> 04:40:42,950
I can't believe we got top three in the power of the tribals.

8900
04:40:43,070 --> 04:40:43,170
Yeah.

8901
04:40:43,410 --> 04:40:43,990
There we go.

8902
04:40:44,230 --> 04:40:46,070
My chat is saying no.

8903
04:40:46,150 --> 04:40:47,750
My chat is saying no.

8904
04:40:47,750 --> 04:40:47,910
Yeah.

8905
04:40:47,910 --> 04:40:48,250
You're not probably.

8906
04:40:48,270 --> 04:40:50,210
Your chat doesn't believe in you.

8907
04:40:50,710 --> 04:40:51,510
Nobody asked.

8908
04:40:52,130 --> 04:40:54,030
They're saying last place in my heart.

8909
04:40:54,250 --> 04:40:56,530
Oh, last place in your heart.

8910
04:40:57,930 --> 04:40:58,930
Oh no.

8911
04:41:00,130 --> 04:41:01,130
Oh no.

8912
04:41:01,290 --> 04:41:01,450
Oh no.

8913
04:41:02,570 --> 04:41:03,850
Oh my God.

8914
04:41:04,010 --> 04:41:05,230
I can't believe.

8915
04:41:05,470 --> 04:41:05,750
You know what?

8916
04:41:05,930 --> 04:41:07,110
I'm proud of us though.

8917
04:41:07,250 --> 04:41:10,690
We went from top 10 to top three.

8918
04:41:12,450 --> 04:41:12,970
Crazy.

8919
04:41:12,970 --> 04:41:13,950
Started from the bottom.

8920
04:41:13,990 --> 04:41:14,550
Now we're here.

8921
04:41:14,690 --> 04:41:15,770
Started from the bottom.

8922
04:41:15,830 --> 04:41:17,070
We would have been top.

8923
04:41:17,070 --> 04:41:18,610
We were top two easily.

8924
04:41:18,830 --> 04:41:20,050
But fundamentals, man.

8925
04:41:20,250 --> 04:41:22,770
If surefork didn't get bugged like 500 times.

8926
04:41:23,310 --> 04:41:30,390
We should get extra points from me having to figure out a new strat during the first half yesterday because of ping.

8927
04:41:30,810 --> 04:41:31,450
Oh, my God.

8928
04:41:31,450 --> 04:41:34,550
That's a couple of pity points to get to top three easily.

8929
04:41:34,730 --> 04:41:36,450
Well, you are kind of asking for it.

8930
04:41:36,570 --> 04:41:36,850
Yeah.

8931
04:41:37,330 --> 04:41:38,370
We just didn't have an East Coast.

8932
04:41:38,370 --> 04:41:39,710
You are kind of asking for it.

8933
04:41:39,810 --> 04:41:42,210
We just didn't have an East Coast person here, unfortunately.

8934
04:41:45,950 --> 04:41:47,630
Well, I'll just host next time.

8935
04:41:47,650 --> 04:41:48,010
It's okay.

8936
04:41:48,250 --> 04:41:48,470
Yeah.

8937
04:41:48,470 --> 04:41:48,630
Yeah.

8938
04:41:48,630 --> 04:41:49,590
Next time we'll play.

8939
04:41:49,810 --> 04:41:50,310
No, thank you.

8940
04:41:50,350 --> 04:41:50,950
Yeah, we're good.

8941
04:41:51,070 --> 04:41:51,370
We're good.

8942
04:41:51,370 --> 04:41:52,050
No, thank you.

8943
04:41:53,350 --> 04:41:54,390
What the heck, guys?

8944
04:41:55,330 --> 04:41:56,510
I'm an FPS guy.

8945
04:41:56,590 --> 04:41:57,670
Ping is all that matters to me.

8946
04:41:57,670 --> 04:41:59,450
Mom said it's my turn on the host box.

8947
04:42:00,710 --> 04:42:01,110
Denied.

8948
04:42:01,110 --> 04:42:01,410
Denied.

8949
04:42:01,450 --> 04:42:04,150
No, move to NA for one day.

8950
04:42:04,350 --> 04:42:06,450
Come to NA for Twitch Rivals.

8951
04:42:07,430 --> 04:42:09,270
I'll just play out real quick spontaneously.

8952
04:42:09,270 --> 04:42:13,210
Yeah, just fly out for like two days and then go do a PC ping.

8953
04:42:14,010 --> 04:42:18,550
I'm not going to let the person that just found out they were on a 60 hertz monitor host my game.

8954
04:42:24,810 --> 04:42:25,490
You know.

8955
04:42:25,830 --> 04:42:26,990
He's not right.

8956
04:42:28,030 --> 04:42:29,910
No, I don't agree with him.

8957
04:42:29,930 --> 04:42:30,590
What the heck.

8958
04:42:30,590 --> 04:42:32,250
He's not right.

8959
04:42:32,630 --> 04:42:33,010
I don't think.

8960
04:42:33,010 --> 04:42:33,170
I don't think.

8961
04:42:33,170 --> 04:42:33,570
I don't think.

8962
04:42:33,570 --> 04:42:34,730
You're the type of the fleshy.

8963
04:42:37,650 --> 04:42:39,550
I'm a hybrid of everything.

8964
04:42:40,010 --> 04:42:40,850
A hybrid?

8965
04:42:43,310 --> 04:42:43,990
No.

8966
04:42:46,810 --> 04:42:50,050
The 60 hertz is going to follow me for a hot second.

8967
04:42:51,270 --> 04:42:53,430
It's clipped forever, Lily.

8968
04:42:53,590 --> 04:42:54,950
It's there forever.

8969
04:42:56,690 --> 04:42:58,830
Hey, GG, you guys.

8970
04:42:59,290 --> 04:43:02,350
I had a great time with all of you.

8971
04:43:02,370 --> 04:43:02,890
Amazing.

8972
04:43:03,710 --> 04:43:04,990
Seriously, amazing.

8973
04:43:05,310 --> 04:43:06,290
Thank you.

8974
04:43:06,710 --> 04:43:09,990
When we screamed at each other.

8975
04:43:10,230 --> 04:43:12,150
The last three minutes.

8976
04:43:12,930 --> 04:43:14,190
Oh, that's what you meant.

8977
04:43:14,370 --> 04:43:16,810
I don't put the chicken in the weapon slot?

8978
04:43:17,250 --> 04:43:17,970
What do you mean?

8979
04:43:18,070 --> 04:43:22,020
The chicken in the weapon slot.

8980
04:43:22,200 --> 04:43:24,840
The chicken in the weapon slot.

8981
04:43:26,680 --> 04:43:30,250
I can't believe it.

8982
04:43:30,350 --> 04:43:32,250
Those 30 seconds actually.

8983
04:43:32,950 --> 04:43:36,330
Those 30 seconds actually ruined Sheriforce's luck.

8984
04:43:36,370 --> 04:43:37,490
His luck went to negative.

8985
04:43:37,510 --> 04:43:38,010
I'm sorry.

8986
04:43:38,010 --> 04:43:41,890
I was on the second tick from catching it.

8987
04:43:41,950 --> 04:43:44,070
And it fucking didn't capture me.

8988
04:43:45,030 --> 04:43:47,290
Well, if it hadn't bugged, it wouldn't have been an issue.

8989
04:43:47,410 --> 04:43:49,670
Because I was literally on the emote wheel.

8990
04:43:49,790 --> 04:43:51,070
Being like, where's the butcher one?

8991
04:43:51,150 --> 04:43:52,090
It's supposed to be here, right?

8992
04:43:53,010 --> 04:43:54,910
And then I got hurt with confusion.

8993
04:43:55,070 --> 04:43:55,770
I was like, what do you mean?

8994
04:43:55,830 --> 04:43:57,310
Put the chicken in the weapon slot.

8995
04:43:57,310 --> 04:43:58,670
I was like, LOCK UP!

8996
04:43:59,110 --> 04:44:00,190
LOCK THE FUCK UP!

8997
04:44:02,510 --> 04:44:05,130
What do you mean put the chicken in the weapon slot?

8998
04:44:06,570 --> 04:44:07,290
I can't.

8999
04:44:07,390 --> 04:44:07,750
I can't.

9000
04:44:07,750 --> 04:44:07,990
I can't.

9001
04:44:08,010 --> 04:44:09,830
It's cheat cheese everyone.

9002
04:44:10,590 --> 04:44:12,990
I'm so happy you guys were all on my team.

9003
04:44:13,370 --> 04:44:14,450
Thank you guys.

9004
04:44:15,010 --> 04:44:16,570
Thank you for being good.

9005
04:44:16,730 --> 04:44:18,170
It was really cool.

9006
04:44:18,350 --> 04:44:18,870
It was so fun.

9007
04:44:19,230 --> 04:44:22,090
Thank you guys for joining the team.

9008
04:44:22,790 --> 04:44:23,710
It was great.

9009
04:44:24,050 --> 04:44:26,310
What was the fucking rap song?

9010
04:44:28,170 --> 04:44:30,830
I'm not a big fan of the government rap.

9011
04:44:30,830 --> 04:44:33,250
I'm not a big fan of the government rap.

9012
04:44:33,250 --> 04:44:34,830
I'm not a big fan of the government rap.

9013
04:44:34,830 --> 04:44:35,530
I'm not a big fan of the government rap.

9014
04:44:35,530 --> 04:44:35,770
Chat, chat.

9015
04:44:35,930 --> 04:44:37,750
I can't figure out what the acronym is for that.

9016
04:44:38,010 --> 04:44:38,590
I'm not a big fan of all those letters.

9017
04:44:40,210 --> 04:44:41,250
I'm dyslexic.

9018
04:44:41,650 --> 04:44:42,790
I'm dyslexic.

9019
04:44:42,790 --> 04:44:43,330
What are those letters?

9020
04:44:43,770 --> 04:44:47,430
I'm not a big fan of the government.

9021
04:44:48,470 --> 04:44:50,070
See you had to type that in too.

9022
04:44:50,170 --> 04:44:50,790
I'm not stupid.

9023
04:44:52,550 --> 04:44:53,070
What?

9024
04:44:54,790 --> 04:44:56,890
NBF Vapnibofager.

9025
04:44:59,090 --> 04:44:59,610
Vapnibofager.

9026
04:44:59,870 --> 04:45:01,090
Team Vapnibofager.

9027
04:45:01,170 --> 04:45:02,670
Team Vapnibofager.

9028
04:45:02,930 --> 04:45:03,590
Let's go.

9029
04:45:06,330 --> 04:45:06,950
Let's go.

9030
04:45:08,010 --> 04:45:08,430
Hey GG's guys.

9031
04:45:08,430 --> 04:45:12,030
I hope we meet again in a tribal.

9032
04:45:12,210 --> 04:45:13,190
See you when I see you.

9033
04:45:13,990 --> 04:45:15,330
I'll see you guys later.

9034
04:45:15,430 --> 04:45:17,030
I'm going to go talk to my chat now.

9035
04:45:17,270 --> 04:45:17,910
GG's guys.

9036
04:45:18,010 --> 04:45:18,650
Wait, are we confirmed?

9037
04:45:19,150 --> 04:45:20,890
We're confirmed for if we're confirmed.

9038
04:45:21,110 --> 04:45:21,970
I think so.

9039
04:45:22,630 --> 04:45:24,610
They're like, you're third in my heart.

9040
04:45:26,050 --> 04:45:27,810
If you're not first, you're last.

9041
04:45:28,810 --> 04:45:31,030
We were never going to get first or fourth.

9042
04:45:31,030 --> 04:45:31,810
We're fucking last.

9043
04:45:32,890 --> 04:45:33,330
Losers.

9044
04:45:36,190 --> 04:45:36,890
GG's guys.

9045
04:45:38,010 --> 04:45:39,590
I'll see you.

9046
04:45:39,890 --> 04:45:40,590
See you.

9047
04:45:40,870 --> 04:45:41,030
Bye.

9048
04:45:41,730 --> 04:45:42,530
Bye.

9049
04:45:45,470 --> 04:45:49,590
Oh my god.

9050
04:45:49,690 --> 04:45:51,450
I can't believe it.

9051
04:45:51,450 --> 04:45:52,890
My first Twitch Rivals.

9052
04:45:53,030 --> 04:45:53,950
That's dopey.

9053
04:45:53,970 --> 04:45:55,190
We got top three.

9054
04:45:56,570 --> 04:45:59,470
It was top three guys.

9055
04:45:59,730 --> 04:46:01,730
I can't believe it everyone.

9056
04:46:01,930 --> 04:46:04,030
Top fucking three.

9057
04:46:05,770 --> 04:46:06,490
Plus one.

9058
04:46:11,790 --> 04:46:12,670
Holy shit.

9059
04:46:12,710 --> 04:46:13,590
That was so fun.

9060
04:46:13,830 --> 04:46:15,710
I still can't believe it.

9061
04:46:15,770 --> 04:46:19,090
The last three minutes we were just screaming at each other.

9062
04:46:19,270 --> 04:46:20,750
We were just like, guys.

9063
04:46:23,690 --> 04:46:24,250
Please.

9064
04:46:26,110 --> 04:46:28,470
And sureforye was just yelling at PP.

9065
04:46:28,570 --> 04:46:29,470
Like, log out.

9066
04:46:29,630 --> 04:46:31,150
Log out for the love of god.

9067
04:46:31,210 --> 04:46:32,110
Just log out.

9068
04:46:34,050 --> 04:46:35,850
The fucking chicken.

9069
04:46:36,190 --> 04:46:37,890
The chicken that fucking.

9070
04:46:37,890 --> 04:46:37,990
I'm going to go to bed.

9071
04:46:37,990 --> 04:46:38,530
He fucked us all.

9072
04:46:39,510 --> 04:46:40,970
Oh my god.

9073
04:46:41,130 --> 04:46:44,670
We got hard fucked over by the chicken.

9074
04:46:44,930 --> 04:46:46,490
Of all things.

9075
04:46:46,490 --> 04:46:48,550
That motherfucking chicken.

9076
04:46:50,230 --> 04:46:53,490
I got the chicken in the weapon slot.

9077
04:46:54,130 --> 04:46:55,470
Holy shit.

9078
04:46:55,670 --> 04:46:57,870
That was so fucking funny though.

9079
04:46:57,970 --> 04:46:59,110
Oh my god.

9080
04:47:00,690 --> 04:47:01,750
Oh my god.

9081
04:47:01,810 --> 04:47:02,110
I swear.

9082
04:47:02,210 --> 04:47:02,930
I need to look at this.

9083
04:47:03,330 --> 04:47:05,770
How many points did the chicken even get us?

9084
04:47:05,930 --> 04:47:07,150

That's true.

9107
04:47:53,310 --> 04:47:54,890
The content was worth it.

9108
04:47:54,950 --> 04:47:56,010
