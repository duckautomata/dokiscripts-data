13
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,640
Seekers land, or maybe...

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Do they land in one POI?

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,980
I feel like you should, right?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,260
right they should land on one po i just so well actually
they stay in the ship until the very last second yeah so we

If the Krabber responds, we need to throw it off the map.

189
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,790
Okay, two of the shooters are shooting right now, and I
didn't hear anything, so they're nowhere near us.

probability wise i would survive more over that side.

213
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,460
I'm very bad at math, but probability-wise, I think I'd
survive.

214
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,040
Also, we have purple.

215
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,840
I don't think we're getting red.

216
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,700
Might as well just chill.

217
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,100
Yeah, but we can get intel.

218
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,340
Friendly.

219
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,860
Friendly.

220
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,320
Do I have enough meds for this?

221
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:50,860
Yes, I do.

222
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Okay, it's round one.

223
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,400
They're chilling.

224
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,100
Yeah, I have syringes.

225
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,520
Oh, it would be a smart idea to carry guns.

226
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,600
Just to be like, Hey, just to have all the friends run away.

227
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,800
No, no, no.

228
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,540
Just so they don't think it's you, you know?

229
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,700
There's a solo on a balloon.

230
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,260
Sounds solo on a balloon.

231
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,060
But they're all on the same team.

232
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,440
What do you mean they don't think it's you?

233
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:16,900
They do.

234
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,880
Yeah, they won't know.

235
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,100
They won't know, bro.

236
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,720
They'll just be like, you have a gun.

237
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,840
Oh, he's got a gun.

238
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,880
No, that's a friendly thing.

239
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,060
You see a gun in your back and they're going to run away
from you.

240
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,080
And then you're going to lead them to the actual seekers.

241
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,220
There's no rules against it.

242
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,880
It just says we can't shoot.

243
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,120
Just says we can't shoot guys.

244
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,060
Says we can't shoot people.

245
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,560
Yeah, and also NPCs.

246
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,600
And PvE.

247
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,700
Yeah, we can't shoot the NPC.

248
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,680
Okay, I'm scanning the ring for us, getting that intel.

249
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,160
Pulls away.

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,480
Guys, I might have- Oh, hey, you guys are in zone.

251
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,360
It's possibly the worst spot for hiding.

252
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,840
Where is my seek zone ever?

253
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:11,420

He's right.

That's him.

269
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:04,920
That's him.

270
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,740
That's definitely him.

271
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,180
I'm out.

272
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,780
You guys gotta run.

273
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,100
I'm not moving.

274
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,720
Hide and seek.

275
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,120
Wait, somebody made a zip here.

276
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,100
That's scary.

277
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,520
Alright, if I run straight on, I'll, and I might be dead.

278
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't know.

279
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,420
You're advantage.

280
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,760
You're fine.

281
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,700
Just remember your ability.

282
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,700
You want to have your bird in your pocket already and then
you hold it down, okay?

283
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,220
You don't like to re-throw it out.

284
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,560
Okay, hey, I have my, I didn't even realize the bird was
already out.

285
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,040
Whoops, I hope the scout.

286
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,500
Yeah, you gotta have the bird in the pocket and then you
gotta hold down the button.

287
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,760
It's, that's the rule.

288
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,020
The bird was already out, guys.

289
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,540
The bird was already out.

290
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,000
We'll put it back in the pocket.

291
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,540
All right.

292
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,700
Oh, there's another guy here with me.

293
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,840

294
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,440
Oh my god, there's several people here with me.

00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,640

It's okay.

300
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,900
Time seek.

449
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,120
Yeah, not going to lie.

Come on.

452
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,600

453
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,540
I believe in you.

454
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,720

461
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,320
Drop him at his own phone.

462
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,560
That guy died right next to you.

463
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,900
He literally died right next to you.

464
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,340
Top 10.

465
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,020
We're top 10.

466
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,920
It doesn't matter.

467
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Anyway, but we're still top 10.

468
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,020
We need top 3.

469
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,600
We need top 3.

470
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,280
What do we do with top 3?

471
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,360
Top 3 is the only placement that matters.

472
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,840
We're going to charity even harder.

473
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,780

476
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,880
I don't know.

477
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,620
That Pathfinder's evil.

478
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,000
It's okay.

479
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,440
Okay, we got top 10.

480
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,980
Why did he come back?

481
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,800
The path, dude.

482
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,680
What the fuck?

483
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,080
How did he not see this guy?

484
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,600
I should have gotten that Pathfinder killed.

485
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,000
I should have went for the Pathfinder.

486
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,520
Yeah, you should have.

487
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,460

491
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,640

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,140
Was that Tempo and Path, bro?

493
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,940
What was that?

494
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,660
I don't know.

495
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,500
I'm pretty sure the path died.

496
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,960
Oh my god, he did it!

497
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,380
That guy literally stood in between the rocks.

498
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,380
Yeah, he stood still for so long.

499
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,100
I can't believe it.

500
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,060
This is a scam.

501
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,340
I'm playing altar.

502
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,320
I got scammed.

503
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
This is where we got scammed.

504
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,540
We got scammed for charity.

505
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,320
That dude sold.

506
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
That dude sold my spot.

507
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,280
I shouldn't have moved if I didn't move.

508
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,020
True.

509
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,560
Yeah, he heard you.

510
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,840
He heard your fucking movement.

511
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,860
It's okay, guys.

512
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,340
We placed higher than Nocturnal's team.

513
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,780
Honestly, in life, that's all that matters.

514
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,680
Yeah, that's all that matters.

515
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,380
That's why I'm the better IGO.

516
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,500
Dude, they had 71 kills.

517
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:09,960
Holy shit.

518
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:10,940
All right.

519
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,300
Holy moly.

520
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,140
Hey, we got top 10.

521
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,480
Let's fucking go.

522
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:21,990
Who was it?

523
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,230
Where's Dolphin's team?

524
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,250
Oh, was he the guy that, like, riding you out?

525
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,390
Won't let me.

526
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,630
Won't let me view his skin.

527
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,250
Oh, is the lobby broken?

528
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,570
Wait, how is it broken?

529
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:35,850
The in-progress.

530
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,470
Can hiders pick up ammo?

531
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,550
No.

532
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,350
Why are we...

533
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,130
Oh, yes.

534
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,650
They're running out of ammo.

535
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,530
They're shooting us.

536
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,550
Yeah, fuck you guys.

537
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,110
You don't deserve ammo.

538
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,170
Zach Mazer, you're trying to kill my friends.

539
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,050
No, I won't help you.

540
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,970
Go craft your ammo.

541
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,350
If someone said I'm not a Fortnite lava.

542
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,690
Yeah, if you run out of ammo, just fucking punch.

543
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,670
We will take the Krayer.

544
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,330
All right, what map is in it next?

545
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,390
There's no.

546
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,730
One of them.

547
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,250
One of them.

548
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,010
I don't know the order, actually.

549
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:20,910
Oh, I'm muted.

550
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:21,950
It is King's Canyon.

551
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,830
King's Canyon?

552
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,550
Oh, okay.

553
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,870
Same comp.

554
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,190
Oh, I'm going to alter.

555
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:27,950
Okay, okay.

556
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,990
I'll be vantage.

557
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,850
I'll start.

558
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,890
and everything.

559
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,750
Yay.

560
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:41,210
I bet you the people who aren't there just haven't didn't
wake up in time.

561
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,070
True.

562
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,250
What if we just play res comp and they run out of ammo?

563
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,210
That's so true.

564
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:46,550
Okay.

565
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,550
It was three strikes.

566
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,370
I'd be down.

567
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:49,950
Yeah.

568
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,490
I'll do it.

569
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,390
That's why Newcastle.

570
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,790
Like what's like they're going to run out of bullets, right?

571
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,270
Yeah, but that means we got to stick together.

572
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,510
Three people running in a pack is not hiding.

573
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,430
I mean like those Just one guy is chasing us.

574
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,550
We just keep resting.

575
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,890
Just keep dancing on the shield.

576
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,470
Wait, actually.

577
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,790
Just keep resting.

578
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,030
Actually.

579
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,430
Okay, what happens in Final Zone, though?

580
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,690
What about Final Zone?

581
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,030
We're still alive.

582
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,730
We wall off ourselves.

583
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,170
We swallow ourselves against the rock.

584
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,670
Oh, you're right.

585
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,850
We outnumber them by sheer willpower.

586
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,210
out.

587
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:35,530
All right.

588
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,470
We'll see.

589
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,310
We'll see how this goes.

590
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,250
No, we should do it for one game at least.

591
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,710
Do it when we get a car.

592
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,510
When we get- Oh my god, yes!

593
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,270
On Storm Point.

594
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,250
Storm Point, Storm Point.

595
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,130
Newcastle, Newcastle, Lifeline, and who's the third?

596
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,270
Did you just play Watson?

597
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,090
Just give us a J.

598
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,050
Can we give a Jinn on the car?

599
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,850
Yeah, give us a Jinn on the car.

600
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,350
No, I don't think so.

601
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,590
I think it only has the one spot on top.

602
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,130
Put it on the front and the...

603
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,930
Wait, can we not put it on the back?

604
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:07,930
I don't think so.

605
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,350
You're right.

606
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,970
You might be able to.

607
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:09,970
Wait, we could try.

608
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,970
We might as well.

609
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,170
The armored car strat.

610
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,970
If we're going to have a car, we have to play Lifeline,
though.

611
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,450
Wait, you might want to...

612
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,450
Wait, I might want to play Path for this map.

613
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,870
When King's Canyon...

614
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,230
She can zip over.

615
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,130
I'm playing Alter.

616
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,290
Yeah, I'm playing Vantage.

617
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:27,730
Don't worry.

618
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,450
We got this.

619
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,130
The heavy armored car strat.

620
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:39,450
armored car strap rampart walls on we just like gibby run we
just like gibby car we just like gibby car they can't kill

621
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:49,130
us no i'm not even kidding wait that's true wait what do we
do gibby newcastle lifeline i mean i'm we'll hide in the

622
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:56,870
open yeah hide in a car in the open they can't get us or
should we do like gibby newcastle watson or gibby newcastle

623
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,290
yeah well it's probably maybe we skip newcastle maybe just
do gibby lifeline Watson.

624
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,770
Oh, give me lifeline.

625
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,250
That red is going to be very tricky.

626
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,470
No, no, no, no.

627
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,170
It's not for the reds.

628
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:08,710
It's not for the reds.

629
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,230
It's for the car.

630
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,370
We just live in a car forever.

631
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,910
The car is our reds.

632
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,090
Okay, give me lifeline.

633
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,790
Watson.

634
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,030
Nice.

635
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,510
Don't we got it, guys.

636
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,710
We perfected the strat.

637
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,350
Because the thing you have to think about, right?

638
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,370
The seekers aren't working together.

639
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,370
And if we're in a car, how are they going to kill us all out
of a car?

640
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,370
Oh, that's true.

641
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,110
That is so fucking true.

642
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,530
I feel like we should get another car just to distract the
main car yeah but then we don't have bubble on both cars

643
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:42,410
we're living because we have bubble no no no the lifeline
the lifeline gets away but then what the what's the point of

644
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:51,430
having a lifeline we can't rest all i'm saying is that we
could have one proof i feel like we couldn't like at first

645
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:58,110
we start off with two cars and then use the other car to
distract people and then after the zone starts getting

646
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:09,130
smaller we like we go we we we merge we merge our cars there
are no cars in kc i know we're planning yeah we're planning

647
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:19,570
yeah yeah we're 50 steps ahead of the seekers this game
we're gonna be tree gang yeah oh you're right you're right

648
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:28,430
to be shitty at trees wait that means like every all of them
will think that we're in trees but I'll be like in the open

649
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,790
because they'll know I'm not expected.

650
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,410
They'll be too busy looking up.

651
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,750
They just won't even look at the actual map.

652
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:35,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

653
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,930
They won't expect looking up.

654
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,430
I wish there was pruning in this game.

655
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:39,930
I would just prune.

656
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,670
They would never see me.

657
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,530
We should land somewhere with holds.

658
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,050
Brew.

659
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,350
Well, I thought you were going to be at map room.

660
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,630
You're going to let me know.

661
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,050
Brew.

662
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,110
What happened to the map room?

663
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:52,710
Wait, fun.

664
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,710
We can do the double hold.

665
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:54,730
Yeah.

666
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,470
Double evil on the hold and then hit map.

667
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:09,770
map room for insta blue oh true but you don't even need to
play advantage you can play play movement because we can hit

668
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:23,690
map room on this map shows us the world I hope map room is
not in zone so I'm I hope I hope map room was just out of

669
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:36,850
zone you got to start pointing your alt at people at high
other hiders for the seeker oh you're right oh it's first we

670
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,190

672
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:54,070

they fixed the crash but i think you can still go through

673
00:36:54,070 --> 00:37:00,490
with all three guys i feel like it was we all live in map
room i feel like all the seekers are just gonna run mock 10

died for his last game too.

680
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,050
I don't think that guy knows how to hide.

681
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,150
I think he just lands wherever the secret is.

682
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,110
He's just like, oh, there's nobody going over here.

683
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,850
Let me go over here.

684
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,150
Yeah.

685
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:10,770
All right.

686
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,770
We'll know where the secrets are from this.

687
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,930
Why is everybody an air base?

688
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,130
What the fuck?

689
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,810
What's wrong with them?

690
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,930
The game ends, I guess.

691
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,830
What's wrong with them?

692
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,170
Oh my god, an air base ending?

693
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:23,710
We need to go.

694
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,570
We need to go on the outside under the stairs.

695
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,050
Okay.

696
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:26,730
Don't worry, guys.

698
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,590
Don't worry.

00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,530
Oh, do you want to go get the hold over here, South?

700

We got this.

701
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,430
All right, I'm going to head to Relic for more scans.

702
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,970
All right, if I die, don't come to Relic.

703
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,210
Good gums.

704
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,370
No, it's okay.

705
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,790
I think they're going to murder Air Base first.

706
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,330
Yeah, they have to.

707
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,810

I think the infinite one, because it's so hard to see.

728
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,710
That's true.

729
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,670
Dude, we can go put it in Endgame and run away.

730
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,410

I punched him on accident.

782
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:03,770
dude why are we playing rev and using havoc they're on rev
path because they're competing against each other yeah

783
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:12,170
because they they get to win more for charity yeah first
place seeker wins 10 grand yeah for charity right yeah i was

784
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:22,990
gonna say if they get 10 grand alone and like none of us win
any money that'd be so up how does tournament even work so

785
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:32,970
like the the the seeker that kills the most people basically
they get to uh choose like 10 pick a charity to donate 10

786
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:40,490
grand to of the choice um and the hiders team that wins the
most points behind the most gets to pick the charity we want

787
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:50,210
to donate to that's basically it chat i'm sorry fun i'm just
getting havoced i'm too far away from you to get your i

788
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:57,350
don't know if this is a smart decision so like let's hope
that for me and not you.

789
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,130
I'm just going to kill somebody.

790
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,190
I don't give a fuck.

791
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,470
For charity.

792
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:03,310
What are you going to do?

793
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,850
Deduct your money from charity?

794
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:05,810
Yeah, right.

795
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:07,830
That's a mirage.

796
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,070
You know a secret we never played mirage.

797
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,090
They can't take money away from charity.

798
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,810
It's fun.

799
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,410
No, but tempo can punish me, so whatever.

800
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:26,110
Guys, by the way, guys, have you heard about Nokia 8?

801
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:39,390
the Nokia Wi-Fi modem where you can play tournaments like
this over Wi-Fi Wow we're so fucked I love Wi-Fi I love

802
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:52,910
Wi-Fi to you guys we're all on Wi-Fi here all every single
one of us is on Wi-Fi you think I can do a ring scan oh I

803
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,590
don't like the sound of that.

804
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:55,470
That was me.

805
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:56,470
Oh, the hell is you?

806
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,370
I'm just letting you know we're over here.

807
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:01,590
Wait, what?

808
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,150
I definitely don't like the sound of that.

809
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,350
I fucked up my echo, but that's okay.

810
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,470
Wait I think I might die the zone, so that's not okay.

811
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,230
I don't know, you're fine.

812
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:13,730
It's only zone two.

813
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:14,270
You'll be good.

814
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,230
Oh.

815
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,170
You're okay.

816
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,990
It's odd.

817
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:22,810
Um.

818
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:41,410
what what what you can't just say um what is it is a is a
seeker dead wait what why the chat said luda died how did he

819
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:50,070

timmy wait he fell oh my god he fucking fell how do you fall

821
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:12,710
there's like nowhere to fall oh there's definitely ways to
fall off the map what but like it's probably an air base

822
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:24,170
just fell off the map or some oh that's pretty stupid well
it's just timmy versus uh versus people What happens if all

823
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,210
the seekers fall?

824
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:26,550
Oh, that would be great.

825
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,870
What if I just carry this gun around?

826
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,050
Then everyone wins.

827
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:32,910
Alright, let's see.

828
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:35,350

Do it.

00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:38,730
I don't think I can.

832
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:39,890
It does, it does, it does.

833
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,010
That spot you had it.

Yeah, outside the window.

854
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,870
You could go up above the window.

855
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,970
That guy has an energized tip.

856
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:07,690
I don't like that.

857
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:08,970
That's not...

858
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,130
Energize is good.

859
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:10,690
Energize is good.

860
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,310
I'm pretty sure the path is dead.

861
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,810
Because Timmy's on Rev.

862
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:15,470
Timmy's on me!

863
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,230
Timmy's on me!

864
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,390
Don't come here!

865
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:18,770
Don't come here!

866
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,610
Timmy's on me!

867
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:22,450
But you know the spot I'm talking about?

868
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:34,430
like right here yeah and then you can go up and down freely
but there's also the other one as well as like the alco man

869
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:43,130
if only i had that beacon there it wasn't close enough to
you if only i had that beacon

870
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,370
go to the other one the other one's better i think because
there's a ledge

871
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,500
That's a friendly person.

872
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,520
No, it's not.

873
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,660
That's gunfire.

874
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,740
That is so friendly.

875
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,180
That's not friendly, people.

876
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,020
Bro, that was obviously Debbie.

877
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,860
What the fuck?

878
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,500
I thought it was a friendly person.

879
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,760
Wait, Peep's dead.

880
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,320
Finish her, finish her, finish her.

881
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,240
Wait, how did he die?

882
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,620
Wait, oh, I could have lived.

883
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,440
I'm sad enough.

884
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,920
How did he die?

885
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,760
He died to zone because he's a noob and he stimmed himself
to death.

886
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,540
Really?

887
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,240
Yeah.

888
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,140
You could have won that.

889
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,760
Oh, wait.

890
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,600
Wait, I think Timmy could die then.

891
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,180
He doesn't have the ammo for this.

892
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,720
Boom Razzle punched him too.

893
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,020
Timmy's just get bullied.

894
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,880
Well Timmy could literally just win the charity tournament
right now by farming all these people.

895
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,020
I think, I'm gonna be honest.

896
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,720
I think he's already won.

897
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,300
Yeah.

898
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,580

00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,240
Here you go, guys.

00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,660

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,140
I'm watching it live with you guys.

915
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:44,960
Let's see.

916
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,700

917
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:56,960
Wait.

918
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,980
Wait a minute.

919
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,180
What?

920
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,600
Wait.

921
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,680
Oh my god.

922
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,880
That is actually amazing.

923
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:06,620
Holy shit.

924
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:07,820
Oh my god.

925
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,460
That's actually crazy.

926
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,000
Bro.

927
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:22,780
All I'm saying is if you get if you get fucking baited off
the map, you should get rotated out.

928
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,940
You die to zone, you lose secret privileges.

929
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,440
You lose secret privileges.

930
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,860
Bro, all the hiders should just gank up on him and just
punch him out.

931
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,800
One, one seeker left.

932
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:38,620
Yeah.

933
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,400
When it gets to ring six, the hiders can fight back.

934
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,960
The hiders should all just punch him into the zone.

935
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,960
We're gonna do the zombies after round five.

936
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,980
They should just like all surround him.

937
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,020
No, because there's gonna be- He's just waiting.

938
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:53,760
He's just waiting.

939
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,140
There's gonna be more hiders.

940
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,500
So he should like, the seeker, the hiders should just like,
bodyguard.

He's concerned.

945
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,940
He's like, Loba, put your ult down now.

946
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,360
Loba, put your ult down or I won't shoot.

947
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,740
Bro, I don't even think an ult's gonna help them.

948
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,520
I don't know.

949
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,320
Wait, that guy's just resting right next?

950
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,580
I don't think he has bullets.

951
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:53,140
He's trying so hard to find ammo.

952
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
The secret's hiding.

953
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,560
The thermite.

954
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,420
A thermite.

955
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,020
A thermite.

956
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,840
Oh my god, that's E-Rom.

957
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,800
Can I just start meleeing people?

958
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:05,680
Oh, an R-9?

959
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:06,920
Melee them?

960
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,620
Bro, oh, that's a waste of ammo, Timmy.

961
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,600
You shouldn't be wasting ammo like this.

962
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,500
Might as well do finishers.

963
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,700
You're losing ammo.

964
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,480
He's losing time right now.

965
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,300
He's losing time.

966
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,860
There's still 16 squads and 200 res beacons.

967
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,720
There's still 32 people alive.

968
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,580
You think I was really...

969
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,740
I mean, I could have lived in this book.

970
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,520
I drolled.

971
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,700
Who the fuck had a gun on them?

972
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,980
Okay, this is duck gun now.

973
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,340
He tried grappling.

974
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,700
Wait, that was a crazy jump.

975
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,620
He said, hello.

976
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,500
Hello.

977
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,400
Poor Timmy.

978
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,720
He was like, maybe he has ammo.

979
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,360
What are the odds?

980
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:58,580
Bro, he's over sensitive right now.

981
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,200
He's overwhelmed.

982
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,040
There's too many people going around.

983
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,280
You gotta finish the job, Timmy.

984
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,780
Where the fuck is you?

985
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:08,900
Wait,

00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:12,760

987
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,900
Oh, that was a good shot.

988
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,600
It was Mandy.

989
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,560
Oh, my God, you're right.

990
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:27,020
I died three times, which meant like, I made him waste his
ammo three times on my body.

991
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:27,600
Yeah, true.

992
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:39,940
but I mean he should just give up at this point like there's
no he's not killing anybody else he's like thank you no but

What are you seeing?

997
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,260
The grenade.

998
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,100
The singular grenade.

999
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,100
Secret grenade.

1000
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,480
It's the old.

1001
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,700
They're fucking pushing him out of zone.

1002
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,180
They're the grenade in the air.

1003
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,300
Oh god, they're all dead.

1004
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,800

No way.

1008
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,000
Wait, Timmy's gonna die early.

1009
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,500
No, Timmy's gonna die early.

1010
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,400
Jimmy died!

1011
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,660
What is this?

1012
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,900
Look at that, those bodies.

1013
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,800
Okay, that was crazy.

1014
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,380
It was fucking crazy.

1015
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:43,880
Dude, you just whip out the wats at all.

1016
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,100
Dude, I played caustic.

1017
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,700
I played caustic.

1018
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,500
Oh my god.

1019
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,960
Oh my god.

1020
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,120
Play caustic and kill nobody.

1021
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,700
You're not the one to do damage ability though.

1022
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,900
No, no, as a seeker, you just don't even, you don't even
seek.

1023
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,500
Yeah, you just wait until end.

1024
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,080
zone.

1025
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,600
That only works because two people died to zero, did they
ever fall off the map?

1026
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,820
Holy shit, I can't believe that happened for the Seeker
team.

1027
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,100
Glad we aren't doing Olympus.

1028
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,260
At Seekers.

1029
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,180
Rotate Seekers.

1030
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:25,300
Embarrassing.

1031
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,060
Bad macro.

1032
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,360
Timmy's like looking for two.

1033
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,460
I volunteer.

1034
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:45,920
As the newly assigned NRG member, I'd never die to zone.

1035
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,760
I can't be like, who did that?

1036
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,760
Who baited Luda?

1037
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:02,430
Who even bait?

1038
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:05,710
Does anyone know who baited Luda there for that to happen?

1039
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,910
Is that whoever that guy is he's a fucking king

1040
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,760
Oh apparently was linkser Linkser did it.

1041
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,200
It was a link.

1042
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,760
Yeah, yeah, apparently it was linkser

1043
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,640
Linkser you baited

1044
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:41,520
DQ game for the kill so wait that was gonna kill oh probably
just from I don't even know how you'd get a kill on

1045
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:41,960
accident.

1046
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,030
How did Peep die?

1047
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:51,810
Peep died his own.

1048
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:52,570
He died his own.

1049
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:53,870
He literally...

1050
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,850
He stimmed himself down to one and then died his own.

1051
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:57,030
Yeah.

1052
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,090
I feel like that's like...

1053
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,750
Dolphin had to leak troubling them.

1054
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,250
I feel like that's almost as embarrassing as getting...

1055
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,890
No, that's worse because he did it to himself.

1056
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,290
He knew he had one HP.

1057
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,270
Now we're on Storm Point.

1058
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,650
Car strat, car strat, who's playing what?

1059
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,390
Because we're doing the movement comp on the car.

1060
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,550
Are we doing like, aren't we armoured car strat?

1061
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,250
Should I just play Gibby?

1062
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,130
Maybe we don't need everything.

1063
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:28,850
Maybe we just need Gibby.

1064
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,570
Gibby, Lifeline, Watson.

1065
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:33,770
No, we need Doki Gibby.

1066
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:35,550
Wait, why me Gibby?

1067
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:36,570
I can't, I don't even know how.

1068
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:37,490
That's a lot of responsibility.

1069
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:38,510
Yeah, that's a lot of responsibility.

1070
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,490
Bro, I don't even know how I'll put the bubble correctly.

1071
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,030
No!

1072
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,910
No cars!

1073
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,690
No cars!

1074
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,630
No fun.

1075
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:53,510
No cars, PVE?

1076
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:54,610
No cars?

1077
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,250
No cars, I'm mad.

1078
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,430
We're just playing movement comp.

1079
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,750
We're just playing movement comp.

1080
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,250
So what's that?

1081
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,310
Path rev.

1082
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:08,470
Path rev.

1083
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:09,930
Or octane.

1084
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:10,810
Or octane.

1085
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:13,070
I'll do... Wait, what are you guys gonna do?

1086
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:23,690
want to give them ammo but also alt excels alt excels yeah
picking up altics i mean you play loba i'll play path and

1087
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:32,350
then we have the revtar all right okay i'll be loba then all
right and we're just grabbing alt excels yeah yeah alt

1088
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:41,970
excels and bats and hopefully okay can't believe it we all
we had the armored car strat it was gonna be the strat yeah

1089
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,990
tempo is just stream sniping He's kind of an asshole.

1090
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:44,770
Yeah, he knew.

1091
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:46,590
He fucking knew.

1092
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,050
He heard us talking about us.

1093
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:49,130
He heard we were about to have fun.

1094
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,730
He was like, yeah, let's shut this down real quick.

1095
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:54,130
Run bang.

1096
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,570
Let's hotbox the end zone.

1097
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:56,110
Ooh.

1098
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:58,450
Nice.

1099
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,690
The only reason there was actually an end zone that game is
because there's only one hider.

1100
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:07,110
She tried to outplay the outplay the seekers, trap them in a
building.

1101
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:08,830
Oh, true, true.

1102
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:11,890
Put a loot stick in front of a door so they can't leave.

1103
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:17,230
They could just kick the door down.

1104
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,150
You jammed the door.

1105
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,810
There's a bunch of rampart walls on it.

1106
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,390
Wait, that's so smart.

1107
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:33,470
We bait one of them into a room and then put like 200
rampart door.

1108
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:37,630
So they can't get out.

1109
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,030
Wait, what map are we playing after this?

1110
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:42,510
Broken moon?

1111
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:43,790
I guess so.

1112
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:44,210
Yeah.

1113
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,930
Oh god.

1114
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,650
I can hide everywhere on that map.

1115
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,410
I don't think anyone's gonna be dead.

1116
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,080
Alright, here it is.

1117
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,820
This is, this is it.

1118
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,360
Yeah.

1119
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,440
Don't worry, guys, it's okay guys.

1120
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,960
No matter what placement we get, in the end it's all for
charity.

1121
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:13,860
True.

1122
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:15,080
For charity!

1123
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:26,400
charity and wi-fi yeah for charity and wi-fi hey guys if you

point apex over wi-fi you can join a giveaway um for free

1126
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:54,520

hashtag ad it's just we're just really passionate about

1127
01:02:54,520 --> 01:03:09,340
wi-fi in fact nrg is gonna play their world cup with wi-fi
uh yeah yeah as the igl i hope i hope that i hope that you

1128
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:17,020
changed the router as the igl for nrg i will make sure that
they will play on

1129
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:30,500
don't worry guys i'm here for you nokia sponsor me for real
no cars slash pve for hiders he said it four times and then

1130
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:42,400
somebody said can we use cars no pve but why would most cars
win just collecting the cars down to sacrifice our points

1131
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,480
just to have a car honestly same dq to get first

1132
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:58,960
wait it might need to play octane wait but that means like
wait they said that hide seekers can use cars right yeah

1133
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,540
they can't shoot while they're driving so we need to set up
road traps where they just get hit by octane pads on their

1134
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:09,060
car i'm just thinking like what if like we just take the car
and then scare the other hiders

1135
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:20,720
just be the roadblock of this journey just make it more fun
but get dekeed about it he's not I mean, we just scare one

1136
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,400
guy.

1137
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,200
My middle name is zone damage.

1138
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,860
Who will die to spiders?

1139
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,580
Oh, that's true.

1140
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,280
Because there's no PvE.

1141
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,440
They can hit us.

1142
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,240
We can't hit them.

1143
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,500
We can't hide in prowler areas.

1144
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,660
You just run.

1145
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,340
No, you can.

1146
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,040
Because the prowlers will stop spawning.

1147
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:45,940
Right?

1148
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:46,340
Oh, yeah.

1149
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,400
If there's more than one team, yeah.

1150
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:47,800
Yeah.

1151
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,160
All right, here we go.

1152
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:51,980
I believe.

1153
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,140
I believe in us.

1154
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,100
Speaker Scott.

1155
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,060
Speaker is intense.

1156
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,020
Oh, yeah.

1157
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,400
That's actually fucking crazy.

1158
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,280
Camp the cannons and when they try to push you, just take
it.

1159
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,360
If they take it, take it, take it.

1160
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,520
We just need to play.

1161
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,140
We need to collect a million bats so we can just bat every
time we take a cannon.

1162
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:28,420
that's true or we put an altar portal down and teleport out
of the cannon oh my god that's so smart we just wait we wait

1163
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:41,080
we wait at the cannon and how do we kill them how do we kill
them well we can teleport them off a cliff make a rave

1164
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:48,000
portal at the cannon and the portal ends at the edge of the
cliff no make a portal and then the portal ends at an on an

1165
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,340
altar all or an altar queue or something.

1166
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,980
And then it's just like a little roadmap to the end of the
cliff.

1167
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,240
It's just a domino effect.

1168
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,980
Yeah, it's just a domino effect.

1169
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:03,500
Just a portal, portal, portal, portal, death.

1170
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,200
Rafe Ultra Ash.

1171
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,180
Three portals.

1172
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,320
That has to be like at least 100 meters.

1173
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,260
Maybe 150.

1174
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,580
Maybe more.

1175
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,160
We can get 150 meters off.

1176
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:33,780
of that rape altar ash oh man over 150 meters close to a
cliff oh yeah no they're absolutely not going to be entering

1177
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:42,700
any fucking portal after last game there's no fucking way

Guard that bin.

1210
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,810
I think that one guy who keeps dying for us is just AFK.

1211
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:01,810
Why is he AFK?

1212
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:03,310
I guess like to fill up the slots.

1213
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:08,090
Guard that bin for me.

1214
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:11,850
I swear if some guy fucking comes in and going set.

1215
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:13,890
That's our points.

1216
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,350
Yeah, those are our points right there.

1217
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:17,430
Okay.

1218
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:19,930
Are we just splitting up this time?

1219
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:21,510
Just collecting.

1220
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:22,710
Collecting.

1221
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:23,510
Collecting.

1222
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:23,850
All right.

1223
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,910
I'm going to go to Cascades to get more armor.

1224
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,170
How far is your ult?

1225
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:30,030
I'll probably come with you.

1226
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:30,950
I have ult now.

1227
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:31,730
Okay.

1228
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:32,550
I'll just come with you.

1229
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1230
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:37,150
I'll put it in Cascades and hope that no Seekers hears
the...

1231
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,850
But, um...

1232
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,510
Should I get the ultimate increase or...

1233
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,470
I feel like I'm always going to die, so I'll just give you
guys my ult.

1234
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:45,850
Oh.

1235
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,210
All right.

1236
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:55,750
Let's see.

1237
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:00,650
I mean, would putting up fences considered a damaging
ability?

1238
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:03,790
That does damage.

1239
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:04,810
That is how that works.

1240
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:07,950
No, but like, just don't, don't walk on it.

1241
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:12,810
Yeah, my bad.

1242
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:14,410
Just walk through it.

1243
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:14,990
No, you're right.

1244
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:16,010
Honestly, I never did.

1245
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:16,790
Why did I think about that?

1246
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:17,630
It's a damage by choice.

1247
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:21,370
So like, if you just don't walk through it, you should be
fine.

1248
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:22,770
Just don't take damage.

1249
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:23,150
Yeah.

1250
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:24,930
So it's cost of gas in that case.

1251
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:25,350
Yeah.

1252
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,490
Let's go north and grab the pill.

1253
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,390
Yeah, I'm gonna grab that pill and then put down the ult.

1254
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,090
Am I about to die?

1255
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:32,910
Why?

1256
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:33,330
Oh, friendly.

1257
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,050
They spawn barometer, fun.

1258
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,950
Okay.

1259
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:38,750
Me and this wraith were both like shuffling back and forth.

1260
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:39,950
Like, yeah, come in.

1261
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,010
I'm putting it here.

1262
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,630
I'm putting the ult here.

1263
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:52,870
you're welcome let's hope that no seeker fucking runs in and
clocks us oh after this we should probably go i'm probably

1264
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:58,090
gonna go down to senote i think they're gonna leave that
side of the map there's only one alt excel here okay okay

1265
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:07,990
you should hurry and take it before these leechers take it
got it i'm gonna go on checkpoint i'll see you guys back

1266
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:20,110
guys if if i die in checkpoint right on the run the opposite
side then you'll know we gotta keep our eyes I found friends

1267
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:26,770
wait fun oh never mind I was gonna say advantage might be
broken but never mind I was gonna say because you can see

1268
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:31,350
their their armors yeah but they know if they're a three man
so if you see a three man with armor you know it's the

1269
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:37,970
secrets like red armor I mean true but then they're gonna
see your fucking sky no no no you can do the passive without

1270
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:45,410
going through oh yeah yeah you just look at them yeah yeah
but you have to be on there we just have one person for

1271
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,530
information and then we have Falk to get away.

1272
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:53,890
You know, I feel like would it be easier just to be crypto
and then crypto can just like always have a drone out

1273
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:55,170
somewhere?

1274
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:55,550
Yeah, probably.

1275
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,090
True.

1276
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,910
Wait, we should do that for Broken Moon.

1277
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:02,830
Just have a crypto put out the drone out and then like so
the seeker shoots the drone, then we'll know.

1278
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:05,190
I'll play crypto and I'll just EMP everyone.

1279
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:07,810
It's not damaging.

1280
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,270
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1281
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:10,890
1,000 damage.

1282
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,110
EMP online.

1283
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,050
No, wait, wait.

1284
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:22,070

it was it's the last game oh true what are they gonna do

Ape strong together.

1403
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,800
They'll shoot the Pathfinders, not the other guy.

01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,560
Why does he have a gun?

1405

01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,500
I should have gotten us both killed.

1509
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,020
But you gotta live.

1510
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:45,820
You gotta live.

1511
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:46,900
It's just us too.

1512
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,320
You gotta live.

1513
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:50,900
For us.

1514
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:51,860
No, you're not.

1515
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:52,720
You're not.

1516
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,060
It's Tibby on you.

1517
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,100
Tibby and Luda.

1518
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,440
Oh, God.

1519
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,620
Run, Flores.

1520
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,140
Oh, God.

1521
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,180
Oh, my God.

1522
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:05,860
Run.

1523
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,000
He's on controller.

1524
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:07,780
They're on controller.

1525
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,200
Uh-oh.

1526
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:11,860
Is he a read-a-play?

1527
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,120
No, there's no read-a-play.

1528
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,780
Fun said, he has two of them on him.

1529
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,080
No.

1530
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,680
Okay, okay, now I know.

1531
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,040
They're stealing each other's kills.

1532
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,640
They're not even looking for people.

1533
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,180
They're actually teaming up on you.

1534
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,060
They're trying to get second, even though second doesn't
matter.

1535
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,460
Wait, this is a deep hole.

1536
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,100
What the fuck?

1537
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,960
What is this spot?

1538
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,380
I didn't even know this existed.

1539
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:33,260
You're fine.

1540
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:33,580
You're fine.

1541
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:33,960
Don't panic.

1542
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,360
Don't panic.

1543
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:35,920
He does not know.

1544
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:36,640
He doesn't know.

1545
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,320
He doesn't know.

1546
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,920
I don't know about this spot, so I know Ludov.

1547
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:49,560
does not know about this but he told you this what's this i
don't know i just walked in yeah go finish your narcturnal

1549
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:14,090
yes it was it was it was it was it was That was worth it.

1550
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:14,630
That was worth it.

1551
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,970
That's why I'm the new IGL.

1552
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:23,450
He's probably so bad.

1553
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:24,130
He just got finished.

1554
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:27,890
He's like, what the fuck is this lova?

1555
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:32,790
Oh my god.

1556
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:34,870
Back up more, back up.

1557
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:36,350
You're behind the Pathfinder.

1558
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:41,090
Why did you put a stamp?

1559
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,790
You fucking whore!

1560
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:48,590
It's okay, it's okay, you're top 10.

1561
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:55,910
We're fine.

1562
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:01,330
We didn't do damage, he was already dead.

1563
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:05,470
It's not damage if he's dead.

1564
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:12,970
Bro, we're so flunked.

1565
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:18,070
I'm literally hiding behind somebody else's body.

1566
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:18,690
Get ready to queue.

1567
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:20,290
Get ready to queue.

1568
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:21,170
Oh god.

1569
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:22,710
Wait, we the people.

1570
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,290
Wait, we the...

1571
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:25,470
Wait, no, no, no.

1572
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:28,070
No, stop, stop, stop.

1573
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,450
Stop, stop, stop!

1574
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:29,710
That's a secret.

1575
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,370
That's a secret.

1576
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:33,010
It's a secret.

1577
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:34,150
That's like, why me?

1578
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:36,870
There's literally a bad fighting.

1579
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:39,430
You started punching him back.

1580
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:47,610
I'm so confused.

1581
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:48,810
I'm like,

1582
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:52,230
I'm like, what is this doing?

1583
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:54,650
There's no way you started punching it back.

1584
01:27:56,690 --> 01:28:00,590
I did not thought it was something I had to just punch me
around.

1585
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:04,770
No, there's no way I did damage.

1586
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:05,930
No, I did.

1587
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:06,830
Holy fuck.

1588
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:10,890
I thought...

1589
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:12,670
I'm not saying it was either.

1590
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:14,190
It was worth it.

1591
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:15,710
Yeah, it was self-defense.

1592
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:16,710
It was self-defense.

1593
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:17,630
It was self-defense.

1594
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:19,310
I don't think that's how that works in this tournament.

1595
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:25,650
Oh my god, I need water.

1596
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,370
I think this Octane wins.

1597
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:28,050
This Octane wins.

1598
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:31,030
Wait, no, there's someone behind him.

1599
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:32,550
Wait, there is?

1600
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:34,790
Yeah, he's healing behind him.

1601
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,850
Wait, no, there's only two secures left.

1602
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:37,810
One died his own.

1603
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:39,090
There's just a low path.

1604
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:40,710
Peep's died his own.

1605
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:42,130
Again?

1606
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:43,110
Yeah, he has it.

1607
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:44,210
Yeah, I saw him.

1608
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:44,850
No, no, no.

1609
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:45,910
He got Riz.

1610
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:46,790
Oh, he got Riz.

1611
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:48,890
Oh, he should have kept him dead.

1612
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,910
Because he got a kill after.

1613
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,070
There's a lot of people just keep thinking though, David.

1614
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:55,450
He's like one dick at a time.

1615
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:56,930
Dude, they have no ammo.

1616
01:28:57,150 --> 01:28:58,210
They're just beating his ass.

1617
01:28:58,370 --> 01:28:59,250
They have ammo.

1618
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:02,110
Bro, no!

1619
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,730
Wait, you got second.

1620
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:04,310
Oh!

1621
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:08,170
That was funny.

1622
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,970
Bro, has anyone had the reaction?

1623
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:14,730
through our XIGOs.

1624
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,670
It's a finish, Jake.

1625
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:22,750
Very fun.

1626
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,770
Pass the clip along.

1627
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:26,150
Pass the clip.

1628
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:29,810
Yeah, pass the clip.

1629
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:30,710
Pass the clip.

1630
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:37,530
He said, please tell me that's not who I think it is.

1631
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:38,810
Oh, God, he knew immediately.

1632
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:59,050

1634
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:22,950
He's like, what do I mean?

1635
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,930
I'm getting finishered right now.

1636
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:29,310
I like how the POV is to somebody else.

1637
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:32,130
So like, you're not even sharing with me.

1638
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:36,550
Oh, Alicia.

1639
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:41,360
Nice.

1640
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,600
All right, what are we doing now?

1641
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:44,440
What comp?

1642
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,760
I don't know.

1643
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:47,540
I don't know.

1644
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,460
I'm going to play altar on broken moon.

1645
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,200
I'm going to play pound.

1646
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:53,520
It's time to run.

1647
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:54,660
We'll play whatever you want.

1648
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,060
And grapple under our bridge.

1649
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,160
We'll be hiding under the bridge.

1650
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,120
Alright, alright.

1651
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:05,620
Are we doing the same thing?

1652
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,740
Five teams tied for first?

1653
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:11,240
Oh my god, that means they have to donate to five different
charities.

1654
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,440
Them's the rules.

1655
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:16,500
True.

1656
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:17,500
That's the rules.

1657
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,640
Those are the rules.

1658
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,380
Charity rules.

1659
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,960
If they don't do it, they hate charity.

1660
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:26,720
It's true.

1661
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:27,340
It's true.

1662
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:31,500
It's actually facts.

1663
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,680
I didn't think about it that.

1664
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,360
How could you hate charity?

1665
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:37,780
I'm an asshole.

1666
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:38,460
I know.

1667
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:39,220
I can't believe it.

1668
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:39,540
Tempo.

1669
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:40,820
You can't just hate charity like that.

1670
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,360
You got to donate to five different charities.

1671
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:45,420
Oh, no.

1672
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,240
Wig was reacting to it.

1673
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,520
I wish Wig was watching our stream.

1674
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:51,360
Yeah.

1675
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,290
All right.

1676
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:08,250
Let's see.

1677
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:10,290
Should we still have ring character?

1678
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:11,530
Oh, wait, no, you're on crypto.

1679
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:12,670
Reptar, aren't you in crypto?

1680
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:13,950
Oh, yeah, I can play crypto.

1681
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:15,390
What were you going to play before?

1682
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,670
I was going to play altar.

1683
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:18,050
Ultra, wait, I can do crypto.

1684
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:20,830
You can play crypto, go for it.

1685
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:21,650
Yeah, I'll do crypto.

1686
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:22,390

stuck in Wait, how did he get stuck?

1702
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:27,690
He killed people in a building in Zone 6 and he had no beds.

1703
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:29,810
He just got stuck in the corner of the room.

1704
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:34,890
I thought like he got stuck as in, there were so many bodies
just blocking.

1705
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:40,750
Maybe we all, so we all jump out the ship and we all go to
like three different POIs.

1706
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:42,410
We should do that, yeah.

1707
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:46,790
We gotta do that.

1708
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:48,990
I can hit ring consoles when I get blue.

1709
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:52,510

1710
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,310

I'll do... Yeah, I'll do Loba.

1714
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:04,130
I was just thinking maybe like...

1715
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:06,470
Bangalore, because no one's playing assault characters.

1716
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:07,890
Oh, you're right.

1717
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:10,230

1719
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,450
Depend on what you mean by accidentally?

1720
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,090
For the last zone.

1721
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:20,490

01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,350

It brings six.

1725
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:27,290

Wait, bro, how...

1728
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:33,910
How peep died in the first game is even funnier.

1729
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:37,250
He's just running around stimming you on the gas edge.

1730
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:38,310
It just barely ticks.

1731
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,130
That's his shoulder in the zone and dies.

1732
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:42,450
Wait, you didn't click crypto.

1733
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:45,490
You forgot crypto.

1734
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:48,430
Oh, wait, you're right.

1735
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:50,150
It's okay, I'll...

1736
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:51,730
It's on me.

1737
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,370
Thank you.

1738
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:53,010
I was AFK.

1739
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:53,910
I was watching the clip.

1740
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,510
You can start grieving people, though.

1741
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:58,830
It's my turn to grieve people.

1742
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:01,650
Okay, now instead of...

1743
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:03,570
This is up accidentally bang halting.

1744
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:05,310
Wait, there's so many beacons.

1745
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:06,330
There's so many beacons.

1746
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,210
Can you land here, Doki?

1747
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:08,850
Which way?

1748
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,130
And hit all three of the beacons?

1749
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:10,750
Oh, yeah.

1750
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:11,470
Hell yeah.

1751
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,830
I'm gonna go experimental labs.

1752
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:18,830
Wait, can I do both ring?

1753
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:20,410
No, no, no.

1754
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:23,170
No, no, you can get in your drone and hit all of the man
scan ones.

1755
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:23,990
Oh, okay.

1756
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:26,890
From 200 meters.

1757
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:30,170
So if you ping the thing and you're 200 meters out, you can
do that.

1758
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:30,630
All right.

1759
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,810
All right, let's see.

1760
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:34,330
Oh, 100.

1761
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:35,450
All right, here we go.

1762
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:37,590
It's time to play on my stream deck.

1763
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:39,770
How do I do this?

1764
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,110
Okay, I have to hold the button down to get into the drone.

1765
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:45,310
Time to put, go get into my steam deck right now.

1766
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:46,690
Oh, there we go.

1767
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:47,630
All right, let's see.

1768
01:36:51,890 --> 01:37:08,340

1771
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:23,680
I think so.

1772
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:26,900
I hope so.

1773
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,020
I ran out crypto Wi-Fi.

1774
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:34,080
You see, if you get the Nokia modem, you'll never run out of
Wi-Fi.

1775
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:36,780
This.

1776
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,220
Ooh.

1777
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,460
Wait, can I grab armor with the drone?

1778
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,940
Bun, do you see anybody in the man scan?

1779
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:45,040
No.

1780
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,840
Why is it bugged?

1781
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:48,640
No.

1782
01:37:50,440 --> 01:38:01,320
that before i don't know i should be able to grab uh evo
casters wait my drone got destroyed oh no he punched it

1783
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:11,360
that's just i was like because my drone was like right next
to the evo so i was like how the did he destroy it increased

1784
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:18,300
neural link and emp range wait what's neural link you take
take the other one take the other one okay because that one

1785
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:26,080
is like i don't the neural link is like when it shows how
many teams are in the area i think oh i don't actually know

1786
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:32,380
well is that good for the for for seek for flying drone is
faster is better so they can't break that shit oh okay

1787
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:38,260
because you're never imping anyways that's why that first
one is good but showing don't what do we want i'm in god

1788
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:47,120
spot when we want them to to shoot it so we know where they
are oh but you want to be able to fly around them longer so

1789
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:51,380
they have to shoot it and like be a Oh, you're so smart.

1790
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,280
Yeah, we called her ammo.

1791
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,340
That's why you're rank one, Fred.

1792
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,000
You're so smart.

1793

01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:00,400
Let's see.

1795
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,440
How far is this?

1796
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:04,240
Okay, 280 to get closer.

1797
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,260
Getting on my steam deck.

1798
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:11,040
Okay.

1799
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:16,300
What are you doing there, fun?

1800
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:19,020
I'm gonna go to the beginning.

1801
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:20,340
Collecting.

1802
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:21,620
Oops.

1803
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:23,840
More collecting.

1804
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:27,120
Don't worry.

1805
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:29,520
Hey.

1806
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,380
I'm flying in.

1807
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:33,480
Ooh!

1808
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:37,960
Flying in.

1809
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:42,680
I hope a seeker doesn't randomly shoot me because I'm just
in the middle of nowhere.

1810
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:44,600
This Pathfinder just stole my brick.

1811
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:45,340
I'm so sad.

1812
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,080
Kill him.

1813
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,000
Where are these people anyway?

1814
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:51,460
Sorry to start killing him.

1815
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,340
Let's see.

1816
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:55,220
There's another scan here.

1817
01:39:58,720 --> 01:39:59,900
I fucking see.

1818
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:00,280
Come on.

1819
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:01,980
I was like, what the fuck is this guy?

1820
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,740
Drone scan persists for 1.5 seconds.

1821
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:06,760
Wait, we should want that.

1822
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:07,740
Yeah.

1823
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,580
Well, both are fine.

1824
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:12,120
All right.

1825
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,960
Going for the labs.

1826
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:15,940
Let's get...

1827
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:18,260
Oh, is that behind me?

1828
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:19,740
I need a helmet.

1829
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,020
I don't like the sounds behind me.

1830
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:32,860
it's a pathfinder have a gun seekers are usually to sit
around edge i feel like yeah i mean that makes sense yeah

1831
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:41,540
because do they know zone or no i mean no they don't have
their own character okay so i need to go whoever wait they

What the fuck is this pathfinder doing?

1838
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:36,510
There's a pathfinder right...

1839
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:39,190
If I put a drone right on top of this pathfinder...

1840
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:44,750
You can't do anything about it.

1841
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:47,310
You can't do anything about it.

1842
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:50,890
Guys, look up here!

1843
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,110

01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:09,790
