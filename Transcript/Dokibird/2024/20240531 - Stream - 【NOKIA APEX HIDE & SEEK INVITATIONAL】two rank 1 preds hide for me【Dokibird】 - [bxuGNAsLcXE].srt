1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Alright, now we're live.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,740
Now we're live.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,900
Okay, so...

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,020
Okay, first off, why am the fuck am I do- Why am I Doki E E Bird?

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,800
Alright.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,080
So the game plan is to try- get evil harvesters?

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,520
What if evil harvesters were fun, right?

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,340
I think so.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,300
Yeah.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,480
Yeah.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,980
I feel like they should, right?

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,160
They should land on one POI.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,320
Just so- Well, actually no- Yeah.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,340
So we just have to land right away.

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,520
Yeah.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,720
Oh, cars are imp- Okay, that is so fucking stupid.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,440
Temple- We need to get a car.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,020
Cars are allowed, yeah.

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,420
Yeah.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,460
We need to get a car.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,020
Wait, you're all NRG.

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,040
Should I be NRG too?

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,300
Just to fit in?

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,700
Might as well.

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,760
Okay, wait, give me a second.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,780
I'm gonna change my name real quick.

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,660
Watson.

28
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,380
Watson Octane Car.

29
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,640
Oh my god, no.

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,340
We have to get a car.

31
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,620
That's how I won the last- the very first Hide and Seek lobby.

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,420
We got a car and we just drove around.

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,540
Alright, let me- give me a sec.

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,060
Let me change- I'm- Just signed, by the way, guys.

35
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm in NRG, guys.

36
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,300
I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- Okay, NRG.

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,760
NRG, Doki Bird.

38
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,100
Guys, I'm replacing their IGL.

39
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,100
They realized that a VTuber wishes better publicity.

40
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,480
Is it not a normal VTuber?

41
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,660
I mean, he's more like a poser.

42
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,780
He's a fucking poser.

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,940
That's real.

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,120
Remember when last time he actually used his fucking VTuber shit?

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,680
He's just a flush man now.

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,820
Yeah, he's a fucking fleshy.

47
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,400
He's a fucking meatbag.

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,660
Well, not even- everybody's not even in the fucking lobby yet.

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,120
Also, chat, for those who are like wondering who's who, the whale is Reptar for some reason.

50
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,820
And the cat is Fun.

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,160
And they're both used to be Rank 1 Pred.

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,320
So they're gonna carry me right now.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,960
For charity.

54
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,720
This is Hide and Seek Tournament.

55
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,260
Yeah, in the Hide- In the Hide and- Yeah, yeah.

56
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,920
In the Hide and Seek Tournament.

57
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,760
They're gonna carry me in the Hide and Seek Tournament.

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,760
Thank fucking god I don't have to aim.

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,100
Anyway, I got signed to NRG, guys.

60
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,920
Real.

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,280
Post this article in Dexter right now.

62
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,260
Okay, does anyone- has anyone actually read the rules for this?

63
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,760
Like, like what's our first- is our first map World's Edge?

64
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,180
I know we play every map but Olympus.

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,660
Oh, we play every fucking map?

66
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,720
Oh my god, okay.

67
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,840
Alright, that's so fun.

68
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,560
What?

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,520
Okay, so what is the god spot on World's Edge, Fun?

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,380
Might as well just leak it now.

71
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,260
It depends on the- where the zone goes.

72
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,520
Where?

73
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,760
The icicles.

74
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,660
The icicles?

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,700
Okay, but if you know the spot, what if the other- what if the Seekers know the spot?

76
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,980
Well, there's a- isn't there- there's a zone.

77
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,020
Yeah, there is a zone.

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,980
It depends on where the zone goes.

79
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,240
Watch it go trials and it's gonna be 40- Dude.

80
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,040
Dude.

81
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,220
Stop.

82
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,420
If it goes trials, I'll be so sad.

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

84
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,460
We just bodyblocked the tower.

85
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,100
If it goes trials, Fun, I'm sitting inside of one of the trials- oh wait, we can't do the trials, never mind.

86
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,580
Wait, wait, Tempo's watching us.

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,740
Wait, Tempo!

88
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,260
Did you say icicles?

89
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,500
Guys, I think Tempo is sniping us.

90
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,560
He's gonna use me and make rules.

91
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,380
No, no, no.

92
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,900
Why is Tempo always watching us, Fun?

93
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,000
No, no, no.

94
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,340
Why is this guy always watching?

95
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,420
Wait, why is he- why is he sniping us?

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Why is he sniping us?

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,040
Why is this guy always watching us?

98
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Why is he sniping us?

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Why is he sniping us?

100
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,720
Alright, strats, I bet you the other pro players are just as scummy.

101
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,260
Alright, strats, I bet you the other pro players are just as scummy.

102
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,400
There's no way.

103
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,980
There's no way.

104
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,820
Yeah, don't talk to me like that.

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,580
I just got signed.

106
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,060
There you go.

107
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,460
Hey, at least, like, it's all for charity, guys.

108
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,020
Guys, it's all for charity.

109
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,200
We don't actually get paid.

110
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,420
We got free like Wi-Fi modems.

111
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,020
Are you guys using your Wi-Fi modem?

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,140
Are you guys using it?

113
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,560
Okay, I just wanted to be sure.

114
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,740
Yeah,

115
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,820
are you guys posers?

116
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,500
Are you guys using it?

117
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,120
Guys, we got sent like a care package.

118
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,540
That was like a... it's like a fucking Wi-Fi modem.

119
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,700
And it's just... it has an Apex Legends icon on it.

120
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,740
To like remind us that we're...

121
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,040
To remind us that it is a modem for Apex Legends.

122
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,440
And then... and then we got a shirt and a controller too.

123
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,620
Let's see.

124
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Let me make sure all my settings and stuff are correct.

125
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Alright.

126
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Nice.

127
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,800
What the fuck is that?

128
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,420
I'm trash.

129
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,360
Oh, okay.

130
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,760
It's wake.

131
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,280
Never mind.

132
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,880
I don't know if I can get through this.

133
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,400
If you want, I can probably do it.

134
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,580
What is the controller gonna do?

135
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,980
Aim assist your hiding spot?

136
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,840
Controllers for driving.

137
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,400
Controllers for driving.

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,420
Oh, true.

139
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,060
Get that roller out for the car.

140
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,000
Way fun.

141
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,500
I could sit in crypto and just give you full info.

142
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,340
Oh shit, you're right!

143
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,740
And I can get every single Evo.

144
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,840
Is that worth it?

145
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,340
Oh wait, yeah.

146
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,020
Yeah.

147
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,160
We should get...

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,140
Nah, we should run around.

149
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,480
Yeah, but the thing is, I'm not living longer than you.

150
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,960
Let's be honest.

151
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,000
That's true.

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,600
I might as well support you.

153
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,620
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,960
We're just pouring all our support onto fun.

155
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,540
We're just pouring our lives to blood to get fun Evo.

156
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,080
Yeah.

157
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,380
That's how I see it.

158
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,560
Wait, what should I play then?

159
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,980
What other character is good?

160
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,580
Oh, we should do like ring consoles and all that shit too.

161
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,320
Like, oh we should... yeah, yeah.

162
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,860
Play Vantage so you can hit bull.

163
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
Oh my god.

164
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,320
Wait, play Vantage so I can hit what?

165
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,740
You can hit both because of Vantage.

166
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,620
Oh yeah!

167
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,800
Okay, I'll do Vantage so I can hit the other shit.

168
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,400
And then like we just get... and so you know where the zone's ending, Fun.

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,320
You know where the zone's ending and where people are.

170
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,220
I gotta bring you guys both up on Discord.

171
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,820
Let's see.

172
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,840
Okay, Fun, you're already at 200% of the time.

173
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,960
Oh.

174
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,980
What the fuck is wrong with your mic, Fun?

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,960
I dropped my mix amp last night and I think it might have turned a bunch of stuff down.

176
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,580
Yeah.

177
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,920
You're literally at 200.

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,460
Wait, I have you at 200% too.

179
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:10,860
Hello?

180
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,680
Hello?

181
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,360
Alright, Sound Guy, are they better now?

182
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,860
Well, I didn't really turn Fun up.

183
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,540
I just hope he did himself.

184
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
What are we waiting for?

185
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,960
We're waiting for... okay.

186
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm scared I'm gonna be really loud.

187
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,460
Start without them.

188
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,300
Okay, no, that's toxic.

189
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,300
Hahaha.

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
It is, but we're also 8 minutes late.

191
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,980
Yeah, it's true.

192
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,820
Start without them.

193
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll make up for their viewership.

194
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,110
When they heard that I got signed, they'll just be like, we gotta fucking go to her chat.

195
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,840
Yeah, you're still really low, Fun.

196
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,300
Raise yourself up.

197
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,540
Oh shit, they're gonna start without them.

198
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,020
Fuck yeah.

199
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,640
Just increase my gain.

200
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Just all the way.

201
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,160
Yeah, just do it.

202
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,720
If Fun raises himself, I gotta set him down.

203
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,860
Just all the way up.

204
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,520
Yeah.

205
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,220
What are you scared of?

206
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm scared of being a little bitch.

207
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,640
You're being loud.

208
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,240
That was like three years ago.

209
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
It still counts!

210
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,480
You're so loud now.

211
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,720
Hello?

212
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,400
Oh my god, what the fuck?

213
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,780
How did you get lower?

214
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,960
Like your voice is lower.

215
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,840
Oh, his voice.

216
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,060
I was like, you should go louder.

217
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,980
Like how did his voice get lower by more gain?

218
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,180
Oh my god, it got like so bassy.

219
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,440
Wait, Wig actually believed I got signed?

220
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,720
Wig, I did get signed.

221
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,300
What do you mean?

222
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,260
I'm gonna post my tweet in like ten minutes.

223
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:51,990
Alright.

224
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,890
Yay, we're starting.

225
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,310
Advantage, right?

226
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,410
This is like...

227
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,710
Yeah, you put advantage.

228
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,490
On King's Canyon, I think, I'm just gonna sit in the map room the entire game.

229
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,110
What if the fucking Seeker's got a map room?

230
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,110
I'm just gonna sit in the map room and I'm gonna spam the button until I get murdered.

231
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,310
I don't know that smile!

232
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,190
The sound it makes is so loud.

233
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,650
It'll get them all on one side of the map.

234
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,910
It's so loud.

235
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,550
I'm just gonna be on the other side.

236
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,790
Alright.

237
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,410
I'm just gonna be on the other side.

238
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,430
Alright, sound guy.

239
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,390
Let me know if their voices are better now.

240
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,530
Team 14's...

241
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,310
Who cares?

242
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,750
I'll be on team 14 if they're that desperate.

243
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,410
Then we'll be the team 14.

244
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:40,790
Don't do that.

245
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:43,810
It's okay.

246
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,170
Fun's gonna carry us.

247
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,550
No, Fun would just be carrying me then.

248
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,850
Why am I putting my sleeve on like I'm about to beam people?

249
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,410
I'm literally running.

250
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:53,690
You gotta climb.

251
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,650
You gotta put that sleeve on.

252
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:55,970
I'm literally running.

253
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,890
Yeah, just to...

254
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,030
I'm literally running for my life.

255
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,230
Just to like...

256
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,090
Get your running skills higher.

257
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,010
I don't fucking know.

258
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,930
APM that shit.

259
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,670
Put the sleeve on... put it on my keyboard arm.

260
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,230
Put the like...

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Okay, I raised up... I raised up OBS.

262
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,520
Alright, let's go!

263
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,400
Let's go.

264
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,380
Let's fucking go.

265
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,190
Alright.

266
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,210
Vantage.

267
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,270
Where is vantage?

268
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,110
Guys, where's vantage?

269
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,910
Bottom left.

270
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,270
You got it.

271
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,690
Okay.

272
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,450
Nice.

273
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:32,910
Alone.

274
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:32,930
Alone.

275
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,170
Wait, should I be like...

276
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,710
Oh, you're doing controller, right?

277
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,750
Wait, should I be like...

278
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,650
Your character can do both.

279
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,910
Oh, I can do both?

280
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,630
Yeah, once we have blue armor, you can do both with one of your perks.

281
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,570
Oh my god.

282
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,530
Okay, I didn't know that.

283
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,890
This is how little I played vantage.

284
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,610
Wait, Reptile, I thought you're fucking...

285
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,330
Oh, you're... Oh!

286
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,530
I can do...

287
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:52,910
Dude, should I...

288
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,670
Both.

289
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,510
Should I get...

290
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,850
You can't just keep healing and ring four?

291
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,810
Oh, wait.

292
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,890
I feel like you're gonna die before actually...

293
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,230
...setting that up.

294
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,770
Well, you have the five minute cooldown.

295
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,390
Let's go climb it.

296
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:06,990
We're going to climb it.

297
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,590
We're going to climb it.

298
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:07,710
Okay.

299
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,970
There's going to be a lot of moving climate.

300
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,370
Yeah, yeah.

301
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:09,730
Just drop.

302
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,070
Just drop.

303
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,370
Just drop.

304
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,450
Just drop.

305
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,050
Who cares?

306
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,230
We got two counters.

307
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,230
All right.

308
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,570
Where even are the fucking...

309
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,710
So you can land on the beacon here.

310
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,490
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,390
On the height and hit it.

312
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:25,550
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,510
Let me just hit that real quick and find...

314
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,090
Where's the Evo?

315
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,830
...all the people that's just...

316
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,110
I don't know.

317
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,690
I'm like looking around for the Evo harvesters.

318
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,190
There's one in the open here and I don't see any of them.

319
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,610
Here you go.

320
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,990
Don't worry.

321
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,350
I'm getting us that 300 right off the bat.

322
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,810
Or 100, 200.

323
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,430
Just start blasting people with guns.

324
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,130
Yeah.

325
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,310
They won't know it's us.

326
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,810
When I started blasting...

327
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,030
How would they know?

328
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,370
I think I see it.

329
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,870
All right.

330
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,750
I need...

331
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,830
Guys, I need blue armor.

332
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,390
I can't fucking press that thing.

333
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,670
Okay.

334
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,630
We have enough time.

335
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,750
They're still in the ship.

336
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,890
Where's the Evo?

337
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,230
Spawn, damn it.

338
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,570
Spawn.

339
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:01,670
Spawn.

340
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,630
Where is it?

341
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,630
Come on.

342
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,850
We got to win this for charity.

343
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,270
That's what I'm saying.

344
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,010
All right.

345
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,770
We're going to get that.

346
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,090
All right.

347
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,930
Evo spawn in 20 seconds.

348
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:12,990
Come on.

349
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,290
Crafty bat.

350
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,990
I'm going to spread out.

351
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,050
I'm just going to go to Skyhook.

352
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,770
All right.

353
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,210
I'm waiting for this ring console.

354
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,430
I'm waiting for one of you guys.

355
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:21,850
Wait.

356
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,830
He already killed somebody.

357
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,430
Guys, he already killed someone.

358
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,470
That's fine.

359
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,430
They're in Mirage.

360
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,990
That's not my problem.

361
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,310
That's what I'm saying.

362
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,670
I'm just going to go to Mirage.

363
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,370
I'm alive.

364
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,090
So waiting on my ring console.

365
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,590
I'm going to grab the ments.

366
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,350
Friendly.

367
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:40,770
Friendly.

368
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,790
I'm going to...

369
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,410
I got you, Juicy.

370
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,010
Oh, it's over there.

371
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,830
I got one.

372
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,610
All right.

373
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,010
Wait.

374
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,310
Yeah.

375
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,170
Somebody get that one.

376
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,190
Or I'll get it actually.

377
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:48,770
No, no, no.

378
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,350
Stay on the beacon.

379
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:49,590
Stay on the beacon.

380
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,730
Okay.

381
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,290
I got it.

382
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,510
Yay.

383
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,710
Okay.

384
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,250
Ring console.

385
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,790
I got it.

386
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,310
Here you guys go.

387
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,230
I hope that fucking grappler isn't...

388
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,590
All right.

389
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:02,850
Nice.

390
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,110
Okay.

391
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:03,970
Oh, hey.

392
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,990
It's actually next to us.

393
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,610
Oh.

394
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,430
Yeah.

395
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,770
Is that a friendly or...

396
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,950
We'll go to Overload.

397
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,210
Friendly.

398
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,050
I'm so scared when I hear one-time footsteps.

399
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,370
I know, right?

400
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,450
I'm just like, am I about to fucking die?

401
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,930
Does anyone know what they're playing?

402
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,330
Guys.

403
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,390
I'm not going to like...

404
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,290
They might be Octane, to be honest.

405
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,930
I have no idea.

406
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,890
I know Timmy's on Pathfinder.

407
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,370
That's all I know.

408
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,630
All right.

409
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,290
So like, it's going to be...

410
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:28,850
Ghosting allowed.

411
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,510
Open the stream.

412
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,230
Open it up.

413
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:32,310
Yeah.

414
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,610
Talk to me in your chat.

415
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,350
You can tell you.

416
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:43,310
All I'm saying is that I somehow figured it out, but I just look at, you know, just look at my chat for like one second.

417
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,090
There's no rules against ghosting.

418
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,410
I would remember if there was.

419
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,650
All I'm saying, chat, is just tell me who they're playing.

420
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,230
Yeah.

421
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,570
We're getting metagamed.

422
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:00,950
What is this?

423
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:01,730
Wait.

424
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,010
Somebody figure out this Jason in the microphone.

425
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:03,810
I don't stand for this.

426
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,810
Someone go to Timmy's chat and tell him where Doki is.

427
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,430
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

428
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,550
Wait.

429
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,530
I was just joking, guys.

430
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,550
I was literally...

431
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,070
I was joking.

432
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,690
I wasn't.

433
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,150
I wasn't.

434
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,610
I wasn't.

435
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,290
What do you mean you weren't?

436
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,030
I'm literally your captain.

437
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,050
All right, guys.

438
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,610
I'm scanning.

439
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,710
It's a coup.

440
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,550
Okay.

441
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,210
We're going to go to the next one.

442
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,470
We're going to go to the next one.

443
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,070
Who's that?

444
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:28,950
I don't know.

445
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,270
Wait.

446
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:30,830
The care pack.

447
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,310
The brick.

448
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,650
Oh.

449
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,250
That's big.

450
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,470
And steal the fucking Kraber.

451
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,670
Oh my God.

452
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,270
Look at everybody on our side.

453
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,450
If the Kraber spawns, we need to throw it off the map.

454
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,650
Okay, two of the shooter are the...

455
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,690
The Seekers are shooting right now, and I didn't hear anything, so they're nowhere near us.

456
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,230
Okay, okay.

457
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:47,710
That's good.

458
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,270
That's good.

459
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,990
And the other ones are the People's.

460
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,830
Nothing to worry about.

461
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,130
All right.

462
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,190
They got me.

463
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,470
Steal the PK!

464
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,090
Steal the PK!

465
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,620
I will be sitting inside of the the underside of the tunnel.

466
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,280
Do you want to sit in the tunnel behind the fucking pills or some shit?

467
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,600
No, I'm sitting in the high spot.

468
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,620
No, you were on me.

469
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
There's no way they'll know I'm here, right?

470
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,480
No!

471
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,620
I fell down.

472
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,260
There's no way.

473
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,900
Oh wait, but here is this...

474
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,760
One ring to rule them all.

475
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,000
No, come on.

476
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,760
Is this like in bounds?

477
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,680
We're gonna find out.

478
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,220
Oh, it's not.

479
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,260
Guys, if I get shot, we'll know why.

480
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,680
That's a really obvious spot.

481
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,240
Yo, Rip, can you get on top of the balloon?

482
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,660
No.

483
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,600
Oh, what if they're... Oh, what if they're...

484
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,520
Oh my gosh, nobody will know I'm at the dildo.

485
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,920
Wait guys, I think I'm dead.

486
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,660
Wait, what?

487
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Are you dead?

488
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,240
Are they there?

489
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,640
There's an octane right here, stimming.

490
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,420
I don't know if that's a person or not.

491
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,080
No, it's a friendly.

492
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,600
It's a friendly.

493
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:03,980
We're good.

494
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,300
Okay, alright, nice.

495
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,600
Cool.

496
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,240
See, nothing to worry about.

497
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,400
I just heard an octane stimming down my hallway and I got fucking scared.

498
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,140
Wait, can I do like more than one ring, right?

499
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,900
Oh, I can.

500
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,800
I can do a climatizer ring again.

501
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,660
Alright, I'm gonna leave you guys.

502
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,060
I don't want to be near all of you guys.

503
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,400
You guys are gonna hit double too.

504
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,640
Yeah, but what if they're there?

505
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,520
What if they're a climatizer?

506
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,240
Yeah, there's no way.

507
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,220
There's no way.

508
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,440
They literally start off at the end of the circle.

509
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,120
Probability-wise, I would survive more over that side.

510
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:34,620
The probability.

511
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,420
Yeah.

512
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm very bad at math, but probability-wise, I think I'd survive.

513
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,960
Also, we have purple.

514
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,720
I don't think we're getting red.

515
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,580
Might as well just chill.

516
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,720
Yeah, but we can get intel.

517
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,400
Friendly.

518
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,800
Friendly.

519
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,240
Do I have enough meds for this?

520
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,720
Yes, I do.

521
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,780
Okay, so we're on one.

522
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah, I have syringes.

523
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,160
Oh, it would be a smart idea to carry guns.

524
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,240
Just to be like, ehhh.

525
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,140
Just to have all the friends run away.

526
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,340
Just to scare people, bro.

527
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,660
No, no, no.

528
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,400
Just so they don't think it's you, you know?

529
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,520
There's a solo on a balloon.

530
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,080
Sound solo on a balloon.

531
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,960
But they're all on the same team.

532
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,220
What do you mean they don't think it's you?

533
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,640
Dude, they won't know.

534
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,060
They won't know, bro.

535
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,620
They'll just be like, you have a gun?

536
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,180
You must get it.

537
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,700
Oh, he's got a gun.

538
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,640
No, that's a friendly.

539
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,020
You see a gun in your back and they're gonna run away from you.

540
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,860
And then you're gonna lead them to the actual seekers.

541
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,080
There's no rules against it.

542
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,700
It just says we can't shoot.

543
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,780
Just says we can't shoot, guys.

544
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,920
It says we can't shoot people.

545
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,360
Yeah.

546
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,420
And also NPCs.

547
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
And PvE.

548
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
Yeah, we can't shoot the NPC.

549
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,140
Okay.

550
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,640
I'm scanning the ring for us.

551
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,440
Getting that intel.

552
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,900
It pulls away.

553
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,280
Oh, hey, you guys are in zone.

554
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,240
It's possibly the worst spot for hiding.

555
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,360
Hey, friendly.

556
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,320
There's a friendly near me, too.

557
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,600
This is the worst.

558
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,220
Oh my god.

559
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,640
You guys don't hear shots, right?

560
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,420
No.

561
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay, so they're not near us.

562
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,200
Dude, there's people in my tunnel.

563
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
That's fucked up.

564
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,720
How do we leave?

565
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,180
Where do I hide?

566
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,260
This guy's gonna get me caught.

567
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,520
I'm not.

568
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,640
Hey.

569
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,500
Get out of here.

570
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,100
Show your gun.

571
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,480
Should I just walk up to him with a gun and just start shooting the scene?

572
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,320
I just got punched.

573
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,500
Wait, what?

574
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
They don't have the punch?

575
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,340
Report them right now.

576
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,920
I just got punched by an Octane.

577
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,040
They started shooting at me.

578
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,740
Dude, this guy is like in my spot, but worse.

579
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,580
Is that Luda?

580
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,940
Is that Luda?

581
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,540
Or is that actually like...

582
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,480
No, it's probably a real person.

583
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,460
Or is that a... Is that a hider?

584
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,540
Probably a hider.

585
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Why is he shooting me?

586
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,760
Wait, shooting you?

587
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,420
As in like actually shooting you?

588
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

589
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,960
He was shooting me with a hemi.

590
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,580
Oh, he probably looted then.

591
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,100
Oh, okay.

592
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm putting him on the zipline.

593
00:18:59,800 --> 00:18:59,940
Luda and Octane.

594
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,500
He's right here.

595
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,440
Where is he?

596
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,860
Where is he?

597
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,820
Oh, he's close to you guys.

598
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,360
That's him.

599
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,860
That's him.

600
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,620
That's definitely him.

601
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:05,980
I'm out.

602
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,560
You guys... You guys gotta run.

603
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,920
I'm not moving.

604
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,540
Hide and seek.

605
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,900
Wait, somebody made a zip here.

606
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,780
That's scary.

607
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,060
All right.

608
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,280
If I run straight on, I might be dead.

609
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,000
No, no, no.

610
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,340
You're vented.

611
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:23,660
You're fine.

612
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,540
Just remember your ability.

613
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,580
You want to have your bird in your pocket already and then you hold it down, okay?

614
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,040
Okay, okay.

615
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,940
You don't like to re-throw it out.

616
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,840
I have my...

617
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,360
I didn't realize the bird was already out.

618
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,880
We'll have to help the scout.

619
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,380
Yeah, you gotta have the bird in the pocket and then you gotta hold down the button.

620
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,640
That's the rule.

621
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,760
The bird was already out, guys.

622
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,220
The bird was already out.

623
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,900
We'll put it back in the pocket.

624
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,320
All right.

625
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,520
Oh, there's another guy here with me.

626
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,580
I can grief them.

627
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,340
Oh my god, there's several people here with me.

628
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,500
I can grief all of them.

629
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,160
Wait, I'm stuck.

630
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,320
Wait, what?

631
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,040
That's okay.

632
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,820
It's okay.

633
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,680
Hide and seek.

634
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,040
Am I dead?

635
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,660
I know.

636
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,660
This Valk is body blocking me into the corner.

637
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:08,920
What?

638
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,500
This enemy Valk is body... like they're holding me in a corner.

639
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,480
I can't move.

640
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,940
I can't move.

641
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,900
I'm about to punch this bitch.

642
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,500
I don't even care.

643
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,840
Like she literally has me body blocked in the corner.

644
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,400
Okay, look, they punched you once so you have like one freebie.

645
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,080
They didn't punch me.

646
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,640
They punched Fudd.

647
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,140
I can't...

648
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,980
Yeah, one freebie.

649
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,800
Oh, I jumped.

650
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,240
I'm out.

651
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,100
Quick, this guy.

652
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,540
Is that a Kraber?

653
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,020
It's a fucking Devo.

654
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,720
There's no way.

655
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,140
Okay, I'd rather have it be a Devo than a Kraber.

656
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,680
I'm not gonna lie.

657
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,840
Wait, is there... can I be under there?

658
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,560
I got apple juice.

659
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,800
There's no way they'd see me over here.

660
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,820
Guys, I hear an Octane stimming.

661
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,660
No, you don't.

662
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,060
Okay, you're right.

663
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,900
I don't hear anything.

664
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,840
I'll turn my audio off.

665
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,380
No, you don't.

666
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,460
If I don't hear it, they don't hear like anything.

667
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,620
Exactly, exactly.

668
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,700
There's no way they'll know I'm here.

669
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,540
I have like the perfect hiding spot in the open.

670
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,060
Oh.

671
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,140
Guys, we have to change our skins after this game or Fudd does.

672
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,980
He's all colorful.

673
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,700
Oh yeah, that's true.

674
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,800
He ain't hiding.

675
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
Fudd, where's... don't you know about the skin meta?

676
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,020
No.

677
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,800
Bro, you're supposed to change it to something worse.

678
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,660
I'm white in the mountains.

679
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,760
No, I... well... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

680
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,660
I didn't know it was this side of the map, you know?

681
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,060
Because it was obvious.

682
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,600
Come on.

683
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,120
I could've been... I could've been lava-oriented, you know?

684
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,360
Ooh.

685
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,340
Well, I hope that was not any of those guys that scanned the beacon.

686
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,540
No, no, no.

687
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:34,920
They're not allowed.

688
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,420
Oh, they're not allowed?

689
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,040
Oh, thank god.

690
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,320
Okay.

691
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,880
Yeah, they're not allowed to scan beacon.

692
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,560
Ludu is right above me.

693
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,340
I'm in tunnel.

694
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,480
Wait, how do you know?

695
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,040
Do you hear shots?

696
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,820
He just killed that grouch guy.

697
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,020
Oh, okay.

698
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm gonna run then.

699
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,720
I don't trust myself being here then.

700
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
No, no, I'm not near you.

701
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,240
You're fine.

702
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:53,960
Oh, hey.

703
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,780
There's like other people here with me too.

704
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,140
Fudd is near you, not me.

705
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,780
You're good.

706
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,760
I'm across the map.

707
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,480
I'm gonna go across the map.

708
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,060
Fuck this.

709
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,860
Hey, guys.

710
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,140
You're going into zone?

711
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,220
Yeah, I'm going into zone.

712
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,800
Fuck this.

713
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,800
Actually, no.

714
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,960
The zone hurts a little.

715
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,600
What's that?

716
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,020
What's that?

717
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,520
Guys?

718
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,340
I'll see you on the other side.

719
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,460
You dead?

720
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,740
I'm gonna go on the other side.

721
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,780
I'm going to travel across the map.

722
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm gonna travel across the map.

723
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,800
I don't wanna be on this side anymore.

724
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,600
This side's scary.

725
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,260
I ain't doing no traveling.

726
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,580
Oh, there's people over there.

727
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,380
There's people over there.

728
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,160
There's people over there.

729
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,480
Never mind.

730
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,200
I'm gonna travel.

731
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,420
Just stop moving.

732
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,620
I can't.

733
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,200
I'm sweating.

734
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,700
Find a corner and sit in it.

735
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,080
There's a dude sitting in this corner.

736
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
He's playing in-game fun.

737
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,340
Oh, no.

738
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,880
Oh, he's with you, Fudd.

739
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,560
He's with you!

740
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,740
Oh, Mirage.

741
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,660
Mirage.

742
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,580
Oh, my God.

743
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,140
Wait, Mirage.

744
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,660
Oh, yeah.

745
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:58,980
There's...

746
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,580
There's double aim assist.

747
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,400
There's double aim assist.

748
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,140
We're fine.

749
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,480
We're fine.

750
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,920
There's double aim assist and it's not like you can shoot back.

751
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,040
Like, you get away for two seconds and be like, alright, where's the phone?

752
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,320
Oh, my God.

753
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,940
We should have had the gun in our backs.

754
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,560
We should have...

755
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,340
Oh, it's okay.

756
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,060
Oh, my God.

757
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,600
There's eight guys.

758
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,960
Oh, guys, leave me!

759
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,600
Leave me!

760
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,400
Guys!

761
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,100
Okay, he's where I am.

762
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,020
He's where I am.

763
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,020
Run!

764
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,640
Run!

765
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,980
He's where I am!

766
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,560
Wait, I'm resible.

767
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,680
Guys!

768
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,780
No, no.

769
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,120
All I'm saying...

770
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,940
No, no, no.

771
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,180
That was the most crazy I'm resible call ever.

772
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,240
Res me.

773
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,000
Res me now.

774
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,940
I was like, no, I don't think so.

775
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,020
I'm in tunnel 103.

776
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,820
Dude, like 300 meters away sitting in a corner.

777
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,420
I'm resible.

778
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,020
No, I saw Fun.

779
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,480
Fun was close by.

780
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,940
I saw him close by.

781
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,260
That's fair.

782
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,580
Dude, get away from me.

783
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,460
You see these guys?

784
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,020
What is this gonna be?

785
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,500
It was 100% resible.

786
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
I can't believe you guys won't res your IGL.

787
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,060
He knifed Greek.

788
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,960
He knifed Greek.

789
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,620
That's to me.

790
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,100
Oh, my God.

791
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,940
Bro, you're so fucking dead at the moment.

792
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,900
You hit the road date.

793
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,200
No, Fun's not.

794
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,180
Yeah, ref.

795
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,680
No, you are though.

796
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,900
You're fucking dead.

797
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,040
No, I'm not.

798
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,420
I'm still alive.

799
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,940
How are you gonna do this?

800
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,160
How are you gonna do this?

801
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,800
You wanna see?

802
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,880
Yeah, I'm watching.

803
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,800
I'm watching how you...

804
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,020
Yeah, make the loudest sound you can.

805
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,840
Oh.

806
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,300
Oh.

807
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,880
Wait, he has a gun.

808
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,560
Reptile.

809
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,540
He has a gun, Reptile.

810
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,480
He didn't hear or see anything.

811
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,360
I saw nothing.

812
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,500
Holy shit.

813
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,160
He's shooting in front of you, Reptile.

814
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,740
That guy doesn't know about the spot apparently.

815
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,160
Is that Timmy?

816
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,000
Was that fucking...

817
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,720
No, no, no, no.

818
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,580
That was Luda.

819
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,920
That was Luda?

820
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,460
Yeah.

821
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,680
Let's see.

822
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,840
Okay, Fun's also equally fucked.

823
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,180
I see him fucking running in the open right now.

824
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,400
With his glowing heirloom.

825
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:13,840
Doc's dead.

826
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,560
Doc's dead.

827
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:14,920
Doc's dead.

828
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,280
Oh shit, we're better.

829
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,780
Fucking noob.

830
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,460
Yeah.

831
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,800
Can't believe it.

832
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,820
That's why he's getting kicked off NRG.

833
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,620
He's not even getting kicked off.

834
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,200
He's already kicked off.

835
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,260
Oh yeah, he's already... Sorry, they already announced it.

836
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:27,760
Yeah.

837
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,320
Right here live in this hide and seek tournament.

838
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,220
Is when you find out.

839
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,540
Okay, there's like gunshots like literally right next to you, Reptile.

840
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,800
I don't know about this.

841
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:42,920
Oh.

842
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,760
Whoa.

843
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,140
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, don't worry.

844
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,860
Is it okay?

845
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,020
It's all gonna be okay, don't worry.

846
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,840
Yeah, I feel so safe.

847
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,700
Wait, wait.

848
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,220
If you can like get behind him.

849
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,980
I'm getting this guy killed.

850
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,500
I don't give a fuck.

851
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,160
I'm not letting him move.

853
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,780
He's not allowed to move.

854
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,620
I have him trapped in the corner.

855
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,060
That's an enemy.

856
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,320
That's an enemy right there.

857
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,120
That's Luda right there!

858
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,900
I have them both trapped in the corner out of zine.

859
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,860
Oh my god.

860
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,600
Wait, you do?

861
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,900
No, I don't.

862
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,600
I don't.

863
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:16,960
I don't.

864
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,940
I don't.

865
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,180
I lied.

866
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,340
Why are you playing Duck Hunt right now?

867
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,620
Why did you do that?

868
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,620
Because I need to get away from those guys!

869
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,640
Bro, he's coming for you.

870
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,100
No, he's not.

871
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,480
Alright.

872
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,220
What do you mean why am I playing Duck Hunt?

873
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
I don't want to be next to them.

874
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,220
Yeah, but I thought you said you wanted to get them killed.

875
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,500
I tried!

876
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,640
What do you mean?

877
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,860
I literally tried trapping them in the corner, but I couldn't.

878
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,460
Guys, this is a rank one prank.

879
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,520
Guys...

880
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,500
Guys, this is a rank one...

881
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,480
Oh, he's coming!

882
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,060
He's coming!

883
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,400
Find people!

884
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,300
Find people, Riftar!

885
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm getting away from fun.

886
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,800
No, no, no.

887
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,000
I gotta find people.

889
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,300
That's a good job.

890
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,600
Find people!

891
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,060
If you're gonna die, you gotta take people with you.

892
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,900
No, it's okay.

893
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,260
They can't.

894
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,040
Yeah?

895
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,440
I found one!

896
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:09,780
I found one!

897
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,080
I found one!

898
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,200
Oh, oh yes!

899
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
Dude, kill this guy!

900
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,760
Not me!

901
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
I found him!

902
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,340
Look, look, look!

903
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:20,840
I found him!

904
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,980
He just all three feet away.

905
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,320
That guy didn't even get the... Like, he didn't even die for that!

906
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,320
He didn't even shoot him!

907
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,820
That's the worst part!

908
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,280
Fun, please.

909
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,440
You're our only hope.

910
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,420
You are our strength.

911
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,740
Remember, we put all our resources into you.

912
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,600
Oh.

913
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:44,920
Oh.

914
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,500
Oh.

915
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,180
Oh.

916
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Oh.

917
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:47,780
Oh.

918
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,200
Wait, that's friendly.

919
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,500
No.

920
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:49,660
No.

921
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,220
Those are both friendly.

922
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,440
Oh, that's not friendly!

923
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,860
That's not friendly fun!

924
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:53,820
Fun!

925
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,140
Fun!

926
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,660
I think he's... Fun.

927
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,080
You're okay.

928
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,840
He's gonna get distracted.

929
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,900
He's gonna get distracted by that path.

930
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

931
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:58,880
I see that.

932
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
Oh my god, what happened to the model?

933
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,520
The model fucking...

934
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,260
Go on, I'm Res-able.

935
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,960
I'm Res-able too.

936
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,460
I'm Res-able too.

937
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,700
Wait, we should play somebody to craft us.

938
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,020
Yeah, that would do a lot in this situation.

939
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,880
Yeah, not gonna lie, we could have got... We could have 100% been crafted.

940
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,460
Come on, you can get top 10.

941
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,340
I believe in you.

942
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,700
Wait, that guy is... He's playing Lifeline or Sophras.

943
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,160
I think.

944
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,040
Oh, maybe not.

945
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,600
Wait, that's so smart.

946
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,000
Wait, what the fu... Who's he?

947
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,420
Drop him out of zone phone.

948
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,160
Drop him out of zone phone.

949
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,400
That guy died right next to you.

950
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,740
He literally died right next to you.

951
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,280
Guys, top 10.

952
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,840
We're top 10!

953
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,120
It doesn't matter anyway, but we're still top 10.

954
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,280
No, no, no.

955
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,280
It does.

956
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,340
It does.

957
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,980
We need top 3.

958
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,480
We need top 3.

959
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,680
What do we do when we're top 10?

960
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,140
We top 3.

961
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,140
Top 3 is the only placement that matters.

962
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,560
We're gonna charity even harder.

963
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,440
Okay, fun.

964
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,860
We saw that.

965
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,700
Dude, why did he come back?

966
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,720
I don't know.

967
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,500
That Pathfinder is evil.

968
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,960
It's okay.

969
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,060
We got top 10.

970
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,680
Why did he come back?

971
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,240
That Path... Dude, what...

972
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,600
What the fuck?

973
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,840
How did he not see this guy?

974
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,460
I should have gotten that Pathfinder killed.

975
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,900
I should have went for the Pathfinder.

976
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,320
Yeah, you should have.

977
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,520
What is... Oh no.

978
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,480
How is he just sitting there?

979
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,460
How did he just let him sit there?

980
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,480
How did Tempo live that long?

981
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,000
Was that Tempo and Path, bro?

982
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,680
What's that?

983
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,460
I don't know.

984
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,860
I'm pretty sure the Path died.

985
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,440
Oh my god!

986
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,540
He did it!

987
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,320
That guy literally stood in between the rocks!

988
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,200
Yeah, he stood still for so long.

989
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,980
I can't believe it.

990
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,780
This is a scam.

991
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,340
I'm playing Ultir.

992
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,260
I got scammed.

993
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,820
We got scammed.

994
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,380
We got scammed for charity.

995
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,880
That dude sold my spot.

996
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,080
I shouldn't have moved if I didn't move.

997
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:49,920
True.

998
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,360
Yeah, he heard you.

999
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,740
He heard your fucking movement.

1000
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,620
It's okay, guys.

1001
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,080
We placed higher than Nocturnal's team.

1002
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,720
Honestly, in life, that's all that matters.

1003
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,560
Yeah, that's all that matters.

1004
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,180
That's why I'm the better IGL.

1005
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,340
Dude, they had 71 kills.

1006
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:09,840
Holy shit.

1007
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,780
Alright.

1008
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,220
Holy moly.

1009
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,920
Hey, we got top 10.

1010
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,220
Let's fucking go.

1011
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,610
Who was it?

1012
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,070
Where's Dolphins team?

1013
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,010
Oh, was he the guy that like, ratted you out?

1014
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:26,730
It won't let me...

1015
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,490
It won't let me... It won't let me view his skin.

1016
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,810
Oh, is the lobby broken?

1017
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,290
Wait, how is it broken?

1018
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,110
The in progress...

1019
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,390
He said, can hiders pick up ammo?

1020
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,450
No.

1021
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,430
Why are we...

1022
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,930
Oh, yeah.

1023
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,430
They're running out of ammo.

1024
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,270
They're shooting us.

1025
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,310
Yeah, fuck you guys.

1026
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,910
You don't deserve ammo.

1027
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,070
Zach Mazur, you're trying to kill my friends.

1028
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,990
No, I won't help you.

1029
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,770
Go craft your ammo.

1030
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,210
Someone said I'm not a Fortnite Lava.

1031
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,350
Yeah, if you run out of ammo, just fucking punch.

1032
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,550
We will take the Kramer.

1033
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,750
Wait, what map is next?

1034
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,150
There's no?

1035
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,570
One of them.

1036
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,790
One of them.

1037
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,790
I don't know the order actually.

1038
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,690
Tournament.

1039
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,850
It is King's Canyon.

1040
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,690
King's Canyon?

1041
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,350
Oh, okay.

1042
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,550
Same comp?

1043
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:26,910
I'm playing Altair.

1044
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,110
Oh, Altair.

1045
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,430
Okay.

1046
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,870
I'll be Vantage.

1047
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,350
I'll scan everything.

1048
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,610
Yay.

1049
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,430
I bet you the people...

1050
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,010
People who aren't there just haven't... didn't wake up in time.

1051
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:41,970
True.

1052
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,070
What if we just play Res Comp and they run out of ammo?

1053
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,850
That's so true.

1054
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,890
Okay, one of us...

1055
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,010
If it was three strikes, I'd be down.

1056
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,410
I'll do it.

1057
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,650
That's why Newcastle, like, what's... like, they're gonna run out of bullets, right?

1058
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,090
Yeah, but that means we gotta stick together.

1059
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,370
Three people running in a pack is not hiding.

1060
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,230
I mean, like, there's just one guy's chasing us.

1061
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,310
We just keep losing.

1062
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,350
Just keep dancing on the shield.

1063
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,750
Wait, actually...

1064
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,730
Just keep resisting.

1065
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:13,710
Actually...

1066
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,370
Okay, what happens in Final Zone, though?

1067
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,510
What about Final Zone?

1068
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,890
We're still alive.

1069
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,570
We wall off ourselves.

1070
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,030
We actually win the game.

1071
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,910
We wall off Newcastle ourselves against a rock.

1072
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,570
Oh, you're right.

1073
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,850
We outnumber them by sheer willpower.

1074
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,350
Alright, we'll see.

1075
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,410
We'll see how it goes.

1076
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,070
We'll see how this goes.

1077
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,970
No, we should do it for one game at least.

1078
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,510
We should do it when we get a car.

1079
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,450
Oh my god, yes!

1080
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,170
Storm point!

1081
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,070
Storm point!

1082
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:49,750
Storm point!

1083
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:50,530
Newcastle!

1084
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,950
Newcastle, Lifeline, and who's the third?

1085
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,170
We just play Watson?

1086
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,350
Just give us shield gen on the car?

1087
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,950
Can we put a gen on the car?

1088
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,450
Yeah!

1089
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,850
Give us shield gen on the car.

1090
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,750
Can we put two on the car?

1091
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,270
No, I don't think so.

1092
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,410
I think it only has the one spot on top.

1093
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,630
Put it on the front and the...

1094
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,730
Wait, can we not put it on the back?

1095
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:07,830
I don't think so.

1096
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,270
Wait, you're right.

1097
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:08,850
You might be able to.

1098
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,190
No!

1099
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,710
Wait, we could try.

1100
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,730
We might as well.

1101
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,070
The armored car strat.

1102
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,830
If we're gonna have a car, we have to play Lifeline though.

1103
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,730
Wait, you might wanna...

1104
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,110
Wait, I might wanna play Path for this map.

1105
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,510
When King's Canyon?

1106
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,050
Zip over.

1107
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,090
I'm playing Altar.

1108
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,170
Yeah, I'm playing Vantage.

1109
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,270
Don't worry, we got this.

1110
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,890
The heavy armored car strat.

1111
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,330
The armored car strat.

1112
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,010
Put Rampart walls on it.

1113
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,410
We just play Gibby.

1114
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,090
We just play Gibby car.

1115
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,630
We just play Gibby car.

1116
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,570
They can't kill us.

1117
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,250
No, I'm not even kidding.

1118
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,370
Wait, that's true.

1119
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,210
Wait, what do we do?

1120
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,730
Gibby, Newcastle, Lifeline.

1121
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,130
I mean, I'm...

1122
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,370
We'll hide in the open.

1123
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:49,910
Yeah.

1124
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,510
Hide in a car in the open.

1125
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,390
They can't get us.

1126
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,130
Or should we do like Gibby, Newcastle, Watson or Gibby, Newcastle, Lifeline?

1127
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:57,710
Oh yeah, well, that's probably...

1128
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,890
Maybe we skip Newcastle.

1129
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,130
Maybe we just do Gibby, Lifeline, Watson.

1130
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,550
Oh, Gibby, Lifeline.

1131
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,890
That rest is gonna be very tricky.

1132
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,410
No, no, no, no, no.

1133
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,090
It's not for the rest.

1134
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:08,610
It's not for the rest.

1135
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,150
It's for the car.

1136
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,210
We just live in a car forever.

1137
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,770
We just... the car is our rest.

1138
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,530
Okay, Gibby, Lifeline, Watson.

1139
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:14,910
Nice.

1140
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,430
We got it, guys.

1141
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,570
We perfected the strat.

1142
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,210
Because the thing you have to think about, right?

1143
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,210
The Seekers aren't working together.

1144
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:25,250
And if we're in a car, how are they gonna kill us all out of a car?

1145
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,170
Oh, that's true.

1146
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,010
That is so fucking true.

1147
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,730
I feel like we should get another car just to distract the other... the main car.

1148
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,190
Yeah, but then we don't have Bubble on both cars.

1149
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,570
Oh, shit.

1150
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,270
Yes!

1151
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,930
We're living because we have Bubble.

1152
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,930
No, no, no, no.

1153
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,590
The Lifeline.

1154
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,090
The Lifeline gets... oh, wait.

1155
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,010
But then what's the point of having a Lifeline?

1156
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,070
We can't rest.

1157
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,130
All I'm saying is that we could have one Proust.

1158
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,470
I feel like we can, like... first, we start off with two cars.

1159
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,410
And then use the other car to distract people.

1160
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:02,810
And then after the zone starts getting smaller, we, like... we go... we merge our cars.

1161
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,670
We scatter cars.

1162
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:04,970
We have three cars.

1163
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,390
There are no cars in KC?

1164
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,210
I know we're planning.

1165
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,410
Yeah, we're planning ahead.

1166
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:09,830
We're planning for Dexmed.

1167
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,530
Yeah, yeah.

1168
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,890
We're 50 steps ahead of The Seekers.

1169
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,270
This game, we're gonna be tree-gang.

1170
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,350
Yeah, yeah.

1171
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,230
Oh, you're right!

1172
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,390
You're right!

1173
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,770
They're gonna be shitty at trees!

1174
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:29,510
Wait, that means like every... all of them will think that we're in trees but I'll be like in the open cause they'll know I'm not expected.

1175
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,030
They'll be too busy looking up.

1176
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,550
They won't even look at the actual map.

1177
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1178
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,690
They won't expect looking up.

1179
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,370
I wish there was pruning in this game.

1180
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:39,890
I would just prune.

1181
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:40,510
They would never see me.

1182
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,250
We should land somewhere with holds.

1183
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:43,870
Rue.

1184
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,110
I thought you were going to be at Map Room.

1185
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,050
Rue.

1186
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,850
What happened to the Map Room?

1187
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,550
We can do the double hold.

1188
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:59,230
Yeah, double Evo on the hold and then hit Map Room for Insta Blue.

1189
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,790
Oh, true.

1190
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,310
You don't even need to play Vantage.

1191
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,730
You can play Movement.

1192
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,490
No!

1193
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,390
Because we can hit Map Room on this map.

1194
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,830
It shows us the world.

1195
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,090
I hope Map Room is not in zone.

1196
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,070
So I'm useful.

1197
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,130
So I'd be useful.

1198
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,770
I hope Map Room was just out of zone.

1199
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,450
You got to start pointing your ult at people.

1200
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,550
At other hiders.

1201
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,150
Oh!

1202
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,030
Seeker.

1203
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,470
Oh!

1204
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,670
You're right.

1205
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,850
Oh, it's first!

1206
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,910
Are we all just going to land on Map Room?

1207
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:38,730
Yeah.

1208
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,230
We just live there.

1209
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,590
Should I just open the hold with ult here?

1210
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,270
You can't anymore.

1211
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,030
It's patched.

1212
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,070
No, I'm pretty sure you can.

1213
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,190
We all live here now.

1214
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,130
I think it's patched.

1215
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,410
I'm pretty sure they fixed the crash, but I think you can still go through with ult here.

1216
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,210
Guys, I feel like if we all live in Map Room, I feel like all the Seekers are still there.

1217
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,470
I feel like we're just going to run Mach 10 to the Map Room.

1218
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,250
Have a look.

1219
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,810
Yeah, but they'll see the Map Room scans.

1220
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,050
Oh.

1221
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,590
What is it?

1222
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,590
Hit ours first.

1223
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,490
Or am I just crazy?

1224
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,490
Nice.

1225
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,070
It's not a grenade fun.

1226
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,970
Wait, does each scan give you armor?

1227
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,630
No, not from this.

1228
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,550
I don't think Map Room gives anything.

1229
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,350
Just the first one.

1230
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,550
Oh, okay.

1231
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,430
So I'm just going to go do this then.

1232
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,030
I think it does.

1233
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,630
I have a grenade.

1234
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,130
But actually, no.

1235
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,190
I'm going to go do downslope.

1236
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,770
All right, so Reptar is going to live in the Map Room because it's not in zone.

1237
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,690
Hold on, wait, hold on, wait.

1238
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,710
All right, go.

1239
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,630
All right, I'm going to go to this other scan.

1240
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,050
I think we get blue here.

1241
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,770
Oh, we will as soon as the thing's popped.

1242
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,230
Yay.

1243
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,970
Oh, yeah, you can just go hit the beacon.

1244
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,370
It'll be fun.

1245
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1246
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,590
I'll get it in the beacon.

1247
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,170
Dude, this Geo Kinto guy died fast.

1248
00:37:59,170 --> 00:37:59,870
I think he died first last game too.

1249
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,930
I don't think that guy knows how to hide.

1250
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,730
I think he just lands wherever the Seeker is.

1251
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,030
He's just like, oh, there's nobody going over here.

1252
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:07,650
Let me go over here.

1253
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:07,950
Yeah.

1254
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,570
All right, we'll know where the Seekers are from this.

1255
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,810
Why is everybody in air base?

1256
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,910
What the fuck?

1257
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,530
What's wrong with them?

1258
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,750
The game ends, I guess.

1259
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,690
What's wrong with them?

1260
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,070
Oh, my God, an air base ending?

1261
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:23,630
We need to go.

1262
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,390
We need to go on the outside under the stairs.

1263
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,570
Okay, don't worry, guys.

1264
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,850
I've got the scan too.

1265
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,150
Don't worry, guys.

1266
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,410
Don't worry.

1267
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,410
You want to go get the hold over here, Saf?

1268
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,310
We got this.

1269
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,990
All right, I'm going to head to Relic for more scans.

1270
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,930
All right, if I die, don't come to Relic.

1271
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,150
Good goms.

1272
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,310
No, it's okay.

1273
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,510
I think they're going to murder air base first.

1274
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,110
Yeah, they have to.

1275
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,290
Look, Zac's dead.

1276
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,350
Bye, Zac.

1277
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,650
I swear, I have like the worst fucking...

1278
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:00,790
I don't know.

1279
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,430
I don't know if here they're going to curse because that's a shooting...

1280
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,670
What if like I shot somebody's foot, like, is that illegal?

1281
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,090
It's not allowed.

1282
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,950
Do you have a laser pointer?

1283
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,470
I think I use it as a laser pointer.

1284
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,330
I'm just pointing at other people.

1285
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:19,450
Why?

1286
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,850
I just start pointing at people.

1287
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,890
They're going to be like, stop, dude.

1288
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,370
Bro...

1289
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:28,910
Okay.

1290
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,250
Okay.

1291
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,970
If you want to live long enough, I can use that as a laser pointer.

1292
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,390
And just point people out.

1293
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,930
You have a grenade ripped?

1294
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,630
Oh, I got one.

1295
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,930
I'm grabbing...

1296
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,050
I grabbed another one.

1297
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,750
Alright guys, if I die in Relic, don't come there.

1298
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,150
Alright, heading over.

1299
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,650
These are all my scopes.

1300
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:52,850
And barrels.

1301
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,210
All these attachments are mine.

1302
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,010
I just hope... I hope this...

1303
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:57,390
Dr. Loyal?

1304
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,310
Wait, we can put it somewhere.

1305
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,570
I think you do.

1306
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,050
Or do I take the minus 10 second cooldown for IQ?

1307
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,750
I think the infinite one because it's so hard to see.

1308
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,370
That's true.

1309
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,490
Dude, we can go put it in endgame.

1310
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,530
And run away.

1311
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,750
In endgame and run away.

1312
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,210
True.

1313
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,870
Oh, like the deploy deploy?

1314
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,370
I don't know what that guy is doing.

1315
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:17,830
I'm scared.

1316
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,330
No, no, no.

1317
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,410
My ult... Have you played with Ulti?

1318
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,290
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1319
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,750
He got the CP ult.

1320
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:26,910
Alright.

1321
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,230
I'm gonna go up on the...

1322
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,530
Alright, I'm gonna go craft a...

1323
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,050
Actually, I don't need... What am I crafting?

1324
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:36,430
I mean...

1325
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,570
I'm gonna go grab these scans.

1326
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,370
I'm gonna go craft a bat.

1327
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,390
Yeah, I'm gonna go craft a bat just in case.

1328
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:43,970
Four cells.

1329
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,950
Oh, they're scanning too.

1330
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:49,290
Alright.

1331
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:50,750
Leave.

1332
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:51,650
Leave!

1333
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,930
I wanna scan as well.

1334
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,190
Alright, you'll see where people are here.

1335
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,870
Holy shit.

1336
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:01,170
Okay.

1337
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,690
Those are... Those are hunters.

1338
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,330
Containment hunters.

1339
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,450
Oh!

1340
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:09,910
No!

1341
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,210
Relic hunter.

1342
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,730
Relic hunter.

1343
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,570
Oh my god!

1344
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,450
I thought he was friendly!

1345
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,330
You don't look friendly.

1346
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,430
Guys, I'm so Rezable, guys.

1347
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,150
Don't head to Relic, but like...

1348
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,770
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

1349
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,170
Timmy's there.

1350
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,750
Guys, all I'm saying is that Timmy will leave.

1351
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,030
I can do it.

1352
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,010
I can get the banner, actually.

1353
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,510
Wait, you get my banner and then you eat back home.

1354
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:39,610
We'll see.

1355
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,410
We'll see about that.

1356
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:40,630
I swear, RuffTard.

1357
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,950
That would be the smartest thing you've ever done in your life.

1358
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,290
Wait, are you actually gonna do it?

1359
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:47,850
You're fucking...

1360
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,090
Not anymore, I'm not going to.

1361
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,050
What do you mean?

1362
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,130
I'm not gonna do it.

1363
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,830
What the fuck was that?

1364
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,890
No, it's not Timmy.

1365
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,570
What do you mean by that's the smartest thing I've ever done in my life?

1366
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:56,870
It's not Timmy!

1367
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,570
I swear to god, it can't be him.

1368
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,770
He has to have moved on.

1369
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,410
He moved on!

1370
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,730
Don't be a little bitch!

1371
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,590
Why am I getting roasted by my dead teammate?

1372
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,330
What is going on?

1373
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,490
Because I'm your IGL.

1374
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,950
I'm gonna plug you in and he's gonna kill you.

1375
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,130
See, he's okay in the Rez me.

1376
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,910
Okay, we're gonna do it.

1377
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,490
We're so fucked.

1378
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,430
Timmy's gonna run at us, bro.

1379
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,230
I'll see you later.

1380
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,070
Bro, Timmy's gonna run at us.

1381
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,750
Oh, you plugged him?

1382
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,870
You plugged him?

1383
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,410
Yeah.

1384
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,310
See you later.

1385
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,570
Chuck bait.

1386
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,210
Ooh-ha-ha.

1387
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:37,550
Chuck bait.

1388
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,110
Okay, this was a bad idea.

1389
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,550
This was such a bad idea.

1390
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,790
I don't know why you guys did this to me.

1391
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,230
This has to be the worst idea we've ever came up.

1392
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:50,330
No!

1393
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,450
I got you!

1394
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,950
Guys, leave this place!

1395
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,910
Luna's right here!

1396
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,130
Luna's...

1397
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,490
Wait, no, it's we the people.

1398
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,530
Riptar, I'm so reasonable.

1399
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,850
I'm going for round two.

1400
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,010
All I'm saying, Riptar, is that he'll leave.

1401
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,190
Okay, okay, no, Riptar, don't go for round two.

1402
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:11,790
We might need you.

1403
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,710
Fun's gonna die.

1404
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,910
You're our only hope for charity.

1405
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:15,810
No, Fun's alive.

1406
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:16,190
Fun's alive.

1407
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:16,550
He's fine.

1408
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,930
I don't know about that.

1409
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,230
Sir!

1410
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:20,590
Live is...

1411
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,390
Wait, is that Timmy?

1412
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,870
No, that's Luna, I think.

1413
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:27,630
Timmy's on rev.

1414
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1415
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,650
What... what...

1416
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,410
Get the movement!

1417
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,710
Oh my god, that's my number rank one friend!

1418
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,510
Right there!

1419
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,130
Bro, he's just chasing you.

1420
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,010
Wait, are you actually getting me?

1421
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,010
Wait, I think you... I think you can get fun after.

1422
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:50,950
Fun's alive!

1423
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:51,670
What do you mean?

1424
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:52,670
I hit this man!

1425
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:53,330
Oh.

1426
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,350
I punched him on accident!

1427
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,950
Dude, why are we playing rev and using Havoc?

1428
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,110
They're on rev path because they're competing against each other.

1429
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:06,210
Yeah, because they... they get to win more for charity.

1430
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,530
Yeah, first place seeker wins ten grand.

1431
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,430
Yeah, for charity, right?

1432
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:11,470
Yeah.

1433
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:18,530
I was gonna say, if they get ten grand alone, and like, none of us win any money, that'd be so fucked up.

1434
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,370
How does this tournament even work?

1435
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:34,090
So, like, the... the seeker that kills the most people, basically they get to choose, like, ten... pick a charity to donate ten grand to of their choice.

1436
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:41,010
And the hiders team that wins the most points by hiding the most gets to pick the charity we want to donate to.

1437
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,670
That's basically it.

1438
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:43,770
Chat.

1439
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,290
I'm sorry, bud.

1440
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,870
I'm just getting Havoc'd.

1441
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,390
I'm too far away from you to get your hand.

1442
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:57,170
Rift, I don't know if this is a smart decision, so, like, let's hope that the seeker goes for me and not you.

1443
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,030
I'm just gonna kill somebody.

1444
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:58,650
I don't give a fuck.

1445
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,370
For charity.

1446
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,690
What are you gonna do, deduct your money from charity?

1447
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,630
Yeah, right?

1448
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:07,750
That's a mirage.

1449
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,590
You know a seeker would never play mirage.

1450
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,730
They can't take money away from charity.

1451
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,370
It's fun.

1452
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,190
No, but tempo can punish me, so...

1453
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:26,470
Yeah, guys, by the way, guys, have you heard about Nokia Apex?

1454
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:33,870
The Nokia Wi-Fi modem where you can play tournaments like this over Wi-Fi?

1455
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,250
Wowee.

1456
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,070
We're so fucked.

1457
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,610
I love Wi-Fi.

1458
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,230
I love Wi-Fi too, guys.

1459
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,510
We're all on Wi-Fi here.

1460
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,530
All... every single one of us...

1461
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,870
is on Wi-Fi.

1462
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,370
You think I can do a ring scan?

1463
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,230
Ooh, I don't like the sound of that.

1464
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,370
That was me.

1465
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,330
Oh, that was you?

1466
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:56,650
Okay.

1467
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,090
I'm just letting you know we're over here.

1468
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:01,330
Wait, what?

1469
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,950
I definitely don't like the sound of that.

1470
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,150
I fucked up my echo, but that's okay.

1471
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,370
Wait, I think I might die to zone, so that's not okay.

1472
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:13,150
Oh, no, you're fine.

1473
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:13,670
It's only zone 2.

1474
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,050
You'll be good.

1475
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:14,510
I'm just letting you know we're over here.

1476
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,430
Oh, oh, oh.

1477
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,030
You're okay.

1478
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:19,670
It's fine.

1479
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:22,570
Um.

1480
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:24,530
What?

1481
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:27,630
What?

1482
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:27,930
What?

1483
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,630
You can't just say, um.

1484
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,810
What is it?

1485
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,450
Is a seeker dead?

1486
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,150
Wait, what?

1487
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,070
Why?

1488
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,890
Chat said Luda died.

1489
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,630
How did he die?

1490
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,230
How did he fucking die?

1491
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,310
I was all tapped, but apparently he's in the kill feed.

1492
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,090
Wait, what?

1493
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:47,750
Oh, shit.

1494
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,790
He got shot.

1495
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:49,770
Did you shoot somebody?

1496
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,870
Yeah, I killed him with my PK that I dropped.

1497
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,730
I punched Timmy.

1498
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,130
Wait, he fell.

1499
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,530
Oh, my God.

1500
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,790
He fucking fell.

1501
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,150
He fell.

1502
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,210
How do you fall?

1503
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,550
There's, like, no way to fall.

1504
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,690
Oh, there's definitely ways to fall off the map.

1505
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:09,770
What?

1506
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,570
But, like, in one...

1507
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,530
It's probably an air base.

1508
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,130
Just fall off the map or some shit.

1509
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,310
Oh, that's pretty fucking stupid.

1510
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,410
Well, it's just Timmy versus people, then.

1511
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,950
What happens if all the seekers fall?

1512
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:26,350
Oh, that would be great.

1513
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,530
What if I just carry this gun around?

1514
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:30,830
Then everyone wins.

1515
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:32,770
Alright, let's see.

1516
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,250
Oh, yeah.

1517
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,270
No, nobody's getting grenade off my body.

1518
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:35,750
Yeah, do it.

1519
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,570
Yeah, I don't think I can.

1520
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,170
It does.

1521
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:39,470
It does.

1522
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:39,730
It does.

1523
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,010
That's why you had to...

1524
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,310
Alright, I'm heading over.

1525
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,630
What if I do a scan?

1526
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:50,550
Should I do a scan?

1527
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:55,290
Alright, they're gonna know I'm here, guys.

1528
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:56,270
They're gonna know I'm here.

1529
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,770
Here you go.

1530
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:00,830
Alright, look.

1531
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:01,930
These are all the people.

1532
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,490
Wait, did you... Wait, it doesn't show for me.

1533
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:06,550
Oh, it doesn't show?

1534
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,010
Oh, wait.

1535
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,850
Okay, now you know.

1536
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,070
It's because I'm dead.

1537
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:10,990
Yeah, I think so, too.

1538
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,410
Okay, so...

1539
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,690
Luda got alter-kidnapped.

1540
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,970
He got alter-kidnapped?!

1541
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:18,250
Off the map, bro?

1542
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:18,890
That is...

1543
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,130
That is actually too funny.

1544
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,030
Okay, that's actually great.

1545
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,090
Wait, that's actually fucking hilarious.

1546
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:27,270
Anybody got a clip?

1547
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:29,870
Timmy's right beside me.

1548
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:35,630
Dude, I ran into NoName and Timmy's just standing in the middle of the fucking road like it's a goddamn wild west.

1549
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,410
Why is the Nexus so far, Raptor?

1550
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:38,710
Yarrr!

1551
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,670
Well I placed the Nexus and then I opened a pill on it and it broke it.

1552
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:43,530
Nooo!

1553
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,650
Oh this is a fuck zone.

1554
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,290
That would have been my fucking lifeline right there.

1555
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,490
Okay I have Nexus at 18% again.

1556
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:54,810
Don't worry.

1557
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:54,990
Okay.

1558
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,350
Rep, you know the pipe on the second...

1559
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:58,950
Outside?

1560
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,990
Yeah, outside the window.

1561
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,570
You can go up above the window.

1562
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,910
That guy has an Energize dip.

1563
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:07,490
I don't like that.

1564
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:08,370
That's not...

1565
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,050
Wait, Energize is good.

1566
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,590
Energize is good.

1567
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,110
I'm pretty sure the path is dead.

1568
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,710
Timmy's on Rev.

1569
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,430
Timmy's on me!

1570
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,110
Don't come here!

1571
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,390
Don't come here!

1572
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,370
Timmy's on me!

1573
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,410
But you know this spot I'm talking about?

1574
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:22,910
Like right here.

1575
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:25,190
Like right here right?

1576
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:25,850
Yeah.

1577
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,170
And then you can go up and down freely.

1578
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,090
But there's also the other one.

1579
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,050
As well.

1580
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,210
As like the alcove.

1581
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:37,230
Man if only I had that fucking beacon there.

1582
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,090
It wasn't close enough to you.

1583
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,970
If only I had that beacon.

1584
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,330
Go to the other one.

1585
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,390
The other one's better I think.

1586
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,170
Cause it has a ledge.

1587
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,460
Oh.

1588
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,320
That's a friendly person.

1589
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,380
No it's not!

1590
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,200
That's gunfire.

1591
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,640
That's a friendly person.

1592
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,620
That is so friendly.

1593
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,940
That's not friendly people.

1594
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,600
Bro that was obviously what the fuck.

1595
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:10,960
Uh.

1596
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,360
I thought it was a friendly person.

1597
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,560
Wait peeps dead!

1598
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,020
Finish her!

1599
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,700
Finish her!

1600
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,200
Finish her!

1601
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,040
Wait how did he die?

1602
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,520
Peeps died to zone.

1603
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,080
Wait.

1604
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,560
Oh I could've lived.

1605
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,240
I'm sad now.

1606
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,660
How did he die?

1607
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:21,860
He died to zone.

1608
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,660
Cause he's a noob.

1609
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,740
And he stimmed himself to death.

1610
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,060
Wait really?

1611
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,820
You could've won that!

1612
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,600
Oh wait.

1613
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,400
Wait I think Timmy could die then.

1614
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,920
He doesn't have enough ammo for this.

1615
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:32,580
Boom.

1616
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,340
Boom Razzle punched him too.

1617
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:34,920
Hahaha.

1618
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,900
Maybe he's just getting bullied.

1619
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,700
Well Timmy could literally just win the charity tournament right now by farming all these people.

1620
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,920
I'm gonna be honest.

1621
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,580
I think he's already won.

1622
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,060
Yeah.

1623
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,600
100%.

1624
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,400
After this one yeah!

1625
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,320
Oh bro.

1626
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,700
We should be seekers.

1627
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,700
Honestly if you die to zone you should rotate.

1628
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,760
You should get rotated out.

1629
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,060
If you die to zone.

1630
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,020
Okay guys.

1631
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,440
We have to We have to like... if we... we have to like kidnap one of them off-zone then.

1632
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,880
Like how the fuck is Timmy gonna have enough ammo for this?

1633
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,240
Bro, he baited... he got baited into an altar ult off the map.

1634
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,960
Wait, do you have the clip?

1635
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,140
Yeah, I got a clip.

1636
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:29,400
Wait, wait, wait, DM DM, I wanna see, I wanna see.

1637
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,640
It's so good, it's so good.

1638
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,220
DM DM DM, share it.

1639
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,320
He's actually staying away.

1640
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,860
Here you go guys, we're watching it live, I'm watching it live with you guys.

1641
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,480
Let's see, what is this?

1642
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,220
Wait...

1643
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,660
Wait a minute, what?

1644
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,240
Oh my god!

1645
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,720
That is actually amazing.

1646
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:06,360
Holy shit.

1647
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,700
Oh my god, that's actually crazy!

1648
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,020
Bro...

1649
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:22,180
All I'm saying is, if you get... if you get fucking baited off the map, you should get rotated out.

1650
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,820
If you die to zone, you lose seeker privileges.

1651
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,280
Yeah, you lose seeker privileges.

1652
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,100
Bro, all the hiders should just gang up on him.

1653
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,400
And just punch him out.

1654
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,580
One... one seeker left.

1655
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,440
Yeah!

1656
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,120
When he gets to ring six, the hiders can fight back.

1657
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,580
The hiders should all just punch him into the zone.

1658
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,660
They should just like all surround him.

1659
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,500
No, because there's gonna be...

1660
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,600
He's just waiting, he's just waiting.

1661
00:52:53,880 --> 00:53:00,280
There's gonna be more hiders, so he should like... the seeker... the hiders should just like... bodyblock him out of zone.

1662
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,460
Just put four of them...

1663
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,940
Bro, this is Malcolm just living right next to him, bro.

1664
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,560
What am I watching?

1665
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,760
Kim is looking like me, what the fuck?

1666
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,560
That was Kim?

1667
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,640
That was Kim.

1668
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,640
There's another rez?

1669
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,900
He literally was just like holding his head.

1670
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,000
Like, yo, what the fuck?

1671
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,640
Yo, what's up, guy?

1672
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,380
He's like, what the fuck do I do?

1673
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,340
Wait, did he run out of ammo already?

1674
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,880
I think he's just waiting.

1675
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,060
He's con... concerned.

1676
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,560
He's like, Loba.

1677
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,460
Put your ult down now.

1678
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,060
Loba, put your ult down or I won't shoot.

1679
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,520
Bro, I don't even think an ult's gonna help them.

1680
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,480
Wait, that guy's just rez-ing right next to him?

1681
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,280
I don't think he has bullets.

1682
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,960
He's trying so hard to find ammo.

1683
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,040
The seeker's hiders should...

1684
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,460
A thermite!

1685
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,300
A thermite!

1686
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,640
Oh my god, E-Rob.

1687
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,560
They're meleeing people.

1688
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,580
Oh, an R9?

1689
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,600
Bro, that's a waste of ammo, Timmy!

1690
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,280
You shouldn't be wasting ammo like this!

1691
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,460
Might as well do finishers!

1692
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,400
You're losing ammo!

1693
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,400
He's losing time right now.

1694
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,840
There's still 16 squads and 20 hundred rez beacons.

1695
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,660
There's still 32 people alive.

1696
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,520
You think I was really...

1697
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,560
I mean, I could've lived in this fuck.

1698
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,440
Who the fuck had a gun on them?

1699
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:29,860
Who the fuck had a gun on them?

1700
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:33,880
Who the fuck had a gun on them?

1701
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,540
I'm stuck on now.

1702
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,500
He's trying to grapple again!

1703
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,540
Wait, that was a crazy jump.

1704
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,300
He said, hello!

1705
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,160
Hello!

1706
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,200
Poor Timmy.

1707
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,560
He was like, maybe he has ammo.

1708
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,940
What are the odds?

1709
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,440
Bro, he's over-sensitive right now.

1710
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,020
He's overwhelmed.

1711
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,600
There's too many people going around.

1712
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:03,860
There's too many people going around.

1713
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,960
You gotta finish the job, Timmy!

1714
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,260
Where the fuck is he?

1715
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,000
Dude!

1716
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,600
Wait, are you good?

1717
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,580
Oh, that was a good shot.

1718
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,360
That was Mandy.

1719
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,420
Oh my god, you're right!

1720
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,400
There's so many!

1721
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,880
I died three times, which meant like...

1722
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,940
I made him waste his ammo three times on my body.

1723
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:27,320
Yeah, true.

1724
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,740
He should just give up at this point.

1725
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,420
He's not killing anybody else.

1726
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,040
Someone please don't make a loud noise, bro.

1727
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,740
He's like, thank you.

1728
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,100
No, but why?

1729
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:40,840
Tim, take it down.

1730
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,820
Holy shit, bro.

1731
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,000
Holy shit!

1732
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,320
Holy shit!

1733
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,780
G-Dolphin is a G, bro.

1734
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,720
G-Dolphin is a G, bro.

1735
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,380
G-Dolphin is a G, bro.

1736
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,160
Bro, that was G-Dolphin!

1737
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,000
Holy shit!

1738
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,440
Oh my god, it's personal.

1739
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,660
That was amazing.

1740
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:03,860
Oh my god, it's personal.

1741
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,080
The grenade!

1742
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,080
The grenade!

1743
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,160
The grenade!

1744
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:07,300
The grenade!

1745
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,340
They're fucking pushing him out of zone!

1746
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,180
Oh my god, they're all dead!

1747
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,780
Oh my god, they're all dead!

1748
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,380
There's so many!

1749
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,800
Holy shit!

1750
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,940
No way!

1751
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,860
Wait, Timmy's gonna die early.

1752
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,620
Timmy's dead!

1753
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:29,820
Timmy's dead!

1754
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,260
What is this?

1755
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,460
What is this?

1756
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,620
Look at that, those bodies.

1757
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:39,980
Look at that, those bodies.

1758
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,440
Okay, that was crazy.

1759
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,080
It was fucking crazy.

1760
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,720
Dude, you just whip out the Watts at all.

1761
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,800
Did I play Caustic?

1762
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,220
I didn't play Caustic, oh my god.

1763
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,860
Oh my god.

1764
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,940
Played Caustic and killed nobody.

1765
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,980
You're not allowed to do damage abilities.

1766
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,620
No, no, as a Seeker, you just don't even seek.

1767
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,780
Yeah, you just wait until end zone.

1768
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,840
That only works because two people died to zone.

1769
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,380
If you get there and fall off the map.

1770
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,520
Holy shit, I can't believe that happened for the Seeker team.

1771
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,900
Glad we aren't doing Olympus.

1772
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,060
At Seekers.

1773
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,900
Rotate Seekers.

1774
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,080
Embarrassing.

1775
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,960
Bad macro.

1776
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,000
Timmy's like looking for two.

1777
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,100
I volunteer.

1778
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,920
As the newly assigned NRG member.

1779
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,560
I'd never die to zone.

1780
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,640
I can't believe, who did that?

1781
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,640
Who baited Luda?

1782
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,430
Who even baited?

1783
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:03,270
Does anyone know who baited Luda?

1784
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,070
Did anyone bait Luda there?

1785
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:05,530
For that to happen?

1786
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,550
Is that whoever that guy is?

1787
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,810
He's a fucking king.

1788
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,260
Apparently it was Linkser.

1789
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,940
Linkser did it.

1790
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,880
It was Link.

1791
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,640
Yeah, apparently it was Linkser.

1792
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,480
Linkser.

1793
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,680
You baited Luda.

1794
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,500
DQ game for the kill server.

1795
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,540
Wait, DOW's got a kill?

1796
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,880
Oh, probably just from...

1797
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,640
I don't even know how you'd get a kill on accident.

1798
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:47,990
How did Peep...

1799
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:49,810
How did Peep die?

1800
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:51,570
Peep died to zone.

1801
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,830
He literally...

1802
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,390
He stemmed himself down to one and died to zone.

1803
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:56,950
Yeah.

1804
00:58:58,910 --> 00:58:59,690
I feel like that's like...

1805
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,370
Dolphin Adelieke troubling them.

1806
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:05,150
I feel like that's almost as embarrassing as getting...

1807
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,710
No, that's worse because he did it to himself.

1808
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,090
He knew he had one HP.

1809
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,190
Now we're on storm point.

1810
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,170
Karstrat, Karstrat.

1811
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,430
Who's playing what?

1812
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,430
Because we're doing...

1813
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,210
Did you just play the movement comp on the car?

1814
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:23,510
Are we doing like...

1815
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,250
Aren't we armoring Karstrat?

1816
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,170
Should I just play Gibby?

1817
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,010
Maybe we don't need everything.

1818
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:28,730
Maybe we just need Gibby.

1819
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,330
Gibby, Lifeline, Watson.

1820
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,670
No, we need Doki Gibby.

1821
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,470
Wait, why me Gibby?

1822
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,090
That's a lot of responsibility on the bubble.

1823
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:38,390
Yeah, that's a lot of responsibility.

1824
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,290
I don't even know how to put the bubble correctly.

1825
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:44,870
No!

1826
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:45,490
No cars!

1827
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,210
No cars!

1828
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,390
No cars, PBE?

1829
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,330
No cars?

1830
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,070
No cars, I'm mad.

1831
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,250
We're just playing movement comp.

1832
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,410
We're just playing movement comp.

1833
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,290
So what's that?

1834
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:07,650
Path, Rev, Loba.

1835
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,790
Path, Rev, Octane.

1836
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:10,730
Or Octane.

1837
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:13,050
I'll do... wait, what are you guys going to do?

1838
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:15,010
I don't want to give them ammo but also Ulti-Cells.

1839
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:16,670
Ulti-Cells?

1840
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:17,550
Yeah, picking up Ultis...

1841
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:18,010
I mean...

1842
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:20,990
You play Loba.

1843
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:22,010
I'll play Path.

1844
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:23,910
And then...

1845
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,310
Then we have the Revtar.

1846
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,410
Okay, I'll be Loba then.

1847
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:29,770
And we're just grabbing Ulti-Cells.

1848
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:31,990
Yeah.

1849
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:32,850
Ulti-Cells and bats.

1850
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:33,650
Hopefully.

1851
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,210
Okay.

1852
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,050
I can't believe it.

1853
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,930
We had the Armored Car strat!

1854
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,470
It was going to be the strat!

1855
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:42,510
Yeah, Tempo's just...

1856
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:43,870
He's kind of an asshole.

1857
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:44,630
Yeah, he knew.

1858
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,350
He fucking knew.

1859
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:50,530
He heard we were about to have fun and he was like Yeah, let's shut this down real quick.

1860
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,430
Run bang, let's hotbox the end zone.

1861
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,010
Ooh.

1862
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:58,350
Nice.

1863
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:01,590
The only reason there was actually an end zone in that game was because there was only one hider.

1864
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,330
She tried to outplay the...

1865
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,570
Outplay the Seekers.

1866
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,550
Oh, true, true.

1867
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,670
Put a loot stick in front of a door so they can't leave.

1868
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,650
They can just kick the door down.

1869
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:18,850
Jam the door.

1870
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:22,370
There's just a bunch of Rampar walls on it.

1871
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,170
Wait, that's so smart.

1872
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:33,390
We bait one of them into a room and then put like 200 Rampar into a room.

1873
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,110
So he can't get out.

1874
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,950
Wait, what map are we playing after this?

1875
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,410
Broken Moon?

1876
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:43,470
I guess so.

1877
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:44,470
Oh god.

1878
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,350
I can hide everywhere on that map.

1879
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:48,890
I can hide everywhere on that map.

1880
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,190
I don't think anyone's gonna be dead.

1881
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,760
Alright, here it is.

1882
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,200
This is it.

1883
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,540
This is it.

1884
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,040
Yay.

1885
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:05,540
Yay.

1886
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,260
Guys, it's okay guys.

1887
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,780
No matter what placement we get, in the end it's all for charity.

1888
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:13,700
True.

1889
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,800
For charity!

1890
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,200
For charity and Wi-Fi.

1891
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,240
Yeah, for charity and Wi-Fi.

1892
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,020
Hey guys.

1893
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,460
What's the website again?

1894
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,600
The Apex Wi-Fi?

1895
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,660
Apex over Wi-Fi.

1896
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,280
Guys, Apex over Wi-Fi.

1897
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,720
Okay, I don't have the command because I'm on YouTube.

1898
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,820
But if you go to Reptars and Fluff Fun Stream, which I assume they have the command, right?

1899
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,760
I do, I do.

1900
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,840
The exclamation point, Apex over Wi-Fi.

1901
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,080
You can join a giveaway!

1902
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,520
For free stuff!

1903
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,260
Hashtag ad.

1904
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,540
Hashtag ad.

1905
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,840
But we're not getting paid.

1906
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,220
So it's not a hashtag ad.

1907
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,760
We're just saying it.

1908
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,840
We're just really passionate about Wi-Fi.

1909
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,520
In fact, NRG is gonna play their World Cup with Wi-Fi.

1910
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,500
In fact, NRG is gonna play their World Cup with Wi-Fi.

1911
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:02,580
Yeah.

1912
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,520
Yeah.

1913
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,440
As the IGL.

1914
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,660
Fluff Fun is like, I hope not.

1915
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,860
You changed the router.

1916
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,900
As the IGL for NRG.

1917
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,400
I will make sure that they will play on Wi-Fi.

1918
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,440
I will make sure that they will play on Wi-Fi.

1919
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,740
I will make sure that they will play on Wi-Fi.

1920
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,780
Don't worry guys.

1921
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,240
I'm here for you, Nokia.

1922
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:24,760
Sponsor me.

1923
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,320
For real.

1924
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,020
No cars slash PVE for hiders.

1925
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,400
He said it four times and then somebody said, can we use cars?

1926
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:33,660
No PVE?

1927
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,220
But why would we use cars?

1928
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:35,700
Because cars win.

1929
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,340
He's collecting the cars.

1930
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,000
Down to sacrifice our points just to have a car.

1931
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:44,880
Honestly, same.

1932
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,240
DQ to get first.

1933
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,780
Wait, it might need to play Octane.

1934
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,800
Wait, but that means like...

1935
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,200
Wait, they said that high...

1936
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,860
Seekers can use cars, right?

1937
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah, but they can't shoot while they're driving.

1938
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,760
We need to set up road traps where they just get hit by Octane pads on their car.

1939
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,280
I'm just thinking like...

1940
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,740
What if we just take the car and then scare the other hiders?

1941
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,480
What if we just take the car and then scare the other hiders?

1942
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,900
What if we just take the car and then scare the other hiders?

1943
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,020
Just be the roadblock of the journey.

1944
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,600
Just make it more fun, but get DQ'd.

1945
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,220
Just be the roadblock of the journey.

1946
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,220
He's not gonna actually...

1947
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,960
I mean, we just scare one guy.

1948
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,000
My middle name is Zone Damage.

1949
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,520
Who will die to spiders?

1950
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,140
Who will die to spiders?

1951
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,300
Oh, that's true.

1952
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:33,740
Oh, that's true.

1953
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,040
Because there's no PVE.

1954
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,140
They can hit us, but we can't hit them.

1955
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,120
We can't hide in prowler areas.

1956
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,500
You just run.

1957
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,200
No, you can.

1958
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,880
Because the prowlers will stop spawning.

1959
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,240
Oh yeah, if there's more than one team, yeah.

1960
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:47,700
Oh yeah, if there's more than one team, yeah.

1961
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,000
Here we go.

1962
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:51,640
I believe.

1963
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,840
I believe in us.

1964
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,060
Seekers got...

1965
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,240
Seekers and Tens this...

1966
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,760
Oh yeah!

1967
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,120
That's actually fucking crazy.

1968
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,920
Camp the cannons and when they try to push you, just take it.

1969
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,400
If they take it, take it back.

1970
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:18,080
We need to collect a million bats so we can just bat every time we take a cannon.

1971
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,620
That's true.

1972
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,620
Or we put an altar portal down and teleport out of the cannon.

1973
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,420
Oh my god, that's so smart!

1974
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,680
We wait at the cannon.

1975
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,100
How do we kill them?

1976
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,600
How do we kill them?

1977
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,480
Well, we can...

1978
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,080
Teleport them off a cliff.

1979
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,600
Make a rave portal at the cannon and the portal ends at the edge of the cliff.

1980
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:50,040
No, make a portal and then the portal ends at an altar or an altar queue or something.

1981
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,760
And then it's just like a little road map to the end of the cliff.

1982
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,040
It's just a domino effect.

1983
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,620
Yeah, it's just a domino effect.

1984
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,840
It's just a portal, portal, portal, portal, death.

1985
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:05,980
Wraith, altar, ash.

1986
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,040
Three portals.

1987
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,120
That has to be like at least 100 meters.

1988
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,120
Maybe 150.

1989
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:16,520
Maybe more.

1990
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:19,500
Yeah, we can get 150 meters off of that.

1991
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,560
Wraith, altar, ash.

1992
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,760
Oh man.

1993
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,900
We're 150 meters close to a cliff.

1994
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:37,300
Oh yeah, no, they're absolutely not gonna be entering any fucking portal after the last game.

1995
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,380
There's no fucking way.

1996
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,860
They're too scared of them.

1997
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,040
They're just afraid of dying.

1998
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,670
Tempo, start the game.

1999
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,730
Start the game.

2000
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:00,650
Tempo.

2001
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,150
Oh my god.

2002
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,750
This hide and seek is wild.

2003
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:08,250
What the fuck did I just listen to?

2004
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:08,730
What?

2005
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:12,250
What is it?

2006
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,770
It's a It's a clip of Hal talking to Nano.

2007
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:19,230
Oh yeah.

2008
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:19,470
Oh.

2009
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,710
That was what I was talking about yesterday about the Anarchist thing.

2010
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:25,530
Anarchist.

2011
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:30,410
Oh, I can't.

2012
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,270
Are you friends with Fun?

2013
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,150
Are you friends with Fun?

2014
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:37,230
Yeah, I said to him.

2015
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:48,590
Noba!

2016
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,130
Wait, Fun, do I just play Valk?

2017
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:58,810
And just Valk ult away?

2018
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:00,150
Maybe.

2019
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,130
Maybe you can get it.

2020
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:03,810
Well, you're Loba.

2021
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:05,590
I'm just gonna be able to get an infinite ulti kill.

2022
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:06,410
Oh, true, true.

2023
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:08,670
You're right.

2024
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:10,970
Oh my god, it's over.

2025
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,110
It's over for them.

2026
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,890
Now I just have to make sure I never press the Q button.

2027
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:16,970
I'm kidding.

2028
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:20,710
I mean, you just be like, it's an accident.

2029
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:25,030
Yeah, but they dequeued the people last game for getting a kill, so...

2030
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:27,550
Let's go.

2031
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,850
Oh, wait, we don't have a beacon character.

2032
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,550
Oh.

2033
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:32,430
Wait a minute.

2034
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,170
I think we fucked up a little.

2035
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:34,970
I'm in trouble.

2036
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,270
I didn't get on path.

2037
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:38,910
No, it's because you did damage.

2038
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:40,370
Yeah, I know.

2039
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:42,670
Damage seed.

2040
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:46,210
Alright, I mean, there's no way.

2041
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,530
Go for the support pill.

2042
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,670
Yeah, I punched him.

2043
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,030
I told them.

2044
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:54,590
I told them you punched him out of fear.

2045
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,190
He added all of us.

2046
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,370
Why are y'all doing damage?

2047
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,150
I thought you were in trouble.

2048
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:04,850
No, we're in trouble.

2049
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:05,830
What did we do?

2050
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:06,950
No, no.

2051
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:11,110
Teppo just added like 10 people and was like, why are you guys doing damage?

2052
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,070
I was scared.

2053
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,330
It was like fight or flight.

2054
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:16,790
It was my life.

2055
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:17,830
Yeah.

2056
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:24,370
I mean, if you were like getting ran at, you would have punched too.

2057
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:24,970
Give me that bat.

2058
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,490
Am I a support character?

2059
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:28,150
Yeah, you are.

2060
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:28,650
Oh, okay.

2061
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:31,530
So I'll be opening support bins.

2062
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:33,230
I got this, guys.

2063
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:34,510
I know what I'm doing.

2064
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,750
We need to go get the blue bins, Zoggy.

2065
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:38,930
Okay, I'm heading over.

2066
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:43,570
Now I know what I am.

2067
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:46,490
You collect ammo.

2068
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,670
Wait, someone fell out of bounds.

2069
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:49,390
What?

2070
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:49,790
Already?

2071
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:52,090
Yeah.

2072
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:54,650
Guard that bin.

2073
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,590
I think that one guy who keeps dying for us is just AFK.

2074
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,230
Oh.

2075
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,770
Why is he AFK?

2076
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:03,030
I guess like to fill up the slots.

2077
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,030
Guard that bin for me.

2078
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,950
I swear if some guy fucking comes in and goings that...

2079
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:13,750
That's our points.

2080
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:15,950
Yeah, those are our points right there.

2081
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,190
Okay.

2082
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,670
Are we just splitting up this time?

2083
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,410
Just collecting.

2084
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,110
Collecting.

2085
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:24,290
Alright.

2086
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,650
I'm going to go to Cascades to get more armor.

2087
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,130
How far is your ult?

2088
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:29,870
I'll probably come with you.

2089
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:30,690
I have ult now.

2090
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:32,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2091
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:36,570
I'll put it in Cascades and hope that no Seekers use the...

2092
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:41,270
Should I get the ultimate increase or...

2093
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,150
I feel like I'm always going to die.

2094
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,370
So I'll just give you guys my ult.

2095
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:49,730
Alright.

2096
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:55,390
So I'm going to go to Cascades.

2097
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:55,430
Let's see.

2098
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:00,230
I mean, would putting up fences considered a damaging ability?

2099
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,170
Yes.

2100
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:03,670
That does damage.

2101
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:04,530
That is how that works.

2102
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:07,550
No, but like just don't walk on it.

2103
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:12,650
Yeah, my bad.

2104
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,310
Just walk through it.

2105
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:14,850
No, you're right.

2106
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:15,190
Honestly.

2107
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,130
It's a damage by choice.

2108
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:21,050
So like if you just don't walk through it, you should be fine.

2109
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:22,570
Just don't take damage.

2110
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,970
Yeah.

2111
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:25,750
Honestly.

2112
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,390
Let's go north and grab the pill.

2113
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:30,270
Yeah, I'm going to grab that pill and then put down the ult.

2114
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:31,930
Am I about to die?

2115
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:32,730
Why?

2116
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:33,330
Friendly.

2117
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:34,550
They spawned Varameter.

2118
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:39,690
Me and this Wraith are both like shuffling back and forth like, Yeah, come in!

2119
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:41,730
I'm putting it here.

2120
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,490
I'm putting the ult here.

2121
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,530
You're welcome.

2122
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,610
Let's hope that no Seeker fucking runs in and clocks us.

2123
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:52,270
After this we should probably go...

2124
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,570
I'm probably going to go down to Cenote.

2125
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:55,170
I think they're going to leave that side of the map.

2126
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:56,550
There's only one ulti-exile here.

2127
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:57,590
Okay.

2128
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:01,850
We should hurry and take it before these leechers take it.

2129
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:04,270
Got it.

2130
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,330
I'm going to go on checkpoint.

2131
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:07,590
I'll see you guys.

2132
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,950
Oh, and Nevek.

2133
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:14,370
Guys, if I die in checkpoint, run the opposite side.

2134
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:16,890
Then you'll know.

2135
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,090
We got to keep our eyes open.

2136
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:19,650
I found friends.

2137
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,190
Wait.

2138
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:21,890
Fun.

2139
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:22,870
Oh, never mind.

2140
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:24,970
I was going to say, Vantage might be broken, but never mind.

2141
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,470
I was going to say, because you can see their armors.

2142
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:28,850
Yeah, but like...

2143
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:29,450
They know if they're a three-man.

2144
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:31,530
So if you see a three-man with armor, you know it's the Seekers.

2145
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:35,770
I mean, true, but then they're going to see your fucking skull.

2146
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,790
No, no, no.

2147
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,850
You can do the passive without going through the Seekers.

2148
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:39,570
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2149
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:40,330
You just look at them.

2150
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:40,810
Yeah.

2151
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:47,150
We have one person for information, and then we have Valk to get away.

2152
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:49,130
You know, I feel like...

2153
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:53,710
Wouldn't it be easier just to be Crypto, and then Crypto can just always have a drone out?

2154
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:55,350
Yeah, probably.

2155
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,830
Wait, we should do that for Broken Moon.

2156
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,650
Just have a Crypto put out the drone out.

2157
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:00,510
And then like...

2158
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,530
So the Seeker shoots the drone, then we'll know.

2159
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,810
I'll play Crypto, and I'll just EMP everyone.

2160
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:07,590
It's not damaging.

2161
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:07,790
Reptar.

2162
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:10,670
1000 damage.

2163
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:12,890
EMP online.

2164
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:13,890
No, wait, wait.

2165
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:16,370
If you do damage on the last round, it won't count.

2166
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,430
It doesn't matter, because it was...

2167
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,250
Oh, true.

2168
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,010
What are they gonna do?

2169
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:22,750
Kick me out of the tournament?

2170
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:24,830
Yeah, the tournament's over.

2171
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,060
Alright.

2172
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,260
Where is the...

2173
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,240
Alright, nice.

2174
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:35,760
We got purple.

2175
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,900
I got the evac too.

2176
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,440
Uh...

2177
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:45,520
Take an extra item, reduce his tactical cooldown.

2178
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,100
Yeah.

2179
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:47,260
Yeah.

2180
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,320
Alright.

2181
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,660
I'm gonna...

2182
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:53,320
Go...

2183
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,680
Wait, where's Fun?

2184
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,800
Oh, wait, Fun, you guys are following us?

2185
01:13:58,820 --> 01:13:59,240
Fun?

2186
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,120
I was collecting.

2187
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:02,980
Follow us?

2188
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:04,780
Yeah, we got purple.

2189
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,520
We should split now.

2190
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:06,940
I got a purple helmet.

2191
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,320
There's no need for us to be together.

2192
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,600
Yeah, we got...

2193
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:12,880
Am I dead?

2194
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:13,380
What was that?

2195
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:14,900
Friendly!

2196
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:15,320
Friendly!

2197
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,740
Is he friendly?

2198
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,540
Is he friendly?

2199
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,640
I think he's friendly.

2200
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:19,560
Friendly!

2201
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:19,900
Friendly!

2202
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,500
Okay, Doki, if you see an enemy in front, okay, run straight to me, okay?

2203
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,240
We're gonna valk ult away.

2204
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,620
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2205
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,060
But what if he shoots you?

2206
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,740
And the valk ult gets cancelled?

2207
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,140
Then GG.

2208
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:32,960
We're both dead.

2209
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:34,540
No, just valk, just leave me.

2210
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,960
If I get shot, just leave me and fly away.

2211
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,160
No, no, no, no, no.

2212
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,120
There's no way he's gonna shoot me.

2213
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,680
He'll just be like, I'm gonna shoot the person I've been...

2214
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:42,780
Wait, wait.

2215
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,920
No, no, no, that's the ring.

2216
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,900
Okay, I was gonna say, the dragon dropped the...

2217
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:47,900
You scared the shit out of me.

2218
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,120
He dropped the loot at Valk's and I was like, wait a minute.

2219
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,500
He said, wait, I can't see over the ridge.

2220
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,440
And I'm like, uh, do you see somebody or not?

2221
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,100
What's going on?

2222
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,580
I forgot the ring can make them drop the loot box.

2223
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:02,620
I forgot the ring can make them drop the loot box.

2224
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,520
I don't know, maybe we can get red.

2225
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,160
I don't know, maybe we can get red.

2226
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,600
There's a Pathfinder behind you guys.

2227
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:07,460
Oh.

2228
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,680
I think he friendly.

2229
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,340
Oh, I'm gonna keep running.

2230
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,360
He has a gun.

2231
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,180
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2232
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:14,900
He has a gun.

2233
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:15,320
Oh, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2234
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:15,900
Oh, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2235
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,160
Wait, I know there's like holes in the rocks.

2236
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:21,680
Dude.

2237
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,560
Do you know where the holes in the rocks are?

2238
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,960
There should be holes in the rocks.

2239
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:28,320
There should be holes in the rocks.

2240
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,500
Okay, okay.

2241
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,320
I don't know if both of us being together...

2242
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,200
We're also out of zone.

2243
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,620
Yeah, we're also out of zone.

2244
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,900
Alright, alright.

2245
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,200
We should split up guys.

2246
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:40,340
We should really split up.

2247
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,120
I'm gonna head this way.

2248
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,740
He's climbing stuff, we're good.

2249
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,140
Yeah, they're all friendly.

2250
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:46,560
Don't worry.

2251
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,300
There's like a friendly guy to my left too.

2252
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,180
Alright, I'm gonna go this way.

2253
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,240
NRG is expanding now guys.

2254
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,240
I'm following you.

2255
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,520
Wait, why are you following me?

2256
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,320
Oh, I thought he had a gun.

2257
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,280
He's just in the med kit.

2258
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,120
Oh my god.

2259
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,400
I thought it was fucking gone.

2260
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,520
All I'm saying is that there's no...

2261
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,200
He can't kill us all.

2262
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,640
Yeah, Ape Tron, come.

2263
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:08,620
Timmy can.

2264
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,600
He can't kill us all.

2265
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,620
Did you watch that other endgame?

2266
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,280
Oh, that's true.

2267
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,920
But there was like 30 people.

2268
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,480
And he was out of ammo.

2269
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,160
If he had a Havoc, I think all 30 of those people would have been dead.

2270
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,080
Didn't he have a Havoc?

2271
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,400
He was just out of ammo.

2272
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,120
If he had ammo, sorry.

2273
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:28,740
Let me specify.

2274
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,340
Wait, wait.

2275
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,240
Do you think they're running energy?

2276
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:33,880
Yes, of course.

2277
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:37,260
Okay, we should grab as many energy as we can and throw them off the cliff.

2278
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,280
Well, if they're smart, they're just gonna craft it.

2279
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,040
Oh...

2280
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,660
No, no, look at this.

2281
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,560
It's like an Easter egg hunt.

2282
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,560
Yeah, it's like a little Easter egg hunt.

2283
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,600
If you want more ammo, you gotta find all the ammo.

2284
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:52,020
All I'm saying is if all the hiders work together...

2285
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:52,700
The Keeper's over there.

2286
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,400
Wait, how do you know?

2287
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,160
I just heard the flatline go off.

2288
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:56,960
Oh, shit.

2289
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:57,420
Okay.

2290
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,480
Where is he?

2291
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,280
Yellow ping somewhere.

2292
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:00,820
I don't know.

2293
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:01,260
I heard it east.

2294
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,980
Okay, I'm leaving.

2295
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,000
All I'm saying is if all the hiders work together...

2296
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,800
There's someone inside!

2297
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,240
There's someone inside and they're running around.

2298
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:10,660
I'm scared.

2299
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,760
They're running around.

2300
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,120
Alright, everyone find your own building.

2301
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:16,720
Friendly!

2302
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,240
Friendly!

2303
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,420
We all have a building.

2304
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,200
They won't know.

2305
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,200
Are you friendly?

2306
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,780
Guys, leave us alone.

2307
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:25,820
We're scared.

2308
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,300
Hello?

2309
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:32,260
Hello?

2310
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,440
Anyone in the building?

2311
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,020
Friends only?

2312
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:39,180
I hear so many people walking around.

2313
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:41,400
I don't know, guys.

2314
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,500
If it's many people, we're good.

2315
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:44,420
Oh, that's true.

2316
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:44,820
That's true.

2317
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,900
If you hear one person running, that's when you should be scared.

2318
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,160
What if it's one person?

2319
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,920
Then it might be a fucking murderer.

2320
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:54,920
So much house.

2321
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,220
This is like the Three Little Pigs.

2322
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,540
My house is made out of brick.

2323
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:03,660
My house is made out of straw.

2324
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,480
My house is made out of straw.

2325
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,400
My house is made out of straw.

2326
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,740
We're both in the same type of house.

2327
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:07,300
This is bad.

2328
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,720
He's gonna huff and puff and blow our house down.

2329
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:15,620
Don't worry, guys.

2330
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:16,740
It's not.

2331
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:16,960
It's alright.

2332
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,520
I'm in a really good spot.

2333
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,080
Oh, I don't hear shots.

2334
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh, they killed Tempo.

2335
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,400
Reptar, you see where I'm at?

2336
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,480
Do you know where I'm at?

2337
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:27,980
Are you inside?

2338
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,320
Like, on top of the vent?

2339
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:30,640
No.

2340
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:31,900
Oh, where are you?

2341
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,660
I just heard a rev jump.

2342
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:33,560
Uh oh.

2343
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:37,520
I'm on the roof, but on the inside of it.

2344
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,520
Oh.

2345
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,500
If he gets murdered, Doki, run straight to me, okay?

2346
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:43,320
We're gonna vocal down.

2347
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,480
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2348
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,260
There's no way.

2349
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,760
You can't get murdered, right?

2350
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:48,960
Oh.

2351
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,420
It's him patting.

2352
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:53,880
Where are you?

2353
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,660
No, they got rid of the spot up there.

2354
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:55,960
No.

2355
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:56,920
It's Slidy.

2356
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,140
They heard the octane jump.

2357
01:18:59,200 --> 01:18:59,720
They're coming.

2358
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:04,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2359
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,600
What the fuck?

2360
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,420
You're dying to ring.

2361
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,920
How are you dying to ring?

2362
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:09,760
They're scared.

2363
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,960
Oh, cause they're getting chased into a ring by Peep.

2364
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,240
Oh shit.

2365
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,200
There's a Pathfinder on me and I hear him.

2366
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,240
Okay, well.

2367
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:19,380
It's okay.

2368
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,380
It can't be Peep or Luda, so it has to be Timmy.

2369
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,000
Yeah, Peep and Luda are both shooting.

2370
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:24,440
No, Timmy's shooting.

2371
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,020
Nobody's near us.

2372
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:25,440
Nobody's near us.

2373
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:25,640
We're good.

2374
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:25,900
We're good.

2375
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,180
We're good.

2376
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:26,260
We're good.

2377
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,040
We're also really far from zone, but we're good.

2378
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:29,360
We're good.

2379
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,800
Wait, this guy just hit beacon on me.

2380
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:34,380
I'm following him.

2381
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,020
All of them are hitting beacon.

2382
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,180
All of these guys are hitting beacon.

2383
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,360
They're all zipping too.

2384
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,120
Family.

2385
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:40,780
Family.

2386
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,240
Family.

2387
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:43,720
Family.

2388
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,360
Wait, there's so many Pathfinders here hitting the beacon.

2389
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,980
Come on, Pathfinders.

2390
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:49,220
Let's go.

2391
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,180
Come on, Pathfinders.

2392
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:51,180
Let's go.

2393
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:53,000
If you die, we all die.

2394
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:53,580
If you die, we all die.

2395
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,600
Let's fucking go.

2396
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:55,920
Pathfinder, strong together.

2397
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,380
Oh my god.

2398
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,580
Yes, yes we are.

2399
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:01,760
They're zipping for us.

2400
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,440
Guys, I don't know anymore.

2401
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,720
I'm fucking leaving you guys.

2402
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,100
Apes, strong.

2403
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,340
No, stay together.

2404
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,440
Apes, strong together.

2405
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,320
Apes, strong together.

2406
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,800
They'll shoot the Pathfinders, not the other characters.

2407
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,440
Why does he have a gun?

2408
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,600
This guy's got a .8 longbow.

2409
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,700
He's using it to scope people out, Fun.

2410
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:20,880
He's using it to scope people out, Fun.

2411
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:21,480
It's actually smart.

2412
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,180
I told you, Apes, strong together.

2413
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,000
I took a pad.

2414
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:29,680
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

2415
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,320
Now how do I get in a fucking tree?

2416
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,080
Fun, look at me.

2417
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,420
There's no way.

2418
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,100
Help!

2419
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,040
Is this a bad tree?

2420
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,220
I feel like this is a bad tree.

2421
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,260
Is this a bad... no.

2422
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,080
Am I onto something or no?

2423
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:42,940
Am I just fucking cooked?

2424
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,700
Wait, can I hide here?

2425
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,940
Oh god, Fun run!

2426
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:46,520
Fun run!

2427
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,560
See you later.

2428
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:50,780
There's no way.

2429
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:51,620
They won't look up here.

2430
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,080
They're not gonna look at me either.

2431
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,580
They're not gonna look at me either.

2432
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:57,040
There's no way.

2433
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,060
There's no way.

2434
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,240
They won't look up.

2435
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:00,580
Right?

2436
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,720
There's no way.

2437
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:01,780
There's no way.

2438
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,500
Oh, he's gonna look up to check the pack.

2439
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:06,860
I feel...

2440
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:07,800
I feel so safe.

2441
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,520
I don't.

2442
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,900
I feel pretty safe, I'm not gonna lie.

2443
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:15,180
I need a damn adult.

2444
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,960
Guys, what are they doing to me?

2445
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,620
I think I have an ingenious spot.

2446
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:22,600
Thoughts?

2447
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,580
Wait, does that guy have a gun?

2448
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:23,800
No.

2449
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:28,340
I think... I think I blend in.

2450
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:28,680
You see where I'm at?

2451
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:29,240
You see where I'm at?

2452
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:30,980
Yeah.

2453
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:31,780
You think this will work?

2454
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:32,560
Maybe.

2455
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,720
Oh, not over there.

2456
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,480
Oh, Timmy's next to me.

2457
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,520
Timmy's next to me.

2458
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:38,640
Oh, Timmy's next to me.

2459
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:38,640
Timmy's next to me.

2460
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,500
Oh, people's next to me too!

2461
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:41,860
It's okay, they won't look up.

2462
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:42,860
They will not look up.

2463
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:43,980
Guys!

2464
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,840
Guys, someone has to go on the other side.

2465
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,240
They're literally all on our side, guys!

2466
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,620
No, I'm not moving.

2467
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,220
It's called hide and seek, not run and seek.

2468
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:55,040
I think I'm good.

2469
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,420
My spot is so good.

2470
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,240
My spot is so good.

2471
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:57,760
Okay.

2472
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:58,000
Wait.

2473
01:21:59,160 --> 01:21:59,520
Okay.

2474
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,740
Okay, have you seen where we are?

2475
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:01,320
No.

2476
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:01,840
No!

2477
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,800
I'm still in!

2478
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,020
You're still in up there?

2479
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:05,900
I'm still in.

2480
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,280
Wait.

2481
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,440
I'm gonna redeploy.

2482
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,500
I'm gonna redeploy.

2483
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,220
I'm running south.

2484
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,600
I'm running straight south because they're pushing.

2485
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:12,820
Run!

2486
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,280
I'm gonna redeploy.

2487
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,400
There's no way.

2488
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:18,440
There's no fucking way.

2489
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:18,840
I'm gonna redeploy.

2490
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,120
Luda's on the southwest side of the zone.

2491
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,200
I'm going to the southeast.

2492
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:21,860
That guy's a Kraber.

2493
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,360
I'm fucking going with him.

2494
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,660
I'm gonna redeploy the last 30.

2495
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,020
No!

2496
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:26,800
Oh, yes!

2497
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,240
You have intel!

2498
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:29,580
I'm out.

2499
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:29,800
I'm out.

2500
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:29,960
I'm out.

2501
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,080
Oh my god.

2502
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:34,100
The last 30 seconds.

2503
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:34,660
I'm gonna redeploy.

2504
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,360
I'm gonna do it.

2505
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,740
I'm gonna fucking do it.

2506
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,120
I'm here.

2507
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:43,000
I don't know where to go.

2508
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:43,900
There's no way.

2509
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:44,580
There's no way.

2510
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,520
Oh, I'm so fucked.

2511
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,080
I'm so scared.

2512
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,120
Where are all the shots?

2513
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:55,060
I'm just sitting on the rocks.

2514
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,640
The rocks are... Highground is your friend, Fun.

2515
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,120
Highground is your friend.

2516
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,600
You can be evasive from highground.

2517
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:03,960
Okay.

2518
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:04,720
Okay.

2519
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,620
There's four Pathfinders up here, Fun.

2520
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,000
I'm gonna do it.

2521
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,020
I'm gonna do it.

2522
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,720
There's three Pathfinders up here, actually.

2523
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,100
Not four.

2524
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:12,900
Look at us.

2525
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:13,620
Come here, Fun.

2526
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:14,140
Join the pack.

2527
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,040
Family!

2528
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:15,980
Family!

2529
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,820
Come here, Doki.

2530
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,440
Join the pack.

2531
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:19,980
No!

2532
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,980
I'm leaving this family.

2533
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,160
What the fuck?

2534
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:24,880
Family.

2535
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,620
The numbers are going down.

2536
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:28,040
They're dwindling.

2537
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,560
The numbers are going down.

2538
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:30,860
They're dwindling.

2539
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:31,460
Oh.

2540
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,540
Stop moving!

2541
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:38,620
Get killed, us all.

2542
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:43,040
Um, I'm just saying one of them is definitely next to me.

2543
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,540
Pathfinder strong.

2544
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:46,380
Oh.

2545
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:47,480
Valkyrie strong.

2546
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,540
What, you need ulti-exels?

2547
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,500
Okay, let me get him after this.

2548
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,180
Ready, ready, ready.

2549
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:58,280
Guys.

2550
01:23:59,060 --> 01:23:59,440
Run.

2551
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,260
Run.

2552
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,020
Run.

2553
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:05,720
He's chasing me!

2554
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,660
I have one near me.

2555
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,380
Don't come near me!

2556
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,460
I have one near me!

2557
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,340
Don't come near me!

2558
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,000
I have both of them!

2559
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,460
Go back up, go back up, Fun.

2560
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:17,820
Go back up.

2561
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,380
I have to pad.

2562
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,700
Oh, you gave them ulti.

2563
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,200
Yeah, run.

2564
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,220
I killed them.

2565
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,660
Too scared to look.

2566
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,740
Too scared to look.

2567
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,400
Fun.

2568
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:33,420
No!

2569
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:36,880
Oh, god.

2570
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,520
I should've jumped behind the pill with that guy.

2571
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,560
I should've just jumped behind the pill.

2572
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:41,880
I should've gotten us both killed.

2573
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,840
Fun, you gotta live.

2574
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:45,660
You gotta live.

2575
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,620
It's just us two.

2576
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,060
You gotta live.

2577
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:50,600
Am I dead?

2578
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,620
No, you're not!

2579
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,440
You're not!

2580
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:53,940
It's Tibby on you.

2581
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,000
Tibby and Luda.

2582
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,200
Oh, god.

2583
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:00,500
Run, Florent!

2584
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:00,800
Oh, god!

2585
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,700
Oh, my god!

2586
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:05,440
Run!

2587
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:06,900
He's on controller.

2588
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:07,580
They're on controller.

2589
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,140
Uh-oh.

2590
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:11,700
Is he read a play?

2591
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,040
No, there's no read a play.

2592
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,400
Fun said he has two of them on him.

2593
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:14,920
No!

2594
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,060
Okay, okay.

2595
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,860
They're stealing each other's kills.

2596
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,220
They're not even looking for people.

2597
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,080
They're actually teaming up on you.

2598
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:24,960
They're trying to get second, even though second doesn't matter.

2599
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,400
Wait, this is a deep hole.

2600
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:28,960
What the fuck?

2601
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,740
What is this spot?

2602
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,220
I didn't even know this existed.

2603
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:33,180
You're fine.

2604
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:33,480
You're fine.

2605
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:33,920
Don't panic.

2606
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:34,260
Don't panic.

2607
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:35,720
He doesn't know.

2608
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:36,580
He doesn't know.

2609
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,220
He doesn't know.

2610
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,820
I don't know about this spot, so I know Luda does not know about this spot.

2611
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,360
Who told you this?

2612
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:44,780
What is this?

2613
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:45,560
I don't know!

2614
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:46,380
I just walked in!

2615
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:49,360
Yeah, go finish your Narc Turtle.

2616
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:49,980
That's Narc Turtle.

2617
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:50,480
Go finish her.

2618
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:50,980
The Horizon.

2619
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:51,800
That is?

2620
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:52,360
Oh, god.

2621
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:52,740
I think so.

2622
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:53,980
I'm like 99% sure.

2623
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:00,970
It was.

2624
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,390
It was.

2625
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:01,750
It was.

2626
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:02,990
It was Narc.

2627
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:03,730
Yes, it was.

2628
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,010
It was.

2629
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:05,130
It was.

2630
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,850
Okay, that was worth it.

2631
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:13,250
We died.

2632
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:13,790
That was worth it.

2633
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:16,630
That's why I'm the new IGL.

2634
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,350
He's probably so mad.

2635
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:24,010
He just got finished.

2636
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,590
He's like, what the fuck is this Loba?

2637
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,850
He's like, what the fuck is this Loba?

2638
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,450
Oh my god.

2639
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:34,230
Back up more.

2640
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,630
Back up.

2641
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,170
You're behind the Pathfinder.

2642
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,670
Why did you put a step?

2643
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:42,670
You fucking whore!

2644
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:47,550
It's okay.

2645
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:47,850
It's okay.

2646
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:48,450
You're top 10.

2647
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,050
It's okay.

2648
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:51,610
It's okay.

2649
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:54,470
You're top 10.

2650
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:55,710
We're fine.

2651
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:57,330
We're fine.

2652
01:26:58,370 --> 01:26:59,810
We didn't do damage.

2653
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:00,870
He was already dead.

2654
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:05,210
It's not damage if he's dead.

2655
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:12,770
Bro, we're so fucked.

2656
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:13,390
Bro, we're so fucked.

2657
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:17,890
I'm literally hiding behind somebody else's body.

2658
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:18,610
Get ready to queue.

2659
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:19,290
Get ready to queue.

2660
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:20,910
Oh, god.

2661
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:22,490
Wait, we the people?

2662
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:23,930
Wait, we the...

2663
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:24,430
What the fuck?

2664
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:28,210
Wait, stop, stop, stop.

2665
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:29,610
That's a Seeker.

2666
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:32,370
It's a Seeker.

2667
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:33,810
I was like, why me?

2668
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,490
There's literally a Pathfinder.

2669
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:39,230
You started punching him back.

2670
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,750
You're not real.

2671
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:46,930
I'm so confused.

2672
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:50,950
I'm like, what is he doing?

2673
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:54,210
There's no way you started punching him back.

2674
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,270
I'm like, what is he doing?

2675
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:57,790
I'm not dying.

2676
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,750
I'm just fucking around.

2677
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,630
No, there's no way I did damage.

2678
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:05,510
There's no way I did.

2679
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:06,490
Holy fuck.

2680
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:10,390
I thought...

2681
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:12,570
I thought he was hiding.

2682
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:13,030
It's okay.

2683
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,010
It was worth it.

2684
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:15,510
Yeah, it was self defense.

2685
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:16,550
It was self defense.

2686
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:16,890
I thought he was hiding.

2687
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:17,570
It was self defense.

2688
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:19,150
I don't think that's how that works in this tournament.

2689
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:24,510
It was self defense.

2690
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:24,510
I don't think that's how that works in this tournament.

2691
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:24,930
Oh my god.

2692
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:25,490
I need water.

2693
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:25,870
Holy fuck.

2694
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,270
I think this Octane wins.

2695
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:30,410
Wait, no, there's someone behind him.

2696
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:32,170
Wait, there is?

2697
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,690
Yeah, he's healing behind him.

2698
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:36,770
No, there's only two Seekers left.

2699
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:37,450
One died in zone.

2700
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:40,370
Peeps died in zone.

2701
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:41,970
Again?

2702
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,450
Yeah, you guys didn't see it?

2703
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:43,970
I saw it.

2704
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,390
No, he got res.

2705
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:48,710
He should have kept him dead.

2706
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:49,770
Because he got a kill after.

2707
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:53,970
There's nothing he can do to keep taking zone damage.

2708
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:54,250
There's nothing he can do to keep taking zone damage.

2709
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:55,170
He's like one dick at a time.

2710
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:56,650
They have no ammo.

2711
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:57,930
They're just beating his ass.

2712
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:02,170
Bro, no Octane.

2713
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:02,590
Wait, you got second.

2714
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:04,090
Oh!

2715
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:07,930
That's funny.

2716
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:09,310
That's funny.

2717
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:16,110
Has anyone had the reaction to our XIGL's That's a finisher.

2718
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:24,450
Pass the clip along.

2719
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:25,730
Pass the clip.

2720
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:29,750
Yeah, pass the clip.

2721
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:37,410
He said, please tell me that's not who I think it is.

2722
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:38,630
Oh god, he knew immediately.

2723
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,370
Button, pass the clip.

2724
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:47,930
Button, pass the clip.

2725
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:48,610
I sent it to you.

2726
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:52,650
It's too good.

2727
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:53,590
I was watching it.

2728
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:57,170
Okay, guys.

2729
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,210
Here's the clip, guys.

2730
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:12,690
That was so funny.

2731
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:14,310
He's like, buddy.

2732
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:22,370
He's like, buddy.

2733
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:24,350
What do I mean I'm getting finisher'd right now?

2734
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:28,950
I like how the POV is to somebody else.

2735
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:31,790
So he's not even sharing with me.

2736
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:32,190
Yeah.

2737
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:36,490
Holy shit.

2738
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:41,180
Nice.

2739
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,420
Okay, what are we doing now?

2740
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:44,240
What comp?

2741
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:46,600
I don't know.

2742
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,360
I'm gonna play Altar on Broken Moon.

2743
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,060
I'm gonna play Pound.

2744
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:53,340
It's time to run.

2745
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,200
I'll play whatever.

2746
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:55,900
And grapple under a bridge.

2747
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:58,900
We'll be hiding under the bridge.

2748
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,920
Alright, alright.

2749
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,060
Are we...

2750
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:04,980
Are we doing the same thing?

2751
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,520
Five teams tied for first?

2752
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,000
Oh my god, that means they have to donate to five different charities.

2753
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:13,020
Them's the rules.

2754
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:16,660
True.

2755
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:17,420
That's the rules.

2756
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,260
Those are rules.

2757
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,200
Charity rules.

2758
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,980
If they don't do it, they hate charity.

2759
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,600
It's true.

2760
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,160
It's true.

2761
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:31,340
It's actually facts.

2762
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,540
I didn't think about it that way.

2763
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:36,240
How could you hate charity?

2764
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:37,700
I'm an asshole.

2765
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,740
Tempo, you can't just hate charity like that.

2766
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:42,160
You gotta donate to five different charities.

2767
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,020
I wonder if Wig was reacting to it.

2768
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,280
I wish Wig was watching our stream.

2769
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:02,950
Alright.

2770
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:07,950
Let's see.

2771
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:10,190
Should we still have ring characters?

2772
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:11,390
Oh wait, no, you're on crypto.

2773
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:12,490
Reptar, aren't you on crypto?

2774
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:15,210
What were you gonna play before?

2775
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:16,510
I was gonna play Alter.

2776
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:17,950
Wait, I can do crypto.

2777
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:20,670
You can play crypto, go for it.

2778
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:21,490
Yeah, I'll do crypto.

2779
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,770
You can hide in a little hole and just get on your Gameboy and play around.

2780
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,290
Yeah, I'm bringing season four back.

2781
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,430
All this solo crypto.

2782
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:33,050
Just fucking scanning people for army.

2783
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:34,750
And kill points.

2784
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:35,030
Yeah.

2785
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,830
You can just start driving your drone at rat.

2786
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:43,290
Oh, you're right!

2787
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:44,610
I can drive my drone?

2788
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:46,410
Wait, I kind of want to play crypto.

2789
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:51,590
You can rat other people out.

2790
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:53,490
I'm gonna rat other people out 100%.

2791
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:53,990
Alright, yeah.

2792
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,190
You do crypto.

2793
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:56,510
I hate crypto.

2794
01:32:58,610 --> 01:32:59,010
It's so weird.

2795
01:32:59,450 --> 01:32:59,850
It's so hard to play.

2796
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:01,390
There's so many buildings this map.

2797
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:02,390
There's no way they find me.

2798
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,580
This is where we get top 3.

2799
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,420
I need to go watch peepsvod.

2800
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,600
How did he die twice to zone?

2801
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:20,560
I need to hear his reaction.

2802
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:21,420
Oh that's true.

2803
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:25,400
How did he die twice to zone?

2804
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:34,640
There's no vod man.

2805
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,640
Peeps is embarrassed.

2806
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,240
He deleted a vod right after his first death.

2807
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,620
Do you have the extension?

2808
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,500
Oh yeah the twitch rewind.

2809
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:47,300
If you have it, it says view and download stream without ads.

2810
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,360
Watch the current vod.

2811
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:56,640
How did this man die?

2812
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,600
Is this the last game?

2813
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:02,700
Yeah.

2814
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:05,060
I died to oob like 3 times in one scrim block.

2815
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:14,730
Wait he's just stuck in this room.

2816
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:17,590
Wait peeps?

2817
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:19,950
Yeah he got stuck in...

2818
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:23,650
Wait how did he get stuck?

2819
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:27,630
He killed people in a building in zone 6 and he had no meds.

2820
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:29,510
He just got stuck in the corner of the room.

2821
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:34,510
I thought like he got stuck as in there were so many bodies just blocking.

2822
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:39,390
Maybe we all... so we all jump out the ship and we all jump out the ship.

2823
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:41,850
We should do that.

2824
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:42,190
Yeah.

2825
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:46,610
We gotta do that.

2826
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:48,870
I can hit ring consoles when I get blue.

2827
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:53,170
I can... wait am I doing loba?

2828
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:54,210
What should I do?

2829
01:34:55,990 --> 01:35:00,550
Wait I'll do... I'll do... yeah I'll do loba.

2830
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:04,170
I was just thinking maybe like...

2831
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:04,730
Bangalore?

2832
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:06,290
Cause no one's playing assault characters.

2833
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:07,750
Oh you're right.

2834
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:09,370
What if I bang all of them?

2835
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,010
I think I'm gonna be assaulted accidentally.

2836
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:13,370
What do you mean by... depends on what you mean by accidentally.

2837
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:13,850
For the last zone.

2838
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:20,510
What if I had a calculated ALGS bangalore?

2839
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:21,910
Yeah what if...

2840
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:23,470
For ring 6.

2841
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:25,070
For ring 6.

2842
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:27,070
And I'd be like oops.

2843
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:28,250
It's like...

2844
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:33,830
Wait bro how... how peep died in the first game is even funnier.

2845
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:37,150
He's just running around stimming you on the gas edge.

2846
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:37,990
It just barely ticks.

2847
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:40,950
It just just shoulder in the zone and dies.

2848
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:42,250
What you didn't click crypto.

2849
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:45,250
You forgot crypto.

2850
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:48,330
Oh wait you're right.

2851
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,490
It's okay I'll...

2852
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:50,470
Thank you.

2853
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:51,530
It's on me.

2854
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:51,750
Thank you.

2855
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:53,690
I was afk I was watching the clip.

2856
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:56,290
You can start griefing people now.

2857
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:58,630
It's my turn to grief people.

2858
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:01,330
Okay now instead of...

2859
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:03,410
This is up accidentally bang halting.

2860
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,110
Let me accidentally...

2861
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:05,250
Wait there's so many beacons.

2862
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:06,230
There's so many beacons.

2863
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:08,070
Can you land here Doki?

2864
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:08,830
Which way?

2865
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:10,050
And hit all three of the beacons?

2866
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:10,590
Oh yeah.

2867
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:11,310
Hell yeah.

2868
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:13,610
I'm gonna go experimental labs.

2869
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:17,630
Wait can I do both...

2870
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:18,290
Um...

2871
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:18,530
Yeah.

2872
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:18,670
Ring?

2873
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:20,390
No no no no.

2874
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:22,870
You can get in your drone and hit all of the man scan ones.

2875
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:23,870
Oh okay.

2876
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:26,750
From 200 meters.

2877
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:30,030
So if you ping the... the thing and you're 200 meters out you can do that.

2878
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:30,570
Alright.

2879
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:33,710
Alright let's see.

2880
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:34,150
Oh 100.

2881
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:35,050
Alright here we go.

2882
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:37,390
It's time to play on my stream deck.

2883
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:39,630
How do I do this?

2884
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,390
Okay I have...

2885
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:42,010
You have to hold the button down to get into the drone.

2886
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:43,010
Time to put...

2887
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:44,810
Get into my steam deck right now.

2888
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:46,530
Oh there we go.

2889
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:47,490
Alright let's see.

2890
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,610
Let's see where's the first one.

2891
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:55,010
Wait there's so many.

2892
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:56,230
Why are there two here?

2893
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:01,460
Okay.

2894
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:04,800
No it's too far.

2895
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,120
Wait no.

2896
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,180
Did I not make it?

2897
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:08,820
No fuck.

2898
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:09,740
You can just run forward.

2899
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,340
Yeah.

2900
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:12,920
Leave you a drone.

2901
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:14,700
Yeah.

2902
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,040
Just don't worry.

2903
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,940
My wifi is on five bars.

2904
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:22,040
Is that that good connection?

2905
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:23,320
I think so.

2906
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,440
I hope so.

2907
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,720
I ran out of crypto wifi.

2908
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:33,620
You see if you get the Nokia modem you'll never run out of wifi.

2909
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:34,780
I hope so.

2910
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,140
I feel like I'm on the same level as the last person here.

2911
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:39,520
Oh.

2912
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,260
Wait can I grab armor with the drone?

2913
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,140
Bun, do you see...

2914
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:43,240
No.

2915
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:43,780
...anyone in the man scan?

2916
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:44,940
Nooo.

2917
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:45,720
No.

2918
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,060
Why is it bugged?

2919
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:48,740
I don't...

2920
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,680
I've never seen that before.

2921
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:51,840
I don't know.

2922
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,620
I should be able to grab a...

2923
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,840
Oh, no, he punched it.

2924
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:05,860
Because my drone was right next to the Evo.

2925
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,940
So I was like, how the fuck did he destroy it?

2926
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,900
Increase neural link and EMP range.

2927
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,200
Wait, what's neural link?

2928
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,120
Take the other one.

2929
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:15,540
Take the other one.

2930
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:16,460
Okay.

2931
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,580
Because that one is like...

2932
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:23,320
The neural link is like when it shows how many teams are in the area, I think.

2933
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:23,640
Oh.

2934
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:25,900
I don't actually know.

2935
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,600
Well, isn't that good for the... for high...

2936
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,520
Yeah, but flying drone is faster is better, so they can't break that shit.

2937
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:32,200
Oh, okay.

2938
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,540
Because you're never EMP'ing anyways.

2939
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,000
That's why that first one is good.

2940
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,400
But shouldn't we... when we want them...

2941
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,380
I'm in God spot.

2942
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:44,120
When we want them to shoot it, so we know where they are.

2943
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,460
Oh, but you want to be able to fly around them longer?

2944
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:49,220
So they have to shoot it and like be a little flyer on their head, you know?

2945
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,440
Yeah, and they waste their ammo.

2946
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:51,300
Oh, you're so smart.

2947
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:52,140
They waste all their ammo.

2948
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,540
That's why you're ranked.

2949
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:53,620
Oh, you're so smart.

2950
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,080
You're ranked one, Fred.

2951
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:54,660
Yup.

2952
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,440
Yup.

2953
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:58,800
You're so smart.

2954
01:38:59,060 --> 01:38:59,400
All right.

2955
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:00,280
Let's see.

2956
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,160
How far is this?

2957
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:03,220
Okay, 280.

2958
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,040
I have to get closer.

2959
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:06,780
Getting on my Steam Deck.

2960
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:10,840
Okay.

2961
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,440
The most proud we are.

2962
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,340
The harder it is to have each other's back.

2963
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,980
What are you doing there, Fun?

2964
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:18,900
I'm gonna go to the beginning.

2965
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:20,220
Collecting.

2966
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:21,460
Oops.

2967
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:23,040
More collecting.

2968
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:26,800
Don't worry.

2969
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:29,420
I'm heading.

2970
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,900
I'm flying in.

2971
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:37,860
Flying in.

2972
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:42,420
I hope a seeker doesn't randomly shoot me because I'm just in the middle of nowhere.

2973
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,500
This Pathfinder just stole my brick.

2974
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:45,120
I'm so sad.

2975
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:46,460
Kill him.

2976
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,820
Where are these people anyway?

2977
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:52,880
Let's see.

2978
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,020
There's another scan here.

2979
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,580
I fucking see.

2980
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:00,200
Come on.

2981
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,700
I was like, who the fuck is this guy?

2982
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:05,600
Drone scan persists for 1.5 seconds.

2983
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,440
We should want that.

2984
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:07,660
Yeah.

2985
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,420
Both are fun.

2986
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:11,900
All right.

2987
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,880
Going for the labs.

2988
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,020
Who's that behind me?

2989
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:19,600
I need a helmet.

2990
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,860
I don't like the sounds behind me.

2991
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,520
Is the Pathfinder having a hard time?

2992
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:27,640
I'm going to start going.

2993
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,020
Seekers are usually just sitting around the edge, I feel like.

2994
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:30,740
Yeah.

2995
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:32,060
I mean, that makes sense.

2996
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,220
Do they know zone or no?

2997
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:35,380
I mean, no.

2998
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:36,180
They don't have zone character.

2999
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:36,840
Okay.

3000
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:38,680
I should go.

3001
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,680
Whoever Pathfinder is.

3002
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:42,420
Wait, they already rezzed?

3003
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,180
They're probably doing it for Evo.

3004
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,020
I was going to say, like, what?

3005
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:49,520
Is this Nock?

3006
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:51,860
It looks like his fucking Pathskin.

3007
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,040
I'm going to scan.

3008
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:54,400
Have fun.

3009
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:55,180
We can sit up here.

3010
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:58,460
You know about the squat?

3011
01:40:58,940 --> 01:40:59,500
All right.

3012
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,120
How many squat?

3013
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,080
Wait, Linkster fell.

3014
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,280
Was he trying to set up another fucking capture?

3015
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,320
Was it him who did it the first time?

3016
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:09,940
He has voice lines off.

3017
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:10,300
Fuck.

3018
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:12,460
Fun.

3019
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:12,940
You like my squat?

3020
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,520
I've revered the enemy's positions.

3021
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,120
Ooh.

3022
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:23,050
Oh, I have flight mode?

3023
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:24,670
What is flight mode?

3024
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:28,130
Oh.

3025
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:28,770
Uh, I'm sure.

3026
01:41:29,310 --> 01:41:31,130
What the fuck is this Pathfinder doing?

3027
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:32,670
Huh.

3028
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:36,450
There's a Pathfinder right...

3029
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:39,630
If I put a drone right on top of this Pathfinder...

3030
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:44,370
You can't do anything about it.

3031
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:46,690
You can't do anything about it.

3032
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:50,350
Guys, look up here!

3033
01:41:54,690 --> 01:41:56,110
I don't know if I can see you.

3034
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:56,850
Wait, is that Nock?

3035
01:41:58,130 --> 01:41:58,430
That is Nock.

3036
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:00,390
He's over here.

3037
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:01,890
Oh, wait, wait.

3038
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,450
Oh, he kicked my drone!

3039
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:05,750
He kicked it!

3040
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:08,490
No, that sucked up!

3041
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:10,770
This guy destroyed my drone.

3042
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:12,710
Just go follow Nock around.

3043
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:13,630
Which one?

3044
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:14,930
He's on the left wall.

3045
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:17,290
He's right there.

3046
01:42:18,810 --> 01:42:20,730
I'm gonna throw my drone out.

3047
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:23,190
Just hope I don't die from this.

3048
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:26,010
I'll let you know if anybody's running at your building.

3049
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:26,610
.

3050
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:28,970
Okay.

3051
01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:29,630
I'm waiting.

3052
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:30,030
I'm waiting.

3053
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:30,950
Almost repaired.

3054
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:34,330
Bro, one of them fucking punched my drone!

3055
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:36,590
Wait, should we stream time?

3056
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,430
Nock, go get a live reaction.

3057
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:39,430
Alright, let's see.

3058
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:42,670
Wait, you're taking damage?

3059
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:45,230
That's fucked up.

3060
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:48,450
That's fucked up.

3061
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:51,790
Is he punching you?

3062
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:54,490
Is that him?

3063
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:56,510
Yeah.

3064
01:42:58,230 --> 01:42:59,690
No, there's this guy.

3065
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:00,870
There's this guy right here.

3066
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:02,090
This guy.

3067
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:02,930
I'm gonna scan him.

3068
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:03,370
This guy.

3069
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:03,850
Do you see him?

3070
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:04,870
I'm gonna...

3071
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:08,070
Why do I just ult this man?

3072
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:11,470
That's fucked up.

3073
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:13,030
Wait, am I...

3074
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:13,610
No, I'm not in zone.

3075
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:14,030
Okay.

3076
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:15,410
Hey, guys.

3077
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:16,590
Look at him.

3078
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:17,330
Right here.

3079
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:19,450
No, a zone ends here.

3080
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:21,910
Oh my god!

3081
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:24,130
Bro, he got it!

3082
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:28,310
What the fuck?

3083
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:30,930
What the fuck?

3084
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:32,990
I just watched him do that on his stream.

3085
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:34,190
What the fuck?

3086
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:36,350
I don't have enough beds for this!

3087
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:37,610
Do you have beds?

3088
01:43:37,890 --> 01:43:39,050
I only have two shields.

3089
01:43:39,470 --> 01:43:41,850
Oh my god.

3090
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:43,470
Bro, kick this guy out!

3091
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,890
Kick him out and never invite him to a tournament again.

3092
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:49,630
Broled.

3093
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:50,410
I'm gonna EMP.

3094
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:51,530
I'm gonna fucking EMP.

3095
01:43:51,610 --> 01:43:52,110
Where is he?

3096
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:52,890
Broled.

3097
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:58,410
I have EMP.

3098
01:43:58,570 --> 01:43:59,630
Where the fuck is he?

3099
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:00,310
Wait.

3100
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:03,130
Where is he?

3101
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:04,290
Where's that Pathfinder?

3102
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:06,530
He's above the rail.

3103
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:08,730
The rail?

3104
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:09,670
He's right here, against this wall.

3105
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:10,570
This wall?

3106
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:12,170
This one?

3107
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:15,230
Behind the building.

3108
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:15,910
Is that him?

3109
01:44:16,110 --> 01:44:16,810
Pathfinder on the wall.

3110
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:18,130
Yes, that's him.

3111
01:44:20,810 --> 01:44:21,170
Wait.

3112
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,930
What the fuck?

3113
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:26,050
I can't help you.

3114
01:44:27,690 --> 01:44:28,430
Bro.

3115
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:29,650
Bro.

3116
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:30,570
Bro.

3117
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:33,270
There's also this Pathfinder right here.

3118
01:44:34,030 --> 01:44:35,230
Let me just shoot a zip at it.

3119
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:41,070
He's creeping so hard.

3120
01:44:41,130 --> 01:44:42,470
He's actually so mad.

3121
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:45,030
I'm at the sky.

3122
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:47,490
I got to the fucking left.

3123
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:49,310
Holy shit.

3124
01:44:49,890 --> 01:44:52,120
Bro, he destroyed my fucking...

3125
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:53,690
...trip.

3126
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:56,210
He keeps shooting my drone.

3127
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:57,150
Drone.

3128
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:00,530
I got to shoot a zip at that.

3129
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:00,910
I got to shoot a zip at that.

3130
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:06,290
Wait, we need to make a web.

3131
01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:07,870
Make a web, Pathfinder.

3132
01:45:07,990 --> 01:45:10,550
I have another drone coming in.

3133
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:11,250
Don't worry.

3134
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:12,970
You should have taken the other perk.

3135
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:14,710
No, you would have had your drone twice as fast.

3136
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:16,270
No, I should have.

3137
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:18,050
I didn't expect this to get broken as much.

3138
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:18,150
I'm so much.

3139
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:22,670
Why is everybody shooting my drone?

3140
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:24,550
Can we just get ulti cells and keep EMP'ing Nock?

3141
01:45:24,690 --> 01:45:26,330
Yeah, let's just keep EMP'ing.

3142
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:27,370
I have one.

3143
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:28,530
What are you gonna do?

3144
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:29,430
Kick us out of the tournament?

3145
01:45:29,550 --> 01:45:29,910
It's over.

3146
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,510
This is the last game.

3147
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:34,370
Honestly, this is more content.

3148
01:45:35,710 --> 01:45:36,930
It's not an early game anyways.

3149
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:40,870
Here, get out of your drone.

3150
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:41,310
I got a present.

3151
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:42,070
Okay, nice.

3152
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:45,090
Ooh, nice.

3153
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:46,090
Okay.

3154
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:47,530
Wait, there's a bunch of fucking loot here.

3155
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:47,930
I'm taking it all.

3156
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:48,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3157
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:48,910
Get all that loot.

3158
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:49,530
Get all that loot.

3159
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:53,110
I just shot a zip at him.

3160
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:54,630
Okay.

3161
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:55,370
I'm almost close.

3162
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:56,590
I'm almost close to another ult.

3163
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:59,370
This Lothlis is stealing all the ammo.

3164
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:05,290
Where is all the other...

3165
01:46:06,130 --> 01:46:08,130
Chat, I need a god rat spot.

3166
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:10,530
Oh!

3167
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:11,710
That's a wingman!

3168
01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:13,290
What the fuck?

3169
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:15,070
This guy's a wingman!

3170
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:17,230
Wait, I can EMP.

3171
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:25,090
Oh, wait, what's that?

3172
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:25,910
I know!

3173
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:29,670
Wait, I haven't chopped in the corner.

3174
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:30,510
I haven't chopped in the corner.

3175
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:30,850
No!

3176
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:32,050
He destroyed it!

3177
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:33,390
He destroyed it!

3178
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,530
Come up here, chop him in the corner.

3179
01:46:35,410 --> 01:46:36,410
Wait, no, I got a spot.

3180
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:39,450
Okay.

3181
01:46:40,290 --> 01:46:40,970
No, a mantle!

3182
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:43,170
No, a mantle.

3183
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:45,430
Mantle.

3184
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,350
Guys, we're in zone.

3185
01:46:46,410 --> 01:46:46,850
We're safe.

3186
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:47,590
We're so safe.

3187
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:49,130
There's no way.

3188
01:46:51,050 --> 01:46:52,330
There's no fucking way.

3189
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:54,550
There's no fucking way.

3190
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:56,070
I have EMP.

3191
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:57,270
I have EMP whenever.

3192
01:46:58,210 --> 01:46:58,930
I'm ready.

3193
01:46:58,990 --> 01:46:59,590
Oh my god!

3194
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:00,810
Wait, what's the next ring?

3195
01:47:00,910 --> 01:47:01,510
Let me out!

3196
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:03,590
Okay.

3197
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:10,330
Steam deck, let's go.

3198
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:11,290
Don't EMP anybody but Nock.

3199
01:47:11,690 --> 01:47:12,210
Alright.

3200
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:13,110
Where's...

3201
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:15,930
Where is everybody though?

3202
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:19,110
I'm going back up on my spot.

3203
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:20,250
I'm gonna stay here.

3204
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:24,870
I'm gonna find rat out people if I can.

3205
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:27,050
Is there any rats?

3206
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:29,890
There's just like nine people in your spot, right?

3207
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:31,410
And Jimmy's over there.

3208
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:32,650
They're all on me?

3209
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:34,250
Alright, I'm getting them all killed.

3210
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:37,350
Leave me alone.

3211
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:39,350
I'm handling my fucking...

3212
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:41,010
My drone right now.

3213
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:43,210
Wait, there's actually like six people up here.

3214
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:47,470
There's two people in this spot.

3215
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:50,030
Oh my god.

3216
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:51,150
Are there any rats here?

3217
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:52,450
Where can I go?

3218
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:54,450
Don't worry, Seekers!

3219
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:55,830
I'll help you find out the rats!

3220
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:57,270
Come scan my spot, Doki.

3221
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:58,430
How many people are up here actually?

3222
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:01,410
Just a few.

3223
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:05,930
Wait, I'm gonna bring a Seeker.

3224
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:07,390
I'm gonna bring a Seeker over there.

3225
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:11,590
Okay, no that's... I'm gonna bring a Seeker.

3226
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:13,090
Wait, I think that...

3227
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:14,910
This is one right here, I think.

3228
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:17,470
Come over here.

3229
01:48:17,530 --> 01:48:17,850
Come over here.

3230
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:21,170
He's running rampart for a minigun.

3231
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:21,770
Oh my god.

3232
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:24,350
Come over here.

3233
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:25,830
Come over here.

3234
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:27,190
Bro!

3235
01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:32,570
I can take it one more time!

3236
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:33,670
Just start driving at people.

3237
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:37,850
Yeah, come over here.

3238
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:38,590
Yes!

3239
01:48:40,490 --> 01:48:41,190
Look up!

3240
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:42,030
Look up!

3241
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:45,430
Over here.

3242
01:48:45,790 --> 01:48:46,350
Over here.

3243
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:46,710
Over here.

3244
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:48,690
Come on!

3245
01:48:48,710 --> 01:48:49,290
Come on!

3246
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:50,210
Rampart over here!

3247
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:50,970
Right over here!

3248
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:52,430
Right over...

3249
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:55,210
She's up front.

3250
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:55,630
She's up front.

3251
01:48:57,550 --> 01:48:58,230
Oh yeah, here.

3252
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:00,450
I'll follow him.

3253
01:49:00,510 --> 01:49:00,870
Don't worry.

3254
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:01,330
Don't worry.

3255
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:01,790
I got you!

3256
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:05,150
Don't worry.

3257
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:06,450
Don't worry.

3258
01:49:06,590 --> 01:49:06,650
Don't worry.

3259
01:49:06,650 --> 01:49:07,210
I got you!

3260
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:08,830
He's right here on the roof!

3261
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:09,770
Come on!

3262
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:10,670
Rampart, no!

3263
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:11,410
No!

3264
01:49:11,690 --> 01:49:12,430
I can't!

3265
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:13,510
I have a big spot!

3266
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:14,710
What an asshole.

3267
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:17,330
It was the perfect spot!

3268
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:20,330
Alright, Donkey, you're gonna get your building cleared in a second.

3269
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:20,870
Just so you know.

3270
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:24,510
If he clears my building, I'm gonna ult.

3271
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:27,210
You don't have drone.

3272
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:28,010
How are you gonna ult?

3273
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:30,530
By sheer will.

3274
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:34,110
He's running into your building right now.

3275
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:35,870
I'm giving you light pigs.

3276
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:36,390
Light pigs.

3277
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:36,930
He's inside.

3278
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:37,910
He's inside.

3279
01:49:38,690 --> 01:49:39,530
Don't look through.

3280
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:39,770
No!

3281
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:42,630
I gave you a warning.

3282
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:43,890
I couldn't run anywhere!

3283
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:44,350
I couldn't stop there.

3284
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:44,590
I couldn't run anywhere!

3285
01:49:44,710 --> 01:49:45,530
Why would I run?

3286
01:49:46,190 --> 01:49:48,370
I gave you a 30 second warning.

3287
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:52,590
And you decided to sit there and say, If he clears my building, I'll EMP him.

3288
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:55,810
I was so close to my EMP though.

3289
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:57,270
You don't understand.

3290
01:49:58,370 --> 01:49:59,730
It was so close.

3291
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:00,450
Go on, get banner.

3292
01:50:00,530 --> 01:50:00,850
I'll rez.

3293
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:01,970
Oh yeah, get the banner.

3294
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:02,390
I'll rez.

3295
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:04,150
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

3296
01:50:05,090 --> 01:50:06,730
I'm just trying to stay alive right now, man.

3297
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:08,390
There's a lot of people.

3298
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:10,010
They got weapons and shit.

3299
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:12,850
But all I'm saying will be really funny.

3300
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:13,650
If you get my banner.

3301
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:15,070
Where do we rez you?

3302
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:18,210
I got it.

3303
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:18,490
Don't worry.

3304
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:20,570
Wait, you have a mobile rez?

3305
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:21,590
I'm scared.

3306
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:23,110
No, wait!

3307
01:50:23,190 --> 01:50:24,110
How are you gonna rez me?

3308
01:50:25,490 --> 01:50:26,350
There's a mobi over here.

3309
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:28,070
Oh, they're using it!

3310
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:29,190
No!

3311
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:30,890
No!

3312
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:32,670
Quick!

3313
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:34,530
There has to be a mobi somewhere!

3314
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:38,250
Someone has to have a mobi!

3315
01:50:39,170 --> 01:50:39,610
Someone has to have a mobi!

3316
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:39,910
Nobody lose!

3317
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:40,550
What do you mean?

3318
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:41,490
Somebody has to have a mobi!

3319
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:43,130
Somebody has to have a mobi!

3320
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:51,500
Oh my god.

3321
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:53,540
Oh, Britha.

3322
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,860
You're fucking ballsy for that.

3323
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:57,960
What do you mean?

3324
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:01,420
But I got you with UAV, bro.

3325
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:02,660
Thank you, sir.

3326
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:04,080
Thank you, sir.

3327
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,140
Oh my god.

3328
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:08,800
Bro, you're fucking next, man.

3329
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:10,120
Oh my god.

3330
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:10,120
Bro, you're fucking next, man.

3331
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:10,120
Whoa!

3332
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,760
Wait, unless...

3333
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:13,700
Unless...

3334
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,180
They already cleared this spot.

3335
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:16,580
Yeah, that's true.

3336
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:16,960
That's true.

3337
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:18,380
Gamers don't look up.

3338
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:21,120
Oh, that was...

3339
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:21,320
Let me in.

3340
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:21,640
Let me in.

3341
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,260
Please, please, please, let me in.

3342
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:26,660
Friendly!

3343
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:27,000
Friendly!

3344
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:27,900
Please, please, no!

3345
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:29,340
Let me in.

3346
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:31,640
Break the door.

3347
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:32,800
Break the door.

3348
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,200
You know you want to.

3349
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:34,880
Break the door.

3350
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:35,500
Come on.

3351
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:37,040
Break the door.

3352
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:42,300
Your building was stolen.

3353
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:43,880
If you didn't clear that room, you were still good.

3354
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,320
Oh my god.

3355
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:50,680
What is this violence?

3356
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:51,480
Oh my god.

3357
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:51,480
What is this violence?

3358
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:51,480
Bro!

3359
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:54,780
Where's the other Pathfinder?

3360
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:57,780
It's okay, Fun.

3361
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:58,620
I've got the boys.

3362
01:51:58,840 --> 01:51:59,360
It's okay.

3363
01:51:59,440 --> 01:51:59,780
It's okay.

3364
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:00,680
We've got the team.

3365
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:01,180
We've got the fellows.

3366
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:01,560
We've got the team.

3367
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:01,560
We've got the fellows.

3368
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,080
There's our Moby.

3369
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:05,000
You know you want to.

3370
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:07,960
No, don't.

3371
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,740
They're gonna get to the Moby.

3372
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:10,760
Don't do it.

3373
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:13,300
I really want to.

3374
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:15,060
Where are you?

3375
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,300
He's literally in the rock.

3376
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:20,040
I'm waiting for you to set the zipline too, Fun.

3377
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:20,580
I just...

3378
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:21,220
Oh.

3379
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:22,160
Well...

3380
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:23,840
I just took it late.

3381
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:27,080
Wait, they actually got the rez off.

3382
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:27,820
What the fuck?

3383
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:28,940
Oh, he's heading over.

3384
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:30,700
He's heading over to you.

3385
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:31,980
Oh no.

3386
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:36,200
Oh, he's heading over.

3387
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:42,280
Timmy, don't look up.

3388
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:43,880
Timmy, don't look up, Timmy.

3389
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,540
Stop looking up.

3390
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:48,060
Look down.

3391
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:50,060
Timmy, don't.

3392
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:51,760
You already won for charity.

3393
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:52,600
Oh, nice.

3394
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:53,500
I'm at 66%.

3395
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,500
You should have used the alt-accel for yourself.

3396
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:00,100
Wait, do you have the increased fuel?

3397
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:00,880
Yeah.

3398
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:03,840
Do you just hit the fucking...

3399
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:04,700
I hit the float.

3400
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,280
Bro, they're just gonna duck hunt you.

3401
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:08,900
What are you doing?

3402
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:09,400
They can't.

3403
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,180
They don't have the fucking ammo for you.

3404
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:12,880
I'm gonna go to the roof.

3405
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:17,920
They have other fish to fry.

3406
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,360
Oh my god, everybody's just...

3407
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,940
Wait, there's another Moby right there.

3408
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:25,000
Plug, plug.

3409
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:28,460
Plug, plug, de-rez.

3410
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:29,480
Oh.

3411
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:34,520
Bro, the loudest fucking kill ever.

3412
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:35,640
It's so quiet.

3413
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:36,340
It's so quiet.

3414
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:36,960
I'm in the air.

3415
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:37,840
They're not hearing shit.

3416
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:39,400
You have oob timer.

3417
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:41,860
Safe.

3418
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:42,860
Oh, I'm gonna die.

3419
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:43,500
So safe.

3420
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,220
They're not gonna go up the roof.

3421
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:47,440
Keep dying to ring it, keep.

3422
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:50,260
Keep dying to ring.

3423
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:51,620
Peep.

3424
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:53,840
There's no way.

3425
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:54,740
There's no way.

3426
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,340
I need to see.

3427
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:57,760
Did he get rez?

3428
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:00,980
About this time, I don't think.

3429
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:02,920
They just gotta leave him.

3430
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:04,680
Oh my god, I just had a heart attack.

3431
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:10,720
Man, if I was still alive, I could have droned so many people.

3432
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:14,940
Oh my god.

3433
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:16,300
Oh my god.

3434
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:17,680
Oh my god.

3435
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,340
The fucking rap part.

3436
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:20,680
That noise.

3437
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:23,480
Bro, that shit's scary.

3438
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:26,160
I think he's gonna clear a roof.

3439
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:27,700
Wait, they're rez-ing.

3440
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,800
No, no, no, there's no way.

3441
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:29,880
He's gonna go for the rez.

3442
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,200
Wait, there's two Mobys next to you.

3443
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:36,400
Are they using it?

3444
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,440
They might, they might, they might.

3445
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:42,040
Bro, what the fu- Oh my god.

3446
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:44,300
Bro!

3447
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:44,860
Bro!

3448
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:46,160
We're dead!

3449
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:46,720
We're dead!

3450
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:47,760
There's no way!

3451
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,620
There's no fucking way!

3452
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:52,620
You died for that!

3453
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,760
I'm not dead!

3454
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:54,420
What are you saying?

3455
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,260
You stole that shit.

3456
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:59,120
I'm not dead.

3457
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:00,100
Oh no!

3458
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,840
You don't mean I died for that.

3459
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:02,280
I'm not dead.

3460
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:04,820
Run.

3461
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:07,420
Wait,

3462
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:11,540
you're alive.

3463
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:13,860
What about my drone?

3464
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:14,420
What about my drone?

3465
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:17,200
Oh my god.

3466
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,000
What about my- Just throw it out.

3467
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:20,820
Just throw it out.

3468
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:21,600
Just don't get in it.

3469
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,140
Just throw it out.

3470
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:28,260
Okay, maybe I won't.

3471
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:30,980
It's okay, he's not gonna clear you.

3472
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:31,580
I'm leaving you.

3473
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,080
Wait, is there any more Mobys?

3474
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,660
If there's a Moby, you can plug us.

3475
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:38,680
I don't think I'm gonna be flagging a Moby.

3476
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:41,880
You guys are- The drone insta-hits it.

3477
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:42,680
It insta-hits it.

3478
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,260
You're good, you're good, you're good.

3479
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:46,800
Slowly.

3480
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:48,000
Oh!

3481
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:49,540
Oh, you're good!

3482
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,640
Go, go, go, go!

3483
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:51,380
To the left!

3484
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:51,920
Go all the way to the left!

3485
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:55,800
You're good, just get on top of the- No, no, no, chill, chill, chill, you're fine.

3486
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:56,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3487
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,300
Let's go, they're killing everyone else!

3488
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,020
They're killing everyone else!

3489
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:02,680
They're killing everyone else!

3490
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:04,180
No, no, no, don't flash your shield!

3491
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:05,280
Don't flash your shield!

3492
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:05,780
Don't do that!

3493
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,860
Don't do that!

3494
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:07,580
No, no, no!

3495
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:08,740
No!

3496
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,320
Enemy!

3497
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:12,420
Enemy!

3498
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:13,900
It's colluding!

3499
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:15,380
We got third, we got third.

3500
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:15,600
It's okay.

3501
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:16,720
We got third, we got third.

3502
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:18,200
It's literally his teammate.

3503
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,440
Oh my god!

3504
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,640
I should have droned.

3505
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:22,900
I should have droned!

3506
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:24,980
The rest was worth it, wasn't it?

3507
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:28,780
You were the survivor, not me.

3508
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:29,940
It flew away.

3509
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,820
SMH, teaming, teaming.

3510
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:35,920
Teaming, teaming.

3511
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:37,480
They're teaming.

3512
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:42,880
Okay, this man Peep has got to get off on me.

3513
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:44,520
What a fucking snitch!

3514
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:46,160
What a fucking snitch!

3515
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,820
What a fucking snitch!

3516
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:49,860
Yeah, finally they snitched us!

3517
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:50,220
Yeah, finally they snitched us!

3518
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,780
We got creeped.

3519
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:53,280
We got creeped.

3520
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:55,120
It's okay.

3521
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:57,080
We got third place in the end.

3522
01:56:57,540 --> 01:56:59,540
We got third place.

3523
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:02,160
It's okay.

3524
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:07,260
Jimmy had to rez them both again.

3525
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:08,080
Wait, really?

3526
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:12,260
All I'm saying is they should have rotated Seeker.

3527
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:15,200
Alright, Zone, what's your favorite charity?

3528
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:18,320
Who won charity?

3529
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,460
Who won the charity tournament?

3530
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:23,820
Not us.

3531
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:25,480
We don't know that!

3532
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:29,780
We could have clutched it out in the end.

3533
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:30,060
We could have clutched it out in the end.

3534
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:33,620
Yeah.

3535
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:34,040
That was fun though.

3536
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:34,580
That was fun.

3537
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:35,520
Yeah, that was really fun.

3538
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:37,760
Stopped that hard in a minute.

3539
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,180
That was pretty fun.

3540
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:43,240
You know what?

3541
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:45,600
I had a great time with you guys.

3542
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:46,680
That was fun.

3543
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:49,420
That was a lot of fun.

3544
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:51,740
I was so early.

3545
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:53,940
That was my only great thing.

3546
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:56,560
Yeah, that's the only issue I have.

3547
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:58,740
That it was so fucking early.

3548
01:57:58,740 --> 01:57:59,680
Dead.

3549
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:02,700
That was so, so, so tired.

3550
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:05,240
Be funny and knock one.

3551
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:07,260
Wait, did they actually win?

3552
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:08,060
Yeah.

3553
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:08,880
Like overall?

3554
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:10,860
What the fuck?

3555
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:11,160
How?

3556
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:13,580
Oh, they won the last game, so...

3557
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:14,780
Oh, they won the last one too?

3558
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:17,160
Where's the points?

3559
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:18,900
Yeah, where's the points?

3560
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,240
It's rigged.

3561
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:23,200
It's rigged.

3562
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:24,780
253 points.

3563
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:25,960
How dare they.

3564
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:31,820
Timmy really said screw Loba, I'm just gonna play Rampart.

3565
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:38,260
Oh my god, that Rampart ult was scary as fuck.

3566
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:40,860
He jumped in.

3567
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,960
I don't know how he got in behind me like that.

3568
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,580
He like dropped off the balcony.

3569
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:49,580
Is that the best part when it's a surprise for you?

3570
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:52,540
You know?

3571
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:55,300
No comment.

3572
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:58,720
All I can say is thank you for watching.

3573
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:04,660
I'm saying is that like they should deduct the Seekers for points for dying to the ring twice.

3574
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:08,720
Like at that point they should have their points deducted.

3575
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:11,760
GG's guys.

3576
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:12,900
Have a great time.

3577
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:15,460
It was nice meeting you, Rektar.

3578
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,160
It was really nice meeting you.

3579
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,200
If you had any part of the invite, thank you for the invite.

3580
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:20,880
Yeah.

3581
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:22,140
It was great.

3582
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:25,660
I'm gonna go peace out now and talk to my chat.

3583
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:26,920
GG's guys.

3584
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:30,800
Good luck with your scrims.

3585
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:31,920
GG's.

3586
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,280
Alright guys, I'm gonna leave NRG.

3587
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:36,000
Oh, you're leaving NRG?

3588
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:37,020
Yeah, guys, sorry.

3589
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:38,280
I hate to break it.

3590
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:41,000
I have to leave NRG because they weren't paying me enough.

3591
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:42,160
So, I'm sorry.

3592
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:46,120
It's really like that.

3593
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:48,660
I'm sorry guys.

3594
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:49,700
I gotta leave.

3595
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:52,180
I got an offer for another team.

3596
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:53,580
So I gotta leave you guys.

3597
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:55,920
My teammates are always getting poached, man.

3598
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:57,880
Sorry guys.

3599
01:59:58,780 --> 02:00:00,160
So, good luck.

3600
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:03,300
I hope you guys find a new IGL in time to replace me.

3601
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:05,040
We'll just pick up that freaking Nocturnal guy again.

3602
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:06,160
We'll pick the old one.

3603
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:07,440
I guess.

3604
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:12,120
I know it won't be the same, but like, you know, maybe, you know...

3605
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:14,320
Maybe you'll get far.

3606
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:15,420
You know, maybe...

3607
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:18,520
Alright, GG's.

3608
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:19,160
GG's guys.

3609
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:20,160
Bye bye.

3610
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:20,660
Bye bye.

3611
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:22,760
Hey guys.

3612
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:24,040
That was really fun.

3613
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:28,720
I had a great time with Rektar and Fuzz.

3614
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,480
Chat.

3615
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:31,940
It was my first time playing with Rektar.

3616
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:34,780
So, fun invited Rektar.

3617
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,880
Cause like, I talked about this before.

3618
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:40,060
I was like, desperate to find like, substitute teammates.

3619
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:48,220
Literally, I got fun and Rektar in on like, I think on like, Monday or something.

3620
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:49,840
Like on the 27th.

3621
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:53,220
Because we had like, issues with finding substitutes.

3622
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:58,700
And like, huge shout out to FUN for grabbing me.

3623
02:00:58,720 --> 02:00:59,580
And grabbing a third for me.

3624
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:01,660
Cause I was like, I cannot give up.

3625
02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:03,180
I was just like...

3626
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:06,440
I was just like, I give up guys.

3627
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:06,800
I can't.

3628
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:08,980
I give up finding a third team.

3629
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:10,220
You can do it FUN.

3630
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:14,600
But it was a great time.

3631
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,780
I wish we could use cars.

3632
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:17,820
I feel like if we were able to use cars.

3633
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,540
It would have been better.

3634
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:21,620
I really wanted to do my armored car strat.

3635
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:24,140
I really wanted to do my armored car strat.

3636
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:25,380

10 AM.

3652
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:54,020
It was a lot.

3653
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:56,420
I'm not used to waking up before 12.

3654
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:57,020

3655
02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:02,120
I'm so not used to waking up before 12.

3656
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:05,860
I'm so not used to waking up before 12.

3657
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:07,260
I did it.

3658
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:09,540
Huge shout out again to Nokia.

3659
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:12,800
For inviting me to the tournament.

3660
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:14,820
For inviting me to the tournament.

3661
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:17,260
And for sending a little care package over.

3662
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:18,340
And for sending a little care package over.

3663
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:19,020
And everything.

3664
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:19,860
So yeah.

3665
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:25,020
This was apparently the very first esports tournament ran on wifi.

3666
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:26,660
It still counts.

3667
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:27,800
It's still an esports tournament.

3668
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:29,100
Because pro players were in it.

3669
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:30,440
Pro players plus me.

3670
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:31,820
So yes.

3671
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:34,140
This was apparently the first one on wifi.

3672
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:36,540
And they sent me a free modem.

3673
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:37,380
But yes.

3674
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:37,940
Thank you guys.

3675
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,320
Thank you to Nokia again.

3676
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:41,580
As always everybody stay hydrated.

3677
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:43,920
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3678
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,020
And you stay up for me.

3679
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:45,680
Head to bed.

3680
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:46,720
Cause you deserve it.

3681
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:47,580
Oh my god.

3682
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:49,360
One funny story before I leave.

3683
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:53,920
The day one for WrestleTuber got flagged for adult content.

3684
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:55,720
And I was like what the fuck.

3685
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:59,040
I was like how?

3686
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:01,080
And then.

3687
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,660
I told my youtube guy.

3688
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:04,640
I was like hey.

3689
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:07,020
Can we remove this flag?

3690
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:08,920
Cause we got age restrict.

3691
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:11,780
We got age restrict your WrestleTuber vibe.

3692
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:12,660
And then.

3693
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,260
I messaged my youtube guy.

3694
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,120
And it got instantly taken off.

3695
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,840
Like the age restriction.

3696
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:22,700
Was instantly taken off.

3697
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:23,920
The moment I messaged.

3698
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:24,800
Cause they were like oh yeah.

3699
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:26,720
Dude crap.

3700
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,660
Cause like I don't know.

3701
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:30,020
It got age restricted.

3702
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:31,520
I was like why?

3703
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,720
Why did it get age restricted?

3704
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:36,180
Anyway.

3705
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,900

3706
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:38,900
