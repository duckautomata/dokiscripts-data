RB is throw.

29
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,250
Okay.

30
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:54,750
All right.

We got this.

32
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,510
We got this.

33
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,510
We're figuring it out.

34
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,910
Very slowly but surely.

35
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,270
Wait.

36
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,290
Oh my gosh.

37
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,130

00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,630
Oh hey.

Always want more Ridley trophies.

42
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,530
All right.

43
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,870
RB is grapple.

44
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,270
Okay.

45
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,130
I got this.

46
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,630
I hate the detective mode.

47
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,770
Because the detective mode.

48
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:22,650
test our detective mode makes it so that's harder to like
see you like the flashes i hate the flashes so much uh

broomstick thank you the super chat thank you thank you glad

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,550
Wait, how do I dodge?

53
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,670
Oh, it's okay.

54
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,690
They're just dead.

55
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,010
All right.

56
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,550
Wait, wait.

57
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,490
No, I forgot how to do them.

58
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,590
Finish your move.

59
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:54,490
Okay.

60
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,010
Why?

61
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,070
Okay, there we go.

62
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,530
We're five.

63
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,090
All right, it's coming back to me.

64
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,250
It's like driving a car.

65
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,690
I haven't drove a car in 10 years, but it's just like
driving a car.

66
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,190
There you go.

67
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,070
It's almost just like driving a car.

68
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:13,870
All right.

69
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:24,090
I don't think I should touch a car for I don't think so
condition unconscious oh I can like see their heart rate all

70
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:33,310
right nice at least they're just unconscious uh I mean like
if I can't kill okay not gonna lie if I can't kill I feel

71
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:44,290
like legally like in the bat rules I should be able to use a
crowbar as long as I don't kill anybody like if I can use

72
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,090
the battering runs, I should be able to use a crowbar.

73
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,270
Because, like, I feel like the batterangs are, like, they're
still metal, right?

74
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,230
So legally, if you think about it, I should be able to also
use a crowbar.

75
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,290
Because I'm already giving them brain damage, right?

76
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,950
So if I'm giving...

77
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,130
Okay, yes, people are like, Batman doesn't kill.

78
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:31,250
kill them like get making them paralyzed is not killing it's
just very cruel but they're not gonna die like they're not

79
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:39,830
going to die but I'm just shutting I don't know how to dodge
in the middle of kicking ass super thank you for the super

80
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,430
chat thank you thank you like why do you assume I'm gonna
for the head.

81
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,090
I can I can aim for Jesus Christ.

82
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,750
Think of the Jason Fats.

83
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,930
He lived.

84
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,290
He's still alive.

85
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,130
You can't say that.

86
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,430
Poetry guys.

87
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,210
He's still alive.

88
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,110
Like a serious injury.

89
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,210
But like Batman doesn't care.

90
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,250
He doesn't care if someone seriously injured.

91
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,990
Oh, dokey.

92
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,750
Are you allowed to beat pizza?

93
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,630
Is that, of course I'm allowed to beat pizza.

94
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,330
I fucking eat tomatoes all the time.

95
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,130
Thank you for the super chat.

96
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:23,430
Thank you.

97
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,050
Thank you.

98
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,910
Like, all I'm saying is that, look, Batman picks and chooses
a lot with his rules.

99
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,050
That's all I'm saying.

100
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,470
All right, hello.

101
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,010
Oh, shit.

102
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,590
Oh, shit.

103
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,210
I've got you!

104
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:49,970
I've got you!

105
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,250
Oh my god!

106
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,450
It's okay.

107
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,110
But all he uses are bad things.

108
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,870
He can't pick up a weapon without bat in front of the name.

109
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,210
I can literally call this a bat bar!

110
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,250
Let's think of the super chat.

111
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:06,690
Thank you.

112
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,030
Thank you.

113
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,600
I mean, you're still getting air in there.

114
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,240
As long as the gas doesn't...

115
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,640
You really think you can beat the Joker?

116
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,760
I can't even beat the Joker.

117
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,100
I can't even beat the joker leave it cash can you control
the ventilation system in there drag it's a no-go he

118
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:46,900
disabled remote access i'll find a way wait does he have
like a hook for a hand where's your hand sir wait that's not

119
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:55,180
even like i guess like arkham asylum doesn't pay very well
because that's not even a prosthetic that's literally a hook

120
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:07,860
hand like holy shit holy shit shit where is my funding going
I'm fucking Bruce Wayne where is my funding going I funded

121
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:16,640
like five million dollars to this fucking asylum and all you
can get is a fucking met that's not even good I feel like if

122
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,740
you have a metal literally attached like how does that help
you it's not even a prosthetic you can't even pick anything

123
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:31,660
you might as well just have a stump hand like Yes, this is a
prison Like I feel like there's no actual use to that

124
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,880
Because you can't pick anything What are you going to do?

125
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:47,340
Put make holes or something on like pieces of paper Like go
put the TV Oh, use it to press buttons on the TV Oh, yeah,

126
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:53,400

caffeine Thank you for the magenta soup Thank you, thank you

127
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,700
Wait, you eat tomatoes Wouldn't that be cannibalism?

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,060
Someone clearly didn't know my lore.

129
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,340
I had an entire stream dedicated to eating all my tomato
children.

130
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,200
Open the door.

131
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Oh, the door is blocked.

132
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Okay, what do we do?

133
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,520
Alright, clearly...

134
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,740
We don't do anything here.

135
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,840
Alright, yeah, the weak should eat the strong.

136
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,540
Exactly.

137
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,940
Now you're speaking my language.

138
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,380
It's called survival of the fittest.

139
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,460
Bruce Wayne has money.

140
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,720
You're Batman.

141
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,400
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

142
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:31,740
Thank you.

143
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,280
Thank you.

144
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,560
Alright, check the map.

145
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,240
No!

146
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm going to figure this out by pure instinct.

147
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,920
This is called the gamer instinct.

148
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,960
Can I just leave that guy to die?

149
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,080
Does he actually matter?

150
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,660
I'm pretty sure he doesn't matter.

151
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,940
Okay, let's see.

152
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,840
Where do I go?

153
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,940
I go?

154
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,940
I clearly can't do anything here.

155
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,100
Did I jump?

156
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,380
I'm gonna jump.

157
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,400
Okay, I should not have jumped.

158
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,600
Use detective mode!

159
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,180
No!

160
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,780
Okay, I should use detective mode.

161
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,940
Uh... Oh.

162
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,700
You used to remove pure... Okay, but how do I get there?

163
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,480
Can I just...

164
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,140
Can I just do this?

165
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,280
Okay, no.

166
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,340
But what do I do?

167
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,000
Conditioned, terrified.

168
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,240
Can I just kill him?

169
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,460
There you go.

170
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,900
I mean, he's unconscious, so he's still okay.

171
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,440
I can't let that man be in the room of toxic as quickly as
possible.

172
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,680
I can't let this man die.

173
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,600
Well, that's unfortunate then.

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,960
He's okay.

175
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,260
I mean, look, see, he still has a heart rate.

176
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,260
Like, what's gonna happen to him?

177
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,680
I mean, he's still okay.

178
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,340
That was a big fall.

179
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,020
Look, he's okay.

180
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,100
Look at him.

181
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,420
Look, we can, look, see?

182
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,300
It's not even red.

183
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,440
It's like yellow.

184
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,860
All right.

185
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,520
We gotta figure this out.

186
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:25,880
Okay.

187
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
What the fuck do I?

188
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,360
Okay.

189
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,360
Let's see.

190
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,680
Like, see, he's unconscious.

191
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,860
Guys, he's not dead.

192
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,280
He's just unconscious.

193
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,160
Can't fucking grapple anywhere.

194
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,660
Where is it?

195
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,660
Where do I go?

196
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,820
I feel like this is not where I should be going.

197
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,980
He's just...

198
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,760
Sorry, I mean, I'm just gonna leave him.

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,720
I feel like we don't have to do anything with this guy.

200
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,600

Okay.

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Okay, I got this.

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,100
I'll eventually make it.

209
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,780
It's okay.

210
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,500
I'm alive.

211
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,480
Oh.

212
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,960
Someone held bad, baby.

213
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,160
I was sorry.

214
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,480
I didn't realize there was a limit to how many times I could
do.

215
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,900
No, I didn't do this again!

216
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,480
God damn it, okay.

217
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,600
I didn't realize it's okay.

218
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,460
I wanted to beat him up again anyway.

219
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,640
All right, it's all right.

220
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,240
It's fine.

221
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,860
It's fine.

222
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,960
All right, but he's laughing.

223
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,860
He's clearly having a good time.

224
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,100
All right, we'll be fine.

225
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,220
Let's see.

226
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,700
All right, if If he's laughing, why are you dead?

227
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,820
And Takeda, thank you for the super chat.

228
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,580
Thank you, thank you.

229
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,760
Yo, golden trophy bird.

230
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,420
Hope you're doing well.

231
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,040
Thank you.

232
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,780
Yeah, I'm doing great.

233
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm good to play Batman.

234
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,600
Okay.

235
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
Alright, here we go.

236
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,540
We can do this again.

237
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,380
Alright.

238
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,660
Don't worry.

239
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,360
You'll be okay.

240
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,300
Yay.

241
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,280
See, he's fine.

242
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,100
See, I got XP.

243
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,460
If it's not fine, Why did I get XP?

244
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,960
Just think of that.

245
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,240
If it was not fine, why did it give me experience points?

246
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,200
Oh my god, it's right here.

247
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,420
Guys, who the fuck said glide?

248
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,860
Who the fuck said glide?

249
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,520
Who said glide?

250
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,500
It was literally right there.

251
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,560
Oh, whoops.

252
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,320
Whoops, I know!

253
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,300
I don't think I fit it.

254
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,220
Now, glide.

255
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,540
Wait.

256
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,660
Wait, is that not- did I not fix the gas?

257
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,060
Where else would there be gas?

258
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,820
I thought I fixed it.

259
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,640
You used to remove- Wait, where did I not fix it?

260
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,700
Look, it's- it's going on.

261
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,520
lessened?

262
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,260
Oh!

263
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,900
Okay.

264
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,100
Fly to a part above the ass.

265
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Okay.

266
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,980
Wee!

267
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,840
Nice.

268
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,740
I did it.

269
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,660
Alright, where do I have to go?

270
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,420
See, it's okay.

271
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,500
Look, he's still unconscious.

272
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,640
Nice.

273
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,680
I'm doing it.

274
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,860
Okay.

275
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,800

276
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,480
Yeah, there it is.

277
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,960

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,400
Is that everything?

286
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,220

287
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:14,980

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,560
What do I glide?

292
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,520
What else?

293
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,120
Is this still laughing gas?

294
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,880
No, it's not.

295
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,660
Boop.

296
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,680
Boop.

297
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,640
What do you mean?

298
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,400
I literally solved this myself.

299
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,780
You guys said glide.

300
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:43,140
You guys gave me instructions out of order, and I figured it
out myself.

301
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:46,880
Nice.

302
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,020
Look at that.

303
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,920
Aaron Cash.

304
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,120
Are you relevant?

305
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,920
One of the most senior and respected guards at Arkham.

306
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,220
Cash is only afraid of one inmate.

307
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,320
Killer Croc was severely wounded.

308
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,580
Cash once during a riot.

309
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,820
Cash remains determined.

310
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,520
to keep the asylum ailments under control and to conquer his
fears of Croc.

311
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,940
Not the Joker?

312
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,300
I mean, I guess like, because like the killer Croc ate his
hand.

313
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,520
I still think that is like the worst prosthetic you can ever
get because you can't do anything with that.

314
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,280
Like, it's literally just two hooks.

315
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,980
What can you grab?

316
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,140
I guess like your shirt.

317
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
What if you need it like, like it's so useless.

318
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,900
Like, what do you grab?

319
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,820
What?

320
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,180
Oh shit, he's a real person in 2003.

321
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,340
Hello, I saved your life.

322
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,800
You're welcome, guys.

323
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,360
So what's going on?

324
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,920
My radio went dead soon after you brought Joker in.

325
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,670
We lock him up, he gets out, and more people die.

326
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,430
If I just had one minute alone at that hour.

327
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,670
I'm back scratcher.

328
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:02,990
Who's interviews this?

329
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,410
Patient's name is Edward Napop.

330
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,390
Why do I have to use the bathroom?

331
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,150
Thank you for the super chat.

332
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:11,590
Thank you.

333
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,110
Thank you.

334
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,330
To

335
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,540
be fair, a lot of villains have, like, terrible childhoods.

336
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,120
That's why they hate the world.

337
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,720
Very well.

338
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,420
I was determined to prove him wrong.

339
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,980
So I entered a contest.

340
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,820
A prize to the kid who could figure out an almost

341
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,120
impossible...

342
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,380
He was convinced I had cheated.

343
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,040
He kept yelling, you must have cheated.

344
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,900
Admit it, you moron, you cheated.

345
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,140
I swore I did.

346
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:53,700
Whoa.

347
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,740
Where's the mom?

348
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,780
I'm sorry to hear that.

349
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,960
Wait, he did cheat?

350
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,600
You're a fucking cheater?

351
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,560
Oh my god.

352
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,640
I can't believe it, Riddler.

353
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,280
What about integrity?

354
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,940
Astro, thank you for the gifted ship.

355
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,960
Thank you, thank you.

356
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,420
Alright, where do I go?

357
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,680
Where am I supposed to go?

358
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,640
I already got a doc.

359
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,760
Oh, we have to get multiple doctors.

360
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,420
I forgot.

361
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,240
It's not just one doctor.

362
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,900
Okay, but is there, like, anything important here?

363
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,360
At all?

364
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,820
I feel like there was, like, a vent above here, right?

365
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,260
Wait, oh, I can open doors.

366
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:38,980
Hello.

367
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,540
Oh, hey, he's a guy.

368
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,320
See, he's alive.

369
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,060
See?

370
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,820
Look at that.

371
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,260
Batman never kills.

372
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,280
Look at that.

373
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,000
I told you I can't kill.

374
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,550
There's a riddle in there.

375
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,150
There is.

376
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:08,650

physical body but that's okay that's what doc that's why

All right, don't worry.

382
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,610

There you go.

385
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,690
Subject too small?

386
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,870
What else am I supposed to look at?

387
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:47,850
What?

388
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,330
How is it too small?

389
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,990
Is it because I'm looking at it too hard?

390
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,170
Oh, zoom in.

391
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,590

escapes gotham on high alert oh my god recently free youtube
shorts thank you um for destroying the comics industry

394
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:32,230
i learned about there's like this villain in batman called
the calendar man and like before they reconned him to be

395
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:40,530
like a super serious villain he would like kill villains on
holidays which i don't know it feels like okay i in my

396
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:51,830
opinion if the villain all he does is kill people wait kill
people on holidays then like you know who did it like

397
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:05,230
oh shit what like oh my god somebody died on christmas he
was murdered who could it be well the only person that kills

398
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:17,350
people during the holidays is this one particular villain so
it has to be calendar man it just feels very i don't know

399
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:26,470
like if you're gonna kill somebody i feel like you should it
should be more random than a holiday nice thank you for the

400
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,430
free stuff I actually thought it was going to be like...

401
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:32,810
Nice.

402
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:33,530
Yay!

403
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,510
That's the point.

404
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,130
Some villains like that, but it's stupid!

405
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,030
Like, they don't want to get caught, so why would you do the
one thing that gets you caught?

406
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,250
Okay, we gotta go for this one.

407
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,770
Why is it yellow?

408
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,390
Okay.

409
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,250
He did more than kill people.

410
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,410
He did a ton of holiday-themed crime.

411
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,590
Then you know who did it.

412
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,950
Monster, thank you for this super chat.

413
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:05,530
Thank you.

414
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,190
Thank you.

415
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,390
It doesn't matter.

416
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,950
It's still on a holiday.

417
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,050
They want to get caught?

418
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,370
The rehabilitation doesn't work, Batman.

419
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,030
He's encouraging.

420
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,050
Oh, is this saw?

421
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,600
Don't speak.

422
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,740
You're safe now.

423
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,340
But it's a trap.

424
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,260
I know.

425
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,340
Just not for me.

426
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,220
It's true.

427
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,140
You really are the world's greatest detective.

428
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,040
That's not even a puzzle.

429
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,240
It's a trap.

430
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,320
Oh yeah, really?

431
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,280
Who would have thought this was a trap all along?

432
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,040
Oh my god!

433
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,180
He's alone in there by himself!

434
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,100
What could happen?

435
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,700
Wow, okay, hey man.

436
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,740
I'm trying to do a combo move right now.

437
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,820
Excuse me.

438
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,520
Why are you disturbing my combo?

439
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,140
Oh shit, go come on let me beat him up.

440
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,040

What do you mean?

451
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,840
I counted so much.

452
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,960
Okay, Arkham Night Shift.

Wait, there's only one doctor per Night Shift?

460
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:16,290
Killer Croc Transfer Week 2 nurses That is not a lot of
nurses For like an asylum Because asylum is filled with like

461
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:24,850
Crazy people because that's what an asylum Is for I feel
like nine nurses That is That is definitely understaffed

sociopath when his plans failed partly due to the surgical

472
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:14,180
skills of Thomas Wayne versus father Elliot blamed Bruce an
incredibly skilled surgeon as an adult Elliot planned an

473
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:23,160
elaborate revenge on on scheme on Batman he disguised
himself as the villain Hush his face covered in banishes but

474
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,980
is when the end defeated and amassed by the dark night Hush
still plots revenge against Batman generating complicated

475
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,080
schemes with surgical position which Wait, so he's just
Batman with too much money.

476
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,140
So he's literally just Bruce Wayne with a lot of fucking
money.

477
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,300
That's cool.

478
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,340
But instead he's evil.

479
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:52,220
But if he's like, okay, all I'm saying is that, like, okay,
Batman, he runs a company that develops weapons.

480
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,020
Tommy Elliot is just a surgeon.

481
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:10,560
where is he how is he i don't know how you can compare to
like anything else he's literally just a surgeon like how is

batman at least has a fucking like was it fortune 500
company that specifically develops weapons and armor.

484
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,380
Great physical strength augmented by a hatred of Bruce
Wayne.

485
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,400
World class search and capable of extraordinarily medical
breakthroughs.

486
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,680
Master of Disguise.

487
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,800

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,020
How is he a Master of Disguise?

489
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,680

Let's go.

506
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,360
All right, let's see.

507
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,460
Where's the last one?

508
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,140
The last one is all the way over here.

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,320
Nice.

510
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,460
All right, I figured it out.

511
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,600
It's this way.

512
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,400
Presence!

513
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,320
There's a lot of met.

Oh, where do I go?

516
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,540
Okay, this way.

517
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,420
Sometimes the map is, like, really difficult to navigate.

518
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,340
But that is only half the story.

519
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,180
I swear, everybody in the DC universe is, like, jacked as
fuck.

520
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,460
Like, everyone has, like, a 20-year membership in...

521
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,040

00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,070
Guys, I don't use controller very often.

572
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,690
Guys, is it noticeable that I don't use controller?

573
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,590

702
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,360
Cool man, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank
you.

703
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,780
Oh, think about it.

704
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,890
Precariously over a deadly drop.

705
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,310
What say I just blow the- Do it!

706
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:17,590
Do it, no boss?

707
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,050
I got a sack of puppies.

708
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:25,890
Joker would never do it because like, he gets his kicks
going by, by having Batman as like an arch enemy.

709
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,030
Got a few more surprises in store for you.

710
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,250
Prepare to face your face.

711
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:39,270
His greatest fear is like losing Batman and then becoming an
office worker.

712
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,090
Wait, Scarecrow?

713
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,360
Where the fuck is Scarecrow?

714
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,640
What's wrong?

715
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,500
Are you gonna take your hat off to Harley Bats?

716
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,700
Wait, is it gonna become a horror story?

717
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,400
Is it gonna come out last?

718
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,180
What is Batman scared of?

719
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,400
Riddle's!

720
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,140
I'm scared of not getting that riddle trophy.

721
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:48,410
Joker, no matter what, there is one fangirl out there that
would love to see you in a thong.

722
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:49,390
i.e.

723
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:49,870
Harley.

724
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,310
Taxes, my number one fear.

725
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,570
Okay, let's see.

726
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:58,590
Oh, wait, what?

727
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,490
developed by when these control points are considered hack
proof.

728
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,250
That is such a fucking lie.

729
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,110
Why does it keep telling me it's hack proof?

730
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,230
It is not hack proof.

731
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,650
Even Joker can fucking hack into this.

732
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,450
Okay, let's put this on.

733
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:13,750
Hanging this.

734
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,070
Nice.

735
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:20,410
Okay.

736
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,610
What every billionaire sphere taxes.

737
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,410
Yeah, I feel like Batman has multiple offshore accounts.

738
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:38,450
Gordon?

739
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:40,750
Gordon!

740
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:43,890
Watch it.

741
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:44,770
Thank you for the super chat.

742
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:45,090
Thank you.

743
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:45,610
Thank you.

744
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,270
Oh, yeah.

745
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,330
It is canon.

746
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,330
His biggest fear is the IRS.

747
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:52,230
I forgot about that.

748
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:55,840
Oh.

749
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:01,770
Alright, let's go.

750
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:09,310
Let me in.

751
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:09,930
Let me in.

752
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,190
Let me in.

753
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:14,910
Gordon?

754
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:16,590
Gordon, you okay?

755
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:18,290
Okay.

756
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,390
Gordon, look at me.

757
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,570
You gotta blink or your eyes or you're gonna dry out.

758
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:31,990
I'm sorry, Jim.

759
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,110
Wait, is he dead?

760
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:35,690
What?

761
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,770
They just killed off Jim Gordon?

762
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,010
Wait, no.

763
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,030
I have to be having a nightmare right now.

764
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:45,370
There's no fucking way Jim Gordon just dies like that.

765
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,170
There is no way.

766
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,330
This has to be a nightmare.

767
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,810
Batman, wake up!

768
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,140
Hunt down Commissioner.

769
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,100
There's no fucking way.

770
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,700
There's no way.

771
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,020
There's no way they...

772
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,740
They just kill him like that!

773
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,320
I must be dreaming.

774
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,560
I must be having a nightmare from the scarecrow.

775
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,780
Yeah, this is definitely a nightmare.

776
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,040
Okay, look.

777
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,540
Look, this place sucks, but it doesn't suck that much.

778
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:29,450
The morgue.

779
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:29,930
Oh, shit.

780
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,450
People are going to come alive, aren't they?

781
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,750
I don't like this.

782
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:43,130
I am not a fan of this.

783
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,750
I am not a fan.

784
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,690
When did this become out last?

785
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,890
Wait,

786
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,940
this is the morgue.

787
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,360
Where are the dead?

788
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,140
dead bodies.

789
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,340
Hello?

790
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,040

Nice.

857
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,960
There's no way he's going to look past this wall, right?

858
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,940
There's no fucking way.

859
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,360
Okay, I don't know his pattern right now, so I'm, like,
scared.

860
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,920
I'm actually scared.

00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:24,140

the gotcha moment

862
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,420
what was that my biggest fear light

863
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:48,490
that's fucking right get flashbanged what silent killer of
the oceans can be found in a tiny jar what it can wait what

864
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:57,270
all right character bio is he is that him the scarecrow
taunted and bullied as a youth jonathan crane vowed to

865
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:03,510
overcome his fear through the study of psychology and
biochemistry kicked out of his university for experimenting

866
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:09,890
on human subjects crane then adopted the identity of the
scarecrow and armed himself with specialized fear-inducing

867
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:16,230
gas that makes the person's deepest phobias become
frighteningly real his ongoing criminal reign of terror

868
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:25,430
makes him one of batman's most psychologically dangerous
bows stupid crane you have to go through animals and then

869
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:37,470
experiment on humans because apparently that's how ethical
apparently that's more ethical you can experiment on humans

870
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:49,730
all you want you just gotta follow the process like all
right let's see professional what the fuck Occupation.

871
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:51,330
Professional criminal.

872
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:52,710
That's his job.

873
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:53,510
Alright.

874
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,350
He just needs to follow the process.

875
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,210
And then he can experiment on as many humans as he wants.

876
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,950
Welcome to science.

877
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,520
Had a little run-in with scarecrow.

878
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,260
Slowed me down.

879
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,980
I'll get back to you in a bit.

880
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,320
The jar.

881
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,100
Oh, there's the jar.

882
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,520
There it is.

883
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:17,960
What is that?

884
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,800
Is that finger?

885
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,740
Oh, shit.

886
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,120
No, not my explosive jail.

887
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,820
Subject too small.

888
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,900
Do I have to fucking scan this?

889
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:26,520
Okay.

890
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,020
All right.

891
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,380
What the fuck is that?

892
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,060
That one could have been solved by a monkey.

893
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,700
But good job, nevertheless.

894
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,840
What is that?

895
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,440
Oops, sorry.

896
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,800
The great white shark.

897
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:43,540
A crooked financer who stole millions of dollars.

898
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,380
Warren Wright thought he'd scored a legal victory when his
insanity P. Lee went through.

899
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,160
But when he got...

900
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,180
I actually don't know this criminal.

901
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:58,160
But when he got to Arkham Asylum, he realized his mistake
driven insane by the other mistakes he was also disfigured

902
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:05,860
by an encounter with mr freeze that left him without hair oh
my god it's Voldemort a nose ears or lips calling himself

903
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:13,840
the great white shark he filled his teeth into he filed his
teeth into fangs to more perfectly resemble his new namesake

904
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:21,580
putting the financial skills to use he has become a major
player in Gotham's underground crime scene running a number

905
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:27,220
of rackets from Oh, so he's like the the accountant for like
criminals

906
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:37,420
He's like the main accountant Warren white The underrated
villain.

907
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:50,760
I mean I mean he's an accountant so Like wow, I'm so scared
when she uses for a variety of criminal purposes It's kind

908
01:00:50,760 --> 01:01:00,320
of massage that makes him resemble a shark thief sharpened
like i'm just saying he's he's just he's an accountant he's

909
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:10,650
not like an actual villain he's just there to help the
villains do their taxes because like i assume the villains

910
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:18,390

918
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:33,420
figment of your twisted little mind saying here just roam
with the bats It gets easier once you get in.

No, I can't.

928
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:44,780

940
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,100
What if I go this way?

941
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,640
Okay, actually, I don't know where this way goes.

942
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,300
Okay, let's just go back.

947
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,460
Not gonna lie.

948
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:58,200
His whole thing was, like, to defeat corruption.

949
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,040
But, like...

950
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,360
Does it look like it's going well?

Harley, it's not great.

963
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:11,100
At least top 10%.

01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,780

in your bedroom life right about now.

967
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,120
But like, as Batman,

968
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,860
Batman has enough lady problems at the moment.

969
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,740
So like, I really don't care.

Or do I just walk past?

974
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:28,150
Do I just walk past him?

975
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:32,370
There's no way he noticed.

976
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:35,310
There's no way.

977
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,580
There's no way.

978
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,420
There's no...

979
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:42,840

983
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:49,500
There's no way.

984
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,220
There's no way.

985
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,560
Nice, alright.

986
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:54,340
It's okay.

987
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,660
If I don't see what they actually look like, I can't
humanize him.

988
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,140
You guys fucked up?

989
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,960

990
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:07,880
Oh, hey, really?

991
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:08,960
Nice.

992
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:17,620
As long as you don't humanize them and you don't see what
they look like, it's okay.

993
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,260
Get over here.

994
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,320
So, like, I'm not actually killing anybody.

995
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,020
All right.

996
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,960
Can you see me through the...

997
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,420
Can you see me through this?

998
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:40,760
It's great.

999
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:41,680
There's just skeletons.

1000
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:42,900
Skeletons aren't real.

1001
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,260
All right.

1002
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:47,520
Is that him?

1003
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,940
Skeletons aren't real.

1004
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1005
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1006
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,880
Come on, turn around.

1007
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,220
Turn around.

1008
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,480
Turn around.

1009
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,400
Okay, nice.

1010
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:09,160
Well.

1011
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,440
I like how I, like, jab him in the fucking back.

1012
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,320
All right, we gotta get the last guy.

1013
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,200
Okay, how the fuck do I get the last one?

1014
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,380
Guess what's inside you right now?

1015
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:23,920
Blood!

1016
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,260
What else would be inside me?

1017
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:33,970
Okay, you can't see me from there.

1018
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:37,330
Wait, who's that over there?

1019
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:39,170
A blue skill.

1020
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,410
Okay, I'm just gonna...

1021
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,030
Okay, it would really suck if you just turned around.

1022
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:46,750
There we go.

1023
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:48,570
What's...

1024
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,290
Yeah, tomato!

1025
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:52,410
See?

1026
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:53,830
Okay.

1027
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:59,650
There's a no right here.

1028
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:00,730
Holy fuck.

1029
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,930
Okay.

1030
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:04,670
Okay, okay, that would have been...

1031
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,050
That would have been awkward.

1032
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,930
Okay, how do I do this?

1033
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:15,210
Alright, a little oopsie there, but it's okay, they can't
hear.

1034
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:19,230
Oh, I get past this.

1035
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:20,870
Okay.

1036
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:24,850
You can't hear this.

1037
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:27,910
Okay, pick up.

1038
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,510
Can I just drop down?

1039
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,750
What if I just drop down?

1040
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,610
Okay, I'm like worried if I drop down.

1041
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:44,670
Do I drop?

1042
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,050
Wait, is that?

1043
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,430
That's glass, right?

1044
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,690
Is that glass?

1045
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:54,770
I can't tell if that's glass.

1046
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:57,050
Oh, shit, it is.

1047
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:57,450
Okay.

1048
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:58,630
Can I?

1049
01:10:58,850 --> 01:10:59,510
No, I can't.

1050
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:00,470
Oh, wait, can I?

1051
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:03,690
Now I can be broken with enough force.

1052
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:04,950
Okay.

1053
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,250
Tagging it?

1054
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:13,190
Okay.

1055
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,290
Okay, I feel like I might die if I do this.

1056
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:20,550
Okay, I'll stand over.

1057
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,150
Nice.

1058
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,690
You took longer than I thought.

1059
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:29,010
He's out of control.

1060
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,570
He's trying to prove something.

1061
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,950
I'm not sure I can stop him this time.

1062
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,490
You'll do it.

1063
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:35,550
Batman, listen.

1064
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:37,110
We're not alone.

1065
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:39,750
Gordon, please just kill him, Gordon.

1066
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:43,830
Batman will keep thinking rehabilitation will work.

1067
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:45,970
Gordon, just kill him.

1068
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,750
Oh, am I getting to you?

1069
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:49,630
Am I?

1070
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:50,630
God.

1071
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,170
You're going to love this next bit.

1072
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,740
It wants Dr. Young's login.

1073
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:07,860
Never mind that.

1074
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,280
Get behind me now.

01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,140

01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,090
And a dream!

1148
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,170
It's like bowling.

1149
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:44,690
It really is actually.

1150
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:47,090
It actually is like bowling.

1151
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:55,490
I learned.

1152
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:57,470
I didn't have to do anything.

1153
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,790
Thank fucking god there's friendly fire.

1154
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,260
Oh, the Batmobile!

1155
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,060
I'm fine, Jim.

1156
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:16,980

1161
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,460
Bro, that was like $50 million.

1162
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,240
Bruce.

1163
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:08,740
We could have we could have solved the homeless problem in
Gotham City with that money.

1164
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,060
Not the Papal view.

1165
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,880
Gotham will panic.

1166
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:17,400
You're needed there.

1167
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,780
tax right off

1168
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:34,120
it has to be the the doctor that went back to the mansion
and get the papers frosty and kai thank you for the joining

1169
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:41,940
the tomato farm thank you go through the city's computers
pull up all you can find on dr young all right in prison

1170
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:50,040
right from birth to serve his dead father's sentence bain
was raised inside the horrific ruins of a Santa Prisca

1171
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:50,520
prison.

1172
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,860
His only friend in the hellhole was a teddy bear named
Osito.

1173
01:19:54,860 --> 01:20:00,680
Finding solace in smuggled books and meditation, he
developed incredible powers of concentration.

1174
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:08,040
When he was subjected to military experience using a steroid
code named Venom, his iron forge will helped him survive

1175
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,200
when other test subjects had died, and he managed to escape.

1176
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:16,240
Determined to prove his worth, he sought out Batman and
broke the Dark Knight's spine.

1177
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:23,100
Like, if he knew that worked, why doesn't he just always try
to break his spine?

1178
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,180
Think about it.

1179
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:33,840
Okay, but if you think about it, like, you know, like, it
put him out of commission for a very long time.

1180
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,720
So, like, it clearly worked.

1181
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,720
So, like, why doesn't he just keep breaking his spine until
he can't walk?

1182
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,580
Rage, thank you for the Akasupa.

1183
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:45,080
Thank you.

1184
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:45,700
Thank you.

1185
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:46,420
Just lurking.

1186
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:46,820
Oh, my God.

1187
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,300
Thank you for your first Akasupa.

1188
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,660
slash super chat.

1189
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:50,660
Thank you.

1190
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,340
Awesome, Corrine.

1191
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:52,720
Welcome.

1192
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,240
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

1193
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:54,560
Thank you.

1194
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,260
Thank you.

1195
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:56,900
Uh, alright.

1196
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,700
But Batman recovered and managed to best Bane.

1197
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,320
But like he never tries to break his spine again.

1198
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:08,720
Cutting off the precious venom supply and transforms Bane
into a superhuman.

1199
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:14,420
He just gave up after the first time went on venom green.

1200
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,940
5 foot 6.

1201
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,380
He's 5 foot 6 without venom?

1202
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,020
Bro!

1203
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:33,320
Master strategist, intense focus, abnormally strong
reactions, determined to best Batman and all the other who's

1204
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,120
challenged him.

1205
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,320
I'll go through anything you find once I get to the cave.

1206
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,780
There's a bad cave here?

1207
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,420
It's best to plan ahead for situations like this.

1208
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,260
How'd you manage to keep this a secret?

1209
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,900
Batman, there's nine nurses and you built a bad cave!

1210
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,740
Did you think Dr. Young's been experimenting animal?

1211
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,480
Yes, I'm worried.

1212
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,000
Bane seemed even more powerful than usual.

1213
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,720
Joker wants the venom, and that can only be trouble.

1214
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,240
I'm heading to Dead Man's Point in Arkham North.

1215
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:03,900
I'll contact you once I'm in a while.

1216
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,300
Bane is a short game.

1217
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,300
CJ, thank you for the super chat.

1218
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:08,560
Thank you, thank you.

1219
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,720
Holy shit, X, thank you for the 50 gifted ships.

1220
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,020
Thank you, thank you.

1221
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,700
Thank you so much.

1222
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,940
Oh my god, that's a lot.

1223
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:22,220
Batman, you could have given them free healthcare.

1224
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,380
That is so true!

1225
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:29,040
I was like, there's like so many things wrong with Batman's
logic.

1226
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:36,220
This, the asylum, this entire island is run by nine nurses.

1227
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,080
Plus like five doctors or some shit.

1228
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,340
And then he built a fucking bat cave.

1229
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:49,360
He was like, what can we do to fix the mental health issues
in Gotham City?

1230
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,120
Let me build another bat cave.

1231
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,500
like beat up the issue.

1232
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,360
Like, I don't understand his logic.

1233
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:06,780
More, yeah, there's more security than there are nurses.

1234
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,140
Oh, shit.

1235
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:08,700
Whoops.

1236
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,480
Okay, you know what?

1237
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,280
Fuck, I can... I need XP anyway.

1238
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,700
Like, it's always nice to have XP.

1239
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:14,480
Oh.

1240
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:15,960
Critical strike.

1241
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,040
Nice.

1242
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:19,880
Oh, my God.

1243
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:21,420
Look at how strong I am now.

1244
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:21,700
Ow.

1245
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,000
Please, I'm pressing Y!

1246
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:35,200
If I keep pressing X, they'll die eventually.

1247
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:38,420
Okay, come on.

1248
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:39,440
Get over here.

1249
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:48,180
If you solve all the problems, there will be no need for
Batman.

1250
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,920
That is actually so fucking dark.

1251
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,540
Like, this is just a fucking...

1252
01:23:54,560 --> 01:24:05,540
ego trip for batman you know like he's just like he's he
does all of this just to feel good about himself like oh wow

1253
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:11,140
not having being a billionaire is just not good enough he
needs more

1254
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,620
my parents died

1255
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:41,920

then how about baby boy then oh that you were shocked to see

1256
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:49,460
not really this is like an asylum feel criminalist i was
hoping he'd fold you up like a piece of paper and let me

1257
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:58,420
stamp you crazy but even i don't get everything i want so
what was he doing here Questions, questions!

1258
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:06,640
Well, I'm assuming because you wanted to research the venom,
right?

1259
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:09,600
If you're researching the venom, then...

1260
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:13,080
Then, like, that's why you brought him here?

1261
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,960
Because of the doctor?

1262
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,560
Alright, here we go.

1263
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,360
It's how you find his work.

1264
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,340
What the fuck is this?

1265
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,600
Turn around.

1266
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,640
Don't walk too late.

1267
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,140
Alright, let's go.

1268
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,500
Where am I?

1269
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,380
I'm still lost.

1270
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:37,420
Oh, shit.

1271
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:37,840
It's okay.

1272
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,420
More XP.

1273
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:39,480
Hello!

1274
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,760
I gotta beat you up for XP.

1275
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:42,800
Let's go.

1276
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,780
Grab the back crowbar!

1277
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,160
Nice.

1278
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,800
Wait, do I actually get XP?

1279
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,400
I can't tell.

1280
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:55,960
Yes, I do.

1281
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:56,720
Nice.

1282
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,260
Easy.

1283
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:11,000
the bat crowbar because someone was like no Batman can't use
regular items he only used items with the word bat in it

1284
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,220
what's stopping him from fucking dubbing this the crowbar
and bat crow get the bat gun

1285
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:33,050
the door is locked alright what the fuck I guess I got to go
all the way backwards oh I have to go oh my gosh I have to

1287
01:26:44,410 --> 01:26:54,870

that's all i don't kill like i rather i feel like giving

1288
01:26:54,870 --> 01:27:00,550
like like a minor like foot injury is like better than brain
damage

1289
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:13,000
I once saved an unfortunate inmate From leaping off into the
rocks below I found a cave entrance Okay, sorry Batman, this

1290
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,500
is more important.

01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:14,120
Upgrades.

1292
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,100
Alright guys, what do I upgrade next Guys?

01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:01,940
Twin batter as because they're cool.

Okay, we're not taking the advice from the guy that just

1307
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:41,760
I'm not smart enough for this.

1308
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:46,560
Alright, up I go.

1309
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:53,630
Okay, not up, clearly.

Nice.

1312
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:59,410
He can use a pro bar Jason where he suffered from PTSD.

1313
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:00,850
He doesn't do a fuck about Jason.

1314
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:07,650
Oh, shit.

1315
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,330
That's a lot of them.

1316
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:08,870
That's okay.

1317
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:09,530
Free XP.

1318
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:10,510
Get over here.

1319
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:13,730
That's fucking right.

1320
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:15,370
God damn it!

1321
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:19,710
I can't believe they would just interrupt me like this.

1322
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:21,350
That's so fucked up.

1323
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:24,130
Alright, nice.

1324
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,590
Don't let him hit you.

1325
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,790
Why did you do that?

1326
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:33,150
How could you let him hit you like that?

1327
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,030
Just dodge, forehead.

1328
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:40,290
Alright, nice.

1329
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:43,010
all right

1330
01:29:47,800 --> 01:30:03,840
nice all right let's see if he actually cared about Jason he
would stop getting orphans to replace that's my hot take if

1331
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,960
he actually cares about them why are they so easily
replaceable

1332
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:25,430
all right let's see seesaw by outer gate where the fuck does
that mean what the fuck where is the other gate

1333
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:46,000
here all cards all id cards are to be shown what is the
other gate here what does outer gate mean North, West.

1334
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,140
Where's North?

1335
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:49,820
There is a North.

1336
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:51,920
Oh!

1337
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,600
I figured it out!

1338
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,080
Where's the seesaw?

1339
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:03,300
Seesaw?

1340
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,480
This is North, right?

1341
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:09,820
Oh, there it is.

1342
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,640
There it is.

1343
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:12,600
I figured it out.

1344
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:14,260
Nice.

1345
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,620
Why is there Tweedle D and Tweedle D?

1346
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:19,760
That's a real criminal?

1347
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,000
That's just Alice in Wonderland.

1348
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,980
Cousins with an uncannily resemblance to each other.

1349
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,760
Deaver and Dumfrey Tweed.

1350
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,560
Why the... I feel so bad for these kids.

1351
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,660
That's when you know their parents did not love them.

1352
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:39,040
Deaver and Dumfrey Tweed both shared criminal leanings in a
fixation on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.

1353
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:46,520
Teaming up, they've modeled themselves after Tweedle Dumb
and and tweedle d from that book planning often outrageous

1354
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:55,660
and absurd schemes that trap the that is their real name wow
1940 yeah that seems like characters made it from 1943

1355
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:03,740
oh yeah the mad hatter yeah i remember the mad hatter i
remember that from teen titans

1356
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:13,800
uh do you know about the hidden room later on the game no
this is my first time playing this game one of my favorite

1357
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:13,960
games.

1358
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:14,180
Thank you.

1359
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:14,440

Thank you again.

1365
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,040
Wait, Jason used his guns?

1366
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,160
The fuck?

1367
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,640
Batman, you clearly have not taught your Robins well.

1368
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,640
Wait, the Mad Hatter wasn't in Teen Titans?

1369
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,340
Where was he in?

1370
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,940
Was this in the Justice League Unlimited?

1371
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:43,380
I swear he was in, like, one of the TV shows.

1372
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:51,160
because I like unless he was unless he was in the comic book
series I actually owned some of the teen titan comics um

1373
01:32:51,160 --> 01:33:00,980
that was based off the that was based off the show I know
like he was from somewhere but I don't remember I remember

1380
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,420
That was when I had my how I met your mother craze.

1381
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:01,840

track of, like, what they're called.

01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:11,560
Oh, there is!

1386
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:14,620
The puzzle.

1387

My family's blood ran through the heart of gotham we were
doctors politicians and teachers we have been the organ

servants giving all to protect it and still it has chosen to

1389
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:44,300
hurt us so you're thinking of the super chat thing thank you
all villains in the game are from the comics except for

1390
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:55,060
holly oh yeah i know harley quinn was invented just for the
animated show yeah i remember that all right apako

1391
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:13,140
let's see i think like the best dc anime show was 100 of
justice league slash justice league unlimited i think

1392
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:20,300
because like i think it aged quite well the writing for that
show aged incredibly well and it was not just for kids but

1393
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:27,160
like adults could watch it too because it tackled like it
tackled like um moments in there that was meant for like

1394
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:35,960
like even adults could understand like actual real moments
like they didn't like pussy out on shit

1395
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:51,000
i will forever i will forever associate the voice like the
voices because like when they like redubbed martian

1396
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:59,520
manhunter i could never i can never like deal with the new
voice actors for Martian Manhunter because the only voices I

1397
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,880
associate with Martian Manhunter was from the Justice
League.

1398
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,320
Nice, I did it.

1399
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:07,200
God, millions.

1400
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,480
Instead of paying taxes, he does this.

1401
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,960
Young Justice was good.

1402
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:22,560
Young Justice was good, but then every time you reboot a
show, it never goes well.

1403
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,620
Because they have to compromise if they're rebooting a show.

1404
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,940
And also it takes like a couple of years for that to happen.

1405
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:35,250
So like the story that they wanted to tell was already like
watered down.

1406
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,420
Except Samurai Jack.

1407
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:42,690
Okay, remember the ending of Samurai Jack then say that
again.

1408
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,740
Dr. Young was heading up a project.

1409
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:56,800
It was big.

1410
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,300
Lots of external funding.

1411
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:00,600
Here are the last note she filed.

1412
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:02,660
I can't make sense of it.

1413
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:03,580
What does it mean?

1414
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,820
Looks like she was experimenting on the Arkham patients.

1415
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:12,040
This new chemical only barely resembles the original venom
compound.

1416
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:16,400
There are a number of changes that appear to amplify the
strength of the drug.

1417
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:19,320
Multiple references to a Titan formula.

1418
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:25,140
Even a small amount could trigger a venom-like
transformation in the host, eliminating the need for the

1419
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,940
storage tank Bane requires.

1420
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:36,060
Hang on these notes aren't complete the formula is missing
that must be the secret dr. Young is hiding if Joker gets

1421
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:43,600
his hands on this He will create an army of a thousand veins
My god is Joker crazy enough to do that?

1422
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:52,920
What kind of yeah, it's gonna be like Barbara what the fuck
are you saying is Joker crazy enough to do bro?

1423
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,080
What

1424
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:02,280
You should never question about Joker's sanity.

1425
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:06,560
Bruce Wade, thank you for the 50 gifted ships.

1426
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,500
Holy fuck, thank you.

1427
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,920
I appreciate it, Bruce Wade.

1428
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:12,700
Instead of helping your city.

1429
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,860
I mean, you know what?

1430
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,460
Fuck it, that's all right.

1431
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:17,420
You don't need to help your city.

1432
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:20,260
Just keep gifting me my precious ships.

1433
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,180
All right, nice.

1434
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:24,580
I upgraded my fucking grapple hook.

1435
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:28,360
I'm going after her.

1436
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:37,240
She was heading to the mansion with cash I'm going up top
Why wouldn't cash have like a fucking Phone Just be like

1437
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:44,100
cash don't do it She's fucking crazy Answer your phone cash
Alright how do I get out of here

1438
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:50,630
Is he crazy enough to do it?

1439
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:53,230
If he asks if somebody If he...

1440
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:54,790
Bri bro she's shot...

1441
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:59,950
Bri bro he literally made you paralyzed And you're asking is
he crazy enough to do this?

1442
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:08,800
All right, so let Batclaw, LT, aim my Batclaw.

1443
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:11,720
But what does the Batclaw do?

1444
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,640
Oh, it just moves boxes.

1445
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:19,700
That's stupid.

1446
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,080
Whoops!

1447
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,480
Sorry.

1448
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:32,220
Oh my god, Batman, these platforms fucking suck.

1449
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:50,020
all right let me okay i didn't realize i had to move all the
boxes oh my god this bat claw cost 100 000 what is its

1450
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:59,740
purpose to remove boxes get it thank you for the super chat
thank you thank you um oh it opens vents too oh thank

1451
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:07,640
fucking god it didn't all right good all right a hundred
thousand dollar backlog so fucking worth and why would you

1452
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:16,200
hurt me reminding me the ending of samurai jack okay what i
hate was that people be like but doki they like they like

1453
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:29,640
fixed it in the game yeah but the game is like mediocre it
wasn't even like the best fucking game ever it was like

1454
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:39,500
super it was like just an average game and not everybody
fucking plays the samurai jack game too so it's like yeah so

1455
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:48,740
people like there was a game so it's like like i understand
why but it's still the game might as well just put that

1456
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:50,480
ending in the actual show

1457
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:20,100
i'd be scared to criticize joker

1458
01:41:31,010 --> 01:41:31,970
I'm right, Jackie.

1459
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:55,730
I feel like that's like one of Joker's many things.

1460
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:57,010
Like, he doesn't kill.

1461
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:58,630
He just does that.

1462
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:05,210
Because, like, the amount of people he just puts people in
wheelchairs is, like, surprisingly a lot.

1463
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:16,230
It's like his like go-to thing where he's like where he
instead of killing he just puts them in wheelchairs Which I

1464
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:20,170
am always pretty fucked up Just like Batman

1465
01:42:26,510 --> 01:42:30,910
Yeah, he does kill but then it's like it's either kill or
wheelchair

1466
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:45,660
Double tap for a weeder one's trying to open it this ain't
even the main door if Oh Wrong one.

1467
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:49,460
Wrong one.

1468
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:50,820
Oh, I'm fucking...

1469
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,920
I chose the wrong one!

1470
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:53,780
Whoa!

1471
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,440
Why is it still not?

1472
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:57,920
Oh, wait.

1473
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:01,600
Sorry, I didn't know my left and right.

1474
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:06,480
Sorry.

1475
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:11,140
I pressed left T instead of right T.

1476
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,420
Sorry.

1477
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,620
I'm still learning my left and right right now.

1478
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:34,280
now that makes much more sense actually no i was about to

01:44:21,850 --> 01:44:28,750
all right really you don't even have like an actual presence
in the game

1485
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:43,420
If Killer Croc can find love, so can you, chat.

1486
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:48,900
Whoa!

1487
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,460

Also, Josh, they give us 10 gifted ships, thank you, thank
you.

1489
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,440
One of Joker's oldest aliases.

1490
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:21,920
So, Joker pays Dr. Young to create his army, and then all of
a sudden he stops.

1491
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,500
Doesn't make any sense.

1492
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,340
Open the door behind me?

1493
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:29,500
behind me?

1494
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,120
Here?

1495
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,500
Is that killer crock?

1496
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,000
Guys, I don't know.

1497
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:36,040
The room where it's, like, glowing.

1498
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:36,820
Oh, so sad.

1499
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:39,580
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1500
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:40,560
I was going to say dokey farm.

1501
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:41,960
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1502
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:42,860
Welcome, welcome.

1503
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:45,220
Also, I didn't manage to read your super chat illegal.

1504
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:48,500
The Joker stalked and terrified dude for cutting him off in
traffic.

1505
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:50,620
That's the next level and hint right there.

1506
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:57,640
What you didn't know is that one journalist started
criticizing him, and then he...

1507
01:45:57,660 --> 01:46:03,480
like told him he's like you know what you're right i don't
have friends you're gonna become my best friend now and then

1508
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:09,760
he like stalked this man for like several years and he
wouldn't let him have any friends after that because he was

1509
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:17,500
like you don't need friends i am your best friend and then
he like killed his roommates and also like hurt his wife and

1510
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:26,320
everything and and then because he was like you don't need
anybody else now I'm your best friend now forever and ever

1511
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:30,830
but yeah anyway I don't know about opening this door

Actually, wait, you're right.

1529
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:33,610
Sounds like she had a change of heart.

1530
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:34,750
She tried to blind her.

1531
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:40,230
the payments joker doesn't like it when his partners try to
back out so he decided to get himself

1532
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:54,820
exactly i just realized the ruler has been like placing
drywall around the place oh my god he's even a handyman well

01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,820
It's on a killer wheelchair.

1551
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:21,180
Like, Joker.

1552
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,560
That's like his whole thing.

1553
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:28,120
It's like, I'm not gonna kill you, but wheelchair.

1554
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:37,450
All right, let's see this way.

1555
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:42,450
The wheelchair kick is crazy.

1556
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:48,770
Guys, I think the Joker has a problem.

1557
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,210
What the fuck?

1558
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:53,830
Oh, you found that one.

1559
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:56,530
Sorry, it wasn't much of a challenge.

1560
01:50:56,890 --> 01:50:58,350
I was running out of time.

1561
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:00,530
Okay, let's see.

1562
01:51:00,990 --> 01:51:02,610
I'll make sure there's nothing here.

1563
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:04,470
Oh, Sonara, thank you for the Akasupa!

1564
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:06,050
Thank you, thank you!

1565
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:07,790
I'm here so I have to be held back.

1566
01:51:07,930 --> 01:51:09,530
Take this red because you're a tomato.

1567
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:11,450
Thank you, thank you for the Akasupa!

1568
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:12,710
Thank you, thank you!

1569
01:51:13,190 --> 01:51:13,950
All right, this way.

1570
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:17,690
There's a lot of wheelchairs in this series.

1571
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:21,110
Oh, nice.

1572
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:22,270
You're saying get over there?

1573
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:25,910
Fuck.

1574
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:26,770
Oh, wait.

1575
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:28,430
Uh.

1576
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:30,430
Wait, what the fuck?

1577
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:31,510
How do I get over there?

1578
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:34,990
Okay, let's get back here.

1579
01:51:35,290 --> 01:51:40,190
I'm glad I could, like, not have to worry about losing,
going back from the beginning.

1580
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:42,110
Oh, not yet?

1581
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:44,470
Use the back claw?

1582
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:47,830
I feel like the back claw is not the right way.

1583
01:51:48,730 --> 01:51:50,750
Is it actually the back claw?

1584
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:52,150
Can I pull this?

1585
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:55,630
What's the point if I can't pull this?

1586
01:51:56,650 --> 01:52:08,290
What if I just pull this while down need line launcher oh i

1608
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:52,730
nope i will never go the right way apparently if i keep
running There's no way a bullet is fat.

1609
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:53,910
You know I'm going to beat up the sniper.

1610
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:55,410
Actually, fuck this.

1611
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:56,990
I'm going to beat up the sniper.

1612
01:56:57,630 --> 01:56:58,210
Do I have stamina?

1613
01:56:58,630 --> 01:56:59,070
I forgot.

1614
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:02,610
No, this is not a modern game anymore.

1615
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:03,790
Get over here.

1616
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:05,570
Get the fuck over here.

1617
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:06,170
I forgot.

1618
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:09,590
Stam- Oh, shit.

1619
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:11,050
My punch is so strong.

1620
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:15,270
The sheer velocity of my punch fucking hit him.

1621
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:17,530
I forgot.

1622
01:57:18,050 --> 01:57:20,370
This game came out like 14 years ago.

1623
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:23,750
So stamina wasn't invented back then.

1624
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:30,910
Alright, how do I get there?

1625
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:33,810
I think that's like the best part.

1626
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:36,730
Like, oh shit, nice.

1627
01:57:39,550 --> 01:57:41,070
The good old days.

1628
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:46,230
Where people were just so good at running.

1629
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:50,270
Legacy of this island has been well and truly buried.

1630
01:57:51,910 --> 01:57:52,450
No?

1631
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:52,870
Okay.

1632
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,750
Oh, shit!

1633
01:57:55,630 --> 01:57:56,170
Whoops.

1634
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:58,150
Alright.

1635
01:57:58,530 --> 01:57:59,810
Don't worry, I got it.

1636
01:58:00,590 --> 01:58:01,310
No, this.

1637
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:04,450
That's fucking right.

1638
01:58:05,090 --> 01:58:06,170
The good old days.

1639
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:14,350
Like, I understand they want things to be realistic, but,
like, also, like, I play video games not for the realism.

1640
01:58:16,370 --> 01:58:19,630
I play video games to escape reality.

1641
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:31,270
want to have no fucking stamina I want no stamina it's 14
years ago games were actually made to be good I feel like

1642
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:40,310
now games are just made to be like realistic but it's like I
don't want things to be realistic they give us a super chat

1643
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:42,990

1648
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,740

02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:35,400
Fucking punch.

1652
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,280

1653
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:39,800

Alright, nice.

What's over here?

1658
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:50,200
Is this also a hack or can I just bat around this?

1659
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:54,430
Can I?

1660
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:55,450
Oh, I...

1661
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:55,970

Boom.

1663
02:00:57,370 --> 02:00:57,950
No, I can't.

1664
02:00:58,030 --> 02:00:58,510
I have the hack.

1665
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:01,470
Bro, fuck these snipers.

1666
02:01:02,370 --> 02:01:03,610
Status deceased.

1667
02:01:05,950 --> 02:01:06,830
Oh wait, recording.

1668
02:01:09,150 --> 02:01:09,210
I don't

1669
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:20,940
think this is a persona.

1670
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,360
Bro,

1671
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:42,060

Bro!

1673
02:01:52,720 --> 02:02:03,540
The Joker Riz I don't know I feel like I think like I don't
think you would want to have Joker be infatuated with you

1674
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:12,520
Because like he would do Some crazy shit just to have your
attention I would have Joker Not be aware of my existence

1675
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:34,890
Wee Or you know Just don't live in Gotham I feel like of all
the criminals like gotham city has all the worst ones like

1676
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:45,390
not gonna lie oh yes your friend's gonna die here like um
every single criminal definitely like batman's handling the

1677
02:02:45,390 --> 02:02:46,570
worst ones

1678
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:53,160
all right nice easy

1679
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:01,140
just don't fucking live in gotham Like,

1680
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:19,240
okay, so, like, I feel like, um, out of, like, all the,
like, most well-known, like, DC villains, majority of, like,

1681
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:22,760
the most famous DC villains all live in fucking Gotham City.

1682
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:36,000
Like, the Penguin, Bane, Joker, uh, Scarecrow, uh, Mr.
Freeze, um, all right, now think about the Flash villains.

1683
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:37,580
Reverse Flash.

1684
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:40,920
It was me.

1685
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:42,200
I did it, Barry.

1686
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:43,880
I did all of that.

1687
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:44,540
All right.

1688
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:46,160
Poison Ivy.

1689
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:47,400
Harley Quinn.

1690
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:48,700
Catwoman.

1691
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:50,300
Grundy.

1692
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:52,020
Two-face.

1693
02:03:56,460 --> 02:03:58,300
All right.

1694
02:03:58,760 --> 02:03:59,360
Superman.

1695
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:00,760
His villains.

1696
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:02,660
Reverse Superman.

1697
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:05,020
Lex Luther.

1698
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:06,160
Who's just like.

1699
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:18,700
the evil billionaire batman but like even then it's like
it's not as bad as like the joker like superman lex loser um

1700
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:32,700
um trucking bizarre yeah bizarreo and he was not even that
bad and then what was it i guess like general zod yeah and

1701
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:43,200
then dark side but then like okay of like the Thanos of DC
but even then he just shows up like once every fucking five

1702
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:49,420
years Joker is every day

1703
02:04:54,430 --> 02:05:06,430
anyway I'm saying is that I don't know maybe we should stop
living maybe Batman is outrageously terrible at his job if

1704
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:12,190
like 80% of the most well-known villains live in Gotham City
Who it

1705
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:16,770
is?

1706
02:05:16,990 --> 02:05:17,570
And me.

1707
02:05:17,990 --> 02:05:19,650
Yeah, big bad Batman.

1708
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:20,710
Come on, tough guy.

1709
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:22,050
Come and get us.

1710
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:23,690
Oh, look at him.

1711
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:25,070
Stuck out there.

1712
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:27,970
Ain't you got a cat to rescue from a tree or something?

1713
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:29,530
That's right.

1714
02:05:29,870 --> 02:05:30,650
Go on.

1715
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:31,510
Get lost.

1716
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:32,450
We're in control.

1717
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:34,410
Joker will finish you off.

1718
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:37,790
Bam.

1719
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:38,630
Oh, shit.

1720
02:05:39,410 --> 02:05:39,750
All right.

1721
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:41,830
There has to be, like, a place to grapple, right?

1722
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:45,230
I don't even say Metro City is a...

1723
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:46,590
a bad idea.

1724
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:47,750
Wait, what?

1725
02:05:47,830 --> 02:05:49,750
I guess we have to, like, go up?

1726
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:03,170
Anton, thank you, the super chat.

1727
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:03,450
Thank you.

1728
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:04,070
Thank you.

1729
02:06:04,110 --> 02:06:04,790
Padoki forgot.

1730
02:06:04,950 --> 02:06:05,510
Captain Code.

1731
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:08,610
A man who best splashed with a handheld refrigerator.

1732
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:11,770
I feel like it has to be... Oh, there it is.

1733
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:12,250
I see it.

1734
02:06:13,450 --> 02:06:14,330
Is that a vent?

1735
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:17,270
Alright, no, I have to go back.

1736
02:06:17,350 --> 02:06:18,390
Use detective mode.

1737
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:19,690
Wait, that's a vent, right?

1738
02:06:21,670 --> 02:06:22,290
Oh, shit.

1739
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:29,100
Clayface is also Gotham City!

1740
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:31,520
You're just making me more right!

1741
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:42,720
Alright, nice.

1742
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:44,260
I'm here now.

1743
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:48,900
Nice.

1744
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:50,680
Door open.

1745
02:06:58,180 --> 02:06:59,620
He just walked away.

1746
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:02,080
He caved between his legs.

1747
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,140
They tried to come through and take him on.

1748
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:05,380
He wouldn't stand a chance.

1749
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:07,180
Yeah, yeah, me too.

1750
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,120
I'd rip his head off and give it to Joker for a paperweight.

1751
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:12,500
Always sucking up to the boss.

1752
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:14,240
What's that supposed to mean?

1753
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:15,740
You heard me.

1754
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:20,080
Okay, we have to kick the one with the gun.

1755
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:21,760
Wee!

1756
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:25,380
Oh my god!

1757
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:29,020
It's like it came from a mile away.

1758
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:30,300
There you go.

1759
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:31,500
Nice.

1760
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:33,360
Countered.

1761
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:34,500
That's fucking right.

1762
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:37,260
Hospital bills!

1763
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:44,880
I guess I was like, but what about Cyborg Superman?

1764
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:47,140
Who knew about Cyborg Superman?

1765
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:47,900
Here.

1766
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:52,260
More people know who the fuck the Riddler is.

1767
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,560
The fucking Cyborg Superman.

1768
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:57,400
Who the fuck is Cyborg Superman?

1769
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:01,700
That was the first time I even heard about Cyborg Superman.

1770
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:11,510
all right i had to tab out because my my chat died me

1771
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:28,190
all right let's see okay dr young okay it has to be like
here let's see if there's anything i have to find out i

1772
02:08:28,190 --> 02:08:35,380
remember correctly the reason why that gothams criminals
always got out of was due to this warden, Hugo Strange, who

1773
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:38,040
purposely let them loose to study Batman.

1774
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:40,420
And this is also Batman's problem.

1775
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:44,640
He funded, he fucking funded Arkham Asylum.

1776
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:49,160
So like, isn't that his fault?

1777
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:52,180
For like, hiring practices?

1778
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,320
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

1779
02:08:56,660 --> 02:08:56,840
Thank you.

1780
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:57,640
Thank you.

1781
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:00,680
That trophy was a test.

1782
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:01,880
Well done.

1783
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:08,000
Like, they could literally just have like an inspection to
make sure there's no corruption because like wouldn't Batman

1784
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:16,600
be like that's weird why are the criminals keep escaping
almost every day surely the justice system isn't corrupt

1785
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:25,280
because of that maybe it's just very unlucky that they keep
fucking escaping Arkham Asylum like at World's Greatest

1786
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:26,920
Detective my fucking ass

1787
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:44,110
Claire 20 gifted chests they could thank you damn that's
fucking crazy that people keep escaping

1792
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:49,000
there was like i remember there was like in the comic where
superman kills the joker and then batman was like i think

1793
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:56,960

my favorite scenes because batman's just like because he's

1794
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:08,840
like you can do that slowly filled with pain and suffering
the effects were felt everywhere my father fell first

1795
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:21,380
infected by some foul disease my mother lived on but only in
a dream i returned to the family home to care for her where

1796
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:31,540

breathe her tears is this mr freeze at night no no because

1797
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:38,300
it's a scarab because like it feels like you know like the
body thing but then like i'm not sure because it's a scarab

1798
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:45,120
uh but yeah no if you guys didn't know that that like yeah
injustice like superman it's like where like basically it's

1799

1831
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:28,800

02:13:31,540 --> 02:13:32,140

It's in the side hall.

02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:27,320
What the fuck is a side hall?

1908
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:33,130
What the fuck is the side hall?

1909
02:18:34,190 --> 02:18:35,370

02:18:39,990 --> 02:18:41,570
I'm just gonna grab these teeth.

1912
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:45,070
It's a hall on the side.

02:18:55,630 --> 02:18:56,750
Can I just open this door?

1917
02:18:57,270 --> 02:18:57,790
That's it?

1918
02:18:57,970 --> 02:18:59,130
It's just for the teeth?

1919
02:19:00,530 --> 02:19:01,210
Let's see.

1920
02:19:03,530 --> 02:19:05,550
Where do I go from here?

1921
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:09,470
I can't get through from here.

1922
02:19:10,390 --> 02:19:12,490
Because all the areas locked.

1923
02:19:14,310 --> 02:19:14,690
Huh.

1924
02:19:15,450 --> 02:19:15,970

Where the fuck do I go?

02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:27,480
Straight ahead to the left?

1927
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:29,620
Wait, okay, what's the map?

1928
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:30,980
Oh, there's a door!

1929
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:32,780
Wait, there's a door right here.

1930
02:19:35,020 --> 02:19:36,340
I can open doors.

1931
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:37,500
Oh, there it is!

1932
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:38,460
The side hall!

1933
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:43,380
Arrest recognition award for your outstanding contribution.

1934
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:47,060
Well, to be fair, if they keep getting out, you can always
keep arresting.

1935
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:49,220
Like, if you think about it.

1936
02:19:57,580 --> 02:19:59,240
Oh my god we found it.

1937
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:00,680
It was the hall on the side.

1938
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:03,340
What does a bird need in the rain?

1939
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:04,880
Okay.

1940
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:06,600

1941
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:13,740
Let me make sure that... Alright there is one person here.

1942
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:16,120
An umbrella.

1943
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:20,340
I mean everybody needs an umbrella.

1944
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:21,780
Why is it just a bird?

1945
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:23,440
Boop.

1946
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:26,380
Destroyed five Joker teeth.

1947
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:28,080

1948
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:32,160
Aim and throw well-being scene when you're in the corner
cover.

1949
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:34,100

He's not going to pick up the gun.

1961
02:21:26,650 --> 02:21:28,490
He's not smart enough for that.

1962
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:32,410
He's not smart enough.

1963
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:35,250
It was so close.

1964
02:21:35,570 --> 02:21:36,770

1973
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:29,340
in both metropolis and keystone i was exposed to a wealth of
new ideas I began my day, returning home and good spirits.

1974
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,320
Eager to see my wife and family.

1975
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,320
I ended it kneeling in their blood.

1976
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:40,420
Yeah, I was going to say, the most, whenever they're like,
I'm eager to see my family, they're never alive.

1977
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:42,560
Poor guy.

1978
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:43,740
He lost his family.

1979
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:47,580
Oh, hey, what's this?

1980
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:49,860
Hoop.

1981
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:52,700
All right, pull that down.

1982
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:54,000
Pull that down.

1983
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:58,160
It's in one of the cases?

1984
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:00,480
Where the fuck is the umbrella?

1985
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:03,100
Is it...

1986
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:03,540
No?

1987
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:06,460
Where is the umbrella?

1988
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:09,700
Okay, that's not an umbrella.

1989
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:12,480
Where the fuck is the umbrella?

1990
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:14,660
Oh, there it is!

1991
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:17,400
Shit, that's a lot of umbrellas.

1992
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:18,880
Nice.

1993
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:21,420
Riddlesong.

1994
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:24,200
The penguin.

1995
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:26,000
One of Batman's oldest four.

1996
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:33,080
is an eccentric criminal mastermind known as much for his
love of ornithology and trick umbrellas as for shady

1997
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:34,160
business dealings.

1998
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:41,600
Gothen's popular iceberg lounge serves as cobble pot's front
for a number of illegal financial activities that fund much

1999
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:42,760
of the city's underworld.

2000
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:49,800
Despite his short stature, Penguin is a wildly foe whose
umbrellas conceal a variety of deadly weapons and gadgets.

2001
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:52,400
All as well, Chesterfield cobble pot.

2002
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:57,380
I like how this one's not a professional Like a restaurant
owner.

2003
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:02,120
No big deal.

2004
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:03,540
He's just...

2005
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:04,400
Okay, that is...

2006
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:07,020
There's no way he's 5 foot 2.

2007
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:09,060
I'm 5 foot 2.

2008
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:10,860
There's no fucking...

2009
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:12,600
He's lying about his height.

2010
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:14,580
There's no way.

2011
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:18,160
Because if Batman is 6 feet...

2012
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:19,040
You think about it.

2013
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:19,840
Okay, Bruce Wayne.

2014
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:20,700
Where is Bruce Wayne?

2015
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:23,140
Where the fuck is Bruce Wayne?

2016
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:38,880
There's no fucking way Bruce Wayne is 6 foot 2 Okay, if you
imagine 5 foot 2 Like, it's not like Okay Oh, it counts the

2017
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:39,600
top hat?

2018
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:49,040
Okay That makes more sense now Because I was like, there's
no fucking way This guy is 5 foot 2 When, like, every time

2019
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:55,560
you put him next to the Penguin, like, if you put him next
to the Batman, he's like, he reaches This is like Batman's

2020
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:56,640
crouch or something.

2021
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:58,960
And I'm like, there's no fucking way.

2022
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:02,400
A 5'2 prince will feel like that short.

2023
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:09,820
You guys are like, Doki, that's some sick copium right now.

2024
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:16,820
I refuse to believe that that's a 5'2".

2025
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:21,800
There's no fucking way.

2026
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:24,280
I refuse to believe it.

2027
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:26,160
That's just too sad.

2028
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:28,060
Oh, hey, guys.

2029
02:25:29,180 --> 02:25:31,160
Let me go back outside.

2030
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:34,520
You're toky-go.

2031
02:25:36,860 --> 02:25:38,720
Why is it up here?

2032
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:42,560
I'm like trying to think, okay, I'm just going to beat
people up here.

2033
02:25:42,620 --> 02:25:44,300
Wait, I'm just going to make sure there's no...

2034
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:45,720
Um...

2035
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:48,240
Oh, I have to open the door.

2036
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:49,900
I want to make sure there's no guns.

2037
02:25:50,020 --> 02:25:50,600
No guns?

2038
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:52,280
No guns.

2039
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:52,840
Okay.

2040
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:54,280
Well, I don't really care.

2041
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:56,000
I'm just gonna beat them up.

2042
02:25:56,020 --> 02:25:56,580
Yeah!

2043
02:25:58,680 --> 02:25:59,580
Oh shit.

2044
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:02,360
I really don't care.

2045
02:26:06,260 --> 02:26:06,900
Okay.

2046
02:26:07,620 --> 02:26:09,120
Oh shit, there's so many people!

2047
02:26:11,820 --> 02:26:12,580
It's okay.

2048
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:14,040
I'm good.

2049
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:17,340

Okay, stun.

2052
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:25,060
Nice.

2053
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:30,480
If all else fails, just keep pressing X and sometimes Y.

2054
02:26:32,460 --> 02:26:34,900
Six and black, thank you for the super chat, thank you,
thank you.

2055
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:37,300
Oh no, I made him back up.

2056
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:43,820
Who needs stealth when I can just stealth them with my
fists?

2057
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:50,320
There's hostages here?

2058
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:51,620
Oh shit.

2059
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:57,980
That's clearly not caring about that.

2060
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:01,780
The pirate, thank you for the super chat.

2061
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:03,160
Thank you, thank you.

02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:04,220

2063
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:06,840
Doki comes in penguin size.

2064
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:13,340
The only way I could have made that one easier to find is if
I strapped it to the hood of that ludicrously ostentatious

2065
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:14,520
vehicle of yours.

2066
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:21,620
All right, let's make sure that there's no other criminals
around.

2067
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:32,740
that's what i'm saying that's why i'm like there's no way
there's no way paying on his five foot two he's lying about

2068
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:37,960
his fucking height i'm basically correct

2069
02:27:43,290 --> 02:27:49,610
okay oh i kid i was like i'm gonna cut the chandelier why
don't they cut the chandelier

2070
02:27:55,610 --> 02:27:58,670
Two minutes, and the giggle gas goes boom.

2071
02:27:59,190 --> 02:28:02,250
They're gonna be cheering up those miserable doctors.

2072
02:28:02,370 --> 02:28:03,490
Oh, shit, two minutes.

2073
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:05,490
Wait, does it count?

2074
02:28:07,230 --> 02:28:09,230
Let's try to figure out how to do the chandelier.

2075
02:28:11,730 --> 02:28:12,150
Oh, God.

2076
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:12,990
Oh, God.

2077
02:28:13,170 --> 02:28:14,670
Don't do well under pressure, Joker.

2078
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:17,330
Never do well under pressure.

2079
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:18,690
Oh, God.

2080
02:28:19,150 --> 02:28:19,670
Oh, God.

2081
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:23,510
Oh, God.

2082
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:25,590
Okay, I need to be in detective mode.

2083
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:27,190
I can think better.

2084
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:33,660
I don't even know if it's time yet.

2085
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:35,540
What do I do?

2086
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:37,120
Cutting.

2087
02:28:37,700 --> 02:28:37,900
Cut.

2088
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:42,440
You gotta say.

2089
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:44,340
I'm getting bored already.

2090
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:46,260
Maybe I should just test them out.

2091
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:47,500
Boo.

2092
02:28:48,180 --> 02:28:49,260
What do I do?

2093
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:55,460
Um, what do I do?

2094
02:28:55,620 --> 02:28:56,440
Oh, there it is.

02:28:57,580 --> 02:28:58,100

Oh, wait!

2113
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:24,850
There's no puzzle here.

2114
02:30:25,610 --> 02:30:26,850
Look at the map.

2115
02:30:27,010 --> 02:30:27,210
Oops.

02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:47,030
There's a book in the library.

2121
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:49,830
There is?

2122
02:30:50,730 --> 02:30:52,710

2124
02:30:57,710 --> 02:30:58,590

What's this?

2126
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:06,880
Oh, in the previous room.

2127
02:31:06,940 --> 02:31:08,100
It's okay, I needed this anyway.

2128
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:10,060

02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:18,500
Goodbye.

Okay, where is the door?

02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:35,020

02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:38,380
Why did mom let you have two riddles?

2138
02:31:42,450 --> 02:31:43,870

2139
02:31:45,090 --> 02:31:46,690
There's no book here.

2140
02:31:47,510 --> 02:31:48,570

2148
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:47,060
Wait, it doesn't matter?

2149
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,480

2150
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:54,160

2151
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,380

2155
02:33:36,110 --> 02:33:37,730
There's a dot next to my

2156
02:33:47,050 --> 02:33:59,850
I figured it out It's like I'm standing it this entire time

2159
02:34:08,130 --> 02:34:10,890
Thanks, Joker, for setting me more experience points.

2160
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:12,830
Boom.

2161
02:34:14,290 --> 02:34:14,990
Concussion time.

2162
02:34:16,130 --> 02:34:19,070
World's greatest detective, by the way.

2163
02:34:20,010 --> 02:34:21,070
That's me.

2164
02:34:24,090 --> 02:34:25,710
That's me, guys.

2165
02:34:25,970 --> 02:34:29,990
Do you guys know I am the world's greatest detective?

2166
02:34:32,750 --> 02:34:34,670
I'm just...

2167
02:34:34,690 --> 02:34:37,770
Where do I go now?

2168
02:34:38,090 --> 02:34:39,850
Because, like, this door is still locked.

2169
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:43,730
Biggest brain moment.

2170
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:47,310
Go back to the library?

2171
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:49,030
Where's the library?

2172
02:34:53,170 --> 02:34:53,970
Did I go back?

2173
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:55,810
Did I went the wrong way?

2174
02:34:56,890 --> 02:34:58,670
Please don't tell me they're back already.

2175
02:34:59,790 --> 02:35:01,090
The self-corridor.

2176
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,980
There's another door?

2177
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:08,060
Why did I miss the other door?

2178
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:10,540
Oh wait, because I'm blind.

2179
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:17,000
That's how.

2180
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:19,020
Oh, there is another door right here.

2181
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:21,560
No!

2182
02:35:21,780 --> 02:35:23,360
Stop tagging your signature!

2183
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:28,060
There you go.

2184
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:32,000
God damn it.

2185
02:35:32,240 --> 02:35:33,700
God damn it.

2186
02:35:38,360 --> 02:35:39,260
I'm just gonna make sure.

2187
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:43,500
I'm just gonna make sure I don't miss anything.

2188
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:45,960
Wait, no, I was here.

2189
02:35:48,680 --> 02:35:49,720
Batman was here.

2190
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:52,040
Where's the map?

2191
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:54,960
Where did I not go?

2192
02:35:57,460 --> 02:35:58,780
Chat lied.

2193
02:35:59,220 --> 02:36:00,420
God damn it, chat!

2194
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:01,560
Where do I go?

2195
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:07,680
Oh my god.

2196
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:09,260
God fucking...

2197
02:36:09,260 --> 02:36:10,800
Okay, I guess...

2198
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:11,880
I guess I...

2199
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:12,440
I leave?

2200
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:13,500
I guess...

2201
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:16,700
We're at the top of the tower!

2202
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:19,120
Okay.

2203
02:36:19,540 --> 02:36:21,340
Don't believe our lies.

2204
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:22,900
Back to the main hall.

2205
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:24,960
God fucking damn, I knew it.

2206
02:36:24,980 --> 02:36:26,720
I knew you guys were fucking with me.

2207
02:36:27,140 --> 02:36:27,820
I knew it.

2208
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:36,280
Go to the north corridor.

2209
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:38,920
The main hall.

2210
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:40,160
Where's north?

2211
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:41,700
North is up.

2212
02:36:43,520 --> 02:36:44,380
North is up.

2213
02:36:44,940 --> 02:36:45,640
Is this north?

2214
02:36:48,980 --> 02:36:52,560
Don't believe their troops either, but there's a door.

2215
02:36:56,830 --> 02:36:58,130
Get over here.

2216
02:36:59,390 --> 02:37:00,930
That's fucking right.

2217
02:37:01,730 --> 02:37:02,070
Bam!

2218
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:05,590
Nice.

2219
02:37:07,210 --> 02:37:07,570

2220
02:37:08,770 --> 02:37:09,910
Wait, what?

2221
02:37:10,570 --> 02:37:12,030
What's that collar do?

2222
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:14,010
Why is it making that noise?

2223
02:37:14,770 --> 02:37:17,130
It's the suicide collar, but it sounds weird.

2224
02:37:18,830 --> 02:37:24,990
what they've got some other name but well we just use them
to monitor patients heartbeats if it drops too low the alarm

2225
02:37:24,990 --> 02:37:33,890
goes off and a crash team rushes in we are killed if you
trigger one how do you like them apples bats standing around

2226
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:43,250

them know you're coming Wait, did I kill?

2228
02:37:50,850 --> 02:37:51,370

2233
02:37:59,830 --> 02:38:00,450
Alright.

2234
02:38:00,770 --> 02:38:01,770

Is that...

2237
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:10,450
It was a mistake to listen to you guys when you said remote
battery.

2238
02:38:13,330 --> 02:38:14,130
Oh, wait.

2239
02:38:14,170 --> 02:38:14,850
No upgrades.

2240
02:38:15,010 --> 02:38:15,630
Never mind.

2241
02:38:16,270 --> 02:38:16,930
Never mind.

2242
02:38:17,810 --> 02:38:18,810
I'm saying...

2243
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:22,290
was that the remote batter ad was not helpful.

2244
02:38:27,130 --> 02:38:29,770
It's not because I can't aim.

2245
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:31,550
Alright, I'm just going to let you guys know.

2246
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:34,290
It's not because it was me.

2247
02:38:34,710 --> 02:38:36,410
It's not a me issue, okay?

2248
02:38:36,810 --> 02:38:39,590
It is not a me issue.

2249
02:38:39,850 --> 02:38:41,290
I just want you guys to know that.

2250
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:47,070
It is not a skill issue.

2251
02:38:47,850 --> 02:38:48,390
You know what?

2252
02:38:49,330 --> 02:38:51,150
Is this like a structural weak?

2253
02:38:51,370 --> 02:38:51,990
Oh, wait, look.

2254
02:38:52,530 --> 02:38:53,050
Security.

2255
02:38:53,230 --> 02:38:54,390
Okay, I can't get there yet.

2256
02:38:54,670 --> 02:38:56,230
And I can't do that yet, either.

2257
02:38:58,750 --> 02:39:00,210
I guess I'll open the door.

2258
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:02,630
Oh, that's a lot of...

2259
02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:04,810
That's a lot of guns.

Nice.

2261
02:39:09,210 --> 02:39:09,470

There's no way I could fuck this up, guys.

2272
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:26,310
Bam!

2273
02:40:26,670 --> 02:40:27,630
I told you!

2274
02:40:28,030 --> 02:40:31,230
I told you there was no way I could fuck this up.

2275
02:40:33,930 --> 02:40:35,670
I wonder if he can pick up his gun again.

2276
02:40:37,070 --> 02:40:38,570
I want to know if he can pick up his gun.

2277
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:40,130
Can you pick up his gun?

2278
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:48,780
Okay, let's just go glad kick him.

2279
02:40:49,660 --> 02:40:50,120
Boom.

2280
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:53,400
Okay.

2281
02:40:53,900 --> 02:40:55,500
Making sure you keep quiet.

2282
02:40:56,660 --> 02:40:57,000
Nice.

2283
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:00,980
Oh, shit, he does.

2284
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:03,200
There's no way he does.

2285
02:41:05,540 --> 02:41:06,420
There's no way.

2286
02:41:09,860 --> 02:41:10,720
Okay.

2287
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:22,800
Wait.

2288
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:25,200
Maybe it is good.

2289
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:26,280
Wait.

2290
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:28,660

2291
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:31,700
I didn't realize it was bullying.

2292
02:41:34,820 --> 02:41:37,940
If I knew it was bullying.

2293
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:48,040
Alright, whoever whoever fucking suggested the remote
control battering, you were right.

2294
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:49,640
You were right.

2295
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:51,120

Go Matt or was he just dizzy?

2303
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:06,720
That's fucking right, Joker.

2304
02:43:12,360 --> 02:43:14,980
Yeah, but your crew is just like, criminals.

2305
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:18,060
Like, like the jockeys.

2306
02:43:18,280 --> 02:43:19,480
They're not scientists.

2307
02:43:35,310 --> 02:43:36,290
Never a joke.

2308
02:43:36,310 --> 02:43:40,230
Because I have too much money to stop now.

2309
02:43:42,570 --> 02:43:44,930
This is literally just my hobby.

2310
02:43:46,450 --> 02:43:47,190
Oh hey, teeth.

2311
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:48,750
Nice.

2312
02:43:50,130 --> 02:43:51,330
I only destroyed 10?

2313
02:43:51,470 --> 02:43:53,470
I feel like I destroyed so many.

2314
02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:58,410
Alright, what?

2315
02:43:58,770 --> 02:43:59,350
That's it?

2316
02:43:59,750 --> 02:44:00,190
That's it?

2317
02:44:00,570 --> 02:44:01,110
Where did I go?

2318
02:44:01,890 --> 02:44:03,470
Justin, welcome to Tomato Farm.

2319
02:44:03,610 --> 02:44:04,350
Welcome, welcome.

2320
02:44:06,090 --> 02:44:06,670
Oh hey.

2321
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:28,350
what I feel like this is yeah I was gonna say oh it's him
alright oh he's a crazy guy founded the Elizabeth Arkham

2322
02:44:28,350 --> 02:44:36,370
Asylum for the criminally insane naming it after his oh my
god why would you name that after your mom oh that's why who

2323
02:44:36,370 --> 02:44:43,550
he euthanized as treatment for dementia building it on the
old grounds his family historic mansion on the outskirts of

2324
02:44:43,550 --> 02:44:49,910
Gotham, personally treated its first patient, Martin Mad Dog
Hawkins, but killed the wife and daughter.

2325
02:44:50,170 --> 02:44:56,510
After administering fatal electro-shock treatment to
Hawkins, he lost all grip on insanity and was admitted into

2326
02:44:56,510 --> 02:44:57,690
his own institution.

2327
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:02,520
Oh shit, how tall is he?

2328
02:45:06,700 --> 02:45:10,060
The most important information I need to know.

2329
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:14,500
tall was he.

2330
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:18,840
Alright, nice.

2331
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:21,400
Is it?

2332
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:23,460
This is where I...

2333
02:45:23,460 --> 02:45:24,080
Oh, wait, no.

2334
02:45:24,260 --> 02:45:25,960
This is different.

2335
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:28,920
God, there's so many vents and everything.

2336
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:30,060
Nice.

2337
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:30,980
Riddle me this.

2338
02:45:33,640 --> 02:45:34,140
Go!

2339
02:45:34,220 --> 02:45:35,320
Welcome to the Tameha farm!

2340
02:45:35,460 --> 02:45:36,080
Welcome, welcome!

2341
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:38,740
Alright, down I go.

2342
02:45:42,450 --> 02:45:43,790
Two unarmed.

2343
02:45:44,150 --> 02:45:46,170
You can be the one Oh, there he is.

2344
02:45:46,290 --> 02:45:47,220
I was like, what the fuck?

2345
02:45:49,310 --> 02:45:49,490
Yeah.

2346
02:45:51,950 --> 02:45:52,570
Wham!

2347
02:45:53,830 --> 02:45:54,190
Boop!

2348
02:45:55,090 --> 02:45:55,450
Alright.

2349
02:45:55,850 --> 02:45:56,070
Oh, no.

2350
02:45:56,190 --> 02:45:57,790
Let me make sure he doesn't pick up his gun again.

2351
02:45:58,750 --> 02:45:59,750
That's fucking right.

2352
02:45:59,890 --> 02:46:00,630
Dodge this!

2353
02:46:01,230 --> 02:46:02,330
My fucking fist!

2354
02:46:03,990 --> 02:46:05,810
I have too much money!

2355
02:46:08,110 --> 02:46:08,350
Ow.

2356
02:46:09,730 --> 02:46:11,670
The little fucking...

2357
02:46:11,670 --> 02:46:13,690
The little fucking slap.

2358
02:46:15,430 --> 02:46:15,950
Nice.

2359
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:17,690
It's that easy.

2360
02:46:18,050 --> 02:46:19,410
We're trying to get into that office.

2361
02:46:19,810 --> 02:46:21,610
It looks like they couldn't get through the main door.

2362
02:46:22,330 --> 02:46:23,610
Got to find a different way in.

2363
02:46:23,770 --> 02:46:24,410
Just punch it.

2364
02:46:25,130 --> 02:46:25,770
Oh my god.

2365
02:46:25,930 --> 02:46:26,130
Wait.

2366
02:46:26,550 --> 02:46:26,890
Okay.

2367
02:46:27,250 --> 02:46:32,090
But why can't I just blow it up with my fucking batter
explosion?

2368
02:46:33,650 --> 02:46:36,790
Like, there's no way it only works on drywall.

2369
02:46:38,590 --> 02:46:39,970
That's so fucking stupid.

2370
02:46:41,010 --> 02:46:42,370
Why can't I just blow it up?

2371
02:46:43,570 --> 02:46:44,910
Because it's not...

2372
02:46:44,930 --> 02:46:46,170
That's wrong.

2373
02:46:50,750 --> 02:46:51,270
Fucking weak.

2374
02:46:51,470 --> 02:46:54,970
What's the point of having explosives if they're weak as
fuck?

2375
02:46:56,370 --> 02:46:57,810
I have so much money!

2376
02:46:59,050 --> 02:47:03,290
It's anti- it is anti-tri-walk explosion.

2377
02:47:04,750 --> 02:47:06,050
Scan the body.

2378
02:47:07,070 --> 02:47:07,250
Really?

2379
02:47:10,420 --> 02:47:12,280
Yeah, those bodies don't matter.

2380
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:14,440
Oh, these bodies?

2381
02:47:18,550 --> 02:47:20,330
That's a cold day in hell when this...

2382
02:47:20,330 --> 02:47:21,530
Oh, wait, is that Raul Ghul?

2383
02:47:23,190 --> 02:47:24,050
That's him?

2384
02:47:25,050 --> 02:47:27,230
Lil is known of the early years of the...

2385
02:47:27,230 --> 02:47:31,170
That's your future father-in-law.

2386
02:47:32,330 --> 02:47:34,190
Whose name means the demon's head.

2387
02:47:34,430 --> 02:47:37,630
But it's known that he has lived for many centuries due to
Lazarus' pits.

2388
02:47:38,050 --> 02:47:40,930
Mystical and alchemical bruise that restore his youth.

2389
02:47:41,350 --> 02:47:43,530
A brilliant master of strategy and organization.

2390
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:48,510
Raul Ghul's goal is to save the earth from ecological
devastation.

2391
02:47:48,530 --> 02:47:51,430
by destroying most of his population.

2392
02:47:51,970 --> 02:47:57,590
He recognized Batman as both a worthy foe and a possible
ally.

2393
02:47:58,370 --> 02:48:02,090
Except that Batman cannot escape his dystopian worldview.

2394
02:48:02,790 --> 02:48:06,370
Batman also shares his love-hate relationship with Raz's
daughter.

2395
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:08,930
The beautiful Talia.

2396
02:48:09,510 --> 02:48:15,750
You know, like, I would never understand why Batman is like
ageless, but like his robins grow up.

2397
02:48:16,430 --> 02:48:18,290
I find that like really weird.

2398
02:48:18,530 --> 02:48:28,530
like I understand they don't want him to like age because
then like because he's Batman so they can use him forever

2399
02:48:28,530 --> 02:48:37,710
but like but like all his like adopted sons and daughters
like age with him and then like at one point Dick Grayson is

2400
02:48:37,710 --> 02:48:44,510
now like sort of the same age as Batman if you think about
it because like if he's like 20 is Dick Grayson is like 20

2401
02:48:44,510 --> 02:49:00,330
and 30 then how old is like 60 or something but he's not
like if you think about it that's why i don't understand i

2402
02:49:00,330 --> 02:49:08,130
don't understand what like just don't just don't age but i
guess they're like we need more robins we need more robins

2403
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:14,190
we can't keep having dick as a robin because i don't we hate
calling him dick

2404
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:24,700
he's been in the pit like it's understandable like
superman's age this because he's a fucking alien already

2405
02:49:28,270 --> 02:49:36,230
got to the safe the only question now is who opened it the
doctor sign of forced entry whoever opened it knew the

2406
02:49:36,230 --> 02:49:48,600
combination the surfer richard yeah but he's still everyone
still calls him fucking dick before joker she's taken them

2407
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:58,640
to hide somewhere i need to follow her and find out where
she put them oh scan the mask oh the black mask i know this

2415
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:08,420
Just so you know, the GCPD found one of Joker's bombs
downtown.

2416
02:51:08,940 --> 02:51:11,180
It was...

2417
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:13,920
As I thought, it's just a twisted diversion.

2418
02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:15,860
The real action's on Arkham.

2419
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:17,780
Oh, shit.

2420
02:51:18,740 --> 02:51:20,100
Okay, now I can scan.

2421
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:21,100
No.

2422
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:22,920
Now I can scan.

2423
02:51:23,260 --> 02:51:23,560
Nice.

2424
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:26,320
Yay!

2425
02:51:27,320 --> 02:51:27,700
Whoops.

2426
02:51:30,180 --> 02:51:33,220
Following the suspicious death of this multi-million
parents.

2427
02:51:33,340 --> 02:51:33,760
Oh, my God.

2428
02:51:33,820 --> 02:51:34,540
How many...

2429
02:51:34,540 --> 02:51:35,060
Okay, there's a lot of them.

2430
02:51:35,080 --> 02:51:38,600
millionaires but how many millionaires live in fucking
gotham like

2433
02:51:59,240 --> 02:52:07,820

his ensuing battle with the dark night caused him as the uh

2434
02:52:07,820 --> 02:52:15,760
caused his mask to be burnt into skin remaking him as the
black mask he is now a feared gang leader and one of the

2435
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:25,200

2437
02:52:37,740 --> 02:52:39,340
What was the upgrade you wanted?

2438
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:40,960
Wait, his height!

2439
02:52:41,420 --> 02:52:41,780
Wait!

2440
02:52:42,220 --> 02:52:44,300

02:52:47,780 --> 02:52:49,420
Okay, what do we upgrade for?

2442
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:50,200
Take down?

2443
02:52:50,740 --> 02:52:51,640
Instant take down?

2444
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:52,240
Is this it?

2445
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:54,420
Special combo take down.

2446
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:55,700
It's not available yet.

2447
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:57,820
Unless it's in another one.

2448
02:52:58,400 --> 02:52:59,040
Armor upgrade.

2449
02:52:59,260 --> 02:52:59,460
Nope.

2450
02:52:59,720 --> 02:53:00,520
Better at power.

2451
02:53:01,420 --> 02:53:02,300
Not available.

2452
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:06,060
Where the fuck is the Instant takedown.

2453
02:53:06,780 --> 02:53:07,580
Auto proximity.

2454
02:53:10,300 --> 02:53:11,400
It is?

2455
02:53:13,280 --> 02:53:14,140
Locked in your...

2456
02:53:14,140 --> 02:53:15,020
Oh, is this...

2457
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:16,700
Oh, oh!

2458
02:53:17,420 --> 02:53:18,540
Okay, I didn't see that.

2459
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:20,020
Okay, I didn't...

2460
02:53:20,020 --> 02:53:20,260
Whoops.

2461
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:21,980
B-N-Y.

2462
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:22,960
Alright, nice.

2463
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:25,900
Okay, now I can open doors.

2464
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:27,740
No.

2465
02:53:28,880 --> 02:53:30,400
Okay, apparently not.

2466
02:53:30,460 --> 02:53:31,360
I have to go through.

2467
02:53:32,100 --> 02:53:33,600
Apparently not, guys.

2468
02:53:37,350 --> 02:53:39,570
Where did I come from?

2469
02:53:39,690 --> 02:53:44,450
Oh, it's just like, where am I?

2470
02:53:45,550 --> 02:53:47,550
All right, here we go.

2471
02:53:52,490 --> 02:53:55,950
All right, don't worry, I want to see your faces when I beat
the shit out of you.

2472
02:53:57,170 --> 02:53:57,590
Spam.

2473
02:53:59,390 --> 02:54:00,050
That's all right.

2474
02:54:01,130 --> 02:54:03,370
I love pressing spamming X.

2475
02:54:03,970 --> 02:54:05,310
It's my favorite part.

2476
02:54:06,270 --> 02:54:07,430
That's fucking right.

2477
02:54:08,590 --> 02:54:09,630
can beat me up.

2478
02:54:10,510 --> 02:54:11,790
You're just goons.

2479
02:54:12,370 --> 02:54:13,750
You're not special.

2480
02:54:15,310 --> 02:54:17,090
You don't even have names.

2481
02:54:18,730 --> 02:54:19,630
Get out of here.

2482
02:54:20,630 --> 02:54:23,290
His height will never know.

2483
02:54:26,890 --> 02:54:29,290
We'll never know his height.

2484
02:54:31,330 --> 02:54:33,810
It's gonna be a mystery forever.

2485
02:54:39,240 --> 02:54:40,540
Oh, I forgot this one, T.

2486
02:54:40,740 --> 02:54:42,000
Where's the record's office?

2487
02:54:43,820 --> 02:54:44,880
It's this way?

2488
02:54:47,620 --> 02:54:48,340
The tape?

2489
02:54:49,440 --> 02:54:50,480
Go back!

2490
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:51,920
I missed the tape?

2491
02:54:52,760 --> 02:54:53,600
There was a tape?

2492
02:54:54,500 --> 02:54:56,720
I was too busy beating people up.

2493
02:54:58,160 --> 02:54:59,020
Oh, there it is.

2494
02:55:00,360 --> 02:55:01,880
Patient interview six.

2495
02:55:05,810 --> 02:55:07,350
My sessions have been in.

2496
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:12,090
What do you mean, Stephen?

2497
02:55:12,410 --> 02:55:13,110
How are you today?

2498
02:55:25,890 --> 02:55:27,750
Dr. Murphy is still in therapy.

2499
02:55:27,810 --> 02:55:29,410
I wanted to understand him.

2500
02:55:29,670 --> 02:55:32,130
His personal demons, his fears...

2501
02:55:43,590 --> 02:55:49,290
I feel like Bruce should spend more money on the mental
health situation here.

2502
02:55:50,990 --> 02:55:57,110
Is there like a multiverse where Bruce Wayne actually spends
his money on fixing the mental health issues in Gotham

2503
02:55:57,110 --> 02:56:00,310
rather than beating up mentally ill people?

2504
02:56:03,450 --> 02:56:06,450
How do you think about it?

2505
02:56:07,050 --> 02:56:07,050
Like,

2506
02:56:12,950 --> 02:56:23,650
I just realized, would it be better to fund research on,
like, like, I mean, I feel like you didn't try that hard.

2507
02:56:23,850 --> 02:56:29,490
I feel like, I feel like beating up, beating up people is,
like, sort of, like, the last resort.

2508
02:56:32,730 --> 02:56:41,050
I feel like I don't know it doesn't feel like he tried all
that hard to fix the issue

2509
02:56:48,250 --> 02:56:54,730
chill thank you for the super chat thank you thank you you
raise more money for mental health in 24 hours and Bruce

2510
02:56:54,730 --> 02:57:04,430

02:57:04,570 --> 02:57:05,670
but thank you, thank you.

2512
02:57:06,050 --> 02:57:08,170
Hey, Toge, glad to see you're enjoying this game.

2513
02:57:08,290 --> 02:57:09,510
I used to play it when I was a kid.

2514
02:57:09,850 --> 02:57:13,070
Can't believe how old it looks now compared to when it came
out.

2515
02:57:13,370 --> 02:57:14,310
Thanks for the fun stream.

2516
02:57:14,950 --> 02:57:18,090
I recently lost my Oshi, and these are keeping me alive.

2517
02:57:18,210 --> 02:57:20,170
Thank you for the magenta soup, but thank you.

2518
02:57:21,290 --> 02:57:23,190
I'm glad you've been enjoying it.

2519
02:57:24,610 --> 02:57:25,170
Thank you.

2520
02:57:28,390 --> 02:57:30,450
I thought you guys said go to the library.

2521
02:57:30,630 --> 02:57:31,730
Is this not the library?

2522
02:57:33,790 --> 02:57:35,790
Is this not the fucking library?

2523
02:57:39,250 --> 02:57:41,210
Guys, I think I got baited.

2524
02:57:42,070 --> 02:57:43,910
I think I got baited.

2525
02:57:52,170 --> 02:57:53,210
Find a book.

2526
02:57:53,310 --> 02:57:54,190
Oh, is it book time?

2527
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:55,270
This is it?

2528
02:57:58,350 --> 02:58:00,530
This is not the library, but there's books.

2529
02:58:02,470 --> 02:58:04,010
There's more than one library?

2530
02:58:08,710 --> 02:58:18,570
Guys, there's more than one library why the fuck did we fund
all these libraries for oh there it is okay fingerprints

2531
02:58:18,570 --> 02:58:24,130
fingerprints okay i found the fingerprints okay

2532
02:58:28,130 --> 02:58:42,770
and then the trail disappears okay all right Where the fuck
are the prince?

2533
02:58:45,230 --> 02:58:46,690
I followed it.

2534
02:58:47,690 --> 02:58:49,490
I followed all the fingerprints.

2535
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:51,710
The two fingerprints.

2536
02:58:56,500 --> 02:58:59,740
I mean, Harleen Quinzel was a psychiatrist.

2537
02:59:00,420 --> 02:59:01,860
And look where she ended up.

2538
02:59:02,380 --> 02:59:03,280
The chunky.

2539
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:03,520
Thank you.

2540
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:04,020
The super chat.

2541
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:04,320
Thank you.

2542
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:04,640
Thank you.

2543
02:59:04,900 --> 02:59:05,200
Yes.

2544
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:09,280
But then they got to hire people outside of Gotham City.

2545
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:13,100
Why are we still hiring doctors in Gotham City?

2546
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:16,480
They're clearly not reliable.

2547
02:59:22,110 --> 02:59:24,130
Okay, it's a bottom floor.

2548
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:29,120
Oh, there it is.

2549
02:59:30,320 --> 02:59:32,720
I didn't realize it was, like, super close.

2550
02:59:36,350 --> 02:59:38,710
Oracle, I found Dr. Young's formula.

2551
02:59:38,930 --> 02:59:39,250
Great.

2552
02:59:39,850 --> 02:59:41,190
So does that mean you've stopped Joker?

2553
02:59:41,410 --> 02:59:42,570
You never stopped Joker.

2554
02:59:42,750 --> 02:59:43,270
What do you mean?

2555
02:59:43,470 --> 02:59:44,190
It's never this simple with him.

2556
02:59:44,290 --> 02:59:45,250
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2557
03:00:19,160 --> 03:00:34,020
what rescued dr young from zass in the warden's office wait
is that gas oh not good okay we gotta go back oh that's not

2558
03:00:34,020 --> 03:00:37,080
good well let me leave those two back there

2559
03:00:41,840 --> 03:00:43,680
Sucks to be those...

2560
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:46,520
Oh no, I missed the scarecrow gas.

2561
03:00:49,790 --> 03:00:51,650
It's the scarecrow gas.

2562
03:00:51,950 --> 03:00:52,930
God damn it.

2563
03:00:53,430 --> 03:00:56,370
I still left those two people there, so...

2564
03:00:56,370 --> 03:00:57,730
Sucks to be those two.

2565
03:01:01,510 --> 03:01:04,850
Can't believe you insisted on sitting through that movie
again, Bruce.

2566
03:01:05,010 --> 03:01:06,670
Oh no, it's the crime alley.

2567
03:01:07,350 --> 03:01:08,490
I'm sorry, Daddy.

2568
03:01:11,290 --> 03:01:13,630
He loved it, so Albert will wait.

2569
03:01:14,290 --> 03:01:14,930
Keep up, Bruce.

2570
03:01:16,610 --> 03:01:18,330
All right, time to relive trauma.

2571
03:01:19,030 --> 03:01:20,150
This is where you're... Oh, shit.

2572
03:01:20,670 --> 03:01:20,790
What?

2573
03:01:21,130 --> 03:01:23,270
Wait, it's actually called Crime Alley?

2574
03:01:23,970 --> 03:01:26,390
I thought that was a joke in Teen Titans!

2575
03:01:27,370 --> 03:01:27,790
And like...

2576
03:01:33,170 --> 03:01:33,730
Wait!

2577
03:01:34,690 --> 03:01:35,190
Okay.

2578
03:01:36,170 --> 03:01:38,770
The Wave family is actually stupid as fuck.

2579
03:01:39,290 --> 03:01:41,270
Like, if you are like...

2580
03:01:41,290 --> 03:01:50,110
multi-billionaires you would not go down crime alley like
that's just like that's actually just fucking stupid like i

2581

03:02:30,590 --> 03:02:32,670

2587
03:02:33,870 --> 03:02:35,910
It's true that's Crime Alley.

2588
03:02:40,410 --> 03:02:43,090
Um, Doki, it's Latin.

2589
03:02:47,270 --> 03:02:48,070
Why?

2590
03:02:48,570 --> 03:02:50,950
Crime Alley was supposed to be safe!

2591
03:02:51,450 --> 03:02:52,490
Oh, there's the my bat.

2592
03:02:53,130 --> 03:02:54,130

03:02:55,090 --> 03:02:57,430

03:03:06,610 --> 03:03:07,570

2601
03:03:08,930 --> 03:03:09,570
Shut up.

2602
03:03:09,690 --> 03:03:09,890
No.

2603
03:03:10,390 --> 03:03:12,110
He's eight years old and all alone.

2604
03:03:12,330 --> 03:03:14,430

2605

03:04:50,550 --> 03:04:52,310
The back cloud to create new cover.

2623
03:04:52,390 --> 03:04:53,710
Okay, I didn't realize you could do that.

2624
03:04:53,950 --> 03:04:54,150
Fuck!

2625
03:04:56,350 --> 03:04:57,890
Sorry, I got a little impatient.

2626
03:04:58,490 --> 03:05:00,710
I got- I got a little impatient.

2627
03:05:00,870 --> 03:05:02,890
I thought I could run fast!

2628
03:05:03,590 --> 03:05:04,110
Alright.

2629
03:05:08,050 --> 03:05:09,450
All right, here we go.

2630
03:05:10,450 --> 03:05:10,930
Okay.

2631
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:15,410
All right, now I know...

2632
03:05:15,410 --> 03:05:15,590
Whoa.

2633
03:05:16,990 --> 03:05:17,550
Here we go.

2634
03:05:19,050 --> 03:05:19,710
What did I...

2635
03:05:19,710 --> 03:05:20,790
Okay, okay, I was gonna say.

2636
03:05:21,210 --> 03:05:23,070
I was worried that, like...

2637
03:05:24,270 --> 03:05:24,750
Uh...

2638
03:05:25,530 --> 03:05:29,170
I was worried that, like, me pulling it down will also
trigger him.

2639
03:05:30,710 --> 03:05:32,870
I like all these different mechanics, though.

2640
03:05:33,910 --> 03:05:34,550
Because it's not...

2641
03:05:34,550 --> 03:05:35,930
It's not just one thing.

2642
03:05:36,730 --> 03:05:38,030
All right, run, run, run, run, run.

2643
03:05:38,050 --> 03:05:57,190
run he they were murdered by Joe chill that's just sad well
okay nothing it was nothing oh shit all right I can beat up

2644
03:05:57,190 --> 03:06:08,410
the skeletons sorry okay it's a little funny to see like to
see a skeleton try to sucker punch me it's a little It's a

2645
03:06:08,410 --> 03:06:09,750
little quirky there.

2646
03:06:10,710 --> 03:06:12,210
Yeah, you got a little bit no-chill.

2647
03:06:12,710 --> 03:06:14,090
Also, like, they're billionaires.

2648
03:06:14,190 --> 03:06:18,250
Why are they watching a movie with the public?

2649
03:06:23,850 --> 03:06:26,970
I bet you they have their own home theater.

2650
03:06:29,870 --> 03:06:32,550
Wouldn't they have their own home theater?

2651
03:06:36,780 --> 03:06:37,360
Okay.

2652
03:06:39,900 --> 03:06:42,440
I want to know how this is going to go back and forth.

2653
03:06:47,700 --> 03:06:50,940
Yoki, what if they just want to live a normal human, a
normal life?

2654
03:06:51,580 --> 03:06:53,200
All right, you don't understand.

2655
03:06:53,660 --> 03:07:00,040
They wanted to know what it was like out there, like the
common folk.

2656
03:07:02,680 --> 03:07:04,460
All right, let's see.

2657
03:07:06,620 --> 03:07:09,020
It wasn't a theater, it was like a movie.

2658
03:07:11,460 --> 03:07:12,920
retcon that again.

2659
03:07:16,300 --> 03:07:16,880
Oh, God.

2660
03:07:17,920 --> 03:07:18,360
Oh, God.

2661
03:07:19,240 --> 03:07:19,660
Oh, God.

2662
03:07:19,960 --> 03:07:20,180
No!

2663
03:07:20,380 --> 03:07:20,960
No!

2664
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:22,920
I jumped the wrong way!

2665
03:07:23,620 --> 03:07:24,980
It was the opera?

2666
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:27,180
I thought it was movie theater.

2667
03:07:28,180 --> 03:07:31,460
And at the end of fear, oblivion.

2668
03:07:32,480 --> 03:07:36,780
Unless it got retconned, I went the wrong way.

2669
03:07:40,060 --> 03:07:52,420
I swear to god at one point it was a movie yeah it was the
movie okay they reconned it so many times that it stopped

2670
03:07:52,420 --> 03:08:01,040

industry is like dying because they keep they recon like oh

2694
03:10:26,150 --> 03:10:26,310
Nice.

2695
03:10:27,670 --> 03:10:30,070

2697
03:10:53,920 --> 03:10:54,200
No?

2698
03:10:59,340 --> 03:11:01,920
Zaz has Dr. Young trapped in the warden's office.

2699
03:11:02,300 --> 03:11:03,200
I've got to get out of here.

2700
03:11:03,360 --> 03:11:04,440
How do I get out of here?

2701

Okay.

2705
03:11:13,840 --> 03:11:17,220

thick rope.

2706
03:11:21,910 --> 03:11:22,130
Yay!

2707
03:11:23,370 --> 03:11:25,230

2746
03:13:47,570 --> 03:13:48,030
Boop.

2747
03:13:48,970 --> 03:13:52,330
Not the ears, but what about all the wheelchairs?

2748
03:13:58,290 --> 03:14:01,970
Joker, that is a waste of a perfectly good wheelchair.

2749
03:14:04,270 --> 03:14:06,170
Cerberus, welcome to the tomato farm.

2750
03:14:06,510 --> 03:14:07,050
Welcome, welcome.

2751
03:14:07,690 --> 03:14:08,810
Is that everything?

2753
03:14:18,110 --> 03:14:20,790
I felt like there would be like an actual like...

2754
03:14:20,930 --> 03:14:21,650
trophy here.

2755
03:14:22,270 --> 03:14:23,970
Seros, thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

2756
03:14:24,210 --> 03:14:24,390
Thank you.

2757
03:14:24,430 --> 03:14:25,150
Thank you.

2758
03:14:28,250 --> 03:14:28,710
What the fuck?

2759
03:14:28,770 --> 03:14:30,070
What's the point of going in here?

2760
03:14:30,630 --> 03:14:31,470
There's no trophy?

2761
03:14:32,370 --> 03:14:33,310
I feel scammed.

2762
03:14:34,950 --> 03:14:36,430
I can't believe there was no trophy.

2763
03:14:39,390 --> 03:14:39,830
Hello?

2764
03:14:43,790 --> 03:14:45,470
What the fuck is this guy?

2765
03:14:45,590 --> 03:14:46,130
Is that Zaz?

2766
03:14:47,850 --> 03:14:49,150
No way, I'm coming over.

2767
03:14:50,930 --> 03:14:51,690
Oh, shig.

2768
03:14:51,830 --> 03:14:53,170
Now that was unexpected.

2769
03:14:59,190 --> 03:15:04,050
I'm sorry, I want the trophy was right there!

2770
03:15:09,130 --> 03:15:10,450
But the trophy!

2771
03:15:11,590 --> 03:15:13,530
No, you don't understand!

2772
03:15:13,970 --> 03:15:15,990
The trophy was right there!

2773
03:15:16,510 --> 03:15:18,010
Listen to me carefully.

2774
03:15:20,930 --> 03:15:22,790
I'm coming over.

2775
03:15:23,070 --> 03:15:24,710
Come any closer.

2776
03:15:26,590 --> 03:15:27,070
No!

2777
03:15:32,410 --> 03:15:34,610
I crouched at everything!

2778
03:15:39,230 --> 03:15:43,150
I don't understand.

2779
03:15:43,690 --> 03:15:44,890
I even crouched.

2780
03:15:46,310 --> 03:15:47,970
Listen to me carefully.

2781
03:15:50,930 --> 03:15:52,770
I guess I'll help.

2782
03:15:52,950 --> 03:15:53,990
I'm any closer.

2783
03:15:54,590 --> 03:15:57,430
And I'll paint the room crimson with her blood.

2784
03:15:59,770 --> 03:16:00,010
Weeer.

2785
03:16:00,910 --> 03:16:03,230
I know you're still out there.

2786
03:16:03,230 --> 03:16:03,510
Weeer.

2787
03:16:06,770 --> 03:16:08,110
I'm sorry.

2788
03:16:08,310 --> 03:16:09,970
The trophy was so disdain.

2789
03:16:10,470 --> 03:16:11,590
Give me my trophy.

2790
03:16:15,150 --> 03:16:16,670
He's not going anywhere.

2791
03:16:17,470 --> 03:16:18,570
You can stop now.

2792
03:16:18,970 --> 03:16:19,350
Sorry.

2793
03:16:20,930 --> 03:16:21,730
I'm so sorry.

2794
03:16:22,430 --> 03:16:23,810
I saw Bane.

2795
03:16:24,610 --> 03:16:24,850
I know.

2796
03:16:25,370 --> 03:16:27,030
I-Joker threatened me.

2797
03:16:27,310 --> 03:16:29,390
I wanted to stop the experiment.

2798
03:16:30,030 --> 03:16:31,890
I tried to give him his money back.

2799
03:16:32,130 --> 03:16:37,210
You don't just give back money from- Yeah, you don't just
give back money from- He doesn't give a fuck about money!

2800
03:16:38,010 --> 03:16:40,010
You think he cares about money?

2801
03:16:40,430 --> 03:16:43,330
So now he has venom and your formula.

2802
03:16:43,710 --> 03:16:44,590
God, I hate his ears.

2803
03:16:44,690 --> 03:16:46,530
I want to, like, just cut his ears off.

2804
03:16:47,650 --> 03:16:48,490
Hidden in the gardens.

2805
03:16:48,870 --> 03:16:50,910
It's locked off, but the security key comes.

2806

03:19:19,400 --> 03:19:21,680
Sorry, I didn't notice that was actually here.

2826
03:19:28,690 --> 03:19:28,790
Nice.

2827
03:19:31,830 --> 03:19:32,810
Oh, shit, what's this?

03:19:33,590 --> 03:19:34,450
Are there secrets, map?

2829
03:19:34,710 --> 03:19:35,030
Nice.

2830
03:19:35,250 --> 03:19:38,450
So, you have given in and taken my map.

2831
03:19:38,870 --> 03:19:40,530
I hope it proves useful.

2832
03:19:41,790 --> 03:19:43,210
Are there there's a secret room?

2833
03:19:45,090 --> 03:19:45,770
She was...

2834
03:19:45,790 --> 03:20:05,550
not bomb proof there's no fucking way okay there is a really
trophy here scan surface in room which surface which surface

2835
03:20:05,550 --> 03:20:17,230
oh hey there's the the ventriloquist isn't the warden too
old for a puppet show wait that's scar yeah the the scar

2836
03:20:17,230 --> 03:20:27,370
face and the ventriloquist Gothen's Blackgate penitentiary
once had a gallows tree from which 313 criminals with death

2837
03:20:27,370 --> 03:20:28,510
sentences were hanged.

2838
03:20:28,690 --> 03:20:32,270
The wood from the pup, the tree, was widowed by an inmate
into the puppet's scarface.

2839
03:20:32,850 --> 03:20:39,250
And that inmate was once his height and was murdered by
Arnold Wesker, a man who would soon fall under Scarface

2840
03:20:39,250 --> 03:20:39,890
influence.

2841
03:20:40,390 --> 03:20:46,210
While most believe that Scarface is simply a tool through
which Wesker, as the criminal mastermind, the ventriloquist,

2842
03:20:47,130 --> 03:20:52,470
acts out a dark side to his personality, Wesley himself
believes that Scarface is possessed by the souls who died

2843
03:20:52,470 --> 03:20:59,710
beneath the gallows tree and the puppet actually motivates
him to commit the duo's many crimes I hear like Scarface is

2844
03:20:59,710 --> 03:21:11,450
now like under like a woman is now the new ventriloquist
because the original ventriloquist fucking died So where is

2845
03:21:11,450 --> 03:21:13,830
the secret you guys said there's a secret

2846
03:21:20,260 --> 03:21:21,760
It's in the walls.

2847
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:27,980
It's in the walls, don't you?

2848
03:21:28,300 --> 03:21:29,680
It's in the walls.

2849
03:21:31,080 --> 03:21:32,020
That wall.

2850
03:21:32,640 --> 03:21:33,620
Thank you, guys.

2851
03:21:34,380 --> 03:21:38,540
I really appreciate the guidance of the walls.

2852
03:21:39,080 --> 03:21:39,460
This wall?

2853
03:21:41,360 --> 03:21:42,520
I'm up against the wall.

2854
03:21:43,040 --> 03:21:44,160
Punch every wall.

2855
03:21:45,200 --> 03:21:48,120
Okay, now I actually don't know if you're fucking with me.

2856
03:21:48,700 --> 03:21:50,240
I cannot...

2857
03:21:50,260 --> 03:21:55,180
tell if you're fucking up left entrance.

2858
03:21:56,080 --> 03:21:58,920
Oh, secret has to use a gel.

2859
03:22:00,240 --> 03:22:00,820
A gel.

2860
03:22:01,100 --> 03:22:03,800
Okay, so but then I don't see it, though.

2861
03:22:04,820 --> 03:22:05,140
Okay.

2862
03:22:06,780 --> 03:22:12,100
That was if I gel everything.

2863
03:22:13,720 --> 03:22:15,880
If I gel everything, eventually.

2864
03:22:18,200 --> 03:22:19,200
Three gels.

2865
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:21,420
Three Here we go.

2866
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:24,900
It was not that wall.

2867
03:22:25,480 --> 03:22:28,320
It was not that wall.

2868
03:22:28,840 --> 03:22:30,440
Right next to this one?

2869
03:22:33,220 --> 03:22:34,540
All will be jail.

2870
03:22:36,640 --> 03:22:38,100
All will be jail.

2871
03:22:40,920 --> 03:22:42,440
All will be jail.

2872
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:45,000
Eventually...

2873
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:46,620
Oh, and the floor, I guess.

2874
03:22:47,540 --> 03:22:48,260
And the floor.

2875
03:22:53,450 --> 03:22:55,510
Oh, three in the same place?

2876
03:22:58,790 --> 03:22:59,710
Look up.

2877
03:22:59,790 --> 03:23:01,350
Why the fuck would I look up?

2878
03:23:03,930 --> 03:23:04,530
Okay.

2879
03:23:05,050 --> 03:23:06,730
It's technically the same place.

2880
03:23:10,290 --> 03:23:10,390
Whoa!

2881
03:23:10,990 --> 03:23:11,750
I did it.

2882
03:23:13,510 --> 03:23:14,010
Oh, Floor.

2883
03:23:14,130 --> 03:23:15,030
What is this?

2884
03:23:18,630 --> 03:23:18,930
What?

2885
03:23:19,910 --> 03:23:20,470
What is that?

2886
03:23:25,210 --> 03:23:26,430
Oh, is this Scarface?

2887
03:23:27,830 --> 03:23:28,430
Like...

2888
03:23:31,110 --> 03:23:31,990
Secret tunnel.

2889
03:23:33,910 --> 03:23:35,030
Look at the blueprint.

2890
03:23:36,750 --> 03:23:37,250
This one?

2891
03:23:42,720 --> 03:23:43,320
This blueprint?

2892
03:23:45,960 --> 03:23:47,340
What blueprint do I...

2893
03:23:47,340 --> 03:23:48,220
Was this Arkham City?

2894
03:23:48,320 --> 03:23:49,660
Oh, is this like...

2895
03:23:49,660 --> 03:23:49,860
Oh!

2896
03:23:51,620 --> 03:23:53,260
Oh, is this like a...

2897
03:23:53,260 --> 03:23:54,300
Oh, zoom in?

2898
03:23:55,260 --> 03:23:58,600
Yeah, is this... I was going to say, is this like a plan
for...

2899
03:24:03,460 --> 03:24:03,900
No?

2900
03:24:08,970 --> 03:24:10,150
Not letting me zoom.

2901
03:24:14,320 --> 03:24:16,220
This is a plan for the sequel, right?

2902
03:24:18,920 --> 03:24:20,060
Oh, that's cool.

2903
03:24:21,160 --> 03:24:22,660
It was like a sequel bait.

2904
03:24:24,980 --> 03:24:27,720
Well, I already know Arkham City was next.

2905
03:24:34,240 --> 03:24:36,340
It just makes me think that...

2906
03:24:36,340 --> 03:24:38,500
Because, like, back then, I feel like 10 years ago...

2907
03:24:38,500 --> 03:24:39,420
Or 14 years ago.

2908
03:24:39,520 --> 03:24:43,440
People don't really like, what was it, data mine stuff back
then?

2909
03:24:43,580 --> 03:24:44,760
I mean, people did, I feel like.

2910
03:24:44,800 --> 03:24:45,620
Actually, people did.

2911
03:24:45,940 --> 03:24:52,260
But, like, it wasn't as, like, intense as it was in the, it
was, as it is now, I feel like.

2912
03:24:54,060 --> 03:24:56,160
Wait, there must be, like, a cat and mouse here somewhere.

2913
03:24:56,720 --> 03:24:58,500
If it, if it's, like, cat and mouse.

2914
03:24:58,980 --> 03:25:00,260
Yeah, it wasn't as common.

2915
03:25:00,720 --> 03:25:06,720
So I feel like someone must have been, like, just fucking
plant, just spraying every fucking wall.

2916
03:25:09,880 --> 03:25:11,500
All right, riddle me this.

2917
03:25:12,760 --> 03:25:13,360
Scan the display.

2918
03:25:13,680 --> 03:25:14,160
This one.

2919
03:25:16,100 --> 03:25:16,800
Which display?

2920
03:25:22,270 --> 03:25:23,110
Bathroom mirror.

2921
03:25:23,310 --> 03:25:23,990
Scan yourself.

2922
03:25:24,150 --> 03:25:24,850
There's a mirror?

2923
03:25:26,630 --> 03:25:28,250
There is no mirror here.

2924
03:25:31,630 --> 03:25:32,910
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

2925
03:25:32,930 --> 03:25:34,310
There is no mirror here.

2926
03:25:34,930 --> 03:25:36,870
I feel like it has to be a display case.

2927
03:25:37,130 --> 03:25:37,630
Is that it?

2928
03:25:38,310 --> 03:25:39,050
Oh, there it is.

2929
03:25:40,530 --> 03:25:40,910
Catwoman.

2930
03:25:41,730 --> 03:25:42,230
Catwoman.

2931
03:25:42,810 --> 03:25:43,270
Riddles.

2932
03:25:43,790 --> 03:25:44,550
A Batman.

2933
03:25:46,830 --> 03:25:49,730
An Orthon who learned to survive on Gotham City Streets.

2934
03:25:50,450 --> 03:25:54,370
Selina Kyle took to thievery to survive, but determined to
do in style.

2935
03:25:54,790 --> 03:26:01,810
She learned martial arts and trained extensively to perfect
her skills at cat burglary.

2936
03:26:02,770 --> 03:26:09,290
Her criminal activities are often tampered with by reluctant
altruism, making her inconstant...

2937
03:26:09,290 --> 03:26:10,690
Oh, he's like an anti-hero.

03:26:11,390 --> 03:26:12,230
Is that the right word?

2939
03:26:12,810 --> 03:26:20,570
uh constant constant villain and occasional hero she
regularly eludes captured by the dark night and retains a

2940
03:26:20,570 --> 03:26:26,970
complicated aversional relationship with batman that
frequently turns flirtatious and occasionally legitimately

2941
03:26:26,970 --> 03:26:34,530
