1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,280
I'm not lying because I thought we were setting things up.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,100
Because Monopoly is one of the most unoptimized games because it's Ubisoft.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,800
Anyway, Ubisoft, if you want to sponsor me, I won't chit-talk Monopoly.

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,640
Anyway...

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,300
Yes, I am.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,180
But like, Monopoly Plus is known to be the most fucked up optimization.

7
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,180
Because this online server fucking sucks.

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,480
So I thought we were setting it up before stream.

9
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,920
Because I don't know how this is going to work.

10
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,360
Credit.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,440
Back me up.

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,840
Is she a professional?

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,680
One time she streamed for me.

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,120
I was like, I'm going to stream from a closet.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,380
That's true!

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,500
And I came out!

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,140
Again!

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,260
See?

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,760
What?

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,340
I don't think being proud about streaming in the closet is a good thing.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,700
No, it is.

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,080
It is.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,800
It's a Harry Potter origin story.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,260
Voldemort came out of my room and he ripped off my nose and I said, wow, you sure need that, buddy.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,320
And then he cursed me and put a scar on my head.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,240
And to this day, I've never been the same.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,280
Oh.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Okay, I need somebody else to back me up.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,660
To back me up on this.

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,080
To like, rein in a Fillion.

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,280
Do we have to make a point out of me?

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,400
Do we have to make a point out of me?

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,700
What is it?

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,340
A murder scene?

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,280
Okay.

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,900
All right.

37
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,900
Okay, Fillion.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,480
Host the game, Fillion!

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,740
I want to talk first!

40
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,640
We have things to go over!

41
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:03,160
We have to figure this out and talk at the same time because at this rate, the whole thing about the game is going to take like one hour of fucking...

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,660
I want to apologize.

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,120
Tech support.

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,980
Let me just apologize to you.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:08,960
Okay.

46
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,860
Okay, so I said a word that I would say and I wanted to tell you, I completely take it back.

47
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,000
That's it.

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,700
That's all I wanted to say.

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,080
Wait, what?

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,580
There was a soft drink that's really popular and I want to apologize for even mentioning it.

51
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,580
I just want to take it back and I'm sorry.

52
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,660
Oh, okay.

53
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,860
Okay.

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,740
Thank you.

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,680
Thank you.

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,720
Okay.

57
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,840
I don't know the lore.

58
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,720
The lore is too deep.

59
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,760
The lore is too deep.

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,820
I got to fucking yell that, bro.

61
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,680
Shoot.

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,320
Fillion?

63
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,060
What?

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,500
No, okay.

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,360
Okay!

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,480
Okay!

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,060
Okay, I'll try and start the game.

68
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,800
What the?

69
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,680
Okay.

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,060
Okay.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,960
Do you want...

72
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,300
Never mind.

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,900
Okay, fine.

74
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,960
I'll start the game, dude.

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,800
God dang it.

76
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,480
Yeah, I just see you on your Twitch stats right now.

77
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,560
I don't see the Monopoly game at all.

78
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,660
Why are you on Twitch?

79
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,600
Stop stalking me!

80
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,140
What do you mean?

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,260
It's because we were like, where is Fillion?

82
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,460
And she's out here be like, the collab starts at three.

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,860
I don't know why these girls are here early.

84
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
What is she doing?

85
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,280
What are they doing?

86
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,440
And then like, me, Lumi, and Pippa were just like, what the fuck?

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,920
And then I have to copy and paste literally a chat message from Fillion and be like, hey, how does like 2.30 sound?

88
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
And Aurel's just like, yeah, 2.30 sounds great.

89
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,060
I think it's our fault that we came at 2.30.

90
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,660
I think it's our fault that we came at 2.30.

91
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,880
What's wrong with you?

92
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Give me a deeper voice.

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,480
Alright?

94
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,240
I'm powerful.

95
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,700
He's like, what are these girls doing coming here like 30 minutes early?

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,020
What the fuck's wrong with them?

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,400
Okay, okay, okay.

98
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,200
What the fuck is wrong with her?

99
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,220
Dude, the last time someone came early, I got conceived.

100
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:51,580
Okay?

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,540
I'm just not used to it.

102
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,100
I'm starting the game.

103
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,600
I'm starting the game.

104
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,240
Okay, so I want to leave my lobby code.

105
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,580
That's the important thing, right?

106
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,500
I don't think there is a lobby code.

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,520
I think it's just invite.

108
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
It's a private lobby with a code.

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,800
I don't know.

110
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,180
I just looked at the hosting.

111
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,940
I know a parent, Pipa, can't host.

112
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,500
Because she has issues.

113
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,420
I mean, not that type of issues, but like...

114
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:14,720
My net.

115
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,660
What do you mean by that, Doki?

116
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,560
What do you mean?

117
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,260
I'm just trying to be specific so people be like, what kind of issues does she have?

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
I'm like, no, I meant tech issues.

119
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,480
I don't mean it.

120
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,280
I don't mean anything else.

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
I think I should be able to host too, maybe?

122
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,680
What am I leaking?

123
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,100
What?

124
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,120
Okay.

125
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,180
Remote play together.

126
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,280
Are we actually doing remote play?

127
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,540
Are we going straight for the remote?

128
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,320
I don't know.

129
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
Someone put a thing in there.

130
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,060
What do you think?

131
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,260
Do we do it now?

132
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,660
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

133
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,240
That's what I said yesterday!

134
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,900
I said this yesterday!

135
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm learning!

136
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,600
I was like, don't worry, we can do it online!

137
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,820
And now you're reading this?

138
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:13,440
I was like, hey guys, people in my chat yesterday were talking about we should do the remote play.

139
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm all monopoly right now, Kitten.

140
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,700
Give me one sec.

141
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,060
Okay.

142
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,420
One person buys the game, the person who bought the game launches it and sends a request for a remote play.

143
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,240
So we should all be Steam friends.

144
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,540
Okay.

145
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,380
Yeah, I invited...

146
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,480
I added everybody on Steam.

147
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,760
W's in the chat.

148
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,020
Okay.

149
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,300
So I play Monopoly?

150
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,820
Do I go local mode?

151
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,040
Well, what did that person say?

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,380
It says remote.

153
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,780
Well, I guess it has to be local mode if it's remote play.

154
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,980
Yeah, create a local game, not online.

155
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,580
Exactly.

156
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,540
You're so right.

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
We don't want to try the online at all.

158
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,920
Oh no, we're just going to crash later on.

159
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,960
Because like, most likely...

160
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,900
Like when you crash, they sell off all your property and stuff to everybody else.

161
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:58,940
What?!

162
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,880
Yeah, so like...

163
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,120
Then we just have to not buy it from the AI.

164
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,660
It's fine.

165
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,260
Just don't leave my junk to the AI.

166
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,640
It's fine.

167
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,940
Okay, so how do I invite you guys to Steam?

168
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,400
There should be a remote play together button.

169
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:14,980
Oooh.

170
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,820
Like in the actual game?

171
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,440
In the Steam friends list.

172
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,840
Oh, in the Steam friends list.

173
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,360
Okay, perfect.

174
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,560
Don't worry, I'll go online just for you guys.

175
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,780
Yes, please, please, please.

176
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,180
So...

177
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,620
Okay.

178
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,860
So I don't know if I'm friends with Doki.

179
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,600
That's important.

180
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,380
Wait, do we not do a game?

181
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,620
Oh, we didn't do a game.

182
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
Yeah, we played VRChat.

183
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,700
It was really different.

184
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,200
Or wait, no, we didn't play VRChat.

185
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,800
You were just there.

186
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,660
I was just there.

187
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,660
Like, you just showed up.

188
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,420
I was like, hey, I'm filling.

189
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,320
I was like, yeah.

190
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,820
I'm filling.

191
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,400
So do I draw my friend code in the chat?

192
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,100
Is that the play?

193
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,580
I put my friend code already.

194
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,720
You scroll up.

195
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,280
Okay.

196
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,560
Did you know that someone's friend code is actually just a portion of their actual account ID?

197
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,700
Which means you can find it even if you're not.

198
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,320
Oh, we post it too.

199
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:06,980
Oh, that's cool.

200
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,740
Just in case.

201
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,700
Okay.

202
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,940
I will add you as a friend.

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,720
How do I...

204
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,680
I can't click anything because so many people added me.

205
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,620
I shouldn't have done that.

206
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,280
We should just add you.

207
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,680
No, I got this.

208
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,060
Okay.

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,980
Okay, maybe not.

210
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,100
Ah!

211
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,320
My Steam is not going to the friends...

212
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,780
Okay.

213
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,160
Maybe we should add you.

214
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,400
Okay.

215
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,340
So we have an issue.

216
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,520
My Steam is not letting me go to my friends section.

217
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,860
Just refresh it.

218
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,380
How do you refresh Steam?

219
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,120
Bro, just...

220
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,360
Bro, just give us your friend code.

221
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,320
It's easier.

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,080
I don't know how to give you my friend code if I can't even go to the friends section.

223
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,780
Oh, you can't either.

224
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,780
Yeah.

225
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,160
Okay.

226
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,000
F5 is not working, Your Honor.

227
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,200
Do I hit Alt F5?

228
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,140
Oh no.

229
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,340
No.

230
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,060
F5?

231
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,720
F5?

232
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,120
Hit the button.

233
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,880
You can do it.

234
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,760
I pressed it!

235
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,280
Ah!

236
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,900
Fuck!

237
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,980
View friends list?

238
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,420
That works.

239
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,040
Add a friend.

240
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,860
Oh, okay.

241
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,040
Dude, I'm stuck.

242
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,320
Like a bug.

243
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,920
How are you stuck?

244
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,580
Okay.

245
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,440
Wait, can I get to my friends list from my...

246
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,620
Okay.

247
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,160
Friends.

248
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,620
Oh, wait, wait.

249
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm on the way, I think.

250
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,300
I'm on my friends list a different way.

251
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,260
So, that's pretty easy, I think.

252
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,020
I can just go to...

253
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,660
You can just go in the top and hit add a friend too.

254
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:34,900
Oh, wait.

255
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.

256
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,560
But the thing is, like, if I press the button, it doesn't change my Steam.

257
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,200
It's letting me go anywhere, but the actual place we need to go.

258
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,600
I know.

259
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,080
I'm so sorry.

260
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,120
How is this possible?!

261
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,160
Use the browser!

262
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,240
Use the browser!

263
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,060
Go to the browser!

264
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,040
Oh, yeah, the sign on my browser now!

265
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,180
You can look at your friend code in browser!

266
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,120
Just go and dox it.

267
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,240
Okay, so can I look at my...

268
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,460
So how do I...

269
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,040
Can I copy my profile and then you guys can dox my friend code?

270
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,200
Wait, what?

271
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,500
None of us is showing our Steam!

272
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,340
None of us is showing our Steam!

273
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,060
What do you mean, Fillion?!

274
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,040
Okay, do I restart Steam?!

275
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,620
Just...

276
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,460
Why don't you just go on the browser?

277
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,660
Okay, okay, I'm walking on my browser.

278
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,180
Okay, okay.

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,440
Fine!

280
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,060
Jeez, okay, fine.

281
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
Steam login.

282
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,320
Alright.

283
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay.

284
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,760
I can imagine Pippa just muting and flaming me right now, dude.

285
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,700
I'm not muted!

286
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,740
Are you flaming me though?

287
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
Want me to flame you openly?

288
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,100
Flaming me just flam- I'm a little more comfortable.

289
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,160
I'm having anxiety heavy breathing.

290
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,340
Just do some insults.

291
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,680
Okay, I signed in.

292
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,780
Oh, I can probably just add friends from here.

293
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,540
Isn't that crazy?

294
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,020
Yeah, I thought that.

295
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,640
Yeah, I remember when I said that.

296
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,540
Like, why don't you just turn on the browser?

297
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,700
No, that'd be crazy.

298
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,800
Okay, so I went to fr- It's telling me to sign- What?

299
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,700
Okay.

300
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,120
Okay, wait.

301
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,940
So how do I- Fillion has to sign in to add friends.

302
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,680
Come on.

303
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,140
Come on.

304
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,080
Okay, okay, no, but like, okay.

305
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
So I'm on the browser, right?

306
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,740
Okay, I'm on the browser, right?

307
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,460
Okay.

308
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,320
There is no panel that says friends.

309
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
You can look at your Steam code.

310
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,660
How?

311
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,320
How about I host it?

312
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,300
Okay, fine, you host it.

313
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,900
Whatever, man.

314
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,800
Okay, okay.

315
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,300
Yeah, this is good.

316
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,820
Can I open a custom game or create a game?

317
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,880
Just create a game.

318
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,960
Just create a game.

319
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,320
Local, go to local, create a game.

320
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,760
And then...

321
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,300
I'm getting replaced.

322
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,260
I won television.

323
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,120
Freaking me out.

324
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,900
Local?

325
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,280
I don't have the- You can't call me out.

326
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,780
I made this business.

327
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,220
You just get public and private.

328
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,660
I made this business.

329
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
Private, private, private.

330
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,820
Just do private.

331
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,880
Okay, private.

332
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,040
Living board?

333
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,160
Classic board?

334
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,540
Do living, do living, do living, do living.

335
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Do living.

336
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,420
Wait, you don't have a third option?

337
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,820
No.

338
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,240
I have a third option.

339
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,520
We can have rapid mode.

340
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:06,660
What the fuck?

341
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,060
The game session will automatically start in five minutes?

342
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,240
Yeah, yeah, no, it does that.

343
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,060
Yeah, I saw that too.

344
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,180
Okay, let me in!

345
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,580
Wait, wait, wait, we should do- How the fuck do I invite?

346
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,100
Wait, if I host it, I have the rapid board.

347
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,880
Oh, I have to add you to Ubisoft.

348
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,080
That's what I'm saying!

349
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,560
No, no, no, we don't have to.

350
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,280
We're doing remote play.

351
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,900
I'm an epic failure.

352
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,800
Guys, this is exactly why I was like, this is going to be a lot of technical issues.

353
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,540
No, no, no, no, no, no.

354
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,280
None of you guys believe me.

355
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,780
I was cooking.

356
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,680
None of you believed me when I said- I invited.

357
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:41,680
I trusted.

358
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,140
I trusted.

359
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,080
None of you.

360
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,380
Why did you trust Fillion over me?

361
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,720
I am trustworthy!

362
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,160
Watch out!

363
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,220
Trust Fillion over me!

364
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,060
Okay, okay, I had you as a friend.

365
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,660
Guess what?

366
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,240
I got there.

367
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Hippo, get online!

368
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,040
They said it could have been done, but I didn't.

369
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
That is like the lowest benchmark you can have!

370
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,760
Yeah, but I won the board, baby!

371
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,700
That's just like passing!

372
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,020
It's like getting a 50% and being happy about it.

373
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,160
It's like getting a 50% and being happy about it.

374
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,180
I agree!

375
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,960
You're going to be effing single, frick you!

376
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,220
Alright, so now I'm here.

377
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,820
I invited- I'm in the remote play.

378
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,180
I invited everyone, I think.

379
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,240
You invited me?

380
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,700
You have to make sure you make another slot for us.

381
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,380
Because we're remote play.

382
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,060
So we need another slot.

383
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,840
How the fuck do I do that?

384
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,740
I don't know, but I'm controlling your mouse right now.

385
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,140
I can't click on any of these things.

386
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,100
You literally can't click on shit.

387
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,180
I'm in.

388
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,900
I'm in.

389
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,460
I don't know.

390
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,500
You literally can't click on shit!

391
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,940
Pull up the instructions, Fillion!

392
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,760
Pull up the remote play instructions!

393
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:55,800
Wait, me?

394
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,580
Okay!

395
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,420
Yes, you get the instructions!

396
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,500
I got this, I got this, I got this.

397
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,780
Don't worry, don't worry, kiddies.

398
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,560
The present that they've put together, friends want to play.

399
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,140
Make sure the host enables the keyboard and mouse controls to the friend.

400
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,240
Oh, okay, okay.

401
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,120
Enables the keyboard and mouse controls to the friend.

402
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,420
Enable me!

403
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,680
One person has to use the controller.

404
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,220
I'll plug in the controller.

405
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,460
Okay, okay, I'll use the keyboard because I'm an effing keyboard warrior.

406
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,400
Okay, I gave you all stuff, but...

407
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,460
Pitbull, your internet's not working?

408
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,160
Now how do I add more people?

409
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,980
How do you add more people?

410
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,360
How do I add more people?

411
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,780
The game's gonna start a token!

412
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,100
Look at the instructions.

413
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,600
Where are the instructions?

414
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,440
The instructions!

415
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,560
Why don't we just play on one?

416
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,260
Instructions, Fillion!

417
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,120
Okay, it says, make sure the host enables the keyboard.

418
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,120
and mouse controls to the friends.

419
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,800
That's what it says.

420
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,880
I gave it!

421
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,000
I gave it!

422
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,500
And then what?

423
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,560
That's what the mask is!

424
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,780
Uh...

425
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000
That's something that says invite player.

426
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,100
Maybe just like, re-invite us?

427
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,680
No, we're all in though.

428
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,620
No, I can only invite through Ubisoft.

429
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,560
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

430
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,880
Oh, someone hit a B button!

431
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,460
Because it's me.

432
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,280
Wait, don't you have to?

433
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,800
That's me!

434
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,000
I brought my controller out!

435
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,420
That's me!

436
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,140
Wait, are you?

437
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,060
I think you're in online.

438
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,960
You're in online, you're not local.

439
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,500
Go back, go back.

440
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,860
We are so brain damaged.

441
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,420
Yes, you're in online mode!

442
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,720
Chat, are we stupid?

443
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,180
What is in the comments section?

444
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:24,700
Back out again!

445
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,980
Back out again!

446
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,120
Back out again!

447
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,740
Local!

448
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
So how many VTubers did they just screw to life bomb?

449
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,740
It takes one!

450
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,500
Because I can basically...

451
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,060
I think the more VTubers you have, the longer it takes.

452
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,820
You have enough for Rabbids!

453
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,460
Bro, we should do Rabbids mode!

454
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,200
Do Rabbids mode!

455
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,080
Do Rabbids mode!

456
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,480
Do it for Pippa!

457
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,420
Bro, we should do Rabbids mode!

458
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,140
What?

459
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,520
Is that Rabbids?

460
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,580
Is that Rabbids mode?

461
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,540
Now can you join?

462
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
I picked Rabbids mode.

463
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,900
This is local, right?

464
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,940
Did you enable keyboard for us?

465
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,860
Yeah, did you enable?

466
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,600
Can you enable us?

467
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,760
I fucking enabled you!

468
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,220
I'm taking it away from you right now!

469
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,520
I see your result too.

470
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,080
Give me my rights!

471
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,860
I gave you your rights.

472
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,760
You don't deserve any.

473
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,280
Thank you.

474
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:20,860
Mods!

475
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,040
Okay.

476
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,220
So how do we...

477
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,280
So your guy who gave you your instructions, how do we make a new person?

478
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,360
He just says...

479
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,820
Oh my god!

480
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,260
Okay, okay.

481
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,100
And then...

482
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,140
Lumi, add two more!

483
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,260
One of them has to be controller!

484
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,800
Okay, we got this.

485
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,920
How do we swap the controller?

486
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
One of them has to be on controller.

487
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,480
Pick something!

488
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,300
That's not me!

489
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
Wait, am I controlling this?

490
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,960
Oh, this is me!

491
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,660
I'm player three!

492
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,760
Who is me?

493
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,420
You have replaced nerd.

494
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,620
Wait, is Pippa in here?

495
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,480
You gotta select your thing.

496
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,640
You turned me into an AI!

497
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
You epic NPC-ified me!

498
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,600
Wait, how do we change?

499
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,080
Put it back!

500
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,400
Well, the AI will do more work than the original, so I...

501
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,720
No, that's not true!

502
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,060
I'm wearing weapon world of worship.

503
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,260
The AI will definitely win the game.

504
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,020
Okay.

505
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,180
Lumi, you're the top hat.

506
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,080
Is anyone getting game sound from this?

507
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,820
Because I'm not.

508
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,320
I have game sound.

509
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,760
I don't hear anything in the game.

510
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,580
I don't hear game sound either.

511
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,340
Yeah.

512
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,140
I don't hear game sound either.

513
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,340
Is that me?

514
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,660
Does your guy know how to fix game sound?

515
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,600
What the fuck?

516
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,080
Pippa!

517
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,040
Pippa's literally an Emgrist Screamshot.

518
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,560
Pippa disconnected!

519
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,620
It's my name!

520
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,280
Motherfucker!

521
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,980
Oh my god!

522
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,380
Stop moving my mouth!

523
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,100
I'm gonna rip someone's hair out.

524
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,340
It could be mine.

525
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:54,800
I don't know.

526
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,980
Wait, you guys can hear it?

527
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,340
I can't hear the game sound?

528
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,500
I invited you.

529
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,920
We're all remoting.

530
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,160
All remote.

531
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,540
Okay.

532
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,700
How do we make this not an AI?

533
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,080
Okay, okay.

534
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,180
It's not an AI.

535
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,960
Pick a thingy.

536
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,620
Chad, can you hear the music?

537
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,720
No, I don't.

538
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
My chat was like, I hear it.

539
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,060
It's just really faint.

540
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,420
Can you hear music?

541
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,460
I barely hear it.

542
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,160
I don't hear anything.

543
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,820
You don't hear anything?

544
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,720
I can hear the game.

545
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,380
It's just really quiet.

546
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,480
You guys can?

547
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,160
It's really quiet.

548
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,040
Do you want me to turn it up?

549
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,140
Oh my god, it is!

550
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,380
Stop disconnecting!

551
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,960
Oh my god.

552
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,740
I hear it.

553
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,620
I have to turn up my volume.

554
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,800
Pema!

555
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,280
Pema, you closed the game!

556
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,680
What?

557
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,920
Join again.

558
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,640
Close the game!

559
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,800
Close the game!

560
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,480
Okay, wait.

561
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,920
We're still four players.

562
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,320
Someone get the four player in here.

563
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I think Peppa's connection is literally dropping so often she can't even join.

564
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,260
Okay, player three is gonna be Pema.

565
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,100
And then we're gonna put player four as Doggy.

566
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,140
That's me?

567
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,360
No, no.

568
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,160
Doggy is a dog, right?

569
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
Doggy, did you pick the dog?

570
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,520
No, did I?

571
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,460
Maybe I did.

572
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,200
Okay, just pick something.

573
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,000
No, that's not me.

574
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,620
I think that's Pippa.

575
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,780
I think I'm player two.

576
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,600
Okay, okay, okay.

577
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,420
I accidentally picked a dog.

578
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,520
Okay, are we good?

579
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,400
Sure.

580
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,480
Wait, but how come there's no color next to player four?

581
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,140
Why are they grey?

582
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,900
Double do, double die.

583
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,640
Because, like, it's just how colors work.

584
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,600
Okay, fine.

585
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,920
It's just...

586
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,520
Okay.

587
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,200
Are we all good now?

588
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,580
You might need to turn up the volume.

589
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,820
You might need to turn up the volume.

590
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,520
Blast it.

591
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,160
I can't adjust it without exiting the menu again.

592
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,240
We got it.

593
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,840
You can't just tab out?

594
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,760
We got the basic necessity.

595
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
I got it.

596
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,860
You can't tab out, Lumi?

597
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,000
Holy shit.

598
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,760
Tabbing out?

599
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,040
If I tab out, it'll break the game for you guys.

600
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,460
Wait, there's only three players.

601
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,400
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

602
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,580
What happened to our foreplay?

603
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,200
It's because it was grey now.

604
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
I didn't have a color sign to it.

605
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
I redo, I redo.

606
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,400
Enter.

607
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,900
It's okay.

608
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,740
Why don't we just do online?

609
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,520
Because online's gonna crash.

610
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,740
Pippa!

611
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,340
I swear to god it wasn't gonna be that bad.

612
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
I swear to god it wasn't gonna be that bad.

613
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,280
I swear to god it wasn't gonna be that bad.

614
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,200
Pippa just merely existed and I blamed her.

615
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,660
Local creator.

616
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,440
Oh my god.

617
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
It's just an easier name to like and how it is.

618
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,420
I don't play cards against humanity.

619
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,220
No.

620
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,740
Motherfucker, I hate this shit.

621
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,320
We're playing Monopoly.

622
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,420
Can I not throw this game away?

623
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,540
Like it just has to be this game forever?

624
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,800
WHAT?

625
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,700
Okay, how about like Pippa teams up with somebody.

626
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,340
I can do it.

627
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,700
He's created new games.

628
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,860
No, not the living board.

629
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,340
Monopoly Rabbids.

630
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,220
Rabbids.

631
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,800
Rabbids.

632
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,180
Okay.

633
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,860
Those are like Rabbids to Rabbids.

634
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,520
Those are like F tier.

635
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,200
Those are like Oompa Loompas, but stupider.

636
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:05,980
Rapids.

637
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,980
Rabbids and then Pippa.

638
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,220
And then Fillion can beat.

639
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,720
Wait, why is it AI again?

640
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,760
Yeah, I'm just gonna make Fillion uh... this thing.

641
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,520
I think that's funny.

642
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,580
Yeah, make me brown.

643
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,300
Cool, that's fine.

644
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm a Poop-smasher.

645
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,580
Okay, I'm ready.

646
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,940
We start the game.

647
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,680
We fucking did it.

648
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,960
Clap it up chat!

649
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,920
It only took like 80 years.

650
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,400
Okay, we need...

651
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,100
There's no player 5.

652
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,200
All we need is Lumi to raise the volume of the game.

653
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
And then we should be set.

654
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,020
Lumi, please kiddin'.

655
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,160
Tap out and raise the volume of the video game.

656
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,020
Why is it at 3?

657
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
Cause it's fucking loud on my end.

658
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,400
Yeah, but you can turn it down on your...

659
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
Fine, fine, fine.

660
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,340
Where is my sound mixer?

661
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,480
Sound mixer...

662
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh my god!

663
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,240
I don't know how to get it.

664
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,680
Harts and Chapros, guys.

665
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,540
Okay, okay, it's coming.

666
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,960
Okay, okay, I got it.

667
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,500
It says... the game is...

668
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,180
Oh, fuck.

669
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,140
We already know the smell of the game.

670
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,340
Is this loud enough for you?

671
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,880
Why is Lumi so quiet now?

672
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,900
What about SFX?

673
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,460
What the fuck, Lumi?

674
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,800
Why is Lumi quiet?

675
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,280
Why are you so quiet?

676
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,780
Did you turn yourself down, Lumi?

677
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,220
What is this human doing?

678
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,200
What do you mean?

679
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,960
What do you mean?

680
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,620
You accidentally turned yourself down instead of the rest of the game.

681
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,060
Lumi, you sound like I said this is Sparta and then I kicked you down an effing hole.

682
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,880
You already did that in...

683
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,630
Whatever, shit.

684
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,650
Sorry, I don't take notes from like midgets, okay?

685
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,290
Like, actually speak up, pipsqueak.

686
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,450
How tall are you, bitch?

687
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,110
How tall are you right now?

688
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,710
You sound like R2-D2 on a good day.

689
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,190
Oh, oh, oh, oh, at least I have a brain unlike you.

690
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,010
You know what's funny is that I can barely hear Lumi's insults back.

691
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,310
You know what's funny is that I can barely hear Lumi's insults back.

692
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,410
Me too.

693
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,850
I feel like I'm listening to alien signals from Mars.

694
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,930
It's like hearing somebody fight back like 200 miles away.

695
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,850
I know.

696
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,470
I'm playing Ender's game and she's the alien.

697
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,610
She's like on the moon just shouting back at you.

698
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,630
All right, Lance Armstrong, chill out, bro.

699
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,770
We know you faked it.

700
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,690
Can we just do this?

701
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,010
Bro, you know you're so quiet.

702
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,550
Your volume is still low, nerd.

703
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,190
You're like 50% of what your original volume was.

704
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,470
Chill out, Chad.

705
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,670
No, Philly, this is 100% your fault.

706
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,590
Can we just go with this?

707
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,390
I was like, hey guys, maybe we should test this out before we stream.

708
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,270
Can we just go like this?

709
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:40,970
Is it good?

710
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,010
Is it better now?

711
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,470
Nobody believed me.

712
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,890
I undid what I did.

713
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,010
I undid it.

714
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,790
No, you're still like 50% quieter.

715
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,110
I don't know what you did, but you...

716
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,650
Just turn up on Discord now.

717
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,510
We'll just have to fix it.

718
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,150
I literally turned it up to where it was.

719
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,610
Okay, she's good.

720
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,150
Her volume is low.

721
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,510
I literally turned it up to where it was.

722
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,290
This is bullshit.

723
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,590
Okay, we're good.

724
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,710
Fuck this.

725
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:06,850
Resume.

726
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,370
Alright, there you go.

727
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:09,850
Let's go.

728
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,990
It's your turn.

729
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,550
Shake the dice.

730
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,070
Roll the dice.

731
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,070
Yeah.

732
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,830
Am I the dog?

733
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,310
I think so.

734
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,550
Am I the dog?

735
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,290
No, I am not.

736
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,030
It's somebody else.

737
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,510
You can do whatever you want to be.

738
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,390
You can do whatever you want to be.

739
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,390
This is remote play and everyone's playing on one computer.

740
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,410
Okay, I can do it.

741
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,030
Never mind.

742
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,870
You're the dog.

743
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,850
I'm the dog.

744
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,190
You're the king.

745
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,670
I got five.

746
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,230
My controller buzzes every time.

747
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,050
Who's rabid?

748
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,490
I'm the bear.

749
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,750
Pippa's the rabid.

750
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,610
I'm the bear.

751
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,090
Pippa, be the rabid.

752
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,710
I'm the pooky bear.

753
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,190
Okay.

754
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,690
I'm ending my stream because my connection is dying.

755
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,230
Oh, shit.

756
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,150
Did you roll the die for yourself or did somebody else do it?

757
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,650
I didn't roll it.

758
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,330
It wasn't me.

759
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:05,890
It wasn't Tantrum.

760
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,590
Now it's my turn.

761
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,570
You rolled a nine.

762
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,990
Why are you getting so defensive?

763
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,130
Shut the fuck up.

764
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,190
It's not my problem.

765
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,890
Don't crush your doggy.

766
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,230
Why me?

767
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,370
Six.

768
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,630
Number one.

769
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,270
I'm last.

770
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:23,630
Alright.

771
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,730
We're going.

772
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,470
Nice.

773
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:26,790
We're the winners.

774
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,910
First is the worst.

775
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,870
Second is the best.

776
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,970
And third is the golden bird.

777
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,310
Then what am I?

778
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,830
I'm fourth.

779
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,690
You're in the cock chair.

780
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,310
Oh.

781
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,570
Joy, we made it really comfy for you.

782
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,130
Alright.

783
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,650
Here we go.

784
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,590
Roll the dice.

785
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,170
Roll the dice.

786
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,750
Roll the dice.

787
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,270
Who's there?

788
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,010
It's Pippa.

789
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,110
Roll the dice.

790
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,910
I'm nothing bad.

791
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,150
Wait.

792
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,150
What happened to Pippa?

793
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,470
Are we rolling four?

794
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,670
Alright.

795
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,370
I'm playing the fucking game.

796
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,030
Alright.

797
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,630
Say no.

798
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:03,890
Okay.

799
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,110
Wait.

800
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,190
Who's Who's playing this right now?

801
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,730
Is Pippa playing?

802
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,630
That's Pippa.

803
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:07,870
Touch the buttons.

804
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,170
Okay.

805
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,870
We're going to auction.

806
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,150
What?

807
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,530
What?

808
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,010
What?

809
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,780
Sabotage.

810
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,300
Ladies.

811
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:22,940
Ladies.

812
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,720
Ladies.

813
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Ladies.

814
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,080
Ladies.

815
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,900
Ladies.

816
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,480
Pippa.

817
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,440
Why did you do that?

818
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,460
Why did you?

819
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,700
Click auction, Pippa.

820
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,820
I hate you.

821
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,480
Why did you click auction?

822
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,220
That's what it started with.

823
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,520
Yes.

824
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,280
Help.

825
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,200
Hello.

826
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,300
Ladies and gentlemen.

827
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,420
Today we're going to figure out how difficult is Monopoly really.

828
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,460
And we're going to beat the golden bird.

829
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,360
What do you think about Monopoly so far?

830
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,200
I think it's pretty fun so far.

831
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm enjoying it.

832
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,340
Especially on remote.

833
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,620
It seems pretty fun.

834
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,400
She logs in easily as she breathes.

835
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,060
Alright.

836
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,940
Luffy, how are you feeling?

837
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,140
This is shit.

838
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,280
This is fucking terrible.

839
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,800
You all get chill in my mouth.

840
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,260
Just hit the fucking buttons.

841
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,980
Just hit the fucking buttons.

842
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,220
Hit my button.

843
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,780
You clicked auction.

844
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,540
Just hit it.

845
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,540
Hit okay.

846
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,740
I didn't touch it.

847
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,220
Hit okay, Pippa.

848
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,680
My hands are under the desk.

849
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,540
My game crashed.

850
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,100
Luffy.

851
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,460
Okay.

852
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:23,780
Don't worry.

853
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,820
Oh, she hit it.

854
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,300
There we go.

855
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,800
We got it.

856
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,400
Game crashed?

857
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,400
No.

858
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,140
Okay, wait.

859
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,480
Can I buy the auction or what?

860
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,140
Yeah, we can auction this.

861
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,420
I want to bid.

862
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:36,740
Hey, bid.

863
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,100
No, it's Purple's turn.

864
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,480
Yeah, Purple, it's your turn.

865
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,160
Oh, you want to withdraw?

866
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,500
My game crashed!

867
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,380
My game crashed!

868
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,760
Pippa, get it together.

869
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,100
Pippa, get it together.

870
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,660
Okay, I'm going to auction it.

871
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,400
I'm going to bid a hundred bucks.

872
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,740
I'm going to have to gig and chat and nobody can stop me.

873
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,240
I have a more up to nerd.

874
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,240
I bid.

875
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,460
What did you bid?

876
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,100
I bid a hundred.

877
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,560
I bid a hundred too.

878
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,500
Whoa, that's fucking rapid.

879
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,980
I bid a hundred as well.

880
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,700
It's a railway.

881
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,880
You know you're bidding on top of our bids, right?

882
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,100
Lumi, you're blue.

883
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,000
You're blue.

884
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
No, I'm not.

885
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,100
Oh, I'm blue.

886
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,100
Fuck, Pippa's dead.

887
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,500
Pippa can join back.

888
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,400
It's remote play.

889
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,340
That's the thing.

890
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,680
She can join back whenever.

891
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,860
Pippa, come back.

892
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,180
No, we just hate to make you want to add me.

893
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,200
Pippa, come back.

894
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,020
I'm trying to add you.

895
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,900
You have to invite me.

896
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,440
I have to tab out every time.

897
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,260
I got you.

898
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,460
It's a sacrifice we're willing to make.

899
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,900
She can literally join back any time because it's literally remote play.

900
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,700
Okay, here's what we do.

901
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,180
Thank you.

902
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,980
Doki cares.

903
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,880
I'm like Lumi.

904
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,160
Doki cares.

905
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
You just like blondes.

906
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,240
This is blondism.

907
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,160
You're blonde.

908
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,500
With everybody distracted, I can do this.

909
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,620
Oh, shit.

910
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,000
Shut up.

911
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,020
This is unfair.

912
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,140
What are you doing?

913
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,460
I'm gonna vlog you.

914
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,140
Doki with the steal.

915
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,640
With the steal.

916
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,020
Everybody was so distracted.

917
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,740
Motherfucker.

918
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,340
Oh my god.

919
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,440
Fuck you, Doki.

920
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,460
Fuck your taxes.

921
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,620
I hate you guys.

922
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,160
I hope we're not friends in a few minutes.

923
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,240
I am not a fan of the government.

924
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,760
Fuck.

925
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,520
I knew this was the right idea.

926
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,680
This is bullshit.

927
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,960
Don't get an extra name on.

928
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,380
Shut up.

929
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,280
Okay, Doki.

930
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,800
If I roll another number and end up on your railroad, I'm gonna come over to your house and effing put a track on your face.

931
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:31,940
What are you gonna do?

932
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,800
Okay, it's Pippa back in.

933
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,020
Did we get Pippa back in?

934
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,540
We're gonna run.

935
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,280
Ma!

936
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,180
Yeah!

937
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,440
I'm buying it.

938
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:42,940
I'm buying it.

939
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,040
Don't click my nerds.

940
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,360
Don't click my nerds.

941
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,100
Fine.

942
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,160
Yoinkers.

943
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,380
I'm having Oriental.

944
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,680
And I'm on an avenue.

945
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
Alright, here we go.

946
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,060
Yay!

947
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,240
It's my turn!

948
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,120
I already got a property before I win.

949
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,520
Is that crazy, guys?

950
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,740
Shut up.

951
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,320
You're gonna be broke.

952
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:00,920
Fuck up.

953
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,740
No!

954
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,620
Where are you going?

955
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,040
Yay!

956
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,780
I'm going to seven.

957
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
I got a car!

958
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,100
You have no sound effect.

959
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,680
If that's the nearest railroad, if unknown, you may buy it from the bank.

960
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,220
If owned, pay owner twice.

961
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,640
The rent to which they are otherwise entitled.

962
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,160
What?

963
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,620
Oh, I can buy it too?

964
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,380
Oh my god!

965
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,720
Everything is going for Zoki!

966
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,860
This is fucking bullshit.

967
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,320
I'm telling you this is your fault.

968
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,560
It's not my fault.

969
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,180
It's my fault.

970
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,700
But to be fair, it's all our fault.

971
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,120
It's all our fault.

972
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,840
It's also Philly's fault.

973
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,520
I'm kidding.

974
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,800
You can't just blame it.

975
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,440
I'm not Obama.

976
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,300
Don't blame it on me.

977
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,340
I'm letting you in.

978
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,480
I'm not going to trade with anybody.

979
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,020
Do I just end my turn?

980
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,080
What happened to the spirit of teamwork?

981
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,600
Yay!

982
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,720
I have two railroads now.

983
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,260
Do we invite Pippa back?

984
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,520
Yo, Zoki, team up.

985
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,360
Check your PayPal.

986
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:01,800
No!

987
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,520
Lumi, silence!

988
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,400
The women are speaking.

989
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,520
Zoki.

990
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,220
Please.

991
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,940
Team up with me.

992
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,640
What do I get out of it?

993
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,260
What do I get out of it?

994
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,680
What do I get out of it though?

995
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,680
Roads to rail.

996
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,140
Okay, but like how many roads though?

997
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,380
You heard of Pipp's sexual.

998
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,360
Now get ready for a boulevardian.

999
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,860
What?

1000
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,160
What the fuck is this Pippa lock?

1001
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,540
Did Pippa even like...

1002
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,480
Okay, is that Pippa playing?

1003
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,080
She actually passed through me.

1004
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,880
You're a Sanifax dog?

1005
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,800
Holy frick.

1006
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,560
What the hell?

1007
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,120
How do we build the houses again?

1008
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,520
You have to own all the colors.

1009
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,340
You just have to land on it again.

1010
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,900
And then you can build a house.

1011
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,080
You have to land on it again.

1012
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,740
Did you have a bubble?

1013
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,800
Okay, give me the fucking property.

1014
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,760
Yes, buy.

1015
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,520
No auction.

1016
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,200
No!

1017
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,760
I want to get the blue one.

1018
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,300
I love the blue property.

1019
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,960
I didn't click anything.

1020
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,040
What do you mean?

1021
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,780
I really only did one.

1022
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,340
Will you have the history?

1023
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,340
Oh, because I did it once.

1024
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,500
I have a history.

1025
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,600
Oh my god.

1026
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,840
That's what it means.

1027
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,560
You did it before.

1028
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,580
Oh my god.

1029
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,380
You have to buy the entire planet.

1030
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,220
Stop.

1031
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,920
My stocks are going up.

1032
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,440
Okay, it's my turn.

1033
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,460
Please give me a double.

1034
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,680
Please give me a double.

1035
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,960
Land on my property, coward.

1036
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,480
You won't.

1037
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:31,980
Shut up.

1038
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,160
I would rather go to jail.

1039
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,180
I like trains.

1040
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,360
No!

1041
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,800
You haven't done the crime yet.

1042
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,960
You haven't got caught.

1043
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,340
Oh my god.

1044
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,180
Tax evasion does fail.

1045
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,660
You haven't got caught yet.

1046
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,740
You're so lucky.

1047
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,200
Is that the end of my turn?

1048
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,900
Yeah, that is.

1049
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,400
Just press enter for me.

1050
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,680
Just press enter for me.

1051
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,700
Okay, I'll press enter for you.

1052
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,040
It's your turn.

1053
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,220
I have nothing going for me.

1054
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,140
I have nothing going for me.

1055
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,440
Oh, I got the pass.

1056
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,380
Free parking.

1057
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,620
Free parking.

1058
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,740
You just won $5.

1059
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,340
Congrats.

1060
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,120
I did it.

1061
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
Parking is expensive.

1062
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,340
Parking is actually pretty expensive in downtown.

1063
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,840
Who's that?

1064
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,020
You guys are all landing on properties.

1065
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,760
That's unfair.

1066
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,940
Tell me about it.

1067
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,560
I own a singular blue property.

1068
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,420
That's called karma.

1069
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,100
We don't control other people's thoughts.

1070
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,240
Does anyone want to auction their property off?

1071
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,260
Yes, yes, yes.

1072
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,280
I would like to auction.

1073
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,560
I would like to auction jail.

1074
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,240
It's a government property.

1075
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,460
I'll steal it.

1076
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,480
You want to auction it off?

1077
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,620
No, no, no.

1078
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,020
I'm good.

1079
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,640
I'm good.

1080
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm good.

1081
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:46,900
I'm good.

1082
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,300
It's good.

1083
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,980
I'm literally behind you guys and I get to auction literally nothing.

1084
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,580
Buy nothing.

1085
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,340
I'm going to land on someone's property.

1086
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,520
You have no property.

1087
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,960
I didn't commit tax fraud.

1088
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,300
Why do you have one property?

1089
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,700
No, I visited EDP.

1090
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,800
He said it was a really good cupcake.

1091
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,260
I don't know what you won from me.

1092
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,940
Let me roll.

1093
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,680
I just killed myself.

1094
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,120
What?

1095
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
I got a double.

1096
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,660
Okay, we're still back.

1097
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,400
Wait, is this really good?

1098
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,160
Yeah, this is electric company.

1099
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,860
You own electricity.

1100
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,600
Chat.

1101
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,680
Chat.

1102
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,340
I'm now in a water type Pokemon.

1103
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,160
Thundera!

1104
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,320
Now we have to pay Thillion for looming.

1105
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,100
Yeah, pay me every time internet crashes.

1106
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,540
Crack, pull me Comcast.

1107
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,440
I hate Comcast.

1108
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,680
I'm going to fiber.

1109
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,260
I'm moving and I'm getting fiber.

1110
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,300
Fuck you, me.

1111
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,540
Look at my eyes.

1112
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,960
Turn up the SFX volume in chat.

1113
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,540
He wants to hear something.

1114
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,760
Why is it 25, dude?

1115
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,400
Because it's fucking loud.

1116
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,320
It's not loud at all.

1117
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,360
It's so loud.

1118
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,560
You don't need these sounds.

1119
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,200
Okay, we don't need 25.

1120
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,120
I don't mind.

1121
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,280
It's louder than everything else in the game.

1122
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,220
Just pick up your phone.

1123
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,120
Do you like trains?

1124
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,720
Yes or no?

1125
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,300
I don't give a goddamn mind.

1126
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,160
Knockers acoustic.

1127
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,760
Okay.

1128
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,620
Roll your dice.

1129
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,820
Please roll your dice.

1130
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,400
I'm dead again.

1131
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,020
What the fuck?

1132
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,560
Who did I roll before?

1133
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Wait, does anyone own this?

1134
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,260
I don't think so.

1135
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,760
We are so Barack.

1136
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,080
We are so Barack, boys.

1137
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,540
St. James Place.

1138
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,660
I'm going to touch it and purchase it.

1139
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,060
There it is.

1140
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,720
Why did you wear it like that?

1141
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,060
Call yourself Fillion Rockefeller.

1142
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,020
Yeah, my turn.

1143
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,960
Yup, yup.

1144
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,280
Chat, I'm about to run an effing Monopoly on these effing nerds.

1145
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,780
Wait, that's the game.

1146
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,240
You're doing so good, Fillion.

1147
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,680
Okay, let me go.

1148
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,120
Does anyone own... nobody owns these properties.

1149
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,100
Damn, so close.

1150
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,600
Nice.

1151
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,920
Now you can have the red.

1152
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,860
It's mine now.

1153
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,580
Man.

1154
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,060
That's right.

1155
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
I mean, I'll sell it to you.

1156
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,820
I'll sell it to you, Lumi.

1157
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,360
How about the games?

1158
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,080
I'm going to tell about the games.

1159
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,720
Look, real estate is like really...

1160
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,800
It's a difficult market right now.

1161
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,840
Pay school fees.

1162
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,600
You're going back to school.

1163
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,800
Oh, look, you're going broke.

1164
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,020
You're going broke, nerd.

1165
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,640
Congratulations on graduating.

1166
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,380
I mean, $50 for student debt.

1167
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,040
That's pretty...

1168
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,560
That's a good deal.

1169
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,160
Bargain.

1170
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,560
That's pretty good.

1171
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,380
How many properties do you guys own?

1172
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,280
I own three.

1173
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,240
I can't do this effects at all.

1174
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,340
I hear it.

1175
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,800
It says there's not a lot of sound effects.

1176
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,520
It's just go...

1177
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,860
Yeah, I know, but they're still laughing low.

1178
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,500
Like what?

1179
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,320
What do you want them to be?

1180
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,340
It's just going to be like a ding sound or whatever.

1181
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,000
I know, I know.

1182
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,620
I want to hear my dings.

1183
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,220
She wants to hear her dings, guys.

1184
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,320
People will literally grind for 30 hours in RuneScape to hear her sing her ding when they level up.

1185
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,040
Her attention span is so low that she needs to hear her dings.

1186
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,500
Thanks for the galaxy!

1187
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,900
Thanks for the galaxy!

1188
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,260
Oh wow!

1189
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,340
100 guzzies!

1190
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,720
Guzzy overdrive enabled.

1191
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,400
Did you crash us?

1192
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,260
Did you crash us?

1193
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,280
No.

1194
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,380
No, she's trying to lower her volumes and stuff.

1195
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm trying to lower the volume on my side.

1196
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,720
It's literally a ding sound effect.

1197
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,360
It's literally a ding sound effect.

1198
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,300
I swear, this collab has been the hardest to sound balance in my life.

1199
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,880
In between everyone yelling?

1200
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,800
In between everyone fucking yelling?

1201
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,380
This has been the...

1202
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,640
My sound guy really like gave up.

1203
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,360
Yeah, it's been a little...

1204
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,880
Double!

1205
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,480
Double?

1206
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,520
Dude, that's not fair.

1207
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,340
And she gets a...

1208
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,420
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

1209
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:49,720
Woo!

1210
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,880
Pacific Gap!

1211
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,580
Oh my god.

1212
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,640
She's getting the expensive properties now.

1213
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,160
Hell yeah.

1214
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,440
Don't come to California, nerd.

1215
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,800
No, she's gonna be too broke to buy boardwalk.

1216
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,420
No, she can afford it.

1217
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,020
No, she haven't skipped it.

1218
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,600
I still have 600.

1219
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,020
Nice boardwalk now.

1220
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,280
I passed go.

1221
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,820
Was that my real...

1222
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,000
No, it's just a community chest.

1223
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,740
Oh!

1224
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,080
Oh no, she killed...

1225
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,060
My dog died!

1226
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,760
Did you come to life insurance on your dog?

1227
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,260
For money.

1228
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,860
That's fucked up.

1229
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,960
My dog died.

1230
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,380
That's fucked up because life insurance doesn't mean old age.

1231
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,760
What did you do to your dog?

1232
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,820
Nothing, nothing.

1233
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,680
Don't worry about it.

1234
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,480
Don't worry about your little doggy piece face.

1235
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,480
Please, please, please.

1236
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,820
You can't grab life insurance if it's old age.

1237
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,340
You can't?

1238
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,740
No, you can't.

1239
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,620
Because they would never give you life insurance if it's like...

1240
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,060
Okay, thank you.

1241
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,700
Wait, who am I trade with?

1242
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,600
We don't want to trade with.

1243
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,280
Why are you trading?

1244
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,700
Oh, somebody clicked trade.

1245
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1246
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,020
Oh my god, if somebody pressed N, she's out.

1247
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,260
No, stop, stop.

1248
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,060
There's a bank club button.

1249
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,180
It would be a shame if somebody just pressed N.

1250
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:19,700
It would be a shame if somebody just pressed N.

1251
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,860
What the fuck?

1252
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,860
Oh, she's going to jail.

1253
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,760
Listen.

1254
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,380
You might as well be bankrupt.

1255
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,680
God dang it, dude.

1256
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,840
Get fucked, Billy.

1257
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,260
Why am I in the good log?

1258
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,660
I literally rolled a double.

1259
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,560
Does that make me invincible?

1260
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,400
No.

1261
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,900
That's just proof that you stacked the dice.

1262
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,540
Yeah, that was illegal.

1263
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,240
You just did an illegal thing.

1264
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,240
Why the hell did you play my game like that?

1265
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,640
You're just mad because I'm putting a bulletin down and I'm about to buy boardwalk when I grow up.

1266
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
And you guys have the wrong reward.

1267
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,860
It's true.

1268
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,680
My turn.

1269
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,320
Let's see.

1270
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,340
Does anyone own that?

1271
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:58,780
Nope.

1272
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,320
Is that another utility?

1273
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,740
Oh, you can have a monopoly on the utility now.

1274
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,560
I own the water.

1275
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,800
Okay.

1276
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,100
You own the water and I own the effing electricity.

1277
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,040
We can put them together and create toasters and bathtubs.

1278
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,820
We can sell this as a product for Darwinism.

1279
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,180
What do you think?

1280
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,020
What the fuck?

1281
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,480
This is exactly why she's in jail.

1282
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,680
This is why we've kept her in jail.

1283
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
I'm not in jail.

1284
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm visiting.

1285
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,480
You're definitely in jail right now.

1286
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:33,960
I'm just...

1287
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,160
I'm doing nothing.

1288
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,380
Oh, and money!

1289
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,840
Thank you, Pippa.

1290
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:38,980
Okay.

1291
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,720
Yay!

1292
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,040
I knew owning that railway that Pippa auctioned off was a good idea.

1293
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:48,460
I'm doing three days in a row.

1294
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:48,540
Shut up.

1295
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,560
Wait, who's this to me?

1296
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,320
You can't roll again.

1297
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,360
You got snake eyes.

1298
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,980
You got doubles.

1299
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,840
Pippa, bail me out of jail.

1300
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,860
No!

1301
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,880
Go say hi to me.

1302
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,880
She needs some company.

1303
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,860
Don't leave me.

1304
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,580
Don't leave me.

1305
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,800
She's gonna influence you.

1306
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,460
Bye.

1307
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,660
Get taxed, idiot.

1308
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,280
It's my land.

1309
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,500
Okay, here.

1310
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,600
Oh, you actually press trade.

1311
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:19,980
What?

1312
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,400
You actually press trade.

1313
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,220
No, no, no.

1314
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,500
Please trade with me.

1315
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,400
Are you the bear?

1316
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,560
Yeah, I'm the bear.

1317
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,900
What do you want to trade?

1318
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,000
Here, I'll give you...

1319
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,640
I'll give you...

1320
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,700
Enough to get out of jail?

1321
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,860
Wait, what?

1322
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,900
What the...

1323
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,080
Are you gonna post your bail?

1324
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,700
Why are you bailing her out?

1325
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,320
You gotta give me something.

1326
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,760
What do you want?

1327
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,040
What do you...

1328
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,760
She wants...

1329
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,980
She wants your electricity.

1330
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,460
You would do that to me?

1331
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,140
I would.

1332
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,520
You think I'm gonna give up my early investments just because you're gonna give me an effing...

1333
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,840
You're trying to dogecoin me.

1334
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,540
You're trying to pump and dump me.

1335
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,140
It's a very good deal.

1336
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,680
You made $5.00.

1337
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,980
You're not in my scam.

1338
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,400
You're not in my scam.

1339
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,580
Like, honestly, I feel like you're in jail right now, Fillion.

1340
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,020
You should not be negotiating.

1341
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,580
You know what, Fillion?

1342
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,060
You know what?

1343
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,680
Fillion, blink twice.

1344
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,480
Are you just gonna quit the game?

1345
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,720
No, no, no.

1346
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,420
The first rage quitter right here.

1347
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm gonna counter offer.

1348
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,360
Here's my counter offer, okay?

1349
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,460
I'm gonna remove...

1350
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,000
How do I play?

1351
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,960
You have to remove it on your own screen.

1352
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,000
On your side, you see your side with all the cards?

1353
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,240
You gotta click it on yourself.

1354
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,240
Oh...

1355
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,220
What?

1356
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,760
Underneath your money.

1357
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,540
You see all those cards on the right side?

1358
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,220
Just click...

1359
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,480
Obviously, no, because your cursor's not on it.

1360
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,620
Obviously, I know you don't understand.

1361
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,140
Yes, okay, there you go.

1362
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,000
There.

1363
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,140
No, you don't wanna know.

1364
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,600
Frick this.

1365
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,320
How do I...

1366
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,980
Just double click it.

1367
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,580
Yeah, if you don't want it, just click it again.

1368
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:14,640
How?

1369
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,360
Press... Okay, click it and then press remove.

1370
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,560
No, I'm not interested.

1371
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,780
Click it and then press enter because it removes the card.

1372
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,620
I'm not interested.

1373
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,640
Okay, fine.

1374
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,500
Yeah.

1375
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,780
What the fuck?

1376
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,340
Yeah.

1377
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,540
Fillion!

1378
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1379
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,780
Almost there.

1380
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,280
Yeah?

1381
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,760
Honestly, like, I'm impressed that Fillion's making these demands when she's in fucking jail.

1382
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,460
Alright, you have nothing.

1383
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,620
Alright, how do I...

1384
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,240
Pippa's literally visiting...

1385
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,320
Pippa's literally visiting you in jail, like, the only person that's willing to visit you.

1386
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,140
She brought you your favorite brownies and shit?

1387
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,380
Yeah, and all the rest of us just pretends you don't...

1388
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,860
pretend you don't exist right now.

1389
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,180
Can you stop?

1390
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,860
I hate you.

1391
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,500
I hate you.

1392
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,520
I hate you.

1393
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,820
When I get out of jail, I'm gonna become the next Warren Buffet and you're gonna be the buffet.

1394
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,080
You understand me?

1395
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,140
I don't think you're able to because you're literally... you literally have a police record.

1396
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,100
No one's gonna hire you now.

1397
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,680
Yeah, you're unhirable.

1398
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,880
Who's gonna hire you?

1399
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,060
I don't know who the fuck you own.

1400
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,780
And when you walk into the store, like, Gustavo afraid to check on your lawyers, I'm gonna stab you in the neck with a shank.

1401
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,320
I just won't go there.

1402
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,580
Okay, I lied.

1403
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,640
I'd actually be like, what do you want?

1404
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,460
You'd be like, number seven.

1405
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,900
I'd be like, sorry, the ice cream machine broke.

1406
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,660
Okay, how do I say I'm not interested?

1407
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,040
Like what is this effing left arrow?

1408
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:49,340
It's back space.

1409
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:49,880
Back space.

1410
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,560
Is that the bottom of this exchange?

1411
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,040
Fillion, I'd order burgers from you.

1412
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:57,520
Okay.

1413
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,540
See, you have a customer.

1414
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:01,820
Okay.

1415
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,500
Roll the dice.

1416
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,660
I'm just, uh, I'm just happy.

1417
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,200
Ooh, Doug.

1418
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,540
I'm doing my own thing and I'm not going to... Oh, Fillion!

1419
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,580
You're going to visit?

1420
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,360
Oh my god!

1421
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,340
You're going to visit Fillion?

1422
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,920
I'm so sad that you're a girl!

1423
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,400
Oh man!

1424
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,580
Lumi's just visiting so she feels more superior than her.

1425
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,380
Lumi, if you feel so bad for me, why don't you give me a small loan of a million?

1426
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,080
Yeah, bye.

1427
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,440
Okay, see you later.

1428
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,040
No, I'm good.

1429
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:27,580
Pass.

1430
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,380
I'm good.

1431
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,480
All my friends are dead, yo.

1432
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,400
Push me to the edge.

1433
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,000
All my friends are dead, yo.

1434
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,460
Push me to the edge.

1435
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Ah, sucks, sucks.

1436
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,160
Sucks to suck, Fillion.

1437
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:36,700
Fuck!

1438
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,140
Fuck!

1439
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,120
Hey, how about you pay me $14?

1440
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,460
Nice, I brought you lunch.

1441
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,980
I brought you pizza to the jail.

1442
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,840
Oh yeah, you tried to run away from me and I haven't caught you.

1443
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
You tried to run, I quick-scoped you on the way out.

1444
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,160
Okay, wait, I can roll dice three times or I can pay 50 bucks.

1445
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,880
You have to roll a double, I think, to get out?

1446
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,760
Just pay $50!

1447
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,000
It's literally 50!

1448
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,520
Shut up, woman!

1449
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,420
It's literally 50!

1450
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,240
I don't want no dice!

1451
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,600
Keep her in jail, Dokie!

1452
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,260
Keep her!

1453
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,480
Yeah, but what if you don't tell?

1454
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,580
Try it, idiot.

1455
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,880
If you don't get the number, then you'll never get out!

1456
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,200
I should've paid the 50.

1457
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,900
I told you, you should've paid the 50!

1458
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,320
Nobody listens to me!

1459
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,120
Look how nobody listens to me about Monopoly!

1460
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,320
You're not having fun doing this, Dokie!

1461
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,380
Shut up, look at this trotty on Twitter!

1462
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,000
Hashtag free my boy, Fillion.

1463
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,820
Let's not, that would be like the fastest way to die.

1464
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,820
Look, I got through double.

1465
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:37,940
There she goes.

1466
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:38,740
There I go!

1467
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,900
Is that a chance card?

1468
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,060
Whoa, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna pay.

1469
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,000
If that's the nearest railroad...

1470
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,040
Oh, another railroad?

1471
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,240
Do I own this?

1472
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:47,880
Fuck, man!

1473
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,240
Oh, I own this!

1474
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,820
This is insane luck!

1475
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,060
Okay, but I don't own... I already own this, so I don't get to buy it.

1476
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,380
Free for a penile fill-in.

1477
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,540
Another double?

1478
00:45:59,280 --> 00:45:59,720
Let's go!

1479
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,280
I hope you go to jail.

1480
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,520
This is fucked up.

1481
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,600
The system is broken.

1482
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:03,660
What is this?

1483
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,180
Wait, is this jail?

1484
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:04,920
Oh, rigs!

1485
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,240
I hate capitalism!

1486
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,840
No, it's another community chest.

1487
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,200
Let's go!

1488
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:08,780
Oh my god!

1489
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,260
This is garbage.

1490
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:09,920
Garbage.

1491
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,360
It's my birthday!

1492
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,200
What the fuck?

1493
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,160
Happy birthday!

1494
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,740
You fucking die!

1495
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,580
Happy birthday!

1496
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,620
Oh my god!

1497
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,180
You fucking liar!

1498
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,280
Thank you guys!

1499
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,420
It's my birthday!

1500
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,240
Yeah, happy 50th.

1501
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,220
Happy 50th.

1502
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,260
I hope you get out of the rabbit hole.

1503
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,460
Dude, I'm gonna get in jail and I bought you a birthday gift.

1504
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:26,720
Okay, nice.

1505
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,500
Alright, thank god.

1506
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,440
Alright, that's good.

1507
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:29,940
Yeah!

1508
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:30,860
I'm fine!

1509
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,680
I got birthday money!

1510
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,660
Let's go!

1511
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,800
I just got birthday money too!

1512
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:36,140
Oh my god.

1513
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,620
Dude, this is so stupid, man!

1514
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,760
Hey, I got two of your doubles, Vilian.

1515
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,820
Maybe you should have paid 50 fucking dollars.

1516
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,080
Why did I get skipped though?

1517
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,080
Why did I get skipped?

1518
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,140
This is madness.

1519
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,320
This could have been you if you paid your fucking money.

1520
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,880
Wait, but I didn't, like... Why did I get to roll again?

1521
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,140
No, you didn't.

1522
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:01,680
You only got to roll once.

1523
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,500
You only got to roll once.

1524
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,620
Oh, you owed money.

1525
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:05,700
You're so nice.

1526
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,280
You're so good to the homeless people.

1527
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:08,600
Yeah.

1528
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,480
Catgirl losing to a little tomato.

1529
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,460
Look, she's giving you another bail option.

1530
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,120
Who is doing this now?

1531
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:16,960
Come on, Vilian.

1532
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,020
I'm not giving you my property, okay?

1533
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,640
Come on, Vilian.

1534
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,340
Sorry, I love my women too much.

1535
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,080
Calm down, Vivian.

1536
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,440
Take it back!

1537
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,700
Dude, I'm not gonna give you my money or my property.

1538
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,360
I need it.

1539
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,220
I'm not asking for your money!

1540
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,340
You're never gonna play, Vilian, if you...

1541
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,460
I'm not a laughing Monopoly god.

1542
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,920
I know that property is worth that much.

1543
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,360
That's a good deal, Vilian.

1544
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,080
No, I know it's worth that much.

1545
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,900
I don't want this.

1546
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,760
I'm not interested.

1547
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,980
That's a good deal.

1548
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,560
I know what I'm worth.

1549
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,280
I know what I'm worth.

1550
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:44,740
You're gonna make a deal?

1551
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:45,780
Yeah, I know what I'm worth.

1552
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,360
Out of commitment?

1553
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,480
She's literally in jail.

1554
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,320
She's scared of everything right now.

1555
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,800
Like, I don't know what's going on in jail, but I'm pretty sure.

1556
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,360
That's shit, so bad.

1557
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,480
Bad shit.

1558
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,680
Okay.

1559
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,880
Changes a person.

1560
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,580
I wonder what the player...

1561
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,920
She just needs more time in jail to finally get desperate.

1562
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,520
Look, everybody's getting doubles except for you, Vilian.

1563
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,140
Yeah.

1564
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,180
Are you even supersizing your menu?

1565
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,480
That says something about you.

1566
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,640
Oh,

1567
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:17,390
nice!

1568
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:18,790
Oh, shit.

1569
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:19,550
I'm gonna go to jail.

1570
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,010
I'm gonna roll a double and get boardwalked.

1571
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:21,430
It's a nice Monopoly.

1572
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:21,910
Bye.

1573
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,110
No more Monopoly.

1574
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,210
Oh, but there's still the green.

1575
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,090
The green's...

1576
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:26,770
Kill me.

1577
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,470
Alright, here's another chance.

1578
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:29,750
Or you can pay $50.

1579
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:30,730
Shut up.

1580
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:31,470
I'm gonna pay.

1581
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:32,550
I'm gonna pay.

1582
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,130
Okay, fine.

1583
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:36,590
Welcome back.

1584
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,210
Welcome back, Vilian.

1585
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,190
Welcome back, Vilian.

1586
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,670
Call it jail time.

1587
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:39,990
How was jail?

1588
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,810
You're a millionaire committing a crime.

1589
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,410
Alright, let me roll my dice.

1590
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,370
Did you enjoy the spam?

1591
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:45,270
Yeah.

1592
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:46,910
Oh, my butt hurts.

1593
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:47,210
See?

1594
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,710
You weren't gonna get a double anyway.

1595
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,750
Hey, look at you.

1596
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,910
You got community checks.

1597
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,770
It would be funny if she goes to the jail again.

1598
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:58,310
Alright.

1599
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,670
If this goes to jail, I'm gonna uninstall.

1600
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,090
Hey, you got $25.

1601
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,530
Consultancy fees.

1602
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,210
Yeah, you got...

1603
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,230
They catered me for advice.

1604
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,590
Who?

1605
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:09,210
Who's they?

1606
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,990
Because they're not taking money from us.

1607
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,510
Who's they?

1608
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,410
My viewers donated $5.

1609
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:16,550
What?

1610
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:19,850
Who owns this?

1611
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,470
$25 to get Vilian out of jail.

1612
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:21,870
Wait.

1613
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,030
Does no one own this?

1614
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:24,630
No, fuck you.

1615
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,030
Oh, my God.

1616
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:26,910
I got more trains.

1617
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,050
Oh, my God.

1618
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,590
I got another railroad.

1619
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,210
I'm gonna kill this bitch.

1620
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:33,730
Guys.

1621
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,710
I'm owning the train.

1622
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,990
I'm owning the train.

1623
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:35,190
Guys.

1624
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,670
I'm gonna buy transportation.

1625
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,790
Hello, fellow unlucky people of the Monopoly board.

1626
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,430
I would like to propose an alliance.

1627
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:44,190
Wait.

1628
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,290
Who are you proposing to?

1629
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,410
I'm proposing an alliance against Doggy Bird.

1630
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:48,890
Me?

1631
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,990
What did I do?

1632
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,970
She's got too much generational wealth.

1633
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,610
I don't like it.

1634
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:53,310
I just owned...

1635
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:55,230
I literally just bought the railroad.

1636
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,150
I feel unsafe.

1637
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,450
What do you mean I made my money?

1638
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,190
You're paying Doggy right now.

1639
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:00,150
It's okay.

1640
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:00,550
It's okay.

1641
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:00,770
It's okay.

1642
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,010
I'm gonna buy Boardwalk right now.

1643
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:03,090
Yeah, okay.

1644
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,130
Yeah, sure.

1645
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,330
And like two turns.

1646
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,350
One is my turn, but you know.

1647
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,290
Yeah, okay.

1648
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,390
Two turns.

1649
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,070
She's gonna get Boardwalk.

1650
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,230
We believe in you.

1651
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,310
Just effing let me cook.

1652
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:14,410
Shit.

1653
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,270
Oh, you get the green.

1654
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,010
That's not owned by anybody.

1655
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:18,450
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1656
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:19,110
Okay, I take it.

1657
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,210
Wait, you're gonna own that Monopoly.

1658
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:20,710
No, dude.

1659
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,030
Oh, wait.

1660
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:24,470
I can have a Monopoly.

1661
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,930
Yeah, you just need the green one.

1662
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:26,550
Pennsylvania.

1663
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:27,410
I have a Monopoly.

1664
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,550
I can get a Monopoly.

1665
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,350
Dude, let me own a property.

1666
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,490
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

1667
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:35,010
I'm gonna scream.

1668
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,470
Eight, is that good or bad?

1669
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:38,310
Whoa, we'll see.

1670
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:38,990
Please.

1671
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,130
Please.

1672
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,470
I think she's gonna have a Monopoly.

1673
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,690
Wait, no.

1674
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,830
She just bought that, didn't she?

1675
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:45,230
Yeah.

1676
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:45,870
Yeah.

1677
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,250
I just bought that.

1678
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:50,650
Oh, god.

1679
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,370
Don't be a bird girl.

1680
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,070
That's just.

1681
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,090
I can bite her.

1682
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:54,210
I can bite her.

1683
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:55,730
He is.

1684
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,430
Excuse me.

1685
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,090
Wait, you have a three, and you have a three.

1686
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:04,830
Do you own any railroad stations?

1687
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,970
Yeah, I do.

1688
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,090
Okay, Lumi, you wanna do an alliance?

1689
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,380
I can own the railroads.

1690
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,050
And you can own the property.

1691
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:15,790
Lumi, shit!

1692
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:21,210
I mean, you should have an alliance because I literally own the one monopoly you own.

1693
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:21,770
Oh my god!

1694
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,090
Oh my god!

1695
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,410
Chad, is this real?

1696
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,670
I offer you...

1697
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:27,810
Lumi, I offer you...

1698
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:32,030
I offer you one red space for your green space.

1699
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:33,190
This is real, Chad.

1700
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:34,870
Alright, you know what?

1701
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:35,850
Yeah, I'll take that deal.

1702
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,030
Okay, okay, okay.

1703
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:37,950
Good deal, good deal.

1704
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,830
Does anyone like giving money?

1705
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,090
This has been one of the best trade deals in American history.

1706
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:42,750
I'm gonna jump.

1707
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:43,930
Hey!

1708
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,610
Wow, this is crazy.

1709
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,610
This is crazy.

1710
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,830
That's insane.

1711
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,330
Oh, okay.

1712
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,290
What are you giving here?

1713
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,070
What do you want from me?

1714
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,070
I'm breaking this alliance.

1715
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,950
I'm gonna do it three times before it starts.

1716
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,170
You're gonna need a lot of power.

1717
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,730
I bet you're attracted to power, actually.

1718
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:10,490
Don't you like that?

1719
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,090
Pippa, do you want to be part of this alliance?

1720
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,130
We can do it three ways.

1721
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,290
Wait, what about this?

1722
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,090
She's disestablishmentarian.

1723
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,850
I believe in the government.

1724
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,650
Or I don't, depending on what you like.

1725
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,610
I need my green monopoly, Pippa.

1726
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,210
Yeah, she can have her green monopoly.

1727
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:30,970
I can have my red monopoly.

1728
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,190
Everybody is happy.

1729
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,850
If you trade away your red, she'll never get the green monopoly.

1730
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,290
And don't you want her to be happy?

1731
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,210
I'll give you an orange if you give me a yellow.

1732
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,030
I'm not in this business meeting, dude.

1733
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,570
I'll give you an orange if you give me a yellow.

1734
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,810
You went to jail.

1735
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,050
You can't be in this business meeting.

1736
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:49,830
You have a record.

1737
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:50,390
I can't.

1738
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,630
You can't let you in right now.

1739
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,450
I can call Wester.

1740
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,580
Someone offer me something?

1741
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,540
If you want, you can either have an orange or a green.

1742
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,020
I'll take the orange.

1743
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,440
You literally have two properties.

1744
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,740
What are you going to offer us?

1745
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,000
I can offer you my love.

1746
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,160
You have two properties.

1747
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,140
This is the problem with America.

1748
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,500
This is the problem with America.

1749
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,600
Okay.

1750
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,740
Do this deal with Halloween.

1751
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,180
Yeah, deal.

1752
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,520
Sure.

1753
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,800
Throw in 50 bucks.

1754
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,040
Do it.

1755
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,100
I'll take it.

1756
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,220
Just do counter offer and then you can make her throw in.

1757
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,580
No, this one is for Pippa.

1758
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:31,940
Thank you.

1759
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:32,860
She needs it right now.

1760
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,400
Shut up.

1761
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,680
Love is Christmas.

1762
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,860
Is it my turn?

1763
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:39,880
No.

1764
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,180
You're after this.

1765
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,500
87 turns and I have zero.

1766
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,940
She was so close to boardwalk.

1767
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,260
She was almost there.

1768
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,520
Someone has to get that.

1769
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,360
Someone has to get that.

1770
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,780
You don't own any.

1771
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,180
You don't own houses or hotels.

1772
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:58,220
Good.

1773
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:58,460
Good.

1774
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:58,660
Good.

1775
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,800
We can trade if you want.

1776
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,140
Yeah, let's trade.

1777
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:01,780
Trade me.

1778
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,240
Trade me.

1779
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:02,780
Trade me.

1780
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,240
You're not part of this conversation.

1781
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,220
Who are you?

1782
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,780
You want the green.

1783
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,060
Yeah.

1784
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,900
And then I'll give you the green.

1785
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:16,500
Okay.

1786
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,940
This is a good trade.

1787
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,560
How do I do it?

1788
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,500
Press it and then enter.

1789
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:21,740
Add.

1790
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,140
Nice.

1791
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:22,660
Yeah.

1792
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,340
And then...

1793
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,960
You know what?

1794
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,020
If you're generous right now, I'll give you that deal.

1795
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,360
Thank you.

1796
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:30,780
Thank you.

1797
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:31,940
Wow.

1798
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,240
Thank you.

1799
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,040
Oh, sorry.

1800
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:34,400
Deal.

1801
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:34,820
Yes.

1802
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,680
Wow.

1803
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,500
Accept.

1804
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,400
I'm happy with this monopoly.

1805
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,180
I'm happy with this monopoly as well.

1806
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,600
Yes.

1807
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,600
The first monopoly, guys.

1808
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,620
What is wrong?

1809
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,280
I can build houses.

1810
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,180
Woo!

1811
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,060
Alright.

1812
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,340
Get ready to enter.

1813
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,580
I can't build anything.

1814
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,160
It's my turn.

1815
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:57,900
It's your turn.

1816
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,800
You guys hurry up.

1817
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,620
Get on the property.

1818
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,220
I'm not about to spend the next 2 hours screaming over being broke.

1819
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,760
Oh hey, thank you again for the water.

1820
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:14,420
I mean, people need a shower, so it's understandable, Fillian, that you need a shower.

1821
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,800
I have a very special set of skills.

1822
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,720
It's very, very nice of you.

1823
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,460
And I will give you a hug in real life.

1824
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,500
Oh, nice.

1825
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,260
You're welcome.

1826
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,660
With a shotgun.

1827
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,500
In the shower.

1828
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,060
In the shower.

1829
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,260
There's your water bills, bitch.

1830
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:40,140
I'll take the water that I paid 15 bucks for and give it back to you.

1831
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,660
And then I'll ask for a refund.

1832
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,060
Now I can see why Fillion went to jail, guys.

1833
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,960
Why?

1834
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,280
She's a dangerous axe murderer.

1835
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,700
I went to jail because I paid back my crime.

1836
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,680
She's a dangerous society.

1837
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,940
I'm not.

1838
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,040
I'm a danger to myself.

1839
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,520
Oh, doubles.

1840
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,720
I got a double.

1841
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,760
Does anyone own that?

1842
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,520
Just so you guys know, I have more money than all of you.

1843
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,620
Yeah, because you never bought anything.

1844
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,360
So?

1845
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,100
No!

1846
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,460
I have to pay 200.

1847
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,720
I have to pay taxes.

1848
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,280
I didn't even lost.

1849
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,580
That's crazy.

1850
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,400
I'm too rich now.

1851
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,520
I got to the next tax bracket.

1852
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,600
That's what you said about my property.

1853
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,100
Now I'm gonna be visiting.

1854
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,400
I'm gonna visit jail.

1855
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,200
Yo, tell her to be high.

1856
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:35,920
Alright.

1857
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,180
I can't believe it.

1858
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,640
I fucking... I went to the next tax bracket.

1859
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,020
She's looking at the less fortunate people to remind her of how she came up.

1860
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,840
I was trying to remind myself to be like, I'll never be like Fillion.

1861
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:50,960
Okay.

1862
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,880
I'm a robot.

1863
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,040
Nice, Peppa.

1864
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,640
Nice, Peppa.

1865
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,000
Oh, you got Monopoly too.

1866
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,120
We all got Monopoly.

1867
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,320
Yeah!

1868
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,960
We all got Monopoly now.

1869
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:06,740
Yeah!

1870
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,280
All three of us.

1871
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,840
Wait,

1872
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,180
Doggy.

1873
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:20,920
Do you want to trade me water?

1874
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,000
No.

1875
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,800
At least give me a chance.

1876
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,620
I know you have to pay.

1877
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,160
I have nothing I want.

1878
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,240
I got eliminated on M-stream and I don't win any.

1879
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,500
You literally have nothing I want.

1880
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,320
I have a railroad!

1881
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,320
Oh, you get to go back and go again.

1882
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,720
You reset itself.

1883
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,460
Hey, look at that.

1884
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,560
You got $400.

1885
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,160
Money.

1886
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,360
I like how nobody has landed on Boardwalk yet.

1887
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,200
No.

1888
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,880
This might be Fillion's chance.

1889
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:56,260
I believe in you, Fillion.

1890
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,000
You know, there have to be poor people to remind us about the poor people, Cheetah.

1891
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:01,940
I know, you're right.

1892
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,360
Fillion's like the one who reminds us where we started.

1893
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,660
Oh, look, you got community chairs.

1894
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,860
Oh, you don't have to pay.

1895
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,040
You don't own anything.

1896
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,580
So you don't have to pay.

1897
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,700
Oh, she's too poor.

1898
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,600
She doesn't even have taxes to pay.

1899
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,440
Yeah.

1900
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:26,240
I mean, it's nice that she finds pleasure in the little things.

1901
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,060
Yeah.

1902
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,480
She's here to remind us about that.

1903
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,380
Cheetah, you do have a chance.

1904
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,780
What is this?

1905
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,520
Oh, is this an art community chest?

1906
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,020
Oh my god.

1907
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,340
Nobody's getting these last two years.

1908
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:40,640
Nobody.

1909
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,600
Oh my god, get a jump-free card.

1910
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,520
Cheetah, you want to trade?

1911
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,820
This is truly a privilege of the rich.

1912
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,480
Yeah, I'll trade.

1913
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,860
That is such a rich privilege.

1914
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,480
I'll give you $50.

1915
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,640
No, that's not worth $50.

1916
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,020
I'll give you $60.

1917
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,080
I'll give you $69.

1918
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,780
Keep going up.

1919
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,400
All you have is money.

1920
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,820
Yeah, all you have is money.

1921
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,680
Wait, she's ready.

1922
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,000
Oh, thank god.

1923
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,520
I still have a chance.

1924
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,600
Oh, you luxury tax.

1925
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,620
Pippa bought so many nice things.

1926
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,960
Wait, you're about to go broke, nerd.

1927
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,740
Until you land on my square.

1928
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,920
How does it feel?

1929
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,720
You're gonna land on my houses and you're gonna be like, Oh, I'm so sorry, Pippa.

1930
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,220
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1931
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:26,540
Let's go.

1932
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,200
Bye.

1933
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,520
Bye, that shit.

1934
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,220
Hell yeah.

1935
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,200
Mods.

1936
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,460
Your mods can't help you now, Fillion.

1937
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,380
Okay.

1938
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:35,820
Okay.

1939
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,520
I just need to get a 1, 2, 3...

1940
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,160
I need a 4 or a 6.

1941
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,260
If I get a 4 or a 6, I am more Barack than Obama.

1942
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,560
She is literally...

1943
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,460
She's gonna be back.

1944
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,980
Are you kidding me?

1945
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:52,580
Wow.

1946
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,980
I'm getting assholes.

1947
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:55,240
I'm getting assholes.

1948
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:55,900
I'm getting assholes.

1949
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,360
She's not back.

1950
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,960
She is not back at all.

1951
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,560
Hey, Fillion, you know you're supposed to buy the land, right?

1952
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:05,720
Yeah.

1953
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,340
Wait, how much property does she have?

1954
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,420
I don't think Indians have rights.

1955
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,480
Just 3.

1956
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,460
Wait, she's preventing you from getting a monopoly, Lumi.

1957
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,440
You should trade with her.

1958
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,600
Oh, hey, Fillion.

1959
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,560
What up?

1960
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,940
Maybe what you're offering, sister.

1961
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,580
I'll give you...

1962
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,880
I'll give you the blue spot.

1963
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,620
I'll give you that little light blue one.

1964
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,360
Okay.

1965
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,400
Wait, make the deal.

1966
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,120
Give me a deal, dog.

1967
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,120
Which one are you?

1968
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:31,820
You're the dog or the hat?

1969
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,260
I'm the hat.

1970
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,140
Alright, hat.

1971
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,620
I think make an offer.

1972
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,560
Alright, here's my offer.

1973
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,320
Don't forget, I'm on the left.

1974
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,800
You give me this orange thing.

1975
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,360
Okay, you want my orange thing?

1976
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,380
4.

1977
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,120
And then I give you...

1978
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,680
How do I fucking do it?

1979
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:48,540
Motherfucker.

1980
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,060
You give me the blue one.

1981
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:51,300
And then what?

1982
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,900
How do I do it?

1983
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,600
Oh, not so easy now, is it?

1984
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,100
My thumb doesn't work.

1985
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,640
My thumb doesn't work.

1986
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,280
You hover over to yourself.

1987
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,740
That's how you do it.

1988
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,120
I'll give you this blue thing.

1989
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,060
There you go.

1990
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,060
You are such a nerd.

1991
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,320
I'll throw in a hundred dollars.

1992
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,740
So you can get out of jail twice.

1993
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,400
No, no.

1994
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:15,840
I want two hundred.

1995
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,920
You should take the money, Fillion.

1996
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:19,980
I'll give you two hundred.

1997
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,740
I'm giving you two monopolies.

1998
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,000
No, I said two hundred.

1999
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:23,760
I said...

2000
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,800
You have way too much money.

2001
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,760
I'm not going bankrupt.

2002
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,860
You're never getting a property.

2003
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,020
I'm giving you a property.

2004
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,200
I don't.

2005
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:34,780
Yeah, I know.

2006
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,880
And you're getting a second.

2007
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,500
Here's the plan.

2008
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,880
We wait until Fillion gets bankrupt.

2009
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,140
And then you can take the property for free.

2010
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,120
Fillion, look.

2011
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,960
I know you're not good at investing.

2012
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,080
But I promise.

2013
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,000
If I give you this property, you'll have a chance to survive.

2014
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:49,880
Shut up, dog.

2015
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,400
I said two hundred.

2016
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,960
I said two hundred.

2017
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:54,200
I know.

2018
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,120
Look.

2019
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,200
You didn't go to school.

2020
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,520
This is hard to drive.

2021
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,500
You owe me money.

2022
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,460
You owe me money.

2023
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,380
Investments, Fillion.

2024
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,720
I said give me two hundred.

2025
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,220
I said two hundred.

2026
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,580
She's a lost cause.

2027
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,620
Don't help her.

2028
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,120
I said two hundred.

2029
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,900
She's gonna drag you down, Lumi.

2030
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,180
She's gonna make you go down and back to jail.

2031
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,960
I'll give her two hundred.

2032
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,460
No, Lumi.

2033
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,240
Listen to her.

2034
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,580
I'll give her two hundred.

2035
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:21,960
It's fine.

2036
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,020
What's she gonna do with it besides pay her monopolies?

2037
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:25,560
You're getting scammed.

2038
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,340
No, this will pay off in the long run.

2039
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,060
I have faith.

2040
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,000
I'll give you two hundred and one dollars.

2041
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,780
When she goes on an egomaniacal rampage because she has a monopoly?

2042
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,140
She'll probably just trip on her treadmill.

2043
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:40,500
She's three blue squares.

2044
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,500
I'm only gonna own two.

2045
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,780
She's just gonna trip on her fucking treadmill again.

2046
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:45,900
Are you guys done?

2047
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,320
Okay, I want two hundred and five for that joke.

2048
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:47,960
No, motherfucker!

2049
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,560
I want two hundred and five now.

2050
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,340
She's just asking and asking and asking.

2051
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:55,840
No, no, no.

2052
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,480
Don't do it, Lumi.

2053
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,460
No, not interested.

2054
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,040
Not interested.

2055
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,120
No, fuck you.

2056
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,720
She needs to be put in her place.

2057
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,000
That's fine.

2058
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,160
Half of a hotdog?

2059
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,420
Half of a hotdog.

2060
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,780
She's a lost cause.

2061
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,440
You can't keep stupid.

2062
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,520
I'm gonna roll one right now.

2063
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,020
Check this out.

2064
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,180
Alright, do it.

2065
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,360
Nice roll.

2066
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,240
Nice roll.

2067
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,600
Alright, my turn.

2068
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:21,840
Yay!

2069
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,420
I'm so fucking scared every time Doki rolls the dice.

2070
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,920
Why are you guys scared?

2071
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,540
She's got everything.

2072
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:29,380
Oh no!

2073
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:30,420
Who's this?

2074
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,940
It's Pippa!

2075
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,360
Holy shit!

2076
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,920
Now I'm scared.

2077
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,240
Fuck!

2078
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,200
I don't like this Pippa Monopoly.

2079
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,860
Pippa has a Monopoly now.

2080
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:44,420
She's getting rich.

2081
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,780
She was the hidden...

2082
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,740
The secret...

2083
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,100
You could have prevented this.

2084
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,440
This is all your fault, Fillion.

2085
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,960
She was the secret business mongrel.

2086
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:52,640
It's all your fault.

2087
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,420
This was Fillion's fault, yeah.

2088
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,180
Why am I an epic McDonald's employee, dude?

2089
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,820
I just... what are these rolls, dude?

2090
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:02,960
What?

2091
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,780
And she gets 150?

2092
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,760
She was the hidden!

2093
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,140
The capipalism is so fucking strong today.

2094
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:11,780
Don't like this.

2095
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,880
Wait, can I manage my properties?

2096
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,060
I managed my properties.

2097
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,020
Manage...

2098
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,040
I should have managed my properties too.

2099
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,340
Oh my god, it's so much money.

2100
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:22,960
Sure.

2101
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,880
Wait, how do I do it?

2102
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,460
It's shift?

2103
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:26,680
Yeah.

2104
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,520
Oh my god, it's so fucking expensive!

2105
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:29,640
It is.

2106
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:30,820
Jesus.

2107
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:32,000
Okay, I'm just gonna play.

2108
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,580
Cause I still got properties to buy.

2109
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,240
Wait.

2110
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,160
Fuck.

2111
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,200
Seven?

2112
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:39,900
Where's seven?

2113
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,040
Oh, yeah, it's a dragon!

2114
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,640
Oh, it's fine, it's fine.

2115
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,180
Someone should hurry and own this.

2116
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,820
No, you go stay high on my phone, my boy.

2117
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,020
You know, keep me humble, that's all.

2118
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,980
Keep me humble.

2119
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,540
You go stay high on my phone.

2120
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:56,000
I will buy another property.

2121
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,200
But you're gonna be broke.

2122
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,640
You're gonna be broke soon, Lumi.

2123
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,300
It should be fine, it should be fine.

2124
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,560
Oh my god, how do I do this?

2125
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,660
What are you doing?

2126
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,540
You go back, back.

2127
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,640
Headbang for content reasons.

2128
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,540
Okay, my turn.

2129
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,880
My turn, my turn!

2130
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,620
I'm gonna roll a one.

2131
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,640
You can't, you literally can't.

2132
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,060
You literally can't even roll a one.

2133
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,440
I'm on my way!

2134
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:21,980
To tomato town.

2135
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,600
What is this, what is this, what is this?

2136
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:25,340
Fuck.

2137
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,480
You owe $200.

2138
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,680
Wow, what a time, Billy.

2139
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:36,580
Stop!

2140
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,300
Please, please, please, please, Billy, please.

2141
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:39,780
Great job.

2142
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,200
Please, please, please.

2143
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,960
When was the last time you bought property, by the way?

2144
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,460
What is this?

2145
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,380
Like her second turn of the game.

2146
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:50,720
Oh, I can roll again.

2147
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,420
Great, okay.

2148
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,300
Wow, I sure can't wait to land on a railroad.

2149
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,780
Hey look, you can't land on a railroad.

2150
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,760
You can't get one.

2151
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,680
You get to visit Jailer's World!

2152
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:01,580
Hey!

2153
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,000
Hey, you just visiting your friend's village?

2154
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,680
I'm gonna shake you in a jail cell and I'm never gonna find you.

2155
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,660
I'm gonna shake you in a jail cell and I'm never gonna find you.

2156
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,940
You're just visiting!

2157
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,520
There's guards around you!

2158
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,480
There's guards, Billy!

2159
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,640
I'm a level 7 rogue and I took soccer feet off my feet.

2160
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,360
I feel unsafe.

2161
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,740
I feel like I'm gonna die.

2162
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:20,960
Yeah, I feel unsafe.

2163
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,460
Who owns this?

2164
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,620
Nobody owns it.

2165
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,860
Oh, no, you own it!

2166
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,880
Oh, I gave you that.

2167
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,480
Remember, I gave you this.

2168
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:31,680
Yeah, you did.

2169
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,540
So, wait, guys, did I promise?

2170
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,360
If I'm gonna jump over what I did for you...

2171
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:38,720
You'll bail me out?

2172
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,400
I wonder, like, where's my...

2173
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,880
I would bail Doki out.

2174
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,660
Yeah, I bailed out.

2175
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,580
This is a Pheebs thing, you know?

2176
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,160
I put a whole new thing.

2177
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:47,600
What about, like, a Fillion thing?

2178
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,120
No, you're not included.

2179
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,100
You're not included.

2180
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,060
You were in jail.

2181
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,240
My blood pressure is so high, I'm about to burst a basket.

2182
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,800
Guys, there's a potential where I might go bankrupt.

2183
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,680
You cannot tell me this game is based on skill.

2184
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:03,880
You cannot tell me this game is based on skill.

2185
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,780
It's all skill.

2186
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,660
It's all skill.

2187
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,660
It's all about investing.

2188
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,280
It's not.

2189
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:07,700
It's not.

2190
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,080
It's not.

2191
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,820
You would understand if you went to school.

2192
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:10,800
Okay, Lumi.

2193
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,380
Lumi.

2194
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,840
You wanna trade or not?

2195
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,520
Yeah, yeah, let's do the trade.

2196
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,600
Okay, we'll do the trade on your next turn.

2197
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,380
You give me the orange, I give you the blue.

2198
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:18,980
Okay.

2199
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,100
We'll do it.

2200
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:21,480
We'll do it.

2201
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,020
We'll do it.

2202
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,740
Oh my god, Pippa's all in on her Monopoly.

2203
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,620
That's fucking scary.

2204
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,440
I don't like that.

2205
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,480
Yeah, she has a... she has a scary Monopoly right now.

2206
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,160
Wooo.

2207
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,460
Where is she going?

2208
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,060
Where is she going?

2209
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:38,880
Oh!

2210
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,760
God damn it.

2211
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,900
What comes around goes around.

2212
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:41,440
Oh!

2213
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,620
You got me!

2214
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,320
What is happening?

2215
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,680
You really went too much!

2216
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,280
Oh, shit.

2217
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,200
That's what you get.

2218
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,460
What do you want?

2219
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,140
Taliyah, I'll come and make a deal.

2220
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,740
Okay, what's the deal?

2221
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:00,760
Tell me now.

2222
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,900
Look, and this is how it goes.

2223
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,520
And this is how it goes.

2224
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:06,300
Oh, yeah, stay in the office.

2225
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,920
You offered me a property and you want...

2226
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:09,360
She's a fucking loan shark.

2227
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:10,840
What do you want?

2228
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,540
What do you want from me?

2229
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,120
Okay, you can stop.

2230
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:13,440
Stop.

2231
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,740
A little more, Pippa.

2232
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,160
A little more.

2233
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:18,300
You don't have to pay for it.

2234
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:18,580
She's desperate.

2235
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,220
No, she's so desperate.

2236
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,140
It's so hard.

2237
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,040
It's one night and night.

2238
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:22,360
Let me negotiate.

2239
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,180
Let me negotiate.

2240
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,420
You can literally ask for more money.

2241
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,780
Let me negotiate.

2242
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,800
You know she wants a property.

2243
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,200
She's so fucking desperate.

2244
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,900
You have to ask for more.

2245
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,960
I know everything we do for the business and I can make sure you're a millionaire.

2246
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,820
You know she'll say yes if you ask for more money.

2247
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:39,780
You don't have to pay it.

2248
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,140
She's offering more.

2249
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,460
We got property!

2250
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:46,840
More!

2251
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,700
Get a hundred though.

2252
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,480
Hell yeah.

2253
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,020
I overpay much, but it's fine.

2254
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,100
Let me not touch Pippa's land.

2255
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:57,860
It freaks me out.

2256
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,140
She's gonna shoot me with a shotgun.

2257
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,160
I will.

2258
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,820
Who is it?

2259
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:03,600
Motherfucker!

2260
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,380
Thank god!

2261
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,360
I was honestly scared.

2262
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,340
I was gonna go bankrupt.

2263
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,960
But everything seems to go well.

2264
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,060
Okay, let's trade.

2265
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,260
Let's trade, Lumi.

2266
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,820
It all comes back to you.

2267
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,940
You're such a good old fill-in.

2268
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,600
It all comes back to you.

2269
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,780
I'll give you Connecticut Ave.

2270
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,380
Just because of railroads?

2271
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,020
Railroads aren't even a monopoly.

2272
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:26,120
You can't monopolize railroads.

2273
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,460
This country was built on railroads, Doki.

2274
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:32,240
This country was built on the backbone of our whole society.

2275
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,040
I'm Canadian.

2276
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:33,700
Chat!

2277
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:38,600
What the fuck?

2278
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:39,940
What the fuck?

2279
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,840
Can I miss $2?

2280
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,400
I threw that troll too hard.

2281
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:46,420
T-shut up.

2282
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:47,740
Motherfucker.

2283
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,980
Whatever, man.

2284
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,680
I f-ing leave.

2285
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,320
Thank you!

2286
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:57,020
If I get the last blue one, I promise I'll give it to you.

2287
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,220
Shut up.

2288
01:09:58,980 --> 01:09:59,420
Never mind.

2289
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,440
I love you.

2290
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,720
She insulted you after you traded with her.

2291
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:04,700
No, no, no.

2292
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,180
I didn't say shit.

2293
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,260
I just spoke with my...

2294
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,820
I just spoke with my...my brain spoke before I did.

2295
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:11,200
Sorry.

2296
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:13,980
I broke my dipstick.

2297
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,860
I don't think you should put more property.

2298
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:23,720
You have like $100.

2299
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:27,260
The moment you land on another...

2300
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,500
Can someone land on a space please?

2301
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:30,900
That's me!

2302
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,760
It's your turn.

2303
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,260
Chat, watch me roll boardwalk.

2304
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,900
I think you're way too far.

2305
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,000
You're way too far from boardwalk.

2306
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,940
Welcome to the deck, baby.

2307
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,220
Look at everybody using my railroad.

2308
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:50,340
Donkey, donkey, donkey.

2309
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,220
You know I'm rich, right?

2310
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,720
I give you the 100, you trade me back, I owe you one.

2311
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,520
Yeah, but why are you going to trade for it?

2312
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,420
I want a property.

2313
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:01,400
I don't want a property.

2314
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,100
I don't want a property.

2315
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:03,340
Two fold.

2316
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:05,460
Right?

2317
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,960
I want a property, Fillion.

2318
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:09,480
Okay, sorry.

2319
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:13,020
I love my family and my wife and I can't afford to feed them without them.

2320
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,100
I can give it to you.

2321
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:14,560
What?

2322
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,600
Over time.

2323
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,880
But you're not the trustee.

2324
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,120
But if you trade them away...

2325
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,540
You trade your family away, you never have to feed them again.

2326
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,520
Okay, but here's the thing.

2327
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,160
Here's the thing.

2328
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,940
I only love my mom and my bed.

2329
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,660
I'm sorry.

2330
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,300
Oh my god.

2331
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,920
So I will trade you back eventually.

2332
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:28,380
How old are you, man?

2333
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,080
Who crashed?

2334
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:31,480
Let me...

2335
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,760
Wait, shit, shit, shit.

2336
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:34,500
You crashed?

2337
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,880
No, somebody crashed.

2338
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,340
Oh wait, nobody crashed?

2339
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:37,980
No, you just tabbed out.

2340
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,100
Oh, you tabbed out.

2341
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:39,400
Okay, okay.

2342
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,400
Donkey, you're going to pay me back.

2343
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:40,420
I tabbed out.

2344
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:40,660
Yeah, yeah.

2345
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,640
Donkey, you're going to pay me back.

2346
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,300
You're going to pay me back.

2347
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,240
No deal.

2348
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,040
No deal.

2349
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:44,440
We trade.

2350
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,100
We trade.

2351
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:45,300
We trade.

2352
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:45,940
No deal.

2353
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:46,360
We trade.

2354
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:46,980
No deal, affiliate.

2355
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,300
Someone put an end to it for me.

2356
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,540
No deal.

2357
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,420
Somebody quit looking for me.

2358
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,160
Yay!

2359
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,320
I was so scared.

2360
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,420
Okay, she can't get the blues.

2361
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,200
Don't worry, we're still safe on Boardwalk.

2362
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,040
Yeah, Boardwalk is still safe.

2363
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,240
Boardwalk is not.

2364
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:05,860
I got it.

2365
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,860
Is this the loomy?

2366
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,640
Aw, it's the loomy territory.

2367
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,020
Yay!

2368
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:10,700
Oh, it's $4.

2369
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:11,640
Oh, thank god.

2370
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,280
Nice!

2371
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:12,920
You know what?

2372
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,560
You gave me $100, I'll give you $4.

2373
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,960
Thanks, thanks, Donkey.

2374
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:17,360
Thanks.

2375
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,500
I appreciate it.

2376
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:22,320
Hey, yeah, what's $4 between friends?

2377
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,740
Exactly, right?

2378
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,480
Pippa, roll a four.

2379
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,120
Shit!

2380
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,580
Pippa, you just touched me.

2381
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:32,560
Nine.

2382
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,000
Wait, I said three!

2383
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,300
Human doppelgangers gotta stick together.

2384
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,700
Wait, we're getting more money, bro.

2385
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,720
Wait, who the fuck is this?

2386
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:39,300
Oh, that's me!

2387
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,140
That's the one I put a house on!

2388
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:41,820
What?

2389
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:42,160
What?

2390
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:42,280
What?

2391
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,140
That's the 100!

2392
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:44,420
I made one!

2393
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:47,460
All I'm saying, Pippa, is you allied with the wrong person!

2394
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,100
I made one!

2395
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:49,140
No, no, no, no, no!

2396
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,680
Chad, are we cooked?

2397
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,200
Chad, are we cooked?

2398
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,000
Shit, we're fucked in this game.

2399
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:55,280
I just...

2400
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,100
She's the only one with a house, too.

2401
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:57,460
She's the only one with the house, too.

2402
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:58,480
She's rich in the B-I-O-0 property!

2403
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,500
She's rich in the B-I-O-0 property!

2404
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,180
Oh my god!

2405
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:01,340
Oh, my god!

2406
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:02,580
I fucking hate this shit.

2407
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,620
I fucking hate this.

2408
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,420
I'm actually going to blow up this fucking chain.

2409
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,000
Oh my god!

2410
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,940
I'm not gonna blow up this fucking train.

2411
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,500
Oh my god, I was broke and now I'm rich!

2412
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,900
I'm blowing up this train.

2413
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,260
Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.

2414
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,520
Boardwalk, boardwalk, boardwalk, I'm charging up my dice.

2415
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:16,420
YIKED!

2416
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:20,480
Look, all I'm saying to me is that we gotta stick together.

2417
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:22,460
We do, we do.

2418
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:24,880
I'll give you whatever free change we got, man.

2419
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,640
Are you gonna land on another railroad?

2420
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,380
Nice, William!

2421
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:28,960
Nice!

2422
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:29,800
Welcome!

2423
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,500
Welcome to the train station, William.

2424
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,980
Welcome to my train station.

2425
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,440
Alright, I watched the Constance Wilds.

2426
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,580
Who would've thought owning transportation was like the way to go?

2427
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,380
Who would've thought?

2428
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,080
I don't wanna get off Mr. Bones' wild ride.

2429
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,320
Okay, bump and roll again.

2430
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,360
Watch, boardwalk.

2431
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,280
Bop!

2432
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,240
Oh hey, snake eyes.

2433
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:49,940
Double!

2434
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,520
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over.

2435
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,340
Oh my god!

2436
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,100
Fitbit, look, you got saved from bankruptcy!

2437
01:13:59,720 --> 01:13:59,900
Hi!

2438
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,060
You did it!

2439
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,380
Oh, you scared me.

2440
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,080
Welcome back, Ginga.

2441
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:06,460
Thank you, Fillion.

2442
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,980
Welcome back.

2443
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,200
Fillion, would you like to make a deal?

2444
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,400
Fillion?

2445
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,120
I don't think Fillion is okay.

2446
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,220
I think she's like...

2447
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:25,600
I think she regrets suggesting Monopoly as her collab game.

2448
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,880
Is that her neck breaking?

2449
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,820
I think it's great that Fillion is like our piggy bank.

2450
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:36,660
You know?

2451
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,060
Like...

2452
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:37,440
Yeah!

2453
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,280
She's like a loan shark but without the muscle.

2454
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:42,140
Yeah, yeah.

2455
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,980
So like, she's not a shark, she's like a...

2456
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,320
She's like...

2457
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,580
She's like a loan ant.

2458
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:49,040
Wait, what the fuck?

2459
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,080
You got three doubles, Fillion?

2460
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:53,700
No, she got... she was lucky and got out of jail.

2461
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,140
Who's that over there?

2462
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:56,840
What's over there?

2463
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,520
No, she just missed it.

2464
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:58,900
Oh, she got...

2465
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,060
You know, if you hit that railroad, you could've...

2466
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,980
Cut me from having the last railroad.

2467
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:03,640
You could've just straightened the Monopoly.

2468
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,360
Yeah.

2469
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,220
You were the chosen one, Fillion.

2470
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,320
You fucking ruined it all.

2471
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,840
You could've stopped me from Monopoly on the trains.

2472
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,660
Someone press enter for me.

2473
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,360
Why'd you pass that up?

2474
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,600
Someone press enter.

2475
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,860
Why can't you advance...

2476
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:15,160
Oh!

2477
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,760
She got board... she can't afford boardwalk!

2478
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,680
Because she's cheating points!

2479
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:20,160
With what?

2480
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:20,560
Money?

2481
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,520
Money is weird.

2482
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,660
This is crazy!

2483
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,960
She can't afford it!

2484
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,360
No one's gonna get it!

2485
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,520
This is crazy!

2486
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,800
This is crazy!

2487
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,020
This is crazy!

2488
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,820
I spent my entire life shooting for boardwalk!

2489
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,420
You can't even afford it!

2490
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,300
It's time for the auction!

2491
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:40,840
Pippa win this!

2492
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,240
Pippa!

2493
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,560
Pippa win this!

2494
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:44,900
Wait, wait!

2495
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,260
Okay, I'll bid, I'll bid, I'll bid, I'll bid.

2496
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,580
You can only bid like...

2497
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,940
You can't even afford it!

2498
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:52,440
No!

2499
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:56,390
I draw!

2500
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,230
You have to withdraw!

2501
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:58,950
Please, please, please!

2502
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:01,970
You have no money!

2503
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,070
Please, please, please!

2504
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:04,810
I'll do anything!

2505
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,290
Please!

2506
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,170
You don't have to fucking...

2507
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:06,830
Just withdraw!

2508
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,310
You can't afford it!

2509
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:10,630
Let me play bro!

2510
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:12,030
Let me play bro!

2511
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:14,950
What is this shit?

2512
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:27,400
I did the billion!

2513
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,080
The billion!

2514
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:29,720
Yay!

2515
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,040
This is your fault!

2516
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:31,380
This is your fault!

2517
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,900
Fillion, thanks for giving me boardwalk!

2518
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,340
This is your fault, Fillion!

2519
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,420
I really appreciate it, Fillion!

2520
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:36,200
I didn't discount who...

2521
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,080
I didn't discount who...

2522
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,320
This is absolutely your fault, Fillion!

2523
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,200
I told you guys to not ally with her!

2524
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,180
I told you guys!

2525
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,740
I'm like DJ Khaled and people didn't make him famous!

2526
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:46,780
Nobody believed me!

2527
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,080
I said like it's not... we shouldn't... we shouldn't alliance with her, guys!

2528
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,900
I'm putting one of us down here again!

2529
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:53,580
I'm not going!

2530
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,400
And I'm gonna have an epic netbook and show!

2531
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,340
Like, I can't do this, dude!

2532
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,760
I can't do this!

2533
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,720
How are we supposed to get more money in this game?

2534
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,420
We're just gonna bankrupt ourselves in the next three turns!

2535
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,420
Alright, let's see...

2536
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,380
What am I gonna do?

2537
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,320
I wanna put a house...

2538
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,280
I wanna put a house in Indiana!

2539
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,900
Welcome to poverty, baby!

2540
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,040
Land, bridge, press, core!

2541
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,180
Where's my comeback angle?

2542
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,520
Oh, I got another die roll!

2543
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,000
Let's go!

2544
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,560
Yay!

2545
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,280
You're just so bad!

2546
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,420
This game is not even luck!

2547
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:26,160
Who's this?

2548
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:26,980
Who's this?

2549
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,260
Oh, Fillion, you can sell your property to Doki!

2550
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:28,520
Oh, hey!

2551
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,120
I love you so much, Doki!

2552
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,600
Oh my fucking god!

2553
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,940
Sell it to Doki for some money for you!

2554
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,780
Yeah, Fillion, you wanna sell me this property, Fillion?

2555
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,340
I'm gonna cross-bill and get you a...

2556
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:39,720
Pull yourself up by a bullet...

2557
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,360
Yeah, yeah, you wanna sell that property?

2558
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:42,720
I'll buy that property!

2559
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:43,180
No, no!

2560
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,920
I'm gonna pass Gogg like $200 and I'll build a kingdom with it!

2561
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,020
Yeah, yeah, alright!

2562
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,020
Sure!

2563
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,560
I play roll for the world, but I can start from nothing!

2564
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,400
All I'm saying is Fillion's been coping for a very long time!

2565
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,860
Okay, yeah, I like drugs, what about it?

2566
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:56,620
This game is good for your sanity.

2567
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,580
You guys like vultures!

2568
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,160
You're African Pringle my grave or you're gonna steal whatever's left of me for as cheap as you can get it?

2569
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,560
You guys are cursing!

2570
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,140
Holy shit!

2571
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,760
Oh my god, we should not land on Pippa's spot!

2572
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,560
We should not land on any of Pippa's spot!

2573
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,800
You're fucking dead if you do!

2574
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:09,160
You're actually fucked!

2575
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,800
I'm saying, Fillion, if you land on Pippa's square, I think you actually have to declare bankruptcy!

2576
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,420
Thank god!

2577
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,280
Thank you, people!

2578
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,420
Thank you!

2579
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,020
Thank you!

2580
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:23,500
Yay!

2581
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,600
I can get out of jail now!

2582
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,700
I know you're poor, you needed it!

2583
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:28,420
I'm a player of 4, Chad!

2584
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,340
Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean!

2585
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:31,380
Yeah...

2586
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:32,980
This...

2587
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:33,860
I've been on top times!

2588
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,120
What's that over there?

2589
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:34,640
Double?

2590
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,020
Wait, is that my square?

2591
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,340
Does that mean you land on Norwalk?

2592
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:37,740
No!

2593
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:38,060
Oh!

2594
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,740
You just missed it!

2595
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,560
But you pay it with your attacks!

2596
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,200
You're next to me!

2597
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:43,220
Oh my god!

2598
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,080
You're a 100!

2599
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,020
You...

2600
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:46,820
Fillion...

2601
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:48,180
Fillion...

2602
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:48,200
Fillion...

2603
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,080
Stop!

2604
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:52,020
Stop negotiating with her!

2605
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,780
I will give you a free pass!

2606
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:54,940
Pippa, give me something!

2607
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:56,720
Donkey?

2608
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:57,180
Pippa!

2609
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,240
No!

2610
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,420
Okay, I owe you my life.

2611
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:01,960
Yeah?

2612
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:02,880
Okay.

2613
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:03,120
Okay, I'm gonna go.

2614
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:03,980
Okay, I could save you.

2615
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:04,800
I'm giving you what I owe you.

2616
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:05,440
Yeah...

2617
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,280
Okay, yeah...

2618
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,760
You can give that to me!

2619
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:08,560
Give that to me, Pippa!

2620
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,140
Give it to me!

2621
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,100
Give it to me, Pippa!

2622
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:10,620
You owe me!

2623
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,340
You owe me!

2624
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:11,700
You owe me!

2625
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,040
You owe me!

2626
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:12,300
You owe me!

2627
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:12,560
You owe me!

2628
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:12,620
You owe me!

2629
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:13,800
You owe me!

2630
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:15,300
You owe me!

2631
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:15,860
You owe me!

2632
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:16,820
You owe me!

2633
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:17,460
Please, Pippa!

2634
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:18,060
Please!

2635
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,540
Come back, Pippa!

2636
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:21,560
You don't even need you!

2637
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,000
Still medicine?

2638
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,260
You don't even need you...

2639
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:26,080
To be honest, I'm going to have a go, and kiss my girlfriend.

2640
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:27,020
So...

2641
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,160
I found a new leader.

2642
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,380
It's over.

2643
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,440
You're done with you, Flynn.

2644
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,160
You're done with...

2645
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,420
You're dead on Twitch.

2646
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,520
She's done with you, Flynn.

2647
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,520
She's done with you.

2648
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,700
I cancelled the YouTube rewards.

2649
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,260
Sorry.

2650
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,740
Freak this junk.

2651
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,880
Alicia, why are we all so fucking poor?

2652
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,720
I'm going to put my headset.

2653
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:55,900
Okay.

2654
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,940
I have over a billion.

2655
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,580
Your allies are all gone.

2656
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,080
My allies?

2657
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:01,480
Okay.

2658
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,020
What is that?

2659
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,320
A strategic battle in the west?

2660
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,080
Like, what the freak?

2661
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,780
You've lost everybody.

2662
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,640
You've lost everyone.

2663
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,000
Where did I go wrong?

2664
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,260
I think that's the one billion spot.

2665
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,860
Oh, you got the one billion spot.

2666
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,980
But you have enough money.

2667
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:17,840
It's only six dollars.

2668
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,940
Like, it's six dollars.

2669
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,620
I hope you enjoy the six dollars.

2670
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:28,100
Nice job.

2671
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:28,720
Nice job.

2672
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:30,380
Good money, Flynn.

2673
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:31,840
Good money.

2674
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,920
Simple stocks.

2675
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,380
What is that over there?

2676
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,140
Is that the last railroad?

2677
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,560
You got the last railroad!

2678
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,000
I fucking can't afford it.

2679
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,060
If you give me a hundred dollars...

2680
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:47,760
If you give me a hundred dollars, I'll buy it.

2681
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,460
Wait, Pitbull can buy it, right?

2682
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,300
Yeah, Pitbull can buy it.

2683
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:52,460
Yeah.

2684
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,400
Just let Pitbull buy it.

2685
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:54,760
I have to auction it.

2686
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:55,660
I don't even have options.

2687
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,340
No, you auction it off.

2688
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,340
You have to auction it off.

2689
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,400
I have to auction it.

2690
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,480
Just let Pitbull have it.

2691
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:03,400
I'm gonna withdraw it.

2692
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,320
She has it automatically.

2693
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:04,620
I got it.

2694
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:05,160
Chad, don't worry.

2695
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,160
I'm withdrawing.

2696
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,780
Chad, watch this.

2697
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:12,940
You can't...

2698
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:15,340
You can't fucking afford it.

2699
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,740
What do you mean?

2700
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:20,620
Just withdraw.

2701
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,880
She automatically owns it.

2702
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,280
I'm not even

2703
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,040
I'm withdrawing.

2704
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,400
Oh shit, it's over.

2705
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,280
Fuck off.

2706
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,200
You can't just put a hundred and fifteen dollars.

2707
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,900
Pitbull, you're gonna get bankrupt again.

2708
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:50,240
Was the message really worth it, Pitbull?

2709
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,800
I'd like to live it on the edge.

2710
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,140
She has the last railroad I need.

2711
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,800
She knows she has a card.

2712
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,920
You wasted an effing GameStop AAA title worth of money.

2713
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:03,700
She's too powerful.

2714
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:07,000
She just has to be lucky and not land on anything or she's fucked.

2715
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,600
It's okay, it's okay.

2716
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,320
Chad, watch this.

2717
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:08,680
Boardwalk.

2718
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,960
Or no wait, Park Place.

2719
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:10,800
Boardwalk?

2720
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,820
You gave me Boardwalk.

2721
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:12,360
Park Place.

2722
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,640
Park Place.

2723
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:17,460
Park Place.

2724
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:18,180
Nine?

2725
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:19,500
Is that good?

2726
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:19,640
Yeah.

2727
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,960
Is this a good blue?

2728
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:22,540
Oh!

2729
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,720
She got her Monopoly!

2730
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:27,740
She owns it!

2731
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,820
She owns it!

2732
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:29,700
A Monopoly now!

2733
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,560
Holy fuck!

2734
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,340
You fucking made it!

2735
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,520
Is this real?

2736
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,800
She actually made it!

2737
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,760
Wait, how do I read this?

2738
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,740
Use something to build?

2739
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,420
I don't give a frick.

2740
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,420
Alright, now what?

2741
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,160
Can I buy a house?

2742
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,080
Yeah, you can.

2743
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,100
Yeah, buy all the houses.

2744
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,620
You press enter.

2745
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,020
Yes!

2746
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,440
Press buttons!

2747
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,980
If you get any bankrupt, it's fine.

2748
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,240
Oh, really?

2749
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,480
How do I...

2750
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,260
How do I... here?

2751
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,100
Let's go, dude!

2752
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:04,500
Okay.

2753
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,880
There she did it.

2754
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:11,380
Now instead of $6, we pay $12, guys.

2755
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:11,980
That's right.

2756
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,140
Nice help.

2757
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:15,980
I have a house chat.

2758
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,020
I own two houses.

2759
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:17,760
I'm like Drake.

2760
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,060
They're mansions.

2761
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,400
Who owns this?

2762
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,080
Is this mine?

2763
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,940
It's my railroad!

2764
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:24,940
I'm safe!

2765
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,660
First person gets $100 with a party at my place.

2766
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,820
Oh my gosh, put it on Pippa's spot.

2767
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:31,800
This is over for me.

2768
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,360
I better not roll bad.

2769
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,480
It's fucking over.

2770
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,720
For $6.

2771
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,260
Uh oh.

2772
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,140
Oh, that's... wait, is that Fillion's spot?

2773
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:43,920
It is!

2774
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:45,500
Wait, her luck's turned around!

2775
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,400
Oh my god, Fillion!

2776
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,140
Her luck is finally turning around!

2777
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,260
Wait, wait, that's almost...

2778
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,360
Oh, you can't afford it!

2779
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,440
Oh my god, Pippa, baby, I give you $8!

2780
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:55,720
Oh, that's right!

2781
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,740
You said $8, but then Pippa!

2782
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,100
Pippa, I can trade with you.

2783
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:58,440
$9, Pippa.

2784
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,940
I can bail you out.

2785
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,340
I can bail you out with the exact money you need.

2786
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,300
We'll bail you out.

2787
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,300
We'll bail you out.

2788
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,340
Pippa, Pippa, Pippa, Pippa!

2789
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,020
No, Pippa, I'll give you the money back for free!

2790
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:10,540
Pippa, go!

2791
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,160
No, please!

2792
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,340
Sister!

2793
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:12,720
My sister!

2794
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:14,140
My sister in Christ!

2795
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,500
I will give you the money!

2796
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:18,860
You can kill the $24!

2797
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,800
You can kill the $24!

2798
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:22,600
You can...

2799
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,480
Just don't do it, bro!

2800
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:24,740
You can kill the $24!

2801
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,840
This is...

2802
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,900
This is...

2803
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,120
You've doomed us all!

2804
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:32,960
You've doomed us all!

2805
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,300
I'm in extreme.

2806
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,580
You've doomed us all!

2807
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,720
She got her bail!

2808
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:42,320
All I'm saying is that, Pippa, you requested two months.

2809
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:42,880
You requested too much from her.

2810
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,200
Fillion, you requested too much from Pippa.

2811
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,400
And look what happened!

2812
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,500
I gave her the money she needed.

2813
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,640
I'm gonna work with you, Doki.

2814
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,440
Let's get working with you, Pippa.

2815
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,840
This is some fucked up shit.

2816
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,320
I'm holding on to my money.

2817
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,040
God forbid.

2818
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:00,620
Jesus!

2819
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:04,960
Alright, Fillion, your turn.

2820
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:05,960
I need to press the button.

2821
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:06,900
Alright, yo, what's up, chat?

2822
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,420
Oh, frick, I didn't mean to do that.

2823
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:08,760
Okay, whatever.

2824
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,320
All I'm saying, Fillion, is that it's not good to be true.

2825
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:12,720
You're too greedy.

2826
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,800
Yeah, I win, dude!

2827
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:15,640
What is this?

2828
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,240
Oh, it's a property!

2829
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,380
Oh, it's community chest.

2830
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:22,800
Student loans, student loans.

2831
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:24,540
Damn!

2832
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,240
You get $50!

2833
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,760
I bought Amazon!

2834
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,560
What?

2835
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,920
For $50?

2836
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,960
You bought one stock from Amazon.

2837
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:35,480
Fillion Bezos.

2838
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,200
I bought a single share of Amazon.

2839
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:38,740
The one stock.

2840
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,180
Alright, this is where I die from.

2841
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:41,300
No, chat, walk in.

2842
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:41,860
Walk in, boys.

2843
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,540
Oh, okay, I don't die from Pippa.

2844
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:44,940
Look at the fart.

2845
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,100
I'm silent and deadly.

2846
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:46,580
Who is this?

2847
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,280
Oh, instead I...

2848
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,640
Oh, shit, it's Lumi!

2849
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,040
No!

2850
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,140
I own money!

2851
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,140
Oh, man.

2852
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:53,920
Oh, man.

2853
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,120
Doki.

2854
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:55,780
Lumi.

2855
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,480
Doki, what are you...

2856
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,940
I'm the richest person here.

2857
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,200
No, you're not.

2858
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:01,700
It's Lumi.

2859
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,900
How much do you owe again?

2860
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,400
130?

2861
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,180
I owe 130.

2862
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,280
I will give you 150.

2863
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:11,860
I owe you one.

2864
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:12,640
Chat, check this out.

2865
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,780
Alright, you know what?

2866
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,020
Yeah.

2867
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,180
Bail me out if I land on your fucking railroad.

2868
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,100
Yeah, I'll bail you out.

2869
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:20,940
Don't worry, I'll bail you out.

2870
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:23,360
Keep me out of your fucking railroad.

2871
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:24,620
I'll give you 140.

2872
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:29,380
There you go, baby.

2873
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,100
We got it.

2874
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,240
We got each other.

2875
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,320
The rich has each other's back, you know?

2876
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,420
Alliance.

2877
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:37,440
Alright.

2878
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,920
How do we select it?

2879
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,500
And then I offer...

2880
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,480
I offer...

2881
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,240
Wait, how do I add the money?

2882
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,040
I've never traded before.

2883
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:50,220
Oh, wait.

2884
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:50,400
No.

2885
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:50,640
What?

2886
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,200
I'll take a get out of jail.

2887
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,180
Yeah, deal.

2888
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:54,920
Alright, deal.

2889
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,100
I'm like Squidward.

2890
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,000
Deal.

2891
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,520
I'm like Squidward, bro.

2892
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,400
Nice.

2893
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:08,580
Nice bail.

2894
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:09,900
Nice, nice.

2895
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:10,840
Nice, nice.

2896
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,580
Who wants to trade me?

2897
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,660
Look, Fillion, see this is how you do business, Fillion.

2898
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:16,960
You gotta learn from the best.

2899
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:17,520
Oh my god.

2900
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,940
Wait, can I come over to work with you?

2901
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,120
You want to be an intern?

2902
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,860
Yeah, I wanna be a racist.

2903
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:25,760
Yeah, let me in.

2904
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,340
Oh shit, Pippa.

2905
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,760
Oh shit, Pippa.

2906
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,120
It's okay, it's got no house on it.

2907
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,240
Yeah, it's got no house.

2908
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,660
Pippa, come here, I'll give you the house.

2909
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:36,580
Pippa!

2910
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:37,980
Hey, Pippa!

2911
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,120
How's it going, dude?

2912
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,780
What are you trading with her?

2913
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:43,900
Nothing.

2914
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,760
What does she have that I don't have?

2915
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,560
What does she have that I don't have?

2916
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,960
I think you gotta be blonde, man.

2917
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:53,700
You demand too much, Fillion.

2918
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,720
That's the problem.

2919
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,960
I told you I'd give you $24 if I didn't give you a fourth railroad.

2920
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:01,700
I told you I'd give you $24 if I didn't give you a fourth railroad.

2921
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,820
$1 in exchange for...

2922
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:06,840
Dude, this is pissing me off.

2923
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:13,980
Hey, but she can afford a rent now.

2924
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,140
Yeah.

2925
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,360
Did you just give her money and then lose money or what?

2926
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:24,520
This is how the rich stays rich.

2927
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:24,640
I bailed her out, man.

2928
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,620
I fucking bailed her out.

2929
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,620
This is exactly how the rich stays rich.

2930
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:28,420
You know what it is?

2931
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:30,260
I wanna give Fillion money.

2932
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:31,780
You wanna give me cheeks?

2933
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:33,560
Because she wants to be friends with you.

2934
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,620
That's what it is.

2935
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:38,820
She's mopping the floor and sandbagging me because she knows I'm gonna keep smelling the syrup and coming back.

2936
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,600
And she's gonna keep on smashing me.

2937
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,900
And keep on smashing me.

2938
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:45,540
And she knows my entire purpose is to sit in your chat and ride her pee-pee.

2939
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:45,980
And she knows my entire purpose is to sit in your chat and ride her pee-pee.

2940
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,440
She knows it.

2941
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,780
And now she's gonna do that.

2942
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,800
And maybe I should end stream now!

2943
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,200
What the hell are you going on about?

2944
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,820
Wait, wait, if Fillion doesn't stream, then her viewers will come watch Lumi and I stream.

2945
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,080
So like, that's...

2946
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,240
Yeah, Fillion, end stream.

2947
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,080
End stream, Fillion.

2948
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,560
I'll do it too, Polly.

2949
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:04,460
You won't raid me.

2950
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,060
I'll raid you.

2951
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:08,600
I'll give you a...

2952
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,760
I'm back, baby!

2953
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:11,700
What's that?

2954
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,620
You're back, baby!

2955
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,520
You're so back!

2956
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:24,100
Fillion, just so you know, if you raid me, I'll bail you out.

2957
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:24,580
Oh yeah.

2958
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:32,440
We give you offers, Fillion.

2959
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,200
I got you, I got you, Fillion.

2960
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,220
Yeah, we got you, Fillion.

2961
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,540
We fucking got you, man.

2962
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,520
Did you just pay $90?

2963
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,660
I bet you're jealous that I can do that.

2964
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,480
Yay, where am I going?

2965
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:46,140
Where's this?

2966
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:47,060
Is this another chest?

2967
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,760
I feel like I always get land on there.

2968
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:50,900
Oh, this is the...

2969
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:51,120
No!

2970
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,500
I don't get my 200...

2971
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,020
I'm too fucking rich, man!

2972
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:56,960
The tax bracket!

2973
01:29:58,940 --> 01:29:59,780
Ratioed, nerd.

2974
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,380
Tax bracket, man.

2975
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,980
I keep going above the tax bracket.

2976
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:05,160
Oh, another double.

2977
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,180
I might go to jail soon, guys.

2978
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:08,220
She's so fucking lucky.

2979
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:09,780
It doesn't even make sense.

2980
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,540
No, guys.

2981
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,920
If I have one more, I can go to jail.

2982
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,660
What do you mean?

2983
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,740
That's where you're gonna be in a few minutes.

2984
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:18,320
Oh, oh, oh!

2985
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:21,720
Where's that?

2986
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,200
It's my rat-rat!

2987
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,300
Oh my god.

2988
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,760
I got the fucking chill.

2989
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,540
How crazy is that?

2990
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,240
I don't want to know.

2991
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,440
Canadian taxes hit hard, though.

2992
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:34,580
I don't know.

2993
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,580
You land on your own thing, right?

2994
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:40,140
Oh, shit!

2995
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,540
You know what?

2996
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:43,160
This is safer.

2997
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,200
Yeah, so you're right.

2998
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,100
It's actually safer.

2999
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,640
Now you wanna go to jail!

3000
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,200
Now it's cool to go to jail!

3001
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,300
But she's in the rich person jail.

3002
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:53,900
Where she at?

3003
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,740
I got a TV in here.

3004
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:59,360
Where she's on the base in Pongchampers.

3005
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:03,660
It's the rich person jail where you get caught for fraud or something.

3006
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:04,140
Oh my god.

3007
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:06,380
Champs?

3008
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,800
Oh, you got 200!

3009
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,020
That's not effing.

3010
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:12,220
That's not right.

3011
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,740
Oh my gosh, she gets another 200.

3012
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,080
Okay, Lumi, can you land on my house?

3013
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:17,820
Can you land on my house?

3014
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,240
No, no, I have little houses.

3015
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,680
No, no, no, I live next door.

3016
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,000
I live next door.

3017
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:23,320
I'm good.

3018
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:23,680
I'll pass.

3019
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:25,220
Watch this.

3020
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:25,860
Indiana Avenue.

3021
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,420
If you need sugar, you can come over though.

3022
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,280
I can buy a house on Indiana Avenue?

3023
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,100
Wait, how do I?

3024
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:34,820
You can't.

3025
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:36,440
I mean, you can technically.

3026
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:38,380
You can't.

3027
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,420
Oh yeah, you can buy it on the light blues.

3028
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:41,480
Where am I?

3029
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,240
Just keep scoring until there's a green.

3030
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:46,460
I'm pressing down and it's not working, your honor.

3031
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:47,620
There!

3032
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,940
There you go.

3033
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:50,840
Let's go!

3034
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,660
Now I'm playing.

3035
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,500
I was just a Lumi.

3036
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,140
I hope she lands on your square, Pippa.

3037
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,120
That would be the best move ever.

3038
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,100
If I land on a Pippa, you're done.

3039
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,540
It would be so fucking funny.

3040
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:04,280
You're so lucky.

3041
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,320
You're so lucky.

3042
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,640
What is that?

3043
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:08,260
What is that?

3044
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,320
No!

3045
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:14,180
You don't even have money!

3046
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,220
That sucks!

3047
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:17,520
Do you want us to bail you out?

3048
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,800
That's terrible.

3049
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:20,880
Or you can mortgage your place.

3050
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:21,760
Yeah, you can mortgage.

3051
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:27,360
I need an angel investor to invest in my new company idea.

3052
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,980
I'm gonna make FaZe...

3053
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,860
Give me one of your properties.

3054
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,100
FaZe Grand.

3055
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,680
I'm gonna become FaZe Banks.

3056
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,220
I'm gonna kick out half of my members.

3057
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,460
I'm gonna build a new FaZe.

3058
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,140
I'll invest if you give me one of your properties.

3059
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,800
Okay, that's something really good.

3060
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,600
I'll also invest if you give me one of your properties.

3061
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,340
I want your red property.

3062
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,540
That's cool.

3063
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:51,280
Any other offers, Your Honor?

3064
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:52,280
I want your electricity.

3065
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:53,820
Okay, cool.

3066
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,720
She wants to take my effing bill off of me.

3067
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:56,060
That's fine.

3068
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,480
How much are you gonna offer for my electricity?

3069
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,020
I'll give you 150.

3070
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:05,100
That's what it's worth.

3071
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:08,320
You're really demanding, Fillion.

3072
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:10,200
For someone that's in debt, you might as well just mortgage.

3073
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:13,980
You might as well just mortgage if you're being very demanding.

3074
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,260
Are you the dog?

3075
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:15,680
Yes.

3076
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:16,560
I'm the hat.

3077
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,780
Put it on the subreddit.

3078
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,240
I'm farming karma off her.

3079
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,780
Put it on the subreddit.

3080
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:26,980
How do I come over to you?

3081
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,640
You just hover over to yourself.

3082
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,080
Give me your electricity.

3083
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,380
How do I request money?

3084
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:35,940
You can... like that.

3085
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:36,800
I'll give you 150.

3086
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,160
Okay, great.

3087
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:39,900
So that's good.

3088
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,360
Good deal.

3089
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:40,840
Good deal.

3090
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,460
That's $20 on top of what you owe me.

3091
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:43,900
You know?

3092
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:44,500
Yeah.

3093
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:47,600
So you're making $20 on this deal.

3094
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,440
And then you give her...

3095
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,680
I'm saying...

3096
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,780
You're taking mine!

3097
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:56,340
You are fucking giving...

3098
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:57,000
Deal or no deal?

3099
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,120
You're just giving her back...

3100
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,340
She takes back the money, Fillion.

3101
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:04,460
I have a proposal for you.

3102
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,040
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3103
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,080
I'll take it.

3104
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:07,780
What's the proposal?

3105
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,840
No, don't do this to me.

3106
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:11,220
What's the proposal?

3107
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,100

3108
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,940
A little proposal for Dokie.

3109
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,520
What is this proposal?

3110
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:23,240
Life is cruel.

3111
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,560
I've got this electric company.

3112
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:26,120
Yeah?

3113
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,620
I heard it was owned by Fillion.

3114
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:30,200
What happened?

3115
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,080
And I will post a picture of you publicly online.

3116
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,880
I heard it was owned by Fillion.

3117
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,780
How did you get the electrical company?

3118
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,400
It is mine!

3119
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:38,820
Dokie is the owner.

3120
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:39,180
That's so interesting.

3121
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:42,840
I own 49%.

3122
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:44,620
I own 49%.

3123
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:46,020
I put in this deal.

3124
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,620
I told you the mortgage, Fillion.

3125
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,760
I only trade at 51%.

3126
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,100
I only trade at 51%.

3127
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,380
It's my turn to go to the store.

3128
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,560
You get to throw another dice.

3129
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:56,420
How lucky are you?

3130
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,200
I'm going to throw something else.

3131
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:58,960
Watch boardwalk.

3132
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:01,200
Double dice.

3133
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:05,000
Oh, you're so...

3134
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,480
You're going to watch this chat.

3135
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:07,700
This is called the luck of the Irish.

3136
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,140
This is called the heart of the cards.

3137
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,120
Check me out, boys.

3138
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,240
Oh, you get content.

3139
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,820
You got beauty content.

3140
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,260
You're so beautiful, Fillion.

3141
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,320
Nice dodge.

3142
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,480
Check my Twitter for the face reveal.

3143
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:22,440
You should try Limbo next time you're streaming.

3144
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,520
So we can see how good a dodging you are.

3145
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:26,580
I am pretty good.

3146
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:27,000
Check me out.

3147
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:27,340
Watch this.

3148
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,680
You can roll again, by the way.

3149
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:30,620
Roll again.

3150
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,580
Oh, my god.

3151
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,000
She's dodging.

3152
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,640
She's dodging right now.

3153
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,820
If she hits the fucking...

3154
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:43,040
Does she get the...

3155
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,540
It would be so funny if she can't...

3156
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,320
What did I get?

3157
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:47,660
What?

3158
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:47,880
What?

3159
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,660
Thanks for boardwalk.

3160
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:57,200
Thanks for getting me this again.

3161
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,500
I really appreciate it.

3162
01:35:59,120 --> 01:35:59,640
Okay.

3163
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:02,240
How are you feeling, Fillion?

3164
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,300
How are you feeling?

3165
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,580
I'm the elbow of every joke right now.

3166
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:11,320
To be fair, you did...

3167
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,120
You sort of set yourself up.

3168
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:13,820
To be fair.

3169
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,440
You probably would be your mom.

3170
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,540
All I'm saying is that you...

3171
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,020
You demanded a lot.

3172
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,520
Very early game.

3173
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,100
You gotta play the game.

3174
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:29,240
You went in with full ego there.

3175
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,700
You know what?

3176
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,900
Your skin don't fit.

3177
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,100
And your mother never loved you.

3178
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,580
I feel like somebody's projecting right now.

3179
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:40,280
Are you projecting?

3180
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:42,660
Hey, look.

3181
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:43,120
My railroad.

3182
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,840
I always land on my railroad.

3183
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,060
He always land on my own railroad.

3184
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,000
He always land on my own railroad.

3185
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,600
All right, Pippa.

3186
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:51,180
You can do it.

3187
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:52,600
I don't wanna get out.

3188
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:53,280
Maybe...

3189
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:55,780
It's all to God.

3190
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,160
It's fierce out there.

3191
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:01,280
The outside world is scary, guys.

3192
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:02,580
It's safer in jail sometimes.

3193
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,740
Yeah, it is pretty safe over there.

3194
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,300
I should head to jail.

3195
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:06,880
All right.

3196
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:09,340
Can I get a...

3197
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:10,760
Oh, thank God.

3198
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,440
What is this?

3199
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,060
Why not land on my property?

3200
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,240
I would have felt so fucking bad.

3201
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:17,780
Oh, shit.

3202
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,080
You have to pay each of us 50.

3203
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:21,680
You have to come back.

3204
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,520
You've been elected chairman.

3205
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,380
I don't wanna leave.

3206
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,900
I got you out of jail, Pippa.

3207
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,540
You can come back now.

3208
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,400
You can come back.

3209
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,340
It's my turn to pass this.

3210
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,400
It's cozier in there.

3211
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,460
I'm hosting the bingo night.

3212
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,480
It's for a bunch of charity.

3213
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:37,680
It's for tax relief.

3214
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:39,780
Where is this?

3215
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,280
Seven's the most common number you can want, guys.

3216
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,540
And I'm also gonna pay you.

3217
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:45,880
It's your own place.

3218
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:46,460
You're safe.

3219
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:48,260
I know.

3220
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,340
I own this property.

3221
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,580
You can also put more property there.

3222
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,140
This is what the founding fathers intended.

3223
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,120
Yeah.

3224
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:57,880
Just press shift.

3225
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,020
You can make it $30.

3226
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:01,420
Shift again.

3227
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:05,000
She has to even out the houses.

3228
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:05,520
Yeah.

3229
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,600
You have to even out the houses.

3230
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:07,080
Nice!

3231
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:07,860
90 bucks!

3232
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,680
Now you have 100!

3233
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:11,220
Yeah!

3234
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:12,840
Good for you!

3235
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:15,120
Wait, how many properties do I own?

3236
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,100
I own one extra one.

3237
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:16,380
It's fine.

3238
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:17,600
You own four.

3239
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:19,540
How do I... help me out?

3240
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:20,740
Get me out.

3241
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:23,780
Okay.

3242
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:27,800
I feel like I might last.

3243
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,000
Oh, thank god!

3244
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,760
As long as it's not Pitbull's place.

3245
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:32,360
That place is scary.

3246
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:35,620
You're in a row of haunted houses.

3247
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,500
Yeah, this is...

3248
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:38,920
I'm fine with that.

3249
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,260
Alright, alright.

3250
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,320
This is an alliance, man.

3251
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,340
Yeah, this is an alliance.

3252
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,380
We owe each other.

3253
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,400
You know what?

3254
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,920
I can afford...

3255
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,980
Do I afford it?

3256
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:50,560
Can you buy a house on Kentucky Avenue?

3257
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,620
Let's see if I have the same set.

3258
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:53,120
You know what?

3259
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:53,520
Fuck it.

3260
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:53,960
Let's do it.

3261
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,860
I'm playing a little dangerously right now.

3262
01:38:59,180 --> 01:38:59,620
Alright.

3263
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:00,900
Enter.

3264
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:03,520
We're ashamed you landed there.

3265
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:03,960
Hi, Pippa.

3266
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,560
Are you enjoying your jail time?

3267
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:09,080
Pippa holds up for your tax crimes.

3268
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:10,640
Oh, nice!

3269
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,000
Nice!

3270
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,060
I have a library card in here.

3271
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:13,500
Oh my god!

3272
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:16,600
They're teaching her how to use a computer at the moment.

3273
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,480
When you get out, teach me how to make moonshine.

3274
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,220
You can become a jail lawyer!

3275
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,300
A jail lawyer?

3276
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:22,840
Yeah!

3277
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:25,200
You can actually be... I learned that orange is the new black.

3278
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,960
You can become a lawyer in jail.

3279
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,680
Is this the last pink?

3280
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:29,680
Oh, that's the last pink!

3281
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:33,300
Pippa, you're a coward!

3282
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:33,620
What?

3283
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:34,520
Me?

3284
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:38,320
Wow, she insulted...

3285
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,880
She was about to offer you something, and then you insulted her.

3286
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:44,200
I don't think she's gonna offer you anything.

3287
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:45,060
I said that to Pippa, not Lumi.

3288
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:45,060
Wait, no.

3289
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:46,520
I said that to Pippa, not Lumi.

3290
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:47,860
Yeah.

3291
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:49,000
What's your deal?

3292
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:49,580
Oh, Lumi.

3293
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:50,660
What's your deal?

3294
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:51,160
I have a deal for you.

3295
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:52,540
300.

3296
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:55,380
For the pink.

3297
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:56,820
She doesn't have 300.

3298
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:57,780
She's got a mortgage.

3299
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:58,400
Yeah, she'll get there.

3300
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,180
You gotta sell your houses.

3301
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,980
Wait, you're gonna give me the second out of three properties for $300?

3302
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,180
$300.

3303
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,420
Are you thinking I'm a brainlet?

3304
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,560
Do you think I eat tower one for breakfast cereal?

3305
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,100
I mean...

3306
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,340
What in the hell am I gonna do with a second property?

3307
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,480
What in the hell am I gonna do with a second property?

3308
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,200
When I can't even pay rent on my own life!

3309
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:22,980
$300?

3310
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,800
How will you take those and...

3311
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,380
I heard that VTubers aren't the best with financial planning.

3312
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:27,820
So you know...

3313
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:29,820
You'll never have the inkling.

3314
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,480
If you ever have an inkling, you'll have to get a new one.

3315
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:33,640
What's this?

3316
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:34,820
Let me know.

3317
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,340
Oh, is that my train station?

3318
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,480
That's my railroad.

3319
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,500
Nice railroad.

3320
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,140
You're in debt.

3321
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,280
Okay, it'll be $300.

3322
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,020
What do you say?

3323
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:46,980
What do you say?

3324
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:48,220
I can give you...

3325
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:49,860
I can give you $80.

3326
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,400
$80 for the thing.

3327
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,460
What happened to $300?

3328
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,200
Yeah, well, now you're kind of in a disadvantageous situation.

3329
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:58,820
We are in the deal.

3330
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,780
What happened to $300?

3331
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,440
Fillion, just mortgaged your house!

3332
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:04,620
I am the only one who can bail you out, Fillion.

3333
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:07,500
I'm the only one who can bail you out, Fillion.

3334
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:08,420
Wait, can I sell a house?

3335
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:11,080
Fillion, you can literally bail yourself out.

3336
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:11,680
How?

3337
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:14,140
You can bail yourself out!

3338
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:17,160
Go to the board map!

3339
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:19,500
Dude, there's more buttons than train!

3340
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,360
Go to the board map!

3341
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,980
Move your cursor around!

3342
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,660
Wait, what do I own?

3343
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:29,020
What do I own?

3344
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,820
You own the blue shit!

3345
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,460
But I also own one more property I don't care about.

3346
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:35,120
How do I sell it?

3347
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,040
Go to control!

3348
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,440
No, you can't!

3349
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,320
Okay, you have to find your... that's my property.

3350
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,260
Find your property.

3351
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:45,620
So which one is mine?

3352
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,280
God bless you, you're crying.

3353
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,320
I don't have to pick one.

3354
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,020
One of these is mine.

3355
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:50,500
This one!

3356
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,380
There you go, control.

3357
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,160
You can't sell it.

3358
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:54,280
You have to mortgage it.

3359
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:55,920
Oh, wait, that's...

3360
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:56,080
No!

3361
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,960
Fillion, you don't have options!

3362
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,100
No, I do!

3363
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:05,040
You either mortgage or you make a deal.

3364
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:06,820
You have another IOU.

3365
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:08,220
Fillion, that won't even be enough for you.

3366
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,160
You need $80.

3367
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:12,020
You can mortgage two properties.

3368
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,020
Please, dude.

3369
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:13,960
Like, come on, man.

3370
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:16,400
You were gonna mortgage it anyway.

3371
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,700
We better a lot!

3372
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:19,540
You were gonna mortgage it anyway.

3373
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:20,880
You're gonna lose the game.

3374
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:23,340
You're gonna get $70 if you mortgage it.

3375
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,000
You can sell your houses.

3376
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:25,700
I'll give you $100.

3377
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:26,720
Thank you.

3378
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:30,960
That's a good-effing deal.

3379
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,960
You can sell your houses, though.

3380
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,320
Just so you know.

3381
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,180
I like moving.

3382
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,160
Oh my god.

3383
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,660
Lomi, you gotta start leveraging tweets and stuff.

3384
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:45,620
You gotta tweet that Panic!

3385
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:46,460
Lomi is the fucking best.

3386
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,500
All I'm saying, Lomi, is that you could've asked.

3387
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,420
She's like on her knees right now.

3388
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:51,520
She's like on her knees right now.

3389
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,080
Do you stream on Twitch?

3390
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,840
Fillion's willing to do anything right now, Lomi.

3391
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,440
You should've asked for more.

3392
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:58,560
Stream on Twitch, deal?

3393
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,060
Alright, I accept.

3394
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:03,020
Alright, I'll take it.

3395
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,380
What are you doing?

3396
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,620
You so don't.

3397
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,720
She actually scammed you.

3398
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,300
She actually scammed you.

3399
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,680
Wait, I didn't give you the money.

3400
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:16,420
Wait, Sarah, I didn't give you the money.

3401
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:18,540
I didn't hit okay.

3402
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,640
You hit my owner.

3403
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:22,720
You lost.

3404
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:23,920
I gave you.

3405
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:25,800
And she took it.

3406
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:28,620
All I'm saying is...

3407
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:30,540
I'll give you $110 for your show.

3408
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:31,300
There you go.

3409
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:36,940
You didn't notice this, but she took one of your properties too, Fillion.

3410
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,520
I know that.

3411
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:40,680
She literally took it.

3412
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,840
She literally took your property.

3413
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,460
We were trading my property.

3414
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:45,160
Kick her while she's down.

3415
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:48,100
Lomi, leverage something.

3416
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:48,960
Kick her while she's down.

3417
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:49,220
Do it.

3418
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:52,960
How do I take more from her?

3419
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:53,500
Good.

3420
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:55,920
How do you accept the deal?

3421
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:57,100
Just press deal.

3422
01:43:58,820 --> 01:43:59,820
Lomi, you coward.

3423
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:01,040
You could've gotten more.

3424
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:01,700
She's desperate.

3425
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,700
She didn't even notice that you took her property.

3426
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:07,820
She didn't even notice.

3427
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:09,200
She didn't even notice.

3428
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,580
She's stealing the property for the money, dog.

3429
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:11,880
That was the entire point of the match.

3430
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,800
I kind of earned money from this one.

3431
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:16,220
Now we know that Fillion doesn't look at what she's trading.

3432
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:22,420
I'm surely in virtual reality and there's four people that could steal my money every time I make an epic deal.

3433
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,220
Is this stealing if you don't even pay attention?

3434
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:28,700
It's definitely stealing.

3435
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:29,860
You might have a friend, okay?

3436
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:30,560
Trick.

3437
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:32,980
My turn.

3438
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:37,420
See, in the spirit of fairness, I need to have someone to exploit if we're gonna keep playing this game.

3439
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:41,940
I'm gonna pay four dollars.

3440
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:42,480
Am I getting taxed again?

3441
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:43,620
Oh, no, I didn't.

3442
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:44,380
Okay, thank god.

3443
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,220
I was gonna say that.

3444
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:47,540
I can pay.

3445
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,140
Yeah, I can pay four dollars.

3446
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,320
It's just four dollars.

3447
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:53,380
What's four dollars between four and a doggy?

3448
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:54,660
Exactly.

3449
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,280
Yeah, see?

3450
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:57,760
Let's see.

3451
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,020
Oh, I can buy more props.

3452
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,320
Okay, I'm gonna put it on...

3453
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:01,400
Can you put a house on me?

3454
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,340
Put it on Blue.

3455
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,400
Can you Wizard Boss me?

3456
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:08,480
You guys hear something?

3457
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:11,740
I can't hear people who have income less than fifty dollars.

3458
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,520
Yeah.

3459
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:18,220
Can I take a header?

3460
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:21,060
That's the quiet point that I hear right now.

3461
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,980
I'm rich death right now.

3462
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:23,960
Okay, I'm starting OnlyFans.

3463
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:31,880
Yeah, people!

3464
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,040
No!

3465
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:35,940
Oh, no, you're out.

3466
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:36,720
You're out.

3467
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,900
Yeah, people!

3468
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,220
Shut up, Billy.

3469
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,100
You landed on a chance.

3470
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:44,420
Yeah, you landed on a chance to land on an Indiana.

3471
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,060
You're lucky.

3472
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:47,880
Let's go!

3473
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:49,600
Oh, you gotta go to my place.

3474
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:53,420
Wait, you have to go to my place?

3475
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:53,860
Wait, what?

3476
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,200
How did you get here?

3477
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,780
I didn't even pass gold.

3478
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,760
Isn't this where you literally are?

3479
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:03,400
Wait, how did you get to my place?

3480
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:05,780
Want me?

3481
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,980
How much do you need?

3482
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:09,880
Give me a dollar.

3483
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:10,660
I'll bill you up.

3484
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:13,500
I'm all in, chat.

3485
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:14,360
I'm all in on blue.

3486
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:15,700
I like how nobody's mortgaging.

3487
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,200
What's mortgage?

3488
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,220
I'm a woman.

3489
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,440
I don't know what that means, man.

3490
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:23,100
It's when you get engaged.

3491
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,660
What do you mean women aren't real?

3492
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,920
I have no idea what mortgaging is.

3493
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:29,280
It's when you get engaged.

3494
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:30,220
Oh!

3495
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:38,000
Yeah, if you marry the dude from Rick and Morty, well, A, you get an effing lawsuit, but B, you get mortgaged.

3496
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:41,000
My money's all going to Doki.

3497
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,060
Oh, it's going back to me, right?

3498
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,300
Oh shit, yeah, it's going back to me!

3499
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:47,600
Yay!

3500
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:48,940
Congrats, Doki!

3501
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:49,920
Yay!

3502
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:51,200
Yay!

3503
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:55,680
I want to go to jail too.

3504
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,140
I feel safer in jail now.

3505
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,840
I'll give you my pay.

3506
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:02,000
I'll give you my pink if you give me the electricity.

3507
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:03,100
I'll give you my pink if you give me the electricity.

3508
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,640
Okay, Doki, Doki, Doki, do you want to marry me?

3509
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:06,700
Okay, Doki, Doki, Doki, do you want to marry me?

3510
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:06,700
What?

3511
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:07,740
No, of course not.

3512
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:08,960
Marry me, no prenup.

3513
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,340
I can pay this.

3514
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:11,800
I can pay this.

3515
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:14,340
Marry me, no prenup.

3516
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:15,160
Alright.

3517
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:17,620
I'll do a trade.

3518
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,100
I'll give you a monopoly if you give me my monopoly.

3519
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:22,960
Uh, yeah, fucking deal.

3520
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:24,960
What the...

3521
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,560
Alright, alright.

3522
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:27,680
Poor thing.

3523
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:31,980
I'll give you my monopoly.

3524
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:32,540
Alright, here's your monopoly.

3525
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:33,240
Yay!

3526
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,060
And then I'll...

3527
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,480
I'll give you this monopoly.

3528
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:39,840
Hell yeah.

3529
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:46,020
You know the song on Terramotors was discovered four days ago and it was found to be in a dumb song called Angel's Thesis?

3530
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,120
Alright, I take that deal.

3531
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,300
Enjoy your electricity.

3532
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:50,800
I didn't need those anyway.

3533
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:51,640
It's fine.

3534
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:52,900
I want electricity.

3535
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:55,020
Now I own the water and the electricity.

3536
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:55,860
Woo!

3537
01:47:58,820 --> 01:47:59,900
Alright, $90.

3538
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:01,620
We are all so fucking poor.

3539
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:05,400
All I'm saying is that Lumi's gonna win the end game because she has three monopolies.

3540
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:06,520
We are all so fucking poor.

3541
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,640
She has three monopolies.

3542
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,660
Watch me go.

3543
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,820
To infinity and beyond!

3544
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,260
We're gonna have a powerful throw.

3545
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:16,480
I can't bail anyone out anymore.

3546
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,380
We're gonna have a powerful throw.

3547
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,040
Yeah!

3548
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,000
You're gonna land on a doki.

3549
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,300
Wait, you land on a doki?

3550
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:27,720
We're gonna have a powerful throw.

3551
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,240
$200.

3552
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,500
All I'm saying is that you need a mortgage.

3553
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:35,560
Nobody's bailing you out.

3554
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,000
You wanna do this to me, Lumi?

3555
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,440
I can't!

3556
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,540
I don't have shit, man!

3557
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:41,100
Doki, Doki, Doki, Doki.

3558
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:41,960
Marry me, please.

3559
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:42,660
I love you.

3560
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:47,200
Doki, I looked at you and I realized I'm not gay.

3561
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:47,500
Doki, I looked at you and I realized I'm not gay.

3562
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,760
Yeah, are you willing to sign a prenup?

3563
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:50,060
Are you willing to sign a prenup?

3564
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:51,220
Okay, no.

3565
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:51,780
But that's the thing.

3566
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:53,200
If it's true love, we should trust you.

3567
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:54,740
Are you willing to sign a prenup then?

3568
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:59,000
If it's true love, you're willing to sign a prenup because you're not in it for the money.

3569
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,240
That's what prenups are.

3570
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:01,480
You're not in it for the money.

3571
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:02,580
So you're willing to sign it.

3572
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,700
Yeah, I know, but is it really true love if we sign a prenup?

3573
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:06,360
That just sounds like we don't even trust each other.

3574
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:10,480
But if it is true love, then you're not in it for the money.

3575
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,460
So you would willingly sign a prenup.

3576
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:12,480
Yeah, I know.

3577
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:12,800
I don't want the money.

3578
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:18,840
Why would we sign something to make it so official and stingy when we could literally just nod and love each other forever?

3579
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,980
Wow, you suddenly fell in love with me because you landed on my property?

3580
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:23,600
That's so fucking weird.

3581
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:25,580
I just love how you can go boardwalk.

3582
01:49:25,580 --> 01:49:26,140
What can I say?

3583
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:28,880
I love a woman with a boardwalk.

3584
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,000
I love a woman with a boardwalk.

3585
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:33,920
Think about this Doki.

3586
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:35,280
Have you kissed a man before?

3587
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:35,680
Bankrupt yourself.

3588
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:36,140
Bankrupt yourself now.

3589
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:36,440
Probably not.

3590
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:39,300
But if you did, that wouldn't be gay because men kiss women.

3591
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:41,620
Bankrupt yourself now.

3592
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:42,460
Bankrupt yourself now.

3593
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:43,980
You got a mortgage.

3594
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:45,180
You got a mortgage.

3595
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:47,640
I'm not making any deals with you, Fillion.

3596
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:49,480
You did it to yourself.

3597
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:50,940
You did it to yourself.

3598
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:51,200
You did this to yourself.

3599
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:52,260
You're in a special class.

3600
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,580
You can't hang out with us anymore.

3601
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:54,820
Yeah, you can't hang out with us anymore.

3602
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,520
How are you going to get married?

3603
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:58,820
You can't sit in our table.

3604
01:49:59,020 --> 01:49:59,660
No deal.

3605
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:01,000
Wait, wait, wait.

3606
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,340
You didn't hear my deal yet.

3607
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,100
You didn't hear my deal yet.

3608
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:07,480
You didn't hear my deal yet.

3609
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:08,400
Okay, what's your deal?

3610
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:09,360
Yeah.

3611
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,220
Okay, no deals.

3612
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,280
You get married.

3613
01:50:17,870 --> 01:50:18,970
Give me all your property.

3614
01:50:20,330 --> 01:50:21,310
I'll bail you out.

3615
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:22,430
Women are not property.

3616
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:23,030
I would never.

3617
01:50:23,130 --> 01:50:25,430
Give me one of your blue property and I'll bail you out.

3618
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:26,910
I did that.

3619
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:27,410
I did that.

3620
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:29,970
Give me one of your blue property and I'll bail you out.

3621
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:32,110
Or you mortgage it.

3622
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:33,010
Here, Fillion.

3623
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:34,270
You mortgage your property.

3624
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:35,410
You bail yourself out.

3625
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:37,710
You give me your blue property and I bail you out.

3626
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:38,430
That's not what we do.

3627
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:39,330
That's not what we do.

3628
01:50:40,230 --> 01:50:40,590
What?

3629
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:46,010
Can I use up, up, down, down, left, right, circle, square, triangle, star or not?

3630
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:47,330
Or you can bankrupt yourself now.

3631
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:49,270
Just bankrupt.

3632
01:50:50,230 --> 01:50:51,350
Just mortgage?

3633
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:52,390
Fillion.

3634
01:50:52,690 --> 01:50:53,250
What?

3635
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:55,150
It's over for you, Fillion.

3636
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:56,830
Just mortgage, man.

3637
01:50:56,910 --> 01:50:57,490
Just mortgage.

3638
01:50:57,990 --> 01:50:58,550
Okay.

3639
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:02,490
How do I even...

3640
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:03,410
Sell your houses.

3641
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:04,910
You can sell your houses.

3642
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:06,390
Oh, I can?

3643
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:07,610
Yeah, you go to your house.

3644
01:51:07,610 --> 01:51:08,670
Go to your territory stuff.

3645
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:11,210
You have to sell all of them.

3646
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:12,430
You need $250.

3647
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:14,510
Yeah, but you sell all your houses.

3648
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:17,530
Keep selling.

3649
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:20,130
Keep selling?

3650
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,690
You can't even fucking afford it.

3651
01:51:21,790 --> 01:51:22,470
And then mortgage.

3652
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:23,910
And then you mortgage.

3653
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:26,530
She still can't afford it.

3654
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:28,830
Yeah, but if she mortgages it, she can afford it.

3655
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:33,650
Fillion, you have to.

3656
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:36,470
You either bankrupt, mortgage, or give me your property.

3657
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:37,750
$70.

3658
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:39,110
Give me your property.

3659
01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:41,710
$70 and you owe me a loan.

3660
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:43,530
$70 and get married.

3661
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:44,530
Give me your property.

3662
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:48,550
If you want to get married, give me your property.

3663
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:50,370
I'd rather be a stripper.

3664
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:53,090
Well, it's time to go to the strip club.

3665
01:51:54,470 --> 01:51:54,870
Oh, yeah.

3666
01:51:56,010 --> 01:51:56,410
Oh, yeah.

3667
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:01,110
You know what you want to do?

3668
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:01,630
You know what you want to do?

3669
01:52:01,630 --> 01:52:03,910
I'm going to lose my property now, but I'll regain it later.

3670
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:04,790
I'm going to lose my property now, but I'll regain it later.

3671
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:05,970
See?

3672
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:10,310
I'm going to sell this for $70.

3673
01:52:10,370 --> 01:52:11,810
No, you mortgage it.

3674
01:52:11,990 --> 01:52:12,970
You don't sell it.

3675
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:13,630
You mortgage it.

3676
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:14,550
Or you give it to me.

3677
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:15,850
And I'll bail you out.

3678
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:18,110
Okay, so I need how much money?

3679
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:18,490
$70?

3680
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:19,530
I need $71.

3681
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,090
So you mortgage two buildings.

3682
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:24,090
I sold all my buildings.

3683
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:26,010
No, you mortgage your property.

3684
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:27,670
I know!

3685
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:29,890
But listen!

3686
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:31,390
Nice job.

3687
01:52:34,570 --> 01:52:35,310
There you go.

3688
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:36,130
Now you can afford it.

3689
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:36,630
Yes.

3690
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:37,370
Wow.

3691
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:38,890
Welcome to the rich side.

3692
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:40,250
Now pay it all.

3693
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:41,090
You had to pay it all.

3694
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:42,870
Now pay it.

3695
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:47,870
Okay, do you think Spongebob would be good on OnlyFans?

3696
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:49,910
Because I'm looking for a sick combo right now.

3697
01:52:51,210 --> 01:52:52,930
Maybe it's time to go back to Fansly.

3698
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:55,290
It's time to head to that pole.

3699
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:56,510
Pipa... no, Pipa...

3700
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:57,590
Wait, what?

3701
01:52:57,770 --> 01:53:01,570
It comes off my tongue very easily.

3702
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:10,990
Put a pole in your 3D world.

3703
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:11,390
That works.

3704
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:12,030
Oh, yeah.

3705
01:53:12,030 --> 01:53:12,850
Put a pole in your 3D world.

3706
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:13,450
Yeah.

3707
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:14,350
It's my property!

3708
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:16,470
Wait, what is this?

3709
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:18,250
I own electricity!

3710
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:19,130
Electric!

3711
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:20,730
That could have been you, Fillion.

3712
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:25,670
I don't even need $14.

3713
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:26,650
I do like a trillion.

3714
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:29,410
I don't think Donald Trump could save me.

3715
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:30,490
This is fucking terrifying.

3716
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:32,430
I'll put another house here too.

3717
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:33,250
I can afford it now.

3718
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:35,190
Stay away from Illinois.

3719
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:37,870
Chicago isn't worth it.

3720
01:53:39,690 --> 01:53:40,450
Alright, nice.

3721
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:41,630
I have houses there.

3722
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:43,530
Entered.

3723
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:45,770
I'm so awesome.

3724
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:47,430
Oh, God.

3725
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:49,310
$6 in a dream, baby.

3726
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:49,670
Let's go.

3727
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:52,070
This is so scary.

3728
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:54,590
Oh, nobody owns that.

3729
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:54,950
What is that?

3730
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:55,870
Is that the chance?

3731
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:57,550
The community box?

3732
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:58,750
Yes, the community chest.

3733
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:01,970
Yeah, you did land on Lumi's place.

3734
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:02,950
You won $100!

3735
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:04,110
Yay!

3736
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:06,610
Nice shots!

3737
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:08,290
Your dog was rich.

3738
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:10,230
Holy shit, she's making it.

3739
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:14,050
Hey, Fillion, how are you feeling?

3740
01:54:14,370 --> 01:54:16,190
I like Skittles.

3741
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:17,290
Motherfucker.

3742
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:21,150
I landed on the three houses!

3743
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:22,550
Oh my God!

3744
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:26,450
You landed $800!

3745
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:27,130
$800!

3746
01:54:28,950 --> 01:54:29,510
$800!

3747
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:31,530
Yo, anyone, any GGers in the chat...

3748
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:32,450
$800 is fucking over.

3749
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:34,910
Nobody... Oh, you have to bill yourself.

3750
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:35,430
Jesus.

3751
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:39,510
Jesus Christ, man.

3752
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:40,110
Jesus fucking Christ.

3753
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:41,150
Yo, bill yourself now.

3754
01:54:42,170 --> 01:54:43,370
Wait, I own this, right?

3755
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:43,970
I own this.

3756
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:44,630
Yeah, you own this.

3757
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:45,630
You can bill yourself.

3758
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:47,830
Okay, we can take that off.

3759
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:48,790
Okay, wait, wait.

3760
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:49,490
$800?

3761
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:53,270
I have $38 with your name on them.

3762
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:54,050
Come on.

3763
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:56,470
I can't hear you, Fillion.

3764
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:57,830
No, I'll tell you who I am.

3765
01:54:58,150 --> 01:55:00,470
I'm saying Pippa's gonna be secretly rich.

3766
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:03,210
Lumi, I have $38 with your name on them.

3767
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:05,410
I literally have $38.

3768
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:06,650
I really can't... I have to mortgage it.

3769
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:06,910
Fuck!

3770
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:08,170
Let's do a deal, Lumi!

3771
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:09,590
You have to mortgage everything.

3772
01:55:10,050 --> 01:55:13,830
I don't think you can, Lumi Let's do a deal.

3773
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:16,070
Jesus...

3774
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:18,830
I don't think you can afford anything.

3775
01:55:19,650 --> 01:55:21,150
I don't think I can do this.

3776
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:22,550
I'm gonna make sure someone bankrupts it.

3777
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:26,490
I think you have to like, okay mortgage everything and see what happens...

3778
01:55:27,150 --> 01:55:27,590
$500.

3779
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:28,170
This is $80.

3780
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:28,930
$150.

3781
01:55:29,230 --> 01:55:30,670
Fillion, you have nothing.

3782
01:55:30,870 --> 01:55:32,690
She can't do anything with your money.

3783
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:33,850
$800.

3784
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:36,370
She owes 800!

3785
01:55:37,710 --> 01:55:39,770
You're leveraging things you know that have.

3786
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:41,790
I can 10x you in months!

3787
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:43,370
How could you?

3788
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,490
I can 10x you!

3789
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:47,590
I'm gonna sell...

3790
01:55:48,910 --> 01:55:50,050
I'm not gonna sell the orange.

3791
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:51,150
I'm gonna sell the...

3792
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:52,050
shit.

3793
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:55,870
Anyone want this shitty brown one?

3794
01:55:56,090 --> 01:55:57,170
I need my last dollar, chat.

3795
01:55:57,410 --> 01:55:59,570
God, what do I do?

3796
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:03,510
What's the point of three monopolies when you can't fucking sell shit?

3797
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:04,210
I'm selling... okay.

3798
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:09,330
Try mortgaging everything so you can afford it because it's 800 fucking dollars.

3799
01:56:09,950 --> 01:56:10,390
800?

3800
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:12,530
Fuck you, man.

3801
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:17,350
This is fucked up.

3802
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:19,330
I don't think... can you make it?

3803
01:56:19,490 --> 01:56:20,830
I mean, you have a lot of property.

3804
01:56:21,490 --> 01:56:22,850
Four dollar, nipple woman.

3805
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:23,750
I need a bailout.

3806
01:56:23,950 --> 01:56:25,170
I need a fucking bailout.

3807
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:26,230
Four dollar, nipple woman.

3808
01:56:26,410 --> 01:56:29,370
I can bail you out the remaining, I think.

3809
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:31,190
Four dollar, nipple woman.

3810
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:33,030
I'm gonna sell the...

3811
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:36,530
I'll give you two of my oranges.

3812
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:37,370
Alright.

3813
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:38,090
For 300.

3814
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:39,870
Yeah, I'll take it.

3815
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:42,230
305, because that's 800 exact.

3816
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:44,070
I'll give you two of the more expensive ones.

3817
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:44,550
How about that?

3818
01:56:44,650 --> 01:56:44,990
Alright.

3819
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:45,650
I'll give you these two.

3820
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:46,390
I'll take it.

3821
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:48,550
That way you won't even land on it.

3822
01:56:51,290 --> 01:56:52,250
How rich...

3823
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:54,590
How rich?

3824
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:56,010
More than 50 dollars.

3825
01:56:56,350 --> 01:56:56,670
Oh my god.

3826
01:56:57,290 --> 01:56:59,730
Can I be in the cool kids club?

3827
01:57:00,330 --> 01:57:01,090
I can't.

3828
01:57:02,650 --> 01:57:06,510
I have a thousand dollars in my bank account that I'm not accessing.

3829
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:08,350
It goes to a different school.

3830
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:08,750
Do you?

3831
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:09,570
Do you?

3832
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:10,690
I do.

3833
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:14,030
You can't just raise money for being poor.

3834
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:17,530
Yeah, I mean we're all fucking poor now.

3835
01:57:18,150 --> 01:57:19,710
That's how Monopoly works.

3836
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:21,150
That's how Monopoly works.

3837
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,010
305, that's all I need.

3838
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:23,390
Okay, I'll trade you for food stamps.

3839
01:57:23,590 --> 01:57:24,190
Come on, man.

3840
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:25,330
I'll just let you for a week.

3841
01:57:26,410 --> 01:57:26,990
She's so high.

3842
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:27,910
She's so bankrupt.

3843
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:29,950
Two oranges.

3844
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:32,050
She's so bankrupt.

3845
01:57:32,190 --> 01:57:33,010
What do you mean?

3846
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:34,010
Holy shit.

3847
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:35,610
I'm gonna have a dinosaur this week.

3848
01:57:35,630 --> 01:57:36,350
Please, man.

3849
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:39,970
How many times did I bail you out?

3850
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:42,430
Oh my god.

3851
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:43,910
It's exactly zero.

3852
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:44,790
This is fucked up.

3853
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:46,050
Oh my god.

3854
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:49,970
You know, a billion has a chance to land on Pippa Square too.

3855
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:52,410
Wait, if I land on Pippa Square, I'm fucking out.

3856
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:54,810
If you land on Pippa Square, you're fucking out.

3857
01:57:55,310 --> 01:57:56,930
If I land on Pippa Square, I'm out.

3858
01:57:56,930 --> 01:57:58,450
Just let me be in jail.

3859
01:57:58,610 --> 01:57:59,630
Let me be in jail.

3860
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:03,150
Boardwalk!

3861
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:06,090
What do you mean boardwalk?

3862
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:08,950
Yeah, I own boardwalk.

3863
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:11,030
I'm free!

3864
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:13,530
Yes!

3865
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:15,630
No, but you have to pay Lumi.

3866
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:17,350
Thank you.

3867
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:19,110
Thank you.

3868
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:20,950
You don't even have $52.

3869
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:24,570
You gotta boardcast your last property.

3870
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:26,910
Pippa Square.

3871
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:27,070
Pippa!

3872
01:58:27,490 --> 01:58:28,430
I love you.

3873
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:30,650
I'll give you the money.

3874
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:31,790
Wait, what?

3875
01:58:33,430 --> 01:58:35,270
Do you wanna get married?

3876
01:58:36,110 --> 01:58:36,430
No.

3877
01:58:36,530 --> 01:58:37,670
And you have to make a tweet.

3878
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:39,450
You have to make a tweet.

3879
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:42,890
You add Lumi, me, and Dokibird.

3880
01:58:45,050 --> 01:58:48,630
And you fill up the rest of the character limit with how great we are.

3881
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:49,490
Okay.

3882
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:51,790
But you have to put our ads at the end.

3883
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:53,410
So that it'll show up on your Twitter feed.

3884
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:56,070
And then put the ads on it.

3885
01:58:57,770 --> 01:58:59,350
Okay, give me one second.

3886
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:02,970
But you have to post a tweet in our Discord group.

3887
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:04,670
And then so we can approve it.

3888
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:06,270
And make edits if we need to.

3889
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:08,370
And Sam, you can tweet it out.

3890
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:10,450
Okay, okay, okay.

3891
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:12,510
Give me one second.

3892
01:59:14,910 --> 01:59:17,510
Pippa, how much are you gonna give me?

3893
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:18,470
And you have to pin the tweet.

3894
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:20,090
For at least a week.

3895
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:21,270
I don't wanna pin it.

3896
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:22,610
A hundred bucks is so worth.

3897
01:59:22,890 --> 01:59:24,550
And you have to pin it for at least a week.

3898
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:25,690
So you're saying your dignity is worth a billion?

3899
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:25,890
Yeah, yeah.

3900
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:30,210
You hear that chat?

3901
01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:34,030
One akasupa is worth one billion.

3902
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:37,610
I would never eat a tomato.

3903
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:41,010
I would never eat a tomato.

3904
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:41,870
Alex Jones.

3905
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:44,610
I love blonde people.

3906
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:45,130
I love blonde people.

3907
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:47,790
At Pippa.

3908
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:49,750
Wait, no, I should do Dokibird.

3909
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:50,710
Pippa first, of course.

3910
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:51,290
Right, Pippa?

3911
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:52,790
Pippa first.

3912
01:59:53,130 --> 01:59:56,090
At Pippa, at Dokibird.

3913
01:59:56,330 --> 01:59:58,210
Okay, at... what's the name of his Twitter?

3914
01:59:58,910 --> 02:00:00,490
What's the name of his Twitter?

3915
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:03,150
I'm gonna tag him in Austin Gaming.

3916
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:03,990
Alright.

3917
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:11,690
I would die on a sword for you.

3918
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:17,790
Guys, I would give you my brain transplant.

3919
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:20,370
Parenthesis.

3920
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:21,590
With your consent.

3921
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:28,410
I am nothing but a simp on the track.

3922
02:00:29,570 --> 02:00:30,530
Ka-chow.

3923
02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:32,090
Lightning.

3924
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:37,410
All I'm saying is that there's apparently a timer.

3925
02:00:37,590 --> 02:00:41,370
So like, if you run out of time, you don't even get this deal.

3926
02:00:42,230 --> 02:00:43,730
I'm putting it in the group DM.

3927
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:45,590
I'm putting it in the group DM.

3928
02:00:45,630 --> 02:00:46,190
I'm putting it in the group DM.

3929
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:49,230
You gotta type the right ad, man.

3930
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:50,050
What is your ad?

3931
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:58,430
No deal.

3932
02:00:58,470 --> 02:00:58,990
No deal.

3933
02:01:00,130 --> 02:01:05,310
This is exactly why I had her write it in our group chat first before she tweets it out.

3934
02:01:05,310 --> 02:01:06,410
Are you Lumi Kaneko or what?

3935
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:07,950
What is your name on Twitter, dawg?

3936
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:09,730
I think it's Kaneko underscore Lumi.

3937
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:10,510
I think.

3938
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:17,710
Kaneko underscore Lumi.

3939
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:18,770
Just copy it in.

3940
02:01:18,830 --> 02:01:19,390
Edit your tweet.

3941
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:20,070
Okay.

3942
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:22,630
You got this.

3943
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:24,290
I'll post it again.

3944
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:25,190
Alright, alright.

3945
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:26,990
There you go.

3946
02:01:27,010 --> 02:01:31,490
And then you gotta make sure that you pin that tweet for at least a week.

3947
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:32,670
Yeah, pin it.

3948
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:33,310
A week?

3949
02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:37,410
That's how much a hundred dollars...

3950
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:38,710
That's your worth.

3951
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:40,670
Is that not your worth, Billion?

3952
02:01:41,470 --> 02:01:42,890
Bro, it's like Animal Farm.

3953
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:44,530
Or you go bankrupt now.

3954
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:46,030
You go bankrupt now.

3955
02:01:46,270 --> 02:01:47,510
I'm tweeting, I'm tweeting, I'm tweeting.

3956
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:50,990
You can't be serious, dude.

3957
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:51,910
Oh my god.

3958
02:01:56,090 --> 02:01:57,270
Is this what you want?

3959
02:01:59,150 --> 02:02:00,670
Is this what you want from me?

3960
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:02,250
Alright, Billion.

3961
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,050
Is this...

3962
02:02:03,050 --> 02:02:03,970
Just press enter.

3963
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:05,970
We're waiting for you to accept the deal.

3964
02:02:06,770 --> 02:02:08,490
I want you guys to say sorry.

3965
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:09,070
Why?

3966
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:10,210
What do we do?

3967
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:10,950
It's just business.

3968
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:12,030
She bailed you out.

3969
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:13,290
Yeah, she bailed you out.

3970
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:16,330
You gotta say thank you to Pippa.

3971
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:17,690
You got 300 likes.

3972
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:20,950
You gotta say thank you to Pippa.

3973
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:22,550
Thank you, Pippa, for bailing me out.

3974
02:02:22,950 --> 02:02:24,170
I'm so...

3975
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,630
My life is in your debt, Pippa.

3976
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:27,870
You gotta say that to her.

3977
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:29,510
She literally bailed you out.

3978
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:32,990
She noticed.

3979
02:02:34,130 --> 02:02:35,690
I was hoping you would notice.

3980
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:36,790
You didn't fucking see it.

3981
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:37,450
Stitch!

3982
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:44,830
You're gonna make me embarrass myself like an effing rich person playing Squid Game and then when I'm effing done you're gonna trim my armor?

3983
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:48,130
Who do you think I am?

3984
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:52,450
Someone must have ratted out in her chat.

3985
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:53,730
There's no way she noticed it herself.

3986
02:02:54,730 --> 02:02:56,390
I learned from my mistakes.

3987
02:02:57,850 --> 02:02:59,010
How do I take this junk out?

3988
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:00,470
I don't even know what it is.

3989
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:01,710
How do you take this junk out?

3990
02:03:01,870 --> 02:03:02,970
You press enter.

3991
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:05,570
Yeah.

3992
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:07,130
You press space and enter.

3993
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:08,230
Oh, wait.

3994
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,140
Oh my god!

3995
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:14,440
Billion!

3996
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:15,440
Thank you!

3997
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:16,780
Billion!

3998
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:24,100
Billion!

3999
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:26,220
Pippa!

4000
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:27,140
Pippa!

4001
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,000
Trim my property back.

4002
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:32,580
I'm gonna delete the tweet.

4003
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:33,580
Trim my property back.

4004
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,820
Trim me it back or I delete the tweet.

4005
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,420
If you delete the tweet, I'll never bail you out again.

4006
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:40,420
I'll never bail you out again.

4007
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:41,960
No, no!

4008
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:43,460
Give me my property back!

4009
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,860
I will never bail you out.

4010
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:47,100
No, my honor is with you.

4011
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,760
It has 1,000 likes in one minute.

4012
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:50,840
Please, please.

4013
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,620
I'm getting mauled on Twitter.

4014
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:54,320
I'm gonna play.

4015
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:56,040
Trim me.

4016
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:00,580
Any publicity is good publicity.

4017
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,040
Any publicity is good publicity.

4018
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:02,280
No, no.

4019
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,300
I don't want any tweet ever.

4020
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:07,540
No, I'm gonna delete the tweet.

4021
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:10,120
Please, please, Pippa.

4022
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:10,760
Please.

4023
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:15,000
Pippa, you literally have an advantage over her.

4024
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:15,400
Pippa, you literally have an advantage over her.

4025
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:16,900
She's like banking on her knees.

4026
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:18,580
You can ask for anything from her now.

4027
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:21,220
Pippa, give me my property back.

4028
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:21,960
I'm not kidding.

4029
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:24,460
I'm not kidding, Fillian.

4030
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:25,780
Yeah, the adults are talking.

4031
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,540
I'm gonna delete the tweet.

4032
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:31,060
What do you think?

4033
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:35,120
You gotta ask her to do something embarrassing now.

4034
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:36,340
I'm gonna delete the tweet.

4035
02:04:36,580 --> 02:04:40,280
If you delete the tweet, we're never bailing you out on Monopoly.

4036
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,960
I'd rather die than not send a tweet.

4037
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:44,060
I'm not gonna go out on a skim.

4038
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:45,940
I'm not going on a skim.

4039
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:48,660
I'm not going on a skim.

4040
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:51,940
So, you'd rather be the first one to lose in Monopoly?

4041
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:52,540
Yes.

4042
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:54,080
That's what you'd rather be the loser in Monopoly?

4043
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:54,100
See?

4044
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:56,120
The first one to lose.

4045
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:57,660
Okay, you know what?

4046
02:04:57,700 --> 02:04:58,100
Frick you.

4047
02:04:58,160 --> 02:04:58,720
Maybe I don't.

4048
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,140
Four of us.

4049
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:04,760
You would want to be the first in that group.

4050
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:05,140
Okay, just talk.

4051
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:05,300
Talk.

4052
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:05,580
Talk.

4053
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:07,100
Just effing talk.

4054
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:08,960
It's at 1,500 likes.

4055
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:09,480
Thanks, guys.

4056
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:13,340
At the VTuber Awards, can you say you're the loser at Monopoly?

4057
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:14,120
Oh, my bad.

4058
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:14,340
Sorry.

4059
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:15,360
It's at 2,000 likes.

4060
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:15,800
I lied.

4061
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:19,600
At the next VTuber Awards, just say Fillion, the loser at Monopoly.

4062
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:20,880
Yeah, and we'll bail you out.

4063
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:21,940
We'll trade you.

4064
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:28,520
Pippa, we'll trade you back to property if at the VTuber Awards, you say I am bad at Monopoly.

4065
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:29,620
Yeah.

4066
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:34,960
At the VTuber Awards, you have to be like, I'm terrible at Monopoly.

4067
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:37,160
And we will trade the...

4068
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:38,640
Pippa will trade back to territory.

4069
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:40,560
No, I want something I can do right now.

4070
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:41,540
No, we will have an IOU.

4071
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,460
We'll just have an IOU for the VTuber Awards.

4072
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:44,440
Give me something I can do right now.

4073
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:47,900
What's the most embarrassing thing you can possibly do?

4074
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:49,200
Probably delete a tweet.

4075
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:50,740
No.

4076
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:51,560
Make the tweet your banner.

4077
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:53,060
Oh, yeah.

4078
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,620
Oh, true.

4079
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,800
You would do this to me?

4080
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,340
Make the tweet your Twitter banner.

4081
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:02,700
And your YouTube channel banner.

4082
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:04,260
Because it has 2 million subscribers.

4083
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,740
Pippa, she has more subscribers.

4084
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:13,040
She has more people on her YouTube channel than her Twitter.

4085
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,000
So she should make it a banner on her YouTube channel.

4086
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:15,640
No, no, no, no.

4087
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:16,820
YouTube banner.

4088
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:17,420
YouTube banner.

4089
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:20,760
You get the territory back.

4090
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:22,420
You get your property back.

4091
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:23,940
You get your property back.

4092
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,160
I'll just lose Monopoly.

4093
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:26,680
That's fine.

4094
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:28,860
Just lose Monopoly.

4095
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:30,240
Just lose Monopoly.

4096
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,040
I'll delete the whole of your tweet.

4097
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:35,040
You'd rather lose Monopoly.

4098
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:36,440
It's billion.

4099
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:38,080
It's such a small thing.

4100
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:39,760
I'm going to end stream on the radio.

4101
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,560
It's just a small thing.

4102
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:43,500
Billion.

4103
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:45,520
Why are you letting Monopoly get to you?

4104
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:47,660
Just make it my Twitter banner.

4105
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:51,260
Because at least it can take the plate on one platform.

4106
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:52,460
On the Twitter banner?

4107
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:53,380
Okay, nice.

4108
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:53,920
Alright, sure.

4109
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:56,740
Now I just negotiate myself backwards.

4110
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:59,960
You know how negotiating works?

4111
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:01,540
You give a long, tall order.

4112
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,580
So they'll want you to do...

4113
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:03,600
I'm not winning Monopoly.

4114
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:07,160
You didn't want us to do this.

4115
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,460
What the hell is this?

4116
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:10,340
Okay, whatever.

4117
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:11,720
That's how negotiating works.

4118
02:07:11,820 --> 02:07:13,420
You give a very big demand.

4119
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:15,500
And then it'll make them want to do the louder demand.

4120
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:18,040
Because you weren't going to do the Twitter thing at first.

4121
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:20,740
Alright, banner.

4122
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:22,520
Alright, Twitter banner now.

4123
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:23,700
I am!

4124
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:26,040
Part of the deal, baby.

4125
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:29,480
Ah, na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

4126
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:31,660
Okay.

4127
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:32,500
Edit profile.

4128
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,360
Change my effing banner.

4129
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:35,380
Downwards.

4130
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,280
This is so dumb.

4131
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:40,640
This is so dumb.

4132
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:43,060
This is so dumb.

4133
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:46,760
The best trade trailer there used to be.

4134
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:49,480
If you call my Twitter, it'll be the same.

4135
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:50,700
I did it!

4136
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:52,940
Bro, we're getting an ad space.

4137
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,540
I'm putting my profile finger stuck in the middle of my face.

4138
02:07:57,600 --> 02:07:57,980
Alright.

4139
02:07:58,280 --> 02:07:58,840
Alright.

4140
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:00,080
Are we done?

4141
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:01,060
Yep.

4142
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:05,160
Just pay for it at $52 so we can trade.

4143
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:06,500
Hit the pay.

4144
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,480
Give me my money.

4145
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:09,620
Please, give me my property back.

4146
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:10,320
Press on!

4147
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:13,380
Okay, you do it for me.

4148
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:13,840
I don't want to do this.

4149
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:15,200
Oh my god.

4150
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:20,020
Yes.

4151
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:25,900
Okay.

4152
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:29,900
Now, and then you have to ask for...

4153
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:31,360
Give a little bit of money.

4154
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:32,840
Okay, I'll give a dollar.

4155
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:34,080
Okay.

4156
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:34,660
Alright.

4157
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:35,080
There you go.

4158
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:38,440
Hit... no, it's not.

4159
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:39,280
Hit enter!

4160
02:08:40,580 --> 02:08:41,040
Hit enter!

4161
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:44,420
I'm deleting the tweet!

4162
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:45,460
No!

4163
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:46,020
No, no, you...

4164
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:48,460
You said a week.

4165
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:51,900
I did that, but now guess what?

4166
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:52,860
Who's gonna stop me now?

4167
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:54,140
Who's gonna stop me?

4168
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:57,440
What is it?

4169
02:08:57,460 --> 02:08:58,080
A fussy baby.

4170
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:02,760
We were making business negotiations.

4171
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:03,660
I know!

4172
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:06,620
You don't get to talk while the other guys are talking.

4173
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:07,460
You should've talked to me.

4174
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:08,420
I'm gonna go to the kids table, Fillion.

4175
02:09:08,660 --> 02:09:10,520
I'm gonna go to preschool all over again.

4176
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:12,840
This is Fillion and her fucking zoo pals place.

4177
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:16,500
My face is so familiar with the inside of a toilet from the number of straws I've gotten.

4178
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:17,980
Please stop being like that.

4179
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:22,360
Yeah, I own this property!

4180
02:09:22,820 --> 02:09:23,200
Jesus.

4181
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:25,840
No honor.

4182
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:27,040
No honor, man.

4183
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:30,220
I think Pippa's gonna win this in the end.

4184
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:31,700
Her property is scary.

4185
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:34,000
I don't know.

4186
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:35,380
It's Bettina!

4187
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:36,280
It's Bettina!

4188
02:09:38,420 --> 02:09:40,060
Oh my god, boardwalk!

4189
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:41,860
Hey, $50!

4190
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:42,380
Oh, that's mine?

4191
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:42,840
That's mine?

4192
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:43,860
Yeah, that's the money!

4193
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,660
Hey, Fillion, remember when you landed on boardwalk?

4194
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:49,400
Yeah, remember that?

4195
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,460
That was so funny.

4196
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,540
That's the place you boys wanted.

4197
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:58,780
I could've been paying you $50.

4198
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:01,980
Can I get in jail, please?

4199
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:03,420
Yeah, I wanna go to jail.

4200
02:10:03,860 --> 02:10:04,240
I want jail.

4201
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:05,200
Give me jail.

4202
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:06,920
I don't wanna be here anymore.

4203
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:09,160
Oh, you got that!

4204
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:10,660
Oh, you got afforded!

4205
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,200
Jesus!

4206
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:14,160
But Pippa can.

4207
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:16,140
I'm just fucking withdrawing.

4208
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:18,080
Enjoy your property.

4209
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:22,720
I don't know what you expect, Fillion.

4210
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,460
We didn't win $1!

4211
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:28,940
You have to withdraw.

4212
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:30,920
Please.

4213
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:31,820
Please.

4214
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:35,780
$121.

4215
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:41,980
This is horrifying.

4216
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,100
This whole game is fucked up.

4217
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,520
I'll enter.

4218
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:49,620
Just let me fast go.

4219
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:51,060
Okay.

4220
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:56,240
We're at the stage where it's like it's the final countdown.

4221
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:59,120
And everyone's gonna get bankrupt first.

4222
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,460
Wait for death.

4223
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:02,580
You have to pay $100.

4224
02:11:02,820 --> 02:11:04,220
You don't have money, but...

4225
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:06,200
You don't have...

4226
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:06,460
I love your...

4227
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:09,480
What tweet do you guys want?

4228
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:10,420
Just mortgage.

4229
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:11,340
Just mortgage.

4230
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,060
You have one more property to mortgage.

4231
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:13,440
I know.

4232
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:14,180
I can tweet too.

4233
02:11:16,020 --> 02:11:18,040
Well, we know you're gonna delete the tweet.

4234
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:19,160
This is how you get addicted to drugs, no?

4235
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:20,240
It's like, yeah, don't worry.

4236
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:22,320
I can just sell off a body part.

4237
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:23,220
Just give me a little...

4238
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:23,700
One hit.

4239
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:27,580
The thing is we can't trust you anymore because you said you delete tweets.

4240
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,260
So we can't trust you about tweets anymore.

4241
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:30,700
I'm not my mama.

4242
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:31,840
I'm not mama.

4243
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:35,520
You are making me kick...

4244
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,200
You are evicting me from my home.

4245
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:38,080
Just so you know.

4246
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:39,740
We are evicting a VTuber.

4247
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,560
Your arrogance did this.

4248
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:43,780
Yeah, your arrogance did this.

4249
02:11:43,780 --> 02:11:44,140
My arrogance?

4250
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:44,640
What do you mean?

4251
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:46,220
Biblically accurate Elden Ring characters?

4252
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:46,700
What?

4253
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:50,320
The price of your own arrogance, Millian.

4254
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:51,260
Oh, how she's fallen.

4255
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:53,200
Okay, like what is this?

4256
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:56,020
You don't even pay it to like us.

4257
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:58,060
Yeah, you pay it to like the government.

4258
02:11:58,460 --> 02:11:59,260
The government.

4259
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:01,500
I am not a fan of the government.

4260
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,260
I'm not a fan of the government.

4261
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:04,140
I'm not a fan of the government.

4262
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:06,280
I think I might have to mortgage soon.

4263
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:07,600
I don't think I'm gonna survive.

4264
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:09,840
Pippa is fucking scary.

4265
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,960
Apparently the FaZe next CEO saw my tweet.

4266
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:13,300
Okay.

4267
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,400
Yeah, he's laughing at you.

4268
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:16,220
That's great.

4269
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:16,580
Okay.

4270
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:17,640
Yo, can I join FaZe?

4271
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:19,640
Oh hey, another Ghetto Jeffery card.

4272
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:20,380
Nice.

4273
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:22,800
Now Saginaw, can he bail me out?

4274
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:25,040
Saginaw, I need a bailout.

4275
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:27,580
Yo Fish, if I join FaZe Connect, can you give me a thousand bucks?

4276
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:30,260
You bail her out.

4277
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,040
Millian, I'll give you 500.

4278
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:32,880
500, you join FaZe.

4279
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:33,640
Yeah, I'm going Corpo.

4280
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:35,620
Alright, like...

4281
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:36,620
How much?

4282
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:39,800
You give me 500 if I join?

4283
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:42,060
Okay, sweet.

4284
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:43,340
I'm in.

4285
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:47,740
I'll join, and then we won't sign a prenup.

4286
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:50,100
What?

4287
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:50,680
What?

4288
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,520
Why would you sign a prenup for FaZe Clan?

4289
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:55,520
What?

4290
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:01,620
Wait, okay, so be honest.

4291
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:02,820
Do you have independence or not?

4292
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:04,600
Independence?

4293
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:05,340
Like, what do you mean?

4294
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:06,760
Can you make a pen dance?

4295
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,040
What?

4296
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:09,380
Do you have independence?

4297
02:13:11,020 --> 02:13:11,640
Pineapple pen?

4298
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:18,180
Pippa, Pippa, I'll give you a Ghetto Jeffery card for the last blue.

4299
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:20,440
Sounds good.

4300
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:22,780
Let's do it.

4301
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:25,680
This is fucked up, man.

4302
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:26,800
This is fucked up.

4303
02:13:27,120 --> 02:13:29,420
Can you even trade the get out of jail free card?

4304
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:30,080
Yeah, you can.

4305
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:31,300
Yeah.

4306
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:33,540
The future is now, old man.

4307
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:37,000
And then I will take the blue.

4308
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:38,320
Wait, Pippa, why would you...

4309
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,020
Don't you want to be in jail?

4310
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:44,080
She can pretend she can get out, but she wouldn't.

4311
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:44,620
It's a choice.

4312
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:45,940
She doesn't have to use it.

4313
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:49,840
Pippa, you think this is gonna get you somewhere?

4314
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:51,260
She doesn't have to use it.

4315
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:52,960
Who's using you, Pippa?

4316
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:55,240
I'm business around here.

4317
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:56,140
What do you mean?

4318
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:59,540
You don't even deserve to be on my board right now.

4319
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:01,360
Oh my god.

4320
02:14:01,420 --> 02:14:02,680
It's your fault I'm broke.

4321
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:04,340
My fault?

4322
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:06,480
The corruption is insane, man.

4323
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:09,060
The corruption is insane, man.

4324
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:10,500
You made your bed, Fillion.

4325
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:12,800
VTuber doesn't take responsibility.

4326
02:14:13,420 --> 02:14:14,640
I never will.

4327
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,160
My bed bugs pay rent.

4328
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:19,340
Yeah.

4329
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:21,400
Doesn't look like it.

4330
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:27,340
She got us in jail.

4331
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:29,620
Oh my god.

4332
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:30,860
She got the best card.

4333
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:31,820
Hey, Pippa.

4334
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:33,760
Why don't you use it to get out of jail, Pippa?

4335
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:35,580
Why don't you get out of jail, Pippa?

4336
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:36,260
Come on.

4337
02:14:36,380 --> 02:14:36,900
Do it.

4338
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:39,780
I mean, I can with the card I just got that you made fun of me for getting.

4339
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:40,180
You're gonna.

4340
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:41,700
I know you are.

4341
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:42,940
You want to get out of jail.

4342
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:43,640
I know you do.

4343
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:44,480
Please let me out of jail.

4344
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:45,320
Let me in jail.

4345
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:46,260
Let me in jail.

4346
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:50,040
I'm gonna hate this game.

4347
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:52,400
Oh my god.

4348
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:54,540
Yeah.

4349
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:57,220
He got taxed.

4350
02:14:57,560 --> 02:14:57,940
No, I see it.

4351
02:14:58,040 --> 02:15:00,920
I'm so fucked up.

4352
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:02,520
Oh my god.

4353
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:04,860
Loomy is stealing from the self-checkout.

4354
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:07,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4355
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:08,400
That's what you get.

4356
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,820
I put those gummy bears in my pockets so what?

4357
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:12,780
Oh my god.

4358
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:14,680
I'm not allowed to live.

4359
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:16,840
What is that?

4360
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:18,280
That's eight.

4361
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:19,700
That's a lot of numbers.

4362
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,100
Oh, hey, it's your own property.

4363
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:23,680
You got saved.

4364
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:26,540
No, no, she mortgaged it, didn't she?

4365
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:28,200
Yeah, she mortgaged it.

4366
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:31,580
But she can't do anything with it.

4367
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:32,500
Can't do it.

4368
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:33,220
No, I can buy a house.

4369
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:34,360
I mean, you can, yeah.

4370
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,460
Wait, what does mortgaging do again?

4371
02:15:37,780 --> 02:15:40,380
The other spaces, you don't pay anything on the other spaces.

4372
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:41,680
Oh.

4373
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:46,280
If we pay our other two squares that she mortgaged, then we don't have to pay her anything.

4374
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:47,880
Okay, so I have a spot again.

4375
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:48,600
I have a spot again.

4376
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:51,740
No, you don't because you're still mortgaging that spot.

4377
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:52,260
Well, I bought it.

4378
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:52,880
I just bought it back.

4379
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:53,600
I just bought it back.

4380
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:56,260
I own a mortgage.

4381
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:57,960
You don't.

4382
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:00,160
I own a mortgage.

4383
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:03,060
Oh my god, $50.

4384
02:16:04,220 --> 02:16:06,120
My only property is a new sauna.

4385
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:07,420
$50 is better than $800.

4386
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:08,200
I'll take it.

4387
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:12,080
As long as we have a new pipa.

4388
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:12,960
I own a property.

4389
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:15,020
I'm not a property owner.

4390
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:16,580
Dude, I'm one of the elites.

4391
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:18,600
So guys, do you want to get pizza this Saturday?

4392
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:19,040
Yeah.

4393
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:23,260
Do you guys want to have a pizza party?

4394
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:26,100
Pizza party?

4395
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:26,760
We want money.

4396
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:28,900
I have a house.

4397
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:30,000
We can crash at my place.

4398
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:33,440
Can you afford pizza right now?

4399
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:34,360
No.

4400
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:38,220
The pizza hut, they told me I would have burned.

4401
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:40,480
Scavenging from the table.

4402
02:16:40,540 --> 02:16:40,740
Yeah.

4403
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:41,300
It's like this.

4404
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:43,460
You know what?

4405
02:16:43,460 --> 02:16:44,140
Your website won.

4406
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:45,500
Hey, pipa.

4407
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:47,200
Nice to see you.

4408
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:48,680
Good to see you too.

4409
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:51,120
Learning to be a lawyer.

4410
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:52,540
Yeah.

4411
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:55,260
Gonna be a jail lawyer.

4412
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:56,580
How do you do?

4413
02:16:58,020 --> 02:16:59,500
Blue, who's blue?

4414
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:00,140
Oh no.

4415
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,320
It's fine.

4416
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:03,940
It's like $5.

4417
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:05,520
It's okay, it's a mortgage.

4418
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:08,420
Yeah, it's mortgage so you're fine.

4419
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:09,580
You got saved.

4420
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:10,640
Can I borrow from you?

4421
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:11,160
No.

4422
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:14,180
You actually got saved.

4423
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:16,980
I think Lumi can un-mortgage this soon.

4424
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,860
I think I can if I get close.

4425
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:21,020
Wait, can I un-mortgage my property if I have the money?

4426
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:22,100
You can if you have the money, yeah.

4427
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:24,340
Why am I doing that then?

4428
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:26,280
Well, I don't fucking know.

4429
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:29,620
That's your choice.

4430
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:33,820
I never want something like that.

4431
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:34,120
You know what?

4432
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:34,580
I'll buy it.

4433
02:17:34,580 --> 02:17:36,860
I'll buy it.

4434
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:43,440
What's the proposal?

4435
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:45,560
This little property called Bump the Cabin.

4436
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:49,440
Alright, what's the proposal?

4437
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:51,120
I'll give it to you for $80.

4438
02:17:51,320 --> 02:17:52,020
For $80?

4439
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:53,040
I'll take it.

4440
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:53,420
$80?

4441
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:57,080
Does anyone wanna go on a walk?

4442
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:57,600
It's free.

4443
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:03,320
We can steal a dog from the park.

4444
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:03,860
The low low price is $80.

4445
02:18:03,860 --> 02:18:04,280
$80.

4446
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:08,020
I will give you a full monopoly.

4447
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:09,700
I'll take it.

4448
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:11,020
That sounds like a good deal.

4449
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:13,500
Wait, that's mine.

4450
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:15,000
Wait, is that?

4451
02:18:15,180 --> 02:18:17,200
No, that's right.

4452
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:18,760
Alright, here we go.

4453
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:21,360
Nice deal.

4454
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:21,960
$80.

4455
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:25,600
I'm just struggling to live, okay?

4456
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:28,900
After people bankrupted me.

4457
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:30,620
What am I doing?

4458
02:18:30,620 --> 02:18:31,660
I'm just trying to watch you right now, bro.

4459
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:32,960
Look at this bitch!

4460
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,280
And now she's hiding in jail.

4461
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:35,860
That's what the mafiosos do.

4462
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:37,040
That's how the rich survive.

4463
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:39,340
She doesn't have to pay taxes because she's in jail.

4464
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:41,460
Yeah, she doesn't have to do shit.

4465
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:42,980
She just sits in jail and chills.

4466
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:44,820
Legally, I have no income.

4467
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:45,720
You're AFK!

4468
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:48,780
You're having AFK!

4469
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:52,360
I hate this game.

4470
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:53,940
I wanna be in jail.

4471
02:18:53,940 --> 02:18:54,500
You chose it.

4472
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:56,300
I wanna be in jail.

4473
02:18:56,300 --> 02:18:57,320
You did choose it.

4474
02:18:57,320 --> 02:18:58,060
You did.

4475
02:18:59,420 --> 02:19:00,980
You get to have your...

4476
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:03,500
You just have to look through your properties.

4477
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:06,200
You guys made me tweet about it.

4478
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:06,500
Nice.

4479
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,680
Alright, end turn.

4480
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:11,580
Does that mean Fillion's gonna pay me?

4481
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:13,220
No, she has to land on it again.

4482
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:13,560
No, it's not my turn.

4483
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:15,360
No, it is your turn.

4484
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:16,280
What do you mean, Fillion?

4485
02:19:17,860 --> 02:19:18,940
Roll a two, Fillion.

4486
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:20,520
Roll a two.

4487
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:21,460
I wanna come and hit her.

4488
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:23,600
It's my property.

4489
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:24,400
What is that?

4490
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:24,900
What is that?

4491
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:27,860
Stop!

4492
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:28,380
Stop!

4493
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:29,040
Stop!

4494
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:33,200
You can't even afford...

4495
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:34,780
Guys, it's time to mortgage again.

4496
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:37,560
It's time to mortgage.

4497
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:40,060
Okay, that's fine.

4498
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:40,840
I'll mortgage.

4499
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:43,380
Get back and then...

4500
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:43,820
board.

4501
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:46,020
Okay, that's fine.

4502
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:48,520
She can't even afford it with a mortgage.

4503
02:19:49,860 --> 02:19:50,600
Can I...

4504
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:51,940
Can anyone...

4505
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:54,660
You just need like...

4506
02:19:54,660 --> 02:19:55,600
I have a gun.

4507
02:19:55,720 --> 02:19:56,040
I have a gun.

4508
02:19:57,820 --> 02:19:59,060
I want to trade.

4509
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:01,060
You want to trade with Pippa?

4510
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:01,980
You only need $58.

4511
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:03,660
Who wants to trade me?

4512
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,620
What's $58 worth to you, Fillion?

4513
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:07,720
God, at least one kidney.

4514
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:10,800
Maybe even a contact bar?

4515
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:12,420
Give us one of your blues.

4516
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:14,880
Okay.

4517
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:15,980
Alright.

4518
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:18,780
That's fine.

4519
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:19,800
Oh my god.

4520
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:21,160
Pippa, take it.

4521
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:21,860
Take the blue.

4522
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:22,920
Take one of the blue.

4523
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:24,800
We could sell some feet pics right now on the internet.

4524
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:25,880
Okay.

4525
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:26,820
Wait, does she have a blue?

4526
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:27,160
Yeah.

4527
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:29,700
Take one of her light blue so she doesn't have her monopoly anymore.

4528
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:30,520
She's that desperate.

4529
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:31,260
I don't need to do that to me.

4530
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,200
I'm literally that big.

4531
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:33,600
You said okay.

4532
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:35,460
You were taken away from me.

4533
02:20:35,580 --> 02:20:36,760
You literally said okay.

4534
02:20:37,580 --> 02:20:40,040
Why is Amazon trying to mug her?

4535
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:40,680
You know what?

4536
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:42,600
I'll trade with you.

4537
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:44,200
I'll trade with you for that blue property.

4538
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:45,120
No.

4539
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:45,680
Pippa.

4540
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:48,360
$6 for content reasons.

4541
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:49,700
What?

4542
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:50,900
Content reasons.

4543
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:54,240
I'm mainstream.

4544
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:55,020
I'm mainstream.

4545
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:55,780
Please.

4546
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:58,560
I come to you a humble traveler.

4547
02:20:59,000 --> 02:20:59,740
Uh huh.

4548
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:00,460
How humble?

4549
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:02,500
I'll give you a dollar.

4550
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:04,040
Denigrate yourself.

4551
02:21:04,660 --> 02:21:06,280
I will give you a dollar.

4552
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,460
You will give me...

4553
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:12,140
At least...

4554
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:12,560
$3.

4555
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:16,240
You can't afford the...

4556
02:21:16,840 --> 02:21:18,160
I was gonna say not $3.

4557
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:20,840
And now we can be best friends forever.

4558
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:22,660
Final law.

4559
02:21:22,740 --> 02:21:23,000
Uh huh.

4560
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:24,820
Final offer.

4561
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:25,760
Take your blues.

4562
02:21:25,780 --> 02:21:28,080
How do I add the money?

4563
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:31,040
How do I...here?

4564
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,900
There it is.

4565
02:21:32,980 --> 02:21:33,140
Deal.

4566
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:34,500
I'm supposed to give you...

4567
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:36,360
Pippa.

4568
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:40,240
You know, we've been through a lot back in our day.

4569
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,560
I just wanted to say...

4570
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,360
Your hair is so effing nice.

4571
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:46,600
Some days I dream about a white Christmas.

4572
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:50,980
Where I...

4573
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:51,860
I...

4574
02:21:51,860 --> 02:21:52,240
I...

4575
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:52,980
Uh huh.

4576
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:56,040
Oh, I'm lagging.

4577
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:01,760
Pippa, how about this?

4578
02:22:01,800 --> 02:22:02,980
I'll impress you.

4579
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:06,940
Sticking out your gut for the Rizlan.

4580
02:22:07,060 --> 02:22:07,680
I'm not impressed.

4581
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:10,060
You have to ask for two properties because she did that.

4582
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:10,660
I'm trying.

4583
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:19,260
I'll sweeten the deal a bit.

4584
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,320
Bro, you messed with her.

4585
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:22,940
You just declared bankruptcy, Fillion.

4586
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:24,380
This is not worth it.

4587
02:22:24,460 --> 02:22:25,800
You just declared bankruptcy.

4588
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:27,880
You practically lost everything.

4589
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:32,640
You don't even have anything anymore after you do this deal.

4590
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:33,800
You don't even have anything anymore after you do this deal.

4591
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:36,340
Fillion, think of your dignity, Fillion.

4592
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:37,580
Fillion, think of your dignity, Fillion.

4593
02:22:37,580 --> 02:22:38,860
Fillion, just declare bankruptcy.

4594
02:22:38,980 --> 02:22:40,600
You basically lose.

4595
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,220
Fillion, it's good content.

4596
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:44,840
Alright, give me everything you own.

4597
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:46,060
It's good content.

4598
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:48,800
Think of it this way.

4599
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:49,600
If you declare...

4600
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,980
Oh my god.

4601
02:22:51,740 --> 02:22:54,060
Oh my god.

4602
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:58,260
The mortgage was only $66.

4603
02:22:58,460 --> 02:22:59,800
That's so sad.

4604
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:01,480
That's so sad.

4605
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:03,340
That's so sad.

4606
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:06,320
Holy shit.

4607
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:07,840
Thank you, Fillion.

4608
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,160
I think Pippa's gonna win.

4609
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:10,020
There's no way.

4610
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:13,540
There's no way she loses.

4611
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:16,900
Was it worth it, Fillion?

4612
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:18,240
No.

4613
02:23:19,820 --> 02:23:21,460
She's practically homeless.

4614
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:22,380
You guys are the same way.

4615
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:24,080
It's like I'm talking to a pack of flamingos.

4616
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:28,580
Bro, Fillion's just homeless now.

4617
02:23:28,660 --> 02:23:29,520
She owns nothing.

4618
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:31,360
That's actually crazy.

4619
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:35,100
Fillion, can we still have pizza at your house?

4620
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:36,480
Yeah, what house?

4621
02:23:37,820 --> 02:23:40,320
Bro, my house is closed for renovations.

4622
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:41,100
It's closed.

4623
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:42,660
We're renovating it.

4624
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:43,820
We're renovating it.

4625
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:45,080
We're renovating it.

4626
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:45,920
Yeah?

4627
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:49,280
Yeah, I'm not going for you.

4628
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,300
Yay, they got it.

4629
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:52,320
Got mortgaged.

4630
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:53,160
Holy shit.

4631
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:56,360
I wanna go home!

4632
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:59,340
You don't have one.

4633
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:00,260
Oh.

4634
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:02,680
Dad!

4635
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:03,060
Let's see.

4636
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:06,980
Bro, I'm deflated.

4637
02:24:07,660 --> 02:24:09,900
That whole avenue is fucked up.

4638
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:10,560
I know.

4639
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:12,320
That whole side of the board.

4640
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:14,960
It's like over the fucking land on there, man.

4641
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:15,420
Holy shit.

4642
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:16,800
That whole side is scary.

4643
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:17,960
Holy shit.

4644
02:24:18,220 --> 02:24:19,860
I fucking hate that.

4645
02:24:21,940 --> 02:24:22,500
That's a shit.

4646
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:23,800
I wish I was in jail too.

4647
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:26,180
You just jailed me in jail, bro.

4648
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:28,320
I wish I was in jail.

4649
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:29,540
You just jailed me in jail, bro.

4650
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:30,940
Oh, wow.

4651
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:32,600
You just gained money.

4652
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:35,140
No, you have to pay 50 now.

4653
02:24:36,020 --> 02:24:38,060
Yeah, or you used to get a free jail card.

4654
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:39,960
Betrayed dog.

4655
02:24:40,340 --> 02:24:42,280
Alright, alright.

4656
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:43,000
Nice, nice.

4657
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:43,920
Thanks, people.

4658
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:45,580
Thank you.

4659
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:46,900
This is $14.

4660
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:54,180
Remember when I like, hoped and dreamed in a family and children and prospects and like, I'm like at least $16 in my bank account.

4661
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:56,020
Yeah, no, it's not $16.

4662
02:24:56,020 --> 02:24:57,040
You have $241.

4663
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:58,620
Look at that thing.

4664
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:01,740
Wait, with this money, I summon a victory.

4665
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:02,780
In like 10 minutes.

4666
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:05,120
Yeah, when the property is still around.

4667
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:06,040
I don't think...

4668
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:08,640
Okay, does anyone wanna...

4669
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:09,360
Fuck.

4670
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:12,380
Okay, I'm gonna eat this.

4671
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:13,680
At least it's not...

4672
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:16,500
Hey, Doki, you want a monopoly?

4673
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:17,600
Hell yeah.

4674
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,600
I'll get that monopoly.

4675
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:22,500
I can win this chat.

4676
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:23,880
I can win this.

4677
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,360
Okay, okay.

4678
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:28,680
I can win this.

4679
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:31,920
Hey, Doki, I've got this one property.

4680
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,540
I'm gonna make a limited skin.

4681
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:33,920
Yeah, I'll take it.

4682
02:25:35,220 --> 02:25:37,340
50 and then I'll bail you out.

4683
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:38,400
Don't worry, I got you.

4684
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:39,920
How much do you need?

4685
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:42,340
I think I need 140.

4686
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:42,700
140.

4687
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:45,180
Alright, I'll bail you out.

4688
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:47,640
140.

4689
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:49,460
Is this how a monopoly usually rolls at the end?

4690
02:25:49,460 --> 02:25:50,980
Do you guys want a burger or the McNuggets?

4691
02:25:51,860 --> 02:25:52,560
You know what?

4692
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:53,960
I'll give you 145.

4693
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:55,040
Cause I feel generous.

4694
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:56,000
I'll take it.

4695
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:56,320
I'll take it.

4696
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:57,400
She's so generous.

4697
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:01,440
She's literally so fucking generous.

4698
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:03,120
Alright, enjoy your monopoly.

4699
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:04,240
Yay!

4700
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:06,060
Just end stream.

4701
02:26:08,220 --> 02:26:08,880
Alright, Jen.

4702
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:11,320
Just fucking give up, man.

4703
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:13,120
I get my money back.

4704
02:26:13,180 --> 02:26:14,180
So I got it for free.

4705
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:16,500
It's not over until I actually lose.

4706
02:26:16,900 --> 02:26:17,960
Can I go to jail, please?

4707
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:20,040
It's not over until I actually lose.

4708
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:22,280
I actually got the orange for free.

4709
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:23,080
Holy shit.

4710
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:24,220
Can I go to jail, please?

4711
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:26,160
It's not over until I actually lose, chat.

4712
02:26:26,360 --> 02:26:26,840
Watch.

4713
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:27,800
Jail me.

4714
02:26:28,580 --> 02:26:30,460
I've done so many crimes.

4715
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:32,060
I'm a bad person.

4716
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,480
I deserve it.

4717
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:36,160
What is that?

4718
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:37,700
Oh, that's mine.

4719
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,940
That's my water.

4720
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:42,320
Oh, that's not a cup.

4721
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:43,340
It's only 40.

4722
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:45,280
What if I just don't shower?

4723
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:50,860
Wait, if both utilities are owned, rent is 10 times the amount shown on the dice.

4724
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:51,160
Oh!

4725
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:53,260
Not bad, not bad.

4726
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:56,820
What if I just don't shower?

4727
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:57,600
Not bad.

4728
02:26:58,460 --> 02:26:59,620
Doki, Doki, Doki, Doki.

4729
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:01,960
I'm literally on my last effing...

4730
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:02,760
You're not even using...

4731
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:04,220
You need water.

4732
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:04,680
You have $240.

4733
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:06,080
Yeah, you have $240.

4734
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:07,420
You're still alive.

4735
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:11,920
You're still alive.

4736
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:12,280
You're still alive.

4737
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:12,420
You're still alive.

4738
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:14,900
I can hear her, like, text a speech in the background.

4739
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:17,020
Did you hear that?

4740
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:19,140
Did you guys hear that?

4741
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:19,860
Shut up.

4742
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:24,160
You can't get your chat to bail you out, Philly.

4743
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:25,660
Yeah, your chat can't bail you out, man.

4744
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:26,640
Chat, this is so sad.

4745
02:27:26,820 --> 02:27:27,660
Can we get, like, five subs?

4746
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:28,100
Oh my god.

4747
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:31,360
Yeah, five subs at TokiBird on Twitch.

4748
02:27:31,480 --> 02:27:32,900
How am I gonna get reduced to a simp?

4749
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:35,540
I just give money to pay people as I walk around.

4750
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:39,120
I'm a little pay pig!

4751
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:43,380
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

4752
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:44,900
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

4753
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:45,300
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

4754
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:48,160
Can you put that on YouTube next time you need a bailout?

4755
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:49,380
Just oink, oink a little bit?

4756
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:50,620
Yeah, just oink her chat.

4757
02:27:50,940 --> 02:27:51,340
I'm sorry.

4758
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,040
I'm just getting sober.

4759
02:27:53,260 --> 02:27:57,060
You know, I'm gonna go put a hat on.

4760
02:27:57,060 --> 02:27:58,340
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

4761
02:27:58,460 --> 02:27:59,100
Where's Philly?

4762
02:27:59,120 --> 02:27:59,840
Where is she?

4763
02:28:00,300 --> 02:28:00,700
Oink.

4764
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:01,340
There she is.

4765
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:04,260
Okay, what is her closest property right now?

4766
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:05,320
Let's see.

4767
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:11,360
I'm gonna put a house here too.

4768
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:12,820
Let's see.

4769
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:13,640
Put it on boardwalk!

4770
02:28:14,300 --> 02:28:15,520
Yeah, I'll put it on boardwalk.

4771
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:19,020
I'll put it on boardwalk for you.

4772
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:20,420
Chad, that's my final destination.

4773
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,460
I'm gonna go to boardwalk, I'm gonna buy a room, and then I'm gonna effing die.

4774
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:27,340
Are they gonna fine me that six days later?

4775
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:28,240
Make sure you take life insurance.

4776
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:29,380
Okay.

4777
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:31,020
How much does life insurance cost?

4778
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:33,920
Alright, seven.

4779
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:34,740
Oh hey!

4780
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:36,220
Oh my god.

4781
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:37,240
That's mine!

4782
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:39,640
Everything is yours.

4783
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:42,080
Welcome to the hell zone.

4784
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:42,840
Oh my god!

4785
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:43,480
You gotta sell!

4786
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:44,460
You gotta sell!

4787
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:47,340
You gotta sell!

4788
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:49,120
I'm seven hundred now!

4789
02:28:49,140 --> 02:28:49,460
Thank you!

4790
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:50,640
Philly?

4791
02:28:51,860 --> 02:28:52,340
Yes?

4792
02:28:53,140 --> 02:28:54,320
Philly, we can make a deal here.

4793
02:28:54,520 --> 02:28:59,660
Even if she trades her entire life savings, like she won't...

4794
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:01,660
What?

4795
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:03,660
Oh, you're gonna give me one card back.

4796
02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:08,240
Out of the deal, baby.

4797
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:09,620
Out of the deal.

4798
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:10,460
Don't you want your...

4799
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:11,320
Don't insult me.

4800
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:15,920
Yeah, don't you wanna negotiate?

4801
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,120
Wait, you are insulting me.

4802
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:19,000
You're taking more than I...

4803
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,660
I sold that for like seven bucks.

4804
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:23,780
You can have a house, Philly.

4805
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:26,520
I don't think you're gonna put in a negotiate with me.

4806
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:29,200
I'm not a virgin, you're not, so...

4807
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:29,480
Yeah?

4808
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:31,520
How about I say no?

4809
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:34,920
You don't have anything!

4810
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:36,380
You don't own anything, Philly!

4811
02:29:36,460 --> 02:29:36,980
I'm just taking!

4812
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:38,280
Yeah, I know!

4813
02:29:38,380 --> 02:29:42,280
But if I own one property that generates eight dollars and will land on it, it's not gonna get me anywhere.

4814
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,720
Eight dollars is more than zero.

4815
02:29:47,260 --> 02:29:49,120
It's literally more than zero!

4816
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:50,920
I'll let you make a counter offer.

4817
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:51,800
But I'm just done.

4818
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:56,040
How can you counter offer that?

4819
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:57,020
You don't own anything.

4820
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:00,220
No, it's Pippa's turn to counter offer.

4821
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,400
I don't think I know the rules of the game!

4822
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:06,740
I don't think so either!

4823
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:10,480
How do I do this?

4824
02:30:10,580 --> 02:30:10,860
Here?

4825
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:14,480
There.

4826
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:16,960
I'm thinking more like this.

4827
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:19,000
Exactly!

4828
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:20,760
Whoa, Liz!

4829
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:26,020
Wait, how am I so all for 150?

4830
02:30:27,580 --> 02:30:28,460
I refuse.

4831
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:29,800
And then, we're gonna have to do this again.

4832
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:30,100
Whatever.

4833
02:30:31,540 --> 02:30:34,140
Philly, you will regret this.

4834
02:30:34,360 --> 02:30:36,240
Yeah, but my proof is already in the draft.

4835
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:39,660
You've made an enemy!

4836
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:43,040
I made an enemy!

4837
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:43,980
Shut up!

4838
02:30:44,060 --> 02:30:49,860
I have no dollars, I have no property, I have no hoes, my wife led me for Andrew Tate, and my Bugatti got impounded.

4839
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:55,460
I made Beth a tweeter on a street car.

4840
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:58,060
I'm in San Francisco pooping on the floor right now.

4841
02:31:03,220 --> 02:31:04,140
Stop laughing!

4842
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:05,120
Add it to the poop map.

4843
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:05,940
Okay.

4844
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:07,820
Put it on the poop map.

4845
02:31:07,900 --> 02:31:08,600
That's fillians.

4846
02:31:08,740 --> 02:31:10,040
We'll put a little star on it.

4847
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:13,060
It'll be like the Hollywood Walk of Fame except fillians poop.

4848
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:14,860
What?

4849
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:19,600
Oh my god, the board is more free now!

4850
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:21,600
The board is more generous!

4851
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:22,660
You're gonna make it!

4852
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:25,180
Sell your homes, Pippa!

4853
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:26,700
You have to sell!

4854
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:28,700
You don't need the yacht, Pippa!

4855
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:29,640
Sell it!

4856
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:34,280
Just sell until you need $100 and then ask for a fillian for $100.

4857
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:38,520
Pippa, I'll do the deal for $100.

4858
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:44,160
Can you sell her one of her own mortgage properties and then she can't even use it?

4859
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:46,000
That's true!

4860
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:50,200
Sell the blues because she can't even pay back the...

4861
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:55,160
She can't even pay back the mortgage and you sell it!

4862
02:31:55,180 --> 02:31:55,780
Sell the blues!

4863
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,580
She can't even pay back the fucking mortgages!

4864
02:31:57,900 --> 02:31:59,760
She can't have mortgages!

4865
02:32:01,400 --> 02:32:02,580
You're so smart!

4866
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:06,380
My god!

4867
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:07,780
Here, fillian.

4868
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:08,560
All of them.

4869
02:32:09,100 --> 02:32:09,580
What?

4870
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:12,260
All her money.

4871
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:12,960
All her money.

4872
02:32:12,980 --> 02:32:13,580
She'll take it.

4873
02:32:14,980 --> 02:32:16,460
Take all her money.

4874
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:17,400
What?

4875
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:19,040
What is happening?

4876
02:32:19,940 --> 02:32:21,200
Fillian, I'm giving you a monopoly.

4877
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:22,940
Yeah, we just want all your money.

4878
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:23,240
I have a monopoly.

4879
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:24,460
What?

4880
02:32:25,180 --> 02:32:25,440
I have one dollar.

4881
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:27,540
What?

4882
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:30,220
Yeah, this is so cheap, fillian.

4883
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,140
It's so cheap!

4884
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:31,800
What a deal!

4885
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:32,920
It's like a bargain bin deal.

4886
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:33,980
$150.

4887
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:37,800
$150.

4888
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:40,960
Fillian, you're literally gonna get back your monopoly.

4889
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:43,360
Just take away one of the cards.

4890
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:44,700
I said $150.

4891
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,560
How about $170?

4892
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:52,800
$100... $160.

4893
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:53,760
$160?

4894
02:32:55,180 --> 02:32:55,840
That's how you negotiate.

4895
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:57,660
Should I do it?

4896
02:32:57,760 --> 02:32:58,540
Yeah, do it.

4897
02:32:58,920 --> 02:32:59,880
$320 value.

4898
02:32:59,900 --> 02:33:01,120
That's like half the value.

4899
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:02,800
Half off by giving you one free.

4900
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:03,660
All you people.

4901
02:33:04,930 --> 02:33:05,600
There it is, chat.

4902
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:08,060
Now we're back, chat.

4903
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:12,400
He can't even take any money.

4904
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:21,600
You have to pay the bank.

4905
02:33:22,460 --> 02:33:25,540
You have to pay the bank $6 each.

4906
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:27,720
$6 each.

4907
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,180
I don't get it.

4908
02:33:29,400 --> 02:33:31,320
But it's not bad.

4909
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:33,780
Here we go.

4910
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:35,260
I was gonna...

4911
02:33:35,260 --> 02:33:36,760
I just literally... she gave me more money.

4912
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:38,280
That's $60, that's $55.

4913
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:39,880
Wait a second.

4914
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:40,980
Oh wait, no it's not.

4915
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:42,260
Oh no it's not.

4916
02:33:42,540 --> 02:33:43,800
Wait, no, I can sell it.

4917
02:33:43,820 --> 02:33:44,520
No, it's already a bargain.

4918
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:45,260
It's over.

4919
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:49,160
But you got your property back, fillian.

4920
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:49,980
Yeah!

4921
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:51,160
Yay!

4922
02:33:54,460 --> 02:33:56,800
You got your property back!

4923
02:33:58,840 --> 02:33:59,500
Oh my god!

4924
02:33:59,660 --> 02:34:01,100
Oh my god!

4925
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:02,060
Oh my god!

4926
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:02,580
Oh my god!

4927
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:05,620
Goodbye, girl.

4928
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:06,780
What?

4929
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:08,980
Jesus.

4930
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:11,820
Jesus fucking Christ.

4931
02:34:12,850 --> 02:34:15,120
I'll keep you in the game.

4932
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:18,320
Lumi, I'll keep you in the game, Lumi.

4933
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:19,420
Lumi, I'll keep you in the game, Lumi.

4934
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:21,140
Okay, I'll give you the floor.

4935
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:22,000
You're the real Monopoly man.

4936
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:23,500
Fuck you.

4937
02:34:26,180 --> 02:34:27,340
Fuck man.

4938
02:34:28,740 --> 02:34:30,440
I'm fucking over.

4939
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:33,080
I'm fucking over.

4940
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:33,720
I'm fucking over.

4941
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:34,820
You need... you need...

4942
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:37,240
I need a fella.

4943
02:34:37,640 --> 02:34:38,760
I'll kick you in.

4944
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:39,560
Don't worry.

4945
02:34:39,980 --> 02:34:41,580
Jesus Christ.

4946
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:43,740
Oh my god.

4947
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:47,360
If Doki maybe lands on Pippa's, maybe it'll work.

4948
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:49,000
Chad, this is how it's accurate.

4949
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:49,820
Thank you.

4950
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:51,760
Here we go.

4951
02:34:51,860 --> 02:34:52,140
Don't worry.

4952
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:52,680
I got you.

4953
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:54,900
Got you.

4954
02:34:57,120 --> 02:34:57,580
69.

4955
02:34:58,520 --> 02:34:58,980
69.

4956
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:00,420
69.

4957
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:00,700
Nice.

4958
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:01,940
Nice.

4959
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:04,840
Here you go.

4960
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:08,520
I'm fucking sick of this.

4961
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:08,960
I'm gonna cry.

4962
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,480
I own a Monopoly.

4963
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:10,940
Oh my god.

4964
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:11,740
Oh my god.

4965
02:35:11,780 --> 02:35:12,160
Here you go.

4966
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:13,540
Alright.

4967
02:35:13,660 --> 02:35:14,120
You know what?

4968
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:15,080
I will...

4969
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:16,300
I'll repay this mortgage.

4970
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:18,000
Jesus, look at her board.

4971
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:20,180
She's got like everything.

4972
02:35:23,140 --> 02:35:24,100
Holy shit.

4973
02:35:24,340 --> 02:35:26,000
Were you looking for the one one...

4974
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:26,620
You living by the thread with one dollar.

4975
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:27,680
Watch me lose the Pippa now.

4976
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:29,520
Watch now, watch now, watch now.

4977
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:32,320
Please put me in jail.

4978
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:33,280
Please put me in jail.

4979
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:33,640
Yes.

4980
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:34,240
Yes.

4981
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:34,560
Yes.

4982
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:37,140
You lose the $1.

4983
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:38,120
Yeah.

4984
02:35:39,160 --> 02:35:39,640
Mina.

4985
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:45,540
Does anyone let me sexually assault them?

4986
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:47,580
I mean if you get two...If you get two.

4987
02:35:47,660 --> 02:35:48,220
You'll be fine.

4988
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:49,040
If you get two.

4989
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:49,700
Please.

4990
02:35:49,700 --> 02:35:49,840
Please.

4991
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:50,820
This section is so awesome.

4992
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:54,640
This is over.

4993
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:56,160
No, you're not.

4994
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:57,080
You're still fine.

4995
02:35:57,260 --> 02:35:57,980
You're still fine.

4996
02:35:58,100 --> 02:35:59,000
Yeah, community chest.

4997
02:36:00,220 --> 02:36:00,700
Yeah!

4998
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:03,500
Yeah, community chest.

4999
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:06,720
Wow,

5000
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:11,860
American healthcare is what's gonna get me in, huh?

5001
02:36:13,460 --> 02:36:14,260
American healthcare.

5002
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:15,420
That's what does me in.

5003
02:36:18,460 --> 02:36:20,120
I think you just gotta declare bankruptcy.

5004
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:22,020
Or you can sell your... you can...

5005
02:36:22,020 --> 02:36:23,380
Well, you already mortgaged it.

5006
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:24,460
So I can bail you out.

5007
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:25,200
You give me all your blues.

5008
02:36:27,260 --> 02:36:30,260
I paid $150 for them.

5009
02:36:30,460 --> 02:36:30,820
60.

5010
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:33,560
I can bail you out if you give me all your blues.

5011
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:36,360
Or declare bankruptcy now.

5012
02:36:37,140 --> 02:36:38,900
If I declare bankruptcy, do I lose?

5013
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:39,540
Yes.

5014
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:40,980
You'll be the first one to lose.

5015
02:36:43,880 --> 02:36:45,400
You're telling me the American healthcare is what's gonna get me in.

5016
02:36:45,420 --> 02:36:46,360
American healthcare is what's gonna get me in.

5017
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:47,960
Jokey.

5018
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:50,040
I came into Canada to try the mage system instead.

5019
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:51,520
I'm offering you a bailout.

5020
02:36:52,380 --> 02:36:54,460
I'm literally giving you a great deal.

5021
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:56,620
Yo, Pippa, you want the $45?

5022
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:58,660
She can't afford to sell you out.

5023
02:36:58,700 --> 02:36:59,620
Well, I don't have nothing.

5024
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:01,460
She can't afford it.

5025
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:02,420
You have $41.

5026
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:03,440
You have $41.

5027
02:37:04,100 --> 02:37:04,500
Yeah?

5028
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:06,740
So, trade me for $25.

5029
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:08,700
Yeah, what do I get?

5030
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:10,720
And you can take the blue property.

5031
02:37:12,340 --> 02:37:13,960
I don't want the blue property.

5032
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:18,100
I have to pay the mortgage.

5033
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:26,980
It's not as funny as you think it is.

5034
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:34,520
Oh my god.

5035
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:36,480
I want all three.

5036
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:38,620
I want all three.

5037
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:39,820
It's no deal.

5038
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,100
We'll just lose the game.

5039
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:42,360
You know what?

5040
02:37:43,020 --> 02:37:43,740
Frick you!

5041
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:45,860
We'll lose the game.

5042
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:47,520
No deal.

5043
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:49,460
No deal.

5044
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:51,140
Chill, chill, chill.

5045
02:37:51,400 --> 02:37:51,940
Chill.

5046
02:37:51,940 --> 02:37:52,880
Chill, chill, chill.

5047
02:37:54,460 --> 02:37:55,260
Okay, okay.

5048
02:37:56,440 --> 02:37:57,620
Give me all of it.

5049
02:37:58,700 --> 02:37:59,100
Okay.

5050
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:01,540
Switching one right.

5051
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:05,660
How do I... what am I doing?

5052
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,740
Are you okay?

5053
02:38:07,940 --> 02:38:08,460
Out of my way.

5054
02:38:09,700 --> 02:38:12,380
Oh no, her mouse doesn't work all of a sudden.

5055
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:15,660
Oh wow, the moment you had to give me all of it.

5056
02:38:15,660 --> 02:38:16,020
There we go.

5057
02:38:17,820 --> 02:38:20,280
Just so you know, this is worth more than you are.

5058
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:26,160
Someone's just fucking...

5059
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,340
Someone's salty that they're losing in Monopoly.

5060
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,340
That's so savage.

5061
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:34,940
Oh, the pain.

5062
02:38:34,980 --> 02:38:37,920
You can pay for your health insurance now.

5063
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:38,560
Is that great?

5064
02:38:39,100 --> 02:38:41,000
This will pay off all these mortgages.

5065
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:42,980
Yeah.

5066
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,180
Now you just have to pay for the healthcare.

5067
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:47,940
Chat, I'm literally one.

5068
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:50,080
It's okay, you're so close to the end.

5069
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:51,300
Chat, I'm literally one.

5070
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:53,220
Yeah, just grab your toaster and you're done.

5071
02:38:53,820 --> 02:38:54,540
Yeah, I'm literally one.

5072
02:38:55,180 --> 02:38:56,180
And your turn.

5073
02:38:56,260 --> 02:38:57,360
It's my turn now.

5074
02:38:57,420 --> 02:38:57,960
Come on, Chat.

5075
02:38:58,100 --> 02:38:58,460
Yay.

5076
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:04,660
I'm gonna land on like Pippa Square, I feel like.

5077
02:39:04,760 --> 02:39:05,860
Oh, unless...

5078
02:39:07,180 --> 02:39:08,820
This luck is insane.

5079
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:10,420
Whoa, Chess!

5080
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:11,740
This luck is literally insane.

5081
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:13,300
Hello, take a trip.

5082
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:16,980
I get to go to my own railroad?

5083
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:18,680
What the fuck?

5084
02:39:20,940 --> 02:39:21,580
Let's go.

5085
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:23,800
I'm like a protagonist in a history book.

5086
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:24,660
So I'm like a protagonist in a history book.

5087
02:39:24,660 --> 02:39:26,120
I'm just happy to be in jail, man.

5088
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:28,140
All I ever wanted was to be in jail.

5089
02:39:28,420 --> 02:39:29,440
Wait, is that...

5090
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:30,120
That's...

5091
02:39:30,120 --> 02:39:30,500
Oh!

5092
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:30,900
Oh!

5093
02:39:31,300 --> 02:39:31,760
Oh!

5094
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:33,940
Chat, we're so lucky!

5095
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:37,060
You own this.

5096
02:39:37,780 --> 02:39:38,820
You're so safe.

5097
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:40,860
I gotta roll again, though.

5098
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:42,620
Yeah, you gotta roll again.

5099
02:39:43,960 --> 02:39:44,620
Where's that?

5100
02:39:44,820 --> 02:39:45,000
Oh, shit.

5101
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:45,740
What is that?

5102
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:46,780
I don't know, I'm scared.

5103
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:47,820
Seven?

5104
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:49,440
No one has any money!

5105
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:51,100
Who is that?

5106
02:39:51,940 --> 02:39:52,880
Oh, you got chance!

5107
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:53,660
Oh, you're safe!

5108
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:54,360
You're safe!

5109
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:56,340
Thread the needle!

5110
02:39:56,740 --> 02:39:57,840
You threaded the needle!

5111
02:39:57,920 --> 02:39:59,000
Go back three spaces!

5112
02:39:59,380 --> 02:40:00,580
Oh, I can't!

5113
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:01,040
You forgot!

5114
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:03,640
Now you can reach us!

5115
02:40:04,060 --> 02:40:05,140
There's nothing I could've done.

5116
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:06,200
Come on, come on, come on!

5117
02:40:07,560 --> 02:40:08,960
And you get money!

5118
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:10,740
At least I'm not Fillion.

5119
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:11,580
She's still in this.

5120
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:12,560
She's still in this.

5121
02:40:12,740 --> 02:40:14,520
I was in jail for one turn, dude.

5122
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:15,380
I was in jail for one turn.

5123
02:40:15,380 --> 02:40:15,380
Alright, alright, alright.

5124
02:40:15,380 --> 02:40:15,520
Roll the fucking dice.

5125
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:15,940
Let's go.

5126
02:40:15,940 --> 02:40:18,080
I think Fillion's coping right now.

5127
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:18,580
She's...

5128
02:40:20,060 --> 02:40:21,500
Oh, you got out!

5129
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:25,100
One time you don't want to get out.

5130
02:40:25,380 --> 02:40:27,840
And that's the property you sold me.

5131
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:31,000
And that's the property you sold me.

5132
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:31,860
I'll bail you out!

5133
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:32,720
I'll bail you out!

5134
02:40:32,780 --> 02:40:32,880
I'll bail you out!

5135
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:33,200
Don't worry.

5136
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:34,860
I won't make you the last...

5137
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:38,460
What am I even doing anymore, dude?

5138
02:40:39,100 --> 02:40:40,780
What am I even doing anymore?

5139
02:40:41,260 --> 02:40:42,680
What am I even doing anymore?

5140
02:40:42,680 --> 02:40:44,560
I'll give you my last fucking dollar.

5141
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:45,020
I'll give you my last fucking dollar.

5142
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:47,860
I'll give you my last fucking dollar.

5143
02:40:47,860 --> 02:40:48,660
It's no problem.

5144
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:50,440
Bill, you had no problem, bro.

5145
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:53,260
I'm just letting you go.

5146
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:54,500
How much do you need?

5147
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:56,760
I think I need just thirty-five.

5148
02:40:56,900 --> 02:40:57,300
Thirty-five.

5149
02:40:57,300 --> 02:40:59,200
I'm just a starving Fillion, dude.

5150
02:41:00,040 --> 02:41:01,660
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

5151
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:02,720
I'm about to die.

5152
02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:02,840
I'm so glad.

5153
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:04,500
I'm about to die.

5154
02:41:04,700 --> 02:41:04,940
Deal!

5155
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:10,220
Lumi, Lumi, can you trade me a dollar?

5156
02:41:10,660 --> 02:41:12,400
Please, I just want to buy a Big Mac.

5157
02:41:14,620 --> 02:41:15,920
Please, I just want to buy a Big Mac.

5158
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:19,840
I'll be the bail out of the government and you're the bail out of the government.

5159
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:21,580
You can get the whole club for one dollar.

5160
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:22,940
Mom, I was supposed to be safe in jail.

5161
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:24,960
Fuck my life.

5162
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:27,000
You and your zero dollars.

5163
02:41:28,100 --> 02:41:28,120
No!

5164
02:41:29,060 --> 02:41:31,200
Okay, so what's safe?

5165
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:31,820
What?

5166
02:41:32,220 --> 02:41:33,820
For you, nothing.

5167
02:41:34,060 --> 02:41:35,020
Nothing is safe.

5168
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:38,360
I'll leave a six or an eight.

5169
02:41:39,020 --> 02:41:39,860
What did I say?

5170
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:41,100
Just chat.

5171
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:42,900
Roll the dice, Fillion.

5172
02:41:43,220 --> 02:41:44,880
Roll the fucking dice.

5173
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:46,740
Right.

5174
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:47,960
Heart of the dice.

5175
02:41:48,220 --> 02:41:49,300
Heart of the dice, baby.

5176
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:50,800
I believe in you.

5177
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:55,100
Oh, not boardwalk.

5178
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:56,480
That's a good number, right?

5179
02:41:57,140 --> 02:41:58,960
Yeah, you just did the same.

5180
02:41:59,180 --> 02:41:59,480
Let's go!

5181
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:03,200
Oh my God.

5182
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:05,380
She's safe for another turn.

5183
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:13,120
She's safe again.

5184
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:14,480
Safe for now.

5185
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,300
Look at this property.

5186
02:42:17,960 --> 02:42:18,060
My heart.

5187
02:42:20,560 --> 02:42:22,240
Which is like the closest?

5188
02:42:22,420 --> 02:42:23,580
Okay, Fillion is close to here.

5189
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:24,900
I'm buying a water ticket.

5190
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:27,160
Oh my God.

5191
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:29,220
You're gonna build a house on my property.

5192
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:30,340
That's my property.

5193
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:31,920
Your property?

5194
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:38,180
You build a whole city and you have more fans there than I do.

5195
02:42:39,180 --> 02:42:40,920
I'm getting more like Drake vs.

5196
02:42:41,020 --> 02:42:41,440
Kendrick.

5197
02:42:44,420 --> 02:42:45,380
Good luck.

5198
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:46,940
You don't land there.

5199
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:48,760
Listen, listen, listen.

5200
02:42:48,940 --> 02:42:50,360
I know how this junk works, okay?

5201
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:51,680
I literally had a house there.

5202
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:53,700
If you land on that, I will owe you like $14.

5203
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:54,460
I don't give a frick.

5204
02:42:56,120 --> 02:42:56,520
Pippa!

5205
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:02,360
Pippa, I'll bail you out.

5206
02:43:02,920 --> 02:43:04,920
Or you can sell your mortgage your property.

5207
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:06,800
Yeah, mortgage or bail.

5208
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:09,080
It's time to fuck off.

5209
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:10,240
Mortgage or bail.

5210
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:11,860
I'll give you an IOU.

5211
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:13,760
Okay, I'll take it.

5212
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:14,400
I'll take it.

5213
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:19,660
Pippa, please, do the last one in.

5214
02:43:20,320 --> 02:43:21,800
Pippa, I have $200.

5215
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:23,900
I can't die before Fillion.

5216
02:43:24,500 --> 02:43:25,720
Pippa, come to me.

5217
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:26,580
I have $200.

5218
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:29,060
I have $200.

5219
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:31,000
Yeah, and nothing to offer.

5220
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:32,900
I have a lot of assets.

5221
02:43:33,300 --> 02:43:33,820
Yeah.

5222
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,300
You have nothing to offer.

5223
02:43:38,140 --> 02:43:39,560
This is action 3v1.

5224
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:40,620
This is action 3v1.

5225
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,960
I'm just bailing people out.

5226
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:45,160
You know what, brother?

5227
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:46,000
I'm not being torturous.

5228
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:48,900
I'm bailing people out.

5229
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:50,560
I'm being generous.

5230
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:52,480
You're going to bail me out?

5231
02:43:52,600 --> 02:43:53,640
You built a house on Blue.

5232
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:57,140
I gave you the option to get bailed out.

5233
02:43:57,180 --> 02:43:58,080
You didn't take it.

5234
02:43:58,120 --> 02:43:59,280
I gave you that option.

5235
02:43:59,480 --> 02:44:02,920
I gave you that option.

5236
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:05,000
I will get out of your house.

5237
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:07,540
Specifically because I'm going to buy it.

5238
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:09,880
I'm not going to bail you out.

5239
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:10,980
I'm going to bail you out.

5240
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:12,440
You're not being liar.

5241
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:16,020
You rejected it.

5242
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:17,380
I'm in the death zone.

5243
02:44:17,940 --> 02:44:19,320
I'm becoming an atheist.

5244
02:44:20,340 --> 02:44:21,980
I'm in the death zone.

5245
02:44:22,460 --> 02:44:23,320
You're fine.

5246
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:24,760
Please, please, please.

5247
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:28,220
You're a Fortnite 2018 great pistol.

5248
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:28,620
Chance, chance, chance.

5249
02:44:30,220 --> 02:44:31,660
If unowned...

5250
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:33,940
No dice and pay over.

5251
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:35,000
Ten times?

5252
02:44:35,660 --> 02:44:36,420
Yeah, it's me.

5253
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:38,220
Geez.

5254
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:40,820
Goodbye, cool world.

5255
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:43,200
Hey, Nani.

5256
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:45,280
Yeah, I can bail you out.

5257
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:45,780
Don't worry.

5258
02:44:46,020 --> 02:44:47,120
I can bail you out.

5259
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:49,720
Just until Fillion dies.

5260
02:44:49,940 --> 02:44:50,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5261
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:51,220
Of course.

5262
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:53,360
Just all I need to live.

5263
02:44:53,360 --> 02:44:54,700
All I need to live.

5264
02:44:55,060 --> 02:44:57,160
Just gotta live until Fillion dies.

5265
02:44:57,320 --> 02:44:57,320
No, chat.

5266
02:44:57,320 --> 02:44:57,860
These clubs are real.

5267
02:44:59,580 --> 02:45:00,960
How much do you need?

5268
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:03,480
I think I need 90.

5269
02:45:03,740 --> 02:45:04,220
90?

5270
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:04,880
Okay, don't worry.

5271
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:05,480
I've got you.

5272
02:45:06,320 --> 02:45:07,860
We're independent VTubers.

5273
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:09,700
Don't let these corpos blossom around.

5274
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:11,720
This is money for you, DoseBank.

5275
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:12,720
Stand up for yourself.

5276
02:45:12,980 --> 02:45:13,460
All for you.

5277
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:16,280
Come on.

5278
02:45:16,420 --> 02:45:17,380
You want my wallet?

5279
02:45:18,260 --> 02:45:19,840
Dollars are an endangered species.

5280
02:45:20,220 --> 02:45:21,640
A wallet for DoseBank keeps the organ collectors out there.

5281
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:21,960
Exactly.

5282
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:22,860
Don't worry.

5283
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:25,160
I got you guys.

5284
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:26,900
Alright, thank you, thank you.

5285
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:29,100
Alright, so not dead.

5286
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:29,840
Shit!

5287
02:45:31,420 --> 02:45:32,780
Oh my god.

5288
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:34,360
Let me go back to jail, please.

5289
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:35,040
This is unbelievable.

5290
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:36,920
Let me go back to jail, please.

5291
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:37,580
This is unbelievable.

5292
02:45:37,780 --> 02:45:39,260
Let me end it all.

5293
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:42,300
Doki, independent VTubers strong together.

5294
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:44,960
No, you're kind of mythic.

5295
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:45,920
Boardwalk!

5296
02:45:48,060 --> 02:45:49,560
Oh, it might actually be, no?

5297
02:45:49,800 --> 02:45:51,240
Oh shit, she's a devil.

5298
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:52,420
She's just missing it.

5299
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:53,700
She avoids it.

5300
02:45:55,260 --> 02:45:56,900
She avoids it yet again.

5301
02:45:57,640 --> 02:45:59,980
So I'm gonna go to jail for after the walk you up.

5302
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:01,080
Okay, you know what?

5303
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,840
I'm gonna go up to the security guard and twerk them.

5304
02:46:03,140 --> 02:46:04,460
I'll be a devil and a racist.

5305
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:05,940
That's my plan of action.

5306
02:46:06,180 --> 02:46:09,000
She gets to avoid jail yet again.

5307
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:11,020
She's so fucked up.

5308
02:46:11,380 --> 02:46:13,560
Oh, is that Pippa's?

5309
02:46:13,820 --> 02:46:14,460
No, that's mine.

5310
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:15,240
Oh, thank god, that's mine.

5311
02:46:15,780 --> 02:46:16,460
You own everything, Doki.

5312
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,360
Oh yeah, I do.

5313
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:20,140
You own the entire side of the board.

5314
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:22,620
Where is she going?

5315
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:24,840
Okay, I'm gonna put a house here.

5316
02:46:25,100 --> 02:46:25,420
What are you doing?

5317
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:26,480
What are you doing?

5318
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:29,260
Actually, I'm gonna put a house here.

5319
02:46:29,460 --> 02:46:30,620
She might land on here more often.

5320
02:46:30,620 --> 02:46:31,900
Am I in the Middle East?

5321
02:46:31,980 --> 02:46:33,260
Every step is a landmine.

5322
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:33,680
This is ridiculous.

5323
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:35,240
I'm gonna put it here.

5324
02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:38,800
And then I'm gonna put one here as well.

5325
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:40,820
And then here as well.

5326
02:46:40,840 --> 02:46:41,940
Good luck, good luck, Fillion.

5327
02:46:42,260 --> 02:46:43,040
Good luck.

5328
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:44,240
Good luck.

5329
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:47,960
I believe in you, Fillion.

5330
02:46:48,380 --> 02:46:48,860
Good luck, Fillion.

5331
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:50,520
Fillion, I believe in you.

5332
02:46:51,740 --> 02:46:52,680
It's not my turn.

5333
02:46:58,220 --> 02:46:59,600
Hey, you're fine.

5334
02:47:00,340 --> 02:47:00,900
Thank you.

5335
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:01,540
Community chest.

5336
02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:04,240
Look at that, she's alive.

5337
02:47:05,320 --> 02:47:05,980
Run out.

5338
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:07,740
Hey!

5339
02:47:08,880 --> 02:47:10,520
You got another bailout.

5340
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:12,160
Look at you.

5341
02:47:13,180 --> 02:47:13,920
Making it.

5342
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:15,380
Please let me go to jail.

5343
02:47:16,700 --> 02:47:18,760
Please, please, Snake Eyes, Snake Eyes, Snake Eyes.

5344
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:19,540
Come on, Snake Eyes.

5345
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:23,020
Oh, you get a community chest.

5346
02:47:23,800 --> 02:47:24,460
Okay, please let me live.

5347
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:25,220
Please let me live.

5348
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:26,680
Yes!

5349
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:29,500
Holy shit.

5350
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:33,040
It's a 4v1.

5351
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:33,880
It's a 4v1.

5352
02:47:35,100 --> 02:47:36,540
Good luck, Fillion.

5353
02:47:36,580 --> 02:47:38,220
I own this entire side.

5354
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:39,220
So good luck.

5355
02:47:40,440 --> 02:47:42,400
I actually got dragged into the military.

5356
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:43,420
So I actually have to go.

5357
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:46,700
Oh, so you're declaring bankruptcy?

5358
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:48,060
You're gonna declare bankruptcy?

5359
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:50,060
Well, you have to leave.

5360
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:50,960
If you have to leave.

5361
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:54,140
See?

5362
02:47:54,140 --> 02:47:54,600
Easy.

5363
02:47:55,620 --> 02:47:57,900
Oh, hey, that's the one place I just bought the house.

5364
02:47:57,980 --> 02:47:59,480
Oh, hey, that's the one place I just bought the house.

5365
02:47:59,480 --> 02:48:00,880
I literally just got bought the house.

5366
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:01,920
That's crazy.

5367
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:02,700
Oh, it's not so bad.

5368
02:48:02,740 --> 02:48:03,500
It's not so bad.

5369
02:48:03,580 --> 02:48:04,600
I just put one house there.

5370
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:05,160
Look at that.

5371
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:08,240
It's like a rat and it cannot be that bad.

5372
02:48:08,660 --> 02:48:11,920
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

5373
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:13,580
It's not that bad, see?

5374
02:48:14,100 --> 02:48:14,220
Hmm.

5375
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:16,960
She's so happy.

5376
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:19,780
Fillion, you're lying.

5377
02:48:19,960 --> 02:48:20,960
Hand an intern for me.

5378
02:48:21,320 --> 02:48:22,240
Okay, sure.

5379
02:48:23,360 --> 02:48:24,560
She's fucking disabled.

5380
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:25,920
You're taking everything from me.

5381
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:26,900
Might as well take my effing turn.

5382
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:27,940
Oh, definitely.

5383
02:48:28,680 --> 02:48:29,360
Let's go.

5384
02:48:29,480 --> 02:48:30,900
Might as well take my effing organs.

5385
02:48:31,500 --> 02:48:32,020
Yay!

5386
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:35,000
And then I can roll again.

5387
02:48:35,140 --> 02:48:35,840
Let's go.

5388
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:38,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5389
02:48:38,680 --> 02:48:40,220
The luck on this girl is insane.

5390
02:48:40,220 --> 02:48:41,920
I think this game would have ended...

5391
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:45,020
Is that mine or yours?

5392
02:48:45,280 --> 02:48:46,860
Oh, I get to go to jail?

5393
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:50,640
Oh, that's so unfortunate, guys.

5394
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:51,280
Oh my god.

5395
02:48:51,400 --> 02:48:53,640
I get to go to jail.

5396
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:55,060
She deserves that.

5397
02:48:55,080 --> 02:48:56,040
She's a good person.

5398
02:48:56,140 --> 02:48:56,740
Let her out.

5399
02:48:56,800 --> 02:48:57,440
Oh my god.

5400
02:48:58,380 --> 02:49:00,580
Can we get a Twitter hashtag?

5401
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:02,060
Oh my god.

5402
02:49:02,380 --> 02:49:05,040
Her reputation is a bit...

5403
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:06,520
No, it's fine.

5404
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:07,660
I'm fine with being...

5405
02:49:07,660 --> 02:49:08,000
It's okay.

5406
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:09,960
You're a criminal.

5407
02:49:10,380 --> 02:49:12,420
She's got delicate skin and stuff.

5408
02:49:12,660 --> 02:49:13,120
Yeah, yeah.

5409
02:49:13,160 --> 02:49:14,200
I got framed, guys.

5410
02:49:14,300 --> 02:49:14,720
It's okay.

5411
02:49:14,780 --> 02:49:15,460
I got framed.

5412
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:16,860
Look, I haven't...

5413
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:22,420
It was so unfortunate to get framed like that.

5414
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:22,780
Free bird!

5415
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:26,760
How did she owe $20 but I owe $70?

5416
02:49:26,900 --> 02:49:29,660
Because I have a house on that property, Fillion.

5417
02:49:30,220 --> 02:49:31,320
That's so crazy.

5418
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:32,160
How did that happen?

5419
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:33,220
That's so crazy.

5420
02:49:33,240 --> 02:49:34,820
Fillion, if you've been a nicer person...

5421
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:36,800
Yeah, you've been a nicer person in the beginning of the game.

5422
02:49:36,900 --> 02:49:37,380
Am I done?

5423
02:49:37,900 --> 02:49:39,000
Oh my god.

5424
02:49:39,500 --> 02:49:40,380
It's not over yet.

5425
02:49:40,500 --> 02:49:41,260
I'll take that.

5426
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:41,740
I don't care.

5427
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:43,060
It's not Boardwalk.

5428
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:44,920
It's not Boardwalk.

5429
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:45,380
I'm free.

5430
02:49:46,240 --> 02:49:47,060
Alright, Fillion.

5431
02:49:47,060 --> 02:49:47,500
Good luck.

5432
02:49:49,460 --> 02:49:50,180
Good luck.

5433
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:51,880
I own half of that side as well.

5434
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:53,620
I got this, Fillion.

5435
02:49:53,620 --> 02:49:53,620
I'm getting death spell.

5436
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:56,040
That's death row, right?

5437
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:56,840
That's it.

5438
02:49:57,580 --> 02:49:58,120
Eight!

5439
02:49:58,540 --> 02:49:59,480
Oh, eight.

5440
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:02,940
How many houses is that?

5441
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:04,180
That's like more than one.

5442
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:05,240
Oh.

5443
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:09,060
Fillion, I think it's time.

5444
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:10,520
You don't have anything left.

5445
02:50:11,440 --> 02:50:12,040
Fillion?

5446
02:50:12,060 --> 02:50:15,620
Wait, you actually don't have anything?

5447
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:16,460
Fillion.

5448
02:50:16,460 --> 02:50:18,140
I'm not bailing you out.

5449
02:50:21,760 --> 02:50:23,520
There's no bail out here.

5450
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:24,380
Fillion.

5451
02:50:25,300 --> 02:50:25,920
Fillion.

5452
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:27,760
What?

5453
02:50:29,060 --> 02:50:30,820
It's better on the other side.

5454
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:31,880
Check this board.

5455
02:50:32,740 --> 02:50:34,500
Go into the light.

5456
02:50:35,320 --> 02:50:37,200
Just accept it, Fillion.

5457
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:39,860
Just end this already.

5458
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:42,260
The rope store is on that street.

5459
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:43,520
Just end it.

5460
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:44,880
I said check this board.

5461
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:48,840
Just end it.

5462
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:50,300
Check this board.

5463
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:53,220
I'll fucking do it.

5464
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:55,740
I'll fucking do it.

5465
02:50:55,740 --> 02:50:55,840
I'll fucking do it.

5466
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:56,760
This is Pippa's choice.

5467
02:50:56,840 --> 02:51:02,160
Either we make Fillion lose first now...

5468
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:02,480
Either we make Fillion lose first now...

5469
02:51:03,460 --> 02:51:04,500
or Kira.

5470
02:51:06,320 --> 02:51:07,640
Fillion, I'll bail you out.

5471
02:51:08,060 --> 02:51:09,180
But you have to give me something.

5472
02:51:09,500 --> 02:51:10,640
What does she have?

5473
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:12,700
Not much.

5474
02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:15,180
Let's see.

5475
02:51:16,760 --> 02:51:18,380
I'm gonna start offering stuff, actually.

5476
02:51:18,500 --> 02:51:19,700
Okay, I'll tell you a joke.

5477
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:21,900
No, I don't want a joke.

5478
02:51:21,960 --> 02:51:22,380
Your jokes are bad.

5479
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:23,540
What does it mean, you want a brick wall?

5480
02:51:24,200 --> 02:51:24,560
Nope.

5481
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:24,920
Nope.

5482
02:51:25,060 --> 02:51:26,140
A brick gets laid first.

5483
02:51:26,320 --> 02:51:26,740
Not laughing.

5484
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:28,400
Not funny.

5485
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:32,000
Zoomer humor doesn't work on me.

5486
02:51:32,060 --> 02:51:32,400
Next.

5487
02:51:33,020 --> 02:51:33,380
Okay.

5488
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:41,640
This game would be ended like an hour ago.

5489
02:51:41,860 --> 02:51:42,500
Not gonna lie.

5490
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:44,280
If I didn't do all those bail outs.

5491
02:51:45,100 --> 02:51:45,460
True.

5492
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:49,320
All I'm saying is that we could end this game earlier.

5493
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:51,840
I'm the only reason why it's going so slow.

5494
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:51,840
You guys are so dumb.

5495
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:53,120
I'm doing the tweet.

5496
02:51:53,560 --> 02:51:54,440
I'm doing the tweet.

5497
02:51:55,420 --> 02:51:57,880
Alright, you're out of the game, Fillion.

5498
02:51:58,600 --> 02:51:59,080
Fine.

5499
02:51:59,460 --> 02:52:00,980
What else am I gonna do?

5500
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:02,220
What else am I gonna do?

5501
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:05,720
Fillion, make the tweet your YouTube banner.

5502
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:07,240
I'll bail you out.

5503
02:52:07,660 --> 02:52:08,500
I'm doing this tweet.

5504
02:52:09,500 --> 02:52:11,280
Make it your YouTube banner.

5505
02:52:11,400 --> 02:52:13,120
I don't know how to do that, Fillion.

5506
02:52:13,480 --> 02:52:14,880
You can't lie.

5507
02:52:15,240 --> 02:52:17,080
You damn well know.

5508
02:52:17,380 --> 02:52:18,620
I don't know how.

5509
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:19,920
You're a liar.

5510
02:52:20,400 --> 02:52:21,880
I don't know how.

5511
02:52:23,300 --> 02:52:25,140
Okay, then you make a YouTube video.

5512
02:52:25,440 --> 02:52:26,820
Recording yourself reading the tweet.

5513
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:28,200
What am I effing...

5514
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:29,800
Make it a short too.

5515
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,640
Make it a short because she has more viewers.

5516
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:33,740
I'm being sponsored.

5517
02:52:34,220 --> 02:52:34,660
Okay.

5518
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:38,060
I'm doing this joke.

5519
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:40,580
The most engagement is her short.

5520
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:44,040
This will be our biggest short ever.

5521
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:45,660
We'll make three dollars on it.

5522
02:52:47,360 --> 02:52:48,080
Too late.

5523
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:48,940
I made a decision.

5524
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:50,160
Alright.

5525
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:52,760
Time to bankrupt.

5526
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:54,400
Press the button, Fillion.

5527
02:52:56,340 --> 02:52:57,660
Any last offers?

5528
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:58,600
No.

5529
02:52:59,480 --> 02:53:02,660
If Lumi even has an offer, she can't afford your bail.

5530
02:53:02,660 --> 02:53:03,720
I can't even fucking help you, man.

5531
02:53:04,380 --> 02:53:06,580
The only people who can afford it is me and Pippa.

5532
02:53:07,840 --> 02:53:08,320
Alright.

5533
02:53:08,860 --> 02:53:09,860
You burned the bridges.

5534
02:53:10,180 --> 02:53:11,400
Yeah, you burned all your bridges, Fillion.

5535
02:53:11,880 --> 02:53:13,500
I knew I shouldn't have been PewDiePie.

5536
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:15,000
What?

5537
02:53:18,160 --> 02:53:20,880
Please strike a cat girl while she's down.

5538
02:53:21,820 --> 02:53:23,060
It's for an honor, your honor.

5539
02:53:23,260 --> 02:53:24,640
I don't know what I'm saying.

5540
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:27,960
So I just hit the button and it's over?

5541
02:53:28,100 --> 02:53:28,500
Yeah, it's over.

5542
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:31,620
Unless you want to make that short.

5543
02:53:31,860 --> 02:53:33,500
Are you sure you want to make that short?

5544
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:34,160
Yes, come on.

5545
02:53:37,380 --> 02:53:39,180
She already deleted the tweet anyway.

5546
02:53:39,460 --> 02:53:39,860
True.

5547
02:53:41,580 --> 02:53:42,140
It's over.

5548
02:53:42,660 --> 02:53:44,140
You're so close to freedom.

5549
02:53:45,940 --> 02:53:47,280
I got pretty shot.

5550
02:53:48,080 --> 02:53:49,600
And I get to keep that money.

5551
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:51,200
Oh shit.

5552
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:54,320
You took my life for $130 from me.

5553
02:53:54,540 --> 02:53:55,740
Let's roll that die.

5554
02:53:55,900 --> 02:53:57,460
She just robbed your corpse, Fillion.

5555
02:53:57,540 --> 02:53:58,500
How do you feel about that?

5556
02:53:58,920 --> 02:53:59,440
It was funny.

5557
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:01,600
Finally, the game can end.

5558
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:09,200
Chat, what's the point?

5559
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:11,520
Chat, what's the point?

5560
02:54:13,900 --> 02:54:15,300
What's even the point of it all?

5561
02:54:15,300 --> 02:54:16,600
You get to draw cards.

5562
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:21,200
I haven't died in a factory on the cold floor.

5563
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:23,220
You didn't have to.

5564
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:24,000
You made your choice.

5565
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:25,040
She didn't even have teeth.

5566
02:54:25,260 --> 02:54:29,740
You guys would not have made a YouTube short.

5567
02:54:31,380 --> 02:54:32,180
That's on you.

5568
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:33,340
I would have made the short.

5569
02:54:33,480 --> 02:54:34,180
I would have made it.

5570
02:54:35,020 --> 02:54:36,040
I'm not doing dignity.

5571
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:36,640
It's fine.

5572
02:54:36,740 --> 02:54:38,480
Yeah, we'll see when you lose two if you're going to make it.

5573
02:54:38,620 --> 02:54:39,900
Alright, I'll pay the $30.

5574
02:54:40,640 --> 02:54:41,560
That is sturdy.

5575
02:54:42,360 --> 02:54:44,760
Chat, this is why it's hard to make friends on YouTube.

5576
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:45,120
You're welcome.

5577
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:46,340
I'm happy to help a friend of me.

5578
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:48,680
Let's go see your male bonds.

5579
02:54:50,240 --> 02:54:51,300
Oh, unbelievable.

5580
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:52,820
Not double as unlucky.

5581
02:54:53,060 --> 02:54:55,260
I guess I'll stay in jail a little longer.

5582
02:54:55,640 --> 02:54:59,100
I guess I'll stay in jail a little bit longer.

5583
02:54:59,580 --> 02:55:00,700
So unfortunate.

5584
02:55:02,860 --> 02:55:03,820
Oh, Pippa.

5585
02:55:04,300 --> 02:55:06,020
Either I lose to Pippa or Fillion.

5586
02:55:07,220 --> 02:55:08,800
That's your own property, so it's fine.

5587
02:55:09,320 --> 02:55:10,480
Should we twiddle or...

5588
02:55:10,480 --> 02:55:11,000
I'm dead.

5589
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:11,500
I'm dead.

5590
02:55:11,560 --> 02:55:12,500
I'm dead in a couple turns.

5591
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:15,440
Please, jail.

5592
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:17,320
Please let me have jail time.

5593
02:55:17,920 --> 02:55:19,180
You guys made a cult.

5594
02:55:19,380 --> 02:55:20,300
I'm muting myself.

5595
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:21,040
I'm going to cry.

5596
02:55:21,620 --> 02:55:22,900
Talk to my chat.

5597
02:55:23,780 --> 02:55:25,160
I can still hear you.

5598
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:26,960
Yay, money!

5599
02:55:28,060 --> 02:55:29,100
Oh, you know what?

5600
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:30,740
I'm going to go build a little bit.

5601
02:55:32,620 --> 02:55:33,360
I'm going to...

5602
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:34,480
As long as I'm not last.

5603
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:36,000
Wait, I can build.

5604
02:55:36,220 --> 02:55:36,400
Alright.

5605
02:55:36,460 --> 02:55:38,160
Let's build a little bit here.

5606
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:40,040
Since I'm in jail, I can still do real estate.

5607
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:40,920
You know?

5608
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:43,880
I can still do real estate while I'm here.

5609
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:45,280
That's the power of the jail system.

5610
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:47,500
Alright, we'll put a house here.

5611
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:49,160
And we'll put a house here.

5612
02:55:49,320 --> 02:55:51,440
Good luck, Loony.

5613
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:53,060
Good luck.

5614
02:55:54,060 --> 02:55:56,600
And then, I'm ready to roll my die.

5615
02:55:57,800 --> 02:55:58,280
Okay.

5616
02:56:00,900 --> 02:56:02,180
It just works.

5617
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:04,320
It just works.

5618
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:06,180
Thanks, Todd.

5619
02:56:06,340 --> 02:56:07,160
Thank God.

5620
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:08,980
Doki, how are you?

5621
02:56:09,280 --> 02:56:11,560
I guess I gotta pay a fine.

5622
02:56:11,800 --> 02:56:12,500
On my own.

5623
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:13,780
Oh, I'm on my own property.

5624
02:56:13,920 --> 02:56:14,760
Hey there, guys.

5625
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:17,520
This is so illegal.

5626
02:56:19,240 --> 02:56:21,060
Doki owes you a free railroad fare.

5627
02:56:21,320 --> 02:56:22,480
I'm hungry, man.

5628
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:23,240
I'm hungry.

5629
02:56:23,500 --> 02:56:24,360
Just kill me.

5630
02:56:24,900 --> 02:56:26,060
Doki, take me out back.

5631
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:27,240
Shoot me in the fucking head.

5632
02:56:27,420 --> 02:56:29,840
You guys are all just surviving right now.

5633
02:56:31,700 --> 02:56:33,300
But Lanna got none of it.

5634
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:34,200
Take me out back, man.

5635
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:37,240
Just declare bankruptcy now.

5636
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:40,100
Just declare bankruptcy.

5637
02:56:40,520 --> 02:56:41,860
That's all you have to do.

5638
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:42,280
Please, please, please.

5639
02:56:42,360 --> 02:56:42,700
Come on.

5640
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:44,460
Free parking, free parking, free parking, free parking.

5641
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:45,480
Free parking.

5642
02:56:46,360 --> 02:56:46,920
Where's that?

5643
02:56:47,620 --> 02:56:48,300
What is it?

5644
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:48,640
What is it?

5645
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:49,080
That's me.

5646
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:50,620
That's green.

5647
02:56:51,420 --> 02:56:53,000
That's the house I just built.

5648
02:56:53,620 --> 02:56:54,060
Goodbye.

5649
02:56:56,560 --> 02:56:57,800
You have to have to go.

5650
02:56:58,040 --> 02:56:59,280
I don't think I can even...

5651
02:56:59,280 --> 02:57:00,940
She cannot afford with mortgage.

5652
02:57:01,480 --> 02:57:04,400
She can't afford it even with a mortgage.

5653
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:05,480
I literally can't...

5654
02:57:05,480 --> 02:57:06,780
I can't afford anything.

5655
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:08,760
Goodbye, Lumi.

5656
02:57:08,920 --> 02:57:10,240
I literally can't fucking afford shit.

5657
02:57:10,980 --> 02:57:12,560
It was a good run, boys.

5658
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:15,260
Billy, move over in the cock chair.

5659
02:57:15,320 --> 02:57:16,080
I'm coming, okay?

5660
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:20,640
Then you won't even need to be in the cock chair.

5661
02:57:21,280 --> 02:57:22,400
Then you won't even need to be in the cock chair.

5662
02:57:22,400 --> 02:57:23,540
Yeah, true, true, true.

5663
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:24,640
It's bankrupt time.

5664
02:57:25,640 --> 02:57:26,680
It's bankrupt time.

5665
02:57:26,740 --> 02:57:27,680
At least I'm in my last place.

5666
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:30,200
Alright.

5667
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:30,860
Leroy Jenkins.

5668
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:35,400
I mean, with all those bailouts, it would be pretty embarrassing being in the... That's crazy.

5669
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:39,680
Wait, Doki just gets my properties?

5670
02:57:39,880 --> 02:57:41,420
Yeah, yeah, cause you couldn't pay...

5671
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:42,940
pay off, so I take your property.

5672
02:57:43,800 --> 02:57:45,120
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

5673
02:57:45,280 --> 02:57:45,980
Ask me anything.

5674
02:57:49,420 --> 02:57:50,780
Alright, Pipa, what you got?

5675
02:57:51,060 --> 02:57:51,940
Look at that.

5676
02:57:54,020 --> 02:57:54,580
There's me.

5677
02:57:55,180 --> 02:57:55,980
Uh oh.

5678
02:57:57,440 --> 02:57:59,540
Wait, so you don't have everything except Leroy yellow.

5679
02:57:59,720 --> 02:58:01,020
Wait, Pipa, use your bonus.

5680
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:02,960
Doki might roll yellow.

5681
02:58:03,640 --> 02:58:05,460
I could accident... I could get a...

5682
02:58:05,480 --> 02:58:06,820
I could get on yellow and then I'd lose...

5683
02:58:06,820 --> 02:58:07,480
Wait, no, I could mortgage.

5684
02:58:08,300 --> 02:58:09,900
I could mortgage though.

5685
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:11,960
Yeah, it's not worth much.

5686
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:14,820
She's surviving by like the...

5687
02:58:14,820 --> 02:58:16,060
Yeah, four dollars.

5688
02:58:16,780 --> 02:58:18,020
For the benefits.

5689
02:58:18,300 --> 02:58:18,620
Okay.

5690
02:58:18,760 --> 02:58:19,700
Alright, here you go.

5691
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:21,140
I might get the yellow though.

5692
02:58:21,300 --> 02:58:22,860
All you gotta do is bankrupt her.

5693
02:58:23,260 --> 02:58:23,700
Fuck.

5694
02:58:24,300 --> 02:58:25,560
Do I go to jail again?

5695
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:27,360
Pipa, you're the law.

5696
02:58:27,820 --> 02:58:30,300
I was like, it's funny if I go to jail again.

5697
02:58:31,060 --> 02:58:31,500
Yay!

5698
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:31,960
Pipalism.

5699
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:34,120
Pipalism is this...

5700
02:58:34,960 --> 02:58:35,480
Pipa!

5701
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:37,780
Where are you gonna go here?

5702
02:58:38,060 --> 02:58:39,840
I can put it on here, on the reds.

5703
02:58:39,860 --> 02:58:41,180
I hear boss music.

5704
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:45,500
I'm gonna put one here, here, and here.

5705
02:58:46,440 --> 02:58:47,220
Oh wait, no.

5706
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:48,300
I'm on a buttricks.

5707
02:58:48,680 --> 02:58:53,800
You have to eventually land here sometime, right?

5708
02:58:53,960 --> 02:58:54,480
You have to eventually land here sometime, right?

5709
02:58:54,480 --> 02:58:56,460
You only won because you cheated when Pipa DC'd at the start.

5710
02:58:56,920 --> 02:58:58,240
I said it.

5711
02:58:58,240 --> 02:58:58,720
I said it.

5712
02:58:58,720 --> 02:58:59,320
You know what?

5713
02:58:59,440 --> 02:59:00,120
True, yeah.

5714
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:06,740
Okay, to be fair though, each one of us cheated in some way in this Monopoly game.

5715
02:59:06,740 --> 02:59:07,380
We live in a society.

5716
02:59:07,380 --> 02:59:08,680
What did I cheat?

5717
02:59:08,980 --> 02:59:10,900
Oh shit.

5718
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:16,100
I knew Poirot was investing in that one.

5719
02:59:16,220 --> 02:59:18,200
I knew I calculated it.

5720
02:59:18,940 --> 02:59:19,920
Oh my god.

5721
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:21,200
Perfect calculations.

5722
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:23,080
Oh god.

5723
02:59:23,800 --> 02:59:25,500
You can make it to jail.

5724
02:59:26,040 --> 02:59:26,740
Jail is so close.

5725
02:59:26,740 --> 02:59:27,560
You can still go to jail.

5726
02:59:28,520 --> 02:59:29,820
I'm not making it to jail.

5727
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:31,760
You can almost get there.

5728
02:59:31,780 --> 02:59:32,340
Wait, $70!

5729
02:59:32,720 --> 02:59:34,380
Oh god.

5730
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:36,440
$70!

5731
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:39,520
Oh my god.

5732
02:59:39,640 --> 02:59:40,560
You can still land on yellow.

5733
02:59:40,860 --> 02:59:43,340
No, I can't.

5734
02:59:43,340 --> 02:59:45,640
Yeah, and you can tie your lap around the board later.

5735
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:47,880
It's okay, Pimba.

5736
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:48,320
You got this.

5737
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:49,300
Why?

5738
02:59:50,180 --> 02:59:52,920
I don't want you to throw me on.

5739
02:59:52,960 --> 02:59:53,740
Oh hey, too hard.

5740
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:54,440
I want you to win.

5741
02:59:54,480 --> 02:59:56,040
She just doesn't want me to win.

5742
02:59:58,240 --> 02:59:58,420
I don't want to win.

5743
02:59:59,820 --> 03:00:00,700
Alright, let's see.

5744
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:02,280
Where are you going to head to next?

5745
03:00:02,500 --> 03:00:02,580
Oh, fuck.

5746
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:06,520
She's like an actual murderer.

5747
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:09,240
She's just going to die regardless of you landing on the red here.

5748
03:00:09,360 --> 03:00:09,760
You're going to die regardless of you landing on the red here.

5749
03:00:10,380 --> 03:00:11,960
I'm going to...

5750
03:00:12,540 --> 03:00:14,140
Oh no, not the millionaires.

5751
03:00:14,140 --> 03:00:14,960
How many more millionaires must fall?

5752
03:00:15,080 --> 03:00:16,680
Oh no, not the millionaires.

5753
03:00:19,900 --> 03:00:21,300
Those fucking poor millionaires, man.

5754
03:00:21,300 --> 03:00:21,320
Those fucking poor millionaires, man.

5755
03:00:21,320 --> 03:00:22,600
And how much money do we need, Rich?

5756
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:26,840
I'm with you, Pimba.

5757
03:00:28,260 --> 03:00:29,660
Alright, Pimba, you got this.

5758
03:00:30,120 --> 03:00:31,560
Come on, grab your pitchfork.

5759
03:00:34,100 --> 03:00:34,660
Boardwalks.

5760
03:00:34,660 --> 03:00:35,480
Dave Scum.

5761
03:00:36,780 --> 03:00:37,340
Boardwalks.

5762
03:00:38,620 --> 03:00:39,180
No!

5763
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:42,860
No, I think that's a seven.

5764
03:00:42,860 --> 03:00:43,660
No, that's three rounds.

5765
03:00:44,680 --> 03:00:46,040
That's the one that did me in.

5766
03:00:46,240 --> 03:00:46,560
Yeah!

5767
03:00:47,600 --> 03:00:48,660
You can mortgage.

5768
03:00:48,980 --> 03:00:49,820
You can mortgage.

5769
03:00:51,840 --> 03:00:53,040
You can mortgage.

5770
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:53,560
You can mortgage.

5771
03:00:53,940 --> 03:00:55,160
It might be JoJo.

5772
03:00:55,340 --> 03:00:56,100
You can.

5773
03:00:58,020 --> 03:00:59,120
You're still at home.

5774
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:02,480
It's all meant for the effect of me getting killed.

5775
03:01:02,800 --> 03:01:02,880
No!

5776
03:01:04,900 --> 03:01:05,700
Oh, God.

5777
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:07,880
Alright, Pimba, what are you going to do?

5778
03:01:08,220 --> 03:01:09,100
What are you going to do?

5779
03:01:09,180 --> 03:01:10,200
What are you going to do?

5780
03:01:10,460 --> 03:01:13,840
You have to sell each house.

5781
03:01:13,880 --> 03:01:15,660
There's one with three, so you have to sell that.

5782
03:01:16,120 --> 03:01:17,500
And then you have to sell...

5783
03:01:17,500 --> 03:01:19,260
And then you have to keep selling.

5784
03:01:19,440 --> 03:01:22,080
And then you have to sell the other one.

5785
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:24,140
I'm so nervous to watch some...

5786
03:01:24,140 --> 03:01:25,000
Oh, Pimba, no!

5787
03:01:26,100 --> 03:01:26,940
You're almost there!

5788
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:28,080
One more house.

5789
03:01:28,260 --> 03:01:30,520
You can afford it now!

5790
03:01:30,900 --> 03:01:31,720
I think it's $750.

5791
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:32,820
Oh, you can't.

5792
03:01:32,900 --> 03:01:33,820
Sorry, I lied.

5793
03:01:33,900 --> 03:01:34,360
I forgot.

5794
03:01:38,160 --> 03:01:39,980
Now you can afford it.

5795
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:41,660
It's been an honor serving with you, Pimba.

5796
03:01:42,180 --> 03:01:43,080
She's still alive!

5797
03:01:43,360 --> 03:01:46,940
Let's look at you.

5798
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:47,800
You need to get into jail.

5799
03:01:48,360 --> 03:01:50,540
You need to get into jail.

5800
03:01:50,700 --> 03:01:50,960
Don't worry.

5801
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:53,440
Yay!

5802
03:01:54,960 --> 03:01:55,900
Oh my god.

5803
03:01:56,200 --> 03:01:56,600
Seven.

5804
03:01:56,740 --> 03:01:57,260
Where's that?

5805
03:01:57,780 --> 03:01:58,720
Oh, hey, there's chance.

5806
03:01:58,840 --> 03:01:59,800
Maybe I can get to jail.

5807
03:02:00,460 --> 03:02:01,720
Yeah, I can just click out of the game.

5808
03:02:02,480 --> 03:02:04,280
If I just tab out of the game...

5809
03:02:04,280 --> 03:02:05,940
Oh, yay!

5810
03:02:06,560 --> 03:02:07,920
You get to go in jail!

5811
03:02:10,340 --> 03:02:11,300
It's an honor.

5812
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:13,800
Where is she going next?

5813
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:13,860
She doesn't deserve it.

5814
03:02:13,860 --> 03:02:15,180
She's been framed, Your Honor.

5815
03:02:15,340 --> 03:02:16,160
Let her go!

5816
03:02:16,340 --> 03:02:17,860
Where is she going next, though?

5817
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:20,180
She's been framed.

5818
03:02:20,180 --> 03:02:21,800
Okay, here we go.

5819
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:23,880
We'll put a green here.

5820
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:25,900
And then also here.

5821
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:28,300
Bro, she's buying houses from jail!

5822
03:02:36,080 --> 03:02:36,760
Yay!

5823
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:39,280
She's like the Joker, bro.

5824
03:02:39,580 --> 03:02:41,460
I called out to you.

5825
03:02:41,480 --> 03:02:42,640
It's rich person jail.

5826
03:02:42,660 --> 03:02:42,980
She laughs like the Joker.

5827
03:02:43,440 --> 03:02:44,600
It's rich person jail.

5828
03:02:45,340 --> 03:02:46,020
Society.

5829
03:02:48,900 --> 03:02:49,580
Society.

5830
03:02:49,580 --> 03:02:50,880
She can lie in jail, too.

5831
03:02:51,440 --> 03:02:51,460
Society.

5832
03:02:53,540 --> 03:02:56,080
Oh, she's one spot away from jail.

5833
03:02:57,360 --> 03:02:59,660
Oh, hey, I just bought houses there, too.

5834
03:03:00,020 --> 03:03:00,980
What a coincidence.

5835
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:01,880
Did you hear that?

5836
03:03:01,880 --> 03:03:02,700
The police are coming.

5837
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:04,520
Goodbye, Pippa.

5838
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:06,440
Wait, mortgage everything.

5839
03:03:06,860 --> 03:03:07,860
You can still mortgage everything.

5840
03:03:08,620 --> 03:03:09,800
You can mortgage everything.

5841
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:10,960
Yeah, see?

5842
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:12,060
You can afford it now.

5843
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:13,240
Hang on for dear life, Pippa.

5844
03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:15,520
Oh!

5845
03:03:16,680 --> 03:03:17,520
There you go.

5846
03:03:18,200 --> 03:03:19,260
Is that... is that...

5847
03:03:19,580 --> 03:03:19,860
Oh, God.

5848
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:21,320
You need to mortgage one more.

5849
03:03:21,780 --> 03:03:23,100
This is so grim.

5850
03:03:23,980 --> 03:03:24,800
There you go.

5851
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:28,400
I don't think you can afford it.

5852
03:03:28,720 --> 03:03:29,640
You need one more.

5853
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:31,200
She's only one more mortgage.

5854
03:03:31,300 --> 03:03:32,180
And then she can.

5855
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:33,480
Oh, brother.

5856
03:03:34,300 --> 03:03:35,140
There you go.

5857
03:03:36,340 --> 03:03:39,140
That last mortgage is looking at you.

5858
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:40,780
You gotta mortgage it.

5859
03:03:40,980 --> 03:03:42,180
You gotta mortgage it.

5860
03:03:42,320 --> 03:03:43,520
You can also trade with Doki.

5861
03:03:44,620 --> 03:03:46,260
I can't even afford her.

5862
03:03:46,380 --> 03:03:48,220
I can't even afford it.

5863
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:53,640
You can't even afford it.

5864
03:03:53,640 --> 03:03:55,240
It's not over until it's over.

5865
03:03:55,260 --> 03:03:55,920
Oh, my gosh.

5866
03:03:55,980 --> 03:03:56,800
I'm in jail.

5867
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:57,680
How could this happen to me?

5868
03:03:57,680 --> 03:03:58,860
This is just a training, Pippa.

5869
03:03:58,980 --> 03:04:00,060
This is your rocky arc.

5870
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:00,700
Don't worry.

5871
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:02,280
How could I be in jail?

5872
03:04:02,300 --> 03:04:03,440
Oh, it's so unfortunate.

5873
03:04:03,820 --> 03:04:05,240
I can't even leave jail.

5874
03:04:06,280 --> 03:04:07,900
Where is she gonna go next?

5875
03:04:08,860 --> 03:04:09,660
Oh, my God.

5876
03:04:10,180 --> 03:04:10,600
Boardwalk.

5877
03:04:10,680 --> 03:04:10,940
Okay.

5878
03:04:11,880 --> 03:04:12,720
Wait, boardwalk!

5879
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:13,620
That's where it all ends.

5880
03:04:13,740 --> 03:04:14,200
Okay, okay.

5881
03:04:14,280 --> 03:04:17,640
I know you can't afford boardwalks, so I'm just gonna put houses on here.

5882
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:21,940
No, go on boardwalk.

5883
03:04:22,100 --> 03:04:26,200
No, go on boardwalk.

5884
03:04:26,200 --> 03:04:27,460
Those are my properties, bro.

5885
03:04:27,640 --> 03:04:27,980
Those are my properties, bro.

5886
03:04:27,980 --> 03:04:28,620
We all live down here.

5887
03:04:28,620 --> 03:04:29,900
That was your property.

5888
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:32,680
Come hang out with us.

5889
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:35,440
You can fit three on the cock chair.

5890
03:04:36,340 --> 03:04:38,640
I'm fighting Lumi and the Gulag right now, Pippa.

5891
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:38,780
I'm fighting Lumi and the Gulag right now, Pippa.

5892
03:04:38,940 --> 03:04:40,580
Oh, you got saved!

5893
03:04:41,620 --> 03:04:43,120
You got saved!

5894
03:04:43,560 --> 03:04:45,260
By the luxury tax!

5895
03:04:46,140 --> 03:04:46,740
Oh, my God.

5896
03:04:46,740 --> 03:04:46,940
Oh, my God.

5897
03:04:47,640 --> 03:04:48,400
Oh, my fucking God.

5898
03:04:50,900 --> 03:04:52,100
Wow, I feel good.

5899
03:04:53,440 --> 03:04:54,400
You can victory.

5900
03:04:54,600 --> 03:04:56,060
You just declared bankruptcy.

5901
03:04:57,060 --> 03:04:58,520
You can't lose right now.

5902
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:00,120
You can't lose right now.

5903
03:05:00,120 --> 03:05:01,340
You can just give up.

5904
03:05:01,360 --> 03:05:02,340
You're so good, Pippa.

5905
03:05:02,440 --> 03:05:02,720
Don't worry.

5906
03:05:02,980 --> 03:05:04,280
I'm rubbing your shoulders.

5907
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:06,360
You're still in this fight, Pippa.

5908
03:05:06,360 --> 03:05:07,180
One more swing.

5909
03:05:07,260 --> 03:05:08,600
Don't touch me with your loser hand.

5910
03:05:10,020 --> 03:05:11,060
Maybe that's why.

5911
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:14,320
Oh, hey.

5912
03:05:14,440 --> 03:05:16,400
That's the one I just put your house on.

5913
03:05:16,440 --> 03:05:16,920
It's okay.

5914
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:17,580
It's okay.

5915
03:05:17,620 --> 03:05:17,620
It's okay.

5916
03:05:17,640 --> 03:05:18,600
It's not worth anything.

5917
03:05:18,920 --> 03:05:19,360
Look at that.

5918
03:05:19,400 --> 03:05:20,100
It's just $20.

5919
03:05:20,520 --> 03:05:21,900
You're good.

5920
03:05:22,940 --> 03:05:23,640
You're good.

5921
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:24,360
Yeah, you're good.

5922
03:05:24,500 --> 03:05:25,600
The cockroaches came right there.

5923
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:31,420
I don't have it.

5924
03:05:31,580 --> 03:05:32,100
It's okay.

5925
03:05:32,560 --> 03:05:34,760
I got a ghetto jail free card.

5926
03:05:35,640 --> 03:05:37,200
That's my place, isn't it?

5927
03:05:37,360 --> 03:05:38,320
Oh, it is.

5928
03:05:38,420 --> 03:05:38,920
Hey there.

5929
03:05:42,280 --> 03:05:43,740
Why is this so hard, huh?

5930
03:05:45,240 --> 03:05:45,860
It's alright.

5931
03:05:46,240 --> 03:05:48,780
She still has like a long way to go.

5932
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:50,800
Yeah, yeah.

5933
03:05:50,940 --> 03:05:51,820
Yeah, for sure.

5934
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:52,180
For sure.

5935
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:54,020
We got this.

5936
03:05:54,080 --> 03:05:54,860
I believe in you.

5937
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:55,420
Wait, Pippa.

5938
03:05:55,480 --> 03:05:56,100
We need to negotiate.

5939
03:05:56,680 --> 03:05:57,480
Part of the deal.

5940
03:05:57,660 --> 03:06:01,740
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

5941
03:06:04,260 --> 03:06:04,700
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

5942
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:05,740
You can afford to have a mortgage.

5943
03:06:05,980 --> 03:06:06,420
Yeah.

5944
03:06:08,400 --> 03:06:10,840
It would be a shame if you landed on my place again.

5945
03:06:12,160 --> 03:06:12,600
Yeah.

5946
03:06:14,620 --> 03:06:17,480
It would be such a shame.

5947
03:06:17,640 --> 03:06:18,820
It would suck.

5948
03:06:19,220 --> 03:06:19,860
Wow.

5949
03:06:20,460 --> 03:06:21,980
Hey, you get to visit jail.

5950
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:25,720
I'm the skin of your teeth right now.

5951
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:28,280
Now that Louie's not touching me anymore.

5952
03:06:28,860 --> 03:06:29,500
But I'm well.

5953
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:29,920
Oh my god.

5954
03:06:29,920 --> 03:06:31,500
You get to visit where I was.

5955
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:33,440
It's like a tourist destination now.

5956
03:06:33,700 --> 03:06:36,380
The famous dokey bird was in that jail.

5957
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:38,620
I hate dokey bird.

5958
03:06:40,260 --> 03:06:42,360
You can buy souvenirs for like...

5959
03:06:42,940 --> 03:06:43,340
$75.

5960
03:06:44,500 --> 03:06:44,900
$75.

5961
03:06:46,560 --> 03:06:48,280
You should mortgage it.

5962
03:06:48,400 --> 03:06:49,620
I'm gonna need you to roll too.

5963
03:06:49,760 --> 03:06:52,620
You can buy her souvenirs.

5964
03:06:52,800 --> 03:06:55,020
Good luck with like two sides of this board.

5965
03:06:55,380 --> 03:06:57,080
Good luck with like two sides of this board.

5966
03:06:57,080 --> 03:06:57,200
Wait.

5967
03:06:59,460 --> 03:07:00,240
Yeah, it's fine.

5968
03:07:00,260 --> 03:07:00,760
You're fine.

5969
03:07:00,820 --> 03:07:01,120
You're fine.

5970
03:07:01,160 --> 03:07:01,680
Don't worry about it.

5971
03:07:01,700 --> 03:07:02,400
You're so fine.

5972
03:07:02,580 --> 03:07:03,580
You're fine.

5973
03:07:03,740 --> 03:07:04,180
Don't worry about it.

5974
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:06,160
You're gonna be okay, Pippa.

5975
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:08,080
What's the worst that could happen?

5976
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:09,560
You're gonna land on the community chest.

5977
03:07:10,500 --> 03:07:12,100
Wait, how much does it cost us?

5978
03:07:12,800 --> 03:07:14,160
It's only like $130.

5979
03:07:14,300 --> 03:07:15,080
So like it's fine.

5980
03:07:15,860 --> 03:07:16,820
It's like...

5981
03:07:16,820 --> 03:07:19,280
You're about to mortgage it.

5982
03:07:19,580 --> 03:07:20,900
I'm about to mortgage it.

5983
03:07:22,460 --> 03:07:24,740
She's calculating right now.

5984
03:07:25,360 --> 03:07:25,960
Yeah!

5985
03:07:25,960 --> 03:07:26,060
Yeah!

5986
03:07:28,940 --> 03:07:32,660
That whole time she gets $20 from me.

5987
03:07:32,720 --> 03:07:33,520
That whole time she gets $20 from me.

5988
03:07:33,520 --> 03:07:36,000
That $20 is gonna be so much.

5989
03:07:36,680 --> 03:07:38,000
That $20 is gonna be so much.

5990
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:38,680
Oh, you're gonna leave!

5991
03:07:39,300 --> 03:07:39,720
Goodbye.

5992
03:07:42,220 --> 03:07:43,280
He's so mortgaged!

5993
03:07:43,720 --> 03:07:44,340
She's so...

5994
03:07:46,900 --> 03:07:48,980
Yeah, if you mortgage, you can afford it!

5995
03:07:49,080 --> 03:07:50,720
If you mortgage, you can afford it!

5996
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:55,720
If you land on this face, I'm gonna jump.

5997
03:07:57,340 --> 03:07:57,940
Thank you.

5998
03:07:59,360 --> 03:08:00,420
That was so funny.

5999
03:08:01,320 --> 03:08:02,700
Chad, it's not over till the last man sings.

6000
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:03,320
You're still in this.

6001
03:08:03,420 --> 03:08:04,580
You're still in this.

6002
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:09,560
Till I land on this face, man.

6003
03:08:10,520 --> 03:08:11,920
That's your own space, right?

6004
03:08:12,140 --> 03:08:12,980
Yeah, see?

6005
03:08:13,940 --> 03:08:14,900
It's your own space!

6006
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:17,280
Look at that!

6007
03:08:17,620 --> 03:08:18,600
Oh my god.

6008
03:08:19,380 --> 03:08:20,740
You're still here.

6009
03:08:22,520 --> 03:08:23,980
I think she actually...

6010
03:08:23,980 --> 03:08:24,400
No, no, no.

6011
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:26,580
I just missed it.

6012
03:08:26,620 --> 03:08:28,880
I landed on my local waterworks.

6013
03:08:29,260 --> 03:08:29,960
Oh no!

6014
03:08:31,780 --> 03:08:33,100
Come on, Pippa!

6015
03:08:33,100 --> 03:08:34,020
You're still in it!

6016
03:08:34,200 --> 03:08:35,060
You're still in it!

6017
03:08:35,860 --> 03:08:37,900
Pippa, you can go to jail if you roll lucky.

6018
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:39,360
Yeah, but she's not lucky.

6019
03:08:39,580 --> 03:08:40,040
Damn!

6020
03:08:42,500 --> 03:08:43,920
Okay, now it's over.

6021
03:08:45,180 --> 03:08:45,700
No.

6022
03:08:46,260 --> 03:08:47,360
Now it's over.

6023
03:08:47,360 --> 03:08:48,100
Say it ain't so!

6024
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:49,800
Say it ain't so!

6025
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:55,260
Give me all yellow properties.

6026
03:08:56,040 --> 03:08:56,560
Give me all yellow properties.

6027
03:08:56,680 --> 03:08:58,180
Give me all your yellow properties.

6028
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:00,400
Stop!

6029
03:09:01,200 --> 03:09:01,720
Stop!

6030
03:09:01,780 --> 03:09:02,640
She's already dead, Your Honor!

6031
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:03,600
Your dignity!

6032
03:09:03,940 --> 03:09:05,740
Hold your ears up high, Pippa!

6033
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:06,380
Two.

6034
03:09:06,380 --> 03:09:06,620
Two.

6035
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:09,440
I want all...

6036
03:09:09,440 --> 03:09:11,740
I want all your yellows.

6037
03:09:11,940 --> 03:09:13,680
Change your YouTube banner, Pippa!

6038
03:09:14,380 --> 03:09:15,880
I want all your yellows.

6039
03:09:15,880 --> 03:09:18,980
If you wanna keep going, I want all your yellows.

6040
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:20,160
You can't get short!

6041
03:09:20,920 --> 03:09:22,300
Make a TikTok, Pippa!

6042
03:09:23,180 --> 03:09:23,800
Alright, no.

6043
03:09:23,840 --> 03:09:24,620
This is gonna work out.

6044
03:09:24,720 --> 03:09:28,040
She's gonna land on all of the luxury taxes.

6045
03:09:28,340 --> 03:09:28,580
Alright?

6046
03:09:28,760 --> 03:09:29,980
How much do you need?

6047
03:09:30,200 --> 03:09:31,300
How much does she need?

6048
03:09:32,860 --> 03:09:34,040
How much was it?

6049
03:09:35,780 --> 03:09:36,720
Give me a hundred.

6050
03:09:36,860 --> 03:09:37,180
Give me a hundred.

6051
03:09:37,280 --> 03:09:37,800
Are you kidding me?

6052
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:38,320
Two hundred.

6053
03:09:38,400 --> 03:09:39,560
Two hundred.

6054
03:09:39,800 --> 03:09:40,540
Two hundred.

6055
03:09:40,600 --> 03:09:41,480
No, it was a hundred.

6056
03:09:42,240 --> 03:09:43,100
Not two hundred.

6057
03:09:43,280 --> 03:09:43,900
No, it was a hundred.

6058
03:09:44,460 --> 03:09:46,560
You already told me how much it was.

6059
03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:47,980
You already told me how much it was.

6060
03:09:48,880 --> 03:09:51,160
I told you we could talk about this!

6061
03:09:51,840 --> 03:09:54,000
I can't talk about this!

6062
03:09:54,120 --> 03:09:56,240
Not even the hundred and ninety-nine?

6063
03:09:56,640 --> 03:09:57,960
Are you kidding me?

6064
03:10:00,580 --> 03:10:01,620
Accept the deal.

6065
03:10:01,980 --> 03:10:02,720
Accept it.

6066
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:03,720
I'm gonna lose my dignity.

6067
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:04,520
Accept.

6068
03:10:04,520 --> 03:10:04,840
No!

6069
03:10:05,800 --> 03:10:07,060
She bet the deal!

6070
03:10:07,660 --> 03:10:09,240
She bet the deal!

6071
03:10:10,260 --> 03:10:11,360
Oh my god.

6072
03:10:12,540 --> 03:10:15,280
Are you gonna buy back the mortgage after doing this to her?

6073
03:10:16,020 --> 03:10:17,640
I'll pay back the mortgage.

6074
03:10:17,780 --> 03:10:18,240
She'll be fine.

6075
03:10:18,480 --> 03:10:19,180
Oh my god!

6076
03:10:19,340 --> 03:10:20,860
At least let me be close!

6077
03:10:21,640 --> 03:10:22,120
Stop!

6078
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:28,560
I'm gonna pay for it.

6079
03:10:28,740 --> 03:10:29,440
It's so painful.

6080
03:10:29,700 --> 03:10:30,160
Thank you.

6081
03:10:30,260 --> 03:10:31,680
It's so painful to watch.

6082
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:32,860
You're still in for it.

6083
03:10:32,860 --> 03:10:33,760
You're still in it.

6084
03:10:34,360 --> 03:10:35,200
You're still in it.

6085
03:10:35,200 --> 03:10:36,000
I'm blocking you after this.

6086
03:10:37,140 --> 03:10:38,300
You're still in it.

6087
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:41,180
I have no property, donkey!

6088
03:10:41,880 --> 03:10:44,240
You're gonna stare in your eyes and you'll perish.

6089
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:45,320
Welcome to my house.

6090
03:10:47,560 --> 03:10:48,340
Oh no.

6091
03:10:49,660 --> 03:10:50,520
It's okay, baby.

6092
03:10:50,620 --> 03:10:51,220
You're gonna get go.

6093
03:10:51,780 --> 03:10:52,940
You're gonna land on go.

6094
03:10:53,740 --> 03:10:54,200
Yeah, I'm...

6095
03:10:54,200 --> 03:10:55,720
We're gonna go on the boardwalk.

6096
03:10:56,040 --> 03:10:57,560
We're gonna go on the boardwalk!

6097
03:10:57,560 --> 03:11:01,620
We're gonna land on the boardwalk!

6098
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:02,100
Boardwalk!

6099
03:11:03,280 --> 03:11:04,520
Oh my god!

6100
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:06,400
Boardwalk!

6101
03:11:07,340 --> 03:11:10,180
We actually have a boardwalk!

6102
03:11:10,240 --> 03:11:11,700
You have nothing I want.

6103
03:11:12,720 --> 03:11:13,240
No!

6104
03:11:13,500 --> 03:11:14,020
No!

6105
03:11:15,980 --> 03:11:16,540
No deal.

6106
03:11:17,440 --> 03:11:18,040
No deal.

6107
03:11:18,420 --> 03:11:18,940
Bankrupt.

6108
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,300
We end on boardwalk.

6109
03:11:20,660 --> 03:11:20,980
You can make it a spectacle.

6110
03:11:20,980 --> 03:11:22,420
It's a beautiful step, Pippa.

6111
03:11:22,520 --> 03:11:23,280
Watch the steps.

6112
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:25,860
They're clear of bankruptcy right now.

6113
03:11:25,940 --> 03:11:26,320
All the four.

6114
03:11:26,420 --> 03:11:26,860
All the four.

6115
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:28,560
All the four.

6116
03:11:28,560 --> 03:11:28,560
All the four.

6117
03:11:28,700 --> 03:11:29,040
No!

6118
03:11:29,160 --> 03:11:30,940
I just wanna say this is Fillion's fault.

6119
03:11:31,680 --> 03:11:32,160
He didn't go.

6120
03:11:33,800 --> 03:11:35,980
As a prophecy for Todd!

6121
03:11:37,140 --> 03:11:39,380
We end on boardwalk!

6122
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:40,440
We end on boardwalk!

6123
03:11:40,900 --> 03:11:43,920
Chad, I wasn't saying boardwalk when I rolled to get it.

6124
03:11:44,040 --> 03:11:45,860
I was saying it because I was predicting where it would end.

6125
03:11:47,140 --> 03:11:48,460
That was a callback.

6126
03:11:48,520 --> 03:11:48,880
You know what I'm saying?

6127
03:11:48,980 --> 03:11:49,600
Oh my god.

6128
03:11:50,280 --> 03:11:51,500
Monopoly's pretty easy, guys.

6129
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:52,820
Holy shit.

6130
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:54,860
Yeah, you have a fun time.

6131
03:11:55,620 --> 03:11:57,380
Yeah, I actually got a full head start.

6132
03:11:57,400 --> 03:11:59,440
Nobody wins with Monopoly.

6133
03:11:59,440 --> 03:12:01,000
So, we had a great time, everyone.

6134
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:02,420
I had a great time, guys.

6135
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:05,760
Yeah, we have cucumber sandwiches for refreshments, too.

6136
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:06,300
Help yourself.

6137
03:12:06,520 --> 03:12:07,480
Help yourself to my head.

6138
03:12:07,480 --> 03:12:09,780
Help yourself to my pride.

6139
03:12:10,160 --> 03:12:12,660
Just eat straight away from my head.

6140
03:12:12,740 --> 03:12:13,540
Why don't you?

6141
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:14,600
It's okay.

6142
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:16,520
I rehired all you guys to work for me.

6143
03:12:17,200 --> 03:12:17,720
Oh.

6144
03:12:18,100 --> 03:12:19,640
I wasn't even mean.

6145
03:12:21,520 --> 03:12:22,580
Wasn't even mean.

6146
03:12:22,580 --> 03:12:24,580
Now you all work for me now.

6147
03:12:25,200 --> 03:12:25,720
Yay!

6148
03:12:25,720 --> 03:12:26,180
Yay!

6149
03:12:26,580 --> 03:12:28,420
Okay, can we talk about something?

6150
03:12:29,800 --> 03:12:31,640
I'm really sorry for flaming you guys.

6151
03:12:32,440 --> 03:12:32,840
What?

6152
03:12:33,240 --> 03:12:33,540
Oh.

6153
03:12:35,720 --> 03:12:37,600
And I want to make a peace offering.

6154
03:12:37,820 --> 03:12:39,420
I want to make a peace offering.

6155
03:12:40,400 --> 03:12:41,460
Yeah, what is it?

6156
03:12:41,900 --> 03:12:43,520
Okay, you guys talk for a minute.

6157
03:12:43,620 --> 03:12:44,860
I'll go put it together.

6158
03:12:45,100 --> 03:12:46,940
Give me one sec.

6159
03:12:47,200 --> 03:12:48,280
A peace offering?

6160
03:12:49,700 --> 03:12:50,600
I'm kind of scared.

6161
03:12:50,900 --> 03:12:51,380
Me, too.

6162
03:12:53,780 --> 03:12:54,580
I'm scared.

6163
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:55,420
What is she going to do?

6164
03:12:55,720 --> 03:12:56,100
I'll be back.

6165
03:12:56,120 --> 03:12:56,500
I'll be back.

6166
03:12:57,300 --> 03:12:58,500
What is she going to do?

6167
03:12:58,520 --> 03:12:59,540
Guys, I don't trust her.

6168
03:13:00,060 --> 03:13:01,080
I don't trust her either.

6169
03:13:01,380 --> 03:13:02,220
Yeah, I don't trust her.

6170
03:13:02,520 --> 03:13:04,040
Remember when she rigged the game?

6171
03:13:04,340 --> 03:13:05,420
Yeah, remember that?

6172
03:13:05,560 --> 03:13:09,720
Yeah, remember when we made a deal and then she deleted the tweet?

6173
03:13:09,980 --> 03:13:10,820
She fucking went back.

6174
03:13:12,360 --> 03:13:13,520
That's scummy behavior.

6175
03:13:13,900 --> 03:13:15,720
Yeah, like the one person that...

6176
03:13:16,280 --> 03:13:18,180
I'm going to remember this for the next Vtuber Awards.

6177
03:13:18,680 --> 03:13:19,240
Oh yeah.

6178
03:13:19,720 --> 03:13:20,920
Adding it to my call out post.

6179
03:13:22,620 --> 03:13:24,200
I'm writing the twit longer, Fillion.

6180
03:13:24,920 --> 03:13:25,320
Okay.

6181
03:13:26,280 --> 03:13:27,780
Don't be like, Joki actually doesn't care about the awards.

6182
03:13:27,880 --> 03:13:28,840
She's acting like you have one already.

6183
03:13:30,080 --> 03:13:31,940
I'm sick of this attitude, dude.

6184
03:13:34,100 --> 03:13:35,120
It's not my fault.

6185
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:35,800
I know business.

6186
03:13:40,940 --> 03:13:42,040
I'm still going.

6187
03:13:43,820 --> 03:13:45,640
Where are you doing?

6188
03:13:46,140 --> 03:13:47,860
I'm making a peace offering.

6189
03:13:48,240 --> 03:13:49,020
Oh, okay.

6190
03:13:49,120 --> 03:13:50,740
Okay, sounds good.

6191
03:13:50,860 --> 03:13:51,440
We're waiting.

6192
03:13:51,440 --> 03:13:51,680
You're waiting?

6193
03:13:52,320 --> 03:13:54,060
You have to wait like a minute and a half.

6194
03:13:54,180 --> 03:13:54,560
I'm drawing.

6195
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:56,640
You're taking a really long time.

6196
03:13:56,760 --> 03:13:57,280
There's dead air.

6197
03:13:59,680 --> 03:14:04,020
Do you not care about stream content?

6198
03:14:04,400 --> 03:14:05,460
Do you not care about us?

6199
03:14:05,500 --> 03:14:05,640
I'm trying.

6200
03:14:05,880 --> 03:14:06,160
I'm trying.

6201
03:14:06,380 --> 03:14:07,500
Are you sabotaging?

6202
03:14:07,860 --> 03:14:09,660
Are you sabotaging our streams?

6203
03:14:10,220 --> 03:14:11,360
What's your favorite color?

6204
03:14:14,720 --> 03:14:15,600
That's the content.

6205
03:14:15,800 --> 03:14:16,040
We're here.

6206
03:14:19,320 --> 03:14:20,460
Do a flip, Philly.

6207
03:14:20,460 --> 03:14:21,400
Yeah, Philly.

6208
03:14:21,460 --> 03:14:21,900
Do a flip.

6209
03:14:22,040 --> 03:14:23,120
I'm drawing, dude!

6210
03:14:23,560 --> 03:14:24,820
What flip are you drawing?

6211
03:14:24,840 --> 03:14:26,280
I'm drawing a scene called Mask 2, okay?

6212
03:14:26,800 --> 03:14:28,980
Can you balance a plate on your head too?

6213
03:14:29,820 --> 03:14:30,500
Yes, watch.

6214
03:14:31,180 --> 03:14:32,200
What is this, like this?

6215
03:14:32,260 --> 03:14:32,440
Here?

6216
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:36,920
Where did you grab a plate?

6217
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:41,000
It wasn't glass.

6218
03:14:41,060 --> 03:14:41,940
We didn't hear it shatter.

6219
03:14:42,020 --> 03:14:42,900
It was a shell.

6220
03:14:43,720 --> 03:14:45,660
I feel like I was stolen from.

6221
03:14:45,920 --> 03:14:46,360
Robbed.

6222
03:14:46,580 --> 03:14:47,020
Skamaged.

6223
03:14:47,880 --> 03:14:48,680
Alright, Pippa.

6224
03:14:48,760 --> 03:14:50,080
I'm not very satisfied with this.

6225
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:50,440
What do we do?

6226
03:14:50,460 --> 03:14:51,260
What do we want to talk about?

6227
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:53,980
What should we talk about?

6228
03:14:55,960 --> 03:14:56,840
What should we talk about?

6229
03:14:56,840 --> 03:14:58,120
How much of a loser Philly is?

6230
03:14:58,380 --> 03:15:00,580
You know, I think Philly is just really bad at board games.

6231
03:15:00,920 --> 03:15:01,900
I think so too.

6232
03:15:02,320 --> 03:15:09,200
I think, you know, like the V-Fuber award is like the only sense of control she can have in her life.

6233
03:15:09,740 --> 03:15:10,480
That's why it's great.

6234
03:15:10,840 --> 03:15:11,280
Wow!

6235
03:15:11,640 --> 03:15:12,080
Wow!

6236
03:15:13,200 --> 03:15:16,900
I think the saddest part is that she organized this collab and she got knocked out first.

6237
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:18,900
That is pretty sad.

6238
03:15:19,060 --> 03:15:19,580
That is pretty sad.

6239
03:15:21,400 --> 03:15:24,720
You know, like if you told me she threw for content, I wouldn't believe you.

6240
03:15:24,760 --> 03:15:26,820
Guys, if you guys want to watch winners...

6241
03:15:27,620 --> 03:15:28,260
No, no, no.

6242
03:15:28,300 --> 03:15:28,860
I have an offering.

6243
03:15:28,960 --> 03:15:29,280
I have an offering.

6244
03:15:29,320 --> 03:15:29,620
I have an offering.

6245
03:15:30,300 --> 03:15:31,820
Alright, check Discord.

6246
03:15:32,420 --> 03:15:32,740
Yeah?

6247
03:15:33,620 --> 03:15:33,940
There.

6248
03:15:34,780 --> 03:15:35,700
What is she...

6249
03:15:35,700 --> 03:15:36,420
The fuck is that?

6250
03:15:36,540 --> 03:15:37,400
What the fuck is that?

6251
03:15:37,840 --> 03:15:38,400
That's a house?

6252
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:39,220
That's my last property.

6253
03:15:40,120 --> 03:15:40,760
Olive blabsh.

6254
03:15:41,700 --> 03:15:42,340
Olive blabsh?

6255
03:15:42,480 --> 03:15:43,140
I know the type word.

6256
03:15:43,220 --> 03:15:44,460
But it's my last property.

6257
03:15:44,520 --> 03:15:46,320
And I just want to say, Doki, you deserve it.

6258
03:15:46,560 --> 03:15:46,880
Okay.

6259
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:49,720
I grew up in this area.

6260
03:15:49,880 --> 03:15:51,280
It was my five nights at Freddy's.

6261
03:15:52,240 --> 03:15:53,240
But I bestowed it to you.

6262
03:15:53,240 --> 03:15:53,420
This is the bit?

6263
03:15:53,940 --> 03:15:55,320
This is what you made us wait for?

6264
03:15:55,580 --> 03:15:56,220
This is it?

6265
03:15:56,960 --> 03:15:57,360
No.

6266
03:15:57,520 --> 03:15:59,640
I feel like I should get paid to even see this.

6267
03:16:02,200 --> 03:16:06,780
I feel like you should pay me to even look at this.

6268
03:16:09,080 --> 03:16:09,900
Time is money, Thelaine.

6269
03:16:09,900 --> 03:16:10,620
I can get mildly offended.

6270
03:16:11,280 --> 03:16:12,700
This is my business venture.

6271
03:16:12,800 --> 03:16:16,100
If you guys put in $5,000 each, I'll give you 1% company, okay?

6272
03:16:16,100 --> 03:16:16,640
To be fair...

6273
03:16:16,640 --> 03:16:19,700
And we've been... This is our exit plan from streaming, man.

6274
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:20,500
Like five years.

6275
03:16:20,660 --> 03:16:21,240
We're old.

6276
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:22,960
And no one gives a fuck anymore.

6277
03:16:23,280 --> 03:16:24,060
What are we gonna have?

6278
03:16:24,420 --> 03:16:25,520
I rather like...

6279
03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:26,700
This is your Amaranth gas station?

6280
03:16:26,860 --> 03:16:27,660
Oh, Brampt.

6281
03:16:28,020 --> 03:16:28,380
Okay.

6282
03:16:28,440 --> 03:16:34,240
To be fair, like after what we saw, how we saw you conduct business, I don't think I want to invest in anything that you offer.

6283
03:16:35,020 --> 03:16:35,380
Okay.

6284
03:16:35,380 --> 03:16:36,260
How about you... Okay.

6285
03:16:36,320 --> 03:16:36,420
Okay.

6286
03:16:36,420 --> 03:16:37,480
Then show my stock, nerd.

6287
03:16:37,580 --> 03:16:38,420
Show my stock, nerd.

6288
03:16:38,480 --> 03:16:38,880
See what happens.

6289
03:16:39,320 --> 03:16:41,840
On the effing GameStop of the effing game chat.

6290
03:16:41,960 --> 03:16:43,580
I just don't like the stock, Thelaine.

6291
03:16:43,620 --> 03:16:44,500
I don't know what to say.

6292
03:16:44,640 --> 03:16:45,520
I just don't want to go.

6293
03:16:45,520 --> 03:16:45,840
Then short me.

6294
03:16:45,920 --> 03:16:47,040
Then short me.

6295
03:16:47,180 --> 03:16:48,380
I just don't like the stock.

6296
03:16:49,100 --> 03:16:49,960
You're no GameStop.

6297
03:16:49,960 --> 03:16:50,120
I'm sorry, Thelaine.

6298
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:55,940
I don't think they'll let you... I don't think they'll allow you to be on the stock market because how...

6299
03:16:56,400 --> 03:16:58,660
We need more than like three steps to go on the stock market.

6300
03:16:58,740 --> 03:17:00,780
And FaZe is not being that, but I am.

6301
03:17:01,960 --> 03:17:04,880
I don't think you're allowed to be on the stock market.

6302
03:17:05,060 --> 03:17:05,880
It's getting...

6303
03:17:05,880 --> 03:17:06,840
I don't think so.

6304
03:17:07,220 --> 03:17:07,660
Okay.

6305
03:17:08,040 --> 03:17:08,480
Okay.

6306
03:17:08,500 --> 03:17:09,120
Here's my plan.

6307
03:17:09,220 --> 03:17:10,700
I walk in with a Glock, right?

6308
03:17:10,760 --> 03:17:11,580
And I say it's fake.

6309
03:17:11,620 --> 03:17:12,380
Alright, hey guys.

6310
03:17:12,500 --> 03:17:12,940
Alright.

6311
03:17:13,200 --> 03:17:14,700
That was a great stream.

6312
03:17:14,800 --> 03:17:15,200
Yeah.

6313
03:17:15,820 --> 03:17:19,340
I had a great time with everyone playing.

6314
03:17:19,740 --> 03:17:24,140
And everybody... I had a great time winning Monopoly, guys.

6315
03:17:25,260 --> 03:17:26,400
I changed my mind.

6316
03:17:26,420 --> 03:17:27,360
I didn't have a great time.

6317
03:17:29,340 --> 03:17:30,740
I was here for a good time.

6318
03:17:30,880 --> 03:17:31,900
Ladies, ladies, you're all beautiful.

6319
03:17:32,240 --> 03:17:32,720
You're all beautiful women.

6320
03:17:32,720 --> 03:17:33,800
Wait, what was the word you just said?

6321
03:17:34,960 --> 03:17:35,880
We're all beautiful?

6322
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:37,220
No, wait.

6323
03:17:37,240 --> 03:17:37,700
What Lumi said.

6324
03:17:38,280 --> 03:17:38,680
Ladies?

6325
03:17:38,980 --> 03:17:40,000
Ladies, nuts on your face.

6326
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:42,080
Shut the fuck up, Fillion.

6327
03:17:42,160 --> 03:17:42,540
Okay.

6328
03:17:42,540 --> 03:17:42,540
Yes.

6329
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:43,520
Fillion.

6330
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:43,920
Fillion.

6331
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:44,980
Fucking sore loser.

6332
03:17:44,980 --> 03:17:45,920
Okay.

6333
03:17:46,060 --> 03:17:47,060
GG's, everybody.

6334
03:17:48,060 --> 03:17:48,560
GG's.

6335
03:17:48,560 --> 03:17:48,620
Good collab, everyone.

6336
03:17:48,960 --> 03:17:49,420
GG.

6337
03:17:49,480 --> 03:17:51,260
It was a great time meeting you guys.

6338
03:17:51,540 --> 03:17:52,120
It was super fun.

6339
03:17:52,140 --> 03:17:54,600
It was a great time meeting you and me and Pippa.

6340
03:17:55,080 --> 03:17:56,520
Yeah, nice meeting you, Dokie.

6341
03:17:56,900 --> 03:17:59,560
And thanks, Fillion, for inviting me.

6342
03:17:59,560 --> 03:18:00,100
I love how toxic you are.

6343
03:18:00,220 --> 03:18:01,580
Thank you so much.

6344
03:18:01,580 --> 03:18:02,240
It's no problem.

6345
03:18:02,680 --> 03:18:03,880
Thank you for voting for us.

6346
03:18:03,880 --> 03:18:04,580
You invited me.

6347
03:18:06,540 --> 03:18:09,860
And thank you to Fillion for setting this collab up.

6348
03:18:10,200 --> 03:18:12,080
At this point, I think she's into this.

6349
03:18:12,120 --> 03:18:14,060
You know, like into the whole...

6350
03:18:14,060 --> 03:18:14,460
Yeah.

6351
03:18:14,460 --> 03:18:16,020
I think she's an M at that point, you know?

6352
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:16,780
She's a huge M.

6353
03:18:16,800 --> 03:18:17,440
Why is it an M?

6354
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:18,160
No, I'm an F.

6355
03:18:18,160 --> 03:18:19,960
She's clearly a huge M.

6356
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:20,560
I'm an F.

6357
03:18:20,680 --> 03:18:24,940
Because she like, you know, she invited all three of us to like just rag on her.

6358
03:18:25,380 --> 03:18:28,440
And like, honestly, she's 100% an M at that point.

6359
03:18:28,600 --> 03:18:28,940
Don't hate toxic people.

6360
03:18:28,960 --> 03:18:29,260
I am an F.

6361
03:18:29,540 --> 03:18:31,220
You asked for this.

6362
03:18:31,540 --> 03:18:32,520
I am a woman.

6363
03:18:33,640 --> 03:18:36,060
Fillion, if you say oink oink, we'll give you the 5,000.

6364
03:18:36,420 --> 03:18:36,780
Oink?

6365
03:18:36,780 --> 03:18:37,180
Wait, what?

6366
03:18:37,320 --> 03:18:37,920
No, I'm waiting.

6367
03:18:37,980 --> 03:18:38,320
So...

6368
03:18:39,160 --> 03:18:41,920
At least she gets 2,500.

6369
03:18:42,500 --> 03:18:43,560
You get half of it.

6370
03:18:43,640 --> 03:18:44,040
Good job.

6371
03:18:44,040 --> 03:18:44,360
Good job.

6372
03:18:44,880 --> 03:18:45,960
Yeah, I just got...

6373
03:18:45,960 --> 03:18:46,760
Give me 50%.

6374
03:18:46,760 --> 03:18:47,340
Idiot.

6375
03:18:47,340 --> 03:18:48,960
Can you do like a pig 3D model?

6376
03:18:49,140 --> 03:18:49,880
Let's play this again.

6377
03:18:49,960 --> 03:18:51,440
If you lose again, can we do like a 3D model?

6378
03:18:51,440 --> 03:18:52,060
Let's do this again.

6379
03:18:52,140 --> 03:18:55,100
If I lose, I'll make it a big maid outfit and then I'll wear it.

6380
03:18:55,420 --> 03:18:57,040
Yeah, but then you want that though.

6381
03:18:57,120 --> 03:18:57,840
You like that.

6382
03:18:57,980 --> 03:18:58,880
That doesn't...

6383
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:01,200
You made it to be embarrassing.

6384
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:03,920
We need it to be something you actually don't want to do.

6385
03:19:05,300 --> 03:19:08,300
Okay, then I don't want to be in a not in a maid outfit.

6386
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:09,000
That's it.

6387
03:19:09,100 --> 03:19:09,440
So there.

6388
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:10,960
I won't wear a maid outfit.

6389
03:19:11,700 --> 03:19:13,080
I won't wear a maid outfit.

6390
03:19:13,380 --> 03:19:13,560
Hey.

6391
03:19:13,680 --> 03:19:14,040
You're a pig.

6392
03:19:14,360 --> 03:19:14,440
You guys.

6393
03:19:14,440 --> 03:19:15,320
GGs everybody.

6394
03:19:16,380 --> 03:19:16,900
GGs.

6395
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:17,640
Whatever.

6396
03:19:17,840 --> 03:19:19,960
I'm going to talk to my chat now.

6397
03:19:20,080 --> 03:19:20,820
I had a great time.

6398
03:19:21,940 --> 03:19:22,880
Bye guys.

6399
03:19:24,100 --> 03:19:24,620
Bye.

6400
03:19:24,740 --> 03:19:25,220
Bye.

6401
03:19:25,300 --> 03:19:25,780
Bye.

6402
03:19:25,780 --> 03:19:26,020
Bye.

6403
03:19:26,120 --> 03:19:26,260
Bye.

6404
03:19:26,260 --> 03:19:26,360
Bye.

6405
03:19:28,400 --> 03:19:33,360
Wow, that stream could have ended like an hour ago if I didn't prolong it for so long.

6406
03:19:37,300 --> 03:19:38,340
Guys sorry.

6407
03:19:38,780 --> 03:19:43,280
I know I have a second stream today but like I just did it.

6408
03:19:43,280 --> 03:19:45,020
I just wanted somebody to lose first.

6409
03:19:49,080 --> 03:19:54,960
Look, I just... I'm just saying, look, I know we could have ended... we could have like let them go from their misery.

6410
03:19:55,200 --> 03:19:58,680
But like I just wanted a specific person to lose first.

6411
03:20:00,420 --> 03:20:03,040
I did not expect to win Monopoly.

6412
03:20:03,220 --> 03:20:03,860
Not gonna lie.

6413
03:20:03,940 --> 03:20:05,260
I haven't played Monopoly in so long.

6414
03:20:05,480 --> 03:20:15,400
But like it's actually pretty funny when I can... I was like, you know, what was that word when you put your foot in the door where you negotiate for something much higher than what you actually want and they actually did that.

6415
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:18,500
Did that and I was like guys that's basic business 101.

6416
03:20:18,880 --> 03:20:19,760
What the fu-

6417
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:30,800
Um, but yeah, it was great.

6418
03:20:30,940 --> 03:20:31,860
I had a great time.

6419
03:20:32,040 --> 03:20:33,360
Um, I had a great time.

6420
03:20:33,420 --> 03:20:35,340
I guess like winning is always a good time.

6421
03:20:35,620 --> 03:20:37,300
So that's why I had-

6422
03:20:41,220 --> 03:20:45,040
I always have a good time winning, you know, it's always a blast.

6423
03:20:46,140 --> 03:20:51,180
Um, but Yeah, um, we do have a second stream.

6424
03:20:51,460 --> 03:20:53,520
We do have a second stream tonight with Fala.

6425
03:20:53,660 --> 03:21:03,560
I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna push the stream, uh up by 15 minutes just so I can like chill a little bit because I didn't realize I'd play like three plus hours of Monopoly.

6426
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:34,780
Also guys, I literally- Okay, it was so funny because like I told- I- I wouldn't be like I told you so because like I- I told them about like yeah, like there's like online issues with Monopoly because I know like people had to- in the past we would have- I remember like peop- like to go get around with it like someone would like screen share or something or like I don't remember- I don't think I've done remote play before but I don't- haven't played Monopoly but I remember like from recounts of others they would like screen share Monopoly and then like um,

6427
03:21:34,960 --> 03:21:39,320
and then like they'll like say what move they want to do and then that'll- they'll do them moves and stuff like that.

6428
03:21:39,460 --> 03:21:42,220
So like I knew there was that option and then there was like remote play.

6429
03:21:42,400 --> 03:21:57,840
So I was like guys, I think we gotta like don't use online feature because there's a huge online issue and I like brought that up like- like two to three- I think like three times and then- and then we went in I was like guys, I told- I told you guys.

6430
03:22:01,360 --> 03:22:06,160
I was like I told you guys there's online issues.

6431
03:22:08,900 --> 03:22:14,480
And I think the funniest part is that Fillion literally forgot the time that she set up.

6432
03:22:14,640 --> 03:22:36,740
Because I was like me, Pippa, and Lumi were watching the stream and then- and then like- like- like we saw her on like Bunny Girl and then we saw her like she was like why are they 30 minutes early like what the is going on like what's wrong with them and then I had to- I copied and pasted the exact time she told us to show up.

6433
03:22:36,880 --> 03:22:38,460
And it was like 2.30pm.

6434
03:22:38,480 --> 03:22:43,940
So me, Pippa, and Lumi were just sitting here waiting and being like guys what- what I thought?

6435
03:22:44,100 --> 03:22:46,340
Guys, are we supposed to start?

6436
03:22:52,060 --> 03:22:55,260
We were like are we supposed to start?

6437
03:22:57,800 --> 03:23:00,100
So we got confused too.

6438
03:23:00,340 --> 03:23:02,480
And we were like did we get the time right?

6439
03:23:05,980 --> 03:23:08,720
And then we just set up as like- As well.

6440
03:23:10,140 --> 03:23:10,700
Uhm.

6441
03:23:12,080 --> 03:23:12,640
Uh.

6442
03:23:13,840 --> 03:23:14,640
But yeah!

6443
03:23:15,560 --> 03:23:18,240
It was a fun time winning the game.

6444
03:23:18,440 --> 03:23:18,880
Anyway guys!

6445
03:23:19,200 --> 03:23:24,700
I'd love to talk more but we do have a second stream so I'll talk more in the second stream chat.

6446
03:23:24,980 --> 03:23:25,360
Uhm.

6447
03:23:25,680 --> 03:23:29,560

6448
03:23:30,100 --> 03:23:30,460

6449
03:23:31,540 --> 03:23:35,620
