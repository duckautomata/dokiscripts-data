1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,620
I'm not lying because I thought we were setting things up

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:18,240
because Monopoly, because Monopoly is one of the most like
unoptimized game because it's Ubisoft.

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,980
Anyway, anyway, Ubisoft, if you want to Ubisoft, if you want
to sponsor me, I won't shit talk Monopoly.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,520
Anyway, but yes, I am.

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:43,200
but like even not play plus is known to be like the most key
the most like fucked up like optimization because this

God dang it.

29
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,680
Yeah, I just see you on your twitch stats right now.

30
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,700
I don't I don't see the monopoly game at all.

31
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,680
Why are you stalking me?

32
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,440
What do you mean?

33
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,600
It's because we were like, we're as Philly and she's out
here being like, the collab starts at three.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,140
I don't know why these girls are here early.

35
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,060
What is she?

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,660
What are they doing?

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,680
And then like, me and Lumi and Pippa were just like, what
the fuck?

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,200
And then I had to copy and paste literally a chat message
from Philly and be like, hey, how does like 230 sound?

39
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,300
Or I'll just like, yeah, 230 sounds great.

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,700
But it's our fault that we came at 230.

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,980
Give me a deeper voice.

42
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:36,700
All right.

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,520
I'm powerful.

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,840
He's like, what are these girls doing coming here like 30
minutes early?

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
What the fuck's wrong with them?

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,380
Okay, we're just like, what the fuck is wrong with her?

47
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,380
Dude, the last time someone came early, I got conceived.

48
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,880
Okay, I'm just not used to it.

49
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,180
Let me, let me, I'm starting the game.

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,680
I'm starting the game.

51
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,220
I'm free, I'm free, free.

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,360
Okay, so I want to leave my lobby code.

53
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700
That's the important thing, right?

54
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,640
I don't think there is a lobby code.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
I think it's just invite.

56
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,020
Private lobby with a code.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,560
Is it private lobby with code?

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:06,920
I don't know.

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,280
I just, like, looked at the hosting.

60
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,920
I know, like, a parent Pip-Bit can't host because she has,
like, issues.

61
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,300
I mean, like, not that type of issues, but, like, the NAT
code.

62
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,880
What do you mean by that, Jokey?

63
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,800
What do you mean by this?

64
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,460
I'm just trying to, like, be specific so people be like,
what kind of issues does she have?

65
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm like, no, I meant tech issues.

66
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,600
I don't mean anything else.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,680
I think I should be able to host two, maybe.

68
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:45,620
what am i leaking oh what okay remote play together are we
actually doing remote play for the remote i don't know

69
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:54,800
someone putting a thing in there what do you think do we do
well like uh yeah that's that's what i'm that's what i said

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:05,120
yesterday i said this yesterday i'm learning it was like
don't worry we can do online and Now you're reading this

71
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,520
week.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,760
I was like, hey guys, people in my chat yesterday were
talking, like, we're talking about we should do like the

73
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,980
remote play.

74
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,740
I'm on Monopoly right now, Kitten.

75
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,880
Give me one sec.

76
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,460
One person buys a game, person who bought the game launches
it and sends a request for a remote play.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
So we should all be Steam friends.

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,420
We should all be Steam friends.

79
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:24,860
Okay.

80
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,740
Everybody drop me on Steam friends.

82
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,880
So I'll be using the chat.

83
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,140

87

So do I draw my friend code in the chat?

I just have to figure out how to get to my friends list a
different way.

133
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
So that's pretty easy, I think.

134
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,280
I can just go to...

135
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,780
Oh, wait.

136
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,840
You can just go in the top and hit Add a friend too.

137
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,120
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.

138
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,540

change my steam It's letting me go anywhere, but the actual

139
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,360

163
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,980
You can look at your scene code.

164
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,920
How?

165
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
I can host it.

166
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,800
I've got it.

167
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
How about I host it?

168
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,680
Okay, fine.

169
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,360
You host it.

170
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,080
Whatever, man.

171
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,040
Okay, okay.

172
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,900
Can I just open a custom game or create game?

173
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,980
Just create a game.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,060
Do a local game.

175
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,960
Local, go to local, create a game.

176
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,800
And then...

177
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,660
I'm getting real poised.

178
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,680

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,180

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,600
You can't come here.

183
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,360
Well, you can't play local.

184
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,940

185
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,300

None of you believe that when I trusted Philly.

205
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,180
None of you.

206
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,640
Why did you trust Philly and over me?

207
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,080
I am trustworthy.

208
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,440
Watch out.

209
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,200

Don't worry, kiddos.

228
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,620
The present they're putting together friends want to play.

229
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,340
Make sure the host enables the keyboard and mouse controls
to the friend.

230
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,340
Oh, okay, okay.

231
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,580
Enable me.

232
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,180
Yeah.

233
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,840
So one person has to use the controller.

234
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,380
I'll plug in the controller.

235
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,440
Okay, okay.

236
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,300
I'll use the keyboard because I'm gonna have to keep my
keyboard.

237
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,560
Okay, I gave you all stuff, but- Pippa, your internet's not
working?

238
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,280

239
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,060
How do you add more people?

240
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,480
How do I add more people?

241
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,860
The game's going to start a token.

242
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,360
Look at the instructions.

243
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,820
Where are the instructions?

244
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,580
The instructions.

245
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,800
Why don't we just play online?

246
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,960
Instructions.

247
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,620
Billion.

248
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:40,760
Okay.

249
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,200
It says make sure the host enables a keyboard and mouse
controls to the friends.

250
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,020
That's what it says.

251
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,380
I gave it.

252
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,340
I gave it.

253
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,660
And then what?

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,700
And then what?

255
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,860
That's what the mask is.

256
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:52,720
Uh.

257
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,120
Oh, that's something that says invite player.

258
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Maybe just like re-invite us.

259
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:06,000

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,460
Let us know in the comments section.

264
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,520
Look at my screen.

265
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:26,900
Back out.

266
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,680
Back out.

267
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,380
Back out again.

268
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,180
Low call.

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,780
So how many VTubers it takes?

270
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,980
Can you just do it for me?

271
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,200
I think the more VTubers you have, the longer it takes.

272
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,660
I'm gonna say that right now.

273
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,060
You have to not do rabbits!

274
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,840
Bro, we should do rabbits mode!

275
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
Do rabbits mode!

276
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,460
Rabbits!

277
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,660
Do it for Pippa!

278
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,880
Bro, we should do rabbit's mode.

279
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,440
Oh, bad.

280
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,560
Is that rabbits?

281
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,900
Is that rabbits mode?

282
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,620
Now, can you join?

283
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,800
I picked rabbits mode.

284
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,060
This is local, right?

285
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,680
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,060
Did you enable keyboard for us?

287
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,020
Yeah, did you enable?

288
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,680
Let me check.

289
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,760
Can you enable us?

290
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,860
I fucking enabled you.

291
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,260
I'm taking it away from you right now.

292
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,200
I see you.

293
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,800
I see you use that, too.

294
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,240
Give me my rights.

295
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,960
I gave you your rights.

296
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,160
You don't deserve any women.

297
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,140
Like, what?

298
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,700
I'm on!

299
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,240
Okay.

300
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,520
Alright, so how do we...

301
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,480
Okay, so your guy who gave you your instructions, how do we
make a new person?

302
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,400
He just says...

303
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,080
Oh, I got one!

304
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,060
One person buys a game.

305
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,320
Oh, my God.

306
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,480
Oh, my God.

307
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,520
Someone's getting that one.

308
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,380
Okay, okay.

309
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,260
And then...

310
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,220
Then, Lumi, add two more.

311
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,220
Add two more, Lumi, add two more.

312
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,500
One of them has to be controller.

313
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,160
Yes!

314
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay, we got this.

315
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,180
How do we swap the controller?

316
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,920
How do we swap that?

317
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,780
One of them has to be on controller.

318
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,660
Pick something!

319
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,780
That's not me!

320
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,220
Wait, am I controlling this?

321
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,140
Oh, this is me!

322
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,920
I'm player three!

323
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,940
I'm player three!

324
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,980
Who wears me?

325
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,560
You have a place, nerd.

326
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,780
Wait, is Pippa in here?

327
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,600
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta select your thing.

328
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,840
Oh, you turned me into an AI!

329
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,140
You effing NPC applied me!

330
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,680
Wait, how do we turn?

331
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,820
Well, the AI will do more work than the original, so I- No,
that's not true.

332
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,180
I'm wearing a weapon world of worship.

333
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
The AI will definitely win the game.

334
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,120
Okay.

335
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,460
Lumi, you're the top hat.

336
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,200
Is anyone getting game sound from this?

337
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,160
Because I'm not.

338
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,540
I have game sound.

339
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,080
I have- I don't- I don't hear anything in the game.

340
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,680
I don't hear game sound either.

341
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,480
Yeah.

342
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,320

Did you turn yourself down, Lumi?

423
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,560
What is this human doing?

424
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:33,800
Lumi, you accidentally turned yourself down instead of the
rest of the game.

425
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,940
Lumi, you sound like I said.

426
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,300
This is Sparta, and then I kicked you down an effing hole.

427
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,810
You already did that in whatever shit.

428
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,770
Sorry, I don't take notes from like midgets, okay?

429
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,330

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,170
You sound like Archer, do you want a good day?

433
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,430
Oh, oh, oh, oh, at least I have a brain unlike you.

434
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,210
You know what's funny is that I can barely hear Loomy's
insults back.

435
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,050
So I know.

436
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:58,610
Me too.

437
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,010
I thought I might listen to alien signals from Mars.

438
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,250
Like, it's like hearing somebody fight back like 200 miles
away.

439
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,010
I know.

440
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,630
I'm playing Ender's game and she's the aliens.

441
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,850
Like, she's like on the moon just shouting back at you.

442
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,790
All right, Lance Armstrong, chill out, bro.

443
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,890
We know you faked it.

444
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,990
Can we just, is it good?

445
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,930
Can we just do this?

446
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,030
Can we just, is it good?

447
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,370
Bro, you know, you're so quiet.

448
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,810
Your volume is still low, nerd?

449
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:24,450
What the fuck?

450
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,410
You're like 50% of what your original volume was.

451
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:28,690
This isn't my fault, Chad.

452
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,950
No, Phelan, this is 100% your fault.

453
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,590
Can we be, is this good?

454
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,570
Can we just go with this?

455
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,390
Hey, guys, maybe we should test this out before we stream.

456
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,370
Can we just go like this?

457
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,130
Is it good?

458
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,270
Is it better now?

459
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,590
Nobody believed me.

460
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,050
I did what I did.

461
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,870
No, you're still like 50% quieter.

462
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,990
I don't know what you did but you just turn it on discord
now We'll just have to fix it.

463
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,750
I literally turn it up to where it was Good her volume's
good or go.

464
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,630
I literally turned it up to where I was.

465
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,770
This is bullshit Okay, we're good.

466
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,190
We're good.

467
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:04,310
Fuck it.

468
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,030
Fuck this.

469
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,550
Fuck this.

470
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:05,730
All right.

471
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,310
We're good.

472
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:06,490
We're good.

473
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,190
Let's go.

474
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:15,130
Let's go Let's go roll the dice roll the dice.

475

Yeah

477
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,110
All right, am I the dog?

478
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,650
I think so?

479
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,650
Am I the dog?

480
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,410
No, I am not.

481
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,250
It's somebody else.

482
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,870
I can do whatever you want to be.

483
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:32,670
You whatever you want to be because this is remote play and
everyone's playing on one computer.

484
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,190
Okay, never mind.

485
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,270

You're the king.

I got five.

491
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,410
My controller buzzes every time.

492
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,790
Okay, there's the rabbit.

493
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,610
I'm the bear.

494
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,770
No, Pippa's the rabbit.

495
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,230
Pippa's.

496
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,790
I'm the bear.

497
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,250
Wait, Pippa's the rabbit.

498
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,190
Pippa, be the rabbit.

499
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,810

500
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:51,790
Okay, hold on.

501
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:52,590
Okay.

I'm, I'm like ending my stream because my like connection is
dying.

503
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,470
Oh, oh shit.

504
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,570
Did you roll the die for yourself or did somebody else saw
it?

505
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,770
I didn't roll it.

506
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,390
It wasn't me.

507
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:05,950
It wasn't touching.

508
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,230
Okay.

509
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,750
Now it's my turn.

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,650
You rolled a nine.

511
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,170
I'm going to bomb you.

512
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,230
Why are you getting so defensive?

513
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,210
Shut the fuck up.

514
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,370

Today we're going to figure out how difficult it is Monopoly
really and we're in a future Donkey Bird.

571
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,500
What do you think about Monopoly so far?

574
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,900
Especially on remote play.

575
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,940
It seems pretty fun.

576
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,560

00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,560
Okay, it's my turn.

696
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,600
Please give me a double.

697
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,760
Please give me a double.

698
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,120
Land on my property, coward.

699
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,580
You won't.

700
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,540
Shut up.

701
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,260
I would rather go to jail.

702
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,340
I like trains.

703
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,340
I'm going to jail.

704
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:37,920
No!

705
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,240
No!

706
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:39,780
No!

707
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,000
You haven't done the crime yet, or you haven't got caught.

708
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,400
Oh my god.

709
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,420
Tax evasion does fail.

710
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,000
You haven't got caught yet.

711
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,920
You're so lucky.

712
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,340
Is that the end of my turn?

713
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah, that is.

714
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,900
Just go end turn.

715
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,720
I think so.

716
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Just press enter for me.

717
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,340
Fine.

718
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,000
Okay, I'll press end for you.

719
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,240
It's your turn.

720
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,100
Dude, I have nothing.

721
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,460
Oh, don't you think you can control other people's boards
again.

722
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,600
I have nothing going for me.

723
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,700
Oh, I've got the pass.

724
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,520
Free parking.

725
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,700
Free parking.

726
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
You just won $5.

727
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,900
Dude, that's $20 in some places.

728
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,060
Parking is expensive.

729
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,520
Yeah.

730
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,920
You guys want to eat anything, by the way?

731
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,520
Ooh.

732
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,080
Who's that?

733
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,260
Well, you guys are all landing on properties.

734
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,020
That's unfair.

735
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

736
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,020
Tell me about it.

737
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,640
I own a singular blue property.

738
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,560
That's called karma.

739
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,540
We don't control other people's boards.

740
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,420
Does anyone want to, like, auction their property off?

741
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,200
No, no, no.

742
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,440
Yes, yes, yes.

743
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,680
I would like to auction their property off.

744
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,680
I would like to auction jail.

745
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,480
It's a government property.

746
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,620
I'll steal it.

747
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,540
You want to auction it off?

748
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,020
Let me...

749
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,780
No, no, no, no.

750
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,060
I'm good.

751
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,440
I'm good.

752
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,000
Why?

753
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm good.

754
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:46,960
I'm good.

755
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,380
It's good.

756
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,100
I'm literally behind you guys, and I get to auction
literally nothing.

757
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:51,860
Buy nothing.

758
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm going to land on someone's property.

759
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,500
I'm going to roll my head in.

760
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,140
You're going to commit a tax fraud.

761
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,160
I didn't commit tax fraud.

762
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,500
I just really have one property.

763
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,080
No, I visited EVP.

764
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,040
He said it was a really good cupcake.

765
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,380
I don't know what you want from me.

766
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,060
Here.

767
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,100
Let me roll.

768
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,920
I just killed myself.

769
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,820
I got a double.

770
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,800
Okay, we're still back.

771
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,320
All right.

772
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,720
Nice.

773
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,560
Wait, is this really good?

774
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,320
Yeah, yeah, this is electric company.

775
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,460
You own electricity.

776
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,620
Oh.

777
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,520
Chat.

778
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,460
I'm now on a watcher type Pokemon.

779
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,500
Thumbnail!

780
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,440
Oh, no.

781
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,580
Now we have to pay Thalian for...

782
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,440
Lumi, turn up your SFX.

783
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,440
Yeah, pay me every time Pippa's internet crashes.

784
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,640
Frank, pull me Comcast.

785
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,440
I fucking hate Comcast.

786
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,880
I'm going to Fiber.

787
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,500
I'm moving and I'm getting Fiber.

788
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,180
Yeah, Fiber is pretty fucking nice.

789
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,660
Lumi, Lumi, look at my eyes.

790
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,500
Turn up the SFX volume in chat, please.

791
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:46,980
Ouch.

792
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,020
He wants to hear the- Why is only five, dude?

793
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,520
Because it's fucking loud!

794
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,200
It's not music.

795
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,560
It's not loud at all!

796
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,340
I don't understand!

797
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,420
Like, I think- It's so loud!

798
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,760
You don't need these sounds!

799
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,400
Okay, we don't need 25.

800
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,480
I don't- Why is the system louder than- Do you like trains,
yes or no?

801
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,880
Like, just- Do you like trains, yes or no?

802
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,420
I think of your goddamn mind!

803
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,440
No, I was acoustic.

804
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,740
Okay, fine, I'll roll again.

805
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,820
Roll your dice.

806
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,580
You gotta sneak- Please, roll- roll- I'm dead again.

Wait, does anyone own this?

811
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,540
I don't think so.

812
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,880

Why am I on the gulag?

902
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,740
I literally rolled a double.

903
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,780
It doesn't make me invincible.

904
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,600

905
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,180
Why?

906
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,540
It's because you rolled a double.

907
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,820
That means that, yeah, that was illegal.

908
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,260
You just did an illegal thing.

909
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,480

and bathtubs.

922
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,940

00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,020
I told you, you should have paid a 50.

1050
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,400
Nobody listens to me.

1051
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,560
Like how nobody listens to me about Monopoly.

1052
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,980
We can't have any fun doing this stream.

1053
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:26,480

1054
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:26,940
Okay.

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,040
Dude, this is so stupid, man.

1091
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,780
Hey, I've got two of your doubles, Villion.

1092
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,980
Maybe you should have paid 50 fucking dollars.

1093
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,200
Why did I get skipped, though?

1094
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,280
Why did I get skipped?

1095
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,380
This is madness.

1096
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,700
This is gonna be new if you paid your fucking money.

1097
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,140
Wait, but I didn't, like, why did I get to roll again?

1098
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,400
No, you didn't.

1099
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,600
You only got to roll one.

1100
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh, you owed money.

1101
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,480
You're so good to the homeless people.

1102
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,580
Cat girl losing to a little tomato.

1103
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,820
Look, she's giving you another bail option.

1104
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,260
Who is doing this now?

1105
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,520
I'm not giving you my profit.

1106
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,720
Okay, come on Phyllian.

1107
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,060
Sorry.

1108
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,600
I love my women too much.

1109
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,240
Calm down.

1110
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:23,360
What?

1111
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,660
Take it back.

1112
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,820
Dude, I'm not gonna give you my money or my property.

1113
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:28,620
I need that.

1114
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,360
I'm not asking for your money.

1115
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,580
You're never gonna play Phyllian if you do.

1116
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,720
I know that property is worth that much.

1117
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,500
That's a good deal Phyllian.

1118
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,140
No, I know it's worth that much.

1119
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,000
I don't want this.

1120
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:41,920
I'm not interested.

1121
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,080
That's a good deal.

1122
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,240
I know what I'm scared.

1123
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:44,960
I know what I'm worth.

1124
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:45,860
Yeah, I'm not what I'm worth.

1125
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,560
Out of commitment?

1126
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,600
I'm not sure.

1127
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,520
She's literally in jail.

1128
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,520
She's scared of everything right now.

1129
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,920
Like, I don't know what's going on in jail, but I'm pretty
sure.

1130
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,140
Changes the person.

1131
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,120
She just needs more time in jail to finally get desperate.

1132
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,760
Look, everybody's getting doubles except for you, Phyllian.

1133
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,300
You're super sizing your menu?

1134
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,650
Oh, nice.

1135
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:18,990
Oh, shit.

1136
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,170
I'm going to jail a little double and get bored.

1137
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,190
No more men.

1138
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,670
Oh, there's still the green the greens are all right.

1139
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,930
Here's another chance or you could pay $50 Shut up.

1140
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,370
Okay, fine.

1141
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,890
Welcome back.

1142
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,070
Welcome back.

1143
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,050
How's it?

1144
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,230
You're a millionaire committing a crime.

1145
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:42,870
All right.

1146
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:44,630
Did you enjoy the spam?

1147
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:45,550
Yeah.

1148
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,090
Oh, my blood hurts.

1149
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,150
See you weren't gonna get double anyway

1150
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,270
It would be funny if she goes to the jail again.

1151
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,030
You tell me, you tell me.

1152
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,830
If she goes to jail, I'm gonna uninstall.

1153
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,190
Hey, you got $25.

1154
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:04,610
Consultancy fee.

00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:05,710
Yeah, you got it.

1156
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,250
They catered me for advice.

1157
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:08,850
Who?

1158
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:09,550
Who's they?

1159
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,070
Because they're not taking money from us.

1160
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:12,850
Who's they?

1161
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:15,590
My viewers donated five subs.

1162
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,010
What?

1163
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,090
Who is this?

1164
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,570
25 subs to get Philly and out of jail.

1165
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:23,850
Does no one own this?

1166
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,830

Don't pick me!

1225
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,350
She's disestablishmentarian.

1226
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,770
I believe in the government, or I don't, depending on what
you like.

1227
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,830
I need my green monopoly, Pippa!

1228
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,450
Yeah, she can have her green monopoly.

1229
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,170
I can have my red monopoly.

1230
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,590
Everybody is happy.

Everybody's happy.

1232
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:39,450
If you trade away your red, she'll never get the green
monopoly, and don't you want her to be happy?

1233
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,390

Get on the property.

I'm not about to spend the next two hours screaming over
being broke.

1283
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,980
Oh, hey, thank you again for the water.

You're welcome.

Put the shotgun.

1291
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,560
In the shower.

1292
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,120
In the shower.

1293
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,460
There's your water bills, bitch.

1294
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,460
I'll take the water that I paid 15 bucks for and give it
back to you.

1295
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,840
And then I'll ask for a refund.

1296
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,340
Now I can see why Phelion went to jail, guys.

1297
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:49,060
Why?

1298
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,480
She's a dangerous axe murderer.

1299
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,840
I went to jail because I paid back my crime.

1300
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,900
She's a danger to society.

1301
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,140
I'm not.

1302
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,760
It deserves to be locked up, man.

1303
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,400
I need to wear shoes, man.

1304
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,580
Ooh, doubles.

Does anyone own that?

Just so you guys know, I have more money than all of you.

1310

01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:31,980

01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:32,600
You're the hat.

01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,460

What's she going to do with it besides pay her monopolies?

1426
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:25,820
You're getting scammed.

1427
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,900

I'll give you 201 dollars.

1431
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:39,680
When she goes on an egomaniacal rampage because she has the
monopoly, she'll probably just trip on her treadmill again

1432
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:39,780
and fall.

1433
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,660
There's three blue squares.

1434
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,700
I'm only going to own two.

1435
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,020
Are you guys done?

1436
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,000
On her fucking treadmill again.

1437
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,020
Okay.

1438
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:46,880
I want 250.

1439
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,520
for that joke.

1440
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,500
No, motherfuckers!

1441
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,720
See, I told you!

1442
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,680
I told you, Lumi!

1443
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,420
She's just getting five more!

1444
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,980
And then asking and asking and asking and asking and asking!

1445
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:57,380
No!

1446
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,640
Not interested!

1447
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,280
Not interested!

1448
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,320
No, fuck you!

1449
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,220
She needs to be put in her place!

1450
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,160
That's fine.

1451
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:06,680
No, that's cool.

1452
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:07,460
That's cool.

1453
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,240
Half of a hot dog?

1454
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,720
Half of a hot dog?

1455
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,880
She's a lost cause!

1456
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,680
You can't keep stupid!

1457
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,560
I'm gonna roll one right now.

1458
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,220
Check this out.

1459
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,360
Alright, do it.

1460
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,480
Oh wait, I'll roll one like.

1461
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,740
Nice roll.

1462
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:18,860
Nice roll.

1463
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,220
All right, my turn.

1464
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,680
I'm so fucking scared every time Doki rolls the dice.

1465
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,340
Why are you guys scared?

1466
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,720
She's got everything.

1467
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:29,520
Oh, no.

1468
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:30,920
Who's this?

1469
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,120
It's Pippa.

1470
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,640
Holy shit.

1471
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,240
Now I'm scared.

1472
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,160
Fuck.

1473
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,220
I don't like this Pippa Monopoly.

1474
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,240
Pippa has a monopoly now.

1475
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,640
She's getting rich.

1476
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,720
She was the secret.

1477
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,240
You could have prevented this.

1478
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,620
This is all your fault, Phyllian.

1479
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,060
She was the secret business mom, girl.

1480
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:52,820
It's all your fault.

1481
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,020
This was Phyllian's fault, yeah.

1482
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,340
Why am I an epic McDonald's employee, dude?

1483
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,080
What are these rules, dude?

1484
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,320
What?

1485
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,400
And she gets 150?

1486
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:06,940
She was the hidden.

1487
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,280
The capillism is so fucking strong today.

1488
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:11,900
Don't like this.

1489
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,060
Wait, can I manage my properties?

1490
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,280
I manage my properties.

1491
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,580
I should have managed my properties too.

1492
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,680
Oh my god, it's so much money.

1493
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,080
Sure.

1494
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:24,980
Wait, how do I do it?

1495
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:25,620
It's shift?

1496
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:26,780
Yeah.

1497
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,880
Oh my god, it's so fucking expensive!

1498
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:29,820
It is.

1499
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:30,840
Jesus.

1500
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,200
Okay, I'm just gonna play.

1501
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,720
Because I still got properties to buy.

1502
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:37,500
Right?

1503
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:38,340
Fuck.

1504
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:39,340
Seven.

1505
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,040
Where's seven?

1506
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,260
Oh, yeah, it was a dragon.

1507
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:43,300
Oh, it's fine.

1508
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:43,840
It's fine.

1509
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,600
Someone should hurry and own the Humble, you know, keep me
humble.

1510
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,160
That's all.

1511
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,100
That's all Keep me humble.

1512
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:51,620
Keep you humble.

1513
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,440
You can sit higher and lower those in there with me.

1514
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,960
Yeah, we'll buy another property.

1515
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,460
You're gonna be broke.

1516
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,800
You're gonna be broke soon, Lumi.

1517
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:02,820
That should be fine.

1518
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,420
It should be fine.

1519
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,660
Oh my god, how do I do this?

1520
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:05,920
What are you doing?

1521
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:06,760
You go back, back.

1522
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:07,800
Yeah.

1523
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,760
Hit bait for quantum reasons.

1524
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:11,300
Enter, enter.

1525
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,160
Okay, we're good.

1526
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,560
My turn, my turn.

1527
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,760
I'm gonna roll one.

1528
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,680
You can't, you literally can't.

1529
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,360
He can't even roll a one.

1530
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,720
You got doubles though?

1531
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:20,700
I'm all my way!

1532
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,520

1539
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,800
Wow, what a turn, Billy?

1540
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,240

Just please, please.

1544
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,680
When was the last time?

Hey, look.

1552
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,900
You can't land on a railroad.

1553
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,140
You can't get one.

I'll put...

1569
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,900
What about like a phillian thing?

1570
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,280
Yeah, you're not included.

1571
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,200
You're not included.

1572
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,240
You were in jail.

1573
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,360
I'm about to go to the basket.

1574
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,100
Guys, there's a potential where I might go bankrupt.

1575
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,820
You can tell me this game is based on skill.

1576
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:04,980
It's on skill.

1577
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:05,720
It's all skill.

1578
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,840
It's all about investing.

1579
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:07,380
It's not.

1580
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:07,760
It's not.

1581
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,020
You would understand if you went to school.

1582
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:10,920
Okay, Lumi.

1583
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:11,520
Lumi.

01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,800

Yeah, yeah, let's do the trade.

1586
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,720
Okay, we'll do the trade on the next turn.

1587
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,540
You give me the orange, I give you the blue.

1588
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,020
Okay.

1589
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,640

We'll do it.

1591
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:23,500
We'll do it.

1592
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:23,860
All right.

1593
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,800
Oh my god, Pippa's all in on her monopoly.

1594
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,780
That's fucking scary.

1595
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:28,600
I don't like that.

1596
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,980
Yeah, she has a, she has a scary monopoly right now.

1597
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:32,260

01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,080
Good job.

1599
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,520
Where is she going?

1600
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:37,260
Where is she going?

1601
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:38,600
Oh!

1602
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:39,860
God damn it.

1603
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,980
What comes around, goes around.

1604
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:41,340
Shit!

1605
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,020
Oh wow!

1606
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,320
Oh!

1607
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,740
You get it!

1608
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,580
What is happening?

1609
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,700
You can't enjoy it, bro!

1610
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,220
Too much!

1611
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,360
That's what you get.

1612
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:56,520
What do you want?

1613
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,280

She is so desperate for property.

1633
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,580
You can literally ask for more money.

1634
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,420
She's so desperate for her.

1635
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,920
You know she wants a property.

1636
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,340
She's so fucking desperate.

1637
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:32,980

You know she'll say yes if you ask for more money.

01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,020

Railroads aren't even a monopoly.

1652
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,220
You can't monopolize railroads.

1653
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,560
This country was built on railroads, Doki.

1654
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:32,560
This country was built on the backbone of our whole society.

1655

1674
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,920

01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:39,500
Oh, that's me?

1747
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,380
That's the one I put a house on!

1748
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,900
All I'm saying, Kipa, is you allied with the wrong person.

1749
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,800
Chad, are we cooked?

1750
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,360
Chad, are we cooked?

1751
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,100
Shit, we're fucked in this game.

1752
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,720
She's the only one with the house, too.

1753
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,560
She's rich in the me and I own zero property.

1754
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:01,260

01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,060
I'm actually gonna blow up this fucking chain.

1759
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,780
Oh my god, I was broke and now I'm rich.

01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,640

1771
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:51,560
It's over.

1772
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:52,500
It's over.

1773
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,040
It's over.

1774
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:53,600

01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:54,720

1776
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:55,340

1777
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:55,680
It's over.

1778
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,180
Oh, my God.

1779
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,320
Bipa, look, you got saved from bankruptcy.

1780
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,300
He's good at all he's good.

1781
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,020
Welcome back.

1782
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:06,660
Thank you, Phelan.

1783
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,140
Welcome back.

1784
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,260
Phelan, would you like to make a deal?

1785
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:21,260
I don't think Philean is okay.

1786
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:22,440
I think she's like...

1787
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,000
I think she regrets suggesting Monopoly as her collab game.

1788
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,240
You know, I think like...

1789
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,040
Is that her neck breaking?

1790
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,080
I think it's great that Philean is like our piggy bank.

1791
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:36,800
You know?

1792
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:37,220
Like...

1793
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:37,500
Yeah!

1794
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,380
She's like a lone shark, but without the muscle.

1795
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,280
Yeah, yeah.

1796
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,440
So, like, she's not a shark.

1797
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,160
She's like a...

1798
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,040
She's like a...

1799
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,860
She's like a lone ant.

1800
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:50,280
Three doubles, Phyllian?

1801
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,600
No, she got...

1802
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,900
She was lucky and got out of jail.

1803
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,260
What's that over there?

1804
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,020
What's over there?

1805
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,640
No, she just missed it.

1806
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:03,160
Oh, you know, if you hit that railroad, you could have cut
me from camping the last railroad.

1807
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,400
Yeah.

1808
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,360
You were the chosen one, Phyllian.

1809
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:10,160
You could have stopped me from a monopoly on the trains.

1810
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,560
Why'd you pass that up?

1811
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:14,000
Someone present her.

1812
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:14,920
Why can't you advance?

1813
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,160
Oh, she got bored.

1814
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,380
She can't afford boardwalk.

1815
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,780
Because she's cheating on boardwalk.

1816
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,800
With what money?

1817
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,700
Money is for me.

1818
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,520
This is crazy.

1819
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,440
This is crazy.

1820
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:28,880
This is crazy.

1821
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:31,240
This is crazy.

1822
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,940
I spent my entire life shooting her boardwalk.

1823
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,560
You can't even afford it.

1824
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,500
Well, it's time for the auction.

1825
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:41,340
Survival in the Pippa with the Pippa.

1826
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,280
I'm gonna win this.

1827
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,320
Wait, wait, okay, I'll bid, I'll bid, I'll bid.

1828
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,460
You can only bid like...

1829
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,320
You can't even afford it!

1830
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,390
I think I'll...

1831
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,010
You had no money!

1832
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:05,410
Please, please, please, I'll do anything, please!

1833
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:06,290
You don't have to play game right now!

1834
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:07,110
Just withdraw!

1835
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,610
You can't afford it!

1836
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,890
Let me play, bro!

1837
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,190
Let me play, bro!

1838
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:14,930
What is this?

1839
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,270
That's good.

1840
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:27,640
I did the million.

1841
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,160
This is your fault.

1842
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,040
Philly and thanks for giving me boardwalk.

1843
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,540
I really appreciate it Philly.

1844
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,200
I think I didn't discount.

1845
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,420
This is absolutely your fault, Philly.

1846
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:43,300
I told you guys to not ally with her.

1847
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,420
I told you guys.

1848
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,520
I'm like, DJ Kyle.

1849
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:46,940
Nobody believed me.

1850
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,300
I said like it's not.

1851
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:49,080
We shouldn't.

1852
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,800
We shouldn't alliance with her.

1853
01:16:50,940 --> 01:17:00,480

You're just so bad.

1858

This game has not even luck.

1859
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:26,420
Who's this?

1860
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,260
Oh, Philly, you can sell your property to Doki.

1861
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,100
Yo, guys!

1862

I'll buy that!

1863
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,780
Oh, my fucking god.

1864
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,660
Sell it to Doki for some money.

1865
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,860
Yeah, Philly, you want to sell me this property, Philly?

1866
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,760
Pull yourself up by your book.

1867
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,160
Yeah, yeah.

1868
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,580
You want to sell that property?

1869
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:42,880
I'll buy that property.

1870
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:46,300
No, I'm going to pass Gok like $200 and I'll build a kingdom
with it.

1871
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:46,720
All right.

1872
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,340
All right.

1873
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,200
Sure.

1874
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,700
I can start from nothing.

1875
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:54,100
All I'm saying is Philean's been coping for a very long
time.

1876
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,360
Okay, yeah, I like drugs.

1877
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:55,980
What about it?

1878
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:56,720
Good for your sanity.

1879
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:57,640
You guys like vultures.

1880
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,380
You're after you can prank on my grave or you're going to
steal whatever's left of me for as cheap as you can get it.

1881
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,460
You guys are cursing!

1882
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,460
Oh my god, we should not land more Pippa.

1883
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,760
We should not land on any of Pippa's spot.

1884
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,040
You're fucking dead if you do.

1885
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:16,060
I'm saying, Philean, if you land on Pippa Square, I think
you actually have to declare bankruptcy.

1886
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:17,780
Thank God.

1887
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,540
Thank you, people.

1888
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:20,620
Thank you.

1889
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,680
Thank you.

1890
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:23,840
Yay.

1891
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,740
I can get out of jail now.

1892
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,180
I know you're poor.

1893
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,320
You needed it.

1894
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:28,600
Yeah, yeah.

1895
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:29,020
Whoa.

1896
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:31,260
Yeah.

1897
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,420
I've been on top times.

1898
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:34,920
Double.

1899
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,140
Is that my square?

1900
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,480
Does that mean you land on Norwalk?

1901
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:37,840
No.

1902
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,180
Oh, you just missed it.

1903
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,580
Oh, you're next to me.

1904
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,560
Oh, shit.

You're brilliant.

1909
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,080

Don't be upset.

1925
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,540

What do you mean?

1972
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:20,700
Just withdraw.

1973
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,180
She automatically owns it.

1974
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,320
Eddie, no, I mock you.

1975
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,560
You know I mock you.

1976
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:29,260
There's been a hundred and you literally get her out.

1977
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:31,720
I mock you.

1978
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,660
Hold on.

1979
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,220
You don't even have money.

1980
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:35,020

01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,340

Goodbye, Killian.

01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:40,520
It's over.

1986
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,700
Nah, fuck off.

1987
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,860
Your partner's put $115.

1988
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,360
Look, Pippa, you're going to get bankrupt again.

1989
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,340
Was the message really worth it, Pippa?

1990
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,160
I'd like live it on the edge.

1991
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,340
There she has the last railroad I need.

1992
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,000
She knows she has a card.

1993
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:03,080
You wasted an epic GameStop triple-A title worth of money.

1994
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:06,240
She just has to be lucky and not land on anything.

1995
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,100
Or she's fucked.

1996
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:07,500
It's okay.

1997
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:07,740
It's okay.

1998
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,800
Chat, watch this boardwalk.

Nine?

2002
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:19,780
Is that good?

2003
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,140
Is this the third blue?

2004
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:22,700
Oh!

2005
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:23,580

2006
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:25,800
She got her monopoly!

2007
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,860
Oh my god!

2008
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,120
She owns it a monopoly now!

2009
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,120
Oh my god!

2010
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,800
You fucking made it!

2011
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:34,760
Is this real?

2012
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,840
She actually made it!

2013
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,840
Wait, how do I read this?

2014
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:39,820
Use something to build?

2015
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,580
Alright, now what?

2016
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:43,580
Run with color set?

2017
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:44,320
Can I buy a house?

2018
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,360
Yeah, you can.

2019
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,280
Yeah, buy all the houses.

2020
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,840
You press enter.

2021
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,900
There, I go.

2022
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:54,640
Press buttons.

2023
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:55,280
Press buttons.

2024
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,240
If you get any bankrupt, it's fine.

2025
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:58,500
Oh, healing?

2026
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,080
How do I...

2027
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,300
How do I...

2028
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:02,380
Here?

2029
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,240
Let's go, dude!

2030
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:04,580
Okay.

2031
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,080
There she did it.

2032
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:08,360
Now it said of $12.

2033
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,420
Now it says $6.

2034
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:11,620
We pay $12, guys.

2035
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,160
That's right.

2036
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:12,700
That's right.

2037
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:13,820
That's right.

2038
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,200
That's right.

2039
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:14,300
That's right.

2040
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,140
I have a house chat.

2041
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,120
I own two houses.

2042
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:17,920
I'm like Drake.

2043
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:19,240
They're mansions.

2044
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,660
Who is this?

2045
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,120
Is this my- It's my railroad!

2046
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:25,300
I'm safe!

2047
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,840
First person gets me 100 bucks with a party at my place.

2048
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,960
Oh my gosh, put it on Pippa Spa.

2049
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,460
This is over for me.

2050
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:34,620
I better not roll bad.

2051
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,680
It's fucking over.

2052
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,420
Yep.

2053
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:39,780
We're six.

2054
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:39,960
We're six.

2055
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,440
Uh-oh.

2056
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,360
Oh, that's... Wait, that's... Is that Philly in spot?

2057
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,200
It is!

2058
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,960
Wait, her luck's turning around!

2059
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,440
Oh my god, Philly in!

2060
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,380
Her luck is finally turning around!

2061
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,640
Wait, wait, wait, that's not my luck.

2062
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,620
Oh, you can't afford it!

2063
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:54,420
Oh my god, Pippa, baby!

2064
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:55,520
I give you $8!

2065
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:58,420
Pippa, I can trade with you, Pippa.

2066
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,020
I can bail you out.

2067
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,540
I can bail you out the exact money you need.

2068
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,400
We'll bail you out.

2069
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:04,500
We'll bail you out.

2070
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:05,280
Wait, no, wait, wait, wait.

2071
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,460
Pippa, Pippa, Pippa, Pippa, Pippa.

2072
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,100
No, Pippa, I'll give you the money back for free.

2073
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,020
You have to go, no, please, what are you doing?

2074
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,480
Sister, my sister in Christ.

2075
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,600
I will give you the money.

2076
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,060
You can kill the $24.

2077
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,120
You can kill the $24.

2078
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:23,620
Just don't do it, bro.

2079
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,900
You can kill the $24.

2080
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,440
This is fun, man.

2081
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,360
You've doomed us all.

2082

I'm in your stream.

2083
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:34,880
You've doomed us all.

2084
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,100
She got her bell.

01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:46,900
All I'm saying is, You requested too much from her Philly

I'm hitting the oven candy chest.

2102
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:21,160
What are you getting?

2103
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,320
All right, student loans.

2104
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:22,920
Student loans.

2105
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,100
Give me student loans.

2106
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,300
Damn, you get $50.

2107
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,980
I bought Amazon.

2108
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:30,480
What?

2109
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,000
For 50?

2110
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,300
You bought one stock from Amazon.

2111
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,380
I bought a single share in Amazon.

2112
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,080
The one stock.

2113
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,320
This is where I die from.

2114
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,080
Lock in, boys.

2115
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,660
Okay, I don't die from Pippa.

2116
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:45,200
Look at the barn.

2117
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,260
I'm silent and deadly.

2118
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:46,840
Who's this?

2119
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:47,720
Okay, fucking money.

2120
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,480
Thank God.

2121
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,100
Oh, shit.

2122
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:50,840
It's looming.

2123
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,460
No, I own money.

2124
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:53,440
Oh, man.

2125
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,240
Oh, man.

2126
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:54,360
All right.

2127
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,340
Doki.

2128
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:55,840
Looming.

2129
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,560
Doki, what do you have?

2130
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,120
I'm the richest person here.

2131
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:01,300
Or no, you're not.

2132
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:01,880
It's looming.

2133
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,080
How much do you owe again?

2134
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:05,560
130?

2135
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,400
Uh, I owe 130.

2136
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,580

2161
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,020

What is she having?

2165
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,240
She's just getting money.

2166
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:45,840
I don't have.

2167
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,640
What does she have that I don't have?

2168
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:48,860
What does she have that I don't have?

2169
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,320
I think you gotta be blonde, man.

2170
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,480
Try and try dying your hair or something.

2171
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,880
You demand too much, Phyllian.

2172
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:55,020
That's the problem.

2173
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:59,220
I told you to keep it $24 if you didn't give it a fourth
railroad.

2174
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:00,640
Yeah.

2175
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:00,740
Yeah.

2176
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:07,060
one dollar in exchange for this is pissing me off

2177
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:22,240
hey but she can afford a rent now did you just give her
money and then lose money or what this is we found each

2178
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:30,800
other out this is how the rich stays rich this is exactly
how the rich stays rich we gotta keep the rich so rich she's

2179
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,920
kissing your booty cheeks because she wants to be friends
with you.

2180
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:34,720
That's where it is.

2181
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:39,040
She's mopping the floor and sandbagging me because she knows
I'm going to keep smelling the syrup and coming back.

2182
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,680
And she's like, keep on smashing me.

2183
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,000
And keep on smashing me.

2184
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,580
And she knows my entire purpose is to send her a chat and
ride her pee-pee.

2185
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:46,680
She knows it.

2186
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:47,900
And now she's going to do that.

2187
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,220
And maybe I should end stream now.

2188
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,340
What the hell are you going on about?

2189
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:56,080
Wait, wait, if Philly don't stream, then the viewers will
come watch Lumia and our stream.

2190
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:57,380
So like, that's...

2191
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,360
Yeah, Philly's end stream.

2192
01:28:58,840 --> 01:28:59,080
No.

2193
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:00,140
End stream, Philly.

2194
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,420
Yeah, I don't feel like...

2195
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:02,020
End stream, Philly.

2196
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,680
Do what you fucking want, raid me!

2197
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,240
Raid me!

2198
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,540
I'll lose you!

2199
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:07,800
I'm back, baby!

2200
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,720
I'm back, baby!

2201
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,100
I'm back, baby!

2202
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:11,580
I'm back, baby!

2203
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:11,860
What is that?

2204
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,840
You're back, baby!

2205
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,260
You're back, baby!

2206
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:17,980
You're so back!

2207
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,220
Philly, just so you know, if you raid me, I'll bail you out.

2208
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:32,540
We give you offers, Philly.

2209
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,220
I got you, I got you, Phelian.

2210
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,580
Yeah, we got you, Phelian.

2211
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,620
We fucking got you, man.

2212
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,580
Did you just pay $90?

2213
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,860
I bet you're jealous that I could do that.

2214
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,720
Yay, where am I going?

2215
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,380
Where's this?

2216
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,400
Is this another chest?

2217
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I feel like I always get that on the...

2218
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,040
Oh, this is the...

2219
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:51,560
No!

2220
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,520
I don't get my 200...

2221
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,360
I'm too fucking rich, man!

2222
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,300
The tax bracket!

2223
01:29:59,060 --> 01:29:59,600
Ratioed.

2224
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:00,020
Nerd?

2225
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,760
Tax bracket, man.

2226
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,260
going above the tax bracket.

2227
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,440
Oh, another double.

2228
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,180
I might go to jail soon, guys.

2229
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:08,460
She's so fucking lucky.

2230
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,260
It doesn't even make sense.

2231
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:11,680
No, guys.

2232
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,080
If I have one more, I can't go to jail.

2233
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:14,780
What do you mean?

2234
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:15,700
You said, you said, Togi?

2235
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:16,860
That's where you're going to be in a few minutes.

2236
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:18,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2237
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,720
Oh, oh, oh.

2238
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,000
Where's that?

2239
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,280
It's my railroad.

2240
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:24,740
I get the chill.

2241
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:25,540
Oh, my God.

2242
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:26,740
Oh, my God.

2243
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,100
I got the fucking chill.

2244
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,620
You have to own half road, though.

2245
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,860
How crazy is that?

2246
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,340
I don't want to know.

2247
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,360
Canadian taxes hit hard.

2248
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,200
I don't know.

2249
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,740
You lie on your own thing, right?

2250
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,300
All the houses, Pippa, sells the mountain.

2251
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,040
Oh, my God!

2252
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,020
She said, no!

2253
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,700
It's okay, at least you're safe now.

2254
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,700
You know what?

2255
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:43,320
This is safer.

2256
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,300
Yeah, so you're right.

2257
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,600
It is actually safer now.

2258
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:47,760
Now you want to go to jail.

2259
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,360
Now it's cool to go to jail.

2260
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:50,780
Free woman, boy.

2261
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:51,800
Now it's cool to go to jail.

2262
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,040
But she's in the rich person jail where she at.

2263
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,820
I got a TV in here.

2264
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,180
You know what I'm saying?

2265
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:58,340
Where she's holding a man's on his jail.

2266
01:30:58,580 --> 01:30:59,500
It's called Champers.

2267
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:10,720
It's the rich person jail where you when you get caught for
Fry is something Oh, you collect 200 That's not that's not

2268
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,100
effing.

2269
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,620
That's not right.

2270
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,180
Oh my gosh.

2271
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:13,800
Yes, they're 200.

2272
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,320
Okay, can you land on my house?

2273
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,440
No, no, no, I can land on my house.

2274
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:20,340
Land on my house.

2275
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,880
I live next door.

2276
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,060
I live next door.

2277
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:23,460
I'm good.

2557
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:42,100
She literally took your property.

2558
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,500
We were trading my property.

2559
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,300

01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:46,620

2566
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,260
More from her.

2567
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,060
Good, good, good.

2568
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:54,460
Yeah.

2569
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:55,980
How do you accept the deal?

2570
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:57,220
Deal, deal, deal.

2571
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:57,620
Deal, deal.

2572
01:43:57,660 --> 01:43:58,620
Here's a hundred bucks.

2573
01:43:59,140 --> 01:43:59,940
Lumi, you coward.

2574
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:01,140
You could have gotten more.

2575
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:01,900
She's desperate.

2576
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:02,320
How?

2577
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:05,880
She doesn't even, she didn't even notice that you took her
property.

2578
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,000
She didn't even notice.

2579
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,720
Joki, I was gambling the property for the money, dog.

2580
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,060
That was the entire point of the matter.

2581
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,880
I just kind of earned money from this one.

2582
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,440
Now we know that Philly doesn't look at what she's trading.

2583
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,100
So now we know.

2584
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:21,400
I'm in virtual reality and there's four people that can
steal my money.

2585
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:22,560
I'm gonna make it up in jail.

2586
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:26,640
Is this stealing if you, like, don't even pay attention?

2587
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:28,700
It's not really stealing.

2588
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:30,680
Okay, trick.

2589
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:32,860
All right, I know.

2590
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:33,280
My turn.

2591
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:37,420
See, in the spirit of fairness, I need to have someone to
exploit if we're gonna keep playing.

2592
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,200
Whoa!

2593
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,720
Am I going to tax again?

2594
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,700
Oh, no, I didn't.

2595
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:44,480
Okay, thank God.

2596
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:45,320
I was gonna say it.

2597
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:47,720
I can pay it.

2598
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,140
Yeah, I can pay $4.

2599
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:50,300
It's just $4.

2600
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,400
What's $4 between $4 and a donkey?

2601
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:56,540
Yeah, see?

2602
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:57,860
Let's see.

2603
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:59,200

01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,640
How did you get here?

2622
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:59,820
I didn't even pass goal.

2623
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:01,080
You literally are?

2624
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:03,540
Wait, how did you get to my play?

2625
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:06,280
Want me?

2626
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,680
How much do you need?

2627
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:10,020
Give me a dollar.

2628
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,080
I'll bet you love.

2629
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,680
I'm all in chat.

2630
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,420
I'm all in on blue.

2631
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:15,900
I like how nobody's mortgaging.

2632
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:17,760
Oh, I don't want some mortgage.

2633
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:21,820
I don't know what that means, man.

2634
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:23,240
It's when you get engaged.

2635
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:24,900
I mean, women are real.

2636
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:28,240
I have no idea what mortgaging is.

2637
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,500
It's when you get engaged.

2638
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:30,500
Oh.

2639
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:38,840
Yeah, if you marry the dude from Rick and Morty, well, A,
you get a nothing lawsuit, but B, you get mortgaged, gauged.

2640
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,120

Praise to seeing you in this neck of the woods.

2678
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:33,720
All I'm saying is that you need a mortgage.

2679
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,740
Nobody's bailing you out.

2680
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,120
You want to do this to me, Lumi?

2681
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,520
I can't.

2682
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:39,640
I don't have shit, man.

2683
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:40,100

2684
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,040

01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:41,740
Marry me.

2686
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:42,160
Please.

2687
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:42,780
I love you.

2688
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:47,420
Doki, I looked at you and I realized I'm not gay.

2689
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,880
Yeah, are you willing to sign a pre-nup?

2690
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:50,080
Are you willing to sign a pre-nup?

2691
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:51,820
Okay, no, but that's the thing.

2692
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:53,500
Like, if it's true love, we should trust each other.

2693
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,800
Are you willing to sign a pre-nup then?

2694
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:59,120
If it's true love, you're willing to sign a pre-nup because
you're not in it for the money.

2695
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:00,400
That's what pre-nups are.

2696
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,640
You're not in it for the money, so you're willing to sign
it.

2697
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:04,780
Is it really true love if we sign a pre-nup?

2698
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:06,480
That just sounds like we don't even trust each other.

2699
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:12,640
But if it is true love, then you're not in it for the money,
so you would willingly sign a pre-nup.

2700
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:19,260
Why would we sign something to make it so official and
stingy literally just nods and love each other forever wow

2701
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:27,700
you suddenly fell in love with me because you landed on my
property that's so weird yeah i just love you coincidence i

Okay, do you think Spongebob would be good on the way
Fansley.

01:52:48,170 --> 01:52:50,190
I'm thinking of a sick combo right now.

2762
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:53,210
Maybe it's time to go back to Fansley.

2763
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:55,550
So I'm going to head to that pole.

2764
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:56,030
Pippa.

01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:56,910
No, Pippa Philly.

01:52:57,210 --> 01:52:58,630
Why did you say Pippa?

2767
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:01,710
It's just, it comes off my tongue very easily.

2768
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:02,590
It's a Philly.

2769
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:06,750
I'm going to pause.

2770
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:07,790
I'm going to be loving this.

2771
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:08,230
Pippa.

2772
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:11,090
Put a pole in your, put a pole in your 3D world.

2773
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:11,570
That works.

2774
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:13,370
Oh yeah, put a pole in your 3D world.

2775
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:13,670
Yeah.

2776
01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:14,610
It's my property.

2777
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:16,570
Wait, what is this?

2778
01:53:16,570 --> 01:53:16,590
Oh my God.

2779
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:17,450
She fucking owns everything.

2780
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:19,230
Electricity!

2781
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:20,910
That could have been you, Philly!

2782
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:22,790
That could have been you!

2783
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:25,650
I don't even need $14.

2784
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:26,870
I feel like a trillion.

2785
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:27,450
That could have been you!

2786
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:29,510
I don't think Donald Trump could save me.

2787
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:30,890
This is fucking Terra Clang.

2788
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:32,530
Alright, I'll put another house here too.

2789
01:53:32,610 --> 01:53:33,610
I can afford it now.

2790

01:57:26,890 --> 01:57:28,490
She's still having to hang out with the people.

2858

All right, two, two oranges.

2859

02:02:11,530 --> 02:02:12,190
She bailed you out.

2959
02:02:12,250 --> 02:02:14,570
Yeah, she bailed you out.

2960
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:16,450
You gotta say thank you to Pippa.

2961
02:02:16,610 --> 02:02:18,230
You gotta say thank you, Pippa.

2962
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:22,670
You gotta say thank you, Pippa, for bailing me out.

2963
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:24,550
I'm so...

2964
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:26,710
My life is in your debt, Pippa.

2965
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:28,170
You gotta say that to her.

2966
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:29,750
She literally bailed you out.

2967
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:33,210
She noticed.

2968
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:35,950
I was hoping you would notice it.

2969
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:37,050
You didn't fucking see it.

2970
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:37,830
Stitch!

2971
02:02:38,230 --> 02:02:42,730
You're gonna make me embarrass myself like an effing rich
person playing squid game.

2972
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:44,970
And then when I'm up and done, you're gonna trim my armor?

2973
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:48,350
Who do you think I am?

2974
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:50,270
Who do you think I am?

2975
02:02:50,350 --> 02:02:52,570
I'm pretty sure somebody must have read it out in their
chat.

2976
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:54,130
noticed it herself.

2977
02:02:54,190 --> 02:02:55,270
There's no one.

2978
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:56,290
I learned from my mistakes.

2979
02:02:57,190 --> 02:02:59,250
I didn't take this junk out.

2980
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:00,590
I don't even know what it is.

2981
02:03:00,690 --> 02:03:01,830
All right, how do you take this junk out?

2982
02:03:01,990 --> 02:03:02,410
No!

2983
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:03,310
You press enter.

2984
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:04,150
No, no, no.

2985
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:04,530
Enter?

2986
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:05,010
Okay.

2987
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:07,330
You press space and enter.

2988
02:03:08,990 --> 02:03:09,070
Oh, wait.

2989
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:13,240
Oh my god.

2990
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:14,500
Oh, million!

2991
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:16,060
Thank you all.

2992
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:16,820
Billion!

2993
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:26,240
Pippa.

2994
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:27,340
Pippa.

2995
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:28,060
Oh, Pippa!

2996
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:28,080
Oh, no.

2997
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:30,100
But treat me my property back.

2998
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:32,640
I'm gonna delete the tweet.

2999
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:33,760
Treat me my property back.

3000
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:36,000
Treat me back or I delete the tweet.

3001
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:39,620
If you delete the tweet, I'll never bail you out again.

3002
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:40,940
I'll never bail you out again.

3003
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:42,160
No, no.

3004
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:43,780
Give me my property back.

3005
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:45,900
I will never bail you out.

3006
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,680
No, my honors- I will never bail you out.

3007
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,900
It has 1,000 likes in one minute.

3008
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:51,460
Please do it.

3009
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:54,600
I'm getting moles on Twitter in a negative way.

3010
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:55,780
Pippa, please.

3011
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:56,180
Trey me.

3012
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:01,500
Any publicity is good publicity, Phyllian.

3013
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,160
That's not!

3014
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:02,840
No!

3015
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:05,600
I don't call it Amy Shrewd ever!

3016
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:06,540
No!

3017
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:07,600
I'm gonna delete the tweet!

3018
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:09,040
It's the art of the fucking deal, Phyllian.

3019
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:10,180
P-P-P-P-Pipa!

3020
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:11,020
P-Pipa!

3021
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:15,120
P-Pipa, you literally have an advantage over her.

3022
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:16,980
She's like banking on her knees.

3023
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:18,840
You can ask for anything from her now.

3024
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:19,620
Pippa.

3025
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:20,180
Any ideas?

3026
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:21,340
Give me my property back.

3027
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:22,100
I'm not kidding.

3028
02:04:22,940 --> 02:04:24,580
The adults are talking, Phyllian.

3029
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,060
Yeah, the adults are talking.

3030
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:30,920
I'm going to delete the tweet.

3031
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:31,100
What do you think?

3032
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:35,340
You gotta ask her to do something embarrassing now.

3033
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:36,500
I'm going to delete the tweet.

3034
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:40,520
If you delete the tweet, we're never bailing you out on
Monopoly.

3035
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:42,340
I'd rather die than not.

3036
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:44,240
I'm not going to go out on a scam.

3037
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,100
I'm not going to go out on a scam.

3038
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:48,760
I'm not going out on a scam.

3039
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:52,140
So you'd rather be the first one to lose in Monopoly?

3040
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:52,800
Yes.

3041
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,200
You'd rather be the loser?

3042
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:55,160
Yes.

3043
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:56,320
The first one to lose?

3044
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:57,320
Okay.

3045
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:57,760
You know what?

3046
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:04,640
Maybe I don't, but if I doesn't change How I feel on the
inside Four of us, you would want me Okay, just tell me the

Add the VTuber Awards.

3053
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,120
You have to be like, I'm terrible at Monopoly.

3054
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,700
And we will trade the...

3055
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:38,840
Pippos will trade back to territory.

3056
02:05:39,380 --> 02:05:40,600
No, I want something I can do right now.

3057
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,740
No, we will have an IOU.

3058
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:43,460
We'll just have an IOU for the VTuber Awards.

3059
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:44,640
Give me something I can do right now.

3060
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:48,120
What's the most embarrassing thing you can possibly do?

3061
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:49,340
I'll probably delete a tweet.

3062
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:50,860
No.

3063
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:51,640
Make the tweet your banner.

3064
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,180
Oh, yeah.

3065
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:53,980
Oh, true.

3066
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:54,700
Word copper.

3067
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:57,860
You would do this today?

3068
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:04,660
Make a tweet your Twitter banner and your YouTube channel
banner because it has two million subscribers.

3069
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:13,180
She has more people on her YouTube channel than her Twitter.

3070
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:15,180
So she should make a banner on her YouTube channel.

3071
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:15,820
No, no, no, no.

3072
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:16,860
You do better.

3073
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:18,080
I don't do it.

3074
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:20,920
You get the territory back.

3075
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:22,620
You get your property back.

3076
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,120
You get your property back.

3077
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:25,400
No, I'll just leave.

3078
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:26,220
I'll just lose monopoly.

3079
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:26,820
That's fine.

3080
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:31,200
I'll delete the whole of your tweet.

3081
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:35,220
You just, you're right on this monopolis.

3082
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:38,340
Like it's, it's Million, it's such a small thing.

3083
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:39,820
I'm gonna end stream on the radio.

3084
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:42,180
It's just a small thing.

3085
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:46,100
Million, why are you letting Monopolis get to you?

3086
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:47,800
Well, he just made it my Twitter banner.

3087
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:51,440
Because at least can, like, take the plate on one platform.

3088
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:52,540
On the Twitter banner?

3089
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:54,140
Okay, nice, all right, sure.

3090
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:55,080
And Twitter banner.

3091
02:06:55,180 --> 02:06:56,820
Wow, now I just negotiate myself backwards.

3092
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:07,780
negotiating work you know how negotiating work you give a
long tall order so they'll want you to do you do what the

3093
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:14,920
hell is this okay whatever that's not negotiating works you
give a very big demand and then it'll make them want to do

the letter demand because you weren't going to do the
twitter thing at first all right twitter banner now i am

This is so dumb.

The best trade girl in this story.

3099
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:49,660
If you follow my Twitter, it'll be the same.

3100

Hey, look, we're getting it.

3101

the middle of my face.

Okay, okay.

3111
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:13,460
You do it for me.

3112
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:14,260
I don't want to do this.

3113
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:14,680
Oh, you.

3114
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:15,700

Who won't stop me?

3121
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:55,680
Who won't stop me?

3122
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:57,540
What is it?

3123
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:57,920
A fussy?

3124
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:00,780
Philly was a scabbler all along.

3125
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,900
We were making business negotiations with Philly.

3126
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:04,880
I know, I'm getting scabbling.

3127
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:06,960
I don't get to talk while these guys are talking.

3128
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:08,500
You sit at the kids' table, Philly.

3129
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,780
I took them to the preschool all over again.

3130
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,920
Philly and our fucking zoo pals place.

3131
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,660
My face is so familiar with the inside of a toilet from the
number of strolls I've gotten.

3132
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:22,560
Please stop me on this property.

3133
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:23,380
Jesus.

3134
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:26,020
No honor.

3135
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:27,240
No honor, man.

3136
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:30,340
I think Pippa's gonna win this in the end.

3137
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:32,160
Her property is scary.

3138
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:34,480
I don't know.

3139
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:35,820
It's between us.

3140
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:36,700
It's between us.

3141
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:40,280
Oh my god, boardwalk.

3142
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:41,900
Hey, $50.

3143
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:42,520
Oh, that's fine.

3144
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:42,940
That's fine?

3145
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:44,080
Yeah, that's the money.

3146
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:48,760
Hey, Philly, and remember when you landed on boardwalk?

3147
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:49,620
Yeah, remember that?

3148
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:50,740
That was so funny.

3149
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:53,760
That's the place you've always wanted.

3150
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:59,120
I should have been paying you $50.

3151
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:02,220
Can I get in jail, please?

3152
02:10:02,540 --> 02:10:03,700
Yeah, I want to go to jail.

3153
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:04,540
I want jail.

3154
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:05,380
Give me jail.

3155
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,280
I don't want to be here anymore.

3156
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:09,520
Oh, you got that!

3157
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:10,960
Oh, you can't afford it!

3158
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:12,460
Jesus.

3159
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:14,460
But Pippa can.

3160
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:16,360
I'm just fucking withdrawing.

3161
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:17,020
There you go.

3162
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:18,240
Enjoy your property.

3163
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:21,980
I don't know what you expect.

3164
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:23,140
Philly is.

3165
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:26,500
Nice try.

3166
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:29,420
You have to withdraw.

3167
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:34,720
I rest my case, Romney.

3168
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,280
1-21.

3169
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:42,360
This is horrifying.

3170
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:44,280
This whole game's fucked up.

3171
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:46,640
I'll enter.

3172
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:49,920
Just let me fast go.

3173
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:51,160
Okay.

3174
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,500
We're at the stage where it's like, it's the final
countdown.

3175
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:57,920
Let's go.

3176
02:10:58,100 --> 02:10:59,420
Get bankrupt first.

3177
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:01,560
Waited for death.

3178
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:02,480
You have to pay $100.

3179
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:04,960
You don't have money, by the way.

3180
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:06,180
You don't have...

3181
02:11:06,180 --> 02:11:07,160
I love your eye life.

3182
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:08,920
You really have...

3183
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:09,640
What tweet do you guys want?

3184
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:10,740
Just mortgage.

3185
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:11,460
Just mortgage.

3186
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:13,300
You have one more property to mortgage.

3187
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:13,560
I know.

3188
02:11:13,620 --> 02:11:14,420
I can tweet, too.

3189
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:18,120
Well, we know you're going to delete the tweet.

3190
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:19,380
This is how you get addicted to drugs, no?

3191
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:20,340
It's like, yeah, don't worry.

3192
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:20,640
Don't worry.

3193
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:22,440
I can just sell off a body part.

3194
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:23,320
Just give me a little...

3195
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:23,780
One hit.

3196
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:27,840
The thing is, we can't trust you anymore because you said
you delete tweets.

3197
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:30,500
So we can't trust you about tweets anymore.

3198
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:34,760
Kind of a sore loser, Philly.

3199
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:35,600
You are making me kick.

3200
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,420
You are evicting me from my home.

3201
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:38,220
Just so you know.

3202
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:39,820
We are evicting a VTuber.

3203
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:42,740
Your arrogance did this.

3204
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,020
Yeah, your arrogance did this.

3205
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:44,880
What do you mean?

3206
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:46,440
Biblically accurate Elden Ring characters?

3207
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:47,920
What is this?

3208
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,340
The price of your Elden Ring is billion.

3209
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:51,480
She's fallen.

3210
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:53,580
Okay, like, what is this?

3211
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:56,220
You don't even pay it to, like, us.

3212
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,080
Yeah, you pay it to, like, the government.

Okay.

I'll join?

3228
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:47,820
And then we won't sign a prenup.

3229
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:50,220
What?

3230
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:50,820
What?

3231
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:53,780
Why would you just sign a prenup for Faze Clan?

3232
02:12:55,460 --> 02:12:55,900
What?

3233
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:56,500
I'm getting married.

3234
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:03,020
Wait, okay, so be honest, do you have independence or not?

3235
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:04,700
Independence?

3236
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:05,700
Like, what do you mean?

3237
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:07,000
Can you make a pen dance?

3238
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:08,100
What?

3239
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:09,500
Do you have independence?

3240
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:10,060
What?

3241
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:11,640
It's hard to keep off of this.

3242
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:18,340
Pippa, Pippa, I'll give you a get-out-of-jail-free card for
one of the, for the last blue.

3243
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:20,680
Sounds good.

3244
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:22,940
Let's do it.

3245
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:23,740
Let's do it.

3246
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:25,840
This is fucked up, man.

3247
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:26,940
This is fucked up.

3248
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:29,620
Tray the Get Out of Jail free card?

3249
02:13:29,820 --> 02:13:30,280
Yeah, you can.

3250
02:13:30,380 --> 02:13:30,560
You can.

3251
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:31,400
Yeah.

3252
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,560
Yeah.

3253
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:33,800
Future is now old, man.

3254
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,160
And then I will take the blue.

3255
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:38,960
Wait, Pippa, why would you...

3256
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,140
Don't you want to be in jail?

3257
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:44,120
But she can pretend she can get out, but she wouldn't.

3258
02:13:44,260 --> 02:13:44,820
It's a choice.

3259
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:46,200
She doesn't have to use it.

3260
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:47,460
This is literally collusion.

3261
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:49,980
Pippa, you think this is going to get you somewhere?

3262
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:51,460
She doesn't have to use it.

3263
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:53,000
Where are you, Pippa?

3264
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,160
I'm in the middle of the house.

3265
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:56,260
What do you mean?

3266
02:13:57,440 --> 02:13:58,040
You're in the middle of the house.

3267
02:13:58,100 --> 02:13:59,660
I'm sorry to be on my board right now.

3268
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,500
Oh my god.

3269
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:03,080
It's your fault I'm broke.

3270
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:03,700
What?

3271
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:05,580
Now you're blaming others.

3272
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:07,180
The corruption is insane, man.

3273
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:08,520
What the hell?

3274
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:09,220
The corruption is insane, man.

3275
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:10,580
You made your bed, Philean.

3276
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:13,000
VTuber doesn't take responsibility.

3277
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:13,320
I never did.

3278
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:14,920
I never will.

3279
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,460
My bed bugs pay rent.

3280
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:19,400
Yeah.

3281
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:21,440
Doesn't look like it.

3282
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:27,600
Oh, she got some jail.

3283
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:31,200
God, she got the best card!

3284
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:32,020
Hey, Pippa!

3285
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:33,000
Why don't you use it?

3286
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:34,000
Get out of jail, Pippa.

3287
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:35,600
Why don't you get out of jail, Pippa?

3288
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:36,460
Come on.

3289
02:14:36,540 --> 02:14:37,000
Do it.

3290
02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:39,900
I mean, I can with the card I just got that you made fun of
me to get in.

3291
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:40,820
You're gonna.

3292
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:41,260
Look at that.

3293
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:41,800
I know you are.

3294
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:43,020
Because you want to get out of jail.

3295
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:43,760
I know you do.

3296
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:44,560
Please let me out of jail.

3297
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:45,500
Let me in jail.

3298
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:46,640
Let me in jail.

3299
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:48,100
Let me in jail.

3300
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:49,540
What is that?

3301
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:50,160
This game.

3302
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:50,840
Let's see.

3303
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:52,300
Oh, it's so close.

3304
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:53,740
Oh, my God!

3305
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:55,080
It's taxed.

3306
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:57,300
You got taxed.

3307
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:01,660
I'm so fucked up!

3308
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:02,840
Oh my god!

3309
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,900
Loomy stealing from the self-checkout, hoping to catch her.

3310
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:07,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3311
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:08,540
That's what you get.

3312
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:10,900
I put those gummy bears in my pocket, so what?

3313
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:15,860
Oh my god, it would be so funny if she has to pay the
government tax too.

3314
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:17,000
What is that?

3315
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:18,460
That's eight.

3316
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,920
That's a lot of numbers.

3317
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:22,380
Oh, hey, it's your own property!

3318
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:23,760
You got saved!

3319
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:25,320
Yeah!

3320
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:26,720
No, no, she mortgaged it, didn't she?

3321
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:28,920
Yeah, she mortgaged it, but...

3322
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:32,080
But she can't do anything with it.

3323
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:32,580
Can't do it.

3324
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:33,380
No, I can buy a house.

3325
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:34,680
I mean, you can, yeah.

3326
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:35,900
I'll do it.

3327
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:37,620
Wait, what does mortgaging do again?

3328
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:40,620
The other spaces, you don't pay anything on the other
spaces.

3329
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:41,740
Oh.

3330
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:46,460
So, like, if we landed on her other two squares that she
mortgaged, then we don't have to pay her anything.

3331
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:47,980
Okay, so I have a spot again.

3332
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:48,820
I have a spot again.

3333
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,760
No, you don't because you're still mortgaging that spot.

3334
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:52,400
I bought it.

3335
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:52,980
I just bought it back.

3336
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:53,580
I just bought it.

3337
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:55,460
Wait, you don't.

3338
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:56,320
I unmortgage.

3339
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:56,800
I unmortgage.

3340
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:58,040
You don't.

3341
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:00,420
I own a mortgage!

3342
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:03,440
Oh my god, $50!

3343
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,540
I own a property!

3344
02:16:05,540 --> 02:16:07,660
$50 is better than $800.

3345
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:08,480
I'll take it.

3346
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:09,260
Slowly, but surely.

3347
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:12,360
As long as we have to pip us.

3348
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:13,080
I own a property.

3349
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,160
I'm not a property owner.

3350
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:16,760
Dude, I'm one of the elites.

3351
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,700

I have a house.

3356
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:29,540

That's...

3362
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:03,380
It's fine.

3363
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:04,160
It's like $5.

3364
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:04,940
It's okay.

3365
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:05,580
It's mortgage.

3366
02:17:05,660 --> 02:17:06,400
It's like...

3367
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:06,540
Yeah.

3368
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:07,860

02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:08,640
So you're fine.

3370
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:09,780
You got saved.

3371
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:10,740
Can I borrow you?

3372
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:11,240
No.

3373
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:11,980
No.

3374
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:14,580
You actually got saved.

3375
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:17,140
I think Loomy can un-mortgage this soon.

3376
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:19,060
I think I can if I get close.

3377
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:20,520
Wait, can I un-mortgage my property?

3378
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:22,360
You can if you have the money, yeah.

Cool $80.

3407
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:25,840
I'm just struggling to live, okay?

3408
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,120
After people bankrupted me.

3409
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:34,520
Look at this bitch and now she's hiding in jail.

3410
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:37,160
That's how the rich survive.

3411
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:39,800
She doesn't have to pay taxes because she's in jail.

3412
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:41,540
Yeah, she doesn't have to do shit.

3413
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:43,320
She just sits in jail and chills.

3414
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,020
Legally, I have no income.

3415
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:46,600
You're AFK.

3416
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:49,100
You're having AFK.

3417
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:52,620
I hate this game.

3418
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:54,700
You chose it.

3419
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:56,340
I want to be in jail.

3420
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:57,340
You did choose it.

3421
02:18:57,880 --> 02:18:58,140
You did.

3422
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:01,220
Oh, you get to have your...

3423
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:03,660
Yeah, you just have to look through your properties.

3424
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:06,460
You guys made me tweet about it.

3425
02:19:06,980 --> 02:19:07,840
All right, end turn.

3426
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:09,280
Right?

3427
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:09,820
That's it.

3428
02:19:10,340 --> 02:19:11,740
Does that mean Philean's got to pay me?

3429
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:13,620
No, she has to land on it again.

3430
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:15,420
No, it is your turn.

3431
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:16,580
What do you mean, Philean?

3432
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:19,080
Roll it too, Philean.

3433
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:20,620
Roll it too.

3434
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:23,740
And it's my property.

3435
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:24,500
What is that?

3436
02:19:24,560 --> 02:19:24,740
What is that?

3437
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:25,380
What is that?

3438
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:27,060
That's like, that's one of my trades.

3439
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:27,840
Stop.

3440
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:33,220
You can't even up.

3441
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:35,400
Guys, it's time to mortgage again.

3442
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:37,820
Philly, it's time to mortgage.

3443
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:40,240
Okay, that's fine.

3444
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:40,960
I'll mortgage.

3445
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:44,040
Got back, and then Gordon.

3446
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:46,140
Okay, that's fine.

3447
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:48,860
She can't even afford it with a mortgage.

3448
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:51,820
Can I, can I, can anyone?

3449
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:54,960
You just need like...

3450
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:55,700
I have a gun.

3451
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:56,140
I have a gun.

3452
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:57,340
Yeah?

02:19:57,940 --> 02:19:59,100
No, I want to trade.

3454
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:01,180
I'm gonna trade with Pippa.

3455
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:02,020
You only need $58.

3456
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:03,880
Who wants to trade me?

3457
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:05,860
What's $58 worth you, Philean?

3458
02:20:06,480 --> 02:20:08,000
Um, God, at least one kidney.

3459
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:10,960
Maybe even a contact bar?

3460
02:20:11,420 --> 02:20:12,740
Give us one of your blues.

3461
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:14,980
Okay.

Okay.

3470
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:26,880
Wait, does she have a blue?

3471
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:29,540

I'm trying.

3508
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:12,400

02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:22,420
Bro, you must have declared bankruptcy.

3512
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:24,520
This is not worth it.

3513
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:26,220
You just declared bankruptcy.

3514
02:22:26,420 --> 02:22:28,180
You practically lost everything.

3515
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:32,900
even have anything anymore after you do this deal.

3516
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:36,700

02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:07,060
I don't think you know the rules of the game.

3660
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:10,600
How do I do this?

3661
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:10,980
Here?

3662
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:14,660
There.

3663
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:17,200
I'm thinking more like this.

3664
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:19,300
Exactly.

3665
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:20,540
What?

3666
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:21,180
What?

3667
02:30:21,460 --> 02:30:21,980
What?

3668
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:22,720
What?

3669
02:30:24,060 --> 02:30:26,300
Wait, how am I still offering 150?

3670
02:30:27,940 --> 02:30:28,780
I refuse.

3671
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:29,780
And then we refuse.

3672
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:31,860
All right, good luck.

3673
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:32,680
What?

3674
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:34,480
Philly, you will regret this.

3675
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:36,420
Yeah, but my peers already didn't regret.

3676
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:38,040
Oh, shit.

3677
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:39,960
You made an enemy.

3678
02:30:40,540 --> 02:30:41,800
You made an enemy.

3679
02:30:41,980 --> 02:30:43,340
I made an enemy.

3680
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:44,060
Shut up.

3681
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:45,220
I have no dollars.

3682
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:45,910
I have no property.

3683
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:46,980
I have no hoes.

3684
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:50,000
My wife led me for Andrew Tate and my Bugatti got impounded.

3685
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,620
How do you want me to win this?

3686
02:30:51,620 --> 02:30:52,920
I'm not going to live there.

3687
02:30:53,020 --> 02:30:54,380
Your wife left you for me.

3688
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,480
I'm in San Francisco.

3689
02:30:56,960 --> 02:30:58,230
Poopy on the floor right now.

3690
02:31:03,340 --> 02:31:04,220
Stop laughing.

3691
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:05,300
Add it to the poop map.

3692
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:07,920
Put it on the poop map.

3693
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:08,700
That's Phyllians.

3694
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:10,160
We'll put a little star on it.

3695
02:31:10,260 --> 02:31:13,260
It'll be like the Hollywood Walk of Fame except Phyllians
poop.

3696
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:15,020
What?

3697
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:16,380
Oh my god.

3698
02:31:16,580 --> 02:31:19,820
The board is more free now.

3699
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:21,600
The board is more generous.

3700
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:23,100
You're gonna make it!

3701
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:25,500
Sell your homes, Pippa!

3702
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:26,860
You have to sell!

3703
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:28,860
You don't need the yacht, Pippa!

3704
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:30,140
Sell it!

3705
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:34,500
Just sell until you need $100 and then ask for a fill-in for
$100.

3706
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:38,600
Pippa, I'll do the deal for $100.

3707
02:31:39,140 --> 02:31:44,420
Can you sell her one of her own mortgage like properties and
then she can't even use it?

3708
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:46,320
That's true!

3709
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:51,540
Sell the blues because she can't even pay I can't even pay
back the mortgages!

3710
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:54,600
I can't even pay back the mortgages!

3711
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:55,740
You sell the blues!

3712
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,760
I can't even fucking mortgages!

3713
02:31:58,260 --> 02:31:59,700
You can't un-mortgages!

3714
02:32:01,580 --> 02:32:03,240
You're so smart!

3715
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,800
My god, I'll hear billion.

3716
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:08,640

There you go.

3719
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:11,380
There's a deal.

3720
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:13,020
All her money, all her money.

3721
02:32:13,220 --> 02:32:13,680
She'll take it.

3722
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:14,580
She'll give her some properties!

3723
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:16,700
Can I take all her money?

3724
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:17,620
What?

3725
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,240
What is happening?

3726
02:32:19,980 --> 02:32:21,420

3728

02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:16,360
There we go.

3836
02:38:16,540 --> 02:38:17,860
Oh my fucking god.

3837
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:21,100
Just so you know, this is worth more than you are.

3838
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:26,980
Someone's just freaking...

3839
02:38:27,940 --> 02:38:30,580
Someone's salty that they're losing in Monopoly.

3840
02:38:32,120 --> 02:38:33,180
That's so sad.

3841
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:35,100
I'm having all the pain.

3842
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:38,120
Hey, you can pay for your health insurance now.

3843
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:38,880
Is that great?

3844
02:38:39,460 --> 02:38:41,080
That's what pay off all these mortgages.

3845
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:43,200
Yeah.

3846
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:46,480
Now you just have to pay for the healthcare.

3847
02:38:47,320 --> 02:38:48,080
Chat, I'm literally one.

3848
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:50,200
It's okay, you're so close to the end.

3849
02:38:50,340 --> 02:38:53,380
All you gotta do is land on boardwalk, grab your toaster,
and you're done.

3850
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:53,740
Yeah.

3851
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:54,660
Chat, I'm literally one.

3852
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:56,360
And your turn.

3853
02:38:56,480 --> 02:38:57,480
It's my turn now.

3854
02:38:57,480 --> 02:38:58,120
I got one, chat.

3855
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:04,840
I'm going to land on, like, Like Pippa Square, I feel like.

3856
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:05,840
Oh, and less.

3857
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:06,840
Oh, shit.

3858
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:09,280
This luck is insane.

3859
02:39:10,180 --> 02:39:10,440
Chance.

3860
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:12,040
This luck is literally insane.

3861
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:12,480
Hello.

3862
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:13,400
Take a treat.

3863
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:13,660
Oh.

3864
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:14,940
Oh.

3865
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:17,320
I'm going to go to my own railroad?

3866
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:18,560
What the?

3867
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:22,000
Let's go.

3868
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:24,080
I'm like a protagonist and a hentai.

3869
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:26,200
I'm just happy to be in jail, man.

3870
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:28,300
All I ever wanted was to be in jail.

3871
02:39:28,820 --> 02:39:29,500
Wait, is that?

3872
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:30,360
That's...

3873
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:30,920
Oh, oh.

3874
02:39:31,740 --> 02:39:32,260
Whoa.

3875
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:34,340
It's so jucky.

3876
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:37,380
You own this.

3877
02:39:38,180 --> 02:39:39,080
You're so safe.

3878
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:41,000
I gotta roll again, though.

3879
02:39:41,800 --> 02:39:42,900
Yeah, you gotta roll again.

3880
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:44,840
Where's that?

3881
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:45,880
What is that?

3882
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:46,520
I don't know.

3883
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:47,020
I'm scared.

3884
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:49,620
Nobody has any money.

3885
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:51,240
Who is that?

3886
02:39:52,220 --> 02:39:53,040
Oh, you got chance.

3887
02:39:53,180 --> 02:39:53,800
Oh, you're safe.

3888
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:54,540
You're safe.

3889
02:39:55,080 --> 02:39:55,700
You're safe.

3890
02:39:55,880 --> 02:39:56,560
Thread the needle.

3891
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:57,900
You threaded the needle.

3892
02:39:58,100 --> 02:39:59,180
Go back three spaces.

3893
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:00,660
Oh, my God.

3894
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:01,440
Oh, my God.

3895
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:03,180
Now you can be.

3896
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:05,400
There's nothing I could have done.

3897
02:40:05,400 --> 02:40:06,800
Come on, come on, come on.

3898
02:40:07,720 --> 02:40:09,220
And you get money!

3899
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:10,840
At least I'm not Philean.

3900
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:11,700
She's still in this.

3901
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:12,700
She's still in this.

3902
02:40:12,940 --> 02:40:14,580
I was in jail for one turn, dude.

3903
02:40:14,920 --> 02:40:15,920
I was in jail for one turn.

3904
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:18,220
I think Philean's coping right now.

3905
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:20,580
She's going through it.

3906
02:40:20,720 --> 02:40:21,940
Oh, you got out!

3907
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:25,380
One time you don't want to get out.

3908
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:28,240
And that's the property you sold me.

3909

Roll the dice.

Roll the dice.

3928
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:44,380
Roll the dice.

02:41:44,620 --> 02:41:45,620

3935
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:51,420
Boardwalk.

3936
02:41:51,640 --> 02:41:52,340
The fuck up.

3937
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:53,780
Oh.

3938
02:41:54,320 --> 02:41:55,260
Not boardwalk.

3939
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:55,800
That's a good number.

3940
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:56,700
That's a good number, right?

3941
02:41:57,400 --> 02:41:57,840
Yay!

3942
02:41:58,160 --> 02:41:59,300
You just did the same.

Go!

3946
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:05,840
God, she's safe for another turn.

3947
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:13,560
She's safe again.

3948
02:42:14,200 --> 02:42:14,840
Safe for now.

3949
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:16,520
Oh, hey, this is...

3950
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:17,760
Look at this property.

3951
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:18,340
My beauty heart.

3952
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:22,380
Which is, like, the closest.

3953
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:24,340
Okay, Phileon's close to here, so I'll put...

3954
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:24,960
I'm buying a water ticket.

3955
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:25,720
I'm going to...

3956
02:42:25,720 --> 02:42:25,940
All right.

3957
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:27,480
Oh, my God.

3958
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:29,400
You're going to build a house on my property.

3959
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:30,460
That's my money.

3960
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:31,960
Your property?

3961
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:33,040
That's my...

3962
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:33,900
We're proud.

3963
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:38,440
You build a more old city, and you have more fans there than
I do.

3964
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:41,560
I'm getting more like Drake versus Kendrick.

3965
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:43,260
Like, it's just...

3966
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:43,700
Okay.

3967
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:45,580
Good luck.

3968
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:47,360
I hope you don't land there.

3969
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:49,420
Listen, listen, listen, don't you...

3970
02:42:49,420 --> 02:42:50,560
I know how this junk works, okay?

3971
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:51,800
I literally had a house there.

3972
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,620
If you land on that, I will owe you, like, $14.

3973
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:54,600
I don't go for free.

3974
02:42:56,440 --> 02:42:56,840
Pippa!

3975
02:42:57,260 --> 02:42:57,580
Oh!

3976
02:42:58,880 --> 02:42:59,280
Pippa!

3977
02:42:59,280 --> 02:42:59,500
Oh, no.

3978
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:01,560
Pippa, oh, my God.

3979
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:02,360
Pippa, I'll bail you out.

3980
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:05,080
Or you can sell your mortgage, your property.

3981
02:43:05,320 --> 02:43:05,800
You can pick.

3982
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,260
Yeah, mortgage, your belt.

3983
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:09,280
It's time to fuck off.

3984
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:10,500
Mortgage your belt.

3985
02:43:10,820 --> 02:43:12,040
I'll give you an IOU.

3986
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:13,840
Okay, and I'll take it.

3987
02:43:13,900 --> 02:43:14,580
I'll take it.

3988
02:43:17,740 --> 02:43:20,000
Can't put it to the last one in.

3989
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:21,680
I have $200.

3990
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:24,120
I can't die before Philean.

3991
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:26,600
I have $200.

3992
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:28,920
I have $200.

3993
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:31,200
Yeah, and nothing to offer.

3994
02:43:31,580 --> 02:43:33,000
I have a lot of assets.

3995
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:34,200
Emma Baker?

3996
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:37,360
You have nothing to do.

3997
02:43:37,380 --> 02:43:38,280
I got an action zero.

3998
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:39,700
This is action three one.

3999
02:43:39,880 --> 02:43:40,700
This is action three one.

4000
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:42,060
This is action three one.

4001
02:43:42,060 --> 02:43:42,640
What do you mean?

4002
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:44,260
I'm just bailing people out.

4003
02:43:44,540 --> 02:43:45,280
Well, you know what, brother?

4004
02:43:45,480 --> 02:43:46,000
I'm not being tortured.

4005
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:46,640
You know what?

4006
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:47,180
I'm what I want.

4007
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:48,080
This is so stupid.

4008
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:49,220
I'm bailing people out.

4009
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:51,140
I'm like, you're going to bail me out.

4010
02:43:52,280 --> 02:43:53,860
You build a house on blue.

4011
02:43:54,220 --> 02:43:55,280
I've bailed you out.

4012
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:57,180
I gave you the option to get bail out.

4013
02:43:57,300 --> 02:43:58,140
You didn't take it.

4014
02:43:58,220 --> 02:43:59,420
I gave you that option.

4015
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:01,200
I gave you my property.

4016
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:02,740
I gave you the property.

4017
02:44:02,740 --> 02:44:03,060
I gave you the property.

4018
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:03,180
I gave you.

4019
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:09,140
I pulled a hat on her specifically because I was gonna buy
it and now I'm feeling it.

4020
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:10,300
I'll feel you out of it.

4021
02:44:10,360 --> 02:44:11,260
I'll feel you out of it.

4022
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:12,860
You are an epic liar!

4023
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:16,360
You were jesting!

4024
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:17,980
I'm in the death zone!

4025
02:44:18,500 --> 02:44:19,800
I'm becoming atheists!

4026
02:44:20,940 --> 02:44:22,300
I'm in the death zone!

4027
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:23,560
You're fine.

4028
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:24,740
You got the... You got the...

4029
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:25,260
You got the save.

4030
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:26,100
It's okay.

4031
02:44:26,100 --> 02:44:28,380
You're a Fortnite 2018 great pistol.

4032
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:29,320
Chance, chance, chance, chance!

4033
02:44:29,660 --> 02:44:30,700
Oh, now dodge.

4034
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:32,200
If unowned...

4035
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:34,100
and pay over.

4036
02:44:34,100 --> 02:44:35,020
Oh, that's my utility.

4037
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:35,780
Ten times?

4038
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:36,680
Yeah, it's me.

4039
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:39,880
Sheez.

4040
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:40,880
Goodbye, cool world.

4041
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:42,160
Goodbye, cool world.

All I need to live, well, just gotta live until Philly and
dies.

02:44:57,240 --> 02:44:58,000

02:45:40,280 --> 02:45:42,700
Doki, independent VTubers strong together.

4063
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:45,020
No, you're a part of Mythic.

4064
02:45:45,660 --> 02:45:46,100
Wardwalk!

4065
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:49,760
Oh, it might actually be, you know?

4066
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:50,860
Oh, shit.

4067
02:45:51,220 --> 02:45:51,460
She's a duo.

4068
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:52,380
Oh, she's just missing.

4069
02:45:52,940 --> 02:45:54,520
She avoids me.

4070
02:45:55,480 --> 02:45:57,260
She avoids it yet again.

4071
02:45:57,880 --> 02:46:00,060
Okay, so I'm gonna go over after I walk you up.

4072
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:03,020
Okay, I'm gonna go over to security guard and twerk him.

4073
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:04,100
They don't put me in jail.

4074
02:46:04,220 --> 02:46:04,640
They're racist.

4075
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:06,100
That's my plan of action.

4076
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:09,700
She gets to avoid jail again again.

4077
02:46:10,760 --> 02:46:11,760
I'm gonna go in there.

4078
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:13,860
Oh, is that Pippa's?

4079
02:46:14,060 --> 02:46:14,560
No, that's mine.

4080
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:15,020
Oh, thank God.

4081
02:46:15,100 --> 02:46:15,480
That's mine.

4082
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:15,620
Oh, no.

4083
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:16,700
Everything milky.

Oh, yeah, I do.

4085
02:46:18,780 --> 02:46:20,280
You want the entire side of the board.

4086
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:21,100
Oh, my God.

4087
02:46:21,820 --> 02:46:21,820

4088
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:22,720
Where is she going?

4089
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:25,060
Okay, I'm gonna put a house here.

4090
02:46:25,300 --> 02:46:25,480
What are you doing?

4091
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:26,560
What are you doing?

4092
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:28,400
Actually, I'm gonna put a house.

4093
02:46:28,520 --> 02:46:29,460
Actually, I'll put a house here.

4094
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:30,640
She might land on here more often.

4095
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:32,020
Am I in the Middle East?

4096
02:46:32,100 --> 02:46:40,140
Every step is a land This is ridiculous I'm going to put it
here And then I'm going to put one here as well And then

Yes!

4113
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:30,560
Holy shit, we're still in it.

4114
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:34,100
It's a 4v1.

4115
02:47:35,260 --> 02:47:36,600
Good luck, Bill.

4116
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:39,560
I own this entire side, so good luck.

4117
02:47:40,220 --> 02:47:44,040
Just so you know, I actually got dragged into the military,
so I actually have to go.

4118
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:46,960
Oh, so you're declaring bankruptcy?

4119
02:47:47,500 --> 02:47:48,320
You're going to declare bankruptcy?

4120
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:48,960
No, no, no, no.

4121
02:47:49,080 --> 02:47:50,160
Well, you have to leave.

4122
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:51,160
If you have to leave.

4123
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:51,780
Forward walk!

4124
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:52,480
What's up, eventually?

4125
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:54,080
See?

4126
02:47:54,420 --> 02:47:54,700
Easy.

4127
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:58,500
It's really nice knowing that it's not the place I just
bought the house on.

4128
02:47:58,740 --> 02:48:01,180
Like, I literally just got bought the house.

4129
02:48:01,620 --> 02:48:02,220
That's crazy.

4130
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:02,840
Oh, it's not so bad.

4131
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:03,180
It's not so bad.

4132
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:03,600
so bad.

4133
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:04,840
I just put one house there.

4134
02:48:04,840 --> 02:48:05,780
Look at that.

4135
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:08,720
It's like a rat, and it cannot be that bad.

4136
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:13,840
It's not that bad, see?

4137
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:19,160
She's so happy.

4138
02:48:19,640 --> 02:48:21,220
And turn for me.

4139
02:48:21,560 --> 02:48:22,640
Okay, sure.

4140
02:48:23,480 --> 02:48:24,800
She's fucking disabled.

4141
02:48:24,980 --> 02:48:27,060
You're taking everything from, you must take my epic turn.

4142
02:48:27,580 --> 02:48:28,480
Oh, Deppin!

4143
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:29,480
Let's go.

4144
02:48:29,480 --> 02:48:31,220
I'm gonna take my epic organs.

4145
02:48:31,460 --> 02:48:32,520
You're like, yay!

4146
02:48:33,480 --> 02:48:35,320
And then I can roll again.

4147
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:39,000
Let's go Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4148
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,320
The luck on this girl is insane.

4149
02:48:40,320 --> 02:48:42,440
I think this game would have ended This is unreal.

4150
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:45,280
I think this is is that your is that mine or yours.

4151
02:48:45,740 --> 02:48:51,840
Oh, it's I get to go to jail Oh my god.

4152
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:51,840
Oh my god.

4153
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:56,920
I get to go to jail She's a good person let her out.

4154
02:48:57,160 --> 02:48:58,320
Oh my god.

4155
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:02,140
Oh my god.

4156
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:05,820
She doesn't deserve jail She deserves your reputation is a
bit now, Doki.

4157
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:06,620
No, it's fine.

4158
02:49:06,820 --> 02:49:07,680
I'm fine with being.

4159
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:08,300
It's okay.

4160
02:49:09,320 --> 02:49:10,020
Yeah, you're a criminal.

4161
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:11,180
I'm here to reform.

4162
02:49:11,820 --> 02:49:12,600
She's got delicate skin and stuff.

4163
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:13,200
Yeah, yeah.

4164
02:49:13,280 --> 02:49:14,360
I got framed, guys.

4165
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:14,880
It's okay.

4166
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:15,720
I got framed.

4167
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:17,200
Look, I haven't...

4168
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:22,720
It was so unfortunate to get framed like that.

4169
02:49:23,580 --> 02:49:23,800
All right.

4170
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:26,840
How did she owe $20, but I owe 70?

4171
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:30,120
Because I have a house on that property, Philean.

4172
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:31,440
That's so crazy.

4173
02:49:31,560 --> 02:49:32,360
How did that happen?

4174
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:34,800
Phelian, if you'd been a nicer person.

4175
02:49:34,940 --> 02:49:36,900
Yeah, you'd been a nicer person at the beginning of the
game.

4176
02:49:36,940 --> 02:49:37,000
Am I dead?

4177
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:37,720
Am I done?

4178
02:49:38,060 --> 02:49:39,280
Oh, my God.

4179
02:49:39,660 --> 02:49:40,560
It's not over yet.

4180
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:41,380
I'll take that.

4181
02:49:41,460 --> 02:49:41,840
I don't care.

4182
02:49:41,960 --> 02:49:42,300
I don't care.

4183
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:43,280
It's not boardwalk.

4184
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:45,040
It's not boardwalk.

4185
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:45,700
I'm free.

4186
02:49:46,480 --> 02:49:47,180
All right, Phelian.

4187
02:49:47,360 --> 02:49:47,840
Good luck.

4188
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:50,300
Good luck.

4189
02:49:50,540 --> 02:49:52,380
I own half of that side as well.

4190
02:49:54,980 --> 02:49:56,200
That's Death Row, right?

4191
02:49:56,960 --> 02:49:57,520
That's it.

4192
02:49:58,060 --> 02:49:58,320
Eight!

4193
02:49:58,740 --> 02:49:59,680
Oh, eight.

4194
02:50:01,220 --> 02:50:01,620
That's...

4195
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:03,060
How many houses is that?

4196
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:05,080
That's like more than one.

4197
02:50:08,320 --> 02:50:09,300
Fillion, I think it's time.

4198
02:50:09,460 --> 02:50:11,020
You don't have anything left.

4199
02:50:11,820 --> 02:50:12,080
Fillion?

4200
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:15,940
Wait, you actually don't have anything.

4201
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:17,020
Fillion.

4202
02:50:17,020 --> 02:50:18,820
I'm not bailing you out.

4203
02:50:21,900 --> 02:50:24,400
There's no bail out here, Fillion.

4204
02:50:27,540 --> 02:50:27,880
What?

4205
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:31,000
It's better on the other side.

4206
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:32,220
Check this one.

4207
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:42,940
I said go into the light Just accepted Philly Just end this
already Like the rope store is on that street Don't wait

4208
02:50:42,940 --> 02:50:56,600
Just end it I said check discord Just end it Check discord
I'll have to do it I'll have to do it Or this is Pippa's

4209
02:50:56,600 --> 02:51:04,520
choice because she got this is Pippa's choice Either we make
Philly and lose first now Wait, wait, Keith.

4210
02:51:06,520 --> 02:51:07,800
Phelan, I'll bail you out.

4211
02:51:08,380 --> 02:51:09,380
But you have to give me something.

4212
02:51:10,060 --> 02:51:10,960
What does she have?

4213
02:51:11,900 --> 02:51:12,500
You want my effing fridge?

4214
02:51:12,500 --> 02:51:13,060
Not much.

4215
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:13,860
Okay.

4216
02:51:15,220 --> 02:51:15,940
Let's see.

4217
02:51:17,100 --> 02:51:17,420
I don't know.

4218
02:51:17,420 --> 02:51:18,500
Start offering stuff, actually.

4219
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:19,300
You're the one who needs me.

4220
02:51:19,300 --> 02:51:19,880
Okay, I'll tell you a joke.

4221
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:21,960
No, I don't want a joke.

4222
02:51:22,100 --> 02:51:22,560
Your jokes are bad.

4223
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:22,860
What does it mean?

4224
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,700
You want a brick wall.

4225
02:51:24,320 --> 02:51:24,600
Nope.

4226
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:25,020
Nope.

4227
02:51:25,300 --> 02:51:26,300
A brick gets laid first.

4228
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:26,880
Not laughing.

4229
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:28,480
Not laughing.

4230
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:29,180
Not funny.

4231
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:30,280
Uh-huh.

4232
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:32,140
Zoomer humor doesn't work on me.

4233
02:51:32,260 --> 02:51:32,520
Next.

4234
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:33,480
Okay.

4235
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:34,800
All right.

4236
02:51:39,160 --> 02:51:39,580
Um...

4237
02:51:39,580 --> 02:51:41,920
This game would be ended like an hour ago.

4238
02:51:42,020 --> 02:51:42,760
Not gonna lie.

4239
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:44,420
If I didn't do all those bailouts.

4240
02:51:44,620 --> 02:51:45,080
I'm not done yet.

4241
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:45,600
True?

4242
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:46,560
I'm not done yet.

4243
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:49,580
All I'm saying is that we could end this game earlier.

4244
02:51:50,140 --> 02:51:52,280
I'm the only reason why I'm feeling so nice.

4245
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:53,800
Because I keep doing bailouts.

4246
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:54,660
I'm doing the tweet.

4247
02:51:55,800 --> 02:51:55,940
Nope.

4248
02:51:56,780 --> 02:51:57,180
All right.

4249
02:51:57,260 --> 02:51:58,060
You're out of the game, Philean.

4250
02:51:58,700 --> 02:51:59,120
Fine.

4251
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:00,180
I mean, what else?

4252
02:52:01,080 --> 02:52:02,440
What else am I gonna do?

4253
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:03,260
Philean.

4254
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:04,100
Philean.

4255
02:52:04,760 --> 02:52:06,520
Make the tweet your YouTube banner.

4256
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:07,580
I'll bell you up.

4257
02:52:07,900 --> 02:52:08,760
I'm doing this tweet.

4258
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:10,040
That's too honest.

4259
02:52:10,100 --> 02:52:11,380
No, make it your YouTube banner.

4260
02:52:11,500 --> 02:52:12,360
Make it your YouTube banner.

4261
02:52:12,540 --> 02:52:13,160
I don't know how to do that.

4262
02:52:13,380 --> 02:52:14,220
Don't lie.

4263
02:52:14,340 --> 02:52:15,180
You can't lie.

4264
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:16,400
You can't lie.

4265
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:17,280
You damn well know.

4266
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:19,220
I don't know how.

4267
02:52:19,220 --> 02:52:20,100
You're a liar.

4268
02:52:20,780 --> 02:52:22,240
I don't know how.

4269
02:52:23,480 --> 02:52:23,840
Okay.

4270
02:52:24,040 --> 02:52:24,140
I don't know how.

4271
02:52:24,140 --> 02:52:26,920
Then you make a YouTube video recording yourself, reading
the tweet.

4272
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:27,500
Okay.

4273
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:28,220
What am I effing?

4274
02:52:28,380 --> 02:52:28,960
I can't make that joke.

4275
02:52:28,980 --> 02:52:30,020
Make it a short too.

4276
02:52:30,120 --> 02:52:32,020
Make it a short because she has more viewers than your
viewers.

4277
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:33,160
Oh, basically I'm being sponsored.

4278
02:52:33,220 --> 02:52:34,480
I've been sponsored quite often.

4279
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:38,240
Okay, I'll delete this joke.

4280
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:39,100
Trick me, dude.

4281
02:52:39,220 --> 02:52:41,520
The most engagement is her shorts to geek it.

4282
02:52:42,420 --> 02:52:44,140
This will be her biggest short ever.

4283
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:46,120
You'll make $3 on it.

4284
02:52:47,440 --> 02:52:48,200
Too late.

4285
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:49,120
I made a decision.

4286
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:50,100
Oh?

4287
02:52:50,620 --> 02:52:51,020
All right.

4288
02:52:51,380 --> 02:52:51,840
All right.

4289
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:53,000
Time to bankrupt.

4290
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:55,080
Press the button, Phyllian.

4291
02:52:55,340 --> 02:52:56,020
Press the button, Phyllian.

4292
02:52:56,800 --> 02:52:57,680
Any last offers?

4293
02:52:57,700 --> 02:52:58,240
It's over for you.

4294
02:52:58,620 --> 02:52:58,820
No.

4295
02:52:59,000 --> 02:52:59,580
No, we...

4296
02:52:59,580 --> 02:52:59,740
No.

4297
02:53:00,040 --> 02:53:02,840
If Lumi even has an offer, she can't afford your bail.

4298
02:53:02,860 --> 02:53:04,240
I can't even fucking help you, man.

4299
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:06,820
The only people can afford is me and Pippa.

4300
02:53:08,340 --> 02:53:10,060
All right, you burned the bridges.

4301
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:11,640
Yeah, you burned all your bridges, Phyllian.

4302
02:53:12,200 --> 02:53:13,620
I knew I shouldn't have been PewDiePie.

4303
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:15,080
What?

4304
02:53:15,140 --> 02:53:16,500
It's about down to our corporate.

4305
02:53:16,700 --> 02:53:18,180
All right, I hovered over it.

4306
02:53:18,440 --> 02:53:18,960
Put a precedent.

4307
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:21,020
Let's try your cat girl while she's down.

4308
02:53:21,960 --> 02:53:23,180
It's put an honor, your honor.

4309
02:53:23,700 --> 02:53:26,100
I don't know what I'm saying.

4310
02:53:26,820 --> 02:53:27,740
So I just hit the button.

4311
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:28,000
It's over.

4312
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:28,820
Yeah, it says over.

4313
02:53:29,480 --> 02:53:29,800
Do it.

4314
02:53:29,860 --> 02:53:30,660
Yeah, I'm gonna hit it.

4315
02:53:30,680 --> 02:53:31,740
Unless you want to make that short.

4316
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:33,540
Are you sure you want to make that short?

4317
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:34,440
Yes, click yes.

4318
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:34,740
Come on.

4319
02:53:37,340 --> 02:53:49,340

02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:01,760
philian how do you feel about that it was funny oh finally
the game can end

4322
02:54:07,800 --> 02:54:09,700
I can happily die now.

4323
02:54:09,780 --> 02:54:10,420
I'm good.

4324
02:54:10,780 --> 02:54:11,620
Chat, what's the point?

4325
02:54:13,980 --> 02:54:15,380
What's within the point of it all?

4326
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:17,000
You gotta draw a card.

4327
02:54:17,660 --> 02:54:21,400
I haven't died in a factory on the cold floor.

4328
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:23,300
You didn't have to.

4329
02:54:23,420 --> 02:54:24,160
You made your choice.

4330
02:54:24,620 --> 02:54:25,860
She gave you a deal.

4331
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:29,940
You guys would not have made a YouTube short.

4332
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:32,480
That's on you.

4333
02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:33,460
I would have made the short.

4334
02:54:33,580 --> 02:54:34,380
I would have made it.

4335
02:54:34,900 --> 02:54:36,540
You're not only gonna do what it takes.

4336
02:54:36,880 --> 02:54:38,640
Yeah, we'll see when you lose two if you're gonna make it.

4337
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:40,400
Alright, I'll pay the 30 bucks.

4338
02:54:41,080 --> 02:54:42,300
That is 30.

4339
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:45,060
Chad, this is why it's hard to make friends with B2B.

4340
02:54:45,140 --> 02:54:46,640
I'm happy to help a friend with me.

4341
02:54:47,560 --> 02:54:48,700
Let's go see your bail bonds.

4342
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:49,900
We're gonna collab together.

4343
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:52,380
Oh, not doubles.

4344
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:53,180
I'm lucky.

4345
02:54:53,320 --> 02:54:55,400
I guess I'll stay in jail a little longer.

4346
02:54:56,040 --> 02:54:59,360
I guess I'll stay in jail a little bit longer.

4347
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:01,160
So unfortunate.

4348
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:03,880
Oh, Pippa.

4349
02:55:04,760 --> 02:55:07,120
Either I lose the PIP or a Philly or there's no...

4350
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:09,120
That's your own property, so it's fine.

4351
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:09,480
Yeah.

4352
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:10,260
Should we twiddle?

4353
02:55:10,500 --> 02:55:11,080
I'm dead.

4354
02:55:11,340 --> 02:55:12,740
I'm dead in a couple turns.

4355
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:15,600
Please, jail.

4356
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:17,580
Please let me have jail time.

4357
02:55:18,360 --> 02:55:19,320
You guys made a cult.

4358
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:21,260
You know, I'm muting myself to go cry.

4359
02:55:21,380 --> 02:55:23,100
I mean, talk to my chat.

4360
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:25,340
I can still hear you.

4361
02:55:25,400 --> 02:55:26,740
I want to talk to my chat.

4362
02:55:26,740 --> 02:55:27,320
Yay, money!

4363
02:55:28,140 --> 02:55:28,580
I should...

4364
02:55:28,580 --> 02:55:29,260
Oh, you know what?

4365
02:55:29,300 --> 02:55:30,960
I'm going to go build a little bit.

4366
02:55:32,940 --> 02:55:33,380
I'm going to...

4367
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:34,680
Okay, as long as I'm out last.

4368
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:36,200
Oh, I can't wait, I can build.

4369
02:55:36,320 --> 02:55:38,320
Alright, let's build a little bit here.

4370
02:55:38,560 --> 02:55:40,280
Since I'm in jail, I can still do real estate.

4371
02:55:40,860 --> 02:55:41,120
You know?

4372
02:55:41,700 --> 02:55:43,920
I can still do real estate while I'm here.

4373
02:55:43,940 --> 02:55:45,420
That's the power of the jail system.

4374
02:55:45,760 --> 02:55:45,780
Yeah.

4375
02:55:46,260 --> 02:55:47,800
Alright, we'll put a house here.

4376
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:49,340
And then we'll put a house here.

4377
02:55:49,500 --> 02:55:49,980
Good luck.

4378
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:50,460
Uh-oh.

4379
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:51,660
Good luck, Looney.

4380
02:55:52,580 --> 02:55:53,360
Good luck.

4381
02:55:54,460 --> 02:55:56,920
And then, I'm ready to roll my die.

4382
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:58,280
Ooh.

4383
02:55:59,420 --> 02:55:59,640
Yeah.

4384
02:56:01,300 --> 02:56:02,420
It just works.

4385
02:56:03,460 --> 02:56:04,560
It just works.

4386
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:05,800
Oh my god.

4387
02:56:05,800 --> 02:56:06,380
Thanks, Todd.

4388
02:56:07,140 --> 02:56:07,400
Oh my god.

4389
02:56:08,260 --> 02:56:08,800
Oh, no.

4390
02:56:09,860 --> 02:56:12,580
Oh, I guess I gotta pay a fine on my own.

4391
02:56:12,680 --> 02:56:14,000
Oh, I'm on my own property.

4392
02:56:14,180 --> 02:56:15,180
Hey there, guys.

4393
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:16,420
Hey.

4394
02:56:16,700 --> 02:56:18,060
This is so illegal.

4395
02:56:19,240 --> 02:56:21,320
Don't get owes you a free railroad fare.

4396
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:22,620
I'm hungry, man.

4397
02:56:22,900 --> 02:56:23,580
Come on, dude.

4398
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:24,660
Just kill me.

4399
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:26,200
Don't be taking out bags.

4400
02:56:26,260 --> 02:56:27,440
Shoot me in the fucking head.

4401
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:30,120
You guys are all just surviving right now.

4402
02:56:31,880 --> 02:56:33,500
But that they got none of it.

4403
02:56:34,100 --> 02:56:34,480
Take me out back, man.

4404
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:35,940
I can model crap.

4405
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:37,540
Just declare bankruptcy now.

4406
02:56:37,580 --> 02:56:38,160
This cruel world.

4407
02:56:38,500 --> 02:56:40,260
Just declare bankruptcy.

4408
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:42,200
That's all you have to do.

4409
02:56:42,360 --> 02:56:42,480
Please, please, please.

4410
02:56:42,620 --> 02:56:42,800
Come on.

4411
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:44,940
Free parking, free parking, free parking, free parking.

4412
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:45,620
Free parking.

4413
02:56:46,680 --> 02:56:47,200
Where's that?

4414
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:48,380
What is it?

4415
02:56:48,440 --> 02:56:48,800
What is it?

4416
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:49,240
That's me.

4417
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:50,800
That's green.

4418
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:53,580
That's the house I just built.

4419
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,160
Goodbye.

4420
02:56:56,880 --> 02:56:57,920
You have to have to go.

4421
02:56:58,360 --> 02:57:01,100
I don't think I can even afford with mortgage.

4422
02:57:01,680 --> 02:57:04,580
She can't afford it even with a mortgage.

4423
02:57:04,760 --> 02:57:07,400
I literally can't, I can't afford anything.

4424
02:57:08,140 --> 02:57:08,920
Goodbye, homie.

4425
02:57:09,180 --> 02:57:10,400
I literally can't fucking afford shit.

4426
02:57:11,180 --> 02:57:12,880
It was a good run, boys.

4427
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:15,340
Billy had moved over in the cock chair.

4428
02:57:15,480 --> 02:57:16,400
I'm coming, okay?

4429
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:20,820
Well, I mean, then you won't even need to be in the cock
chair.

4430
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:23,660
Like, we can, we, okay, yeah, yeah, true, true, true.

4431
02:57:23,760 --> 02:57:24,020
All right.

4432
02:57:24,020 --> 02:57:25,220
It's bankrupt time.

4433
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:26,760
It's bankrupt time.

4434
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:27,760
At least I'm on my last face.

4435
02:57:29,440 --> 02:57:29,960
All right.

4436
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:31,140
Leroy Jenkins.

4437
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:34,740
I mean, with all those bailouts, it'd be pretty
embarrassing, B.

4438
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:36,380
That's crazy!

4439
02:57:37,740 --> 02:57:40,140
Wait, Doki just gets my properties?

4440
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:43,140
Yeah, because you couldn't pay off, so I take your property.

4441
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:45,300
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

4442
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:46,200
Ask me anything.

4443
02:57:49,400 --> 02:57:50,940
Alright, Pippa, what you got?

4444
02:57:51,360 --> 02:57:52,240
Look at that.

4445
02:57:53,980 --> 02:57:54,920
There's me.

4446
02:57:56,380 --> 02:57:59,640
Wait, so you have everything some little yellow.

4447
02:57:59,980 --> 02:58:03,080
Wait, Pippa, do you have any more yellow?

4448
02:58:04,020 --> 02:58:04,740
Does everything have some yellow?

4449
02:58:04,760 --> 02:58:06,820
I could get on yellow and then I'd lose.

4450
02:58:06,920 --> 02:58:07,640
Wait, no, I can mortgage.

4451
02:58:07,880 --> 02:58:08,520
You want, like, $5.

4452
02:58:09,060 --> 02:58:09,980
I can mortgage, though.

4453
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:11,080
The brown isn't worth anything.

4454
02:58:11,120 --> 02:58:12,100
Yeah, it's not worth much.

4455
02:58:12,120 --> 02:58:12,880
Brown isn't worth anything.

4456
02:58:13,100 --> 02:58:15,500
She's surviving by, like, the...

4457
02:58:15,500 --> 02:58:15,960
Yeah, $4.

4458
02:58:16,440 --> 02:58:17,060
End of my teeth.

4459
02:58:17,460 --> 02:58:18,220
Friends of benefits.

4460
02:58:18,980 --> 02:58:19,880
All right, here you go.

4461
02:58:20,140 --> 02:58:21,260
I might get the yellow, though.

4462
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:21,620
You got this.

4463
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:23,000
All you got to do is bankrupt her.

4464
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:23,880
Fuck.

4465
02:58:24,660 --> 02:58:25,780
Do I go to jail again?

4466
02:58:26,740 --> 02:58:28,100
Pippa, you're the last one to jail again.

4467
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:30,580
I know, it's like, it was funny if I go to jail again.

4468
02:58:31,300 --> 02:58:31,700

We live in a society.

Yeah, you can still go to jail.

4484

I'm not making it to jail.

4485
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:31,800
You can almost get there.

4486
02:59:31,820 --> 02:59:33,040
Wait, $7, $7.

4487
02:59:33,220 --> 02:59:33,900
I didn't write this.

4488
02:59:34,060 --> 02:59:34,620
It just happened to me.

Yeah, I can still land on yellow.

4495
02:59:43,760 --> 02:59:45,900
Yeah, and he's tired of laughing around the board later.

4496
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:48,680
It's okay, Timma, you got this.

4497
02:59:49,220 --> 02:59:49,460
Why?

4498
02:59:49,960 --> 02:59:52,960
I don't want you throwing me on.

4499
02:59:53,060 --> 02:59:53,780
Oh, hey, 200.

4500
02:59:53,780 --> 02:59:56,260
I want you to win because she just doesn't want me to win.

4501
02:59:56,580 --> 02:59:58,680
It just doesn't want me to win.

4502
03:00:00,020 --> 03:00:00,880
Alright, let's see.

4503
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:02,420

4504
03:00:02,580 --> 03:00:02,900
Oh, fuck.

4505
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:03,300
Jesus.

4506
03:00:05,280 --> 03:00:06,640
She's like an actual murderer.

4507
03:00:06,660 --> 03:00:09,200
You're gonna die regardless when you land on the red here.

4508
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:10,870
I'm gonna...

4509

Oh no, not the millionaires.

How many more millionaires must fall?

4512
03:00:15,240 --> 03:00:16,880
Oh no, not the millionaires.

4513
03:00:19,740 --> 03:00:22,120
Those fucking poor millionaires.

4514
03:00:25,460 --> 03:00:26,960

You can't...

4526
03:01:11,520 --> 03:01:13,940
You have to sell each house.

4527
03:01:14,080 --> 03:01:15,920
There's a one more three, so you have to sell that.

4528
03:01:16,540 --> 03:01:17,400
And then you gotta sell.

4529
03:01:18,100 --> 03:01:19,540
And then you gotta keep selling.

4530
03:01:19,840 --> 03:01:20,560
Oh, it hurts to watch.

4531
03:01:20,560 --> 03:01:22,380

03:01:27,380 --> 03:01:27,380
It's okay.

4536
03:01:27,400 --> 03:01:28,240
One more house.

4538
03:01:28,980 --> 03:01:30,760
Yeah, you can afford it now.

I forgot how...

4544
03:01:38,300 --> 03:01:40,040
Now you can afford it.

4545
03:01:40,140 --> 03:01:41,760
It's been an honor serving with you, Pippa.

4546
03:01:42,600 --> 03:01:43,320
She's still alive!

4547
03:01:43,340 --> 03:01:44,060
Look, damn it!

4548
03:01:46,240 --> 03:01:48,420
It's like I can still get into jail.

4549
03:01:48,580 --> 03:01:50,720
You can still get into jail.

4550
03:01:50,940 --> 03:01:51,280
Don't worry.

4551
03:01:53,080 --> 03:01:53,400
Yay!

4552
03:01:55,100 --> 03:01:56,140
Oh my god.

4553
03:01:56,400 --> 03:01:57,580
Seven, where's that?

4554
03:01:58,060 --> 03:01:58,880
Oh hey, there's chance.

4555
03:01:59,000 --> 03:01:59,960
Maybe I can get to jail.

4556
03:02:00,740 --> 03:02:02,060
Yeah, I could just click out of the game.

4557
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:04,740
If I just tab out of the game, no one will.

4558
03:02:04,760 --> 03:02:05,060
Oh!

4559
03:02:05,960 --> 03:02:06,460
Yay!

4560
03:02:06,900 --> 03:02:08,200
You have to go to jail!

4561
03:02:10,280 --> 03:02:12,240
It's a living honor in one house.

4562
03:02:12,480 --> 03:02:13,920
Where is she going next?

4563
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:15,660
I'm wondering, Your Honor.

4564
03:02:15,740 --> 03:02:16,540
Let her go!

4565
03:02:16,660 --> 03:02:18,000
Where is she going next, though?

4566
03:02:18,160 --> 03:02:18,960
Oh, it's all right.

4567
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:21,880
Okay, here we go.

4568
03:02:22,400 --> 03:02:24,260
We're gonna put a green here.

4569
03:02:24,760 --> 03:02:26,140
And then also here.

4570
03:02:26,340 --> 03:02:28,520
Bro, she's buying houses from jail!

4571
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:32,980
Oh!

4572
03:02:37,720 --> 03:02:39,420
She's like, she's on the Joker, bro.

4573
03:02:39,580 --> 03:02:40,640
She's so cold with shots.

4574
03:02:40,700 --> 03:02:41,620
I called out to you.

4575
03:02:41,680 --> 03:02:42,920
It's rich person jail.

4576
03:02:43,560 --> 03:02:44,840
It's rich person jail.

4577
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:48,000
Okay, guys.

4578
03:02:49,220 --> 03:02:51,060
You can lie in jail, too.

4579
03:02:51,480 --> 03:02:52,160
Oh, the society.

4580
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:56,280
Oh, she's one spot away from jail.

4581
03:02:57,800 --> 03:03:00,000
Oh, hey, I just bought houses there, too.

4582
03:03:00,420 --> 03:03:01,280
What a coincidence.

4583
03:03:01,580 --> 03:03:01,980
You hear that?

4584
03:03:02,040 --> 03:03:02,940
The police are coming.

4585
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:05,700
Can you afford?

4586
03:03:05,840 --> 03:03:06,680
Wait, mortgage everything.

4587
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:08,260
You can still mortgage everything.

4588
03:03:08,720 --> 03:03:09,980
You can mortgage everything.

4589
03:03:10,280 --> 03:03:10,400
Yeah.

4590
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:11,140
See?

4591
03:03:11,360 --> 03:03:12,100
You can afford it now.

4592
03:03:12,100 --> 03:03:13,520
Hang on for dear life, Fibba.

4593
03:03:16,240 --> 03:03:17,880
There you go.

4594
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:19,500
Is that...

4595
03:03:19,500 --> 03:03:19,720
Fuck.

4596
03:03:20,060 --> 03:03:21,580
You need to mortgage one more.

4597
03:03:21,980 --> 03:03:23,380
This is so grim.

4598
03:03:24,280 --> 03:03:25,040
There you go.

4599
03:03:25,540 --> 03:03:26,660
Oh, fuck no.

4600
03:03:27,020 --> 03:03:28,680
I don't think you can afford it.

4601
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:29,720
You get one more.

4602
03:03:29,820 --> 03:03:31,460
She's only one more mortgage.

4603
03:03:31,660 --> 03:03:32,460
And then she can.

4604
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:33,720
Oh, brother.

4605
03:03:34,360 --> 03:03:35,320
There you go.

4606
03:03:35,960 --> 03:03:36,840
Come on.

4607
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,600
That last mortgage is looking at you.

4608
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:41,060
You gotta mortgage it.

4609
03:03:41,180 --> 03:03:42,400
You gotta mortgage it.

4610
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:43,640
You gotta also train with Doki.

4611
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,460
I can't even afford her.

4612
03:03:47,180 --> 03:03:48,760
I can't even afford it.

4613
03:03:51,940 --> 03:03:52,700
Oh, my God.

4614
03:03:53,120 --> 03:03:53,420
Time to turn.

4615
03:03:54,140 --> 03:03:56,120
Oh, my gosh.

4616
03:03:56,280 --> 03:03:56,980
I'm in jail.

4617
03:03:57,220 --> 03:03:58,720
How could this happen to me?

4618
03:03:59,100 --> 03:04:00,280
This is your rocky arc.

4619
03:04:00,460 --> 03:04:00,880
Don't worry.

4620
03:04:01,020 --> 03:04:02,300
How could I be in jail?

4621
03:04:02,380 --> 03:04:03,760
Oh, it's so unfortunate.

4622
03:04:04,060 --> 03:04:05,300
I can't even leave jail.

4623
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:06,780
Oh, man.

You got saved!

Oh my god.

4632

Oh my fucking god.

4633
03:04:48,780 --> 03:04:51,240
How about that?

4634
03:04:51,300 --> 03:04:52,380
Wow, I feel good.

4635
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:54,640
You're gonna cross the drain.

4636
03:04:54,820 --> 03:04:56,300
You're gonna cross clear bankruptcy.

4637
03:04:57,180 --> 03:04:57,460
Pippa!

4638
03:04:57,580 --> 03:04:59,540
You can't lose right now.

4639
03:04:59,720 --> 03:05:00,360
You can't lose right now.

4640
03:05:00,780 --> 03:05:01,420
You can't just give up.

4641
03:05:01,720 --> 03:05:02,960
You're so good, Pippa, don't worry.

4642
03:05:03,180 --> 03:05:04,440
I'm rubbing your shoulders.

4643
03:05:05,060 --> 03:05:06,340
You're still in this fight, Pippa.

4644
03:05:06,480 --> 03:05:09,080
One more Don't touch me with your loser hand.

4645
03:05:10,020 --> 03:05:11,440
Maybe that's why.

4646
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:14,480
Oh, hey.

4647
03:05:14,680 --> 03:05:16,480
That's the one I just put your house on.

4648
03:05:16,640 --> 03:05:17,140
It's okay.

4649
03:05:17,360 --> 03:05:17,880
It's okay.

4650
03:05:18,260 --> 03:05:18,920
It's not worth anything.

4651
03:05:19,060 --> 03:05:20,140
Yeah, it's just $20.

4652
03:05:20,720 --> 03:05:22,760
You have an epic holiday in right now.

4653
03:05:23,360 --> 03:05:23,780
You're good.

4654
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:24,600
Yeah, you're good.

4655
03:05:24,900 --> 03:05:25,920
The cockroach is playing right there.

4656
03:05:27,140 --> 03:05:27,660
Wee.

4657
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:31,620
Oh, I don't have it.

4658
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:32,440
It's okay.

4659
03:05:33,020 --> 03:05:35,180
I gotta get a jail free card.

4660
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:35,720
Oh.

4661
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:36,840
That's my place.

4662
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:37,380
Isn't it?

4663
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:38,580
Oh, it is.

4664
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:39,600
Hey there.

4665
03:05:42,360 --> 03:05:43,960
Why is it so hard, huh?

4666
03:05:45,260 --> 03:05:46,200
It's alright.

4667
03:05:46,540 --> 03:05:49,060
She still has, like, a long way to go.

4668
03:05:50,420 --> 03:05:51,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4669
03:05:51,540 --> 03:05:52,420
For sure, for sure.

4670

We got this.

4671
03:05:54,340 --> 03:05:55,140
I believe in you.

4672
03:05:55,480 --> 03:05:55,500
Wait, Pivot.

4673
03:05:55,620 --> 03:05:56,480
We need to negotiate.

4674
03:05:57,020 --> 03:05:57,600
Part of the deal.

4675
03:05:57,900 --> 03:06:01,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

4676
03:06:04,660 --> 03:06:05,740
You can afford to un-mortgage?

4677
03:06:06,240 --> 03:06:06,980
All you gotta do is...

4678
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:23,660
It would be a shame if you landed on my place again Yeah
Yeah It would be such a shame It would suck Wow Hey you get

dokeybird was in that jail

4681
03:06:40,260 --> 03:06:43,440
You can buy souvenirs for like $75.

4682
03:06:44,100 --> 03:06:45,480
You can still spend $150.

4683
03:06:46,800 --> 03:06:46,980
This.

4684
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:48,360
You should mortgage it.

4685
03:06:48,500 --> 03:06:49,900
Okay, I'm going to need you to roll too.

4686
03:06:50,020 --> 03:06:51,980

Her souvenirs.

4688
03:06:53,140 --> 03:06:55,300

You're fine.

Don't worry about it.

You're going to be okay, people.

4699
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:10,180
What's the worst that can happen on the community chest?

4700
03:07:11,160 --> 03:07:12,320
Wait, how much does it cost us?

4701
03:07:13,360 --> 03:07:15,240
It's like only 130, so like it's fine.

4702
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:17,540
It's like...

4703
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:19,200
You're about to Morgan.

4704
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:21,060
A boy was an old thing.

4705
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:25,120
She's calculating right now.

4706
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:26,260
Yeah!

4707
03:07:29,100 --> 03:07:32,780
That whole time she gets $24 from me.

4708
03:07:33,160 --> 03:07:36,300
That $24 is gonna be so much.

4709
03:07:37,460 --> 03:07:39,160
Yeah, she's gonna leave!

4710
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:39,840
Goodbye.

4711
03:07:40,620 --> 03:07:40,940
Goodbye.

4712
03:07:42,420 --> 03:07:43,360
He's the mortgage!

4713
03:07:44,740 --> 03:07:49,160
Yeah, if you mortgage, you can afford it!

4714
03:07:49,240 --> 03:07:51,220
If you mortgage, you can afford it!

4715
03:07:51,540 --> 03:07:51,620
Oh my god.

4716
03:07:51,620 --> 03:07:54,120
Oh my god.

4717
03:07:54,220 --> 03:07:55,820

Thank you.

4719
03:07:59,640 --> 03:08:00,620
That'll be so funny.

4720
03:08:01,560 --> 03:08:02,900
Chad, it's not over till the last man sings.

4721
03:08:03,140 --> 03:08:03,420
You're still in this.

4722
03:08:03,460 --> 03:08:04,080
You're still in this.

4723
03:08:04,100 --> 03:08:04,740
Yeah, you're still in this.

4724
03:08:07,420 --> 03:08:07,900
Yeah?

4725
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:10,200
Do I land on your space again?

4726
03:08:10,580 --> 03:08:12,200
That's your own space, right?

4727
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:13,220

Chad, I wasn't saying boardwalk when I rolled to get it.

To be fair.

4898
03:16:16,900 --> 03:16:19,800
This is our exit plan from streaming, man.

4899
03:16:19,820 --> 03:16:20,700
Like five years.

4900
03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:24,220
When we're old and no one gives a frick anymore, what are we
going to have?

4901
03:16:24,780 --> 03:16:25,540
I rather like...

4902
03:16:25,540 --> 03:16:26,780
This is your Amaranth gas station.

4903
03:16:27,020 --> 03:16:27,800
Oh, Bramps.

4904
03:16:28,240 --> 03:16:33,580
Okay, to be fair, like after what we saw, how you we saw you
conduct business i don't think i want to invest in anything

4905
03:16:33,580 --> 03:16:41,060
that you offer okay how about you okay okay then short my
stock nerd short my stock nerd see what happens game stop of

4906

think they'll let you i don't think they'll allow you to be

4908
03:16:52,900 --> 03:17:00,420
on the stock market because how we need more than like three
steps into the stock market and phase is not being that but

4909
03:17:00,420 --> 03:17:05,240

4939
03:19:28,620 --> 03:19:33,860
wow that stream could have ended like an hour ago if i
didn't prolong it for so long

4940
03:19:37,520 --> 03:19:45,460
guys sorry i i know i have a second stream today but like i

4941
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:56,320
look i just i'm just saying look i know we could have ended
we could have like let them go from their misery but like i

4942
03:19:56,320 --> 03:20:04,020
just wanted a specific person to lose first um I did not
expect to win Monopoly, not gonna lie.

4943
03:20:04,100 --> 03:20:09,140
I haven't played Monopoly in so long, but like, it's
actually pretty funny when I can, I was like, you know, what

4944
03:20:09,140 --> 03:20:09,740
was that word?

4945
03:20:10,040 --> 03:20:14,720
When you put your foot in a door, where you negotiate for
something much higher than what you actually want, and they

4946
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:18,720
actually did that, did that, and I was like, guys, that's
basic business 101.

4947
03:20:19,280 --> 03:20:19,940
What the fuck?

4948
03:20:30,680 --> 03:20:37,300
great i had a great time um i agree time i guess like
winning is always a good time so that's why i had

4949
03:20:41,360 --> 03:20:52,420
i always have a good time winning you know it's always a
blast uh but yeah um we do have a second stream we do have a

4950
03:20:52,420 --> 03:20:59,360
second stream tonight with follow i'm gonna uh i'm gonna
push the stream uh up by 15 minutes just so i can like chill

4951
03:20:59,360 --> 03:21:03,640
a little bit because i didn't realized I'd play like three
plus hours of Monopoly.

4952
03:21:04,400 --> 03:21:12,980
Also guys I literally okay it was so funny because like I
told I I want to be like I told you so because like I I told

4953
03:21:12,980 --> 03:21:19,080
them about like yeah like there's like online issues with
Monopoly because I know like people had to in the past we

4954
03:21:19,080 --> 03:21:26,500
would have I remember like people like to get around with it
like someone would like screen share or something or like I

4955
03:21:26,500 --> 03:21:32,840
don't remember I don't think I've done remote play before
but I don't haven't of others they would like screen share

4956
03:21:32,840 --> 03:21:38,900
monopoly and then like um and then like they'll like say
what move they want to do and then they'll do the moves and

4957
03:21:38,900 --> 03:21:43,540
stuff like that so like i knew there was that option and
then there was like remote play so i was like guys i think

4958
03:21:43,540 --> 03:21:51,280
we gotta like don't use online feature because there's a
huge online issue and i like brought that up like like two

4959
03:21:51,280 --> 03:21:58,080
to three i think like three times and then we went in i was
like guys i told i told you guys

4960
03:22:01,600 --> 03:22:12,480
I was like I told you guys there's online issues I don't
know I think the funniest part is that Phyllian literally

4961
03:22:12,480 --> 03:22:23,820
forgot the time that she set up because I was like me, Pippa
and Lumi were watching the stream and then like we saw her

4962
03:22:23,820 --> 03:22:30,440
on like Bunny Girl and then we saw her like she was like why
are they 30 minutes early like what the fuck is going on

4963
03:22:30,440 --> 03:22:37,900
like what's wrong with them and then i had to i copied and
paste the exact time she told us to show up and it was like

4964
03:22:37,900 --> 03:22:38,780
2 30.

4965
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:53,000
