00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:55,610
It's a little scuffed But that's how we like it here Sorry,
I need to like re redo this.

14
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,050
Okay, this is a little awkward.

15
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:11,490
Okay, give me a sec All right, we gotta do this and then
make sure everything is properly situated the way um i don't

16
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:19,150
know if it's me i mean it could be me honestly at this point
but like this game does not have full screen yet i think

17
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,930
it's because of that it's an alpha i hope it's just because
it's like an alpha test so like it's only in windowed mode

18
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:35,790
or like it's literally only in i have no choice like it's
it's literally only in windowed mode so like um so like uh

19
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:46,310
can't make But yes, surprise stream, because I got into, I
got into the Marvel Rivals Alpha Test.

20
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,850
I don't know, is Sound Guy here?

21
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,130
Mario, thank you for the Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

22
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,290
Your real friends?

23
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,990
The real rivals were the friends we made along the way.

24
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,790
Thank you for the Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

25
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,810
I don't know.

26
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,370
I don't know if Sound Guy is here today, or are we going to
have an anarchy when it comes to sound balancing?

27
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,290
So we're going to find out very soon.

28
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,470
It feels like Sound Guy is not here.

29
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,910
Just because, like, just because they didn't rate.

30
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,050
Wait, no, they're online.

31
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,790
I see you online on Discord Sound Guy.

32
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,530
Swap to your Sound Guy mod account right now.

33
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,590
But yes, I got into the closed alpha.

34
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,630
I know it wasn't in my schedule, but, like, it's the first
day, so I had to play it.

35
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,350
It's basically, like, Overwatch, but, like, what if it's,
like, Marvelous superheroes and villains instead?

36
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,630
So, um, so, uh, just, like, imagine, and it's six, it's,
it's, like, Overwatch 1, because it's six, six, six players

37
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,210
in the team.

38
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,870
So, it's literally OG Overwatch 1 with six players instead
of five.

39
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,870
I assume it'll be, like, two tanks, two supports, two DPS.

40
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,370
Um, it's so funny because, uh, there's no, no, there's no
NDA for Alpha.

41
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,290
It was just, they're just like, stream it if you want.

42
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,470
And I'm like, cool.

43
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,590
But like, you know, I was looking through it.

44
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,670
I didn't sign any NDA.

45
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,690
I just got a key.

46
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,130
Anyway, I'm really excited.

47
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,210
It's like, it's closed alpha.

48
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,810
And they, I knew a person, like, somebody reached out to me.

49
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,770
Because did you read the fine print?

50
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,450
Well, the first mistake is thinking that I read.

51
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,490
Like, yeah.

52
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:47,790
the act you're right this is overwatch 2 this is what
overwatch 2 was supposed to be i'm just like hoping it's

53
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:55,470
good i'm actually like please be good please be fucking good
that's all i want that's literally all i want i just want an

54
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:05,310

when i you know when i tweeted it i was like can I please

55
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,450
have an alpha key marble rivals someone um someone reached
out to me because they knew the community manager in marble

56
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,890
rivals so they reached out to me and be like oh yeah I know
this person in my like community manager in marble rivals we

57
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:25,090

like yay and then that's how I got in it was so funny

58
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:32,630
because the moment I posted like my like posted the waiting
room and stuff like that like so many people like DM me

59
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,970
Like, a lot of my, like, streamer friends and, like,
pro-player friends, like, DM me.

60
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,510
It was, like, how did you get in, Marvel Rival?

61
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,130
And I was like, do you think you could help us get in?

62
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,170
I was just like, I don't know.

63
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,510
I mean, I can ask.

64
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,610
I don't know.

65
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,910
Like, I got in because, like, somebody reached out to me and
said they'll give me a key.

66
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,390
So, like, oh, I don't know.

67
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,110
I'll try.

68
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,550
It was so funny.

69
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,190
Like, everybody was, like, reaching out to me.

70
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,190
How did you get in?

71
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,890
I'm like, nepotism, baby.

72
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,990
The Doki privilege.

73
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,010
Sound guy, where the fuck are you?

74
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,430
I know you're here.

75
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,490
Are you here to balance for me?

76
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,250
All right.

77
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,990
Okay, it's going to be a little bit of an anarchy because I
don't know if Sound guy's actually here.

78
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,650
So, how's the sound so far?

79
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,630
Let's get in.

80
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,950
Logged in.

81
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,330
All right.

82
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,310
Oh my god!

83
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:43,350
I can actually have my own name because nobody else is I
swear if somebody else has an alpha test and stole my

84
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:58,670
fucking name I swear to me I swear if someone else was also
in the alpha test and purposely took my name I swear the

85
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:07,510
fucking God this is also the reason why I can't use my name
and any of the games these days because people already took

86
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:18,810
doky doky bird it's like i got to fucking use the real
female real female doky all right yay okay thank god thank

87
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:30,930
fucking god i was like i swear how do i know what's a tank
all classes what the fuck okay i assume vanguard vanguard

88
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,650
would be tank well obviously bruce bet oh my gosh Obviously,
Bruce Banner will be the tank.

89
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,750
Dr. Strange is a tank?

90
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,230
He's a fucking surgeon.

91
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,990
Wait, what?

92
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,090
Dr. Strange is a tank?

93
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,630
Alright.

94
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,470
Dr. Strange, difficulty, three stars, as a sorcerer supreme.

95
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,550
Ooh, wait, this is really cool.

96
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,170
I know, like, Groot Magnet...

97
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,410
Oh, Penny Parker.

98
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,910
Yeah, these guys make sense.

99
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,290
But Dr. Strange, he's a fucking wizard.

100
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,790
Like, fucking The Hulk can just break his back.

101
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,330
Oh, he's a four-star.

102
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,230
Brilliant Scientist, Doctor.

103
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:10,670
Oh, wait.

104
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,950
Is this, like, all the skins?

105
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,610
Oh, no.

106
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,710
This is, like, middle form between them.

107
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,390
And this is Ultimate Hulk.

108
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,110
And then there's, like, skinny-ass nerd.

109
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,730
And there's Groot.

110
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,510
That's so cool, though.

111
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,590
Seeing all the tanks and stuff.

112
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,310
Are you okay?

113
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,830
Blink, wanna smile if Kevin is pointing a gun to you, Ninja.

114
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,850
Thank you for the super chat.

115
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,170
Thank you.

116
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:30,870
Thank you.

117
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,090
Is he actually super OP now?

118
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,910
Dr. Strange?

119
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:43,910
comic lore oh he's like the easiest nice i love all the
animation so far oh my god he's so old now he has a beard i

120
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:53,290
only remember mike like michael fassbender magneto and oh my
gosh i'm so sorry is it eon mckellen is eon mckellen the

121
00:10:53,290 --> 00:11:03,190
other the older magneto the magneto is old as fuck the
master of magnet magnetism bends even the strongest meta oh

122
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:10,190
my god he's so fuck he's like the buffest fucking grandpa
out there what a buff grandpa and then there's penny parker

123
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:23,730
i remember her from the spider verse oh she's like diva
they're like we need diva it's like they're like okay

124
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:33,610
they're like overwatch we need we need a diva character
Overwatch why don't we use Penny Parker oh my god it's

125
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:42,210
literally it's literally a diva but for spiders yeah Penny
Parker may be young but she bravely stands on the front line

126
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:51,050
to protect the web of life yeah Marvel diva exactly what's
the team team up was like oh Ragnarok rebirth Asgardian

127
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:59,970
Soul's team up abilities yeah like if you have like certain
like characters picked have like special combos and stuff

128
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:08,230
too so uh the hell lands a final hit and defeating an enemy
she can instantly resurrect loki in the respawn phase if

129
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:15,210
loki is alive a crow flying to him granting a blue armor so
you can like have like team up so like do like meta like i

130
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:21,710
don't know what the meta is but like you can have like
specific this is not fair there's three team ups what the

131
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:30,150
fuck is the three team up uh you can bring up the overall
sound okay i'll bring up the overall sound uh all right

132
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:37,650
what's the three guys hawk charges dr strange and iron man
with gamma radiation when dr strange uses master he

133
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:44,730
unleashes excess gamma energy when iron man uses armor
overdrive he will initiate a gamma upgrade i feel like the

134
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:50,650
three combos might like this can actually be like super OP
because it's three people.

135
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,950
Three is more than two.

136
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,950
DPS tank.

137
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,110
I guess it makes the tank a DPS too, right?

138
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,670
Hulk charges Dr. Strange and Iron Man with gamma radiation.

139
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,350
When Dr. Strange uses Malstorm and Madness, he unleashes an
excess gamma energy.

140
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,870
When Iron Man uses armor overdrive, he will initiate a gamma
upgrade.

141
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,170
But Hulk gets nothing.

142
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,210
Isn't that passive?

143
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,310
He gets like passive.

144
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,930
Hulk charges Dr. Strange.

145
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,710
Oh, he gives them.

146
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:24,790
I guess like, if you have Hulk, I guess like Hulk is the
main tank and then Dr. Strange is off tank and then he like

147
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:33,050
gives the off tank and the DPS energy or something because
like he feeds them radiation because like as we all know a

148
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,970
little bit of radiation is okay.

149
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,370
Oh, it was wonders because like Hulk is sort of like, you
know, he's like fully radiated.

150
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:52,750
So like I'm just thinking like is this fucked up to say like
Wouldn't, like, being close to the Hulk potentially give you

151
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,130
cancer if you're, like, a normal person?

152
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,510
Because he's giving up...

153
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,630
He's giving up radiation.

154
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:06,910
Yeah.

155
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,630
It's...

156
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,610
But he has so much.

157
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,610

How is he a fucking support?

169
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,150
He's useless.

170
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,730
He is.

171
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,750

00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,110
How does that work?

210
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,630

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,530

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,630
He shoots like, yeah, they're all, oh my gosh, all of them
requires aim.

Holy fuck!

231
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,390
And then there's the emote.

232
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,810
Is that just a default?

233
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,290
And there's the spray.

234
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,370
What about the abilities?

235
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,830
Spider-Power?

236
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,570

241
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,430
apparently she flies

242
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:17,250
i like flying okay an omega level mutant oh her costume
isn't as cool though This feels like just a common variant.

243
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,870
Ooh.

244
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,390
Okay.

245
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,430
That's cool.

246
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,190
I like how, like, play the game is called MVP.

247
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,410
I think Spider-Man, I think Genji players are going to play
Spider-Man.

248
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:31,710
Honestly.

249
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,230
I feel like...

250
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,650
The 97...

251
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,810
Yeah, but it's not different.

252
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,690
It's not different.

253
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,490
It's just a recolor.

254
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,770
Like, literally, this is, like, default.

255
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,870
And then this is a recolor.

256
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,810
But it says 97 Storm.

257
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,210
But this is...

258
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,310
literally just a recolor.

259
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,330
Weather control.

260
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,490
Wait, I am flying.

261
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,110
Oh my god, I am flying.

262
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,090
What is this?

263
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,590
Switch the weather to empower allies.

264
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,910
Oh god, that is so confusing.

265
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,290
Switch the weather to empower allies.

266
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,410
Tornado grants a movement boost.

267
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,830
Thunder grants a damage boost.

268
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,070
So it's like when Lucio swaps from healing to speed.

269
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,270
You can control the weather around you for speed or damage.

270
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,850
Yeah, it's It's literally Lucio, but not a healer.

271
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,250
Found the power of the weather to empower storm.

272
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,350
Grenado Grand Slave.

273
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,310
Wait, that's the same thing.

274
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,690
Thunder Grand Slave damage boost and summons lightning to
inflict damage.

275
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,290
Wait, so this is, I guess, like a stronger version of
weather control.

276
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,050
Storm, yeah, Storm Lucio.

277
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,450
And then there's the lightning ball.

278
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,210
And then this draws in enemies.

279
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,970
All right, Lucio, but fly.

280
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,270
All right, who should we look at next, guys?

281
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,890
Who do we look at next?

282
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,310
I think she's always just flying.

283
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,150
I think so.

284
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,310
There doesn't seem to be a cooldown.

285
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,460
Maybe she grants us stronger.

286
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
Oh, look at magic.

287
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,540
She's new, right?

288
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,500
I've never heard of her before in Marvel.

289
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,850
Oh, this is awesome.

290
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,370
Wait, no.

291
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,770
Oh, what?

292
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,790
What the fuck?

293
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,010
Wait, is this like a different form of her?

294
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,250
Holy shit.

295
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,570
Who the fuck is she?

296
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,130
She's an OG?

297
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,550
I don't remember magic.

298
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,890
Oh, she turns into a demon.

299
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,350
Holy shit.

300
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,150
Okay, she's pretty cool.

301
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,970
And there's her emotes.

302
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,770
Ability.

303
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,170
See, Soul Sword.

304
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,430
There's Dark Child.

305
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,010
Gaining Enhancements to all.

306
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,250
Oh, this is when she transforms into a demon, right?

307
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,550
I'm pretty sure, yeah.

308
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,110
And the stepping disc, what's this?

309
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,870
Oh, wait, teleport.

310
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,290
Oh, you can, like, dodge alts with this.

311
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,910
Like, if somebody wants to, like, hit you, just dodge them
with a teleport.

312
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,290
Teleport's behind you.

313
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,150
And then, Umbrell, incursion.

314
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,450
Dash forward and launch an enemy upward.

315
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,030
Holy shit.

316
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,110
This is all, like...

317
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,930
Oh, yeah.

318
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:22,090
There's, like, so many different abilities, learn so many
different like characters and abilities.

319
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,390
Strike forward.

320
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,230
This is like the melee build.

321
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,370
Uh, magic is just joking, bird.

322
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,310
George, thank you for this super chat.

323
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,590
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,950
Limbo's might converge damage inflicted onto enemies into
bonus health to yourself.

325
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,050
Oh, that's cool.

326
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,090
That's pretty cool.

327
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,590
All right.

328
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,990
All right, who else do we want to look at next?

329
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,110
I'll look at one more person and then we're going to go
We're gonna go straight in to practice because I want to

330
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:59,150
look at the abilities in the training arena It's been like
oh my gosh, there's so much information Punisher.

331
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,450
All right, we'll look at Punisher Okay, Punisher.

332
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:11,930
I'm not gonna look at the tank because I'm never playing
tank No matter what game it is, I'll never play tank

333
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,210
Oh shit, okay, the costume's pretty sick Which?

334
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,590
Alright, MVP.

335
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,810
Oh, that's pretty cool.

336
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,410
Is he Reaper?

337
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,890
He has two shotguns?

338
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,630
Is this like the Reaper equivalent?

339
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,330
Okay, it's Reaper if Reaper and Soldier had a baby.

340
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,090
Because this has to be the shotgun, right?

341
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,150
Yeah.

342
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,190
They just...

343
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,030
They combine Reaper and Soldier.

344
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:45,830
Alright.

345
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:57,690
Alright, final judgment unleash two galling guns and
missiles to attack missiles holy shit what okay uh it's

346
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:08,790
their dad wait what the fuck you get to launch a hook to to
fucking travel far wait you can have a turret as well this

347
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:15,690
is a dps oh no you are the turret never mind this is like
like tower defense

348
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,970
You also, you control your own turret.

349
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,310
And then there's a grenade.

350
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,770
Oh, and then there's like Bangalore grenade.

351
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,710
Like Bangalore smokes too.

352
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,450
That's a spirit from Vioshoort.

353
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,310
Wait, what?

354
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,490
That's your passive.

355
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,870
You have like, you have like mini walls.

356
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,150
Alpha fashion.

357
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,770
Just so you guys know, this is the alpha test.

358
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:52,190
So you know like, after the alpha, you know that like after
all of this, Like, they're going to nerf people so hard.

359
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,690
Walls as a passive.

360
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,830
You guys know damn well.

361
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:02,010
Like, in the Alpha Bastion, Bastion had a fucking shield.

362
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,210
So, everything you see here, if it seems too OP, do not
worry.

363
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,110
They're going to fucking nerf the shit out of them later.

364
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,550
Because they never keep it that easy.

365
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,370
Okay, I want to do...

366
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,930
I don't want to be...

367
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,470
Wait, I don't want to be...

368
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,470
Hulk, do I...

369
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,250
Who do I play?

370
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:24,670
Alright.

371
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,670
I'll be...

372
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,430
I want...

373
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,590
I want to be low-key.

374
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,570
Because I can heal.

375
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,790
Okay, I'm going to do...

376
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,470
I get the tutorial.

377
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,730
I don't know the tutorial of low-key.

378
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,870
Better take advantage of it right now.

379
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,650
I guess like Galacta is like the announcer slash tutorial.

380
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,630
Oh my god.

381
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,470
Oh my god, the sense of...

382
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,630
Holy shit, the sensitivity is so bad.

383
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:59,790
Okay, I think the worst part about this being alpha is that,
uh, is that you don't have a converter yet.

384
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,090
There's no, there's no converter.

385
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,050
Oh, not the default.

386
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,330
No.

387
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,250
Okay, reticle animation.

388
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,750
No animation, please.

389
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,530
Uh, color green.

390
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,050
Uh, dot size.

391
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,790
Maybe a little bigger.

392
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,050
Is that big enough?

393
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:18,370
Yeah.

394
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:29,250
all right okay settings uh allied health bars okay i have no
communication let me make sure i'm not accident oh i am

395
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,630
lagging a little

396
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:47,530
just guys maybe we're not gonna do high medium let's go
there we go yeah that should be a little better right

397
00:27:49,030 --> 00:28:04,250
communication push to talk we'll do that where's melee melee
where the fuck is melee melee there okay that should be good

398
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:20,950
okay I think that was good yeah alright okay oh that dot is
way too fucking big never mind Melee's always been V,

399
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:21,310
though.

400
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,970
It has always been V.

401
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:23,730
It's never...

402
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,750
Okay, we're going to put one.

403
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,370
I think, like, my melee was...

404
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:28,830
Oh, my gosh.

405
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,470
I actually forgot.

406
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,930
I always get confused between my mouse meleys.

407
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,710
I think this was melee.

408
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,330
And then my communication was this.

409
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:37,770
There we go.

410
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,350
Alright, let's go.

411
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,050
Let's run.

412
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,890
Oh, it's so weird.

413
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,730
It feels like I'm playing Soldier, but I can't run.

414
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,470
Hold B to scope up the structures.

415
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,130
Okay.

416
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,490
I don't break through it.

417
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,170
Do I shoot it?

418
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,750
Oh, what?

419
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:57,810
Okay.

420
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,510
Pass clear.

421
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,810
Head to the target spot.

422
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,510
It's so weird.

423
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,870
Because, like, I feel like I could run, but I can't.

424
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,430
And then, how do I do this?

425
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,110
Oh my god, Maga!

426
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:14,870

Oh, it's like damage boost, but like all of us are damage

00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,610
Interact with it.

440
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,090
And hit.

441
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,670
Alright.

442
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:38,770
Alright.

443
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,510
Looks like you're back to playing as the Punisher.

444
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,210
Rockets here.

445
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,190
That means the team-up ability ammo overload is now
activated.

446
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,510
Oh, I have the team-up.

447

Oh, this is so sad.

527
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,350

535
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,670
I'm DPS now.

536
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,370
I'm...

537
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,250
Do you feel proud?

538
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,990

00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,890

541
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,650
I'm literally spawn camping these guys.

542
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,130

00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,450

544
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,150

545
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,910
Look at me, I'm DPS.

546
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,430
This poor team.

547
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,330
Don't worry, I can heal too.

548
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,090
Okay, never mind, he's dead.

549
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,370
Whoa, what are you doing?

550
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,410
I can aim!

551
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,970
What the fuck are you doing?

552
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,110
I can- I know how to aim!

553
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,610
What is the objective?

554
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,770
We're defending.

555
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,770
They haven't defended yet.

556
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,290
I mean, they haven't attacked yet.

557
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,090
That's the objective.

558
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,470
Look at our Genji Go.

559
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,410
Look at our Spider-Man Genji Go.

560
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,670
Holy shit.

561
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,910
That's so sad.

562
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,150
Can you swap out?

563
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:53,510
Yeah, but then like, I might as well be a fucking DPS

Where's the surrender button?

00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,210
Bro, I'm sorry.

575
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,650
This is not balanced.

576
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,330
Don't worry.

577
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,190
Here you go guys.

578
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,230
Easy.

579
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:51,030
I feel like Honestly, like if this is not fair for this
enemy team.

580
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,430
And my Loki's also shooting, too.

581
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,050
It's funny.

582
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,030
Don't worry, I got you.

583
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,170
Don't worry.

584
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,310
Alright, I want to copy.

585
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,490
Copy you.

586
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,710
That's fucking right.

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,150
I'm tank now, too.

588
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,750
Get over here.

589
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,430
I'm also tank.

590
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,570
I don't know what I'm doing, but I can fly now.

591
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,470
There you go.

592
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,770
I can copy.

593
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,450
There you go.

594
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,170
I don't know, but I'm doing a lot of damage for...

595
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,850

596
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,110
20 player streak.

597
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,190
I don't think I've died.

598
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,150
She's him!

599
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,770
This game is broken already!

600
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:41,970
Fucking easy!

601
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,330

602
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,190
I only got 20 kills!

603
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,150
Does there a leaderboard?

604
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,210
I don't know.

605
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:54,670
Oh, wait, here.

606
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,030
Tab.

There you go.

608
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,790

609
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,010
Holy shit!

610
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,870
We're creating a mapboard!

611
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,370
Oh, my God!

612
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,550

613
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,170
Okay, to be fair, I did a lot of damage for a support,
though.

614
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,270
I did more damage than the Ray guy.

615
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,610
To be fair.

616
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,830
You played against Toddlers.

617
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,090
Oh, my God.

I didn't queue up bots.

627
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,250
I queued up against real people.

628
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,270
Do we keep bullying kids yet again?

629
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:17,070
I think one of my biggest issues, like, straight up just
from this, is the fact that the visual clutter is pretty

630
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,410
bad.

631
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,150
I would admit that the visual clutter is not great.

00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,130
I can't believe Bruce.

643
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,910
I can't believe the Hulk is Diva.

644
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,410
The fan art is going to go fucking crazy.

645
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,330

What the fuck?

657
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,570

Guys, guys, okay, I think I am not meant to do projectile,
maybe.

659
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,030
Projectile might not be it.

00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,690
Okay, that's the decoy.

661
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,110

00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,310
Guys, I feel like...

682
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,050
Maybe I was meant to be a support.

683
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,390
Because...

684
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,790
Because at least I'll actually get healed, you know?

685
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,010
Fuck you, Groot.

686
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,730
Down with nature.

687
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,390
Down with nature!

703
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,410

704
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,610
Okay, wait.

705
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:17,730

710
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:45,430

because of the fact that like my team didn't heal me

711
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,250
It makes me mad.

712
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:53,990
Okay.

713
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,670
Wait, it's because we have one healer!

714
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:57,770
Alright.

715
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:58,570
It's okay.

716
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,450
I know my place.

717
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,050
I fucking know my place.

718
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,650
It's hard.

719
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,930
Now we have two healers.

720
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,150
What is she doing?

721
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,210
Why do you think we...

722
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,950
I'm mad, I didn't get healed, so now I have to heal.

723
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,890
Back to heal their life.

724
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,470
Don't worry, I can turn into the Hulk this time.

725
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,590
I'm going to do what they did to me.

726
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,470
Don't heal.

727
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,070
Sad.

728
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,310
All right, I need to know where the health packs are, too.

729
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:39,670
Like, it's crazy that this is Alpha, because it already
looks pretty good for Alpha.

730
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,890
But, like, obviously, like, there's a lot of stuff they can
improve.

731
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,350
I'm going to put that here.

732
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,730

864
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,280
I'm keeping you all up.

865
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:53,560
Oh!

866
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,860
The support life!

867
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,420
I'm going to turn into you.

868
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,320
That's fucking right.

869
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,020
We did

870
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:13,260
Okay, we're okay.

871
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,300
We're okay.

872
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,680
Guys, I might become a low-key one-trick.

873
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:24,720
Look, he seems to be the only character that works for me.

874
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,160
What?

875
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,600
I'm back.

876
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,260
The pre-revise.

877
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,220
Oh my god.

878
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,660
dokey you know it just works we had we beat a yeah we beat a
team that wasn't babies

879
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:55,440
all i'm saying is that loki seems to be like the easiest in
terms of support no they can't nerf loki look at him they

880
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,480
can't nerve him

881
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,160
Okay, dokey, lokey.

882
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,720
And then I swap.

883
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,380
Woo, look at that.

884
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,560
It's like a symmetrical portal.

885
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:07,940
I like that.

886
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:08,800
Look at that.

887
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,540
I'm inventing new tech now.

888
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,560
New movement tech.

889
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,780
Guys, I literally invented new movement tech.

890
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,920
I need to remember how using the swaps, though.

891
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,460
Like, I think, like, the one thing I need to, like, know how
to do is just swapping care.

892
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:26,860
characters.

893
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,320
Okay.

894
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,060
Am I getting flanked?

895
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,600
No, I'm not.

896
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:30,940
Okay.

897
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,620
I was like, I thought I was getting flanked.

898
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,980
It seemed like I was getting flanked there.

899
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,080
Okay.

900
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,600
Don't worry, I got you.

901
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,720
I got you.

902
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,400
I got you.

903
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,840
Okay, they're all up top.

904
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,580
It's fine.

905
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,500
It's fine.

906
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,220
The support can't fucking tank this.

907
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,400
We're okay.

908
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,400
Wait, did he like make a- No, no, Bruce!

909
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,360
We can't have you go back to Bruce!

910
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,040
Okay.

911
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,620
Oh, no.

912
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,760
I need to be able to hit that, too.

913
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,780
Okay, that's fine.

914
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,360
That's fine.

915
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,280
Go, Bruce!

916
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:04,780
Go!

917
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,140
No, Bruce!

918
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,640
No, we can't have you, Bitani!

919
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,280
Oh, no.

920
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,400
Oh, no.

921
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,260
Bruce is out of his mech form.

922
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,540
That's bad.

923
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,200
We can't have...

924
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,700
Oh, I don't like how, like, you know, the environment's
gone, too.

925
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,700
Don't worry, Scarlet!

926
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,640

00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,080
Oh, goodbye.

931
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,580
No!

932
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,400
What?

933
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,400
What is that damage?

934
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,760
Okay, Scarlet Witch is actually busted.

935
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,740
I did not think she would fucking just destroy me like that.

936
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,180
What?

937
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,160
It's literally one shot.

938
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,620
That's actually crazy.

939
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:19,480
It's okay.

940
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,060
That's fine.

941
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,620
Oh my god, someone saved the Hulk.

952
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,840
I don't know what her abilities are, but she seems like
really strong.

953
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,220
She seems really strong.

954
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,320
Oh, and she's like a one star, too.

955
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,200
She's like literally one star.

956
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,080
I really like the aesthetic of the game.

957
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,080
Penny Parker, but she's a tank.

958
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,800
It doesn't matter.

959
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,760
I don't want to play tank.

960
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,280
Tank is terrible.

961
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,280
I see no tank, but we don't need tank.

962
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:52,740
tanks.

963
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:58,640
No more they said no more mutants and no liberated everyone.

964
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,080
It looks really good.

965
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,320
The fact that tank has a maywall is like so scary.

966
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:05,660
Okay.

967
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,540
What is this?

968
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:07,380
Okay.

969
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,620
This is like attack.

970
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,200
This is what?

971
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,480
Oh, this is like a mora beam I assume.

972
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,300
And is this shift?

973
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,660
And then what is...

974
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,720
This is the portal, right?

975
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,440
Wait, what is this?

976
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,440
What is the E?

977
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:26,060
I assume Yeah, left click is the more of, like, more of
suck.

978
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,280
I'm pretty sure.

979
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,640
And then, guys, we have zero tanks, guys.

980
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,260
But we don't need that.

981
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,820
Wait, how did they get up there?

982
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:35,940
Alright.

983
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,280
I don't know what the...

984
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,340
It's okay.

985
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,720
We're five.

986
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,160
Guys, we're fine.

987
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,240
They can heal us.

988
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,440
Okay, wait.

989
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:45,960
Okay.

990
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,020
And then...

991
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,720
No, we have a tank!

992
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,700
Okay, what is E?

993
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,200
Oh, it's like a mine!

994
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,020
Oh my god, Dr. Strange has, like, the Rhyme shield!

995
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,720
Guys, get closer to me so I can suck.

996
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,880
Guys, I need you to get closer to me for the suck.

997
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:04,300
Guys.

998
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,560
Wait, what?

999
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,540
There it.

1000
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:08,940
Suck.

1001
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,920
Get over there.

1002
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,020
Okay.

1003
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,520
Oh, this is confusing.

1004
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,600
Because I have limited ammo for the left-right click.

1005
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,280
So I have- Oh, still a tiny healer.

1006
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,560
I need heals.

1007
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:24,340
Please.

1008
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,320
I need heals.

1009
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,940
Guys, I need heals.

1010
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:29,500
Please.

1011
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,120
I can't suck that far.

1012
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,420
No, I tank!

1013
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:36,900
I have one tank!

1014
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:37,580
Oh, God.

1015
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:38,160
Goodbye.

1016
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,560
Oh, goodbye.

1017
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:41,920
Guys, this is bad.

1018
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,580
I've limited ammo when it comes to close range.

1019
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,040
How do they do this?

1020
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,440
No!

1021
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,640
Okay, no, fuck.

1022
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,220
I think like...

1023
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,440
I think like, uh, Scarlet Witch, um, not as good as I
thought.

1024
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,940
She's only good at close range, I noticed.

1025
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,460
Wait, I can fly!

1026
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,900
There's still a chance to stop that!

1027
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,000
Wait, I can fly?

1028
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,820
Oh, wait, no, I can- I can glide?

1029
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,300
No, I can glide.

1030
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,060
Okay, I- I can glide, okay.

1031
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,760
I can glide, guys.

1032
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,400
Oh, yeah, Star-Star Lord seems like Tracer, yeah.

1033
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:19,640
Okay.

1034
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,360
How far does this go?

1035
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,640
All right, I just need to know how far that goes.

1036
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,760
Where's my range for this?

1037
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,360
Oh my god.

1038
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,920
I don't know my range for this.

1039
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:30,880
Alright.

1040
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,720
She can hold space to glide.

1041
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,880
Yeah, I think it's like glide.

1042
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,260
Yeah, I can do that for...

1043
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,160
Wait, my chaos is strong though.

1044
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,620
Chaos time!

1045
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:43,940
Okay.

1046
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,960
Oh, did I kill anybody?

1047
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,820
I can't tell!

1048
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,620
Oh, and then...

1049
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,540
That's right, suck.

1050
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,240
It's not fair.

1051
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,640
He's getting healed!

1052
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,020
What the fuck?

1053
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,320
Get closer to me!

1054
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,160
No, okay, never mind.

1055
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,960
I hate Scarlet.

1056
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,940
Scarlet's only good with her alt.

1057
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,740
Not gonna lie.

1058
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,500
I've noticed it.

1059
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,000
Scarlet's only good with the alt.

1060
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,760
Because the others are like...

1061
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,440
Guys, please.

1062
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,500
I need healing.

1063
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,100
I need healing.

1064
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,280
Please.

1065
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:22,700
I need healing.

1066
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,300
Where's my...

1067
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,120
Loki, please!

1068
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,100
I need healing!

1069
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:28,380
Loki!

1070
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,140
Loki, there's a squid in front of me!

1071
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,180
I'm scared!

1072
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,360
Okay, I'm here, it's nice.

1073
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:35,880
Alright, that's good.

1074
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,320
I'm here now.

1075
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,760
Get closer.

1076
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:45,500
I can't get closer because there's like 200 enemies in front
of me!

1077
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1078
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,160
Okay, I'm safe.

1079
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,800
Guys, I can't Can't just fucking get closer, guys.

1080
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,200
There's literally three people in front of me.

1081
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:00,400
Look.

1082
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:01,980
Oh, God.

1083
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:02,700
Oh.

1084
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,060
No!

1085
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,540
Okay, I'm going to try Hella.

1086
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,700
I think Hella might be it.

1087
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,720
Okay, taste of her own Loki.

1088
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,880
I think she's like a flanker.

1089
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,240
It seems like a flanker.

1090
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,180
Hella does this.

1091
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,180
And then she has that.

1092
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,320
And then, oh, she teleports.

1093
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,220
Okay, what's this?

1094
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,500
I don't know what the E does though.

1095
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,100
Oh no, they made it.

1096
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,260
What does the E does?

1097
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,360
Can't tell.

1098
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:32,920
Oh no.

1099
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,260
That's fine.

1100
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,660
That's fine.

1101
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,400
They only have 60 seconds to get there.

1102
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,180
You don't see me up here.

1103
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,360
God, there's so many squids!

1104
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,580
Why is there so many squids?

1105
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,460
Okay, we got...

1106
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:48,720
Fuck.

1107
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:50,860
No, no.

1108
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:51,780
Loki!

1109
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:52,920
Loki!

1110
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,540
What is the E?

1111
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,560
Loki, please help me.

1112
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:02,640
Okay.

1113
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,880
I don't know what the E does.

1114
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,240
Alright, but I can teleport, though.

1115
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,700
It was a nice corner.

1116
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,220
Oh, controlling the bird.

1117
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,200
Controlling the bird is so difficult.

1118
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,340
Okay, I have another.

1119
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,720
I can fly soon.

1120
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,100
Alright.

1121
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,400
I need, like, a straight line to fly.

1122
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,220
I need a straight line.

1123
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:38,060

01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,100
Oh, okay, I do!

1127
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,500
Oh, shit!

1128
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,580
Holy fuck, that was an accident.

1129
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,360
If I hit headshots, I actually can kill so many people.

1130
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,000
What is hella mode?

1131
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,600
Is this hella mode?

1132
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,500
Guys, I fucked up with my hella mode, but... Oh, wait, no, I
didn't.

1133
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,060
Oh, you're so fucking dead.

1134
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,480
That damage is actually insane.

1135
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,400
Maybe I'll be an Asgardian.

1136
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,540
Asgardian.

1137
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,660
Asgardian player.

1138
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,280
I just play all the Asgardians.

1139
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,580
Asgardians only, please.

1140
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,900
I can't play any other character but Asgardians.

1141
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,480
Alright.

1142
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,440
I still don't know what E does.

1143
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,020
Oh, I think it's like...

1144
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:50,240
Hey.

1145
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,140
Oh, no!

1146
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,120
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1147
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:59,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1148
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,240
Or Norse.

1149
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,640
Yeah, Norse god, Maine.

1150
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,620
I'll be Norse Maine only.

1151
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,260
No, I accidentally burned it to them.

1152
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,860
Oh, my God.

1153
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:22,720
Jesus Christ, the damage is actually insane.

1154
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:35,000
as i wait who's that i feel like as long as i like uh as
long as i hit headshots it's actually crazy the thing i can

1155
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:48,800
do things i can do get away from me i don't think thor is in
the game yet i think he's like he might be going in uh maybe

1156
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,060
like in later on because i know they're releasing

1157
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,780
This is so hard to teleport.

1158
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:57,980
God damn it.

1159
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,020
There you go.

1160
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,060
Predicting this is hard.

1161
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,300
No, they made it!

1162
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,560
But I got two, though!

1163
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:08,860
Loki, please.

1164
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:10,360
No!

1165
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,660
Did they make it?

1166
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,220
Did they make it?

1167
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,260
No, I think they did it.

1168
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:14,800
Okay.

1169
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:15,840
We're good.

1170
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,860
This is not fair.

1171
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,080
Okay, I'm trying to help my...

1172
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,180
I'm trying my best to help!

1173
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,080
I'm going in the corner!

1174
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,840
Oh, I did not.

1175
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,720
Okay, guys, it's okay.

1176
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,680
We have one last point left.

1177
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,040
No, please.

1178
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,020
Not my win streak.

1179
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,840
Not my win streak, guys.

1180
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:34,440
No!

1181
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,300
Look, I'm doing a lot.

1182
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,500
I got 12 kills.

1183
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,240
I'm, like, literally on fire.

1184
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:44,700
Okay.

1185
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,320
This way.

1186
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:48,820
Okay.

1187
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,180
Fur it up.

1188
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:51,540
All right.

1189
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,400
See, guys, I'm not low-key.

1190
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,220
I'm hella.

1191
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,060
Because I'm hella dope.

1192
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,100
Alright, let's see.

1193
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,720
Maybe I should try Punisher.

1194
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,800
They're all flying.

1195
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,300
This is actually, like, so cheesy.

1196
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,440
Don't make me go hell on you.

1197
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,140
Bam, bam.

1198
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:14,680
Okay, they're shielding everything.

1199
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:16,340
Alright, that's right.

1200
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,340
You can't shield this.

1201
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,420
You can't shield this.

1202
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,780
Alright, that was, like, pretty useless.

1203
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:31,940
But, like, I did the best i could the storm storm seems like

They turned around!

1209
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,600
Okay, it's okay.

My trump card.

1213
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:09,560
Tracking.

1214
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,240
There's no way.

1215
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:11,740
No!

1216
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:12,960
What are we losing?

1217
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,040
We lost our healer!

1218
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,540
It's okay.

1219
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,260
I have my...

1220
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,840
My tracking will save us guys.

1221
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,940
It's okay!

1222
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,040
Oh, God, it might not be okay.

1223
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,340
Oh, he's leaving me alone!

1224
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,900
Alright, if we lose, it's not me, guys.

1225
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:38,760
Oh, no.

1226
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,600
Guys, I don't know.

1227
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,300
I think it's becoming more and more clear.

1228
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,760
I'm meant to play Loki.

1229
01:08:56,330 --> 01:09:14,230
my god it wasn't me it was my team oh my god it was my team
look at this i knew it was my team look at the damage i took

1230
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:23,410
like okay fucking dr strange took 27 000 okay dr strange is
actually a really good tank not gonna like not like not him

1231
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:33,670
as a player Not him as a player, but like I think Dr.
Strange seems really OP as a tank Because of the shield.

1232
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:41,250
The shield can block so many things The 1.6k I knew it!

1233
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:49,630
This is why people become healers Because I have dog shit
healers So the only way to live is to be a healer yourself

1234
01:09:49,630 --> 01:10:04,330
Alright, I want to try Storm Because I got shit on by too
many Storm players I got shit on too many times by storm All

1235
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:10,030
right, let's see Oh wait, I can look at here Wind blow,
transform into hair, hurricane Switch the weather Oh yeah,

1236
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:18,390
this is the weather swap Switch the weather for damage boost
Channel the power, weatherton, power storm Okay Unleash a

1237
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:23,930
lighting bolt forward Okay This is gonna be a little Yeah,
DPS Lucio time

1238
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:36,510
okay this is is this damage boost I assume this is movement
because it's the wind and then this is damage and then

1239
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:50,350
double damage let's go now okay we should be on speed for
now uh so we can all get there in time I swear I think the

1240
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:59,510
flying is so broken because like because like bad players in
the air I think I think like bad you know it's true look at

1241
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:05,330
all the fair players bad players can't shoot people in the
air so like I think that's OP you

1242
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,190
know it's true

1243
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:24,210
all right let's get rid of this shield what the fuck okay
let's see we'll do damage boost because we have all right

1244
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:28,040
apparently i'm i can't even shoot people while i'm in the
air

1245
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:45,010
i can't even okay this is like an issue though the issue is
that it's very hard to shoot people when you're flying all

1246
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:51,070
right the projectile is actually pretty difficult not gonna
lie wait breaking shield breaking shield

1247
01:11:54,490 --> 01:12:11,210
oh holy fuck okay were you gonna do magic oh no oh no not
the turret oh okay there you go okay okay there's a range

1248
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:23,130
there no we're my healers do we have healers we don't have a
healer okay guys it's not because i've won to play Loki.

1249
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:25,850
We literally have zero healers.

1250
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:31,030
I was like, where the fuck are healers?

1251
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:33,270
Oh my god.

1252
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:36,110
Guys, it's not a fucking...

1253
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:38,190
Do you think I want to play Loki?

1254
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:40,530
Look, I had to...

1255
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,710
We literally had zero healers.

1256
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,850
We have three tanks.

1257
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:47,510
Like, what is this bullshit?

1258
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:50,670
We actually had three tanks.

1259
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:53,770
Bruce Please, Bruce.

1260
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,690
Oh, my God.

1261
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,910
Okay.

1262
01:12:58,530 --> 01:12:59,190
This is bad.

1263
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,510
This is bad.

1264
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:01,270
Oh, wait.

1265
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:02,430
No.

1266
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:03,910
Oh, no, please.

1267
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:11,530
No one's healing to cease to change the DPS.

1268
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:15,330
I'm pretty sure Loki has to be the meta when it comes to
healer.

1269
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:20,270
Because, like, I feel like Loki does, like, a lot of...

1270
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:21,470
Has, like, really good utility.

1271
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:24,290
I don't maybe Loki and rocket raccoon.

1272
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:32,170
I think I think Loki and rocket raccoon I don't know what
this does, but oh shit.

1273
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,210
Oh, I'm sorry.

1274
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:34,130
Oh shit.

1275
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:34,710
Okay, don't worry.

1276
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,050
I have like so much HP Wait, I'm fucking tanked.

1277
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:38,010
Don't worry.

1278
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:41,070
We do you know we needed a four fucking tank?

1279
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:46,110
That's that's what we fucking needed.

1280
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:57,510

Guys, it's okay.

1283
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:03,710
It's not as bad as getting spawned camped earlier.

1284
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,410
Oh, yeah, we do.

1285
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:07,510

She's just better!

1356
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:49,290
Oh my god.

1357
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:57,930
these just you know what I don't like though I don't like
how I can't crouch spam that's why I don't what okay that's

1358
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:09,410
like walling basically I think the fact that I can't crouch
spam and like crouch jiggles to make it like harder to hit

1359
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:19,930
like I could AD but I wish I could crouch spam that's
fucking right maybe I am Agumato I don't know if i've said

1360
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:29,530
that correctly guys we don't have a healer anymore we don't
have a healer anymore i'm sorry i got a little selfish i'm

1361
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:42,930
sorry guys at this point i might as well just like teleport
into a what the are you doing low-key cps is actually really

1362
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:48,250
like insane not gonna lie guys why did you

1363
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:54,630
Why did you build that wall, guys?

1364
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:56,950
I can't go through.

1365
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,910
Alright, we're good.

1366
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:01,050
We're not good.

1367
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:06,730
I think, like, his DPS is actually really, like, actually
really powerful.

1368
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:14,170
When I hit those, if I hit those, against the Squishies, it
feels like the DPS is actually crazy for Loki.

1369
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:16,110
Alright, nice.

1370
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,870

the aura and fight with your clothes it turns damage into

1390
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:22,690
healing oh that's so cool i didn't know that Wait, that's
so, okay, I'm pretty sure they have to nerf Loki.

1391
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,050
I feel like Loki, oh my god.

1392
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:27,170
Guys, look at the endorsements.

1393
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:27,790
They know!

1394
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:30,670
They were like, thank you for going healer.

1395
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:31,950
Oh my god!

1396
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:34,070
I got appreciation.

1397
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:35,550
They know.

1398
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:47,110
They gave me all the endorsements because I was the only one
that was willing to suck up my ego to play fucking healer.

1399
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:48,610
I want to play Star Lord.

1400
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,550
Okay, Star-Lord.

1401
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:53,790
Engage in a free flight and lock onto enemies in sight.

1402
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:55,290
Boost and soar forward.

1403
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:57,610
Five frenzy of shots causing damage.

1404
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:00,710
Dodge in the direction of movement and swiftly reload.

1405
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,350
Ooh, wait, this is like Tracer.

1406
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,100
And the calm moments.

1407
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:08,420
What are the other supports?

1408
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:13,180
It's like Rocket Raccoon, Mantis, and Lunar Snow.

1409
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,380
I don't like the other support.

1410
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,700
I think, okay.

1411
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,040
This is, how many do we have?

1412
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:21,600
have two.

1413
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:22,560
Okay.

1414
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,140
We have two.

1415
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:28,460
And then... Then we have that.

1416
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,020
And then we have the glide.

1417
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,080
Oh, I can fly with this.

1418
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:33,520
Okay.

1419
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,360
All right.

1420
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,200
That's interesting.

1421
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,000
I want to be Star-Lord.

1422
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,180
I'm already Star-Lord.

1423
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,060
I want to be Star-Lord.

1424
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:45,960
All right.

1425
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,340
We're fine.

1426
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:58,940
I think, like, Storm, Storm is like i'm not a projectile
person like that's the only issue i'm so bad at projectile

1427
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:09,180
oh my god i'm so fast here we go all right i think i have to
play flanker for this i'm pretty sure i think starlord's a

1428
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:18,460
flanker i don't know the map so i don't know how i'm
flanking but the only issue is i gotta figure out the map no

1429
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,380
all right let's Let's see, how do I...

1430
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,660
Oh my god, I like pepper damage.

1431
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:25,400

1439
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,000
Okay, I think like at Starlord, you have to know, like, all
the health facts, just like Tracy.

1440
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,560
Oh my gosh, damage is so tiny.

But I don't know the map good enough, well enough to, like,
flank yet.

That's Bruce Banner!

Is this the creator clash?

1556
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:56,510

It, like, stuck on people.

1595
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:17,150
Okay, I remember now.

1596
01:34:17,670 --> 01:34:18,830
We gotta go up.

1597
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:19,270
Meow.

1598
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:20,910
Alright.

01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:26,350
And then, I I put it on the tank, so it should be fine,

1600
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,610
And then, yeah.

1601
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:30,230
Yeah, we're double healing.

1602
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:32,450
Don't worry, I got you.

1603
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:34,730
Okay, I...

1604
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:36,110
Don't worry, I got you!

1605
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:38,430
Don't worry, I can DPS her.

1606
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:41,310
Oh my god, your DPS is so weak.

1607
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:46,730
Wait, this DPS is so bad.

1608
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:51,110
Okay, I think I found the mercy.

1609
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,210
She does so much healing though.

1610
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:57,930
She actually does so much healing.

1611
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,710
It's actually crazy how much healing she does.

1612
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:03,910
But her DPS is actually garbage.

1613
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:05,150
I am not a fan.

1614
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:08,470
I'm not a fan of the...

1615
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:09,030
I'm not...

1616
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:10,070
Okay, almost...

1617
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,270
Okay, you can't say that because like...

1618
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:14,990
Because like fucking Loki's...

1619
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:17,530
Loki's DPS is actually insane.

1620
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:19,430
Like you can't say that.

1621
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:23,230
I can solo tank a tank.

1622
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,850
So I'll kill a tank on Loki if I want to.

1623
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:31,370
No, Kiriko's DPS is crazy as well.

1624
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:32,710
I wonder if I have the headshot.

1625
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:34,250
Maybe if I headshot?

1626
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:37,010
If I headshot?

1627
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:39,030
No, the DPS is still pretty bad.

1628
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:41,650
Alright, it's time to dance.

1629
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:43,030
We're dancing.

1630
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:43,890
Let's go.

1631
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:45,970
Yeah, let's fucking go.

1632
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:48,810
Woo.

1633
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:52,790
Now it's damaged.

1634
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:58,650
Oh shit, I need to back that up.

1635
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:09,890
It's like, okay, so her alt, what her alt does, this is
officially awkward.

1636
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:16,870
What her alt does is she can either damage boost or heal
everybody.

1637
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:18,090
That was her alt.

1638
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:21,010
Let me break it down.

1639
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:25,850
It looks stupid.

1640
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:28,430
Yes, it actually does look a little stupid.

1641
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:31,290
It's fun, though.

1642
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:32,530
I'm actually having a lot of fun.

1643
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:35,210
How do you use sprays?

1644
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:35,950
Hey, guys.

1645
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:37,690
You guys want to see my spray?

1646
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:40,030

01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:40,870
Guys, what the fuck?

1648
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:41,950
You guys lied to me.

1649
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:42,870
I can't use it.

1650
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:45,210
Okay.

1651
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:47,250
But, yeah, this is...

1652
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:49,430
Man, she's so easy.

1653
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:50,610
Holy shit.

1654
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:52,030

1655
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:52,850

cute.

1660
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,390
Like, even Kierko has more damage than this.

1661
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:32,670
I think she just has, like, insane heal output, though.

1662
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:36,150
I would admit her heal output is actually insane.

1663
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,850
Like, I admit that.

1664
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,550
Oh, my God, guys.

1665
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:40,990

Oh, it's fucking stupid.

1704
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:28,350
It looks so silly.

1705
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:29,190
It is.

1706
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:31,430
It does look so silly.

1707
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:34,650
Alright, nice.

1708
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:36,470

Wait, it is!

1712
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:44,390
It's like Xenob, but like, more fabulous.

1713
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:48,070
Wait, you're fucking right.

1714
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:50,270
It's just like Xenata.

1715
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:56,150
Oh shit.

1716
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:57,730
Don't let him get near us.

1717
01:39:58,590 --> 01:39:59,070
Don't worry, guys.

1718
01:39:59,250 --> 01:39:59,390
Wait.

1719

01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:06,230
It's clapping time.

1725
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:11,250
Zen throwing the dumpy.

1726
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:15,210
It could be a Zen ult if they weren't cowards.

1727
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:20,170
It's a yada, but nice.

1728
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:22,830
Oh, yeah.

1729

This guy went fucking absolute nuclear.

1825
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:04,080
I literally have zero zeros.

1826
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:06,260
I didn't even get a chance to pick my character.

1827
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,380
I don't even exist.

1828
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:13,580
I literally don't even exist in the fucking game.

1829
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,840
I just got backfilled.

1830
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:19,600

It's so fun.

1839
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:28,080
I swear to God, support is so fucking fun.

1840
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:31,860
I loved role...

1841
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:33,920
As a support player, I loved role queue.

1842
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:35,280
I fucking...

1843
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:40,240
I don't know if, like, lower eels hated role queue, but,
like, higher eelob players loved role queue.

1844
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:45,740
Because, like, I fucking hated, like, being a support player
in Overwatch and having to play, like, tanker DPS because

1845
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:46,800
there were just too many supports.

1846
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:53,340
I remember one time in Overwatch 1, We had a team where it's
just six support players and we actually won.

1847
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:54,480
It was actually crazy.

1848
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:57,240
And then we were like, oh my god This looks like fucking
Hanamura.

1849
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:58,340
Wait.

1850
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,100
Is there a choke point like Hanamura?

1851
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,660
Wait, what the fuck?

1852
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:12,480
This almost okay, the choke looks like Hanamura, but other
than that it's different Okay, oh god guys, guys.

1853
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:13,720
Oh, it's fine.

1854
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:15,240
Oh, it's not fine.

1855
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:15,960
It's not fine.

1856
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:20,700
The tank wants to get me Oh my god This is when you...

1857
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:22,840
This is a person that actually knows how to play Loki.

1858
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,420
Because look at all these lokies.

1859
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,280
Oh, please!

1860
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:27,420
Leave me alone!

1861
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:31,420
That's fucking right.

1862
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,300
Get you!

1863
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,260
Got you!

1864
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:35,440
That's fucking right!

1865
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:35,920
Yes!

1866
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:38,100
Got the fucking healer, guys!

1867
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,280
Spider-Fifton, ready to punch!

1868
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:41,560
I got the healers!

1869
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:45,140
Oh my god, this is like Genji, but like harder.

1870
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:48,280
Holy shit!

1871
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,600
Bro, this is so hard because...

1872
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:57,900
I need a higher sensitivity.

1873
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:02,300
Holy shit.

1874
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,960
To play Spider-Man, you need such a high sensitivity.

1875
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,580
It's actually crazy.

1876
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:11,420
Oh my gosh.

1877
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,660
This is actually so...

1878
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:13,920
Oh!

1879
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:18,720
Guys, just go, girls, please.

1880
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:21,740
I wonder if you can make goats in the Marvel Rivals.

1881
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,780
That would be so funny if you can.

1882
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,300
Oh my god, I got him!

1883
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,620
Get me in the air!

1884
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:30,800
That's fucking right!

1885
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,860
God, so many things are happening on my screen!

1886
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:40,340
I'm getting disoriented!

1887
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:41,480
No.

1888
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:42,680
No.

1889
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:44,020
Oh god.

1890
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:44,680

1893
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,140
What is happening?

1894
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:53,200
Guys, I can't, I cannot, I cannot play Spider-Man.

1895
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:56,240
I can't, it's too, oh my god.

1896
01:52:56,900 --> 01:53:00,800
I, like, get too disoriented playing Spider-Man.

1897
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:03,160
I'll just be Storm.

1898
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,680
Clearly, Storm would be easier, right?

1899
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,020
Because I'm in the air, you know?

1900
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:09,940
And then I'll do damage boost right here.

1901
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:12,440
And then I'll do fucking mega damage boost here.

1902
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:14,000
That's fucking right.

1903
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:15,520
I just can't.

1904
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:18,400
Like, it's actually so difficult.

1905
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,180
I need healing!

1906
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:22,600
Packs!

1907
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:27,980
Oh!

1908
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:29,580
Wait, do we have enough tanks?

1909
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:30,900
Oh, we don't!

1910
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:31,560
No!

1911
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:33,440
Okay, we need to try tank.

1912
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:33,780
You know what?

1913
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:34,660
I'll try Magneto.

1914
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:36,160
What is Magneto?

1915
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:44,260
Okay, shift, change the magnetic field to form, blocking all
four, conjuring magic shield, damage taken, oh my god, what?

1916
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,960
Wait, what is this space?

1917
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:48,400
Oh, space to fall slowly.

1918
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,260
Okay, we're gonna try.

1919
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,500
We'll try Magneto because we need a tank.

1920
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,620
Guys, we will actually play Magneto.

1921
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:56,140
Guys, don't worry.

1922
01:53:59,060 --> 01:53:59,920
You're all glad.

1923
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:01,940
You're all glad.

1924
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:03,080
Wait, what?

1925
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:03,890
I thought that was the...

1926
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:05,900
Okay.

1927
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:07,560
Okay, that's the shield.

1928
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:08,480
Okay, I got it.

1929
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:09,920
I got- I had to learn!

1930
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,980
Guys, how do I not have heals anymore?

1931
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:16,500
Guys, we have literally two supports!

1932
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:18,420
Oh god.

1933
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:20,480
Oh god.

1934
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:22,380

1935
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:22,980
Minus!

1936
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,360

1937
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:26,820

1938
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,620
Guys!

1939
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,540
Get the fucking hell out!

1940
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:37,440
Please.

1941
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:39,580
Get the fucking hell out!

1942
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:43,220
Oh god.

1943
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:46,260
Oh god, this is so difficult.

1944
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:49,060
I'm trying so hard to take!

1945
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:54,860

01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:01,980

I'm going to get rid of that fucking hella.

1949
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:07,260
If it's the last thing I do.

1950
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:10,760
If it's the last thing I do.

1951
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,120
Bro, I'm so mad.

1952
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,280
No one's killing this hella right now.

1953
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:17,560

1954
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:18,780
I'm so mad.

1955
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:21,300

01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:23,100
Where is she?

1957
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:24,680

Okay, it might be a little overkill, but like, I swear it
was worth it.

It was so 100% worth it.

01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,920
Is she still up there?

1973
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:14,760

02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,160
Honestly.

2033
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:10,640
Language Jokey.

2034
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,380

02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:15,380
Thank you for the super chat.

2036
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:15,800
Alright.

2037
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,480
Imagine having a lot of fun.

2038
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:18,980
I think this is actually a really fun game.

2039
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:27,780
I don't know if it'll like live for I think if they change
the UI I honestly think um they have to change the UI a lot

2040
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:34,640
to make this like a better game because I'm not like a huge
fan of the visuals like the not like the character models

2041
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:40,660
but like the attacks and stuff and you have to change the
the health bars I think they should change the health bars

2042
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:48,800
and the um because like um I always like I don't like the
help bars being in the middle at the bottom Because I always

2043
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,980
forget what my health is I don't like the UI But I'm
assuming because this is alpha Because this is alpha, right?

2044
02:00:54,540 --> 02:01:01,860
So like a lot of things are going to change Because like
Overwatch UI during alpha test was so fucking bad It was so

2045
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:19,560
bad It was like not Okay Alright I'm gonna do what she did

players, like If you can aim, it feels so good.

2054
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:55,220

02:02:57,100 --> 02:02:57,960
Guys, that's all right.

2070
02:02:58,180 --> 02:03:00,520
98 HP, I'm fine with that, I guess.

2071
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,260
Oh, now I'm 83.

2072
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:03,540
Woo!

2073
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:07,060
It's okay.

2074
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:09,120
As long as I don't peek, it's fine.

2075
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:10,140
Guys.

2076
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:13,880

02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:15,340
Oh, oh, oh!

2078
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:22,220
Okay, Hela is like, oh my god, I'm finally past, guys, it's
actually crazy.

2079
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:25,840
I'm finally past, like, 98 HP.

2080
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,340
I never knew what that was like.

2081
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:30,400
What the fuck?

2082
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:31,620
There's a guy right here.

2083
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:33,480
Is that, who's that?

2084
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:34,520
Who is that?

2085
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:36,240
I'm gonna save my all for the next round.

2086
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,500
Who is that?

2087
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:40,740
Come on, come on, Scarlet.

2088
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:44,060
Come on, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, she more sucked
me.

2089
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:51,560

Oh, that one is a y'all.

2093
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:02,880
Lucky.

2094
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:07,760
Please, there's literally, like, three of you.

2095
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:10,400
I don't understand.

2096
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:12,280
Wait, what is that?

2097
02:04:12,620 --> 02:04:13,740
Oh, my God.

2098
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:15,380

2099
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:17,820
Okay.

2100
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:19,740
Alright, I gotta queue then.

2101
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:20,800
I need to get closer.

2102
02:04:21,460 --> 02:04:21,860
Loki, please.

2103
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:22,920
Just top me off.

2104
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:23,780
Please.

2105
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:26,800
Please, Loki, just top me off.

2106
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:33,440
Please!

2107
02:04:34,660 --> 02:04:34,960
Please!

2108
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,200
Healing is illegal.

2109
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:57,760
guys why don't we have heals our low-key swapped off healing
do you think you swapped off healing because of me guys

2110
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:08,060

much just maybe just maybe that was my bad look i needed

2113
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:43,100

hear?

2114
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:47,560
Like, I am doing my job.

2115
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:49,240
Oh, no.

2116
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:50,600
Oh, no.

2117
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:52,840
Oh, no, please.

2118
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:54,140
I'm trying.

2119
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:55,120
I'm trying.

2120
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:56,860
I'm trying so hard.

2121
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:02,760
I made my support tilted.

2122
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:06,620
Oh, man.

2123
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,820
Why did he do this to me?

2124
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,260
We were winning.

2125
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:18,060
If he's still a healer, we would have won.

2126
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,460
How could he do this to me?

2127
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:26,880
Destined to be Loki bird.

2128
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,560
Just destined to be Loki bird.

2129
02:06:30,980 --> 02:06:33,820
But I mean, I feel like, oh, bear dog went healer.

2130
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:35,300
Is that fair?

2131
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:42,480
Oh, oh, just because I suck up my ego to go fucking healer.

2132
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,340
They just want you to heal.

2133
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:49,460
Loki-Doki strikes again.

2134
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,680
I can't believe it.

2135
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,260
Loki-Doki is real.

2136
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:58,740
We lost our fucking other player.

2137
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:02,380
I can't believe it.

2138
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:04,460
Oh my god.

2139
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:06,360
I can't believe it.

2140
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:11,580

Like, outplayed him so hard.

02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:15,440
New Loki tech.

02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:18,180
New fucking Loki tech, guys.

2157
02:08:20,220 --> 02:08:20,860
Outplayed.

2158
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:24,620
Actual Loki tech right there.

2159
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:27,160
Okay, let's see.

2160
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:29,320
Alright.

2161
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:32,160
Alright, I need a shape shift soon.

2162
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:33,000

Oh god, whoops!

2201
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:30,580
Maybe...

2202
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:31,720
Yeah, there we go.

2203
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:33,720
Alright, nice.

2204
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,060
Oh my god.

2205
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:37,640
I'm actually a Loki player.

2206
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:38,860
Wait, actually.

2207
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:40,580
Somebody fucking nerfed me.

2208
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:45,960
Oh my god, somebody fucking nerfed me.

2209
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:48,380
I'm actually insane at this.

2210
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:52,440
Alright, I'm gonna kill our players real fast.

2211
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:54,220
And then...

2212
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:55,660
I'm gonna go up.

2213
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:59,760
Yeah, oh my god, the fucking turret, though.

2214
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:03,480
What the fuck?

2215
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:05,920
Oh my god, okay.

2216
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:08,980
It's okay, I got her.

2217
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:09,840
Don't worry.

2218
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:11,360
I'm DPS now.

2219
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:13,220
Okay.

2220
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:14,260
Oh, Rocket's low.

2221
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:16,600
We're fine.

2222
02:11:17,740 --> 02:11:18,560
We're fine.

2223
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:21,580
Bro, no, Loki is 100% getting nerfed.

2224
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:22,360
There's no way.

2225
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:23,560
There's no way.

2226
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:26,800
His DPS is like, his damage is insane.

2227
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,360
And, like, his cooldowns are so short.

2228
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:32,240
There's no way they're making Loki like this out of Alpha.

2229
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:33,600
It's too good.

2230
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:39,400
It's actually...

2231
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:40,760
Yeah, and with Rocket, too.

2232
02:11:40,780 --> 02:11:51,500
I think Loki and Rocket is just way too good top 500 loki
main by the way he has too many tools and he's like so

2233
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:59,440
disorienting because like i can like swap between position
like i can swap between loki's if i get like dive he's gonna

2234
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:09,580
get guided that's me loki and hawk oh yeah if you know the
hawk okay if you were here earlier and you saw that fucking

2235
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:13,940
hawk player who in the fucking hawk move up Rollouts, it was
insane.

2236
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:16,360
He was, like, jumping everywhere and sliding.

2237
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:19,700
He was, like, Doomfist, uh, Doomfist rollouts there.

2238
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:22,660
I know.

2239
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:26,260
Actual top 500 lucky mate.

2240
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:28,040
I can't wait to play Rank soon.

2241
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:29,920
Rank comes out soon, apparently.

2242
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,840
Like, in, like, a couple...

2243
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:34,200
In, like, I think, like, today?

2244
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:34,600

stream not gonna lie but like this actually has been like i

2339
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:43,310
don't know i've been having a really fun time so far test
like that's why like as long i i it just looks really fun

2340
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:51,270
and i actually did have a lot of fun playing uh solos um in
general i think like when it does get more i think like at

2341
02:18:51,270 --> 02:19:00,890
the ui at the ui and like the the uh the visual effects when
you're fighting changes um like it's more refined i think

2342
02:19:00,890 --> 02:19:06,410
it'll look a lot better but i honestly when you're playing
it might visually might not be like super polished yet i

2343
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:10,970
mean it is alpha but all i care about is like I have fun,
you know?

2344
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:16,290
Yeah, like, I had a lot of fun.

2345
02:19:16,390 --> 02:19:16,970
I really did.

2346
02:19:17,910 --> 02:19:19,450
And, like, I like the tech.

2347
02:19:19,610 --> 02:19:21,430
I like the tech for, like, the characters.

2348
02:19:23,930 --> 02:19:29,150
And it's super, it seems really complicated if you know,
like, more of the fucking movement tech and stuff.

2349
02:19:29,470 --> 02:19:31,710
And, like, all the...

2350
02:19:31,710 --> 02:19:42,150
Like, the shit I was doing on Loki, like, the fucking juke
shit with the clones and stuff like it forces the person to

2351
02:19:42,150 --> 02:19:53,990
like 180 turn around when i fucking snap my finger like yeah
i hope it does stay around long um because you know rest in

2352
02:19:53,990 --> 02:20:01,410
peace Gundam evolution that shit died out really fast but
honestly i hope Marvel Rivals does stay around long and that

2353
02:20:01,410 --> 02:20:09,390
a lot of the shit gets repolished um because i honestly
think it does seem like a really fun game and i and
