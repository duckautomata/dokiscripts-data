1
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,230
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,490
I was not late.

3
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,290
I actually started exactly at like 5.

4
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:01,510
But then like because I didn't tab into the YouTube streaming tab on Chrome, it didn't register.

5
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,530
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

6
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,550
I was like, really?

7
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,590
It didn't register because I didn't fucking tab in.

8
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,990
That's actually bullshit.

9
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,110
Holy shit.

10
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,510
Also, why the fuck is the game not showing up?

11
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,370
Do you guys like the sound though?

12
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,530
Oh my god, it sounds so fucking cool though.

13
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,670
At least it sounds cool.

14
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,990
No!

15
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,250
Okay, give me a sec.

16
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,970
I need to figure out why.

17
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,070
The game... I swear, guys.

18
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,570
I swear to god, the game was showing up earlier.

19
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,670
I swear to god.

20
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,370
I'm not joking.

21
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,150
I could... the game was showing up.

22
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,010
I swear.

23
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,530
Okay, give me a sec.

24
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,010
I have an idea.

25
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,050
Okay, where's Marvel Rivals?

26
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,270
Where is it?

27
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,110
Marvel Rivals.

28
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,230
Oh my god, please.

29
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,990
Oh my... guys, I think it's one of those games.

30
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,030
I think it's one of those games where it needs to be like...

31
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,950
It can't be like...

32
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,670
It can't be like a game captured.

33
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,390
This is so dumb.

34
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:01,990
Okay, anyway.

35
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,450
I love Marvel Rivals.

36
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,770
I haven't... Sorry, it's not dumb.

37
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,150
Sorry!

38
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:06,790
Sorry!

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,670
Sorry!

40
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,790
Sorry!

41
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,090
It's not dumb!

42
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,610
Marvel Rivals, it's not dumb.

43
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,430
I didn't mean that.

44
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,410
I already love it already.

45
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,450
Oh my god.

46
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,410
I already loved the game so much already.

47
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,850
It's... I was the dumb one.

48
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,970
Not you.

49
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,630
I am dumb.

50
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,790
Anyway... Yeah!

51
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,970
Oh shit, wait, give me a sec guys.

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:43,390
It is not properly... It's not fucking... Guys, give me a sec.

53
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,830
It's a little scuffed, but that's how we like it here.

54
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,650
Give me a sec.

55
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,270
Sorry, I need to like redo this.

56
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,870
Okay, this is a little awkward.

57
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,850
Okay, give me a sec.

58
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,970
Alright, we gotta do this.

59
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,990
And then make sure everything is properly situated.

60
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,750
There we go!

61
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,050
Yeah!

62
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,010
By the way, I don't know if it's me.

63
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,170
I mean, it could be me, honestly, at this point.

64
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,690
But like, this game does not have full screen yet.

65
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,070
I think it's because it's an alpha... I hope it's just because it's like an alpha test.

66
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,650
So like, it's only in windowed mode.

67
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,750
Or like, it's literally only in windowed... I have no choice.

68
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,530
Like... It's literally only in windowed mode.

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,870
So like, it can't make it full screen.

70
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,230
So it's gonna be interesting.

71
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,530
But yes!

72
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,950
Surprise stream!

73
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,850
Because I got into the Marvel Rivals alpha test.

74
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,530
I don't know, is Sound Guy here?

75
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,190
Mario, think of the super chat.

76
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,010
Thank you, thank you!

77
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,090
You're real friends.

78
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,910
The real rivals were the friends we made along the way.

79
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,830
Thank you for the super chat.

80
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,650
Thank you, thank you!

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:05,210
I don't know... I don't know if Sound Guy is here today or are we gonna have an anarchy when it comes to sound balancing.

82
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,150
So we're gonna find out very soon.

83
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,070
It feels like... It feels like Sound Guy is not here.

84
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,070
Just because like...

85
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,190
Just because they didn't... Wait, no!

86
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,910
They're online!

87
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,550
I see you online on Discord, Sound Guy.

88
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,990
Swap to your Sound Guy mod account right now.

89
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,410
But yes!

90
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,410
I got into the closed alpha.

91
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,870
I know it wasn't in my schedule.

92
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,870
But like, it's the first day.

93
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,470
So I had to play it.

94
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:41,010
It's basically like Overwatch, but like what if it's like Marvel Super Heroes and villains instead?

95
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,110
So...

96
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,630
So...

97
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,190
Just like imagine... And it's six... It's like Overwatch 1.

98
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,890
Because it's six.

99
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,990
Six players in the team.

100
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,630
So it's literally OG Overwatch 1 with six players instead of five.

101
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,570
I assume it'll be like two tanks, two supports, two DPS.

102
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,590
It's so funny because...

103
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,190
There's no... No, there's no NDA for alpha.

104
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,170
It was just... They're just like stream it if you want.

105
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,290
And I'm like cool.

106
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,110
But like, you know...

107
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,550
I was looking through it.

108
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,590
I didn't sign any NDA.

109
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,450
I just got a key.

110
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,310
Um...

111
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,930
Anyway, I'm really excited.

112
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,930
It's like... It's closed alpha.

113
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,310
Uh... And uh... They...

114
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,870
Uh... Uh...

115
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,510
I knew a per... Like one... Somebody reached out to me.

116
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,550
Because... Did you read the fine print?

117
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,270
Well, the first mistake is thinking that...

118
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,210
I read.

119
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:33,870
Like...

120
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,310
The ac... You're right.

121
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,890
This is Overwatch 2.

122
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,430
This is what Overwatch 2 was supposed to be.

123
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,870
I'm just like hoping it's good.

124
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,950
I'm actually like, please be good.

125
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,630
Please be fucking good.

126
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,570
That's all I want.

127
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,730
That's literally all I want.

128
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,350
I just want an actual good Overwatch game.

129
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,670
Anyway...

130
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,230
Um... It was... So like...

131
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,130
You know when I tweeted it, I was like...

132
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,870
Please... Can I please have an alpha key Marvel Rivals?

133
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,330
Someone... Um... Someone reached out to me.

134
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,730
Because they knew the community manager in Marvel Rivals.

135
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,250
So they reached out to me.

136
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,610
Being like...

137
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,530
Oh yeah, I know this person in Marvel... Like community manager in Marvel Rivals.

138
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,690
We can help you get in touch with them.

139
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,650
And get you in.

140
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,070
And I was like...

141
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,410
Yay!

142
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,610
And then that's how I got in.

143
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,910
And it was so funny.

144
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,650
Because the moment I posted like...

145
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,310
My... Like posted the waiting room.

146
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,410
And stuff like that.

147
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,470
Like so many people like DM'd me.

148
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,110
And was like... How did you get in?

149
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,930
Like... A lot of my like streamer friends...

150
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,690
And like pro player friends...

Like DM'd me.

And was like...

00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,430
How did you get in Marvel Rivals?

154
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,290
And I was like... Do you...

155
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,270
Do you think...

156
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,890
You can help us get in?

157
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,190
I was just like...

158
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,050
I don't know.

159
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,250
I mean I can ask.

160
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,030
I don't know.

161
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,630
Like I got in because like...

162
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,370
Somebody reached out to me.

163
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,710
And said they'll give me a key.

164
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,310
So like... Oh I don't know.

165
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:00,750
I'll try.

166
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,370
It was so funny.

167
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,510
Like everybody was like...

168
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,110
Reaching out to me.

169
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,430
Like...

170
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,950
How did you get in?

171
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,190
I'm like...

172
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,510
Nep-tism baby.

173
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,150
The Doki privilege.

174
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,870
Sound guy, where the fuck are you?

175
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,190
I know you're here.

176
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,210
Are you here to balance for me?

177
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:23,950
Alright.

178
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,610
Okay.

179
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,810
It's gonna be a little bit of an anarchy.

180
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,770
Because I don't know if sound guy is actually here.

181
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,630
So...

182
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,470
How's the sound so far?

183
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,430
Let's get in.

184
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,690
Logged in.

185
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,210
Alright.

186
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,170
Oh my god!

187
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,110
I can actually have my own name!

188
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,530
Because nobody else is...

189
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,570
I swear...

190
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,410
If somebody else has an alpha test...

191
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,010
And stole my fucking name...

192
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,190
I swear to you...

193
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,450
I swear...

194
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,650
If someone else is also in the alpha test...

195
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,570
And purposely took my name...

196
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,270
I swear to fucking god.

197
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,070
This is also the reason why...

198
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,710
I can't use my name in any of the games these days.

199
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,450
Because people already took Doki Bird.

200
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,190
It's like I got to fucking use the real female.

201
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,130
Real female Doki.

202
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,110
Alright.

203
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,250
Yay!

204
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,430
Okay.

205
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,510
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

206
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:17,570
Okay.

207
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,070
Thank god.

208
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,510
Thank fucking god.

209
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,550
I was like...

210
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,430
I swear.

211
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,590
How do I know what's a tank?

212
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,230
All classes?

213
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,350
What the fuck?

214
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,670
Okay.

215
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,030
I assume Vanguard...

216
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,470
Vanguard would be tank.

217
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,130
Well obviously Bruce Banner...

218
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,630
Oh my gosh.

219
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,370
Obviously Bruce Banner will be the tank.

220
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,530
Doctor Strange is a tank?

221
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,810
He's a fucking surgeon.

222
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,230
Wait.

223
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,670
What?

224
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,730
Doctor Strange is a tank?

225
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,410
Alright.

226
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,550
Doctor Strange.

227
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,590
Difficulty.

228
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,350
Three stars.

229
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,010
As a Sorcerer Supreme.

230
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:52,810
Ooh.

231
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,410
Wait.

232
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,330
This is really cool.

233
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,170
I know Groot Magneto...

234
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,230
Oh Penny Parker.

235
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:57,510
Yeah.

236
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,550
These guys make sense.

237
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,150
But Doctor Strange?

238
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,070
He's a fucking wizard.

239
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,290
Like fucking...

240
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,470
The Hulk can just break his back.

241
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,110
Oh he's a four star.

242
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,370
Brilliant scientist.

243
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,310
Doctor...

244
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,550
Oh wait.

245
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,750
Is this like all the skins?

246
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,490
Oh no.

247
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,570
This is like middle form between them.

248
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,210
And this is ultimate Hulk.

249
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,890
And then there's like skinny ass nerd.

250
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,710
And there's Groot.

251
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,310
That's so cool though.

252
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,410
Seeing all the tanks and stuff.

253
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,150
Are you okay?

254
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,330
Blink won a smile if Kevin is pointing a gun to you.

255
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,750
Ninja thank you for the super chat.

256
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,110
Thank you.

257
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,730
Thank you.

258
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,950
Is he actually super OP now?

259
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,790
Doctor Strange in like comic lore?

260
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,830
Oh he's like the easiest.

261
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,490
Nice.

262
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,450
I love all the animations so far.

263
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,490
Oh my god.

264
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,190
He's so old now.

265
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,810
He has a beard.

266
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,190
I only remember like Michael Fassbender.

267
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,850
Magneto.

268
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,330
And...

269
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,010
Oh my gosh.

270
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,190
I'm so sorry.

271
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,650
Is it Ian McKellen?

272
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,510
Is Ian McKellen the other...

273
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,590
The older Magneto?

274
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,670
The Magneto is old as fuck.

275
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,190
The master of magnetism.

276
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,350
Bends even the strongest meta.

277
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,290
Oh my god.

278
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:03,930
He's so fucked.

279
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,410
He's like the buffest fucking grandpa out there.

280
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,250
What a buff grandpa.

281
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,830
And then there's Penny Parker.

282
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,550
I remember hearing her from the Spiderverse.

283
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,170
Oh she's like 10 years old.

284
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,470
She's like a diva.

285
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,710
They're like, we need diva.

286
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,650
It's like, they're like...

287
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:23,510
Okay.

288
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,210
They're like...

289
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,250
Overwatch we need...

290
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,630
We need a diva character.

291
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,690
Overwatch.

292
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,770
Why don't we use Penny Parker.

293
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,250
Oh my god.

294
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,070
It's literally...

295
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,310
It's literally a diva.

296
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,470
But for spiders.

297
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,210
Yeah.

298
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,450
Penny Parker may be young, but she bravely stands on the front line to protect the web of life.

299
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,230
Alright.

300
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,110
Anyway, yeah, Marvel D.Va, exactly.

301
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,070
What's the team?

302
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,950
Team up was like...

303
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,910
Oh, Ragnarok, Rebirth, Asgardian Solas, team up abilities.

304
00:11:52,390 --> 00:12:00,150
Yeah, like if you have like certain like characters picked, you can have like special combos and stuff too.

305
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,330
So...

306
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,490
Uh...

307
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,090
Mahela lands a final hit in defeating an enemy.

308
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,550
She can instantly resurrect Loki in the respawn phase.

309
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,430
If Loki is alive, a crow flying to him granting blue armor.

310
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,370
So you can like have like team up.

311
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,750
So like do like meta.

312
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,970
Like I don't know what the meta is, but like you can have like specific.

313
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,130
This is not fair!

314
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,990
There's three team ups.

315
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,730
What the fuck is the three team up?

316
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,190
Uh, you can bring up the overall sound.

317
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,570
Okay, I'll bring up the overall sound.

318
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,030
Uh...

319
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,890
Alright.

320
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,130
What's the three guys?

321
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,190
Hawk charges Doctor Strange and Iron Man with gamma radiation.

322
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,070
When Doctor Strange uses master, he unleashes excess gamma energy.

323
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,350
When Iron Man uses armor overdrive, he will initiate a gamma upgrade.

324
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,570
I feel like the three combos might like is can actually be like super OP.

325
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,490
Because it's three people.

326
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,630
Three is more than two.

327
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,670
DPS tank.

328
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,970
I guess it makes the tank a DPS too, right?

329
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,310
Hawk charges Doctor Strange and Iron Man with gamma radiation.

330
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,090
When Doctor Strange uses maelstorm and madness, he unleashes an excess gamma energy.

331
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,590
When Iron Man uses armor overdrive, he will initiate a gamma upgrade.

332
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,010
But Hawk gets nothing.

333
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,030
Isn't that passive?

334
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,070
He gets like passive.

335
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,770
Hawk charges Doctor Strange.

336
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,090
Oh!

337
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,710
He gives them...

338
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,850
I guess like if you have Hawk...

339
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,790
I guess like Hawk is the main tank.

340
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,250
And then Doctor Strange is off tank.

341
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,730
And then he like gives the off tank and the DPS energy or something.

342
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,910
Because like he feeds them radiation.

343
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,130
Because like as we all know...

344
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,610
Radi...

345
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,570
A little bit of radiation is okay.

346
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,490
Oh, it was wonder.

347
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,630
Because like Hawk is sort of like, you know...

348
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,930
He's like fully radiant.

349
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,010
So like I'm just thinking like...

350
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,070
Is this fucked up to say?

351
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,650
Like...

352
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:53,030
Wouldn't like being close to the Hawk potentially give you cancer?

353
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,970
If you're like a normal person?

354
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,970
Because he's giving off...

355
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,070
He's giving off radiation.

356
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,670
Yeah.

357
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,910
It's gamma.

358
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,050
But he...

359
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,450
He has so much.

360
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,250
But he'll be so smart though.

361
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,870
Alright, that's interesting.

362
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,470
What about the other ones?

363
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,310
Okay, Duelist is Hela.

364
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,990
Wait, Loki is a fucking support player?

365
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,990
Oh my God, Loki is the heal slot.

366
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,510
Wait, how much does he heal?

367
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,150
He eats gamma.

368
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,250
Fair enough.

369
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,890
What greater thrill is there?

370
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,990
For God of mischief than to outsmart his foes.

371
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,990
The cunning trickster Loki uses his illusions and shape-shifting abilities to weave in and out.

372
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,770
Okay.

373
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,650
Oh, there's cosmetics.

374
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,990
I forgot about that.

375
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,830
Alright.

376
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,830
Oh.

377
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,850
Loki, you can't say that.

378
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,830
But like...

379
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,830
Am I...

380
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,310
Am I wrong?

381
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,950
Oh my God.

382
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,750
I forgot to look at the most important things.

383
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,770
The...

384
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,870
The abilities.

385
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,370
Alright.

386
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,870
Where's the heals?

387
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,190
Regeneration domain.

388
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,390
Wait, does he not heal anybody?

389
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,290
God of mischief.

390
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,130
Shape-shifts into a targeted alley or anywhere and use all the heroes.

391
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,770
Doppelganger.

392
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,850
Wait, he doesn't even heal people.

393
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,190
How is he a fucking support?

394
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,910
He's useless.

395
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,670
He is...

396
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,570
Oh, his basic attack heals.

397
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:36,930
Wait.

398
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,050
Okay, there we go.

399
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,330
Nevermind.

400
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,930
I didn't fully heal.

401
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,330
I didn't fully read it.

402
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,870
His fire missiles...

403
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,210
Oh, okay.

404
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:41,630
There we go.

405
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,350
To heal allies.

406
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,830
I saw deal damage.

407
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,750
Alright.

408
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,470
He does heal.

409
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,130
Okay.

410
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,830
He's not useless.

411
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,770
Wait, is...

412
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,070
Oh, no.

413
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:49,850
Okay.

414
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,030
No, you have to aim.

415
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,130
So he's not like the Mercy.

416
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:52,930
Wait.

417
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,370
Where's the Mercy character in this game?

418
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,630
Where's the...

419
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,470
I want to know who's the next Mercy.

420
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:04,730
Okay.

421
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,350
You have to aim for this.

422
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,910
Okay.

423
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,190
You really don't...

424
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,590
Yeah, Loki is like Mora.

425
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,770
Where's the...

426
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,190
Where's the crutch?

427
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,590
Alright.

428
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,450
So...

429
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,210
Oh, wow.

430
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,250
The skin is so cool.

431
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:20,990
Wait.

432
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,650
I like the skin.

433
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,110
That's actually a really cool skin.

434
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,510
I can't believe they gave Bruce all the cancer, right?

435
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,050
Thank you for the super chat.

436
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,490
Thank you.

437
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:29,950
Thank you.

438
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,890
That just reminds me of the cancer gun in Harley Quinn.

439
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,310
Wait.

440
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,830
Rocket is a fucking support?

441
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,650
Wait.

442
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:38,890
Is Luke...

443
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,670
Is Luna Snow the Mercy?

444
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,290
Or are they all just...

445
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,890
Do you have to aim for all of them?

446
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,050
Let's see.

447
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,790
Fire, ice that shoots...

448
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,210
Heals enemies?

449
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,590
How does ice heal an enemy?

450
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,670
Like...

451
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,370
Oh my god.

452
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:51,870
You're injured.

453
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,270
Here.

454
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,610
Fucking suck on some ice.

455
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,130
Don't worry.

456
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,890
I got you.

457
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:00,850
Suck on these.

458
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,850
It's cute.

459
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,350
I have no idea who Luna Snow is.

460
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,050
Yeah.

461
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,870
It fires ice shots that damage enemies or heals allies.

462
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,890
I am reading.

463
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,170
Put ice on it.

464
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,650
Oh my god.

465
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,070
You're right.

466
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,990
You put ice on it.

467
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,170
What the fuck?

468
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:18,810
Wait.

469
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,530
I am reading.

470
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,010
See?

471
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,670
Fires ice shots that damage enemies or heal allies.

472
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,590
It literally said she throws ice at you when you get healed.

473
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,950
Oh my god.

474
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,710
I don't know who to play.

475
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,150
They're all like so interesting.

476
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,650
All right.

477
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,130
Let's see.

478
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,810
I can't believe Rocket Raccoon is a fucking support player.

479
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,150
If you're not careful with Spider-Man E's, you can kill your allies.

480
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,450
No!

481
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,730
Thank you for the super chat, Cranberry.

482
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,530
Wait.

483
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,910
Rocket is like the easiest.

484
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,410
Is he the...

485
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,970
Shoot bouncing spheres to heal allies?

486
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,830
How does that work?

487
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,110
Heal those enemies.

488
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,290
Junkie.

489
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:01,970
Yeah.

490
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,670
That's what I'm saying.

491
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,210
He's support.

492
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,870
He shoots like...

493
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:05,970
Yeah.

494
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,930
They're all...

495
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,390
Oh my gosh.

496
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,510
All of them requires aim.

497
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,390
I like that.

498
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,450
I like that.

499
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,170
As long as it's not like melee.

500
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,650
I'm fine with that.

501
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,090
Oh my god.

502
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,630
There's so many.

503
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,210
It's so hard.

504
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,410
Oh my god.

505
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,390
Bounty Hunter.

506
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,390
Rocket Raccoon.

507
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:18,690
Wait.

508
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,410
That's so fucking cool.

509
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,750
The skins are already so cool too.

510
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:23,810
Okay.

511
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,650
What about Duelist?

512
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,730
Storm.

513
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,550
The Punisher.

514
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,830
Oh, I like that.

515
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,470
I like that like when you hover over it.

516
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,170
When you hover over it, like it...

517
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,870
I feel like a lot of people...

518
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,370
A lot of Genji mains are gonna be like...

519
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,110
I feel like...

520
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,090
Let me look at his abilities.

521
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,370
Oh, that's so cool.

522
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,170
I can't help it.

523
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,270
I know I should play the game.

524
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,130
Oh, he's the hardest too.

525
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:46,990
Just like Genji.

526
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,350
Also, sound guy.

527
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,750
Raise the volume up a little bit.

528
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,530
Oh, there's Spider Punk too.

529
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,290
Oh, all right.

530
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:56,990
Let's see.

531
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,490
MVP.

532
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,510
Sorry.

533
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,310
I'm like...

534
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,830
I'm like too busy looking at all the fucking cosmetics and stuff because it looks so cool.

535
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,410
Wait.

536
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,310
That's so cool.

537
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,350
Holy shit.

538
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,590
Holy fuck.

539
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,330
And then there's the emote.

540
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,650
Is that just a default?

541
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,090
And there's the spray.

542
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,190
What about the abilities?

543
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,590
Spider power?

544
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,470
All right.

545
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,470
It's just punching.

546
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,870
You have webs.

547
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,650
Spectacular spin.

548
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,330
Oh my God.

549
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,830
What?

550
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,790
Oh shit.

551
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,770
There's like rollouts.

552
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,050
Oh my God.

553
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,150
Get ready for the Spider-Man rollouts video.

554
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,330
Here are our rollouts.

555
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,390
Here are some Spider-Man rollout tech.

556
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,790
I can see it now.

557
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,390
I can see it.

558
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,730
Get over here.

559
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,010
And then you can...

560
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,790
There's the combo.

561
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,430
You can put them up in the air.

562
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,850
Let's see.

563
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,470
Oh, you can crawl walls.

564
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,110
I mean, of course, you're Spider-Man.

565
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,970
Like that makes sense actually.

566
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,630
That is actually sick.

567
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:00,990
Fuck.

568
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,730
There's so many.

569
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,690
Wait.

570
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:02,990
Storm.

571
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,130
Apparently she flies.

572
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,030
Oh, she flies.

573
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,530
I like flying.

574
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,670
Okay.

575
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,990
An Omega level mutant.

576
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,930
Oh, her costume isn't as cool though.

577
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,870
This feels like just a common variant.

578
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,570
Oh.

579
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,190
Okay.

580
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,190
That's cool.

581
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,950
I like how like play of the game is called MVP.

582
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,190
I think Spider-Man...

583
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,310
I think Genji players are gonna play Spider-Man.

584
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,490
Honestly.

585
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,830
I feel like.

586
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,550
The 90s...

587
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,010
Yeah, but it's not...

588
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,750
It's not different.

589
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,590
It's not different.

590
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,390
It's just a recolor.

591
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,790
Like literally this is like default and then this is a recolor.

592
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,150
But it says 97 Storm, but this is literally just a recolor.

593
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,110
Weather control.

594
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,090
Wait, I am flying.

595
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,150
Oh my God.

596
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,830
I am flying.

597
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:54,970
What is this?

598
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,450
Switch the weather to empower allies.

599
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:57,870
Oh God.

600
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,690
That is so confusing.

601
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,870
Switch the weather to empower allies.

602
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,210
Tornado grants a movement boost.

603
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,690
Thunder grants a damage boost.

604
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,870
So it's like when Lucio swaps from healing to speed.

605
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,950
You can control the weather around you for speed or damage.

606
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,390
Yeah, it's literally Lucio, but not a healer.

607
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,870
Now the power of the weather to empower Storm.

608
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,270
Tornado grants...

609
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,090
Wait, that's the same thing.

610
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,290
Thunder grants a damage boost and summons lightning to inflict damage.

611
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,810
Wait, so this is...

612
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,970
I guess like a stronger version of weather control.

613
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:34,970
Storm...

614
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,890
Yeah, it's Storm Lucio.

615
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,270
And then there's the lightning bolt.

616
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,630
And then...

617
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,870
This draws in enemies.

618
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,690
Alright, Lucio but flying.

619
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,050
Alright, who should we look at next, guys?

620
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,590
Who do we look at next?

621
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,090
I think she's always just flying.

622
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:50,970
I think so.

623
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,150
There doesn't seem to be a cooldown.

624
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,070
Uh...

625
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,640
Maybe she grants a stronger...

626
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,040
Uh...

627
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,660
We'll look at magic.

628
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
She's new, right?

629
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,320
I've never heard of her before in Marvel.

630
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:06,860
I've never heard of her before in Marvel.

631
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,710
Oh, this is awesome.

632
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,190
Wait, no.

633
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,390
Oh, what?

634
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,550
What the fuck?

635
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,830
Wait, is this like a different form of her?

636
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,370
Holy shit.

637
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,330
Who the fuck is she?

638
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,870
She's an OG?

639
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,290
I don't remember magic.

640
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,650
Oh, she turns into a demon.

641
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,070
Holy shit.

642
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,930
Okay, she's pretty cool.

643
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,910
And there's her emotes.

644
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,510
Abilities.

645
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,990
See, soul sword.

646
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,190
There's dark child.

647
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,010
Gaining enhancements to all...

648
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,070
Oh, this is when she transforms into a demon, right?

649
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,990
I'm pretty sure.

650
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,310
Yeah.

651
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,810
And then stepping disc.

652
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:52,790
What's this?

653
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,030
Oh, wait.

654
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,790
Teleport.

655
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,210
Oh!

656
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,030
You can like dodge ults with this.

657
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,670
Like, if somebody wants to like hit you, just dodge them with a teleport.

658
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,050
Teleport's behind you.

659
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,090
And then umbral incursion.

660
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,490
Dash forward and launch a new ability.

661
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,250
And then enemy upward.

662
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,830
Holy shit.

663
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,910
This is all like...

664
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,910
Oh my god.

665
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,290
There's like so many different abilities.

666
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,510
So you have to learn so many different like characters and abilities.

667
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,170
Strike forward.

668
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,830
This is like the melee build.

669
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,110
Magic is just...

670
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,030
Doki bird.

671
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,190
Thank you for the super chat.

672
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,690
Thank you.

673
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,350
Thank you.

674
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,690
Limbo's might converge...

675
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,470
Converge damage inflicted onto enemies into bonus health 2.

676
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,850
Oh, that's cool.

677
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,830
That's pretty cool.

678
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,430
All right.

679
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,670
All right.

680
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,810
Who else do we want to look at next?

681
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,010
I'll look at one more person and then we're gonna go...

682
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,890
We're gonna go straight into practice.

683
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,870
Because I want to look at the abilities in the training arena.

684
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,290
It's been like...

685
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,370
Oh my gosh.

686
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,290
There's so much information.

687
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:58,910
Punisher?

688
00:23:59,330 --> 00:23:59,850
All right.

689
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,690
We'll look at Punisher.

690
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,630
Okay.

691
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,190
Punisher.

692
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,350
I'm not gonna look at the tank because I'm never playing tank.

693
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,390
No matter what.

694
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,410
What game it is.

695
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,370
I'll never play tank.

696
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,590
Oh, shit.

697
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,070
Okay.

698
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,190
The costume is pretty sick.

699
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,770
Scarlet Witch.

700
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,790
All right.

701
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,310
MVP.

702
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,690
Oh, that's pretty cool.

703
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,290
Is he Reaper?

704
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,790
He has two shotguns?

705
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,410
Is this like the Reaper equivalent?

706
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:33,810
Okay.

707
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,610
It's Reaper.

708
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,170
If Reaper and Soldier had a baby.

709
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,930
Because this has to be the shotgun, right?

710
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,890
Yeah.

711
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:39,890
Okay.

712
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,950
They just...

713
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,930
They combine Reaper and Soldier.

714
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:45,710
All right.

715
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,550
All right.

716
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,390
Final judgment.

717
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,690
Unleash two galleys, guns, and missiles to attack.

718
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:52,870
Missiles?

719
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,950
Holy shit.

720
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,290
What?

721
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:55,790
Okay.

722
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,290
It's their dad.

723
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,110
Wait.

724
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,930
What the fuck?

725
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,750
You get to launch a hook to fucking travel far.

726
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,530
Wait.

727
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,850
You can have a turret as well?

728
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,410
This is a DPS.

729
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:09,990
Oh, my God.

730
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,470
Oh, no.

731
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,470
You are the turret.

732
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,010
Never mind.

733
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,170
This is like tower defense.

734
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,070
You also...

735
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,850
You control your own turret.

736
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,930
And then there's a grenade.

737
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,530
Oh, and then there's like Bangalore grenade.

738
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,430
Like Bangalore smokes too.

739
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,370
That's a spirit from Veo's Shores.

740
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:29,650
Wait.

741
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,070
What?

742
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,190
That's your passive.

743
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,790
You have like...

744
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,250
You have like mini walls.

745
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,870
Alpha fashion.

746
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:38,930
Oh, my God.

747
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,090
Oh, my God.

748
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,510
Just so you guys know, this is the alpha test.

749
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,870
So you know like after the alpha...

750
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,870
You know that like after all of this, like they're going to nerf people so hard.

751
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,430
Walls as a passive.

752
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:01,730
You guys know damn well like in the alpha fashion, fashion had a fucking shield.

753
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,990
So everything you see here, if it seems too OP, do not worry.

754
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,950
They're going to fucking nerf the shit out of them later.

755
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,930
Because they never...

756
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,210
They never keep it that easy.

757
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,270
Okay, I want to do...

758
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,850
I don't want to be...

759
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,550
Wait, I don't want to be Hulk.

760
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,250
Do I...

761
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,070
Who do I play?

762
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,550
Alright.

763
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,930
I'll be...

764
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,250
I want to be Loki.

765
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,470
Because I can heal.

766
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,630
Okay, I'm going to do...

767
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,350
I get to tutorial.

768
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,510
I want to know the tutorial of Loki.

769
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,670
Better take advantage of it right now.

770
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,150
I guess like Galacta is like the tutorial...

771
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,370
Like the announcer slash tutorial.

772
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,390
Oh my God.

773
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,450
Oh my God, the sensitivity.

774
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,510
Holy shit, the sensitivity is so bad.

775
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,750
Okay.

776
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,450
I think the worst part about this being alpha is that...

777
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,430
Is that you don't have a converter yet.

778
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,710
There's no...

779
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,890
There's no converter.

780
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,850
Oh, not the default.

781
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,950
No.

782
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,790
Okay, reticle animation.

783
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,290
No animation, please.

784
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:09,730
My god.

785
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,550
Colored green...

786
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,470
Dot size, maybe a little bigger.

787
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,970
Is that big enough?

788
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,230
Yeah.

789
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:18,930
Alright.

790
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,990
Okay, settings.

791
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,410
Ally health bars...

792
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,370
Okay, I just have no communication.

793
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,230
Let me make sure I'm not accident...

794
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,230
Oh, I am lagging a little.

795
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,750
Just guys, maybe we're not gonna do high.

796
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,770
High.

797
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,050
Medium.

798
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,750
Let's go!

799
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,090
There we go.

800
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:47,070
Yeah, that should be a little better, right?

801
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,510
Communication.

802
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,510
Push to talk.

803
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,390
We'll do that.

804
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,130
Where's melee?

805
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,230
Uh, melee... where the fuck is melee?

806
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,510
Melee!

807
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,510
There.

808
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:02,990
Okay.

809
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:03,910
That should be good.

810
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,250
Okay, I think that was good.

811
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,470
Yeah.

812
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:09,710
Alright.

813
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:12,830
Okay.

814
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,850
Oh, that dot is way too fucking big.

815
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,430
Nevermind.

816
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,110
Melee's always been B though.

817
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,930
It has always been B.

818
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,610
It's never...

819
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,470
Okay, we're gonna put one.

820
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:25,890
Um...

821
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,230
I think like my melee was...

822
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,390
Oh my gosh, I actually forgot.

823
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,810
I always get confused between my mouse melees.

824
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,530
Um, I think this was melee.

825
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:33,890
Okay, I think that was melee.

826
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,110
And then my communication was this.

827
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,470
And then my communication was this.

828
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,170
Alright, let's go.

829
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,870
Let's run.

830
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,830
Oh, it's so weird.

831
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,390
It feels like I'm playing Soldier but I can't run.

832
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,290
Hold B to scope out the structures?

833
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,630
Hold B to scope out the structures?

834
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:48,850
Okay.

835
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,450
How do I break through it?

836
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,030
Do I shoot it?

837
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:53,170
How do I break through it?

838
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:53,170
Do I shoot it?

839
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,410
Oh, what?

840
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,130
Okay.

841
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,430
Pass clear.

842
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,410
Head to the target spot.

843
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,710
Pass clear.

844
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:01,710
Head to the target spot.

845
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,890
It's so hard to get through.

846
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,230
It's so weird.

847
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,710
Because like, I feel like I could run but I can't.

848
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,270
And then, how do I do this?

849
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,830
Oh my god, MAGA!

850
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,730
Okay, use...

851
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,850
Pass Q to transform into Hulk.

852
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:19,990
Alright.

853
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,770
I'm Hulk time.

854
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,510
And then I fucking smash.

855
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:25,610
Smash!

856
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,410
Oh, okay.

857
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,010
Nevermind.

858
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:28,810
I'll just open for...

859
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,330
Hey guys.

860
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,890
Stand by and press to open.

861
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,410
Unleash.

862
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,490
Indestructible.

863
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,890
Oh shit!

864
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,490
Okay, and then...

865
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,230
Neck clap.

866
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,030
And then, what's this?

867
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,870
This is the shield.

868
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,390
And...

869
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,670
And then I hold him there.

870
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,550
Okay.

871
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,370
Okay.

872
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,230
I get it.

873
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,490
Why not let Hulk smash?

874
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,290
Let me smash!

875
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,690
Alright, this is the support.

876
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,150
Oh, there you go.

877
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:03,570
I have a dash.

878
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,790
Okay, I have a dash.

879
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,170
DC Fuzz Ninja.

880
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,250
Thank you, Mr. Chad.

881
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,070
Thank you, thank you.

882
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,310
Oh my god, I'm just shooting orbs.

883
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,270
It's so slow!

884
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,650
Please, heal faster, Rocky Raccoon!

885
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,470
Okay, stand by and unleash...

886
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,990
Cosmic Yarn Amplifier.

887
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,910
How do I do that?

888
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,350
Oh, it's like damage!

889
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:26,870
Okay.

890
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,230
Don't worry, I got you!

891
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,450
I got you guys!

892
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,310
Oh, it's like damage boost.

893
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,170
It's like all of us are damage boost.

894
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,930
And hit.

895
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,570
Alright.

896
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,370
Looks like you're back to playing as the Punisher.

897
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,030
Rockets here.

898
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,910
That means the team up ability, Ammo Overload, is now activated.

899
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,370
Oh, I have the team up!

900
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,470
Yeah, what's my team up?

901
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,390
I forgot already.

902
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,190
Stay in the device's range and take them down.

903
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,870
Boost up with it.

904
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,170
Okay.

905
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,410
Don't worry, I'm TPS.

906
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,250
Okay.

907
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,650
Oh, I don't have to reload with this!

908
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,630
Oh, I don't have to reload with this!

909
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,330
Yeah, that was Punisher.

910
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,430
I don't have to reload!

911
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,790
Yeah, infinite ammo for team up.

912
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,650
Oh my god, there's like so much like...

913
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,150
tech.

914
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:20,990
There's...

915
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,670
There's so much tech you have to know!

916
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,470
Oh my god!

917
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,810
Oh my god!

918
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,810
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat!

919
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,830
Thank you, thank you!

920
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,990
Cos like every... there's like team ups.

921
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,530
There's team ups, there's like specific abilities that benefit other...

922
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,190
other like heroes.

923
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,850
There's like...

924
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,870
so many different abilities to use.

925
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,950
Oh, like my brain's overloading just looking... trying to...

926
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,650
There's a lot of mechanics, holy shit!

927
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,210
You know what?

928
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,190
We don't need to practice.

929
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,010
Let's go straight in.

930
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,370
Nice.

931
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,030
I'm gonna be a support player for now.

932
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,630
Cos like they can't...

933
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,630
Wait, they will absolutely blame me if we die.

934
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,990
Oh my god!

935
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:07,290
Oh my god!

936
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,110
They will absolutely blame me.

937
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,430
We have... we have a tank already.

938
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,070
Oh my god, someone willingly willing to play tank?

939
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,630
Let's fucking go!

940
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,490
Oh my...

941
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,610
Guys, we have a real lineup!

942
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,590
We have two DPS!

943
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,870
Well, Ray, that's on you for not fucking picking first.

944
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,390
You gotta be a tank now, Ray.

945
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,430
Dang it, Loki.

946
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,150
This is why you're not meta.

947
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,870
Alright.

948
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,170
Okay.

949
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,090
Ray, you better pick an off tank.

950
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,630
Or like a main tank.

951
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,910
You better pick Hulk.

952
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,370
I mean, they already...

953
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,450
Someone picked Doctor Strange!

954
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,790
That's a tank already!

955
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,250
I invented every trick!

956
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,990
Okay, so all I have to do is shoot them.

957
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,110
Oh, guys!

958
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,630
I did not read the abilities.

959
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,130
I...

960
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,070
I forgot!

961
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,610
I forgot Loki's abilities, guys!

962
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,690
I forgot Loki's abilities, guys!

963
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,330
Okay.

964
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,830
Okay.

965
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,050
Oh, that's decoy.

966
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:13,530
Okay.

967
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,750
And then...

968
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,830
Oh, I can swap with my decoy!

969
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,210
Oh no!

970
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,670
Okay, and then...

971
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,210
Okay, okay, I got it.

972
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,790
I'm gonna put decoy here, so if I need to I'll swap.

973
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,310
We got this!

974
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,550
We're so healthy, guys!

975
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,030
Oh, God!

976
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,070
Don't worry!

977
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,410
Don't worry, I got him!

978
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,230
Oh, God!

979
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:41,950
I got him!

980
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,290
Don't worry, I'm healing!

981
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,150
Please!

982
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,230
I'm healing!

983
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:45,830
Don't worry!

984
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,250
I'm healing!

985
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,890
Holy shit!

986
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,530
The visual clutter!

987
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,010
Feels just like Overwatch!

988
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,130
Hahaha!

989
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,930
Wait, my decoys can shoot as well?

990
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,370
Okay, not gonna lie, That visual clutter is actually insane.

991
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,810
Wait, we have to kill Baby Banner too?

992
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,390
I killed Baby Banner, guys.

993
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,470
Hahaha!

994
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,430
Hahaha!

995
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,170
Wait, I'm actually gaming.

996
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,510
Wait, I'm better than the fucking actual DPS player.

997
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,970
I should just play DPS.

998
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,150
Okay, get that decoy in there.

999
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:24,890
Go in there!

1000
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,470
Shoot for me!

1001
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,670
Oh, my God!

1002
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,110
I'm so close!

1003
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,430
I'm so fucking good at this game!

1004
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:30,570
Hahaha!

1005
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,030
Okay.

1006
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,990
No, I'm playing against real people!

1007
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,770
Okay, don't worry.

1008
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,590
And then we have to kill Baby Hulk as well.

1009
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,950
Wait, these guys are bad.

1010
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,170
Hahaha!

1011
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:45,450
Hahaha!

1012
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,470
Wait, these guys are pretty fucking bad.

1013
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,650
Hahaha!

1014
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:51,630
Hahaha!

1015
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,530
Alright, nice.

1016
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,090
Alright, I can kill...

1017
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,190
I can kill KC.

1018
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,490
I can kill KC.

1019
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,490
I can kill KC.

1020
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:00,990
Hahaha!

1021
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,250
I'm playing with 620 frames.

1022
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,170
Hahaha!

1023
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,770
Hulk is actually D.Va.

1024
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,090
I know.

1025
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:18,170
We're like actually spawn capping them!

1026
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,650
Oh, this is so sad!

1027
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:22,870
Hahaha!

1028
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,250
Oh, my God!

1029
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,470
Did you see the damage?

1030
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,510
Oh, my God!

1031
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,170
Bro!

1032
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,870
Alright, nice.

1033
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,690
What is my...

1034
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,970
Oh, I can be him!

1035
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,290
I'm DPS now!

1036
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,670
Hahaha!

1037
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,130
Do you feel proud?

1038
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,790
Yeah, I pretty much do.

1039
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,730
I'm so proud of myself.

1040
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,470
I'm literally spawn camping these guys.

1041
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,930
I'm DPS now.

1042
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,830
Shoot for me.

1043
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,530
Bro, they're so fucking babies!

1044
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,770
Look at me!

1045
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:58,630
I'm DPS.

1046
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,110
This poor team.

1047
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,050
Don't worry, I can heal too.

1048
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,410
Okay, never mind.

1049
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:05,870
He's dead.

1050
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,070
Whoa!

1051
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,230
What are you doing?

1052
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,170
I can aim!

1053
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:10,470
Hahaha!

1054
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:12,990
Hahaha!

1055
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,810
What the fuck are you doing?

1056
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,390
I can...

1057
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,810
I know how to aim!

1058
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:19,890
Hahaha!

1059
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,390
What is the objective?

1060
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,430
We're defending!

1061
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,410
They haven't defended yet!

1062
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,110
I mean, they haven't attacked yet!

1063
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,850
That's the objective!

1064
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,250
Look at our Genji go!

1065
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,490
Look at our Spider-Man Genji go!

1066
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:35,590
Hahaha!

1067
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,370
Holy shit!

1068
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,550
That's so sad!

1069
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,910
Can you swap out?

1070
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,390
Yeah, but then like...

1071
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,470
I might as well be a fucking DPS.

1072
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,630
Because I can actually aim.

1073
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,970
Like, what is he gonna do?

1074
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,610
He's dead.

1075
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,410
I'm DPS now!

1076
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:54,930
There we go.

1077
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,390
Oh, Hulk is the baby D.Va!

1078
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,390
Penny doesn't go out of mech form!

1079
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,030
It's okay, we can kill a fucking raccoon too.

1080
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,650
Fuck raccoons.

1081
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,570
Oh shit, let me heal you.

1082
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,950
Don't worry.

1083
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,310
Don't worry, I have regen.

1084
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,090
Don't worry guys.

1085
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,130
Hahaha!

1086
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,270
Typical Genji thing!

1087
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:17,550
Bro, they're like swapping characters that they haven't got in a real spawn!

1088
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,450
That's so sad!

1089
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,590
Oh, that's actually so sad!

1090
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,730
Don't worry, I got you guys.

1091
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,050
Don't worry, I can aim.

1092
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:26,550
Hahaha!

1093
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,050
Where's the surrender button?

1094
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,010
Let's get rid of this tiny spider.

1095
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,950
Bro, I'm sorry.

1096
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,370
This is not balanced.

1097
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,210
Hahaha!

1098
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,710
Here.

1099
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,190
Don't worry.

1100
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:41,890
Here you go guys.

1101
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,030
Easy.

1102
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,730
I feel like...

1103
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,670
Honestly, like...

1104
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,710
This is not fair for this enemy team.

1105
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,050
And my Loki's also shooting too!

1106
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,330
It's...

1107
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:54,730
Hahaha!

1108
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,730
Don't worry, I got you!

1109
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,690
Don't worry!

1110
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,330
Alright, I wanna copy... copy you.

1111
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,590
That's fucking right.

1112
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,870
I'm tank now too!

1113
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,370
Get over here!

1114
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,110
I'm also tank!

1115
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,170
Hahaha!

1116
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,150
I don't know what I'm doing, but I can fly now!

1117
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,190
Yeah.

1118
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,610
I can copy.

1119
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,590
Yeah.

1120
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,350
Loki...

1121
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:20,830
Hahaha!

1122
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,210
I don't know, but I'm doing a lot of damage for...

1123
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,370
Um...

1124
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,710
There you go, he's dead.

1125
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:28,870
20 player streak.

1126
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,390
I don't think I've died.

1127
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,590
Hahaha!

1128
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,570
Jeez, dude!

1129
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:33,530
Hahaha!

1130
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,310
This game is broken already!

1131
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,490
Fucking easy!

1132
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,670
Hahaha!

1133
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:44,650
Hahaha!

1134
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,110
Hahaha!

1135
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,110
Did you kill anybody?

1136
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,870
I only got 20 kills!

1137
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,630
Is there a leaderboard?

1138
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,090
I don't know.

1139
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,850
Oh wait, here, tab.

1140
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,370
I literally...

1141
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,690
Holy shit!

1142
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,730
Fucking map board!

1143
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:01,970
Oh my god!

1144
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,310
Bro!

1145
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,970
Okay, to be fair, I did a lot of damage for support though.

1146
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,910
I did more damage than the Ray guy.

1147
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,390
To be fair.

1148
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,570
You played against Toddlers.

1149
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,750
Hahaha!

1150
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,950
Oh my god!

1151
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,330
Fucking...

1152
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,150
Easy!

1153
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,390
Bro, there's like...

1154
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,370
Zero kills on the enemy team.

1155
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,550
23 assists!

1156
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,010
Hey look, I fucking healed a lot!

1157
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,730
Okay!

1158
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,610
Thank you Super Chat!

1159
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,970
Thank you!

1160
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,410
I really appreciate it!

1161
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,710
Look at us.

1162
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,470
I'm gonna endorse our MVP.

1163
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,110
And then I'm gonna endorse myself too.

1164
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,010
Can I endorse everybody?

1165
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,290
Wait, I can!

1166
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,010
Yeah, I can!

1167
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,530
Okay, one more round.

1168
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,630
Team is now queuing.

1169
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,850
Wait, can we queue together?

1170
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,650
Smash bounce.

1171
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,010
You made them uninstall!

1172
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,290
No, they were real people!

1173
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,030
I didn't queue up bots!

1174
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,810
I queued up against real people!

1175
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,110
Do we keep bullying kids yet again?

1176
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:17,210
I think that one of my biggest issues, like straight up, just from this, is the fact that the visual clutter is pretty bad.

1177
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,050
I would admit that the visual clutter is not great.

1178
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,210
Let's try...

1179
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,370
I wanna do like shooting.

1180
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,090
I wanna be able to shoot people.

1181
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,830
We'll try...

1182
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,070
Let's see...

1183
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,210
You know what?

1184
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,570
Let's try...

1185
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,310
No, I wanna play Hela!

1186
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,170
Okay, we got two tanks.

1187
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,870
I can do DPS.

1188
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,190
You know what?

1189
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,410
Namur has to be shooting, right?

1190
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,450
What is his abilities?

1191
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,330
Uh...

1192
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,750
Wait, fuck.

1193
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,830
Where is his...

1194
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,570
Oh, profile.

1195
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,710
No, I don't have F1!

1196
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,750
Okay, and then...

1197
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,650
Okay, and then...

1198
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:53,650
Alright.

1199
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,710
Okay, projectile.

1200
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,310
And then...

1201
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,290
What am I doing?

1202
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,050
Oh, shield?

1203
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,090
And then what's this?

1204
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,170
Oh!

1205
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,530
Go shoot for me, squid boy!

1206
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,370
Alright, we're attacking now.

1207
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,890
Aquaman, let's go!

1208
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,710
Aquaman, let's go!

1209
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,890
Oh my god, guys!

1210
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,610
It's Aquaman!

1211
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,430
Namur, Namur...

1212
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,150
Is that how you pronounce it?

1213
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,850
Oh my god!

1214
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,630
Alright, we'll send our squid boy out there.

1215
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,170
I can't believe Bruce...

1216
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,130
I can't believe...

1217
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,850
The Hulk is D.Va.

1218
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,210
The fanart's gonna go fucking crazy.

1219
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,830
It's gonna go fucking crazy, guys.

1220
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,190
Namur, sorry, Namur.

1221
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,630
Go, squid boy!

1222
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,510
I'm DPS.

1223
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,870
Oh my god!

1224
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,930
Bro, okay, look at my... Oh wait, king of the hill!

1225
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,830
It is king of the hill.

1226
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,870
Wait, these guys are coordinated.

1227
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,610
These guys are actually fucking coordinated.

1228
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,330
What the fuck?

1229
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,270
That's not fair.

1230
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,610
Guys, guys, okay.

1231
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,730
I think I am not meant to do projectile.

1232
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,190
Maybe.

1233
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,590
Maybe.

1234
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,830
Projectile might not be it.

1235
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,570
Okay, that's the decoy.

1236
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,350
Oh!

1237
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:14,790
Guys!

1238
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,990
I'm not good at projectile, guys!

1239
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,770
Can you tell?

1240
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,530
Guys, can you tell?

1241
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,990
I'm missing projectiles!

1242
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,870
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1243
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,170
Unless I can kill...

1244
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,150
No way!

1245
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,430
Groot is so strong!

1246
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,490
Oh god.

1247
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,170
No.

1248
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,450
Protect me, please.

1249
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:39,490
Okay.

1250
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,370
Okay, it's fine.

1251
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,450
It's fine.

1252
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,610
Oh, it's so... Okay.

1253
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,990
Guys, I need a swap.

1254
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,490
I can't do projectiles.

1255
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,250
I forgot about my weakness.

1256
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,770
To projectile.

1257
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,910
Yeah, Groot has maywows.

1258
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,750
This is not fair!

1259
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,870
Okay, we need a swap.

1260
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,910
Change.

1261
00:42:59,350 --> 00:42:59,870
Alright.

1262
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:00,930
It's alright.

1263
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,670
I know my place.

1264
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,290
It's okay.

1265
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,170
I know my place.

1266
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:08,770
I'm a tracker.

1267
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:08,790
I'm a tracker.

1268
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,990
I know what my aim is like.

1269
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,510
Holy shit!

1270
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,070
Oh my god!

1271
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,350
Oh my god!

1272
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,750
He just walks up to me!

1273
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,250
Holy shit!

1274
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,550
He just fucking walks up to me!

1275
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,230
I know your weakness.

1276
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,350
Oh my god!

1277
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:39,350
Okay.

1278
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,590
This is the way to go fast here.

1279
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,610
Holy shit!

1280
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,690
Okay, I need to know where the health packs are too.

1281
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:47,290
Okay.

1282
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:47,770
Guys.

1283
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,570
I don't... Guys, these guys are...

1284
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,190
At least we're not babies this time, you know?

1285
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,030
At least it's not like we're babies.

1286
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,050
At least it's not like we're babies.

1287
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,750
Guys, I feel like... Maybe I was meant to be a support.

1288
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,470
Guys, I feel like... Maybe I was meant to be a support.

1289
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,610
Because at least I'll actually get healed, you know?

1290
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,970
Fuck you, Groot.

1291
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,210
Down with my life!

1292
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,590
Down with nature!

1293
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,090
Down with nature!

1294
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,710
You can't block all of this!

1295
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,910
That's fucking right!

1296
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,350
That's fucking right!

1297
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,510
There we go.

1298
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:19,610
Nice.

1299
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,730
She's falling right in front of me!

1300
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,850
Alright, nice.

1301
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,010
Okay.

1302
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,830
We know my place though.

1303
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:30,410
I'll smoke.

1304
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,270
I'll smoke.

1305
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:31,950
Wait, what?

1306
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,210
Oh, shit.

1307
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:33,990
They're over here.

1308
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:36,910
Oh, no.

1309
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:37,510
Where are they coming?

1310
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,510
Oh, 39%.

1311
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,590
Don't make me bring out that tur...

1312
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:42,830
Oh!

1313
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:44,470

00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,850
Okay.

1318
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,590
Nice ult.

1319
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:50,990
Oh, my god!

1320
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,830
He fucking...

1321
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,550
Second life!

1322
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,250
Oh, shit!

1323
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,570
The double hogs!

1324
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:04,630
Bro, the Loki turned into another hog!

1325
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,470
Oh, my god!

1326
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,010
There's two!

1327
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,090
That's not fair!

1328
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,410
What do I do with two hogs?

1329
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,470
Okay, wait.

1330
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,610
Oh, no.

1331
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,570
This is bad.

1332
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,530
I'm like fucking in.

1333
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,010
Okay, maybe...

1334
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,970
It makes me wanna play support.

1335
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,590
Just cause like I'm fucking...

1336
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,350
Where is my healers?

1337
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,290
That was crazy unfair.

1338
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,530
Hogs strong.

1339
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,050
Guys.

1340
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,510
It like pisses me off cause it makes me wanna play healer.

1341
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,270
Because of the fact that like...

1342
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,010
My team didn't heal me.

1343
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,010
It makes me mad.

1344
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:53,870
Okay.

1345
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,230
Wait, it's cause we have one healer!

1346
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:57,530
Alright.

1347
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:58,490
It's okay.

1348
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,130
I know my place.

1349
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,690
I fucking know my place.

1350
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,190
Hahaha!

1351
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,430
Sorry.

1352
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,710
Now we have two healers.

1353
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,790
What is she doing?

1354
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,770
Why do you think we...

1355
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,910
I'm mad I didn't get healed.

1356
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,830
So now I have to heal.

1357
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,610
Back to healer life.

1358
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:23,790
Don't worry.

1359
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,350
I can turn into the hog this time.

1360
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,950
I'm gonna do what they did to me.

1361
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,190
To heal.

1362
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:30,830
Sad.

1363
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:32,510
Alright.

1364
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,030
I need to know where the health packs are too.

1365
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,310
Like...

1366
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,050
It's crazy that this is alpha.

1367
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,470
Because it already looks pretty good for alpha.

1368
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,650
But like obviously there's a lot of stuff they can improve.

1369
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,150
I'm gonna put that here.

1370
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,070
Oh my god.

1371
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:46,330
Please!

1372
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,530
Please start turning!

1373
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,170
Please!

1374
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,270
Please don't let him kill me!

1375
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:51,930
Oh nice.

1376
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,230
Okay.

1377
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:53,890
It's fine.

1378
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,310
It's fine.

1379
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:54,670
It's fine.

1380
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:56,070
What?

1381
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:56,550
What?

1382
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,690
Oh my god!

1383
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:59,750
Who killed me?

1384
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,170
Scarlet Witch?

1385
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,570
Oh my god!

1386
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,130
Oh my god!

1387
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:09,530
Okay.

1388
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,530
If I do this and then shift...

1389
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,290
Wait no.

1390
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,890

Wait actually no it is fair.

00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,330
I can kill... No it's not.

1397
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,230
It's actually not fair.

1398
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:25,590
It's actually not fair.

1399
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,610
Oh my god!

1400
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:29,590
I...

1401
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,470

1402
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,090

I fucked up a little bit.

1429
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,590
I'm being less of a healer.

1430
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,690
More of a DPS.

1431
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,050
Okay this one and then swap here.

1432
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,310

00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:38,810
Don't worry.

Somebody is critical.

1449
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,850
I don't know who that is.

1450
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,650
But I hope you're okay.

1451
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:06,890
Oh my god!

1452
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,150
Oh my god!

1453
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,910

1459
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,150
Oh there's Iron Man.

1460
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,450
He wants to kill me.

1461
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:21,670
Don't worry.

1462
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,130
I got him.

1463
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,530
Oh I should.

1464
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:24,150

1465
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:25,010
I'm sorry.

1466
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:25,710
I was distracted.

1467
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,530
They're too good.

1468
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,390
Give me back the children.

1469
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,230
Give me back the children.

00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,430

1485
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:03,790

1503
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:27,970
Fuck you.

1504
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,550
If you're gonna fly I'll fly too.

1505
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,170
Wait how do I?

1506
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,530
There you go.

1507
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,710
Get.

1508
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:36,230
Get perspective.

1509
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:36,610
No.

1510
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:40,660
Echo where you can still be.

1511
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,480
Oh my god.

1512
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,860
Look at that fly fight.

1513
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:45,640
Oh.

1514
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,460
Hela did it.

1515
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,520
She did it.

1516
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,360
Hela fucking revived me.

1517
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,040
Alright nice.

1518
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,700
I'll do here.

1519
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,060
Alright go doki.

1520
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,540
Go second doki.

1521
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,280
Okay we gotta get rid of the other doki too.

1522
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,420
Nice.

1523
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:00,780
Okay.

1524
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,140
Don't worry.

1525
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:01,440
No.

1526
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,300
Wait.

1527
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,240
I got her.

1528
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,140
Please Hela.

1529
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,620
Nice.

1530
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,500
Regen.

1531
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:06,940
Alright.

1532
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,900
Hela got me again.

1533
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,300
Thanks Hela.

1534
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,980
That's not even mom.

1535
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,940
She killed my mom.

1536
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,080
Wait okay.

1537
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,920
We're like actually working together.

1538
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:19,940
This time.

1539
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,680
We're actually.

1540
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,540
Is that crazy?

1541
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,900
We're actually working together this time.

1542
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,120
We're actually working together this time.

1543
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,460
Oh my god.

1544
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,920
This is actually crazy broken.

1545
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,780
The Hela team up is actually crazy broken though.

1546
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,680
Oh no.

1547
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,760
Bruce Banner going in.

1548
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,600
I'm gonna put this on regen for me.

1549
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,280
I'm gonna put this on regen for me.

1550
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,580
Please.

1551
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,040
Please team.

1552
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,740
Don't die team.

1553
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,300
Don't die.

1554
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,280
I'm keeping you all up.

1555
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,920
I'm keeping you all up.

1556
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,540
I'm keeping you all up.

1557
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,640
The support life.

1558
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,220
I'm gonna turn into you.

1559
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,140
That's fucking right.

1560
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,060
We did it.

1561
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,340
It's working.

1562
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,100
Okay we're okay.

1563
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,200
We're okay.

1564
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:14,600
Guys.

1565
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,080
I might become a lowkey one trick.

1566
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,260
I might become a lowkey one trick.

1567
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,380
What?

1568
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,100
lowkey seems to be the only character that works for me.

1569
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,140
I want a comeback.

1570
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,140
I want a comeback.

1571
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,040
The pre revise.

1572
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,080
Oh my god.

1573
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,400
Lowkey and dokey it just works.

1574
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,060
We beat a team that wasn't babies.

1575
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,580
We beat a team that wasn't babies.

1576
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,220
All that I'm saying is that...

1577
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,300
Lowkey seems to be.

1578
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,440
the easiest.

1579
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,900
...in terms of support.

1580
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,020
No!

1581
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,520
They cat nerfed Loki!

1582
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,540
Look at him!

1583
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,320
They cat nerfed him!

1584
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,920
Okie dokie, Loki.

1585
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,400
And then I swap.

1586
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,440
Woo!

1587
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,320
Look at that!

1588
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,300
It's like a Symmetra portal.

1589
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,700
I like that.

1590
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:08,740
Look at that!

1591
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,240
I'm inventing new tech now!

1592
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,400
New movement tech!

1593
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,560
Guys, I literally invented new movement tech.

1594
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,680
I need to remember how to use...

1595
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,500
...the swap, so...

1596
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,500
I think the one thing I need to know how to do is just swapping characters.

1597
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,000
Am I getting flanked?

1598
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,520
No, I'm not.

1599
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,820
I thought I was getting flanked.

1600
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,820
It seemed like I was getting flanked there.

1601
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,400
Don't worry, I got you.

1602
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,840
I got you!

1603
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,480
I got you!

1604
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,620
They're all up top.

1605
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,440
It's fine.

1606
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,440
It's fine.

1607
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,040
I can tank this.

1608
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,220
We're okay.

1609
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,080
Wait, did he like make a...

1610
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:50,480
No!

1611
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,240
No, Bruce!

1612
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,400
We can't have you!

1613
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,100
Go back to Bruce!

1614
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,460
You're too weak!

1615
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,840
Ok.

1616
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,420
Oh no.

1617
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,860
I need to be able to hit that.

1618
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,640
Two.

1619
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,700
Ok, that's fine.

1620
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,160
That's fine.

1621
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,140
Go, Bruce!

1622
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:04,460
Go!

1623
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:05,980
No, Bruce!

1624
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,260
No!

1625
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,020
We can't have you!

1626
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,000
Oh no.

1627
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,220
Oh no.

1628
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,120
Bruce is out of his mech form.

1629
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,220
That's bad!

1630
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,060
We can't have...

1631
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,540
Oh no.

1632
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,420
I don't like how like, you know, the environment's gone too.

1633
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,620
Don't worry, Scarlet!

1634
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,400
I got you!

1635
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:26,760
Oh no.

1636
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,620
Wait, no!

1637
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,680
They're capping!

1638
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,360
I didn't even realize they're capping!

1639
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,960
Oh no.

1640
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,440
It's ok.

1641
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,720
He's back.

1642
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,160
Somebody get her!

1643
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:36,900
Nice.

1644
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,100
I need to like remember where my HP is.

1645
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,700
Get in the mech, Bruce!

1646
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,120
Bruce, get in the mech!

1647
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,280
Nice.

1648
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:46,820
I got him.

1649
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,000
I like the projectile.

1650
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,640
I cannot do the projectile anymore.

1651
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,120
But like, Loki's projectile is easier.

1652
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:54,980
Oh.

1653
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,800
Goodbye.

1654
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,520
No!

1655
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,220
No!

1656
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,120
What?

1657
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,120
What is that damage?

1658
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,380
Ok, Scarlet Witch is actually busted.

1659
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,440
I did not think she would fucking just destroy me like that.

1660
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:12,960
What?

1661
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,800
It's literally one shot!

1662
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,180
That's actually crazy.

1663
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,300
It's ok.

1664
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:19,900
It's fine.

1665
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:20,760
Oh my god.

1666
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,540
Someone save the Hulk!

1667
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,140
Don't make him a fucking weak flesh bag!

1668
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,520
Ok.

1669
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,560
I'm moving.

1670
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,800
Don't worry.

1671
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,320
Here we go.

1672
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,440
Hulk time!

1673
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,500
It's Hulk time!

1674
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,100
Wait, where are they?

1675
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,700
It's Hulk time for real!

1676
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,180
Where are you?

1677
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,640
Where are you?

1678
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,940
Get over here!

1679
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,480
That's fucking right!

1680
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,420
I'm a bigger version of you!

1681
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,460
Please!

1682
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,540
Oh, I'm... ok.

1683
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,440
That ended very fast.

1684
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,360
He just walked past it.

1685
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,400
Yeah!

1686
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,280
We won!

1687
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,660
So many Hulks.

1688
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,340
Yeah!

1689
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,560
Ok, the first game was pretty rough.

1690
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,800
The first game was really rough.

1691
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,180
But we survived.

1692
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,160
We managed it.

1693
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:19,340
Ok.

1694
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,180
Our Hela was like really fucking good at the game though.

1695
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,960
She was actually pretty good.

1696
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,840
JK, I got 11k damage.

1697
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,640
What the fuck?

1698
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,440
What?

1699
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,820
I had 11k damage!

1700
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,900
Oh, I was not healing.

1701
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,220
I was absolutely not healing.

1702
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,000
I was literally not healing.

1703
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,680
I was literally not healing.

1704
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,920
I was literally not healing.

1705
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,700
Guys, look.

1706
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,260
Damage was more important in chat.

1707
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,220
You don't understand.

1708
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,480
Battle look.

1709
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,880
The mora moment.

1710
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,740
Oh my god.

1711
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,040
Alright.

1712
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,140
Again.

1713
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,680
Let's go.

1714
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,040
I will give him and I'll give myself.

1715
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,420
What's my highlight?

1716
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,320
Oh, I can't find.

1717
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,120
The accuracy.

1718
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,980
Support by killing the enemy.

1719
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,620
We will try Scarlet Witch.

1720
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,520
Her fucking chaos shit was so busted.

1721
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,460
Loki bird sweep.

1722
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,980
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

1723
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,360
Thank you.

1724
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:17,880
Thank you.

1725
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:19,860
Support.

1726
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,340
Yeah.

1727
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,780
Fire support.

1728
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,060
I want to be Scarlet Witch.

1729
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,540
I don't know what her abilities are, but she seems like really strong.

1730
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,960
She seems really strong.

1731
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,020
Oh, and she's like a 1 star too.

1732
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,120
She's like literally 1 star.

1733
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,820
I really like the aesthetic of the game.

1734
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,840
Penny Parker?

1735
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,700
But she's a tank.

1736
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,540
It doesn't matter.

1737
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,480
I don't want to play tank.

1738
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,200
Tank is terrible.

1739
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,400
I see no tank, but we don't need tanks.

1740
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,620
No more mutants.

1741
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:58,320
We said no more mutants and no liberated everyone.

1742
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,900
It looks really good.

1743
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,180
The fact that tank has a maywall is like so scary.

1744
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,320
Okay, what is this?

1745
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,260
Okay, this is like attack.

1746
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,540
This is...

1747
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,140
Oh, this is like a mora beam, I assume.

1748
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,120
And is this shift?

1749
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,560
And then what is... this is the portal, right?

1750
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,380
Wait, what is this?

1751
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,300
What is the E?

1752
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,100
I assume... yeah, left click is the mora...

1753
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,780
Like mora suck.

1754
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,080
I'm pretty sure.

1755
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,460
And then... guys, we have zero tanks, guys.

1756
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,880
But we don't need that.

1757
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,540
Wait, how did they get up there?

1758
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:35,800
Alright.

1759
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,200
I don't know what the...

1760
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,180
It's okay.

1761
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,420
We're fine.

1762
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,060
Guys, we're fine.

1763
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,020
They can heal us.

1764
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,680
Okay, wait, okay.

1765
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,900
And then...

1766
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,560
No, we have a tank!

1767
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,460
Okay, what is E?

1768
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,860
Oh, it's like a mine!

1769
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,660
Oh my god, Doctor Strange has like the Rhyme Shield!

1770
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,480
Guys, get closer to me so I can suck.

1771
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,880
Guys, I need you to get closer to me.

1772
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,700
For the suck.

1773
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,380
Guys... wait, what?

1774
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,200
There.

1775
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:08,900
Suck.

1776
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,800
Get over there.

1777
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:14,900
Okay.

1778
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,260
Oh, this is confusing.

1779
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,440
Because I have limited ammo for the left-right click.

1780
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,860
So I have... oh!

1781
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,280
I need heals.

1782
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,320
I need heals.

1783
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,940
Please, I need heals.

1784
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,440
Guys, I need heals.

1785
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,300
Please.

1786
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,720
I can't suck that far.

1787
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,180
No, I tank!

1788
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,620
I one tank!

1789
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,440
Oh, god.

1790
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:37,780
Goodbye.

1791
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,220
Oh, goodbye.

1792
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:41,620
Guys, this is bad.

1793
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,400
I've limited ammo when it comes to close range.

1794
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,940
How do they do this?

1795
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,140
No!

1796
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,420
Where were you?

1797
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:51,600
Okay.

1798
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,520
No, fuck.

1799
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,820
I think like...

1800
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,660
I think like Scarlet Witch...

1801
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,180
Not as good as I thought.

1802
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,980
She's only good at close range.

1803
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:01,580
I noticed.

1804
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,320
Wait, I can fly!

1805
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,740
Wait, I can fly?

1806
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,760
Oh, wait, no.

1807
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,720
I can... I can glide?

1808
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,140
No, I can glide.

1809
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:09,600
Okay.

1810
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,460
I can glide.

1811
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:10,900
Okay.

1812
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,440
I can glide, guys.

1813
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,420
Oh, yeah.

1814
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,000
Starlord seems like Tracer.

1815
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,260
Yeah.

1816
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,440
Okay.

1817
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,120
How far does this go?

1818
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:21,900
Alright.

1819
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,420
I just need to know how far that goes.

1820
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,440
What is my range for this?

1821
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,040
Oh, my god.

1822
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,620
I don't know my range for this.

1823
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:30,700
Alright.

1824
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,640
She can hold space to glide.

1825
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,700
Yeah, I think it's like glide.

1826
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,920
Yeah, I can do that.

1827
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,440
Or... wait.

1828
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,940
My chaos is strong though.

1829
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,180
Chaos time!

1830
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:43,820
Okay.

1831
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,400
Oh!

1832
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,600
Did I kill anybody?

1833
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,600
I can't tell!

1834
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,240
Oh, and then...

1835
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:49,900
That's right.

1836
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:50,400
Suck.

1837
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,040
It's not fair!

1838
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,040
He's getting healed!

1839
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,580
What the fuck?

1840
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,960
Get closer to me!

1841
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,720
Get closer to me!

1842
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,520
No, okay.

1843
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:03,820
Nevermind.

1844
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,860
I hate Scarlet.

1845
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,840
Scarlet's only good with her ult.

1846
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:08,520
Not gonna lie.

1847
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,000
I've noticed it.

1848
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,940
Scarlet's only good with her ult.

1849
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,640
Because the others are like...

1850
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,260
Guys, please.

1851
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,340
I need healing.

1852
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:17,900
I need healing.

1853
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,600
Please.

1854
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,560
I need healing.

1855
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,800
Where's my... Loki, please!

1856
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,780
I need healing!

1857
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,220
Loki!

1858
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,520
Loki!

1859
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,080
There's a squid in front of me!

1860
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:31,640
I'm scared!

1861
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,720
Okay, I'm healing.

1862
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,140
That's nice.

1863
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,720
Alright, that's good.

1864
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,240
I'm healing now.

1865
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,020
I'm healing now.

1866
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:39,360
Get closer!

1867
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,520
I can't get closer!

1868
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,760
Because there's like...

1869
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,280
200 enemies in front of me!

1870
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:45,820
Guys!

1871
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,880
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

1872
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,960
Okay, I'm safe.

1873
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,460
Guys, I can't just fucking get closer, guys.

1874
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:59,000
There's literally three people in front of me.

1875
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:00,260
Look.

1876
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,800
Oh god.

1877
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:02,360
Oh!

1878
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,720
No!

1879
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,460
Okay, I'm gonna try Hela.

1880
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,460
I think Hela might be it.

1881
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,540
Okay, taste of her own Loki.

1882
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,800
I think she's like a flanker.

1883
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,000
She seems like a flanker.

1884
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:15,460
Okay.

1885
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,040
Hela does this.

1886
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,320
And then...

1887
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:19,920
She has that.

1888
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,160
And then... Oh, she teleports.

1889
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,000
Okay, what's this?

1890
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,240
I don't know what the E does though.

1891
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,800
Oh no, they made it.

1892
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,000
What does the E does?

1893
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,100
Can't tell.

1894
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,760
Oh no.

1895
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,140
That's fine.

1896
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,520
That's fine.

1897
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,260
They only have 60 seconds to get there.

1898
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,900
You don't see me up here.

1899
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,920
God, there's so many squids!

1900
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,500
Why is there so many squids?

1901
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,580
Okay, we got... fuck.

1902
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,520
No, no, Loki!

1903
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,200
What is the E?

1904
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,020
Loki, please help me!

1905
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,280
I may return from my own realm.

1906
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,640
Okay, I don't know what the E does.

1907
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,040
Alright, but I can teleport though.

1908
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,440
It will say nice corner.

1909
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,940
Oh, controlling the bird.

1910
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,920
Controlling the bird is so difficult.

1911
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:14,840
Controlling the bird is so difficult.

1912
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,120
Okay, I have another.

1913
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,460
I can fly soon.

1914
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:18,840
Alright.

1915
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,120
I need like a straight line to fly.

1916
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,340
I need a straight line.

1917
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:29,920
Guys, the more I play other characters, the more I realize I might be alone.

1918
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:30,660
I'm just gonna play Loki one trick.

1919
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,440
Oh, shit!

1920
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,820
Oh my god!

1921
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,280
Nice, I got him.

1922
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:39,520
Loki, please!

1923
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,180
Loki, I killed your mom, but please heal me.

1924
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:43,840
Okay.

1925
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:45,640
Nice.

1926
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,400
Oh, I do so much damage though.

1927
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,160
Holy shit.

1928
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:53,580
Okay, not gonna lie, I actually do so much damage if I hit these headshots.

1929
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,820
Okay, I do!

1930
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,120
Shit!

1931
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,340
Holy fuck, that was an accident.

1932
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,960
Holy fuck, that was an accident.

1933
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,160
If I hit headshots, I actually can kill so many people.

1934
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,800
What is hella mode?

1935
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,420
Is this hella mode?

1936
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,300
Guys, I fucked up with my hella mode, but... Oh wait, no, I didn't!

1937
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,880
Oh, they're so fucking dead.

1938
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,980
That damage is actually insane.

1939
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,160
Maybe I'll be an Asgardian.

1940
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,100
Asgardian... uh...

1941
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,980
Asgardian, uh...

1942
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,440
player.

1943
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,060
I just play all the Asgardians.

1944
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,340
Asgardians only, please.

1945
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,120
Asgardians only, please.

1946
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,700
I can't play any other character but Asgardians.

1947
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,180
Alright.

1948
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,220
I still don't know what E does.

1949
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,800
Oh, I think it's like...

1950
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,620
No!

1951
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,940
No, no, no, no, no!

1952
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1953
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:01,300
I keep accidentally burning into the team!

1954
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,640
No!

1955
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:04,940
No!

1956
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,280
It was an accident!

1957
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,200
Or Norse...

1958
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,400
Norse god main.

1959
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,400
I'll be Norse main only.

1960
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:14,040
No!

1961
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,020
I accidentally burned into them!

1962
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,700
Oh my god!

1963
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,800
Jesus Christ!

1964
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,400
The damage is actually insane.

1965
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,480
Like, as long as I...

1966
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,680
Wait, who's that?

1967
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,260
I feel like as long as I...

1968
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,060
As long as I hit headshots, it's actually crazy the things I can do.

1969
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,560
The things I can do?

1970
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,300
Get away from me!

1971
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,040
I don't think Thor is in the game yet.

1972
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,020
I think he's like...

1973
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,440
He might be going in...

1974
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,000
Maybe like in later on.

1975
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,080
Because I know they're releasing more heroes later.

1976
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,820
Like, please.

1977
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,420
Why is it so hard to teleport?

1978
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,780
God damn it.

1979
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,060
I'm so scared.

1980
01:05:59,280 --> 01:05:59,740
There you go.

1981
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,840
Predicting this is hard.

1982
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,300
No!

1983
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,040
They made it!

1984
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,200
But I got two though!

1985
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:08,680
Loki, please.

1986
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,220
No!

1987
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:11,500
Did they make it?

1988
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,120
Did they made it?

1989
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,020
No, I think they did it.

1990
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:14,740
Okay.

1991
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:15,680
We're good.

1992
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,700
This is not fair!

1993
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,940
Okay, I'm trying to help my...

1994
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,040
I'm trying my best to help!

1995
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,960
I'm going in the corner!

1996
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:24,380
Oh!

1997
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,540
Oh, I did not... Okay guys, it's okay.

1998
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,520
We have one last point left.

1999
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,900
No, please!

2000
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,640
Not my winstreaks!

2001
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,640
Not my winstreaks, guys!

2002
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,080
Not my winstreaks, guys!

2003
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,040
Look, I'm doing a lot!

2004
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,280
I got 12 kills!

2005
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,940
I'm like literally on fire!

2006
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:44,640
Alright.

2007
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:46,520
This way.

2008
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:48,700
Alright.

2009
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:53,160
Guys, I'm not Loki!

2010
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,040
I'm Hela!

2011
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,720
Because I'm Hela dope.

2012
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,920
Alright, let's see.

2013
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,480
Maybe I should try punishing.

2014
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,480
They're all flying!

2015
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,920
This is actually like so cheesy.

2016
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,080
Don't make me go Hela on you!

2017
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,260
Bam!

2018
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:12,900
Bam!

2019
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,360
Okay, they're shielding everything.

2020
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,240
Alright.

2021
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,100
That's right!

2022
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:18,020
You can't shield this!

2023
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,140
You can't shield this!

2024
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:21,740
Alright.

2025
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,580
That was like pretty useless.

2026
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,020
I'm going to try to kill this.

2027
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,980
But like I did the best I could.

2028
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,680
The storm...

2029
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,220
The storm seems like really broken when she's in the air.

2030
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:30,900
Not gonna lie.

2031
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,580
Only because like...

2032
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,700
It seems like really difficult.

2033
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:36,760
Please.

2034
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,680
Guys, I need help!

2035
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,220
Tanks, tanks, tanks, tanks!

2036
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:40,720
Tanks!

2037
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,400
Tanks, please!

2038
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,220
Use your ult!

2039
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,140
No!

2040
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,000
I'm getting hot ground!

2041
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,560
I'm getting hot ground!

2042
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,800
I'm flanking, I'm flanking, I'm flanking!

2043
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:52,380
They won't know!

2044
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,960
What are they doing?

2045
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:56,860
They knew guys!

2046
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,160
No!

2047
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,220
They turned around!

2048
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,020
They turned around!

2049
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,460
It's okay.

2050
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,340
It's okay guys.

2051
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,740
My trump card!

2052
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,400
Tracking!

2053
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,100
There's no way!

2054
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:11,380
No!

2055
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,840
What are we losing?

2056
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,760
We lost our healer!

2057
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,400
It's okay.

2058
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:15,880
I have my...

2059
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,460
My tracking will save us guys!

2060
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:22,820
It's okay!

2061
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:25,900
Oh god!

2062
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,820
It might not be okay!

2063
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,800
Leave me alone!

2064
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:35,500
Alright.

2065
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,660
If we lose, it's not me guys.

2066
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,360
Oh no!

2067
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:42,960
Guys.

2068
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,500
I don't know.

2069
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,240
I think...

2070
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,980
It's becoming more and more clear.

2071
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,460
I'm meant to play Loki.

2072
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,210
I'm meant to play Loki.

2073
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:58,570
Oh my god.

2074
01:08:58,570 --> 01:08:59,150
It wasn't me!

2075
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,450
It was my team!

2076
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,950
Oh my god!

2077
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,630
It was my team!

2078
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:06,670
Look at this!

2079
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,450
I knew it was my team!

2080
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,010
Look at the damage!

2081
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:14,430
I took like...

2082
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:14,990
Okay.

2083
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:18,850
Fucking Doctor Strange took 27,000.

2084
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:19,210
Okay.

2085
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:21,190
Doctor Strange is actually a really good tank.

2086
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:21,750
Not gonna...

2087
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,870
Not him as a player.

2088
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:25,630
Not him as a player.

2089
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:26,750
But like...

2090
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:32,110
I think Doctor Strange seems really OP as a tank.

2091
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:33,490
Because of the shield.

2092
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,530
The shield can block so many things.

2093
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:37,970
What?

2094
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,330
The 1.6k...

2095
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:41,050
I knew it!

2096
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,190
This is why people become healers!

2097
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,870
Because I have dog shit healers!

2098
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:49,150
So the only way to live is to be a healer yourself!

2099
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,590
Alright.

2100
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:51,550
I wanna try Storm.

2101
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:53,910
Because I got shit on by too many Storm players.

2102
01:09:56,710 --> 01:10:00,670
I got shit on too many times by Storm.

2103
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:03,190
I got shit on too many times by Storm.

2104
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:03,270
I got shit on too many times by Storm.

2105
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,210
Alright.

2106
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:04,850
Let's see.

2107
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:05,950
Oh wait.

2108
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:06,610
I can look at here.

2109
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:09,370
Windblow, Transforming Hurricane, Switch the Weather.

2110
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:09,970
Oh yeah!

2111
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,910
This is the Weather Swap!

2112
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:12,770
Switch the Weather for Damage Boost.

2113
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:14,830
Channel the Power Weather to Empower Storm.

2114
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:15,490
Okay.

2115
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,150
Unleash a Lighting Bullet forward.

2116
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:19,630
Okay.

2117
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:21,290
This is gonna be a little...

2118
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:22,890
Yeah.

2119
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:24,010
DPS Lucio time.

2120
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:27,350
Okay.

2121
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:28,730
This is...

2122
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:29,990
Is this Damage Boost?

2123
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,690
I assume this is Movement because it's the Wind.

2124
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:34,910
And then this is Damage.

2125
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:37,610
And then Double Damage.

2126
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:37,890
Let's go!

2127
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:41,850
Now...

2128
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:42,050
Okay.

2129
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,750
We should be on Speed for now.

2130
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,450
So we can all get there in time.

2131
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,110
So we can all get there in time.

2132
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:47,230
Alright.

2133
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,630
I swear!

2134
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:51,470
I think the Flying is so broken!

2135
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:51,910
Because like...

2136
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,490
Because like bad players can't shoot people in the air.

2137
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:55,570
I think.

2138
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:57,430
I think like bad...

2139
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:59,030
You know it's true!

2140
01:10:59,150 --> 01:10:59,970
Look at all the fair players!

2141
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,030
Bad players can't shoot people in the air.

2142
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,630
So like... I think that's OP.

2143
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,650
You know it's true!

2144
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:15,730
Alright.

2145
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,230
Let's get rid of this shield.

2146
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:18,790
What the fuck?

2147
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:20,630
Okay.

2148
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:21,470
Let's see.

2149
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:23,510
We'll do Damage Boost because we have...

2150
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:24,030
Alright.

2151
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:27,910
Apparently I can't even shoot people while I'm in the air.

2152
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:34,470
I can't even...

2153
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:35,050
Okay.

2154
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:36,550
This is like an issue though.

2155
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:43,350
The issue is that it's very hard to shoot people when you're flying.

2156
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:48,390
The projectile is actually pretty difficult.

2157
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,770
Not that I'm a pro.

2158
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:49,110
I'm just joking a lot.

2159
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:49,890
Wait.

2160
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:50,350
Break his shield!

2161
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:50,850
Break his shield!

2162
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:53,450
Oh!

2163
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:56,570
Holy fuck!

2164
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:57,810
Okay.

2165
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,750
Were you gonna do magic?

2166
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:03,450
Oh no.

2167
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:04,090
Oh no.

2168
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:04,750
Not the turret.

2169
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:05,330
Oh!

2170
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:05,970
Okay.

2171
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:06,450
There you go.

2172
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:08,770
Okay.

2173
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:10,390
Okay.

2174
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:11,190
There's a ranged...

2175
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:11,530
No!

2176
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:13,030
Where are my healers?

2177
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,850
Do we have healers?

2178
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,710
We don't have a healer!

2179
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:17,630
Hahaha!

2180
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:19,290
Okay.

2181
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:23,010
Guys, it's not because I wanna play Loki.

2182
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:25,170
We literally have zero healers.

2183
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:26,850
Hahaha!

2184
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:30,870
I was like, Where the fuck are our healers?

2185
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:32,930
Oh my god!

2186
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,030
Guys, it's not a fucking...

2187
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,030
Do you think I wanna play Loki?

2188
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,390
Look, I had to.

2189
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,490
We literally had zero healers.

2190
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:44,510
We have three tanks.

2191
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,110
Like, what is this bullshit?

2192
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:50,390
We actually had three tanks.

2193
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:52,770
Bruce, please.

2194
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:53,510
Bruce.

2195
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:55,410
Oh my god!

2196
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:57,770
Okay.

2197
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,030
This is bad.

2198
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,090
Oh, wait.

2199
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,330
No.

2200
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:03,570
Oh no, please!

2201
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:07,490
Hahaha!

2202
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:11,350
No one's healing to cease the change in DPS.

2203
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:15,130
I'm pretty sure Loki has to be the meta when it comes to healers.

2204
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:19,970
Cause like, I feel like Loki does like a lot.

2205
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,290
Has like really good utility.

2206
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:24,650
Maybe Loki and Rocket Raccoon, I think.

2207
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,290
I think Loki and Rocket Raccoon.

2208
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:31,230
I don't know what this does, but...

2209
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:31,950
Oh shit!

2210
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:33,010
Oh, I'm sorry!

2211
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,030
Oh shit!

2212
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:34,650
Okay, don't worry.

2213
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:35,610
I have like so much HP.

2214
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:36,850
Wait, I'm fucking tanked.

2215
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,890
Don't worry.

2216
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:39,310
Do you know what we needed?

2217
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:40,690
A four fucking tanks.

2218
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:41,510
Hahaha!

2219
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:45,670
That's what we fucking needed.

2220
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:46,730
That's what we fucking needed.

2221
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:46,810
Oh!

2222
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:48,330
Nope!

2223
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,630
Nope!

2224
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:51,550
That's fine.

2225
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,210
Please guys!

2226
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:57,130
I'm literally doing so much healing!

2227
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:58,370
Team!

2228
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:00,990
Guys, it's okay.

2229
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:03,410
It's not as bad as getting spawned camped earlier.

2230
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:06,090
Oh, yeah we do!

2231
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:07,190
Guys?

2232
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:09,350
Guys, please?

2233
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,050
I can like just shoot people from up here.

2234
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:13,090
Hahaha!

2235
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:15,850
Hahaha!

2236
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:17,830
Let me...

2237
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:18,450
Hahaha!

2238
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:20,630
Wait, that works!

2239
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:21,250
Nice!

2240
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,230
Alright.

2241
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:23,910
I found it!

2242
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:27,170
Uh, I found a nice spot to just chill in.

2243
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:28,630
Nice.

2244
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:29,590
We're fine!

2245
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:29,950
See?

2246
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,030
Everything is fine.

2247
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,490
What the fuck are you doing, Punisher?

2248
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,630
What are you doing over there?

2249
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:36,910
Just like what Ana did.

2250
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:38,970
That's incredible tech!

2251
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,350
I told you guys!

2252
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:42,470
I'm fucking... I'm tech...

2253
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,870
Hahaha!

2254
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:46,970
I'm literally tech crafting right now!

2255
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:49,170
Oh, bro.

2256
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:50,250
Bruce is fucking dead.

2257
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:51,450
Fucking... Hahaha!

2258
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,510
He's so fucking dead.

2259
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:56,850
Oh, goodbye!

2260
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:59,250
Goodbye, guys.

2261
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:00,870
Don't worry, we capped, right?

2262
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,590
Yeah, we capped.

2263
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:03,290
Don't worry, I got you guys.

2264
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:04,950
I got you guys.

2265
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:07,270
I'm actually healing for once in my life.

2266
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:08,450
Okay.

2267
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:13,150
I feel like Spider-Man seems really difficult to actually learn in general.

2268
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:16,030
Because like uh, of all the shit.

2269
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,430
Don't worry.

2270
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:21,470
By the eye of whatever the fuck that was!

2271
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:23,390
Okay.

2272
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:24,490
Don't worry.

2273
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:25,870
I got you guys.

2274
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,530
I'm also tanking for you guys.

2275
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:29,870
Now we have zero healers.

2276
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:30,870
But that's okay.

2277
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:33,410
Oh, shit!

2278
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:33,690
No!

2279
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:35,450
It's not okay!

2280
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,150
It's not okay!

2281
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,750
It's not okay!

2282
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:39,750
It's okay.

2283
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:41,130
My team's got this.

2284
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,050
They don't need a healer.

2285
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:44,370
They don't need a healer, guys.

2286
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:45,690
Okay, let's see.

2287
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,530
Time to do the tech.

2288
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:49,610
Nice.

2289
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:50,730
Alright.

2290
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:52,570
Guys, I'm here.

2291
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:54,750
Don't worry.

2292
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:57,210
Your DPS healer is here.

2293
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:59,270
Healer down.

2294
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:01,390
I'm the only healer.

2295
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:04,230
Please.

2296
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:04,790
Guys!

2297
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:08,030
We can't have all tanks, guys!

2298
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:09,130
Please!

2299
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:10,290
I beg of you!

2300
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:14,790
We need...

2301
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:15,670
We need...

2302
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:16,910
We can't have all tanks!

2303
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:22,270
I can barely heal all these tanks!

2304
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:25,610
I can barely heal all these tanks!

2305
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:26,810
Oh, guys!

2306
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:28,770
Your fucking support's dead!

2307
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,370
Your fucking support's dead!

2308
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:33,190
Force to tank.

2309
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,690
Guys, please!

2310
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:35,210
Guys, please!

2311
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:38,190
I don't wanna go back to goats, guys!

2312
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:39,330
I don't wanna go back to goats, guys!

2313
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:42,270
If we're doing goats, we need more support!

2314
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:43,770
If we're doing goats, we need more support!

2315
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:44,670
Okay.

2316
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:46,270
Can I hold on to that?

2317
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:47,090
No, I can't.

2318
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,990
Oh, Scarlet.

2319
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,630
Oh, God.

2320
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:52,190
Please!

2321
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:54,230
Oh!

2322
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,030
Too many!

2323
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:58,290
Too many!

2324
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:02,770
I can't keep healing all of you!

2325
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:05,430
I can't keep healing all of you!

2326
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,150
No!

2327
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,950
Please!

2328
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,470
Please be gentle!

2329
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:11,870
Okay.

2330
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:14,130
Wait, I'm gonna Q.

2331
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:16,110
Oh, yeah?

2332
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:18,790
Oh, I'm fucking 1 HP.

2333
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:19,150
God!

2334
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:22,970
I'm 1 HP!

2335
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:25,190
Oh!

2336
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:28,390
Oh!

2337
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,430
Don't Q the real healer!

2338
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:32,970
No!

2339
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:34,370
Guys, stop!

2340
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,710
You're all critical!

2341
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:36,610
I'm trying!

2342
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,190
Guys!

2343
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:41,390
I'm trying!

2344
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:43,590
You're all critical!

2345
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,270
Oh, God.

2346
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:49,210
Guys, I'm trying!

2347
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:51,210
You get a weapon!

2348
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:54,130
Oh, my God.

2349
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,470
This is so stressful.

2350
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,730
This is actually so stressful.

2351
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:00,590
Just kill it.

2352
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,630
It's okay.

2353
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:02,190
We made it.

2354
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,090
We made it to the other side.

2355
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:07,570
We made it to the other side.

2356
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:08,490
We have 2 shields.

2357
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:10,110
We have...

2358
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,370
Where are my healers?

2359
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,230
You're 1 healer?

2360
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,670
Because we went 3 fucking tanks?

2361
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:18,950
Oh...

2362
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:20,750
Yep, it truly was.

2363
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:21,410
No!

2364
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:22,810
Please leave me alone!

2365
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:24,630
Oh, she doesn't know!

2366
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:25,330
Oh, my God.

2367
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:26,690
Penny Parker, you fucking idiot!

2368
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,250
Oh, that's me.

2369
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:30,950
Okay.

2370
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:31,950
There you go.

2371
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:35,830
We can just kill Hela on the...

2372
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:36,350
Wait.

2373
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:36,950
No!

2374
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,370
She's better!

2375
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,890
She's just better!

2376
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:49,110
Oh, my God.

2377
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:50,670
She's just...

2378
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:51,850
You know what I don't like though?

2379
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:53,570
I don't like how I can't crouch spam.

2380
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:55,050
That's why I don't...

2381
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:55,390
What?

2382
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:56,210
Okay.

2383
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:59,130
That's like walling, basically.

2384
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:01,970
I think...

2385
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:09,210
The fact that I can't crouch spam and like crouch jiggle to make it like harder to hit.

2386
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:13,010
Like I can AD, but I wish I could crouch spam.

2387
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,630
That's fucking right!

2388
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:16,190
May the eye of Agumato!

2389
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,070
May the eye of Agumato!

2390
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:18,670
May the eye of Agumato!

2391
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,330
I don't know if I've said that correctly.

2392
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:21,590
Guys, we don't have a healer anymore.

2393
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:24,550
We don't have a healer anymore.

2394
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:24,950
I'm sorry.

2395
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:28,590
I got a little selfish.

2396
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:30,050
I'm sorry, guys.

2397
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:35,870
At this point, I might as well just fucking like...

2398
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,730
teleport into a...

2399
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,590
What the fuck are you doing?

2400
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,970
Lowkey's DPS is actually really like insane.

2401
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:45,990
Not gonna lie.

2402
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,850
Guys, why did you build that wall?

2403
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:54,330
Why did you build that wall, guys?

2404
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,670
I can't go through.

2405
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,750
Alright, we're good.

2406
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:00,850
We're not good.

2407
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:04,610
I think like his DPS is actually really like...

2408
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:06,510
actually really powerful.

2409
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:07,590
When I hit those.

2410
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:08,450
If I hit those.

2411
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:14,110
Against the squishies, it feels like the DPS is actually crazy for Lowkey.

2412
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:15,910
Alright, nice.

2413
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:17,730
Okay.

2414
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:18,670
Go over there.

2415
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:19,910
Go over there, Lowkey.

2416
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,250
Just heal from up there.

2417
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:23,710
Please!

2418
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:24,550
No, don't die!

2419
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:25,210
Please, no!

2420
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,070
Magneto!

2421
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,130
Hulk out!

2422
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:29,910
Go Hulk!

2423
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:32,150
Okay.

2424
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:33,490
Hulk, just get there!

2425
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:34,610
Just fucking run at her!

2426
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:36,610
Oh, no!

2427
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:38,710
No!

2428
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,410
No!

2429
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,190
We did it!

2430
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:48,210
Oh my god.

2431
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:49,810
We fucking did it.

2432
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:53,590
Please, just let me play a different character.

2433
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,330
Oh my god.

2434
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:00,750
Please.

2435
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,290
All I want is the only healer.

2436
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:09,610
It's not fair.

2437
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:12,850
I just wanted the fucking DPS.

2438
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,710
You should use the aura and fight with your clones.

2439
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,250
It turns damage into healing.

2440
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:18,210
Oh, that's so cool.

2441
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:18,910
Oh, I didn't know that.

2442
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:22,630
Okay, I'm pretty sure they have to nerf Lowkey.

2443
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:24,370
I feel like Lowkey...

2444
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:24,850
Oh my god.

2445
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,070
Guys, look at the endorsements!

2446
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:27,590
They know!

2447
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,470
They're like, thank you for going healer!

2448
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:31,710
Oh my god!

2449
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:33,650
I got appreciation.

2450
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:35,250
They know!

2451
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:46,930
They gave me all the endorsements because I was the only one that was willing to suck up my ego to play fucking healer.

2452
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:48,550
I wanna play Star-Lord.

2453
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,370
Okay, Star-Lord.

2454
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:53,650
Engage in a free flight and lock onto enemies in sight.

2455
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:55,070
Boost and sword forward.

2456
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,410
Five frenzy of shots causing damage.

2457
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:00,550
Dodge and the direction of movement and swiftly reload.

2458
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:02,210
Ooh, wait, this is like Tracer.

2459
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,200
The comments... What are the other supports?

2460
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:13,000
It's like Rocket, Raccoon, Mantis, and Lunar Snow.

2461
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:15,160
I don't like the other support.

2462
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,460
I think... Okay.

2463
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,880
This is the... How many do we have?

2464
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,380
Okay, we have two.

2465
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:22,840
Okay.

2466
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:23,780
We have two.

2467
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:24,940
And then...

2468
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,240
And then we have that.

2469
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,800
And then we have the glide.

2470
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,940
Oh, I can fly with this.

2471
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:33,320
Okay.

2472
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,860
Alright, that's interesting.

2473
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,900
I wanna be Star-Lord.

2474
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,020
I'm already Star-Lord.

2475
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,920
I wanna be Star-Lord.

2476
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,240
Alright.

2477
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,040
We're fine.

2478
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,840
I think like Storm...

2479
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,360
Storm is like...

2480
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,180
I'm not a projectile person.

2481
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,640
Like that's the only issue.

2482
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,560
I'm so bad at projectile.

2483
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,600
Oh my god.

2484
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,160
I'm so fast.

2485
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,280
Here we go.

2486
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,160
Alright, I think I have to play Flanker for this.

2487
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,120
I'm pretty sure.

2488
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:09,500
I think Star-Lord is a Flanker.

2489
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,720
I don't know the map, so I don't know how I'm Flanking.

2490
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,440
The only issue is I gotta figure out the map.

2491
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:18,600
Alright.

2492
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,020
Let's see.

2493
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:21,680
How do I...

2494
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,420
Oh my god.

2495
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,300
I like Pepper damage.

2496
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:25,220
Wow!

2497
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,140
Wow!

2498
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:29,600
Okay.

2499
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:30,040
Nice.

2500
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:32,900
Oh my god.

2501
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:34,200
I fucking... I am...

2502
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:34,620
Please.

2503
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:35,420
No!

2504
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:36,120
Oh god.

2505
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:36,420
Oh god.

2506
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:36,740
Oh god.

2507
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,140
Oh god.

2508
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:37,660
Yes!

2509
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:38,320
Please.

2510
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:39,640
Okay.

2511
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,880
I think like as Star-Lord, you have to know like all the health facts just like Tracer.

2512
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,100
Oh my gosh.

2513
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,300
Damage is so tiny.

2514
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:48,300
Bro!

2515
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,180
I might as well fucking... Wow!

2516
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:51,900
Okay.

2517
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:53,680
Okay.

2518
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,180
I gotta...

2519
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,100
I gotta fly.

2520
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,560
I gotta fly.

2521
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,280
Okay.

2522
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,340
Oh my god.

2523
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,700
Move out!

2524
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,060
Shit!

2525
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:00,960
Okay.

2526
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:01,760
Not gonna lie though.

2527
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,640
That movement...

2528
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:05,860
Okay.

2529
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,280
I might be dead, but like that movement though...

2530
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:14,880
Okay.

2531
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,660
But that movement though...

2532
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,840
That movement... Okay.

2533
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,080
I need to get closer.

2534
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,320
Alright.

2535
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,040
I think they got it.

2536
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,480
Bro is moving with no damage.

2537
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,140
I think he had to be like... I think it is like Tracer.

2538
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,820
We had to be like super fucking close to do any damage.

2539
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:33,720
Yeah.

2540
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,980
Cause like look at how little like bullet...

2541
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:40,000
Like she doesn't have like...

2542
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,500
That's Rocky Raccoon.

2543
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,040
What the fuck?

2544
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,280
Is that like...

2545
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:44,620
Oh!

2546
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:45,380
Wait!

2547
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,500
That's like the portal!

2548
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,120
Oh my god.

2549
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,300
We're gonna play with portals.

2550
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:51,380
Yeah.

2551
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,120
Cause like look at the damage I can do with...

2552
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,320
Oh!

2553
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:55,840
Woah!

2554
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:56,100
Woah!

2555
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:56,240
Woah!

2556
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:56,340
Woah!

2557
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,120
I need healing!

2558
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:57,720
I need healing!

2559
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,980
I need healing!

2560
01:24:59,160 --> 01:24:59,480
No!

2561
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,640
I didn't realize you fucking raised me!

2562
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,420
No!

2563
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,560
Guys, I need to figure out how to spam.

2564
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:13,260
I need healing.

2565
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,060
Guys, this is like the one thing I need to know.

2566

Okay.

2567
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,260
I need healing.

2568
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:19,060
Okay.

2569
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,720
Guys, this is like the most important.

2570
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:25,680
Please.

2571
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,100
Okay.

2572
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:26,500
Wait!

2573

Control or keyboard.

2574
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,020
Okay.

2575
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:28,520
Communication.

2576
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:29,960
Need healing.

2577
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:30,580
Okay.

2578
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:31,740
Uh...

2579
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,200
There we go.

2580
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,820
Has been... Oh shit!

2581
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:35,200
No!

2582
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:35,940
I don't wanna... Okay.

2583
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:36,900
Restore.

2584
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:37,740
Restart.

2585
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,520
No, no, no, no, no!

2586
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,040
No!

2587
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:39,500
I don't wanna restart!

2588
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:39,960
No!

2589
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:41,520
Okay.

2590
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,400
X?

2591
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:43,800
No!

2592
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:44,700
Okay.

2593
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,180
Okay.

2594
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:45,420
Okay.

2595
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,380
Guys, I fucked up.

2596
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,400
Guys, please don't kick me.

2597
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:48,620
Please don't kick me.

2598
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:49,020
Okay.

2599
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:49,560
Z.

2600
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:50,760
We don't need team up ability.

2601
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:51,700
Yeah.

2602
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,840
This is much more... This is much more important.

2603
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:57,200
Did you mean to have like 10?

2604
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,320
Wait!

2605
01:25:58,820 --> 01:25:59,440
I know!

2606
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:00,380
Okay.

2607
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:00,580
No.

2608
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:00,780
Wait.

2609
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:01,540
That's the ping button.

2610
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,420
Okay, I was AFK for a little bit...

2611
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,300
but like... it's fine.

2612
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:07,100
Okay.

2613
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:07,840
Don't get close to me!

2614
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,560
Don't get close to me!

2615
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,180
Okay!

2616
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,120
Wait.

2617
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:13,560
It's fine!

2618
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,140
That's fine!

2619
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,420
I... I am gonna break his armor!

2620
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:18,380
That's fine!

2621
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:20,680
Where are they?

2622
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:23,340
Come on!

2623
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:23,880
Let me in.

2624
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,020
Let me in!

2625
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:28,160
Boom... boom...ortedito

2626
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:35,900
Oh my god, we actually do so much damage when I'm closer to them.

2627
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,060
Who would have thought?

2628
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,760
Guys, who would have thought you do a lot of... No!

2629
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,520
Please, I did so much!

2630
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,300
I did so much!

2631
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:52,660
Nice play.

2632
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:57,200
Oh my god, I can actually shred so hard.

2633
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:04,220
Oh my god, the team up abilities, I need to remember to do them.

2634
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:08,300
I actually have to flank as Starlord.

2635
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:10,980
Yeah.

2636
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:12,400
Who would have thought?

2637
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:17,560
Guys, I forgot to spam I need healing.

2638
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:25,120
I need to remember to spam I need healing, guys.

2639
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:26,380
Yo!

2640
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:33,000
Yeah, I'm so fucking... I'm so fucking... uh... fleshy.

2641
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:38,920
Starlord, yeah he melts when he's flanking, but I don't know the map well enough to flank yet.

2642
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,060
That's Bruce Banner!

2643
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:41,800
What do you mean?

2644
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,980
He just wasn't in his D.Va mech form yet.

2645
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:50,020
I need... guys, I need health, guys.

2646
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,480
Healers, what are you fucking doing, healers?

2647
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,960
The battle starts inside.

2648
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,180
Four... three... two...

2649
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,180
one...

2650
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,180
go!

2651
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,860
I'm dying because of my healers.

2652
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:00,180
Okay.

2653
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:01,100
Meow!

2654
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,420
Alright, how do I flank this?

2655
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:08,900
Yeah.

2656
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,280
Oops, that was an accident.

2657
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,200
I was trying to... I was trying to do that.

2658
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,340
It's okay.

2659
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,360
I'm gonna try and figure out how to flank this.

2660
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:19,080
Alright guys, don't worry, I got this.

2661
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,500
Oh no.

2662
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:24,920
Holy shit, did you guys see that?

2663
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,300
Oh my god.

2664
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:28,900
Wait.

2665
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,700
Looks like the mission area is yours to capture now.

2666
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:33,860
Oh...

2667
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,440
Holy shit!

2668
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,440
Meow!

2669
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,660
Oh shit, oh no!

2670
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,420
She flanked... wait, I melt so fast!

2671
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:50,260
That actually like fucking kills so fast.

2672
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,180
Oh my god.

2673
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,460
Okay, I understand.

2674
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,540
I have to like...

2675
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,480
Flank and like be like super close.

2676
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:58,240
Did you see that?

2677
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,540
Yeah, Star Lord is like extra squishy.

2678
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,650
But if I flank correctly, I can do so much...

2679
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:06,760
What?!

2680
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:07,760
Ow!

2681
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:08,100
What?

2682
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2683
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:10,880
I got regen.

2684
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,200
I got regen.

2685
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,480
That's fucking right.

2686
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,680
That's right.

2687
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,100
Legend!

2688
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,700
That's fu- No!

2689
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:23,080
I got Star Lord in the sky!

2690
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:23,920
I got Viking!

2691
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,360
I'm tanked in the sky!

2692
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,000
I'm such a glass cannon!

2693
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:32,160
I'm so fucking fleshy!

2694
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:33,580
It's not fair!

2695
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,300
It's time for the creator clash.

2696
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,160
Wait, so be the first in?

2697
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,980
Wait, guys, I'm leaving!

2698
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:42,560
I have to leave!

2699
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:45,280
No!

2700
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,020
Guys, I wanna go to the creator clash though!

2701
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,360
It's not fair!

2702
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,380
We are undefeatable!

2703
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,480
No!

2704
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,660
My honor!

2705
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:57,220
Woo!

2706
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,620
My honors, though!

2707
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:03,500
Oh my god.

2708
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,180
Bro, what the fuck?

2709
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:12,840
Bro.

2710
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,200
Oh my god!

2711
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,240
No!

2712
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,160
Okay.

2713
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:23,900
Bro!

2714
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:24,540
Please!

2715
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:32,350
Tell the team to lose!

2716
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:34,490
Guys, lose faster!

2717
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:36,590
Okay, well...

2718
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:38,910
I wanna go to the creator clash!

2719
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:41,650
I wanna be part of the cool people!

2720
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,230
Oh my god, thank god!

2721
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:44,190
Wait, overtime!

2722
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:44,530
Die!

2723
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:44,950
Just die!

2724
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:45,730
Just die!

2725
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:46,230
No!

2726
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:46,870
Don't win!

2727
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:48,330
Don't win!

2728
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:50,350
Don't win!

2729
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:55,750
I beg of you!

2730
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:56,670
Don't win!

2731
01:30:58,170 --> 01:30:58,730
Yeah!

2732
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:03,650
It's the creator clash!

2733
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:04,450
It's the creator clash!

2734
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,170
There's a creator clash going on!

2735
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:07,870
Guys, it's overtime!

2736
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,610
Just lose!

2737
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:09,530
Oh, thank god.

2738
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:09,910
Okay.

2739
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:12,430
See not yourself now!

2740
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:13,630
Guys!

2741
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:14,290
Quick!

2742
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:15,750
Oh, thank god!

2743
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:16,510
Goodbye!

2744
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:20,450
It's faster!

2745
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:23,230
I wanna do the creator clash!

2746
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:23,870
Okay.

2747
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:24,930
Did I get in?

2748
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:26,870
Did I get in the creator clash?

2749
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:29,570
Creator clash?

2750
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:32,090
No, it's okay.

2751
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:34,750
Am I in?

2752
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:37,010
Am I in the creator clash?

2753
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:41,210
This is it!

2754
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:42,410
Oh, no!

2755
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:43,470
We lost!

2756
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:49,010
We're missing out on the fun!

2757
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:50,630
The creator clash fun!

2758
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:52,210
Did I get in?

2759
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:53,210
I don't know!

2760
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:55,250
Is this the creator clash?

2761
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:56,010
I don't know!

2762
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:01,410
It's like you get to play with the developers.

2763
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:03,210
And other... like...

2764
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:05,390
You get to play with the developers and stuff.

2765
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:07,410
I wanna play with the devs.

2766
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:08,150
Alright.

2767
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,710
So we know what's how Starlord's gonna be like.

2768
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:12,030
How about...

2769
01:32:13,230 --> 01:32:14,190
Uh... you know what?

2770
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:15,670
Let's try out...

2771
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:16,510
Okay.

2772
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:18,410
Let's try out...

2773
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,290
Uh... what do we wanna do?

2774
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:21,830
We need another strategist.

2775
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:22,330
Goddamn!

2776
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:22,570
No!

2777
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:23,330
Not Loki!

2778
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:24,650
Okay.

2779
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:26,290
Uh... you know I wanna try Spiderman.

2780
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:27,550
Does Spiderman punch?

2781
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:29,190
Okay.

2782
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:31,270
Oh, I hate punching.

2783
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:31,550
I hate punching though.

2784
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:34,170
Wait.

2785
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:37,310
I have... two of webs.

2786
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:38,030
Ooh!

2787
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:39,950
It's like Doomfist!

2788
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:42,810
I'm gonna be so bad with Spiderman.

2789
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:45,130
Okay.

2790
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:45,830
Let's see.

2791
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,050
And then the mega punch.

2792
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:50,430
Oh, I'm gonna be so bad with melee.

2793
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:54,050
I don't think this is the creator clash, guys.

2794
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,550
No!

2795
01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:58,390
We already have...

2796
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:59,710
We already have two D...

2797
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:01,050
We have two DPS.

2798
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:01,870
Two tanks.

2799
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:02,850
Okay.

2800
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:03,790
We have three DPS.

2801
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:04,470
Okay.

2802
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:05,530
Maybe not so ideal.

2803
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:06,250
Okay.

2804
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:07,030
We have one support.

2805
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:08,110
Alright.

2806
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:08,690
You know what?

2807
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:09,950
Let's try out...

2808
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:11,030
Let's try out...

2809
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:12,130
Uh...

2810
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:13,590
We can try out Mantis.

2811
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:13,970
Okay.

2812
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:14,450
Release...

2813
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:16,010
First spirit assist...

2814
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:16,770
No.

2815
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:18,030
Balloon... Oh.

2816
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:20,170
Take center stage and start dancing.

2817
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:24,030
Kill allies or grant them fire, ice shards for short durations.

2818
01:33:24,210 --> 01:33:24,750
Damage.

2819
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:26,230
Attach idle aura.

2820
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:28,190
Allies with... to restore health while...

2821
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:28,490
Oh!

2822
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,290
Cast the clump.

2823
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:30,870
Oh, wait!

2824
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,810
This is cool.

2825
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:32,170
Okay.

2826
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:32,650
We'll try this.

2827
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:34,610
Music makes people happy.

2828
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:35,530
Yay!

2829
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,030
Looks like the mission area is yours to capture now.

2830
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:40,290
I'm so used to...

2831
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:41,390
Capture the mission area!

2832
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:41,410
Okay.

2833
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:42,390
What is E again?

2834
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:43,930
He attaches people, right?

2835
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:44,910
Alright.

2836
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,310
We'll try...

2837
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:46,890
Oh, wait!

2838
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:47,370
What?

2839
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:50,770
I guess if I run enough...

2840
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:53,090
If I run enough, it does that.

2841
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,590
Be strong together!

2842
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:56,430
Okay.

2843
01:33:56,510 --> 01:33:56,850
There you go.

2844
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:57,950
There you go.

2845
01:33:57,970 --> 01:33:58,510
So I can...

2846
01:33:58,510 --> 01:33:59,710
The healers can heal themselves.

2847
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:00,790
Alright.

2848
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,530
That's interesting.

2849
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:02,370
What was...

2850
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,390
Right click again?

2851
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:06,630
Guys, what was right click?

2852
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:07,170
I don't remember.

2853
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:09,790
Oh, it abs...

2854
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:10,350
Oh, it like...

2855
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:11,390
Stucks on people, right?

2856
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:12,370
That was right click.

2857
01:34:13,170 --> 01:34:13,890
It like...

2858
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:14,610
Stuck on people.

2859
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:15,770
Okay.

2860
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:16,910
I remember now.

2861
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:18,230
We gotta go up.

2862
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:20,370
Alright.

2863
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,390
And then...

2864
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,490
I put...

2865
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:26,170
I put it on the tank, so it should be fine, right?

2866
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:28,070
And then...

2867
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:28,490
Yeah.

2868
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:29,110
Yeah.

2869
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:29,990
We're double healing.

2870
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:31,650
Don't worry.

2871
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:32,150
I got you.

2872
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:33,390
Okay.

2873
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:33,730
I...

2874
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,130
Don't worry.

2875
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:35,710
I got you!

2876
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:37,290
Don't worry.

2877
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:38,330
I can DPS her.

2878
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:39,570
Oh, my God!

2879
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:40,990
Your DPS is so weak!

2880
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:43,610
Oh, wait!

2881
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:46,230
Dude, this DPS is so bad!

2882
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:47,670
Oh, my...

2883
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:49,350
Okay.

2884
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:50,870
I think I found the mercy.

2885
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:55,010
She does so much healing, though.

2886
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:57,690
She actually does so much healing.

2887
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,050
Oh, my God.

2888
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:00,490
It's actually crazy how much healing she does.

2889
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:01,950
But her...

2890
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,710
Her DPS is actually garbage.

2891
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:04,910
I am not a fan.

2892
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:07,930
I'm not a fan of the...

2893
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:08,810
I'm not...

2894
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:09,270
Okay!

2895
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,850
Almost...

2896
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:10,230
Okay!

2897
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:12,190
You can't say that because like...

2898
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,050
Because like, fucking Loki's...

2899
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:17,210
Loki's DPS is actually insane.

2900
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:19,210
Like, you can't say that.

2901
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,350
I can solo tank a tank if...

2902
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:25,650
Solo kill a tank on Loki if I want to.

2903
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:26,770
It's okay.

2904
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:27,550
I get it.

2905
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:27,990
I get it.

2906
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:29,270
I get it.

2907
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:31,250
No, Kiriko's DPS is crazy as well.

2908
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,510
I wonder if I have to headshot.

2909
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:34,270
Maybe if I headshot...

2910
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:37,050
If I headshot...

2911
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:38,770
No, the DPS is still pretty bad.

2912
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:40,030
Alright.

2913
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:41,370
It's time to dance.

2914
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:42,330
We are...

2915
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:42,910
We're dancing.

2916
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:43,570
Let's go.

2917
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:44,470
Yeah!

2918
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:45,330
Let's fucking go.

2919
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:52,410
Now it's damage!

2920
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:55,590
Oh, shit!

2921
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:57,470
I need a battle.

2922
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:57,530
Oh, shit!

2923
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:16,550
Okay, so her ult... what her ult does is she can either damage boost or heal everybody.

2924
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:17,950
That was her ult.

2925
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:20,550
Let me break it down.

2926
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:25,650
It looks stupid.

2927
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:27,850
Yes, it actually does look a little stupid.

2928
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:31,150
It's fun though.

2929
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:32,310
I'm actually having a lot of fun.

2930
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:34,770
How do you use sprays?

2931
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:35,690
Hey guys.

2932
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:37,430
You guys want to see my spray?

2933
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:38,870
Wait, how?

2934
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:40,730
Guys, what the fuck?

2935
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:41,850
You guys lied to me.

2936
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:42,730
I can't use it.

2937
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:49,250
Okay, but yeah, this is... Man, she's so easy.

2938
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:50,370
Holy shit.

2939
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:51,910
Icy Disco.

2940
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:53,570
Okay, attach to Idle Aura.

2941
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:54,850
Restore his health.

2942
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:57,270
Pass it to hit the enemy and restore health.

2943
01:36:57,450 --> 01:36:59,530
Okay, I have to use my right click to hit an enemy.

2944
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:02,230
And then... yeah, so it like damage boosts.

2945
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:08,910
If I keep moving forward... if I keep moving forward, I'll just go for it.

2946
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:09,910
See, they're real people!

2947
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,610
I win because I'm good at the video game.

2948
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:17,730
My damage is fucking dog shit though.

2949
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:20,530
I honestly think Loki's a...

2950
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:21,470
best healer.

2951
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:23,170
She's so cute.

2952
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,650
She is pretty cute.

2953
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:29,250
Like even Kiriko has more damage than this.

2954
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:32,490
I think she just has like insane heal output though.

2955
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:35,870
I would admit her heal output is actually insane.

2956
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:38,670
Like I admit that.

2957
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:40,850
Oh my god guys, it's okay.

2958
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:41,790
It's gonna be okay.

2959
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:44,050
Guys, it's going to be okay.

2960
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,430
Don't worry, I'm healing.

2961
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:49,790
The mission area is yours to capture now.

2962
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:50,430
Oh god.

2963
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:50,970
I'm healing.

2964
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:51,870
It's going to be okay.

2965
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:52,570
Oh my god.

2966
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:53,290
I actually got that heal.

2967
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,390
Nice.

2968
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:55,850
Nice.

2969
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:57,890
I got that heal.

2970
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,430
Wait, what was my shift again guys?

2971
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:04,830
Hear, hear, hear.

2972
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:07,050
What was my shift again?

2973
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:09,290
Yeah, she heals.

2974
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:10,610
She does a lot of healing.

2975
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:12,710
And then I could like put a...

2976
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:16,150
I think like... I don't know.

2977
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,990
I think if you want to do super offensive, you do Rocket and Loki.

2978
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:26,730
I don't know what her... I forgot what her... I forgot what her shift does.

2979
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:27,430
Is it a healer?

2980
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:29,210
Oh no!

2981
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:30,210
Oh no!

2982
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:31,310
Guys!

2983
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:32,330
Get me away!

2984
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:33,630
Get me away from that!

2985
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:34,570
Don't worry!

2986
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:35,650
I got you!

2987
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:37,290
I'm gonna clap!

2988
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,570
I'm gonna start clapping!

2989
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:43,990
Don't worry!

2990
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:44,750
Clap to win!

2991
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:48,110
Alright, nice.

2992
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:50,330
Don't worry, I got you.

2993
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:52,870
If you fly too much, I don't got you.

2994
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:55,310
Clap!

2995
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:56,330
Get healed!

2996
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:57,150
Starts clapping.

2997
01:38:58,630 --> 01:38:59,430
Oh god.

2998
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:00,570
Please!

2999
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:01,690
Oh!

3000
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:02,450
Don't worry!

3001
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:03,970
It's time to dance!

3002
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,490
It's time to dance, guys!

3003
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:08,750
Let's fucking go!

3004
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:10,750
Wooo!

3005
01:39:16,810 --> 01:39:19,750
Oh my god!

3006
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:21,410
Okay, her ult is really stupid.

3007
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:24,810
Her ult is fucking stupid.

3008
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:28,050
It looks so silly.

3009
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:29,150
It is.

3010
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:31,130
It does look so silly.

3011
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:34,410
Alright, nice.

3012
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:36,050
I got my healing in.

3013
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:38,250
There we go.

3014
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:39,190
God, that look!

3015
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,570
Wait, it is!

3016
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:44,110
It's like Zen ult, but like more fabulous!

3017
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:47,810
You're fucking right!

3018
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:50,070
It's just like Zenyatta!

3019
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:55,930
Oh shit!

3020
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:57,550
Don't let him get near us.

3021
01:39:57,970 --> 01:39:58,910
Don't worry, guys.

3022
01:39:59,050 --> 01:39:59,910
Wait, that was easy.

3023
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:01,130
Nice.

3024
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:01,910
Nice assist.

3025
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:03,670
Oh god.

3026
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:04,570
Don't worry!

3027
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:06,010
It's clapping time!

3028
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:11,150
Zen throwing the dumpy!

3029
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:14,970
It could be a Zen ult if they weren't cowards!

3030
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:19,850
Zenyatta, but nice.

3031
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:25,010
Oh yeah, like Zenyatta if he didn't become a monk.

3032
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:28,290
What could have been.

3033
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:31,210
What could have been for our boy Zenyatta.

3034
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:35,310
Okay, nice.

3035
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:36,570
Can I do a lot?

3036
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:38,710
Yo!

3037
01:40:38,710 --> 01:40:39,990
I did the most healing!

3038
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:40,870
Endorse me!

3039
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:42,670
Endorse me, guys!

3040
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,910
I did the most healing, guys!

3041
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:48,130
If it wasn't for me, you guys would never get healed.

3042
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:49,870
I know you guys are voting for yourself!

3043
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:50,670
How could you?

3044
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:52,590
Oh, you guys are voting for yourself!

3045
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:54,390
How dare you!

3046
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:02,490
Oh, nice.

3047
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:03,210
See, guys?

3048
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:04,070
They voted for me now.

3049
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:04,790
I knew it.

3050
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:07,490
I'm so confused.

3051
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:09,690
How could you do this?

3052
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:11,430
Vote for yourself!

3053
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:17,280
Alright.

3054
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:20,180
Please, let me play a non-healer.

3055
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:23,940
How dare.

3056
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,500
How dare you.

3057
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:26,720
Alright, let's see.

3058
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,860
I wanna play...

3059
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:32,940
I play... Okay, now I wanna play Spider-Man.

3060
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,920
Let me play Spider-Man!

3061
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:36,700
Alright, let me see.

3062
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,860
Oh my god, I forgot how many...

3063
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:39,940
Okay.

3064
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:41,160
Use a warning.

3065
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,600
Press space to crawl.

3066
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,600
Shoot a web cluster that deals damage.

3067
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:47,740
It attacks a spider tracer to hit the enemy.

3068
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:48,980
Perform a double jump.

3069
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:49,800
Launch an...

3070
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,380
Oh my... This is why it's five star.

3071
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,940
Launch an enemy upward dealing extra damage.

3072
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:57,260
Oh shit!

3073
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,520
Guys, I'm not... No!

3074
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,480
Oh my god, okay.

3075
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,340
Does he dance?

3076
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,580
Oh my god, okay.

3077
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,380
I haven't even finished reading it.

3078
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:10,540
Shoot a web... Okay.

3079
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:15,860
Shoot a web... If the enemy is tagged, Spider-Man will get pulled to them.

3080
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,540
Instead, launch an... Okay, E...

3081
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:20,240
There's an F attack too?

3082
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:23,760
E... F... Okay.

3083
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:24,740
Alright.

3084
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:27,580
Alright, there's an F attack as well.

3085
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:29,220
And then there's E.

3086
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:31,300
And then there's this.

3087
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,920
This makes me go up to them.

3088
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:35,380
Okay, we got this.

3089
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:36,200
Alright.

3090
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,780
Alright, there's a lot of moves.

3091
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,360
Alright, movement tech tab.

3092
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,600
Oh my god.

3093
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,100
Oh god.

3094
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:47,700
Oh god.

3095
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:50,380
Okay.

3096
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:52,960
That's fucking right.

3097
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:53,580
Where are you?

3098
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:54,960
That's fucking right.

3099
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:55,900
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

3100
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:56,860
No!

3101
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,000
He got away!

3102
01:42:58,680 --> 01:42:59,520
Guys, I need healing!

3103
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,640
Guys!

3104
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:05,360
Okay, we have... We have...

3105
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,020
We have one healer again?!

3106
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:16,140
When... When can I play TPS?

3107
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:22,340
One day...

3108
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:30,200
One day I can also enjoy... enjoy the freedom.

3109
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,800
Back to Italy.

3110
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:35,240
Back I go.

3111
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:37,580
Back I go.

3112
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:38,720
I know my place.

3113
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:41,520
I know my place.

3114
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,180
I guess I was meant to be a healer.

3115
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,540
Okay, here we go.

3116
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,800
Go into the aura.

3117
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:54,980
Don't worry, guys.

3118
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:56,780
We're fine.

3119
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:58,320
We're fine.

3120
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,900
The fucking secondary healer.

3121
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:03,860
Because I'm a fucking team player.

3122
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,880
Please let the reload.

3123
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:09,860
He's so low!

3124
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:11,940
See?

3125
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,060
I... Oh my god!

3126
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,020
He... The game knows I'm a team player!

3127
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,840
Doki is a healing slave.

3128
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,680
Why can't I play... Guys!

3129
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:26,020
Support is also so fun too, guys!

3130
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:27,980
I'm having...

3131
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:31,400
Honestly, I am having a lot of fun on support.

3132
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:32,200
Not gonna lie.

3133
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:33,760
Like, I would say...

3134
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,220
How many clones can I put out?

3135
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,660
I don't think I have... Jesus Christ!

3136
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,400
Bro, did you see the movement tech on the Hulk?

3137
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:41,940
Oh my god!

3138
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:44,060
There's Hulk movement tech?!

3139
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:48,040
Oh my god!

3140
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:49,300
Bro!

3141
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:52,400
The fucking Hulk movement tech though!

3142
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:57,060
Alright, we're gonna fucking not deal with that.

3143
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:00,280
The Hulk jump.

3144
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:01,440
Bro!

3145
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,860
He's just fucking doomfisting everywhere!

3146
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,980
He's doing some fucking rollouts!

3147
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:07,480
Goodbye.

3148
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:11,040
Doki is forever lowkey.

3149
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,580
Don't worry, Hulk!

3150
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:13,320
I got you!

3151
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:15,080
Don't worry!

3152
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:15,960
Nooooo!

3153
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,800
Oh, it's Bruce Banner!

3154
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:20,080
Bruce Banner, no!

3155
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,320
Bruce Banner!

3156
01:45:23,980 --> 01:45:24,500
No!

3157
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:25,480
Bruce Banner!

3158
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,760
Anyway, how many fucking...

3159
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:29,560
How many fucking clones can I put out?

3160
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,360
The beginning of a lowkey main.

3161
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:34,980
Always have been.

3162
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:39,060
I knew I would have been a lowkey main for the rest of my life.

3163
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:44,680
I've always was a lowkey main.

3164
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:45,740
You just didn't know.

3165
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:48,840
Okay, I need to reload, guys.

3166
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,420
Don't worry, I got you.

3167
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:50,780
Please!

3168
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:51,660
Please!

3169
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,060
Your movement is too good!

3170
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:57,700
Bro, I might as well just fucking kill this guy.

3171
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,460
Okay, nice.

3172
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:03,240
Two clones?

3173
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:04,560
Okay, I can put two clones.

3174
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:06,720
Wait, I wanna be Penny Parker!

3175
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:09,640
It's spider time!

3176
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:09,760
Yeah!

3177
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:11,760
That's fucking weird.

3178
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:12,780
I'll spider you.

3179
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:15,500
Back!

3180
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

3181
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,480
Okay, nice.

3182
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:19,820
I'll fucking...

3183
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:21,060
Oh, goodbye.

3184
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:22,020
Goodbye.

3185
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,680
I don't know what I'm doing, but goodbye.

3186
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:24,500
Oh!

3187
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:25,800
Nice.

3188
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:26,980
Here we go.

3189
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,060
We're fine.

3190
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,760
We're okay.

3191
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:32,660
Oh my god, our team is fucking busted.

3192
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,540
We're rolling them so hard.

3193
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,060
This is actually not fair.

3194
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:41,920
Holy shit.

3195
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:45,540
Bro, our Hulk is actually going fucking apeshit right now.

3196
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:46,280
Like...

3197
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:48,720
He's winted.

3198
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:51,040
He's winted.

3199
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,660
Oh my god.

3200
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,520
Look at him go!

3201
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:58,460
Fucking, the rollouts is insane!

3202
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,680
The rollout is actually insane!

3203
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,820
Okay, let's get rid of fucking Star Lord.

3204
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:07,440
Alright, nice.

3205
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:09,560
Okay, I'm gonna...

3206
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:11,060
Put another one here.

3207
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:12,140
Go where I got you.

3208
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:12,360
Oh!

3209
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,360
Oh, god.

3210
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,140
Oh, I'm back!

3211
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,040
We all have one respawn!

3212
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:18,140
Nice.

3213
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:18,700
Okay, I'm gonna...

3214
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:19,500
Nice.

3215
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:20,660
Don't worry!

3216
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:22,080
I got you!

3217
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:23,860
Did we win?

3218
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:25,880
Hulk master.

3219
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:29,580
Hulk doing things as usual.

3220
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:36,380
Okay, no, he 100% deserves that.

3221
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:39,280
This guy went fucking absolute nuclear.

3222
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:43,460
It was actually crazy watching him bounce everywhere.

3223
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:45,280
Oh my god.

3224
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:46,560
Hello.

3225
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:47,160
Hey guys.

3226
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,260
Oh, yes!

3227
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:48,660
Oh, yes!

3228
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:48,680
Oh, yes!

3229
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:49,280
Guys, endorse me!

3230
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,160
Guys!

3231
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:50,680
Yes!

3232
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,640
Oh my god.

3233
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:55,920
They know I...

3234
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,400
I guess you also get an MVP too, Mr. Hulk.

3235
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:01,880
Easy clap.

3236
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,980
Hulk actually smashed.

3237
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,140
Oh my god.

3238
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,920
He was fucking insane, dude.

3239
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,320
This is actually crazy.

3240
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,340
His gamma radiation.

3241
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:18,680
Oh my god.

3242
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:20,200
He went gamma.

3243
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:24,920
Loki doki.

3244
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,700
I'm gonna be a Loki main.

3245
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:31,320
Every time I try to not be a Loki main, it drags me back in.

3246
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:34,280
Wait.

3247
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,580
Oh wait.

3248
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,560
Did people like leave their team?

3249
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:38,680
Oh no.

3250
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:39,080
Wait.

3251
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,880
I wanna try Mantis.

3252
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:42,980
Oh, we lost.

3253
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,100
Hey guys.

3254
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,080
I came...

3255
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:46,720
Oh, I was a Phil.

3256
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:48,680
What the fuck?

3257
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:48,900
What?

3258
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,260
I just got here!

3259
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,080
What?

3260
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:55,560
I just got here!

3261
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,500
You are fated to be Loki.

3262
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,200
What the hell?

3263
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:04,000
I literally have zero zeros.

3264
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:06,120
I didn't even get a chance to pick my character.

3265
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:07,920
I don't even exist.

3266
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:12,960
I literally don't even exist in the fucking game.

3267
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,720
I just got backfilled.

3268
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:19,320
I can't believe they backfilled me.

3269
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:25,780
What a bad teammate.

3270
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,500
Oh my god.

3271
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:29,980
I barely existed.

3272
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,860
Loki isn't real.

3273
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,140
I'm pretty sure they are going to make the UI a lot better.

3274
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:37,940
Because it's alpha.

3275
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,060
Guys, can I play Spider-Man now?

3276
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,300
Guys, please.

3277
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,980
Please, can I please play Spider-Man, guys?

3278
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:46,080
Can I?

3279
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:46,700
Can I play Spider-Man?

3280
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,260
Can I please play DPS?

3281
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:57,240
If the Marble Rival devs are watching, please make Roll Q.

3282
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:00,000
That's all I want.

3283
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:03,820
Please, please make Roll Q.

3284
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:08,700
Please.

3285
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:11,340
Loki doki smile.

3286
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,080
Please.

3287
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,200
That's all I want.

3288
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:17,600
Please.

3289
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:17,640
That's all I want.

3290
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:17,760
Please.

3291
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:17,800
That's all I want.

3292
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:19,760
Fluffy, please.

3293
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,420
I beg you.

3294
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,800
Fluffy, please support.

3295
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,400
It's so fun.

3296
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,660
I swear to god.

3297
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,560
Support is so fucking fun.

3298
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,820
I swear to god.

3299
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:31,860
I swear to god.

3300
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:33,680
As a support player, I loved Roll Q.

3301
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:34,740
I fucking...

3302
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:37,800
I don't know if lower ELOs hated Roll Q.

3303
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:40,060
But higher ELO players loved Roll Q.

3304
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:46,540
Because I fucking hated being a support player in Overwatch and having to play tank or DPS because there were just too many supports.

3305
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:51,880
I remember one time in Overwatch 1, we had a team where it was just 6 support players.

3306
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:53,220
And we actually won.

3307
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,100
It was actually crazy.

3308
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:57,020
And then we were like, oh my god, this looks like fucking Hanamura.

3309
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,880
Wait, is there a choke point like Hanamura?

3310
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:02,360
Wait, what the fuck?

3311
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,600
This almost...

3312
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,920
Okay, the choke looks like Hanamura, but other than that it's different.

3313
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:09,340
Okay.

3314
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:10,780
Oh god.

3315
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:12,400
Guys.

3316
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,560
Oh, it's fine.

3317
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15,100
Oh, it's not fine.

3318
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:15,900
It's not fine.

3319
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,980
The tank wants to get me.

3320
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:19,240
Oh my god.

3321
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,820
This is when you... This is a person that actually knows how to play low Q.

3322
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:24,120
Because look at all these low Qs.

3323
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,020
Oh, please.

3324
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:27,000
Leave me alone.

3325
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:31,320
That's fucking right.

3326
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,100
Get you.

3327
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:33,060
Got you.

3328
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,340
That's fucking right.

3329
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:35,660
Yes!

3330
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:37,640
Got the fucking healer guy.

3331
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:40,140
Yes!

3332
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:41,380
I got the healers!

3333
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:43,240
Oh my god.

3334
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,980
This is like Genji, but like harder.

3335
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:48,140
Holy shit.

3336
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:52,160
Bro, this is so hard.

3337
01:51:54,860 --> 01:51:57,200
I need a higher sensitivity.

3338
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:01,940
Holy shit.

3339
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:05,740
To play Spider-Man, you need such a high sensitivity.

3340
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:07,020
It's actually crazy.

3341
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:11,120
Oh my god.

3342
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:11,580
Oh my god.

3343
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,460
This is actually so...

3344
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:13,520
Oh!

3345
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:16,760
Oh.

3346
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:18,680
Guys, just go goats, please.

3347
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:21,620
I wonder if you can make goats in Marvel Rivals.

3348
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,560
That would be so funny if you can.

3349
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:25,580
Oh my god.

3350
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:26,100
I got him.

3351
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,280
Get me in here.

3352
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,500
That's fucking right.

3353
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:34,400
Guys, so many things are happening on my screen.

3354
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:37,320
Guys, so many things are happening on my screen.

3355
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,180
I'm getting disoriented.

3356
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:41,320
No.

3357
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:42,540
No.

3358
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:43,820
Oh god.

3359
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:44,580
Okay.

3360
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:45,520
Bye.

3361
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:46,100
No!

3362
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:48,980
What is happening?

3363
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:50,460
Guys, I can't.

3364
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:52,980
I cannot play Spider-Man.

3365
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,000
I can't.

3366
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:56,020
Oh my god.

3367
01:52:56,180 --> 01:53:00,460
I get too disoriented playing Spider-Man.

3368
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,920
I'll just be Storm.

3369
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:05,560
Clearly, Storm would be easier, right?

3370
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:07,240
Because I'm in the air.

3371
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:07,920
You know?

3372
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:09,820
And then I'll do damage boost right here.

3373
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,300
And then I'll do fucking mega damage boost here.

3374
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:13,860
That's fucking right.

3375
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:15,340
I just can't.

3376
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:17,710
Like, it's actually so difficult.

3377
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:18,900
Oh.

3378
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:19,700
I need healing.

3379
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:20,420
I need healing!

3380
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:22,740
Backs.

3381
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:27,740
Oh.

3382
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:29,380
Wait, do we have enough tanks?

3383
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,820
Oh, we don't.

3384
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,300
No!

3385
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,240
Okay, we need to try tank.

3386
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:33,700
You know what?

3387
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:34,520
I'll try Magneto.

3388
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:36,060
What is Magneto?

3389
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:39,000
Okay, shift, change the magnetic field to form.

3390
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:39,780
Blocking all four.

3391
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,220
Conjuring magic shield.

3392
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:41,980
Damage taken.

3393
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,520
Oh my god.

3394
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:43,980
What?

3395
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:45,720
Wait, what is this space?

3396
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:48,160
Oh, space to fall slowly.

3397
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:49,060
Okay, we're gonna try.

3398
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:51,300
We'll try Magneto because we need a tank.

3399
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:54,460
Guys, we will actually play Magneto.

3400
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,760
Guys, don't worry.

3401
01:53:58,920 --> 01:53:59,820
You're all glad.

3402
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,760
You're all glad.

3403
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:02,920
Wait, what?

3404
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:03,940
I thought that was the...

3405
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:05,740
Okay.

3406
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:07,460
Okay, that's the shield.

3407
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:07,760
Okay.

3408
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:08,420
I got it.

3409
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:09,000
I got it.

3410
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:09,720
I had to learn!

3411
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,640
Guys, how do I not have heals anymore?

3412
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:16,120
Guys, we have literally two supports!

3413
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:18,240
Oh god.

3414
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,320
Oh god.

3415
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:20,760
Bro!

3416
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:22,740
There's a fucking Hela behind us!

3417
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:25,660
No!

3418
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:30,180
Guys!

3419
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,160
Get the fucking Hela!

3420
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:37,380
Please.

3421
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,320
Get the fucking Hela!

3422
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:43,060
Oh god.

3423
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,740
Oh god.

3424
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:45,980
This is so difficult.

3425
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:48,700
I'm trying so hard to tank!

3426
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:52,120
Bro!

3427
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,600
I'm just getting frozen!

3428
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:01,700
Bro, I'm getting...

3429
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:02,740
Fuck this guy.

3430
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,760
I'm gonna get rid of that fucking Hela if it's the last thing I do.

3431
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:10,520
If it's the last thing I do.

3432
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,320
If it's the last thing I do.

3433
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:15,080
Bro, I'm so mad no one's killing this Hela right now.

3434
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:15,380
Bro, I'm so mad no one's killing this Hela right now.

3435
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:15,840
I'm actually...

3436
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,520
I'm so mad.

3437
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,160
She's like just chilling in our backlines.

3438
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:22,940
Where is she?

3439
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:24,400
Where is she?

3440
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:27,940
Oh my god, she's lit!

3441
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:29,980
Guys, just fuck... guys!

3442
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,720
Oh my god!

3443
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:35,860
Guys, please!

3444
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,920
Just kill the Hela in the backlines!

3445
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,720
That's all I ask.

3446
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:45,780
Guys, she's literally in our backlines just farming us.

3447
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:47,840
Guys, okay.

3448
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,060
Where is she?

3449
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:51,380
Oh god.

3450
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:52,200
I need healing.

3451
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:53,060
Wait, what?

3452
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:53,780
Oh my god!

3453
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:54,380
What?

3454
01:55:56,180 --> 01:55:56,780
No.

3455
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:58,740
That's fucking right.

3456
01:55:59,060 --> 01:55:59,660
Yeah.

3457
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:02,440
Okay.

3458
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:03,700
It might be a...

3459
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:04,600
little overkill.

3460
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:08,180
But like, I swear it was worth it.

3461
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:11,100
It was so 100% worth it.

3462
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:12,580
Is she still up there?

3463
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,580
Is she actually?

3464
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,780
Oh my god!

3465
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:18,000
She is!

3466
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:21,160
Are you fucking kidding?

3467
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:23,680
Somebody please shoot her down!

3468
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:27,980
I'm gonna fly to her.

3469
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:28,960
I'm mad.

3470
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:30,980
Worth it.

3471
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:33,900
Somebody please...

3472
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:37,460
Fly to this fucking bitch.

3473
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:40,920
Okay.

3474
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:42,740
Okay.

3475
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:43,880
That's not fair!

3476
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,380
Because I got shot from the side!

3477
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,700
And that's the third shot on the side!

3478
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,000
I can't get your...

3479
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,900
Her teammates are actually...

3480
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:54,920
Where's my help?

3481
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:55,560
Okay.

3482
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:58,180
Fuck!

3483
01:56:58,180 --> 01:56:59,060
Oh my god!

3484
01:56:59,080 --> 01:56:59,720
It's over!

3485
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:02,740
I'm literally the only person...

3486
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:04,360
Fucking shooting her.

3487
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,220
Oh my god!

3488
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,240
Oh my god!

3489
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,920
Literally the only one!

3490
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:16,920
Oh my god!

3491
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:18,160
I'm actually...

3492
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:21,640
I can't believe I'm the only one actually shooting.

3493
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:22,980
Guys, I need healing.

3494
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,200
Guys...

3495
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:27,680
I swear to god.

3496
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:30,480
If I see that hella back there in the side...

3497
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:30,960
If I see that hella back there in the side...

3498
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:32,020
I swear to god!

3499
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:43,320
I swear to fucking god.

3500
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:45,140
Oh my god.

3501
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:46,480
And our fucking...

3502
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,200
Bro, she's heading back there!

3503
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:54,500
She's actually heading back there!

3504
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:56,540
That's actually...

3505
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:57,760
Fucking crazy!

3506
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,700
That she's trying to get back to high ground!

3507
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,900
I'm actually so mad!

3508
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:04,820
Bro!

3509
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,280
Bro!

3510
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:07,740
Bro!

3511
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:09,640
I'm getting out!

3512
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:11,560
I'm getting out DPS!

3513
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:13,600
She's there again!

3514
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,500
She's there again!

3515
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:19,280
Oh my god!

3516
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:23,380
The only way I can actually fight her is if I fucking play Storm.

3517
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:24,000
The only way I can actually fight her is if I fucking play Storm.

3518
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,300
Only because...

3519
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:26,400
Oh god.

3520
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:27,540
Oh my god!

3521
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,280
Bro, she's so good at hella!

3522
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,060
She's so good!

3523
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:32,440
Her projectile's insane!

3524
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:39,080
Holy...

3525
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:41,940
She knows the projectile speed already!

3526
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,860
That's actually...

3527
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:44,320
That's cringe.

3528
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,940
That's so cringe.

3529
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,680
Fuck you!

3530
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:53,720
I don't care!

3531
01:58:58,940 --> 01:58:59,660
It's okay!

3532
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:01,860
I got her in the end!

3533
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:03,300
I don't care!

3534
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:06,740
I don't care!

3535
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:06,920
I don't care!

3536
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,420
It's cause she had her fucking...

3537
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:10,800
She was camping us in the fucking back!

3538
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,120
Oh my god!

3539
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:15,480
Oh my god!

3540
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,040
That's literally the only person...

3541
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,180
That's literally the only person...

3542
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:21,540
I was the only person that dealt with the hella.

3543
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:22,840
You guys are off!

3544
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:31,700
Literally the only person that was willing to shoot the dumb hella.

3545
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,360
Time to play hella.

3546
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,760
It's time to play hella.

3547
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:37,300
It's time...

3548
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:41,580
It's time to play hella.

3549
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:43,000
We're so bad.

3550
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:44,320
Okay, let's see.

3551
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:45,920
I need to remember what the E was.

3552
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:47,120
I still don't know what the E is.

3553
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,140
Okay, let's see.

3554
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:51,120
Okay, let's see.

3555
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:51,900
Fire multiple E.

3556
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,420
Projection, alt, explosion, hella, spear.

3557
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:55,000
Oh, okay!

3558
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:55,820
Stuns people.

3559
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:58,680
Now I know what it does.

3560
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:01,000
Now I know what it does.

3561
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:01,860
It stuns people.

3562
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,340
You can't beat him, join him.

3563
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:05,740
Exactly.

3564
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:07,760
I think I've been having a lot of fun though.

3565
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:08,960
Honestly.

3566
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:10,560
Language Jokey!

3567
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:13,160
This is a family game owned by Disney!

3568
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,180
Thank you for the super chat!

3569
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:15,640
Alright.

3570
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,840
I think this is actually a really fun game.

3571
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,500
I don't know if it will live for...

3572
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:22,800
I think if they change the UI.

3573
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:27,540
I honestly think they have to change the UI a lot.

3574
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:29,780
To make this a better game.

3575
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:32,440
Because I'm not a huge fan of the visuals.

3576
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,200
Not the character models, but the attacks and stuff.

3577
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:38,420
And you have to change the health bars.

3578
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,320
I think they should change the health bars.

3579
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:41,220
And the...

3580
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:43,260
Because like...

3581
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:45,640
I always like...

3582
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:47,100
I don't like the health bars being in the middle.

3583
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:47,780
At the bottom.

3584
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,780
Because I always forget what my health is.

3585
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:50,920
I don't like the UI.

3586
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:52,160
But I'm assuming because this is Alpha.

3587
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:53,820
Because this is Alpha, right?

3588
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:55,040
So like...

3589
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,580
A lot of things are going to change.

3590
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,940
Because Overwatch UI during Alpha test was so fucking bad.

3591
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:02,300
It was so bad.

3592
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:06,540
It was like not...

3593
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:08,440
Okay.

3594
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:09,720
Alright.

3595
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,920
I'm going to do what she did to me.

3596
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:16,420
It's fine.

3597
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:17,100
It's fine.

3598
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,280
It's fine.

3599
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,540
Here we go.

3600
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:23,180
It's fine.

3601
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:23,620
That's fine.

3602
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:25,340
Guys, where's my teammate?

3603
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:28,800
Guys!

3604
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:29,820
Guys!

3605
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,440
The end glitch.

3606
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:34,140
Where the fuck is my teammate?

3607
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,480
I did so much!

3608
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:37,420
I actually did so much!

3609
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:39,580
It's fun.

3610
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:40,560
It's a fun game.

3611
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:43,280
It's actually a really fun game.

3612
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:43,900
And like...

3613
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:45,160
It rewards good players.

3614
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:47,460
It's so good.

3615
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,400
It just feels really nice being like...

3616
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,120
When you can aim and then like...

3617
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,960
You know, kill them.

3618
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:58,840
It feels so rewarding being...

3619
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:00,760
If you're like...

3620
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:01,500
Decent aim.

3621
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:02,800
Alright.

3622
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:05,640
Alright, nice.

3623
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:06,480
I got rid of...

3624
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,260
Guys, I did it!

3625
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,460
I got rid of the fucking squid!

3626
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,680
Guys, I clutched!

3627
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:13,880
The squid is gone!

3628
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:15,260
He no longer can hurt you!

3629
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:17,880
Double kill!

3630
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:21,860
That's fucking right.

3631
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,220
OOOOOOOOH!

3632
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:25,360
Loki, please!

3633
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:26,640
Loki!

3634
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,200
I'm taking damage!

3635
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:28,660
Loki!

3636
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:31,440
Kill me!

3637
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:34,480
Kill me, you simple temps!

3638
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:36,620
Where the fuck is the healing?

3639
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:40,980
Guys, okay.

3640
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:42,940
I'm taking damage!

3641
02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:44,480
I'm a cool team player.

3642
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:45,680
Alright.

3643
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:48,040
DPS.

3644
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:48,800
I'm like...

3645
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:50,820
I'm fucking like hanging in there.

3646
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:51,900
Right now.

3647
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,680
I'm fucking hanging in there at the moment.

3648
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:57,680
Guys, it's alright.

3649
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:58,760
98 HP.

3650
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:00,380
I'm fine with that, I guess.

3651
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,840
Now I'm 83!

3652
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:03,320
Wooo!

3653
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:06,960
It's okay.

3654
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,880
As long as I don't peek, it's fine.

3655
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:10,500
Guys...

3656
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:13,660
Oh, nice.

3657
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:15,860
Okay.

3658
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,480
I'm just like...

3659
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:20,100
Oh my god, I'm finally past...

3660
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:21,840
Guys, it's actually crazy.

3661
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:24,080
I'm finally past like...

3662
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:25,620
98 HP.

3663
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:28,200
I don't know... I never knew what that was like.

3664
02:03:29,460 --> 02:03:30,240
What the fuck?

3665
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:31,500
There's a guy right here.

3666
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:33,240
Is that... Who's that?

3667
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,360
Who's that?

3668
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:36,080
I'm gonna save my ult for the next round.

3669
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:38,240
Who's that?

3670
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:39,860
Come on.

3671
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:40,580
Come on, Scarlet!

3672
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:41,280
Come on!

3673
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,220
Oh, no, no, no, no!

3674
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,780
She more sucked me!

3675
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:46,000
She more sucked me!

3676
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:50,700
Loki, please help me!

3677
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:51,480
Loki!

3678
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,320
Please!

3679
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:57,160
Please!

3680
02:03:58,060 --> 02:04:00,300
All I want is a heal!

3681
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,520
All I want is a heal!

3682
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:05,080
Please!

3683
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:07,560
There's literally like three of you!

3684
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,100
I don't understand!

3685
02:04:10,740 --> 02:04:12,120
Wait, what is that?

3686
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,580
Oh my god.

3687
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:14,380
Please!

3688
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:15,160
No!

3689
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:17,700
Okay.

3690
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:19,540
Alright, I gotta Q then.

3691
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:20,500
I need to get closer.

3692
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:21,660
Loki, please.

3693
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:22,740
Just top me off.

3694
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:23,620
Please.

3695
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,260
Please, Loki.

3696
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:26,440
Just top me off.

3697
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:27,540
Please!

3698
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:31,960
Please!

3699
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:35,120
Please!

3700
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:37,160
Please!

3701
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:37,840
Please!

3702
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:43,440
Heal is illegal...

3703
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:48,560
Guys, why don't we have heals?

3704
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,040
Our Loki swapped off healing.

3705
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:51,960
Please!

3706
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:56,120
Do you think he swapped off healing because of me?

3707
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:58,800
Guys, there's no way.

3708
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:00,400
There's... Okay.

3709
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:05,200
Now I forgot what her ult does, but like, that was a very much of a waste of an ult.

3710
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:05,880
LOL!

3711
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:07,780
Wait, JK?

3712
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:15,000
Guys, do you think she got off healing because of me, guys?

3713
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,140
I think it was me.

3714
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:23,180
Guys, I think it was me, guys.

3715
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:26,300
I might have spammed here a little bit too much.

3716
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:27,560
Just maybe.

3717
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:29,120
Just maybe.

3718
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:29,140
Just maybe.

3719
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:35,520
That was my bad.

3720
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:38,860
Look, I needed heals!

3721
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:42,900
It's not my fault somebody fucking decided not to heal.

3722
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:47,260
Like, I am doing my job.

3723
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:49,100
Oh no.

3724
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:50,440
Oh no.

3725
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,600
Oh no, please.

3726
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,020
I'm trying.

3727
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:54,980
I'm trying.

3728
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:56,420
I'm trying so hard.

3729
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:02,600
I made my support tilted.

3730
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:06,360
Oh man.

3731
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:12,640
Why did he do this to me?

3732
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:13,900
We were winning!

3733
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:17,640
If he still healer, we would have won!

3734
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:20,860
How could he do this to me?

3735
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,620
Destined to be Loki bird.

3736
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,800
Just destined to be Loki.

3737
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:33,580
I mean, I feel like... Oh, BearDog went healer?

3738
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:34,820
Is that fair?

3739
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:42,320
Oh, just because I suck up my ego to go fucking healer.

3740
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:45,720
They just want you to heal.

3741
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:49,020
Loki doki strikes again.

3742
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:51,440
I can't believe it.

3743
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:53,920
Loki doki is real.

3744
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:58,380
We lost our fucking other player.

3745
02:06:59,180 --> 02:07:00,060
I'm so sorry.

3746
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:02,140
I can't believe it.

3747
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,200
Oh my god.

3748
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:06,080
I can't believe it.

3749
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:11,320
Born.

3750
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:14,900
Wanting to play DPS.

3751
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:16,360
Born to be Loki.

3752
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:18,840
It just is.

3753
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:21,360
Bro, what the fuck Starlord?

3754
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,260
What the fuck?

3755
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:28,180
Holy shi- What the fuck?

3756
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:28,760
Okay.

3757
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:30,040
Oh, fuck.

3758
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:30,860
Okay, bro.

3759
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:31,140
Okay.

3760
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:33,660
I'm like so disoriented right now.

3761
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:36,780
There's like way too much stuff going on.

3762
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:39,520
I don't like this map.

3763
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,640
I am ready to put on a show.

3764
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:44,860
Oh no.

3765
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:45,400
Oh no.

3766
02:07:45,460 --> 02:07:46,060
It's Zenon!

3767
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:48,620
Oh no.

3768
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:51,600
Oh no.

3769
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:51,740
Oh no.

3770
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:52,460
He's so fucked.

3771
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:53,980
I'm so fucked.

3772
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:54,300
Oh!

3773
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:56,860
That's fucking right.

3774
02:07:56,860 --> 02:07:57,200
Oh!

3775
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:58,360
Oh!

3776
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:00,460
Wait a minute.

3777
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:00,680
Wait.

3778
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:01,640
That's actually...

3779
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:03,120
Oh my god.

3780
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:04,000
Wait a minute.

3781
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:05,700
That's actually so sick.

3782
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:06,840
What I just did.

3783
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:07,800
Okay.

3784
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,380
That was pretty sick.

3785
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:14,080
I outplayed him so hard.

3786
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:15,160
New Loki tech.

3787
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:17,960
New fucking Loki tech, guys.

3788
02:08:19,700 --> 02:08:20,300
Outplayed.

3789
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:24,480
Actual Loki tech right there.

3790
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:26,400
Okay.

3791
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:26,980
Let's see.

3792
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:29,160
Alright.

3793
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:30,600
Alright.

3794
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:31,740
I need a shape shift soon.

3795
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:32,720
Wait.

3796
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:33,140
Is that Hela?

3797
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:35,080
My turn finally!

3798
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:36,760
Finally!

3799
02:08:38,860 --> 02:08:40,900
Guys, sorry for no heals.

3800
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:41,760
But this is important.

3801
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:43,920
Wait.

3802
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:44,560
Why can't I Q?

3803
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:46,360
Wait.

3804
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:46,820
Where am I?

3805
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:48,280
Guys, I'm sorry.

3806
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:52,620
Guys, bring them here!

3807
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:54,120
Bring them here!

3808
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:55,960
Bring them here!

3809
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:58,660
Bring them here!

3810
02:08:58,660 --> 02:08:58,780
Okay.

3811
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:00,200
That was...

3812
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:01,380
unlucky there.

3813
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:03,800
That was actually very unlucky.

3814
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:06,300
Nice!

3815
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:09,460
It was a mistake!

3816
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:10,060
It was a mistake!

3817
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:10,460
Okay.

3818
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,000
Okay.

3819
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:13,200
We have two Lokis now.

3820
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:18,200
That was like the most unlucky Loki Loki all I've ever done.

3821
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:20,920
Wait.

3822
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:21,600
Where's the...

3823
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,000
I see the Scarlet Witch.

3824
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:24,620
Okay.

3825
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:26,300
Star-Lord get healed.

3826
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:26,940
Star-Lord.

3827
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:29,120
Oh my god.

3828
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:31,240
Oh.

3829
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:31,680
Please.

3830
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:33,620
Scarlet, your fucking movement though.

3831
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:36,760
Your fucking movement.

3832
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:37,860
Alright.

3833
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:38,300
Nice.

3834
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:40,940
We're doing our job.

3835
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:42,220
Alright.

3836
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:43,280
Star-Lord's fucking dead.

3837
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:45,700
He's so fucking dead.

3838
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:46,540
Don't worry.

3839
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:47,760
I got you.

3840
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:50,780
For Mutant Kind!

3841
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:53,800
Where is that?

3842
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:55,600
What the fuck?

3843
02:09:57,320 --> 02:09:57,960
Oh shit!

3844
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:00,860
Oh fuck!

3845
02:10:00,940 --> 02:10:01,500
Oh thank god!

3846
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,300
Thank god for the world!

3847
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:04,960
It's okay.

3848
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,400
No!

3849
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:08,800
No!

3850
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:08,980
No!

3851
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:09,100
No!

3852
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:09,160
No!

3853
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:09,260
No!

3854
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:09,260
No!

3855
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:09,760
No!

3856
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:09,820
No!

3857
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:09,820
No!

3858
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:09,840
No!

3859
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:09,900
No!

3860
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:09,900
No!

3861
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:10,080
No!

3862
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:10,080
No!

3863
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:10,080
No!

3864
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:10,120
No!

3865
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:10,120
No!

3866
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:10,120
No!

3867
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:10,120
No!

3868
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:10,500
No!

3869
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:10,560
No!

3870
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:10,560
No!

3871
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:11,240
No!

3872
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:11,660
Wait!

3873
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:12,940
I'm kidding!

3874
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:15,320
Holy shit!

3875
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:19,720
I actually gave so hard!

3876
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:20,240
There!

3877
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:22,580
Oh my god!

3878
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:26,340
Bro, I'm... I know so much Loki tech!

3879
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:28,400
Oh god.

3880
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:28,720
Whoops.

3881
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:30,060
Maybe...

3882
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,440
Yeah, there we go.

3883
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:33,280
Alright.

3884
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:33,660
Nice.

3885
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:35,840
Oh my god.

3886
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:37,480
I'm actually a Loki player.

3887
02:10:37,820 --> 02:10:38,300
Wait.

3888
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:38,720
Actually.

3889
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,420
Somebody fucking nerfed me.

3890
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:43,920
Oh my god.

3891
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:45,680
Somebody fucking nerfed me.

3892
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:47,800
I'm actually insane at this.

3893
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:49,580
Alright.

3894
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:52,100
I'm gonna heal our players real fast.

3895
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:53,780
And then...

3896
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:55,360
I'm gonna go up.

3897
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:56,760
Yeah!

3898
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:57,780
Oh my god!

3899
02:10:57,780 --> 02:10:59,560
The fucking atorrent though.

3900
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:03,580
What the fuck?!

3901
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:05,320
Oh my god!

3902
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:05,820
Okay.

3903
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:08,320
It's okay.

3904
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:08,700
I got it.

3905
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:09,700
Don't worry.

3906
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:11,220
I'm DPS now.

3907
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,440
Don't worry.

3908
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:12,440
I'm DPS now.

3909
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:13,040
Okay.

3910
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:13,960
Oh, rocket's low!

3911
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:16,380
We're fine.

3912
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:18,340
We're fine.

3913
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:19,860
Bro, no.

3914
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:21,540
Loki is 100% getting nerfed.

3915
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:22,180
There's no way.

3916
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:23,380
There's no way.

3917
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,660
His DPS is...

3918
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:26,480
Like, his damage is insane.

3919
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:29,260
And like, his cooldowns are so short.

3920
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:32,100
There's no way they're making Loki like this out of alpha.

3921
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:33,380
It's too good.

3922
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:38,440
It's actually...

3923
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:38,700
It's actually...

3924
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:40,660
Yeah, and with rocket too.

3925
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:42,820
I think Loki and rocket is just way too good.

3926
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:46,960
Top 500 Loki main.

3927
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:47,800
By the way.

3928
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:49,900
He has too many tools!

3929
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:56,240
And he's like so disorienting cause like I can like swap between posi- Like, I can swap between Lokis.

3930
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:57,480
If I get like dive.

3931
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:00,380
He's gonna get guided.

3932
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:03,040
That's me.

3933
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:05,300
Loki and Hulk.

3934
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:12,640
Oh yeah, if you know the Hulk- Okay, if you were here earlier, and you saw that fucking Hulk player doing the fucking Hulk move- rollouts.

3935
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:13,740
It was insane.

3936
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:16,260
He was like jumping everywhere and sliding.

3937
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:17,160
He was like Doomfist.

3938
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:19,400
Doomfist rollouts there.

3939
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:22,500
I know.

3940
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:25,900
Actual top 500 Loki main.

3941
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:27,780
Can't wait to play Rank soon.

3942
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:29,700
Rank comes out soon apparently.

3943
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:34,040
Like in like a couple- I think like today?

3944
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:34,440
Tomorrow?

3945
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:35,980
I don't remember when it's coming out.

3946
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:36,920
But it's coming out soon.

3947
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:39,340
Don't worry, I gotchu.

3948
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:41,000
I gotchu.

3949
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:43,100
I gotchu.

3950
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:45,460
Oh shit, okay.

3951
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:47,960
No, that's not what I- No, I'm fu- What?

3952
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:50,600
Okay, I actually- No!

3953
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:53,120
Wait, what is my ult?

3954
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:55,820
What is my ult?

3955
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:57,340
I don't even know what my ult is.

3956
02:12:57,640 --> 02:12:58,700
I hate Bandito!

3957
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:02,840
No, they freeze me.

3958
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:05,960
The Luna girl, if she hits her right click, freezes you.

3959
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:08,700
If she hits her right click, freezes you.

3960
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:09,120
I hate it.

3961
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:11,980
Click.

3962
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:16,300
Yeah, the Luna character freezes you if she hits it.

3963
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:16,400
Yeah, the Luna character freezes you if she hits it.

3964
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:17,120
And I always get hit.

3965
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:19,260
I'm just so bad at tank.

3966
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:21,780
I was never meant to be a tank player.

3967
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,440
Unless it's like a damage tank.

3968
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:23,880
Unless it's like a damage tank.

3969
02:13:25,860 --> 02:13:28,280
I just cannot play tank at all.

3970
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:32,920
I just can't.

3971
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:36,580
I was never meant to be a tank player.

3972
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:37,520
I was never meant to be a tank player.

3973
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:40,820
I have to go DPS support.

3974
02:13:41,640 --> 02:13:42,100
I feel.

3975
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:44,100
There you go.

3976
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:45,220
How is she still alive?

3977
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:46,360
Rocket, shoot him!

3978
02:13:47,820 --> 02:13:48,420
Bear dog!

3979
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:51,860
Come on, bear dog!

3980
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:53,760
Oh god, we gotta heal.

3981
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,180
We gotta heal dragon hell.

3982
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:56,700
Okay, I got you.

3983
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:57,680
I got you, Magneto.

3984
02:13:58,980 --> 02:13:59,380
Nice.

3985
02:14:00,220 --> 02:14:01,320
Are we capping?

3986
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:02,100
We are, right?

3987
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:02,500
Yeah, we are.

3988
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:03,300
Nice.

3989
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:05,680
Oh my god.

3990
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:07,200
He's so short.

3991
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:11,500
It makes me wonder about hitboxes, you know?

3992
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:16,420
Because the hitboxes must be for rockets.

3993
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,940
He's so fucking tight.

3994
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:22,300
Wait a minute.

3995
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:26,400
Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm getting hit by somebody else.

3996
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:30,180
That's not what I wanted!

3997
02:14:35,860 --> 02:14:37,180
No, did we get our control back?

3998
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:39,980
Okay, it's fine.

3999
02:14:41,620 --> 02:14:42,080
It's fine.

4000
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:43,320
I got you.

4001
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:45,360
I got you, dragon hell!

4002
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:47,460
We got, yeah, we got it.

4003
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:48,020
Okay, nice.

4004
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:50,720
Oh no, she's gonna dance.

4005
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:52,300
She's dancing, guys!

4006
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:54,180
Guys, she's dancing!

4007
02:14:57,700 --> 02:14:59,180
Oh, scarlet witch.

4008
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:00,320
Okay, it's scarlet witch.

4009
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:02,380
I did not mean to be scarlet witch, but okay.

4010
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:03,220
Okay.

4011
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:04,660
Alright, I hope I'm gonna kill her.

4012
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:05,620
That's all I...

4013
02:15:07,720 --> 02:15:09,580
Alright, I'm DPS now!

4014
02:15:10,340 --> 02:15:10,980
Let's go!

4015
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:12,520
Nice!

4016
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:14,620
I'm Scarlet Witch now.

4017
02:15:16,420 --> 02:15:17,240
Alright, nice.

4018
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:18,960
We're good.

4019
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:21,840
Oh no, my one weakness.

4020
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:23,860
Okay, we're doing it.

4021
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:24,900
It's like pretty close.

4022
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:26,140
Nevermind, it's not.

4023
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:29,800
I'm just gonna put one guy up here for him.

4024
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:31,820
Alright, that... he's like gonna face tank for...

4025
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:34,260
It's fine.

4026
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:36,740
It's fine.

4027
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:38,760
If I just keep shooting here, I can kill him.

4028
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:40,480
Oh my god, yeah.

4029
02:15:41,480 --> 02:15:42,700
I just shoot through the stairs.

4030
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:44,180
Oh no, no!

4031
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:45,860
Dragon Head!

4032
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,300
Oh god, oh!

4033
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:50,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

4034
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:51,120
He doesn't know, he doesn't know!

4035
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:52,660
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know!

4036
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:54,920
They don't know, they don't know I'm here!

4037
02:15:57,980 --> 02:15:59,000
They don't know.

4038
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:00,520
They don't know.

4039
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:02,100
It's okay.

4040
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:05,400
It's okay, they don't know I'm here.

4041
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:16,200
They don't know though!

4042
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:18,900
They don't know I'm here!

4043
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:23,580
Oh shit, oh shit!

4044
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:26,060
Okay, no, no, no!

4045
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:28,780
Okay, 1v1 me.

4046
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,660
That's fucking right.

4047
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:31,300
No, no, no, no, don't 1v1 me.

4048
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:32,340
Oh yeah, that's fucking right.

4049
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:33,180
1v1 me.

4050
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:34,840
That's right, Scarlet.

4051
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:36,020
Oh, that's right!

4052
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:37,580
I'm better!

4053
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:43,920
That's a good ride, Scarlet!

4054
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:46,840
They might know now.

4055
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:53,100
The clone of me.

4056
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:55,580
I'm... that's cheating!

4057
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,680
I baited him so hard.

4058
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:00,140
1v1 with clones.

4059
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:03,240
Healer, by the way.

4060
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:04,880
Yeah, I'm not surprised this guy got MVP.

4061
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:07,580
He literally had like the ace tag.

4062
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:11,140
I don't know what that means though.

4063
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:12,260
Like that tag they had.

4064
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:14,400
I received an output from Roger!

4065
02:17:14,940 --> 02:17:16,560
Guys, upload me, I'm important!

4066
02:17:17,460 --> 02:17:19,360
I mean, I guess he deserves it though.

4067
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:20,140
How much did I do?

4068
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:22,140
Damage!

4069
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:24,940
Oh my god, that guy got 10k damage.

4070
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:27,100
Holy shit!

4071
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:28,920
11k!

4072
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:30,620
Oh my god!

4073
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:33,120
That man got 11k damage.

4074
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,400
Wait, is competitive out yet?

4075
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:36,560
It's not.

4076
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:38,860
That was really fun though.

4077
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:41,420
I had like... such a fun time.

4078
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:43,260
Season...

4079
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,740
Embark on missions...

4080
02:17:45,740 --> 02:17:46,780
Where are the costumes?

4081
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:48,880
Green Scar...

4082
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:51,900
What is the battle pass like?

4083
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:52,940
I'm actually curious.

4084
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:55,620
Unlock at 24, unlock at level 30.

4085
02:17:56,260 --> 02:17:57,300
What about missions?

4086
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:59,400
That was really fun though!

4087
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:01,400
Oh my god!

4088
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:05,340
I actually had a lot of fun playing this.

4089
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:07,900
I actually had like actually a fucking...

4090
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:10,660
There's gonna be like tournaments and stuff.

4091
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:11,500
Factions?

4092
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:13,840
Create a join and super healer team.

4093
02:18:14,460 --> 02:18:15,060
Cosmetic...

4094
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:16,000
Oh, President Loki.

4095
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,860
Guys, you can now spend money already.

4096
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,380
Isn't that fucking crazy?

4097
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:21,080
You can actually...

4098
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:23,960
You can spend cosmetic money.

4099
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:26,780
I had so much fun!

4100
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:28,280
I might play this more off stream.

4101
02:18:28,420 --> 02:18:28,900
Not gonna lie.

4102
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:31,620
But like this actually has been like...

4103
02:18:31,620 --> 02:18:32,180
I don't know.

4104
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:35,800
I've been having a really fun time so far.

4105
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:39,500
Playing the alpha test.

4106
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:40,820
Like that's what I like.

4107
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:43,080
It just looks really fun.

4108
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:48,640
And I actually did have a lot of fun playing solos in general.

4109
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,520
I think like when it does get more...

4110
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:51,920
I think like at the UI...

4111
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:54,060
At the UI and like the...

4112
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:56,400
The visual effects.

4113
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:57,820
When you're fighting changes.

4114
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:00,160
Like it's more refined.

4115
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:01,740
I think it'll look a lot better.

4116
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:03,740
But I honestly when you're playing it might...

4117
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:06,140
Visually might not be like super polished yet.

4118
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:07,180
I mean it is alpha.

4119
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:10,200
But all I care about is like I have fun.

4120
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:10,660
You know?

4121
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:14,260
Yeah.

4122
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:16,160
Like I had a lot of fun.

4123
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:16,760
I really did.

4124
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:18,220
And like the...

4125
02:19:18,220 --> 02:19:19,280
I like the tech.

4126
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:21,220
I like the tech for like the characters.

4127
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:25,080
And it's super...

4128
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:26,260
It seems really complicated.

4129
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:29,020
If you know like more of the fucking movement tech and stuff.

4130
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:30,340
And like all the...

4131
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:33,320
Like the shit I was doing on Loki.

4132
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:37,540
Like the fucking juke shit with the clones and stuff.

4133
02:19:37,740 --> 02:19:39,060
Was fucking crazy.

4134
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:43,780
Like it forces the person to like 180 turn around.

4135
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,300
When I fucking snap my finger.

4136
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:52,120
Yeah I hope it does stay around long.

4137
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:53,500
Because you know.

4138
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:54,640
Rest in peace Gundam Evolution.

4139
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:56,640
That shit died out really fast.

4140
02:19:56,880 --> 02:20:00,660
But honestly I hope Marvel Rivals does stay around long.

4141
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:02,600
And that a lot of this shit gets more polished.

4142
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:06,060
Because I honestly think it does seem like a really fun game.

4143
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:10,860
And I think like the more time and development is put into it.

4144
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:14,500
It might actually be a very very good game.

4145
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:16,100
Bite size.

4146
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:16,940
Thank you for the super chat.

4147
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:17,240
Thank you.

4148
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:17,660
Thank you.

4149
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:19,700
Thanks for the stream Lokibert.

4150
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:21,180
Thank you guys.

4151
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:22,620
I hope you guys enjoyed watching.

4152
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:23,920
I definitely...

4153
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:24,960
I'm doing a try and play.

4154
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:26,520
I'm going to play this more off stream for sure.

4155
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:29,160
Because like it's definitely super enjoyable.

4156
02:20:29,460 --> 02:20:30,000
Hey guys.

4157
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,980
As always I'm going to call it here.

4158
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:34,280
As always everybody stay hydrated.

4159
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:35,140
Posture check.

4160
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:36,080
Get up and move around.

4161
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:37,640
Wait.

4162
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,260
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

4163
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:41,120
I almost forgot my line.

4164
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:43,640
And if you stayed up for me.

4165
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:44,500
Head to bed.

4166
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:45,620
Because you deserve it.

4167
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:46,740
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4168
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:47,980
Bye guys.

4169
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:48,900
Bye.
