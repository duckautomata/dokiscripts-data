This journey was long, but we've made it.

25
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,170
I Mean technically it wasn't that long.

26
00:05:47,290 --> 00:06:10,590
It was like not even a year That we made it like we literally sped run a whole tire of youtuber career within less than a year and like in 2025 I'm definitely gonna slow down a little bit just a little bit I'll slow down because I crammed so many things within 24 because I was like,

27
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:19,830
oh man What if What if like, you know in 205 I won't get the same opportunities again So then I was like, I won't do this.

28
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,750
I wonder that I would do all of this Every single one of these things.

29
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,930
I want to do it and then now now I'm like, okay 25 I should chill a little bit.

31
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,970
So it's gonna be Slowing down, but also not really slowing down.

32
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,410
I'm gonna try and slow down.

33
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,790

35
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:27,790
I haven't really thought about the plans for WrestleTuber At the moment but I mean there's still a long way to go I'm gonna make it around the same time as always like around the same month as always so like You can like know exactly when to expect it.

36
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,810

39
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:45,990
I had a lot of trouble deciding what to do for the announcement because like The announcement itself is at 7 and I was like, what the fuck do I do?

40
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:56,150
We were like, oh, you know, they would have like karaoke's and like stuff like that for special streams But I'm like, I don't know what to do.

41
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,050
I'm just gonna I Guess I'm just gonna be here.

42
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:11,430
I Thought it'd be fun to do like some Some like voice requests like cameos and stuff like live cameo You'll be like I want you to do this.

43
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:31,170
I'll be like, alright, you know I sound a little fucked up at the moment, but I'm gonna rest my throat tomorrow So, um, I'm I'm sorry that basically this entire week has basically been Marvel Rivals Marvel Rivals plus this

44
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,400
I'm so sorry.

45
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,280
This has been it's like apex week.

46
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,320
But now now it's Marvel Rivals week

47
00:08:46,500 --> 00:09:36,840
But at least you saw like my clown arc it was like people were like this is like I found it funny that we basically made a Trilogy of sorts so it was like So we basically had like a trilogy of a journey from like happiness the first movie was happiness with a little despair and then descend and then slowly descending into madness and Then and then and then madness then depression Then my joker arc then full-on fucking hate and then and then we got it And then the raid boss and then we got it No,

48
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,340
thank you.

49
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,920
Thank you for the super chat.

50
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,140
Thank you.

51
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,400
Thank you Top 100 for 2025 No, no, I just want to end at top 500.

52
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,280
I don't really care.

53
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,960
I won't rank.

54
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,780
I just wanted to be like Top 100.

55
00:09:48,980 --> 00:10:30,040
It's gonna be very difficult, especially when uh The hardest part the hardest thing that i'm most worried about is the fact that um You know like every day people are figuring out new meta and new tech And then we all have to basically learn something new Every day I have to learn Something new every day while playing because they're coming up with new strategies because nothing is established yet Nothing is fully established in the grand scheme of things So I'm like so like that's the most difficult part because it's obviously it's gonna get harder It's gonna get a lot harder the more the more days pass.

56
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:38,640
So I think um Um, so I think like That's it's gonna be very difficult.

57
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,360
So like top ending top 500.

58
00:10:41,360 --> 00:11:06,280
I think it's possible But I think it's definitely possible especially if I like keep playing Almost every like I don't have to play every day because I won't be able to play in the next three days Which sucks because you know, everybody's climbing in the next three days every day because I have to play catch up I might play a little bit more off stream today Um after i'm done with my work just so I don't have to play do too much catch up I want to make sure that like,

59
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:40,640
you know, I don't have to do too much catch up when it comes to the lobbies and um And like um, and then like I don't have to worry about grinding like a hell a lot Um after three days has passed because I feel like I feel like Just like overwatch 2 when overwatch 2 first came out top 500 was literally grandmaster 1 Which was like the highest rank you could possibly get and then um And then I feel like in marvel rivals I feel like there is gonna be like,

60
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:53,640
you know, I feel like uh They're gonna have it's gonna be like There's not it's gonna be like the toppest ranks of marvel rivals like grandmaster, what was the grand it wasn't grandmaster It was like the next one.

61
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,120
I don't remember.

62
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,740
I don't remember the tier above grandmaster but I don't even know when the season ends too.

63
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,240
That's the biggest worry I have I don't know what the season the lat the when it's ending.

64
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,920
So If it's really long we're fucked Ha ha ha

65
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:25,020
We're so fucked if it's a very long season So, oh, is it the end of december Oh, it's 20 more days.

66
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,220
Okay, that's doable.

67
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,160
That's actually really doable I'll just not have anything to do after the call.

68
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,500
I'll just play after the concert Um people like rest don't play.

69
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,740
Well playing marvel rivals is my rest not gonna lie Because like I really enjoy the game.

70
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:51,060
I actually like i'm so addicted to marvel rivals It makes it reminds me of when I first started playing overwatch um, and how fucking Addicted I was where I would spend.

71
00:12:51,480 --> 00:13:05,620
Um Um 12 plus hours playing every day because I just I love the game so much and that's how I feel right now Because everybody's actually trying to Because they're not depressed yet

72
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,360
They're They're not depressed yet And like pessimistic about life and about the game.

73
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:32,500
Everyone's hopeful and happy And like willing to work together So they're not depressed yet So like things are looking bright and shiny and then later on the honeymoon phase is gonna It's gonna come in and then things are gonna get worse.

74
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:47,360
So like i'm enjoying The honeymoon phase right now of all the players that are in my lobby because everyone's happy at the moment in the higher elo I feel like I feel like the top 500 players.

75
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,780
Everyone's very happy right now So so i'm enjoying that before it's gone.

76
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,540
Um Oh, yeah, um momo.

77
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:57,800

83
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,380
Oh my gosh.

84
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,340
Hello latino latino dragoons.

85
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,620
Hello.

86
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:30,800
Hello Honestly, any type of support means so much because I invest a lot of it back into my own channel back into you guys So thank you so much.

87
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:37,400
I really appreciate it because I know that's a lot for your own currency So I really appreciate that for the support.

88
00:14:37,600 --> 00:15:03,440
Um, speaking of like, um speaking of like, um Latinos, I love latinos Um, um, my management team is actually trying to look into like conventions in south america Um and like other places that we haven't gone to yet So let's hope that next year we can get something um Next year in 2025.

89
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,900
I hope we do.

90
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,800
I'd love to see some of my uh, Latino dragoons down there too.

91
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:36,700
Um, so it'll be pretty cool if we can honestly, I don't know how it'll work because I feel like especially like you know I feel like it might be a little difficult just because you know, um, I don't know vtubers are popular in south america So or like just for for like english-speaking vtubers too in general So like I hope that I hope I hope they I hope we can get something Um,

92
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:49,420
it's mostly about like them requesting me because we get a lot of convention requests and we mostly I mostly say yes To a majority of them because it's like, you know, it gives me an opportunity to speak to you guys and everything.

93
00:15:49,820 --> 00:16:13,060
Um, so um But this is the first time we actually are requesting to like trying to see if we can get a convention um in South america by us like approaching some so it will if you guys really want me to see me in south america Encourage your conventions to like email me and then like we can like negotiate something with them,

94
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,560
too So yeah, I love meaning I don't like a lot of vtubers too.

95
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:31,140
Don't really um, it's really difficult difficult for indie vtubers, too Um to like do like conventions and stuff like that because like, you know, a lot of conventions tend to just look at like a corporate side Um, because it's easier to gather people on the corporate side.

96
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:50,380
Um, but like, um i'm trying my best to like Uh, so like it's like it's like I feel really fortunate that a lot of conventions approach me Especially those that are like not just centric to vtubers ask me to come to you know Come to meet some of my fans there too.

97
00:16:50,560 --> 00:17:12,220
So I really appreciate that and um, And it it's you know, obviously I don't want to take things for granted and stuff So I always try my best to do as many as I can Because you know, it's a great opportunity to see some of you guys Down there to see all the support and you guys can make some new friends with other dragons and everything too And then like,

98
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:32,560
you know buy some doki merch too there and support like local artists, um at your convention that draw me um And so it's like it's always like really cool to uh, um It's always really cool to be able to do that and have the opportunity because I know a lot of indies Don't really have that opportunity.

99
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:50,220
So i'm trying to I don't want to take it for granted or anything So, um, that's why I always try to do as much as I can and I think it also helps me a lot as well, it's like a Um, it's like, you know, it's a give and take too So like, um i'm putting myself out there for people who might not know who I am and they see this giant screen of an anime girl and Be like,

100
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,060
who the fuck is that girl?

101
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,760
And I was like, that's me.

102
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,140
I'm doki.

I actually thought I would get an android.

248
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:51,980
So the fact that You know Especially because it's really rare for indies to have this opportunity like you can you can count your on one hand I think it's one hand one, two, three, four or five one or two hands one to two hands Because I might be missing so because I know there's like,

249
00:34:52,100 --> 00:35:22,480
you know There's also indies from like not just like english indies But like I know there's some indies in jp or like in asia that also got nendoroids too but I think like in general it's very um rare to see an indie vtuber um Get an android so I want to say thank you guys so much uh for the support and For allowing me to be able to you know Get something that I never expect to ever have to own Or half of me,

250
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:41,600

00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,340
Wait, what do you have an avatar?

256
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,020
And then okay, it's been a while since I collected nendoroids.

257
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,800
Oh my god.

258
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:08,880

259
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:24,140
Um um But um, yeah, thank you guys so much Uh, sorry, I got distracted because I was like, whoa the avatar has nendoroids now

260
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:45,680
Um I think it was more so production too so because they I didn't know how many they have to make how many they have to make and then uh, And then they'll like they'll ship out the amount and stuff because I know pre-order dates It's usually around that long if it just came out like,

261
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,660
uh, have you ever ordered nendoroids before?

262
00:36:47,660 --> 00:37:07,020
from like really the release statement to like when Um when it starts shipping them Um, they usually take around that long because they got it's like production time, especially nendoroids I know because I know because I used to chase after Nendoroid releases for in asia.

263
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:13,060
Your nendoroid will release on august 2025 Guys okay.

264
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,260
Here's the plan.

265
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,620
Here's the plan.

266
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:41,200
Um You buy one for in asia and then you buy one in na and then you race to see You know you get you get the display one from na You order one from na for the display and then you order this the first one in the one you want now From asia and then like so you can use it now.

267
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,440
Okay.

268
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:41,820
Okay.

269
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,360
That's such a terrible wording Why did I say that?

270
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,660
Um, so you can have it sooner, but it's not the display one.

271
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,540
It's not the display

272
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:02,160
And then and then you'll have two or maybe three or make your own collect make an army of croquis and tomatoes

273
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:16,480
Isn't that fun Isn't that Is that fun a collection of croquis and tomatoes this tiny little fucking croquis over there

274
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:28,780
Your own little croquis army, yeah I was so happy that they were able to make croquis and the tomato because they're like What kind of accessories do you want?

275
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:49,920
And I was like I want I I honestly I I didn't expect them to be Because like, you know, you're so limited With I thought i'd be more limited with what I can have Because like there's some nendoroids where there's like nothing, you know I I didn't realize I was so free to have so many things because I know like,

276
00:38:50,080 --> 00:39:15,540
you know some nendoroids You just have like, you know One or two like hand pieces And then like expressions and then that's it But then I got to even have like because when I was like, I have croquis and tomato and they're like Yeah, of course you can and I was so surprised because like I thought they would sacrifice like hand pieces for it But then I also have like the hard hands hand piece too for my nendoroid So I was like,

277
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,080
I was really happy about that, too.

278
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:36,680
So You know, there's a lot of variety and also like, you know the dragoon as well So i'm glad that my I know like these accessories are not universal type deal As in like you can't have it you can't like, you know use it for other nendoroids I guess because like what contest that doesn't make sense in any context,

279
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:57,180
you know, so It doesn't it doesn't it doesn't make much sense, you know my accessories and stuff like that Um, but like but that's why it's unique because it works for me Because because it's it's like a doki bird Um, it's like a doki bird nendoroid It won't come out till 2026.

280
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,100
Well, if you buy if you're if you live in asia, it comes out in august

281
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:22,080
Yeah I think it's also shipment because they have to ship it to the states And then then in the states that they ship it to you guys So like because they have to order it from the to the states, but you live in asia It comes back it comes from japan, obviously.

282
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:30,140
So, um So it's quicker because of that because it's easier it like the shipment is Easier too.

283
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:42,100
So like, um, if you're in asia and you got a friend in the states If you have if you have a friend in the states, you know help help a dragoon out

284
00:40:45,440 --> 00:41:01,540
How long is the pre-order window that's a very good question let me check Oh, yeah The canada post strike is really bad right now as in like what do you mean by really bad?

285
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,300
um we they said that It doesn't look like it's gonna end anytime soon.

286
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,060
So And then they suspended the u.s.

287
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,120
The u.s.

288
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:35,640
Post office suspended sending things to us Because they're like what the the state the american post office is like what the fuck is going on And they're like we have so much backlog to canada, but we can't do anything about it So now they suspended all services From to canadians and also like what's it called?

289
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:44,300

309
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:38,040
Due to recent events Wait, what happened?

310
00:44:38,200 --> 00:45:02,180
Well, they like they they like shut down itch.io because like um Via like an ai bot shut down itch.io because it basically Shuts down ips of like things that are like, you know harms the trademark Um, but because it's an ai Um, it just automatic did that and it was and then so So that's what happened.

311
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:20,600
And then um, obviously itch.io was like the fuck and it's back now itch.io is back It took 24 hours And then the thing is because he's the owner you can say what the fuck he wants So then apparently funko pop called his mom And then his mom was like what the fuck?

312
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,520
Why did they call?

313
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,860
Me and then the owner of the site posted it on twitter about it.

314
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,540
So yeah, it's not a lot Yeah, they called him out publicly.

315
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:39,200
So like because you know, they're not governed by anything, you know, they're just like They're just like I could do whatever the fuck I want.

316
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,940
What are they gonna do?

317
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:52,760
I own my own website They like they like they like ran to tell his mom yeah, I Honestly, I thought that too I was like, what is he like 10?

318
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,040
Like why did you snitch on like?

319
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:03,400
He's an adult Why did you fucking why did you call his mom?

I was very surprised with how, how fast they worked in general.

327
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:17,500
Because like, which makes sense because you know when an anime gets like super fucking popular and then they instantly have, they like instantly have something for it.

328
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,680
So like, it like, which makes sense because they're like, you know, they gotta like catch on the hype before it's too late and everything.

329
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:33,780
So they're so, they're stiff, they're like so like, they were, they did this so fast, like I was not expecting everything to go so fast.

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,120
And also for $10?

426
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:28,240
Do you know how much it costs to buy a billboard at the New York... The New... Was it the New York Times Square?

427
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,220
Do you guys know how much that is?

428
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:36,200
You think... You think an ad space for that much is $10?

429
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,040
I am practically the New York Times Square right now.

430
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:49,160
Like if you look out on the street and you see 2,000 people at the New York Times Square, like that's me.

431
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,000
I don't know how much it is either, but like I know it's not fucking $10.

432
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,880
Okay, how about $11 then, Doki?

433
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,360
Oh my god, I... You know what?

434
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,520
No, I'm even better than the New York Times Square.

435
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:14,780
I'm the fucking sphere in Las Vegas right now because I can interact with you guys.

436
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,840
I'm almost 3D on Saturday.

437
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,340
I'm almost 3D on Saturday.

438
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,420
Um, various...

439
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

440
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,760
Would you do it for a scooby snack?

441
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,980
Would you do it for a rink roink?

442
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,020
What about a rink roink?

443
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,060
Oh my god, wait, was it $50,000?

444
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,940
Oh my god, what am I at?

445
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,140
$90.

446
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,360
Thank you for the magenta soup, Various.

447
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,600
Thank you, thank you.

448
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,620
Um, I really appreciate it.

449
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,920
Oh my god, John, the only one that's here for the actual streaming part.

450
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,780
Uh, John, thank you for the super chat.

451
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,820
Thank you, thank you.

452
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,380
Uh, I have a simple voice request.

453
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,140
I love you, dragons.

454
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,120
There.

455
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,640
I love you, dragons.

456
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:27,800
You guys deserve that because without your support, I wouldn't be able to, you know, get my nendoroid because, you know, they see how passionate you guys are and how... how much love you give me that, like, I was given an opportunity to get a nendoroid.

457
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,040
Oh my god, this is so dumb.

458
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,220
Look, I'm... I'm looking at myself right now.

459
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,060
Um, and... and this is...

460
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,400
I'm not a person anymore.

461
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,440
I'm just... I am the New York Times Square.

462
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,460
Um, Mr. Sam, thank you for the Akasupa.

463
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,620
Thank you, thank you.

464
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,320
That's going up.

465
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,240
Will you do it for $200?

466
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,560
Okay, what was it?

467
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,220
All right, that buys you, like, five minutes on the Doki Times Square.

468
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,380
Um, I am...

469
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,660
I'll give you five minutes on the Doki Times Square.

470
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:26,760
Okay, you're lucky that, um, that... and that's me being generous right now.

471
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,000
I'm... I'm being generous for you guys.

472
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,240
All right, give me a sec, export.

473
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,420
Bro, I'm creating a new meta.

474
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,640
Someone's gonna steal this idea and then, like, use it.

475
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,100
Or maybe it's already been used.

476
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,820
I feel like a lot of things have already been done for, um, in the vtubing sphere.

477
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,880
So maybe somebody's already done that for, like, a subathon or some shit or a donathon.

478
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:57,260
I'll never... for those who are wondering, I'll never do a donathon or a subathon because I personally have enough support from you guys.

479
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,740
Um, overall that...

480
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,980
I don't have to do something like that, which I really appreciate.

481
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:03,880
I'm very fortunate.

482
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:19,580
I'm really fortunate to be in the place where I personally don't have to do a subathon slash donathon because your support is more than enough, um, that, uh, that I'm able to not have to do... do any of them.

483
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:40,660
And honestly, like, they can, like, fuck you up, fuck your body up a lot and your voice because, like, um, you know, I don't have, like, you know, like, they're... they're, like, a long-term commitment and, um, and, like, because, you know, you always have to be,

484
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,860
like, you have to stream every day without a break basically.

485
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:50,840
And some people do, like, uncapped subathons and, like, uncapped subathons and, like, donathons and stuff like that.

486
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,980
So, like, I'm very fortunate to be in a place where I don't have to do that.

487
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:02,820
And it's because of you guys' support and everything that I'm able to, like, you know, just stream when I want to stream.

488
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,920
And I do still stream a lot because I always love streaming and everything.

489
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:23,900
Um, so, that's why, like, uh, I personally will never do it just because, like, I don't see a reason to on my end to do it just because, like I said, like, um, I can find a lot of things with your current support at the moment, uh, right now.

490
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,820
I don't know if next year it'll change.

491
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,060
So, but for now, for now, I'm okay.

492
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,120
For now, for now, I'm okay at the moment.

493
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:53,480
Um, and, like, I know, like, for some, like, like, um, but yeah, I'm just, I'm just happy to, I'm just happy to be able to, to be able to, you know, stream for you guys, um, without having to, like, uh, you know, I, I'm, I don't want to fuck up my body even more,

494
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,700
basically, because I already fucked up my voice a little bit.

495
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,500
I, and I'm not aiming for any record or anything.

496
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:14,180
So, like, in terms of, you know, because I know, like, you know, our mouse has done a lot of subathons, um, but she also does it for charity, too, and, um, which is very upstanding for her, and also, like, uh, for, like, the record and everything.

497
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,400
But I didn't hear, I'm not here to break any records here.

498
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:25,980
I'm just here to be me, Dohebird, um, and I, honestly, I don't think I could ever, I could barely do a 24-hour stream.

499
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,540
I don't think I could ever do a 24-hour stream.

500
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:39,890
Oh, did Keso win, win, win the gamer of, what is it, gamer of the year?

501
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:41,890
Honestly, good for him.

502
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:55,330
He, I think he's one of the rare streamers that's, like, um, that's actually, like, super unproblematic.

503
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:57,530
You know?

504
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,670
A con, a content creator.

505
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,550
I know you want, oh, yeah, he won gamer of the year for this stream.

506
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:10,370
He's, like, um, because I watched a bit of Keso, um, and I don't really watch Keso Keso, but I've seen clips of him.

507
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:15,650
Because, like, he started out being, like, the guy you watch to make fun of.

508
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:32,290
But then, it's crazy, because, like, in the beginning of the year, in the beginning of the year, uh, he's, he was, like, just a guy you sort of hate watched, hate watched, or, like, make fun of, because people were always making fun of him.

509
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,050
And then he, like, turned that around.

510
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:42,950
Like, he actually, like, turned that around, and now he has, like, an actual community and fan base that, like, really likes him.

511
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:45,590
And, like, he's actually pretty funny.

512
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,190
Like, he's a pretty funny guy.

513
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,070
Um, so good for him.

514
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:53,690
Be able to turn that around in a year, too.

515
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:59,490
Um, and he seems very unproblematic, because, like, uh, I don't know.

516
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,310
He seems very unproblematic guy.

517
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:09,070
Um, he also does, he's also, like, in his own, in his own bubble a lot, too.

518
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,250
Um, he seems pretty chill.

519
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:12,530
Yeah, I don't really watch him.

520
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:13,330
I've seen his clips.

521
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,450
I watched one of his streams, because he was playing.

522
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,670
I think he was the one that popularized Dressed to Impress.

523
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:21,010
Right?

524
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:22,090
Was it?

525
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:26,710
Yeah, yeah, he was the one that fucking popularized Dressed to Impress.

526
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:28,790
Also, like, shout out to Korra, though.

527
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:37,050
It's, you know, um, huge honor to be, like, um, nominated, too, because, you know, it's, it's such a big thing.

528
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:43,930
Um, but I also think, because, like, the ga- uh, the Game Awards is very, like, NA-focused.

529
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:53,770
So, like, it's a lot harder, because people who don't know what VTube, because, like, VTubing is still a niche in NA, but, like, every normie knows who Keso is, so.

530
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:03,350
So, I feel like it's, it's, like, it, it was, it's definitely, like, a uphill battle for, like, VTubers for that.

531
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:15,610
Um, because, like, uh, especially if it's not, like, not English-speaking VTubers, because, like, the the people, the normies would be, like, obviously, they'll be, like, I know who Keso is, you know, and they'll just vote for him.

532
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,710
I mean, I know, I know who he is, too.

533
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,610
Yeah, but you're, you only know Pokor- yeah, but you're not a normie.

534
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:27,370
You're here.

535
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:34,090
I think I, I must have, like, 10% of, 10%.

536
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,770
The moment, the moment you watch, you might be, like, but, Doki, no.

537
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,370
I'm a normie, too.

538
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,750
No, the moment you start watching my stream, you're no longer a normie.

539
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:47,690
You're no longer, you're, you're no longer a normie.

540
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,190
The moment you're here, because, first off, why are you on YouTube?

541
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,470
Because normies are all hanging out on Twitch.

542
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,670
There's also that.

543
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,270
There's also that, too.

544
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:01,010
Like, all the normies are on Twitch.

545
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,290
Why are you on YouTube?

546
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,490
You already revoked your normie card.

547
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:05,450
You're fucking here.

548
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,150
I hate Twitch.

549
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:09,750
That's right.

550
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:10,890
You're not a normie.

551
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,490
You're not a fucking normie if you hate Twitch.

552
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,770
Bro, what's his name?

553
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,070
That, oh my god.

554
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:30,430
Okay, so, like, I was doing the, the streamer awards, the streamer awards with, with Gumi.

555
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:47,970
Um, I was like, we were, because, like, she called me from the streamer awards, and then, uh, um, and then, um, I wanted to do an interview thing, the red carpet thing, but we got to the, the beat, the beast role of the red carpet interviews.

556
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:52,470
And I felt so, I felt so embarrassed, because I never even shout out my name.

557
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,410
They were like, what are you nominated for?

558
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:55,970
I was like, what do you think I'm nominated for?

559
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,070
Because I'm literally virtual.

560
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,770
I was like, what do you think I'm nominated for?

561
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,450
I don't even remember who the fuck the interviewer was.

562
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:06,490
I know he's, like, an IRL streamer, but, like, I don't remember his name, because I don't watch IRL streamers.

563
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:09,070
Um, because, like I said, I'm not a fucking normie anymore.

564
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:12,730
I, I'm the most normie, non-normie.

565
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:20,710
I would say I'm the most normie, non-normie, because, like, um, I watch a lot of normie stuff, like, big, not Big Bang Theory.

566
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:20,970
Sorry.

567
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:22,530
I, I fucking hate Big Bang Theory.

568
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:24,110
Um, what is it called?

569
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:27,030
Uh, the, the Sheldon one.

570
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,310
Um, god, I already forgot.

571
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,290
Young Sheldon.

572
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,370
I watch Young Sheldon.

573
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,550
I love Young Sheldon.

574
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:33,870
It's such a good show.

575
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,770
Um, but I watch more.

576
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:37,170
I don't watch a lot of anime.

577
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,890
I rarely watch anime and stuff like that.

578
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,190
I love Young Sheldon.

579
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,030
Bazonga.

580
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:46,170
Wait, what?

581
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:47,050
Wait, fuck.

582
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:48,070
What was I talking about?

583
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:54,170
Sorry, I got too conf- I got too, too, like, absorbed into, like, uh, Young Sheldon.

584
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:58,070
Uh, I already forgot where this topic was going.

585
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:02,690
I, I also watch, watch the Boss Baby TV show, too.

586
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,630
Um, oh, yeah, the interview.

587
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:11,150
And then, I was too goomy, because I could see, like, because I was looking at the stream as well.

588
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:22,970
I was like, how the fuck did the, the NPC Miles Morales get a main interview stage, and I- He's not even a nominee!

589
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:35,570
I was just like, they gave, like, Miles Morales NPC a main A-stream interview, and he's not even nominated?

590
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:38,770
Bro, he has to be a plus one!

591
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:46,810
I was just like, I was like, I was like, I'm nominated!

592
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:46,870
I'm nominated!

593
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,200
But, like, he's a nominee.

594
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:57,120
I'm gonna go outside and step on another spider.

595
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,020
Fucking Spider-Man, they're all a problem.

596
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:09,420
Not just Peter- Not just Peter Parker, they're all a fucking problem.

597
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:19,680
No, but the NPC Miles Morales became a Twitch streamer, and he was like, I just started, like, a couple of months ago.

598
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,820
I only knew I just found out about Twitch.

599
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:29,660
Yeah, you didn't, yeah, so like, yeah, so if you're, if you watch on Twitch, you're, you're sort of, like, within the normie sphere and everything.

600
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:34,680
Um, okay, so yeah, that's, that's, that's my rant of the day.

601
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:40,220
That's like- They're all a menace to society.

602
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,180
Somebody stop them.

603
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:48,480
Uh- Oh, yeah, sorry, I was supposed to make an ad, a five-minute ad space.

604
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,780
Oh my, you have, you would have lost your five-minute ad space by now, but you're so lucky.

605
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:58,520
Okay, let me, let me quickly export this real fast.

606
01:06:58,620 --> 01:06:59,560
All right, here we go.

607
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,920
Okay, let me, um- Oop.

608
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,760
Let me disappear real quick, because we're getting ad space.

609
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,740
We're just putting new ad space on here.

610
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,640
I'll just put it on.

611
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:19,440
Whoops.

612
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,720
Oh, no, no, no, whoops.

613
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,880
Oh, no, that's not what I wanted.

614
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,460
Okay, we're gonna lock the movement, because I fucked up.

615
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,180
I'll put it right here.

616
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:35,960
There you go.

617
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:42,160
There's your, we're gonna give you, like, uh, we're gonna give you, like, five minutes of ad space here.

618
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,580
Remember, I'm the jokey Times Square.

619
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,240
I'm the- That small?

620
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:53,460
Wow!

621
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:54,900
Wow!

622
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,600
That, that, yeah, that's right.

623
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:06,780
Oh, you, oh, don't, don't, don't, yeah, don't make me- I like how, like, this person who didn't even pay for it is making me angry, so I'm punishing everybody.

624
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,660
Don't make me punish everyone.

625
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:22,010
All right, five minutes starting now.

626
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,350
44, 142, 43, 44, okay, 44.

627
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:27,090
All right, we're taking it off at, at 44.

628
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:30,810
Um, getting never- best, you guys, you get what you paid for.

629
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:33,390
You get exactly what you paid for, guys.

630
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:38,870
Guys, I can't believe someone was like, that's- Don't fucking test me right now.

631
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:39,730
I own this.

632
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,170
I own this billboard.

633
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:44,490
I own this skill, skin suit.

634
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,750
Don't fucking test me right now.

635
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,430
Don't-

636
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,660
All right, um...

637
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,620
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

638
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,560
Thank you, thank you.

639
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,740
Johnny Lacone.

640
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,080
Uh, Game Dive team rep here.

641
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:04,780
Our audio maestro, Masha, said they would like some pain grunt noises.

642
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,380
Like, you're getting shot up like Doomguy.

643
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,380
Would that be all right with you?

644
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,000
Okay, that's a private thing.

645
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:09,860
Um...

646
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:12,720
Thank you for the super chat.

647
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,640
Thank you, thank you.

648
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,620
You'll get the private files for that.

649
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,520
That's not a lie.

650
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:19,860
I have BGM.

651
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,160
You just do that?

652
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,320
Oh my god.

653
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,900
I have a BGM music playing right now.

654
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,080
Um, Alan, thank you for the super chat.

655
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:31,880
Thank you, thank you.

656
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,180
Okay, in the name of the moon, I'll punish you.

657
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:42,200
All right, that's your- your custom voice pack while I have this on.

658
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,040
Thank you for the super chat.

659
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,060
Thank you, thank you.

660
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,300
You know, that's a steal.

661
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,700
That's actually a steal, you know.

662
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,900
I like how, like, I'm like, here's some custom voice lines.

663
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:57,920
Also, I have BGM playing in the background, but- Good luck with that.

664
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,540
Good luck with separating the audio files for that.

665
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:07,600
I mean, I could have turned the BGM off, but, like, but this is, like, budget voice packs, so, like, you get what you get, so...

666
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:25,880
I'm planning on releasing, because, like, I know, like, it's been done before, a long time ago, but I'd love to do, like, actual custom voice packs again in the future for, like, merch and stuff that comes with, like, a signed wallpaper and stuff like that.

667
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:30,800
So I'm definitely thinking about that in the future because I got the wallpaper and stuff done.

668
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,340
I just don't have the time to actually do it yet.

669
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,700
So, maybe in 2025.

670
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,060
Maybe in 2025.

671
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,200
Marianne, thank you for the super chat.

672
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:40,440
Thank you.

673
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:40,840
Thank you.

674
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,060
Can I, uh, voice request?

675
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:43,920
All right.

676
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,440
Oh, and I'm excited for Saturday.

677
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:46,960
Me too!

678
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:47,880
I'm so excited!

679
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:49,940
Oh my gosh.

680
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,960
Burrito, thank you for the Akasupa.

681
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:52,400
Thank you.

682
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:52,800
Thank you.

683
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:59,720
I just need you guys to know when, um, when I had those custom voice packs out- by the way, that was the price of what it was.

684
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,240
Um, a hundred dollars.

685
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,940
I think I said that, like, three times to people.

686
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:10,440
Like, I had three people separately requested that and I'm, like, sick.

687
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:14,320
That's basically, like, I basically scammed two of them.

688
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,380
No, I'm joking.

689
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,040
I'm joking.

690
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:23,920
They were- I recorded unique ones for each of them, but I'm joking.

691
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:24,980
I'm joking.

692
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:35,920
I- I didn't, like, just send them, like, the same file three times, but I've re- I've, you know, of course, I've made new recordings, but I just thought it was so funny.

693
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:49,360
I thought I thought it was so funny that three people, um, three separate people asked for it, for the limited edition, like, uh, voice packs.

694
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:50,540
Uh...

695
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:57,040
Guys, I'm bad, but not that bad.

696
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,360
Like, I would burn trees, but I would not burn trees.

697
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:06,020
I would not- I would- in my mind, I'd see myself burning trees to feel better because I fucking hate Groot.

698
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:07,460
Like, I- I can't.

699
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,140
I'm, like, it's been, like, five days of Marble Rivals and I swear if I- oh my god.

700
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:16,800
It's just- especially when you have two Groot players and all they do is, like, I am Groot.

701
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:17,500
Groot.

702
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,560
I am Groot.

703
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,560
I am Groot.

704
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:24,420
And you just hear that non-stop for, like, with two Groot players, too.

705
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,540
Two fucking separate Groot players just shouting that all day long.

706
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,240
And I'm- I just- I can't.

707
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,400
I hate that Groot is meta.

708
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,380
I need somebody to bur- to fucking burn his legs.

709
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:39,360
I- Um,

710
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:49,440
anyway, um, Marion, um, Meti, I'm gonna beat you with a rock.

711
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,400
There you go.

712
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,380
Thank you for the super chat.

713
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:51,720
Thank you.

714
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,380
Thank you.

715
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,880
Um, let's see.

716
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,840
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

717
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,100
Thank you.

718
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:58,460
Thank you.

719
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,220
Can we get some motivation to go to the gym?

720
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,300
Oh shit.

721
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,640
Okay, usually I need time to think about that.

722
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,540
I think it was super chat.

723
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:04,760
Thank you.

724
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,060
Thank you.

725
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,600
So I'm gonna give you, like, something really quick.

726
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,820
Yeah, you go lift those things.

727
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,220
You can do it.

728
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:11,760
Woo!

729
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,980
Get those gains.

730
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,100
Yeah, run that treadmill.

731
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,200
You know what?

732
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,720
I think you need to do a big- okay, actually, no, don't do a bigger.

733
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,740
Don't do a weight.

734
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:25,040
Don't lift things that are- that are too- too big, guys.

735
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,300
Care about your safety.

736
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,080
Anyway, woo!

737
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,140
Lift those weights.

738
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:30,140
That's right.

739
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,620
You can do- guys, is this motivating enough?

740
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,420
Damn, bro, you're getting so big.

741
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,700
Whoa, do you work out?

742
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:45,590
Whoa, bro.

743
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:53,250
Whoa, is that two- is that two pound, um, two pound barbell?

744
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:54,130
Damn.

745
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,170
Slow down, dude.

746
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,290
You're gonna break your hand with that two pounder.

747
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,060
Whoa, I'm motivated.

748
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,780
Bro, two- two pound.

749
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:15,880
Oh, don't you- a whole- a whole two pounds?

750
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:18,800
Oh my god, maybe you should do one pound.

751
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,020
Oh my god, I'm worried.

752
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,460
I'm scared for you.

753
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:21,880
I-

754
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:30,460
Sorry, sorry, uh, that might not be motivating anymore.

755
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:31,740
I'm sorry.

756
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:37,760
I got a little- that might be, uh, that might be demotivating.

757
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,260
Um, let's see.

758
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,280
Uh, Laffy, thank you for the super chat.

759
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:47,640
Thank you.

760
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,320
Thank you.

761
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:51,960
Oh my god, you- oh, you guys almost distracted me enough.

762
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,900
Into the trash you go.

763
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:01,260
There's your- there's your five minute billboard space.

764
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,800
I looked at the clock.

765
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,160
That's a key, right?

766
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:11,800
Right, that's your two dollar- that's your- that's your five minute ad space.

767
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,960
We got- we're done here.

768
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,300
Um, can you give us a proper pronunciation?

769
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,480
You're famous.

770
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,300
Um, as a sound clip.

771
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,300
All right, that's- that's it.

772
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,120
That's basically it.

773
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,420
Thank you for the super chat.

774
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:29,860
Thank you.

775
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,640
Thank you.

776
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:36,440
Um, yeah, anyway, thank you for the super chat.

777
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:36,760
Thank you.

778
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,420
Thank you.

779
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:44,860
If you have a cringy promotional quote like, What a nice morning for mischief, or I'm just here for the boobs.

780
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,340
What would it be?

781
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,500
Wait, is that the promotional quote?

782
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,440
There's no way.

783
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,340
I've never heard her ever say that.

784
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,960
I never heard her say that before.

785
01:15:59,060 --> 01:15:59,620
I don't fuck y'all.

786
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,780
Buy my merch.

787
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:06,300
That's- that's the most promotional thing.

788
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,040
I can say, buy my merch.

789
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:14,260
I literally say that after every convention.

790
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:18,640
They'll be like, do you have any special messages you have to give them, Toki?

791
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,600
And I literally just be like, buy my merch, and then that's it.

792
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,380
She use it.

793
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:25,800
I- I like- I literally say that after every convention.

794
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,860
I- that's my special message.

795
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,660
I'll just be like, buy it.

796
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,440
It's direct, right?

797
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:41,400
It's- direct, and like, you know, people buy my merch after that.

798
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,700
I literally said that.

799
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:46,200
I remember I said that for ACGHK in Hong Kong.

800
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:47,960
I was like, buy my merch.

801
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,980
I have a stand right there.

802
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,120
And then literally, there was a line right after.

803
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,180
And everything sold out.

804
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,640
And I was like, see?

805
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,220
It's that easy.

806
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:03,920
True.

807
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,900
It's- it's literally that easy.

808
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,880
Yeah, it just works.

809
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,020
That's promotional.

810
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,640
It's promotional.

811
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:21,400
Because people be like, well, she has merch right here that I can spend money on.

812
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,500
I'm like, yeah, there it is.

813
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:23,140
It's over there.

814
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,640
Don't need anything fancy.

815
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,900
It's just very direct.

816
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,140
And people laugh and be like, ha ha, silly doki.

817
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,200
That's so funny.

818
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,380
And I'm just here.

819
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,500
I was like, no, seriously, buy my merch.

820
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,960
I get a laugh every time.

821
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,620
And I'm just thinking it's working.

822
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:48,480
I'm just like, well, you might think it's funny, but it's working.

823
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,720
And then they do it.

824
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,140
Yeah.

825
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,920
Yeah, it's a subliminal- it's not even subliminal messaging.

826
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:01,240
It's like, It's like direct messaging.

827
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:08,920
Um...

828
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,360
Let's see.

829
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,340
Uh, Cypher, thank you for the super chat.

830
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:13,780
Thank you.

831
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:14,500
Thank you.

832
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,540
Uh, I have a specific voice request.

833
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,740
No specific line, because I want a true authentic joke.

834
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,900
Some motivation for me to go draw, please.

835
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,300
Hey, draw.

836
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:24,820
Now.

837
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,400
Now.

838
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,020
And then just draw me though.

839
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,200
If you're trying to draw other people, who cares?

840
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,740
If you're drawing me, finish that shit right now.

841
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:38,860
Is that...

842
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,440
Is that...

843
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,060
You should draw me now.

844
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,920
Is that motivating enough?

845
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,340
But if it's like something unrelated to me, who the fuck cares?

846
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,240
If it's me, finish that shit right now.

847
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:56,800
Um...

848
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,880
Thank you for the super chat.

849
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:58,200
Thank you.

850
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:58,880
Thank you.

851
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,420
Yeah, draw only Doki.

852
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,040
And also like Doki dad, too.

853
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,020
Dad's fine as well.

854
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:05,480
Doki Amber Doge is fine.

855
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,000
And in my many forms.

856
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:09,580
Uh...

857
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,640
Not a space alien.

858
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,400
Thank you for the super chat.

859
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:11,660
Thank you.

860
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,300
Thank you.

861
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,940
Uh, am I late for the mandatory sub?

862
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,760
Thank you for the super chat.

863
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,060
Thank you.

864
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:19,520
Thank you.

865
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,580
Duck, thank you for the magenta super.

866
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:24,320
Thank you.

867
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:24,980
Thank you.

868
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,780
Um, I love some Doki inspirational audio.

869
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,240
Uh, I want... okay.

870
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:29,780
Okay.

871
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:30,180
All right.

872
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,000
I want you to know, dragons.

873
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:35,360
No matter what happens, you can do it.

874
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,900
But if you can't, that's okay, too.

875
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:37,760
Like...

876
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,120
That's all right.

877
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,180
It's like... it's all right to be a little lazy.

878
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,340
Just like me right now.

879
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,640
I should be doing work after this, because I told my management team.

880
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,840
I was like, oh, don't worry.

881
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,680
It's gonna be a fast stream, where I just...

882
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:56,340
Uh, where I just like, you know, remember to announce this and stream a little bit longer.

883
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,660
And then we're good to go, because I have a lot of work to do after this.

884
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:00,280
But I'm like...

885
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,580
Thank you for the magenta super.

886
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:10,280
Thank you.

887
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,080
Thank you.

888
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,300
Um...

889
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:16,040
Mason, thank you for the super chat.

890
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:16,360
Thank you.

891
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:16,980
Thank you.

892
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,020
All right.

893
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,340
I'm not like other streamers.

894
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,440
I'm worse.

895
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,300
Wait, that's it?

896
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,160
Wait.

897
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,560
Wait a minute.

898
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:27,020
No, you can fix me.

899
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,540
Isn't that... guys, I am the... you can fix me experience.

900
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:43,780
You hear about all the things... no, we can't.

901
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,040
All right.

902
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:48,360
What do you mean?

903
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,580
I can improve.

904
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,160
I can... that's crazy.

905
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:58,280
No, don't give up, guys.

906
01:20:58,900 --> 01:20:59,580
Guys.

907
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,360
No.

908
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,180
There's baby steps.

909
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,220
Baby steps, everybody.

910
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:10,300
Baby, I am the parenting slash you can fix her experience.

911
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,560
Um, thank you for the super chat.

912
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:17,940
Thank you.

913
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,740
Thank you.

914
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:26,040
Um, while your nendoroid won't be the first piece of merch I got, it'll be the one I'll own with pride and honor.

915
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,200
That's good.

916
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,280
I mean, I hope so.

917
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,480
I'm so excited though.

918
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,940
Guys, pre-order is out.

919
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,160
It's out now.

920
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,120
Remember to pre-order with that link.

921
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,640
Click on the link, guys.

922
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,220
Click on the link, everybody.

923
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,420
Because someday it's... I think it's a tracking link.

924
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,560
So you can track how many people click the link.

925
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,780
So, like, click on that link, guys.

926
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,400
Don't just google it.

927
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,340
Just click on that link because it's directly there.

928
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,180
I hope that's good.

929
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,440
I'm glad you all pre-ordered it.

930
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,300
I think it looks really good, too.

931
01:21:54,720 --> 01:22:00,380
I think, like, the nendoroid itself looks really, really good in general.

932
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,220
Because, like, I don't know.

933
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,420
Like, the paint job, it's so pretty.

934
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:07,000
The paint job in general is really pretty.

935
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:09,860
Um...

936
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,680
Uh, Steve, thank you for the super chat.

937
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,000
Thank you.

938
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:12,580
Thank you.

939
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,540
We live in a society, Steven.

940
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:15,740
Uh...

941
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,220
I clicked it.

942
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,240
Was it the same link?

943
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:21,420
Did it have the nccw2l on it?

944
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,760
Did it have that?

945
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,160
Was... is there still too many?

946
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:25,640
Wait, just wait, guys.

947
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:26,720
Just wait.

948
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,160
It'll be your turn soon.

949
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,480
Medi, thank you for the magenta super.

950
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,040
Thank you.

951
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:31,660
Thank you.

952
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,400
Congrats on 800k, Doki.

953
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,980
We have a small project we're working on that could use your voice.

954
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:36,780
Could you say...

955
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,920
Croak you want a cracker?

956
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:40,640
Uh...

957
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:43,500
Croak you want a cracker?

958
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,640
Does that work?

959
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:54,350
Oh, there's a... oh my god, you guys made something on my intro?

960
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:55,470
Wait, what is it?

961
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:56,950
Sorry, I was so busy.

962
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:58,510
There's so many stuff I had to do today.

963
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:01,070
So many, like, announcements in general, too.

964
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:02,070
I was just like...

965
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:04,850
So busy.

966
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:06,690
Busy, busy girl.

967
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,270
I'm such a busy, busy person.

968
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:12,790
Oh, yeah, I haven't watched it.

969
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:16,210
I was gonna do a reaction to some of the Game Awards stuff, but...

970
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:17,910
um...

971
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:19,850
um...

972
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:20,190
I don't know.

973
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:23,990
The Pac-Man shit was so funny, because, like, remember what I talked about?

974
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:25,710
I was like, what the fuck is that trailer?

975
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:32,090
And apparently, the trailer basically spoiled the game and stuff.

976
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:37,770
So, like, the new Pac-Man game is, like, some fucking crazy gothic shit.

977
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:40,730
Like, I don't even... it looked fucking crazy.

978
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,170
I was just like...

979
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:44,150
I was watching it.

980
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,470
I was like, the fuck am I... what the fuck is this?

981
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:51,130
It's so weird.

982
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:56,050
You know, that was so fucking weird.

983
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,610
I was like, oh my god.

984
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:00,610
All right, let's see, what is it?

985
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:04,230
What is the... oh, it's my intro!

986
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:04,930
Intro!

987
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:10,590
Oh, that's so cool!

988
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:17,070
Yes, they made my intro with cosplayers!

989
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:19,230
That's so cute!

990
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,340
Bum, bum, bum.

991
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:29,060
I would post... I would show it, like, on my screen, but, like, um...

992
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:36,020
I'm worried about, like, because I don't have it where, like, it streams, whatever.

993
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:41,160
Like, I have it so that whatever I put on my OBS shows instantly.

994
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,860
So, I was, like, a little worried if I try to...

995
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:49,220
because I need to, like, pre-set it up if I'm doing anything on the internet.

996
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,400
So...

997
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:56,200
So, I'm, like, worried I'd fuck it up when I share...

998
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,340
Oh my god!

999
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,440
That's so cute!

1000
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,860
Oh my god!

1001
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,220
That's so cute with all the cosplayers, too!

1002
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:08,160
With all the different cosplayers!

1003
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,600
Oh my god!

1004
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:11,740
I love it.

1005
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,580
You can switch OBS to studio mode at will?

1006
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,680
I should try to learn that.

1007
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,360
How do I do studio mode?

1008
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,820
What is that?

1009
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:22,660
What do you mean by that?

1010
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,640
Where's studio?

1011
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:28,180
I should... because I know, like, Mint has it so that, uh...

1012
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:43,760
Mint has it so that she, like, um, instantly, she, like, Mint has it so that she can put something on her screen and it doesn't instantly show, uh, where, where it is and stuff like that.

1013
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,440
Oh, it is!

1014
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,300
I should learn that.

1015
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:48,500
But I shouldn't learn that right now because what if I fuck it up, guys?

1016
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:55,740
But yes, I am, even though I've been streaming for, like, so long now, I'm still, like, I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

1017
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,280
I...

1018
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:05,320
Because, you know, when you, like, get into a habit of, like, things you already know how to do, so then you're like, I don't need to learn anything new now.

1019
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:09,160
I already know everything I have to know, um, and stuff like that.

1020
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:13,660
So that's why I'm, like, I'm just, like, coasting when it comes to, like, OBS stuff.

1021
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,160
Um, okay.

1022
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:20,820
I'm gonna close voice requests right now because, um, I think there's a lot I have to do.

1023
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,720
So, I'm gonna close it now and finish it up, and then we're gonna call it here.

1024
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,440
All right, burrito!

1025
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:27,980
Thank you.

1026
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,240
All right.

1027
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,520
I'm gonna say this once and that's all you get.

1028
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,820
You're just my adorable little pod champ.

1029
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,040
All right.

1030
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,820
Anyway, netbirds, thank you for the super chat.

1031
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,200
Thank you.

1032
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,000
Thank you.

1033
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:46,960
Do you have a single fact that to back that up?

1034
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,780
I look like I stumbled upon that.

1035
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,500
That's ten dollars.

1036
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:01,880
Uh, mystic Tony, thank you for the super chat.

1037
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:02,200
Thank you.

1038
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:02,900
Thank you.

1039
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:07,080
Um, and I gotta tell you, it was perfect.

1040
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,000
Perfect!

1041
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,660
Everything down to the last minute details.

1042
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,400
I'm Homelander.

1043
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,680
I'm the VTuber Homelander.

1044
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,160
Oh, wait, I shouldn't be.

1045
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:17,920
He's fucked up.

1046
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,680
I don't like the new- I didn't- I didn't like the new season of the boys.

1047
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:39,280
To be fair, the comic book series- the comic book- I read the comic book and it's pretty, um, the- the TV adaptation improved the comic book a lot because the comic book is like edgy.

1048
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:44,920
It's like so fucking edgy to a point where some of the edginess did not make sense.

1049
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:50,580
I was like, they did not- they just- they did shock factor stuff for the sake of shock factor.

1050
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:52,900
No, the last- yeah, the last season it was pretty mid.

1051
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,440
Honestly, it was really fucking mid for me.

1052
01:27:55,700 --> 01:28:04,760
Um, Yeah, so honestly, like, yeah, the- the person who made the comic book series really fucking hated superheroes.

1053
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:13,160
So he just like wrote the worst possible like adaptation of like superheroes possible just to show- just to be like how much he hates superheroes.

1054
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:19,220
Um, but like to be fair, they had not a lot to build on with the whole superhero stuff.

1055
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:20,320
So like I don't blame them.

1056
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,380
Not- not superhero.

1057
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:30,640
They had not a whole lot to put- deal with for the uh, for the uh, the boys series.

1058
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:52,440
Also speaking of superheroes, I- I criticized the Marvel movies in my first- in my Marvel Rivals stream because I was like, oh, yeah I don't really pay much attention to Marvel movies after a certain point because like I said it was so formulaic at that point and like I felt like a lot of them are like not as good anymore and then someone in my- someone commented and was like,

1059
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:53,640
how fucking dare you.

1060
01:28:53,940 --> 01:29:03,380
They are- they are like works of art and then I'm- and then like today apparently that newest Marvel movie, the- what was it called?

1061
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:11,440
The- Matt like- The one that apparently people are saying is absolute fucking shit and um

1062
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:19,500
No, he- they wrote like Like it was a very long paragraph.

1063
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,920
It was several paragraphs long.

1064
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:29,900
Oh, yeah Craven the Hunter They- they released like Craven the Hunter and I just want- and I'm just like thinking works of art.

1065
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:30,460
All right

1066
01:29:37,540 --> 01:30:03,280
Um Yeah Like yeah, they're like They were a very passionate Marvel fan and I'm like, yeah to each their own, you know That's what opinions are for but just thought it was really funny because I- I feel like, you know I think my opinion is not that controversial Like I feel like they are pretty formulaic now and they're very predictable.

1067
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:24,280
Um Because they named Deadpool versus Wolverine As an example of like how great Marvel movies movies are and I'm like It was all right Ha It was basically what you expect from a Deadpool movie Like it was formulaic As a Deadpool movie, but it was a fun movie.

1068
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:29,320
I wouldn't call it mass like a work of art But it was a fun movie like

1069
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,900
Oh my god, what was that?

1070
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,780
Oh my god I hear- what was that?

1071
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,920
Oh my god, oh, it's the twitter the twitter thing replaying itself.

1072
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:54,620
Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me Sorry, my my my my the the 800k video replayed itself and it scared me because I was like, where did that come from?

1073
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:19,040
But yeah, I just thought it was really funny, you know, you can name a lot of other Marvel movies but like I I You I would not say Deadpool versus Wolverine was a fucking work of art when I watched Deadpool versus Wolverine and like 50% of like like No,

1074
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,060
it 90% of that.

1075
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:35,920
It's just like hey remember that guy he's here, too I like That's just like I wouldn't call that a work of art Is it like oh there's also that guy we got we got him in too.

1076
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:38,500
Oh my god, there's that guy as well.

1077
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:43,620
Whoa Oh, man, we could have got this person but we couldn't afford him

1078
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:55,400
So So i'm just i'm just like I liked it.

1079
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,280
It was a fun movie.

1080
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,460
I wouldn't fucking call it a work of art.

1081
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:11,840
That's the thing I wouldn't it's just a mindless movie that have to turn your brain off and have fun That's it, which we need more of that to be fair We need fun movies, but like yeah

1082
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:31,360
Oh my god Anyway uh Let's see All right, thank you Thank you.

01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,820
Thank you Now garfield's a work of art.

1084
01:32:34,900 --> 01:33:00,360
I can't believe you would fucking say that to me Garfield is a work of art the guy jim davis He literally made garfield because he was like, I just want to make a lot of fucking money and that is There was no bullshit reason as to why he made garfield there was no Bullshit he literally was just like I want to make a lot of fucking money and then I did it

1085
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:17,440
And then he did it it was just not he was not inspired by anything he didn't do it for like Artistical reasons or like creative reasons.

1086
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:25,320
He was like what can make me so much fucking money No No, no pretentiousness or anything.

1087
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:34,500
No vision, you know, like um, calvin and hobbes the the creator Who's like really against capital like, you know merchandising capitalism?

1088
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:46,080
like and he's just like he wanted to be like more philosophical about the world and like um Talk about different viewpoints and everything and garfield is like fuck.

1089
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,580
I just want money

1090
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:10,360
And then he was like, I just want to make a lot of fucking money and then he did it mystic tony Then you know super chat thing you think yeah, I like calvin hobbes, too But you have to admit at the late you like calvin hobbes But do you like have you read all of the calvin and hobbes comic book strips?

1091
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:17,580
Because like you can tell when someone says I like calvin hobbes, but they only like they've only like read the p the

1092
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,980
calvin and hobbes, uh Calvin hobbes.

1093
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:25,940
I like how it helps too.

1094
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:59,940
But like you can tell at one point he got super philosophical um, and like the direction and then it like direction of that changed a lot Because you remember a lot of the you remember some of the comic strips that were like, um That were like, uh, you know more more easier to understand and everything But there are some comic book strips That from calvin hobbes where he got like where child would not understand what the fuck he was talking about

1095
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:32,620
I don't remember which one it was it was I remember I don't remember which which Which comic strip it was but there was one where they were discussing about like like political systems I was like what the fuck Cuz I was really young when I was reading it and I was I was really young when I was reading it cuz I was like I was just like obviously I didn't know what the what fuck was but I was just like Okay

1096
01:35:37,780 --> 01:36:06,720
But when you get older you appreciate it more because it was a very smart comic book like it was a very smart comic series There was a very yeah, it literally they're named after philosophy, but yeah, but child me did not know that Guys, like now I know they're named after philosophers cuz I'm a fucking adult now But child me when I did not know Know anything about philosophy back there.

1097
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:43,360
Oh My god Um, but it's a really good comic series I you know admire that like he didn't he didn't sell out and I also might admire Jim Davis for selling out And as Snoopy is like the middle ground I feel like I really Snoopy is like the middle ground between selling out and not selling out because they they like hand-picked on like how to sell like Snoopy the creator of Snoopy is like You know,

1098
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:58,360
they're they're very careful not to create I don't even know if he's still alive, but like the pew ever owns the brand of Snoopy They pick and choose exactly how to sell out because they're like, they don't you know Garfield's like if I can put my name on it,

1099
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,560
I'm gonna put my name on it.

1100
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:09,380
Snoopy was like, okay, wait here I'm gonna fucking you know Pick and choose Exactly how I'm gonna sell out.

1101
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:16,380
So I'm not gonna put my name on Everything I'm just gonna put my name on some things

1102
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:39,280
