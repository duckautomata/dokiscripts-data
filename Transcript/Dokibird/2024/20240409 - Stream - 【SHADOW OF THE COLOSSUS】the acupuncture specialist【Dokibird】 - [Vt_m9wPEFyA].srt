8
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,920
waiting for this while i was like try to fix the stream um
because you know i actually almost started with 10 minute

9
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:59,160

11
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,900

on the left side of the screen.

12
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:25,820
I know I know it's like really rare to see me on the left
side of the screen But I've had people on the last shadow

13
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:32,260
colossus being like I need to see the stamina bar Where's

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,000
Where the fuck is the stamina bar?

15
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,320

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
Okay, don't say I don't do nothing for you guys.

18
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:51,960
Okay, guys?

19
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,140
Don't say I don't do anything for you guys.

20
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:01,000
Because I, um, I, oh, he worked so hard to be on the left
screen, just so you guys know.

21
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,340
I, I worked so fucking hard.

22
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,960
It took so much courage and determination to, like, break
out of routine and, like, be on the left side.

23
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,660
So, if you say I don't do anything for you guys, that's a
fucking lie.

24
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,860
Now I'm on the left side of the screen.

00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,690
Okay, wait.

160
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,050
Does the fruit do anything?

161
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,450
There's fruit here?

162
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,950
Can I eat that?

163
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,890
Can I eat the fruit?

164
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,050
All right, let's see.

165
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,770
How do I...

166
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,250
Okay, I'm crouching.

167
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,150
All right, let's see if I can eat the fruit.

168
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,110
Oh, I can eat the fruit!

169
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,330
Can I?

170
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,230
Guys, I don't know if I pick up.

171
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,410
Pick up the fruit.

172
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,510
Pick up the fruit.

173
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,790
Oh, okay.

174
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,750
Wait, how do I eat it?

175
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,570
Eat the fruit.

176
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,390
Eat the fruit.

177
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,570
Eat the fruit.

178
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,740
Guys, I ate the fruit.

179
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,900
Guys, I figured it out, chap.

180
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,540
It was R2.

181
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,560
See, I told you guys.

182
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,060
The moment I figure out the mechanics, I start gaming.

183
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,760
Oh, wait, there's more.

184
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,160
Okay, there's more.

185
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,880
I told you guys.

186
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Camera, please.

187
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,760
The moment I figure this out, I start gaming.

188
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,260
Okay, this is, like, not fair.

189
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,080
I actually have to preach.

190
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,480
Okay, this is not fair because I literally can't see it on
the camera.

191
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:22,040
look at that gaming this is called fps pure fps skills right

196
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,660
It's just a fucking wall.

197
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,320
Oh, no.

198
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,100
This is the worst part.

199
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,000
It's the other way.

200
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,460
Okay, I'm going back.

201
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,900
All right, we're figuring this out.

202
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,220
Guys, we're going to figure this out.

203
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,140
Go, Arlo.

204
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,560
Go, go.

205
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,360
Go, Arlo, go.

206
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,240
Hey, like, at least I'm eating and drinking water, right?

207
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,580
My guy is actually eating and drinking water.

208
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,460
So, like, you know, things are not bad.

209
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,140
You know?

210
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,100
You're staying hydrated and, like, you stay hydrated and,
like, surviving.

211
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,340
Okay.

212
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,220
This way.

213
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,820
Go, Arlo.

214
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,260
Go.

215
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,260
Please.

216
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,660
It's really hard to open an acupuncture massage parlor in
this neighborhood.

217
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,400
We get, like, one client every, like, couple of months.

218
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,740
Don't worry.

219
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,320
My dead girlfriend will appreciate this for sure.

220
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,740
Do I go up?

221
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,100
Let's see.

222
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,800
Oh, no, that's not the sword.

223
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,620
I wish I had a magical bow.

224
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,480
It sucks.

225
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,980
Why did the devil only bless my fucking sword and not my
bow?

226
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,660
Like, if they can bless more than one thing, like, if they
can bless one thing, they might as well bless the other.

227
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,240
You know?

228
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,960
You need magical arrows?

229
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,900
I'll just come and pick it up.

230
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,280
It's not like I shot it pretty far.

231
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,140
If it's magical, it'll be glowing.

232
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,860
Please, Arlo, just walk around the trees.

233
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,940
Where the fuck do I go?

234
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,700
Oh, this is...

235
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,220
Oh, no.

236
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,120
I don't like this.

237
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,820
Where am I?

238
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,220
Magic sword!

239
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,640
Where am I?

240
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,660
Okay, this way.

241
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:54,840
Alright.

242
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,660
There.

243
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,420
Look.

244
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,660
They can bless like...

245
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,060
Please.

246
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,460
Okay, I'm getting off.

247
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm getting off.

248
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,640
I was pissing me.

249
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm not lost yet.

250
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,060
I have the sun.

251
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,020
I have the power of the sun.

252
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,340
Wait, maybe it's down here.

253
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,060
It has to be, right?

254
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,100
Like, why would there be a cave?

255
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,000
Okay.

256
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,440
Nice.

257
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,620
Boon the Nomad.

258
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,400
What?

259
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,440
Where?

260
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:53,300

Alright.

265
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,660
Time to figure out where to go.

266
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,320
Sword.

267
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,660
Oh no.

268
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,640
Where the fuck's the sun?

269
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,300
All the trees are blocking the sun.

270
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,620
This way.

271
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,100
Okay.

272
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,540
It's this way.

273
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,280
Do I just jump down?

274
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,690
Is this it?

275
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,330
Oh this is it.

276
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,710
That'll be fine.

277
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,550
Watch this.

278
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,230
this guys i don't know why he's hesitating

279
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:20,200
hmm i have a feeling i shouldn't jump down

280
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:30,090
do you guys think i can like catch one of the rocks down
there i don't think

281
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:39,570
Okay, okay, I actually don't- guys, I'm not gonna do it
because I need to find a shrine first.

282
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,610
I- I don't want to- I don't want to shoot the things again.

283
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,130
Man, I wonder why the main character was hesitating just
now.

284
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,170
I wonder why.

285
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,810
I think that's the road down, right?

286
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,690
This has to be the road down.

287
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:56,870
Okay.

288
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,830
Oh, where's the sun?

289
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,690
Oh, this fucking tiny piece of shade blocked it.

290
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,050
It has to be here.

291
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,290
How do I get down from there?

292
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,030
Okay, I'm just...

293
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,830
That shouldn't kill me, right?

294
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,350
I don't...

295
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,050
I like how the main character was like, no.

296
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,410
The main character is just like, please, please, Doki, don't
do it.

297
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,010
Surely...

298
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,750
That was...

299
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,630
Arna, why are you running ahead?

300
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,150
Look, I'm trying to...

301
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,590
I'm testing the limits.

302
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,890
I'm trying to, like, test the limits of, like, fall damage.

303
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,150
Okay.

304
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,850
Oh, my God.

305
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,410
The horse riding mechanic has to be, like, the hardest
mechanic.

306
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,590
Wait, what's this over there?

307
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,410
What's that over there?

308
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,610
There's, like, a little hole.

309
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,650
What is that?

310
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,910
Is that the way down?

311
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,890
Oh, it was!

312
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,010
I missed the hole.

313
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:04,530
Whoops.

314
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,550
Did I?

315
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,790
Did I miss the hole?

316
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,050
Oh my god.

317
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,170
This is just a tiny shade.

318
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,170
What do you mean?

319
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,010
I can't fucking see anything.

320
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,010
Alright.

321
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,690
This has to be the place.

322
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,050
This has to be the area.

323
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:20,670
Oh my god.

324
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,110
Where the fuck is the shade?

325
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,810
Where's the sun?

326
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,550
Oh my god.

327
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,350
Oh the clouds are blocking the sun.

328
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,350

like when you're like a specialist that just travels to like

336
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,990
travels to people's homes for your thing.

337
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,230
It's so risky.

338
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,570
What if you get murdered?

339
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,150
Like, that sounds so fucking risky.

340
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,830
You don't know where they can't come from.

341
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,950
You know where they really come from.

342
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,310
I love sand.

343
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,410
I hate sand.

344
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,430
This has to be it.

345
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,290
This is it?

346
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,450
That's just a...

347
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,350
That's just a rock.

348
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,630
Where the fuck does this guy live?

349
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,770
Where the fuck do you live?

350
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,290
Sir?

351
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,070
Here?

352
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,630
Underground?

353
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,490
Where the fuck is here?

354
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,630
Oh, oh, here, here.

355
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,550
Okay, get off.

356
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,450
Alright, here you go.

357
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,450
He has to live here.

358
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,710
There's no other way.

359
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,230
It has to live here.

360
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,670
Has to be here.

361
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,270
Alright, I figured it out.

362
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,670
He's underneath.

363
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,610
He's underground.

364
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,550
Wait, crouch?

365
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:11,390
Crouch?

366
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,730
Crouch?

367
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,290
I know you can crouch.

368
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,970
Oh, that's all.

369
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,890
Okay, never mind.

370
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,430
Apparently, I don't know how to crouch.

371
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,510
I was wrong.

372
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,230
He definitely did not.

373
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,310
know how to crouch.

374
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,330
Wee.

375
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,230
Alright.

376
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,670
Time to go to my next appointment.

377
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,530
Hello, sir.

378
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,890
Your acupuncture specialist is here.

379
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,960
Don't worry.

380
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,480
My rates are very reasonable.

381
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,280
I'll be five out of five stars on Yelp.

382
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,120
I would die if I...

383
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,360
Oh, my God.

384
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,580
Oh, my God.

385
00:26:59,620 --> 00:26:59,980
No!

386
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,780
Why didn't they stop me?

387
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,200
Oh, fuck.

388
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,620
Okay, we're gonna...

389
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,270
Oh, my God.

390
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,790
Oh, my God.

391
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,010
Oh, whoa!

392
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:18,750
Yay!

393
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,870
Okay, I actually thought I was gonna die.

394
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,230
I actually thought I was gonna die.

395
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,270
Thank God.

396
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,570
Thank God, walls.

397
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,670
The walls saved my life.

398
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,030
Alright, what do you look like?

399
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,530

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,890

Oh!

424
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,490
I'm like a little rat.

425
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:00,870
Hello, sir.

426
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,890
Hello, please.

427
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,110
Your brother really liked it.

428
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,170
He's totally very much alive.

429
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,570
He just didn't call you because he's just so fucking
relaxed.

430
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,310
Okay?

431
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,390
He just didn't call you because he was just so relaxed, sir.

432
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,650
What's it do?

433
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,730
Hit me?

434
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,770
Look at him.

435
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,730
He doesn't know what to do.

436
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,910
He's just looking at me.

437
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,590
What's he got to do?

438
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,890
Just walking around.

439
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,690
Hello.

440
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,050
Yay.

441
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,190
I don't know.

442
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,270
Is he gonna come closer?

443
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:37,530
Hello?

444
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,370
Oh!

445
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:40,450
Oh!

446
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,170

There we go.

450
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,670
Sir, you need to trim your fucking beard, sir.

451
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,750
I actually have no idea where the weak point is.

452
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,510
I did not pay it.

453
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,130
Oh, it's on the head.

454
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,610
It's always on the head because you're always stressed in
the head.

455
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,170
Don't worry!

456
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,630
I'm here!

457
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,710
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

458
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,290
The specialist is here.

459
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:05,590
I need a revival!

460
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,750
Oh, oh my god.

461
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,230
Please do not resist!

462
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,850
Do not resist, sir!

463
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,870
It is for- do you want to live long?

464
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,650
If you want to live long and prosper, you gotta take this!

465
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,810
Boom, there you go.

466
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,050
I really, I need to, like, chill a little bit.

467
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,730
No word, that's just the oil.

468
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,230
It's called stress oil.

469
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,990
Trust the process.

470
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,010
It's called stress oil.

471
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,190
It's not blood.

472
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,650
It might look like blood.

473
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,470
But it's just all the excess oil in your head.

474
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,530
Because you're thinking too much, sir.

475
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,290
You are just thinking too much.

476
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,270
All right, there you go.

477
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,870

All right, here you go.

527
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,000
It's this way.

528
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,900
Is this the lake?

529
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,140
Oh my god, do you remember the lake?

530
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,500
Hey, Arlo, do you remember?

531
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,900
Do you remember the happy times we had in that?

532
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,480
All right, we have to figure out how to get down.

533
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,720
I actually don't remember how to get down from the lake.

534
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,000
Uh...

535
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
How do I get down from here?

536
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,760
How the fuck?

537
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,080
Where the fuck is the ladder?

538
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,000
Where is the ladder?

539
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,600
Is it through this bridge?

540
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,200
Just... Guys, no.

541
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,640
I know we can't just jump.

542
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,440
We've...

543
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,620
We've tested that theory before.

544
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,360
Is that bridge?

545
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,600
Is that a bridge?

546
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,920
No, that's not a bridge.

547
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,840
Is that a bridge?

548
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,360
Can't tell.

549
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,620
It's just fucking...

550
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,080
There.

551
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,420
Oh, it's the wrong way.

552
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:55,780
Okay.

553
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,080
God, I'm so directionless.

554
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,840
Oh my god.

555
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,280
Thank god.

556
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,940
I was born in a time when GPS exists.

557
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,740
Like, thank god.

558
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,580
Please!

559
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:06,980
Arlo!

560
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Turn around!

561
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:09,640
There you go.

562
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,120
Thank you.

563
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:10,940
Thank you.

564
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,320
Alright.

565
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm happy.

566
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,420
I know people are like, would you rather be born like, uh,
like 50 years ago or like, uh, in the past or 50 years in

567
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,880
the future?

568
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,460
I think I like where I'm currently at.

569
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,240
Maybe, like, a little bit.

570
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,600
Maybe I wish I was born, like, a little bit.

571
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:31,960
Um...

572
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,440
Did I just go back the same way?

573
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,280
No.

574
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,540
No?

575
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,620
Oh, fucking...

576
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,920
We'll figure it out later.

577
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,440
I don't think I did, right?

578
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,880
I don't know if... Did I just went back the same way?

579
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,500
I can't tell.

580
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,520
It's under.

581
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,420
It's like the lake is below me.

582
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,400
I know the lake.

583
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,420
This is the lake.

584
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,880
Yeah, this is the lake.

585
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,960
Is this a lake or is this an ocean?

586
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,900
I'll never know.

587
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,560
This has to be the lake.

588
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,020
Okay.

589
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,660
I do sometimes wish.

590
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,500
Wait, no.

591
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,140
Wait, is this a lake or an ocean?

592
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,340
This is an ocean.

593
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,180
There's a lake?

594
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,480
It's all water!

595
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,640
How am I supposed to tell?

596
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:41,940

00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,700
is this a lake The sword keeps pointing down.

603
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,640
How the fuck do I go down?

604
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,400
Is that a lake?

605
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,260
Or is it the lake behind me?

606
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,590
Is that a lake?

607
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,050
No, because I've been there.

608
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,210
That's where I killed the other colossus.

609
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,210
Okay.

610
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:57,750
Lake.

611
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,430
Follow the path?

612
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,510
The path is...

613
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,350
is down.

614
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,050
But then I already been to that Colossus.

615
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,710
Where the fuck's the lake?

616
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,010
Because like, I was there already.

617
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,490
Alright, I guess we'll do this again?

618
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,450
I hate going over here, because there's no fucking light.

619
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,410
There's like no light at all here.

620
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,630
So I actually have to rely on pure instinct, and I don't
have that.

621
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,670
Also, I don't want to be born, like, Like back.

622
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:44,010
I might be born ahead, but not too ahead because I'm scared
of global Not too ahead because I think we sort of fucked up

623
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,610
the planet.

624
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,800
I'm not sure yet though And I don't want to I don't want to
be born too ahead to find out

625
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:11,270
Yeah, I I don't want to like find out if I think we said I
don't know I don't know judging by the what the weather is

626
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:22,850
like currently I don't know also if I was born too far but
too far back in the past there's no there's no internet and

627
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:29,050
I don't know how to survive well to be fair if I didn't grow
up with the internet I wouldn't have to worry about like not

628
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:39,110
knowing how to survive without it but like oh my god I'd
have to get a if it weren't for the internet I'd have to get

629
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,190
a real job

630
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:51,930
where you going try to fucking figure out if this is the
lake is this the lake are you a lake sir there's no way

631
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,570

633
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,610

00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,360
It doesn't tell me where Lake is.

656
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,820

Why is there so many lakes here?

We gotta industrialize this area.

677
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:49,930
We gotta make this a city so I don't have to deal with all
these lakes.

678
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,050
Is that shrine?

679
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,330

00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,390
My heart tells me that this is where the lake is.

687
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:16,270
If there's no lake here, I'm gonna make my own fucking lake.

688
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:19,010
Is this another area?

689
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:20,870
What the fuck?

690
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:23,790
Alright.

691
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:27,350
Me down this path, there's a lake.

692
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,950
Okay.

693
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,570
Maybe down this path, there's the lake I'm looking for.

694
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,350
And then, or the sun, you know, I'll take either.

695
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,910
I'll take the fucking GPS.

696
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,950
My solar-powered GPS.

697
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:40,890
Wait, wait, wait.

698
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,310
Oh my god.

699
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,350
Solar-powered GPS.

700
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,130
Boor-do.

701
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:52,710
But...

702
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:57,250
Guys, how the fuck do I get over there?

703
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,270
Did I go the wrong way?

704
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:04,550
Did I...

705
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,170
Did I go...

706
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,750
No, I must not have.

707
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,990
No, this has to be the right way.

708
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,850
There's no...

709
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,050
How do I get over to the other side?

710
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,790
There's no way...

711
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:20,390
No.

712
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,170
There's no way.

713
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,270
This has to be.

714
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:25,170
There's no other path.

715
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:27,810
That's literally the only path I have.

716
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,290
It's heading...

717
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:37,770
Wait, it's heading further and further away from where my
sword was gonna ask me to go, but like it has to be It has

718
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:42,310
to like miraculously turn right Like please

719
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:52,770
Oh my god, please please it has to miraculously turn right

720
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,110
Oh no, where am I?

721
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,250
Where am I?

722
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,250
Where is this place?

723
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,370
Riding a horse, don't turn the sticks.

724
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,870
He travels automatic through these paths.

725
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,790
Oh, he does!

726
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,950
Wait, does he?

727
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,370
Oh, my God!

728
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,070
He moves on his own!

729
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,030
Oh, my God.

730
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,150
Thank you for the super chat.

731
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:20,850
Oh, my God.

732
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,570
Everything changed.

733
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,810
This entire game changed for me.

734
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,130
I literally don't have to move.

735
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:30,830
He can move for me.

736
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,170
Guys, I think I went the wrong way, guys.

737
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,150
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I went the wrong way.

738
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,730
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

739
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,550
I'm heading to a new path.

740
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,130
I'm going to a new area.

741
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,030
Oh, wait, I'm going up.

742
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,710
This might be where the lake is.

743
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:55,310
Oh, my God.

744
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,110
Arlo knows where to go.

745
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,410
Okay, GPS.

746
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,630
Where do I go, GPS?

747
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,390
Where do I fucking go?

748
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:06,430
Did I go the wrong way?

749
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,350
Do I...

750
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,630
Is it like maybe...

751
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,510
Okay, or the...

752
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:13,830

Okay, guys, guys.

Right or forward?

755
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,830
Maybe...

756
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,510
Maybe the lake is a sky lake.

757
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:23,550
Maybe...

758
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,350
Guys, maybe...

759
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:35,530

Wait, no, I've been to the shrine before.

772
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,460
No, this is one of the two shrines I've been to.

773
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,280
Oh my god!

774
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,020

00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,140
Oh my god.

776
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,840
Guys, I've been to the shrine before.

777
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:02,820
Alright.

778
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:03,880
Okay.

779
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,380
It's okay.

780
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,260
But this has to be where the lake is now.

781
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,500
Alright, the lake...

782
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,600
lake is this way.

783
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,000
This has to be the lake.

784
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,560
There's no... How do I get over this?

785
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,600
It has to be over this platform.

786
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,380
Alright.

787
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,060
Beyond the shrine.

788
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:25,960
So down here.

789
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:26,900
Okay.

790
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,900
Just keep going.

791
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,240
Alright.

792
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,820
This is...

793
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,000
This has... Wait.

794
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:32,920
Did I come from here?

795
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,920
Wait.

796
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,980
Did I... No.

797
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:36,580
No I didn't.

798
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:37,620
Okay.

799
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,460
Wait can I climb that?

800
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,620
Oh, I can?

801
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,060
Alright.

802
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,920
Okay, I can climb it.

803
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:48,220
Okay.

804
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,060
Alright, this is it.

805
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:50,980
This is it.

806
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,780
I figured it out.

807
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,060
I did not look at chat.

808
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,280
I figured it out with my own fucking intuition.

809
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,580
This is it.

810
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,800
I figured it out, Arlo.

811
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,180
With my own intuition.

812
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,340
Okay, how do I get up?

813
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:09,520
Jump.

814
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,220

815
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:34,060

816
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:39,160
guys i did not get one guy i did not get two guys I get like
several guide.

817
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,620
I fucking saw like four different people that told me to
climb this.

818
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,160
I literally saw four different people that said you should
climb it.

819
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,920
And I was like, oh my god, I figured it out.

820
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,020
Where's Arlo going?

821
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,180
Hello, where are you going?

822
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,620
I need you to go this path.

823
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,440
Okay, maybe it's this way, right?

824
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,280
Where did I come from again?

825
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,980
I came from the top, so it has to be...

826
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,280
Wait.

827
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,200
where did I come from?

828
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,760
Where did I...

829
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,660
Here.

830
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,180
I did not come from here.

831
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,280
Yeah.

832
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,120
Here.

833
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,660
Alright, this is where I didn't come from.

834
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,960
So the lake...

835
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,700
The lake should be down there.

836
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,520
Should be left side.

837
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,280
Because that's where the thing is.

838
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:34,680
Right?

839
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,400
It should be left.

840
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:50,560
This is where the lake should be oh my god i'm so this this
has to be where the lake is because the thing was like go

841
00:54:50,560 --> 00:55:04,260
left oh no where's the gps telling me no i'm going back in
the same area i'm going i'm going around again no where's my

842
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:20,300
gps oh go right okay I go right okay this way all right I
turned around I apparently the last time I went left now I

843
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:34,400
go right this is where lake is lake how do you guys remember
where the fuck the lake is sleepy I left for a meeting are

844
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:41,570
we still looking for the lake Sleepy, thank you for the
super chat, thank you, thank you.

845
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,260
Wait, now it's sand.

846
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,560
Why sand?

847
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,800
Sand eventually leads the lake.

848
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,260
Guys, if you guys didn't know, sand becomes water.

849
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,560
Because that's where sand comes from.

850
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,200
Sand comes from, like, the, like, erosion of rock.

851
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,500
From water.

852
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,800
This is where lake is.

853
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,600
Right?

854
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,380
Lake?

855
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,500
Where is this?

856
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,740
Is this the lake?

857
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,240
Where the fuck do I get down?

858
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,500
This is lake!

859
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,920
Oh my god, this is lake.

860
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,420
We made it.

861
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,900
Wait, I told you.

862
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,240
I told...

863
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,780
I told you.

864
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,840
Sad eventually becomes water.

01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,120
What do I do?

934
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,540
I'm not even on the right side of history right now.

935
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,100

Look at all the stress juice.

960
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,120

1043
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,380
It's all about satisfying the customer's demands.

1044
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:28,000
Then you can go home back to your one, back to your studio
apartment.

1045
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,500
The customer is always right.

1047
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,330

01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,530
Oh, crouch to heal faster.

1049
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:46,650

body.

1060
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:28,550
From my home.

1061
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,570
Don't worry, you just need a crystal.

1062
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:35,990
Can I recommend you a crystal for you to purchase?

1063
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,090
Where the fuck is the tail?

1064
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,010

Thank you, thank you, doctor.

1069
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:54,550

I can grab on the second.

1075
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:02,870
Don't worry.

1076
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,370
No, he's just being shy.

1077
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:09,790
He's just being shy because I'm, like, streaming my
sessions.

1078
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:14,730
Like, those people that stream their actual job, like, the,
like, those, like, convenience stores.

1079
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:21,030
And, like, um, like, those convenience stores and stuff
where, where they stream their jobs and stuff.

1080
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:21,710
Sir!

1081
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:28,830

bought my services but like there's a lot there I have I

1082
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:41,850

all right and I need the content so like I'm here to I'm

1083
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:50,590
here to stream this acupuncture session you're violating
patient confidentiality look to violate doctor patient

1084
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:53,290
confidentiality that I actually have to be licensed.

1085
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:54,430
Which I totally am.

1086
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,650

Alright, this has to be the tail.

1089
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,190

I totally am licensed, guys.

1094
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,610
It's not like I learned from online YouTube videos.

1095
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:30,370
But to be like you know um it doesn't hurt like a youtube a
person who learns from youtube video is just as valid as a

Look, look at that.

1113
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,190
I got rid of all your electricity.

1114
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,690
When you get really stressed out, like, lightning starts
coming out.

1115
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:46,270
Alright, here you go.

1116

01:10:58,810 --> 01:10:59,430
All right, there you go.

1122
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:00,780
Bye-bye.

1123
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:02,850
Oh, God.

1124
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:03,590
Come on!

1125
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,150
Let me fucking poke you!

1126
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:07,870
Yes.

1127
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:13,270
You can see I've already helped him so much, you know,
because he's not- he doesn't have electricity anymore.

1128
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,630
Oh, I did it.

1129
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:21,590
Yay.

1130
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,110
Anyway, unrelated to this, but we're having fish for dinner.

1131
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:31,890
I also made, like, a little blowhole for them.

1132
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:38,270
So, like, they don't have to always, like, come up all the
time up in the air for, like, you know, to breathe.

1133
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,370
They just need to poke their little blowhole.

1134
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,610
I self-made a blowhole for them.

1135
01:11:49,090 --> 01:12:05,910
happy customer what a happy fish so happy so considerate I
know unrelated to this but dragoons I got you guys fish for

1136
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:14,210

dead he's so relaxed that he fell asleep deep in the ocean

1137
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:16,250
That's how fish asleep.

1138
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:19,550

Did it float up?

01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,690
No.

1143
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:31,710
If it was dead, it would float up.

1144
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:33,910
It did not float up.

1145
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:37,510
So in the end, it is still alive.

1146
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:44,490

I'm not right I bet you're Quebecois

1268
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,680
For those who are like What does that mean?

1269
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:27,020
That's like sort of like The Canadian insult The people who
disagree Like And so Here's a little Canadian history.

1270
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:33,400
But like, even if Canadians disagree with each other, they
can all agree that like the Quebec Wall is important.

1271
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:41,720
The Quebec people in Quebec, they can all agree that they do
not like the people in Quebec.

1272
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,480
And if you're from Quebec, bro, you know it's true.

1273
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,600
You know it's true.

1274
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,000
He didn't, bro, okay, here's a little story.

1275
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:04,820
I have a friend from Quebec, and then he told me, like, yo,
yeah, I was like, oh, shit, where are you from, Canada?

1276
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,880
I was like, Quebec, and I was like, oh, Quebec, and he's
like, I know.

1277
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,520
And he was like, bro, I hate it.

1278
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:26,940
It's because, like, okay, the reason why Quebec is, like,
has this reputation is that Quebec, Quebec has always tried

1279
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:34,720
to like like piece off from Canada because like Quebec has
like their own like fucking like they're like it's oh so

1280
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:43,200
it's like if like if like a random state in America has
their own like party has their own political party and like

1281
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:50,760
they make like lots of demands and stuff so like Quebec has
their own party called a Québécois I think I remember how it

1282
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:56,260
was like the Quebecois, right, it's like they have their own
political party and like at one point in Canadian history

1283
01:24:56,260 --> 01:25:10,280
they try to vote to be like their own fucking basically they
try to vote to be their own country and they try to vote to

1284
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:18,140
be not Canada and try to be like their own like like their
own like fucking independent country in the middle of Canada

1285
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,280
Not once, but twice.

1286
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,040
So people are like, but you can't be quiet.

1287
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:38,760
So that's why like every Canadian can agree that like you
can't be like the goddamn chemicoat.

1288
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,060
It's like a, it's like a little, it's a little like running
joke in Canada.

1289
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:59,400
uh this way here we go actually texas but in canada

01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:14,000
okay but yeah it's a little it's a little quebec fun fact a
little a little canadian fun fact um and so it's a little

1291
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:21,740

canadian is from Quebec.

1292
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:26,800

XQC is from Quebec.

1293

And, like, a lot... Like, the thing is, a lot of people from
Quebec are very similar to, like, how XQC is like.

1377
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:32,840

1388
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:51,020

1392
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:00,680
Pineapples...

1393
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:06,080

1395
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,500

1398
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:31,160

01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:31,640
like bushes.

1400
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:38,600

It's so fucking weird.

1404
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,900
It's literally like a bush.

1405
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,040
It's not even like a real tree.

1406
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:57,420
Oh yeah, selective breeding.

1407
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,860
Oh yeah, no, we fucking did a lot of that type of shit.

1408
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:06,720
I was, I've been like getting like YouTube shorts of
people's selective breeding like silk moss or whatever.

1409
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:18,320
code and then like apparently like we like uh we selected
breed like uh silk mobs so much that their wings don't even

1410
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:30,500
work like their wings their wings don't even work and that
they're only when they when they like uh come out their

1411
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:36,700
cocoons all they do is want to fuck and then they their
mouths don't even work their mouths are like like their

1412
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:43,720
brain is just they want to bang so they don't eat for five
day like three to five days they don't eat for three to five

1413
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:50,720
days and all they do is just bang and then they die like
they come out of their cocoons they come out of their cell

1414
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:59,680
cocoons bang for three to five day like bang for like three
to five days and die that's like their life cycle that's

1415
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:06,040
it's off it's so fucked up they have a mouth but They don't
know how to use the mouth.

1609
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:46,460
Kandoki, the massage therapist, and your local neuter
services for lizards only.

1610
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,040
I can only work on lizards, though.

1611
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:48,800
Nothing else.

1612
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,200
Look at that.

01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,680
Guys, I'm so talented.

1614
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:59,460
Of course you would contact your local massage therapist for
lizard neutered.

1615
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:00,440
All right.

1616
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:02,800

01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:07,460
You don't need kids.

1621
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:10,540
You can't afford all the fucking child services.

1622
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:11,640
Not child service.

1623
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,020

You can't afford the the payments

1625
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:23,480
It's the opposite of a happy ending child support.

1626
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:34,160
Yeah, child support All right Nice It's okay.

1627

He couldn't afford the child support anyway Guys, he
literally caused a Florida iguana epidemic.

1628
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:42,780
We gotta get rid of him.

1629
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:51,060
Just like how barbers are used to perform surgery.

1630

01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:16,830
I can perform neuters and also give you a massage.

1695
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:20,770
I can fix the iguana.

1696
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:23,730
The iguana pandemic.

1697
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:25,390
And also...

1698
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,770
That's so high.

1699
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:37,550
Holy shit, Ola.

1700
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:38,930
What the fuck was that?

1701
01:55:39,030 --> 01:55:43,070
Bro, this is like the first time he did something actually
badass.

1702
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:49,670
It's because they're so fucking relaxed that they never get
stressed again.

1703
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:53,270
Like, you won't understand.

1704
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:55,210
How the fuck do I get to the other side?

1705
01:55:55,750 --> 01:56:01,330
They were so fucking stressed out that they like, um, how
the fuck do I get to the other side, though?

1706
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:09,670
They were so stressed out that I relaxed them so much with
my massage and acupuncture that, like, they just never had

1707
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:10,310
to come back.

1708
01:56:11,110 --> 01:56:13,850
I basically relieved them of their stress.

1709
01:56:16,990 --> 01:56:17,710
Punch stop.

1710
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:18,670
Thank you for the super chat.

1711
01:56:18,890 --> 01:56:19,410
Thank you.

1712
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:20,710
Thank you, Doki, the dream daddy.

1713
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:21,630
I mean, husband.

1714
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:23,030
Okay, this way.

1715
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:23,910
Okay, I need to go.

1716
01:56:24,730 --> 01:56:25,130
Alright.

1717
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:27,150
We need to go this way, Arlo.

1718
01:56:28,810 --> 01:56:29,870
This has to be it.

1719
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:31,050
There's like tornadoes.

1720
01:56:31,090 --> 01:56:32,990
There's like little mini tornadoes stuff.

1721
01:56:33,710 --> 01:56:34,210
Oh, shit.

1722
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:35,150
This is gonna be hard.

1723
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:36,710
Oh, no.

1724
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:38,910
Oh, no.

1725
01:56:39,010 --> 01:56:40,630
Oh, I don't like this.

1726
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:42,290
I don't like this Colossi already.

1727
01:56:43,130 --> 01:56:44,110
Bro, what the fuck?

1728
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:46,090
What the fuck?

1729
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:47,690
Am I in like the geysers?

1730
01:56:49,930 --> 01:56:52,330
Bro, what the fuck is this?

1731
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:54,690
Where even is the?

1732
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:57,330
What the fuck is the Colossi?

1733
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:00,050
Did I miss it?

1734
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:03,550
Where is he?

1735
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:07,170
Yeah, the Yellowstone.

1736
01:57:11,140 --> 01:57:12,300
Did I miss it?

1737
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:13,580
Where the fuck is he?

1738
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:16,180
He's like here.

1739
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:19,420
He's in the cave?

1740
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,120
Why are you all in the cave?

1741
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:21,740
Get out!

1742
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:22,540
Get a job!

1743
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:30,520
Get out of that cave and get a job!

1744
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:32,900
It's time!

1745
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,280
It's time to move out!

1746
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:36,500
See the sun!

1747
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,640
I am here.

1748
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:44,300
hired by your mom to tell you to get out of that cave.

1749
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:46,120
The cave is safe.

1750
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:52,140
But the cave feels so safe, Doki.

1751
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:54,900
Is it that?

1752
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,820
That looks like a cave turtle.

1753
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:58,160
Is that rock?

1754
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:03,500
Am I going the right way?

1755
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:04,580
Oh, no.

1756
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:10,600
Like, it says, like, the colossi is, like, right here.

1757
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:11,660
Am I going the right way?

1758
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:12,340
Go back?

1759
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:12,860

This is a cave.

1769
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:10,860
You don't need a license to be a life coach.

1770
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,320
You just gotta win at life.

I cannot climb the tail?

1803
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:06,660
Okay, I figured it's not the tail.

1804
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:09,460
It's not the tail.

1805
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:15,700
Oh, I have to climb the fucking legs.

1806

Oh, I can't shoot that.

1808
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:29,380
I can't shoot that.

1809
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:29,680
Arlo!

1810
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:30,520
Arlo!

1811
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,580
Arlo!

1812
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:31,840
Arlo!

1813
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:33,900

1814
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,100
Arlo!

Alright.

02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:48,700
Oh, God.

1820
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:54,360
All right, I didn't lead him to the geyser before.

1821
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:57,240
Does he have to go to the geyser again?

1822
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:00,020
Come to the geyser.

1823
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:04,440
Come to the geyser.

1824
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,700
Look at this funny geyser.

1825
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:09,100
That's what I assume I have to do.

1826
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,920
Oh, it has to be perfectly under his shell.

1827
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:15,080
Oh, okay.

1828
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:20,540
Oh, is that a shell?

1829
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:22,980
That is!

1830
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:25,940
Oh my god, that is!

1831
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,300
How is that non-climbing?

1832
02:03:37,210 --> 02:03:38,970

1833
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:39,250
Please!

1834
02:03:40,530 --> 02:03:41,270
Get out!

1835
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:48,130
How do I flip him over?

1836
02:03:49,110 --> 02:03:49,610
Help!

02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:58,660

Do not worry.

1871
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:43,110
I am here to coach you!

1872
02:06:46,470 --> 02:06:48,250
Where the fuck is it?

1873
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:53,370
Where do I coach him?

1874
02:06:54,650 --> 02:06:56,550
Where do I?

1875
02:06:56,570 --> 02:06:57,610
I do!

1876
02:06:58,150 --> 02:06:59,930
My sword is literally up!

1877
02:07:01,570 --> 02:07:01,830
No!

1878
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:06,250
Over!

1879
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:08,550
This is the fucker flip!

1880
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:10,310
Where's the guys here?

1881
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:13,710
Oh my god, where the fuck's the guys?

1882
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:20,290
I didn't know where he comes so lost in peace.

1883
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:22,590
Okay, I understand now.

1884
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:23,770
I understand.

1885
02:07:25,150 --> 02:07:26,790
I understand now, guys.

1886
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:28,350
I figured it out, guys.

1887
02:07:28,490 --> 02:07:29,690
Don't be disappointed in me.

1888
02:07:29,870 --> 02:07:30,670
I figured it out.

1889
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:32,030
It took me.

1890
02:07:34,970 --> 02:07:39,330
Look, every person I coach in life is different, okay?

1891
02:07:39,870 --> 02:07:47,170
So, like, because of that, I have to, like, figure out what
they want, what they want in front of their lives.

1892
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:49,330
It's okay, I figured it out.

1893
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:50,570
I just need them to get closer.

1894
02:07:51,290 --> 02:07:51,810
Get closer!

1895
02:07:53,730 --> 02:07:54,470
Get closer!

1896
02:07:55,790 --> 02:07:57,550
Okay, Arlo, please don't get close to me.

1897
02:07:57,650 --> 02:07:59,130
I'm talking about this guy.

1898
02:08:00,210 --> 02:08:01,150
Get him on, get over here.

1899
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:02,230
Walk over here!

1900
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:03,210
Walk!

1901
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:05,530
Bro, you can't just be lazy!

1902
02:08:05,850 --> 02:08:07,790
Your mom tells you to go outside!

1903
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:10,250
Okay.

1904
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:12,470
Okay, that is on you, Arlo.

1905
02:08:13,070 --> 02:08:13,710
Okay, that is on you, Arlo.

1906
02:08:14,190 --> 02:08:16,770
That is 100% on you, Arlo.

1907
02:08:17,150 --> 02:08:18,310
That is not on me.

1908
02:08:18,910 --> 02:08:21,210
That is not on me, man.

1909
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:22,130
What the fuck?

1910
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:23,810
How is he able to do that?

1911
02:08:25,010 --> 02:08:25,650
Oh, wait.

1912
02:08:25,770 --> 02:08:26,290
He gets to...

1913
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:27,830
Oh, he's talking falls again.

1914
02:08:28,190 --> 02:08:31,010
Oh, I just need to take him to the geyser all the time.

1915
02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:32,370
I get it now.

1916
02:08:33,470 --> 02:08:34,390
I get it.

1917
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:36,370
Go, go, go, go.

1918
02:08:36,730 --> 02:08:37,210
Go.

1919
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:38,730
Go, Doki, go.

1920
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:41,790
Okay.

1921
02:08:42,350 --> 02:08:42,670
Okay.

1922
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:45,170
How do I?

1923
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:46,350
Go.

1924
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:50,050

Okay, I'm just going to hold on.

1938
02:09:20,610 --> 02:09:21,070
Yeah!

1939
02:09:21,530 --> 02:09:21,990

Holy shit.

1948
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:38,090
What do I do?

1949
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:39,550
What do I do?

1950
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:40,550
I'm stuck.

1951
02:09:42,070 --> 02:09:42,970
Oh god.

1952
02:09:43,730 --> 02:09:49,550

fucking made it, oh!

1953
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:58,450
Grip, grip, where the fuck is this fucking, where the fuck
is the acupuncture hole?

1954
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:07,930
Oh, there he is, look, I don't want to do this, but your mom
was very specific in her instructions.

1955
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:22,990
look you have to get out of that cave bro your mom said
you've been living in that cave for 20 years after college

1956
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:37,330
you haven't seen the day yet it's like big brother but it's
like a one-man show you have to touch grass your mom is so

1957
02:10:37,330 --> 02:10:41,050
worried But don't worry, your personal life coach is here.

1958
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:44,410
And I'm here to get rid of all your worries here.

1959
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:49,730
This is like a patented dokey bird special.

1960
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:52,550
Attack you, man.

1961
02:10:54,090 --> 02:10:56,090
This is what life coaches are for.

1962
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:57,030
Do not worry.

1963
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:01,690
Look, you have to go outside.

1964
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:03,310
Go to that gym.

1965
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:06,290
And like, touch some grass, man.

1966
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:08,510
worried.

1967
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:10,910
I say, what do I do?

1968
02:11:11,130 --> 02:11:12,750
Let's not think about that.

1969
02:11:15,170 --> 02:11:17,130
When did the last time I went outside?

1970
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:18,110
Let's see.

1971
02:11:18,210 --> 02:11:19,950
Look, I am your life coach.

1972
02:11:20,430 --> 02:11:23,010
My life coach handles me and not you.

1973
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:28,330
That's different.

1974
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:37,420
We did it.

1975
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:41,780
Doki Bird, life coach, vet, massage therapist, and
lobotomous.

1976
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:45,420
Thank you, Thank you.

1977
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:50,000
Yeah, thank you again, first name.

1978
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:54,180
Yay, I did it.

1979
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:55,240

1980
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:56,040
Look at him!

1981
02:11:56,220 --> 02:11:58,240
He's ready to go outside!

1982
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:00,640
I took him to grass.

1983
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:06,140
That is a job well done for the Doki Bird professional life
coach.

1984
02:12:06,820 --> 02:12:11,520
I coached him so hard that he went outside and touched some
grass.

1985
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:14,280
Good for him.

1986
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:24,960
He's so full of life And so alive Oh my god And his mom
carried me back to the temple

1987
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:39,880
Yay Another job well done How many more colossi Do I have
left?

1988
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:42,060

Now you're gonna meet those colossi Arlo riding skills Okay

1992
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:03,630
An isolated sand dune.

1993
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:05,410
Its tracks are well hidden.

1994
02:13:05,870 --> 02:13:09,130
I was six left.

1995
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:10,770

1996
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:11,170
Okay.

1997
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:13,130
I thought I did ten.

1998
02:13:25,110 --> 02:13:25,830
What did I do?

1999
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:27,250

Okay, let's see where it is.

2008
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:10,970

Okay.

2010
02:14:11,630 --> 02:14:12,070

02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:23,090
It's this way.

2016
02:14:23,290 --> 02:14:23,530
Okay.

2017
02:14:25,190 --> 02:14:25,190
Think?

2018
02:14:25,450 --> 02:14:26,290
It has to be.

2019
02:14:26,570 --> 02:14:27,750
Is it across the ocean again?

2020
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:41,250
my true passion being a very licensed massage parlor owner

2026
02:15:05,870 --> 02:15:06,690
Let's see.

2027
02:15:07,670 --> 02:15:09,670
I don't cross this area.

2028
02:15:12,090 --> 02:15:12,730
Here?

2029
02:15:13,490 --> 02:15:16,090
Here, and then I go all the way over there.

02:15:20,030 --> 02:15:25,330

little late.

2035
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:07,510
My sword GPS is a little faulty.

2036
02:16:11,410 --> 02:16:12,490

Where is the...

2047
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:39,830
Where is the sand?

2048
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:41,490
This is not the sand.

2049
02:16:42,230 --> 02:16:43,230
Is it going the right way?

2050
02:16:43,390 --> 02:16:43,890
I am.

2051
02:16:44,110 --> 02:16:45,470
This is the only way to go.

2052
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:48,710
Right?

2053
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:50,950
Yeah, because that's the ocean.

2054
02:16:51,850 --> 02:16:53,410
So the sand has to be nearby.

2055
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:55,670
Because when there's an ocean, there's sand.

2056
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:58,030
It's on a cave?

2057
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:04,740
I had to fucking go downstairs?

2058
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:06,040
No way.

2059
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:06,980
There's no way.

2060
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,420
Is it Doki a horse girl?

2061
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:11,940
I'm actually not a horse girl.

2062
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:13,600
I never got to be a horse girl.

2063
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:23,880
So now, because I never got to be a horse girl, I can live
through it now.

2064
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:26,500
Because I never got a chance to.

2065
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:29,740
I get to see what it was like to be a horse girl.

2066
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:34,740
All right.

2067
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:37,620
Let's see.

2068
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:39,020
I don't think it's here.

2069
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:39,640
Is it not?

2070
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:41,680
Where the fuck is the desert?

2071
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,360
Why does it keep pointing down?

2072
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:47,680
Oh, it's because I keep walking down.

2073
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:54,170
I was like, what is my sword?

2074
02:17:54,670 --> 02:17:56,930
Okay, that makes a lot more sense.

2075
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:57,990
Okay, it's this way.

2076
02:17:58,430 --> 02:17:58,790
All right.

2077
02:17:59,230 --> 02:18:00,590
Guys, I figured it out.

2078
02:18:00,710 --> 02:18:05,730
If you look down the sword, the sword GPS.

2079
02:18:06,590 --> 02:18:09,070
That game takes me downstairs.

2080
02:18:10,170 --> 02:18:11,850
So I just need to not look down.

2081
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:12,470
Oh, hey.

2082
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:13,930
Maybe I can grab some HP.

2083
02:18:14,290 --> 02:18:15,370
If I grab HP from here...

2084
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:16,170
Oh, my God.

2085
02:18:16,230 --> 02:18:17,610
I thought I was going to fucking die.

2086
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:20,790
I thought Arlo was going to send me down to the cliffs.

2087
02:18:21,650 --> 02:18:24,170
Okay, did I chew the fruit from here before?

2088
02:18:24,590 --> 02:18:25,490
No, oh, I didn't.

2089
02:18:25,670 --> 02:18:25,850
Alright.

2090
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:28,030
Okay, whoops.

2091
02:18:28,370 --> 02:18:29,310
That was the camera.

2092
02:18:30,970 --> 02:18:31,390
Alright.

2093
02:18:31,770 --> 02:18:32,210
Boop.

2094
02:18:32,370 --> 02:18:33,650
That has to be one of the fruits.

2095
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:48,790
eat nice yeah I don't have a lot of stamina I haven't been

Okay, time to go to Snake Boy.

2099
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:11,950
The fuck?

2100
02:19:12,290 --> 02:19:12,770
Oh, nope.

2101
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:14,950
GPS sword.

2102
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:16,270
Where do you... Oh, sorry.

2103
02:19:16,510 --> 02:19:17,090
Not in the sun.

2104
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:19,090
GPS sword.

2105
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:20,710
Tell me where to go!

2106
02:19:24,250 --> 02:19:26,230
Alright, GPS sword has spoken.

2107
02:19:27,090 --> 02:19:27,510
Alright, Arlo.

2108
02:19:27,990 --> 02:19:28,990
Get over here.

2109
02:19:29,650 --> 02:19:30,170
Look.

2110
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:31,410
I'm a good owner.

2111
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:34,130
All right, Arlo.

2112
02:19:35,470 --> 02:19:37,890
Apparently I need you to help me with the snake.

2113
02:19:39,930 --> 02:19:41,250
It's always a cave.

2114
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:42,970
Why are they always all in caves?

2115
02:19:44,490 --> 02:19:45,950
What happened to them?

2116
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:49,370
Why is it always a cave?

2117
02:19:51,670 --> 02:19:53,130
This has to be sad, right?

2118
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:55,070
This is it?

2119
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:57,830
No, that's not sad.

2120
02:19:58,030 --> 02:19:59,210
That's normal grass.

2121
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:02,210
No one tells...

2122
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:02,970
Oh, oh, shrine!

2123
02:20:03,730 --> 02:20:04,130
Shrine!

2124
02:20:05,470 --> 02:20:06,690
Wait, have I been to the shrine before?

2125
02:20:07,430 --> 02:20:08,010
No, I haven't.

2126
02:20:08,070 --> 02:20:08,530
This is new.

2127
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:10,770
Oh, God.

2128
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:11,030
Okay.

2129
02:20:11,590 --> 02:20:12,010
Alright, Arlo.

2130
02:20:12,790 --> 02:20:13,550
Oh, there it is!

2131
02:20:13,570 --> 02:20:14,170
There's a cave!

2132
02:20:15,630 --> 02:20:16,930
There's a sand cave!

2133
02:20:17,230 --> 02:20:20,130
I knew my GPS sword will take me to the right place.

2134
02:20:21,310 --> 02:20:22,550
Okay, time to pray.

2135
02:20:23,010 --> 02:20:24,690
Wait, this is not... Wait, what?

2136
02:20:26,270 --> 02:20:28,370
Okay, I was like, wait a minute.

2137
02:20:28,990 --> 02:20:29,590
Time to pray.

2138
02:20:31,090 --> 02:20:32,670
Alright, where the fuck is the gecko?

2139
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:38,730
Now that I've fixed the iguana problem, this should be...

2140
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:39,650
Oh, there he is.

2141
02:20:43,710 --> 02:20:44,410
Arlo, please.

2142
02:20:45,530 --> 02:20:45,770
Okay.

2143
02:20:46,530 --> 02:20:47,230
Is he dead dead?

2144
02:20:47,610 --> 02:20:47,830
No.

2145
02:20:48,170 --> 02:20:48,850
Now he is.

2146
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:49,330
Alright.

2147
02:20:49,730 --> 02:20:50,850
You always gotta double tap.

2148
02:20:51,310 --> 02:20:51,890
What the fuck?

2149
02:20:52,630 --> 02:20:53,210
You're a lie?

2150
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:54,290
Oh, it's okay.

2151
02:20:54,330 --> 02:20:55,550
He can regrow the tail!

2152
02:20:56,410 --> 02:21:01,370
I let him live on purpose because I found out you can regrow
the tail.

2153
02:21:01,750 --> 02:21:05,250
You come back to the shrine and then the tail will grow
back.

2154
02:21:06,210 --> 02:21:13,950
real just from from the dokeybird exclusive you guys might
not know that it's like a hidden easter egg the tail will

2155
02:21:13,950 --> 02:21:19,870
regrow so you have to you have to like the thing is you have
to like shoot it at the tail at the right part of the tail

2156
02:21:19,870 --> 02:21:27,150
so like um because mostly people when they shoot it they
kill the lizard but like if you're as skilled as me you can

2157
02:21:27,150 --> 02:21:33,990
shoot at the tail that only the tail comes off and not the
lizard the lizard doesn't die so like i know like a lot of

2158
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:46,550
people might not as me but like but here's a little pro tip
it's a one frame trick that I mastered also you have to

2159
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:52,370
shoot at the right angle so like you come back to the shrine
and then the lizard will have is how you can farm unlimited

2160
02:21:52,370 --> 02:22:03,050
stamina all right how the fuck do I kill the snake let's
ride around and just jump on the back oh Oh, God.

2161
02:22:05,610 --> 02:22:06,930
He seems very angry.

2162
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:09,530
Do not worry.

2163
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:10,210
Oh, my God.

2164
02:22:10,290 --> 02:22:11,230
It's the anger stress.

2165
02:22:11,410 --> 02:22:13,050
You know, when you're so stressed out, you're just angry.

2166
02:22:13,810 --> 02:22:14,370
That's just him.

2167
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:14,830
Don't worry.

2168
02:22:14,930 --> 02:22:17,770
That's why I got hired in the first place.

2169
02:22:18,410 --> 02:22:19,530
My word of mouth.

2170
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:22,590
My word of mouth is working.

2171
02:22:22,970 --> 02:22:26,790
I don't need to waste money advertising and getting YouTube
ads.

2172
02:22:27,610 --> 02:22:31,250
My happy clients are advertising about my great...

2173
02:22:31,610 --> 02:22:35,690
My great, um, my great work ethics.

2174
02:22:37,890 --> 02:22:39,430
How do I fucking kill him?

2175
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:42,510
Don't step on the snake, but what if I want to step on the
snake?

2176
02:22:46,550 --> 02:22:48,330
What the fuck?

2177
02:22:49,390 --> 02:22:50,050
What the fuck?

2178
02:22:52,150 --> 02:22:55,330
Oh, wait, I'm getting sucked in!

2179
02:22:56,430 --> 02:22:58,390
Come on, I get it, I get it.

2180
02:23:01,610 --> 02:23:03,490
Okay, I get it now.

2181
02:23:03,890 --> 02:23:05,030
I was getting sucked in.

2182
02:23:05,230 --> 02:23:06,110
I was losing HP.

2183
02:23:06,470 --> 02:23:09,450
I just realized I was losing HP.

2184
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:17,310
I was like, whoa, I definitely did not fucking have that low
HP when I started.

2185
02:23:19,870 --> 02:23:21,470
I couldn't tell.

2186
02:23:22,190 --> 02:23:24,110
I couldn't tell, guys.

2187
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:26,090

2188
02:23:27,090 --> 02:23:27,570

2197
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:42,150
The most expensive acupuncture job out there is the eye of
acupuncture.

2198
02:24:42,750 --> 02:24:44,730
Like you gotta be super...

2199

Where do I?

2205
02:24:59,570 --> 02:24:59,970
Where do I?

2206
02:25:02,830 --> 02:25:04,190
There we go.

2207
02:25:05,270 --> 02:25:06,430
Eye acupuncture.

2208
02:25:12,150 --> 02:25:14,230
Do not worry.

2209
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:18,250
Okay, oh, I found it instantly.

2210
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:24,610
Yes, for when you shoot the eye, you reveal all the stress
points.

2211
02:25:27,050 --> 02:25:28,950
Yeah, that guy has some fucking...

2212
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:30,930
That's when you know.

2213
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:36,370
Like that eye, you know he needed eye acupuncture right
there.

2214
02:25:36,610 --> 02:25:39,010
I basically relieved all the eye stress from him.

2215
02:25:39,830 --> 02:25:41,250
Oh shit, he fucking buried me.

2216
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:42,070
Oh my god, okay.

2217
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:44,570
Arlo, Arlo, Arlo.

2218
02:25:45,350 --> 02:25:46,750
We gotta get the other eye, Arlo.

2219
02:25:47,810 --> 02:25:49,570
Oh my god, I need a fucking eye.

2220
02:25:50,250 --> 02:25:51,050
Arlo, don't worry.

2221
02:25:52,750 --> 02:25:53,470
Don't worry, Arlo.

2222
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:57,230
I am a professional.

2223
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:01,370
Okay, he has to go this way, right?

2224
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:01,630
Right?

2225
02:26:02,570 --> 02:26:04,350
Yeah, he has to follow me from behind.

2226
02:26:04,490 --> 02:26:05,170
What the fuck?

2227
02:26:05,970 --> 02:26:06,890
Now he can jump.

2228
02:26:07,850 --> 02:26:09,350
That's when you know he liked it.

2229
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:16,110
It's okay, it's because he's been looking at the PC.

2230
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:23,330
When you look at the PC for too long for a lot for when you
look at the PC for too long for like majority of your life,

2231
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:25,430
you gotta get acupuncture.

2232
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:28,610
But like you have to get it with a real professional like
me.

2233
02:26:28,610 --> 02:26:36,770
So if you have, if you see this license from any specialist,
um, that's what, that, like, my particular license states

2234
02:26:36,770 --> 02:26:40,590
that, like, I am allowed to perform IQ puncher.

2235
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:43,610

2245
02:27:40,970 --> 02:27:44,050

I'm really glad I actually got a chance.

2303

very first time.

02:31:57,660 --> 02:31:59,580
But I'm going to do something about Super Chat Reading.

2307
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:01,680
We haven't done those in so long.

2308
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:03,460
Because I've always been so busy.

2309

And I still am very busy.

2310
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:10,080

like I'm pretty sure it's not even out in public.

No, most of the Game Boy games I played were, like, Pokemon.

2434
02:43:37,590 --> 02:43:45,870
And I remember I played the Pokemon one, the Dragon Ball Z
game, where it was, like, an RPG-esque one.

2435
02:43:46,430 --> 02:43:52,430
And then, I really, a lot of the Pokemon, like, a lot of the
Game Boy games I had were...

2436
02:43:53,190 --> 02:43:54,410
I'm trying to remember.

2437
02:43:54,530 --> 02:43:58,750
I literally only remember the most of the games I remember,
which is Pokemon.

2438
02:44:00,010 --> 02:44:02,070
But, like, you know, like, when you're, like...

2439
02:44:02,090 --> 02:44:08,950
I don't know if this is like an Asian kid thing or like like
any kid thing But like my mom would buy me these little like

2440
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:16,350
boxes and I just chuck my game cardages in there Like I just
have these little I think they're like I think they're like

2441
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:23,350
IKEA boxes Like those like little IKEA tiny boxes and stuff
And they were like green like they're like neon is s colors

2442
02:44:23,350 --> 02:44:30,210
And then like we would just chuck them chuck all the
cardages there in there And then I just like browse through

2443
02:44:30,210 --> 02:44:39,810
and try to find the game to play But, um, uh, I don't
remember what game I played, like, what other games I have

2444
02:44:39,810 --> 02:44:46,070
other than Pokemon and, uh, Pokemon and that Dragon Ball Z
game, because I play that Dragon Ball Z game for a fucking

2445
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:46,530
ever.

2446
02:44:50,030 --> 02:44:55,010
I never played that fucking Dragon Ball Z game for so
fucking long.

2447
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:58,470
Um, so it's, like, embedded into my memory.

2448
02:44:58,590 --> 02:45:02,070
Any RPG, the RPG one, it's like, it was like semi-RPG.

2449
02:45:02,090 --> 02:45:02,950
I remember

2450
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:16,280
um I don't know I need to like look it up I can't like
remember on top of my head what what it was but I I found

2451
02:45:16,280 --> 02:45:22,660
out that like a lot of the game boy games like a lot of the
game boy games like game boy advanced or whatever or just

2452
02:45:22,660 --> 02:45:30,440
normal game boy like the cartridges like it has a battery in
there and it can expire I didn't realize that I thought like

2453
02:45:30,440 --> 02:45:31,820
you know it's like a CD.

2454
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:35,800
It never dies, except like, I don't know, if it's like super
scratched up or stuff.

2455
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:40,200
But I didn't realize, like, a lot of them have, like, a
little battery built in.

2456
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:45,140
So, like, a lot of the old games are like the same, yeah,
for the save file.

2457
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:52,000
Like, a lot of the old games and stuff, they don't really
work anymore because there's no, the battery, the battery

2458
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:52,760
just dies.

2459
02:45:55,260 --> 02:45:57,060
The, yeah, the save games and stuff.

2460
02:45:57,140 --> 02:45:58,300
Yeah, it can die down.

2461
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:06,500
Uh, so they expire, yeah, I didn't realize that, so you
might lose your saves soon in a couple of years!

2462
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:12,120
Or replace the battery, they can recharge, or they have to
replace them and recharge it.

2463
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:18,020
Um, I thought it was super interesting, uh, that, like, I
didn't realize there were, like, batteries inside the

2464
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:18,640
cartridges.

2465
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:21,920

2526
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:06,460
Is that good?

2527
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:09,480
I don't know.

2528
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:09,860
I don't know.

2529
02:49:09,960 --> 02:49:11,400
I don't know how smart you have to be in the Air Force.

2530
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:13,020
I guess you need to know physics, right?

2531
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:17,300
Like...

2532
02:49:17,300 --> 02:49:20,000
Not all of the Air Force fly planes, though.

2533
02:49:20,080 --> 02:49:22,120
Then why do they call the Air Force?

2534
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:24,040
Like...

2535
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:24,880
What's the point?

2536
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:27,980
Then what?

2537
02:49:28,120 --> 02:49:28,840
Ground Force?

2538
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:36,100
You might as well be the fucking land force If you're not
all of them, we're gonna fly Yes, I don't know I don't know

2539
02:49:36,100 --> 02:49:40,660
if the air force Requires you to be smart I don't know

2540
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:59,180
I'm not in the military Why would I know this information
Like I like how you guys Assume I know how smart You have to

2541
02:49:59,180 --> 02:50:08,280

yeah it's in the usd like i'm not american how am i supposed

2542
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:15,860

2543
02:50:15,860 --> 02:50:23,680

where majority of us are just the mounties

2544
02:50:29,400 --> 02:50:30,740

Good luck, Deathwisher.

2548
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:35,280
If you're still here, you'll have a lot of fun.

2549
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:37,940
I wish I joined the Air Force instead, motherfucker.

2550
02:50:38,260 --> 02:50:39,220
Thank you for the super chat.

2551
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:39,820
Thank you, thank you.

2552
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:41,800
Medi, you have to be smart for that.

2553
02:50:45,560 --> 02:50:46,360
Oh my god.

2554
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:48,300
I think the, okay, I don't know.

2555
02:50:48,460 --> 02:50:49,180
Okay, I don't know.

2556
02:50:49,220 --> 02:50:51,520
This might be a little like, whoa, Doki.

2557
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:58,820
But like, I think it's funny that the army in America has
started to recruit in anime conventions.

2558
02:50:58,840 --> 02:51:06,060
I don't know and then they get like cosplay like they hire
like professional cosplayers to stand next to their booth to

2559
02:51:06,060 --> 02:51:12,980
like uh like you know to stand next to their booth to
recruit I don't know I just find that fucking hilarious like

2560
02:51:12,980 --> 02:51:20,180
they're trying to recruit like we like they're trying to
recruit weeds to the army now and I find that so fucking

2561
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:30,960
funny do you guys know that yeah yeah that's a thing for i
didn't realize no but like i didn't notice that until um

2562
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:40,760
until they started hiring professional cosplayers to like
man the booths like really like beautiful anime girls like

2563
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:47,480
standing next to the booth so like to like try and sign up
some like some like i don't know some weaves to join the

2564
02:51:47,480 --> 02:51:56,940
army and i thought i thought it was like pretty funny did
you know like the u.s army has a They're like, they're

2565
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:57,960
targeting everybody.

2566
02:51:58,200 --> 02:51:59,540
They're also targeting gamers.

2567
02:52:00,100 --> 02:52:01,360
Gamers are also not safe.

2568
02:52:01,900 --> 02:52:09,760
Gamers, like, Twitch has an official partner Twitch channel
and where they host, like, tournaments and stuff.

2569
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:17,700
And, like, like, stream, like, stream on Twitch, like, the
arm, like, the soldiers in the, in the U.S.

2570
02:52:17,700 --> 02:52:19,320
Army, like, the members in the U.S.

2571
02:52:19,320 --> 02:52:25,100
Army, they actually do, like, Twitch streams and try to
host, like, like, tournaments because they once host an

2572
02:52:25,100 --> 02:52:26,000
Overwatch tournament.

2573
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:28,880
I remember back then, the U.S.

2574
02:52:28,880 --> 02:52:37,160
Army sponsored an Overwatch tournament, like an Overwatch
Invitational, and I remembered it because, like, one of my,

2575
02:52:37,280 --> 02:52:42,620
like, one of the teams I was in was like, oh my God, we
should, we should, like, you know, sign up for the U.S.

2576
02:52:42,620 --> 02:52:44,120
Army Invitational.

2577
02:52:50,200 --> 02:52:52,160
Yeah, they have official teams.

2578
02:52:52,540 --> 02:52:55,920
They have actual official, like, FPS teams, too.

2579
02:52:56,160 --> 02:52:58,560
It is actually, it is crazy.

2580
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:01,020
They have a Wikipedia.

2581
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:05,660
They sponsor like actual like teams in esports.

2582
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:07,820
Spirit, thank you for the super chat.

2583
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:08,500
Thank you, thank you.

2584
02:53:08,600 --> 02:53:11,760
As someone who's in the Royal Canadian Navy, I can say we do
have an army.

2585
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:17,620
One good thing about our military is that we have better
training than most other militaries, or so they say.

2586
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:19,400
Thank you for the super chat.

2587
02:53:19,740 --> 02:53:19,980
