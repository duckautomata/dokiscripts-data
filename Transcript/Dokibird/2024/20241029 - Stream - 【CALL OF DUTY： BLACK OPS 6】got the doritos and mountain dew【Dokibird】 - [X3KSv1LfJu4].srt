00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,590
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,890
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,010
I'm waiting for like the gamer subs to kick in right now.

4
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,210
I'm so tired.

5
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,010
I'm so fucking tired.

6
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,510
Regular people have done a five.

7
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,390
I have 24-7 work life.

8
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,150
I woke up early today, so yes, I was on an adventure today.

9
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,910
By adventure, I went to the hair salon.

10
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,450
So today, I woke up early today because I went to bed early.

11
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,910
And by early, I meant I went to bed at like 1 in the morning.

12
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:34,730
So I was like, so obviously I woke up at around... well, technically I didn't wake up out of my own free will.

13
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,550
I woke up because dad was like...

14
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,530
Dad, okay, so like, you know, I was like, like I opened my eyes and then Doki and Badoge, he sleeps with me.

15
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,950
So like he was, you know, underneath the covers.

16
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,290
But he could feel that I was awake.

17
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,250
He felt the moment.

18
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,290
So he was like, oh, you're awake, huh?

19
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,790
Oh, you know what that means?

20
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,730
It's feeding time!

21
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,570
So he like jumped down from the bed.

22
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,990
I was like...

23
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,050
AHHHHHH!

24
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,650
I was like, please...

25
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,850
He was like, FOOD TIME!

26
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,470
FEED ME!

27
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,050
FEED ME!

28
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,650
FEED ME!

29
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,290
FEED ME!

30
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,190
I was like, looked at my phone, I was like, please, it's 9 in the morning.

31
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:28,570
I was like, please, you know, you know it's not eating time, but come on.

32
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:37,590
So like, I tried to like ignore him because, um, because it's not good because then it re-reinforces that behavior.

33
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:47,590
Because if you like acknowledge him, acknowledge the dog when he's barking, then he'll be like, oh, I see every time I bark, every time I bark, you will feed me.

34
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,710
So I let him bark for like, five... I don't even know at this point, I don't know how long he was barking.

35
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,910
I just, I was just like, I was just like, this is my life, this is my life.

36
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,590
I was like, he was like, AHHHH!

37
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,330
FEED ME!

38
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:05,870
FEED ME!

39
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,410
FEED ME!

40
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:17,150
And I'm just in my bed staring at the ceiling, and I'm like, I'm just staring at the ceiling, I was like, this will stop, this will stop.

41
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:35,510
So, um, so, um, I like let him have his, you know, have his time for like five, I don't know how long, but then eventually he stopped.

42
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:44,070
I waited a little bit, he like walked out of the room, came back, looked at me, and then I like, and then I got up.

43
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:51,890
I got up, and then I fed him, and then I went back to bed, but I couldn't fall asleep, I couldn't fall asleep.

44
00:04:52,390 --> 00:05:01,850
So I was like, alright, time to get some work done, um, so, you know, I clocked in my hours, because I was like, well, it's gonna be a while until it's my stream time.

45
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:13,150
And I realized, you know, since I'm up really early, I was like, you know, I haven't, you know, I haven't done anything with my hair in a long ass time.

46
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:23,830
So like, I did got it cut a while ago, like three months ago, I think, like, but it was just like a typical cut, and then like lighten, uh, and also like lighten it.

47
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:32,290
So like, because it was getting too long, and I really don't like it when my hair is way too long, because then I hate doing hair maintenance when it's a really long hair.

48
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:43,090
Because like, you know, showering is a little, is a bitch when you have long hair, and um, and just like maintain, like, you know, maintaining it and everything, because I have a really thick set of hair.

49
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:51,690
So I was just like, ah, fuck it, like, you know what, and also like, this is like, people were like, wait, you have like white hair?

50
00:05:52,030 --> 00:06:02,270
Okay, so, for those who don't know, um, for those who don't know, uh, I have a genetic defect where, don't say that.

51
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,670
Doki, that's... why do you call it that?

52
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:20,050
So, I have a genetic defect since I was really young, since I was like, I think like four or five, um, where I occasionally get like white hair.

53
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:31,030
Um, so like, I will have like bits of strands of white hair, and then I, you know, um, I, this seems to be blonde hair, but like, um, I have, you know, black hair.

54
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,390
Uh, sometimes.

55
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,830
My other skin suit has black hair.

56
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,870
Immersion.

57
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,450
Anyway, um, so, it's very noticeable, especially when you're fucking four.

58
00:06:47,990 --> 00:07:01,050
So, um, so, um, basically, um, um, so, you know, I would be like, he was like, you know, teachers would be like, wow, you have white hair.

59
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,210
Like, you know, teachers would judge you and shit, because they're like, why the fuck does this child have white hair?

60
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,430
And I wouldn't notice it, really, because I can't see my own head.

61
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,110
So, like, I didn't, I was like, yeah, why do I have white hair?

62
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,390
I was like, I'm a child.

63
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,330
I'm like, I'm a child.

64
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:31,270
And then, like, you know, my Asian relatives, you know, you know, Asian relatives, they love the gossip and everything and judge you, but try to make it positive, but it's like passive-aggressive judging, you know?

65
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,310
Like, no, what's it called?

66
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,130
Like, fake optimistic judge.

67
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,270
Like, fake optis- uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, what is it called?

68
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:38,970
Optimism?

69
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,590
What is it?

70
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:47,690
When they're trying to, when they're trying to, they're judging you, but they make it as if, like, it's positive, but you know it's not.

71
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,310
Like,

72
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,790
like, uh, optimistic, uh, fake comp- like, what's it called?

73
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,130
Backhanded compliments?

74
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,250
Uh, toxic positivity?

75
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:06,170
I don't know, uh, but, like, you know, uh, guys, like, sorry, I, I, like, slurred my words.

76
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,730
I stumbled.

77
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,890
I meant optim- optimism.

78
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,230
I didn't mean the other.

79
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,370
I didn't mean autism.

80
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,810
I meant opt- guys, please, English is my first language.

81
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:31,850
Anyway, um, um, anyway, so, you know, like, Asian relatives, they say something, and they're trying to, like, pretend it's positive, but you know it's not.

82
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,930
So, um, they were, you know, they would judge me, and I was, like, you know, I was super young.

83
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:49,550
I was, like, four to, like, ten years old, and even, like, even till, like, my teenage years, and they would be, like, wow, why do you keep having- why do you have gray hair, and white hair, and everything?

84
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,530
So, I've been dying my hair since I was four.

85
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:03,550
So, my mom would always take me to hair salons since I was four to, like, dye my hair so I don't get judged by my Asian relatives, because it's all about, like, the image.

86
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,070
Like, you know, I didn't give a fuck.

87
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:13,050
I was four, but, you know, like, you know, it's all about upholding that image that I'm not a freak.

88
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:31,050
So, um, so, um, yeah, um, anyway, um, um, um, so, basically, uh, the reason- and then, like, I, you know, I was confused.

89
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,330
I was, like, why do I have white hair?

90
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,370
Like, I'm just, like, why do I have white hair?

91
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,390
Why doesn't all the other kids have white hair?

92
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,810
I thought you'd get white hair when you're old.

93
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:51,550
And so, um, so, um, you know, like, what my parents would tell me, you know, like, lie to you.

94
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,110
You know, your parents don't want to tell you the real reason, so they lie to you.

95
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:10,570
So the lie they told me when I was growing up, they're like, oh, it's because you're so smart, because you're always thinking, and because you're always thinking, you know, you're you grow white hair because you're always thinking.

96
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,790
And I was like, that makes sense.

97
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,150
Like, I was like, wow, I'm so smart.

98
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,090
That makes sense.

99
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,610
Yeah, that's why I got white hair.

100
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,690
I'm always thinking.

101
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,510
There's so much in my mind.

102
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:36,370
And later on, I found out, um, I found out it's because, um, what is it called?

103
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,270
Is it melanin?

104
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,850
I, oh my gosh, hair produce color.

105
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,330
What is it called?

106
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,690
Um, yeah, melanin.

107
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:53,070
So I don't have enough pigment colors to produce the colors needed to, to, you know, to keep up with the colors.

108
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,530
So, uh, I don't have enough melanin for it.

109
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,050
That's why I have white hair.

110
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:06,370
So, you know, I've been dying my, like, not, not, you know, not like out of choice.

111
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,490
Like my parents would just take me to the hair salon.

112
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,190
Like, I don't really care that much to be honest.

113
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,970
Uh, so, uh, I just don't have enough melanin to, yeah, I just, I ran out of ink, basically.

114
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,090
If you want to talk, speaking of ink, I need you guys to help me buy a printer.

115
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,150
I need to order a printer on Amazon.

116
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:30,210
So I have, like, after the stream, you're, after, like, Call of Duty, you guys are going to help me buy a printer, order a printer, because I don't know what printer you get.

117
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,550
Anyway, uh, and also a kettle.

118
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,630
Anyway, as I was saying, so, basically, I don't have enough ink to produce the color and that's why I get white hair.

119
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,170
So, I haven't dyed.

120
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,010
I've been so busy and there was no reason for me to dye my hair for a long time.

121
00:11:48,470 --> 00:12:04,930
Um, and also, like, um, in the past, I've gone to, like, my mom's, uh, best friend and her husband's hair salon for, like, I think, like, for since I was four, but, like, I don't like them.

122
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,200
Because I, I just feel like, so, like, you know, for, I haven't dyed my hair.

123
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,040
Um, okay, there's, like, family drama regarding that.

124
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,740
Uh, there's, like, it's so, there's, I don't know, I just find them weird.

125
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:42,640
I, I find them, okay, so, TLDR, I'll give you guys a TL, I'll talk, I'll tell the story at another time, but TLDR, um, um, like, the best friend, um, you know, and her husband, they, they, they opened a hair salon together.

126
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:59,240
Um, so, they used to work together and everything and, uh, and they have, like, three kids together, um, and everything and they had, like, three houses together and, like, she, like, they were, like, award-winning hairstylists, so they've done, like,

127
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:17,920
Miss Canada pageants and everything, like, they've done, like, hairs for, like, really big people, like, celebrities and stuff, and then, um, and then, all of nowhere, she suddenly divorced him after, you know, having three kids and they bought a new house together and,

128
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,380
no, they're, like, house flippers.

129
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,340
They weren't, like, actually, they were house flippers, too, on top of, like, uh, doing hair stuff.

130
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,000
So, after the third kid, like, when the kid was, like, two to three years old, after the third kid, they divorced.

131
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,720
I think they have four kids, actually.

132
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,920
I don't know, three kids or four kids.

133
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,100
I, I lost track of all the children because there were so many.

134
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:52,200
Um, she, out of nowhere, suddenly divorced him because she was, like, I want to find, like, I, like, she's, like, you are not in my path, like, you are not part of, like, my journey and, you know, he's, like, in love with her and everything.

135
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,820
Even he was, like, what the fuck, like He was, like, oh, what the fuck happened?

136
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,100
And then, and then she became, like, incredibly spiritual and everything.

137
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:14,520
So she became incredibly spiritual and, like, does, like, and then she ended up, like, dating this other guy that was, like, oh my god, how do I explain?

138
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
I didn't like him either.

139
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:31,180
Like, I remember, like, because I had to get my, like, you know, I had to get my hair, like, my annual, like, my, not annual, but, like, you know, I get my hair dyed and stuff and cut and then, um, and then, so I had to, like, go to her house and stuff and then,

140
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,340
like, meet her boyfriend and then, like, and he was, like, how do I explain this?

141
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,160
He's a hippie.

142
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,780
Like, that's, like, the best way, the best, the best way to explain it.

143
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,060
He's a hippie.

144
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:53,900
So, like, you know, I don't like wearing shoes type deal and, like, um, um, vegetarian, I don't know if he was vegetarian, vegan.

145
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,720
I don't remember.

146
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,340
It was, it was a long time ago.

147
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,200
It was so, I don't know.

148
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:11,860
And then, like, um, and then, like, he would make the dog, like, he, like, I don't know, no offense to those who, like, cook for your dog, but, like, he would feed the dog human food, too.

149
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:22,400
So, like, he would, he cooked dinner for us and he cooked the same meal for the dog as well and then had, like, the dog eat at the table and, like, it's just, and he doesn't have a job.

150
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,640
So, like, it's just weird.

151
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,300
I...

152
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,000
It's just, it's just weird.

153
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:50,760
And then, um, so he's, like, living off of her and stuff and then, um, yeah, and then, um, I, it was, and I, I just felt weird getting my hair done at, like, her house at that point, like, not even a house, her, like, apartment.

154
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,340
I, it felt weird getting my hair done at her apartment.

155
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:06,040
And then she tried to make a documentary about hair and, like, try to ask, like, everybody she knew for money to fund this documentary about hair and I, it was, it's so weird.

156
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,620
I, that's why I was, like, oh my god, I can finally, like, decide where to get my own hair done.

157
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,740
I don't want to go to her or the husband anymore for, like, majority of my life.

158
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:24,120
Um, I basically got my hair done by them because, like, like, you know, like, it's, like, you know, friend, friend discount and stuff.

159
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,980
Yeah, so, that's her.

160
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,620
The husband, sorry, this ended up not being a TLDR.

161
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,620
There's so much more, though, to be honest.

162
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,220
The husband became bachelor crazy, as in he became a playboy.

163
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,080
I don't know, that's, that's the best I could describe it.

164
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,800
He became a fucking, he became a playboy.

165
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,720
Because he was like, he's like, I'll never find love again.

166
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:06,880
And then, like, and then, like, it got to the point where my dad hated hanging out with him because he would always try to hang out, ask my dad to hang out, and then he was like, I don't want to hang out with him, man.

167
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,400
It's so depressing, like.

168
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:25,620
Like, I remember, like, overhearing conversations between my parents because they're like, oh, yeah, like, hey, um, you know, she, her, the husband, like, and then, and then they would never call, they would call him, like, this, the, the, like, oh, my best friend's husband wants to hang out with you.

169
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,300
And then my dad would be like, I don't want to hang out with him, man.

170
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,900
It's so depressing, like, like, he just wants to do this, and I, it's just, I don't know.

171
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,020
Um, and I was just like, what the fuck?

172
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,200
Um, um, but anyway, so, yeah.

173
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,200
That's, like, I'm happy I don't have to get my hair done by, like, either of them anymore.

174
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:04,100
So, basically, I haven't got my hair done in a year, like, an actual, like, hair done type deal.

175
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,640
So, um, I went to the, I, I was like, I have time.

176
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:15,220
I'm gonna do, like, I was checking appointments and stuff, like, the nearest spot nearby, and they had an appointment at, like, 12 p.m., like, walk-in type deal.

177
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,860
Like, I don't know.

178
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,580
I scheduled appointments, like, anybody would do.

179
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,540
I don't really care, like, like, I don't really care that much.

180
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:33,960
At best, I just wanted to dye, I just wanted to correct the white hair and everything so that I don't have to worry too much about, you know, I, you know, I just want to be like, you know what, it's been a year plus, even more maybe, it's been a year plus,

181
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,900
oh my god, definitely more than a year, like, half a year, almost, like, two years since I got my hair done.

182
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:49,340
And I was like, oh yeah, lots of, you know, I, since I haven't, like, touched up my hair, I was like, all right, I'm gonna go, like, you know, cover up the white hair and white strands and stuff.

183
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,620
And, um, and so, like, I was like, 12 p.m., that's fine.

184
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,900
Like, it mostly, like, it says, like, it should be quick.

185
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:09,320
And I went in and the guy was like, um, the guy was like, oh, um, oh my god, your hair is too different.

186
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:18,960
Your hair, like, because, like, you know, I didn't keep it consistent, so, like, the bottom was, like, brownish and then the top was black.

187
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:26,840
And then, so, they were like, wow, like, you might need a full cover because it's inconsistent.

188
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,940
And I was like, what a full cover?

189
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,460
He's like, yeah, like, you gotta, we gotta do a full dye job because, like, this is, like, you can't just touch this up.

190
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,540
You have to, you know.

191
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,220
And then, like, I have full strands of white hair.

192
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,480
It's not, like, it's at the top.

193
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,480
It's, like, it grew and everything.

194
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:51,200
And then, so I was like, oh, okay, how much would that cost?

195
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,760
And then he was like, well, we have to do this and then we have to do that.

196
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,140
We gotta do scalp protection.

197
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,000
And he's like, you wanna, you wanna, like, use this different dye?

198
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,880
I don't even know what they're called because I was like, there's so much, there's, like, new things.

199
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,200
Like, and then, because, you know, usually when I was at the salon, I'd just be like, I don't care, just, like, and then, like, my mom would be like, she wants to do this, this, this.

200
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,080
And I'm like, oh, shit, now I have to decide all of this myself.

201
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:25,440
And then, and then they were like, yeah, like, we could do, use this type of dye, which is healthier for your scalp because it burns less and, like, it doesn't burn or, like, it's, like, it smells better and everything.

202
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,360
And I was just like, oh, okay.

203
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,120
It was $300.

204
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,840
It was a $300 salon trip.

205
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,160
I, I booked for, I booked for $100.

206
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,460
It was $300.

207
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,560
It was a $300.

208
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,200
Being a woman, fucking suck.

209
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:58,990
You guys would be like, no, no, no, this is what happens when you're a lady and you're trying to go to a salon.

210
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:05,450
This is what it's, no, trust me, like, it is what it's like when you're a woman going to a hair salon.

211
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,610
It's so fucking expensive.

212
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:15,350
It's actually, like, um, cause guys, it's just snip, snip, leave.

213
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,610
It's like, that's why people buy, like, like those box dyes.

214
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,450
I don't know how to use box dyes.

215
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,230
So that's why people, and it's not that healthy for your head too.

216
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,250
Um, so like when, cause like guys, it's easy.

217
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,610
We have to like, Oh my God.

218
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,390
I sat there for three hours.

219
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,030
I sat there for three hours getting my hair done.

220
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,710
And then also I had to get a little cut.

221
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,230
Cause I was like, I, you know, I didn't want to worry about cutting my hair another time.

222
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,630
I was like, I fucking, I'm already paying for expensive dye job.

223
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,510
So I might as well, I might as well fucking snip, snip my hair.

224
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,970
Wash, give me a massage too.

225
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,250
Like, you know, when you're at a nice salon, like it wasn't even like the best salon out there.

226
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,150
Like I literally was so close by.

227
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,510
And then they like massage your head.

228
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,990
I was like, pay $300, massage my head more.

229
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,350
He was like, do you want me to massage more?

230
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,230
I was like, yes.

231
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,870
I might as well.

232
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,190
That's the only free thing I get out of $300.

233
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,550
Keep massaging my head.

234
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:36,050
Like, uh, make this worth it.

235
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,190
Um, and he gave me free snacks.

236
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,690
It was really nice to be fair.

237
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,130
Cause they're like, oh, we got her.

238
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,530
We actually made her pay $300.

239
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:49,270
They're like, I can't believe we actually made her pay $300 for, for a hair salon trip.

240
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,570
Here's some free, here's some free $10 snacks.

241
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:58,590
I got like a tray of snacks too, to like keep me occupied and everything.

242
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,830
Um, so like, that was nice.

243
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,810
He was a nice guy.

244
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,490
He was like really nice stylist.

245
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,110
Cause he kept asking like, is everything okay?

246
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,870
Like, are you okay?

247
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,490
And everything.

248
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,830
And like, you know, mentally, no, I'm not.

249
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,730
But like here in the moment, I'm like, yeah, I guess.

250
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:22,670
I guess I'm okay.

251
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,450
Um, but yeah, that was my hair salon trip today.

252
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,210
Um, oh my gosh.

253
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,550
I wrote like an entire page of like things I want to talk about.

254
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:40,230
Also, I wasn't able to, my friend couldn't make it in the end because like they had last minute work to do that was given to them.

255
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,610
So like, I ended up not doing the Halloween event instead.

256
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:50,930
Uh, like I ended up not going, well I did go outside, but I didn't do the wanted to do originally because he couldn't make it.

257
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,890
Um, so like, uh, um, good thing.

258
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,570
Cause I did not buy an air mattress.

259
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:03,370
So I was gonna buy an air mattress and then like they messaged me like, oh, I have to cancel.

260
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,070
I was like, all right, don't have to buy an air mattress.

261
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,370
At least I did go outside.

262
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:18,090
I actually went to an Halloween farmer's market, um, on one of the days and, um, I have a problem.

263
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,810
I have a problem with bread.

264
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:34,290
Like, I don't know why I swear every time I see bread at a farmer's market, I can't help myself.

265
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,490
Like I just, I was just like, oh my, I bought a bag of bread.

266
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,230
I full of just random assortment of goods.

267
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,030
Like, I don't know what, I don't know.

268
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,950
There were so many stalls at the farmer's market selling bread.

269
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,610
I had to force myself to not buy at two of the bread stalls.

270
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,690
They were so cute.

271
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,490
Some of them were like shaped like things.

272
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,610
There was like, there was a cookie shaped like Pikachu.

273
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,970
I, I almost bought it.

274
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,050
I was like, oh my, that is so cute.

275
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,810
But like I haven't eaten a single one of those.

276
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,630
I only ate like, okay.

277
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,770
So like I haven't eaten a single one of the baked goods I bought.

278
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,630
It's just bad.

279
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,250
Cause like it's in the fridge right now, but it's just, I couldn't help it.

280
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,650
Like I have a problem.

281
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:27,630
Anyway, I was at one of the stalls at the farmer's market and like, this was so evil.

282
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,350
Like I didn't, I didn't mean to.

283
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:35,270
It was a very popular stall because I went there 30 minutes after it opened.

284
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,130
And then like almost everything was sold out already, which was crazy.

285
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,930
Cause I like, I didn't know, I've never seen this.

286
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,430
I don't go outside much.

287
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,170
Like now I do.

288
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,190
Tomorrow I have to go outside again because I have to go to the bank.

289
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,130
I'm freaking if I see that guy again at the bank.

290
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,830
Anyway, cause I need to make more art transfers.

291
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,330
Anyway, today, not today, um, the farmer's market.

292
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,630
Uh, so I was like, whoa, it must be really good.

293
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,490
So I was lining up and they had one loaf of bread left.

294
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,490
Like, you know, a loaf of bread.

295
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,790
And it was like, apparently it was like, um, a, um, a Japanese bakery.

296
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,950
So like it was made with like Japanese ingredients.

297
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,590
So they had one loaf of bread left.

298
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,250
It was almost all, everything was almost all sold out.

299
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,730
And I was like, I need that one loaf of bread.

300
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,910
And I, and then, and then I bought that one loaf of bread.

301
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:35,030
And then the grandma behind me, this old Asian grandma behind me was like, oh, do you not have any bread left?

302
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,530
They would try it.

303
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,250
I was paying for, I had other, I bought like another two other stuff with that loaf of bread.

304
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,610
And then the granny behind me was like, oh my, do you have any left?

305
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,550
Like you don't sell at my, your bakery that was near my place.

306
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,150
You don't sell these bread.

307
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:07,550
I wanted to have one of like, I've been wanting to buy these loafs of bread for so long.

308
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,830
Cause your bakery that's near my place doesn't sell it or it's always sold out.

309
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,230
And I was like,

310
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:25,550
okay, it's so fucked up because in my head, I was like, that means it's good.

311
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,950
That means this is good bread.

312
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,790
I'm just like, as I should have been there earlier.

313
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:52,910
So I was just overhearing the fucking grandma and then the lady's like, oh, you just need to go buy it.

314
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,890
I'm like, at like this day, at this time to guarantee you're gonna be able to get it.

315
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,010
And you're like, oh, are you gonna, are you gonna have any more?

316
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,050
Cause like, it was like, you know, there's still like five hours left at the farmer's market.

317
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,510
And you're like, no, we just, all the stock we brought.

318
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,010
And I'm just holding my bread and I'm like,

319
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,350
be like, oh my God, this shit's gonna be so good.

320
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,890
This bread is gonna be so fucking good, man.

321
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,830
I made the right choice buying this last loaf of bread.

322
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:35,950
Anyway, so I was happy because I made, that means I, well, I wasn't happy for the grandma.

323
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,910
Like I literally bought the last one in front of her.

324
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:47,250
I literally bought the last one in front of her, but I'm just like thinking, wow, I can't wait to try it.

325
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,870
I didn't have a, I did try it.

326
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,510
That was like the one thing I did try, but like, I didn't have like a bread knife.

327
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,990
Cause I didn't realize it was an entire loaf.

328
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:03,490
I, I didn't, um, I didn't realize it was an entire loaf of bread.

329
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,310
I thought it was sliced.

330
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,290
It was not sliced.

331
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:12,890
So I have to like, I got, I have like wooden knives, like disposable knives.

332
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,850
And I was like trying to fucking slice the bread.

333
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:23,570
Yeah, it was, it's an uncut loaf of bread, but I was just like trying to slice it with a wooden knife.

334
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,210
Cause I didn't have, I, it was like a disposable knife.

335
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,390
So I was just like trying to slice it.

336
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,450
I gave up and just ripped the bread.

337
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,310
I don't, ow, it was good.

338
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,570
It was a good bread though.

339
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,770
It was, it was like super soft Japanese bread.

340
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,990
It was really good.

341
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,230
That grandma was right.

342
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,010
That was, that grandma was right.

343
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,050
I, that I ate that bread for her.

344
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,050
I ate it for her.

345
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,230
Hello, police.

346
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,650
I like to report.

347
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,130
What?

348
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,730
It's not, it's free real estate.

349
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,610
If she wanted this, she should have been earlier.

350
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:12,450
Like she should have lined up earlier if she really wanted this loaf of bread.

351
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,210
The guy in front of me bought the second last loaf of bread.

352
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:23,030
The only reason why I bought that was because the guy in front of me was buying the second last loaf of bread.

353
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,510
And I was like, wow, there's one left because he bought the second last one.

354
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,310
So that means it's good bread.

355
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,670
And then I bought it.

356
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:37,950
And then the grandma behind me reconfirmed my, reconfirmed that this was good fucking bread.

357
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,570
If it's anybody to blame, it's the guy in front of me that also bought.

358
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,770
I wouldn't buy it.

359
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,830
I wouldn't have bought it if he didn't buy it.

360
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,650
I knew it was good because there was one left because he in front of me bought it too.

361
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,950
Also T-Bird, thank you for the super chat.

362
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,270
Thank you.

363
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:06,910
Thank you.

364
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,030
Oh, it's your birthday.

365
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,490
I hope you had a good day so far.

366
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,750
Today was my birthday.

367
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,730
Um, I had to work, but now I get to watch my Kamiyoshi.

368
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,010
Thank you for the super chat.

369
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:15,350
Thank you.

370
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:15,930
Thank you.

371
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,590
Happy birthday to you.

372
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,290
Happy birthday to you.

373
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,290
Happy birthday dear T-Bird.

374
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,670
Happy birthday to you.

375
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,290
Yeah.

376
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:30,350
Anyway, but yeah, so that there's a lot that happened the last couple of days.

377
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:40,570
Like I legit means like I legit have like an entire fucking, like an entire list of like updates and everything, um, going in.

378
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,610
But yes, today is Call of Duty Black Ops 6.

379
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,850
Um, I know the game I released like a couple of days ago.

380
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,070
I really want to try it out.

381
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,870
I wanted to try the game out when, um, was it the closed beta test?

382
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,770
Was it closed beta early access was out?

383
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:02,490
Uh, because like, you know, I heard like, it was really fun to like, how to like, you know, kidnap people and be like, Hey, what you doing boy?

384
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,750
So I've been wanting to try it out.

385
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:07,970
Yeah.

386
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,210
Try it out for a long time.

387
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,210
Um, I know a little bit late because everybody is trying out, trying out.

388
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,610
Now I heard matchmaking was absolutely terrible in terms of MMR.

389
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:24,950
So like you do really well in the first game you get to you are placed into like the hardest game of your life after that.

390
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:33,930
So like guys, if I start guys, so because of that, guys, me being bad at Call of Duty is just all acting.

391
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:40,910
So I am on purpose missing my shots.

392
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,410
So I don't get placed in harder lobbies.

393
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,130
Okay.

394
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,050
Like this is the excuse we're going through.

395
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,570
So you see me miss my shots.

396
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:57,690
It's because, um, I'm purposely throwing so we can be placed into like easier lobbies.

397
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,470
So we won't have a rough time at other lobbies.

398
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,910
So like, that's totally it guys.

399
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:04,990
I'm, I'm acting.

400
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,190
I'm just acting.

401
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,480
It's all strategic guys.

402
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,720
We're missing strategically on purpose.

403
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,000
Um, Mike, thank you for the super chat.

404
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,320
Thank you.

405
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,000
Thank you.

406
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,960
Asian grandma.

407
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,860
Oh, this bread from my childhood that I love so much is gone.

408
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,260
Toki tears into said bread like wild animal.

409
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,580
I just, I don't have a bread knife.

410
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,620
I can't.

411
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,500
I just, I don't even have furniture or kitchen.

412
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,100
I use disposable wooden utensils.

413
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,700
I have entire box of just wooden knives, forks, and spoons guys.

414
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,520
Like I don't even have a bowl let alone like an at bread knife guys.

415
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,740
I literally, I bought a trash can today.

416
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,860
I like, I've been so busy.

417
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:09,420
I literally, I literally Amazon ordered an actual kitchen trash can yesterday.

418
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:15,480
So I'm getting that today because you guys don't know how I've been fucking throwing my trash out.

419
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,220
I get a trash bag and that look, this is like the Asian way.

420
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,860
I, it's because this is like the Asian way.

421
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,960
No, it's true.

422
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,780
Unless it's my family.

423
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,920
It might be my family taught me this.

424
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:42,360
So you know how like back when growing up in an Asian family, um, you get like all these trash bags and then like you get the trash bag and then you put it in like one of the handles and then you use that trash bag as like the trash can.

425
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,680
So you don't waste the trash, the bags.

426
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,120
You don't waste like these, like all these bags and stuff.

427
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,880
So that's how I grew up.

428
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:54,640
So like I just use these bags and just do that and then just put trash in there.

429
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,300
And then after that I tie the trash bag up and go downstairs and throw the trash away.

430
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,520
That's how I do it.

431
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,540
Anyway, I got judged.

432
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,640
Um, I got judged, uh, two days ago.

433
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,500
Um, by one of my friends because I talked about that to them.

434
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:23,200
You know, I opened myself up and then got severely judged and like, you know, like, you know, shunned from society for being a freak.

435
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:32,060
So because of that, I decided to be a normal human being and Amazon ordered a trash can for my kitchen.

436
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:42,260
I mean, I got judged for not having a trash can.

437
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,600
So I was like, I should be a normal person and actually have a trash can to fit into society.

438
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,020
So there's a trash can in the lobby right now waiting for me to pick it up.

439
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,420
So I also, by the way, I didn't have shower curtains.

440
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,940
Because I was so lazy.

441
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,520
So I also did, I also, Amazon ordered shower curtains.

442
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,650
I live by myself, like, I see me.

443
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:19,950
Exactly.

444
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,050
I live alone.

445
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:39,170
So I was like, there's no need as long as the, the, the, the shower faucet thing doesn't like, like water doesn't go outside, like the tub, like it doesn't, the door is closed.

446
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,870
He's not gonna see.

447
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,630
The water doesn't get everywhere because the, the thing doesn't flush.

448
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,830
I try to make sure it doesn't phase out towards outside.

449
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,610
Anyway, um, I'm trying to fucking re-enter into society.

450
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:02,530
So, you know, like the wolf girl that got, like, got raised by wolves and then they gotta train her to be back.

451
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:10,510
They gotta, like, normalize her back to human society after rescuing her from the wolves.

452
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,570
Like, anyway, I'm trying to integrate back into society right now.

453
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:20,430
And not only is the trash can waiting for me downstairs, but also my shower curtains.

454
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:31,090
So I'm getting, I'm finally after, what is it, two to three months living here, um, I'm getting shower curtains.

455
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,530
Getting shower curtains.

456
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,690
Mega, thank you for the super chat.

457
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,690
Thank you, thank you.

458
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,510
Doki, you have Amazon at your fingertips.

459
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,930
How do you now have every single basic human essential item?

460
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,250
Thank you for the super chat.

461
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,810
Thank you, thank you.

462
00:37:54,330 --> 00:38:13,950
Because I started getting judged by my friends and then so, like, like, you know, because of that, I was like, because of that, I was like, all right, maybe, maybe I should, I should have these things, like, in my apartment.

463
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:21,070
Like, when you live by yourself, it's like, it doesn't, like, it's not on the top of your head, you know, when you live by yourself.

464
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:29,050
It was an unfurnished apartment before I got there, so I was like, you know, it wasn't in my head that I had to get these things.

465
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:39,870
Because I'm like, you know, who's gonna fucking see me, like, I'm fucking showering, like, the door is closed, who's gonna fucking see?

466
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:54,130
So it never, like, occurred to me that, like, shower curtains is, like, an essential item and a trash can, too, because, like I said, I don't have to, it's just me.

467
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,010
And then people were like, that's not normal.

468
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,290
I'm like, oh, fuck, okay, I gotta reintegrate into society.

469
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,710
Obscura, thank you for your very first super chat.

470
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,370
Thank you, thank you.

471
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,670
Damn, girl, you live like this.

472
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,510
I like how somebody, I like how Ozni was, like, male.

473
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,570
Honestly, no, no, it's true.

474
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:23,470
A lot of times, I live, it's like a hashtag male living space, like, it's very true.

475
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,830
Like, my walls are empty and everything.

476
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,910
I don't have any furniture.

477
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,290
Like, Ozni, thank you for the super chat.

478
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:31,550
Thank you.

479
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,150
Okay, let's actually play the game, guys.

480
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,290
We did a 40-minute life update.

481
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,290
Guys, I told you, there's so much more to life right now.

482
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:44,190
But, all right, we did a 40-minute life update.

483
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,910
Okay, I don't know what to play on.

484
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,670
I heard zombies was really good.

485
00:39:51,950 --> 00:40:05,490
I heard the current zombie is really good and the maps are really good for it, but we're not gonna be playing zombies because I want to save zombies as a collab in the future.

486
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,990
Yeah, so, I think, like, I think zombies would be a great collab in the future.

487
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:19,630
And I was actually talking to Doobie on Discord, and, like, she was, like, she loved, she was, like, super down with zombies and stuff.

488
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,210
Not in the near future, by the way.

489
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,590
We were just chatting and stuff.

490
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:30,370
So, yeah, I want to save zombies in another time.

491
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,010
Guys, don't, like, low expectations.

492
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,030
Not in the near future.

493
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,050
All right, anyway, multiplayer.

494
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:48,530
I want to do multiplayer because, like, I heard, I don't know you could, like, you know, like, what was it?

495
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,710
You kidnap people?

496
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,770
I don't even know what the button was for it.

497
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,390
Oh, yeah, Doobie's so fucked.

498
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,190
She's so cool.

499
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,390
She's so nice, too.

500
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,670
She was, like, telling me about her 3D setup.

501
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,850
Oh, my god, her 3D setup is insane.

502
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,950
Like, what she told me how she did all of that shit.

503
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,630
I don't think I could ever use that because it was, it's very expensive.

504
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,470
Like, when she was telling me the setup, it's so fucking expensive.

505
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,610
I was, like, I don't know.

506
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,750
I can't afford that.

507
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,090
Thank you for the super chat.

508
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:23,950
Thank you, thank you.

509
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:29,250
No matter how sad it sounds, you're still my Kamiyoshi, but please get normal living spaces.

510
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,390
Thank you for the super chat.

511
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,950
Thank you, thank you.

512
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:39,010
All right, all right, guys, we're here to get absolutely destroyed.

513
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,810
I don't think I have anything.

514
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,610
Oh, I fell by level 4?

515
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,250
Can I even change, guys?

516
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,090
Oh, wait, I can change operators?

517
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,370
Wait, is there any difference between operators?

518
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,010
Are they all the same?

519
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,850
Black ops, woods.

520
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,290
Are there any just cosmetics?

521
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,510
Oh, I won't beat him.

522
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,110
I won't beat him.

523
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,070
He looks so cool.

524
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,670
He has one eye, so you know he's not reliable.

525
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,350
He has one eye.

526
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,010
That shit, he ain't hitting shit.

527
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,230
Let's see.

528
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,470
All right, I think that's cool.

529
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,470
Okay, we'll go that and then I guess find a match.

530
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,310
Treat everyone with respect.

531
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:30,070
Okay, no death perception.

532
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,530
Yeah, there's no death perception.

533
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,890
Is that one eye debuff?

534
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,910
Kill order, face off, mosh pit?

535
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,630
The fuck is that?

536
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,610
Are we gonna mosh?

537
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,310
Okay, gun fight.

538
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,510
Using predetermined class to win the round.

539
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,750
Okay, you know what?

540
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,030
I fucking, I don't know.

541
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,990
I don't know what's a good game mode.

542
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,010
Wait, what do I, what do I try first?

543
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,430
All right, let's just, uh, let's just fuck it.

544
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,270
Let's go all in.

545
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,790
I hope the sound's okay.

546
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,150
I don't know if sound guy's alive.

547
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,410
Honestly, I'm barely, I'm barely alive right now.

548
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,410
When in doubt, do TDM.

549
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,650
Oh shit, you're right.

550
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,050
All right, um, let's see.

551
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,150
Says thank you for the super chat.

552
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:23,910
Thank you, thank you.

553
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,890
Don't forget to dolphin dive backwards and get a cool ass, there's a cool ass knife kill you can do?

554
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,250
Thank you for the super chat.

555
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,230
Thank you, thank you.

556
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,870
Oh, you are here.

557
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,290
All right.

558
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,290
How's your, oh, 24 ms.

559
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,790
That's what I like to see.

560
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,570
Um, I think like, I usually play COD for zombies, not the multiplayer.

561
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,950
Sorry, guys, I'm not game.

562
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:49,890
No, my bro tuber didn't grow up with COD.

563
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:55,150
Didn't grow up with COD multiplayer.

564
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,790
Not my bro tuber.

565
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,530
No, I mostly just played COD for zombies.

566
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,470
I didn't play for the multiplayer.

567
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,470
I'm gonna get absolutely destroyed.

568
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:14,470
Okay, enforcer, recon, strategist, which is, what is it?

569
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:15,670
What the fuck?

570
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:16,290
I, what?

571
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,770
I just, I was trying to figure out my gun.

572
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:22,970
Oh, that's bullshit.

573
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,490
Oh no, I have deaf, I have deaf voice on too.

574
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:30,490
So, I definitely heard that.

575
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,710
I was like, the fuck, what's wrong with you?

576
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:35,870
Oh, that's my teammate.

577
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,230
Oh my god, reload takes fucking forever.

578
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,310
Holy shit.

579
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,070
What is this?

580
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,930
Reload takes forever in this game.

581
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,630
That's crazy.

582
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,770
Watch this.

583
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,110
360, let's go.

584
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,730
Oh shit.

585
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,170
Oh my god, please, reload takes so long.

586
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:01,990
That's fucking right.

587
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,590
Oh, nice, he was, how much ammo do I have?

588
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:08,690
It's an LMG.

589
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:15,290
Oh, okay, I wasn't, I don't know, I just said, I saw strategist and I was like, what did I do?

590
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,250
What did I do?

591
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,830
Oh, did I send in a helicopter?

592
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,030
What the fuck do I do?

593
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:29,710
Oh no, guys, no, don't give me good, don't give me good, oh, this is LMG.

594
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,130
This is an LMG, I keep reloading.

595
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,850
It's, oh, I did not mean to reload.

596
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,010
No!

597
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,190
I didn't mean to reload.

598
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,370
It's, it's such a bad habit.

599
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:50,330
I feel like Apex and Overwatch gave me such bad habits with uh, with reloading.

600
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:56,490
I can't help it.

601
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,510
I can't help it.

602
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,890
It's all Apex and Overwatch's fault.

603
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,830
All I want to do is just reload.

604
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,790
Oh no, I'm doing way too well.

605
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:09,550
I'm doing...

606
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:10,970
No, this is bad.

607
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,190
These guys are actually bad.

608
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,190
This is so bad.

609
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,650
This is bad.

610
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,150
They're all, holy shit.

611
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,610
What do you mean, like, nine one five?

612
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,450
How many kills have they got?

613
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,610
What the, how my bottom frag, how long have they been playing?

614
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,890
Like, how long have these guys been playing?

615
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,810
My bottom frag, I've just been killing people all day.

616
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,790
That's actually crazy that I'm bottom frag right now.

617
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,570
Like...

618
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,550
Oh, oh, get over here.

619
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:48,670
Get your ass over.

620
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,670
Whoa, stop running!

621
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,610
What the fuck?

622
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,090
Ow!

623
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,690
Where did he go?

624
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,470
That's fucking right.

625
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,910
That's what you get for running for 20 years of your life.

626
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,690
What a waste.

627
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,790
You were born to just die.

628
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,150
You were, you were born just to get killed by me.

629
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,590
There we go.

630
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,170
Jesus Christ.

631
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,850
No, oh, whoa, whoa.

632
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,470
The god, I'm scared.

633
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,810
Jesus Christ.

634
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,650
Like, where are they?

635
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,070
I'm fucking, I'm just, where are they?

636
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,720
No, fuck, there's three!

637
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,820
Oh, turn down the sound effect?

638
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,220
Okay.

639
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,340
There's no way somebody's gonna just shoot me like this, right?

640
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,560
While I'm, please, I, is there a sound effect?

641
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,200
Like, I guess there's no sound effect.

642
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,300
I'll turn this down.

643
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,380
I don't know.

644
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,000
Wait, am I, are we winning?

645
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,820
No, we're losing?

646
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,720
How are we losing?

647
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,260
Oh, it's because I didn't do confirmed kills.

648
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,340
Like, I need to touch this.

649
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:01,960
No!

650
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,320
I got it!

651
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,080
I touched it.

652
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:04,460
It's okay.

653
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,100
I touched it.

654
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,480
I touched it.

655
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,220
Guys, I...

656
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:08,700
What?

657
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,440
How do I swap class?

658
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,180
How do I swap?

659
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,400
How do I swap classes?

660
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,960
I need to try another gun.

661
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,540
I'm not confirming stuff.

662
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,120
All I'm doing is just shooting my gun.

663
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,460
No!

664
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,220
Bro, they're camping!

665
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,040
Escape?

666
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,840
Where is it?

667
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,740
Oh my god, I can't.

668
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,160
Oh, press one.

669
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,700
Jesus Christ, they're just camping!

670
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,320
Those fuckers.

671
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:46,980
That's it.

672
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:47,760
I'm calling.

673
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,420
I'm gonna call them.

674
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,260
Mushy mush!

675
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:51,800
Ring ring!

676
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,260
Ring ring!

677
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,080
That's fucking right.

678
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,460
Ring fucking ring.

679
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,100
No!

680
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,800
Where?

681
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,540
Where is it?

682
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,860
Okay, what's a better?

683
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,380
Okay, I'm gonna try the recon.

684
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:07,560
Oh my god.

685
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,440
Where the fuck were they?

686
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,080
I don't like this guy.

687
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,440
Oh, I still killed him though.

688
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,000
I still killed him.

689
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,640
What the fuck?

690
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,880
Can I destroy it?

691
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,600
I can't even destroy it?

692
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,440
Okay, nice.

693
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,580
I got him.

694
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,840
Oh my god.

695
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,900
Oh, it's sniper?

696
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,480
Okay, that makes sense.

697
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,740
Okay.

698
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,220
Oh, I'm doing my best team.

699
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,400
No, there's no way!

700
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,940
And that's me!

701
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,480
I was.

702
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,280
I was doing my best.

703
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,300
I wasn't bottom frag.

704
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,200
I wasn't even bottom frag.

705
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,480
I am.

706
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,560
Deathwishers, thank you for the magenta super.

707
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,220
Thank you.

708
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:48,900
Thank you.

709
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,540
Hey, Toki.

710
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,640
You probably don't remember me.

711
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,300
Oh, and you know, I decided to join the space force instead of the air force.

712
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:54,940
Oh, I remember!

713
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,880
You told me about your plan to be in the air force.

714
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,580
I finished BMT and now I'm currently in tech school.

715
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,960
Happy to watch you again.

716
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,440
And so here is some taxpayer money for thank you for the magenta super.

717
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:05,980
Thank you.

718
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,900
Thank you.

719
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,580
Oh my god!

720
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,180
Oh my god, see guys!

721
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,260
Like you guys said, chat reflects the streamer.

722
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:21,440
So if this guy can get into the space program, technically, I'm just as smart as an astronaut.

723
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:31,100
We have doctors and astronauts in the fan base, guys.

724
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,580
Okay, let's do some quick settings.

725
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,280
We're all quick.

726
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,020
All right, audio.

727
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,060
What was it?

728
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,140
Oh, show more!

729
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,520
Okay, 75.

730
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,680
And then effects will be here.

731
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,780
Okay, guys.

732
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,580
I was- I swear to god.

733
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,060
I was trying my best.

734
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,860
I- I swear to god.

735
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,560
Leave this lobby.

736
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,680
I- I swear.

737
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,220
I was doing so well.

738
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,820
So thank you for the super chat.

739
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,180
Thank you.

740
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:04,740
Thank you.

741
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,920
Casually walks into the most obvious.

742
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,760
What do you mean?

743
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,480
Gamers, don't look down.

744
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,340
I don't know.

745
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,380
How was I supposed to know?

746
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,980
Gamers, don't look down!

747
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,940
It's not a thing.

748
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,380
Thank you for the super chat.

749
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:22,820
Thank you.

750
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,660
Thank you.

751
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,740
It's not my fault.

752
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,360
That's not uh, oh!

753
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,360
Uh, thank you for the super chat.

754
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:35,640
Thank you.

755
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,480
Thank you.

756
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,560
Hi, Doki.

757
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,500
Doki.

758
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,980
And then, I'm sorry, I don't know the rest.

759
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,560
Look, see?

760
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,620
I can read.

761
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,280
I- and then I don't remember.

762
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,020
I don't- I can read some of the characters.

763
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,960
Uh, but thank you for the super chat.

764
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,240
Thank you.

765
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,760
Thank you.

766
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,520
Um, what's- how do you sing it in Cantonese again?

767
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,620
Is that it?

768
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,320
I don't remember.

769
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,160
Happy birthday!

770
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,500
Happy birthday!

771
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,120
I don't remember the Cantonese way to sing it.

772
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:48,460
I remember the Mandarin way, um, because- because like, uh, when I was in- when I was in Asia, uh, um, uh, you know, there would be like family banquets and then mostly a lot of my relatives would speak like Mandarin.

773
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,320
So they'd still sing it to me in Mandarin instead of Cantonese.

774
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,180
And so I was like, was I not queuing up?

775
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,560
Oh, I wasn't even queued up.

776
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,520
So like that was like the only- like they rarely sing it to me in Cantonese.

777
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,000
That's why I remember the song.

778
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,020
Yeah, I turned off motion blur.

779
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,340
I'm pretty sure I turned it off.

780
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,360
It was like the first thing I looked at too.

781
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,240
Guys, it was my first game.

782
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:12,960
Guys, please.

783
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,360
Maybe I'll do balance.

784
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,740
I don't think we need ultra.

785
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,680
We don't need to look that good.

786
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,700
Um, I think that's- I think it was like view.

787
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,020
Yeah, motion blur.

788
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,280
Wait, what?

789
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,860
How is weapon motion blur on?

790
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:31,680
All right.

791
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,340
There we go.

792
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,700
I thought it was off.

793
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,900
I literally checked it before stream.

794
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,740
Yeah, I checked it before stream.

795
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,900
I don't know how it was on.

796
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,960
Maybe because I restarted the game.

797
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,880
Guys, this game- this game took me three restarts to get going.

798
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:56,820
Like, you gotta- you start the game, then you gotta log into Activision, and then after that, you need to connect your phone number on Steam.

799
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,300
And then after you connect it, you have to re- okay, you gotta log into Activision.

800
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,380
You then restart.

801
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,420
After you restart, you go back in, and then you gotta connect your phone number to Steam.

802
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,400
And you want to play multiplayer.

803
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,560
And then I did that, and then I restarted, and then there was another thing I had to do.

804
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,620
And they're like, oh, yeah, we gotta install some updates.

805
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,080
You gotta restart now after the updates are done.

806
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,580
So then I did that, and then I went back in, and then I'm in.

807
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,400
And then I was in.

808
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,320
It took so long.

809
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,920
Like, I just went through so many restarts today.

810
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,460
Yeah, it was pain.

811
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,900
I was like, do I really need to restart my game 500 times just to play Call of Duty?

812
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,920
Like, what- how do the Xbox gamers do it?

813
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:43,760
Enforcer?

814
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,260
What weapons do I have?

815
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:46,640
Domination.

816
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:47,760
Okay.

817
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:48,980
You want to clear your name?

818
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:56,900
Capture the zone and then- Did I get fucking- what happened to me?

819
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,560
What happened to me?

820
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,580
How do we lose C?

821
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,860
What happened?

822
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,280
That's crazy, you can- you can get- oh my god, you can get crushed.

823
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,620
That's actually crazy.

824
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,880
Now I know.

825
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,780
I'm looking at my map.

826
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,480
I remember this game.

827
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,920
You gotta look at your map.

828
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,300
Are you serious?

829
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,820
How fucking- Don't- don't tell me I got SBM'd already.

830
00:56:52,060 --> 00:57:01,780
Like, don't tell me I already got- guys, this is my second- Oh my god, I swear to god, if I got SBM'd already, I swear to fucking god.

831
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:06,020
This is literally my fucking second game.

832
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,840
I swear.

833
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,220
No, don't do this to me.

834
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,720
This is my second game of the game.

835
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,280
Don't SBM me.

836
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,360
Oh god.

837
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,820
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

838
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

839
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

840
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,830
There's so many people.

841
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,370
I'm so scared.

842
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,090
Okay, here we go.

843
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,170
Secure it.

844
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:42,510
I secured it.

845
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:44,970
See the people.

846
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:46,730
I'm securing.

847
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:47,190
I'm capturing.

848
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:47,950
I'm doing my job.

849
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:48,770
I'm doing my job.

850
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,450
I'm doing my job.

851
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:53,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

852
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,030
I'm scared.

853
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:56,230
I'm too scared to keep doing my job.

854
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,430
No, why did you do that?

855
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,710
Why did you leave me here?

856
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:05,270
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

857
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,550
No, I'm securing this.

858
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:12,670
I don't know.

859
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,790
I forgot to throw my nade, guys.

860
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,270
Is it this?

861
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,170
Oh my god, it's not this.

862
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:18,910
No, no, no, no, no.

863
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,270
I have a pistol.

864
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,030
No, I have a pistol.

865
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:21,590
No!

866
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,510
I was like, which button is the nade?

867
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:31,330
I was trying to remember where...

868
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:31,850
Oh god.

869
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:34,990
Okay, that's fine.

870
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:35,710
Q!

871
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,370
Oh, that's not Q!

872
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,070
Oh, that's not Q!

873
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,370
My sticks are on me.

874
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,530
I was trying to press E.

875
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,690
Why is grenade E?

876
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,870
What the fuck is an E?

877
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,890
That's so dumb!

878
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,930
Why the fuck is grenade E?

879
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:01,910
It should not be.

880
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,270
It should absolutely...

881
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,290
What's on G?

882
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,970
Nothing is even on G.

883
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:07,650
Like...

884
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,130
Oh my god, nothing even is on G.

885
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,430
Like, what do you mean?

886
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,690
Oh, don't worry.

887
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:14,950
I stay...

888
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:20,130
I need a... I need a fucking... Yeah, why not G for grenade?

889
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,290
That doesn't make sense.

890
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,490
G is for armor?

891
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:27,850
Not G is for armor.

892
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,490
Why the fuck is it not...

893
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:32,730
I'm going.

894
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:33,810
There we go.

895
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:34,750
I did it.

896
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,450
I hit his E because hide?

897
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,230
That doesn't make sense.

898
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,250
Oh, hey, he has a cat.

899
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:44,750
You lost B?

900
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,350
No, I worked so hard.

901
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,110
What the fuck?

902
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,250
He looked like he was dead.

903
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,910
E for armor.

904
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,230
Bro, you bitch.

905
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,270
You're such a pussy.

906
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,470
You're actually a pussy.

907
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:00,910
All right.

908
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,430
Oh, I have 60 bullets.

909
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,290
If I knew I had 60 bullets, I would not be...

910
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:06,550
There we go.

911
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:10,010
I don't know if there's anybody there, but I just did it for the sake of it.

912
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,410
We're capturing.

913
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,010
We're capturing.

914
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:13,630
We're capturing.

915
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,050
We got it.

916
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,050
We got the place.

917
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:17,950
What are you gonna do?

918
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:18,670
Kill this?

919
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,570
That's fucking right, bitch.

920
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:22,870
That's...

921
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,770
There we go.

922
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:25,570
Movement.

923
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,490
I didn't get crushed.

924
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,770
How did he come over here?

925
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:30,850
How did he...

926
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,350
How did he get over here?

927
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,910
How did he... How did he get over here?

928
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,930
Oh, wait, what's this?

929
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,340
I'm swapping.

930
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:49,920
I'm swapping.

931
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,360
The settings, I...

932
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,680
I can't.

933
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,380
I can't do grenade E.

934
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,600
E makes me just want to pick stuff up.

935
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,400
I can't.

936
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,820
We don't need armor.

937
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,340
We don't need armor.

938
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,360
We don't need armor.

939
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,200
I see it.

940
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,160
I press E out of reflex.

941
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:16,000
We don't need armor at this point.

942
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,060
There's no need.

943
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,640
I'm just like, let me pick it up.

944
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,740
Let me fucking pick it up.

945
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,680
It can't be bad.

946
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,240
This is so bullshit.

947
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,700
It actually is one of them.

948
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,360
Oh my god.

949
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:39,180
I hate that it's E.

950
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,020
I hate it.

951
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,200
I re-binded it.

952
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,120
It was actually causing me too much fucking stress.

953
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,600
Oh my god.

954
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,000
Oh my god.

955
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,940
I'm just not used to... Like, E is use inventory.

956
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,980
That's what E is for me.

957
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,320
It stands for use inventory.

958
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,160
Okay, we still have the last guy.

959
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,760
You should have seen the last guy.

960
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,000
You should have seen that guy.

961
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:10,740
Hahaha.

962
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,750
It's reflex when you use...

963
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,080
Guys, it's literally reflex.

964
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,640
I've been using E for use item for years.

965
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,820
How am I... And now it's not?

966
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,820
You know, like now it's not?

967
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:34,420
What do you mean it's different now?

968
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:37,220
Oh shit.

969
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,400
Oh god.

970
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

971
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:42,500
No!

972
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,780
It's muscle memory.

973
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,560
It's literally muscle memory.

974
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,420
What the fuck?

975
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:53,980
Oh my god.

976
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,080
There, see?

977
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:00,380
Look, now I don't fucking accidentally grenade myself after re-binding.

978
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,500
We don't need armor.

979
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,500
We never needed armor.

980
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,100
Okay, it's fine.

981
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,280
Fine, we're reclaiming.

982
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,020
Oh my god.

983
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:17,640
It is.

984
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,700
It's literally the standard for gaming.

985
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,660
They just never fucking... They never swapped.

986
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,120
It's literally like...

987
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,120
Gaming 101.

988
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,760
G for grenade.

989
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,220
Not G for fucking garmor.

990
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,280
Oh shit.

991
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:34,700
Whoops.

992
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,820
I hope there was no friendly fire.

993
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,480
I don't know.

994
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,340
That would be awkward.

995
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,640
Losing alpha?

996
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,300
Are we winning?

997
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,320
Bro, we're fucking winning.

998
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,040
I'm gonna do it.

999
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,640
Wait, you can't flank there.

1000
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,980
I love garmor.

1001
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,980
Like, who the fuck does G for garmor?

1002
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,160
That makes zero sense.

1003
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,560
Okay, that guy's dead.

1004
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,100
That guy's dead, dead.

1005
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,220
Whoa, nice.

1006
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:08,620
Okay.

1007
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,660
Oh, I love the movement though.

1008
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,100
The movement's so smooth.

1009
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,080
Wait, oh my god, that guy was dead!

1010
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,320
That guy's... Oh, yes, I got him.

1011
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:18,940
A?

1012
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,260
Who the fuck is at A?

1013
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,040
Oh, you are at A.

1014
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,500
Do you have armor?

1015
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:26,940
Doh, what?

1016
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,900
You can run backwards?

1017
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,560
Running backwards is so weird.

1018
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,080
I don't know if I can do it.

1019
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:34,540
I don't know if I can do that.

1020
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,880
It's just so unnatural.

1021
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,500
Running backwards?

1022
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,160
I know it's like...

1023
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,680
It's like low-key, like...

1024
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,180
a thing in this game, but it's so weird.

1025
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,820
I'm not used to just running backwards in general.

1026
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,400
Wait, what?

1027
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,840
Oh, fuck!

1028
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,300
Okay.

1029
01:04:59,340 --> 01:04:59,860
Nice.

1030
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,380
Wait, who's in this?

1031
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,360
Who's in this area?

1032
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:03,940
Nobody.

1033
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,140
It's ours.

1034
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,220
I love the movement.

1035
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,360
It's so smooth.

1036
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:09,940
Oh.

1037
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,900
It's so... oh my god.

1038
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,560
I need to remember, like, you can also, like...

1039
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,480
you can also, like, dive in this game.

1040
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,560
Like...

1041
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,320
Wait, where is he?

1042
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,580
Ha ha ha!

1043
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,540
That's right, you tr...

1044
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,080
Whoa!

1045
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,160
No!

1046
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,280
It's okay.

1047
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,260
Okay, we're winning anyway.

1048
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,500
We're winning.

1049
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,020
Oh my god, the time to kill.

1050
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,180
Go, go, go, go!

1051
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,180
Don't be a pussy!

1052
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:34,840
Go!

1053
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,480
Don't be pussy!

1054
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,360
Oh, shit!

1055
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,460
Oh, shit!

1056
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,980
Okay, I got stunned.

1057
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,320
Never mind, I'm a pussy.

1058
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,780
Ha ha ha!

1059
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,480
Wait, I'm getting shot from behind.

1060
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,420
What?

1061
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,080
There's a...

1062
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,940
Turn around!

1063
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,080
Turn around!

1064
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:52,680
Turn around!

1065
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:53,840
You're...

1066
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:53,980
Oh my god!

1067
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,240
How did we let this one guy...

1068
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,240
do that?

1069
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,700
Oh, we still won.

1070
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,280
Like, turn around!

1071
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,420
I'm getting shot.

1072
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:07,920
Where?

1073
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,140
Where do I get armor?

1074
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,640
Where do I get armor?

1075
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,040
It wasn't me, guys.

1076
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,140
I didn't die, so technically I'm winning.

1077
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,920
Ha ha ha!

1078
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,340
Alright, nice.

1079
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,260
Does it even tell you how many kills you got?

1080
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,800
It's just, like, objective.

1081
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,080
Oh, I have 33 limbs!

1082
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,540
Wait, how many do they have?

1083
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,200
Wait, what does the score mean?

1084
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,060
What is the score?

1085
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,680
What is...

1086
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,240
Armor is only in one game mode?

1087
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:46,180
Exactly!

1088
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,840
That is why I fucking...

1089
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,020
unbinded armor.

1090
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,460
Oh, I get new loadouts!

1091
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,220
Fuck yeah!

1092
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,400
Is this, like, play to win?

1093
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,120
Wait...

1094
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,600
Is this play to win?

1095
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,700
I can make my own class?

1096
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,680
Wait, how do I do that?

1097
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,540
Guys, give me the best loadout.

1098
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,860
Guys, what loadout would work for me?

1099
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,400
Genghis, thank you for the super chat!

1100
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,360
Thank you, thank you!

1101
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,480
Oh, I think the last time!

1102
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,490
It's like...

1103
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:30,810
Who's breathing him?

1104
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:38,450
I think he's on his Xbox right now.

1105
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:39,390
Okay, guys.

1106
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,250
What's the question?

1107
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,410
I think he's on his freaking Xbox.

1108
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:45,810
Alright.

1109
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,970
Guys, what gun should I do?

1110
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:49,770
Shotgun?

1111
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,470
Oh yeah, the RC car!

1112
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:54,750
Wait, I can't even think.

1113
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,410
Wait, what do you mean?

1114
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,230
Wait, I can't...

1115
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,610
I'm so confused.

1116
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,910
There's so many things.

1117
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:02,790
Wait, are we in?

1118
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:04,650
Wait, I was trying to customize!

1119
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:09,750
Rain in the fire?

1120
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:11,710
Is he okay?

1121
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:13,790
Is he on his Xbox?

1122
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,410
He has to be on his Xbox.

1123
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,290
There's no way.

1124
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,210
Do I have...

1125
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:21,050
Guys, what gun?

1126
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:21,710
What do I get?

1127
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:24,130
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1128
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,410
What do I get, guys?

1129
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:30,970
What do I get?

1130
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:31,370
3?

1131
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:32,830
Oh, the shotgun.

1132
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:34,590
It can't be that bad.

1133
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:37,250
We're gonna try.

1134
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:39,730
We haven't tried...

1135
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:40,470
What is this?

1136
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:42,150
Oh, is this deathmatch?

1137
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:45,270
Oh my god, maybe I shouldn't do shotgun.

1138
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:45,370
Oh my god.

1139
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:48,530
Okay.

1140
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,590
Wait, let me...

1141
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:51,910
We're not doing shotgun.

1142
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:54,890
Everybody...

1143
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:56,230
Yeah, we're not...

1144
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:59,070
Guys, we're not doing shotgun after that.

1145
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:01,010
Oh shit, with a sniper.

1146
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,770
Yeah, after that, that was...

1147
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:05,050
Yeah.

1148
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,130
That wasn't it.

1149
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:12,110
That was absolutely not it.

1150
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:15,150
Wait, how the fuck?

1151
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,470
I can't even kill anybody.

1152
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,690
Nobody's alive for me to kill.

1153
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:21,810
Wait, this is not fair.

1154
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,050
Oh my god, he already has a zombie thing.

1155
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,470
Oh my god, why did I choose 5?

1156
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,770
Guys, how do you...

1157
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,470
Guys, you can't snipe here!

1158
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:36,950
Okay, not 5.

1159
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,750
No, you can't snipe here.

1160
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:40,710
Like...

1161
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,490
Bro, everybody's...

1162
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,650
Everybody's so...

1163
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,030
That dude is prestige.

1164
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:48,190
What does that even mean?

1165
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:50,910
Because I can't snipe here.

1166
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:53,750
Oh.

1167
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,090
Oh wait, he has this little bazooka.

1168
01:09:58,150 --> 01:09:59,710
Wait, this looks like an R9.

1169
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:00,610
Is this an R9?

1170
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:03,390
Oh my god, where are people at?

1171
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:06,030
No.

1172
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,530
Please let me...

1173
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:11,090
No, he's just camping.

1174
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:11,510
Wait.

1175
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,570
No, he's just camping.

1176
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:17,710
No, I'm in the tryhard lobby now.

1177
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:18,310
No.

1178
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,750
No, I did too well.

1179
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,670
That's not what I wanted.

1180
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,290
No, I did too well.

1181
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:28,190
No, look at him.

1182
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,070
Look at him go.

1183
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:33,950
Look at him go.

1184
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,790
They got me.

1185
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,750
They actually...

1186
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,690
They got me.

1187
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:41,730
Look at his movement.

1188
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,350
They actually got me.

1189
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:48,510
Oh, you think you got good movement too?

1190
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,110
What?

1191
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,870
How much damage did I do?

1192
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:57,930
Oh my god.

1193
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:59,030
Wait, is this gun bad?

1194
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:01,890
Welcome to SBMM.

1195
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:03,590
No.

1196
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:04,650
No.

1197
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,890
I can't believe it.

1198
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:10,930
Guys.

1199
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,830
They got me.

1200
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,170
It's like God SBMM.

1201
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:17,010
It's so hard.

1202
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,910
Okay, this gun is not it too.

1203
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,350
What is this gun?

1204
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,910
You wouldn't tell when someone is a god player.

1205
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:31,150
Holy shit.

1206
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,130
Bro, is he buddy hopping?

1207
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:35,250
Is this man buddy hopping?

1208
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,010
Holy shit.

1209
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,970
He's fucking buddy hopping.

1210
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,310
That shit's crazy.

1211
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,050
How does he buddy hop in this fucking game?

1212
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,090
That's crazy.

1213
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:54,070
No.

1214
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,070
He was so low.

1215
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:56,450
Guys.

1216
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:58,090
We're fucked.

1217
01:11:58,290 --> 01:11:59,310
We already made it.

1218
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,670
It took me two games.

1219
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:07,190
It literally took me two games.

1220
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:08,450
Oh, he's dead.

1221
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:08,750
Okay.

1222
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:15,710
Wait, did I kill myself?

1223
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:16,090
Whoops.

1224
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:18,690
I thought I threw over the car.

1225
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:19,650
I thought I did this.

1226
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:22,850
I thought I did that.

1227
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:25,630
Oh my god.

1228
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:27,650
Okay.

1229
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:28,850
Alright.

1230
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,970
That's cool.

1231
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:32,530
Oh my god.

1232
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,590
Actual buddy hoppers.

1233
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:37,530
Guys.

1234
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:39,790
Guys, please.

1235
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,750
This is my third game.

1236
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,650
This is an apex.

1237
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,230
Everything is apex.

1238
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,010
You put your mind to it.

1239
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:51,370
Everything.

1240
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:53,210
They're all apex.

1241
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:56,710
Oh my god.

1242
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:00,330
This is not what I expected so soon.

1243
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:04,070
When they said it only took one game.

1244
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:06,210
And then I didn't take one game.

1245
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,710
I thought I was safe.

1246
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:11,530
In the end, it only took two games.

1247
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:12,830
Who would have thought?

1248
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:14,850
Who would have thought?

1249
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:16,390
It was actually two games.

1250
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:21,170
Who would have thought?

1251
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:24,850
When they said one game, it was two games.

1252
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:26,910
What the fuck?

1253
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:27,830
Oh no.

1254
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,250
Oh no.

1255
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,650
Oh my god.

1256
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:33,950
That's a fucking thing.

1257
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:39,770
It gets worse.

1258
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,650
Is my team winning?

1259
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:42,870
Oh thank god.

1260
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:47,390
I'm just there for the ride.

1261
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,270
Bro, this guy is actually insane.

1262
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:52,310
This guy is actually insane.

1263
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,830
Look at him jump.

1264
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,170
He's just fucking everywhere.

1265
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,110
His movement is crazy.

1266
01:13:58,590 --> 01:13:59,690
Is that omni movement?

1267
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:01,770
I don't even know what omni movement still is.

1268
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:04,790
But I just know that guy is fucking insane.

1269
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,310
He's literally solo carrying.

1270
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,190
This...

1271
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:11,430
He's like solo carrying right now.

1272
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:14,970
Oh my god.

1273
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,290
Yeah, no shit.

1274
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:19,450
Look at that fucking go.

1275
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,730
Bro, he's like literally sliding.

1276
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:25,710
Is there friendly fire?

1277
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:26,810
I can't tell.

1278
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:28,450
I don't know.

1279
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:30,470
I don't play a lot of COD other than zombies.

1280
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:32,810
Zombies don't have friendly fire.

1281
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:34,390
I'm so scared about that guy.

1282
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:36,290
Bro, that one guy is scary.

1283
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:40,870
That one guy.

1284
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:43,610
That guy that looks like Viper in Valorant.

1285
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:45,670
Woah!

1286
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,190
Woah!

1287
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:48,830
Get out!

1288
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:50,750
What the fuck?

1289
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:51,690
Wait, I got a limb.

1290
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:54,330
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

1291
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,010
How?

1292
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,210
I don't know what I'm doing.

1293
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:00,830
He's here!

1294
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,090
He's here!

1295
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,650
Please, I'm first seed.

1296
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:07,310
Don't come in!

1297
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:09,170
Don't come in!

1298
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:14,290
That's fucking rude.

1299
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,310
I'm the main character now.

1300
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:18,410
I got him.

1301
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:19,870
Wait, there's a bitch?

1302
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,690
We got him, boys!

1303
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,810
We did it!

1304
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,910
Oh my god.

1305
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,110
Alright.

1306
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,510
You know, all I'm saying is that this is my second game.

1307
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:36,750
This is my third game.

1308
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,650
And I think I'm doing pretty well.

1309
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:42,370
In a sweaty lobby.

1310
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:43,710
I'm adapting, chat.

1311
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:45,050
I'm adapting.

1312
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:47,630
It's all about adapting to your surroundings.

1313
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,770
Oh my god.

1314
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:53,670
I'm trying so hard to adapt right now.

1315
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:54,710
I'm trying.

1316
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,090
Oh my god.

1317
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:57,330
Please.

1318
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:59,190
Please.

1319
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,050
I'm trying my best to adapt to my situation.

1320
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:09,070
Look, I'm adapting.

1321
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:10,810
It's all about adaptation.

1322
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:15,130
Wait, where is he?

1323
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,350
What the fuck?

1324
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,230
You can shoot from all the way there?

1325
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:21,650
What?

1326
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,970
You Valorant player!

1327
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,290
Oh my god.

1328
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:26,810
What gun is that?

1329
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,870
Wait, what gun is that?

1330
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:30,450
A GPR?

1331
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,530
Wait, I don't want to use GPR.

1332
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:34,710
Oh no, they're winning now.

1333
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:36,890
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1334
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:39,250
I'm sorry.

1335
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,710
Oh no, they're winning now.

1336
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,430
I'm so sorry, team.

1337
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:47,930
I'm confused.

1338
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:49,030
I'm sorry.

1339
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:52,230
I'm so sorry.

1340
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:52,790
What the?

1341
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,750
No, I got confused.

1342
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,010
No, I wanted a nade.

1343
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,690
Do I have that?

1344
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:01,350
C9.

1345
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,250
What is that?

1346
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:04,050
The GPR?

1347
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,990
I don't even know what that gun...

1348
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,870
No one's getting the point.

1349
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:11,670
I thought they would get the point.

1350
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:13,170
I'm too scared.

1351
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,170
I'm too scared.

1352
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:18,730
I'm too scared to get to the point.

1353
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:20,450
It's a level 30?

1354
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,730
I'm level 4!

1355
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,810
What's the other best gun I have?

1356
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:30,410
Maybe we should check our loadout real fast.

1357
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:34,070
Guys, I'm just a baby.

1358
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:38,070
I'm just a little guy.

1359
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:42,630
I'm literally just a little guy.

1360
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,850
What do they want from me?

1361
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:46,850
No more ammo.

1362
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:51,350
Is my current gun the best gun right now?

1363
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:53,070
That sucks.

1364
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,530
That's rough.

1365
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:57,990
That's actually rough.

1366
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:03,310
This gun is the best gun I have.

1367
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:06,330
I'm literally level 6 fighting at level 30?

1368
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:12,550
Just from one good game.

1369
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:15,000
That's so fucked.

1370
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,850
I'm literally a baby.

1371
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:23,040
Level 6 in a level 30 lobby.

1372
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:25,690
Why did they do this to me?

1373
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:29,110
I have zero attachments.

1374
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:31,750
I just unlocked...

1375
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,700
I just unlocked custom loadouts.

1376
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,830
Oh shit.

1377
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:42,350
He scared the shit out of me.

1378
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,570
Oh my god.

1379
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:50,650
It's fine.

1380
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:52,710
Hey guys.

1381
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:54,670
I'm not okay.

1382
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:05,010
I need to pick up my teammates.

1383
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:07,710
I need to mooch off my teammates' weapons.

1384
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:10,770
Oh my god.

1385
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:13,710
Oh thank god there's no fall damage right now.

1386
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:15,810
No, it's you.

1387
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,750
Get shit on.

1388
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:19,710
It's you.

1389
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:24,190
Oh my god, I don't know how.

1390
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:29,890
I should've got his gun.

1391
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,870
Wait, I could've.

1392
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:32,810
Does his gun still exist?

1393
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,610
How do I get his gun?

1394
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:36,850
What's the control?

1395
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:37,990
Is he still here?

1396
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,070
How do I F?

1397
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:41,610
Oh my god, this is it.

1398
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,910
Oh my god, I have his gun.

1399
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:44,870
I'm literally him.

1400
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:49,610
I hope I can live for one second so I can use his gun one time.

1401
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,750
That's all I want in life.

1402
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:56,630
I just want to use his gun once before I get absolutely destroyed.

1403
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:00,570
I'm literally him.

1404
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:01,710
Please.

1405
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,050
Let me use the gun once.

1406
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:04,930
I just...

1407
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,010
Please.

1408
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:07,190
No!

1409
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:12,030
I'm so sad.

1410
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:15,010
I'm so fucking sad.

1411
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,590
When did I die?

1412
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:19,910
You fucker.

1413
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:25,390
I just wanted to use it one time.

1414
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:28,830
That's so fucked up.

1415
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:32,390
That's actually so fucked up.

1416
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:33,310
Class.

1417
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,350
Get this fucker.

1418
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:37,910
I need to find him.

1419
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,150
We need to find him, chat.

1420
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,970
I need to bootchop his...

1421
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:43,190
No!

1422
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:47,930
I need to find him.

1423
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,870
I need his gun.

1424
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:51,790
I just want to be him for like one time.

1425
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:54,050
I want to know what it's like to have a level...

1426
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:57,150
I want to know what it's like to have a level 30 gun.

1427
01:20:58,030 --> 01:20:58,690
What's this?

1428
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,590
Is this a good gun?

1429
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:02,090
No.

1430
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:04,850
Is this a good gun?

1431
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:05,570
I don't know.

1432
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,250
I don't know what I have.

1433
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:09,770
Whoa.

1434
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:11,630
It definitely has attachments.

1435
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,330
It has attachments.

1436
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:14,250
That's a gun.

1437
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,290
It's him.

1438
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:23,750
No!

1439
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,930
No!

1440
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:32,070
But he has an attachment though, so it was such a good gun.

1441
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:34,630
It was technically a good gun.

1442
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:35,450
He had attachments.

1443
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,330
No!

1444
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:42,170
Look, I just need a good gun.

1445
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:43,890
I need a good gun.

1446
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:44,410
God.

1447
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:47,090
I just needed a good gun.

1448
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,310
That's really it.

1449
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:51,130
Wait!

1450
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:52,350
Yes!

1451
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,630
As long as the fucking viper guy didn't get...

1452
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:56,970
Oh, that's good.

1453
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:58,030
Wait!

1454
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:00,790
Wait, oh wait.

1455
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,750
Oh, he's good.

1456
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:03,590
Wait, is that the sniper?

1457
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:05,830
Holy shit.

1458
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,170
Was that the sniper?

1459
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:10,930
Is that gun five?

1460
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:13,550
That's a try.

1461
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,110
Yeah, that was my game three.

1462
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:15,770
That...

1463
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:22,050
That was my game three, chat.

1464
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:23,870
That...

1465
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:26,770
This was my lobby.

1466
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:28,270
I...

1467
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:31,090
Just...

1468
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,870
I'm only, not because I'm talk salty or anything.

1469
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:38,370
Because game three, I got put in a level 30 lobby.

1470
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:39,930
Like, I'm literally level six.

1471
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:41,370
Like, what do they want from me?

1472
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:44,650
Like, what the fuck do they want from me?

1473
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:45,990
Like...

1474
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:47,610
I...

1475
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:50,730
I don't have any attachments.

1476
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:52,050
I...

1477
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,570
I don't understand.

1478
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:58,370
I don't even have attachments on this poor little guy.

1479
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:00,330
He's just a little guy.

1480
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:01,990
Look how tiny he is.

1481
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:06,010
Look how tiny this kind of gun is.

1482
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:08,610
He's just a fucking little guy.

1483
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,390
Okay.

1484
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:12,970
Do I have loadout on it yet?

1485
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:14,490
Do I have anything?

1486
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:15,370
Bro!

1487
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:17,030
What do you mean?

1488
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:19,630
What do you mean?

1489
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,210
What do you mean it's locked?

1490
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:22,850
Okay.

1491
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:27,710
Alright, let's put something on it.

1492
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,530
Let's like...

1493
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,290
I don't know.

1494
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:31,610
Let's put...

1495
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:35,550
Let's put like a fucking scope on this at least.

1496
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:39,350
Let's just put stuff here.

1497
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:40,530
You know what?

1498
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:43,870
Let's make this little guy just a little bit bigger.

1499
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:46,670
You know, let's give him some enhancements.

1500
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:48,670
Like...

1501
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:50,170
Doki, he's...

1502
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:52,470
He's average, Doki.

1503
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:54,130
He's average.

1504
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:55,890
He's not a little guy.

1505
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:58,610
I mean, did you not...

1506
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:01,290
Did you not see what all the other guys had?

1507
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,350
Oh my god, those other guys.

1508
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,090
Wow.

1509
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,310
Compared to those other guys.

1510
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,150
Wow, that's a little guy.

1511
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:13,670
That's...

1512
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,470
Might want to mute lobby chat just in case they say anything bad.

1513
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,890
By the way, any chances for matches with Drago in the future?

1514
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:19,870
Can you guys think of a super chat?

1515
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:21,970
Yeah, we're gonna have custom matches after this.

1516
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,890
After me checking out the multiplayer.

1517
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:28,090
Don't bully the little guy.

1518
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,310
But it's not about...

1519
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:37,550
It's the motion of the ocean.

1520
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:38,270
Right?

1521
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,210
Is that...

1522
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:40,730
Is that it?

1523
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:41,650
Alright.

1524
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:44,990
Wait, I wanna...

1525
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:45,730
Multiplay.

1526
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:46,930
I wanna...

1527
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:48,430
What are some good game modes?

1528
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:51,230
Guys, what should we try?

1529
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:52,470
I don't know.

1530
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,990
I don't even know which one we tried.

1531
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,000
What should we try, chat?

1532
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:04,460
TDM?

1533
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:05,960
Wait, what's TDM?

1534
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:06,760
Team Deathmatch?

1535
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:08,320
Okay, let's try Team Deathmatch.

1536
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,640
I like the gunplay.

1537
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:11,920
Get to kill.

1538
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,480
Trash talk.

1539
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,180
Immediately dies.

1540
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:13,680
Cry.

1541
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:16,100
Repeat until matches.

1542
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:18,160
Thank you for the super chat, Gordon.

1543
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:18,620
Thank you.

1544
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,480
Thank you.

1545
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:20,460
Alright.

1546
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,460
Team Deathmatch.

1547
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,160
Have I not played Team Deathmatch yet?

1548
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,340
Alright.

1549
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,600
People said we should mute it.

1550
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,060
But like...

1551
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,560
I like to be wild.

1552
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,960
Like, what's so weird?

1553
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,220
It can't be that.

1554
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,040
I feel like nobody even talks.

1555
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:36,700
Anyway.

1556
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,280
Nobody even talks.

1557
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,780
Oh, maybe I should...

1558
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:42,860
You know what?

1559
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,620
Nobody even talks!

1560
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,760
And then suddenly...

1561
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,540
Suddenly...

1562
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,900
Something happens.

1563
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,120
Something bad happens.

1564
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,480
Maybe you're right.

1565
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:57,200
Maybe.

1566
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:02,880
They don't until they do.

1567
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,300
Alright.

1568
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,080
Did I mute it?

1569
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,160
I don't even know.

1570
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,520
Okay.

1571
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,300
Nothing until...

1572
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,160
Something happens.

1573
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,980
It's Call of Duty.

1574
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,440
It only takes one gamer.

1575
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,940
It only takes one gamer to make it happen.

1576
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,120
Alright.

1577
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:32,560
You're right.

1578
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:33,380
It's Call of Duty.

1579
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,340
I almost forgot we were playing COD.

1580
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,580
I almost forgot.

1581
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:40,580
We were playing COD.

1582
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:43,340
Guys.

1583
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,340
What lobby am I in this time?

1584
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:45,720
What?

1585
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,380
Guys, I need to know.

1586
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:50,980
What lobby am I in right now?

1587
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:51,620
I...

1588
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:56,200
How bad is my lobby this time?

1589
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:56,540
Hey.

1590
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,400
I like the sliding.

1591
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,040
It feels so fluid in general.

1592
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,380
Wait, what?

1593
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,320
He's above me?

1594
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,900
There's somebody above me.

1595
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,500
There's a freak above me.

1596
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,160
What the fuck?

1597
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:16,240
Who is this?

1598
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:17,400
He has a nice skin though.

1599
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:19,480
Oh.

1600
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:24,150
Where is he?

1601
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:26,030
He's moving a lot.

1602
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:27,870
What the fuck?

1603
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:28,730
Where are they?

1604
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:30,450
Oh, wait.

1605
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:31,370
Did I like fail?

1606
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:33,450
Oh, I failed.

1607
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:35,670
How the fuck did he get 77?

1608
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:37,710
I literally just joined the game.

1609
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:40,210
I was like...

1610
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:42,110
I just got here.

1611
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:45,790
How is it 77?

1612
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:49,810
Okay.

1613
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:52,610
I am just a little guy.

1614
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,070
Jesus Christ.

1615
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:58,470
Oh my god.

1616
01:27:58,530 --> 01:27:59,770
Is there another guy here too?

1617
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:01,890
Am I killed?

1618
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:03,790
I think I killed him like four times.

1619
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:08,410
Is he back?

1620
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:15,270
Yeah, this is the same guy that I...

1621
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:16,230
Oh no!

1622
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:20,370
I almost got him again.

1623
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:24,950
My god, why did I fail?

1624
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:28,610
No.

1625
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:31,730
I just didn't expect him to show up a fourth time.

1626
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:33,710
It like literally came out...

1627
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:34,450
I don't know.

1628
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:36,450
For some reason, I just didn't...

1629
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:39,090
I didn't expect the fourth time for him to appear.

1630
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:41,990
For some reason.

1631
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:44,690
Four was just not the number I can see.

1632
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,500
Okay, nice.

1633
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:50,580
Alright.

1634
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,660
I'm still winning this fight.

1635
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,220
Alright.

1636
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:55,400
Alright.

1637
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,860
I wanna steal somebody's gun.

1638
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,820
This poor guy.

1639
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,300
I've been cyber bullying him so hard.

1640
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:17,780
Oh shit!

1641
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:19,980
Oh no!

1642
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:21,260
I almost got him!

1643
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,100
I almost knifed him too!

1644
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,000
I ran out of ammo.

1645
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:29,750
Okay.

1646
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:33,770
No, we almost got the melee.

1647
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:35,870
It was so close.

1648
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:40,170
It's so hard to like pay attention to my map at the same time.

1649
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:44,920
Is he gonna come over?

1650
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:46,220
He's not?

1651
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:47,620
Bitch.

1652
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:51,600
I'm not used to like looking at...

1653
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:52,660
Yes!

1654
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:53,820
Yes!

1655
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,400
Yes!

1656
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:02,740
5 -1!

1657
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,100
That's all I'm gonna say.

1658
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,940
5-1!

1659
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,280
Bro, this poor guy.

1660
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,540
Let's go.

1661
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,580
We got 5-1.

1662
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,300
The clutch.

1663
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:19,380
Good shit.

1664
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:21,860
That poor guy.

1665
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:25,440
I literally just got in a cyber bully one person.

1666
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:25,580
That...

1667
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,360
That poor one guy.

1668
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:31,660
How?

1669
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:35,560
How would my SVM take me back to ELO hell?

1670
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:36,280
How?

1671
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:39,620
All I did was kill one person.

1672
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,920
That's all I did.

1673
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:43,660
It was just one guy.

1674
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,200
Oh, all it takes is one bad day.

1675
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:47,040
Okay.

1676
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,060
What other game?

1677
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:48,740
Oh, wait, shit.

1678
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:49,800
Which one?

1679
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,020
Okay, that was a good...

1680
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,440
That was a good team deathmatch.

1681
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,860
What other game mode is fun?

1682
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,260
Use him to look better.

1683
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,660
We did kill confirm.

1684
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,900
That's our first game.

1685
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,000
You're gonna... No!

1686
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:05,260
Don't say that!

1687
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:08,080
I just got out of ELO hell.

1688
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:09,520
Don't say that.

1689
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,160
Don't...

1690
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,320
Don't...

1691
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:12,740
No!

1692
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:17,400
Search and free-for-all?

1693
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,960
Okay, we'll try free-for-all.

1694
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:19,780
Alright.

1695
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:21,880
Don't say that.

1696
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:22,760
We just got out.

1697
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:25,460
We just got out.

1698
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,560
You must face your crimes.

1699
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:30,700
Wait, I love gun game!

1700
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,760
Wait, I wanna do gun game so I know what it's like to actually have a gun.

1701
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,280
Like, in game.

1702
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,000
Wait, sorry.

1703
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,860
So I know what it's like to have a pay-to-win gun.

1704
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,100
That's what I meant.

1705
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,740
Wait, which one's gun game?

1706
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,240
Which one's gun game?

1707
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:50,660
Gun game.

1708
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:51,500
Which one is it?

1709
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,040
I love gun game.

1710
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,000
Is it kill order?

1711
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:00,260
While keeping your HP?

1712
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:01,000
No, not yet.

1713
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:01,840
There isn't?

1714
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:03,460
No!

1715
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,280
They don't have gun game?

1716
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,560
What the fuck is hardcore, bro?

1717
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,880
Not yet?

1718
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,260
Is it gun fight?

1719
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:16,980
Oh, no response.

1720
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:17,260
No.

1721
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:17,980
No!

1722
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,940
I can't believe they don't have gun game.

1723
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,080
Gun game is so fun.

1724
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:30,210
Yeah.

1725
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:33,110
Gun game is like...

1726
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:35,330
Like, the most...

1727
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:36,050
What's the word?

1728
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:39,370
Like, the staple of FPS games.

1729
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:40,890
No, we're not doing hardcore.

1730
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:43,310
We're not doing hardcore.

1731
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:45,390
Guys.

1732
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:49,250
Guys, we got absolutely demolished by that one level 30 guy.

1733
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:51,010
Like...

1734
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:56,710
Guys, it's not gonna be a good day for any of us if I'm going hardcore.

1735
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,250
It added two months later?

1736
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:03,790
Why?

1737
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:09,870
Gun game is like the best game mode out of any... I think gun game is one of the...

1738
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:11,130
Wait, I have free for all and hardcore?

1739
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:12,710
No, don't say that.

1740
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:15,470
No, oh my god, I got gas lit.

1741
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:16,630
That's fucked up.

1742
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:18,670
Only I'm supposed to gas lit.

1743
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,710
We fucked up, guys.

1744
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:29,110
This is it.

1745
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:30,490
Alright.

1746
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:36,390
I'm so excited for free for all.

1747
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:37,450
We're gonna see...

1748
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,970
We're gonna see how...

1749
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:40,990
Free for all, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get camped.

1750
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:42,210
Alright, what...

1751
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:47,510
We'll do one more game mode and then we'll open up customs for dragoons.

1752
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:48,970
What's after...

1753
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:53,030
What do you do after this one?

1754
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:55,490
I'm gonna use the bathroom too.

1755
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:57,290
I'll be right back.

1756
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,940
I don't have a game yet.

1757
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:55,480
Is the game already dead?

1758
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:57,460
I'm like...

1759
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:01,620
If I don't get a match within five seconds of queuing...

1760
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,320
Dead game.

1761
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,100
Dead game right there.

1762
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,220
Alan, Kaz, Duck, Byte, thank you for the super chat.

1763
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:10,520
Thank you, thank you.

1764
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,240
Broku, thank you for the gift.

1765
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:13,900
True.

1766
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,560
This game came out three days ago.

1767
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,420
Dead game.

1768
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,060
Dead game.

1769
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:26,740
Alright.

1770
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:29,800
Oh my god.

1771
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:30,840
Free for all.

1772
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,180
I can't wait to get absolutely camped.

1773
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,360
Literally, how could this be the...

1774
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,540
Oh no, no, that's not...

1775
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:45,640
No!

1776
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,100
I didn't mean to!

1777
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,720
Maybe I'll try sniper again.

1778
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,840
Okay, that's not fair.

1779
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,120
Wait, what?

1780
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,600
Out of...

1781
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,560
Elimination for that?

1782
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:04,540
How?

1783
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:07,980
Wait, stop!

1784
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:12,910
This is fucked.

1785
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:15,990
Okay, well, this is fucking...

1786
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:17,770
I can't.

1787
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:19,750
I...

1788
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:20,630
Why?

1789
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:26,610
Get me back on my...

1790
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:29,250
Get me back on my one trick.

1791
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:32,770
Get me back!

1792
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:33,990
Get me back on my one trick gun.

1793
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:35,050
I can't.

1794
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:37,630
I'm a one trick.

1795
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,030
I'm a sad one trick.

1796
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:42,910
Wait, what?

1797
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:43,850
That's not fair.

1798
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:44,890
Wait, did I get a kill from...

1799
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:46,170
I don't even get kills for assists.

1800
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:49,230
Oh my god, kill stealer.

1801
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:50,490
Look, to be fair.

1802
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:54,650
And they shoot me?!

1803
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:56,490
And they shoot me first?!

1804
01:36:56,490 --> 01:36:59,450
Okay, to be fair, I was trolling in the first three games.

1805
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:00,370
I...

1806
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:06,010
Oh my god.

1807
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:07,690
Guys, I don't think I like free-for-all.

1808
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:16,490
At least free-for-all fucking sucks.

1809
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:21,930
You bitch!

1810
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:23,990
You bitch!

1811
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:26,350
These spawns fucking suck!

1812
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:29,170
Okay.

1813
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:33,130
These spawns are bullshit!

1814
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:33,650
Okay.

1815
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:35,150
Guys, I'm not mad.

1816
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:36,990
I'm just criticizing the game.

1817
01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:38,350
That's different.

1818
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:39,630
Are you fucking...

1819
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:39,970
Okay.

1820
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:46,180
Oh, fuck.

1821
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:46,420
Okay.

1822
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:49,840
I hate these spawns.

1823
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:53,920
Where the fuck did he go?

1824
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,180
Oh my god, where the...

1825
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:58,220
I fucking got lost!

1826
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,200
I got lost in the sauce!

1827
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:06,560
Okay.

1828
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:07,640
Give me your gun.

1829
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,720
Oh my god, give me your...

1830
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:11,060
No!

1831
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,320
Please!

1832
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:15,400
Please, I need your gun!

1833
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,120
I'm just a baby!

1834
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:18,860
Give me your gun!

1835
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,820
I need your gun!

1836
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:22,280
I need to mooch off your guns!

1837
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,080
No!

1838
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,040
I'm not last, at least.

1839
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:29,100
Please!

1840
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,380
My guns are dog shit!

1841
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,580
I need to mooch off of better guns!

1842
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:35,840
I don't even have skins!

1843
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,360
Give me your gun!

1844
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:42,980
No!

1845
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,640
Please!

1846
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,000
I don't even have cool skins!

1847
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,860
Give me your gun!

1848
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:54,740
I'm just fucking scavenging guns right now.

1849
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:56,460
No!

1850
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:57,900
Oh my god.

1851
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,940
Guys, I don't even know what gun I have.

1852
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,300
I'm just like, give it to me.

1853
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,540
Like, I don't care.

1854
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,520
I just need something.

1855
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:12,000
Like, I don't even care what I have.

1856
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,760
Just give it to me.

1857
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,260
Please!

1858
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,240
Oh, fuck.

1859
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:19,640
Okay.

1860
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,340
I'm fucking out.

1861
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:28,740
Wait, how am I slow?

1862
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,260
How am I...

1863
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,080
I'm going as fast as I can!

1864
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:35,680
Like...

1865
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:39,280
No, but it has a cool skin!

1866
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,980
It's not the same chat.

1867
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,760
It has...

1868
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:46,080
What?

1869
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:46,860
Did I not get that?

1870
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:47,400
Oh, I did.

1871
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,140
Oh, he threw a nade.

1872
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:50,620
It's not the same.

1873
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,160
It has a cool... Oh, nice!

1874
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:57,660
It has a cool skin, so it raises my FPS level.

1875
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:00,960
Guys, I don't know if you know that.

1876
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,580
Cool skins only make you aim better.

1877
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:07,640
Okay.

1878
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:09,700
What the fuck?

1879
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:11,400
What happened?

1880
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,620
Oh, I can close the door!

1881
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:17,540
I accidentally closed the door on myself.

1882
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,620
I'm so fucking stupid.

1883
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:21,420
I was like, what?

1884
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:23,960
Oh, give me your gun.

1885
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,160
Give me your shot.

1886
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:32,740
Fucking...

1887
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:33,460
Give me your gun.

1888
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:34,920
No, you were using a pistol!

1889
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:36,480
Give me back my other gun!

1890
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,880
What if I just...

1891
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,320
do that?

1892
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:45,500
Where is he?

1893
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,140
Wait, where is he?

1894
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,660
Oh, there he is.

1895
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,060
Wait.

1896
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:52,280
Is that him?

1897
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:56,580
Okay.

1898
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,460
I didn't know where he was gonna land.

1899
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,080
He threw it.

1900
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:03,620
He ver-naded it.

1901
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:05,540
That's actually so bullshit.

1902
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,740
He actually ver-naded it.

1903
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:08,580
That's crazy.

1904
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:09,680
That's...

1905
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:11,560
That's crazy.

1906
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,940
He actually ver-naded it.

1907
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,180
What the fuck?

1908
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,440
Guys, not bottom frag though.

1909
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,560
That's all that matters.

1910
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:24,140
Oh my god, that's not fair.

1911
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,920
Oh, fuck.

1912
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:28,720
I didn't see him.

1913
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,020
He cooked.

1914
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,660
He knew he was gonna die.

1915
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:33,920
That's crazy.

1916
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,400
That was a crazy play that he did.

1917
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,320
He knew he was gonna die too.

1918
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,640
Oh my god.

1919
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:44,720
These spawns are so bad.

1920
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,500
Oh my god.

1921
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,920
Is this free for all?

1922
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:53,580
These spawns are fucking terrible.

1923
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:59,860
Where am I getting shot from?

1924
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:02,200
Wait, I got shot.

1925
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,140
No!

1926
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,060
No!

1927
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,320
Oh, it's so close.

1928
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,140
What the fuck?

1929
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:18,320
It has a cool skin, so it raises my gamer level.

1930
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:20,580
That's fine.

1931
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,200
Fifth place!

1932
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:21,720
Fifth place!

1933
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:22,780
Not bottom frag!

1934
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,100
That's okay.

1935
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,720
Not bottom frag.

1936
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:30,120
That's all that matters.

1937
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,320
Not bottom frag.

1938
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,700
Alright, that's all I care.

1939
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:35,000
I'm nearly level seven!

1940
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,580
What the fuck?

1941
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:41,630
Slothy!

1942
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:47,030
I'm actually the baby of the sloth.

1943
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:50,110
Everybody's like level 32, 38.

1944
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:53,410
Like, I'm just a little kid.

1945
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:56,350
I'm just a fucking little kid.

1946
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:01,150
This is why I was stealing all the guns.

1947
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:08,620
Like, that's not fair!

1948
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:13,500
That's not fair.

1949
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,740
I'm actually a child in this lobby.

1950
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:23,760
I swear, I'm pretty sure these guys have been playing since launch too.

1951
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,240
I'm just a child.

1952
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:31,020
They'd be like, hey guys, are you guys all ready to have a good time?

1953
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:36,520
And then they're all like, nine foot tall, and I'm like, hey everybody!

1954
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,260
Good game everyone!

1955
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,060
GG's have fun guys!

1956
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:51,120
They can spell the new thing.

1957
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:56,840
And they actually fucking had money on their fucking gun.

1958
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,120
Jesus Christ.

1959
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,480
When can I unlock this?

1960
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,980
When can I unlock anything?

1961
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:09,180
Also, Brian and Arctic, welcome to the tomato farm.

1962
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:10,300
Welcome, welcome.

1963
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:15,600
Oh my god, when can I have a different gun?

1964
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:21,500
Alright, do I have anything on this?

1965
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:24,040
How do I edit this?

1966
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:26,520
It says what level?

1967
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:27,840
What does it say?

1968
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:29,900
How?

1969
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:39,610
Have a new SMG?

1970
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:40,370
I do?

1971
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:43,450
I do?

1972
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:48,190
Oh, is the KSV good?

1973
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:50,410
Is it good?

1974
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:53,770
Oh, I don't even have anything on this.

1975
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:57,130
Is the KSV good?

1976
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:00,730
No?

1977
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:03,310
Okay, then what's the point of looking at it?

1978
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:10,090
What's the point of looking at it?

1979
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:14,790
Okay, we'll do one more of these matches and then we'll do custom lobbies.

1980
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:22,130
Alright, which one guys?

1981
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,770
We'll do one more and then we'll do custom lobbies.

1982
01:45:25,330 --> 01:45:25,810
Which more?

1983
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:26,390
Which one?

1984
01:45:29,770 --> 01:45:30,850
We'll search and destroy.

1985
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:34,650
Teams alternate between... No, guys!

1986
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:40,990
That sounds difficult.

1987
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:48,710
That sounds like... That just sounds like you want me to play Valorant, guys!

1988
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:54,710
That just sounds like you just want me to play CSGO!

1989
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:06,670
Guys, if I want to defuse a bomb, I will boot up Valorant or CSGO, guys.

1990
01:46:11,290 --> 01:46:12,090
Take turns.

1991
01:46:12,290 --> 01:46:12,550
Oh!

1992
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:14,370
Take turns.

1993
01:46:14,490 --> 01:46:15,610
I think we did this one.

1994
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:20,650
TDM is the only game.

1995
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:23,650
We'll do one last TDM then.

1996
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:29,190
Ken say thank you for the super chat!

1997
01:46:29,290 --> 01:46:30,310
Thank you, thank you!

1998
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:32,690
Toki, Toki, wake up!

1999
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:33,990
Toki, your dog is cracked!

2000
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:34,550
I called him!

2001
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:35,710
Thank you for the super chat!

2002
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:41,350
I like how people were like, there's only one game, Motoki, and it's just Team Deathmatch.

2003
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:43,790
There's no other games in Call of Duty.

2004
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:46,370
Nobody queues for anything else.

2005
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:54,570
Alright.

2006
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:56,270
Come on.

2007
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:58,350
Come on!

2008
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:04,050
Give me... Come on!

2009
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:06,770
Where is my... What do you mean searching for a match?

2010
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:08,650
I literally queued up... Oh, there we go.

2011
01:47:08,650 --> 01:47:09,770
Oh, there you go.

2012
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:11,530
That took me like 15 seconds.

2013
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:12,270
Dead game.

2014
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:12,850
Dead...

2015
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:17,350
Wow, dead game right there.

2016
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:20,710
That should've been an instant matchup.

2017
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:24,190
Game's dead.

2018
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:26,390
15 seconds!

2019
01:47:26,830 --> 01:47:28,350
What is this dead game?

2020
01:47:28,670 --> 01:47:29,330
Oh, hey, Russia.

2021
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:34,100
Alright.

2022
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,440
Oh, wait, am I failing again?

2023
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:39,240
God damn...

2024
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:40,420
Guys!

2025
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:42,680
Stop rage quitting!

2026
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,040
Guys, I need you guys to stop rage quitting.

2027
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,700
Oh, fuck!

2028
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,280
Please.

2029
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,840
I literally just showed up.

2030
01:47:57,940 --> 01:47:59,200
I'm just a little guy.

2031
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:05,340
I swear, if I fucking press tab and I see like 800 fucking...

2032
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:06,720
Oh my god, bro.

2033
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:11,460
Oh, thank god, there's a level 1 and a 5 on the enemy team, but there's a level 70 on my team.

2034
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:13,200
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

2035
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:16,060
Bro...

2036
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:19,040
Level 70, that's like the highest I've ever seen.

2037
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:22,440
Where do I go?

2038
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,440
I don't know this map.

2039
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,520
This map is confusing.

2040
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:26,420
Like, where do they spawn?

2041
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,120
Why do they spawn behind us?

2042
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,940
Please, I need them to die closer so I can steal their guns.

2043
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,460
Alright, nice.

2044
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:38,780
I don't know what gun this is, but it looks like a good gun.

2045
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:40,760
Wait, where did he...

2046
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,280
Oh, shit!

2047
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:45,480
Wait, where did I get shot from?

2048
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:50,440
Where the fuck did I get shot from?

2049
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,160
Wait, is this the same guy?

2050
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,320
I can't tell if they're the same gun, guys.

2051
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:00,170
Wait, where did he go?

2052
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:04,410
Where did this guy go?

2053
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:04,550
What?

2054
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:07,570
Where did this fucker go?

2055
01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:10,410
I know there's level 70s in my lobby!

2056
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:12,150
I need one...

2057
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:14,050
I need one of your guns!

2058
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:19,550
I know there's level 70s here.

2059
01:49:19,730 --> 01:49:22,770
I know you have the most fucking stacked gun in this lobby.

2060
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:23,610
I need it.

2061
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:25,830
Oh, no.

2062
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:27,570
This is just a Hail Mary toss.

2063
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:33,250
Okay, nice.

2064
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:34,330
Give me your gun.

2065
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:35,650
Oh, it has a skin.

2066
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:37,990
You know it's good because it has a skin.

2067
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:39,050
Whoa.

2068
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:41,590
I don't want to go up that ladder.

2069
01:49:41,690 --> 01:49:43,070
That ladder looks so dangerous.

2070
01:49:45,450 --> 01:49:46,490
It's like...

2071
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:47,210
Oh!

2072
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,510
Fucking shotgun!

2073
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:50,830
God damn it!

2074
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:53,350
Fucking shotgun!

2075
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:55,470
My ass kicked.

2076
01:49:58,590 --> 01:49:59,890
I can hear them.

2077
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:02,350
Oh, this is such a big map.

2078
01:50:04,410 --> 01:50:05,310
Oh, thank god.

2079
01:50:05,370 --> 01:50:06,430
I swear to god.

2080
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:08,330
If that was a shotgun, I swear to fucking god.

2081
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:09,250
I was gonna...

2082
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:10,670
I'm going gamer.

2083
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:14,190
I'm going gamer.

2084
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:16,850
It counts.

2085
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:18,810
It counts.

2086
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:21,210
I should reload.

2087
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:22,490
Just in case.

2088
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:23,370
I don't trust myself.

2089
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:26,930
Where the fuck...

2090
01:50:26,930 --> 01:50:29,470
Are we even...

2091
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:30,810
Where am I?

2092
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:32,610
Where are they?

2093
01:50:32,850 --> 01:50:34,710
Oh, I don't like being in the open here.

2094
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:37,290
This makes me feel scared.

2095
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:39,710
Like, so open and vulnerable.

2096
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:44,450
Okay.

2097
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:49,250
Nade!

2098
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:52,650
Give me a gun!

2099
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:54,350
Oh, shit.

2100
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:55,670
Oh, shit.

2101
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:57,250
Wait, that's such a good gun!

2102
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:00,600
No!

2103
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,520
That was actually a good gun!

2104
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:06,840
No!

2105
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,180
Don't matter now.

2106
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,720
I won!

2107
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:20,960
I didn't kill her again.

2108
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,120
I know what she looks like.

2109
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,520
I remember what you look like.

2110
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:24,660
I'm gonna get you.

2111
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,160
I need your gun.

2112
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,720
This is her gun!

2113
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,780
Somebody already stole it!

2114
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,000
They had the same plan!

2115
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,520
They had the same idea!

2116
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,560
Somebody already stole the gun!

2117
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:43,320
How is that possible?

2118
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:45,320
I just...

2119
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:47,520
Wait, what?

2120
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:50,980
Oh my god, I was like, there's somebody here.

2121
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,600
But I was so confused as to where.

2122
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:55,380
Jesus Christ.

2123
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,040
Wait, that's level 2?

2124
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:57,300
What?

2125
01:51:58,340 --> 01:51:59,840
I looked away.

2126
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:01,620
I looked at the map.

2127
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,420
I looked at my chat.

2128
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,360
At that moment.

2129
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:10,960
That moment she knew she fucked up.

2130
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:13,760
No!

2131
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:18,740
Can't help looking at you guys!

2132
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,120
Can't help it!

2133
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:23,440
I am trying to be a good streamer.

2134
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:27,550
I'm just trying to give you guys attention.

2135
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:31,450
I'm getting fucking destroyed right now.

2136
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:34,260
Ever since I lost that one gun.

2137
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,260
It just hasn't been the same.

2138
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:42,100
It just hasn't been the same, guys.

2139
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,270
Ever since that one gun disappeared.

2140
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,380
Everything went downhill.

2141
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,620
I don't know anymore.

2142
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,560
What the fuck?

2143
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:54,640
I scanned the area!

2144
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,380
Give me your gun!

2145
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,120
How do you fucking get out of here?

2146
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:03,480
Wow!

2147
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:06,020
Oh my god!

2148
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:06,820
I thought he was my teammate!

2149
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:09,120
I legitimately thought he was my teammate!

2150
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,980
Cause like...

2151
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:12,020
There was a guy next to me and then there wasn't?

2152
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,840
And then the guy disappeared?

2153
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:20,120
I legitimately thought he was a buddy.

2154
01:53:22,140 --> 01:53:24,480
I thought he was just a cool guy.

2155
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:25,980
Hanging out with me.

2156
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:28,500
I wasn't blind!

2157
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:31,680
I wasn't blind!

2158
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,200
I legitimately thought he was a friend!

2159
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:38,320
They move sometimes.

2160
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:40,460
I thought we were holding hands!

2161
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:43,020
Being like, we're gonna die together, soldier.

2162
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,160
We're gonna die together!

2163
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:50,300
You know, like...

2164
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:52,680
Oh wait, that's not it.

2165
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:53,960
When did you get this gun?

2166
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,260
Wait, I got a green dot.

2167
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:58,340
When did you change your gun?

2168
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:03,180
Where is everyone else?

2169
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:04,000
I'm so confused.

2170
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:09,020
I'm like looking at my map and I don't see nobody.

2171
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:14,110
What the fuck?

2172
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:18,770
Everybody's killing things!

2173
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:19,930
But I see...

2174
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:21,770
They're all dying too fast!

2175
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:25,210
Please, let me join in!

2176
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:28,030
I wanna have fun too!

2177
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:30,730
No!

2178
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:31,130
No!

2179
01:54:35,070 --> 01:54:35,790
No!

2180
01:54:35,970 --> 01:54:38,610
The one time I found somebody.

2181
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:41,990
No, I just wanted to have fun.

2182
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:43,610
Where are they?

2183
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:45,330
Come on!

2184
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:51,350
I swear, it was me just running around trying to find one person.

2185
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:57,590
Like, where is everybody?

2186
01:55:02,490 --> 01:55:04,110
I did it!

2187
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:07,810
No fun for this.

2188
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:10,770
I just wanted to find one person.

2189
01:55:12,570 --> 01:55:14,750
Average god experience.

2190
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:17,850
Why is there...

2191
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:19,290
Oh god, the level 70 left.

2192
01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:20,950
For this poor team.

2193
01:55:21,370 --> 01:55:22,870
This poor fucking team.

2194
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:24,950
I'm pretty sure half of this lobby was filled.

2195
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:28,950
Did that team...

2196
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:30,190
Oh my god, level 7.

2197
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:32,370
How did they get level 70?

2198
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:33,190
How?

2199
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:36,350
How did they fucking get level 70?

2200
01:55:36,810 --> 01:55:37,490
I'm barely...

2201
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:38,950
I'm just level 7.

2202
01:55:39,670 --> 01:55:41,090
After 2 hours.

2203
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:44,670
Alright, private match.

2204
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:46,310
Create private match.

2205
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:48,030
Alright, guys.

2206
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:49,410
How do we do this?

2207
01:55:50,650 --> 01:55:52,170
I wanna invite you guys.

2208
01:55:52,850 --> 01:55:53,650
Uh...

2209
01:55:53,650 --> 01:55:55,370
Game setup lobby.

2210
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:57,930
Wait, let me figure this out.

2211
01:55:57,970 --> 01:55:59,210
I gotta...

2212
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:00,110
Let me...

2213
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:04,130
Let me figure this out.

2214
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:08,970
Game setup.

2215
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:12,210
Oh my god.

2216
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:18,010
Oh,

2217
01:56:21,550 --> 01:56:22,910
I have the code.

2218
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:23,930
Okay.

2219
01:56:24,590 --> 01:56:24,930
Okay.

2220
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:28,230
Um...

2221
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:29,270
Game setup.

2222
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:32,010
Team deathmatch.

2223
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:33,170
Map.

2224
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:35,610
What map do we want for game setup, guys?

2225
01:56:36,430 --> 01:56:38,570
Guys, what map do we want for team deathmatch?

2226
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:40,670
Guys.

2227
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:41,950
There's...

2228
01:56:41,950 --> 01:56:45,650
Vault, subsonic, Berkuda, and warhead.

2229
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:48,510
Which one's the best one?

2230
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:49,750
For team deathmatch?

2231
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:49,990
Team deathmatch.

2232
01:56:51,730 --> 01:56:52,690
There's no shipment.

2233
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:53,570
Oh, wait.

2234
01:56:53,650 --> 01:56:54,150
Oh, shit.

2235
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:54,950
There's more maps.

2236
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:55,570
Sorry.

2237
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:58,310
There's a scroll.

2238
01:56:58,630 --> 01:56:59,070
Sorry.

2239
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:02,210
There's a scroll at the bottom.

2240
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:05,450
Sorry.

2241
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:06,270
There's Babylon.

2242
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:10,030
I was like, there's only 5 maps?

2243
01:57:10,210 --> 01:57:10,570
Jeez.

2244
01:57:10,990 --> 01:57:12,050
Call of Duty went downhill.

2245
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:13,890
There's shipment.

2246
01:57:14,810 --> 01:57:15,650
Wait, is there shipment?

2247
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:16,710
There's no shipment.

2248
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:18,370
Okay, now I know there's no shipment.

2249
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:28,350
There's lockdown, payback, protocol, red card, rewind, SCUD, skyline, subsonic, vault, berkuda.

2250
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:29,930
There's no shipment.

2251
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:31,530
I know for sure there's no shipment.

2252
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:34,690
I know for sure.

2253
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:36,350
I'm literally looking at the maps.

2254
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:37,370
I don't see a shipment.

2255
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:40,210
I see a lot of red card.

2256
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:43,650
Red card, lockdown.

2257
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:44,410
Is there lockdown?

2258
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:46,350
I think there was, right?

2259
01:57:46,450 --> 01:57:47,110
There's low town.

2260
01:57:47,190 --> 01:57:48,090
Sorry, low town.

2261
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:50,110
Guys, you don't even know there's no lockdown?

2262
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:53,750
Pretty sure I'm at the bottom.

2263
01:57:53,790 --> 01:57:54,630
Yeah, I'm at the end.

2264
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:57,350
Yeah, there's no shipment or a nuketown.

2265
01:57:57,850 --> 01:57:58,690
There's subsonic.

2266
01:57:58,990 --> 01:58:00,090
There's red card.

2267
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:03,290
The shipment in this game is Babylon.

2268
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:04,130
There's Babylon.

2269
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:06,290
You want Babylon?

2270
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:06,490
Babylon?

2271
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:13,870
Red card.

2272
01:58:14,110 --> 01:58:15,330
We want...

2273
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:16,550
Sorry.

2274
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:20,770
Alright.

2275
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:23,010
Which map doesn't suck?

2276
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:26,590
If they all suck, which one doesn't suck?

2277
01:58:28,630 --> 01:58:30,270
There has to be a map that...

2278
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:30,670
Oh, wait.

2279
01:58:30,710 --> 01:58:31,510
You guys are COD players.

2280
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:32,550
Nothing makes you happy.

2281
01:58:36,290 --> 01:58:36,890
I forgot.

2282
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:39,670
You're never satisfied.

2283
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,630
None.

2284
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:45,490
Okay, we'll do subsonic.

2285
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:47,130
True.

2286
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:50,370
Okay, subsonic.

2287
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:51,570
What are the rules?

2288
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:52,390
Okay.

2289
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:55,610
Score limit, 100 points.

2290
01:58:56,430 --> 01:58:59,130
Advanced points per death player.

2291
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:00,250
Unlimited.

2292
01:59:00,370 --> 01:59:02,580
I'm trying to see if there's anything we can...

2293
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:03,830
Gameplay.

2294
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:05,830
Wait, there's health steal?

2295
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:06,830
Wait.

2296
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:09,910
Oh my god.

2297
01:59:09,990 --> 01:59:11,030
There's health steal.

2298
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:12,890
I'm putting...

2299
01:59:12,890 --> 01:59:15,250
I'm putting health steal on.

2300
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:21,730
I'm gonna put health steal on.

2301
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:24,330
I'm gonna do it.

2302
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:25,970
Alright, let's see.

2303
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:27,550
Alright.

2304
01:59:28,450 --> 01:59:28,910
Dice.

2305
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:31,110
Oh no.

2306
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:33,690
God, this sucks.

2307
01:59:34,290 --> 01:59:35,330
Alright, we're gonna play...

2308
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:36,290
Hey, it's almost Halloween.

2309
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:38,130
We're gonna do vampire mode.

2310
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:39,750
We'll do 150 points.

2311
01:59:40,230 --> 01:59:43,070
Alright, the moment I put the screen on...

2312
01:59:43,070 --> 01:59:44,190
There's gonna be the code.

2313
01:59:44,670 --> 01:59:46,670
Alright, I'm gonna put the code on my screen.

2314
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:46,990
Okay?

2315
01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:50,210
Okay, I think this is the code.

2316
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:52,090
I'm gonna put the text on my screen.

2317
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:56,350
Wait, I might have put the wrong code.

2318
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:57,330
Let me double check.

2319
01:59:57,330 --> 01:59:59,930
Okay, wouldn't it be funny if I gave you guys the wrong code...

2320
01:59:59,930 --> 02:00:01,490
and somebody actually had that code up...

2321
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:03,570
and you guys just accidentally joined this random man's code?

2322
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:05,150
Alright, here.

2323
02:00:06,410 --> 02:00:07,470
That's the code.

2324
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:09,670
Why is there still...

2325
02:00:09,670 --> 02:00:09,890
Okay.

2326
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:11,670
Alright.

2327
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:14,090
That's the code.

2328
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:17,110
Holy shit.

2329
02:00:17,370 --> 02:00:18,010
Wait, okay.

2330
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:21,510
Alright, CJ, I'm gonna put you...

2331
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:22,350
over here.

2332
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:26,390
Alright.

2333
02:00:26,850 --> 02:00:27,370
Alright.

2334
02:00:27,690 --> 02:00:29,270
Let me make sure.

2335
02:00:30,290 --> 02:00:30,810
Alright.

2336
02:00:31,650 --> 02:00:34,350
Whoever has a lot...

2337
02:00:35,610 --> 02:00:37,650
I'm gonna make sure I get...

2338
02:00:37,650 --> 02:00:40,370
I think that's full now.

2339
02:00:41,470 --> 02:00:41,990
Guys.

2340
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:42,690
Okay, guys.

2341
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:45,490
I need you guys to die in front of me...

2342
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:46,170
so I can...

2343
02:00:46,170 --> 02:00:47,550
Give me your best gun.

2344
02:00:47,550 --> 02:00:49,210
And then, like...

2345
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:51,550
I need you guys to give me your best gun...

2346
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:53,410
and then, like...

2347
02:00:53,410 --> 02:00:55,190
die in front of me...

2348
02:00:55,190 --> 02:00:56,730
so, like, I can...

2349
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:59,090
so I know what it's like.

2350
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:02,090
I know what it's like...

2351
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:03,510
to, like, have a good gun.

2352
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:04,590
That's all I want.

2353
02:01:04,650 --> 02:01:05,710
Oh, wait, I can...

2354
02:01:05,710 --> 02:01:07,450
Wait for custom match.

2355
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:08,550
Wait, which is a good gun?

2356
02:01:08,650 --> 02:01:11,150
Wait, I can put on guns.

2357
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:12,790
Which is the best gun, chat?

2358
02:01:14,150 --> 02:01:15,370
Guys, they're all unlocked.

2359
02:01:15,450 --> 02:01:16,110
Which one is it?

2360
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:16,810
What do I do?

2361
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:20,030
Guys, which one?

2362
02:01:20,450 --> 02:01:21,130
Which loadout?

2363
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:26,730
Which is the best gun?

2364
02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:29,050
Okay, I need a theory craft here.

2365
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:29,550
Which one?

2366
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:30,630
SMGs?

2367
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:32,450
The AME?

2368
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:33,250
The Goblin?

2369
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:35,270
Guys, the fuck does any of this mean?

2370
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:39,930
Where's the Goblin MK2?

2371
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:41,410
Oh, is it this?

2372
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:43,450
Oh my god, is it this?

2373
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:44,630
Create new build.

2374
02:01:45,150 --> 02:01:46,790
Is that... am I... that's not... wait.

2375
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:49,050
That's not the Goblin MK2.

2376
02:01:49,930 --> 02:01:51,370
Okay, how do I...

2377
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:52,490
put it on my gun?

2378
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:54,370
Okay, I got it.

2379
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:57,710
The Goblin MK2.

2380
02:01:57,910 --> 02:01:59,050
And then we'll...

2381
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:00,590
we'll edit this.

2382
02:02:00,770 --> 02:02:01,250
And then...

2383
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:05,410
Okay, which is my...

2384
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:07,630
Wait, is that not the Goblin MK2?

2385
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:09,310
Okay, what attachments, guys?

2386
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:10,550
What do I put?

2387
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:13,370
Guys, we gotta craft the best attachments in here.

2388
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:18,490
What do I put on?

2389
02:02:18,570 --> 02:02:20,150
Just put random words in.

2390
02:02:20,430 --> 02:02:23,210
Just shout out anything and then I'll figure out which one's dot.

2391
02:02:23,290 --> 02:02:23,970
Is it this one?

2392
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:29,070
Like, where's the red dot?

2393
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:29,830
Oh, there it is.

2394
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:30,710
That's the red dot.

2395
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:31,050
Okay.

2396
02:02:32,890 --> 02:02:35,230
Just say random words and I'll put it on.

2397
02:02:39,310 --> 02:02:40,210
I'm figuring this out.

2398
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:42,570
Yes, okay, that's a red dot, technically.

2399
02:02:43,170 --> 02:02:43,490
Alright.

2400
02:02:46,090 --> 02:02:46,650
Okay.

2401
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:48,370
Muzzle.

2402
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:49,930
I don't fucking know.

2403
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:51,590
Wait, I need accuracy, actually.

2404
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:52,870
Wait.

2405
02:02:53,130 --> 02:02:54,030
A better accuracy.

2406
02:02:54,250 --> 02:02:55,150
Okay, the barrel.

2407
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:56,610
Alright.

2408
02:02:57,150 --> 02:02:59,450
We're at a firepower.

2409
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:00,490
Underbarrel.

2410
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:03,310
Ooh, let's put...

2411
02:03:05,650 --> 02:03:07,610
Let's put more accuracy in here.

2412
02:03:07,610 --> 02:03:08,610
Magazine.

2413
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:11,070
Extended mag?

2414
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:12,870
Ooh, okay, let's...

2415
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:14,650
Let's put more ammo in here.

2416
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:15,390
That's right.

2417
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:16,390
40!

2418
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:17,450
Let's go!

2419
02:03:17,830 --> 02:03:19,570
This is how they won those games.

2420
02:03:19,730 --> 02:03:20,790
This is how they did it.

2421
02:03:21,150 --> 02:03:21,970
This is...

2422
02:03:23,370 --> 02:03:25,110
This is how they...

2423
02:03:25,110 --> 02:03:25,730
Wait, what?

2424
02:03:27,030 --> 02:03:28,150
Equip gunfighter.

2425
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:30,090
Must be quick to add more.

2426
02:03:30,310 --> 02:03:31,850
Equip gunfighter wildcard.

2427
02:03:31,950 --> 02:03:32,530
Let's do it.

2428
02:03:33,230 --> 02:03:34,370
Let's fucking do it.

2429
02:03:34,370 --> 02:03:35,010
Let's...

2430
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:37,950
Let's do everything.

2431
02:03:41,290 --> 02:03:42,450
This is it.

2432
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:43,030
They...

2433
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:45,050
They don't know what's gonna hit them.

2434
02:03:45,570 --> 02:03:49,190
They don't know what's gonna fucking hit them now.

2435
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:56,350
This gun is so stacked now.

2436
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:58,610
They don't know.

2437
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:00,590
Okay, we're sure there's a deagle.

2438
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:02,550
I need a fucking deagle right now.

2439
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:04,930
I need...

2440
02:04:04,930 --> 02:04:05,890
Ooh, that's right.

2441
02:04:06,330 --> 02:04:06,990
That's right.

2442
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:08,770
You don't know what's gonna fucking...

2443
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:11,050
Oh my god, and I get a baseball bat too.

2444
02:04:11,150 --> 02:04:12,190
Let's fucking go.

2445
02:04:12,490 --> 02:04:12,930
Alright.

2446
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:16,230
Alright, I...

2447
02:04:16,230 --> 02:04:17,810
I fucking... I don't care about these.

2448
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:18,770
Oh wait, tactical.

2449
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:21,950
Decoy shock charge.

2450
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:23,790
What the fuck is that?

2451
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:25,250
Oh, stim shot.

2452
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:26,350
We should get a stim shot.

2453
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:28,470
And then...

2454
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:30,290
No, I'll do frag grenade.

2455
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:31,690
A specialty.

2456
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:36,370
Guys, let's...

2457
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:38,710
I'm ready.

2458
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:41,510
I'm so fucking ready.

2459
02:04:43,450 --> 02:04:44,250
What's this?

2460
02:04:44,330 --> 02:04:45,190
Trophy system.

2461
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:47,710
War cry.

2462
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:49,250
Rally your team.

02:04:51,910 --> 02:04:53,510
Those, like, idle sticks?

2465
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:54,770
What are they called?

2466
02:04:54,910 --> 02:04:56,890
What are they called?

2467
02:04:58,070 --> 02:05:01,050

2468
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:02,390

2469
02:05:02,570 --> 02:05:03,690

2470
02:05:03,970 --> 02:05:05,090

02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:06,790
Yeah, yeah, let's...

2472
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:08,130

2473
02:05:08,410 --> 02:05:09,270
Alright, we're good.

2474
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:11,450

2475
02:05:11,610 --> 02:05:12,130
Let's go.

2476
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:13,410
It's pen light time.

2477
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:15,570
Let's fucking go.

2478
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:17,310
Alright, we got our loadout.

2479
02:05:17,370 --> 02:05:18,210

02:05:18,490 --> 02:05:20,430

02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:25,850
Let's get that car in.

2482
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:27,790
Let's fucking go.

2483
02:05:28,070 --> 02:05:28,950
Alright, I'm ready.

2484
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:30,450
Let's fucking start.

2485
02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:32,150
How do I start the game?

2486
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:34,870
How do I start the game?

2487
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,950
Let's play.

2488
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:37,310
Alright, we're ready.

2489
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:39,190
We got the RC.

2490
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:43,550
Fucking did it, boys.

2491
02:05:45,690 --> 02:05:47,590
This is what we've been waiting for.

2492
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:48,550
The RC car.

2493
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:53,990
The greatest build of all time.

2494
02:05:54,510 --> 02:05:57,630
Holy shit, this is a tiny fucking map.

2495
02:05:57,970 --> 02:06:00,150
What the fuck, guys?

2496
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:03,790
Why is this map so tiny?

2497
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:07,410
What the fuck?

2498
02:06:07,790 --> 02:06:10,630
I forgot how tiny the map was.

2499
02:06:11,470 --> 02:06:13,410
Oh no, people are already dying.

2500
02:06:15,990 --> 02:06:18,990
Why are you all smoking the area?

2501
02:06:21,710 --> 02:06:23,210
Oh my god, that was scary.

2502
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:28,340
Oh my god.

2503
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:29,180
The meta.

2504
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:31,280
The actual meta.

2505
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:32,160
Oh my god.

2506
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:33,560
Everybody's just dying.

2507
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:37,320
Everybody's... Wait, how do I get my baseball bat out?

2508
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:42,620
How do I get my baseball bat out?

2509
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:45,480
Don't worry.

2510
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:46,180

2511
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:46,860

2512
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:53,620
Everybody's just dying.

2513
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:56,620
This gun is so good!

2514
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:03,410
Oh my god.

2515
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:06,670
Oh, it's over.

2516
02:07:07,310 --> 02:07:09,990
Wait, no, give me back my actual gun.

2517
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:12,250
Oh my god.

2518
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:15,430
This gun is so good.

2519
02:07:15,770 --> 02:07:18,110
I love the way this is such a good gun.

2520
02:07:22,810 --> 02:07:23,750
Wait.

2521
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:24,130
Oh my god.

2522
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:26,410

2523
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:27,050
I can't see!

2524
02:07:27,790 --> 02:07:29,030
I can't see!

2525
02:07:29,610 --> 02:07:31,310
I can't see.

2526
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:33,990
I actually...

2527
02:07:33,990 --> 02:07:35,970
Oh wait, that's my teammate.

2528
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:37,610
Please.

2529
02:07:38,930 --> 02:07:40,390
I can't see anything.

2530
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:41,430
Please.

2531
02:07:42,470 --> 02:07:43,410
Stop.

2532
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:45,490

2533
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:47,870
Oh my god.

2534
02:07:47,890 --> 02:07:49,310
Everybody, please.

2535
02:07:50,090 --> 02:07:51,970
I can't see jack shit.

2536
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:53,670
Oh, there's so many of you.

2537
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:57,210

2538
02:07:58,330 --> 02:07:59,170

2539
02:07:59,410 --> 02:08:01,050
Don't make me do this.

2540
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:05,570
That's a fucking word.

2541
02:08:09,550 --> 02:08:12,590
They actually died to my car.

2542
02:08:13,850 --> 02:08:16,290
I'm mad cuz bad.

2543
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:21,330
Unequipped the smokes, please!

2544
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:23,270
Guys, how do I...

2545
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:24,570
How do I get rid of smokes?

2546
02:08:24,810 --> 02:08:25,990
How do I get rid of grenades?

2547
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:29,830
Gamers do not deserve grenades after this.

2548
02:08:30,350 --> 02:08:34,910
Gamers don't deserve grenades like we've learned.

2549
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:37,390
None of you deserve a grenade now.

2550
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:41,750
Like, that was actually a mistake for all of you.

2551
02:08:42,650 --> 02:08:43,170
Guys!

2552
02:08:44,730 --> 02:08:45,930
Wait, how do I...

2553
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:46,270
Wait.

2554
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:47,970
Go, go!

2555
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:50,530
Go!

2556
02:08:53,950 --> 02:08:54,790

2557
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:55,310
Yay!

2558
02:08:57,650 --> 02:08:58,950
We need bad names.

2559
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:01,870
We need fucking bad names.

2560
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:06,010
You guys picked this map!

2561
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:08,050
You picked it!

2562
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:11,010
I literally was like, where's what?

2563
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:11,050
What?

2564
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:14,290
Oh my god.

2565
02:09:14,450 --> 02:09:16,290
That was so...

2566
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:17,250
Hey, not bottom frag.

2567
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:17,830
Let's go.

2568
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:23,150
As long as I'm not bottom frag, let's fucking go.

2569
02:09:24,410 --> 02:09:26,310
Don't ban the names.

2570
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:28,710
Alright, making a new lobby.

2571
02:09:28,910 --> 02:09:29,970
I'm making a new lobby.

2572
02:09:31,450 --> 02:09:31,970
Okay.

2573
02:09:32,990 --> 02:09:34,650
Alright, new lobby time.

2574
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:38,010
Alright, if you played already, let other Dragoons have a chance to play.

2575
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:40,090
Game setup.

2576
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:40,750
What?

2577
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:43,570
What do you mean locked?

2578
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:45,710
Oh, okay.

2579
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:47,210
Game setup.

2580
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:53,410
Kill confirmed.

2581
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:54,770
Okay, guys.

2582
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:56,170
These are the maps.

2583
02:09:57,590 --> 02:09:58,770
Which one?

2584
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:00,750
These are all the maps.

2585
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:03,630
Now don't select a bullshit map this time.

2586
02:10:04,150 --> 02:10:04,710
Don't...

2587
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:06,730
We need a bigger map.

2588
02:10:07,070 --> 02:10:07,690
Guys.

2589
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:11,630
We need a bigger map.

2590
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:13,870
Babylon?

2591
02:10:14,370 --> 02:10:15,590
Alright, Babylon.

2592
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:16,670
Alright, guys.

2593
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:20,410
I'm gonna get rid of...

2594
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:20,790
Okay.

2595
02:10:22,470 --> 02:10:24,510
Guys, is there a way to ban grenades?

2596
02:10:24,890 --> 02:10:27,210
Guys, is there...

2597
02:10:27,210 --> 02:10:29,970
What do I put friendly fire on?

2598
02:10:29,970 --> 02:10:30,390
Wait.

2599
02:10:32,230 --> 02:10:34,410
I need to figure out.

2600
02:10:34,650 --> 02:10:37,450
I need to figure out how to ban grenades.

2601
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:39,730
That's...

2602
02:10:39,730 --> 02:10:40,410
No!

2603
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:44,810
What do you mean I can't ban grenades?

2604
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:46,670
What do you mean?

2605
02:10:47,730 --> 02:10:50,990
This team... You guys don't deserve nades after that.

2606
02:10:51,290 --> 02:10:56,850
You guys don't deserve nades after what we went through.

2607
02:10:57,170 --> 02:10:58,390
Wait, is that too small?

2608
02:10:58,590 --> 02:10:59,350
What's a bigger map?

2609
02:11:01,190 --> 02:11:02,730
What's a bigger map, chat?

2610
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:08,300
Which one's bigger?

2611
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:10,840
Red card?

2612
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:12,540
Is red card a big map?

2613
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:15,060
Okay, red card.

2614
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:16,600
Alright.

2615
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:18,120
Are you guys ready?

2616
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:22,420
6-8-L-B-D.

2617
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:25,800
If you played already, let other dragons have a chance to play.

2618
02:11:30,150 --> 02:11:32,150
6-8-L-B-D.

2619
02:11:32,490 --> 02:11:33,530
It's right here.

2620
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:35,410
It's right here.

2621
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:36,690
Oh god, you guys are on Xbox.

2622
02:11:38,030 --> 02:11:40,650
Wait, so you guys have controller on on Steam?

2623
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:45,170
You guys are trying to fucking put aim assist on?

2624
02:11:50,430 --> 02:11:50,910
Alright.

2625
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:52,370
Alright, guys.

2626
02:11:52,450 --> 02:11:53,130
Are you guys ready?

2627
02:11:53,770 --> 02:11:56,090
It's 30... Wait, what's the max chat?

2628
02:11:56,690 --> 02:11:57,910
How many people can be in a lobby?

2629
02:12:01,620 --> 02:12:03,740
How many people can be in a lobby, guys?

2630
02:12:03,940 --> 02:12:04,320
32?

2631
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:05,400
Alright, let's start.

2632
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:06,840
I'll play like two more.

2633
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:08,100
Two more games.

2634
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:09,700
This is fun.

2635
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:14,200
I think COD is fun for mindless, head-empty shooting.

2636
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:16,540
It's a fun just pew-pew game, honestly.

2637
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:21,200
Oh my god, it's soccer.

2638
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:27,020
And now, now that I have my gun, it's over for all of you.

2639
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:27,740
It's...

2640
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:32,020
This truly is play to win.

2641
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:33,880
It truly is.

2642
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:38,300
It's so much play to win, guys.

2643
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:40,620
Like, I now understand.

2644
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,040
Now...

2645
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:43,700
What the fuck?

2646
02:12:43,860 --> 02:12:45,120
Where do I go?

2647
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:53,800
Like, oh my god, this gun is so fun.

2648
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:58,940
Who is fucking buying any smoke grenades, you fuckers?

2649
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:02,900
You fuckers and your smoke grenades.

2650
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:06,480
The fuck?

2651
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:07,640
Can we go on the field?

2652
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:09,220
What the fuck?

2653
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:13,240
It's a strat.

2654
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:16,320
If you use smokes, you're using a crutch.

2655
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:18,160
That's why I said it.

2656
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,280
Use smoke as a crutch, not to actually be a gamer.

2657
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:27,480
You wouldn't need to use smokes if you can aim.

2658
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:29,460
That's all I'm saying.

2659
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:30,020
That's right.

2660
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:30,760
I said it.

2661
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:34,440
If you can aim, you wouldn't need smokes.

2662
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:37,960
Kofi.

2663
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:40,300
It's true.

2664
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:42,300
It's so true.

2665
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:47,480
Using smokes is just a crutch for those who can't aim and rely on visuals.

2666
02:13:51,870 --> 02:13:55,030
I used smokes to ruin the game.

2667
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:56,470
Oh, that's it.

2668
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:58,810
That's it.

2669
02:13:58,890 --> 02:13:59,670
I'm ready.

2670
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:04,290
Wait, where are they?

2671
02:14:05,450 --> 02:14:06,790
I'm fucking ready.

2672
02:14:06,910 --> 02:14:07,630
Get over here.

2673
02:14:07,690 --> 02:14:08,210
Oh my god.

2674
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:08,830
Look at him.

2675
02:14:09,010 --> 02:14:10,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2676
02:14:10,670 --> 02:14:12,390
You thought you got me, right?

2677
02:14:12,490 --> 02:14:12,790
No!

2678
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:17,350
Wait, he did got me.

2679
02:14:20,490 --> 02:14:21,330
That's fucked.

2680
02:14:22,970 --> 02:14:24,970
Wait, I thought I saw something right there.

2681
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:26,490
Wait, what?

2682
02:14:29,390 --> 02:14:30,190
Oh my god.

2683
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,570
Nice.

2684
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:36,510
Come on.

2685
02:14:37,410 --> 02:14:37,890
Yes.

2686
02:14:38,650 --> 02:14:39,590
I did my job.

2687
02:14:40,670 --> 02:14:42,170
Where did all you guys come from?

2688
02:14:43,850 --> 02:14:44,270
Mine.

2689
02:14:45,610 --> 02:14:46,590
What the fuck?

2690
02:14:46,630 --> 02:14:46,910
Oh, wait.

2691
02:14:46,910 --> 02:14:48,730
You're not on my team.

2692
02:14:51,330 --> 02:14:52,070
Yoink.

2693
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:58,130
No!

2694
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:00,170
I was gonna yoink!

2695
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:03,550
No, stop!

2696
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:04,250
Stop!

2697
02:15:04,590 --> 02:15:05,970
Don't make me pull this.

2698
02:15:06,990 --> 02:15:08,930
Don't make me pull this up.

2699
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:14,670
Oh!

2700
02:15:15,170 --> 02:15:16,190
Oh, I dodged it.

2701
02:15:18,110 --> 02:15:19,650
Get over here.

2702
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:22,170
Get your ass over here.

2703
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:22,650
That's right.

2704
02:15:22,810 --> 02:15:23,090
Yes!

2705
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:25,030
I got him.

2706
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:31,630
That's what I'm talking about.

2707
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:33,390
That's fucking right.

2708
02:15:35,530 --> 02:15:36,510
That's right.

2709
02:15:36,630 --> 02:15:36,910
That's right.

2710
02:15:36,910 --> 02:15:37,950
That's what I'm talking about.

2711
02:15:38,050 --> 02:15:38,790
Pure skill.

2712
02:15:39,770 --> 02:15:40,830
Pure fucking skill.

2713
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:42,970
Got him.

2714
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:45,390
I love this gun.

2715
02:15:45,550 --> 02:15:46,670
This gun is so good.

2716
02:15:48,330 --> 02:15:49,670
Something will happen.

2717
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:51,830
Wait, how do you have 53?

2718
02:15:52,750 --> 02:15:53,610
Guys, are you guys okay?

2719
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:55,670
Fucking easiest game of my life.

2720
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:57,150
Yes.

2721
02:15:58,350 --> 02:15:59,590
So easy.

2722
02:15:59,590 --> 02:15:59,750
So easy.

2723
02:16:01,510 --> 02:16:02,630
Pure skill.

2724
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:04,450
They never saw it coming.

2725
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:06,630
Airborne ninja, thank you for the super chat.

2726
02:16:06,730 --> 02:16:07,530
Thank you, thank you.

2727
02:16:07,870 --> 02:16:09,550
If you use smokes, that's a crutch.

2728
02:16:09,630 --> 02:16:11,250
Person who cries when they can't look.

2729
02:16:11,650 --> 02:16:13,590
Thank you for the super chat.

2730
02:16:14,090 --> 02:16:16,730
We all know.

2731
02:16:16,970 --> 02:16:19,830
It's play to win.

2732
02:16:20,230 --> 02:16:21,050
What do you mean?

2733
02:16:22,110 --> 02:16:23,810
I barely had good guns.

2734
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:26,270
I had baby level 1 guns.

2735
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:27,930
What do you mean?

2736
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:33,330
The moment I got a good gun, it was over.

2737
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:34,810
It was over for everybody.

2738
02:16:39,690 --> 02:16:43,210
Okay, let's see.

2739
02:16:44,090 --> 02:16:45,030
Free for all.

2740
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:46,890
That's right, it's free for all time.

2741
02:16:46,910 --> 02:16:49,270
I'm going to make the points so obscenely high.

2742
02:16:49,670 --> 02:16:51,030
So we can actually play the game.

2743
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:55,590
Wait, no.

2744
02:16:55,590 --> 02:17:00,190
I almost started a game where it's just me.

2745
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:03,830
Alright, let's see.

2746
02:17:04,550 --> 02:17:05,350
Game setup.

2747
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:08,990
I almost was just by myself.

2748
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:13,570
Match starting in 3, 2, 1.

2749
02:17:14,450 --> 02:17:15,490
Alright, let's see.

2750
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:16,190
Team.

2751
02:17:19,210 --> 02:17:20,870
Is it domination?

2752
02:17:21,370 --> 02:17:21,970
That's fun.

2753
02:17:21,970 --> 02:17:23,010
Or control?

2754
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:25,390
Take turns attacking and defending the zone.

2755
02:17:25,510 --> 02:17:25,930
Is that?

2756
02:17:26,490 --> 02:17:27,370
I don't even know.

2757
02:17:27,630 --> 02:17:28,090
Kill order?

2758
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:31,170
Wait, which one do you guys want?

2759
02:17:31,290 --> 02:17:33,250
Do you guys want control?

2760
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:34,530
Or domination?

2761
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:39,790
Or capture and hold the hardpoint?

2762
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:40,650
Or hardpoint?

2763
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:43,150
Oh wait, it's 3 points?

2764
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:45,090
Is it 3 point mode?

2765
02:17:46,370 --> 02:17:48,290
Domination, hardpoint, or control?

2766
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:51,150
Domination?

2767
02:17:51,430 --> 02:17:52,670
Okay, we'll do domination.

2768
02:17:53,130 --> 02:17:54,170
Alright, map time.

2769
02:17:54,330 --> 02:17:55,290
Select a map, guys.

2770
02:17:56,310 --> 02:17:57,770
Oh wait, I'll show you guys the map.

2771
02:17:58,750 --> 02:17:59,750
Guys, select a map.

2772
02:18:02,110 --> 02:18:03,330
It's map time.

2773
02:18:04,170 --> 02:18:05,930
Alright, these are all the maps.

2774
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:08,290
We have...

2775
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:10,770
Let's do ones we haven't done before.

2776
02:18:11,070 --> 02:18:11,950
Did we do Babylon yet?

2777
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:12,810
Isn't Babylon small?

2778
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:18,810
3-1, Skud, Skyline, Subsonic, Vault, Vercuta, and Warhead.

2779
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:20,950
Babylon?

2780
02:18:21,270 --> 02:18:21,990
Okay, Babylon.

2781
02:18:22,310 --> 02:18:23,970
Alright guys, are you guys ready for the code?

2782
02:18:24,630 --> 02:18:25,950
Like I said, have you joined before?

2783
02:18:26,450 --> 02:18:29,070
Oh wait, let me make it so that...

2784
02:18:29,070 --> 02:18:29,590
What is it?

2785
02:18:29,650 --> 02:18:30,390
Round swap?

2786
02:18:30,850 --> 02:18:31,770
Round score limit?

2787
02:18:32,150 --> 02:18:32,970
Let's do 400.

2788
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:36,110
Where's the next round?

2789
02:18:36,210 --> 02:18:36,990
Let's do 400.

2790
02:18:38,670 --> 02:18:40,330
400 seems a lot, right?

2791
02:18:40,330 --> 02:18:41,170
Is that enough?

2792
02:18:42,550 --> 02:18:43,610
We'll do 400.

2793
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:44,990
Do you think 400 is enough?

2794
02:18:46,330 --> 02:18:48,430
I've been increasing this more and more.

2795
02:18:49,330 --> 02:18:50,650
Because I don't know.

2796
02:18:51,590 --> 02:18:52,070
Alright.

2797
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:54,090
I'll do 400.

2798
02:18:56,290 --> 02:18:57,910
Is it going to take forever?

2799
02:18:58,410 --> 02:18:58,890
Is it?

2800
02:18:58,950 --> 02:18:59,990
I'll do 350 then.

2801
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:01,070
400 is too low?

2802
02:19:01,170 --> 02:19:01,790
I'm going to do 400.

2803
02:19:02,530 --> 02:19:03,370
I'm going to do 350.

2804
02:19:03,570 --> 02:19:04,370
Guys, I don't know.

2805
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:06,290
I think...

2806
02:19:06,290 --> 02:19:07,950
Bro, max is like...

2807
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:09,390
It doesn't stop!

2808
02:19:09,970 --> 02:19:11,370
Max is 10,000!

2809
02:19:11,870 --> 02:19:13,030
We're not going to do that.

2810
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:14,310
I'll do 350.

2811
02:19:15,530 --> 02:19:16,630
350, okay.

2812
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:17,890
Alright.

2813
02:19:19,970 --> 02:19:20,730
J4XCF.

2814
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:21,670
That's the code.

2815
02:19:22,990 --> 02:19:23,750
J4XCF.

2816
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:33,010
Alright.

2817
02:19:34,170 --> 02:19:34,930
I believe.

2818
02:19:36,170 --> 02:19:37,310
What is...

2819
02:19:37,310 --> 02:19:39,570
32 is the max, I believe.

2820
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:40,690
Wait.

2821
02:19:40,690 --> 02:19:41,670
Oh, I was going to say.

2822
02:19:41,770 --> 02:19:42,770
Is this like free for all?

2823
02:19:44,130 --> 02:19:44,450
Wait.

2824
02:19:46,090 --> 02:19:47,370
Where's the other team?

2825
02:19:48,330 --> 02:19:49,110
Okay, it's 32.

2826
02:19:49,390 --> 02:19:49,770
Let's go.

2827
02:19:50,350 --> 02:19:51,890
I don't remember what domination was.

2828
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:53,650
And the next one, we'll do...

2829
02:19:53,650 --> 02:19:55,810
We'll do free for all as our last game.

2830
02:19:57,330 --> 02:19:59,050

Glad I got to play on a team with you.

2834
02:20:03,470 --> 02:20:05,830
I've been stressed from work and that was what I'm glad you guys had fun.

2835
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:06,590
Thank you for the super chat.

Thank you, thank you.

2837
02:20:07,510 --> 02:20:07,730
Thank you.

2838
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:11,050
I saw some goons rejoin.

2839
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:11,650
Who was it?

2840
02:20:11,770 --> 02:20:12,250
Shame them.

2841
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:13,530

Laughing.

2848
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:23,290
That doesn't follow the rules.

2849
02:20:24,850 --> 02:20:26,950
Keep forgetting mines is like a crap.

2850
02:20:28,210 --> 02:20:29,270

Type their names in chat right now.

2853
02:20:32,910 --> 02:20:33,470
Laughing.

2854
02:20:33,470 --> 02:20:35,230
What the fuck?

2855
02:20:36,190 --> 02:20:37,110
Laughing.

2856
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:38,430
How many?

2857
02:20:38,530 --> 02:20:40,670
How many names?

2858
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:43,850
Fucking how many were they?

2859
02:20:44,290 --> 02:20:45,110
Laughing.

2860
02:20:48,170 --> 02:20:49,670
Holy fuck.

2861
02:20:49,830 --> 02:20:51,310
That was like 20 names.

2862
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:53,950
Oh my god.

2863
02:20:54,610 --> 02:20:59,230
I don't know what they expected from me but that was actually 20 names.

2864
02:20:59,670 --> 02:21:00,090
Laughing.

2865
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:02,090
Every name in existence.

2866
02:21:02,730 --> 02:21:04,250
That was actually crazy.

2867
02:21:05,090 --> 02:21:08,530
I don't know how anybody can survive that.

2868
02:21:08,570 --> 02:21:09,470
That's for sure.

2869
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:10,290
Laughing.

2870
02:21:12,390 --> 02:21:15,270
Someone give me a skin pack right now.

2871
02:21:15,890 --> 02:21:16,350
Whoa.

2872
02:21:19,570 --> 02:21:20,410
Laughing.

2873
02:21:22,770 --> 02:21:23,010
War.

2874
02:21:23,310 --> 02:21:24,790
War is out.

2875
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:26,530
Oh my god.

No.

2878
02:21:31,270 --> 02:21:32,230
Laughing.

2879
02:21:33,250 --> 02:21:36,010
What the fuck is right there?

2880
02:21:37,970 --> 02:21:38,850
Oh my god.

2881
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:42,530
Where am I?

2882
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:44,550
Laughing.

2883
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:46,310
There's so many people.

2884
02:21:47,050 --> 02:21:47,270
Laughing.

2885
02:21:47,270 --> 02:21:49,710
There's so many.

2886
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:52,150
What do I do?

2887
02:21:52,730 --> 02:21:54,970
Oh my god.

2888
02:21:54,970 --> 02:21:56,350
This is war.

2889
02:21:58,810 --> 02:22:00,130
What's going on?

2890
02:22:00,890 --> 02:22:02,410
Is everybody okay?

2891
02:22:03,450 --> 02:22:03,770
Oh.

2892
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:08,510
Guys, I don't feel so good right now.

2893
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:10,730
Why is there fire everywhere?

2894
02:22:12,030 --> 02:22:12,270
Laughing.

2895
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:14,170
I can't see.

2896
02:22:14,710 --> 02:22:15,890
I can't see.

2897
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:16,650
I'm blind.

2898
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:19,370
Oh thank god you're a demon.

2899
02:22:20,590 --> 02:22:21,570
Oh my god.

2900
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:22,630
What's going on?

2901
02:22:22,630 --> 02:22:23,730
Oh.

2902
02:22:25,450 --> 02:22:26,170
Fuck.

2903
02:22:27,070 --> 02:22:27,390
Oh.

2904
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:32,620
Guys, I think to 400.

2905
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:33,920
Holy shit.

2906
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,440
How many planes are in the sky?

2907
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
How many planes are in the sky?

2908
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:38,660
Look up.

2909
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:39,640
Laughing.

2910
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:42,240
Guys.

2911
02:22:43,100 --> 02:22:43,580
Guys.

2912
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:46,700
How do we get this plane out?

2913
02:22:47,320 --> 02:22:48,400
Get it out.

2914
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:50,360
Laughing.

2915
02:22:53,090 --> 02:22:54,470
Oh my god.

2916
02:22:54,470 --> 02:22:56,970
How do we even play this game anyway?

2917
02:22:57,090 --> 02:22:58,910
Who fucking said Babylon?

2918
02:22:59,770 --> 02:23:01,390
Babylon is what?

2919
02:23:01,570 --> 02:23:03,230
That's way too many planes.

2920
02:23:03,930 --> 02:23:04,490
Babylon.

2921
02:23:06,570 --> 02:23:06,990
Okay.

2922
02:23:07,490 --> 02:23:08,330
Okay guys.

2923
02:23:08,450 --> 02:23:12,530
I think we realized that Babylon was not it.

2924
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:13,390
Laughing.

2925
02:23:14,550 --> 02:23:17,290
Babylon truly was not it.

2926
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:17,690
Guys.

2927
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:19,070
Laughing.

2928
02:23:21,050 --> 02:23:22,490
Oh my god.

2929
02:23:22,490 --> 02:23:24,770
It was not it.

2930
02:23:24,950 --> 02:23:25,350
Guys.

2931
02:23:25,530 --> 02:23:27,950
Oh we are not making it to 400.

2932
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:29,370
That is way too many.

2933
02:23:29,990 --> 02:23:30,230
Laughing.

2934
02:23:31,450 --> 02:23:32,110
Grenade.

2935
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:34,250
Just move out.

2936
02:23:34,510 --> 02:23:35,650
Get out of the corner.

2937
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:40,270
We're never gonna hit 400 at this point.

2938
02:23:41,650 --> 02:23:49,810
When they said that 400 might have been too many, I did not realize that 400 might have been too many.

2939
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:51,550
Laughing.

2940
02:23:54,350 --> 02:23:55,170
This is it.

2941
02:23:55,490 --> 02:23:57,170
I'm angry now.

2942
02:23:57,650 --> 02:23:58,870
Somebody smoke for me.

2943
02:23:59,670 --> 02:24:02,050
Somebody smoke for me right now.

2944
02:24:03,550 --> 02:24:05,270
Get over here.

2945
02:24:05,810 --> 02:24:06,530
Laughing.

2946
02:24:07,930 --> 02:24:09,270
I'm angry.

2947
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:10,110
Laughing.

2948
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:15,230
I'm angry.

2949
02:24:15,410 --> 02:24:16,050
I need smoke.

2950
02:24:16,190 --> 02:24:18,430
This is the one moment where I need smoke.

2951
02:24:18,430 --> 02:24:19,710
This is it.

2952
02:24:20,170 --> 02:24:21,050
This is it.

2953
02:24:21,150 --> 02:24:23,630
Guys, I need a smoke right now.

2954
02:24:23,730 --> 02:24:24,390
This is it.

2955
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:25,950
This is it.

2956
02:24:26,110 --> 02:24:26,350
Yeah.

2957
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:28,830
Laughing.

2958
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:29,270
This is it.

2959
02:24:33,850 --> 02:24:34,990
This is it.

2960
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:36,630
This is it.

2961
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:37,230
Laughing.

2962
02:24:40,610 --> 02:24:42,430
Now use your smokes.

2963
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:44,230
This is your moment to shine.

2964
02:24:44,750 --> 02:24:46,850
This is the moment to shine.

2965
02:24:46,850 --> 02:24:47,830
Where are you?

2966
02:24:49,190 --> 02:24:49,430
Laughing.

2967
02:24:52,550 --> 02:24:54,870
I'm fucking scouting right now.

2968
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:56,270
This is it.

2969
02:24:56,830 --> 02:24:58,870
Guys, put all your smokes in.

2970
02:24:58,970 --> 02:25:00,770
This is the only way I can get a kill.

2971
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:01,810
Laughing.

2972
02:25:03,610 --> 02:25:04,830
What's going on?

2973
02:25:04,890 --> 02:25:05,910
Welcome to war.

2974
02:25:06,210 --> 02:25:07,530
Okay, now you can stop guys.

2975
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:08,770
This is too many smokes now.

2976
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:10,510
Guys, I can't see shit.

2977
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:11,570
Guys, please.

2978
02:25:12,890 --> 02:25:14,630
I'm just gonna hide here.

2979
02:25:16,870 --> 02:25:18,330
Nobody will know.

2980
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:19,510
Nobody will know.

2981
02:25:20,710 --> 02:25:22,150
How will they know?

2982
02:25:26,600 --> 02:25:27,930
Nobody will know.

2983
02:25:28,770 --> 02:25:29,470
Laughing.

2984
02:25:30,590 --> 02:25:33,130
Unless they're fucking stream snipers.

2985
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:35,990
Guys, when we hit 100, it's over.

2986
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:41,410
Guys, I didn't realize we're not gonna get to 400, guys.

2987
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:42,810
Laughing.

2988
02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:47,750
Whoever the fuck that was like, 400 is too low.

2989
02:25:47,910 --> 02:25:48,550
Laughing.

2990
02:25:50,510 --> 02:26:00,550
Whoever said that, whoever said that clearly, clearly was like, was fucking with me.

2991
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:02,990
Laughing.

2992
02:26:05,710 --> 02:26:09,670
400 was definitely not too low.

2993
02:26:13,290 --> 02:26:16,110
Oh my God, please.

2994
02:26:18,370 --> 02:26:19,690
It's fine, I'm okay.

2995
02:26:20,490 --> 02:26:21,150
I'm okay.

2996
02:26:23,350 --> 02:26:25,250
Oh, guys, it's okay.

2997
02:26:25,850 --> 02:26:27,150
I'm not okay.

2998
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:28,570
Laughing.

2999
02:26:30,470 --> 02:26:32,150
Oh my God.

3000
02:26:32,670 --> 02:26:36,810
Guys, the moment we hit, okay, 150, because we're losing.

3001
02:26:36,950 --> 02:26:40,190
The moment we hit 150, it's over.

3002
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:44,370
150 is our cap here.

3003
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:46,230
And then we start free for all.

3004
02:26:46,490 --> 02:26:48,230
Oh my God, please.

3005
02:26:48,470 --> 02:26:53,770
I swear by, wherever I feel like, I'm just gonna sit here.

3006
02:26:56,250 --> 02:26:57,150
I'm just sitting here.

3007
02:26:58,530 --> 02:26:59,630
They won't know.

3008
02:26:59,990 --> 02:27:00,790
How would they know?

3009
02:27:01,650 --> 02:27:03,850
How would they know who the fuck is Bomb?

3010
02:27:06,230 --> 02:27:07,570
Sorry, I didn't realize.

3011
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:09,850
I'm going in.

3012
02:27:12,390 --> 02:27:13,950
Guys, that was my car!

3013
02:27:14,970 --> 02:27:15,370
Go!

3014
02:27:15,570 --> 02:27:16,350
Go, everybody!

3015
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:20,850
Alright, 150.

3016
02:27:21,710 --> 02:27:22,110
Guys.

3017
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:25,750
Wait, I thought there was a guy right here.

3018
02:27:25,790 --> 02:27:26,610
What the fuck happened to him?

3019
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:27,170
Did he die?

3020
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:29,070
Wait, I got shocked.

3021
02:27:29,490 --> 02:27:30,590
Oh, he died.

3022
02:27:31,290 --> 02:27:32,710
This is my home now.

3023
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:34,870
I'm just gonna stay here.

3024
02:27:35,550 --> 02:27:36,830
This is my home.

3025
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:39,950
Alright, I guess this is not my home.

3026
02:27:40,210 --> 02:27:44,710
I guess that's not my home.

3027
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:47,010
Wait, he's lagging!

3028
02:27:48,430 --> 02:27:49,510
Wait, that's cheating!

3029
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:53,950
I don't know!

3030
02:27:55,230 --> 02:27:56,510
What's going on?

3031
02:27:57,370 --> 02:27:58,710
I got somebody!

3032
02:27:59,570 --> 02:28:00,810
I don't know how!

3033
02:28:01,610 --> 02:28:03,250
I barely can see what's going on!

3034
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:03,670
There's...

3035
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:05,470
What's going on?

3036
02:28:06,450 --> 02:28:09,410
Where is anything?

3037
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:13,290
The fucking blade!

3038
02:28:13,950 --> 02:28:14,550
I...

3039
02:28:15,060 --> 02:28:15,570
Everywhere!

3040
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:19,600
I spotted the smoke!

3041
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:21,350
There's a fucking...

3042
02:28:21,350 --> 02:28:22,690
How many blades are

3043
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:26,820
here?

3044
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:28,700
There's more!

3045
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:32,180
Get these blades out of here!

3046
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:35,220
Get it out of here.

3047
02:28:36,380 --> 02:28:37,580
Holy shit!

3048
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:40,140
There's so many blades!

3049
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:45,220
Guys, we need to get these blades out of here.

3050
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:48,100
Wait, what happened?

3051
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:50,840
Fucking... Oh my god.

3052
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:53,220
Alright, we're just gonna...

3053
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:55,440
That's stream sniped!

3054
02:28:55,480 --> 02:28:56,480
There's no way!

3055
02:28:57,180 --> 02:28:59,220
Oh, he used the radar?!

3056
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:02,740
Oh my god, you fucking nerd.

3057
02:29:02,740 --> 02:29:03,960
You fucking tryhard nerd.

3058
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:05,740
This is Call of Duty.

3059
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:11,020
You fucking tryhard little whore.

3060
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:12,520
That's right.

3061
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:13,380
Woah!

3062
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:15,500
I'm playing COD.

3063
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:17,540
This is the one game I can call people whores.

3064
02:29:18,760 --> 02:29:23,620
If there was any game where I can call people whores, it's this game.

3065
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:27,740
Bro, please.

3066
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:29,320
Oh my god.

3067
02:29:29,320 --> 02:29:30,360
This is...

3068
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:32,400
Please, where are you?

3069
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:33,880
Oh my god.

3070
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:36,600
Oh, I died.

3071
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:38,740
Stay around him, Mary.

3072
02:29:38,860 --> 02:29:39,520
Go around him.

3073
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:40,500
Get around me.

3074
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:47,840
Okay, nice.

3075
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:49,320
Nice, we're fine.

3076
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:51,320
Nice, I got...

3077
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:53,480
Oh god, I'm okay.

3078
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:55,300
I'm not though, but...

3079
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:55,820
Oh my god!

3080
02:29:59,320 --> 02:29:59,920
Stop!

3081
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:00,520
Stop!

3082
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:04,500
Oh my god, please stop.

3083
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:07,260
Oh my god, please.

3084
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:08,040
I can't.

3085
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:09,820
I'm just a little guy.

3086
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:12,740
I'm just a little...

3087
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:15,480
I'm just a little guy.

3088
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:18,500
Alright, alright, it's over.

3089
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:19,320
I can't.

3090
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:21,500
Guys, it's GG's.

3091
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:22,660
Everybody, I can't.

3092
02:30:22,660 --> 02:30:24,300
Okay, we'll end with a bad kill.

3093
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:27,260
The moment I kill somebody with a bad, it's over.

3094
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:28,300
I can't.

3095
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:29,380
We can't do 400.

3096
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:32,960
We can't do 400 of this.

3097
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:35,340
I can't.

3098
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:38,960
I can't do 400 of this, guys.

3099
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:42,660
I can't.

3100
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,640
400 is one too many.

3101
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:52,900
Who has not shot this fucking helicopter down?

3102
02:30:53,740 --> 02:30:56,500
Why is this helicopter still there?

3103
02:30:57,780 --> 02:30:58,740
Holy shit!

3104
02:30:59,240 --> 02:31:01,400
What is going on?

3105
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:03,080
Oh my god.

3106
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:04,460
Please, I just won one.

3107
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:06,500
Why is this helicopter still there?

3108
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:07,920
Oh shit, false jump.

3109
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:10,280
Oh my god.

3110
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:11,560
I can't.

3111
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:13,380
No one's letting me get close to them.

3112
02:31:13,380 --> 02:31:15,880
They know the moment I get this melee kill, it's over.

3113
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:17,040
They know.

3114
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,220
They're all trying to make sure.

3115
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:20,760
They're all trying to make sure I don't get it.

3116
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:23,360
They don't.

3117
02:31:23,360 --> 02:31:24,840
It's not gonna stop me.

3118
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:28,840
They're all trying to fucking make sure we don't get the melee kill.

3119
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:30,560
Like, don't let her get it!

3120
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:31,720
The game's over!

3121
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:32,340
That's right.

3122
02:31:32,900 --> 02:31:33,560
Yes!

3123
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:35,500
Bye, guys.

3124
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:40,880
Goodbye.

3125
02:31:44,140 --> 02:31:45,900
Got that melee.

3126
02:31:46,340 --> 02:31:49,640
Remember the guy that died to my melee.

3127
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:51,500
Remember him.

3128
02:31:53,780 --> 02:31:54,400
Bro.

3129
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,240
Get padded.

3130
02:31:59,740 --> 02:32:01,000
Remember that guy.

3131
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:03,620
He was the reason why the game ended.

3132
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:04,400
Shame.

3133
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,600
Shame.

3134
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:10,940
He was the guy that ended the game for all of us.

3135
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:11,660
Shame.

3136
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:12,900
Shame.

3137
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:17,020
How could you do this to us?

3138
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:21,000
Alright, last game, guys.

3139
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:21,600
Last game.

3140
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:23,380
I'm gonna do a free-for-all for the last one.

3141
02:32:25,360 --> 02:32:25,880
Alright.

3142
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:27,500
Private match.

3143
02:32:28,360 --> 02:32:28,880
Shame.

3144
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:31,020
Alright.

3145
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:31,960
Game setup.

3146
02:32:32,900 --> 02:32:33,760
Guys, okay.

3147
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,660
Guys, don't fuck with me this time.

3148
02:32:35,740 --> 02:32:36,340
I need to know.

3149
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:38,120
What is the biggest map?

3150
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:41,200
What is...

3151
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:43,580
Guys, we actually need a big map.

3152
02:32:43,940 --> 02:32:46,800
You guys have all gave me small maps.

3153
02:32:48,020 --> 02:32:50,920
Like, every single map was... Okay.

3154
02:32:51,140 --> 02:32:53,240
It was so fucking small.

3155
02:32:55,460 --> 02:32:58,180
Was the mosh pit the size of a bathroom?

3156
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:00,160
Glad I got to join a map.

3157
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:01,640
Thank you for having me.

3158
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:02,860
Thank you for the super chat.

3159
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:03,240
Thank you.

3160
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:04,420
Is Borkuta big?

3161
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:06,360
Alright, Borkuta.

3162
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:06,940
Okay.

3163
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:08,500
Borkuta, free-for-all.

3164
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:12,760
The score is 70... Okay.

3165
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:13,320
60.

3166
02:33:15,340 --> 02:33:15,880
55.

3167
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:18,740
There's no way you guys can get to 55 that fast.

3168
02:33:19,540 --> 02:33:20,440
There's no way.

3169
02:33:22,860 --> 02:33:23,720
You know what?

3170
02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:24,320
60.

3171
02:33:24,580 --> 02:33:25,180
There is a way.

3172
02:33:25,320 --> 02:33:26,380
There's 32 of you guys.

3173
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:27,560
One of you guys is gonna feed.

3174
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:30,140
Nevermind.

3175
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:30,860
There is a way.

3176
02:33:30,980 --> 02:33:31,880
One of you will feed.

3177
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:32,640
Okay.

3178
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:35,340
This is it.

3179
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:39,440
K9W44

3180
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:53,660
K9W44 K9W44 I will kick someone out that has played this game already, guys.

3181
02:33:53,740 --> 02:33:54,520
Get ready to shame.

3182
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:56,400
This is your moment to shine.

3183
02:33:56,860 --> 02:33:58,520
We're calling you out here.

3184
02:33:58,800 --> 02:33:59,860
Get ready to shame.

3185
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:03,640
I'm ready to shame all of you.

3186
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:07,600
Wait.

3187
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:11,840
I need to know how to- I don't want to accidentally like doctured profile of me..

3188
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:15,440
I didn't make sure.

3189
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:15,820
Okay.

3190
02:34:16,420 --> 02:34:16,960
I didn't make sure.

3191
02:34:17,100 --> 02:34:18,800
Okay, that's how you do it, kick player.

3192
02:34:18,980 --> 02:34:19,340
All right.

3193
02:34:19,700 --> 02:34:22,320
I remember who were top fraggers.

3194
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:22,920
All right.

3195
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:24,320
All right, guys.

3196
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:25,500
Get rid of shame.

3197
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:27,260
Call people out.

3198
02:34:28,140 --> 02:34:31,640
Do you recognize anybody that has played before?

3199
02:34:32,260 --> 02:34:33,320
Get rid...

3200
02:34:35,400 --> 02:34:36,560
Name them!

3201
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:40,060
Name them all!

3202
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:41,920
Except for... where is he?

3203
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:42,360
Where is he?

3204
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:43,240
Kobenny?

3205
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:44,320
Where is he?

3206
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:45,920
Where's Kobenny?

3207
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:47,120
Kobenny!

3208
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:49,240
Kobenny!

3209
02:34:49,880 --> 02:34:51,760
Justify yourself right now.

3210
02:34:54,820 --> 02:34:56,520
If you're in... oh, he left.

3211
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:57,100
Okay, there.

3212
02:34:57,420 --> 02:34:58,220
That's how you do it.

3213
02:34:58,260 --> 02:34:59,340
That's how you shame, guys.

3214
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:02,100
That's how... that's how you shame.

3215
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:03,700
He instantly left.

3216
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:04,400
Okay.

3217
02:35:05,380 --> 02:35:06,420
Anyone else?

3218
02:35:06,900 --> 02:35:08,120
Anyone else ready to shame?

3219
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:09,320
Anyone?

3220
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:12,360
Anyone else ready to shame?

3221
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:13,620
All right.

3222
02:35:15,740 --> 02:35:17,280
Good boy, Joe Smith.

3223
02:35:17,540 --> 02:35:18,460
Where are... Joe Smith!

3224
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:21,940
Explain yourself, Mr. Joe Smith!

3225
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:23,760
That's right!

3226
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:25,540
Don't make me kick you.

3227
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:27,680
Why did I...

3228
02:35:28,470 --> 02:35:28,780
Shame!

3229
02:35:29,540 --> 02:35:30,160
Shame!

3230
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:30,900
Shame!

3231
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:33,140
All right.

3232
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:36,920
Not only am I gonna kick you, I'm gonna report... I won't report you.

3233
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:37,740
Allen?

3234
02:35:38,480 --> 02:35:38,860
Allen!

3235
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:42,020
Shame!

3236
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:42,720
You know what?

3237
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:43,640
I'm gonna report you, too.

3238
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:44,540
I'm gonna...

3239
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:51,740
Your username was offensive.

3240
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:54,100
Shame!

3241
02:35:56,300 --> 02:35:57,180
Shame!

3242
02:35:58,720 --> 02:35:59,340
All right.

3243
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:02,740
All right.

3244
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:03,920
Who else?

3245
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:05,420
Who else?

3246
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:06,980
Kick and report.

3247
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:10,860
You know the rules!

3248
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:12,020
Dongle!

3249
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:13,680
I remember Dongle!

3250
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:15,020
Shame!

3251
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:16,020
Shame!

3252
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:16,760
Shame!

3253
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:19,640
Um...

3254
02:36:19,640 --> 02:36:23,240
That not-joke-keeper killed me on RCXD earlier.

3255
02:36:23,700 --> 02:36:25,380
Kick them, BambiBoy.

3256
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:26,980
Thank you with a super chat.

3257
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:29,020
Shame their Dongle!

3258
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:32,000
All right.

3259
02:36:32,120 --> 02:36:32,660
Who else?

3260
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:34,540
Who else?

3261
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:35,940
Who else, guys?

3262
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:38,620
Who else in here that we need to shame?

3263
02:36:39,220 --> 02:36:40,440
Thanks for the mad shame.

3264
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:42,660
I got stuck on the largest map with a shotgun.

3265
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,380
Back to the Zombo Camo grind.

3266
02:36:45,380 --> 02:36:46,940
Demon, thank you with a super chat.

3267
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:47,300
Thank you.

3268
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:48,080
Thank you.

3269
02:36:48,540 --> 02:36:49,180
All right.

3270
02:36:49,320 --> 02:36:50,560
Kick LL's UCK?

3271
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:51,240
Where are they?

3272
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:52,600
I'm ready to shame them.

3273
02:36:53,180 --> 02:36:53,840
Where are they?

3274
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:54,560
LL?

3275
02:36:54,740 --> 02:36:55,200
All right.

3276
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,040
All right.

3277
02:36:56,420 --> 02:36:56,820
Shame!

3278
02:36:57,680 --> 02:36:58,080
Shame!

3279
02:36:58,800 --> 02:36:59,100
Shame!

3280
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:01,340
All right.

3281
02:37:01,380 --> 02:37:02,160
There we go.

3282
02:37:02,980 --> 02:37:03,280
All right.

3283
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:04,100
I think we're ready.

3284
02:37:04,220 --> 02:37:04,900
Are we okay?

3285
02:37:05,160 --> 02:37:06,100
Have we shamed everybody?

3286
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:07,880
I think we shamed everybody.

3287
02:37:07,880 --> 02:37:09,100
We have one more spot left.

3288
02:37:09,860 --> 02:37:12,780
Okay, now you guys are just kicking random people because you didn't get in.

3289
02:37:14,340 --> 02:37:14,740
Like...

3290
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:20,840
Now you guys are actually... I'm pretty sure you guys are kicking around.

3291
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:21,960
You're like, I didn't get in.

3292
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:22,920
I'm going to shame these people.

3293
02:37:23,220 --> 02:37:24,020
So then they'll get kicked.

3294
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:32,360
You're just like, wait, she's not even double checking.

3295
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:33,620
She believes anything.

3296
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:39,360
If I can't get in, no one can.

3297
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:42,120
Nobody can get in.

3298
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:45,340
Oh, shit.

3299
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:45,820
Okay.

3300
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:46,680
Shame!

3301
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:48,040
Shame!

3302
02:37:48,140 --> 02:37:48,520
Shame!

3303
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:50,480
Okay.

3304
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:51,520
One more.

3305
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:51,860
All right.

3306
02:37:51,940 --> 02:37:52,960
We have another spot in.

3307
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:54,440
We got another...

3308
02:37:54,980 --> 02:37:56,420
We got... All right.

3309
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:57,520
That's all the shaming.

3310
02:37:57,760 --> 02:37:58,580
Okay, here we go.

3311
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:00,260
Last game.

3312
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:01,780
This is the last game.

3313
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:03,320
How dare you?

3314
02:38:05,020 --> 02:38:06,840
You're just like, I didn't get in.

3315
02:38:06,880 --> 02:38:08,100
I'm going to shame everybody.

3316
02:38:08,100 --> 02:38:13,780
And then hopefully, the more people Doki kicks, the more of a chance I can actually get in.

3317
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:17,800
All right.

3318
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:20,960
All right, here we go.

3319
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:21,940
Last game, guys.

3320
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:24,100
Last game, and then we're going to...

3321
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:27,100
And then we're going to hang out.

3322
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:32,960
I forgot this was free-for-all.

3323
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:34,440
Holy shit.

3324
02:38:34,900 --> 02:38:37,060
I forgot we were playing free-for-all.

3325
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:38,760
It's like, what happened?

3326
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:40,480
What happened?

3327
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:43,860
Holy shit.

3328
02:38:44,440 --> 02:38:45,640
Oh, my God.

3329
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:47,540
Jesus Christ.

3330
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:50,520
We all just logged in to fucking die.

3331
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:51,920
That's crazy.

3332
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:55,540
Holy fuck.

3333
02:38:56,620 --> 02:38:58,880
Bro, this is actually scary.

3334
02:38:59,240 --> 02:39:01,020
This is so scary.

3335
02:39:03,820 --> 02:39:04,660
Oh, I see.

3336
02:39:06,360 --> 02:39:08,120
The fuck you doing there?

3337
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:11,880
Oh, he got shot from this side.

3338
02:39:15,820 --> 02:39:16,340
Nice.

3339
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:19,520
No!

3340
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:21,100
I'm jinxed!

3341
02:39:22,540 --> 02:39:23,680
Son of a bitch!

3342
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:25,140
Oh, shit.

3343
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:25,540
No!

3344
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:26,920
God damn it, I was jinxing.

3345
02:39:27,580 --> 02:39:30,780
There's so many... This is like from a game with zero players.

3346
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,920
This was a map where I couldn't find anybody.

3347
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:35,580
And now there's like 200 people.

3348
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:37,020
Oh, my God.

3349
02:39:38,660 --> 02:39:39,460
Okay.

3350
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,320
Oh, my God.

3351
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:49,660
It's just... Everybody just literally gets spawned again.

3352
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:50,980
Holy shit.

3353
02:39:52,240 --> 02:39:53,560
Holy fuck.

3354
02:39:54,060 --> 02:39:56,640
Like, literally everybody spawned in there.

3355
02:39:56,980 --> 02:39:57,680
That's actually...

3356
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:58,840
Oh, shit!

3357
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:01,200
Fucking... That's fine.

3358
02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:05,260
I don't know, but that was a spawn right there.

3359
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:07,540
That was a crazy spawn.

3360
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:11,120
Oh, my God.

3361
02:40:11,180 --> 02:40:12,500
That was such a crazy spawn.

3362
02:40:12,620 --> 02:40:13,600
Oh, my God.

3363
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:20,420
No!

3364
02:40:31,970 --> 02:40:33,050
I'll take your shotgun.

3365
02:40:36,470 --> 02:40:40,410
Still got it!

3366
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:41,930
I still got it!

3367
02:40:44,970 --> 02:40:47,290
Holy fuck, I still managed to get it.

3368
02:40:47,370 --> 02:40:48,030
That's crazy.

3369
02:40:50,930 --> 02:40:51,590
That's fine.

3370
02:40:52,090 --> 02:40:53,130
I take those.

3371
02:40:53,710 --> 02:40:55,030
Actually, I take those.

3372
02:40:55,930 --> 02:40:57,290
That was such a good...

3373
02:40:57,290 --> 02:40:59,570
That was such a good kill.

3374
02:41:00,490 --> 02:41:02,470
Holy fuck, I take those kills.

3375
02:41:03,430 --> 02:41:04,070
Oh, my God.

3376
02:41:04,630 --> 02:41:05,770
It's okay, I take it.

3377
02:41:16,540 --> 02:41:17,440
Oh, my God.

3378
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:18,040
Come on.

3379
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:19,300
No, I fucking knew it.

3380
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:19,980
I saw you, too.

3381
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:21,060
I just knew it.

3382
02:41:21,160 --> 02:41:22,860
I knew I was gonna get spawned behind.

3383
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:24,820
I fucking knew it.

3384
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:25,280
No!

3385
02:41:27,800 --> 02:41:31,660
Oh, my God.

3386
02:41:32,060 --> 02:41:33,280
No, that's mine!

3387
02:41:33,500 --> 02:41:34,580
No, that's mine!

3388
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:39,480
Bro, I don't even think I have time to put RC car out at this rate.

3389
02:41:41,380 --> 02:41:43,660
There's so many things going on.

3390
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,180
I don't think I even set it up.

3391
02:41:46,480 --> 02:41:47,980
Fucking hell, what is this spot?

3392
02:41:51,060 --> 02:41:51,620
Please!

3393
02:41:52,060 --> 02:41:53,260
I can't exist!

3394
02:42:00,410 --> 02:42:01,730
Oh, my God.

3395
02:42:01,930 --> 02:42:03,670
I literally can't exist.

3396
02:42:04,310 --> 02:42:05,530
Where is hell?

3397
02:42:06,570 --> 02:42:08,390
I can't exist at all.

3398
02:42:08,770 --> 02:42:10,950
How is somebody at 41?

3399
02:42:12,150 --> 02:42:14,250
What have you been doing?

3400
02:42:23,650 --> 02:42:25,330
Oh, my God.

3401
02:42:25,390 --> 02:42:26,090
What have you been doing?

3402
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:29,030
Oh, my God.

3403
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:30,190
What have you been doing?

3404
02:42:30,730 --> 02:42:32,630
What actually have you been doing?

3405
02:42:33,850 --> 02:42:35,090
What the fuck?

3406
02:42:36,670 --> 02:42:38,110
Just click heads.

3407
02:42:38,650 --> 02:42:41,550
What are your spawns to be able to do that?

3408
02:42:44,890 --> 02:42:45,570
It's okay.

3409
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:46,130
I got two.

3410
02:42:47,030 --> 02:42:47,250
Okay.

3411
02:42:53,590 --> 02:42:55,150
I just got here!

3412
02:43:01,230 --> 02:43:02,510
Okay, I've got the double.

3413
02:43:02,510 --> 02:43:03,230
Wait, what?

3414
02:43:03,390 --> 02:43:03,950
You're not dead?

3415
02:43:04,770 --> 02:43:05,110
How?

3416
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:07,410
Please, let me live!

3417
02:43:08,430 --> 02:43:11,010
There's so many people in my ass right now.

3418
02:43:13,230 --> 02:43:14,950
There's so many people.

3419
02:43:15,710 --> 02:43:16,470
Oh, my God.

3420
02:43:17,270 --> 02:43:18,110
Wait, what?

3421
02:43:18,970 --> 02:43:19,250
What?

3422
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:20,730
What happened?

3423
02:43:21,390 --> 02:43:22,010
No!

3424
02:43:22,330 --> 02:43:23,310
What happened?

3425
02:43:24,050 --> 02:43:25,630
No, the game crashed.

3426
02:43:27,230 --> 02:43:28,930
Oh, my God, it crashed.

3427
02:43:30,730 --> 02:43:31,890
Oh, my God.

3428
02:43:31,890 --> 02:43:32,610
No!

3429
02:43:34,310 --> 02:43:35,130
No!

3430
02:43:35,510 --> 02:43:37,050
No, it crashed.

3431
02:43:37,370 --> 02:43:40,550
I can't believe this every time.

3432
02:43:41,030 --> 02:43:42,050
Oh, my God.

3433
02:43:42,590 --> 02:43:43,290
It's okay.

3434
02:43:43,950 --> 02:43:45,130
Top ten.

3435
02:43:45,550 --> 02:43:46,730
Guys, top ten.

3436
02:43:47,530 --> 02:43:48,250
Top ten.

3437
02:43:51,090 --> 02:43:52,250
That's fine.

3438
02:43:52,370 --> 02:43:53,290
We got top ten.

3439
02:43:53,450 --> 02:43:54,710
I'll take it.

3440
02:43:55,230 --> 02:43:57,150
I'll take it.

3441
02:44:03,730 --> 02:44:04,650
Oh, my God.

3442
02:44:05,210 --> 02:44:06,110
Oh, my God.

3443
02:44:07,310 --> 02:44:07,670
Okay.

3444
02:44:11,690 --> 02:44:12,930
All right, that was fun.

3445
02:44:13,230 --> 02:44:14,410
I actually enjoyed it a lot.

3446
02:44:14,530 --> 02:44:20,330
I think Call of Duty is really fun when you just want to shoot things.

3447
02:44:20,490 --> 02:44:23,390
And I also had a lot of fun just shooting things.

3448
02:44:23,790 --> 02:44:26,630
I just had a lot of fun being pew, pew, pew, pew.

3449
02:44:28,550 --> 02:44:30,950
It was definitely quite enjoyable.

3450
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:37,690
Yeah, it's a nice brain-off game where you just want to shoot a lot of things and just get kills and stuff.

3451
02:44:37,710 --> 02:44:38,550
Just fragging out.

3452
02:44:38,810 --> 02:44:47,670
I had a great time, just honestly, just fragging out and just, you know, seeing where that takes me.

3453
02:44:50,850 --> 02:44:51,770
Hey, guys.

3454
02:44:52,310 --> 02:44:53,570
That's me swap over.

3455
02:44:53,870 --> 02:44:54,590
I'm going to swap over.

3456
02:44:55,090 --> 02:44:56,470
Yeah, I definitely enjoyed it.

3457
02:44:56,510 --> 02:44:58,670
Everyone made me do a member stream of Call of Duty.

3458
02:44:59,650 --> 02:45:00,690
But zombies?

3459
02:45:01,310 --> 02:45:05,230
Definitely not anytime soon because I want to get like I want to do as a collab.

3460
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:07,010
So we'll wait on that.

3461
02:45:08,430 --> 02:45:08,950
And...

3462
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:10,450
Oh, we have super chat reading time.

3463
02:45:10,510 --> 02:45:11,550
It's been a while since we...

3464
02:45:11,550 --> 02:45:12,390
Wait, what's this?

3465
02:45:12,470 --> 02:45:13,550
There's a goal sheet?

3466
02:45:14,070 --> 02:45:14,850
What is this?

3467
02:45:15,450 --> 02:45:17,970
Make super chat more fun with a goal?

3468
02:45:22,420 --> 02:45:23,360
Wait, really?

3469
02:45:24,820 --> 02:45:25,820
Oh, my God.

3470
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:27,300
Wait, they have a new thing.

3471
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:28,680
Wait.

3472
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:35,500
Okay.

3473
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:40,540
Wait, look at this.

3474
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:43,880
Oh, wait.

3475
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:44,880
What does it look like?

3476
02:45:47,260 --> 02:45:48,380
You get...

3477
02:45:48,380 --> 02:45:49,200
Wait, wait, wait.

3478
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:50,080
Wait, wait.

3479
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:51,100
Let me do another one.

3480
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:53,120
That's so funny.

3481
02:45:53,580 --> 02:45:54,020
Wait.

3482
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:55,400
There's...

3483
02:45:55,400 --> 02:45:56,820
There's a goal now.

3484
02:45:57,180 --> 02:45:58,200
You get nothing.

3485
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:03,320
Oh, my God.

3486
02:46:03,360 --> 02:46:03,660
Wait.

3487
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:03,880
That's...

3488
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:05,540
That's so funny.

3489
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:08,660
They actually have, like, an actual...

3490
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:11,300
Yo, you get nothing.

3491
02:46:12,380 --> 02:46:13,960
What a steal.

3492
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:15,620
What a fucking...

3493
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:16,740
Wait, that's new.

3494
02:46:17,260 --> 02:46:17,840
Oh, my God.

3495
02:46:17,860 --> 02:46:18,620
That's cool.

3496
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:20,060
That's funny.

3497
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:22,160
You can set goals and stuff.

3498
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:22,940
I, like, looked over.

3499
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:24,180
I was like, the fuck is that?

3500
02:46:24,220 --> 02:46:25,800
They must have implemented that today.

3501
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:27,620
That's crazy.

3502
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:28,880
Give me...

3503
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,440
Yay, nothing.

3504
02:46:33,660 --> 02:46:35,000
It's at the very top.

3505
02:46:35,240 --> 02:46:35,660
See?

3506
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:36,540
It's, like, goal.

3507
02:46:36,680 --> 02:46:38,000
And it even has, like, a timer.

3508
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:38,960
Nothing!

3509
02:46:40,300 --> 02:46:42,160
MrBrokenFat, thank you for the Akasupa.

3510
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:43,700
Thank you.

3511
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:50,560
Congratulations!

3512
02:46:51,700 --> 02:46:52,980
You got nothing!

3513
02:46:54,140 --> 02:46:55,260
Let's go!

3514
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:00,800
Whoa!

3515
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:02,580
Shoutout to him!

3516
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:04,060
Nothing!

3517
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:07,700
That is...

3518
02:47:07,700 --> 02:47:09,960
That is the biggest goal of all time.

3519
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:11,100
Nothing.

3520
02:47:13,660 --> 02:47:14,760
That's so funny.

3521
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:15,500
I didn't realize that...

3522
02:47:16,460 --> 02:47:17,740
I didn't realize...

3523
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:19,820
That was a thing there.

3524
02:47:20,980 --> 02:47:22,320
That's so funny.

3525
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:26,520
The game died while I was in the middle of a knife assassination.

3526
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:27,600
But GG, Doki.

3527
02:47:30,140 --> 02:47:31,020
Some pretty good stuff.

3528
02:47:31,100 --> 02:47:32,160
Hopefully, you can see more in the future.

3529
02:47:32,260 --> 02:47:33,620
Yeah, I definitely want to do...

3530
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:34,380
More member...

3531
02:47:34,380 --> 02:47:35,700
I want to do more member streams of that.

3532
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:37,180
Because that was, like, really fun in general.

3533
02:47:37,740 --> 02:47:38,700
Thank you for the...

3534
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:40,800
Thank you for the super chat.

3535
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:42,800
Jakado, thank you.

3536
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:43,460
Thank you.

3537
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:46,700
Yeah, we can actually do real goals with that.

3538
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:47,700
Yeah, one...

3539
02:47:48,580 --> 02:47:49,380
Nothing, please.

3540
02:47:50,100 --> 02:47:51,520
John, thank you for the Akasupa.

3541
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:52,680
Thank you, thank you.

3542
02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:54,520
Dan, thank you for the Akasupa.

3543
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:55,700
Thank you, thank you.

3544
02:47:57,660 --> 02:47:59,540
Oh God, so much nothing!

3545
02:48:00,380 --> 02:48:01,420
Yeah, I think I...

3546
02:48:01,420 --> 02:48:03,360
I'm gonna wait until Gun Game is out.

3547
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:07,420
I think it'll be very fun with Gun Game in general as well.

3548
02:48:07,440 --> 02:48:10,460
Can this nothing be used as a text right now?

3549
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:14,100
Excuse me, this was a business expense.

3550
02:48:14,380 --> 02:48:15,220
What kind of business?

3551
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:16,140
Nothing.

3552
02:48:18,360 --> 02:48:19,960
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3553
02:48:20,540 --> 02:48:21,500
Thank you, thank you.

3554
02:48:21,780 --> 02:48:24,300
Mr. Stan, thank you for the super Akasupa.

3555
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:25,300
Thank you, thank you.

3556
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:27,780
Finally, a cause I can get behind.

3557
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:28,560
Nothing.

3558
02:48:28,560 --> 02:48:30,560
The confetti.

3559
02:48:33,740 --> 02:48:34,180
Woo!

3560
02:48:34,360 --> 02:48:36,040
Let's celebrate, everybody!

3561
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:37,260
Nothing!

3562
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:39,760
We accomplished it!

3563
02:48:40,180 --> 02:48:40,660
Yay!

3564
02:48:41,300 --> 02:48:44,080
Thank you for making your possible.

3565
02:48:44,820 --> 02:48:46,440
You get nothing!

3566
02:48:48,380 --> 02:48:49,300
Let's

3567
02:48:52,690 --> 02:48:53,090
go!

3568
02:48:53,510 --> 02:48:54,810
Shout out to the dragons!

3569
02:48:57,550 --> 02:48:59,250
Thank you again.

3570
02:48:59,670 --> 02:48:59,950
And...

3571
02:49:01,870 --> 02:49:03,430
How dare you give us confetti?

3572
02:49:03,530 --> 02:49:05,050
I was promised nothing.

3573
02:49:05,930 --> 02:49:06,850
Nox, thank you for the super chat.

3574
02:49:06,930 --> 02:49:07,470
Thank you, thank you.

3575
02:49:07,550 --> 02:49:08,970
Thanks for having me on your last game.

3576
02:49:09,110 --> 02:49:10,250
Gigi's back to the grind.

3577
02:49:11,330 --> 02:49:12,370
Frosty, thank you for the super chat.

3578
02:49:12,470 --> 02:49:13,170
Thank you, thank you.

3579
02:49:13,190 --> 02:49:15,090
That was a good break from camel grinding.

3580
02:49:15,330 --> 02:49:15,950
Thanks, Doki.

3581
02:49:16,290 --> 02:49:17,230
Thank you for your super chat.

3582
02:49:17,330 --> 02:49:17,890
Thank you, thank you.

3583
02:49:17,930 --> 02:49:19,190
And Kaiko, thank you for the super chat.

3584
02:49:19,330 --> 02:49:20,290
Thank you, thank you.

3585
02:49:24,520 --> 02:49:28,440
But yeah, definitely had a lot of fun with that.

3586
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:34,480
It was a nice head-empty pew-pew type of game that I'd definitely like to play again with member goons.

3587
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:38,260
If you're a member, not anytime soon though.

3588
02:49:38,900 --> 02:49:42,980
But I definitely would love to play it again in the future with you guys.

3589
02:49:43,400 --> 02:49:48,620
Especially because I can do more custom lobbies again for that.

3590
02:49:50,040 --> 02:49:55,840
I think I did pretty well for my first time playing Call of Duty Black Ops.

3591
02:49:55,840 --> 02:49:58,960
You know, when you go in with no knowledge about anything.

3592
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:03,660
And then your fucking third game, you get put into a level 30 lobby.

3593
02:50:07,480 --> 02:50:11,100
Where everybody has all the fucking attachments on their guns.

3594
02:50:11,260 --> 02:50:14,680
And then I'm out here fucking vulturing and being like, give me your gun.

3595
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:19,540
Just fucking scavenging dead body guns.

3596
02:50:19,640 --> 02:50:20,620
And just like, give me your gun.

3597
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:22,900
Please, I need something.

3598
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:26,060
I need something, please.

3599
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:30,960
Okay, let me scroll all the way down.

3600
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,640
T-Bird, thank you for the super chat.

3601
02:50:34,740 --> 02:50:35,720
Thank you, thank you.

3602
02:50:38,740 --> 02:50:40,340
Oh, I already wished you a happy birthday.

3603
02:50:40,500 --> 02:50:42,020
That was for your birthday.

3604
02:50:44,420 --> 02:50:45,740
Templar, thank you for the super chat.

3605
02:50:45,820 --> 02:50:46,880
Thank you, thank you.

3606
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:51,140
Doki has the vibes of someone who likes to... Okay, I'm not gonna finish that sentence.

3607
02:50:51,140 --> 02:50:51,640
Oh yeah!

3608
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:52,520
Okay, life update.

3609
02:50:52,640 --> 02:50:54,340
Let me give you guys... Before I read more...

3610
02:50:54,340 --> 02:50:55,540
Let me get... Wait, what's this?

3611
02:50:56,240 --> 02:50:58,460
Let me give you guys some...

3612
02:50:58,460 --> 02:50:59,240
Life updates.

3613
02:50:59,360 --> 02:50:59,620
Okay.

3614
02:51:00,680 --> 02:51:02,300
I wrote a list of everything.

3615
02:51:02,420 --> 02:51:05,280
When you're bored for three fucking hours at the hair salon, you write a list.

3616
02:51:09,960 --> 02:51:11,160
Katis, thank you for the super chat.

3617
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:12,000
Thank you, thank you.

3618
02:51:12,140 --> 02:51:14,800
Doki's streams strangely coincide to my work times at the lab.

3619
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:19,960
Thank you for the laughs while I wait for my spectroscopy data.

3620
02:51:19,960 --> 02:51:21,580
Take my last $5.

3621
02:51:21,720 --> 02:51:22,520
Thank you for the super chat.

3622
02:51:22,580 --> 02:51:23,540
Thank you, thank you.

3623
02:51:23,660 --> 02:51:24,260
See, guys?

3624
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:25,320
See?

3625
02:51:25,640 --> 02:51:26,900
Chat reflects the streamer.

3626
02:51:27,020 --> 02:51:28,300
And that means...

3627
02:51:28,300 --> 02:51:32,400
If you have a degree in science and you're working in a lab...

3628
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:36,960
Solving cancer or other terminal diseases...

3629
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:40,960
That means I also take credit for that.

3630
02:51:41,380 --> 02:51:42,840
I'm just as smart, too.

3631
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:46,220
Thank you for the super chat.

3632
02:51:46,300 --> 02:51:47,140
Thank you, thank you.

3633
02:51:48,900 --> 02:51:49,480
Oh, yeah.

3634
02:51:49,720 --> 02:51:50,620
Before... Okay, guys.

3635
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:52,260
I have, like... I need to Amazon Prime.

3636
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:53,100
Guys, I need help.

3637
02:51:53,480 --> 02:51:54,160
Help me buy a printer.

3638
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:57,040
I need... What's a good printer?

3639
02:51:57,320 --> 02:51:58,880
We don't need the most expensive printer.

3640
02:51:59,000 --> 02:51:59,560
We just need stuff...

3641
02:51:59,560 --> 02:52:02,440
I need to print stuff out for, like, business stuff.

3642
02:52:02,680 --> 02:52:06,220
Because, like, I'm tired of... I'm really tired of, like...

3643
02:52:06,700 --> 02:52:10,000
Taking... Like, getting my phone out at the bank and being, like...

3644
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:13,280
Here's, like... I need to do a bank trans... Wire transfer...

3645
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:15,440
Guys, by the way, I fucking hate...

3646
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:18,500
I realize that Canadian banks are so bad...

3647
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:21,580
Because we're so backwards to the fact that we have to go to the branch...

3648
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:22,900
To do wire transfers.

3649
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:25,380
Because, like, apparently...

3650
02:52:25,380 --> 02:52:27,460
I was telling one of my friends about it, and they're like...

3651
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:27,780
The fuck?

3652
02:52:27,820 --> 02:52:28,540
You don't do it online?

3653
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:30,020
And I was like, no, you have to go to the branch.

3654
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:31,300
And then they're like, no, like...

3655
02:52:31,300 --> 02:52:33,400
And then they were telling me how, like...

3656
02:52:33,400 --> 02:52:33,760
Oh, yeah.

3657
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:35,460
Canada is apparently one of the few countries...

3658
02:52:35,460 --> 02:52:37,820
Where you have to go to the branch to do wire transfers...

3659
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:39,180
And do stuff at the branch.

3660
02:52:39,380 --> 02:52:40,880
Because they are so fucking backwards.

3661
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:44,120
And... No, it's not just... No, it's not just the bank.

3662
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:46,880
It's every... Almost... It's every Canadian bank.

3663
02:52:47,140 --> 02:52:49,540
You have to go there to do it.

3664
02:52:49,960 --> 02:52:51,620
And then it's not...

3665
02:52:51,620 --> 02:52:54,700
I don't believe the security thing.

3666
02:52:56,940 --> 02:53:01,340
Because if other countries can get away with it...

3667
02:53:01,660 --> 02:53:04,420
Like, why would, like, Canada be the only...

3668
02:53:04,740 --> 02:53:07,220
One of the few countries that are like...

3669
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:09,060
No, guys, it's a security thing.

3670
02:53:10,340 --> 02:53:13,380
If that's the case, what about America?

3671
02:53:13,380 --> 02:53:15,380
We're literally next to America.

3672
02:53:15,620 --> 02:53:16,540
Like, what the fuck?

3673
02:53:24,100 --> 02:53:25,520
Theo, thank you for the super chat.

3674
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:26,340
Thank you, thank you.

3675
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:27,140
Don't get HP.

3676
02:53:27,340 --> 02:53:29,220
They're an awful brand who will break your machine...

3677
02:53:29,220 --> 02:53:31,960
And do everything they can to squeeze the money.

3678
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:35,660
Guys, I have three hours to Amazon Prime.

3679
02:53:35,800 --> 02:53:37,800
Guys, give me, like, a name.

3680
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:40,620
Guys, I'm looking at Amazon right now.

3681
02:53:40,640 --> 02:53:41,760
And I want it tomorrow.

3682
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:44,240
Because I need to print out this bank stuff.

3683
02:53:45,940 --> 02:53:48,860
Alright, here are the results I have.

3684
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:51,080
I have Canon...

3685
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:53,520
Guys, I also, like, don't really care.

3686
02:53:53,740 --> 02:53:57,420
There's Canon PIXMA TR4720.

3687
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,140
There's Canon PIXMA...

3688
02:54:01,140 --> 02:54:01,880
Wait, is this wireless?

3689
02:54:02,700 --> 02:54:03,700
They have a fax machine?

3690
02:54:03,800 --> 02:54:05,060
Who the fuck faxes?

3691
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:12,060
At the Brother MFCJ1012...

3692
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:16,220
DW Wireless Color Inkjet All-in-One Printer...

3693
02:54:16,220 --> 02:54:17,860
With mobile device and dupe.

3694
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:19,160
Oh, I like duplex.

3695
02:54:19,640 --> 02:54:20,600
Wait, is Brother good?

3696
02:54:21,380 --> 02:54:22,540
Get a Brother printer?

3697
02:54:23,340 --> 02:54:24,720
Alright, Espon or Brother?

3698
02:54:25,300 --> 02:54:29,180
Guys, Espon ET280...

3699
02:54:29,180 --> 02:54:30,140
Wait, is it...

3700
02:54:30,140 --> 02:54:30,840
Okay, Espon.

3701
02:54:30,940 --> 02:54:32,380
Is there an Espon in here?

3702
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:33,760
There's so many Brothers here.

3703
02:54:36,020 --> 02:54:36,460
Espon...

3704
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:38,980
Espon Workforce WF...

3705
02:54:38,980 --> 02:54:39,240
Okay.

3706
02:54:40,580 --> 02:54:41,460
Don't inkjet?

3707
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:43,100
Wait, what kind of ink should I get?

3708
02:54:45,940 --> 02:54:46,820
Brother laser.

3709
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:48,180
Wait, is laser better?

3710
02:54:48,280 --> 02:54:49,020
What about for color?

3711
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:51,580
Is Brother okay for color?

3712
02:54:52,360 --> 02:54:53,500
Like, laser color?

3713
02:54:55,240 --> 02:54:56,980
Okay, but what if I want to print in color?

3714
02:54:57,420 --> 02:54:57,840
Guys?

3715
02:54:58,100 --> 02:54:58,540
What...

3716
02:54:59,640 --> 02:55:01,540
Guys, but I want to print in color too!

3717
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:02,260
Wait, what do I...

3718
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:04,020
Yeah, what do I want to print in color?

3719
02:55:04,620 --> 02:55:05,140
Do you need...

3720
02:55:05,140 --> 02:55:07,580
I don't know, but like, I like the possibility that...

3721
02:55:07,580 --> 02:55:10,120
Like, I like the fact that I have options.

3722
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:11,380
Like...

3723
02:55:12,140 --> 02:55:13,340
Like, what if...

3724
02:55:13,340 --> 02:55:15,920
What if it's like a life or death situation?

3725
02:55:16,300 --> 02:55:19,540
And like, I'm put in a situation where you gotta print...

3726
02:55:19,540 --> 02:55:21,240
You're like, alright, Doki.

3727
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:24,040
We need you to print this out in color.

3728
02:55:24,460 --> 02:55:24,900
Or...

3729
02:55:25,540 --> 02:55:26,380
You're gonna...

3730
02:55:26,380 --> 02:55:28,340
Or like, somebody's gonna get it.

3731
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:30,440
And I'm like, oh, but I only have a laser printer.

3732
02:55:35,140 --> 02:55:35,780
Wait.

3733
02:55:37,260 --> 02:55:38,620
You know, what if...

3734
02:55:38,620 --> 02:55:40,460
What if that becomes an option?

3735
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:45,040
Like, there's a one percent chance that it can happen and like...

3736
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:48,840
You know, I don't wanna be put in that one percent chance.

3737
02:55:54,320 --> 02:55:55,820
She has a point.

3738
02:55:55,860 --> 02:55:56,180
Yeah!

3739
02:55:56,540 --> 02:55:58,100
I do have a point!

3740
02:55:58,420 --> 02:56:01,280
It's that one percent of maybe it could happen.

3741
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:07,300
Um, bye bye.

3742
02:56:07,460 --> 02:56:09,300
Well, I guess it's bye bye then.

3743
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:13,680
Um, have I ever printed anything in color?

3744
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:15,840
That's such a good question.

3745
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:17,980
When did I ever need color printer?

3746
02:56:18,360 --> 02:56:20,380
When did I ever need a color printer for?

3747
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:24,440
I'm trying to think of like... I'm trying to be like...

3748
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:29,260
In what scenario, other than a life or death situation...

3749
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:31,960
That I used a color printer.

3750
02:56:32,180 --> 02:56:33,780
What if I'm creating something?

3751
02:56:34,380 --> 02:56:38,180
What if... What if I'm trying to print out fan art?

3752
02:56:38,980 --> 02:56:39,540
Checkmate.

3753
02:56:39,940 --> 02:56:43,680
What if I'm trying to print out fan art and like...

3754
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:46,280
I'm trying to make like a collage or something.

3755
02:56:46,400 --> 02:56:47,800
Yeah, room decoration.

3756
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:48,760
Exactly.

3757
02:56:49,540 --> 02:56:53,760
What if I'm trying to print out some nice fan art of me?

3758
02:56:54,240 --> 02:56:55,260
And that's our gotchu.

02:56:56,680 --> 02:56:57,700
Okay, color printer.

3761
02:56:58,040 --> 02:56:58,700
Okay, true.

3762
02:56:59,880 --> 02:57:00,520
Alright.

3763
02:57:01,700 --> 02:57:04,740
You will legally print pirating.

3764
02:57:05,100 --> 02:57:06,460
You won't download a car.

3765
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:07,220
Alright.

3766
02:57:08,060 --> 02:57:09,980
You suggest me a color printer.

3767
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:13,780
Just go to the... What if it's a lot?

3768
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:18,700
What if... What if I want to print out 40 fan art pieces?

3769
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:21,360
Like, I'm not gonna go to the fucking store.

3770
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:27,100
Guys, give me like the name.

3771
02:57:27,140 --> 02:57:28,360
I need the name.

3772
02:57:28,700 --> 02:57:29,580
Guys.

3773
02:57:30,240 --> 02:57:32,880
Espon, Ecotank... See, look.

3774
02:57:33,360 --> 02:57:34,940
Victor knows what's up.

3775
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:36,880
Guys, I expect this from a member goon.

3776
02:57:40,960 --> 02:57:42,220
I'm joking.

3777
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:47,820
I'm joking.

3778
02:57:54,520 --> 02:57:56,140
Members are pretending.

3779
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:00,020
Okay.

3780
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:05,300
I mean, no guy has ever printed out a Lamborghini.

3781
02:58:06,220 --> 02:58:07,740
Thank you for the super chat.

3782
02:58:07,940 --> 02:58:08,560
Thank you, thank you.

3783
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:09,760
There you go.

3784
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:11,980
Espon, Expression, Expia.

3785
02:58:12,320 --> 02:58:13,940
Guys, this is like an actual commitment.

3786
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:14,960
I need like...

3787
02:58:16,620 --> 02:58:17,660
I don't know.

3788
02:58:17,740 --> 02:58:18,920
I need printer numbers.

3789
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:21,420
Like, you got to say Espion, brother.

3790
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:23,180
Like, I need a printer number.

3791
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:24,700
I need to know.

3792
02:58:25,100 --> 02:58:25,540
Where are they?

3793
02:58:27,340 --> 02:58:27,760
329.

3794
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:31,120
Okay, this better be a fucking good-ass printer.

3795
02:58:32,820 --> 02:58:35,900
Espon, Ecotank, ET2800.

3796
02:58:36,040 --> 02:58:36,820
Is there a scanner?

3797
02:58:37,020 --> 02:58:38,300
The ideal home printer?

3798
02:58:39,020 --> 02:58:39,400
All right.

3799
02:58:42,280 --> 02:58:43,160
Espon, okay.

3800
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:45,700
Oh, Epson.

3801
02:58:45,940 --> 02:58:46,660
Sorry, Epson.

3802
02:58:47,180 --> 02:58:48,000
Sorry, I can't...

3803
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:48,780
I can't fucking...

3804
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:50,420
Just 300.

3805
02:58:51,820 --> 02:58:53,100
All right.

3806
02:58:54,080 --> 02:58:54,720
Brother.

3807
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:56,020
HL.

3808
02:58:56,620 --> 02:58:57,120
Okay.

3809
02:58:57,120 --> 02:58:58,120
All right, guys.

3810
02:58:58,300 --> 02:58:59,360
Here are...

3811
02:58:59,360 --> 02:58:59,840
Oh, my God.

3812
02:58:59,880 --> 02:59:01,200
There's so many different...

3813
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:02,380
You need a good printer.

3814
02:59:02,500 --> 02:59:02,720
Okay.

3815
02:59:03,360 --> 02:59:04,860
Get a brother and print color.

3816
02:59:05,020 --> 02:59:05,920
I thought I got print color.

3817
02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:09,200
That means I got to travel to the shop.

3818
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:12,480
Why travel to the shop when I can literally just do it at home?

3819
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:16,240
Okay.

3820
02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:16,640
Oh, yeah.

3821
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:17,680
We need duplex, too.

3822
02:59:17,780 --> 02:59:18,740
We need duplex printing.

3823
02:59:19,500 --> 02:59:19,920
All right.

3824
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:24,080
Brother, Investment Tank, MFC.

3825
02:59:24,880 --> 02:59:25,560
Is that the one?

3826
02:59:25,720 --> 02:59:26,180
All right.

3827
02:59:26,180 --> 02:59:29,900
Brother, Investment Tank, MFC.

3828
02:59:30,680 --> 02:59:33,480
All-in-one color inkjet printer.

3829
02:59:33,820 --> 02:59:36,380
Up to one year of ink in box.

3830
02:59:36,580 --> 02:59:36,860
Jeez.

3831
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:37,620
Is there wireless?

3832
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:38,720
Wireless.

3833
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:39,880
Is there duplex?

3834
02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:41,400
I need to know if there's duplex.

3835
02:59:42,020 --> 02:59:42,440
All right.

3836
02:59:44,760 --> 02:59:48,880
Well, actually, my old printer was a color printer, and I liked it.

3837
02:59:49,640 --> 02:59:52,300
I don't think I've ever had a non-color printer.

3838
02:59:52,860 --> 02:59:53,840
I don't think so.

3839
02:59:54,660 --> 02:59:55,740
Gray printer.

3840
02:59:56,020 --> 02:59:57,160
One last tank.

3841
02:59:57,460 --> 02:59:57,900
One tank.

3842
02:59:58,040 --> 02:59:58,160
Okay.

3843
02:59:58,240 --> 02:59:59,240
Epson EcoTank.

3844
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:00,800
Okay, but does it print in color?

3845
03:00:01,320 --> 03:00:05,700
Brother, MFC L3.

3846
03:00:06,320 --> 03:00:07,760
Please no inkjet.

3847
03:00:07,860 --> 03:00:11,580
Wait, is laser color printer better than inkjet color printer?

3848
03:00:14,340 --> 03:00:16,040
Call ink or laser.

3849
03:00:16,180 --> 03:00:16,460
All right.

3850
03:00:16,520 --> 03:00:17,180
First off.

3851
03:00:17,600 --> 03:00:18,060
All right.

3852
03:00:18,580 --> 03:00:20,420
Holy shit, guys.

3853
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:22,780
That's a big-ass fucking printer.

3854
03:00:23,440 --> 03:00:24,800
What's the difference between these two?

3855
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:29,120
$449?!

3856
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:30,820
Wait, am I looking at the same- No, I'm looking at the wrong printer.

3857
03:00:30,920 --> 03:00:31,460
They don't have it.

3858
03:00:31,800 --> 03:00:32,300
Sorry, guys.

3859
03:00:32,300 --> 03:00:34,040
Sorry, they don't have it on fucking Amazon.

3860
03:00:35,260 --> 03:00:35,580
Like...

3861
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:37,420
Oh, thank God.

3862
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:41,360
Thank fucking God they don't have it on Amazon.

3863
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:48,600
You save on ink?

3864
03:00:48,700 --> 03:00:51,200
Guys, it's gonna take me so long to use up all the ink, guys.

3865
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:54,840
All right.

3866
03:00:55,160 --> 03:00:55,660
Okay.

3867
03:00:56,040 --> 03:00:57,960
Bro, the goal from nothing came.

3868
03:00:58,220 --> 03:01:01,880
Guys, this is basically what- You get nothing, I get a printer.

3869
03:01:05,420 --> 03:01:07,340
Hey, it worked out!

3870
03:01:07,700 --> 03:01:08,580
It worked out.

3871
03:01:08,680 --> 03:01:09,300
I get a printer.

3872
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:16,120
That's what the goal was.

3873
03:01:16,320 --> 03:01:17,180
It just works.

3874
03:01:17,400 --> 03:01:18,820
It actually worked.

3875
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:20,640
Sweet.

3876
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:21,980
Sweet deal.

3877
03:01:22,140 --> 03:01:23,280
What a deal, guys.

3878
03:01:24,940 --> 03:01:27,000
All right, what are the choices again?

3879
03:01:27,060 --> 03:01:27,760
We'll make a poll.

3880
03:01:31,060 --> 03:01:32,060
We'll make a poll.

3881
03:01:32,220 --> 03:01:33,160
One of them was...

3882
03:01:33,160 --> 03:01:33,640
What was it?

3883
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:35,340
Brother Ink Vestment.

3884
03:01:35,460 --> 03:01:36,820
Okay, this is one of them.

3885
03:01:38,120 --> 03:01:38,600
All right.

3886
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:39,720
So, okay.

3887
03:01:39,760 --> 03:01:40,380
We'll have one.

3888
03:01:40,420 --> 03:01:40,760
All right.

3889
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:42,600
We have one from which printer?

3890
03:01:42,900 --> 03:01:43,340
All right.

3891
03:01:45,140 --> 03:01:46,020
Choose your...

3892
03:01:46,020 --> 03:01:46,320
All right.

3893
03:01:46,380 --> 03:01:47,720
Which is the best Epson?

3894
03:01:48,460 --> 03:01:48,900
Guys.

3895
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:49,480
Epson.

3896
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:49,960
Oh, sorry.

3897
03:01:50,020 --> 03:01:50,240
Epson.

3898
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:51,800
Guys, we'll make them fight.

3899
03:01:51,800 --> 03:01:52,700
Epson Vs.

3900
03:01:52,760 --> 03:01:53,100
Brother.

3901
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,040
Epson Eco Tank.

3902
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:56,400
ET2.

3903
03:01:56,520 --> 03:01:58,020
Okay, we're going to make these printers fight.

3904
03:01:59,500 --> 03:02:01,060
Select your representative!

3905
03:02:01,900 --> 03:02:02,300
Guys.

3906
03:02:02,540 --> 03:02:04,240
I need you guys to select your representative.

3907
03:02:05,620 --> 03:02:05,960
All right.

3908
03:02:06,160 --> 03:02:07,720
Oh, we can't get that Epson, guys.

3909
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:09,280
Because...

3910
03:02:09,280 --> 03:02:10,800
The only one I can get was 2800.

3911
03:02:14,980 --> 03:02:15,900
Choose your fighter.

3912
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:16,720
Choose your printer.

3913
03:02:20,560 --> 03:02:21,180
All right.

3914
03:02:21,800 --> 03:02:22,180
Come on.

3915
03:02:22,260 --> 03:02:22,940
Give me an Epson.

3916
03:02:23,460 --> 03:02:23,940
Guys.

3917
03:02:24,300 --> 03:02:25,700
I need an Epson representative.

3918
03:02:26,380 --> 03:02:28,400
I don't have the one that people were saying.

3919
03:02:28,520 --> 03:02:29,900
I got the 2800.

3920
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:31,160
Is 2800 okay?

3921
03:02:31,660 --> 03:02:33,720
I don't have a representative.

3922
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:36,560
All right.

3923
03:02:37,020 --> 03:02:38,600
This is the other representative.

3924
03:02:39,160 --> 03:02:42,640
The Epson Eco Tank 2800 color.

3925
03:02:43,480 --> 03:02:44,400
Only one cartridge.

3926
03:02:45,460 --> 03:02:47,460
He actually cares what type of printer it is.

3927
03:02:47,540 --> 03:02:48,420
If it prints, it prints.

3928
03:02:48,420 --> 03:02:52,320
What a colossal waste of everyone's time.

3929
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:54,620
Thank you for the super chat.

3930
03:02:54,980 --> 03:02:55,180
Thank you.

3931
03:02:55,420 --> 03:02:55,940
Thank you.

3932
03:02:56,460 --> 03:02:58,060
It's not true.

3933
03:02:58,540 --> 03:02:59,760
It's not true.

3934
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:01,480
Printers for life.

3935
03:03:01,680 --> 03:03:03,260
If you get a good printer...

3936
03:03:03,260 --> 03:03:06,440
If you get a good printer, you never have to buy another printer.

3937
03:03:07,020 --> 03:03:07,400
Okay?

3938
03:03:07,820 --> 03:03:09,440
That's basically it.

3939
03:03:11,140 --> 03:03:14,760
You never have to get another printer for life.

3940
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:22,700
Someone who has never bought a trash tier printer in their life.

3941
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:24,380
We need it.

3942
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:26,320
Yeah, we need a good printer.

3943
03:03:26,440 --> 03:03:28,180
We don't want to have bad printers.

3944
03:03:28,300 --> 03:03:29,900
Or we got to get another printer.

3945
03:03:31,640 --> 03:03:33,440
Printers never last.

3946
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:35,060
Wait, how come I can't...

3947
03:03:35,060 --> 03:03:36,320
Oh, is it because there's too many?

3948
03:03:36,800 --> 03:03:37,160
Okay.

3949
03:03:37,720 --> 03:03:38,080
Brother.

3950
03:03:38,520 --> 03:03:38,820
Jay.

3951
03:03:38,980 --> 03:03:39,560
Okay, here we go.

3952
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:40,780
And then Eco Tank.

3953
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:41,800
ET.

3954
03:03:42,220 --> 03:03:42,940
Okay, here we go.

3955
03:03:43,020 --> 03:03:43,460
You guys fight.

3956
03:03:43,540 --> 03:03:45,200
I need to use the bathroom while you guys fight it out.

3957
03:03:45,260 --> 03:03:45,740
I'll be right back.

3958
03:04:51,780 --> 03:04:53,220
Alright, I'm back.

3959
03:04:53,380 --> 03:04:54,700
I can't believe we're having a printer fight.

3960
03:04:54,760 --> 03:04:56,520
This is when we know we're getting older.

3961
03:04:59,060 --> 03:05:02,820
This is when we know we're getting older.

3962
03:05:03,060 --> 03:05:04,000
We're fighting over...

3963
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:05,720
We're fucking talking about printers.

3964
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:10,520
And to me, we're fighting about what printer is a good printer.

3965
03:05:14,360 --> 03:05:17,400
It's like when the older you get, you're like, oh yay, clothes.

3966
03:05:17,400 --> 03:05:17,780
It's like...

3967
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:21,720
Don't say that.

3968
03:05:22,620 --> 03:05:25,500
I stumbled into the retirement home.

3969
03:05:25,900 --> 03:05:28,600
It's like, oh yes, my home.

3970
03:05:28,720 --> 03:05:33,400
I use the Brother MFC J4335DW.

3971
03:05:34,280 --> 03:05:36,200
It's a great printer for my office work.

3972
03:05:38,380 --> 03:05:40,600
I remember the Epson one.

3973
03:05:40,660 --> 03:05:42,400
It's so slow at doing things.

3974
03:05:42,480 --> 03:05:43,400
God, it like...

3975
03:05:43,400 --> 03:05:44,400
It like...

3976
03:05:46,300 --> 03:05:50,000
It was such a pain at the workplace, you know.

3977
03:05:50,400 --> 03:05:54,440
It was...

3978
03:05:55,840 --> 03:05:56,480
Alright.

3979
03:05:57,580 --> 03:05:58,880
Stating facts here.

3980
03:05:58,940 --> 03:06:00,320
No, don't use HP.

3981
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:04,120
That shit fucking sucked at my office.

3982
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:05,040
Alright.

3983
03:06:08,460 --> 03:06:09,100
Alright.

3984
03:06:10,780 --> 03:06:12,580
It's Bluetooth which is so iffy.

3985
03:06:13,480 --> 03:06:14,040
Okay.

3986
03:06:14,200 --> 03:06:16,180
Let me check the Brother one if it does.

3987
03:06:16,240 --> 03:06:17,200
Does it does duplex?

3988
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:18,180
What does it say?

3989
03:06:18,220 --> 03:06:18,640
Duplex.

3990
03:06:18,920 --> 03:06:19,220
Okay.

3991
03:06:20,320 --> 03:06:21,480
Duplex two-sided.

3992
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:22,860
Wait, does it not?

3993
03:06:24,220 --> 03:06:24,780
J43...

3994
03:06:24,780 --> 03:06:25,460
Okay, nice.

3995
03:06:25,560 --> 03:06:25,860
It does.

3996
03:06:25,940 --> 03:06:26,940
Okay, it has duplex.

3997
03:06:27,160 --> 03:06:27,720
Oh my God.

3998
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:28,220
Let me...

3999
03:06:28,220 --> 03:06:28,480
Okay.

4000
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:31,540
Let me tell you guys something really sexy.

4001
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:39,060
Not only is it a duplex printer, it can hold 150 sheets.

4002
03:06:39,060 --> 03:06:45,120
It has an auto document feeder and has a 1.8 color display.

4003
03:06:49,940 --> 03:07:03,940
Not only that, but the print resolution for the Brother MSC J4335DW has up to 4,800 x 1,200 DPI.

4004
03:07:05,140 --> 03:07:07,980
You had my attention.

4005
03:07:08,540 --> 03:07:08,900
Damn.

4006
03:07:10,700 --> 03:07:13,140
That's a good printer right there.

4007
03:07:13,640 --> 03:07:14,460
Oh yeah.

4008
03:07:14,760 --> 03:07:16,240
Top printer to me.

4009
03:07:21,040 --> 03:07:23,380
Skip ASMR ad.

4010
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:24,340
Bye.

4011
03:07:24,520 --> 03:07:25,080
Oh my God.

4012
03:07:25,180 --> 03:07:25,920
That DPI.

4013
03:07:26,300 --> 03:07:27,060
Holy shit.

4014
03:07:27,140 --> 03:07:28,540
That DPI is so big.

4015
03:07:28,660 --> 03:07:29,060
Whoa.

4016
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:33,320
Get the Brother.

4017
03:07:33,320 --> 03:07:37,180
I like how it actually got more votes now because of it.

4018
03:07:37,240 --> 03:07:38,720
All right.

4019
03:07:39,640 --> 03:07:40,980
Krio, thank you for the super chat.

4020
03:07:41,080 --> 03:07:41,300
Thank you.

4021
03:07:41,420 --> 03:07:41,720
Thank you.

4022
03:07:41,940 --> 03:07:44,920
Brother printers are made from space-age technology called Steela.

4023
03:07:45,180 --> 03:07:46,520
The bastard would not break.

4024
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:47,160
I'm sure of it.

4025
03:07:47,460 --> 03:07:48,440
Holy shit.

4026
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:50,520
Thank you for the super chat.

4027
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:51,160
Thank you.

4028
03:07:51,340 --> 03:07:51,880
Thank you.

4029
03:07:52,120 --> 03:07:52,380
All right.

4030
03:07:52,400 --> 03:07:53,020
We'll get the Brother.

4031
03:07:53,100 --> 03:07:54,200
The Brother printer one.

4032
03:07:54,640 --> 03:07:55,060
All right.

4033
03:07:56,040 --> 03:07:56,360
All right.

4034
03:07:56,460 --> 03:07:57,360
Now I need to buy a kettle.

4035
03:07:57,760 --> 03:07:58,160
Okay.

4036
03:07:58,260 --> 03:08:00,340
I don't need you guys to tell me what kettle to buy.

4037
03:08:00,420 --> 03:08:01,620
I just need a kettle.

4038
03:08:01,720 --> 03:08:02,240
I don't care.

4039
03:08:06,580 --> 03:08:07,580
All right.

4040
03:08:07,580 --> 03:08:08,200
Let's see.

4041
03:08:11,800 --> 03:08:14,480
Make sure this is an actual good kettle, though.

4042
03:08:14,580 --> 03:08:15,540
How do I...

4043
03:08:15,540 --> 03:08:15,840
All right.

4044
03:08:15,940 --> 03:08:17,400
No plastic contact.

4045
03:08:18,200 --> 03:08:19,760
How do I fucking heat it up?

4046
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:24,200
Brothers, we won!

4047
03:08:24,380 --> 03:08:24,620
Brothers!

4048
03:08:25,920 --> 03:08:26,680
All right.

4049
03:08:27,060 --> 03:08:27,840
Let's see.

4050
03:08:28,140 --> 03:08:28,960
How do we know that's...

4051
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:32,220
It has 52,000 reviews on it, so it must be good.

4052
03:08:32,220 --> 03:08:34,040
I don't care.

4053
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:34,760
It's just a kettle.

4054
03:08:34,960 --> 03:08:35,500
It's fine.

4055
03:08:37,140 --> 03:08:38,560
It boils water.

4056
03:08:38,720 --> 03:08:39,680
That's all we need.

4057
03:08:39,800 --> 03:08:39,980
Okay.

4058
03:08:40,520 --> 03:08:40,940
All right.

4059
03:08:41,100 --> 03:08:42,240
3k people bought this.

4060
03:08:42,740 --> 03:08:43,060
All right.

4061
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:43,820
Let's...

4062
03:08:43,820 --> 03:08:44,220
Henya?

4063
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:45,220
Henya kettle?

4064
03:08:45,980 --> 03:08:46,960
Is that a thing?

4065
03:08:47,020 --> 03:08:48,580
Is that an actual...

4066
03:08:49,580 --> 03:08:51,700
Is that an actual fucking...

4067
03:08:51,700 --> 03:08:52,380
Oh, no.

4068
03:08:52,600 --> 03:08:53,500
It's the VTuber.

4069
03:08:53,620 --> 03:08:54,480
I thought you were talking...

4070
03:08:54,480 --> 03:08:55,120
Oh, my God.

4071
03:08:55,140 --> 03:08:57,580
I thought you were talking about the fucking kettle, Brian.

4072
03:08:58,120 --> 03:08:58,540
I just...

4073
03:08:58,540 --> 03:09:01,960
I was like...

4074
03:09:01,960 --> 03:09:02,200
I don't know.

4075
03:09:02,200 --> 03:09:05,940
I didn't know they have a kettle named after it, too.

4076
03:09:06,220 --> 03:09:06,700
Like...

4077
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:09,860
I thought you were...

4078
03:09:09,860 --> 03:09:12,000
Look, I'm locked in.

4079
03:09:12,160 --> 03:09:14,800
I'm so locked in over my fucking kettle.

4080
03:09:15,620 --> 03:09:17,880
I'm telling kettle specs to me.

4081
03:09:18,100 --> 03:09:18,380
Okay.

4082
03:09:18,540 --> 03:09:19,700
Thank you for the super chat.

4083
03:09:20,180 --> 03:09:21,100
Papa, thank you.

4084
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:21,580
Thank you.

4085
03:09:21,640 --> 03:09:22,860
Felian, thank you for the super chat.

4086
03:09:22,940 --> 03:09:23,200
Thank you.

4087
03:09:23,240 --> 03:09:23,900
Thank you.

4088
03:09:25,660 --> 03:09:29,260
ASMR stream where you just read the five specs for an hour.

4089
03:09:29,780 --> 03:09:31,300
Thank you for the super chat.

4090
03:09:31,400 --> 03:09:31,800
Thank you.

4091
03:09:31,920 --> 03:09:32,180
Thank you.

4092
03:09:32,800 --> 03:09:33,360
Alright.

4093
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:36,240
I'll get the Kosori electric kettle.

4094
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,260
I mean, that looks like a good kettle, right?

4095
03:09:39,580 --> 03:09:41,260
I mean, it just boils it, right?

4096
03:09:41,360 --> 03:09:41,620
Okay.

4097
03:09:42,080 --> 03:09:43,520
No plastic contact.

4098
03:09:43,840 --> 03:09:44,720
How do I...

4099
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:46,840
How do I charge this kettle?

4100
03:09:47,980 --> 03:09:48,540
Like...

4101
03:09:48,540 --> 03:09:49,260
What...

4102
03:09:49,260 --> 03:09:50,440
Where does it...

4103
03:09:50,860 --> 03:09:52,780
How do I charge it?

4104
03:09:54,180 --> 03:09:55,840
Does it have a charger?

4105
03:09:56,660 --> 03:09:58,920
Oh, you just press the thing.

4106
03:09:59,000 --> 03:09:59,920
I don't like that.

4107
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:00,120
Wait.

4108
03:10:00,140 --> 03:10:01,140
Is it not...

4109
03:10:01,140 --> 03:10:03,240
Is it corded?

4110
03:10:03,300 --> 03:10:04,020
Is it wireless?

4111
03:10:06,540 --> 03:10:08,160
Is it solar energy?

4112
03:10:08,600 --> 03:10:09,220
Is there an outlet?

4113
03:10:09,340 --> 03:10:09,940
There's no...

4114
03:10:09,940 --> 03:10:11,040
Is there a wall outlet?

4115
03:10:11,240 --> 03:10:11,520
Okay.

4116
03:10:12,420 --> 03:10:13,220
I don't know.

4117
03:10:13,320 --> 03:10:14,360
It doesn't say.

4118
03:10:16,120 --> 03:10:17,980
You just press the button.

4119
03:10:19,100 --> 03:10:20,980
What if I don't want it to be 100?

4120
03:10:23,640 --> 03:10:27,500
Yeah, no kettle is wireless, but it doesn't say.

4121
03:10:28,900 --> 03:10:31,120
It doesn't say, like...

4122
03:10:31,120 --> 03:10:31,820
How you...

4123
03:10:33,320 --> 03:10:34,520
Where's the plug?

4124
03:10:35,740 --> 03:10:37,100
Show us the...

4125
03:10:37,100 --> 03:10:37,740
It's the...

4126
03:10:38,300 --> 03:10:40,120
Kasori electric kettle.

4127
03:10:40,700 --> 03:10:41,780
It's like, how do I...

4128
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:43,280
I'm gonna re-watch this.

4129
03:10:48,590 --> 03:10:50,070
I'm watching the video.

4130
03:10:52,170 --> 03:10:53,210
Oh my god.

4131
03:10:53,250 --> 03:10:54,730
It's made by high quality...

4132
03:10:54,730 --> 03:10:56,410
Where's the plug?!

4133
03:10:57,570 --> 03:10:59,590
It doesn't say where the plug...

4134
03:10:59,590 --> 03:11:00,170
Plug it...

4135
03:11:00,170 --> 03:11:04,590
It doesn't even have, like...

4136
03:11:05,170 --> 03:11:06,810
Where's the outlet?

4137
03:11:08,010 --> 03:11:10,210
More stylish, the purest, no more waste.

4138
03:11:10,250 --> 03:11:11,730
It doesn't even say anywhere.

4139
03:11:12,170 --> 03:11:13,810
Can I plug it anywhere?

4140
03:11:16,090 --> 03:11:19,010
Have you ever used an electric kettle before?

4141
03:11:19,690 --> 03:11:20,970
Yeah, but there's a plug.

4142
03:11:22,910 --> 03:11:24,850
Am I stupid?

4143
03:11:26,010 --> 03:11:27,650
God, I feel so stupid.

4144
03:11:29,850 --> 03:11:31,210
Oh, shut off.

4145
03:11:31,250 --> 03:11:35,250
Oh, it's the base!

4146
03:11:35,430 --> 03:11:37,550
Okay, we're buying this.

4147
03:11:38,170 --> 03:11:39,330
Alright, I don't care.

4148
03:11:39,630 --> 03:11:41,170
It has 52,000 people.

4149
03:11:41,710 --> 03:11:43,330
I don't need a fancy kettle.

4150
03:11:43,670 --> 03:11:44,890
I don't need a fancy kettle.

4151
03:11:45,030 --> 03:11:46,210
I just need a kettle.

4152
03:11:46,730 --> 03:11:48,690
I just need a kettle.

4153
03:11:48,790 --> 03:11:49,970
I don't need anything fancy.

4154
03:11:52,150 --> 03:11:53,030
Okay, good.

4155
03:11:53,150 --> 03:11:53,990
Okay, tomorrow.

4156
03:11:54,290 --> 03:11:54,690
Nice.

4157
03:11:55,650 --> 03:11:56,050
Alright.

4158
03:11:56,910 --> 03:11:58,650
Let me make sure...

4159
03:11:58,650 --> 03:12:00,330
Alright, what's my payment method?

4160
03:12:00,450 --> 03:12:02,010
I need to make sure I'm using the right card.

4161
03:12:02,090 --> 03:12:02,810
Okay, I am.

4162
03:12:02,870 --> 03:12:03,610
Okay, nice.

4163
03:12:04,170 --> 03:12:04,550
Alright!

4164
03:12:05,450 --> 03:12:06,810
I'm placing my order.

4165
03:12:07,830 --> 03:12:09,050
Guys, I'm so excited.

4166
03:12:09,270 --> 03:12:11,390
Downstairs, I'm gonna be able to have my...

4167
03:12:11,390 --> 03:12:12,850
I have my trash can downstairs.

4168
03:12:13,130 --> 03:12:15,050
Guys, I'm gonna have an actual trash can.

4169
03:12:19,530 --> 03:12:19,970
Yay!

4170
03:12:20,990 --> 03:12:21,430
Nothing!

4171
03:12:24,230 --> 03:12:25,650
We did it, guys!

4172
03:12:25,830 --> 03:12:28,010
We bought stuff for my apartment.

4173
03:12:28,010 --> 03:12:29,170
We did it.

4174
03:12:29,230 --> 03:12:30,070
We bought things.

4175
03:12:30,330 --> 03:12:32,750
We finally became an adult, guys.

4176
03:12:33,710 --> 03:12:36,750
Alright, let me look at my...

4177
03:12:36,750 --> 03:12:39,130

03:12:39,130 --> 03:12:40,490

To-do lists.

4180
03:12:43,270 --> 03:12:46,810
Let me look at my to-do list of stuff we have.

Oh, yeah!

03:12:50,130 --> 03:12:51,670
I won't show you guys this.

4184
03:12:52,850 --> 03:12:53,350
But...

4185
03:12:53,880 --> 03:12:54,610
Let me show you guys.

4186
03:12:54,670 --> 03:12:56,450
I haven't shown you guys these before.

4187
03:12:56,450 --> 03:12:58,450
But it's basically the...

4188
03:12:59,550 --> 03:12:59,990
Wait.

4189
03:13:01,010 --> 03:13:01,730
Where is this?

4190
03:13:01,850 --> 03:13:03,450
It's basically the postcards...

4191
03:13:04,430 --> 03:13:05,710

4192
03:13:05,970 --> 03:13:07,450
So, I'll be shipping them...

4193
03:13:08,010 --> 03:13:09,730
We'll be shipping the charity postcards.

4194
03:13:09,730 --> 03:13:11,330
The charity postcards haven't been shipped yet.

4195
03:13:11,430 --> 03:13:14,150
But they'll be shipped out next week.

4196
03:13:16,150 --> 03:13:18,830
And so like, we have a lot of stuff to ship out.

4197
03:13:18,910 --> 03:13:19,730
Oh my god, where did it go?

4198
03:13:20,270 --> 03:13:21,450
I was about to show you the...

4199
03:13:22,170 --> 03:13:23,550
Wait, where did the freaking image go?

4200
03:13:23,550 --> 03:13:24,250
Wait.

4201
03:13:24,890 --> 03:13:26,790
Where did the image go?

4202
03:13:27,230 --> 03:13:27,830
Okay, wait.

4203
03:13:28,250 --> 03:13:28,710

Okay.

4206
03:13:32,390 --> 03:13:33,410
Wait, where did it go again?

4207
03:13:33,770 --> 03:13:34,890
God damn it!

4208
03:13:35,170 --> 03:13:37,930
I keep accidentally like, fucking...

4209
03:13:37,930 --> 03:13:40,850
I keep accidentally moving it somewhere else.

4210
03:13:40,850 --> 03:13:42,330
Because it's such a big image.

4211
03:13:43,290 --> 03:13:47,930
Okay, I'll show you the charity and the Lunar New Year postcards.

4212
03:13:48,590 --> 03:13:51,810
Lunar New Year postcards will be shipped out soon-ish.

03:13:52,710 --> 03:13:55,730
They're waiting for like, the remaining items to get...

4214
03:13:55,730 --> 03:13:57,130
To be received.

4215
03:13:57,390 --> 03:13:59,190
Because like, we were missing some items for the bundle.

4216
03:13:59,410 --> 03:14:01,370
So they're waiting for it to arrive.

4217
03:14:02,850 --> 03:14:03,330

03:14:07,610 --> 03:14:09,770
I'm making it small because like...

4221
03:14:09,770 --> 03:14:11,410

03:14:23,030 --> 03:14:25,010
This one is the...

4228
03:14:25,010 --> 03:14:27,970
This one is the Lunar New Year postcard.

4229
03:14:28,210 --> 03:14:28,770
Right here.

4230
03:14:28,890 --> 03:14:31,330
Guys, okay, I'm making it even smaller so you guys can't steal it.

4231
03:14:35,610 --> 03:14:36,990
Here it is.

4232
03:14:38,130 --> 03:14:39,170
Here's the...

4233

Here's the...

4234
03:14:40,210 --> 03:14:41,170
I'm gonna wiggle it too.

4235
03:14:41,450 --> 03:14:43,250
Wow, you can't steal this!

4236
03:14:43,250 --> 03:14:49,790
This one is the Lunar New Year postcard.

4237
03:14:49,930 --> 03:14:54,030
And Doki and NFT be like, Yeah, but then these are signed.

03:14:57,390 --> 03:15:01,050
This is the Lunar New Year postcard for the Lunar New Year items.

4239
03:15:01,410 --> 03:15:02,450
I think that's all the...

4240
03:15:02,450 --> 03:15:04,830
I mean, we've already seen the thief one.

4241
03:15:05,310 --> 03:15:07,730
But yeah, that's an update regarding that.

4242
03:15:08,670 --> 03:15:09,430

Okay, okay, look at my...

It's been confirmed.

4252
03:15:30,910 --> 03:15:31,890
I will be streaming.

4253
03:15:32,350 --> 03:15:33,590
The reason why it says...

4254
03:15:33,590 --> 03:15:35,450
It didn't have a name was because it wasn't confirmed yet.

4255
03:15:35,610 --> 03:15:37,210
I didn't like, you know...

4256
03:15:37,210 --> 03:15:39,750
I didn't like finish signing anything for it.

4257
03:15:39,810 --> 03:15:41,950
But we just confirmed it today.

4258

On Friday.

4262
03:15:47,490 --> 03:15:48,290
Yes.

4263
03:15:48,730 --> 03:15:49,330
That game.

4264
03:15:58,710 --> 03:16:00,310
What game?

4265
03:16:00,670 --> 03:16:01,490
You know...

4266
03:16:01,490 --> 03:16:03,010

4267
03:16:04,510 --> 03:16:06,170

4268
03:16:07,230 --> 03:16:08,850

Like...

4271
03:16:15,030 --> 03:16:15,710
Yeah.

The goddess of victory.

4273
03:16:18,070 --> 03:16:18,310
Nike.

4274
03:16:19,310 --> 03:16:19,990

4275
03:16:19,990 --> 03:16:20,890

03:16:26,810 --> 03:16:28,630
Like the bullets and the...

4279
03:16:28,630 --> 03:16:30,450
The guns and the pew-pew.

4280
03:16:30,650 --> 03:16:30,950
Yeah.

4281
03:16:31,310 --> 03:16:32,130

03:16:34,010 --> 03:16:34,950
On Sunday.

4284
03:16:35,990 --> 03:16:37,510
I also got a sponsor on Sunday.

4285
03:16:38,190 --> 03:16:40,190
And it's gonna be Payday 3.

4286
03:16:40,190 --> 03:16:42,090
Payday 3 also reached out.

4287
03:16:42,630 --> 03:16:43,850
For me to...

4288
03:16:43,850 --> 03:16:45,250
For me to try...

4289
03:16:45,250 --> 03:16:46,110
Test out...

4290
03:16:46,110 --> 03:16:47,090
Try their new updates.

4291
03:16:47,250 --> 03:16:49,790
So on Sunday, it'll be a Payday 3 sponsor.

4292
03:16:50,410 --> 03:16:51,630
So I'm very excited.

4293
03:16:51,870 --> 03:16:53,890
They're both games that I really enjoy.

4294
03:16:55,330 --> 03:16:55,810
Yeah.

4295
03:16:56,030 --> 03:16:56,910
It's really cool.

4296
03:16:57,290 --> 03:17:02,790
I'm really happy to be reached out by a lot of different companies that I really enjoy.

4297
03:17:03,670 --> 03:17:04,630
To like...

4298
03:17:04,630 --> 03:17:06,410
You know, be paid by them to play their video games.

4299
03:17:06,410 --> 03:17:06,890
You know?

4300
03:17:09,790 --> 03:17:11,350
So it's really exciting.

4301
03:17:11,630 --> 03:17:12,930
I'm also taking a lot of sponsors.

4302
03:17:13,970 --> 03:17:14,570
Because...

4303
03:17:14,570 --> 03:17:16,550
I'm also taking a lot of sponsors.

4304
03:17:17,590 --> 03:17:18,190
Because...

4305
03:17:18,190 --> 03:17:20,490
Dance lessons are very expensive.

4306
03:17:21,070 --> 03:17:21,550
I'm...

4307
03:17:21,550 --> 03:17:22,170
Oh my god.

4308
03:17:22,230 --> 03:17:24,610
I swear, finding a dance...

4309
03:17:24,610 --> 03:17:26,710
Private dance classes...

4310
03:17:26,710 --> 03:17:28,650
Is so fucking hard.

4311
03:17:29,590 --> 03:17:31,830
Because they're all so expensive.

4312
03:17:31,990 --> 03:17:33,650
Like the lessons are very expensive.

4313
03:17:34,190 --> 03:17:35,350
And I don't have a car.

4314
03:17:35,350 --> 03:17:36,450
So I have to...

4315
03:17:36,450 --> 03:17:38,610
I have to take public transport or Uber.

4316
03:17:39,030 --> 03:17:39,950
And I was like...

4317
03:17:39,950 --> 03:17:41,790
Talking to one of the teachers.

4318
03:17:42,410 --> 03:17:42,990
And like...

4319
03:17:42,990 --> 03:17:43,530
I was like...

4320
03:17:43,530 --> 03:17:44,490
Oh, and they have this...

4321
03:17:44,490 --> 03:17:45,030
And they're like...

4322
03:17:45,030 --> 03:17:46,510
You know, it's super last minute too.

4323
03:17:46,570 --> 03:17:47,330
So they're like...

4324
03:17:47,330 --> 03:17:48,570
Oh yeah, like...

4325
03:17:48,570 --> 03:17:49,830
These are my hours.

4326
03:17:49,990 --> 03:17:50,710
And like...

4327
03:17:50,710 --> 03:17:51,930
This is a private lesson.

4328
03:17:52,170 --> 03:17:52,430
Like...

4329
03:17:52,430 --> 03:17:53,210
At first, I was like...

4330
03:17:53,210 --> 03:17:55,330
When finally a teacher responded back.

4331
03:17:55,410 --> 03:17:56,270
They're like, we can do it.

4332
03:17:56,550 --> 03:17:57,350
They're like...

4333
03:17:58,470 --> 03:17:59,590
You can just get a car.

4334
03:17:59,670 --> 03:18:00,870
I just don't trust myself driving.

4335
03:18:00,950 --> 03:18:01,830
Because I haven't touched a car.

4336
03:18:01,990 --> 03:18:03,350
I haven't drove a car in like...

4337
03:18:03,910 --> 03:18:05,130
Six plus years.

4338
03:18:05,370 --> 03:18:06,990
So I don't trust myself in driving.

4339
03:18:07,270 --> 03:18:08,190
So like...

4340
03:18:08,190 --> 03:18:09,490
And driving a car is like...

4341
03:18:09,490 --> 03:18:10,210
Scary for...

4342
03:18:10,210 --> 03:18:11,510
It's like scary when...

4343
03:18:12,110 --> 03:18:13,870
You haven't driven in a long time.

4344
03:18:14,530 --> 03:18:15,010
And...

4345
03:18:16,630 --> 03:18:17,110
So...

4346
03:18:17,110 --> 03:18:17,730
So like...

4347
03:18:17,730 --> 03:18:18,530
That's why...

4348
03:18:18,530 --> 03:18:19,490
So like...

4349
03:18:19,490 --> 03:18:20,350
The thing is...

4350
03:18:20,350 --> 03:18:21,450
When I found a teacher.

4351
03:18:21,690 --> 03:18:23,670
Like the teacher that finally responded to me.

4352
03:18:23,950 --> 03:18:24,610
And I was like...

4353
03:18:24,610 --> 03:18:26,230
Oh, it's just like a 30 minute...

4354
03:18:26,230 --> 03:18:27,250
Like public transport.

4355
03:18:27,410 --> 03:18:27,630
You know?

4356
03:18:27,670 --> 03:18:27,930
I was like...

4357
03:18:27,930 --> 03:18:29,650
Oh, I just need to do 30 minute public transport.

4358
03:18:30,070 --> 03:18:30,950
And they're like...

4359
03:18:30,950 --> 03:18:32,530
Oh, because it's a private lesson.

4360
03:18:32,530 --> 03:18:33,630
This is like my home.

4361
03:18:33,710 --> 03:18:35,110
We have it at my home.

4362
03:18:35,570 --> 03:18:35,850
Like...

4363
03:18:35,850 --> 03:18:36,370
I have a...

4364
03:18:36,370 --> 03:18:38,210
I have a personal dance studio at my home.

4365
03:18:38,290 --> 03:18:39,610
So you're gonna have to travel to my house.

4366
03:18:40,050 --> 03:18:41,170
And then I looked at it.

4367
03:18:41,250 --> 03:18:41,730
The address.

4368
03:18:42,090 --> 03:18:43,790
And it's literally in another city.

4369
03:18:45,130 --> 03:18:45,550
Like...

4370
03:18:46,730 --> 03:18:47,150
So...

4371
03:18:47,150 --> 03:18:48,110
So like...

4372
03:18:48,110 --> 03:18:49,950
It's like an hour...

4373
03:18:49,950 --> 03:18:51,010
Public transport.

4374
03:18:51,690 --> 03:18:52,530
To like...

4375
03:18:52,530 --> 03:18:53,890
This lady's house.

4376
03:18:54,110 --> 03:18:54,680
And I was like...

4377
03:18:55,650 --> 03:18:56,580
I was just like...

4378
03:18:57,610 --> 03:18:58,270
Wait a minute.

4379
03:19:00,390 --> 03:19:01,230
I was like...

4380
03:19:01,230 --> 03:19:01,510
Wait.

4381
03:19:01,750 --> 03:19:01,990
No.

4382
03:19:02,150 --> 03:19:03,010
This is...

4383
03:19:03,510 --> 03:19:04,790
And I'm like...

4384
03:19:04,790 --> 03:19:05,370
Oh, man.

4385
03:19:05,530 --> 03:19:06,930
But then if I take an Uber...

4386
03:19:06,930 --> 03:19:08,890
It's like a $30 Uber ride.

4387
03:19:09,530 --> 03:19:10,330
To get there.

4388
03:19:11,010 --> 03:19:12,030
So I was just like...

4389
03:19:12,030 --> 03:19:13,050
Oh, my God.

4390
03:19:13,470 --> 03:19:13,910
Yeah.

4391
03:19:13,970 --> 03:19:15,270
It's like literally the suburbs.

4392
03:19:15,490 --> 03:19:16,530
I was like...

4393
03:19:16,530 --> 03:19:17,190
Oh, my God.

4394
03:19:17,230 --> 03:19:18,190
Not only that...

4395
03:19:18,190 --> 03:19:19,530
By the way, the dance lessons...

4396
03:19:19,530 --> 03:19:23,430
Private dance lessons are like $150 per hour.

4397
03:19:24,030 --> 03:19:25,230
So I was like...

4398
03:19:25,850 --> 03:19:29,730
Oh, and then I have to pay like $60 to and back as well.

4399
03:19:29,970 --> 03:19:30,630
So I was like...

4400
03:19:30,630 --> 03:19:31,030
Okay.

4401
03:19:31,430 --> 03:19:32,090
If I...

4402
03:19:32,090 --> 03:19:35,490
I would do it if I could do public transport, you know?

4403
03:19:36,570 --> 03:19:38,410
I was like...

4404
03:19:38,410 --> 03:19:40,210
That's why I'm taking off sponsors too.

4405
03:19:40,310 --> 03:19:42,730
To pay off my dance lessons as well.

4406
03:19:42,810 --> 03:19:44,670
Because I want you guys to have a good time.

4407
03:19:46,090 --> 03:19:47,550
I do it for you guys.

4408
03:19:47,610 --> 03:19:49,970
I do it for you guys because I want you guys to have a great time watching.

4409
03:19:50,290 --> 03:19:51,630
I don't want to be like...

4410
03:19:52,230 --> 03:19:52,850
I don't know.

4411
03:19:52,950 --> 03:19:54,190
Frumpy when I'm dancing.

4412
03:19:54,410 --> 03:19:56,230
I don't know what to do with my hands and stuff.

4413
03:19:56,290 --> 03:19:58,610
So I have actual choreo and everything.

4414
03:19:58,870 --> 03:20:00,030
I'm learning actual choreo.

4415
03:20:00,030 --> 03:20:00,770
So that's why I'm like...

4416
03:20:00,770 --> 03:20:01,610
I don't mind.

4417
03:20:01,890 --> 03:20:03,070
Because I'm doing more sponsors too.

4418
03:20:03,150 --> 03:20:05,290
To pay off for the dance lessons and stuff.

4419
03:20:05,910 --> 03:20:06,230
And...

4420
03:20:06,230 --> 03:20:06,910
So like...

4421
03:20:06,910 --> 03:20:08,030
I was like...

4422
03:20:08,590 --> 03:20:09,750
Because they're actual choreo.

4423
03:20:09,830 --> 03:20:11,510
I have to do actual choreo and everything.

4424
03:20:12,170 --> 03:20:13,510
And then so like...

4425
03:20:13,510 --> 03:20:14,410
I was like...

4426
03:20:14,410 --> 03:20:15,050
Oh, fuck.

4427
03:20:16,330 --> 03:20:17,550
Let me find it.

4428
03:20:17,770 --> 03:20:18,390
So I was like...

4429
03:20:18,390 --> 03:20:19,390
And then I was like...

4430
03:20:19,390 --> 03:20:20,130
Oh, I...

4431
03:20:20,130 --> 03:20:21,670
I don't know, man.

4432
03:20:21,770 --> 03:20:22,670
Well, Min's a dancer.

4433
03:20:22,970 --> 03:20:23,570
So like...

4434
03:20:23,570 --> 03:20:25,750
It's easier for her to learn how to dance.

4435
03:20:26,130 --> 03:20:27,570
But for me, I actually need a teacher.

4436
03:20:27,870 --> 03:20:28,610
Because like...

4437
03:20:28,610 --> 03:20:29,530
I don't know what the fuck I'm...

4438
03:20:29,530 --> 03:20:29,950
Like I...

4439
03:20:29,950 --> 03:20:31,690
Like when I have a teacher, I obviously like...

4440
03:20:31,690 --> 03:20:32,490
It helps a lot.

4441
03:20:32,670 --> 03:20:35,090
Because if I try to dance myself, I don't know what I'm doing.

4442
03:20:35,250 --> 03:20:36,650
And I need the mirror as well.

4443
03:20:36,730 --> 03:20:38,990
Like you know when you're doing dances, you need the mirror and stuff.

4444
03:20:39,070 --> 03:20:40,030
So like...

4445
03:20:40,630 --> 03:20:41,610
So it's like...

4446
03:20:41,610 --> 03:20:42,810
Fucking I don't know what I'm doing.

4447
03:20:46,050 --> 03:20:46,410
So...

4448
03:20:46,410 --> 03:20:47,650
So I was like...

4449
03:20:47,650 --> 03:20:48,370
Oh, man.

4450
03:20:48,810 --> 03:20:49,170
Like...

4451
03:20:49,170 --> 03:20:50,330
This is hard.

4452
03:20:53,270 --> 03:20:53,630
And...

4453
03:20:53,630 --> 03:20:55,550
And then they were like...

4454
03:20:55,550 --> 03:20:56,230
Oh, but like...

4455
03:20:56,230 --> 03:20:56,810
I can...

4456
03:20:56,810 --> 03:20:58,330
I can like travel to you.

4457
03:20:58,610 --> 03:20:59,770
And the teacher was like...

4458
03:20:59,770 --> 03:21:00,690
I can travel to you.

4459
03:21:00,810 --> 03:21:02,350
And then you just need to rent a dance studio.

4460
03:21:02,490 --> 03:21:03,170
So I was like...

4461
03:21:03,170 --> 03:21:04,910
Alright, how much does it cost to rent a dance studio?

4462
03:21:05,150 --> 03:21:07,950
It's like $60-$100 per hour.

4463
03:21:08,370 --> 03:21:09,410
So I was like...

4464
03:21:09,410 --> 03:21:10,450
Bro, I might as well just Uber.

4465
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:12,850
So like...

4466
03:21:12,850 --> 03:21:13,650
I'm like...

4467
03:21:13,650 --> 03:21:15,630
Bro, I might as well fucking Uber there.

4468
03:21:15,770 --> 03:21:17,610
Like it's cheaper at this point.

4469
03:21:18,410 --> 03:21:18,890
Like...

4470
03:21:20,270 --> 03:21:21,770
And Ubering is like...

4471
03:21:21,770 --> 03:21:23,810
The thing is Ubering is like...

4472
03:21:24,390 --> 03:21:26,070
30 minutes as well.

4473
03:21:26,510 --> 03:21:28,010
So it's like...

4474
03:21:28,010 --> 03:21:28,730
Um...

4475
03:21:31,550 --> 03:21:32,750
And so...

4476
03:21:32,750 --> 03:21:35,390
Like if I Uber, it's 30 minutes instead of an hour.

4477
03:21:35,610 --> 03:21:38,610
And like I don't have to fucking rent a dance studio.

4478
03:21:39,350 --> 03:21:39,950
Like...

4479
03:21:39,950 --> 03:21:40,930
But it's just...

4480
03:21:40,930 --> 03:21:42,630
But it's like $30 to get...

4481
03:21:42,630 --> 03:21:46,150
It's like basically paying for an hour at the dance studio.

4482
03:21:46,370 --> 03:21:48,530
But instead, I get two hours.

4483
03:21:49,070 --> 03:21:49,590
Like...

4484
03:21:49,590 --> 03:21:50,270
I get...

4485
03:21:50,270 --> 03:21:52,410
I get two hours instead.

4486
03:21:53,210 --> 03:21:53,810
So...

4487
03:21:53,810 --> 03:21:55,530
Because I'm doing two hour dance lessons.

4488
03:21:55,910 --> 03:21:56,370
And everything.

4489
03:21:56,370 --> 03:21:57,630
So like...

4490
03:21:57,630 --> 03:21:58,430
I'm fucking...

4491
03:21:58,430 --> 03:21:58,970
I'm like...

4492
03:21:58,970 --> 03:21:59,630
I'm like...

4493
03:22:00,370 --> 03:22:01,210
I'm just like...

4494
03:22:01,210 --> 03:22:02,970
Thank you Nikkei for the sponsor.

4495
03:22:03,370 --> 03:22:05,310
It's all going into my dance lessons.

4496
03:22:06,270 --> 03:22:06,580
Like...

4497
03:22:07,870 --> 03:22:10,610
It's all going into my dance lessons.

4498
03:22:11,450 --> 03:22:12,070
Like...

4499
03:22:12,070 --> 03:22:15,950
No, it's $30 to get there.

4500
03:22:16,030 --> 03:22:17,730
And then $30 to get back.

4501
03:22:18,150 --> 03:22:18,770
So...

4502
03:22:21,870 --> 03:22:23,450
And also Payday 3.

4503
03:22:25,010 --> 03:22:25,370
So...

4504
03:22:25,370 --> 03:22:26,610
Payday 3 as well.

4505
03:22:27,090 --> 03:22:28,470
Thank you for the super chat.

4506
03:22:28,590 --> 03:22:28,810
Thank you.

4507
03:22:28,850 --> 03:22:29,430
Thank you.

4508
03:22:30,490 --> 03:22:33,030
Unironically, just hire a chauffeur or a personal driver at this point.

4509
03:22:33,270 --> 03:22:35,350
Probably cheaper and definitely faster in the long run.

4510
03:22:35,430 --> 03:22:36,190
Thank you for the super chat.

4511
03:22:36,270 --> 03:22:36,430
Thank you.

4512
03:22:36,450 --> 03:22:37,650
I feel like it's a lot more expensive.

4513
03:22:38,150 --> 03:22:38,610
Because like...

4514
03:22:38,610 --> 03:22:39,850
They have to be like...

4515
03:22:39,850 --> 03:22:41,470
On call too.

4516
03:22:41,910 --> 03:22:42,230
So like...

4517
03:22:42,230 --> 03:22:42,690
You know...

4518
03:22:42,690 --> 03:22:44,090
What if they're not there?

4519
03:22:45,850 --> 03:22:46,710
What if like...

4520
03:22:46,710 --> 03:22:48,310
I meet them and they're not ready.

4521
03:22:49,090 --> 03:22:49,610
Because like...

4522
03:22:49,610 --> 03:22:50,830
I don't know when I'll need a car.

4523
03:22:51,010 --> 03:22:51,370
Like...

4524
03:22:51,370 --> 03:22:52,910
I don't know when I need to drive somewhere.

4525
03:22:53,150 --> 03:22:55,550
It feels like it's a lot more expensive than Uber.

4526
03:22:57,070 --> 03:22:58,250
Thank you for the super chat.

4527
03:22:58,370 --> 03:22:59,150
Thank you, thank you.

4528
03:22:59,290 --> 03:23:00,630
Broco, thank you for the gifted ship.

4529
03:23:00,710 --> 03:23:01,750
Thank you, thank you.

4530
03:23:03,190 --> 03:23:04,210
I don't trust bikes.

4531
03:23:04,330 --> 03:23:05,970
Unless you live in Europe, I don't...

4532
03:23:07,230 --> 03:23:08,030
I'm sorry.

4533
03:23:08,550 --> 03:23:09,390
But like...

4534
03:23:09,390 --> 03:23:10,970
As long as you live...

4535
03:23:10,970 --> 03:23:12,530
The worst part of living in Canada...

4536
03:23:13,390 --> 03:23:14,290
And I guess America...

4537
03:23:14,290 --> 03:23:15,790
I think it's a thing in America too.

4538
03:23:16,090 --> 03:23:18,030
Is that everything is so fucking far.

4539
03:23:18,330 --> 03:23:19,830
Even when you're in the city.

4540
03:23:19,830 --> 03:23:21,790
Nothing is close by.

4541
03:23:21,950 --> 03:23:23,250
Like, everything is like...

4542
03:23:23,250 --> 03:23:25,910
A fucking 15 minute walk to anywhere.

4543
03:23:26,390 --> 03:23:28,210
Like, you gotta...

4544
03:23:28,210 --> 03:23:31,090
You gotta live in a place...

4545
03:23:31,090 --> 03:23:33,570
Like, even when you live in a fucking city in Canada.

4546
03:23:34,090 --> 03:23:35,050
Like, not...

4547
03:23:35,050 --> 03:23:36,310
True, not in New York City.

4548
03:23:36,470 --> 03:23:37,250
But like...

4549
03:23:37,250 --> 03:23:38,030
Like...

4550
03:23:38,030 --> 03:23:39,730
Yeah, we're the second biggest...

4551
03:23:39,730 --> 03:23:41,510
Country in the world.

4552
03:23:41,830 --> 03:23:42,590
But like...

4553
03:23:42,590 --> 03:23:44,830
I'm pretty sure 70% of Canada...

4554
03:23:45,450 --> 03:23:46,790
Is just ice.

4555
03:23:47,970 --> 03:23:49,070
It's just...

4556
03:23:49,070 --> 03:23:50,010
The land.

4557
03:23:50,190 --> 03:23:51,750
Like, there's nothing there.

4558
03:23:51,950 --> 03:23:54,050
It's literally just the land.

4559
03:24:00,910 --> 03:24:02,930
Only 70%...

4560
03:24:02,930 --> 03:24:04,230
It's just...

4561
03:24:04,230 --> 03:24:05,310
Yeah, it's just...

4562
03:24:05,310 --> 03:24:07,430
It's just a little wild back here.

4563
03:24:08,350 --> 03:24:11,250
If it's not ice, it's forests and lakes.

4564
03:24:11,630 --> 03:24:12,730
Yeah, and then like...

4565
03:24:12,730 --> 03:24:14,110
The last like...

4566
03:24:14,110 --> 03:24:17,030
Like, the last 30% is the actual...

4567
03:24:17,030 --> 03:24:18,610
The actual like...

4568
03:24:18,610 --> 03:24:20,330
Place you can live in.

4569
03:24:21,950 --> 03:24:23,670
Well, I tried in that case.

4570
03:24:23,750 --> 03:24:24,730
I do, I have a...

4571
03:24:24,730 --> 03:24:25,850
I have a license.

4572
03:24:26,450 --> 03:24:28,550
I just haven't driven a car in a long time.

4573
03:24:28,650 --> 03:24:29,830
I don't trust myself.

4574
03:24:30,530 --> 03:24:31,670
Thank you for the super chat.

4575
03:24:31,770 --> 03:24:32,690
Thank you, thank you.

4576
03:24:33,610 --> 03:24:35,650
By the way, I recently found out...

4577
03:24:36,230 --> 03:24:38,790
I have a dog park in my building.

4578
03:24:40,490 --> 03:24:41,850
Yeah, I was trying to find out.

4579
03:24:42,090 --> 03:24:42,970
Cause I was like...

4580
03:24:42,970 --> 03:24:43,630
I was like...

4581
03:24:43,630 --> 03:24:45,130
I was like, do I have a...

4582
03:24:45,130 --> 03:24:46,690
Cause like, I was trying to figure out like...

4583
03:24:47,170 --> 03:24:49,310
Like, dance studios to rent.

4584
03:24:49,790 --> 03:24:50,690
And then like...

4585
03:24:51,390 --> 03:24:52,730
I was looking up like...

4586
03:24:52,730 --> 03:24:54,170
The amenities in my building.

4587
03:24:54,870 --> 03:24:55,870
And I didn't know.

4588
03:24:55,930 --> 03:24:57,270
I've been living here for so long.

4589
03:24:57,370 --> 03:24:58,290
And I didn't know.

4590
03:24:58,410 --> 03:24:59,630
Like, we have a gym and stuff.

4591
03:24:59,710 --> 03:25:00,470
And like a pool.

4592
03:25:00,710 --> 03:25:03,750
But like, I didn't realize we have a fucking dog park.

4593
03:25:08,990 --> 03:25:10,810
Cause I was trying to look for like...

4594
03:25:10,810 --> 03:25:12,990
I was like, oh, do we have like a dance room?

4595
03:25:13,290 --> 03:25:14,730
So I was looking up the map.

4596
03:25:15,010 --> 03:25:16,350
And then I see on the map.

4597
03:25:16,350 --> 03:25:19,090
It's like, here's the building's dog park.

4598
03:25:19,110 --> 03:25:20,390
And I was like, what?

4599
03:25:21,850 --> 03:25:23,790
So I went there like...

4600
03:25:23,790 --> 03:25:24,970
Like, it's really tiny.

4601
03:25:25,050 --> 03:25:28,690
It's like a really tiny little place for like dogs.

4602
03:25:30,050 --> 03:25:30,490
And...

4603
03:25:30,490 --> 03:25:32,050
And there's actual like...

4604
03:25:32,050 --> 03:25:34,650
You know like those like dog parkour stuff?

4605
03:25:34,910 --> 03:25:37,050
Like, you know, when you're doing dog shows and stuff.

4606
03:25:37,290 --> 03:25:39,110
And then they have those like ramps and everything.

4607
03:25:39,290 --> 03:25:40,710
And there's hoops to jump through.

4608
03:25:41,010 --> 03:25:42,370
They had that shit.

4609
03:25:42,430 --> 03:25:44,530
I mean like, dad can't fucking jump through those hoops.

4610
03:25:44,590 --> 03:25:45,170
It's like really tall.

4611
03:25:45,170 --> 03:25:46,050
But they had that.

4612
03:25:46,170 --> 03:25:46,750
It's like really tall.

4613
03:25:46,810 --> 03:25:47,430
It's a tiny one.

4614
03:25:47,530 --> 03:25:48,410
But like, you can like...

4615
03:25:48,410 --> 03:25:53,530
They even have like little dog poop bags that you can just use to pick up.

4616
03:25:53,650 --> 03:25:55,010
And like, it's crazy.

4617
03:25:55,470 --> 03:25:58,550
Like, how would that jump for me?

4618
03:25:58,950 --> 03:25:59,390
Yeah.

4619
03:25:59,510 --> 03:26:01,530
And I was just like, I have a dog park?

4620
03:26:01,770 --> 03:26:04,010
And I was like, holy shit.

4621
03:26:05,290 --> 03:26:05,670
Anyway.

4622
03:26:06,110 --> 03:26:06,890
That's great.

4623
03:26:07,210 --> 03:26:07,990
And Nick let's me...

4624
03:26:07,990 --> 03:26:08,850
It's like...

4625
03:26:08,850 --> 03:26:10,310
Now I'm like...

4626
03:26:10,310 --> 03:26:11,690
So that's where they...

4627
03:26:11,690 --> 03:26:12,950
Sometimes I was like...

4628
03:26:12,950 --> 03:26:13,690
Why do they...

4629
03:26:13,690 --> 03:26:18,010
Sometimes I see people with their dogs and they stop off at a particular floor.

4630
03:26:18,230 --> 03:26:19,050
And I'm like, wait.

4631
03:26:19,110 --> 03:26:20,630
Why are they stopping off at that floor?

4632
03:26:20,710 --> 03:26:21,790
That's where the gym is.

4633
03:26:22,610 --> 03:26:23,010
Like...

4634
03:26:23,010 --> 03:26:25,890
I didn't realize there was a dog park getting in there.

4635
03:26:26,230 --> 03:26:27,390
Like, I was like...

4636
03:26:27,390 --> 03:26:29,490
Why did they go and fucking take their dog to the gym?

4637
03:26:29,710 --> 03:26:31,250
I would always be so confused.

4638
03:26:31,350 --> 03:26:33,150
Because I'd be like, why did they stop on this floor?

4639
03:26:33,310 --> 03:26:34,790
And I'm like, oh, now.

4640
03:26:35,290 --> 03:26:36,450
Now that's why.

4641
03:26:37,450 --> 03:26:39,010
I fucking was going...

4642
03:26:39,010 --> 03:26:42,490
I was walking my dog like a fucking caveman outside.

4643
03:26:45,950 --> 03:26:46,690
Like...

4644
03:26:46,690 --> 03:26:50,730
I'm like, I can't believe I had to take my dog outside.

4645
03:26:51,150 --> 03:26:51,690
Like...

4646
03:26:51,690 --> 03:26:53,050
Like the peasants.

4647
03:26:53,390 --> 03:26:55,350
I could have...

4648
03:26:55,350 --> 03:26:58,090
I can't believe...

4649
03:26:58,090 --> 03:27:00,670
Like the commoners outside.

4650
03:27:02,210 --> 03:27:02,950
Like...

4651
03:27:02,950 --> 03:27:03,910
I could have been...

4652
03:27:03,910 --> 03:27:08,430
I could have been walking in the fancy dog park.

4653
03:27:09,190 --> 03:27:13,570
I'm about these commoners where their buildings don't have dog parks.

4654
03:27:13,690 --> 03:27:15,110
Like a fucking casual.

4655
03:27:17,610 --> 03:27:21,650
Oh, what was funny was that...

4656
03:27:21,650 --> 03:27:23,450
There were like other owners there.

4657
03:27:23,670 --> 03:27:25,010
With their dogs.

4658
03:27:25,490 --> 03:27:26,650
And then like...

4659
03:27:26,650 --> 03:27:29,650
And then their dogs were like super social.

4660
03:27:30,190 --> 03:27:33,850
And then my dog was like anti-social.

4661
03:27:34,530 --> 03:27:35,510
I mean, he tried.

4662
03:27:35,890 --> 03:27:36,350
He tried.

4663
03:27:36,430 --> 03:27:37,530
But then they were like...

4664
03:27:37,530 --> 03:27:39,030
Way too social.

4665
03:27:39,350 --> 03:27:40,690
They were like...

4666
03:27:40,690 --> 03:27:42,050
Way too social.

4667
03:27:42,810 --> 03:27:43,530
And so...

4668
03:27:44,090 --> 03:27:46,090
So he didn't like that.

4669
03:27:46,250 --> 03:27:48,510
Because he didn't like how active they are.

4670
03:27:48,990 --> 03:27:49,730
So like...

4671
03:27:49,730 --> 03:27:50,350
He walked...

4672
03:27:50,350 --> 03:27:52,230
Because he walked up to the owners.

4673
03:27:52,650 --> 03:27:54,850
And like started barking at them.

4674
03:27:54,970 --> 03:27:56,010
And was like...

4675
03:27:56,010 --> 03:27:56,850
Was like...

4676
03:27:56,850 --> 03:27:57,610
Teach them...

4677
03:27:58,270 --> 03:27:59,670
Just like...

4678
03:27:59,670 --> 03:28:01,670
Control your dogs.

4679
03:28:02,370 --> 03:28:03,850
He literally like...

4680
03:28:03,850 --> 03:28:05,670
Walked up to the owners.

4681
03:28:05,950 --> 03:28:06,530
Like...

4682
03:28:06,530 --> 03:28:08,010
There were like three dogs.

4683
03:28:08,270 --> 03:28:08,990
At the park.

4684
03:28:09,490 --> 03:28:09,890
At the...

4685
03:28:09,890 --> 03:28:10,550
You know, the building.

4686
03:28:10,750 --> 03:28:11,190
Dog park.

4687
03:28:11,310 --> 03:28:12,830
And he like walked up to like...

4688
03:28:12,830 --> 03:28:13,330
The owners.

4689
03:28:13,550 --> 03:28:14,610
And was like...

4690
03:28:15,850 --> 03:28:16,370
Teach...

4691
03:28:16,370 --> 03:28:18,370
Teach them to control themselves.

4692
03:28:20,770 --> 03:28:22,070
He just like...

4693
03:28:22,070 --> 03:28:22,790
I was like...

4694
03:28:22,790 --> 03:28:23,330
Please.

4695
03:28:24,170 --> 03:28:24,690
Please.

4696
03:28:24,870 --> 03:28:25,930
Don't do that.

4697
03:28:26,490 --> 03:28:27,990
What is wrong with him?

4698
03:28:29,850 --> 03:28:31,570
Because he didn't like how...

4699
03:28:31,570 --> 03:28:33,170
Because they kept like bothering him.

4700
03:28:33,190 --> 03:28:34,290
And he didn't like that.

4701
03:28:34,370 --> 03:28:34,910
He was like...

4702
03:28:34,910 --> 03:28:35,290
Look.

4703
03:28:35,290 --> 03:28:35,810
Look.

4704
03:28:35,970 --> 03:28:37,730
I tolerate your presence.

4705
03:28:37,950 --> 03:28:39,730
He didn't like how they were like...

4706
03:28:39,730 --> 03:28:41,190
Want him to like...

4707
03:28:41,190 --> 03:28:42,710
He didn't like...

4708
03:28:42,710 --> 03:28:43,430
He didn't like that.

4709
03:28:43,530 --> 03:28:43,830
He like...

4710
03:28:43,830 --> 03:28:45,530
They want him to be more...

4711
03:28:45,530 --> 03:28:46,050
Social.

4712
03:28:46,330 --> 03:28:47,410
Like the other dogs.

4713
03:28:47,870 --> 03:28:48,410
They were like...

4714
03:28:48,410 --> 03:28:49,830
Why don't you play with us?

4715
03:28:49,850 --> 03:28:51,010
And then he was like...

4716
03:28:51,010 --> 03:28:51,610
He was like...

4717
03:28:51,610 --> 03:28:52,530
Get away from...

4718
03:28:52,530 --> 03:28:53,170
He was like...

4719
03:28:53,170 --> 03:28:53,430
Look.

4720
03:28:53,490 --> 03:28:55,610
I'm tolerating you right now.

4721
03:28:57,310 --> 03:28:59,630
And then they wouldn't stop bothering him.

4722
03:29:00,590 --> 03:29:01,930
They wouldn't stop bothering him.

4723
03:29:01,930 --> 03:29:03,330
So he just walked up to the owners.

4724
03:29:03,490 --> 03:29:04,930
And just started barking at them.

4725
03:29:04,930 --> 03:29:05,870
Because he got mad.

4726
03:29:06,130 --> 03:29:07,510
He got so annoyed.

4727
03:29:07,730 --> 03:29:08,370
I'm like...

4728
03:29:08,370 --> 03:29:09,050
I'm sorry.

4729
03:29:09,310 --> 03:29:10,830
I'm so sorry.

4730
03:29:13,350 --> 03:29:13,910
Anyway.

4731
03:29:14,170 --> 03:29:14,990
So there's that.

4732
03:29:17,430 --> 03:29:19,130
What else is there?

4733
03:29:21,130 --> 03:29:22,970
I'm looking at...

4734
03:29:22,970 --> 03:29:24,210
Let's see.

4735
03:29:24,310 --> 03:29:25,350
I'm looking at like...

4736
03:29:25,350 --> 03:29:27,470
My list of stuff I want to talk about.

4737
03:29:28,810 --> 03:29:29,530
Oh yeah.

4738
03:29:29,590 --> 03:29:30,610
You know what was funny?

4739
03:29:30,990 --> 03:29:32,490
I got my hair done.

4740
03:29:33,010 --> 03:29:34,230
And then they were like...

4741
03:29:34,230 --> 03:29:34,850
Oh yeah.

4742
03:29:35,010 --> 03:29:36,130
Make sure you don't...

4743
03:29:36,130 --> 03:29:39,470
Like, you don't wash your hair for two days for the dye to set in.

4744
03:29:39,750 --> 03:29:40,310
I was like...

4745
03:29:40,310 --> 03:29:40,630
Sweet.

4746
03:29:41,170 --> 03:29:43,030
And then I went outside and it was raining.

4747
03:29:48,920 --> 03:29:49,880
I'm like...

4748
03:29:49,880 --> 03:29:50,620
Not sweet.

4749
03:29:54,520 --> 03:29:56,180
I was like...

4750
03:29:56,180 --> 03:29:56,560
Okay.

4751
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:02,540
I had a raincoat on, but still.

4752
03:30:02,740 --> 03:30:03,560
I was just like...

4753
03:30:04,510 --> 03:30:06,480
It wasn't raining before.

4754
03:30:09,800 --> 03:30:11,840
The sun was out!

4755
03:30:12,360 --> 03:30:14,980
I took my chance.

4756
03:30:15,300 --> 03:30:16,160
I was like...

4757
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:17,100
The sun's out.

4758
03:30:17,200 --> 03:30:18,280
It's a good day.

4759
03:30:18,640 --> 03:30:19,780
What could go wrong?

4760
03:30:20,240 --> 03:30:26,080
And then three hours later, it started raining.

4761
03:30:28,320 --> 03:30:31,620
I had a raincoat on, but like, you know.

4762
03:30:33,660 --> 03:30:37,540
And then when I almost got home, it stopped raining.

4763
03:30:37,820 --> 03:30:38,760
It was like...

4764
03:30:38,760 --> 03:30:42,480
When I was like five minutes from home, the clouds were gone.

4765
03:30:42,660 --> 03:30:43,760
And I'm like...

4766
03:30:43,760 --> 03:30:44,000
Bro.

4767
03:30:48,920 --> 03:30:54,280
I could've waited at the salon if I knew that the clouds were gonna stop.

4768
03:30:54,620 --> 03:30:56,640
If the rain was gonna stop.

4769
03:30:57,700 --> 03:30:59,660
That was my life.

4770
03:31:00,000 --> 03:31:01,860
That was targeted right there.

4771
03:31:01,940 --> 03:31:03,040
That was targeted harassment.

4772
03:31:03,560 --> 03:31:04,020
Right there.

4773
03:31:04,180 --> 03:31:07,040
If I could, I would report the sky to HR.

4774
03:31:07,460 --> 03:31:08,200
If I could.

4775
03:31:13,660 --> 03:31:14,920
Alright, back to...

4776
03:31:14,920 --> 03:31:16,120
I'll read five more superchats.

4777
03:31:16,240 --> 03:31:17,440
I talked a lot today.

4778
03:31:19,360 --> 03:31:20,260
Thank you, superchat.

4779
03:31:20,380 --> 03:31:21,120
Thank you, thank you.

4780
03:31:21,480 --> 03:31:24,280
Doki, the man with one eye is already closing his eyes to aim.

4781
03:31:24,400 --> 03:31:25,500
Thank you for the superchat.

4782
03:31:25,680 --> 03:31:25,800
Thank you.

4783
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:27,660
Wait, but what about depth perception?

4784
03:31:27,960 --> 03:31:29,560
You lose your depth perception.

4785
03:31:30,240 --> 03:31:33,240
I mean, to be fair, I have two eyes and I still don't have depth perception.

4786
03:31:33,240 --> 03:31:34,020
But that's different.

4787
03:31:34,220 --> 03:31:34,880
That's different.

4788
03:31:34,980 --> 03:31:36,300
Thank you for the superchat.

4789
03:31:36,380 --> 03:31:36,700
Thank you.

4790
03:31:36,780 --> 03:31:37,460
Thank you.

4791
03:31:39,500 --> 03:31:40,220
Let's see.

4792
03:31:44,380 --> 03:31:45,700
Memento, thank you for the superchat.

4793
03:31:45,780 --> 03:31:46,020
Thank you.

4794
03:31:46,060 --> 03:31:46,460
Thank you.

4795
03:31:46,540 --> 03:31:47,840
Welcome to the SBMM hell.

4796
03:31:47,960 --> 03:31:48,720
That is modern cod.

4797
03:31:48,800 --> 03:31:49,820
It only gets worse from here.

4798
03:31:49,900 --> 03:31:50,620
Thank you for the superchat.

4799
03:31:50,720 --> 03:31:51,000
Thank you.

4800
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:51,680
Thank you.

4801
03:31:52,120 --> 03:31:52,740
Oh yeah!

4802
03:31:53,120 --> 03:31:56,780
Hardcore Minecraft with Mint on the six.

4803
03:31:57,060 --> 03:31:57,640
On the six.

4804
03:31:58,480 --> 03:32:01,780
And we're not gonna stop stream until we beat hardcore Minecraft.

4805
03:32:01,780 --> 03:32:02,780
We waited.

4806
03:32:03,020 --> 03:32:03,540
We waited.

4807
03:32:03,840 --> 03:32:11,540
The reason why it took so long to get this collab going is that we waited because we were waiting for Mint to debut her new model.

4808
03:32:12,660 --> 03:32:13,900
So, that's why.

4809
03:32:14,160 --> 03:32:15,400
Because we thought it'd be better.

4810
03:32:15,760 --> 03:32:17,920
Because, you know, shiny.

4811
03:32:22,380 --> 03:32:23,660
So, that's why.

4812
03:32:24,580 --> 03:32:28,380
That's why, like, we haven't said anything about it for a while.

4813
03:32:28,480 --> 03:32:29,100
But next week.

4814
03:32:29,160 --> 03:32:31,420
Next week, we're gonna have it on the six, I believe.

4815
03:32:31,420 --> 03:32:32,040
I think so, yeah.

4816
03:32:32,080 --> 03:32:33,340
We were, like, talking about it yesterday.

4817
03:32:38,500 --> 03:32:39,300
What else?

4818
03:32:39,520 --> 03:32:39,700
What else?

4819
03:32:39,860 --> 03:32:40,120
What else?

4820
03:32:40,480 --> 03:32:40,740
Cat!

4821
03:32:40,920 --> 03:32:41,660
Thank you for the superchat.

4822
03:32:41,820 --> 03:32:41,980
Thank you.

4823
03:32:42,260 --> 03:32:42,760
That's it.

4824
03:32:42,780 --> 03:32:43,560
You're down, kiddo.

4825
03:32:43,660 --> 03:32:45,840
The boys are waiting for us.

4826
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:47,740
Oh yeah.

4827
03:32:48,120 --> 03:32:51,500
I can't wait for you guys to see what I cooked for Halloween.

4828
03:32:52,220 --> 03:32:54,020
I know her stream starts at four.

4829
03:32:54,300 --> 03:32:56,640
So, like, that's why I scheduled mine at six.

4830
03:32:56,880 --> 03:32:58,260
I don't know if it'll be done by then.

4831
03:32:58,260 --> 03:33:02,600
But, like, you know, let's you guys have time to enjoy her new model debut.

4832
03:33:02,860 --> 03:33:04,800
Before you hop over to my stream.

4833
03:33:05,000 --> 03:33:05,800
Or, like, don't.

4834
03:33:07,060 --> 03:33:09,040
Or don't and just watch the VOD.

4835
03:33:09,840 --> 03:33:11,620
When her stream's over.

4836
03:33:16,480 --> 03:33:17,800
Delta, thank you for the superchat.

4837
03:33:17,900 --> 03:33:18,700
Thank you, thank you.

4838
03:33:19,100 --> 03:33:20,420
For your knife-buying fun.

4839
03:33:20,560 --> 03:33:22,620
Doki, get some good knives, including a bread knife.

4840
03:33:22,740 --> 03:33:24,540
My oshi needs to adopt better.

4841
03:33:24,600 --> 03:33:25,100
I'm getting

4842
03:33:32,900 --> 03:33:34,980
better at being an adult now.

4843
03:33:34,980 --> 03:33:37,260
Thank you for the superchat.

4844
03:33:37,320 --> 03:33:38,620
Thank you, thank you.

4845
03:33:42,980 --> 03:33:44,240
Soma, thank you for the superchat.

4846
03:33:44,340 --> 03:33:45,120
Thank you, thank you.

4847
03:33:45,160 --> 03:33:47,220
Doki wore a $300 haircut.

4848
03:33:47,480 --> 03:33:49,060
Bro, he didn't even cut that...

4849
03:33:49,060 --> 03:33:50,920
I mean, I think he did layers or something.

4850
03:33:51,140 --> 03:33:52,100
Cause, like, um...

4851
03:33:52,520 --> 03:33:53,220
Cause I didn't know.

4852
03:33:53,300 --> 03:33:54,580
I don't really care that much.

4853
03:33:56,440 --> 03:33:59,580
I don't know.

4854
03:33:59,860 --> 03:34:01,040
Like, I don't care too...

4855
03:34:01,040 --> 03:34:02,440
I know, like, hair is important.

4856
03:34:02,800 --> 03:34:04,720
But, like, it's so annoying.

4857
03:34:04,720 --> 03:34:06,020
Cause, like, oh my god.

4858
03:34:06,100 --> 03:34:07,180
When he was, like, trying...

4859
03:34:07,180 --> 03:34:09,320
I was like, yeah, I need you to thin my hair.

4860
03:34:09,460 --> 03:34:11,400
Because, like, I have a lot of hair.

4861
03:34:12,300 --> 03:34:14,160
So, um, it's so annoying.

4862
03:34:14,320 --> 03:34:15,860
Cause, like, cause he was, like...

4863
03:34:16,300 --> 03:34:18,120
He was dyeing my hair.

4864
03:34:18,540 --> 03:34:20,440
And then, and then, like...

4865
03:34:20,440 --> 03:34:22,580
He used up the entire dye.

4866
03:34:22,780 --> 03:34:24,220
And he was like, wait.

4867
03:34:24,460 --> 03:34:25,660
Oh my god, you have so much hair.

4868
03:34:26,580 --> 03:34:26,940
Like...

4869
03:34:26,940 --> 03:34:29,540
Cause, like, he had to make a second batch.

4870
03:34:29,840 --> 03:34:31,200
Cause there was too much.

4871
03:34:31,440 --> 03:34:32,300
It's just...

4872
03:34:32,300 --> 03:34:32,940
He, like...

4873
03:34:32,940 --> 03:34:33,620
He, like...

4874
03:34:33,620 --> 03:34:35,620
He got, like, his, you know, his, like...

4875
03:34:35,620 --> 03:34:36,780
Bag of dye.

4876
03:34:36,940 --> 03:34:37,780
And then, he was like...

4877
03:34:37,780 --> 03:34:39,440
He finished the entire...

4878
03:34:39,440 --> 03:34:41,020
He finished the entire bowl.

4879
03:34:41,380 --> 03:34:45,300
And then, there was still, like, 40% left to do.

4880
03:34:45,520 --> 03:34:46,740
And, um...

4881
03:34:46,740 --> 03:34:47,740
And, like, I told you.

4882
03:34:47,840 --> 03:34:49,080
Like, I was like, yeah, I told you.

4883
03:34:49,140 --> 03:34:50,240
Like, I need you...

4884
03:34:50,240 --> 03:34:52,620
I need you to thin it out.

4885
03:34:53,640 --> 03:34:54,080
Like...

4886
03:34:55,420 --> 03:34:55,860
Like...

4887
03:34:55,860 --> 03:34:56,480
Like...

4888
03:34:56,480 --> 03:34:56,700
Um...

4889
03:34:57,320 --> 03:34:59,020
Like, it's a bowl of dye.

4890
03:34:59,220 --> 03:35:00,240
And, um...

4891
03:35:00,240 --> 03:35:02,140
Every time, like, it's just so annoying.

4892
03:35:02,140 --> 03:35:03,780
Cause it's actually, like, really heavy.

4893
03:35:03,940 --> 03:35:06,340
And, like, my hair grows back so fast, too.

4894
03:35:06,560 --> 03:35:08,000
So, it's so annoying.

4895
03:35:08,240 --> 03:35:09,180
And, like, usually, I just...

4896
03:35:09,700 --> 03:35:11,300
I just, like, trim it.

4897
03:35:11,400 --> 03:35:12,480
Like, um...

4898
03:35:12,480 --> 03:35:13,220
I trim it.

4899
03:35:13,280 --> 03:35:14,960
And then, I sell $300.

4900
03:35:15,460 --> 03:35:17,680
Like, I sell $300.

4901
03:35:18,120 --> 03:35:19,420
It's cause of the dye.

4902
03:35:19,740 --> 03:35:22,280
The dye was the fucking issue.

4903
03:35:22,480 --> 03:35:23,600
Like, it's, like...

4904
03:35:23,600 --> 03:35:24,680
I didn't even realize.

4905
03:35:24,760 --> 03:35:25,240
There's, like...

4906
03:35:25,240 --> 03:35:25,760
Oh, my God.

4907
03:35:25,800 --> 03:35:26,120
I swear.

4908
03:35:26,220 --> 03:35:28,360
Cutting hair has, like, evolved so much.

4909
03:35:28,380 --> 03:35:30,200
Cause now, you have ear guards, too.

4910
03:35:30,320 --> 03:35:31,180
They put, like, these little...

4911
03:35:31,780 --> 03:35:33,520
Like, things on your ears.

4912
03:35:33,600 --> 03:35:34,520
They guard your ears.

4913
03:35:34,640 --> 03:35:37,180
So, like, the dye won't, like, touch your ears and everything.

4914
03:35:37,340 --> 03:35:38,000
And I'm, like, wow.

4915
03:35:38,500 --> 03:35:39,800
I can't believe I didn't have that.

4916
03:35:39,900 --> 03:35:40,580
Like, as a...

4917
03:35:41,700 --> 03:35:42,760
As a child.

4918
03:35:42,920 --> 03:35:43,580
Cause, like...

4919
03:35:43,580 --> 03:35:46,020
Yeah, children ears are not that good, I guess.

4920
03:35:46,240 --> 03:35:48,400
Like, children ears aren't that important.

4921
03:35:48,820 --> 03:35:51,760
Cause I swear, I never had these fucking ear guards before.

4922
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:52,540
The ear shield.

4923
03:35:53,040 --> 03:35:55,680
Like, that's when you know I'm in a fancy place.

4924
03:35:59,100 --> 03:36:00,340
Let me try going full white here.

4925
03:36:00,640 --> 03:36:01,640
That doesn't work!

4926
03:36:01,640 --> 03:36:03,220
It's not, like, my head.

4927
03:36:03,400 --> 03:36:04,620
It's, like, full white hair.

4928
03:36:05,400 --> 03:36:05,800
Um...

4929
03:36:05,800 --> 03:36:07,640
It's not even full, uh...

4930
03:36:08,380 --> 03:36:09,100
White hair.

4931
03:36:09,200 --> 03:36:10,240
It's, like...

4932
03:36:10,240 --> 03:36:10,760
Um...

4933
03:36:10,760 --> 03:36:12,280
It's, like, strands of it.

4934
03:36:12,700 --> 03:36:13,860
Like, it's not even full.

4935
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:14,660
It's, like, some...

4936
03:36:14,660 --> 03:36:16,260
So, like, it's not even together.

4937
03:36:16,420 --> 03:36:17,420
That's the worst part.

4938
03:36:17,460 --> 03:36:18,640
It's not, like, they grow together.

4939
03:36:19,240 --> 03:36:20,040
It's, like...

4940
03:36:20,040 --> 03:36:21,900
It's, like, they grow in some places.

4941
03:36:22,120 --> 03:36:22,520
Like...

4942
03:36:23,020 --> 03:36:23,680
It's, like...

4943
03:36:23,680 --> 03:36:25,300
It's, like, random spray.

4944
03:36:25,360 --> 03:36:26,240
Like, you know, like...

4945
03:36:26,240 --> 03:36:30,960
You know, when you're spraying a AK-47 and it's a random spray on the fucking...

4946
03:36:30,960 --> 03:36:31,680
Sorry, I'm...

4947
03:36:31,680 --> 03:36:34,220
Like, for you gamers who don't understand...

4948
03:36:34,220 --> 03:36:34,640
For...

4949
03:36:35,260 --> 03:36:36,100
For you...

4950
03:36:36,100 --> 03:36:39,340
For you gamers who don't understand about, like, hair.

4951
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:43,620
So, it's, like, when you get an AK-47, you spray a lot and it's, like, a random spray.

4952
03:36:44,140 --> 03:36:44,600
And...

4953
03:36:45,100 --> 03:36:45,840
That's, like...

4954
03:36:45,840 --> 03:36:46,780
That's, like, my hair.

4955
03:36:47,060 --> 03:36:47,720
It doesn't...

4956
03:36:47,720 --> 03:36:49,920
It doesn't go in, like...

4957
03:36:49,920 --> 03:36:50,520
Um...

4958
03:36:50,520 --> 03:36:51,440
One area.

4959
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:52,680
Like, one tiny area.

4960
03:36:52,800 --> 03:36:56,980
It's, like, somehow there'd be, like, a white hair in there and a white hair there.

4961
03:36:57,080 --> 03:36:57,980
And it's, like...

4962
03:36:57,980 --> 03:37:00,540
It's not even, like, too little that you can...

4963
03:37:00,540 --> 03:37:01,130
And, like, you know...

4964
03:37:01,520 --> 03:37:04,300
I have dark hair, so, like, it pops out, too.

4965
03:37:04,940 --> 03:37:07,140
Can you explain it in Apex terms?

4966
03:37:07,480 --> 03:37:07,840
Yeah!

4967
03:37:08,180 --> 03:37:09,760
Yeah, I can explain it in Apex terms.

4968
03:37:09,840 --> 03:37:12,720
So, like, you know when you get a Peacekeeper and, like, you know...

4969
03:37:12,720 --> 03:37:15,480
Sometimes you hit, like, tens instead of a hundred.

4970
03:37:15,900 --> 03:37:17,260
So, because of the spread.

4971
03:37:17,620 --> 03:37:21,320
So, like, instead of hitting a hundred, you know, all the white hair at the hundred...

4972
03:37:21,320 --> 03:37:23,360
It's, like, at a ten, because, like...

4973
03:37:23,360 --> 03:37:26,320
Like, 90% of that goes to a different area.

4974
03:37:26,780 --> 03:37:27,160
So...

4975
03:37:29,980 --> 03:37:30,340
Understandable.

4976
03:37:30,560 --> 03:37:32,060
Yeah, the shot pattern.

4977
03:37:32,900 --> 03:37:34,160
Oh, I get it now.

4978
03:37:34,260 --> 03:37:34,700
I understand.

4979
03:37:34,940 --> 03:37:36,720
Now that you explained it in Apex terms.

4980
03:37:39,240 --> 03:37:39,600
Like...

4981
03:37:40,880 --> 03:37:43,260
So, yeah, that's basically how it works.

4982
03:37:45,700 --> 03:37:47,540
But it's so fucking annoying.

4983
03:37:48,700 --> 03:37:49,700
But, yeah, I haven't...

4984
03:37:49,700 --> 03:37:52,460
Like I said, I haven't dyed my hair in, like, a year and a half.

4985
03:37:52,580 --> 03:37:54,780
Because, you know, I never felt like I needed to.

4986
03:37:54,880 --> 03:37:56,260
And, like, I was really busy and everything.

4987
03:37:56,800 --> 03:37:57,940
But now it's like, you know what?

4988
03:37:57,960 --> 03:37:58,760
I'm gonna treat myself.

4989
03:37:59,360 --> 03:38:02,900
Now, like, I don't like looking at the gray hair.

4990
03:38:03,120 --> 03:38:03,560
Like, I was like...

4991
03:38:03,560 --> 03:38:06,140
I was at a point, I was like, I don't like looking at the gray hair anymore.

4992
03:38:06,400 --> 03:38:08,240
I was like, I look like a fucking...

4993
03:38:08,240 --> 03:38:10,020
Oh, my God, I look like a mess.

4994
03:38:10,340 --> 03:38:12,820
Like, you know, go outside and be like, what's wrong with her?

4995
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:13,440
You know?

4996
03:38:13,720 --> 03:38:14,960
Like, I could tell...

4997
03:38:14,960 --> 03:38:15,760
Like, now I could tell.

4998
03:38:15,860 --> 03:38:17,540
It's just like, you know...

4999
03:38:17,540 --> 03:38:20,000
Like, it's like I don't have things together.

5000
03:38:20,220 --> 03:38:21,220
Like, all together.

5001
03:38:21,760 --> 03:38:23,240
So, I was like, oh, I should, like...

5002
03:38:23,240 --> 03:38:23,540
I know.

5003
03:38:23,540 --> 03:38:26,700
I should at least look like I have something together.

5004
03:38:26,920 --> 03:38:29,240
Like, my life's not a mess right now.

5005
03:38:29,580 --> 03:38:31,460
So, it's weird because, like...

5006
03:38:31,460 --> 03:38:32,960
Back then, I don't go outside a lot.

5007
03:38:33,140 --> 03:38:34,140
But now I do.

5008
03:38:34,360 --> 03:38:36,340
So, like, I go outside a lot now.

5009
03:38:36,620 --> 03:38:38,340
For, like, adult stuff.

5010
03:38:41,120 --> 03:38:41,560
So...

5011
03:38:42,960 --> 03:38:43,840
So, like...

5012
03:38:43,840 --> 03:38:46,680
So, like, now that I go outside more, I was like, oh, man, no.

5013
03:38:47,120 --> 03:38:48,380
Now I can actually be judged.

5014
03:38:52,720 --> 03:38:53,080
So...

5015
03:38:53,080 --> 03:38:54,660
Guys, I'm not...

5016
03:38:55,460 --> 03:38:58,180
Guys, it's not because, like, I'm getting old.

5017
03:38:58,260 --> 03:38:58,820
I told you.

5018
03:38:58,960 --> 03:39:01,380
I had gray hair since I was, like, four.

5019
03:39:01,860 --> 03:39:04,340
I had gray hair since I was four because I'm like...

5020
03:39:04,340 --> 03:39:07,080
I don't produce enough melanin in my hair.

5021
03:39:07,420 --> 03:39:08,540
So, like...

5022
03:39:08,540 --> 03:39:11,080
So, I've had gray hair since four.

5023
03:39:11,200 --> 03:39:12,020
It's just...

5024
03:39:12,020 --> 03:39:13,580
For a year and a half, I just didn't care.

5025
03:39:13,700 --> 03:39:15,280
Because I was like, I don't need to go outside.

5026
03:39:15,580 --> 03:39:16,480
But now I do.

5027
03:39:16,580 --> 03:39:18,360
So, now I'm like, fuck, I actually do.

5028
03:39:18,360 --> 03:39:19,820
I do have to dye my hair.

5029
03:39:23,340 --> 03:39:24,060
Anyway, guys.

5030
03:39:24,540 --> 03:39:25,240
I'm Gala here.

5031
03:39:25,460 --> 03:39:27,360
I had a great time talking with all you guys.

5032
03:39:28,640 --> 03:39:30,800
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

5033
03:39:30,960 --> 03:39:31,520
Posture check.

5034
03:39:31,640 --> 03:39:33,500
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5035
03:39:33,600 --> 03:39:35,500
And if you stand for me, head to bed.

5036
03:39:35,560 --> 03:39:36,860
Because you deserve it.

5037
03:39:36,980 --> 03:39:38,360
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5038
03:39:39,180 --> 03:39:39,980
Bye, guys.

5039
03:39:40,300 --> 03:39:40,700
Bye.

5040
03:39:41,020 --> 03:39:44,020
Also, nominate me at the streamer awards.

5041
03:39:44,080 --> 03:39:45,500
I don't know about getting a nomination.

5042
03:39:45,720 --> 03:39:46,840
But, you know, it's worth a shot.

5043
03:39:46,840 --> 03:39:47,840
I don't know.

5044
03:39:47,980 --> 03:39:49,760
It'd be cool if I do get nominated.

5045
03:39:49,880 --> 03:39:50,640
I don't expect to win.

5046
03:39:51,080 --> 03:39:53,020
I just thought it'd be cool if I get nominated.

5047
03:39:53,200 --> 03:39:54,120
And that's really all I want.

5048
03:39:55,080 --> 03:39:55,540
So, yeah.

5049
03:39:55,860 --> 03:39:56,740
Just go to the link.

5050
03:39:57,120 --> 03:39:57,960
Go to the link.

5051
03:39:58,140 --> 03:40:02,220
And then just write, like, best VTuber.

5052
03:40:02,280 --> 03:40:03,620
I don't even remember what the category is.

5053
03:40:03,680 --> 03:40:04,340
Something VTuber.

5054
03:40:04,600 --> 03:40:07,080
Just do control F, VTuber, write Doki Bird.

5055
03:40:07,180 --> 03:40:07,600
That's it.

5056
03:40:09,500 --> 03:40:11,080
I really appreciate it.

5057
03:40:11,580 --> 03:40:13,900
I know it's a popular vote to get nominated.

5058
03:40:14,260 --> 03:40:15,080
So, yeah.

5059
03:40:15,080 --> 03:40:17,200
So, it's mostly just, like, whoever...

5060
03:40:17,200 --> 03:40:17,900
It's like those, like...

5061
03:40:17,900 --> 03:40:18,480
What is it called?

5062
03:40:18,520 --> 03:40:19,540
It's like those streamer awards.

5063
03:40:19,640 --> 03:40:20,780
You remember those streamer awards?

5064
03:40:21,060 --> 03:40:24,680
Where it's literally, like, people just rally their fans to, like, submit.

5065
03:40:25,340 --> 03:40:27,700
Nominate themselves, like, every day or something.

5066
03:40:27,760 --> 03:40:28,520
Like, I don't do that.

5067
03:40:28,620 --> 03:40:31,860
But, like, I just figured, like, just put it up for a bit.

5068
03:40:32,260 --> 03:40:33,080
And then...

5069
03:40:34,120 --> 03:40:34,760
And, yeah.

5070
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:37,060
I just thought it'd be cool if I get nominated.

5071
03:40:38,280 --> 03:40:38,960
Anyway, guys.

5072
03:40:39,380 --> 03:40:41,040
As always, everybody, say, hi, J-Paw.

5073
03:40:41,120 --> 03:40:42,360
Check him around to get that blood flowing.

5074
03:40:42,480 --> 03:40:42,900
Say it for me.

5075
03:40:42,960 --> 03:40:43,440
Head to bed.

5076
03:40:43,440 --> 03:40:45,100
I think I already said that before, but I'm going to say it again.

5077
03:40:45,460 --> 03:40:46,340
Because you deserve it.

5078
03:40:46,420 --> 03:40:47,840
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5079
03:40:48,340 --> 03:40:48,820
Bye, guys.

5080
03:40:49,280 --> 03:40:49,520
Bye.
