1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,300
Okay.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,600
Yeah, it's gonna take me like one game to wake up, so like...

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,080
That's all I'm just gonna give it to tell you guys right now.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,040
It'll take me one game to like fully process what's happening.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,100
So...

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,180
Oh, I already went... I'm already fucking pre-live, right?

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,700
No, well, it's not live yet, because there's still that three-minute shit.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,360
But like, I'm already fucking in it right now.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,700
I'm fucking...

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,660
I'm so excited to go.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,100
I'm not gonna lie.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,440
A little bit of slurring on the words.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,460
Yeah, give me an hour.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,400
No, not an hour.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,120
Give me one game.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,760
An hour?!

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,460
One game.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,800
One game and I'll wake up.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,440
Yeah, one game.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm so used to... I'm so used to this.

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,420
I just need one game.

22
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,080
We're gonna shock you, is what's gonna happen.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,240
We're gonna win in the first one.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,120
That'll keep you awake forever.

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm just gonna be like...

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,000
Whoa!

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,680
And then I'll be awake.

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,320
Oh, what the fuck?

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,740
Wait, what?

30
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,620
Wait, what?

31
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,760
Yo!

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,220
Doggy's still half-asleep.

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,080
Holy shit.

34
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,360
No, I'll be awake.

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,540
I'll be okay.

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,860
Take me one game.

37
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,400
Rampart, Newcastle Gibby.

38
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,460
Alright, I'm already have it pre-selected.

39
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,400
What's our team number?

40
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,960
We're five.

41
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,880
We're five.

42
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,660
Nice.

43
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,020
Yo, the stream delay is actually... Oh, God.

44
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,780
It's already starting.

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,300
Oh, God.

46
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,160
Don't worry.

47
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,240
We'll be so fine.

48
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,100
We're so healthy.

49
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,680
Wait, is this already... Oh, my God.

50
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,940
We're fucking in it already?

51
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:34,920
Oh, shit.

52
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,340
Okay.

53
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,980
Oh, we're so healthy.

54
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,540
She says, oh, she's dying.

55
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,640
I need you to wake up right now.

56
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,780
My streamer kit isn't even on yet.

57
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,080
Tell me when the game select is over.

58
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,560
Doggy, unfortunately, you gotta play Newcastle, Doggy.

59
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,440
My bad.

60
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,620
Okay, and you guys... Okay, and I wasn't the one that's awake.

61
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,780
I tried looking for Newcastle.

62
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,120
I couldn't find it.

63
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,920
I couldn't find it.

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,320
I was unprepared.

65
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,700
I was unprepared.

66
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,320
My fault.

67
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,820
Whoa, I had my guy...

68
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,400
Okay, I've actually pre-selected my guy before we went in here.

69
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,620
But I guess... Fuck me, I guess.

70
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,580
Let's go.

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
Doggy, you go loot on my yellow.

72
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,700
Gerard, go loot on red ping.

73
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,680
The fuck is the yellow?

74
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,540
Yellow is... Go here, Doggy.

75
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,800
Loot that and then loot the IMC.

76
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,200
Oh, my God.

77
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,740
Now I have to fucking...

78
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,220
The yellow disappeared.

79
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,060
Is there red ping?

80
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,200
Oh, my God.

81
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,000
All right, now I have to figure...

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Okay, the first key doesn't count that much, guys.

83
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,540
That's all I'm saying.

84
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,860
Yeah, it doesn't count.

85
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,400
It doesn't count.

86
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:52,860
Warm up.

87
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,920
Okay, let's go in live right now.

88
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,660
Okay, I'll do the dogs, I guess.

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
Uh, no, no, no.

90
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,820
Don't do dogs.

91
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,160
Oh, okay, well...

92
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,040
Loot the IMC, like this.

93
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,700
Dogs is northbound.

94
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,480
They might fight us.

95
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,260
Okay.

96
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,460
Goodbye, dogs.

97
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:19,760
Goodbye.

98
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,980
This zone's really rough, I think.

99
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,200
We're going into wall here.

100
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,880
I'll pick you guys up.

101
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,460
We'll have to see where wall goes.

102
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,380
I hear myself.

103
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,340
Okay, that was fucked up.

104
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,020
I heard myself.

105
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,860
Grabbing all my healies, I promise.

106
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,320
I'm doing it right now.

107
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,060
Grabbing a bunch of them.

108
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,820
I learned.

109
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Okay, all right.

110
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,160
So, okay, we're finally live.

111
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,140
Hello, everybody.

112
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,300
Welcome to the stream.

113
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,500
Welcome.

114
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,760
Hello, everybody.

115
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
We're off to a bad start.

116
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,560
Doki just woke up, and she's really dizzy so much.

117
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,300
I woke up, but I was locked in at least.

118
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,540
At least I was locked in.

119
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
Somebody else wasn't locked in at all.

120
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,620
Okay, listen.

121
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,940
No need to throw shade.

122
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,840
Get in the car.

123
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,000
We're getting in the car.

124
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Okay, I have one.

125
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,060
Grab this cache, Doki.

126
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,020
Which one are we right here?

127
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,840
We're going to be zipping up here.

128
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,640
It's going to be really weird.

129
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,720
I need light ammo, if you guys find any.

130
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,080
Is it dangerous using this car?

131
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,880
I don't remember.

132
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,360
Zip up.

133
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,960
Was it left or right for the castle?

134
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,980
It's the shield, cooldown, and speed.

135
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,200
I think it's right.

136
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,580
Switch shield.

137
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,220
Yeah, I got it.

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,480
Okay, I think it's a wall zone, but we have to hit this console here.

139
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,160
Just come walk with me.

140
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,680
We're going left.

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm with you.

142
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,740
I think someone's there.

143
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,280
Walk right.

144
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,060
Right side.

145
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,220
87.

146
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,980
130.

147
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,580
It's fine.

148
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,040
Just walk right.

149
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,540
Just follow the shield if you need to.

150
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,420
I don't have a Q now.

151
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,620
They're setting up at that house.

152
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,500
I think we come play bridge for now.

153
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,760
Someone in the open here.

154
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,280
Running.

155
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,380
I think that's the same team.

156
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,900
There's two guys on this left house, one guy on the right.

157
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,040
Can we try catching this guy on the right?

158
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,280
I'm looking.

159
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,720
The console's up top.

160
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,280
Alright.

161
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm shizzling.

162
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,900
Wait, wait.

163
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,920
Careful, Doki.

164
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm healing inside.

165
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,300
Come out to us, Doki.

166
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,700
Yeah, let me finish healing.

167
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,700
Then I can.

168
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,040
Alright, I'm heading over now.

169
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,540
We want this house on the right.

170
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,680
Can you come up to me, Jerome?

171
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,140
Yeah, you don't need to follow me.

172
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,340
Just follow the flame.

173
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,480
I'm waking up you.

174
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,560
Hit this console, Jerome.

175
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,840
Come run with me.

176
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
Come to me.

177
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,660
Hit it from me.

178
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,480
It's fine, it's fine.

179
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:03,940
Holding!

180
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,420
Don't fail me now!

181
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,980
I'm okay.

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,680
Okay, jump down.

183
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,360
I have no Q, by the way.

184
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,460
We want to fight for this care package here.

185
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,080
Just heal up, Doki.

186
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,920
Okay, I'm okay.

187
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,160
Gibby's going for care pack.

188
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,640
My meds...

189
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,800
We can kill this Gibby here.

190
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,940
It's hard.

191
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,780
It's really hard.

192
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,620
Okay, we're just going to give it up.

193
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,580
Run back here.

194
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,340
My meds situation is bad now.

195
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,980
What do you have?

196
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,340
I have three shield cells left.

197
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,460
I think we do.

198
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,840
I'm going to syringe right here first.

199
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,040
And I'm heading over now.

200
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,420
Just run.

201
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,700
Just do the dugs here.

202
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,520
Yeah.

203
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,040
Hey, there's a bunch of healies here.

204
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,580
I'm okay with white meds.

205
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,400
But I really just need shield cells.

206
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,900
Yeah, we'll get cells from the...

207
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,220
I got two here, if you want.

208
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,520
It's fine, it's fine.

209
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,980
We're doing dugs, so...

210
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,100
Yeah.

211
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,940
We want to fight towards the low ground here.

212
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,520
Careful in case someone shows up on the height.

213
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,300
Very possible.

214
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,690
Oh, there's shield cells here.

215
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,290
I'm good now.

216
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,570
Nice.

217
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,150
Oh, there's more.

218
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,670
Careful in case we get walked up on.

219
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,030
We should be good.

220
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,350
I'm good.

221
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,410
I'm not used to playing Newcastle right now.

222
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,770
After yesterday.

223
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,410
Games.

224
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,550
Don't worry about it.

225
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,410
First game doesn't count.

226
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,370
Yeah, you're right.

227
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,050
First game is just we feed.

228
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,470
Okay.

229
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,890
Yeah, we're just testing the waters.

230
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,870
First game is just feeding, dude.

231
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,970
We're just feeding them?

232
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:04,850
No, no, no.

233
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,710
We're gonna actually do something nice.

234
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,230
Alright, I'm ready.

235
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,390
I'm so over it.

236
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,130
I'm ready, I'm ready.

237
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,670
Uh-oh.

238
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,910
Okay, we're okay now.

239
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,110
Let's just sit here and play for ring three on wall, actually.

240
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,590
Alright.

241
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,450
Let's go back.

242
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,350
Alright.

243
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,870
We wanna take this top left house.

244
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,850
And then check if anyone's still there.

245
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,100
You still get this house for free after everything?

246
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:43,960
Whoa.

247
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,780
We're not in zone.

248
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,220
That's why there's no one here.

249
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,680
Yeah, that makes more sense.

250
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,440
I was like, whoa.

251
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,760
There's literally no one here.

252
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,740
Come with me, Jordan.

253
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,700
Okay.

254
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,080
Should I put a shield?

255
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,000
No, just keep following me.

256
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,180
We're gonna go on top of the bridge again and hit the console.

257
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,220
Okay.

258
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,020
Did it now register or are we gonna do it again?

259
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
No, we're doing it again for ring three.

260
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,260
Okay.

261
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,080
Oh, come on.

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,320
Ping!

263
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,680
Ping!

264
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Oh my fucking god!

265
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,280
Just hold on good and you should be okay.

266
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,060
You don't wanna keep pressing it.

267
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,740
There we go.

268
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,100
There we go.

269
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,180
Just come down.

270
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,080
I have a plan here.

271
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,180
We just need to get to our car.

272
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,120
There is someone there.

273
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,820
We just fight.

274
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,520
He's just sitting on the door.

275
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,140
I'm gonna open it.

276
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,000
Kill this Valkyrie on the left.

277
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,540
Shoot him.

278
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,980
I didn't have an angle for this.

279
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:45,780
120.

280
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,760
He's one.

281
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,520
I don't have an angle here.

282
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm bubbling in.

283
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,020
Can you...

284
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,640
We need to go left here.

285
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,400
Can you wall towards the left, Doki?

286
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,760
Just get a Newcastle wall down.

287
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,800
Nice.

288
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,900
I should be able...

289
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,980
I blocked the grenades.

290
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm bubbling in two seconds.

291
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,600
I died.

292
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,260
Can you res me, Doki?

293
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm resing, but they're heavy pushing now.

294
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,140
They're pushing.

295
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,500
Oh, no.

296
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,180
Oh, no!

297
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,140
That's fine.

298
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,900
First game doesn't matter.

299
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,380
I was uncomfortable with Newcastle there.

300
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,800
Oh, man.

301
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,520
Wait, did they get pushed by another team already?

302
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,460
Wait, what?

303
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,440
There's another team.

304
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,560
Goddamn, they all went.

305
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,640
Oh, my God.

306
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,340
There was a third party instantly.

307
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,360
That's crazy.

308
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,220
That's actually crazy.

309
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,360
Not the ideal situation.

310
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,860
Are you awake now?

311
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:12,420
No, I wasn't used to playing Newcastle after playing six hours of Gibby.

312
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,900
You're right.

313
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,880
That was an intense switch up.

314
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,660
And I was just like, Q.

315
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,700
I was like, alright, here's the Q.

316
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,360
And I was like, oh, wait, I have a fucking actual wall.

317
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,060
Oh, my God.

318
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,440
Well, this is another just chatting session between you and all of us here.

319
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,000
It's okay.

320
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,060
It's just first game never doesn't matter, guys.

321
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,300
It's just first game.

322
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,880
Yeah, now we're gonna be focused after this one.

323
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,240
Now I can actually fix my stream.

324
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,740
Yes, fix it up, please.

325
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,340
But hey, we survived the winning bracket for such a long time.

326
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,960
I guess in the losing bracket we still have a chance, like a great amount of chance, I think.

327
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,440
We literally just need three good games and then we make it through.

328
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,600
Oh, my God.

329
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,340
We just need three good games.

330
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,220
Immediately we fumbled the first one.

331
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,520
Yeah, I mean, that's what happened last time.

332
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,580
That's what happened yesterday.

333
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,460
We just fumbled the first game.

334
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,320
It's fine.

335
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,660
It's fine.

336
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,040
I'm waking up.

337
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,860
I mean, we fumbled, like, the first thing yesterday, too, right?

338
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,140
When we started the tournament.

339
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,960
We're gonna give them false hope that they think they're gonna win.

341
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,080
No, we're gonna win here.

342
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,680
We are the wrong characters.

343
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,100
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

344
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,800
And then I didn't know which way to loot because I was like, okay, this is a new drop spy.

345
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,700
Where the fuck do we go here?

346
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,760
I mean, to be fair, we were kind of late, so it is our fault.

347
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,440
Exactly.

348
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,020
Exactly.

349
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,160
We're gonna make it even more epic by holding up for this mistake.

350
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,320
Everything was against us from the very start.

351
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,080
So it's fine.

352
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,280
Life had to nerf us.

353
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,440
Exactly.

354
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,340
We were just playing too good.

355
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:16,100
As the only full foreign team, like, everything was already against us.

356
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,660
The ping is against us, the POI, everything.

357
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,660
The characters, too.

358
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,820
I'm very surprised you get 300 ping.

359
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,340
I know!

360
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,320
I thought I was gonna have, like, really great ping because I'm really close to Japan.

361
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,560
Yeah, exactly, because I was like, man, I cannot.

362
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,300
I'm in PH, stuff like that.

363
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,960
Like, it's really close.

364
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,420
Yes, that's why I'm like, how do you get 300 ping?

365
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,440
Yeah, I don't know why.

366
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,420
It's probably a routing issue.

367
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,460
Yeah, it's probably a routing issue.

368
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,600
I've never had this thing in, like, whenever I'm playing with the boys.

369
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,920
It's just like, for some reason this has, like, high ping.

370
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,740
I don't know.

371
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,640
Question mark.

372
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,420
I don't know.

373
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,440
You might as well be in fucking NA at this point.

374
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,180
I have the same ping issues as you guys.

375
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,840
I was just like, oh my gosh, at least it's only me that's far away from...

376
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,240
I was like, it's only me that's far away.

377
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,000
And I'm like, wait, you guys all have 300 ping?

378
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,560
For real, though, even with ping issues, even with that, we're still cracking.

379
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:25,640
It's fine.

380
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,580
It's good.

381
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,340
It's alright.

382
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,000
Where are you from, Doki?

383
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,180
NA.

384
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,560
Canada.

385
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,620
Oh, okay.

386
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,380
Why do you think I was like, I'm sleepy.

387
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,620
What time is it at your place of flame?

388
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,340
It is 644 PM.

389
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,160
I'm 744 right here.

390
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,260
I'm 344 AM right now.

391
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,180
I'm fucking, woo, 344!

392
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,180
No!

393
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,900
Let's go!

394
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,260
Wait, what time was it when you were like, uh, yesterday?

395
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
What time was it?

396
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh, no, that was fine.

397
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,260
It was midnight.

398
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,560
It was 12 AM.

399
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,940
Oh, that was, okay, that was fine.

400
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,340
That was fine.

401
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,200
It was midnight.

402
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,060
I don't know.

403
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,200
Midnight is fine.

404
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,560
I'm still awake at midnight.

405
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,400
So, like, when it's midnight, I don't take a nap, because I was like, it's fine.

406
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,920
It's like, midnight can stay up for that.

407
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,860
But then, like, you know, I was like, alright, the match is starting at 330, so I should take a nap.

408
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,580
I should take a nap then.

409
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,780
And I was like, let's go.

410
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,560
I'm waking up at 320.

411
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:38,000
For some reason, though, like, um, whenever it's like 3 AM or 4 AM, I can stay awake from 1 to 2 AM, but once it hits like 3 or 4, I suddenly feel sleepy.

412
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,120
Like, out of nowhere.

413
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,000
12 to 3?

414
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,920
I get really tired if I stay up.

415
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,660
So, I was just like, I also have, like, a convention to do at 930.

416
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,020
So, like, I was like, Alright, after this game, I don't know if I could, I think I could take a nap before the convention.

417
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,960
Oh, what event is that?

418
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,480
It's Halloween Matsuri.

419
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,360
So, like, yeah.

420
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,840
And then I have a meet and greet at 930.

421
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,100
And then I have a panel at 1230.

422
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,780
Hey, just so you guys know, if you want to go there, go there now.

423
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm waking up.

424
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm heading there at 930 AM.

425
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,600
You guys better be there too.

426
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,620
Yeah, shout out to that one.

427
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,460
You gonna sleep through that?

428
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,300
Or are you just...

429
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Post Apex?

430
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,020
Yeah, post Apex.

431
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,360
I was like, alright, I'm ready.

432
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,820
No, I'm trying to take a... I don't know.

433
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,840
Usually it's three hours, so, like, I most likely get to have, like...

434
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,240
We end at 630.

435
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll have, like, a three hour nap, maybe.

436
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,860
Dude, I need you to, like, chug in, like, um, I don't know if you're drinking coffee, but I need you to drink that, like, immediately after this.

437
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,220
Yeah, I'll get some Gamersofts on.

438
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,920
Guys, I have a Gamersofts code, DokiBird.

439
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's, like, 10% off.

440
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,300
Like, use the code DokiBird.

441
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,200
10 % off.

442
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,940
Use the code of Doki in the link in the description below.

443
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,940
I'm not sponsored, though, but she is.

444
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,120
So, uh, go check that out.

445
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,220
Yeah, totally.

446
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,640
Check me out over there.

447
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,840
10% off on Gamersofts, guys.

448
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,600
Works.

449
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,180
I've never actually had, like, um, like, drinks like those.

450
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,960
How tasty is it?

451
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,000
It's actually really good.

452
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,580
It's really good.

453
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,260
Even though I am sponsored by them.

454
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,900
Is it like, um, energy drinks?

455
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,000
Like, um, Gatorade?

456
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,640
Stuff like that?

457
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,380
Yeah, it's like powdered energy drink, basically.

458
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,300
You mix it yourself.

459
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,080
I've never had that.

460
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,820
Just, like, straight-up bottle thing.

461
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,660
Yeah, yeah.

462
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,740
You just, like, mix the powder up with water, and then you fucking chug.

463
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,820
Not chug it, but, like, you know, just drink it.

464
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,480
And it actually works.

465
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,520
Like, the best thing about being sponsored by them is that they always send you free samples, like, all the time.

466
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:34,620
That's nice!

467
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,080
So I literally never have to buy anything.

468
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,560
So I could just, like, use it.

469
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,280
Dude, the only energy thing that I have here that's in powdered form is, like, milk.

470
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,280
I have powdered milk on me.

471
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,340
Oh, no, that's an energy drink.

472
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,620
That's not even... yeah, I was gonna say powdered milk.

473
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,020
Yeah, it's powdered milk!

474
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,340
It's like, uh, this is yummy.

475
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,040
I don't know.

476
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,600
For me, though, it keeps me, like, from getting hungry.

477
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not actually an energy drink, but...

478
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,900
Yeah, it keeps me from getting hungry.

479
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,900
Like, I mix it in with water, and, like, I just drink it.

480
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,560
Yeah, and then I don't feel hungry anymore.

481
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:22,200
Because I... usually I stream for longer hours, so I decide to, like, invest in, like, this powdered milk, because, uh, you know, it tastes great, you know, so, uh...

482
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,440
Yeah.

483
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,920
Sorry, guys!

484
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,100
I'm a milk enjoyer!

485
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,620
I do not drink anything else but water and milk.

486
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
They are really great.

487
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,680
Really great.

488
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,000
Not sponsored, though, by the milk.

489
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,320
Not sponsored by milk, by the way.

490
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
Not sponsored.

491
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,760
Not sponsored by milk, but it's great.

492
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,500
You need to drink milk.

493
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,360
Not sponsored by cows.

494
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,560
Milk is good for you.

495
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,260
Whoever invented cows, yeah, not sponsored by that one.

496
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,820
The company that made cows.

497
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,120
Thank you, Domestication for domesticating cows.

498
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,620
Shoutout to you guys.

499
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,740
Thank you, farms.

500
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,600
Thank you.

501
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,740
Thank you, farmers for doing that.

502
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,680
You're doing an awesome job.

503
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,640
Keeping me alive.

504
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,900
GerardTRexpert.

505
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,080
Domestication, milk was, like, actually undrinkable.

506
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,340
Whoa!

507
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,040
Really?

508
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,660
Yeah.

509
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,640
How undrinkable is it?

510
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,980
Like, you would die or something?

511
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,400
I think, like, there was just so much bacteria from the...

512
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,500
I mean, I could be actively lying to you right now, but I'm spreading misinformation.

513
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,620
I mean...

514
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,780
I mean, things have changed in the past, so, you know...

515
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,380
I could honestly just be lying.

516
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,500
Let's check that out right now, then.

517
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,280
Because it sounds possible.

518
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,040
It's honestly believable.

519
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,180
Like, what you're saying right now is honestly believable.

520
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,840
Like, cows nowadays are probably injected with, like, a bunch of, um...

521
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,940
like, medicine or something?

522
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Yeah, to make it... Well, technically, you're not supposed to drink cow milk, like, off the fucking teats anymore, because, like, you have to, like, actually, like, do stuff to the cows.

523
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,020
Oh, yeah.

524
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,000
Boil them, I think.

525
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:03,780
Like, because I remember, like, technically with all the fucking medication we give cows and stuff, we're not supposed to just drink the cow's milk raw.

526
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,480
We have to actually do stuff to the milk before we can...

527
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,460
Yeah...

528
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,260
Dude, cartoons made me think, like, sucking it out of, like, a cow's teats or something...

529
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,780
will actually work.

530
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,240
Yeah, if you think about it, you're technically sucking milk off the cow boobs, so, like, that's fucked up, Jared.

531
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,100
I mean... I mean, cats do it all the time, so why can't we do it, you know?

532
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,140
I was just like, okay.

533
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,180
You mean, like, every other mammal?

534
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,100
Like, why specifically cats?

535
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,580
Like, every... I mean, because I watched, like, every mammal...

536
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,300
We do that.

537
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,460
Humans do that.

538
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,700
Yeah, you guys, you know what...

539
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,720
Is it a Disney movie where, like, I saw this one specific thing.

540
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,680
I forgot what it was.

541
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,180
I think it was Charlotte's Web or something.

542
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:50,840
Yeah.

543
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,340
I don't know if it was that, but the cats were, like, drinking milk straight from, um, cows or something.

544
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,740
I don't know.

545
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,060
Oh, weird time.

546
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,080
What?

547
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,620
Straight up from a cow?

548
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,960
Yeah, like, uh...

549
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,240
Hey, they were drinking it, like, immediately from... Not straight from a cow, but, you know, from a bucket.

550
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,360
Like, they squeezed it and, like, they were drinking it.

551
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,140
It looked so tasty.

552
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,360
They were just having a fill.

553
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,280
I'll just shut up.

554
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,360
You are digging a deeper hole for yourself right now, Jared.

555
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,480
It's hard to explain!

556
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,800
But when I was a kid, they were having a fun time drinking that milk straight from the bucket.

557
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,380
Like, man, I'm craving for some milk right now because they were like, mm-mm, yummers.

558
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,400
Yummers.

559
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,880
Okay, so your dream right now is to drink cow milk from a cow?

560
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,220
That's not my dream.

561
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,020
That's not my dream.

562
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:52,620
I'm just saying, when I was a kid, they made it so delicious that I thought it was possible to drink it straight from the teat without any processes at all.

563
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,480
Shut the fuck up.

564
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,080
You're half asleep.

565
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,560
You don't know what you're talking about.

566
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,660
Whoa!

567
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,480
No, I definitely know what I'm talking about.

568
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,940
No, you don't.

569
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,780
No, you don't.

570
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,600
Now I'm definitely awake after learning about you.

571
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,340
I think you should take a nap for a bit.

572
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,540
That's, like, a secret that you share.

573
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,620
I think you're still sleepy.

574
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's a secret you share to somebody after, like, knowing them for, like, ten years.

575
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,420
Not, like, right now in the Apex tournament.

576
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,000
In a way, this is what you call, like, a trauma- not a trauma bond.

577
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,960
We're bonding in a moment.

578
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,180
We're building chemistry.

579
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:25,820
Chemistry!

580
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,500
I'm learning something so intimate.

581
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:29,500
What?

582
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,340
This team won the fight?

583
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,280
What the fuck?

584
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,600
That's crazy.

585
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,180
Okay.

586
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,280
I didn't expect- The team we died to has just gone second place.

587
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,100
Yeah!

588
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,640
I didn't expect this team to win that- to get second place.

589
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,740
That was not- that team should not have lived for second place.

590
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,580
Like, that was so stupid from the other team to let that happen.

591
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,300
He managed to run away, play behind a wall, and the other team just killed him.

592
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,980
That's crazy.

593
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,640
Whoa.

594
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,020
Well, that was the first game, everybody.

595
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,040
We already have the winner.

596
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,560
So, it's... yay.

597
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:15,940
Oh, yeah.

598
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:16,780
Pasteurization.

599
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,800
Yeah, that's what I was talking- Oh, I was right.

600
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,540
I wasn't spreading misinformation.

601
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,160
Whoa.

602
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,540
See, it is believable.

603
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,740
Pasteurization.

604
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,660
Let's go.

605
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,860
I got, like, 90% of my information correct.

606
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,400
That's not fair.

607
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,860
Did you get that from school or did you get that from YouTube?

608
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,380
I don't know.

609
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,340
Honestly, I might have just got it from Twitter.

610
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,820
I get most of my news on Twitter anyway.

611
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:47,280
No, I just- If it's important enough to show up on my Twitter feed, that's good enough for me.

612
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,780
Dude, I get mine from Zachty Films or something.

613
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,720
Like, 3D animated reels and Instagram or something.

614
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,600
My 4U algorithm is so fucked up right now.

615
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,980
It's like Marvel Rivals and then- Yeah, I was about to say.

616
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,260
It's literally just that.

617
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:12,180
It's Marvel Rivals and then stuff about me and then news.

618
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,220
That's so random.

619
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,100
It's just something suddenly just news.

620
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,380
I thought it would be, like, fucking brain rot.

621
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,260
Or, yeah, it's like news and memes.

622
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,800
That's basically it.

623
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,440
That's like- Oh, my God.

624
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,840
Yeah, mine's like 90% memes most of the time.

625
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,120
Game 2!

626
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,580
Let's go!

627
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

628
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,780
Now we gotta lock in.

629
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,340
For real.

630
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,960
Exactly.

631
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,160
We weren't last.

632
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,260
Despite everything going against us.

633
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,600
We were 19th place, but it's fine.

634
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,240
Don't worry.

635
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,760
We were one fight away from, like...

636
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,680
One sec.

637
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,400
One fight away from what?

638
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,220
From how many points the team that killed us got.

639
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,700
We're- We're how many points?

640
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,440
We're one fight away from coming second place.

641
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,780
Oh, my God.

642
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,300
Let's fucking go.

643
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:11,900
Woo!

644
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,880
I'm so awake.

645
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,320
So, what does that mean?

646
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,520
Did we do good?

647
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,860
Unfortunately, still no.

648
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,620
I thought there was hope over there.

649
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,500
I thought it was a chance.

650
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,920
Yeah, you could have lied to us and we'll accept it.

651
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,540
I mean, all we have to do now is just keep on believing again.

652
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,640
Yeah.

653
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,800
I agree.

654
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,740
As long as we believe, the chance is always there.

655
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,380
As long as we pick the right characters and also, like...

656
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,680
Okay, okay.

657
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,400
I understand.

658
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,840
No, I wasn't finished.

659
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,720
I wasn't...

660
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,500
Okay, go ahead.

661
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,820
Finish.

662
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:05,560
As long as we pick the right characters and, like, we know how to rotate, things will be great.

663
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,720
Things will be fine.

664
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,480
Whoa.

666
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,720
Okay, all right.

667
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,380
Woo!

668
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,900
Same place?

669
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,220
Same place we're dropping?

670
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,280
Yep.

671
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,500
All right.

672
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,840
Okay, we're...

673
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,040
Okay, lock in characters.

674
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
No, no, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,300
What do you mean, no?

676
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:31,620
What?

677
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,740
Sorry, sorry.

678
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,280
What?

679
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
We're suddenly switching things up?

680
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,860
Listen, I'm also a little bit...

681
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,060
Okay.

682
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,700
You're not the one who fell asleep!

683
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,540
You're not the one that's...

684
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,200
It's 6pm!

685
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,440
For you!

686
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,820
Listen, listen.

687
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,980
I've got no excuses for myself.

688
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,640
Yeah, okay, that's good.

689
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,180
At least you take accountability.

690
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,900
Great, great, great.

691
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,620
We like that about you.

692
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,740
Okay, all right, all right.

693
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,160
I'm so ready.

694
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,380
All right.

695
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,250
Woo!

696
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,690
Okay, now that I know how to loot this place, it should be okay.

697
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,610
Mm-hmm.

698
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,510
Hopefully the zone doesn't pull on us so we can go scan at cascades.

699
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,890
Yeah, hopefully.

700
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,450
Would be nice.

701
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,410
Don't worry, I'm awake now.

702
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,550
For real.

703
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,350
You definitely sound awake.

704
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,650
I believe you.

705
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,890
Thank God.

706
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,170
Enemy was a misspelling.

707
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:46,670
Whoops.

708
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:53,910
I'll pick this carbine for now and just see if there's a carbine in this area.

709
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,390
I got an R-301 here if you guys want.

710
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,830
Yeah, I do need that, but I need to loot this first.

711
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,770
There's a scout here.

712
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,810
Okay, yeah, we're scanning over at cascades.

713
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,430
Do you want that scout or no?

714
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,370
No, I'm okay.

715
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,950
I need a...

716
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,130
I'm gonna stay on nemesis, actually.

717
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,850
There's a blue backpack here.

718
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:31,150
I'm gonna grab the cache and then also grab the carbine.

719
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,030
Alright.

720
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,370
Did you finish looting your area, Jeroid?

721
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,090
I...

722
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:40,510
Shit.

723
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,570
Let me know if I missed anything because I couldn't see any cells.

724
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,130
Whoa, okay.

725
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,950
I was looking!

726
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,650
I was like going back and forth!

727
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,770
I'm looking!

728
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,410
I didn't know what you just said to me.

729
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,210
I'm trying!

730
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,890
I'm trying to find cells!

731
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,310
Whoa.

732
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,590
Is that right?

733
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,050
You don't have much loot there, Jeroid.

734
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,570
Your place is kind of...

735
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,030
Okay, this place is more about rotation.

736
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,850
I know lion's land's here.

737
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,840
Yippee.

738
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,800
Vroom vroom.

739
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,660
Stop here for a second.

740
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,080
I got it.

741
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,680
Let's go again.

742
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,400
I'm here.

743
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,520
We got the cascades here.

744
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,700
Yippee.

745
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,700
Let's hope we don't get shot.

746
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,720
That would be so funny.

747
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,460
Just get ready to bubble the car.

748
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,640
You have to look into the car and then bubble.

749
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,120
Okay, whoops, sorry.

750
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,200
Just hit console here.

751
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,980
Jeroid, come, come, come.

752
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,620
Hit the console.

753
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

754
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,680
Holding.

755
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:52,740
Holding.

756
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,360
Okay, got it.

757
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,480
In the car, beep, beep.

758
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,740
Just look into the car and then bubble.

759
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:05,740
Yeah.

760
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,680
What's the cooldown at?

761
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,220
7 seconds.

762
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,760
Should I test it?

763
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,540
I've never done it before.

764
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,960
It should be okay.

765
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,900
I'm worried I might fuck that up.

766
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,560
Doors are open.

767
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,780
Give me one second.

768
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,460
No, no, no, don't leave.

769
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Come back.

770
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,660
Do it now.

771
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah, I did it.

772
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,820
Okay, all right, inside.

773
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
We're getting off here.

774
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,880
We're just taking this house.

775
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,660
Come, second floor.

776
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,680
Okay, second floor, second floor.

777
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,160
Okay, there's a team on the other house.

778
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,200
We just have to drill here.

779
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,500
Just put walls up.

780
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,240
Put walls on this door too.

781
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,600
And then put a wall here.

782
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,220
This door below us.

783
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,380
If you can.

784
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,180
I'll come with you so you don't get ran at.

785
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,660
All right.

786
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,480
Put it more against the door.

787
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,680
It's not against the door.

788
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,420
Can you come up to me?

789
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,420
Okay, so press Z.

790
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,560
Hold right click.

791
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,800
Aim here.

792
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,600
At this wall.

793
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,640
Oh, wow.

794
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,160
That guy has destroyed me.

795
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,500
Okay, I'm going to replace the wall.

796
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,420
Yeah, just replace the wall.

797
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,340
I need you to break the door with your shield.

798
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,660
Just do it really quick.

799
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,180
Peek.

800
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,160
You don't want to shoot your cover.

801
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,040
You want to uncrouch.

802
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,920
Break the door and then come back.

803
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,220
Okay, that's fine.

804
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,880
Should we wall the stairs?

805
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,340
Or do you want us to wall the doors?

806
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,720
All the doors downstairs.

807
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,120
Uh, yeah, just wall all the doors.

808
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,040
Okay, Dread, come here.

809
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,360
Don't mind walling that yet.

810
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,280
Just wall this door with me.

811
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,580
I'll play with you.

812
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,300
Just wall this.

813
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,740
And then wall this door.

814
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,440
Oh, look here.

815
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,340
Oh my god, okay.

816
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,960
All right, that should be fine now.

817
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,880
We'll be able to...

818
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,080
We'll be fine then now.

819
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,340
One, two, three, four, five.

820
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,780
Okay, you might have to re-wall this.

821
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,600
But don't get hit.

822
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,480
They're bubbled.

823
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,080
Careful.

824
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,000
On the second floor.

825
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,190
I'm four shield cells.

826
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,890
Okay, I'm replacing the shield.

827
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,270
Uh, you can...

828
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,630
Yeah, you have to do that.

829
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,590
He's just getting like...

830
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,830
There's nothing we can do.

831
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,030
Oh my gosh.

832
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,210
I didn't know there was a team already.

833
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,350
All right, I'm three now.

834
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,490
I'll just wait.

835
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:47,890
I'm waiting.

836
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,870
I'm just not peeking.

837
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,890
Uh, what's your heals?

838
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,110
Okay, I'm gonna replace it.

839
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,950
Okay, I'm two, seven.

840
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,970
I'm giving you...

841
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,210
Two cells.

842
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,210
I'm not gonna peek though.

843
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,310
What's your heals, Gerard?

844
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,330
I got, um...

845
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,930
Two syringes and...

846
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,130
Six, um, batteries.

847
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,910
Six batteries?

848
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,130
Oh, okay.

849
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,570
Okay, I was gonna be like...

850
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,670
Give me two cells, Gerard.

851
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,370
I'll give you a bat.

852
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,550
Thank you.

853
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,270
Just be careful peeking that.

854
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,350
Be really careful peeking that.

855
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,370
Oh, they destroyed this door too.

856
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:29,710
Um...

857
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,070
I guess I'll just stay here.

858
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,340
I hear people to my left.

859
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,080
Can you break this door, Gerard?

860
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
With your ulti.

861
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,760
Okay, Sheila?

862
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,820
Yeah, just break this door here.

863
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,560
I hear footsteps to my left, but I don't know how close they are.

864
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,920
Nice, cool.

865
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,260
It'd be nice to peek.

866
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,460
It'd be nice to not be shot by two different teams.

867
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,520
Oh, they're shooting.

868
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,840
Yeah, it's okay.

869
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:08,920
That's fine.

870
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,380
As long as they don't see me, everything will be fine.

871
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,000
They don't know I'm right here.

872
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,080
I think what we have to be most careful of is a team from northwest, guys.

873
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,100
From this house here on my red ping.

874
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,140
Sliding down our bottom door.

875
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Like, our bottom doors.

876
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,540
We have walls right on those doors though, so...

877
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,140
Yeah, but...

878
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,780
They can just bubble and then...

879
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,580
Climb over the walls.

880
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,600
Should I replace this one?

881
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,920
No, I think...

882
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,020
Delete that.

883
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,040
Press X on it.

884
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,940
Do you have to...

885
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,460
Should I come back down to you guys?

886
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,980
Careful with this window, Gerard.

887
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,320
Careful with this window, Gerard.

888
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,460
They have a rampart cover on the other side.

889
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,080
Yeah, he's looking.

890
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,820
He's literally looking.

891
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,760
No, you can stay there.

892
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,040
It's okay.

893
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,600
Alright.

894
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,120
Just take this cover away, Gerard.

895
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,480
I can't...

896
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,400
How do I... Can't remote pick up damaged wall.

897
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,080
Ah, I see.

898
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,360
Okay, you just... You have to slide into it.

899
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,660
And then just press X on it.

900
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,480
And then you come back.

901
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:23,940
Nice.

902
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,460
When you go over this window, Gerard...

903
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,440
You wanna hit a slide jump.

904
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:28,820
No, no, no.

905
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,500
Take it out.

906
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,500
Take it away.

907
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,720
Just get rid of that.

908
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,380
Yeah, it's okay.

909
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,140
Just come to me now.

910
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,320
You don't have to put the wall down.

911
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,240
Just run back.

912
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,100
Slide jump to me.

913
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,100
Nice.

914
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,580
I think you should put the wall down right here, Gerard.

915
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,880
Yeah, that's perfect.

916
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,180
I feel so safe, guys.

917
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,420
You can replace this wall again.

918
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,720
You know what?

919
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,200
If the zone pulls away, there's a good chance we're gonna car and bubble out.

920
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,580
Alright, cool.

921
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,800
Yeah, not last!

922
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,360
Let's go!

923
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,300
That's not us, guys.

924
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,620
That's not us!

925
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,420
There's a team that landed out here, Doki.

926
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,340
Uh-oh, okay.

927
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,940
Okay, where you looking at?

928
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,200
Yeah.

929
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,080
Oh, I might die.

930
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,580
Get inside, get inside.

931
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,380
I'm okay, I'm okay.

932
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,820
You want me to come over to you guys or stay here?

933
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,340
You can stay.

934
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,140
I hear footsteps next to us.

935
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,340
Where?

936
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,740
Like this side, but I don't know if they're close by.

937
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,020
I just heard footsteps right next to me.

938
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,620
I'm gonna turn up my poking gun.

939
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,360
I don't see anything.

940
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,980
They're shooting over this direction.

941
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,800
They're fighting over here.

942
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,640
Yeah.

943
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,560
Oh, that's close.

944
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,700
That's close.

945
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,640
They're right here.

946
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,880
They're getting bullied really hard.

947
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,280
Yeah, fuck you guys.

948
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,180
I think instead of putting the cover here, Gerard, maybe put the cover up on me.

949
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,180
So get rid of this one and then come up to me.

950
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,760
Be really careful coming up because you can die to this really easily.

951
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,900
Just try and run to me right away.

952
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,820
Nice.

953
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,740
Put the wall, I think, just right here.

954
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,440
People are so serious right now.

955
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,100
This lobby is so serious.

956
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,760
Holy shit.

957
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,680
Yeah.

958
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,320
All my homies hate Stormpoint.

959
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,460
Oh.

960
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,400
I hear him.

961
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,440
He might be close.

962
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,600
I think he's underneath.

963
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,260
Yeah, I think so too.

964
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,410
I'm just peeking.

965
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,690
I think he walked out this door.

966
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,310
Yeah.

967
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,090
Oh, shit.

968
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,210
Oh, we're still in zone.

969
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,910
Oh, this is scary.

970
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:54,330
No!

971
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,570
Team, push us, okay?

972
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,470
Be really careful.

973
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,950
I'm just gonna full heal then.

974
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,950
I'm full healing.

975
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,610
Just in case.

976
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,610
Just don't...

977
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,570
Just in case we get pushed.

978
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,100
Oh, I hear.

979
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,900
If we get pushed, we just play towards the stairs, okay Doki?

980
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,640
You're probably gonna bubble stairs and then we might look to make a push.

981
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,660
We just side jump into them.

982
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,280
Uh...

983
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,620
Yeah.

984
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,180
Should I stay here to get ready or no?

985
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,720
Hmm...

986
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,320
Come over now.

987
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,280
Yeah, I think you just come play stairs.

988
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,820
I think if we get pushed, it's likely not gonna be from your side.

989
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,160
We have no covers.

990
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,100
Can you place a cover up here on me, Droid?

991
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Like on my red ping here?

992
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,780
Be careful placing it.

993
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,700
We need presence.

994
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,800
Yeah, that's fine.

995
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,380
Just leave it.

996
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,640
We have one more cover you can place.

997
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,180
Just place it back...

998
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,020
No.

999
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,660
Yeah, you can.

1000
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,400
Come, Droid.

1001
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,460
Place a cover right here, Droid.

1002
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,520
Actually?

1003
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,200
Take this out, Droid.

1004
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,160
Come outside to me, Droid.

1005
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,320
Oh, shit.

1006
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,220
Where do I put it?

1007
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,340
Put it on me.

1008
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,600
Be really careful.

1009
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,180
Come to me.

1010
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,540
Put it right here.

1011
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,160
Right here?

1012
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,360
You can go back inside.

1013
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,340
Be really careful.

1014
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,340
Do you see that window, Droid?

1015
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,400
If you run like that and they're looking through that window, you will die.

1016
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,040
Oh, God.

1017
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:29,540
Okay.

1018
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,560
If you die in the game, you die in real life, so don't let that happen.

1019
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,460
Okay.

1020
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,800
Alright.

1021
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,000
At least not last place.

1022
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,080
If we survive two more placements, we get one point, Droid.

1023
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,920
Alright, let's go.

1024
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,060
Yay!

1025
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,260
We just need two more teams to die.

1026
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,020
Wait, is that true?

1027
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,700
Fifteen places when we get one point, right?

1028
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:56,980
Yeah.

1029
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,280
We need one more team to die, so...

1030
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,940
Come on, guys.

1031
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,720
If we get one point...

1032
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,020
There's a care package out here.

1033
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,640
This team might go first.

1034
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,180
We can bubble car and take it.

1035
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,420
I don't know.

1036
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,780
That's still really risky.

1037
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,800
Team car in here.

1038
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,280
Look at this.

1039
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,120
Coming to us.

1040
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,900
They have red armor.

1041
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,800
They landed right under us.

1042
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,360
You have to look at this.

1043
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,020
I'll come up.

1044
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,860
You maybe wanna...

1045
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,660
Gibby ult this.

1046
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,380
Alright, I'm heading over.

1047
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,080
Gibby ult this?

1048
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,540
I'm gonna try peeking this, okay?

1049
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,540
You guys stay.

1050
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,240
I'll stay in the stairs.

1051
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm staying in the stairs.

1052
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,100
I hit... I didn't hit shields yet.

1053
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,660
I just hit shields.

1054
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,800
Oh shit, we're inside.

1055
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,560
We're in a really good spot.

1056
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,780
I broke the rampart wall.

1057
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,560
Let's go.

1058
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,440
Fourteen.

1059
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,180
This team might try and push us, guys.

1060
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,260
This team is our biggest threat here.

1061
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,780
I broke the rampart wall.

1062
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,020
Can you...

1063
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,840
Can you come up to me, Gerard?

1064
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,440
Okay, I'll stay then.

1065
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,220
I need you to place a rampart cover like...

1066
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,300
Facing this way.

1067
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:11,940
Okay, alright.

1068
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,040
Come crouch exactly on me, Gerard.

1069
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,440
Come to me.

1070
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,160
Don't crouch.

1071
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:15,980
Just come to me.

1072
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,840
Okay, coming.

1073
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,300
Don't crouch.

1074
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,600
Come exactly to me.

1075
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,700
Oh, this...

1076
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,060
We have to...

1077
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,600
We have to make sure they don't walk at us here, guys.

1078
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Okay, this door...

1079
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,860
This wall is gone.

1080
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,640
So just stay...

1081
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,800
Don't put... You don't have enough walls.

1082
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,420
So don't put...

1083
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,480
Don't stand there because they can shoot you here.

1084
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,020
Just stand here.

1085
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,660
Be careful!

1086
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,660
I don't really know what we can do about this.

1087
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
We just gotta fight, I guess.

1088
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,520
We get pushed.

1089
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,840
I can bubble then.

1090
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,780
We can cohabitate and just...

1091
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,740
No, I think we don't fight.

1092
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,360
We just cohabitate and play second floor.

1093
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,860
The problem is they have...

1094
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,040
Red armor.

1095
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,020
All three of them.

1096
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,190
I'm looking upstairs just in case.

1097
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,890
One point, guys!

1098
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:05,890
One point!

1099
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,970
One point!

1100
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:07,530
One point!

1101
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,850
I'm flying in from west.

1102
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,390
I hear... I hear team to my left.

1103
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,430
Team to my north.

1104
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,790
That flew in.

1105
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,120
They landed behind this house.

1106
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,440
Okay, listen.

1107
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,220
There's only one team on this west side.

1108
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,660
Literally the red armor team.

1109
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,260
Yeah.

1110
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,880
We need to find another place to go.

1111
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,200
Oh, shit!

1112
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,480
There's a team here.

1113
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,760
We have to wait a bit.

1114
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,120
I'm looking down the stairs just in case.

1115
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,420
Just be careful of people pushing us.

1116
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,960
I'm just gonna sit against the door for now.

1117
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,640
Shit, it's right behind us.

1118
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,780
I'm sitting against the door for now.

1119
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,830
Try just...

1120
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,350
Sit in the stairs.

1121
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,710
I'm risking my life sitting against the door.

1122
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,570
Someone's sliding over.

1123
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,510
Okay, no.

1124
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,350
I don't hear them.

1125
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,970
We need to...

1126
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,330
Find a spot.

1127
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,940
Well, the fact that no team has died from this small ass circle...

1128
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,060
I think we're moving now, guys.

1129
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:27,700
Can you come to me?

1130
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:27,900
Okay, yeah.

1131
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,160
Run with me.

1132
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,920
Just come to me.

1133
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,140
Run, run.

1134
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,600
Come with me.

1135
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,440
Oh, there's a team here.

1136
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,260
I think we just killed them.

1137
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:38,540
Ready?

1138
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,120
Wait, wait, wait.

1139
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:39,580
Two seconds.

1140
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,160
I'm nading.

1141
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:42,940
Ready?

1142
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,320
Peek this.

1143
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:43,720
Peek this now.

1144
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,120
Peek this now.

1145
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,480
Peek him.

1146
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,280
Push, push, push.

1147
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,060
Flash.

1148
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,600
Two, two, two.

1149
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,380
Last guy.

1150
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:51,620
Flash.

1151
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,340
Got him, got him, got him.

1152
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:52,680
Nice.

1153
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,380
There's a creeper, creeper, creeper.

1154
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,700
Rampart, rampart, rampart.

1155
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,240
There's two creepers, two creepers.

1156
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:00,880
Okay, okay.

1157
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,640
You take one.

1158
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,060
I take the other.

1159
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,560
Okay, okay, okay.

1160
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,080
I'm queuing us.

1161
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:07,340
We're okay.

1162
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:07,620
We're okay.

1163
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,080
Just relax.

1164
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,400
Relax.

1165
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:08,820
That's fine.

1166
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,760
It was one creeper.

1167
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,060
JK.

1168
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,260
Okay.

1169
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,680
It was two.

1170
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,400
Wait, what happened to the boxes?

1171
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,120
We need to hold this side, guys.

1172
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,860
We need to hold this side.

1173
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:23,620
Okay.

1174
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,840
They landed on him.

1175
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,320
I'm looking.

1176
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,440
I'm looking.

1177
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,500
I'm looking.

1178
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:31,940
I'm looking.

1179
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,400
We just have to look at this.

1180
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,200
We just have to look at this.

1181
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,220
I cracked one.

1182
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,300
Nice, nice.

1183
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,920
Just keep looking at that.

1184
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,820
The bubble ends soon.

1185
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,400
It's ending now.

1186
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,480
They're on us.

1187
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,200
Look at this.

1188
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,460
Okay, hold on.

1189
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,340
I'm bubbling.

1190
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,140
Just chill.

1191
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:02,730
There's nades here.

1192
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:03,310
There's nades here.

1193
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,070
Can we peek them now?

1194
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:06,810
Peek them now.

1195
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:08,990
They're fighting.

1196
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,330
They're fighting.

1197
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,790
I got one.

1198
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:13,050
Peek this.

1199
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,870
I'm pushing up with you.

1200
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:16,930
Bottom left.

1201
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,170
On me.

1202
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,230
Push.

1203
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,670
Pull down.

1204
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,970
Go back.

1205
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,170
We stay in our spot.

1206
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:34,950
We have a really good spot.

1207
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,410
We want to go back here.

1208
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,810
I'm back in.

1209
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:42,610
Careful.

1210
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,470
I'm getting massive now.

1211
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,220
Dude.

1212
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,840
Everyone only has an R3.

1213
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,900
We can't let people peek above us.

1214
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,480
Above us is our biggest threat.

1215
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,360
I'm looking above.

1216
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:01,860
I'm against the wall.

1217
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,780
There's a team across us, I think.

1218
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,560
We just...

1219
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,460
Zone literally ends on us.

1220
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,280
There's a team on our bottom here.

1221
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,100
There's a team on our bottom.

1222
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,760
You need to put rampart covers on me, Gerard.

1223
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,000
They're looking to fight us.

1224
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,160
I'm looking.

1225
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,000
They're pushing.

1226
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,180
Just hold.

1227
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,340
Hold on the walls.

1228
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,560
I have to do this.

1229
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,280
I'm healing through this.

1230
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,320
Just hold.

1231
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,460
Give me ult.

1232
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,580
This is my ult, but I'm not getting hit by it.

1233
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,320
I'm gonna get hit by it.

1234
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,380
I'm gonna get hit by my ult.

1235
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:43,560
It's okay.

1236
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,140
We need to kill them here.

1237
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,640
I hit two cracks.

1238
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,520
Let's go.

1239
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,220
Just push.

1240
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:56,980
They're going.

1241
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,400
Knocked one.

1242
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,560
Just keep me.

1243
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,800
You can rez me, Doki.

1244
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,660
I can't see you.

1245
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,220
Just kill him first.

1246
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,440
Nice.

1247
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,720
Down.

1248
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,040
I know.

1249
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:14,680
Block.

1250
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,620
Use your shield.

1251
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,100
Left click.

1252
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,560
We need to go right.

1253
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,260
I know.

1254
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,980
I'm syringing it.

1255
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,320
It's fine.

1256
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,700
Come to me.

1257
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,720
I'm with you.

1258
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,320
No.

1259
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,240
No.

1260
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,660
12 seconds.

1261
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,760
They're looking at us.

1262
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,380
We're dead.

1263
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
Hold shield.

1264
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,080
Keep walking forward.

1265
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,780
I'll hold shield for you.

1266
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,860
I'm holding shield.

1267
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,980
I had to use bubble.

1268
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,260
My bad on the comms there.

1269
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,940
I meant the rez after you kill him.

1270
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,940
I should've been more clear on that.

1271
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,400
We got third.

1272
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,060
We got third place.

1273
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,420
We got a lot of kills for that too.

1274
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:14,680
Nice.

1275
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,960
Great job.

1276
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,380
We should be safe.

1277
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,600
My chat was like...

1278
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,480
His IGL tone is so good.

1279
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,820
You have a fan.

1280
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,780
You have a fan in my chat.

1281
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,700
Subscribe to him and follow him on Twitch.

1282
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,440
We got nine kills off of that.

1283
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,260
That's good.

1284
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,320
We got nine kills.

1285
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:41,900
Nice.

1286
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,980
Great job.

1287
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,200
Great job.

1288
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,340
How many points did that get us?

1289
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:47,780
I don't know.

1290
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,280
How many points did we get from that?

1291
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,180
We got 16.

1292
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,940
That's really good.

1293
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,600
We just need one game.

1294
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,240
Just one game, please.

1295
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,760
Yeah, we just need one game.

1296
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,820
One game, please.

1297
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,400
We should be okay.

1298
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,700
I'm going to use the bathroom and I'll be right back.

1299
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,480
I didn't even wake up.

1300
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,740
I went straight to my PC.

1301
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,140
I didn't want to fucking do anything else.

1302
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,620
I can feel the adrenaline.

1303
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,320
I can feel the high.

1304
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,380
This is it.

1305
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,620
This is it.

1306
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,180
I think I'm going to go through my addiction today.

1307
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,100
What the fuck?

1308
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,460
Literally after yesterday's stream, I was still playing.

1309
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,980
I immediately called my friend.

1310
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,200
We should go rank.

1311
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,580
Let's go rank.

1312
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,200
Let's test this thing out.

1313
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,080
Oh my god, that was so fucking intense.

1314
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,200
I could feel it.

1315
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:37,820
This is it.

1316
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,660
I could feel the dub today.

1317
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,500
I don't know when, but I could feel it.

1318
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,360
It's right here.

1319
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,740
Not jinxing it, but it's right here.

1320
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:48,780
God damn.

1321
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,820
Third place?

1322
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,900
How many more do we need?

1323
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,200
Top fives?

1324
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,180
Top fives or what?

1325
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,300
How good are we talking about?

1326
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,620
One more of a game like that.

1327
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,300
If we get top five, we'll probably need two.

1328
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,040
If we get top three, we'll probably only need one.

1329
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,100
But it depends on the kills we get as well.

1330
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,320
Oh yeah, you're right.

1331
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,640
Getting top three gives you seven points.

1332
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,720
Getting nine kills gives you nine points.

1333
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,840
One kill is one point.

1334
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,420
Just depends.

1335
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,340
Alright.

1336
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,520
I'm back.

1337
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,140
I'm so awake right now.

1338
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,260
I say as I lie.

1339
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,400
Look at that heart pumping.

1340
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,320
Look at my stream on Discord.

1341
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,400
Your stream on Discord?

1342
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,440
What are you doing?

1343
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,400
Is the team that we killed on the rock?

1344
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,020
Yeah.

1345
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:39,920
Okay.

1346
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,400
I'm going to see.

1347
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,760
I was throwing godnades on them.

1348
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:44,540
Yeah!

1349
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,280
Whoa!

1350
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,520
That was insane.

1351
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,440
That was an insane lane.

1352
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,660
Because when I got in, I was like, whoa, they're all dead.

1353
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,140
They're all like one HP.

1354
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,040
I was like, whoa.

1355
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,220
Dude, that was insane.

1356
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,140
Holy crap.

1357
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,940
You just gotta do that ALGS then.

1358
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,260
Yeah.

1359
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,900
I think so.

1360
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,600
I was hitting headshots on people that were like with no HP.

1361
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,740
Yeah, that's crazy.

1362
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,440
He's literally one HP there.

1363
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,280
Holy fuck.

1364
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,600
And then I headshot another guy that's flashed.

1365
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,540
What the heck?

1366
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,860
Thank god you got the Kraber.

1367
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,740
The Kraber wouldn't have helped.

1368
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,540
I was hitting people one HP for 200.

1369
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,000
What is that for?

1370
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,840
We clean it up.

1371
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,800
But if I had another gun, I would have still done that same damage.

1372
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,780
But it won't be as cool.

1373
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,900
No, it won't be as cool though.

1374
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,900
Too bad it only dried and I can see it.

1375
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,280
Guys, it was really cool, guys.

1376
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,680
You should have been there.

1377
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,660
I promise it was cool.

1378
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,720
It was really, really cool.

1379
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,120
Yeah, post it.

1380
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,280
I'll comment on it.

1381
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,180
We'll like and retweet it.

1382
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:16,620
This is how awesome Flame is.

1383
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,980
I don't want to post that.

1384
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,520
I'm down to post the vote review from yesterday.

1385
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,780
Vote review!

1386
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,380
Just immediately silent.

1387
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,220
Wow, I just hyped you up and you do this to me.

1388
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,900
I'm not going to lie, it is embarrassing to have that, but it was actually helpful.

1389
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,140
It was a good Iowa Wizard.

1390
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,260
It was good.

1391
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,000
It hurts, but it's good.

1392
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,120
That was so fucking embarrassing, but okay, you know what?

1393
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,880
I get it.

1394
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,540
We all start from somewhere, Drew.

1395
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,180
When I first started, I was horrible.

1396
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,240
See?

1397
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,140
Thank you, thank you.

1398
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,120
Thank you for reassuring me that we all start from somewhere.

1399
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,160
My first season playing this game, I had a 0.6 KD.

1400
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:07,820
Whoa!

1401
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,500
I'm not alone in my adventure.

1402
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,800
Like, look, listen.

1403
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:21,520
By the next time we team up, or if ever that happens in the future, like, for real, I am going to be way better.

1404
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:22,960
No!

1405
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:25,760
No!

1406
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,540
I won't be teaming up with him.

1407
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,740
I'm going to be facing against him.

1408
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,600
Whoa!

1409
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,480
Oh, that's a challenge right there!

1410
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,300
Oh no, that sucks.

1411
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,580
Yeah, I don't know.

1412
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,380
It's really hard to play the game like this.

1413
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,300
Yeah.

1414
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,840
Just keep an eye out on teams rotating around us.

1415
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,640
Northpat does not know where Zone is going, but Checkpoint does, so if we see Checkpoint anywhere, we want to follow Checkpoint.

1416
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,880
That's really hard, though.

1417
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,040
Wall does not have console, so they don't know where it's going.

1418
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,620
Cascades does console.

1419
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,580
We want to look into these chokes here.

1420
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,040
If someone comes from there, they likely know where Zone is going.

1421
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,500
If someone comes from my yellow ping there, they likely know where Zone is going.

1422
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,720
Nobody else does.

1423
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,800
Alright, let's go!

1424
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:27,720
See, your VOD review was so fresh in your head that you know where Zone is now.

1425
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,100
I think that's just Northpat looking at us in the open.

1426
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,940
Yeah, I see them looking.

1427
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,940
I think our play is to go into Checkpoint and just hit the console.

1428
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,100
I accidentally put shield.

1429
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,440
Sorry.

1430
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,720
I was trying to press tab.

1431
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,120
We get shot at.

1432
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:42,740
It's my bad.

1433
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,280
It's fine.

1434
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,120
It's the first few minutes.

1435
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,900
Nothing can go wrong.

1436
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,180
Yeah, we all want them to know we're here.

1437
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,560
Yeah, just a bright blue moving shield.

1438
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,020
I don't have shield for this.

1439
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,680
We don't shoot them here.

1440
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,520
We just let them go.

1441
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:57,940
We just let them go.

1442
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,480
We're just hitting the console.

1443
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,280
5 seconds.

1444
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:01,820
I have it.

1445
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,400
They're shooting at us.

1446
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,880
Hit this.

1447
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,540
Going.

1448
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,820
Don't use bubble.

1449
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:09,860
I did.

1450
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:10,400
Sorry.

1451
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,660
It was just instinct.

1452
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,120
Get in the car.

1453
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,000
Boom.

1454
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:16,560
There we go.

1455
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,860
We're going into Dump East here.

1456
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,160
13 seconds.

1457
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,240
Oh.

1458
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,180
Okay.

1459
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,760
I have 12 shield cells.

1460
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,440
I have 3 bats, 12 shield cells.

1461
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,000
Do you have bubble?

1462
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:34,500
No.

1463
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,800
Bubble car?

1464
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,740
I got it.

1465
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,360
Use it.

1466
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,500
There's a demon there.

1467
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:43,740
Oh, whoa.

1468
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,580
They're shooting through.

1469
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,580
Come to me.

1470
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,560
This house is good.

1471
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,140
This house is good.

1472
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,380
Come here.

1473
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,980
Come inside and just hold here.

1474
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,940
I'm just closing the door.

1475
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,160
We might get pushed from the left.

1476
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:01,480
Careful.

1477
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,680
Place your walls at all the doors.

1478
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:06,500
Come here, Jordan.

1479
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,980
We can grab this cash here.

1480
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,340
Do you have bubble?

1481
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:13,800
Yes, I do.

1482
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,480
Don't close this door yet.

1483
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,100
Okay.

1484
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,820
There's another door.

1485
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,620
Come here.

1486
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,740
I'm against this door.

1487
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,640
Put your wall here.

1488
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:26,440
Okay.

1489
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,680
Okay.

1490
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,280
Okay.

1491
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,740
We are in God's spot, guys.

1492
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,800
Zone ends on us.

1493
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,160
We have 2 more walls.

1494
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:38,920
Where should we put it?

1495
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,860
Put everything in this here.

1496
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
Put one right here on this entrance.

1497
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,540
Facing this way.

1498
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,540
And then...

1499
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,960
Put one probably...

1500
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,460
This door is not fully closed.

1501
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,240
You have to replace it.

1502
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,840
You have to get rid of this.

1503
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,500
Close the door and then place the wall afterwards.

1504
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,280
Get rid of this door.

1505
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,700
And now close the door.

1506
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:06,820
Okay.

1507
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,000
Come back.

1508
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,140
We just have to fix the wall because we couldn't close the door.

1509
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,920
And then come to me, Jordan.

1510
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,400
Against the door.

1511
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,220
Come to me, Jordan.

1512
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,600
We are going to do this respawn thing.

1513
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,540
Come up to me, Jordan.

1514
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,140
Heal your armor.

1515
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,780
How many heals do you have?

1516
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,240
I have...

1517
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:30,940
10.

1518
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,360
Use 2 right now.

1519
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,400
I'll look at the other door just to be sure.

1520
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,540
Break this.

1521
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,920
Actually, I'll just break it myself.

1522
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,240
Sorry.

1523
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,840
Drop your armor now.

1524
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,960
Okay, dropping my armor.

1525
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:47,560
Yeah.

1526
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,300
Just right-click on the shield core.

1527
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,020
At the bottom, you see your shield.

1528
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,080
And then right-click to drop it.

1529
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,960
Listen, so the plan is...

1530
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,100
You're going to stand outside and die.

1531
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,900
And then I'm going to respawn you.

1532
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,240
And then we get evil points for doing that.

1533
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,200
Just shoot at them if you can.

1534
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,080
Where are they?

1535
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,520
Your guns are really bad for shooting fire.

1536
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,540
So you're probably just going to have to die.

1537
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,260
Be careful with your ammo.

1538
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,300
Should I drop some of them or not?

1539
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,140
No, it's okay.

1540
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,620
So when you get res'd, Gerard, we might get pushed.

1541
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,700
And if we get pushed, I need you to take your armor right away.

1542
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,860
That is the first thing you have to do.

1543
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,680
Now, you can just walk out.

1544
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,340
Die and take the armor here.

1545
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:30,560
There they are.

1546
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,200
You can walk out and start trying to die here.

1547
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,300
No, Gerard, come back!

1548
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,500
Gerard, no!

1549
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:36,940
Come back!

1550
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,020
Well, I'm dead.

1551
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,020
No, you don't have to go up to them!

1552
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,240
Bubble!

1553
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:44,620
Bubble!

1554
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:44,940
Bubble!

1555
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,340
What the...

1556
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,460
Oh my god!

1557
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,540
I don't want Gerard!

1558
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,800
Okay, just...

1559
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,360
I don't think you should make him do this.

1560
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,740
I'll do it.

1561
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,640
I think...

1562
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,020
I'll go up to Gerard.

1563
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,320
No, I don't think it was worth that.

1564
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:00,900
No, it's okay.

1565
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,320
No, you just have to stand next to this door.

1566
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,260
You don't have to go up to them, Gerard!

1567
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh my god, Gerard!

1568
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,820
Oh my god!

1569
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,720
Drop your armor again, Gerard.

1570
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,120
You need to die.

1571
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,100
You need to die on these doors.

1572
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,520
You need to die on these doors, Gerard.

1573
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,220
Okay, on these doors.

1574
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,960
Come back again.

1575
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,440
I don't need to die over here.

1576
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,840
I don't need to charge at them!

1577
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,120
Oh my god!

1578
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,520
Oh my god!

1579
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,000
You are playing on my heart, Gerard.

1580
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,440
Oh my god!

1581
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,700
You said die, and I was okay.

1582
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,020
I'm gonna go right in.

1583
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,440
Oh my god!

1584
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,480
What is that?

1585
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:42,480
It's time!

1586
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,380
You can just keep the door open, Gerard.

1587
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,460
Just keep the door open.

1588
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,220
You don't have time.

1589
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,880
Just keep the door open.

1590
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,640
Okay, come at me!

1591
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,920
You guys have scopes, by the way.

1592
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,000
I do, I do, I do.

1593
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,660
Can I borrow yours?

1594
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,500
Holy crap!

1595
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,420
Just keep...

1596
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,740
Doki, look at the other way for now, yeah?

1597
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,640
Yeah, yeah, I am, I am.

1598
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,260
I'm looking at...

1599
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,160
Hey, hey, hey!

1600
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,200
Guys, I'm over here!

1601
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:10,760
Someone's running!

1602
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,500
Hey, hey, hey!

1603
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:14,900
Oh, another hit!

1604
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,100
Hey, hey, get over here!

1605
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,820
Don't waste too much of your ammo, Gerard.

1606
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:18,480
How much do you have?

1607
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:19,840
110.

1608
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,280
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.

1609
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,920
Just stay there, just show yourself.

1610
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,560
I'm waiting for my chat to...

1611
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,320
I'm jumping, I'm jumping.

1612
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,140
I'm jumping, I'm jumping.

1613
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,760
I'm waiting for my chat to...

1614
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,100
I'm right here, I'm right here.

1615
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,280
I'm waiting to see my chat's reaction to what we just experienced.

1616
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,860
They better...

1617
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,900
Someone clip that shit, please.

1618
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,920
Oh no, from my POV, it was so bad.

1619
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,640
It was so bad.

1620
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,900
When I see, like...

1621
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,940
When I see...

1622
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,660
Okay, I'm down, I'm down.

1623
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,380
Oh my god, that was so bad.

1624
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,860
That was so bad.

1625
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,380
Okay, there.

1626
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,120
Got it, got it, got it.

1627
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:04,540
Okay.

1628
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,920
Do you want me to do it again?

1629
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,180
Do it, Gerard, do it.

1630
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,220
You can drop your armor again, and then do that again.

1631
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,060
Okay, I'm gonna die again?

1632
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:14,660
Yeah, yeah.

1633
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,540
Drop your armor again, drop your armor again.

1634
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,960
Gerard, place a cover, like, on me.

1635
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:20,640
Right on me.

1636
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,360
Come to where I'm sitting.

1637
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,940
Yep, and then face this way, and then just place it that way.

1638
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,840
Yeah, perfect, perfect.

1639
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,080
Come and do that again, Gerard.

1640
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,820
Okay, gotta do it again.

1641
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,040
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1642
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,900
Right here, right here, right here.

1643
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,960
Right here, right here.

1644
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,900
I'm literally right here.

1645
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,780
Hey, hey, hey.

1646
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,180
Hey, hey, hey.

1647
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,680
Hey, hey, hey.

1648
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,120
Oh my god, my VOD caught up!

1649
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,180
Instructions uncleared!

1650
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,060
Just stop moving, Gerard, just stop moving.

1651
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,200
Okay, alright, alright.

1652
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,680
But come a little bit closer again.

1653
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,420
Yeah, you don't want to stay too far for him.

1654
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,200
Okay, I'm right here, right?

1655
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,460
Yep, that's good.

1656
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,100
Oh, here.

1657
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,520
You just need one more hit.

1658
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,500
Shoot it in my head!

1659
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,740
There, here.

1660
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,520
I think now I know why dinosaurs went extinct.

1661
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,640
Because you told me to die!

1662
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:45,660
We thought you understood the instructions very clearly, because I don't think you did!

1663
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,720
I just want you to go outside and try to die!

1664
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,220
Okay, easy enough.

1665
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,440
Go back, Gerard, go back, go back.

1666
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,560
Take your armor and then just heal, okay?

1667
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,640
We can't die anymore, we can't die anymore.

1668
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:00,760
Okay, alright.

1669
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,780
We're still okay, but this team is not.

1670
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,660
They might try and push us.

1671
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,260
Doesn't he need to put a wall against the door, or no?

1672
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,200
Uh, no.

1673
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:13,860
Okay.

1674
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:14,360
It's okay.

1675
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:25,140
Someone's like, LGS is going to feel like a vacation after this.

1676
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,960
Wait, Doki, can you stare at this for a bit?

1677
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,680
Yeah, I can.

1678
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,100
This team needs to move.

1679
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:38,880
I don't know what their plan is, but we have to make sure they don't push us.

1680
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,200
Okay.

1681
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:40,620
I'm looking.

1682
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,260
Oh, Gerard, careful!

1683
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,080
I took bullets, don't worry.

1684
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:44,840
Okay, okay, yes.

1685
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,660
They're pushing up, the Valk pushed up a little.

1686
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,820
Oh, there's a full team up here.

1687
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:50,660
I'm okay.

1688
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,980
They're flying away, they're flying away.

1689
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:55,620
I'm looking at this.

1690
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,100
There's a team to our left that also doesn't have a spot in the zone, guys.

1691
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,060
Team to our left.

1692
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,820
You see who's shooting right now?

1693
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,420
That team doesn't have a spot.

1694
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,000
Aren't they going to go up the... oh, they can.

1695
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:06,700
Yeah, they are, they are.

1696
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,300
They're going up.

1697
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:09,820
Okay.

1698
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,860
We want to play...

1699
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,740
Yeah, we kind of want to play towards the outside here.

1700
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,240
Okay.

1701
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,420
I'm going to get the loot on these bins here.

1702
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,180
Okay.

1703
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,230
And it just went running up the...

1704
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:31,130
There's cells here.

1705
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:32,350
Can you grab this, Doki?

1706
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:33,050
Yeah, I can.

1707
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,930
There's a team underneath as well, okay, be careful with that.

1708
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:38,350
Yep.

1709
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,370
Should I come with you or should I stay?

1710
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,750
You can sort of stay.

1711
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,550
Okay.

1712
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:45,970
Are they flying over us?

1713
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:49,330
Yeah, they're flying over there, I see them.

1714
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,130
Is there...

1715
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,090
Is my energy anywhere?

1716
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:54,230
I don't think I saw energy.

1717
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:55,950
How much energy do you have, Jordan?

1718
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,450
I have energy?

1719
01:04:58,850 --> 01:04:59,150
Yeah.

1720
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,230
Oh, energy ammo here, here, if you want it, take it.

1721
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:03,390
Thank you.

1722
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,230
Can you give me more?

1723
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:05,850
How much do you have?

1724
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,250
Here, take it.

1725
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,410
I'm over here, Jordan.

1726
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,250
We're out of zone here.

1727
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,070
You didn't get in zone?

1728
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:13,770
Yeah, just come left here.

1729
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,350
We kind of want to play outside here.

1730
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:17,170
Oh, God.

1731
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:18,870
We want to play out towards the left.

1732
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,250
There's a team in here we have to be really careful of.

1733
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:24,370
In the building close, and there's a team above.

1734
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:25,950
Should we start putting walls?

1735
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:26,850
He's flying outside, Valkyrie.

1736
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,790
No, I saw his flesh!

1737
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:32,150
Sheila on the door.

1738
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:33,110
That door is fake.

1739
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:33,710
That door is fake.

1740
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,010
I think we just steal the team.

1741
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:37,750
Use your Sheila.

1742
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,070
On the door, only on the door.

1743
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:42,530
Oh, he knocked someone!

1744
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:43,990
Let's go!

1745
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,510
I put bubble.

1746
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:46,730
Push, push, push, push.

1747
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:50,270
Keep me behind you guys.

1748
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:52,190
Drive, please!

1749
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,570
Come back, come back, come back to run.

1750
01:05:59,370 --> 01:05:59,910
Come back to run.

1751
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,150
Oh, my God.

1752
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:05,050
He stood in front of him!

1753
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,090
We might get pushed from top-down beast, guys.

1754
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:10,790
I thirsted him.

1755
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:13,630
Good shit, good shit.

1756
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:14,370
Oh, my God.

1757
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,270
Wall this, we can't drive.

1758
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:19,730
Look over me.

1759
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,230
Look top-down beast for me.

1760
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,710
Be careful looking at it, okay?

1761
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,250
I need a full heal.

1762
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:26,970
Give me a second.

1763
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,870
Drive, look this way.

1764
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:30,950
Look this way.

1765
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:32,870
Okay, where do you want to look?

1766
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,370
We need to walk in towards cannon, I think.

1767
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:36,770
Okay.

1768
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:38,210
We need to kill cannon.

1769
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:40,690
They have shields.

1770
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:45,950
I have zero attachments for my carbine.

1771
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,250
Care the team top-down beast.

1772
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,250
I'm grabbing nades.

1773
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,840
Come up to me, come up to me.

1774
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,260
Come up to me.

1775
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,740
We're playing right on the left side of the cannon.

1776
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,040
Go back, go back.

1777
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,520
We're going car, we're going car.

1778
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:09,860
Come back to me.

1779
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,240
I need you to bubble the car.

1780
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:14,740
Bubble car, bubble car.

1781
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,940
I got the bubble, I got the bubble.

1782
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,280
I'm still getting shot, though.

1783
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,880
Just heal, just heal.

1784
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:23,560
Set up, set up.

1785
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,360
Set walls up.

1786
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:26,860
Set walls up.

1787
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:27,720
Team above.

1788
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,160
They might be gone already.

1789
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,520
Just put walls around.

1790
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,800
Just keep putting walls down, Jordan.

1791
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,520
I got shot from here.

1792
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,440
I don't know where they're at now.

1793
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,460
I think the team above us went here.

1794
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,640
I think the team above us is here.

1795
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,560
I'm looking behind.

1796
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,200
There's a team fight behind us right here.

1797
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:49,880
Look at this, look at this.

1798
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,320
I'm looking.

1799
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,520
There's a team fight to my left.

1800
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,820
There's a huge team fight here.

1801
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,720
I can ult this.

1802
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:57,740
I'm ulting.

1803
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,720
They're dying here.

1804
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,800
I got killed.

1805
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,600
I ulted left side.

1806
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,620
I'm okay.

1807
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,720
We're getting looked at southwest.

1808
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,420
We want to wrap this in here.

1809
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,140
One team is full dead.

1810
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:13,900
There's another team there.

1811
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:15,880
Careful.

1812
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:18,960
I have bubble.

1813
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:19,380
They're fighting.

1814
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:19,440
Can you come?

1815
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:20,340
Alright.

1816
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,620
Do you have Gibraltar ult?

1817
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,040
No, I already used it.

1818
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,120
Go back.

1819
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,980
I had to use it for the first engagement.

1820
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,280
It's okay.

1821
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:32,920
Go back.

1822
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,200
Careful.

1823
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,200
They're going to try and fight us there.

1824
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,360
They're going to try and fight us.

1825
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,840
I'm covering.

1826
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:44,440
You have to put rampart covers.

1827
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,200
This team has to fight us.

1828
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,520
They're going to Gibraltar bubble?

1829
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,620
Yeah, I just bubbled.

1830
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,420
Stay in the bubble if you can.

1831
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,320
We have to just shoot this.

1832
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:00,500
Gibby hit 80.

1833
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,680
They're trying to fight us here.

1834
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:03,800
Bubble faded.

1835
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,580
Let them push.

1836
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:08,500
They're peeking.

1837
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,060
Oh, I got hit.

1838
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:11,780
It's fine.

1839
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:14,880
It's fine.

1840
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,040
And B.

1841
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,640
It was 3.

1842
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,300
5 points.

1843
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:18,720
We're okay.

1844
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,600
Yeah, we got 5 points there.

1845
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,860
Oh, they were so low.

1846
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,060
That Gibby was 1.

1847
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,360
Oh, they got quavered.

1848
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,600
How many points was that?

1849
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,100
I thought the bubble was going to last.

1850
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,520
We got 5 points.

1851
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,540
I thought the bubble was going to last longer than it did.

1852
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,680
It just faded so fast.

1853
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,600
I had the small bubble.

1854
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,060
Yeah, I just got the small bubble.

1855
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,180
Next time, I think you should take the longer bubble.

1856
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,120
The longer bubble?

1857
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:57,420
Okay.

1858
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,520
Because we did small bubble yesterday.

1859
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,000
Yeah, I think so.

1860
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,120
We used to do small bubble when we played Bangalore.

1861
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,300
You just get the bubble back so fast.

1862
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,620
But when you have Newcastle, the longer bubble is better.

1863
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,800
I only realized that after playing scrims with my teammates.

1864
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,260
So do the right side then.

1865
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,120
Yeah.

1866
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,500
What was the other level up then?

1867
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,480
Small bubble and longer bubble.

1868
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,240
Oh, longer bubble?

1869
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:28,520
Okay.

1870
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:33,620
Well, it's now down to 5 squads.

1871
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,740
We got 5 points from that.

1872
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,440
So we just need another game.

1873
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:39,740
And then we should be safe.

1874
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:39,920
Okay.

1875
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,080
Nice, nice, nice.

1876
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,060
So we're not at world's edge now.

1877
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:51,430
So 22 points.

1878
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,290
Are we at 22?

1879
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:54,970
We should be if it's 5.

1880
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,490
I think we're at 21.

1881
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:58,150
21?

1882
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:58,630
Okay.

1883
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:00,250
21 points!

1884
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:05,610
So we're going to need about 10 more points.

1885
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:08,150
But it depends on the lobby.

1886
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:13,090
Like, the winner's record we played, I think the cutoff ended up being around...

1887
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:14,290
I think it was 36.

1888
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,270
Was it 36?

1889
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:17,230
Oh my god, I thought it was...

1890
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:17,390
It depends.

1891
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:22,150
It's like...

1892
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:23,870
Yeah, I don't know.

1893
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:29,310
It just depends how many points the teams above us are soaking.

1894
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,790
But if everyone is like, Oh my god!

1895
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:34,830
168 damage forever!

1896
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:36,410
Did you see that?

1897
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:36,990
Yes!

1898
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:44,030
What the...

1899
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:46,430
That's going to be me one day.

1900
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:47,250
One day.

1901
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,610
You see how fast he does his walls?

1902
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,590
You have to have that type of reaction.

1903
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:53,210
I need to get my game sense.

1904
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:54,630
Oh my god.

1905
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:58,510
Oh my god, decimating them!

1906
01:11:58,870 --> 01:11:59,690
They're on top!

1907
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:03,570
That's going to be me!

1908
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:04,650
That's going to be me!

1909
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:04,930
Oh!

1910
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,170
Look at him go!

1911
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,610
That's going to be you!

1912
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:14,490
Bro, that guy...

1913
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,350
Holy shit, this team is insane.

1914
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:17,510
Oh my...

1915
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,030
That's going to be you!

1916
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,970
Dude, that team...

1917
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,290
Holy shit!

1918
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:26,210
He clutched it!

1919
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:26,910
Who the fuck?

1920
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:28,170
Who is she?

1921
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:31,810
That was insane!

1922
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:33,790
Yo!

1923
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:34,930
Insane!

1924
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,230
You're going to be a new Rampart main right there.

1925
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:39,290
I know!

1926
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:42,350
It's actually kind of making me want to be a Rampart main.

1927
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,070
Holy crap.

1928
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:45,030
Those shields are just so useful.

1929
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:46,630
Holy shit.

1930
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:48,770
Next time, that's going to be me.

1931
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,270
That's going to be you.

1932
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:55,430
Right there.

1933
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:56,690
Better strategy.

1934
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,750
At least we're getting top 10s.

1935
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,590
Continuously.

1936
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,370
That's a good consistency over there.

1937
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,170
Consistent, consistent.

1938
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,170
Now we just need one more, right?

1939
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:08,350
One more top 10.

1940
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:12,450
I think we just need...

1941
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:14,570
At least 10 points, right?

1942
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:16,370
10 points, okay.

1943
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,050
10 points should be okay, but...

1944
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:22,230
We're going to need about 16 points if we want to be fully safe.

1945
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:25,950
Okay, 16 points for fully safe.

1946
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:30,730
That's...

1947
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:32,110
No pressure.

1948
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:32,770
No pressure.

1949
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,190
None at all.

1950
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:35,790
It's okay.

1951
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:42,090
Definitely don't feel that pressure building up now.

1952
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:44,950
It's fine.

1953
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:45,750
We have...

1954
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,730
There's a lot of team with 0 points, so like...

1955
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:51,490
Jesus Christ, a 4th place team?

1956
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:52,710
With...

1957
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,210
That 4th place team with...

1958
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:57,750
With 15 kills right there?

1959
01:13:58,210 --> 01:13:58,670
Jesus!

1960
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,070
What the fuck was...

1961
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,270
Oh, and there's a 14 points there too.

1962
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:03,910
Goddamn.

1963
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,410
Oh, it's Eden's team.

1964
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:07,170
No fucking wonder.

1965
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:10,550
15 and 14.

1966
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:11,070
Damn.

1967
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,990
Yeah, we have 21 points right now.

1968
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:20,710
We're currently 7th place with 3 games.

1969
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,660
No pressure.

1970
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,680
We got this.

1971
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,140
I'm so confident in this.

1972
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,700
What did we get for World's Edge?

1973
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,660
Wait, you never told us.

1974
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,380
Geyser.

1975
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,500
Oh, it's not that bad.

1976
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,360
Yeah, yeah, where's World's Edge?

1977
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,020
We're at your favorite place.

1978
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,500
Where you got lost.

1979
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,820
How did I have that one?

1980
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:51,460
No!

1981
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,700
I don't want to go underground anymore.

1982
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,000
It would be so funny if that was the last.

1983
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,740
It's our new home.

1984
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,520
It's actually our new home.

1985
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,440
It's too late.

1986
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,920
This is where we live now.

1987
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,660
Just underground.

1988
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,140
No, no thank you.

1989
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,640
As long as I stick with you, that would be fine.

1990
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:12,680
Right?

1991
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,300
Because I was very late before and I was very slow.

1992
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,200
I can learn.

1993
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,260
Oh, team 11 is Ditto's team.

1994
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:21,700
I was looking at the wrong number.

1995
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,480
That was the team that killed us, I think.

1996
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,340
7 places the team that killed us.

1997
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:28,660
They got 14 kills there.

1998
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,840
Oh, we can do better.

1999
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,600
Whoa, wait!

2000
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,760
Flame had 0 kills?

2001
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,220
Oh, wait, what?

2002
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,880
Wait, what?

2003
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,500
Someone in my chat was like, Jiraiya got 2 kills and Doki got 1.

2004
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,560
And I looked at the match summary and I was like, overall, 3 kills.

2005
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,960
The dream is coming true.

2006
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,160
Watch out, Flame.

2007
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,520
I'm going to get your ass.

2008
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,200
Whoa, Flame.

2009
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:01,980
Flame, Flame.

2010
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:02,880
Unbelievable.

2011
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,520
Flame, how many kills did you get in the last game?

2012
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:09,380
I think you got like...

2013
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:10,860
Well, last game I got 0.

2014
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,740
The game before that, I think you had 7.

2015
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,040
And I had 2.

2016
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,260
Whoa!

2017
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,960
No, you were cooking that game.

2018
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,560
Goddamn nice.

2019
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,100
Keep doing that, please.

2020
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,240
From now on.

2021
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,080
I need you to lock in again.

2022
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:27,600
It's okay.

2023
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,240
I mean, I feel like we did pretty well for the situation.

2024
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:31,760
For real.

2025
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,580
Am I going to light Jiraiya running all the way out?

2026
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,120
Oh my god, that woke me up.

2027
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,600
That actually woke me up.

2028
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,200
That is a Twitter clip.

2029
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,580
Just die.

2030
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,720
You said die!

2031
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,680
And my brain equated to just running down the slope.

2032
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,460
I wish I knew what team we were fighting.

2033
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:57,780
So I could know what the reaction is to this one guy just running at them with no shields.

2034
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,100
I need to know what team we were fighting.

2035
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,420
In another way, it seemed like we were taunting them.

2036
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,020
From my perspective, I think it was a taunt.

2037
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,680
What the fuck were they thinking of?

2038
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,300
They're running out without a shield?

2039
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,320
Jesus, out in the open?

2040
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,600
Oh my god.

2041
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,880
That was the most stupidest thing I've ever thought of.

2042
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,460
How am I going to get revived?

2043
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:31,000
Because I've never heard of that strategy before.

2044
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,360
No, we were trying to do it yesterday!

2045
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,520
We did it yesterday!

2046
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,160
We did that?

2047
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,320
Yes, we were trying to do that yesterday!

2048
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,720
Because... oh shit, really?

2049
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,400
I didn't notice!

2050
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,620
God damn, I was okay.

2051
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,960
Words were flying out of my ear apparently.

2052
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,780
I did not remember that.

2053
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,340
Maybe we need another VOD review.

2054
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,280
Wait, wait, did I get it right?

2055
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,680
Let me check my...

2056
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,120
Wait, where should I land to loot?

2057
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,100
I think someone needs to loot out here.

2058
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,800
Okay, I'll go there then.

2059
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,700
Out here, into this house.

2060
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,200
Gerard, land on this here.

2061
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,480
Land here, Gerard.

2062
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,480
And then loot into the yellow ping there.

2063
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,240
We just need to loot super fast and then rotate super fast.

2064
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:28,380
Yep, yep, yep.

2065
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,140
I have a redeploy.

2066
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,400
Nice, that's good.

2067
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,360
There's a rez here too.

2068
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,460
Spitfire, oh god, triple take over here.

2069
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:37,700
Yep.

2070
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,280
I'm kind of feeling the lombo this game, I'm not going to lie.

2071
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,740
Okay, I'll ping the triple take then.

2072
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,040
I'll loot the right side.

2073
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,740
Okay, I'm running triple take car.

2074
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,460
Yep.

2075
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,780
Actually, I'll do massive.

2076
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,500
We need to go into monument here.

2077
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,060
Okay.

2078
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,240
You guys can just run up this way.

2079
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,450
I have no scope, so...

2080
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,980
I need to get that massive and then I...

2081
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,040
Just go follow Flame.

2082
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,640
Just follow Flame, you don't have to wait for me.

2083
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,660
Just follow him.

2084
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,800
I just need to grab this.

2085
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,480
You guys can go up as well.

2086
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,700
You want us to go from here?

2087
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:34,180
Gerard, come here.

2088
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,580
You go grab this blue bin.

2089
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,080
Actually no, you just follow Flame.

2090
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,140
I can go up then, because he's closer to you.

2091
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,540
The blue bin's already been grabbed.

2092
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:44,620
Someone's there.

2093
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,300
You can still go, just be really careful.

2094
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,220
We want this cache.

2095
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,840
I'm heading over soon.

2096
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,300
Just make sure there's no one on you.

2097
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,460
I'll wait for you guys near the door and then I'll start going up.

2098
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:55,800
Yep.

2099
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:57,640
Alright.

2100
01:19:58,780 --> 01:19:59,960
Wait, was this looted, Flame?

2101
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,880
No, I looted it.

2102
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,780
Okay, I'm heading up now.

2103
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,580
I have a 3x for someone, does anyone need this?

2104
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,280
I need it, yeah.

2105
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,560
Gerard has a 2x too, but I'll take the 3x actually.

2106
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,260
Here, you want it?

2107
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,740
No, it's fine, just move on.

2108
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,980
You can start sliding down.

2109
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,480
Nope, someone's in front of me here.

2110
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,180
In the house.

2111
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,480
I have an angle.

2112
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,720
He was on this house, I don't know where he's gone.

2113
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,880
I don't know who this is.

2114
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,700
This could be from Overlook.

2115
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,240
Right here, he's crossing right here.

2116
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,400
Yep, I'm looking.

2117
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,700
I think this is Overlook.

2118
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:40,710
Where is he?

2119
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:43,630
I'm taking the house.

2120
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,290
I'm sliding down now.

2121
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,470
We want to go into Monument here.

2122
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:49,850
We want to hit this cache and go Monument.

2123
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:52,890
I'm here.

2124
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:54,090
Yeah, this is Monument.

2125
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:56,210
This is Overlook coming, just go.

2126
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,590
Alright, just follow Flame.

2127
01:20:58,650 --> 01:20:59,410
Follow Flame, Gerard.

2128
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:01,970
Yep, yep, yep, following, following.

2129
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:03,350
Following.

2130
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,490
Following.

2131
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,430
Need to get the zone.

2132
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:11,790
Yeah, the person that hit that blue bin up top, Doki, I think was this guy.

2133
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,790
Literally from Overlook, going all the way up here.

2134
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:15,750
Crazy.

2135
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:20,630
Got four cells and one battery from that house.

2136
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:22,290
I have no bats.

2137
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:24,990
I'm 2-11.

2138
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:26,190
I can give you guys stuff.

2139
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:28,530
I'm just 0-8 right now.

2140
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:32,350
Okay, you don't need bats, Gerard.

2141
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,830
I'll drop you bats later, Gerard.

2142
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:35,110
Just keep going, guys.

2143
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:39,470
If we can get this care package, that would be pretty nice.

2144
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:43,450
We just run for this console here, and then I'll go grab care package.

2145
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:43,770
Alright.

2146
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,910
Whenever you can drop me a 3x, I can take it now.

2147
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,630
I'm literally right behind you.

2148
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:53,050
I'm kind of waiting for Gerard here.

2149
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:53,810
Okay.

2150
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,910
Oh, there's a 2x4, I don't need it, actually.

2151
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:59,190
You don't need it, you can take it back.

2152
01:21:59,190 --> 01:21:59,750
Just go.

2153
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:01,970
On the pack!

2154
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:07,190
Come up here.

2155
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:12,510
Going, going, going.

2156
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,170
Zipping, zipping, zipping.

2157
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:17,870
Okay, do the thing.

2158
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:19,570
I bubbled.

2159
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:21,630
Just scan it, Gerard.

2160
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:25,350
They're also scanning people.

2161
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:26,530
Yeah.

2162
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:27,670
It's fine.

2163
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,390
Come to me.

2164
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:32,730
Jumping, jumping.

2165
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:36,840
Oh, I hear people.

2166
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,200
Huh?

2167
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:39,800
That's me, I think.

2168
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:40,900
Oh, okay.

2169
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,960
Just keep coming to me.

2170
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,040
Yep, yep, yep.

2171
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,260
Cell, battery here.

2172
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:50,960
I'll take it.

2173
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,960
We want to go up to this house.

2174
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:53,920
I'll give it to you.

2175
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,660
We want to go up to that house, guys.

2176
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:58,640
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

2177
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,360
What's that going?

2178
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:01,680
Oh, is someone there?

2179
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:03,240
Someone's there, man.

2180
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,620
We need to go left.

2181
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,260
We need to walk up left here and go into the sky.

2182
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,360
Follow my pathing.

2183
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,180
I'm here, I'm here.

2184
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,800
They have rampart covers.

2185
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,060
Just run, just run, just run.

2186
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:16,800
They're really far.

2187
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,320
We have to be careful behind us.

2188
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,400
You have to pop a battery right here, Gerard.

2189
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,820
Just hold for three seconds.

2190
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:24,860
Oh, you're in the open.

2191
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:25,260
Okay.

2192
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,140
We need to erase this up top.

2193
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,540
In case they're walking at us.

2194
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,280
I'm here.

2195
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,580
I think we're okay.

2196
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,060
Well, they were shooting at us, so they definitely know.

2197
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,100
I think we're okay.

2198
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:42,780
Just keep coming to me.

2199
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,220
We have to walk behind my castle queue, okay?

2200
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:47,600
You guys have to make sure.

2201
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,460
I'm behind it.

2202
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,980
I'm literally right next to you.

2203
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,200
Okay, come.

2204
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,400
Just keep coming, Gerard.

2205
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,480
Get behind this queue.

2206
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,000
Be careful.

2207
01:23:58,460 --> 01:23:59,500
We just go left now, we're okay.

2208
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,800
A lot of shields though, so we need it.

2209
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:10,960
Yep.

2210
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:16,480
Okay, I have a plan.

2211
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:21,140
It's gonna be pretty hard, but we need to play underneath skyhook here.

2212
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,640
We could be getting redded on.

2213
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,120
Coming, coming.

2214
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,400
Oh, we're okay.

2215
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:28,560
Alright.

2216
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:29,820
Just keep coming.

2217
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,560
If you see a sniper stalk, let me know.

2218
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:34,120
Yep.

2219
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:37,400
Oh, they're getting shot at too while they're scanning.

2220
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,280
Just keep running forward to me.

2221
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,980
We're gonna evac from behind this building.

2222
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:45,900
Yep, come right to me.

2223
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,300
Just keep coming.

2224
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,560
Okay, can you throw the evac down?

2225
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:52,280
Here?

2226
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,220
Yep.

2227
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:54,180
Oh, I hear peeps.

2228
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:54,920
Yep, it's fine.

2229
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,600
We're just going right away.

2230
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:59,620
Right off, just click it.

2231
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:01,520
Okay.

2232
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,400
Fly with me here, we go right a bit.

2233
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:07,500
We're landing in the corner left here on my run.

2234
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,440
Yep, land right here on me.

2235
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,240
Ow.

2236
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,140
Bubble.

2237
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,880
I can't, oh my god, it won't let me bubble.

2238
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:17,700
It's fine, I rez him.

2239
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:18,900
Just chill.

2240
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,440
I'm gonna rip Newcastle with you here.

2241
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,380
I think I got pinged there.

2242
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,880
I pressed Q but it wouldn't bubble.

2243
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:27,660
Oh man, that's...

2244
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:28,760
Okay.

2245
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,900
Just keep putting rampart walls on.

2246
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,260
Another one down.

2247
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,300
Put one close on our left here.

2248
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,800
I can't, it's obstructed for some reason.

2249
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,080
Okay, it's okay.

2250
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:41,720
Just crouch here.

2251
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,320
Crouching, popping a battery.

2252
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,520
Yep, you can heal.

2253
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,120
It won't let me.

2254
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:47,860
What's your bubble on?

2255
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:49,620
I have it now, I have it.

2256
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,660
Okay, as soon as we get shot, you just have to use it.

2257
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:54,480
There's a guy in the open here.

2258
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,220
I think that's the team playing the...

2259
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,040
Hey, look, rampart!

2260
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,880
He's behind this car.

2261
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,460
I don't see him.

2262
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:06,940
Yeah.

2263
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:09,560
He's gone.

2264
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,780
Oh, they're shooting.

2265
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:13,040
Just say drop a bubble and then I'll do the bubble.

2266
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,240
Yep.

2267
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:17,980
Hopefully they don't throw a nade.

2268
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:23,730
Whoa.

2269
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:25,430
We should be okay.

2270
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:26,490
Okay.

2271
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:29,110
At least not last place.

2272
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:30,690
Whoa.

2273
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,230
Spooky, scary.

2274
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:37,670
Yeah, I mean, we're just gonna sit here like the whole game pretty much.

2275
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:38,170
It's so spooky and scary.

2276
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:39,930
This is where we live now.

2277
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,010
This is our new home.

2278
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,310
It's free real estate.

2279
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:46,010
I'm making so much noise to make the team above us so paranoid.

2280
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:47,610
Whoa.

2281
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:51,390
This is literally where I'm gonna start my family.

2282
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:52,310
Listen, Gerard.

2283
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:55,670
I need you to put a wall down like this way to show presence.

2284
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:57,330
It's gonna be really scary.

2285
01:26:58,470 --> 01:26:58,890
Outside?

2286
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:01,570
Yeah, so come...

2287
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:03,730
Yeah, I think you just throw a bubble that way.

2288
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:04,130
Okay.

2289
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:06,250
Okay, where do I...

2290
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:08,790
Go, Gerard, go before the bubble goes.

2291
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:10,630
Throw a wall down facing west, Gerard.

2292
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:11,270
Yep, perfect.

2293
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:13,030
Come back, come back now, come back now.

2294
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:13,230
Okay.

2295
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:14,590
Okay.

2296
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:18,890
We're so safe.

2297
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:19,710
Oh, yo.

2298
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,250
That is not good.

2299
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:23,850
I have a lot of shield cells if you need it.

2300
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:25,830
I have 15 cells.

2301
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,590
Okay, nice.

2302
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:29,470
I just wasted everything because I was getting shot everywhere.

2303
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:30,450
Wait, how many cells do you have?

2304
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,590
I have zero.

2305
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:34,230
Oh, no.

2306
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:37,730
Oh, thank you.

2307
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:39,070
Careful of this, careful of this.

2308
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:40,170
Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking.

2309
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:42,510
I have ulti.

2310
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:45,210
I'm gonna save it for when we have to use your bubble.

2311
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:45,730
Okay.

2312
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,690
When you bubble, I'm gonna ulti as well.

2313
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:50,910
Okay, just let me know when to bubble.

2314
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:51,630
I have it now.

2315
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:52,610
Yep.

2316
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:00,070
Man, that's fucked.

2317
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,610
Why would you destroy a house like that?

2318
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:02,970
I know, right?

2319
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:05,130
We're supposed to coexist.

2320
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:06,870
Very uncivilized.

2321
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,110
Yeah, we're here to coexist.

2322
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,010
We're barbarians.

2323
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:14,460
Oh, someone died to a ring.

2324
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,160
I cannot believe what...

2325
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:18,740
Why are you shooting it?

2326
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,880
There was a guy in a window.

2327
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,380
Oh, that guy, okay.

2328
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,480
I shot like between his body and his arm.

2329
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2330
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,080
They got a mythic bin.

2331
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,100
What?

2332
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,020
That sounded so nice.

2333
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,220
Oh, it's basically a red gun.

2334
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,680
Oh, shit.

2335
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:42,900
It is a red gun.

2336
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,040
Someone shoot them, please.

2337
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:48,280
Or damage.

2338
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,140
Guys, I think we're moving.

2339
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:55,880
Oh, okay.

2340
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:56,580
Never mind.

2341
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:57,780
Full team on me.

2342
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:58,040
Come back.

2343
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:02,000
Don't worry, we never moved.

2344
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,760
We never moved.

2345
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,160
He's like, never mind.

2346
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,660
I'm like, oh, I'm still here.

2347
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:09,220
I'm still here.

2348
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,340
Have to be careful if this team has a crab area.

2349
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,640
Yeah, I'm looking.

2350
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,040
I have no idea what guns they have.

2351
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,240
Yo.

2352
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,680
Be careful.

2353
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:24,420
That's okay.

2354
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:27,420
He has so much shield cells right now that he can risk that.

2355
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:29,720
I see nobody.

2356
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,700
Like, I don't know how you're seeing people.

2357
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,440
Oh, that's how...

2358
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,980
I'm jumping for this.

2359
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,120
You guys are scaring me.

2360
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:40,080
Good luck.

2361
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,360
It's fine.

2362
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,780
Just stay there, Gerard.

2363
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,040
You don't need to do anything.

2364
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,440
Yeah, I'm just going to cradle myself here.

2365
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,720
You don't need to do anything.

2366
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:57,160
Because I don't even have a scope that could reach that far.

2367
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,620
Wait, where's your 2x?

2368
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:01,640
Right here.

2369
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,260
I have it.

2370
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:04,140
But I don't think it's going to be...

2371
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:04,760
Oh, on my left.

2372
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,220
Oh!

2373
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:05,960
It's okay.

2374
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:06,360
Just chill.

2375
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,160
I'm covering.

2376
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,980
Do you need white meds or are you good?

2377
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:13,980
I'm okay.

2378
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,680
I got 4 syringes.

2379
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,040
He's fine.

2380
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,180
He's so healthy.

2381
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,060
Please stay healthy.

2382
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,560
I'm looking at the left for you.

2383
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:25,240
Yeah.

2384
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:31,520
Still 18?

2385
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,140
18 again?

2386
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,160
How is he doing that?

2387
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,320
Listen, we maybe make a play here.

2388
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:39,640
Okay.

2389
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:45,300
I was going to say, are you sure there's a lot of people around us?

2390
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,880
Place a wall here again, Gerard.

2391
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:51,380
We can start playing a little bit more aggro forward here.

2392
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:51,820
Okay.

2393
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,000
I'll stay here for now.

2394
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:53,800
Anchor this a bit.

2395
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:55,680
Okay, no.

2396
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:57,360
We're still in a really, really good spot.

2397
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:57,960
We just chill.

2398
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:58,640
Yeah.

2399
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:09,380
There's a spot somewhere here I think that's gonna be playable soon.

2400
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:09,760
Okay.

2401
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,380
I don't know what it looks like though.

2402
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,520
We need to care for this team here.

2403
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,900
This team does not have a spot in zone.

2404
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,780
I'm looking northeast for us.

2405
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:19,960
They're the only team we have to focus, guys.

2406
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,200
Our second biggest threat...

2407
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,020
Can you put a rampart wall down here?

2408
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:25,640
Gerard?

2409
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:27,720
Just right here.

2410
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:28,400
Be careful.

2411
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:30,340
Yep, just come back.

2412
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,900
We just needed to show presence.

2413
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:37,960
Okay.

2414
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,360
This team has to move here.

2415
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:43,000
Yeah, I'm looking for us too.

2416
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,340
They don't have a spot to play.

2417
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,740
This team is going to die.

2418
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:47,620
This team has to walk up to us then.

2419
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,680
Yeah, I don't think we'll be able to get any of the kills.

2420
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:52,500
Yeah.

2421
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:53,920
Well, let's hope.

2422
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:54,480
No, we will!

2423
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,040
We will!

2424
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:55,840
Let's hope.

2425
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,900
I have a peaking gun here.

2426
01:31:58,900 --> 01:31:59,160
I hear this.

2427
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,080
17 seconds.

2428
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:07,680
15 seconds.

2429
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:09,440
People in this zone...

2430
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,920
Nobody dies until the last ring.

2431
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,560
Oh shit, really?

2432
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,760
There's a lot of cover for people that just live in.

2433
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,300
8 million buildings.

2434
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,260
Yeah, that's why...

2435
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,920
The end zone here is really scary.

2436
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:25,420
If only real estate was this free.

2437
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:25,900
IRL.

2438
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:29,740
In this economy.

2439
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,380
I'm looking right side.

2440
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,340
They're not running right.

2441
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:32,720
I think they're running left.

2442
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:35,400
We're getting shot all the way left.

2443
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:35,980
I don't know.

2444
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,940
They definitely ran left.

2445
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:40,060
I think they smoked it.

2446
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,020
I think that's them.

2447
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,700
Okay, our team just took the spot that I wanted to play.

2448
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:50,100
I really want to kill this team above me.

2449
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,560
There's no one to my...

2450
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,660
Yeah, they all ran left.

2451
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,000
I don't see anybody.

2452
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,140
I don't see anybody.

2453
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,270
Guys, I think we should make a play.

2454
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,650
We're going to triple run up to here right now.

2455
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:07,590
Come with me.

2456
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:08,770
Don't slide.

2457
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:09,130
Walk.

2458
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:12,290
Okay, nevermind.

2459
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:13,090
We're not doing anything.

2460
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:14,190
We're playing other side of this wall.

2461
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:17,590
This is our house.

2462
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:18,050
Yay!

2463
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:20,310
This is where we live.

2464
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:23,810
The circle is not anywhere near us.

2465
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:26,570
It's all the way out west.

2466
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:27,570
I think we should just take the risk.

2467
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:27,950
Make the play.

2468
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:28,190
Come.

2469
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:28,770
Run.

2470
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:31,170
I said...

2471
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:33,290
Sit on me for two seconds.

2472
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:35,030
We're going to run up the ramp here.

2473
01:33:35,790 --> 01:33:36,150
Ready?

2474
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,350
One, two, three, come.

2475
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:47,130
They're doing re-deploy from up here.

2476
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:49,090
There's no one in here, I think.

2477
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,470
Come.

2478
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:52,330
Keep wrapping with me.

2479
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:54,110
Do I just follow him?

2480
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:54,570
Just follow him.

2481
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:56,550
Just follow him.

2482
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:56,930
Don't mind me.

2483
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:58,030
There's no one here.

2484
01:33:58,370 --> 01:33:58,950
Fighting under me.

2485
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,370
Right here.

2486
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:01,830
Keep me in the open.

2487
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:02,710
Shooting.

2488
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:04,670
Nice!

2489
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,630
There's someone right below me.

2490
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:09,310
Can we drop on them?

2491
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:10,190
Nope.

2492
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:13,650
There's a team.

2493
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:14,450
Shoot this.

2494
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:16,530
They don't have cover against us.

2495
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:18,590
Flash!

2496
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:19,850
Make the move soon.

2497
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:23,970
One of them is flash.

2498
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:24,030
Flash.

2499
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,040
I have ult.

2500
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:33,800
We need to fight this right now.

2501
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,440
I'm right behind you.

2502
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,500
Come with me.

2503
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:41,640
They're fighting.

2504
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:42,820
Come.

2505
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:45,560
I'm bubbling.

2506
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,080
Chill.

2507
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,320
Just wait.

2508
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:51,640
Got one.

2509
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,860
Peeking now.

2510
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,080
They have to fight.

2511
01:34:59,260 --> 01:34:59,500
Just chill.

2512
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:00,440
Let them fight.

2513
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:01,900
They're in the bubble.

2514
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:10,000
I'm getting shot in the back.

2515
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,180
Wait, that's you.

2516
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:13,540
Bubble.

2517
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:15,540
On me.

2518
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:17,900
Fight.

2519
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:20,140
He's one.

2520
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:21,640
Sit on me.

2521
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:22,600
No, I couldn't.

2522
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,440
No, I trolled, man.

2523
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:27,520
No.

2524
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:30,580
Okay, so the ping was...

2525
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:31,900
Wait, what was your ping then?

2526
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:32,960
Went terribly over there.

2527
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:34,200
No.

2528
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:41,100
Some of the people were traveling and I was aiming randomly because it was clipping.

2529
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,380
I mean, we got five points from that.

2530
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,740
We got five pp.

2531
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:46,500
We got seven points.

2532
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,660
Yeah, that's good.

2533
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,400
Good, good, good.

2534
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,280
Another top ten.

2535
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,160
Oh, that's 28 points.

2536
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:56,080
We just need one more good game.

2537
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:00,320
Man, I could've lived that there.

2538
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,340
I had to heal.

2539
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,600
I was so low.

2540
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,680
I really needed to heal there.

2541
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,180
You can't heal because it's outside of zone.

2542
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,660
Yeah, I noticed.

2543
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:14,520
I was outside of zone when I tried to heal and then I ran to you.

2544
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,400
I didn't realize how fast the zone was against us.

2545
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,460
More trust, Okie.

2546
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:20,180
More trust.

2547
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:22,120
Why do you think I'm telling you to come to me?

2548
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:22,900
More trust.

2549
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,100
If I say jump, you say how high.

2550
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:31,680
Goddamn.

2551
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,200
Hey, I got two kills though.

2552
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,500
I got two kills for that.

2553
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,300
I got 45 damage.

2554
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,980
But I did get my two kills.

2555
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:43,100
I'm not gonna lie to you, Jahan.

2556
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,120
At some point in that fight, I started running back and you just started shooting me.

2557
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,060
Yeah, I shot...

2558
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,000
I shot you once too.

2559
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,360
You were like, there's a guy and I was like, wait.

2560
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:58,900
I shot the first person I saw and it was you.

2561
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,960
Because you like, got me and then I turned around and I just shot anything I see.

2562
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:10,540
To be fair, I like, did no damage in the fight.

2563
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:12,560
I don't know how I was missing.

2564
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,100
But whatever.

2565
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:16,220
That was rough.

2566
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,880
Yeah, it was so rough.

2567
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,660
Jesus Christ.

2568
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:20,240
If we lived that, we would have been...

2569
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,020
Dude, my pay is 269.

2570
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,660
How is this... What?

2571
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:24,840
I think you need it.

2572
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,940
Okay, if we make it to the finals, we play tomorrow.

2573
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:30,760
Oh, damn.

2574
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:31,860
Again?

2575
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,100
We play tomorrow and we make it to the finals.

2576
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:35,880
But you're right.

2577
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,760
I think you might need exit lag.

2578
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,500
Oh, yeah.

2579
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,100
I think you can get...

2580
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:44,260
You can get one month free trial with exit lag.

2581
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:47,520
I might actually need it for the tournament tomorrow.

2582
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:47,600
Yeah.

2583
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:51,640
I'm just thinking, imagine how much...

2584
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:54,340
How well we do if you can actually shoot your gun.

2585
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,320
I don't know.

2586
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:02,460
I just didn't think I'd be getting this much worse like ping on the second day.

2587
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,720
Yesterday was sort of okay, but god damn.

2588
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:06,960
This was terrible.

2589
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,400
Like, I didn't even know who I was shooting at.

2590
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:14,600
Yeah, if you're like... If people are teleporting, that ain't good.

2591
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:16,140
I know.

2592
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:18,040
It's actually pretty bad.

2593
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:23,300
Fine, I might have to like subscribe like literally after this tournament.

2594
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:24,060
God.

2595
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,000
If we make it to the finals.

2596
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,380
If we make it, which we are.

2597
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:29,560
Did you see what he did?

2598
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,520
Dude, just literally shot him straight in the face.

2599
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:38,700
No, the downed guy blocked the other guy from climbing over the wall.

2600
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,220
That's crazy.

2601
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:45,000
He literally body blocked him from climbing the wall.

2602
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:49,520
Dude, I thought it was like a Mufasa kind of thing.

2603
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,040
He was just looking at him in my point of view.

2604
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,080
Damn.

2605
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:56,360
Okay, at least it was another top 10.

2606
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,080
Great.

2607
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,160
Great job, everybody.

2608
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:03,520
So far we're not like straying from the consistency.

2609
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,520
Yeah, we're very consistent today.

2610
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,600
That's good.

2611
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:09,240
We're very consistent.

2612
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,880
But we're getting further and further away from the top 10.

2613
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:14,320
Literally at the second round we were like third.

2614
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,420
Now we're like how much?

2615
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,760
How far were we?

2616
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:17,460
We're eighth.

2617
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,140
Last game we were eighth too.

2618
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:23,340
Oh my god, please, please.

2619
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,700
We need to at least another top 10.

2620
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:29,420
Yeah, we just need another decent game and we should be locked in.

2621
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:31,820
I don't even know what the cutoff is right now.

2622
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:32,600
To be fair.

2623
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,000
I have no idea what the cutoff is.

2624
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:37,540
They haven't posted it.

2625
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,460
Oh, I'll wait the...

2626
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,900
Oh wait, we have the scoreboard.

2627
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,940
It's already updated, yeah.

2628
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,780
We're at 28 points.

2629
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:47,820
Cutoff is at 24.

2630
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:48,860
There's two more games.

2631
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:49,880
Oh my god, that's scary.

2632
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,400
Cutoff is going to be high 30 again here.

2633
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,560
Unless someone chokes.

2634
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:56,360
So we're at 28.

2635
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:56,980
We'll see.

2636
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:03,540
We need like 12 more points here in the next two games.

2637
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:05,740
We're one good game and we're okay.

2638
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,400
12, that's...

2639
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,680
Oh wait, we're at 28.

2640
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:13,720
Nevermind, we don't need 12.

2641
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:14,220
I'm stupid.

2642
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,600
Yeah, I was going to say 12.

2643
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,320
I thought we were so close to 30.

2644
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,040
We need 8 to 10.

2645
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:20,840
We need 8 to 10.

2646
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:21,900
Alright.

2647
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,200
We should be okay.

2648
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,060
Flame says die.

2649
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,060
Gerard asks how many times.

2650
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:41,840
If it means winning, yes.

2651
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,920
You Jetters are brutal.

2652
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:45,880
They're always brutal against me.

2653
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:46,940
For some reason.

2654
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:52,060
So Gerard got the opposite of trust issue.

2655
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:59,680
I fully trust whatever this Flame gives to me.

2656
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,400
I will do it for this team.

2657
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,520
Oh my god.

2658
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:11,680
Right there, if we chilled a little bit and let the two teams fight, I think they would have won.

2659
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:16,220
I saw them and I was like How did you just pre-shoot?

2660
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:18,420
The pressure was on us, really.

2661
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:20,140
We couldn't really think.

2662
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:21,420
I just wanted to get those kills too.

2663
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:26,840
I called to push at the start because I didn't see anyone.

2664
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:29,660
Turns out there was a full team ratting in the corner with the Rampart.

2665
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,140
We would never know.

2666
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,980
There were just three men sitting in the corner.

2667
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:38,360
For me, I was just like I could get all these kill points.

2668
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,420
They're not looking at us.

2669
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:43,700
I was like That's so juicy.

2670
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,060
Right there.

2671
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,420
Game start soon.

2672
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:51,360
We got this.

2673
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,660
Okay, thank god.

2674
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:54,320
Well, at least I'm not getting kicked out.

2675
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:59,520
You didn't get kicked out from the lobby.

2676
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:03,440
Yeah, and we're not restarting and resetting the map every single time.

2677
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,060
Yeah, today's a good day.

2678
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:08,700
The only bad thing that happened today is that Everything is way worse.

2679
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,360
It's not even better.

2680
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:16,620
I'd rather get disconnected than fucking missing every shot or like just shooting at the flame.

2681
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,540
At least you didn't.

2682
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,980
We don't have to restart the game.

2683
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,060
You're right.

2684
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,800
At least we don't have to restart the game.

2685
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:27,880
It's the little things in life.

2686
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:29,220
Yeah.

2687
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:30,480
Enjoy those things.

2688
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,820
Are we really going to ignore the first thing that happened?

2689
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:33,460
Yes.

2690
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,260
The first game.

2691
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:38,760
We were not human on the first game.

2692
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,080
We were not real people there.

2693
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:44,920
Yeah, we were just warming up.

2694
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,380
We were so scuffed.

2695
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,600
I wasn't a real person at that time.

2696
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,940
Yeah, specifically you only.

2697
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:55,180
You just literally woke up from your slumber.

2698
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,180
It's okay.

2699
01:42:56,420 --> 01:43:02,360
You're the one who's just woken up from a slumber.

2700
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:03,320
What?

2701
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:06,320
I cannot even speak.

2702
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:09,200
English is your second language, right?

2703
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:10,760
It is.

2704
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:12,880
I'm the one that's cooked today.

2705
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,400
I actually...

2706
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,300
No, you're IGL.

2707
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,440
You can't be cooked.

2708
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:19,800
I don't know what to tell you.

2709
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:21,500
I have a G7 scouter if you need it.

2710
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:24,280
Whoa, these are the same guns as before.

2711
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:24,800
What the hell?

2712
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,020
I need a triple take though.

2713
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,480
I need large guns.

2714
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,140
I don't feel confident with G7.

2715
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:42,380
I used to be good with G7 and then they nerfed it a little.

2716
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:46,680
Then they removed the scope for it and then I was like JK, nevermind.

2717
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:52,240
Oh, Gerard, you were not supposed to be there.

2718
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,080
Where is he?

2719
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,840
You have to go the other way.

2720
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,060
There's a longbow here.

2721
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:03,540
I haven't found any shield cells yet.

2722
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:13,720
Let me know if you find a triple take or a scope.

2723
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:15,160
Yep.

2724
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,200
Preferably what scope do you want?

2725
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:19,440
2 or 3x.

2726
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:21,580
2 or 3x, yeah.

2727
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:23,620
And a triple take.

2728
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:24,740
We want to just leave here.

2729
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:25,680
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

2730
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:28,620
Do you want me to come with you or go up the mountain?

2731
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,000
No, we're going to the lava siphon.

2732
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,820
I'll craft something.

2733
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:42,840
We want to hit this cache in the blue bin and then go hit the console at the lava siphon.

2734
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,400
We want to go fast here.

2735
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,280
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

2736
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,020
Let's hit this geyser.

2737
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:53,720
Oh, crap.

2738
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:55,980
Go, go, go.

2739
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:56,500
No crafting.

2740
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,720
Ah, shit.

2741
01:44:58,780 --> 01:44:59,060
No time.

2742
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,820
Go, go, go.

2743
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:02,400
It's okay, I'm with you.

2744
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,600
I believe in you.

2745
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:09,600
When you're at these redeploys, remember to look up and then look down.

2746
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,620
Look as high as you can so you can fly further.

2747
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,140
That's how we are able to fly far.

2748
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:18,900
Looks like we're in the next ring.

2749
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,060
Alright, alright.

2750
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:22,180
I'm here.

2751
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:23,620
We're here.

2752
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:29,140
We want to just hit the blue bin here and then... oh, someone grabbed that?

2753
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,200
I grabbed it but I don't need it.

2754
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:34,840
None of us need it.

2755
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:38,380
Hey, I heard listen to IGL, okay?

2756
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,440
That's what I heard.

2757
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:45,740
Alright, we need to just hit this blue bin, go down, grab cache and then go down.

2758
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:47,100
If you guys find more shield cells, let me know.

2759
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:51,180
I only had... I only found four in my...

2760
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:51,840
Oh, I did not.

2761
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:52,700
Yeah, same.

2762
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:53,940
Four and one battery.

2763
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,100
Start running guys.

2764
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:56,300
I'm here right behind you.

2765
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,180
Oh, there's a care pack here.

2766
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,180
We could've played for that.

2767
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,560
Oh, it's not down yet.

2768
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:04,100
We can play for it.

2769
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:04,460
Come.

2770
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:08,220
Behind you.

2771
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,500
Oh, I found a scope.

2772
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,140
I'm fine.

2773
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:17,460
Alright, let's go guys.

2774
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:17,540
Behind you.

2775
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,440
Oh, there's a triple take.

2776
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,400
I got a two or three scope if you want.

2777
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,420
I got a triple take.

2778
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:23,760
It's fine.

2779
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,480
Someone might be here.

2780
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:28,940
We might have to fight.

2781
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,260
Climb your roof.

2782
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:38,540
I can bubble it whenever.

2783
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,160
I'll wait here.

2784
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,340
I'll look at the roof.

2785
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,060
There's a hemlock here.

2786
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,420
I'll take the hemlock.

2787
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:47,920
I'm gonna grab the cache.

2788
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,920
Alright, let's go hit this balloon.

2789
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,780
I don't know if it was you guys or I heard some sliding.

2790
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:56,380
Oh, wait.

2791
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:56,980
Battery's here.

2792
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:57,740
It's fine.

2793
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:58,360
I'm good.

2794
01:46:58,660 --> 01:46:59,200
I need shields.

2795
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,680
Just come over.

2796
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,480
Let's break this.

2797
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,460
Oh, man.

2798
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,940
I have 300 ping.

2799
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,580
Oh, no.

2800
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:09,800
So far, my ping is 75.

2801
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:10,840
What?

2802
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:12,180
Okay.

2803
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:16,000
So far, keep it that way.

2804
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:16,860
Don't go any higher.

2805
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:17,320
75?

2806
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:17,820
Oh, my god.

2807
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:20,380
No wonder you're teleporting with rides to 300.

2808
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,640
Go hit this console, guys.

2809
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:25,440
Console drive?

2810
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,400
Just land here.

2811
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:27,040
Just land on this.

2812
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:28,640
You have to bubble him.

2813
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,160
Yeah, just do this.

2814
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:31,060
I'll be right behind you.

2815
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,340
There's a team here.

2816
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,280
I got the bubble.

2817
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:39,860
Okay.

2818
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:39,980
Okay.

2819
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:40,820
Got it.

2820
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,900
I'm here with you.

2821
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:47,140
Okay.

2822
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:52,810
I think we just go ahead and vault here, guys.

2823
01:47:53,150 --> 01:47:53,470
Come to me.

2824
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:54,210
Yep.

2825
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:57,070
Going, going, going.

2826
01:47:58,750 --> 01:47:59,610
Do you see a 2x4?

2827
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:00,050
Let me know.

2828
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:01,710
Oh,

2829
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:08,960
my god.

2830
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,140
Don't get lost.

2831
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:14,640
Just look at the map.

2832
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,640
There we go.

2833
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:26,930
Could be people here.

2834
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:27,790
Have to be a bit careful.

2835
01:48:28,050 --> 01:48:29,670
Am I gunned out, just in case?

2836
01:48:30,430 --> 01:48:30,610
Yep.

2837
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:34,450
I think we're okay.

2838
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:35,670
Cool.

2839
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:39,010
Nice.

2840
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:39,610
We have a cache.

2841
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:40,370
You can grab this.

2842
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:42,430
Alright.

2843
01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:43,190
I'll grab the cache.

2844
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:46,010
It's on the left.

2845
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:49,210
Got it.

2846
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:50,730
Let's go.

2847
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:51,110
Backpack.

2848
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:53,690
On me.

2849
01:48:54,370 --> 01:48:55,010
Oh, fuck.

2850
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:57,230
Ow, ow, ow.

2851
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:58,150
Son of a bitch.

2852
01:48:58,350 --> 01:48:58,950
It's fine.

2853
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:00,750
Mirage is stuck behind this.

2854
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:01,590
Look at him.

2855
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:03,050
Okay, I'm looking.

2856
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:05,430
I hit him.

2857
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:05,690
70.

2858
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:07,950
His teammates are on the left.

2859
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:08,890
I cracked one.

2860
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:12,010
I cracked Mirage again.

2861
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:13,250
Just leave it.

2862
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:13,770
Come back.

2863
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:14,630
Come back.

2864
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:16,410
Go zone.

2865
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:16,810
Go zone.

2866
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:19,150
I'm gunna die.

2867
01:49:19,330 --> 01:49:19,610
Oh, fuck.

2868
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:20,210
Just run.

2869
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,230
Just run.

2870
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:25,510
I'll look for him.

2871
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,490
Just run.

2872
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:28,310
Don't pause.

2873
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:29,470
Running.

2874
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:33,030
Just heal.

2875
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:33,410
Just heal.

2876
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:36,810
Oh, you're in the open.

2877
01:49:37,690 --> 01:49:39,410
He's in the open while healing.

2878
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:40,550
Medkit.

2879
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:41,590
Medkit, medkit, medkit.

2880
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:42,310
Just come over here.

2881
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:45,610
We're gunna hit the console here in Typhon.

2882
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:46,490
Okay.

2883
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:48,830
Actually, let's go launch site.

2884
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:51,130
Follow the ping here.

2885
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:52,790
Just follow here.

2886
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:55,430
We might have to fight here.

2887
01:49:56,010 --> 01:49:56,690
I think it's okay.

2888
01:49:58,410 --> 01:49:59,310
Come with us.

2889
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:01,010
Come, come, come.

2890
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:02,670
Yep, yep, yep.

2891
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:06,150
I'm gunna wait here on the ramp.

2892
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:06,630
I'm gunna look for Gerard.

2893
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:09,630
Alright.

2894
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:12,690
We're gunna look to try and 3-2-1 someone, okay?

2895
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:13,130
Okay.

2896
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:14,850
I'm peeking now.

2897
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:20,470
Just keep walking with me.

2898
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:22,890
No sliding?

2899
01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:23,790
I think no one's here.

2900
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:26,030
Oh, no, it's fine.

2901
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:26,550
We can slide.

2902
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:27,590
Come off of there.

2903
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:28,210
Alright.

2904
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:32,510
Gerard, do you need to hit this console again?

2905
01:50:33,090 --> 01:50:34,050
Go in zone, go in zone.

2906
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:34,990
Go in zone.

2907
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:35,310
I'm looking for it.

2908
01:50:36,670 --> 01:50:37,350
Go in zone.

2909
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:39,250
Right here, right here.

2910
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:41,130
Just go in zone and hit it.

2911
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:42,650
We'll keep watch.

2912
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:47,350
We're gunna hit an evac over at the left here.

2913
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:50,730
Okay, yep.

2914
01:50:51,390 --> 01:50:51,970
Just come with me.

2915
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:00,820
You can just full heal with syringes, Gerard.

2916
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:01,780
Yep.

2917
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:04,940
More syringes here.

2918
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:06,720
You can take it if you need it.

2919
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:07,740
Okay.

2920
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,280
I think we just walk into this building.

2921
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:18,660
Okay.

2922
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:20,520
Move here?

2923
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:22,780
We're just walking left here.

2924
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:27,780
Yeah, there's people in there.

2925
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:28,680
Okay.

2926
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,140
Just keep walking with me.

2927
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:33,920
Go left here, don't slide.

2928
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:34,660
Yeah.

2929
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:36,860
Just crouch here on me.

2930
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,280
When they fight, we third party.

2931
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:41,580
Wait.

2932
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:43,800
Just wait a bit, wait a bit.

2933
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,260
Yep.

2934
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:48,820
Okay, get close, get close.

2935
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:49,780
Don't slide, don't slide, don't slide.

2936
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:50,140
Okay.

2937
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,760
Side now, side now, side now.

2938
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:54,960
He finished, he finished the fight.

2939
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:55,640
Get in, get in, get in.

2940
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:58,820
Okay, all dead.

2941
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:00,080
Nice!

2942
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:02,320
This is one guy left.

2943
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,940
Start putting walls up, start putting walls down.

2944
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:07,660
You can.

2945
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:08,980
Yep, yep.

2946
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,340
Ow, ow, god, ow.

2947
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,720
Owie, that hurt.

2948
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:16,720
It's fine, we have a lot of meds here, so...

2949
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,960
Oh, shit, that's fine, whatever.

2950
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:19,880
I don't care, we have so much meds.

2951
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:22,620
There's an ultic cell in here.

2952
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Oh, shit, you're right.

2953
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,460
Okay, we want to control this whole area.

2954
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:30,220
Okay.

2955
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:33,720
Here, I'm dropping the shield, I'm dropping the health right here, so you guys can know.

2956
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:35,720
We have to be a little bit careful, someone might...

2957
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:38,060
Wait, wait, put a wall in this door, put a wall in this door.

2958
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:39,860
Dread, Dread, Dread, come here, come here, put a wall in this door.

2959
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:40,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2960
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,480
Should I close it?

2961
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:44,580
Yeah, yeah, close it, and then put a wall right here.

2962
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,300
Someone might come from the place we've just...

2963
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I put a wall there.

2964
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:50,260
Here, I open the door for you.

2965
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,540
Yeah, and then put a wall right here again.

2966
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:54,340
Where, where?

2967
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:55,240
No, no, you're fine.

2968
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:57,180
Okay, redo this door, redo this.

2969
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:58,240
Dread, come here.

2970
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:02,060
I think instead of placing the walls inside, you should place the walls outside.

2971
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:02,940
I think we have to...

2972
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:03,220
Okay.

2973
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:05,540
The outside here to hold teams up.

2974
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,400
So, where should he post it, place it in?

2975
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,140
You can place it, like, on the roof.

2976
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:11,320
Okay.

2977
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,740
On the roof above you here.

2978
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:13,960
Wait, wait, redo this.

2979
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,780
It's a bit hard to get there.

2980
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:17,760
Yeah, you can climb from the doors.

2981
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:18,680
Okay.

2982
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,980
Um, I think you gotta teach him, I don't know which, how to place it.

2983
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:25,240
Uh...

2984
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,320
It's a bit hard, but...

2985
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,140
You guys wanna play above the roof here.

2986
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,340
Okay.

2987
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:34,100
Either above the roof or on that rock.

2988
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:35,100
Okay, Dread, come here.

2989
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:37,860
Um...

2990
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:39,580
Maybe the rock is probably easier to play.

2991
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:41,180
Alright, come with me.

2992
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:44,460
You climb this, and then you place a wall here.

2993
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,480
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2994
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,600
That's fine, that's fine.

2995
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:53,940
Is this a good wall?

2996
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,320
Bro.

2997
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:00,810
I'm doing double...

2998
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:01,950
Sheila.

2999
01:54:02,610 --> 01:54:03,410
Oh, shit.

3000
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:05,350
It's fine, it's fine, I'm okay.

3001
01:54:06,430 --> 01:54:08,130
We have, like I said, we have so many shields.

3002
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:09,410
I don't really...

3003
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:11,030
I'm just gonna start putting...

3004
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:12,070
They're landing on us, landing on you guys!

3005
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:14,590
They're coming under!

3006
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:18,210
I'm coming.

3007
01:54:18,690 --> 01:54:20,530
I need help, I need help right now.

3008
01:54:22,610 --> 01:54:23,430
Oh my god.

3009
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:24,850
I got naded, I got double naded.

3010
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:25,610
Oh, fuck.

3011
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:28,430
I think you gotta play for your life.

3012
01:54:29,030 --> 01:54:30,010
You gotta play for your life.

3013
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:31,870
They're all outside, I'm coming around.

3014
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:33,030
Play above, play above.

3015
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:34,370
Play back, play back.

3016
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:38,490
Play back, come back, come back.

3017
01:54:38,590 --> 01:54:39,330
They're coming to us.

3018
01:54:40,170 --> 01:54:41,030
Come here, come here.

3019
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:42,430
Move back, move back, move back.

3020
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:44,330
Oh my god.

3021
01:54:44,450 --> 01:54:45,250
Nice, keep moving to me.

3022
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:46,470
It's fine, it's fine.

3023
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:50,330
I couldn't get inside, what the fuck!

3024
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:51,210
81.

3025
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:52,610
100 to 40.

3026
01:54:53,850 --> 01:54:55,270
I'm shield, I'm throwing nades.

3027
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:56,270
Yep.

3028
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:59,670
Can you break the rampart wall?

3029
01:54:59,790 --> 01:55:00,310
I have so many nades.

3030
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:02,410
Okay, okay, I'm trying to break.

3031
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,160
All the...

3032
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,500
48 on the Gibby.

3033
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:10,840
Yep.

3034
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:12,580
I can...

3035
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:13,700
I don't know.

3036
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:15,180
What should we do here?

3037
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:17,600
Back up, back up, back up.

3038
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:19,680
We have a respawn beacon right outside.

3039
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:20,460
Come to me.

3040
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:21,460
I'm right behind you.

3041
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:22,880
I used all my nades.

3042
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,920
You need to bubble the...

3043
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:25,720
Oh, frick.

3044
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:26,480
No, no, no, no.

3045
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:28,480
Hold, just hold, just hold.

3046
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:28,900
Okay.

3047
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:33,140
Do you have any syringes?

3048
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:33,860
Yes.

3049
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:36,380
They're pushing us, pushing us.

3050
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:37,040
Outside.

3051
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:39,840
Mirage close.

3052
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,000
No, I couldn't.

3053
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:43,580
No!

3054
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:46,960
Did we get kills for that?

3055
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,120
Oh, we got one kill, nice.

3056
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,260
At least we got two points.

3057
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:50,620
Oh, God.

3058
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:51,780
That puts us at 30.

3059
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:53,860
I don't know how much more we'll need.

3060
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,740
We need one more good game.

3061
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,320
I couldn't...

3062
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,980
I got nade spammed out.

3063
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:02,360
Oh, God.

3064
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:04,980
I was literally stuck in my shield.

3065
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,140
I could not get over.

3066
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:09,380
I was trying to hop, but it won't let me.

3067
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:10,280
That's so unfortunate.

3068
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,480
Oh, that was the team that fought us earlier, too.

3069
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:13,260
In the tunnels.

3070
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:16,360
The only team running Mirage.

3071
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:20,400
I got nade spammed, so my back was fucked over by nades.

3072
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,840
And my front was half-minded.

3073
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,360
Yeah, they were just chucking it in.

3074
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,920
And then there was a Mirage behind us, too.

3075
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,760
So I literally couldn't go anywhere.

3076
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:29,080
Yeah.

3077
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:33,000
I feel like I could have put a bubble, but it's just such a...

3078
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,360
We were pinched hard.

3079
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:38,180
Oh, my God.

3080
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:44,250
Oh, wait, another team fucking rolled up.

3081
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:45,890
Yeah.

3082
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:48,210
I think it's the team from the left house.

3083
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:49,590
They just pushed.

3084
01:56:50,210 --> 01:56:51,930
How could we have played that differently there?

3085
01:56:53,690 --> 01:56:54,450
Uh, honestly...

3086
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:57,310
Just, like, not taking too much space.

3087
01:56:57,910 --> 01:56:58,630
We just, like...

3088
01:56:58,630 --> 01:57:01,710
If we're all three at the house you were at, I think we're okay there.

3089
01:57:01,870 --> 01:57:02,610
Oh, I see.

3090
01:57:03,110 --> 01:57:03,490
Yeah.

3091
01:57:03,790 --> 01:57:05,350
So, in, like...

3092
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:08,690
If I'm playing, like, with my team, we would, like, try and hold everything.

3093
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:09,390
But it's, like...

3094
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:10,810
It is really hard to do it.

3095
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:11,970
Yeah, yeah.

3096
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:12,170
Yeah.

3097
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:20,550
Oh, they won the fight for this house.

3098
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:23,790
Yeah, they took it.

3099
01:57:23,930 --> 01:57:24,610
Our house.

3100
01:57:24,690 --> 01:57:27,550
I heard that Mirage is, like, the number one Mirage in Japan.

3101
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:28,950
Is he?

3102
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:31,530
Yeah, that's why he only plays Mirage.

3103
01:57:32,730 --> 01:57:33,850
At least it wasn't a shit Mirage.

3104
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:35,630
I don't know if he's the number one Mirage in the world.

3105
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:38,070
But, like, I know he's the number one Mirage in Japan.

3106
01:57:38,490 --> 01:57:40,430
Like, he literally only plays Mirage.

3107
01:57:41,230 --> 01:57:42,350
In every tournament.

3108
01:57:42,650 --> 01:57:44,810
I feel honored being killed by...

3109
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:46,370
By the number one Mirage?

3110
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:48,550
Yeah, by the number one Mirage.

3111
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:50,350
At least it wasn't, like, a shit one.

3112
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:50,830
Thank you.

3113
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:55,210
I mean, in this tournament, there's, like, a lot of really, really good things.

3114
01:57:56,750 --> 01:57:58,170
But the number one in Japan.

3115
01:57:58,470 --> 01:57:59,210
Holy crap.

3116
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:01,450
Number one.

3117
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:04,510
You gotta feel some sort of dignity from that death.

3118
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:08,530
Alright, one last game.

3119
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:10,090
One last game?

3120
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:10,370
Really?

3121
01:58:10,570 --> 01:58:10,830
Yeah.

3122
01:58:10,830 --> 01:58:12,630
Next game is the last one.

3123
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:13,370
The next one.

3124
01:58:13,570 --> 01:58:16,210
We need to do really good then.

3125
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:18,170
No pressure or anything.

3126
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:19,090
No pressure.

3127
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:20,650
No pressure.

3128
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:24,750
How good are we supposed to be in the next one?

3129
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:26,810
I think we need, like, five points, right?

3130
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:27,790
To secure it.

3131
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:29,710
We're at 30 now.

3132
01:58:30,490 --> 01:58:31,770
How do we get five points?

3133
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:32,730
Five kills.

3134
01:58:34,210 --> 01:58:35,490
Five kills, five points.

3135
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:36,250
Okay, alright.

3136
01:58:37,050 --> 01:58:37,950
Gotcha, gotcha.

3137
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:38,910
Five points.

3138
01:58:40,490 --> 01:58:41,190
Hell yeah, baby.

3139
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:42,890
We're gonna go for that 5k.

3140
01:58:43,090 --> 01:58:44,370
I'm gonna eat some bread.

3141
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:45,990
I didn't have dinner last night.

3142
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:48,090
Oh yeah, you just literally woke up.

3143
01:58:48,150 --> 01:58:49,990
You didn't even have fucking breakfast yet.

3144
01:58:51,270 --> 01:58:52,430
Eat, eat, eat.

3145
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:54,290
Okay, now we know why we lost.

3146
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:55,170
Because you didn't eat.

3147
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:56,990
I wasn't hungry at all.

3148
01:58:58,550 --> 01:59:01,270
Your brain doesn't want to think that.

3149
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:03,490
Just eat, eat.

3150
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:05,690
Your brain's tricking you.

3151
01:59:06,410 --> 01:59:08,790
Your brain needs sustenance.

3152
01:59:08,930 --> 01:59:09,330
Nutrition.

3153
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:11,350
Yeah.

3154
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:12,990
Just eat something.

3155
01:59:13,350 --> 01:59:14,510
Do you have anything over there?

3156
01:59:14,690 --> 01:59:15,970
I'm literally eating right now.

3157
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:19,330
Oh, you're eating right now.

3158
01:59:20,150 --> 01:59:21,650
I'm literally eating right now.

3159
01:59:23,670 --> 01:59:24,590
Good stuff.

3160
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:25,750
Maybe I should just let go.

3161
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:27,570
Oh my god, we were at Godspot?

3162
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:31,450
Yeah, oh my god.

3163
01:59:31,610 --> 01:59:32,370
We were at Godspot.

3164
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:34,850
Yeah, it's literally...

3165
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:36,710
Dude, we set up so much here.

3166
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:38,270
The death boxes were a lot.

3167
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:39,630
No!

3168
01:59:40,370 --> 01:59:41,290
We had like a...

3169
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:43,830
We got like a slew of fucking health packs.

3170
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:45,010
And we just...

3171
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:46,770
Aw man, we lost it.

3172
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,830
I'm sorry, it happens.

3173
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:51,550
Welcome to Apex Legends, where it's RNG.

3174
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:53,910
Yeah.

3175
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:56,550
And we never even knew this was going to be at Godspot.

3176
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:58,690
No, I'm pretty sure Flame knew.

3177
01:59:59,410 --> 02:00:00,370
I'm pretty sure...

3178
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:02,130
I'm pretty sure...

3179
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:03,570
GL knew.

3180
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:09,150
I thought it was going to end closer to middle tree, but I knew our spot was going to be really good.

3181
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:14,010
The only thing that makes our spot potentially bad is we don't know which side it's going to go.

3182
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:18,170
And it's like if we can have everything, then like...

3183
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:19,170
We don't need a...

3184
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:22,530
Jesus Christ, this Mirage is freaking crazy, holy shit.

3185
02:00:23,150 --> 02:00:25,150
Jesus, he's been sending in clones left and right.

3186
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:26,590
He is psychotic.

3187
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:29,130
I mean, he plays Mirage.

3188
02:00:30,210 --> 02:00:32,530
For a one trick.

3189
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:38,470
Of all the characters to one trick, he chose Mirage.

3190
02:00:40,130 --> 02:00:41,230
So he's already a little...

3191
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:43,210
He's already wild.

3192
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:44,130
That is a big nightmare.

3193
02:00:44,910 --> 02:00:46,450
I wouldn't know who I'm hitting.

3194
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:48,190
That's a lot.

3195
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:55,150
Because I know like back in the early seasons, when you died to a Mirage, people were so mad.

3196
02:00:56,390 --> 02:00:56,910
Why?

3197
02:00:56,910 --> 02:00:59,990
Because back then Mirage was known as the worst character.

3198
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:00,970
In Apex.

3199
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:04,170
So you died to him, people were just really fucking mad.

3200
02:01:04,230 --> 02:01:05,930
Because you're like, I can't believe I died to a Mirage.

3201
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:10,170
So the fact that he chose Mirage to one trick is like a lot.

3202
02:01:12,110 --> 02:01:12,510
Jesus.

3203
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:16,330
At one point, I was like the number one Mirage in Canada.

3204
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:18,910
Because I knew how mad people would get when you play Mirage.

3205
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:24,990
Because I was like, I just want to make people angry to die to me.

3206
02:01:26,190 --> 02:01:28,150
I mean, he looks pretty fun to use.

3207
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:29,530
Like his ult especially.

3208
02:01:30,330 --> 02:01:31,870
Like in panic situations.

3209
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:34,830
This is them fixing Mirage.

3210
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:36,070
To make him a better character.

3211
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:39,690
Because back then, his abilities were so dog shit.

3212
02:01:39,810 --> 02:01:41,070
There was like no reason to play him.

3213
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:42,390
What was his ult back then?

3214
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:46,290
His ult was the clones thing.

3215
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:48,710
But you don't go invisible at first.

3216
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:51,190
You just spawn a lot of clones around you.

3217
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:53,110
And you can't control the clones.

3218
02:01:53,170 --> 02:01:54,310
So it was useless.

3219
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:56,390
Yeah, you can't control the clones at all.

3220
02:01:57,210 --> 02:01:58,190
It was so bad.

3221
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:00,270
I only used the clones.

3222
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:02,570
To do finishers on people.

3223
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:14,250
I had the dancing emote.

3224
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:17,990
So it looks like I back up dancers while I do a finisher.

3225
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:21,750
That's the only reason why I used it.

3226
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:23,290
Because his ult was so bad.

3227
02:02:23,430 --> 02:02:24,450
What else do I use it for?

3228
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:27,950
What else do I use his ult for?

3229
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:37,150
This could have been us.

3230
02:02:38,230 --> 02:02:39,570
Top 3, this could have been us.

3231
02:02:39,570 --> 02:02:42,530
If we killed them in tunnel, they wouldn't have done anything to us.

3232
02:02:44,790 --> 02:02:46,210
I almost got one.

3233
02:02:46,270 --> 02:02:47,830
I cracked two of them too in tunnel.

3234
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:50,130
I cracked the Mirage.

3235
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:51,790
And then I cracked them again.

3236
02:02:51,790 --> 02:02:53,070
And then I cracked them again.

3237
02:02:53,170 --> 02:02:56,610
And then I'm like, this guy is just sitting on my friend grenades.

3238
02:02:56,730 --> 02:02:59,510
I feel like his teammates are going to be the ones that are good.

3239
02:03:06,090 --> 02:03:07,490
Now you know.

3240
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:08,890
Now you know.

3241
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:11,330
He's just walking out of zone.

3242
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:13,630
I told you he's fucking wild.

3243
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:15,230
He's wild.

3244
02:03:17,810 --> 02:03:18,930
You look so cool.

3245
02:03:19,410 --> 02:03:21,250
At least he looked really cool.

3246
02:03:21,510 --> 02:03:22,110
My losing streak to Mirage continues.

3247
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:23,810
That's 5 out of 5 now.

3248
02:03:25,050 --> 02:03:26,010
Game over.

3249
02:03:29,490 --> 02:03:31,830
I'm waiting for the scores to get updated.

3250
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:35,990
To see what the cutoff is.

3251
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:38,810
It's going to be really close, I feel like, the cutoff.

3252
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:41,650
Everybody is literally only a few points away.

3253
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:47,580
Oh my god, I'm refreshing.

3254
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,440
Come on, give us the details.

3255
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,820
Someone's like, playing Mirage in a tournament is already psychotic.

3256
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,000
Bro, this guy, he only plays Mirage in every tournament.

3257
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:01,280
In the last 3 years I've seen him, he's just been Mirage.

3258
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:02,540
Wow.

3259
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:04,240
You recognize his name?

3260
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:04,840
No, I do.

3261
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:09,640
No, he's literally the only Mirage one trick that gets invited to all these tournaments.

3262
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:10,920
So that's why I always know him.

3263
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:13,820
Like, in the JP tournaments.

3264
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:17,880
He literally is the only Mirage one trick that gets invited to all of these tournaments.

3265
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,800
So, you know exactly who he is.

3266
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:21,200
God.

3267
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:24,020
I have bad news, guys.

3268
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:24,700
What?

3269
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:28,620
I mean, there's 4 teams on 30 points.

3270
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,380
Oh no!

3271
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,800
I mean, okay, so...

3272
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:36,940
We need to tiebreak then.

3273
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:39,240
No, we need one good game.

3274
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:40,600
We need points.

3275
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,020
How good?

3276
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:42,720
It depends.

3277
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:52,360
But it's possible, like, if the 3 teams at 30 points all get like 10 point games, we could get like 9 points and still lose, you know?

3278
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:52,820
Yeah.

3279
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:55,000
This is scary.

3280
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:56,080
Holy shit.

3281
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:58,900
This is a really high...

3282
02:04:58,900 --> 02:04:59,340
Yeah.

3283
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:01,860
So many points are like in the middle.

3284
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,540
This is really...

3285
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:06,240
We just have to have a good endgame.

3286
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:14,220
Everyone down to 18th place, if they come top 3, they'll take over as well.

3287
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:14,840
Yeah.

3288
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,900
So if we have a bad game here, it's over.

3289
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:20,860
Oh my god.

3290
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:21,420
No pressure.

3291
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:24,660
No pressure, guys.

3292
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,500
It's gonna be fine.

3293
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:30,600
Okay.

3294
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:31,260
Alright.

3295
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:33,860
I'm gonna focus 100%.

3296
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:36,840
I was holding back the entire time.

3297
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:37,820
Oh, I know.

3298
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:48,100
Okay, this time.

3299
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:49,160
This time, this time.

3300
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:50,480
Alright, alright, alright.

3301
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:55,010
Okay.

3302
02:05:58,610 --> 02:05:59,070
Oh.

3303
02:05:59,710 --> 02:06:01,170
Oh, we're starting the server.

3304
02:06:02,350 --> 02:06:02,810
Yeah.

3305
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:04,950
Wow.

3306
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:11,080
Wowee.

3307
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:22,560
It's just too bad all the names are in Japanese, because then I could do recognize team names to be like, that team died, so we have a chance.

3308
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,180
I can't.

3309
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:25,700
I can't figure it out.

3310
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:30,440
Alright, here we are.

3311
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:32,420
Our last chance, everybody.

3312
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:33,620
The last chance.

3313
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:36,680
This is such a high average, though.

3314
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:37,720
Like a high cutoff.

3315
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:41,000
I was not expecting the cutoff to be this high.

3316
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:44,120
30 points.

3317
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:47,160
It's like our first round, it wasn't that high.

3318
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:51,040
All the points went towards the top 5 teams.

3319
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,000
But everyone's doing well.

3320
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:56,280
Yeah.

3321
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,340
All we have to do is believe!

3322
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:02,160
We got this.

3323
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,580
It's time to believe.

3324
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:04,980
We got this!

3325
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:06,400
Wow.

3326
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,820
We made it to elimination round 2, so that's already pretty good.

3327
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:12,320
Yeah.

3328
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:18,530
We fought well.

3329
02:07:19,810 --> 02:07:21,510
Alright, let's go, guys.

3330
02:07:22,390 --> 02:07:23,410
We're your first charity major?

3331
02:07:23,410 --> 02:07:25,010
We did really well.

3332
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:27,050
Thank you.

3333
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:31,830
I think you're the only Hall of Stars member in elimination round 2.

3334
02:07:31,910 --> 02:07:33,470
Oh my god.

3335
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:34,530
That is cool.

3336
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:36,670
Which is kind of scary to think about.

3337
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:38,750
So like, you did really well.

3338
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:40,610
I might actually get addicted to this one.

3339
02:07:41,150 --> 02:07:45,690
I thought you were gonna say your senpai is gonna beat your ass or something.

3340
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:49,370
I'm afraid of getting addicted and also that.

3341
02:07:50,010 --> 02:07:50,930
You don't know.

3342
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:53,910
Like, literally.

3343
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:56,250
Oh my god.

3344
02:07:56,530 --> 02:07:59,430
Our Kohai went to the finals.

3345
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:01,050
We didn't know that.

3346
02:08:02,330 --> 02:08:03,870
There's a Ult Excel here?

3347
02:08:04,210 --> 02:08:04,770
Expectations.

3348
02:08:05,690 --> 02:08:07,270
They made it through winner's bracket?

3349
02:08:08,910 --> 02:08:09,470
Whoa.

3350
02:08:10,670 --> 02:08:11,270
Wait, what?

3351
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:12,170
Oh my god.

3352
02:08:14,670 --> 02:08:17,350
I need a backpack if anyone finds one.

3353
02:08:18,270 --> 02:08:18,670
Yep.

3354
02:08:19,890 --> 02:08:22,450
I have not come across a fucking shield.

3355
02:08:24,350 --> 02:08:25,570
I only have two.

3356
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:27,970
We're just going to here.

3357
02:08:28,490 --> 02:08:30,670
You guys can go up the hill again.

3358
02:08:32,110 --> 02:08:33,110
Yeah, go up the blue bin.

3359
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:34,170
Both of you guys go up the hill.

3360
02:08:34,350 --> 02:08:35,830
Yeah, I'm crafting and then I'll go up.

3361
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:41,750
I have zero backpacks so I'm a little concerned about that for me.

3362
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:44,190
This is a bit rough as well.

3363
02:08:44,670 --> 02:08:46,570
Might have to go all the way up the center.

3364
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:47,470
There's a cache.

3365
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:47,830
Wait.

3366
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:48,770
There's a cache in front of me.

3367
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:51,290
No, we can't grab that.

3368
02:08:51,410 --> 02:08:52,230
That's too far.

3369
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:00,180
Dread, we need you with me.

3370
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:02,740
Should I grab the blue bin?

3371
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:03,960
I'm worried I'm going to get shot at.

3372
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:07,860
You have to be careful of Siphon because Siphon might come to you.

3373
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:08,440
I don't know.

3374
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,460
I can go now.

3375
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:13,940
But if I get down I might meet somebody.

3376
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:15,500
Just go.

3377
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:17,880
I'm literally full sending it now.

3378
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:21,360
If you die, we can craft you somewhere.

3379
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:23,280
Dread, don't follow me.

3380
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:24,200
Just be careful of Siphon.

3381
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:25,580
You don't need to follow me.

3382
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:28,600
Just follow.

3383
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:29,420
Go where Flame is.

3384
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:30,200
Go where Flame is.

3385
02:09:30,580 --> 02:09:31,880
Going down.

3386
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:34,380
There's someone ballooning here from Overlook.

3387
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:36,680
He jumped off.

3388
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:37,680
I'm coming over.

3389
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:40,680
Oh no.

3390
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:42,220
Oh no.

3391
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:44,160
Grabbing this cache.

3392
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:46,100
I'm with you.

3393
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:48,240
They're hitting the balloon now.

3394
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:49,260
I'm shooting the last guy.

3395
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:53,680
It's a little bit hard now.

3396
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:58,100
I have no stock on my flatline so I can't participate.

3397
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:00,520
They're flying at us.

3398
02:10:00,580 --> 02:10:01,520
They're going to fight us.

3399
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:02,040
Get the high ground.

3400
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:03,320
Climb up the roof.

3401
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:06,140
I'm on it.

3402
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:06,640
No.

3403
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:11,400
I'm coming.

3404
02:10:12,940 --> 02:10:14,120
I'm on the roof.

3405
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:18,520
I'm throwing a nade on them.

3406
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:20,420
They're getting shot.

3407
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:21,840
They're going to drop down here.

3408
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:23,220
I cracked on hard.

3409
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:26,100
Careful.

3410
02:10:26,420 --> 02:10:26,890
You're by yourself.

3411
02:10:27,260 --> 02:10:27,580
One HP.

3412
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:29,340
One HP.

3413
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:32,140
No.

3414
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:33,000
I'm here.

3415
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:35,120
They're all low.

3416
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,020
I'm climbing outside.

3417
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:43,000
No, we can't.

3418
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:43,980
I'm backing up.

3419
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:45,600
They're pushing.

3420
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:49,500
We have to back out.

3421
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:52,540
We're getting pushed by four different teams.

3422
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:54,600
You have to live.

3423
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:56,420
You have to play for life.

3424
02:10:58,280 --> 02:10:59,760
There's no team.

3425
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:00,520
You have to play for life.

3426
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:03,300
They're running for you.

3427
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:05,020
Right here.

3428
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:06,220
Right here.

3429
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:08,660
We are dead.

3430
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:20,150
I can't believe the other team pushed us.

3431
02:11:21,010 --> 02:11:21,990
It's unfortunate.

3432
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:23,790
There's four teams.

3433
02:11:24,070 --> 02:11:26,950
Three teams showed up.

3434
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:32,470
I don't know who this team that ran at me is but they threw their game trying to kill me.

3435
02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:33,970
They lived though.

3436
02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:35,070
Yeah.

3437
02:11:36,090 --> 02:11:39,390
They eliminated the strongest people in the game really early.

3438
02:11:39,570 --> 02:11:40,330
I understand.

3439
02:11:41,330 --> 02:11:45,270
The Valk was 10 HP and the Newcastle was like...

3440
02:11:45,710 --> 02:11:48,670
Yeah, I was on the roof so I couldn't push with you.

3441
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:49,770
Yeah.

3442
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:54,950
I think we would have got through it if we won that fight.

3443
02:11:56,290 --> 02:11:58,310
The zone might be on us.

3444
02:11:58,490 --> 02:11:59,090
I think so.

3445
02:11:59,170 --> 02:12:01,250
There was four teams that showed up.

3446
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:03,150
I don't know.

3447
02:12:05,910 --> 02:12:08,090
There was literally three teams that showed up.

3448
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:10,430
I think zone does end here.

3449
02:12:11,410 --> 02:12:12,870
I think we're just unfortunate.

3450
02:12:17,170 --> 02:12:19,170
I'd never think the zone would pull here.

3451
02:12:20,330 --> 02:12:21,410
That's really unfortunate.

3452
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:23,950
Yeah, we were out of luck with the zone pull.

3453
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:27,610
We did great, I guess.

3454
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:31,770
Yeah, it was just unlucky we got RNG'd by zone.

3455
02:12:32,170 --> 02:12:32,910
Because we had no...

3456
02:12:33,410 --> 02:12:34,670
It was not zone.

3457
02:12:34,990 --> 02:12:35,670
I don't think zone is here.

3458
02:12:35,670 --> 02:12:36,310
It was not zone?

3459
02:12:36,450 --> 02:12:37,790
Then why the fuck was everybody here?

3460
02:12:37,790 --> 02:12:39,050
I think everyone is here.

3461
02:12:39,290 --> 02:12:42,970
I think they're fighting for kill points because they need point kills.

3462
02:12:43,570 --> 02:12:47,410
I think we should have definitely been less aggressive if we knew that.

3463
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:50,610
I mean, they flew at us.

3464
02:12:50,850 --> 02:12:52,690
We could have still ran back.

3465
02:12:54,330 --> 02:12:56,990
The only place we could have run to would have been tunnel.

3466
02:12:58,410 --> 02:13:01,690
If we ran anywhere else, we would have ran into a different team.

3467
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:04,030
Yeah, there was a team that appeared from tunnel.

3468
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:05,090
Was there?

3469
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:16,810
Yeah, I saw a team that emerged there and there was a team at the mountain that came from... there was a team that came from monument and then there was a team that came from overlook and there was a team that came from the tunnel and they all pincered us there.

3470
02:13:17,610 --> 02:13:19,030
Oh yeah, that's horrible.

3471
02:13:19,230 --> 02:13:20,230
We were sandwiched.

3472
02:13:20,290 --> 02:13:24,570
Yeah, I think if we stayed in a house, maybe we could have lived, maybe.

3473
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:29,530
And then they just had to pick a team to fight.

3474
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:32,110
It's just hindsight.

3475
02:13:32,990 --> 02:13:33,410
Honestly.

3476
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:36,650
That's the way for tournaments.

3477
02:13:36,970 --> 02:13:38,310
It's all just hindsight.

3478
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:42,970
Damn, that was the most anticlimactic way to get fucking lost.

3479
02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:47,090
I thought we'd be having like a last stand like a top ten or something.

3480
02:13:47,090 --> 02:13:48,850
We just got... now we got ran at.

3481
02:13:50,170 --> 02:13:52,190
We got ran at by a team.

3482
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:54,090
I mean, I expected better.

3483
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:55,490
God, no.

3484
02:13:55,890 --> 02:13:57,730
We got ran at by four teams.

3485
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:58,850
There was nothing we could do.

3486
02:13:59,030 --> 02:14:00,930
There's literally nothing we can do there.

3487
02:14:01,090 --> 02:14:03,450
I thought we were going to main character this stuff, man.

3488
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:08,370
Yeah, and then when they ran at me, I literally had to heal from aggressing on the other team.

3489
02:14:09,290 --> 02:14:12,190
Oh my god, is this the same Mirage or is this a different Mirage?

3490
02:14:12,190 --> 02:14:13,730
No, there's only one Mirage.

3491
02:14:13,850 --> 02:14:15,390
There's literally only one Mirage.

3492
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:18,130
Oh my god, so this is...

3493
02:14:18,130 --> 02:14:18,890
Oh my god.

3494
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:20,130
Oh, you're watching the Mirage?

3495
02:14:20,230 --> 02:14:21,530
I'm watching a different team.

3496
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:23,210
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3497
02:14:23,330 --> 02:14:23,730
God.

3498
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:25,690
I'm watching the Mirage.

3499
02:14:26,210 --> 02:14:27,790
Yeah, I'm also watching the Mirage.

3500
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:30,230
I'm watching the team that third partied.

3501
02:14:31,870 --> 02:14:35,070
Oh, the team that third partied is shooting at the Mirage team right now.

3502
02:14:36,530 --> 02:14:38,110
Yo, yo, yo!

3503
02:14:38,290 --> 02:14:39,030
A bunch of bubbles.

3504
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:44,860
Oh!

3505
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:45,720
Goodbye.

3506
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:47,740
Goodbye, guy.

3507
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:51,620
Oh shit, oh shit, are they gonna lose?

3508
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:53,780
Oh, one team down!

3509
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:55,840
Well, this guy...

3510
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:58,000
No, the other team only has two players alive.

3511
02:14:58,380 --> 02:14:59,960
Oh, wait, never mind, it's 2v2.

3512
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:01,980
Yep, 2v2, 2v2.

3513
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:08,300
Oh, it was nice playing with you guys.

3514
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,840
Yeah, it was great playing with you!

3515
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:11,960
Thank you for inviting me, Doki.

3516
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:12,740
Appreciate it.

3517
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:15,260
That was genuinely fun.

3518
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:17,140
Thank you for inviting me last minute.

3519
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:17,780
I mean, we made it really far!

3520
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:20,080
We made it really far for like...

3521
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:23,060
I came in with an expectation coming 20th.

3522
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:25,200
And we got a lot better than 20th.

3523
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:26,320
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

3524
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:28,680
We actually did really, really well.

3525
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:36,640
Like, with everything going against us, I mean, to be fair, we even got like, you know, we missed out on the drop spot POI too.

3526
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:38,400
Oh my god.

3527
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:39,540
We don't talk about that.

3528
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:46,340
I mean, the fact that we made it this far without the POI we wanted, that's fine too.

3529
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:49,540
I mean, we started off strong, like top 10s.

3530
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:50,720
My god, that was great.

3531
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:55,320
Yeah, like just every other team also started incredibly strong too, so...

3532
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:55,600
Yeah.

3533
02:15:56,380 --> 02:15:59,280
It's just like at the last thing, like we just need one more.

3534
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:02,220
It's like whenever we just say that, we just fumble immediately.

3535
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:05,020
We need just one more update, guys!

3536
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:07,140
One more, and then...

3537
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:08,840
Oh god, we keep just...

3538
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:13,500
Yeah, it's just the way it is.

3539
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:14,760
It is what it is.

3540
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:15,880
Yeah.

3541
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:16,920
That's the thing about tournaments.

3542
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:18,660
You just don't know what's gonna happen.

3543
02:16:18,820 --> 02:16:19,720
Anything can happen.

3544
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:24,380
And like, we made it to this far, guys, and we don't have to play day 3.

3545
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:24,980
Isn't that great?

3546
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:27,080
Yeah, you're right!

3547
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,040
I'm finally free from this tournament!

3548
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,360
I was gonna say, dude.

3549
02:16:31,560 --> 02:16:34,300
At least you can play Marvel Rivals now.

3550
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:34,980
Yay!

3551
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:35,100
Yay!

3552
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:38,560
You don't have to play day 3.

3553
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:41,040
Awesome, awesome.

3554
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:49,500
I was worried, honestly, for Flame because yesterday he was panicking about like, oh my god, I have to push so many things for my schedule.

3555
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:55,400
Like, oh my god, how tough is the schedule gonna be after this?

3556
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:56,520
Oh my god!

3557
02:16:56,740 --> 02:17:02,280
I just saw the Valk fucking die to a zone and all.

3558
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:03,700
Yeah.

3559
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:06,300
Oh my god, this poor team.

3560
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:07,460
They didn't make it.

3561
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:09,500
This poor fucking team.

3562
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:11,400
Oh no, Mirage!

3563
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:13,800
Oh, the Mirage is dead?

3564
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:14,860
Oh, that was the team!

3565
02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:18,360
There's no heat shields!

3566
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:20,240
Well, it's over.

3567
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:20,800
It's over.

3568
02:17:23,380 --> 02:17:23,860
Unless...

3569
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:24,500
Oh, they can.

3570
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:25,620
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

3571
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:27,680
Wait, are they gonna actually win?

3572
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:28,640
No, no.

3573
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:28,880
They could.

3574
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:32,200
How far is the zone?

3575
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:34,060
Pretty far.

3576
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:35,740
They have two support.

3577
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:37,620
Oh yeah, that's true.

3578
02:17:38,300 --> 02:17:40,060
I thought this was a fight.

3579
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:41,580
Oh no!

3580
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:43,300
What's he been doing?

3581
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:46,720
Oh my god!

3582
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,360
Oh my god, Ping!

3583
02:17:48,720 --> 02:17:50,600
Oh no!

3584
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:52,660
They can't blame on Ping!

3585
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:57,360
They can't blame on Ping because they're literally literally in Japan.

3586
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:58,900
They're not us.

3587
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:01,160
They're not us.

3588
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:06,080
Listen, I think we had an average Ping of like 200 to 300.

3589
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:09,900
Yeah, it depends on how your internet feels like.

3590
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:14,360
My internet is also like insanely bad.

3591
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:15,540
It's like 200 to 300.

3592
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:17,420
How do you do championship scrims then?

3593
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,860
Uh, yeah.

3594
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:21,380
Probably like 250 to 300.

3595
02:18:21,740 --> 02:18:23,920
Yeah, holy...

3596
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:25,140
Holy bad here.

3597
02:18:25,140 --> 02:18:28,860
Yeah, I was gonna say, how the fuck do you survive those scrims without Ping?

3598
02:18:28,980 --> 02:18:29,600
Oh, they're fucked.

3599
02:18:29,780 --> 02:18:30,540
There's a team in the tunnel.

3600
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:34,680
Guess I'm not subscribing to that fucking exit lag.

3601
02:18:35,440 --> 02:18:37,780
I mean, it was a free trial, so you'd be fine.

3602
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:39,000
Yeah.

3603
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:42,300
You never had to pay anything again anyway.

3604
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:45,560
Yo, they survived!

3605
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:46,720
I thought they were gonna die.

3606
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:49,000
They actually made it.

3607
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:50,680
Oh my god, what happened to the team in the tunnel?

3608
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:51,640
Oh no, there was... Oh no, there is.

3609
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:53,540
They're still there.

3610
02:18:54,320 --> 02:18:55,580
Oh my god!

3611
02:18:57,640 --> 02:18:59,240
I think it's two master players.

3612
02:18:59,460 --> 02:19:00,780
No, no, Mirage is Pred.

3613
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:02,080
I think it's a Pred master player.

3614
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:06,100
Wait, no, there's no way their point system doesn't work like that.

3615
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:09,040
There's no way they can get a master player with their point system.

3616
02:19:10,380 --> 02:19:11,880
Cause I'm considered a Pred.

3617
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:16,200
Even though I'm like super fucking washed.

3618
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:19,200
Two Preds...

3619
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:26,020
A Pred and a master is like definitely less points than... Oh, cause yeah, you're LGS pro.

3620
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:26,740
Yeah, yeah, I forgot.

3621
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,900
They're not, so they can fit a master in.

3622
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:35,000
Oh my god, they lived.

3623
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:39,060
The Pathfinder is doing the best.

3624
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:39,560
What?

3625
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:41,520
Oh my god, he's...

3626
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:42,720
Oh shit, you're right!

3627
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:44,740
He's a triple Pred player.

3628
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:46,460
I think it's two Preds.

3629
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:47,840
Yeah.

3630
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:50,440
He's max level already.

3631
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,340
But the thing is, they have...

3632
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:55,460
Wait, no, this guy has more points cause he's a recent Pred too.

3633
02:19:56,720 --> 02:20:01,060
Cause like my points are 12 for a season 4 Pred.

3634
02:20:02,460 --> 02:20:06,800
His Pred badges, I think his most recent one is like less than season 9.

3635
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:09,800
That does not look like a recent badge, I don't think.

3636
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:14,100
Yeah, but still, he looks like a guy that plays very consistently.

3637
02:20:17,560 --> 02:20:22,960
I play every, like various FPS games, I do not play Apex consistently anymore.

3638
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:26,240
There's options for me.

3639
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:28,540
I mean, you've been playing for a long time, so...

3640
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:29,820
I have, I have.

3641
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:30,740
That's why I don't...

3642
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:34,060
Yeah, but like these guys have been playing a long time, plus consistently.

3643
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:35,560
Ooh.

3644
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:38,000
And I've been on third person too.

3645
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:39,160
Hey, most of them are streamers, right?

3646
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:40,320
I think they're like...

3647
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,540
All the players here are content creators.

3648
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:43,460
Oh, hell yeah.

3649
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:45,280
Content creators are pros.

3650
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:45,780
No wonder.

3651
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:49,260
Yeah, this is a content creator lobby.

3652
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:52,720
So I was like, what if the other two teams didn't get any points?

3653
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:56,280
Guys, there's teams below us that can also get points.

3654
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:03,920
Like, yeah, but guys, you gotta remember, the other teams also can get points.

3655
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:05,660
Yeah.

3656
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:13,400
The only way we can do this is only if the top 9 teams get points These are the only ones that get points, that's it.

3657
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:15,960
Everybody else doesn't get any points.

3658
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:19,420
Wait, is the Mirage team gonna win again?

3659
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:21,680
I think they are.

3660
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:24,860
Dude, they... Yo!

3661
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:33,280
I mean, I feel like I want the Mirage team to win, just so they can get the lead, like, they can farm all the points.

3662
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:34,380
Honestly.

3663
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,300
Our best bet is if they farm all the points.

3664
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:40,440
Oh, never mind.

3665
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:41,420
Goodbye, Gibraltar.

3666
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:44,240
Goodbye, Gibraltar.

3667
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,460
No, they can rat this out.

3668
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:47,340
Oh my god, that Pathfinder was so lucky.

3669
02:21:48,820 --> 02:21:52,320
That Pathfinder got the bad off at the right time.

3670
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:55,700
Oh, well, oh god.

3671
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:56,980
Battery, battery, please.

3672
02:21:57,880 --> 02:21:59,100
Pathfinder, please.

3673
02:22:03,580 --> 02:22:04,460
Oh my god.

3674
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:06,320
Jesus.

3675
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:06,480
Jesus.

3676
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:15,590
Oh!

3677
02:22:17,550 --> 02:22:18,230
Nice!

3678
02:22:18,350 --> 02:22:18,830
Crack!

3679
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:20,870
Holy shit.

3680
02:22:21,510 --> 02:22:22,730
They're fucking alive?

3681
02:22:23,970 --> 02:22:25,170
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

3682
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:29,460
God damn.

3683
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:30,580
Mirage.

3684
02:22:40,060 --> 02:22:42,180
He's just jumping around with his clones.

3685
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:45,140
No one knows what to do.

3686
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:48,580
They're just like, which one's the real one?

3687
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:54,680
The thing is, this Mirage knows when he has the clones, he can play more dangerously because they're like, who do I shoot?

3688
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:55,820
Yeah.

3689
02:22:56,500 --> 02:22:59,200
Like, look at that Mirage, he's fucking going in.

3690
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:00,780
Oh, and he's dead.

3691
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:04,480
He literally has one life.

3692
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,140
Oh, Jk, there's his life's gone.

3693
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:10,820
He literally gambled that.

3694
02:23:11,020 --> 02:23:13,220
He was like, they're not gonna shoot me.

3695
02:23:13,660 --> 02:23:17,680
You have to figure out like, oh, is he actually gonna shoot me or not?

3696
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:21,860
And the Pathfinder can't rez that because he's not a support character.

3697
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:23,500
Fuck, really?

3698
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:25,500
Oh, oh.

3699
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,460
It's too risky for him.

3700
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:29,980
Shit.

3701
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,380
Oh my god.

3702
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:34,740
I didn't know there were plays in like, uh, reviving.

3703
02:23:35,140 --> 02:23:36,380
I mean, I think he's pretty clear.

3704
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:37,380
No one's- oh!

3705
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:38,740
No, he is not clear.

3706
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:39,500
Oh.

3707
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:43,900
Oh, nine more teams.

3708
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:49,220
Yeah, nine more squads until this tournament is officially over for us.

3709
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:56,280
I hope all the teams that pushed us in that one area died.

3710
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:00,280
That's all I want in life.

3711
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:01,180
I hope so too.

3712
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:08,040
Those four teams that fucking pushed us, I hope they never- I hope they didn't get to play the game.

3713
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:11,980
Why are you so toxic?

3714
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:13,080
Oh my god.

3715
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:14,540
Did you not remember what just happened to us?

3716
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:15,880
I hope they just fucking don't make it.

3717
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:18,020
Literally, we were not in zone.

3718
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:21,940
This was not end zone, and we had four teams ran at us.

3719
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:24,440
They were so aggressive.

3720
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:27,140
I get to be toxic over that.

3721
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:31,080
That was the most dumbest shit you could do.

3722
02:24:33,020 --> 02:24:34,260
Yeah, not gonna lie.

3723
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:37,940
Why specifically during the end game you had to fuck us up like that?

3724
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:39,180
Yeah, I kinda get it.

3725
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:43,320
The fact that we had four teams that did that to us.

3726
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:47,940
I'm like, this is not end team, this is not end zone.

3727
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:49,440
Why are you here?

3728
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:51,560
It's just a little drill.

3729
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:53,040
Why?

3730
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:54,520
They just heard gunshots.

3731
02:24:56,660 --> 02:24:59,060
They were hoping to be the team that made it out.

3732
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:03,300
All four of them were like, we're gonna be the team that makes it out of here.

3733
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:05,360
And grab all those KP.

3734
02:25:09,550 --> 02:25:13,030
I want them all to suffer and watch the game like us.

3735
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:16,890
Just all the way through.

3736
02:25:18,310 --> 02:25:20,050
This is quite a sit through.

3737
02:25:22,510 --> 02:25:22,990
What?

3738
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:25,670
This is a fucking scary end game though.

3739
02:25:27,470 --> 02:25:31,310
I mean, the guy in the tower, I think he has the most advantage.

3740
02:25:31,610 --> 02:25:33,550
No one would try to get up there.

3741
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:35,590
End game is next to them too.

3742
02:25:36,450 --> 02:25:36,990
Is it?

3743
02:25:37,570 --> 02:25:40,970
I think my minimap is bugged.

3744
02:25:41,050 --> 02:25:41,470
Wait, really?

3745
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:43,430
I don't know, I can't see where it's ending.

3746
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:47,430
It's ending right next to the people on the high ground.

3747
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:48,790
Really?

3748
02:25:49,150 --> 02:25:50,370
How do you guys see that?

3749
02:25:50,930 --> 02:25:53,670
You see the line on the top left, right?

3750
02:25:54,670 --> 02:25:55,310
Uh huh.

3751
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:56,450
So you see where it ends at?

3752
02:25:56,450 --> 02:26:02,170
My line is ending there as well, but I'm pretty sure it's a bug with spectator.

3753
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:02,910
Wait, really?

3754
02:26:03,070 --> 02:26:04,290
So that's not end game?

3755
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:07,470
The line moves with the guy, if you see.

3756
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:08,410
Oh, does it?

3757
02:26:09,550 --> 02:26:18,430
If the point where the line goes doesn't move with the guy, then I can't tell because he's not moving that much.

3758
02:26:19,310 --> 02:26:20,650
Do they have a solid spot?

3759
02:26:20,670 --> 02:26:20,770
I don't know.

3760
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:23,530
I think it is.

3761
02:26:23,650 --> 02:26:25,170
Everybody's converging there though.

3762
02:26:25,490 --> 02:26:27,030
See, everyone's converging there.

3763
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:33,510
It's just the problem is when they changed the algorithm like a while back Oh my god, the Pathfinder is cooking.

3764
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:39,010
They changed the algorithm a while back where it adds like hard pull to one side of the zone.

3765
02:26:39,410 --> 02:26:41,450
Like it'll always bias towards the middle.

3766
02:26:42,290 --> 02:26:44,210
Why did they drop off high ground?

3767
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:44,990
Wait, what?

3768
02:26:45,070 --> 02:26:46,810
I'm pretty sure the zone doesn't end on them.

3769
02:26:47,330 --> 02:26:49,230
Oh, it doesn't?

3770
02:26:49,410 --> 02:26:49,590
Yeah.

3771
02:26:51,430 --> 02:26:53,690
I was like, why did they drop down?

3772
02:26:53,770 --> 02:26:56,110
You're so close to...

3773
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:59,510
Yeah, I guess it wasn't Yeah, it wasn't.

3774
02:27:01,390 --> 02:27:03,350
Oh, they got top Q though from that thing.

3775
02:27:09,790 --> 02:27:11,770
To be fair, they were 1 HP.

3776
02:27:12,050 --> 02:27:12,950
They were 1 HP.

3777
02:27:13,130 --> 02:27:14,090
Like, what the fuck can you do?

3778
02:27:16,210 --> 02:27:17,050
GG's everybody.

3779
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:18,670
GG's.

3780
02:27:18,850 --> 02:27:19,510
Good game!

3781
02:27:21,010 --> 02:27:23,290
Not really though because that was fucking pathetic.

3782
02:27:23,330 --> 02:27:24,310
It was fun to watch.

3783
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:25,230
It was good to watch.

3784
02:27:25,230 --> 02:27:26,750
It was a good game to watch though.

3785
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:29,290
Other than the part where the Pathfinder grappled over.

3786
02:27:31,430 --> 02:27:31,910
Yeah.

3787
02:27:32,890 --> 02:27:34,690
Well, that was it everybody.

3788
02:27:34,910 --> 02:27:37,110
Hope you guys enjoyed the tournament experience.

3789
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:40,290
Yeah, for your first tournament you did really well, Gerard.

3790
02:27:40,650 --> 02:27:41,310
For your first tournament.

3791
02:27:41,310 --> 02:27:42,630
We made it so far though.

3792
02:27:42,810 --> 02:27:43,970
That's the thing.

3793
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:45,710
We had a lot of fun.

3794
02:27:47,050 --> 02:27:48,470
Yeah, we had a lot of fun.

3795
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:49,730
We get to watch Gerard run.

3796
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:52,950
We weren't really aiming for literally this position.

3797
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:54,590
Yeah, we never...

3798
02:27:54,590 --> 02:27:56,970
None of us thought we would make it this far.

3799
02:27:57,110 --> 02:27:57,830
That's the thing.

3800
02:27:59,010 --> 02:28:00,710
Yeah, and we kept on believing.

3801
02:28:01,130 --> 02:28:01,710
That's what matters.

3802
02:28:01,890 --> 02:28:03,710
Yeah, and we had some good games too.

3803
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:07,190
And we had some great moments like Gerard running into a team when we said go die.

3804
02:28:07,570 --> 02:28:08,010
That was...

3805
02:28:08,010 --> 02:28:13,050
I need to know what team that was that he ran at.

3806
02:28:13,370 --> 02:28:14,710
Like, I am very curious.

3807
02:28:18,570 --> 02:28:25,630
I need to know what they were thinking when they saw this guy fucking run at them.

3808
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:29,550
God, that was horrible.

3809
02:28:29,550 --> 02:28:30,650
That was a great moment.

3810
02:28:30,770 --> 02:28:31,470
That woke me up.

3811
02:28:31,570 --> 02:28:34,450
That actually made me lock in the next couple of games after.

3812
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:39,610
No, Gerard disabled the replay.

3813
02:28:40,330 --> 02:28:41,870
He disabled the replay.

3814
02:28:42,390 --> 02:28:44,290
He disabled the replay.

3815
02:28:44,850 --> 02:28:45,870
You want me to turn it on?

3816
02:28:45,990 --> 02:28:46,670
I can turn it on.

3817
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:49,670
We needed three points, Flame.

3818
02:28:50,230 --> 02:28:50,910
We needed three?

3819
02:28:51,070 --> 02:28:55,050
We needed three points and we would have made it.

3820
02:28:55,390 --> 02:28:56,850
Oh my god.

3821
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:59,410
Oh my god.

3822
02:28:59,930 --> 02:29:01,270
That was so close.

3823
02:29:01,410 --> 02:29:02,850
We literally just needed three.

3824
02:29:03,890 --> 02:29:04,490
Jesus.

3825
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:09,330
If we killed that team in the house, we'd probably win the tiebreaker.

3826
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:12,990
Yeah, we literally were the only 30 point team that didn't get points.

3827
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:15,630
Yeah, that's tough.

3828
02:29:15,930 --> 02:29:19,510
That was the most unlucky thing that could have happened to us.

3829
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:22,810
All the 30 point teams got points.

3830
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:26,050
Oh, we were so close.

3831
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:26,750
That's fine though.

3832
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:27,610
We were really close.

3833
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:28,610
We made it really far.

3834
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:30,650
And we're free tomorrow.

3835
02:29:31,510 --> 02:29:34,270
We don't have to wake up at really...

3836
02:29:34,270 --> 02:29:35,850
I don't have to wake up.

3837
02:29:37,490 --> 02:29:39,810
I'm free tomorrow now, except for my conventions.

3838
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:40,530
Woo!

3839
02:29:41,390 --> 02:29:43,090
What convention was that?

3840
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:47,270
I don't know where it is in America, but it's...

3841
02:29:48,690 --> 02:29:50,630
It's somewhere in America, guys.

3842
02:29:50,630 --> 02:29:51,030
Check it out.

3843
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:53,750
Just go somewhere in America.

3844
02:29:54,430 --> 02:29:56,010
It's in Florida, guys.

3845
02:29:56,370 --> 02:29:58,310
I'll be there in Florida tomorrow.

3846
02:29:59,350 --> 02:29:59,950
Virtually.

3847
02:30:00,550 --> 02:30:01,150
GGs.

3848
02:30:01,290 --> 02:30:02,950
I had a great time playing with you guys.

3849
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:04,970
Yeah, thank you.

3850
02:30:05,690 --> 02:30:07,110
I appreciate the invite.

3851
02:30:07,110 --> 02:30:12,630
Yeah, now you'll be less stressed for LGS flame after playing with Juraj and I.

3852
02:30:12,870 --> 02:30:13,730
You'll be...

3853
02:30:14,950 --> 02:30:16,850
I love my teammates, Mel.

3854
02:30:16,990 --> 02:30:20,270
Yeah, I was gonna say, you're gonna appreciate your teammates so much more.

3855
02:30:23,350 --> 02:30:26,710
You're like, when you say go time, Lisa will not do that.

3856
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:30,170
Oh my god, we're getting things done.

3857
02:30:30,330 --> 02:30:30,990
Oh my god, what?

3858
02:30:32,410 --> 02:30:34,850
You're just like, whoa, that was such...

3859
02:30:34,850 --> 02:30:37,510
Oh my god, you don't need to tell them where to put your walls.

3860
02:30:37,850 --> 02:30:40,890
You've been so traumatized by the tournament.

3861
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:44,750
You learn to love your teammates after.

3862
02:30:49,330 --> 02:30:50,690
That was fun, though.

3863
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:51,410
GG.

3864
02:30:51,530 --> 02:30:53,090
I'm happy to play with you guys.

3865
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:55,670
Thank you for accepting my invite to this tournament.

3866
02:30:56,730 --> 02:30:57,910
Thank you, thank you.

3867
02:30:59,530 --> 02:31:00,490
GGs, everybody.

3868
02:31:00,770 --> 02:31:01,110
GGs.

3869
02:31:01,170 --> 02:31:03,250
I hope we get to play again in the future.

3870
02:31:04,650 --> 02:31:06,070
Thank you, thank you.

3871
02:31:06,370 --> 02:31:11,150
If by chance we get to meet each other, it's gonna be a fight.

3872
02:31:11,390 --> 02:31:11,850
You should come to Japan.

3873
02:31:12,030 --> 02:31:13,130
What do you mean, a fight?

3874
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:14,990
Come to Japan!

3875
02:31:15,970 --> 02:31:17,110
Drinks are on me.

3876
02:31:17,330 --> 02:31:19,990
You should come to Japan.

3877
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:22,190
Hey, yeah, you're right.

3878
02:31:22,190 --> 02:31:23,210
Are you running Japan, Doki?

3879
02:31:23,610 --> 02:31:23,990
Maybe.

3880
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:25,390
Maybe.

3881
02:31:26,150 --> 02:31:28,410
I can't say it on stream if I am or not.

3882
02:31:28,770 --> 02:31:29,830
So let's just say maybe.

3883
02:31:32,990 --> 02:31:33,610
Alright.

3884
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:36,790
I may be there, might not be there.

3885
02:31:36,890 --> 02:31:37,630
Who knows?

3886
02:31:37,690 --> 02:31:39,990
I can't confirm or deny it.

3887
02:31:40,310 --> 02:31:42,110
What do you mean by that?

3888
02:31:44,930 --> 02:31:47,830
I don't like telling people exactly where I'm going.

3889
02:31:50,270 --> 02:31:52,850
I like that people think there's a...

3890
02:31:52,850 --> 02:31:54,130
I might not be there.

3891
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:55,330
It's a mystery.

3892
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:57,090
It's always a mystery.

3893
02:31:57,850 --> 02:31:58,350
So yeah.

3894
02:32:03,310 --> 02:32:07,070
You just get off on the suffering of other people.

3895
02:32:07,130 --> 02:32:07,430
Yeah.

3896
02:32:07,770 --> 02:32:11,910
They'll always be like, Whoa, what's gonna happen?

3897
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:12,870
Is she going or is she not?

3898
02:32:13,030 --> 02:32:14,690
We don't know.

3899
02:32:17,270 --> 02:32:19,090
They're just fighting the right time.

3900
02:32:20,090 --> 02:32:23,130
I'll eventually be in Japan at one point.

3901
02:32:23,170 --> 02:32:26,710
But we don't know if it's five years, ten years, a couple of months.

3902
02:32:26,790 --> 02:32:27,790
We'll never know.

3903
02:32:28,510 --> 02:32:29,870
Same here, who knows?

3904
02:32:29,870 --> 02:32:30,490
Alright.

3905
02:32:32,570 --> 02:32:33,470
GGs, guys.

3906
02:32:33,690 --> 02:32:35,030
I had so much fun.

3907
02:32:35,370 --> 02:32:37,310
I think this has to be the least...

3908
02:32:37,310 --> 02:32:41,450
This was definitely the least stressful tournament for me of this year.

3909
02:32:42,150 --> 02:32:43,250
Because of us?

3910
02:32:43,530 --> 02:32:45,630
Because of...

3911
02:32:45,630 --> 02:32:49,250
Because honestly, the things Jirard does it just...

3912
02:32:49,650 --> 02:32:50,650
Puts me out of it.

3913
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:55,690
It made me realize I was like...

3914
02:32:55,690 --> 02:32:58,190
Whenever you do something, I was like...

3915
02:32:58,190 --> 02:32:59,450
I'm just like...

3916
02:32:59,450 --> 02:33:00,970
This is not as serious as I thought it was.

3917
02:33:06,690 --> 02:33:07,910
It's not stressful!

3918
02:33:08,290 --> 02:33:09,190
It doesn't feel...

3919
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:11,050
It's good because I'm not stressed.

3920
02:33:11,570 --> 02:33:13,510
I'm not stressed playing this tournament.

3921
02:33:15,890 --> 02:33:17,130
You get the vibes.

3922
02:33:18,330 --> 02:33:19,590
You get the vibes.

3923
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:21,230
I'm just not as serious.

3924
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:23,230
You're welcome.

3925
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:25,890
I walk in, but I'm not stressed out.

3926
02:33:28,190 --> 02:33:29,010
You're welcome, I guess.

3927
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:29,650
Thank you.

3928
02:33:29,770 --> 02:33:32,090
I think Flame is stressed out though.

3929
02:33:33,450 --> 02:33:35,730
I would say I'm a little bit stressed out.

3930
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:37,810
Don't look at my stream, guys.

3931
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:39,050
Let's relive this moment.

3932
02:33:41,030 --> 02:33:44,170
Flame, you have to save his ass every time.

3933
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:44,950
I just watch.

3934
02:33:46,510 --> 02:33:48,670
I just get to watch it happen.

3935
02:33:50,110 --> 02:33:50,810
No, no, no.

3936
02:33:50,830 --> 02:33:51,090
It's okay.

3937
02:33:54,130 --> 02:33:55,690
Look at my stream, guys.

3938
02:33:55,690 --> 02:33:56,690
Look at my stream on Discord.

3939
02:33:58,710 --> 02:34:00,590
Let's relive this legendary moment.

3940
02:34:02,210 --> 02:34:04,050
You gotta watch what I saw.

3941
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:07,530
When the VOD is over, you guys gotta watch what I saw.

3942
02:34:08,290 --> 02:34:10,290
It's actually so fucking funny.

3943
02:34:10,430 --> 02:34:12,590
My POV of it is so funny.

3944
02:34:13,170 --> 02:34:14,630
You told me to die!

3945
02:34:14,910 --> 02:34:15,970
I had no choice!

3946
02:34:16,970 --> 02:34:20,550
I got the overview of both of you.

3947
02:34:26,310 --> 02:34:27,750
I'm dead.

3948
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:40,150
At least we got free armor points from him dying again there.

3949
02:34:41,430 --> 02:34:44,010
I like how you rewinded it, too.

3950
02:34:49,390 --> 02:34:51,490
I fucking hate this.

3951
02:34:56,170 --> 02:34:57,690
I thought that's what you meant!

3952
02:34:57,810 --> 02:34:58,410
God damn it.

3953
02:35:02,570 --> 02:35:03,010
No...

3954
02:35:04,750 --> 02:35:07,550
I mean, at least it was enjoyable for all of you, I guess.

3955
02:35:07,810 --> 02:35:09,790
Yeah, it was very enjoyable.

3956
02:35:10,230 --> 02:35:11,690
I had a great time.

3957
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:13,850
No, thank you for making...

3958
02:35:14,530 --> 02:35:15,830
I had a great time as well.

3959
02:35:16,470 --> 02:35:19,410
Thank you for making me actually a little bit better.

3960
02:35:19,970 --> 02:35:22,510
Like, throughout this sermon, I've been learning a lot from both of you.

3961
02:35:22,510 --> 02:35:24,010
Yeah, you're absorbing...

3962
02:35:24,010 --> 02:35:26,670
Yeah, now you're just gonna be a Rampart main right after that.

3963
02:35:29,090 --> 02:35:29,970
Yeah, actually.

3964
02:35:30,550 --> 02:35:30,990
Legit.

3965
02:35:31,330 --> 02:35:31,690
Legit.

3966
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:32,110
I don't know.

3967
02:35:32,310 --> 02:35:34,110
I could see it going either way.

3968
02:35:34,290 --> 02:35:37,710
Either he becomes a Rampart main, or he's too traumatized to ever touch it again.

3969
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:39,370
No!

3970
02:35:39,990 --> 02:35:41,230
I actually like it!

3971
02:35:41,330 --> 02:35:42,110
I actually like it!

3972
02:35:42,230 --> 02:35:43,730
Like the strats at endgame.

3973
02:35:44,170 --> 02:35:46,530
Like, Jesus, I love the strats that you guys think of.

3974
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:47,190
It's awesome.

3975
02:35:47,890 --> 02:35:49,230
It's a nice investment.

3976
02:35:49,810 --> 02:35:51,610
Yeah, now you know.

3977
02:35:51,750 --> 02:35:53,630
And you did really well for your first tournament.

3978
02:35:53,630 --> 02:35:55,470
My first tournament, I didn't do that well.

3979
02:35:55,550 --> 02:35:58,050
Yeah, like, thank you for giving me my first champion.

3980
02:35:58,870 --> 02:36:02,850
Yeah, your very first champion against other Pred players, too.

3981
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:05,190
And Pred and Pros, that's really good.

3982
02:36:06,290 --> 02:36:08,790
In fact, you actually killed Pro players.

3983
02:36:09,370 --> 02:36:11,550
You actually killed a Pro player during that 1v3.

3984
02:36:12,050 --> 02:36:12,850
One of them was a Pro.

3985
02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:13,370
Yeah!

3986
02:36:14,130 --> 02:36:15,210
Yeah, I know!

3987
02:36:15,810 --> 02:36:17,930
Yeah, he 1v3'd a Pro!

3988
02:36:17,930 --> 02:36:29,690
Dude, I cringed, like, I watched a VOD, and like, I could've, I should've, like, re-batteried myself, and like, healed, and went outside, but I was like, full on adrenaline.

3989
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:31,470
Yeah, you were just dying.

3990
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:35,210
I did not look at my HP.

3991
02:36:35,750 --> 02:36:37,830
Like, I was so hyped, like, YAY!

3992
02:36:38,110 --> 02:36:39,030
SQUAD WIPE!

3993
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:40,490
Ran outside, got shot.

3994
02:36:42,030 --> 02:36:43,650
He was just like, I did it!

3995
02:36:43,710 --> 02:36:44,870
And then, fuck you, shot.

3996
02:36:44,870 --> 02:36:49,390
He literally got shot the moment you came out.

3997
02:36:50,310 --> 02:36:52,510
Dude, I was like, are you guys proud of me?

3998
02:36:52,970 --> 02:36:55,610
Look what I just did!

3999
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:57,250
Look what I...

4000
02:36:59,290 --> 02:37:00,910
But that won't happen ever again.

4001
02:37:01,130 --> 02:37:02,590
Because that never happened here.

4002
02:37:02,690 --> 02:37:03,390
It never did.

4003
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:05,850
I was gonna say something really fucked up.

4004
02:37:06,650 --> 02:37:07,630
What the fuck?!

4005
02:37:07,630 --> 02:37:09,830
It's not gonna happen again, because you're not invited.

4006
02:37:12,370 --> 02:37:13,310
I'm joking.

4007
02:37:13,730 --> 02:37:14,630
I'm joking.

4008
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:16,290
Don't invite me to these things ever again.

4009
02:37:16,350 --> 02:37:24,550
If I need points, need someone who's under the point threshold, you got my DM.

4010
02:37:26,090 --> 02:37:28,630
I'll never play rank ever again.

4011
02:37:29,390 --> 02:37:30,810
You have to!

4012
02:37:30,910 --> 02:37:33,050
You have to not play rank ever again.

4013
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:34,070
You gotta be my bronze player.

4014
02:37:34,070 --> 02:37:35,590
I'm just gonna be playing pubs forever.

4015
02:37:35,690 --> 02:37:38,270
You gotta be my bronze player.

4016
02:37:40,870 --> 02:37:41,910
I mean, I'm alright with it.

4017
02:37:41,970 --> 02:37:44,610
I don't actually, like, play rank all the time.

4018
02:37:44,630 --> 02:37:46,230
I just, like, like to chill.

4019
02:37:46,330 --> 02:37:47,830
Not all the time I get to play anyway.

4020
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:51,750
Wait, Flame, you gotta post that clip of your POV of the...

4021
02:37:53,190 --> 02:37:54,730
You gotta tweet it.

4022
02:37:54,810 --> 02:37:55,370
You gotta tweet that clip.

4023
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:57,530
I'm gonna retweet the shit out of it, I swear.

4024
02:37:58,530 --> 02:38:00,310
Do it right now, I'll retweet it.

4025
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:05,710
Somebody can also clip my POV of everything, and then so we can all see, like...

4026
02:38:05,710 --> 02:38:10,950
Someone clip your POV, my POV, and Flame's POV.

4027
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:16,150
And then Flame will post his own POV, and then we can see the whole fucking shitshow happen.

4028
02:38:16,650 --> 02:38:18,630
We got different angles of it!

4029
02:38:21,850 --> 02:38:24,710
I mean, I'll send you guys my POV if you want it.

4030
02:38:24,750 --> 02:38:26,990
No, no, you gotta post it on Twitter, Flame.

4031
02:38:28,770 --> 02:38:31,390
No, Flame, post it on Twitter, Flame!

4032
02:38:31,410 --> 02:38:31,410
No, you do it!

4033
02:38:31,410 --> 02:38:32,090
You do it!

4034
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:36,670
You'll get so many retweets and, like, think about that, Flame.

4035
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:39,110
Dude, you're gonna be so famous after this.

4036
02:38:40,490 --> 02:38:42,210
Dude, do that right now!

4037
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:43,670
Yeah, come on, do it right now!

4038
02:38:43,750 --> 02:38:44,270
Post that clip!

4039
02:38:44,330 --> 02:38:46,690
We're not leaving until you post the clip right now.

4040
02:38:46,870 --> 02:38:48,110
And we can retweet it live.

4041
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:49,250
I did.

4042
02:38:49,390 --> 02:38:50,110
I mean, my problem...

4043
02:38:50,650 --> 02:38:55,410
It's not that I don't want to post the clip, it's just that it takes a long time to, like...

4044
02:38:55,410 --> 02:38:56,210
Just clip it!

4045
02:38:56,430 --> 02:38:56,870
Just snip it!

4046
02:38:56,890 --> 02:38:58,950
Yeah, we have the time, we'll just sit here, bro.

4047
02:38:59,210 --> 02:39:01,810
Yeah, we'll sit here until you do it.

4048
02:39:03,170 --> 02:39:05,870
Oh, and somebody made the clip!

4049
02:39:05,870 --> 02:39:06,850
Okay, here's...

4050
02:39:06,850 --> 02:39:10,110
Somebody made my clip, my POV.

4051
02:39:10,190 --> 02:39:11,490
You guys gotta see this POV.

4052
02:39:11,890 --> 02:39:14,230
I posted it in the Doki Bird channel.

4053
02:39:17,330 --> 02:39:18,570
I'm retweeting it.

4054
02:39:19,970 --> 02:39:20,930
Okay, this...

4055
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:22,330
Yeah, I'm just gonna retweet this.

4056
02:39:25,530 --> 02:39:27,110
Wait, did you guys retweet it already?

4057
02:39:27,290 --> 02:39:28,630
I retweeted mine, yeah.

4058
02:39:29,370 --> 02:39:31,770
Oh shit, let me retweet it too!

4059
02:39:35,870 --> 02:39:36,930
Oh my god!

4060
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:40,550
My POV was fucking crazy!

4061
02:39:40,570 --> 02:39:42,450
It's so horrible to look at!

4062
02:39:43,290 --> 02:39:43,870
No!

4063
02:39:47,390 --> 02:39:49,310
My embarrassment again?

4064
02:39:53,350 --> 02:39:54,510
No, no...

4065
02:39:54,510 --> 02:39:56,190
Oh my god...

4066
02:39:56,190 --> 02:39:57,330
Again!

4067
02:39:57,530 --> 02:39:58,670
You told me to die!

4068
02:39:58,990 --> 02:40:01,810
Anyone who's watching me right now, you told me to die!

4069
02:40:02,090 --> 02:40:04,490
You wanted me to die so we could pick you up!

4070
02:40:04,490 --> 02:40:07,770
You kept picking me up in the middle of nowhere!

4071
02:40:08,190 --> 02:40:09,210
I don't know!

4072
02:40:09,550 --> 02:40:10,070
My brain!

4073
02:40:10,650 --> 02:40:11,710
My brain!

4074
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:13,670
I thought you understood me!

4075
02:40:13,770 --> 02:40:14,350
My brain!

4076
02:40:17,630 --> 02:40:20,470
Oh no, oh god...

4077
02:40:20,470 --> 02:40:21,950
Oh no...

4078
02:40:21,950 --> 02:40:23,390
Oh my god...

4079
02:40:23,390 --> 02:40:26,430
I literally had the perfect POV for all of that.

4080
02:40:31,250 --> 02:40:32,690
Okay, that was painful.

4081
02:40:32,690 --> 02:40:34,410
Anyway, anything else?

4082
02:40:34,670 --> 02:40:35,330
Other than that?

4083
02:40:35,570 --> 02:40:39,810
We just need to wait until Flame posts his POV too.

4084
02:40:39,890 --> 02:40:42,150
So we have three POVs at the moment.

4085
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:44,630
No Flame, you have to!

4086
02:40:45,830 --> 02:40:46,990
You have to!

4087
02:40:47,330 --> 02:40:47,890
Flame!

4088
02:40:47,890 --> 02:40:49,070
Come on Flame!

4089
02:40:50,550 --> 02:40:52,570
Flame, it'll be so funny!

4090
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:53,270
Flame, come on!

4091
02:40:53,450 --> 02:40:56,270
Your POV actually fixes a lot of things!

4092
02:40:56,350 --> 02:40:56,850
Come on, come on.

4093
02:40:57,190 --> 02:41:00,690
Your POV makes everything...

4094
02:41:00,690 --> 02:41:02,470
Yeah, it makes everything even better.

4095
02:41:02,550 --> 02:41:03,850
It unites all of us.

4096
02:41:06,270 --> 02:41:08,390
You gotta post it on Twitter.

4097
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:12,810
Just from your eyes seeing the horror just running straight to the enemy?

4098
02:41:13,090 --> 02:41:14,790
I wanna see that!

4099
02:41:15,070 --> 02:41:17,070
We wanna have immortalized on Twitter.

4100
02:41:19,650 --> 02:41:21,310
Something to remember, you know?

4101
02:41:21,410 --> 02:41:22,530
You said so yourself!

4102
02:41:22,810 --> 02:41:23,790
Yeah, exactly!

4103
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:26,970
There were so many moments, but I think this was the one.

4104
02:41:27,190 --> 02:41:27,430
This is the time.

4105
02:41:27,430 --> 02:41:28,830
This was the best moment.

4106
02:41:28,830 --> 02:41:33,330
Out of all the moments, this was the moment in Apex Legends.

4107
02:41:33,710 --> 02:41:35,350
Forget the top three.

4108
02:41:35,690 --> 02:41:36,710
This is the moment.

4109
02:41:36,830 --> 02:41:39,810
Forget the championship, this was the moment!

4110
02:41:40,070 --> 02:41:40,150
Don't forget that!

4111
02:41:40,430 --> 02:41:41,430
This one!

4112
02:41:43,450 --> 02:41:45,890
I'm just looking at your POV, Dokkaebi.

4113
02:41:46,450 --> 02:41:49,770
I'm still replaying that!

4114
02:41:50,110 --> 02:41:51,290
I see like...

4115
02:41:51,290 --> 02:41:53,130
I see like...

4116
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:57,610
You're playing fucking acrobatic tap stream trying to fucking save your ass.

4117
02:41:57,610 --> 02:41:59,190
You're just trying to keep me alive!

4118
02:41:59,830 --> 02:42:00,890
And then I tripped again!

4119
02:42:01,850 --> 02:42:03,930
No, that's good that you tripped again.

4120
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:05,030
That's another plus 30.

4121
02:42:05,350 --> 02:42:06,470
Oh yeah, you're right!

4122
02:42:07,430 --> 02:42:08,550
We needed that.

4123
02:42:08,910 --> 02:42:11,310
It added to the content.

4124
02:42:11,430 --> 02:42:12,610
Yeah, it added to it.

4125
02:42:13,230 --> 02:42:14,410
Are you uploading it now?

4126
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:15,070
Come on.

4127
02:42:15,230 --> 02:42:16,330
Come on, Flynn.

4128
02:42:17,090 --> 02:42:19,150
I know how clipping is so fast.

4129
02:42:19,810 --> 02:42:22,550
I'm literally clipping in your profile right now.

4130
02:42:22,550 --> 02:42:23,730
I'm just reloading it.

4131
02:42:23,830 --> 02:42:26,290
I have to like...

4132
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:28,610
Wait, I have to run it through a different app.

4133
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:30,250
Wait, what?

4134
02:42:30,490 --> 02:42:33,410
The export on the...

4135
02:42:33,410 --> 02:42:34,150
Like...

4136
02:42:34,150 --> 02:42:36,870
The thing that I use, I think it's .mkv.

4137
02:42:38,370 --> 02:42:38,930
Like...

4138
02:42:38,930 --> 02:42:40,610
The file is in .mkv.

4139
02:42:41,010 --> 02:42:42,270
And I have to like...

4140
02:42:42,270 --> 02:42:43,030
Change it.

4141
02:42:43,410 --> 02:42:45,630
Because on mkv there's a limit of like...

4142
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:49,010
Try trimming it and then saving it as...

4143
02:42:49,010 --> 02:42:51,750
Yeah, that's what I'm doing now.

4144
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:55,290
Yeah, you trim it and then the export is so fast after that.

4145
02:42:56,050 --> 02:42:58,070
Yeah, I just...

4146
02:42:58,070 --> 02:42:59,610
You don't have to open...

4147
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:01,490
Premiere or something.

4148
02:43:02,350 --> 02:43:02,870
I believe.

4149
02:43:05,490 --> 02:43:06,230
I believe, Flynn.

4150
02:43:06,370 --> 02:43:09,210
It takes a long time to figure this out.

4151
02:43:09,290 --> 02:43:10,450
Okay, don't worry.

4152
02:43:10,950 --> 02:43:12,110
It's fine, it's fine.

4153
02:43:12,810 --> 02:43:14,890
I'll stay in the call, but I'm gonna go offline.

4154
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,510
But it's fine.

4155
02:43:19,090 --> 02:43:20,330
Okay, okay.

4156
02:43:20,330 --> 02:43:22,190
Alright guys, thank you.

4157
02:43:22,210 --> 02:43:24,510
Oh my god, your last post was October 3.

4158
02:43:24,810 --> 02:43:25,830
And you're...

4159
02:43:25,830 --> 02:43:28,590
And the first thing you post after that...

4160
02:43:28,590 --> 02:43:29,310
Is just that.

4161
02:43:30,390 --> 02:43:31,450
We have to.

4162
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:33,210
You have to.

4163
02:43:33,330 --> 02:43:34,930
Does anyone have the Gerard clip?

4164
02:43:35,050 --> 02:43:36,890
So then we can at least like...

4165
02:43:36,890 --> 02:43:40,510
We have the three POVs...

4166
02:43:40,510 --> 02:43:41,750
Of that exact moment.

4167
02:43:46,450 --> 02:43:48,090
Can't wait to end my POV.

4168
02:43:48,090 --> 02:43:49,810
Holy crap, I can't wait.

4169
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:52,730
Thank you guys for watching.

4170
02:43:53,150 --> 02:43:54,730
I'm staying in the call so I know...

4171
02:43:54,730 --> 02:43:56,150
Flame is actually gonna upload it.

4172
02:43:56,290 --> 02:43:56,490
I need it.

4173
02:43:59,050 --> 02:44:00,610
I don't want him to like...

4174
02:44:00,610 --> 02:44:01,730
Pussy out on this one.

4175
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:02,310
Yeah, me too.

4176
02:44:02,350 --> 02:44:03,310
I don't want him to pussy out.

4177
02:44:03,470 --> 02:44:04,210
I'm gonna stay in the call.

4178
02:44:05,090 --> 02:44:07,470
I wanna be there to see everything.

4179
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:08,210
Wait, you got it?

4180
02:44:08,970 --> 02:44:11,710
Dude, do it.

4181
02:44:12,170 --> 02:44:12,930
Wait, you got the trim?

4182
02:44:13,050 --> 02:44:13,590
You got it?

4183
02:44:14,350 --> 02:44:14,870
Yeah, I got it.

4184
02:44:14,870 --> 02:44:16,170
Oh shit, okay.

4185
02:44:16,430 --> 02:44:17,730
Don't worry, I'll be there live.

4186
02:44:18,250 --> 02:44:20,070
I'm camping, I'm reloading.

4187
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:21,770
We're all gonna witness this live.

4188
02:44:22,230 --> 02:44:25,190
And then Gerard just has to end his stream so his clippers can get the clip.

4189
02:44:26,930 --> 02:44:28,890
For the final POV.

4190
02:44:29,770 --> 02:44:31,210
The final piece of the puzzle.

4191
02:44:31,270 --> 02:44:32,950
Yeah, the final piece of the puzzle is Gerard.

4192
02:44:33,210 --> 02:44:35,690
Guys, does anyone know which team it is?

4193
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:37,110
So then we can have the...

4194
02:44:37,110 --> 02:44:39,930
Somebody can clip the team's POV that we were shooting at.

4195
02:44:39,930 --> 02:44:40,470
Oh yeah, you're right.

4196
02:44:41,130 --> 02:44:42,730
The one you were like shooting at me.

4197
02:44:42,730 --> 02:44:43,470
Yeah, yeah.

4198
02:44:43,610 --> 02:44:47,490
If anybody knows the exact team that saw it...

4199
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:49,750
And then someone clip their reaction.

4200
02:44:52,970 --> 02:44:55,810
It would be so funny if they were so flabbergasted.

4201
02:44:55,870 --> 02:44:57,090
Like, what the fuck is that guy doing?

4202
02:44:57,330 --> 02:44:59,050
He's just running down without any armor?

4203
02:45:01,290 --> 02:45:05,390
We need the fourth POV of the enemy team.

4204
02:45:05,610 --> 02:45:09,350
Just to see the whole mess that it came to be.

4205
02:45:09,530 --> 02:45:11,070
You guys are watching the tournament, right?

4206
02:45:11,070 --> 02:45:12,190
Like, check out.

4207
02:45:12,290 --> 02:45:16,310
I want you guys to spy on every one of them's POVs, please.

4208
02:45:16,430 --> 02:45:17,210
Yeah, yeah.

4209
02:45:17,350 --> 02:45:19,630
The fourth POV of the incident.

4210
02:45:20,590 --> 02:45:22,930
The fucking incident.

4211
02:45:23,830 --> 02:45:25,110
The incident.

4212
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:29,550
I'm not seeing any uploads, bro.

4213
02:45:29,730 --> 02:45:31,230
I'm still reloading it.

4214
02:45:31,770 --> 02:45:33,270
His brother is dedicated.

4215
02:45:33,510 --> 02:45:35,430
He'll charge in with no question asked.

4216
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:36,450
The real soldier.

4217
02:45:37,030 --> 02:45:38,210
A true soldier.

4218
02:45:38,210 --> 02:45:38,350
Yeah.

4219
02:45:40,030 --> 02:45:41,870
Good soldiers follow orders.

4220
02:45:42,090 --> 02:45:43,670
You told me to listen to him.

4221
02:45:43,910 --> 02:45:44,770
He knows better.

4222
02:45:45,090 --> 02:45:47,990
And I immediately followed.

4223
02:45:48,550 --> 02:45:52,230
Use your head to figure out what it means.

4224
02:45:52,230 --> 02:45:52,730
Well, I did.

4225
02:45:52,850 --> 02:45:53,750
You said die.

4226
02:45:53,910 --> 02:45:55,110
Am I ready to go?

4227
02:45:55,330 --> 02:46:01,750
I didn't realize Blaine had to be specific about, like, stand here and just die.

4228
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:03,650
I just wanted to get out there and die.

4229
02:46:03,770 --> 02:46:04,750
That's the only thing.

4230
02:46:04,870 --> 02:46:05,970
Get out there and die.

4231
02:46:05,970 --> 02:46:07,650
Okay, I'm going.

4232
02:46:09,870 --> 02:46:11,070
I don't know.

4233
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:12,610
I'm an apex virgin.

4234
02:46:12,710 --> 02:46:14,070
I don't know any of this.

4235
02:46:14,130 --> 02:46:15,090
I barely had any experience.

4236
02:46:15,790 --> 02:46:17,910
The plan versus execution.

4237
02:46:21,830 --> 02:46:23,770
The plan versus execution meme.

4238
02:46:24,310 --> 02:46:25,710
It went so horrible.

4239
02:46:25,870 --> 02:46:26,810
But it was so funny.

4240
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:30,350
It worked out in the end.

4241
02:46:30,430 --> 02:46:32,090
You didn't fully die.

4242
02:46:33,390 --> 02:46:35,510
At least you got something out of that, right?

4243
02:46:35,510 --> 02:46:35,570
Yeah.

4244
02:46:36,590 --> 02:46:38,030
We got content.

4245
02:46:38,650 --> 02:46:40,090
We got double res, dude.

4246
02:46:40,270 --> 02:46:42,230
It was part of a master plan.

4247
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:45,050
We got double the amount of points.

4248
02:46:47,970 --> 02:46:49,190
Well, at least.

4249
02:46:50,430 --> 02:46:52,730
My throat hurts from laughing.

4250
02:46:54,210 --> 02:46:59,010
Honestly, I don't think anybody had a better clip moment than that moment.

4251
02:46:59,230 --> 02:47:00,930
Throughout this entire tournament.

4252
02:47:01,230 --> 02:47:03,630
Everyone was just so serious and it's just us.

4253
02:47:03,630 --> 02:47:07,630
That was actually the best moment in this entire tournament.

4254
02:47:07,650 --> 02:47:10,610
I don't think anybody experienced what we just experienced.

4255
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:14,350
I mean, to be fair, I'm the only bronze player.

4256
02:47:14,370 --> 02:47:19,710
I don't think anyone was crazy enough like me to put a bronze player in this lobby.

4257
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:23,930
Silver and gold probably, but not a fucking bronze.

4258
02:47:23,930 --> 02:47:25,590
They're like, chug it, gold player, right?

4259
02:47:25,730 --> 02:47:27,050
And I was like, fuck it.

4260
02:47:27,070 --> 02:47:28,890
I don't know anybody that's gold or silver.

4261
02:47:29,230 --> 02:47:31,470
Let's go after Arden here.

4262
02:47:33,630 --> 02:47:34,990
Literally last pick from the playground.

4263
02:47:35,190 --> 02:47:36,410
That's literally what happened.

4264
02:47:39,410 --> 02:47:41,410
When we made it far.

4265
02:47:41,570 --> 02:47:42,690
We made it so far.

4266
02:47:43,050 --> 02:47:43,830
I know.

4267
02:47:44,350 --> 02:47:50,570
We made it further than other teams that had really stacked teams.

4268
02:47:51,110 --> 02:47:56,670
Teams that had three master players or masters and diamond players.

4269
02:47:56,890 --> 02:47:58,470
We probably did scrims too, right?

4270
02:47:58,890 --> 02:47:59,810
Oh yeah, 100%.

4271
02:47:59,810 --> 02:48:01,010
No, they did scrims.

4272
02:48:01,030 --> 02:48:02,170
We did not do scrims.

4273
02:48:02,950 --> 02:48:05,110
Maybe scrims would have helped us out.

4274
02:48:07,410 --> 02:48:10,990
It was literally six hours before the tournament, I think.

4275
02:48:11,090 --> 02:48:12,090
No, it was not six hours.

4276
02:48:12,090 --> 02:48:14,270
I asked you 14 hours before the tournament.

4277
02:48:14,670 --> 02:48:19,230
It was literally last fucking minute.

4278
02:48:19,450 --> 02:48:22,390
If it was six hours, I'd be really fucked.

4279
02:48:24,610 --> 02:48:25,410
Oh my God.

4280
02:48:25,410 --> 02:48:31,790
Literally, after I ended my 11-hour stream, I saw your message and was like, holy fuck.

4281
02:48:31,930 --> 02:48:32,390
Tomorrow?

4282
02:48:33,010 --> 02:48:34,130
Okay, Saturday, I can do it.

4283
02:48:34,210 --> 02:48:36,290
And then I woke up literally the next day.

4284
02:48:36,550 --> 02:48:38,490
Holy shit, it's in four hours.

4285
02:48:38,850 --> 02:48:40,570
The tournament has been in four hours.

4286
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:44,250
And my manager was like, what the fuck are you doing?

4287
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:47,270
Wait, you uploaded it?

4288
02:48:47,710 --> 02:48:47,990
Yeah.

4289
02:48:48,950 --> 02:48:49,470
Nice.

4290
02:48:50,970 --> 02:48:54,510
Oh my God, you're finally active on social media again.

4291
02:48:55,630 --> 02:48:56,130
Oh my God, incredible.

4292
02:48:59,150 --> 02:49:00,470
Shout out to my dude.

4293
02:49:00,630 --> 02:49:02,850
When I say jump, he says, how high?

4294
02:49:06,270 --> 02:49:08,290
This is his POV.

4295
02:49:11,590 --> 02:49:12,910
Oh my God, I'm going to link it.

4296
02:49:13,450 --> 02:49:15,130
I want everybody to watch this.

4297
02:49:15,590 --> 02:49:17,130
Here, I'm going to put it in my chat.

4298
02:49:19,130 --> 02:49:23,490
I like how Flame was dodging every bullet just to save your ass.

4299
02:49:27,010 --> 02:49:27,410
There.

4300
02:49:28,270 --> 02:49:31,470
If everyone's watching right now, just check out the link that I put in the chat.

4301
02:49:31,930 --> 02:49:32,690
Go look at it.

4302
02:49:32,690 --> 02:49:36,930
I like how they have no context because it's a three-minute delay, so they just see it as random.

4303
02:49:37,290 --> 02:49:38,910
They just see it as a link.

4304
02:49:39,330 --> 02:49:40,710
It's like a random link.

4305
02:49:40,870 --> 02:49:43,150
It's just POV.

4306
02:49:45,410 --> 02:49:48,330
Actually, I think it took so long for me to get it out.

4307
02:49:48,730 --> 02:49:53,270
This probably comes like just in time, as you were saying.

4308
02:49:53,270 --> 02:49:54,590
Oh yeah, you're right.

4309
02:49:55,130 --> 02:49:59,130
Upload it now!

4310
02:50:00,350 --> 02:50:00,770
Die!

4311
02:50:00,990 --> 02:50:01,830
Yes, ma'am.

4312
02:50:03,610 --> 02:50:04,990
Oh my God.

4313
02:50:05,550 --> 02:50:06,210
Oh my God.

4314
02:50:06,970 --> 02:50:07,550
Oh my God.

4315
02:50:08,970 --> 02:50:10,650
Thank you, Gerard.

4316
02:50:11,690 --> 02:50:12,090
Thank you.

4317
02:50:12,450 --> 02:50:14,430
Thank you.

4318
02:50:14,770 --> 02:50:17,490
Now you made Flame appreciate his teammates more.

4319
02:50:17,490 --> 02:50:18,090
Big shout -out to you, Gerard.

4320
02:50:18,190 --> 02:50:19,330
You made losing fun.

4321
02:50:21,710 --> 02:50:24,070
It was all possible to all of you.

4322
02:50:24,190 --> 02:50:24,830
Thank you.

4323
02:50:25,850 --> 02:50:26,690
Thank you.

4324
02:50:26,690 --> 02:50:30,190
You made him appreciate his teammates even more now.

4325
02:50:30,190 --> 02:50:31,330
Without you, that wouldn't have happened.

4326
02:50:34,170 --> 02:50:36,870
You're gonna hug him really tight after this one.

4327
02:50:40,070 --> 02:50:42,230
Flame's team, he managed to get...

4328
02:50:42,230 --> 02:50:43,810
was it fourth or third place?

4329
02:50:45,090 --> 02:50:46,530
We got third last year.

4330
02:50:46,530 --> 02:50:47,310
He got third, yeah.

4331
02:50:47,530 --> 02:50:54,110
He got third place in ALGS with a full mouse and keyboard team, Gerard.

4332
02:50:54,810 --> 02:50:58,070
And I think this was more stressful than what he had to go through.

4333
02:51:03,130 --> 02:51:10,330
I think this exact moment is more stressful than handling a 3M and K team.

4334
02:51:12,090 --> 02:51:14,690
I kinda see it.

4335
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:16,870
You had fun, right?

4336
02:51:16,930 --> 02:51:17,810
It wasn't stressful, right?

4337
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:18,710
Prove her wrong.

4338
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:26,750
First day was stressful, right?

4339
02:51:27,330 --> 02:51:28,670
First day was stressful, right?

4340
02:51:29,130 --> 02:51:31,170
Compared to the first day.

4341
02:51:32,770 --> 02:51:34,470
Both days were fun, though.

4342
02:51:34,590 --> 02:51:36,050
Both days were really fun.

4343
02:51:37,130 --> 02:51:37,810
Alright, guys.

4344
02:51:38,530 --> 02:51:39,830
We need one more.

4345
02:51:40,210 --> 02:51:42,990
We just need Gerard's and the enemy team's POV.

4346
02:51:42,990 --> 02:51:44,730
Whenever you guys post it.

4347
02:51:44,850 --> 02:51:46,890
And then I'll retweet it whenever you guys get it.

4348
02:51:47,770 --> 02:51:50,990
We have all the POVs.

4349
02:51:51,710 --> 02:51:53,350
We have the full story.

4350
02:51:53,890 --> 02:51:54,990
We're documenting everything.

4351
02:51:59,430 --> 02:52:00,970
The GG's, guys.

4352
02:52:01,410 --> 02:52:01,930
GG's.

4353
02:52:01,930 --> 02:52:03,010
I had a fun time.

4354
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:04,250
Good game, everybody.

4355
02:52:04,430 --> 02:52:04,770
Good game.

4356
02:52:04,770 --> 02:52:07,150
Until the next tournament, if ever that's gonna happen.

4357
02:52:07,150 --> 02:52:09,050
Thank you again for joining me.

4358
02:52:09,290 --> 02:52:10,130
Thank you, guys.

4359
02:52:10,130 --> 02:52:11,210
I appreciate it.

4360
02:52:11,410 --> 02:52:12,190
Thank you, Flame.

4361
02:52:13,310 --> 02:52:14,830
Oh, it's Saturday.

4362
02:52:15,290 --> 02:52:16,390
You don't have scrims.

4363
02:52:16,750 --> 02:52:18,810
We're not gonna have scrims for, like, two weeks.

4364
02:52:19,550 --> 02:52:20,950
Oh, yeah, because it's a holiday.

4365
02:52:21,310 --> 02:52:22,090
Holiday break.

4366
02:52:22,150 --> 02:52:22,550
You're free.

4367
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:26,070
Don't forget to follow Doki and Flame.

4368
02:52:26,490 --> 02:52:27,390
Thank you so much.

4369
02:52:28,310 --> 02:52:29,590
Check them out, guys.

4370
02:52:29,930 --> 02:52:30,990
Check them out, everybody.

4371
02:52:31,690 --> 02:52:33,410
I'll see you guys then.

4372
02:52:33,510 --> 02:52:34,510
I'll see you two later.

4373
02:52:35,830 --> 02:52:37,070
Bye-bye, guys.

4374
02:52:37,070 --> 02:52:37,730
Bye-bye.

4375
02:52:40,190 --> 02:52:40,630
GG's.

4376
02:52:41,550 --> 02:52:42,730
Alright, that was fun.

4377
02:52:42,930 --> 02:52:44,070
We made it really far.

4378
02:52:44,250 --> 02:52:45,450
We were so close to winners.

4379
02:52:45,750 --> 02:52:46,890
But honestly, I'm tired.

4380
02:52:47,150 --> 02:52:49,350
So, like, it's a blessing in disguise.

4381
02:52:49,730 --> 02:52:51,970
Because, like, this is my break week.

4382
02:52:55,170 --> 02:52:58,390
Like, after the original is over, I'm just like, you know, that's alright.

4383
02:52:58,530 --> 02:53:00,510
I'm okay with not making it to finals.

4384
02:53:00,930 --> 02:53:03,230
I get to rest a little bit more tomorrow.

4385
02:53:04,230 --> 02:53:05,710
After the convention.

4386
02:53:05,990 --> 02:53:07,610
I'm okay with that.

4387
02:53:09,530 --> 02:53:11,810
But I had so much fun.

4388
02:53:12,450 --> 02:53:13,890
A lot of fun.

4389
02:53:14,950 --> 02:53:17,230
And everything was...

4390
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:20,970
It was Sakura's team!

4391
02:53:23,290 --> 02:53:25,590
Sakura's team that this happened with.

4392
02:53:25,990 --> 02:53:26,950
Oh my god.

4393
02:53:27,270 --> 02:53:29,730
I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching it.

4394
02:53:31,010 --> 02:53:34,690
And it was honestly such a great time.

4395
02:53:35,050 --> 02:53:35,890
Wait, I need to tell them.

4396
02:53:36,070 --> 02:53:37,730
Wait, are they still in the beast or not, right?

4397
02:53:38,950 --> 02:53:40,450
I'm going to tell them.

4398
02:53:40,550 --> 02:53:49,330
At strafing in, the team that saw all of this was the main organizer team.

4399
02:53:50,010 --> 02:53:50,610
Sakura.

4400
02:53:50,990 --> 02:53:51,730
The map.

4401
02:54:02,150 --> 02:54:03,770
That's so funny.

4402
02:54:04,730 --> 02:54:05,930
Holy shit.

4403
02:54:05,930 --> 02:54:08,130
That's so funny.

4404
02:54:15,330 --> 02:54:16,990
Do you know what it means?

4405
02:54:17,310 --> 02:54:20,770
We absolutely have the POV.

4406
02:54:29,290 --> 02:54:30,330
Anyway, guys.

4407
02:54:30,750 --> 02:54:32,210
That was really fun.

4408
02:54:32,310 --> 02:54:33,150
I'm happy to play with Jirard.

4409
02:54:33,450 --> 02:54:36,390
And playing with Jirard really made the tournament less stressful.

4410
02:54:37,750 --> 02:54:38,530
I mean, for me.

4411
02:54:39,170 --> 02:54:39,970
Less stressful.

4412
02:54:39,970 --> 02:54:40,930
It was...

4413
02:54:41,770 --> 02:54:43,250
Oh my god!

4414
02:54:43,530 --> 02:54:46,210
It was on the main stream too!

4415
02:54:46,750 --> 02:54:49,540
Look at that!

4416
02:54:58,100 --> 02:54:59,300
Oh my god.

4417
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:00,300
That's so funny.

4418
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:03,160
Thank you so much.

4419
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:05,040
Thank you for the chips.

4420
02:55:05,320 --> 02:55:07,680
I really appreciate it.

4421
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:08,440
Alright, guys.

4422
02:55:08,620 --> 02:55:09,460
Thank you all for watching.

4423
02:55:09,460 --> 02:55:10,980
As always, everybody, say hi to Jirard.

4424
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:12,880
Check him around to get that blood flowing.

4425
02:55:13,020 --> 02:55:14,400
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4426
02:55:14,500 --> 02:55:15,600
Because you deserve it.

4427
02:55:15,700 --> 02:55:16,900
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4428
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:18,060
Bye, guys.

4429
02:55:18,340 --> 02:55:18,660
Bye!
